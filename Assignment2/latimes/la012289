<P>
On its simplest, silliest level Herbie Goes Bananas (ABC Sunday at 7 p.m.), the 
Latin American adventures of the anthropomorphic VW bug, is agreeable enough 
piffle. In this 1980 release, the fourth in the popular series, Herbie's new 
owner, a young racing-car driver (Stephen Burns), and his sidekick (Charles 
Martin Smith) hope to race Herbie in Brazil's Grande Premio. 
</P>
<P>
The new four-hour, two-part Brotherhood of the Rose (NBC Sunday at 9 p.m., 
completed Monday at 9 p.m.) pits father, a CIA deputy director (Robert 
Mitchum), against his CIA agent-sons (Peter Strauss, David Morse). 
</P>
<P>
Warren Beatty's Heaven Can Wait (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.) is a rousing, 
deliciously sophisticated update of the 1941 fantasy "Here Comes Mr. Jordan" 
that preserves the wonderful, funny, lyrical optimism of the original. Beatty 
produced, co-authored (with Elaine May) and co-directed (with Buck Henry) this 
1978 production in which he stars as a pro football quarterback whose death is 
untimely in every sense and who gets two more tries at earthly pleasures. 
</P>
<P>
In the quietly endearing 1982 Tex (Channel 5 at 8 p.m. Monday and Saturday), 
Matt Dillon stars as an impoverished, small-town Oklahoma 15-year-old in this 
Tim Burton film of S.E. Hinton's novel. He's one of a group of likable, 
resilient teen-agers, some trapped by the burden of too-early maturity, getting 
on with their lives yet valuing the bonds of friendship and familial love. 
</P>
<P>
The Day After (ABC Monday at 9 p.m.), Nicholas Meyer's shocking, horrifying and 
utterly uncompromising 1983 TV movie about the lethal impact on Lawrence, Kan., 
when nearby Kansas City is destroyed by Soviet missiles, is being repeated, but 
be warned: It's a half-hour shorter than the 2 1/2-hour length at which it 
originally was aired, having already been pared down from four hours. Jason 
Robards stars as a Kansas City surgeon who is making the 37-mile trip to 
Lawrence when the missiles hit. 
</P>
<P>
Broken Arrow (Channel 11 Tuesday at 8 p.m.) is an authentic and engrossing 1950 
Western in which Jeff Chandler's Cochise and an ex-Army man (James Stewart) 
join to seek peace between settlers and Indians. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1954 Western Broken Lance (Channel 11 Wednesday at 8 p.m.), Spencer 
Tracy plays a Lear-like rancher losing control of both his family and his 
cattle empire. 
</P>
<P>
With a wild and antic imagination, The In-Laws (Channel 13 Wednesday at 8 p.m.) 
has Peter Falk sweep Alan Arkin, his son's future father-in-law who's a nice, 
decent Manhattan dentist, into an adventure crazier than Arkin's wildest 
imaginings. Directed in 1979 by Arthur Hiller. 
</P>
<P>
The Return of a Man Called Horse (Channel 5 Thursday at 8 p.m.), decidedly 
superior to the original, finds Richard Harris as an English lord returning to 
the Dakota Territory for more adventures. 
</P>
<P>
All That Jazz (Channel 13 Thursday at 8 p.m.) can now only seem more poignant: 
The late Bob Fosse predicted his own untimely death in this sleek, 
autobiographical musical about an intense, womanizing Broadway 
director-choreographer, played by Roy Scheider. 
</P>
<P>
The 1988 TV movie Man Against the Mob (NBC Friday at 9 p.m.) stars George 
Peppard as a police detective taking on Chicago mobsters and corruption in Los 
Angeles in the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
Sam Fuller's The Big Red One (Channel 9 Saturday at 8 p.m.) is a handsome, 
almost leisurely recollection of the World War II experiences of five soldiers, 
told from the point of view of the foot soldier whose dearest victory is merely 
surviving. Lee Marvin stars.

COSMIC CHRIST COMES TO MOTHER EARTH; 
</P>
<P>
THE COMING OF THE COSMIC CHRIST; 
</P>
<P>
THE HEALING OF MOTHER EARTH AND THE BIRTH OF A GLOBAL RENAISSANCE BY MATTHEW 
FOX (HARPER &amp; ROW: $14.95, PAPER; 278 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mark E. DeVries, DeVries is a student in the Ph.D. program in clinical 
psychology at Fuller Theological Seminary, Pasadena. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his 1983 book "Original Blessing," Matthew Fox, a Dominican priest, drew a 
distinction between "creation-centered" spirituality and "Fall/Redemption" 
theology. The latter derives from Augustine and emphasizes original sin, the 
need for individual redemption and faith as intellectual assent. The former, 
based largely on medieval mystics such as Meister Eckhart and Hildegard of 
Bingen, celebrates the original goodness of creation, calls for cosmic 
redemption and understands faith as basic trust. 
</P>
<P>
Fox's new book "The Coming of the Cosmic Christ" elaborates on the ideas 
proposed in "Original Blessing." He begins his new book with a bleak 
description of the state of the world as he sees it. Humanity is committing 
matricide against Mother Earth by polluting its waters, abusing its non-human 
creatures, wasting its resources on weapons of destruction and ignoring the 
anawim, the oppressed and dispossessed of the world. This foreboding analysis 
counterbalances the optimism put forth in "Original Blessing" just five years 
ago. With apocalyptic fervor, Fox warns that, at the current rate, humanity is 
headed for destruction. It is a thoroughly depressing and frightening account. 
</P>
<P>
The destruction of the Earth is the primary spiritual and ethical issue of our 
time, claims Fox. He proposes that Mother Earth's salvation lies in a renewed 
awareness of the Cosmic Christ. The archaic notion of private salvation as put 
forth in the Fall/Redemption tradition has run its course and is no longer 
relevant to the perils that threaten Mother Earth and its human and nonhuman 
inhabitants. 
</P>
<P>
Fox calls the recovery of the Cosmic Christ a "paradigm shift," after Thomas S. 
Kuhn. The prime concern of the last century's theology, he notes, was the quest 
for the historical Jesus. Without abandoning this quest, Fox calls for a move 
to cosmic interpretations of the main events in Jesus' life as recorded n the 
Scriptures: the infancy, baptism and temptations, transfiguration, Crucifixion, 
Resurrection and ascension. 
</P>
<P>
Fox identifies and castigates a number of obstacles to the recovery of the 
Cosmic Christ, most of them coming from the political and religious right. But 
he is critical of religious liberals as well. He faults the Enlightenment with 
engendering a rationalistic world view that squelches mysticism and creativity. 
His other villains include "Christofascism," Fall/Redemption theology, 
patriarchy, adultism, nationalism, anthropocentrism, psychologism and a roster 
of other "isms." His idiosyncratic vocabulary obscures his message at times, 
and even his best ideas get lost in a sea of redundancy. At half the length, 
"The Coming of the Cosmic Christ" would be twice as convincing. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Fox's compelling portrayal of Earth's peril and his ardent call for 
spiritual renewal, his vision will strike many Christians, not to speak of 
others, as a fanciful dream. Even if one shares his abhorrence of 
"Christofascism" and the like, his call to "deep ecumenism," in which the 
world's major religions renounce their claims of ultimate truth, is, to put it 
very mildly, not likely to be widely answered. 
</P>
<P>
The strength of his book is a feminist strength. Founder of Oakland's Institute 
in Culture and Creation Spirituality, he is at his best in a critique of the 
destructive side of patriarchal religion, particularly patriarchal 
Christianity. Fox calls for a recovery of a feminist spirituality that has been 
repressed for centuries and has only recently begun to re-emerge. He offers a 
number of suggestions for renewing worship practices and for recovering the 
mystical and artistic side of worship. 
</P>
<P>
Few Christians, however, will follow Fox in his blurring of the line between 
the creator and the created. Fox refers repeatedly to the divinity inherent in 
all of humanity and in all of creation. But if humanity is innately divine, one 
wonders, why have we made such a mess of things? Why are we destroying the 
Earth? 
</P>
<P>
Fox would respond that we need to realize our own divinity. The Vatican's 
response, it should be noted, has been a year of enforced silence for Fox, 
which he began on the morrow of a full-page advertisement in the New York 
Times: "My Final Statement Before Being Silenced by the Vatican." Enforced 
silence is no solution, yet Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, head of the Vatican 
Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, may be wrong without proving 
Matthew Fox right. Fox knows many things, but the Vatican hedgehog may know one 
as well.

WOMEN AND THE ISLAMIC REVOLUTION BY MINOU REEVES (E. P. DUTTON: $17.95; 210 
PP.; 0-525-24712-2) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Nesta Ramazani, Ramazani writes on the subject of women in the Muslim world, 
her articles appearing in such journals as the Middle East Journal, Middle East 
Insight, and Journal of South Asian and Middle Eastern Studies. She is the 
author of Persian Cooking (University Press of Virginia). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the decade since the overthrow of the regime of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi 
and the start of the Iranian revolution, a virulent strain of Islamic 
fundamentalism has spread throughout the Muslim world, espousing a social order 
that appears to promote medieval attitudes, to restrict individual freedoms and 
to foster misogynist beliefs. Yet, women in one Muslim country after another, 
many of them educated in the West, have flocked to its banner, repudiating 
Western clothing and value systems and declaring themselves willing to fight 
and die for their beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
Those early Western-inspired feminist movements in such countries as Egypt, 
Iran, Lebanon and even Turkey, which sought to improve the lot of women through 
legislation limiting polygamy and restricting men's freewheeling divorce and 
custody rights, appear to be dead. In their place have emerged widespread 
demands to return to Islamic roots, to rescind foreign-inspired legislation, to 
reintroduce Islamic sharia law, to re-segregate educational systems. And 
everywhere, women appear in the forefront of a movement to return to a 
seemingly outmoded way of life, one that restricts their activities and limits 
their choices. 
</P>
<P>
Minou Reeves seeks to explore the reasons for the resurgence of Islam in the 
late 20th Century, to explain the baffling paradox of women who freely 
sacrifice their lives in war, bravely engage in guerrilla attacks, actively 
take part in combat, yet voluntarily return to the veil, historically a symbol 
of their exclusion from public life. 
</P>
<P>
In seeking to uncover the sources of a phenomenon that has baffled and even 
frightened many world leaders, the author links the resurgence of Islamic 
traditions to anti-Western attitudes, whose roots lie in centuries of 
confrontation between the West and the Islamic world, and more recently in 
"anti-colonialist" and "anti-imperialist" sentiments born of post-World War II 
experiences with foreign powers. 
</P>
<P>
She outlines the historical development of repressive customs and attitudes 
toward women in Muslim societies, in spite of Islam's originally liberating and 
progressive tenets. She delineates the absorption into Islam of such 
pre-existing local customs and practices as veiling and polygamy, showing how 
obscurantist exegetes reinforced the misogynistic attitudes of patriarchal 
societies. 
</P>
<P>
She follows the emergence in the late 19th and early 20th centuries of Muslim 
reformers in Egypt and Tunisia who objected to misogynistic interpretations of 
the Koran and the hadith (the sayings of the prophet Muhammad). She touches 
upon early 20th-Century reforms in such countries as Tunisia, Iran and Turkey, 
which resulted from attempts at modernization inspired by Western models. She 
sees feminism within the broader framework of nationalist and socialist 
tendencies of the time. 
</P>
<P>
The major contribution of this book lies in the author's sketching of the 
larger historical and political framework for today's Islamic revival and in 
making it clear that the resurgence of Islam cannot be understood outside of 
the nationalist revival. The author has tackled a large and complex subject and 
has managed to weave together many strands into a comprehensible and valuable 
whole. 
</P>
<P>
A narrower focus, however -- on Iran alone -- might have made this an even more 
valuable book. The author has spread herself thin by attempting to cover too 
much. Although she singles out Iran as the major moving force behind the 
Islamic revival, in touching on events in a number of other Muslim countries 
she neither does justice to them, nor to Iran. Had she concentrated exclusively 
on the Iranian revolution, the author might have succeeded in exploring the 
resurgence of Islam in far greater depth. 
</P>
<P>
She might, for example, have examined in more detail -- and with actual 
anecdotal accounts -- the difficulties that a tradition-bound and 
underdeveloped country such as Iran faced when trying to compress several 
hundred years of modernization into one or two decades. She might have 
explained what cultural aspects of Western culture have been so offensive to 
Muslim sensibilities as to have provoked violent rejection. 
</P>
<P>
She might have recounted, through the testimony of those who lived through the 
revolution, what it was like to have experienced the trauma and the chaos of 
those times. She might have studied, through the words of Iranian religious 
leaders (many of whom are at odds with one another), the unresolved conflicts 
over national goals, philosophy, and identity that continue to plague Iran and 
that, at a deeper level, were to some degree responsible for the force of the 
explosion that rocked this ancient land. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, by limiting her sources to published documents, the author, in the 
end, does not succeed in leading the reader across the cultural barriers to see 
events as an insider. 
</P>
<P>
Despite these shortcomings, however, this book is a much-needed corrective to 
the paucity of objective information available to Western readers on the 
subject of Muslim women. It goes a long way toward combatting much 
disinformation, as well as misinformation, on the Muslim world in general and 
its women in particular. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, writing as she was at the height of Iran's xenophobic anti-Westernism, 
the author could not have foreseen the current trend in Iran toward moderation 
and pragmatism, as exemplified by the ending of the Iran-Iraq war. Recalled 
from the front, women are having to put down their arms and set aside their 
virulent anti-Western rhetoric. What role they will be allowed to play, amid 
the high unemployment and economic chaos of their war-torn and 
revolution-ravaged land, remains to be seen. But that is another chapter, and 
it has not yet been written.

I was amazed by Joan Franco's ability to meet the challenges of her daily life 
("Big," by Cathryn Jakobson, Nov. 27). I was, however, struck by something 
Franco said: " 'I think we were better off before the women's movement. Now 
we're stuck with two full-time jobs: raising a family, and working outside the 
home.' " 
</P>
<P>
The women's movement is focused on giving women their full range of choices as 
human beings -- whether that choice is to be a full-time parent, work full time 
in the work force, or some combination. Franco herself has expresses the need 
of all women when she notes that she works as a nurse not only for the money 
but also for the stimulation. Women are whole people. No woman should be forced 
to sacrifice one or the other in order to satisfy society's stereotypes. 
Without the movement, no woman, including Franco, would even have the option of 
making a choice.

'THE ART WORLD IS RIPE FOR ME'; 
</P>
<P>
JEFF KOONS' HIGH-PROFILE MARKETING AND MEDIA MANIPULATION MAKES HIS TALENT SEEM 
SECONDARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KRISTINE McKENNA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every so often an artist comes along who really seems to bug people and Jeff 
Koons is this year's model. A former publicist for the Museum of Modern Art who 
spent five years on Wall Street selling bonds and futures, the 34-year-old 
Koons is so adept at deal-making and manipulating the media that his artworks 
are so much icing on the cake of his career. 
</P>
<P>
Whereas artists have traditionally been highly discreet about marketing 
strategies, Koons brandishes his like a revolver, and though this bracing slap 
in the face has collectors clamoring for the opportunity to fork over a few 
hundred grand for the privilege of owning one of his pieces, (he interviews 
potential buyers before allowing them the honor), many observers find the 
artist to be symptomatic of all that is currently wrong with the art world. 
</P>
<P>
"In the late '80s the art world is dominated more than ever by the almighty 
buck and no artist is more informed by this climate than Koons," comments New 
York Times art critic Michael Brenson. "At a time when artists have become 
known for their entrepreneurial skills, he's brazen in his entrepreneurial 
ambition and seems to want more money than any artist his age has ever made for 
art." 
</P>
<P>
Koons is getting more money too. A recent series of work unveiled last December 
was executed in an edition of three so that the same exhibition could 
simultaneously take place in New York, Chicago and Cologne, West Germany. If 
all the shows sold out (and by now they surely have) Koons stands to take in 
more than $5 million. Adding insult to injury, Koons promoted the show with a 
series of glossy ads (shot by glamour photographer Greg Gorman) starring Jeff 
Koons, made up like a male model and posed at the center of six different 
scenarios, one of which depicted the artist perched on a throne, proclaiming 
himself king of the art world. 
</P>
<P>
Shameless grandstanding of this sort doesn't hit the art world too often so it 
does tend to make people sit up and take notice. "This is a fabulous time to be 
an artist, " crows Koons. "The art world is absolutely ripe for someone like 
me." 
</P>
<P>
With his career best described as a series of carefully executed advertising 
campaigns, Koons has done a masterful job of fabricating an easily identifiable 
persona for himself, however, his high profile doesn't necessarily mean he's 
well-loved. 
</P>
<P>
"Jeff knows the mechanisms of advertising and media extremely well and that 
seems to disturb a lot of people," observes Ann Goldstein, a curator for MOCA 
who selected Koons as one of 30 artists to be included in "Forest of Signs," an 
eagerly anticipated show that opens in May. "His knowledge of those fields is 
an integral part of his work, which explores the power of representation in the 
mass media." 
</P>
<P>
And what do Koons' explorations of the power of mass media look like? His 
recent show included "Popples," a porcelain knock-off of a stuffed rabbit with 
blue nose and yellow hair ($50,000); a life-sized polychromed wood replica of 
Buster Keaton on a donkey ($100,000); and a gilded Rococo mirror in the shape 
of Christ ($150,000). In short, the sort of stuff you'd expect to find in 
Liberace's garage. Ostensibly an inquiry into the hidden life of objects and 
how we relate to our possessions, Koons' oversized Hummel figures vibrate with 
the garish, hysterical cheerfulness we associate with shopping malls and 
amusement parks. 
</P>
<P>
The Koonsian sales pitch that accompanies this bizarre melange of stuffed 
animals, pop stars and lawn statuary goes something like this: 
</P>
<P>
"My pieces are very bourgeois -- in fact, I want them to be the epitome of 
bourgeois because that is the rallying call of the middle class," Koons said in 
an interview at a Beverly Hills hotel. An impeccably mannered man whose 
unctuous manner leaves a grease stain on every sentence he utters, Koons goes 
on to explain that "right now I'm very interested in banality and see banality 
as a savior. The bourgeoisie feels tremendous guilt about their moral position 
in the world today, but I say to them, embrace your guilt, embrace your 
banality and move forward. I want to remove the guilt we feel for responding to 
banality." 
</P>
<P>
Fed on mass media, Koons is big fan of the advertising industry and has 
formulated the ideas about class struggle, desire and manipulation that inform 
his work simply by being a child of his times. His hotel room is littered with 
popular magazines like Spin, Rolling Stone and the Face, and he confesses that 
when he watches television, he constantly flips through all 35 channels. Asked 
what's currently inspiring him, he mentions rock group Guns N' Roses. "I like 
their tattoos and the way they've marketed themselves," he explains. He admits 
to having been influenced by the ideas of Marcel Duchamp and Andy Warhol, 
however, his real hero is Michael Jackson. "The responsibility of the artist is 
to seduce, manipulate and win his negotiations and Michael Jackson is a great 
negotiator," he said, glowing with admiration. 
</P>
<P>
Koons' unique blend of juvenile fantasy and messianic quest is what separates 
him from the Appropriationist movement with which he was originally associated. 
Though both Koons and Appropriationism are steeped in irony, Koons' unbridled 
lust for attention and the coarse sexuality of his work signal a naivete one 
isn't likely to find in work by Appropriationist artists Barbara Kruger or 
Richard Prince. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, Koons' work gives off an incredibly powerful feeling of adolescence in 
its smutty sexuality and desire to shock," observes New Yorker art critic Adam 
Gopnik. "His stuff is rebellious in a very adolescent way, and though everyone 
talks about how shrewdly he's handled his career, he's actually done it very 
crudely. He's not a very good advertising guy. The striking thing about the ads 
he recently ran in the art magazines is that they don't look like ads -- they 
look like a 12-year-old boy's idea of an ad; me, sexy girls and a lot of stuff. 
That's not the way advertising people think. Real ads tend to be much more 
elliptical and artful." 
</P>
<P>
Koons lives in New York with his girlfriend of five years, Lizz Lambert, in a 
full-service hotel near Wall Street. The telephone is his primary creative tool 
and he doesn't have a studio because he neither draws nor paints. Rather, he 
harvests the trends, beliefs and desires that he detects floating through the 
collective consciousness and selects objects that embody those things. He then 
takes these objects to fabricators in Northern Italy who reproduce them, thus 
converting them into exorbitantly expensive avant-garde art. 
</P>
<P>
Expanding on the Duchampian tradition of the ready-made, Koons previous series 
involved vacuum cleaners encased in plexiglass, basketballs suspended in tanks 
of water, sports equipment cast in bronze and kitsch bar accessories fabricated 
in stainless steel. Each of these suites of objects came accompanied by a set 
of related posters and a new bit of sloganeering (luxury, entropy, degradation 
and equilibrium are Koons' favored buzzwords). Keeping a low profile in 
Manhattan throughout the early '80s, Koons emerged as a more or less mature 
artist in 1985 when he had his first one-man show at the now defunct 
International With Monument Gallery in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"When I saw Jeff's first show it was an epiphanous experience," recalls L.A. 
dealer Dan Weinberg, an early supporter of Koons' work. "Here was a guy making 
sculpture that I had not seen before and my response was immediate and very 
strong. His work is brilliantly inventive and, treading that fine line between 
kitsch and fine art as it does, really changes the way we look at sculpture. 
Whether or not you like his posturing, Jeff has to be taken seriously and if I 
were making bets on artists today I'd certainly say he's going to be around for 
a while." 
</P>
<P>
Born in York, Pa., Koons has been confident of his talent from the time he was 
a small child. 
</P>
<P>
"From the time I was 4, I felt like an artist," he recalls with a warm chuckle. 
"I have a photo of myself when I was 5 sitting with my crayons just displaying 
this integrity of being an artist. 
</P>
<P>
"I grew up in a family that moved through the middle-class mobility structure 
very rapidly," he continues. "My father was an interior decorator who also sold 
furniture and he had a store in York. We lived in a small home until I was 5, 
then we moved to an extremely large house -- the largest home in the area in 
fact. My parents always lived a little beyond their means, but money was never 
a source of worry in the house, and they joined the local country club and we 
had horses and kennels. My grandfather was a politician who had a large farm 
and he collected carriages -- kind of elitist, royal, monarchical type 
carriages, and we'd ride in them in the local parades. I felt like a little 
prince when I was growing up and I still feel that way today." 
</P>
<P>
While describing himself as a little prince, Koons insists that his work is, 
nonetheless, selflessly egalitarian and wholly committed to social change. 
</P>
<P>
"The freedoms that are fought for by art are never fought in the streets," he 
says, feverishly smoking a Marlboro. "My work is absolutely Populist. It 
functions on a wide basis which means it affects all of society, satisfying the 
needs of everyone and encouraging a leveling of class differentiation." 
</P>
<P>
"If Jeff Koons' work is about class struggle, I am Maria of Romania," counters 
Time magazine art critic Robert Hughes with a hearty laugh. "Only a fool could 
believe his work has anything to do with class struggle -- he probably knows as 
much about the subject as Clem Greenberg knows about the history of fly tying 
in Scotland in the 1890s. Koons' work has no real aesthetic dimension and is 
essentially about jargon and hype. It's making an impact because he's extremely 
good at promoting himself, and the art world is grievously ill at the moment." 
</P>
<P>
That might be the one thing Koons and Hughes agree about. Art's 
ever-diminishing power to effect social change is one of Koons' pet peeves. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to be that if you weren't good enough to make it in the art world, 
you'd go into advertising, but now it's the other way around," Koons said, 
launching into one of his favorite raps. "Advertising is much more politically 
effective than art at this point. As to why I haven't gone into advertising, I 
try to incorporate the tools used in advertising and the entertainment industry 
in my work. Artists must incorporate these things, otherwise we'll become a 
completely impotent profession. And right now, art is impotent and totally 
non-threatening, and that's why it's commanding the prices we've been seeing 
lately. Its political statement is almost blank, so corporations can buy it 
without worrying that it will alter anything at all. Artists used to be the 
ones who knew how to manipulate, control and meet the needs of the masses, but 
we've lost our power. And I want to bring the power back." 
</P>
<P>
Exactly how a polychrome wood statue of Michael Jackson cuddling his pet 
chimpanzee (a Koons' work titled "Michael Jackson and Bubbles") is going to 
revitalize the avant-garde remains to be seen. Koons, however, explains his 
game plan thus; 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people have prenotions (sic) about what is good and what is bad, and 
my work operates in that area between good and bad. Consequently, it challenges 
their notions about things and hopefully will help them rethink the situation. 
</P>
<P>
"Beyond that, the statuary pieces are fake luxury and they make people feel 
economically secure when they look at them. The church has always insisted that 
artworks are for the glory of God, but they also fill the function of making 
people feel secure, and my objects function in a similar way. We work and 
sacrifice so that we can accumulate luxury objects which work as support 
systems for the individual. Our treasured objects fulfill our desires and 
express them." 
</P>
<P>
So, what sort of security-inducing objects might one find in Koons' home? 
</P>
<P>
"I live very simply and don't keep objects in my home," he sniffs disdainfully. 
"The dialogue of consumerism is not something I'm deeply involved with. I've 
been through it and have already digested it." 
</P>
<P>
Not a particularly Populist point of view, but then Koons is nothing if not a 
mass of contradictions. He is, however, at all times an astute businessman, and 
the theoretical fissures that run like a fault line through his work don't seem 
to faze the collectors who are currently converting the art world into a 
speculators' paradise. 
</P>
<P>
"Koons has been quite open about his abilities as a businessman and of course, 
that doesn't bother dealers or collectors at all," observes New Criterion 
editor Hilton Kramer. "They love dealing with artists who are businessmen 
because they talk the same language. Koons' work is about making money and I 
find it totally cynical. He's making an impact because, at the moment, there's 
a very low standard of taste in the art world. This presents a tremendous 
opportunity for people whose only way of making an impact is to lower the 
standard even further. As for his career longevity, I think he'll prosper until 
the next dip in the stock market." 
</P>
<P>
The New Yorker's Gopnik disagrees: "Koons may be a very unpleasant talent, but 
he's an interesting one and there's a gleam of true fanaticism about his work. 
He does what he does at full throttle, he's invented a language of his own and 
he's able to compose sentences in it. I don't agree with Koons as far as I can 
understand what his work is claiming, but if you take 20th Century art 
seriously, one of the things it teaches you is that you have to pay great 
attention to the disagreeable, the bizarre and offensive as a source of some 
kind of perverted wisdom. I think this is work in that tradition. That's not to 
say Koons is Michelangelo, but I don't think he's a charlatan either." 
</P>
<P>
Koons work may indeed have unplumbed depths, but it will be hard to tell until 
Koons begins to allow the work to speak for itself; at this point, his art is 
being upstaged by the sideshow of his career. Koons himself admits with 
uncharacteristic modesty that he doesn't have all the bugs out yet. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't reached greatness yet but I'm getting close," he said. "I'm a very 
good artist -- in fact, I'm the best hope for American art and have absolutely 
assumed the leadership of the art world. I've been given the opportunity by our 
culture to do something great and I want that opportunity -- I more than want 
it, I demand it. Like the people in advertising and entertainment, I'm willing 
to assume the responsibility of simultaneously meeting the needs and creating 
the needs. I desire leadership and I'm trying to help set a direction for 
people." 
</P>
<P>
What a sales pitch! In parting, one has to ask; how do you feel about the fact 
that you're often criticized for your slick sales skills? 
</P>
<P>
"I feel very good about my sales skills because everything is based on sales," 
he concludes with pride. "Sales is the front line and no matter what your 
problem or desire, there's a sales pitch designed for it. And if, in fact, your 
product is nothing more than pure salesmanship -- that is a fabulous product!"

MEGAMISTAKES 
</P>
<P>
Forecasting and the Myth of 
</P>
<P>
Rapid Technological Change 
</P>
<P>
by Steven P. Schnaars 
</P>
<P>
(Free Press: $19.95) 
</P>
<P>
 A 500-kilowatt nuclear power plant, maintained by regular passenger flights 
from Earth, starts operating on the moon in 1980. Vertical takeoff aircraft 
become as common as luxury cars by 1977. By 1984, newspapers are printed on 
home fax machines and by 1990, intelligent robot soldiers do most of the 
fighting. While as inaccurate as a Buck Rogers space opera, these predictions 
are actually from an ambitious TRW forecast in 1966 which consulted 27 top 
scientists about the products of the future that held the "vastest 
opportunities for business growth." Steven Schnaars, a marketing professor at 
New York's City University, delights in presenting these "mega-mistakes" as 
examples of how corporate soothsayers, mesmerized by the space program and 
space shows such as "Star Trek," became smitten with scientific-sounding 
marketing tools such as the "Delphi Technique," forgetting basic marketing laws 
in the process. 
</P>
<P>
Criticizing the elegant math models employed by forecasters for scouring the 
past "in search of obscure patterns" and "projecting glorious futures from the 
skimpiest of data," Schnaars recommends methods such as "scenario analysis," 
which encourage insight and creativity while requiring forecasters to indicate 
how you will get from here to there, "not just what it will look like when you 
arrive." Scenario analysis is the best way to interpret those special 
"confluences of social and cultural trends" that open up lucrative markets, 
Schnaars writes, pointing to the way Phillip Morris tobacco maintained sales in 
the 1960s by creating the "You've come a long way, baby" slogan, which 
anticipated growth in the women's movement. 
</P>
<P>
Schnaars isn't entirely fair to forecasters such as those at TRW, for some bad 
investments which he attributes to poor cost analysis (such as vertical 
take-off planes) actually failed because of technological problems that can't 
be anticipated by his classic marketing methods. Overall, though, this is an 
insightful, cautionary book, contending that consumers are not likely to change 
their marketing habits overnight, however impressive an innovation might be.

BORDERLAND 
</P>
<P>
Origins of the American 
</P>
<P>
Suburb, 1820-1939 
</P>
<P>
by John R. Stilgoe 
</P>
<P>
(Yale: $35) 
</P>
<P>
 Depicting the Pony Express, Great Frontier and covered wagons as symbols of a 
courageous, enterprising era, American history books now take considerable 
pride in the fact that our nation conquered a continent in a century. The 
"conquerors" themselves hardly basked in the glow of admiration, however, for 
as this unusual social history suggests, many 19th and early 20th Century 
writers viewed the retreat from Eastern cities as a virtual abandonment of 
European civilization. "Americans teach their children that the come-outers 
sought religious freedom, safety from tyranny, refuge from military 
conscription, and above all, the opportunity to better themselves and their 
children," writes John Stilgoe, a landscape historian at Harvard. "Of the other 
point of view, the one still presented around tavern and cantina tables across 
Europe, schoolbooks and national mythology speak nothing." Were the early 
settlers "lazy, cowardly or quitters?" Did the movement into "backwoods America 
turn the European into a barbarian," as Lewis Mumford wrote? 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Stilgoe is less interested in ponderously answering these 
questions than in quietly reflecting on how early attitudes toward suburb and 
city reflected our nation's changing conceptions of the good and civilized 
life. From ancient times until the early 18th Century, Stilgoe writes, suburbs 
referred to inhabited land immediately below hilltop walled towns. "Dependent, 
forlorn and prey to brigands and attacking armies," suburbanites craved 
security and order and struggled to gain entrance into the city. Now, of 
course, as "urban downtowns . . . screech in their shabbiness," suburban life 
has become a dream of happiness that inspires many urban dwellers "to work, to 
save, to get out of cities they perceive as chaotic, inimical to childhood joy, 
unnaturally paced, incredibly polluted, and just too crowded." Explaining this 
change, Stilgoe surveys an impressively wide range of social and cultural 
trends, from cholera epidemics in overcrowded cities to world war: At a time 
when the enemy no longer charged up the hill, but attacked from the sky, dense 
urban areas suddenly seemed frighteningly fragile. 
</P>
<P>
What's most striking about "Borderland" is how representative these early 
suburban settlers are of today's Americans. As Stilgoe writes, the borderland 
landscape endures as "a sort of attic in the national superstructure, a place 
of calm, a place of older things, a height to visit when downstairs all is 
commotion, all noisy busyness."

America and the Caribbean 
</P>
<P>

(Pantheon: $9.95) 
</P>
<P>
 One might well question the utility of the many books published in recent 
years about America's interventions in the affairs of its southern neighbors, 
for these books tend to reach those who know the most about the region. 
Meanwhile, the majority of Americans remain happily oblivious: In a New York 
Times-CBS News poll conducted after Oliver North's appearance before the 1987 
Congressional Iran-Contra hearings, only 32% of respondents could locate 
Nicaragua as part of Central or Latin America; 48% either had no idea or placed 
it near countries such as Iran and Iraq. And yet, while books about Latin 
America cannot hope to reach this apathetic majority, a few, such as George 
Black's concise and convincing "The Good Neighbor," can do more than preach to 
the converted. Eschewing liberal rhetoric, creating a balanced, compelling 
narrative and supporting his assertions with quotes from Reagan Administration 
officials, Black is likely to attract readers who are uninformed less out of 
apathy than a deep skepticism toward those lugging ideological baggage. 
</P>
<P>
While the subtitle suggests that this is primarily a study of how the Reagan 
Administration manipulated the news, "The Good Neighbor" is in essence a 
concise, well-informed revisionist history that illustrates how successive 
administrations have been careless with the facts. What keeps "The Good 
Neighbor" from being yet another rag-tag collection of Reagan era gaffes is 
Black's focus on how conservative propagandists have played on deeply-rooted 
American fears. Black's psychoanalytic approach will offend some readers for 
its implicit condescension and its tendency to dismiss some legitimate security 
concerns, such as anxiety about the Cuban missile crisis, as irrational 
"fears." Black's liberal perspective also colors his prose at times; he 
criticizes the networks for covering the 1982 El Salvadoran elections, for 
example, while castigating them for not covering the 1984 elections in 
Nicaragua. Overall, though, Black has composed an impressivelly well-informed 
overview of how emotional rather than strategic considerations have governed 
U.S. policy toward its southern neighbors.

The Memoirs of Juan Goytisolo 
</P>
<P>
1931-1956 
</P>
<P>
(North Point Press: $18.95) 
</P>
<P>
 What makes Juan Goytisolo so intriguing is his constant striving to avoid the 
conventional. For Goytisolo, becoming a creature of custom rather than an 
"authentic individual" means more than losing the creative spark. He sees the 
day-to-day routines that attempt to seduce us all as a kind of spiritual 
extinction and writes out of a "determination to fight tooth and claw against 
oblivion . . . to capture the precious gift of life." Goytisolo's rebellion 
against convention grew intense as he matured in Barcelona in a family that 
cheered the arrival of Franco even though Goytisolo's mother had been killed by 
a Nationalist bomb in 1936. Goytisolo describes his escape from "tribal norms . 
. . that disguised the truth" in these pages, but while he now lives in Paris, 
it is clear that he remains, by careful choice, in a limbo between cultures. It 
is the same limbo reflected in Goytisolo's surrealistic novels, from "Count 
Julian," whose Spanish narrator dreams of a new Muslim invasion of his 
homeland, to "Landscapes After the Battle," whose narrator lives in a Paris 
district, where blond Turks brush shoulders with Portuguese concierges and 
Jewish merchants from North Africa.

<P>
GUITARIST REID AND HIS BAND WANT TO BREAK THE COLOR BARRIER WIDE OPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"If I were white where would I be now?" mused Vernon Reid, sitting on the 
disheveled bed of his West Hollywood hotel room, idly strumming his guitar. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe nowhere -- or maybe on top of the world, the rock world, looking down. I 
can't deny that in some sense that would be nice -- ultimately for all black 
musicians. And for my ego -- it would be a nice little buzz too." 
</P>
<P>
Reid -- intelligent, commanding and candid -- plucked a few more bars of a 
familiar melody on his guitar. "Don't get me wrong," he said. "I don't want to 
be white. Some black people may dream about that but I don't. That's foolish 
thinking. I'm just looking for a fair shake. I've been confronting this brick 
wall too long." 
</P>
<P>
The wall, though, may be crumbling. 
</P>
<P>
Rock has always been a haven for white musicians. Most blacks, figuring it's 
too tough to break into that exclusive club, avoid it. But Reid, 30, has been 
tenaciously looking for a break in rock since the end of the last decade. He 
even helped form the Black Rock Coalition, a New York organization that has 
been chipping away at the iron-clad stereotype of the white rock musician. 
</P>
<P>
But it looks like Reid, with his band Living Colour, finally has his 
breakthrough album -- Epic Records' "Vivid," the best black-rock effort since 
Prince's "Purple Rain" in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
It's not what you would call an overnight success. "Vivid" has been struggling 
to find an audience since April. Critical acclaim has helped keep it alive. So 
has the attention-getting Mick Jagger connection -- he produced the cuts 
"Glamour Boys" and the stinging "Which Way to America?" So has Reid's ferocious 
fight -- waged in interviews in the nation's magazines and newspapers -- 
against racism in rock. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rooted in Black Music 
</P>
<P>
"I've been on my soapbox," Reid said with a chuckle. "I've been trying to raise 
people's consciousness. I want them to find a new way to think about rock 
musicians. It doesn't have to be some blue-eyed guy with long, blond hair 
playing it. It can be somebody who looks like me." 
</P>
<P>
One of Reid's main points is the paradox of rock being considered white music. 
Rock music, of course, has black roots -- mainly blues but some soul. "I think 
a lot of kids don't realize this," Reid said. "If they did, they might think a 
black rock musician isn't so surprising." 
</P>
<P>
Living Colour also features singer Corey Glover, bassist Muzz Skillings and 
drummer William Calhoun. By the end of last year, the band's "Vivid" album had 
sold about 375,000. 
</P>
<P>
Buoyed by the single, "Cult of Personality," it's lately been bounding up the 
pop chart, up to No. 52 this week. Not an impressive chart position for the 
average album -- but a veritable triumph for a black rock album by an unknown 
band. 
</P>
<P>
No amount of publicity would matter if the album weren't any good. But this one 
really is outstanding. Apparently as more people hear it, the album is 
succeeding on merit. 
</P>
<P>
Glover, basically an R&amp;B belter, can crank up his voice and growl and 
screech with the best rock singers. Reid, who is considered by many to be the 
best black guitarist since Jimi Hendrix, fuels the band's music with his 
furious, explosive runs that have the buzz-saw textures of the best rock-guitar 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
Living Colour's music isn't straight rock. It's colorfully fused with funk and 
metal and spiced with strains of avant-garde jazz. Some of the songs, mostly 
written by Reid, are angry ("Funny Vibe" features the rap group Public Enemy). 
</P>
<P>
There's even savage social commentary ("Open Letter to a Landlord"). But the 
band wisely sidesteps esoterica. All the songs are neatly structured around 
appealing pop hooks. This is very much commercial rock. 
</P>
<P>
Radio has been the root of Living Colour's problem. For a long time, album rock 
radio wasn't interested. Other black rockers, like the highly publicized Bus 
Boys, also were largely ignored by radio. In the history of rock, only a 
handful of musicians -- notably Hendrix and Sly Stone in the '60s and George 
Clinton with his '70s P-Funk band -- have hurdled rock's color barrier. 
</P>
<P>
In this decade, the success of Prince's albums and Michael Jackson's rock 
singles -- "Beat it" and "State of Shock" (a duet with Mick Jagger) -- has 
neither opened up radio to black rockers nor inspired the formation of waves of 
black rock groups. 
</P>
<P>
But radio isn't the only problem faced by black rockers. Record companies, 
knowing how hard it is to get records by such artists played on radio, usually 
don't sign them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jagger's Endorsement 
</P>
<P>
Being a black band and a new band is a double whammy, Reid said: "It's tough 
for any new band to get air play. If we were a new, white rock band we'd 
probably have trouble getting our record on the air. But being black makes it 
much tougher. Radio isn't inclined to play black rock bands and record 
companies aren't inclined to sign them." 
</P>
<P>
Born to West Indian parents in London but raised in Brooklyn, Reid was kicking 
around New York for years, bouncing from band to band -- notably hard-edged 
jazz-rock experimenters the Decoding Society, the Contortions and Defunkt -- 
before forming Living Colour in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
After Reid played on Mick Jagger's "Primitive Cool" album, Jagger, enthused 
about Living Colour, produced two demonstration cuts which were instrumental in 
convincing Epic to sign the band. 
</P>
<P>
"But getting a deal wasn't an automatic thing, even with Mick Jagger's name as 
producer on those tracks," Reid said. "It helped that we're a good band. But we 
had to be real good -- better than a white rock band has to be -- to convince 
them to gamble on us." 
</P>
<P>
Reid became a guitarist by default. He wanted to play flute but didn't have 
access to one. But, at 15, a cousin gave him a guitar instead. "Having an 
instrument, any instrument, made me happy then. That old guitar was hard for me 
to learn to play. It had heavy strings and I had weak hands at the time. I even 
stopped playing for a while but I picked it up again. I was determined it 
wouldn't defeat me." 
</P>
<P>
Later Reid improved his skills by studying with two jazz guitarists but still 
gravitated toward rock. "I was influenced by people like Carlos Santana," he 
said. "I realized you could play rock and not be white, and bring your own 
ethnic feeling to the music. I grew up listening to Sly Stone and Jimi Hendrix. 
They were inspirations. 
</P>
<P>
"I had this vision of playing the powerful, rock-oriented music, of being this 
strong, solid musician who could play whatever he wanted -- even this kind of 
music that black musicians hardly ever played. I knew what I wanted and I went 
after it." 
</P>
<P>
Playing guitar, Reid said, isn't just an artistic endeavor or a way to make a 
living. It's also an outlet for his rage: 
</P>
<P>
"If you're black you have some rage in you. It may be buried deep in some 
people but it's there. Playing music has helped me deal with my anger at the 
position of blacks in this country and the position of black rock musicians in 
the music business. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel violent and I don't want to kill anybody or hurt anybody. But 
I've just been so frustrated. I don't lash out. I don't get crazy thinking 
about the problems of blacks in this country. I just play the guitar. I get a 
lot of it out that way."

By Kirsten Grimstad, Grimstad was, for three years, executive editor of 
Chrysalis, a Magazine of Women's Culture.

<TEXT>
<P>
In England, Eva Figes is regarded as a literary descendant of Virginia Woolf 
for her insistance on the inner world as the special province of the novel and 
for her ability to render that world in precisely calibrated and luminous 
lyrical imagery. The author of eight novels, she is arguably best known for her 
nonfiction work, "Patriarchal Attitudes," published in 1970, a vintage feminist 
classic in which she re-examined the ideas of major Western thinkers to expose 
their underlying view of woman as the projection of men's fears and desires. 
She concluded, "It is to this mirror image that woman has had to comply." 
</P>
<P>
What is a woman's identity apart from these projections? This question lies at 
the heart of "Nelly's Version," a novel originally published in Britain in 
1977, now reissued in tandem with "Ghosts," the author's new novel. The central 
character is a middle-aged woman suffering from amnesia. As the story begins, 
she finds herself checking into a strange hotel in a strange town under an 
assumed name with a suitcase full of bank notes. She imagines herself to be an 
accomplice in some sort of secret plot; she awaits a cue that will reveal her 
role in the unfolding of a thriller. 
</P>
<P>
The first sight of herself in a mirror is a shock. At first she thinks a 
stranger is in the room with her. Then it dawns. "I'll have to put up with you, 
won't I? Somehow." The image in the mirror does not reply. "I suspected her of 
being one of those women who had quietly put up with many things without 
answering back, so that it had become a lifelong habit." 
</P>
<P>
Although she avoids mirrors from that point on, at the hair- dresser she is 
again forced to confront "the stranger, this alien and unlikely female" that is 
her self. There, watching the alien self silently submit to unwelcome preening 
and grooming, she feels contempt. "I would never grow to like her. But we were 
stuck with each other now, like two inseparable sisters. One timid, the other 
hard and rebellious." Eventually strangers in the form of husband and son -- 
both of them obnoxious and uncaring -- lay claim to the timid sister while the 
hard rebellious sister turns incendiary. 
</P>
<P>
The author's attempt to weave a solipsistic fictional world into the warp of 
the mind of a profoundly alienated amnesiac is daring and skilled. Here a spark 
of consciousness of what we must assume to be the narrator's true self forms in 
the vacuum of a mind cut off from all memory, personal ties, and feeling. 
Nothing is sacred as savagely funny scenes unfold between the narrator and 
those claming to be her nearest of kin, for whom she has not a single shred of 
feeling. The question of the narrator's real identity haunts the narrative from 
beginning to end, where we are left wondering whether her amnesia was willed 
unconsciously as a device to liberate her true, hard, rebellious self from the 
mirror image of the compliant alien other self. 
</P>
<P>
"Ghosts" is a fitting companion for the earlier novel because it, too, 
experiments with the frontiers of fiction in addressing the theme of the 
obliteration of the past. The narrator, also middle-aged and female, meditates 
on the passage of time, her own transit into old age, and the loss of 
everything caught up in the maelstrom of disintegration and renewal. While the 
mood of "Nelly's Vision" was wicked, here it is melancholy. 
</P>
<P>
The four seasons provide the structural divisions and backdrop for her thoughts 
and memories of her own childhood and youth, her children's childhood now past, 
her deceased father and mentally vacant mother, her dying friend and the secret 
love she once shared with that friend's husband. Saturated images of nature 
vividly convey our relentlessly changing world where life flows absently away 
along with the spring rain washing through the gutters. In these images of 
flowing water we sense the ghost of Heraclitus, the Greek philosopher who 
articulated this modernist sensibility of ceaseless change a mere 2,500 years 
ago in his famous maxim: "You cannot step twice into the same river." 
</P>
<P>
Modern forces of development are now accelerating the pace set by nature. The 
flow of traffic, the movement of people in the train station underscore the 
fleetingness of the moment. Streets are widened and billboards posted where 
once a row of shops used to stand. An old woman loses her flower shop and now 
wanders, homeless, with plastic bags wrapped around her feet, her tracks fading 
with the falling snow just as her memory too will be effaced with time. 
</P>
<P>
The patterns of continuity do not offer comfort to the narrator. In the typical 
way that her son twists his foot, she sees the ghost of her lost father, not 
the ongoing presence of his spirit. In archetypally recurring events, there is 
also no comfort. While others are absorbed in the annual celebration of the 
Christmas pageant, the narrator has her eyes on the exit, almost in the manner 
of a Holocaust survivor for whom the experiences of loss and escape are 
inextricably united. 
</P>
<P>
The only force opposing the suction of time and change seems to reside in the 
created work itself, in the carefully measured prose and in poetic images that 
capture and evoke the passing moment, the individual, the feeling. In this 
prose poem of a novel, the beautiful cadence and imagery of the language itself 
seem to reverse the rush to oblivion pictured in its words.

JACK SMITH ON SUNDAY: GRAY EXPECTATIONS; 
</P>
<P>
POST-BABY BOOM, WE'RE READY, PERHAPS, FOR A LITTLE MORE MATURITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH

<TEXT>
<P>
AS A SENIOR citizen, I don't know whether I'm more pleased or dismayed by the 
increasing numbers of my fellow seniors. 
</P>
<P>
According to a report from the Institute for Philosophy and Public Policy of 
the University of Maryland, Americans over age 65 have increased eightfold 
since the turn of the century. Their proportion of the population has tripled. 
Those over 85 (the fastest-growing group in the country) are 21 times more 
numerous than in 1900. 
</P>
<P>
Two facts explain this startling change: (1) A decrease in the number of 
children. (2) Improved medical care and declining death rates for the elderly. 
Between 1960 and 1980, the number of people 65 or older grew by 54%. 
</P>
<P>
"America's elderly," the report says, "are now facing a population explosion, 
demographers warn, greater than that of the population of India." 
</P>
<P>
This alarming phenomenon is given the rather euphemistic title of "The Graying 
of America." Certainly there does not seem, at first glance, to be any threat 
in the prospect of a grayer America. Having just survived the Baby Boom, 
perhaps we are ready for a little more maturity. 
</P>
<P>
However, I can't help thinking of the gloomy side. Since most of these elders 
will be gone from the workplace, somebody is going to have to pay their bills 
and, in the end, bury them. 
</P>
<P>
With so many people living to be 85, the undertaker's harvest may be deferred, 
but in the end he will prosper. If you're over 85 you're probably not going to 
live 20 years more. 
</P>
<P>
I am reminded of the nonagenarian who was told by his stockbroker that if he 
were to invest in certain bonds, he would certainly double his savings in a few 
years. The old gentleman replied that at his age he didn't even buy green 
bananas. 
</P>
<P>
The funeral business has undoubtedly undergone some reform since Jessica 
Mitford wrote "The American Way of Death" in 1963. Nevertheless, like 
everything else these days, dying costs more than it used to. 
</P>
<P>
Lynne Drain of Sierra Madre writes that she was discussing the subject recently 
with her 89-year-old grandfather. He said that when his father died in 1910, 
his mother bought a burial plot for all six family members for $125, and he 
still had the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Drain's grandfather also had the bill for his father's burial. It was made out 
to Ann Hansberger for the burial of her husband, Constant Hansberger. 
</P>
<P>
The bill totalled $142.15 and was itemized as follows: 
</P>
<P>
Removing remains from St. John's Hospital, $2; embalming, $10; shaving, $2; 
candles and candelabra, $5; death notice in paper, $1; pedestals and rug, $2; 
underclothing, 65 cents; black casket, handles and plate, $65; outside box, $5; 
box taken to cemetery, $1.50; single grave, $15; low Mass, $10; hearse, $8; 
three coaches, $15. 
</P>
<P>
Drain's grandfather remembers that the hearse and each of the coaches was 
pulled by two horses, which made it a grand funeral, indeed. 
</P>
<P>
This bill was duly signed to acknowledge payment. 
</P>
<P>
The two items that interest me most are "shaving, $2" and "underclothing, 65 
cents." Considering the reasonable cost of all the other items, $2 seems a lot 
to pay for a shave. Wasn't that old saying, "shave and a haircut, six bits," in 
vogue at about that time? 
</P>
<P>
As for the underwear, didn't Constant Hansberger's wife furnish the undertaker 
with some of his own underwear? Or didn't he wear underwear? Some men don't. 
Clark Gable didn't wear an undershirt in "It Happened One Night," a lapse that 
outraged the underwear manufacturers of the nation. Evidently, in any case, the 
undertaker thought it proper that the deceased be clothed in underwear and 
provided it, at a cost. Certainly, a man whose casket is to ride in a hearse 
pulled by two horses, followed by three coaches and teams, ought to be wearing 
underwear. 
</P>
<P>
At today's prices, our Social Security checks are not likely to cover our last 
rites; so it behooves the elderly to lay away enough money so that their 
children will be spared that final expense. And we ought to have a set of 
underwear put aside. 
</P>
<P>
As for that last shave, though, I think it ought to be on the house. 
</P>
<P>
By the way, I eat bananas daily for the potassium; my wife buys them green.

STORYTELLERS: NEW IN FEBRUARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON G. CAMPBELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the good St. Valentine himself would have been the first to admit: "The 
course of true love never did run smooth." And the popular fiction outpouring 
for February underlines it with affairs of the heart ranging from the merely 
turbulent to the erotic to the mismatched to the bizarre to the far-fetched. 
</P>
<P>
In Michael Korda's The Fortune, for instance, we are faced with an ages-old 
conundrum: Can an attractive, savvy young New York art dealer find love in the 
arms of a man old enough to be her grandfather -- and who also happens to 
control a family fortune running into the billions? So, hey! Why not? Bulging 
pecs aren't everything! Korda, the editor-in-chief of Simon &amp; Schuster and 
the author of four previous nonfiction books as well as two novels, "Worldly 
Goods" and "Queenie," has great fun with the affair between crazy-like-a-fox 
Elizabeth Alexandra Walden and the reclusive billionaire, Arthur Alden 
Bannerman. 
</P>
<P>
Rightfully, Korda goes to considerable pain to probe the nature of the 
blossoming relationship between them. A casual roll in the hay between an 
opportunistic young woman and a slavering derriere-pincher, this is not. But, 
when Bannerman -- defying his brooding and dangerous family and especially his 
mother, the steel-would-melt-in-her-mouth matriarch of the Bannerman clan, 
Eleanor -- actually marries Alexa and wills her, not simply a few million in 
worldly goods for a job well done, but the whole kit and caboodle of the 
Bannerman fortune, there's unabashed heck to pay. And especially when Arthur 
has the bad form to die in his new bride's arms in the marriage bed. 
</P>
<P>
Menacingly, the Bannermans and their attorneys begin circling the hapless Alexa 
like a covey of mating ospreys, and this would appear to be the biggest 
mismatch since Custer chose to take on the Sioux nation. But, stay tuned. Our 
girl has a keen instinct for the jugular, herself and a few knuckle-ball tricks 
as well. "The Fortune" is a main selection of the Literary Guild and has been 
sold to ABC-TV for a four-part miniseries. 
</P>
<P>
Love, in the lexicon of martial-arts guru author, Eric Van Lustbader, is as 
physical as the lethal clashes between his protagonist and the black-hearted 
villains that populate the pages of French Kiss. The body count here is 
awesome, and, by Page 30, one has lost track of how many hapless players have 
succumbed to the deadly iron war fan, the gunsen, a sort of portable guillotine 
blade, and to other fatal variations of pentjak-silat, or anatomical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Here we have up-and-coming New York attorney, Chris Haye, seeking to unravel 
the murder, in southern France, of his brother, Terry -- an early, gunsen 
decapitation victim -- and Terry's obsession with obtaining a trio of jade 
weapons known as the Prey Dauw, or the Forest of Swords. Seemingly ugly truths 
about his dead brother begin emerging -- notably, Chris learns, that whoever 
possesses the mystic Forest of Swords also controls all of the opium warlords 
operating out of Burma. 
</P>
<P>
And who, exactly, is "The Magician," the evil engineer of all of the related 
murders? Van Lustbader has honed the brooding, goose-bumply sensation of 
sudden, violent death likely to burst out of the darkness at any moment into a 
unique art form. And in "French Kiss" he is in fine fettle with a suspense that 
is sustained to the final page. 
</P>
<P>
Despite an old pledge to our mother that we would never read a novel populated 
by a heroine of heart-stopping beauty bearing a name like Flame, or a darkly 
handsome, charismatic, hero bearing a name like Chance, we did it, anyway. 
Mother had a good point. Janet Dailey's Rivals is a love story of the stripe 
where the lovers-to-be -- catching sight of each other across a crowded room -- 
exchange a look of such searing intensity that, along with their clothes, it 
also peels the lamination right off their respective driver's licenses. 
</P>
<P>
Chance controls a global real estate empire. Flame is a dynamic advertising 
executive. Boy meets girl. Boy beds and marries girl. A shocking truth during 
their idyllic Mexican honeymoon -- Flame is the sole heir to an Oklahoma ranch, 
the possession of which Chance desperately needs for a multi-million-dollar 
land deal. Worse yet, they are the surviving members of two feuding Oklahoma 
families -- a bitter vendetta that goes back to the Oklahoma land rush of 1891. 
</P>
<P>
Did Chance rush her into marriage simply to claim the land? Does Flame have the 
driving ambition, and finances, to beat her estranged lover at his own game? 
Are these feckless kids going to see the self-destructiveness of what they're 
doing? Is this an FHA-approved real estate development in the first place? 
</P>
<P>
Not only have the first serial rights to "Rivals" been sold to Cosmopolitan 
magazine, but it is a Literary Guild Main Selection. So cool it, Mother. 
</P>
<P>
In Dean R. Koontz's blood-chilling Midnight, a late-night jogger along the 
beach at Moonlight Cove in Northern California becomes suddenly aware that she 
is not alone. Somebody . . . some thing . . . keening, panting and alternately 
running upright and then silently on all fours . . . is joined by another and 
then another and the circling closes in. And the eerie mood of this creepy, 
crawly novel of the supernatural is vividly etched. What evil force is abroad 
in this otherwise idyllic coastal town? Tessa Lockland, suspicious of her 
sister's unprompted suicide, wants to know, and so does Sam Booker, an 
undercover Federal agent investigating a string of equally suspicious deaths. 
And so does veteran, wheelchair-ridden Harry Talbot, whose tip to the FBI 
brought Booker to Moonlight Cove in the first place. And throw in for good 
measure the razor-sharp, 11-year-old Chrissie Foster, an irrepressible charmer 
with literary aspirations -- and with a particular interest in the strange 
forces that are warping her home town since she is a principal target of them. 
</P>
<P>
"Midnight," follows on the heels of Koontz's earlier works in the genre of the 
macabre-thriller such as "Strangers," "Watchers" and "Lightning." While there 
are overtones in "Midnight," of both "The Invasion of the Body-Snatchers" and 
"The Stepford Wives," Koontz plows new, and even more chilling ground, in this 
gripping story of a little town at the mercy of a high-tech evil spirit. You 
put the book down at your own risk. The minute you do there could be a muffled 
rustling and a soft whinnying sound behind your chair.

A CHIP ON HER SHOULDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Why bother having Cynthia Parsons review former Secretary of Education William 
Bennett's "Back to Moral Basics" (Book Review, Dec. 25)? From the first to the 
last, her grousing reveals a consuming chip on her shoulder. Her readers 
receive hardly a glimpse of what the book is about, just how greatly Parsons 
disdains it and how quickly she dismisses it as so much conservative palavra. 
</P>
<P>
 Parsons derides Bennett for using the first person often in these speeches 
delivered when he was the head of the Department of Education (how dare he!) -- 
all while she interjects a personal anecdote and her own clairvoyant 
assessments of Bennett's motives for writing the book in the first place. 
That's consistent. 
</P>
<P>
Parsons states, "If . . . this is some 'last hurrah,' then only friends and 
fellow-believers need spend the time to read this volume." In other words, if 
you like Bennett, you'll like this book; if not, not. What does this review 
tell us except that Parsons belonged to the latter group -- before and after 
she read the book.

By Ivan Strenski, Strenski is American editor of the journal Religion (Academic 
Press) and author of Four Theories of Myth in Twentieth Century History 
(Macmillan and Iowa).

<TEXT>
<P>
Author of scores of learned books and articles; prolific journalist, novelist 
and short-story writer; founder of two academic journals; editor of the 
"Encyclopedia of Religion"; cultural, political and religious visionary in his 
native Romania; celebrated professor at the University of Chicago; the most 
influential voice in the study of religion in the United States -- and perhaps 
the world -- for at least a generation, Mircea Eliade died in 1986 at age 79. 
Because he insisted on the reality of humanity's experience of the 
transcendent, Eliade rubbed against the grain of secular sensibilities. This 
gentle man affirmed those often revolutionary claims of great prophets and 
mystics: "History" was conditioned by the non-historic; meaningless everyday 
time was awash in a timeless time of cosmic significance. A historian of 
religion, he studied historical claims of encounters beyond history; in doing 
so, he tried to make the sacred real in an age that he believed suppressed it. 
A novelist, he sought to evoke this saving sense of the sacred by mastery of a 
literary art that hid eternity behind the mask of mere becoming, offering 
itself to those blessed with eyes willing to see. 
</P>
<P>
In normal times, Eliade's achievements would be judged remarkable. But in 
Eliade's "Autobiography" we learn the miraculous ways they were won against 
scarcely imaginable hardships visited by the "terror of history" -- the wartime 
slaughter of countless loved ones, perilous political persecution and 
internment, the cancer death of his first wife, refugee flight and 
resettlement, followed by years of chronic, humiliating poverty, and sometimes 
just palpable physical hunger. But discovered behind the profanity of these 
evils is the regular grace of loving friends -- the offer of small academic 
jobs, rent money, membership in the charmed circle of a learned society, or 
just a simple place to work. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes Eliade even sees cosmic providence in the disruptions that have 
plagued his life. In 1940, Hitler's Rohmputsch was replayed in Bucharest. Gen. 
Antonescu's "party of order," the fascist National Legionary State, triumphed 
and forced Eliade and other more "spiritual" radicals associated with 
Codreanu's adventurist Legion of the Archangel Michael, off the high road of 
history. Codreanu's right-wing political and religious revolution, defended to 
our day by Eliade in his autobiography, was effectively liquidated. Many 
legionnaires were killed; others, like Eliade, whether overt members or mere 
suspects, were imprisoned. Yet getting thrown off the Romanian political track 
only spurred Eliade to universalize his revolutionary ambitions. On the plane 
of international academic life, Eliade became a kind of prophet of the 
trans-historical, hiding within historical documents. A true cultural 
revolutionary to the end, Eliade challenged the whole secular bourgeois world's 
comforting belief in the adequacy of its own works of science, politics and 
economics. 
</P>
<P>
But, worthy ambition or not, Eliade decided to shut us out of his 1930s mind. 
Eliade's account of his (at least) profound sympathy for the political and 
cultural revolution of Codreanu's Legion is rife with equivocation, leaving us 
ignorant of the meaning of this vital phase of his life. Eliade persistently 
distinguishes Codreanu's Legion from so-called "political" movements; the Iron 
Guard is "ethical and religious." Yet Eliade must know that for Codreanu's 
Legion, the distinction between "politics" and "religion" is one without a 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
Eliade tells us of the legion's electoral triumphs. Not "political?" Likewise 
Eliade confounds the balance of historical judgment by representing the 
latter-day Iron Guard as embarked on "the path of nonviolence" and as urging 
"passive resistance." Yet about the years of the legion's bully-boy 
anti-Semitism, Eliade is totally silent. As for his own involvement, Eliade is 
equally unclear: he refused to dissociate himself from the legion, first 
because he says he was not a "political man," but then -- confusingly a few 
pages on -- because it was "unacceptable" and "absurd" to do so, because he 
could not conceive of dissociating himself from the "new generation" while it 
was being "unjustly" persecuted. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, readers with an eye for history or for certain questions about the 
precise meaning of Eliade's political beliefs in the Romania of the 1930s will 
be left with questions unanswered. Whatever the real truth is about what Eliade 
calls his "imprudent acts and errors committed in youth," he has carried them 
to his grave.

WHAT TO DO WHEN ANXIETY CRIPPLES YOU

From the book Information Anxiety by Richard Saul Wurman. Copyright 1989 by 
Richard Saul Wurman, to be published by Doubleday in February.

ONCE, PHONE service came from a single company, computers were used only by 
rocket scientists and watching television meant choosing one of three major 
networks. Today, the information assault is on. There are 125 long-distance 
phone companies in California alone. Computers have revolutionized everything 
from hand-held calculators to household appliances. And 1,388 TV stations crowd 
the airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
Want just the facts? If you went to the Library of Congress and looked at one 
book, manuscript or other library resource each minute eight hours a day, five 
days a week, it would take you more than 688 years to see all 85,895,835 items. 
(That's up from 59,890,533 in 1969.) The size of the average American newspaper 
has more than doubled since 1970 to 91 pages, and we spend 45 minutes a day 
reading it -- though that is just 10 minutes more than a decade ago. The 
average Sunday paper in 1970 had 145 pages; in 1986 it had 351. 
</P>
<P>
Even convenience is increasingly complicated. One videocassette recorder -- 
with 35 buttons on its remote control -- takes salespeople about 45 minutes per 
customer to explain. The instruction manual is 35 pages thick. Little wonder, 
then, that a Circuit City salesman in Torrance says 20% of the 50 VCRs the 
store sells every day are eventually returned by people who can't figure them 
out. 
</P>

Richard Saul Wurman, developer of the Access guides, including "L.A. Access," 
and creator of the "Smart" Yellow Pages, specializes in making information of 
all kinds easy to find, use and digest. In this preview of his book, 
"Information Anxiety," he describes symptoms of the malady of the Information 
Age, and ways to keep from drowning in the data stream. 
</P>
<P>
Illustrated by J. T. Steiny 
</P>
<P>
THE DEFINITION 
</P>
<P>
INFORMATION ANXIETY is produced by the ever-widening gap between what we 
understand and what we think we should understand. Information anxiety is the 
black hole between data and knowledge. It happens when information doesn't tell 
us what we want or need to know. 
</P>
<P>
Our relationship to information isn't the only source of information anxiety. 
We are also made anxious by the fact that our access to information is often 
controlled by other people. We are dependent on those who design information, 
on the news editors and producers who decide what news we will receive, and by 
decision makers in the public and private sector who can restrict the flow of 
information. We are also made anxious by other people's expectations of what we 
should know, be they company presidents, peers or even parents. 
</P>
<P>
Almost everyone suffers from information anxiety to some degree. We read 
without comprehending, see without perceiving, hear without listening. It can 
be experienced as moments of frustration with a manual that refuses to divulge 
the secret to operating a videocassette recorder or a map that bears no 
relation to reality. It can happen at a cocktail party when someone mentions 
the name Allan Bloom and the only person you know by that name is your dentist. 
It can also be manifest as a chronic malaise, a pervasive fear that we are 
about to be overwhelmed by the very material we need to master to function in 
this world. 
</P>
<P>
TELLTALE SIGNS 
</P>
<P>
IF THE "In" basket in your office casts a shadow like Annapurna over your desk 
and the mere mention of the word information makes you cringe and moan, chances 
are that you're suffering from information anxiety. But if you're not sure, the 
following behaviors are indications that dealing with information might be a 
problem in your life. 
</P>
<P>
Chronically talking about not keeping up with what's going on around you. 
</P>
<P>
Feeling guilty about that ever-higher stack of periodicals waiting to be read. 
</P>
<P>
Nodding your head knowingly when someone mentions a book, an artist or a news 
story that you have never heard of before. 
</P>
<P>
Finding that you are unable to explain something that you thought you 
understood. 
</P>
<P>
Blaming yourself for not being able to follow the instructions for putting a 
bike together. 
</P>
<P>
Refusing to buy a new appliance or piece of equipment because you are afraid 
you won't be able to operate it. 
</P>
<P>
Feeling depressed because you don't know what all of the buttons on your VCR 
are for. 
</P>
<P>
Buying high-tech electronics because you feel that, through osmosis, you'll 
become more technologically knowledgeable. 
</P>
<P>
Calling "The Society of Mind" "prophetic" even though you couldn't even 
understand the book review of it, which is all you read. 
</P>
<P>
Looking down at your digital watch to jot down the exact time in an office 
building logbook even though you know that no one really cares. 
</P>
<P>
Giving time and attention to news that has no cultural, economic or scientific 
effect on your life. 
</P>
<P>
Filling out a form and feeling compelled to fill in every blank. 
</P>
<P>
Reacting emotionally to information that you don't really understand -- like 
not knowing what the Dow Jones is but panicking when you hear that it has 
dropped 500 points. 
</P>
<P>
Thinking that the person next to you understands everything you don't. 
</P>
<P>
Being too afraid or too embarrassed to say, "I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Or worse, calling something information that you don't understand. 
</P>
<P>
We are bombarded with material from the media, from colleagues and from 
cocktail party conversation, all of which is delivered in the form of what we 
have been taught to think of as information. We are like a thirsty person who 
has been condemned to use a thimble to drink from a fire hydrant. The sheer 
volume of available information and the manner in which it is often delivered 
render much of it useless. 
</P>
<P>
THE DISEASES 
</P>
<P>
THE FOLLOWING are misnomers, myths and diseases that litter the information 
field. Unless you are aware of them, they will sabotage understanding. They 
afflict our ability to see things we have always seen but have never really 
seen. They obscure our path to learning. But by recognizing them, we can disarm 
their potential to mislead us. 
</P>
<P>
The disease of familiarity. Familiarity breeds confusion. Those afflicted are 
the experts in the world who, so bogged down by their own knowledge, regularly 
miss the key points as they try to explain what they know. You ask them the 
time, and they tell you how to build a clock. We have all known teachers whom 
we consider extraordinarily bright, yet we cannot understand what they are 
saying. They fail to provide the doorknob or the threshold to each thought so 
that you can grapple with the learning connections along the journey. 
</P>
<P>
Looking good is being good. The disease of looking good is confusing aesthetics 
with performance. A piece of information performs when it successfully 
communicates an idea, not when it is delivered in a pleasing manner. 
Information without communication is no information at all. It is an extremely 
common, insidious malady among graphic designers and architects. The cure is to 
ask how something performs. 
</P>
<P>
The uh-huh syndrome. This occurs when our fear of looking stupid outweighs our 
desire to understand. The manifestations are involuntary head-nodding and 
repeating, "Uh-huh, uh-huh," pretending to know what we do not. Rather than 
admit we don't understand quantum mechanics, we nod our heads as if we were 
intimately familiar with the subject, desperately trying to give the impression 
that we understand terms or allusions that are incomprehensible to us. This 
only prevents us from learning and exacerbates our suspicion that everyone else 
knows more than we do. 
</P>
<P>
Unhealthy comparisons. Comparing unknowns or intangibles is uninformative; so 
is comparing things that have nothing in common. People warn of the dangers of 
comparing apples to oranges, when this is a perfectly reasonable comparison. 
They share many common characteristics -- both are globular fruit that grow on 
trees. An unhealthy comparison would be to compare the cost of a loaf of bread 
or a movie 50 years ago to the cost today. The dollar had a completely 
different value then. The informative value of this comparison is very little. 
Whereas healthy comparison is one of the most powerful informative tools -- for 
example, comparing the cost of a loaf of bread relative to a movie 50 years ago 
and today. 
</P>
<P>
If it's accurate, it's informative. One doesn't necessarily follow the other. 
The cure is learning to go beyond the facts, to meaning, and to recognize the 
nature of the receiver. Accuracy or facts do not necessarily make things 
understandable. Quoting a price in pounds won't help someone who understands 
only dollars and cents. Barometric pressure is another example. I would say 
there is one person in a thousand who knows how the barometric pressure is 
derived or what it means; yet weather commentators slavishly offer it in every 
forecast. 
</P>
<P>
Unnecessary exactitude. Rounding off is not a sin. Not only is extreme accuracy 
not always information, it is often not necessary. For pilots, knowing the 
exact altitude of the plane is important. But whether the plane is flying at 
32,000 feet or 32,112 doesn't add to their experience of flying. In the 
business community, an accountant needs exact figures, but someone making a 
presentation on sales projections might just as well say that projected sales 
will be $90,000 rather than $91,653. Just because the technology to provide 
accuracy to the nth degree exists doesn't mean we have to take advantage of it. 
Sometimes detail prohibits you from seeing the bigger picture. Even the federal 
government permits rounding dollar amounts on tax forms. 
</P>
<P>
Rainbow worship, or adjectivitis. This is an epidemic belief that more color 
and more colorful language will increase understanding. This is particularly 
insidious in sports reporting, which has adapted the dramatic language of war. 
Teams are "annihilated, destroyed, massacred." 
</P>
<P>
Here today, gone today memory dysfunction. This is characterized by total 
memory loss one hour after learning something. This has been caused by the 
educational system's emphasis on short-term memory. The cramming of unnecessary 
information about unnecessary subjects for unnecessary examinations to get 
unnecessary grades. The cure is very simple; the key to learning is remembering 
what you are interested in and that through interest comes understanding. 
</P>
<P>
Overload amnesia. This is a permutation of the here today, gone today memory 
dysfunction that occurs more specifically as a response to overloading yourself 
with data. When overtaxed, your memory will not only release the data that you 
were trying to retain but also may arbitrarily purge other files as well. This 
is often experienced when trying to assimilate data when you cannot control the 
flow, such as in a classroom, conference or lecture. This is why, after 
listening to a particularly ponderous speech, not only can you not remember a 
thing the speaker said, but you forget where you parked your car, too. 
</P>
<P>
User-friendly intimidation. User-friendly has to be one of the most absurd 
terms in the language of technology. Like many other words in techno-talk, this 
usually means the opposite of itself. Any piece of hardware or software that 
has to be described as user-friendly is probably not. Often the appearance of 
friendship with silly graphics is only camouflage for incoherent instructions. 
Besides, why should a computer be friendly? We have the right to expect 
technology and equipment to perform for us, to save us time and make our lives 
easier, but if we expect friendship from it, we're bound to be disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
Some-assembly-required gambit. I have no doubt that somewhere in the 
instructions for building a Saturn missile are the words "some assembly 
required." This is instant intimidation, a phrase lightly tossed off and 
designed to make the user feel that any boob could put this machine together 
during a network station break. I suspect that it's sheer business chicanery, a 
trick so that the manufacturer can collect on a house call and a repair bill 
after you have failed miserably at the some-assembly-required test. 
</P>
<P>
The expert-opinion syndrome. There is a tendency to believe that the more 
"expert opinions" we get -- be they legal, medical, automotive or otherwise -- 
the more informed we will be. But we tend to forget that "expert opinion" is by 
no means synonymous with "objective opinion." Unfortunately, most experts come 
with a professional bias that makes obtaining truly objective information 
almost impossible. Take the second-opinion movement in medicine in which 
patients are encouraged to consult more than one doctor before undergoing 
non-emergency surgery. Surgeons are trained to respond to problems by 
performing surgery, so it is likely that they will see surgery as the solution 
to a patient's problem. 
</P>
<P>
Don't tell me how it ends. The popularity of the suspense genre in books and 
movies has encouraged people to extrapolate this to maintaining interest when 
conveying new information as a salesman does when unveiling a new product. I 
think not knowing how something ends makes us apprehensive; it prohibits us 
from understanding how something was done while we frantically try to guess how 
it might end. People love Shakespeare because they know the endings; an opera 
is more pleasurable when you know the whole story before the curtain rises. 
While suspense has its place, it does tend to induce anxiety, which is probably 
not an optimum state for receiving new information. If you know the ending, you 
can relax and enjoy the manner in which something is presented. An audience 
will be more receptive to new information if it isn't kept in suspense, made 
anxious trying to guess where someone is going. Many people can't really listen 
to an idea until key questions about it have been answered in their minds. 
</P>
<P>
Information impostors. This is nonsense that masquerades as information because 
it is postured in the form of information. We automatically give a certain 
weight to data based on the form in which it is delivered. Because we don't 
take the time to question this, we assume we have received some information. My 
favorite example of this is in cookbook recipes that call for you to "season to 
taste" or "cook until done." This doesn't tell you very much. Why bother? 
Information impostors are the fodder for administrativitis. 
</P>
<P>
Administrativitis. This is a disease manifest in schools, institutions and big 
business where the individuals think that they are running the system but where 
the opposite is the case. It is characterized by a preoccupation with the 
details of the operation -- administrative issues, salaries, square footage of 
office space and supplies -- and a neglect of the purposes for operation. It 
has reached global proportions and is the fundamental curse of our society. 
</P>
<P>
Edifitis. This is a condition characterized by the belief that a better 
building or a flashier annual report will solve all problems. Many a business 
has crumbled trying to improve its corporate headquarters instead of its 
corporation. 
</P>
<P>
THE CURES 
</P>
<P>
THESE ARE my own prescriptions for reducing anxiety, for making less painful 
and more sensible decisions about the information in your life, for developing 
practical defenses against the increasing onslaught of raw data. They include 
the tactics I employ when the piles on my desk start to topple, my appointment 
schedule short-circuits, and my life seems ever more complex. My battle plan 
for conquering information and information anxiety is aimed at improving your 
attitude toward the subject, as well as the actual approach you take to 
information-processing. 
</P>
<P>
Robust Attitudes 
</P>
<P>
Accept that there is much you won't understand. Let what you don't know spark 
your curiosity. Visualize the words I don't know as a bucket that can now be 
filled with the water of knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
As you learn about something, try to remember what it is like not to know. This 
will add immeasurably to your ability to explain things to other people. 
</P>
<P>
Reduce guilt feelings over the unread by recognizing that the quantity of 
information is such that you can't read everything. 
</P>
<P>
Every time you come across a new idea, try to relate it to something else. Find 
a connection from the new idea to other ideas. 
</P>
<P>
Think about opposites. When you have a problem, think of one solution, then of 
its opposite. When you choose a direction, think about what would happen if you 
went in an opposite direction. 
</P>
<P>
Robust Actions 
</P>
<P>
Become familiar with the traps and pitfalls of communicating information. Are 
you a victim of: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The disease of familiarity? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Thinking that looking good is being good? 
</P>
<P>
 -- The uh-huh syndrome? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Unhealthy comparisons? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Assuming that if something is accurate it's informative? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Unnecessary exactitude? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rainbow worship, or adjectivitis? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Here today, gone today memory dysfunction? 
</P>
<P>
 -- User-friendly intimidation? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Some-assembly-required gambit? 
</P>
<P>
 -- The expert-opinion syndrome? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Don't tell me how it ends syndrome? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Failing to recognize information impostors? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Administrativitis? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Edifitis? 
</P>
<P>
Establish your own level of appropriateness when it comes to accuracy. For 
example, when someone asks you the time, instead of faithfully recounting to 
the minute the time on your digital watch, try saying, "It's almost noon." 
</P>
<P>
Make a list of the terms you use but don't really understand, such as the Dow 
Jones Industrials or the M1, M2, M3, and make a point to learn what they mean 
-- one at a time. 
</P>
<P>
Plan your information diet as you would plan a vacation. Outline a system for 
categorizing the information needs in your life based on your answers to the 
following questions: 
</P>
<P>
 -- What do you need for your job? 
</P>
<P>
 -- How much is essential? 
</P>
<P>
 -- How much is desirable? 
</P>
<P>
 -- What subjects pique your interest? 
</P>
<P>
 -- What do you like to talk about? 
</P>
<P>
 -- What do you spend time with that isn't really necessary? 
</P>
<P>
 -- How would the elimination of it change your life? 
</P>
<P>
After you have established categories, develop a picture of your informational 
habits (the newspapers you read, programs you watch, books you consult, etc.). 
How do they fit into the larger categories and subgroupings? 
</P>
<P>
Determine your preferred method of learning. Some people learn best by reading 
a book, taking a course, experimenting or asking someone else. Then, when you 
need to get information on a subject, try to find a way that will involve your 
preferred form. Personally, I learn more from talking to one other person. 
</P>
<P>
Isolate the informational areas in your life that give you the most anxiety. 
They could be: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Medical (talking to doctors). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Financial (handling banking, mortgages, insurance forms, loan 
applications). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Electronic (buying equipment, operating technology). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Reference materials (reading train schedules or statistical abstracts). 
</P>
<P>
Just by making a list, you will probably feel less anxious. Rate the items from 
one to 10. Postulate what would have to happen to reduce your anxiety in each 
area. Would you have to take a course, study for two years, or could you call 
someone on the phone? Then you might decide you would rather pay an accountant 
to figure out your taxes than overcome your form phobia. Once you admit that 
you can't know everything, you will be much more comfortable with the idea of 
not knowing something. 
</P>
<P>
Reduce your guilt pile of reading materials that seem to gaze disapprovingly at 
you from their high perch on your desk while they wait interminably to be read. 
I use the shard approach. First, I let the stack of periodicals (piled on the 
floor next to my desk) reach a designated height (about 2 feet). Then I leaf 
through them and rip out articles that interest me. This reduces my guilt pile 
to a small stack of articles that becomes my interest "shards." 
</P>
<P>
We have only begun to tap the markets for information. It is capital in an 
unlimited supply. Information isn't just mathematical formulas or instructions 
for a computer. It is art, advice, technology, theory and the motivation behind 
all communications. 
</P>
<P>
Those who profit most from it will be those who recognize its universality and 
multiple applications. Those who tap into new sources of information with 
confidence and a sound sense of purpose will be the power brokers of tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
As the economy adapts to an unlimited supply of capital, we will come to view 
information in a different light and adjust our vision to accommodate it. And, 
as we become more comfortable with living in an information age, we can shed 
some of our anxieties about it.

I receive about 100 books a week for possible review. My mail comes in plastic 
buckets. UPS and Federal Express fight to get through my door. I used to be 
able to set aside science fiction, women's romances and children's books 
because they weren't taken seriously, but now I have to look at them, too. I 
spend my mornings reading first chapters. By and large, if a novel doesn't 
excite me in the first 20 pages, it's out the door. About 55,000 books are 
published each year, but not all contain original ideas. Most of the business 
management books on how we can beat the Japanese are identical. Since the 
number of books published increases 10% a year, I don't have time for much TV. 
But "The Cosby Show" is not so compelling when the alternative is a novel by 
John Updike.

Why can't people write basic English? Not even our executive summaries are 
concise. The environmental-impact report on the East L.A. prison was 8 inches 
thick. USC's economic-impact report on the smog-reduction plan consisted of 
arcane demographics and economic formulas. I had no idea how they arrived at 
their conclusions. Sometimes I sit there, knowing I have an important vote to 
cast the following day, and say to myself, "I don't know what this means." The 
Community Redevelopment Agency budget was so dense I finally had to send the 
agency a list of questions. The response totaled 150 pages, twice the size of 
its budget.

<P>
A decade ago, you had a daily newspaper and two wire services. Today, there's 
much more news. Between reading the three major news magazines, I watch the 
morning news, spend an hour reading The Times, listen to KNX, monitor CNN 
throughout the day and look at all three major nightly network news shows. A 
producer saves me a lot of time by sorting hundreds of stories into 22 computer 
baskets. By the time I arrive at 4 p.m., we've got everything from Italian bomb 
threats to AIDS in mice. With all this information, however, mistakes 
occasionally occur. Sometimes I open the Lotto file and find Palestinians. I'm 
totally dependent on my computer. Where did people ever find the time to go rip 
stories off a wire machine?

CRAIG BUTLER, designer, partner of Butler Kosh Brooks, and co-founder and

<P>
Design is so nebulous. Design can be anything from an attitude to an idea. 
Everything I do demands pages of information. I scan three newspapers, 
subscribe to the trades and listen to radio news. I look at hundreds of 
photographic portfolios and read 15 ad magazines, everything from Ad Age and 
Confetti to Zoom. Stacks of Time and Newsweek and back copies of Spy, Life and 
Esquire fill my house. I'm mentally exhausted by this blur of information. The 
longer I'm in the design business, the more there is to know. This fear of 
feeling that I don't know is driving me nuts. I have a recurring nightmare that 
something is happening and I don't know what it is.

<P>
I have to be aware of everything that could influence the purchase of a house. 
That's why I subscribe to more than 100 real-estate newsletters, legal journals 
and economic reports. I read 28 different Sunday newspapers from across the 
country. I also review every listing, escrow and sales report from the 1,400 
people in my six offices. I spend two hours every night studying data sent to 
the FAX machine in my house. For many people, the flood of information 
available today just causes anxiety. People who try to study all the background 
on fixed, assumable and variable interest rates usually find the price of the 
house has gone up by the time they make a decision.

JAMES LENTS, executive officer, South Coast Air Quality Management District 
</P>
<P>
I receive more than 100 documents, letters, journals and reports each day. I 
can't disregard anything because, in this job, the political information is 
just as important as the technical. With millions of bits of information 
passing by me, I've given up trying to memorize statistics. I just try to 
understand concepts. I have to deal with 10 times more information than a 
decade ago. Ten years ago, who thought about the Earth getting warmer? Now 
there's an entire body of knowledge on the greenhouse effect. I used to garden, 
but who has time for a hobby anymore?

</P>
<P>
The volume of information is staggering in the analytical business. I often 
feel as if I'm drinking from a fire hose. I try to be selective, to delegate 
research and read only articles by journalists and academicians I know are 
credible. I won't spend more than 30 minutes with a news magazine, and limit my 
newspaper reading to news, business and sports. But from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m., 
after everybody else has gone home, I'm usually still here wading through 
stacks of paper. When I'm finished at the end of the day, I know there are 
dozens of interesting things I never got to. It's very frustrating.

</P>
<P>
When I got into computer analysis of finite elements in (airframe) structures 
in the mid-'50s, there were only three professional publications. Ten years 
later, there were 10,000. Today, there is so much technical data that some 
magazines do nothing but synopsize documents in other journals. I have 8,000 
engineers monitoring every advance in aerodynamics, but I still must go through 
about 6 inches of technical mail every day. The amount and complexity of 
engineering data should come as no surprise. There's more computing equipment 
on a single airplane today than there was west of the Mississippi 30 years ago.

JANE PISANO, president, LA 2000 
</P>
<P>
I have a paper-intensive job that requires me to be current with an incredible 
array of information. I spend three hours a day reading about urban-policy 
issues, transportation, housing, environment, jobs and demographics. The 
challenge is how to evaluate all of it. The 96-page report we released last 
November was the product of a stack of working papers more than 3 feet high. 
Back in March, 1986, when I became director, I had 20/20 vision. Last year, I 
had to go get glasses. I used to read a lot for pleasure. I do much less of 
that now.

</P>
<P>
I have to keep up with medical research on 900 different animal species. 
Yesterday, an elephant had colic. This morning, I saw a python with an oral 
tumor. Tomorrow, I'm calling in a consultant for a bilateral mastectomy on a 
Scottish wildcat. What do I read? Thirty monthly reports on domestic animal 
medicine, three journals on wildlife management and two monthly reports on 
avian disease. I can't ignore the New England Journal of Medicine or the 
Journal of the American Medical Assn. because our primates are remarkably 
similar to humans. I hire outside consultants for pediatrics, ophthalmology and 
radiology because I don't have time to do the reading.

THE BRAT PACK'S MOSCOW MISSION; 
</P>
<P>
A TALE OF THE POLITICS OF TWO DIFFERENT HOLLYWOODS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD BROWNSTEIN, Ronald Brownstein, a contributing editor of this 
magazine, is writing a book about Hollywood and politics. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DOUGLAS ROSS AND Bruce Toms, two aspiring young film makers, have never met 
Budd Schulberg. But you can't fully understand the story of their encounter 
with the Soviet Union without understanding Schulberg's. So it's best to begin 
there -- there being a Hollywood that's as long gone as silent movies. 
</P>
<P>
More than half a century ago, Budd Schulberg grew up, in his own words, as a 
"crown prince" in a Hollywood whose leading lights lived in a style royalty 
could only envy. His father, B. P. Schulberg, had been one of the industry's 
fathers, an early partner of Louis B. Mayer (who went on to found MGM) and 
later head of production at Paramount. Young Schulberg's best friend was 
Maurice Rapf, son of Harry Rapf, who stood third in line at giant MGM, behind 
the imperious Mayer and his legendary production chief, Irving Thalberg. 
</P>
<P>
Schulberg and Rapf were young, smart and idealistic, and, like many who fit 
that description in the Hollywood of 1934, they were fascinated with the vast 
exertions under way in Josef Stalin's Soviet Union. On their vacation from 
Dartmouth that summer, they visited the U.S.S.R. and were awed by virtually 
everything they saw. With its herculean construction projects and ambitious 
five-year plans, the Soviet Union seemed to them to be marching briskly toward 
the "better world" envisioned by progressives. They returned to Hollywood 
radicalized, believing that only socialism could lead the United States out of 
the Depression's bondage. Within a few years, both joined the embryonic 
Hollywood branch of the Communist Party, which grew rapidly in the late 1930s 
on the strength of the belief that, alone among nations, the Soviet Union was 
building a better society. 
</P>
<P>
Times change. In 1987, Ross and Toms toured the Soviet Union as part of an 
idealistic delegation of young celebrities -- drawn from the cream of the film 
world's "brat pack" -- that went to record a video, a sort of polemic MTV clip 
designed to make U.S. teen-agers question their assumptions about the Cold War. 
Along the way, they saw something Schulberg and his contemporaries didn't: a 
system that, instead of pointing toward the future, seemed to be teetering on 
the edge of collapse. 
</P>
<P>
Shaped by his times, Budd Schulberg couldn't wait to bring what he learned in 
the Soviet Union back to the United States; shaped by his times, Doug Ross just 
plain couldn't wait to get back. By the end of the trip, Ross recalls, "every 
single one of us was so anxious to get out of there that we would maim." 
</P>
<P>
WHEN THE STARS COME OUT IN MOSCOW 
</P>
<P>
THE TRIP GREW out of efforts by Tom Siegel, then the fund-raising chief for 
SANE -- a liberal disarmament group that has since merged with another 
arms-control lobby to form SANE / Freeze -- to raise money in Hollywood for 
educational and lobbying programs. The more time Siegel spent plumbing 
Hollywood's financial depths, the more he became intrigued with the industry's 
cultural power. "I was trying to convince the group that the power of this 
medium to push a message was too powerful to ignore," he says. 
</P>
<P>
SANE officials developed the idea of taking a group to the Soviet Union, where 
it could examine the "evil empire" up close -- and then deliver the group's 
anti-arms-race gospel to young people more likely to listen to them than to the 
penitent physicists and military planners that arms-control groups usually send 
out on the road. Siegel began organizing the trip in fall, 1986. But his 
efforts went off track almost instantly. 
</P>
<P>
Siegel's problem was not attracting too few people; it was attracting too many. 
Hollywood's youngest stars, and would-be stars, are probably its most 
politically effervescent element; many have their names on more letterheads 
than films. Among much of young Hollywood, the desire to bury the "brat pack" 
label under good works beats almost as strongly as the urge to graduate from 
John Hughes movies. Actress Mary Stuart Masterson ("Some Kind of Wonderful"), 
for one, thought that the young actors' bratty image sent out exactly the wrong 
message to their fans -- "that it was cool to be a bad boy, that it was cool to 
have an attitude, to not take things seriously. But the big thing these kids 
miss is taking themselves seriously and finding their own voice." 
</P>
<P>
Soon, Siegel had 50 or 60 people turning up at meetings, "in effect auditioning 
for the right to go on the trip." He found himself engulfed by clamorous 
disputes over which young stars could attract the biggest audiences for the 
trip and which were the most seriously committed to political action. 
"Eventually," he says wearily, "all that little back-stabbing got out of hand." 
The project collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
Months later, Siegel warily revived it. This time, he invited only a handful of 
mainstays from the original group. They brought in their friends: Masterson and 
Tim Ransom (a New York stage actor) asked Craig Sheffer (best known for "Some 
Kind of Wonderful"); Helen Slater ("Ruthless People") called Erica Gimpel (the 
television series "Fame"). Judd Nelson ("The Breakfast Club"), Esai Morales 
("La Bamba"), Helen Hunt ("Project X") and several other entertainers and film 
technicians also signed up. Among them were Ross and Toms, who were there to 
direct the video. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 10, 1987, a group of 17 -- armed with an Ikegami / Sony Beta Field 
recorder, five 8-millimeter video cameras and a Super 8-millimeter camera -- 
took off from New York to Paris, where they boarded an Aeroflot flight to 
Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
The group went to the Soviet Union with the implicit purpose of learning that 
its people aren't ogres but "just like us," and that's inevitably what they 
discovered. They found the clubs where Soviet rock bands play. They met 
alluring Soviets of the opposite sex. They toasted fellowship with vodka. They 
displayed the requisite amount of righteous indignation about the foreign 
policies of the Reagan Administration. (Bundled up and bubbling over with 
studied outrage, Nelson explains on one piece of footage that he joined the 
expedition because "I strongly felt I had been fed a load of crap by my 
government.") They wondered, with airy earnestness, why people can get along 
but nations can't. 
</P>
<P>
All par for this particular course, and probably not much different from what 
Schulberg and Rapf concluded more than 50 years ago. But the group that toured 
the Soviet Union also reached conclusions that Schulberg couldn't have even 
imagined half a century ago. 
</P>
<P>
First, they discovered that nobody in the Soviet Union dressed the way they 
did. People approached them in the street to see who they were. How could 
people tell they weren't teen-age Muscovites? "We wore sunglasses and nobody 
else did," says Ross, 27. 
</P>
<P>
They discovered that in a nation where all lives are sublimated to the state, 
they couldn't bear to sublimate themselves to a group for two weeks. Initially, 
the group toured Moscow together, following a rigid schedule laid down by their 
hosts, the Soviet Peace Committee. By the time they got to Leningrad, people 
began going their separate ways -- a response both to the sterility of the 
official schedule and the impossibility of confining so many egos to one bus 
for two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
On the way over, Masterson, 22, recalls, she had "sort of a romantic vision. . 
. . They would all be comrades, they would all be workers." But the reality 
that she faced there shook her. "People are still holding on for that perfect 
society," she says. "But they were getting sick and tired of waiting around." 
</P>
<P>
Nothing worked. Lines outside shops stretched toward oblivion. At the end of 
the trip, the group was fogged in at the Leningrad airport but couldn't call 
Moscow about their connecting flight because no phone line was available. "The 
inefficiency was so frustrating: People don't give a damn about anything 
because they get paid either way," says Ross, who came home a born-again 
capitalist. "In some ways," Masterson concluded, "it is a Third World country 
with bombs." 
</P>
<P>
When Sheffer, 28, probably the most skeptical of the entourage, asked one group 
of their Soviet counterparts about the treatment of Jews in the country, they 
recoiled and changed the subject. Even with glasnost, "a lot of things just 
weren't talked about," he says.Another eye-opener was the yearning to leave 
that they discovered among the young actors and musicians they met. "They still 
believe they can come to America and fulfill their dreams," says Gimpel, 24, 
willowy and soft-spoken. "Especially the young actors want to come here so bad. 
I would talk to young actors and they would say, 'Broadway, Broadway, 
Broadway.' The goal for some of the actors was to get out -- and that made me 
sad." 
</P>
<P>
BACK HOME WITH EXTRA BAGGAGE 
</P>
<P>
MORE THAN 50 years earlier, Schulberg and many more of Hollywood's best and 
brightest had seen in the Soviet system a model for the world. It was only at 
the end of the '30s, when the Communist Party tried to stop him from publishing 
his lacerating Hollywood novel, "What Makes Sammy Run?" that Schulberg 
questioned his faith. Repulsed by the banal cultural rigidity of the Communists 
at home and Stalin's brutality in the Soviet Union -- sensing that if he had 
tried to publish his novel in the Soviet Union he might have disappeared in 
Stalin's obsessive purges, like some of the prominent writers he met in 1934 -- 
he quit the party in 1940. "It was," Schulberg recalled in an interview, 
"extremely disillusioning." Eleven years later, he became a friendly witness 
for the House Un-American Activities Committee, when it came to poke through 
Hollywood for Communists. 
</P>
<P>
It's difficult for this generation of Hollywood activists to imagine how their 
contemporaries half a century ago believed that the Soviets had the answer. To 
Ransom, a well-spoken 25-year-old actor who has organized his own small theater 
company in New York, the notion that someone might prefer living under that 
system to this one, even with its faults, seems almost inconceivable. "A better 
world? It's not," he says. "No way. Between the two, if I have a choice between 
this world and that world, this is a better world, no question about it." When 
Sheffer returned to the United States, he "was ready to kiss the Tarmac." 
</P>
<P>
Reared on trendy disenchantment, many of those in the SANE delegation "came 
back with a more generous view of this country," as Toms, 27, put it. "We are 
really unaware of how lucky we are as a country," Slater says. "It reaffirmed 
my belief that I'm happy where I live, and in the freedom that I have," Sheffer 
says. After a few days of listening to their Soviet counterparts condemn the 
commercialism and shallowness of Hollywood, and mostly nodding sympathetically, 
they even found themselves doing the unthinkable: defending the ability of 
crass, bottom-line-driven Hollywood to produce art amid the slasher movies. "I 
became somewhat indignant (about the criticism) even as I thought, 'I don't 
like it all either; it's not all good,' " Masterson says. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone took their own lessons from the trip; some seemed to never break 
through the simplistic cliches they had packed with their parkas. But most 
returned with respect but no envy, a heightened sense of the possibility of a 
more peaceful coexistence and an intensified appreciation for American values. 
</P>
<P>
That's not too different from the synthesis Ronald Reagan has arrived at as he 
leaves office. That may seem an irrelevant comparison: These were, after all, 
neophyte actors and activists, not political theoreticians. But their 
conclusions, even if superficial, may be more representative of the subtle 
changes in our prevailing assumptions about both countries. If a group of young 
liberals unconsciously share such key assumptions with a septuagenarian 
conservative President most of them loathe, it suggests that the urge to wind 
down the Cold War has quietly penetrated American society, obscured by the 
gales of partisan disagreement about how to do so. 
</P>
<P>
HOLLYWOOD CHANGES . . .AND IT DOESN'T 
</P>
<P>
WHEN THEY got up after kissing the Tarmac, the group discovered that its 
assumptions about activism and Hollywood were mistaken too. 
</P>
<P>
The Hollywood that Schulberg and Rapf returned to in 1934 was a small town. It 
was not long before their heresies reached the ears of the studio elders. " 
'Send them to Thalberg' was the cry," Schulberg told an interviewer many years 
later. "It was like 'Go to the Wizard.' Thalberg was sort of the high priest of 
Hollywood and the producers, especially Mayer, felt he could straighten us 
out." 
</P>
<P>
Production chief Thalberg, only 35 himself, sat the young men down and spoke to 
them gently. He was not alarmed. With wisdom beyond his years, he reminded them 
of the old axiom: Anyone who is not a socialist at 21 is a fool; anyone who 
remains a socialist after 21 is a bigger fool. He told them to forget their 
youthful enthusiasms, to study hard and to come back and assume their rightful 
places when they finished school. The studios, he said, took care of their own. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Schulberg, the brat-pack delegation was met not with outrage or bemused 
paternalism but with indifference. 
</P>
<P>
In the Soviet Union, the group shot piles of film; Ross and Toms figured that 
to convert that mass into an accessible video would cost $75,000. They assumed 
that SANE would pick up the cost. They were wrong; SANE had its own financial 
problems and couldn't pay. 
</P>
<P>
Last January, the group met at Helen Hunt's house and decided to assume control 
of the fund raising. "People seemed to think they had enough contacts in the 
industry so that if it was well divided they could raise the money," says Toms. 
</P>
<P>
Wrong again. 
</P>
<P>
The group assumed what liberal political candidates everywhere assume: that for 
good progressive causes the well in Hollywood never runs dry. Or, as Ransom put 
it, "I had this thing in my head, that there were all these producers with 
money." 
</P>
<P>
There are. But they don't part with it easily. After a few weeks, Ross and 
Toms, who had assumed primary responsibility for the fund raising, learned what 
most candidates eventually do: Hollywood is more fond of giving advice than 
money. "We'd go to see an actor, and they would say, 'You should go to the 
producers, they've got a lot of money,' " says Ross. "The producer would say, 
'No, I don't know what you're talking about.' Everybody would say, 'This is a 
really good project -- here's who should be helping you.' " In Schulberg's day, 
power in Hollywood had been compressed and centralized; 50 years later, Ross 
was learning that Hollywood had grown so large, so disconnected, that there was 
no center. 
</P>
<P>
Some Hollywood figures, including Robert Redford and director Roland Joffe, did 
step up to help them, as did Varitel Video, a post-production facility. But 
most of the industry leaders -- besieged by requests from other causes -- 
wouldn't even talk to them. They ended up depending on their contemporaries, 
younger people just breaking into the business, and older, veteran activists 
such as Norman Lear, Stanley K. Sheinbaum and Peg Yorkin. 
</P>
<P>
The video, a combination history of the arms race, travelogue and plea for 
peace, edited to a Sting and U2 back-beat, has now been virtually completed. 
Ross and Toms expect to begin showing it to its target audience of high school 
students shortly. A deal to syndicate it to local television stations is also 
under discussion. But as the project has dragged on, some of the participants 
-- so fired with enthusiasm when they got off the plane -- have drifted back to 
their lives and careers. 
</P>
<P>
"To a certain extent," says Siegel, who has left SANE and is now director of 
development for a medical center, "the project was very enlightening and a 
little discouraging, and people separated themselves out from it because . . . 
they were disillusioned a bit by the process." 
</P>
<P>
Ross and Toms, who have stuck with it, don't seem disillusioned, only 
chastened. It has been, in every respect, immensely more difficult than they 
expected to put the vision in their heads onto the screen. "We never 
anticipated a two-year ordeal," Ross says. For someone embarking on a career in 
Hollywood, getting used to that may be the most important lesson of all.

Ozzy Osbourne hosting horror films? Cannon Home Video has hired the heavy metal 
madman to perform two-minute introductions to each of eight horror films. The 
first four -- "Dracula's Last Rights," "Crucible of Horror," "Beast in the 
Cellar" and "Blood on Satan's Cloth" -- are due on video shelves April 26. 
</P>
<P>
Kristina Hamm, assistant to the director of Cannon Home Video, told us Osbourne 
will provide a plot summary and "tell a couple of jokes." 
</P>
<P>
"We've discovered that the prime horror video renters also listen to heavy 
metal music," explained Hamm. "That's why we felt Ozzy was a logical choice." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, European metal head King Diamond -- recently featured on Geraldo 
Rivera's notorious Satan special -- has landed a role in the fright flick 
"Boggs," about a not-quite-human televangelist, which begins filming next month 
in Florida. Sources tell us King Diamond will play a priest in a church lottery 
sequence where two lucky people win . . . entrance to hell. Marc Shapiro

Touchstone publicity calls "Bank Job" (due this spring) the directorial debut 
of "Stakeout" writer Jim Kouf. Maybe they forgot Kouf directed "Miracles," a 
1984 Orion film with Tom Conti and Terri Garr that never even got a national 
release? 
</P>
<P>
. . . Producer Michael Shamberg in American Film on distributors who turned 
down the chance to finance "A Fish Called Wanda": "Dino De Laurentiis passed 
because he thought it wasn't funny, and that's why he's out of business." 
</P>
<P>
. . . Stereotypes, anyone? A casting call for a Carl's Jr. commercial -- 
involving a meeting of U.N. delegates -- called for Ruskies "with heavy 
eyebrows" and "swarthy" Turks. Oh, and Mideast-types dressed as sheiks.

Picture these unusual scenes from modern weddings -- and don't worry that 
you've fallen through the looking glass: 
</P>
<P>
A sweet, young bride walks down the aisle wearing a traditional wedding gown -- 
except that it's backless, or at least it bares her shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
A career woman marrying for the first time dresses in a fantasy of white 
marabou feathers -- even though she's 35 years old. 
</P>
<P>
A stylish grandmother chooses a suit for her third wedding. It's short, tight 
and white. 
</P>
<P>
Unconventional brides are shocking the starch out of the traditional wedding 
dress code. And it's particularly apparent in the wedding fashion news for 
spring. Among the unexpected trends, shades of white are now favored for brides 
of all ages, no matter how many times they've been married. (Rules of etiquette 
once dictated that older or second-time brides only wear pastels.) 
</P>
<P>
As for shapes and silhouettes, fantasy gowns are the leading look, with 
cathedral trains, sweeping veils and details that recall medieval maidens, '20s 
flappers, blonde-with-pearls socialites, even classy showgirls. 
</P>
<P>
By the way, the median age for all brides is now 27 years, the U.S. Census 
Bureau reports. And this year, in 40% of all weddings, at least one partner 
will not be marrying for the first time. Changes in the profile of the modern 
bride are causing big changes in the wedding party. It isn't unusual for a 
mother to walk her daughter down the aisle if a father or father figure cannot. 
An older groom will ask his son to be his best man. And a daughter will act as 
matron of honor at her own mother's wedding. 
</P>
<P>
This free-spirited approach is having a bold effect on bridal fashion. Even for 
small, informal weddings, dresses have a new look. Most often short, they don't 
cut short the personality. Designers are showing a wide variety of colors, 
including white, with ruffles, overskirts, tight torsos, fitted jackets -- a 
full range of high-fashion details. Fabrics such as chiffon and organza are 
featured to emphasize a soft silhouette. 
</P>
<P>
"There have never been more choices," notes Barbara Tober, editor in chief of 
Bride's magazine, after reviewing a spate of spring wedding fashion shows. 
Tober also oversees a massive, annual survey of trends in weddings. 
</P>
<P>
Above all, she finds, "brides, especially older brides, want dresses that 
reflect their personality, whether it's romantic or citified. Even if you're 30 
or 35 years old, it doesn't mean you've got to hide behind a barrel." 
</P>
<P>
Something else is changing the shape of wedding wear: Marriage itself is back 
in fashion, after close to 30 years on the out list. Indulging every romantic 
fashion fantasy is just another way of expressing the new mood. 
</P>
<P>
Men seem enthusiastic about all of it, Tober's research proves. Many of them 
want to wear wedding bands, and most say that family is more important to them 
than career. And grooms now help pay for their weddings and receptions, as do 
many brides. 
</P>
<P>
Despite today's grand-scale attitude, most men still seem to prefer traditional 
attire for their weddings. Bright suspenders sometimes peek out from under 
black tuxedo jackets, but elegant classics prevail: cutaways for morning 
weddings, strollers for afternoons and black tuxedos after dark.

ONE WRITER'S VIEW OF THE VIETNAM MOVIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
James H. Webb Jr., former Navy Secretary, Vietnam veteran, winner of the Navy 
Cross and a best-selling novelist, is asked if he has seen any Vietnam movie 
that impressed him. His reply is cautious. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't seen all of them," he says. "I got so saturated with Vietnam when I 
was writing 'Fields of Fire' that I just don't know that much." 
</P>
<P>
He means his best-selling Vietnam novel of 1978. It's based on his combat 
experiences in 1969, when he was a Marine platoon leader, working the deadly 
terrain southwest of Da Nang that the Marines called the Arizona Territory, or 
simply the Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Twice wounded in the war, Webb thinks a minute, then talks about three of the 
better-known Vietnam movies. He starts with Oliver Stone's "Platoon," easily 
the most financially successful of them all to date. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked the first 20 minutes of it very much, up through the ambush 
(sequence)," he says in an interview from his office in Arlington, Va. "And 
then, in terms of credibility, I think it sort of lost it after that." 
</P>
<P>
How so? "The lack of camaraderie. It was sort of an overblown Conradian 
allegory of good versus evil. It's kind of an interesting idea, but I don't 
think it fit into the platoon structure." 
</P>
<P>
But the technical details, the care in portraying a grunt's daily existence, 
impressed him. He credits the "Platoon" technical adviser, Dale Dye, a retired 
Marine captain, for that. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Dale Dye saved that movie." 
</P>
<P>
His assessment of Francis Coppolas "Apocalypse Now" is brief: "A disaster." 
Michael Cimino's "The Deer Hunter" gets a kinder review. 
</P>
<P>
"It was interesting," Webb says. Although flawed in its details of combat, he 
adds, it was broad in scope, and "as an emotional statement, I think it was 
very powerful." 
</P>
<P>
He also has praise for a 1978 film that had little publicity but good 
word-of-mouth among veterans who have seen it -- "Go Tell the Spartans," 
starring Burt Lancaster as an aging Army major in the early days of U.S. 
involvement in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
That film, Webb says, "was extremely good, although a little stiff . . . of 
that first generation of (Vietnam) films, that was the only one that to me had 
any credibility at all." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, despite more than a dozen Vietnam films made since the late '70s, 
"Fields of Fire," Webb's first novel, never has gotten the nod from Hollywood, 
although it once was optioned for a movie. 
</P>
<P>
The book has gotten its share of criticism, including from some in military, he 
notes, "but it's honest. It offends everyone . . . it's got dope in it, it's 
got shooting people up." 
</P>
<P>
There are still periodic inquiries about "Fields," he says, but no solid film 
offers. Why not? 
</P>
<P>
"You'd have to ask them," Webb says, "I really don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Now writing his fourth novel and a film treatment for what he calls "a 
contemporary Marine Corps courtroom drama," he still hopes that someday, 
somehow, "Fields of Fire" will join the ranks of Vietnam films: 
</P>
<P>
"That's been one of my dreams, to be honest with you. I've always wanted that . 
. . the book was a straight shot from my heart." 
</P>
<P>
Think a film version could still happen? James Webb laughs. "I've learned to be 
very Asian about all of that. When the time comes, it'll happen. Otherwise, it 
won't. You can't worry about it." -- J.S.

<P>
THE BENEFITS AND LIMITATIONS OF FACIAL CONTOURING AS TREATMENT FOR SAGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
FACIAL contouring, which involves manual massage or mechanical manipulation of 
the facial muscles, is coming into vogue as more men and women seek ways to 
look younger without going under the cosmetic surgeon's knife. 
</P>
<P>
Although many cosmetologists refer to these facials as "non-surgical face 
lifts," contouring treatments are not a true alternative to the scalpel. 
Rather, they are intended to develop facial muscle tone. Vera Brown's salon, 
Vera's Retreat in the Glen in Los Angeles, offers both manual and machine 
treatments. She claims that both methods increase the circulation in the face 
and neck "the same way that exercise works on the rest of the body. These 
treatments won't get rid of deep wrinkles. Only plastic surgery will do that. 
But for people who can't -- or won't -- have surgery, they're the next best 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
Television star Linda Evans of ABC's "Dynasty" reports that 10 years of 
contouring treatments have kept her face firm and have, so far, eliminated the 
need for cosmetic surgery. Evans and fellow actresses Ali MacGraw and Jamie Lee 
Curtis receive treatments at Louise Bianco's salon in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
Bianco uses a manual massage technique developed about 60 years ago by a 
Viennese surgeon. Bianco says the surgeon perfected the technique with a French 
cosmetologist named Renna Campbell, who later brought it to the United States. 
Her husband, L.A. dentist Dr. George Campbell, gave up his practice to perform 
what he called the "Renna" technique on such stars as Marilyn Monroe and Clark 
Gable. "The deep massage works on all of the muscle groups in the face, keeping 
the cheeks round and the jawline firm," Bianco says. 
</P>
<P>
Jean Carle Devereaux, who uses the "Renna" method at Brown's salon, says that 
lubricating emollients must be used so the skin is not stretched during the 
massage. "The circulation is increased about 20 times faster than normal," he 
says. "The increased oxygen causes the muscles to become stronger." 
</P>
<P>
Today, not only facialists, but doctors, physical therapists, practitioners of 
acupuncture and other health professionals use new facial devices on their 
clients. Specialists claim that the machines "exercise" the face and soften or 
eliminate wrinkles. 
</P>
<P>
Equipment with names such as Electro-Acuscope, Myopulse and Myopulse 
Renaissance are called "acupressure face-lift machines." Small amounts of 
electrical current stimulate the nerves, which causes capillaries to enlarge, 
increasing circulation. The skin looks flushed and healthy, and fine wrinkles 
seem to disappear. Margo Jordan, who administers such treatments in her Santa 
Monica office, says that after 16 weekly visits, the "face-lift" effect can be 
maintained with monthly treatments. 
</P>
<P>
A hand-held version of the machine has been developed by Dr. Dean Richards of 
Australia. The Acuhealth locates acupuncture points and gives off mild 
electrical impulses. This $245 home-use unit is marketed by mail from Woodland 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Neither manual nor mechanical contouring treatments have the long-lasting 
effect of plastic surgery. Treatments must be continued to sustain results, and 
at $30 to $100 per treatment, the maintenance process can be costly. But for 
many people who don't want to risk the dangers of anesthesia, incisions and 
infection, contouring treatments may be a reasonable alternative.

' ANOTHER THING I ENJOY ABOUT TV IS THE OPPORTUNITY IT AFFORDS ME TO TRAVEL AND 
MEET THE PEOPLE. '

<TEXT>
<P>
BY TICHI WILKERSON AND MARCIA BORIE 
</P>
<P>
From "Hollywood Legends," by Tichi Wilkerson and Marcia Borie, recently 
published by Tale Weaver Publishing. In November, 1955, Ronald Reagan -- then 
host of "General Electric Theatre" -- wrote the following for the Hollywood 
Reporter. 
</P>
<P>
I HAVE FOR THE past months been combining television and motion picture chores. 
This manifold job has taught me one thing for sure: Never again will I allow 
myself to get into a position where I must make a choice between a seat in 
Congress and a position in the arms of my leading lady. 
</P>
<P>
The actor's first duty is to his profession. Hence, you can rest assured that I 
will never again run for mayor or anything but head man in my own household. 
You may remember a few seasons back when I was honorary mayor of Thousand Oaks 
and also a candidate for mayor of Hollywood. It was then that someone 
approached me with the suggestion that I run for Congress. 
</P>
<P>
I realized then that I was becoming a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. I selected the 
Jekyll character -- an actor. This presented a chance to appear in RKO's 
"Cattle Queen of Montana." All this plus my regular weekly stint on the 
"General Electric Theatre." Now I am getting the biggest chance of my career. 
My bosses have permitted me to produce "Seeds of Hate" for their series. 
</P>
<P>
Another thing I enjoy about TV is the opportunity it affords me to get away 
from Hollywood, travel around the country and meet the people. I now make 
coast-to-coast (trips) for my sponsor. In this manner I can keep in constant 
touch with the public and better understand their moods, their likes and 
dislikes.

PARALYZED PLAYWRIGHT CHRISTOPHER NOLAN CAN'T SPEAK -- BUT HE CAN HEAR THE 
APPLAUSE

<TEXT>
<P>
The applause was still thundering after the world premiere of Christopher 
Nolan's "Torchlight and Laser Beams" at Dublin's Gaiety Theatre when the author 
appeared on the stage in his wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
He is 23 years old. He is unable to speak, to chew or swallow or to use his 
limbs. His words of thanks had to be read out for him: 
</P>
<P>
"The critics may describe me in the morning newspapers as either a fashioned 
playwright or a gullible fool. Maybe they'll say nothing at all, or that magic 
forged a new voice out of water and wine." 
</P>
<P>
What the newspapers did say was that Nolan, already praised for his novel, 
"Under the Eye of a Clock," had now become a first-rate playwright as well. 
Director Michael Scott helped Nolan adapt the play from his novel, bringing 
Nolan's inner voice -- so unlike everyday language -- to the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
The play is about a youth, Joseph Meehan, who is much like Nolan. One actor 
(Conor Mullen) plays the outer Joseph, while another (Frank McCusker) plays his 
inner self, dubbed Joseph Too. Joseph Too stands back, watching and reflecting 
on his own life, ironically commenting on the predicament of a soul in duress. 
</P>
<P>
The story begins in the womb, where the child lies sideways, the origin of his 
handicap. His birth is the beginning of his painful effort to free his mind 
from the prison of his useless body. 
</P>
<P>
The play combines Nolan's dense, alliterative poetry with scenes from his 
family and school life, fusing nightmarish fantasy with ordinary -- and 
sometimes delightfully extraordinary -- reality. It contrasts the sometimes 
shallow values of the able-bodied with the able-minded Joseph's fierce joy of 
living, in spite of gross handicap. 
</P>
<P>
Catherine Byrne plays the warm, solid mother who teaches her son to read the 
words that will liberate him, "resurrecting hope where there was no hope at 
all." Clive Geraghty, Rachel Dowling and Eva Watkinson play Joseph's father, 
sister, and archetypal fairy-tale grandmother, the family which nurtures his 
talent. 
</P>
<P>
It is a play that has to explain how it was written. Nolan must tap out every 
letter of every word with a "unicorn stick" fastened to his forehead. Young 
Joseph speaks of typing as a "beauty that was nearly lost forever." 
</P>
<P>
The first time he tries to type he gets cold feet. He can't overcome the 
shocking spasticity that holds his body in an iron grip. His mother, 
Bernadette, cups his chin in her hand and waits. 
</P>
<P>
Soothed, he finally begins to jab at the keys. Bernadette expects something 
simple: "The cat sat on the mat" perhaps. To her astonishment, her son begins 
to type a poem, "I learn to bow," full of alliteration, image, euphony and 
emotion. 
</P>
<P>
She can hardly believe what's happening. He can't either. His mind unleashes a 
torrent of words: "Day after dawn, raw quiet rested there. As I peered through 
rough pastures, dewdrops listened in golden buttercups. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The play traces his liberation in a series of powerful scenes, the most 
effective of which are the darkly comic episode of his birth, and his entering 
high school, where for the first time he had no family to help him communicate. 
</P>
<P>
Scott's elaborate production is as spectacular as Nolan's language. When 
Joseph's discovery of writing launches him into a new world, he takes the 
plunge actually as well as metaphorically -- into a tank of water, shouting 
words as he struggles upward from its depths. 
</P>
<P>
Nolan's poetry makes the audience work hard. It is often violent and explosive 
-- the outburst itself, not some other point of reference, the meaning. Each 
word bears an enormous weight of effort. Putting that language on the stage, 
with equivalent gesture and movement, is a formidable task. Scott doesn't 
always pull it off, but when he does, the result is remarkable. 
</P>
<P>
I visited Nolan in the comfortable semi-detached house where he lives with his 
family in Clontarf, a suburb on the north shore of Dublin Bay. It is also a few 
doors from the Central Remedial clinic, which played an immense role in Nolan's 
life. His parents, Joe and Bernadette, gave up their farm in West Meath when 
they became aware of young Christy's astonishing intelligence. Determined to 
give him the best education they could manage, they moved to Dublin and 
completely altered their lives. 
</P>
<P>
I wondered how we would talk, but I needn't have worried. Along with his 
typewriter Nolan talks with his eyes, or points to passages he has written in a 
vivid language of his own which he has to teach his family and friends to use. 
</P>
<P>
He told me about the rehearsals for the play in an old church, St. Catherine's, 
and he flicked his eyes up and in wide slow arcs to underline the connection he 
felt to those buried in the vaults under his wheelchair, in particular to the 
shades of all the handicapped who had gone before him and rotted as outcasts. 
</P>
<P>
He sees himself "as a light as weak as a match flame in profound darkness, but 
a light nonetheless." Hence the title 'Torchlight and Laser Beams.' " 
Torchlight is the image of his early struggles to communicate. "The newness of 
laser beams is indicative of how my voice has hurdled its silence-barrier and 
now can be heard in every corner of the world. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very aware of silent folk locked within their skeletal prisons. Through 
my writings, and this play, I try to give them hope. I hope to master my 
damnable body and operate my computer by whatever means I can. The means for 
helping fellows like me are stunning in their ingenuity. I cannot rest happy 
until I sample independence." 
</P>
<P>
He showed me the score of the piano music for the play by Wim Merten, the 
Belgian composer who wrote the music for the film "The Belly of an Architect." 
Nolan was proud to have been the occasion for the music. 
</P>
<P>
Where did he acquire his vocabulary? From listening? Reading? Asking questions? 
</P>
<P>
"I listen to the radio, yes. My mind is like a spin dryer at full speed. My 
thoughts fly around my head by the millions. Beautiful words cascade down into 
my lap, images gunfire across my consciousness. While trained to discipline 
them, I jump in awe at the soul-filled bounty of my mind's expanse." 
</P>
<P>
Why does he express so little frustration in his books or his play? 
</P>
<P>
"Just try to imagine how frustrating it is to give expression to that avalanche 
of words in efforts of one great nod after another. I don't have time to get 
frustrated." 
</P>
<P>
No, he hasn't read Joyce. He admires Beckett, but his favorite poet is Gerard 
Manley Hopkins. Where, I wanted to know, did his wicked sense of humor come 
from? 
</P>
<P>
"Humor is my spice of life. What else can I do but laugh at myself? Just think 
of a fellow with a stick on his head trying to explain himself to a person 
blessed with coordination. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't say where my humor comes from, but ever since I was tiny I could find 
fun in almost any situation. Humor enters my writing through no fault of my 
own. Situations just lend themselves to my sense of the ridiculous. I hope my 
audiences can join with me in laughing a belly laugh at a fellow in straits not 
far removed from absurd." 
</P>
<P>
How does he keep going? Does he pray a lot? 
</P>
<P>
"People imagine I am very spiritual. It drives me mad the way I am expected to 
be a saint. There is no big saintly thing going on here in this house. It is 
very ordinary." 
</P>
<P>
He wonders what happened to people like him before now. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to rescue hidden consciousnesses within tongue-tied disabled people. 
'Torchlight and Laser Beams' is a step on this crusade to reach a wider 
audience." 
</P>
<P>
He has drawn his parents and his sister into the fight too. They showed me 
sacks of mail, and a moving letter from a nurse who "has often thought that 
some of the people labeled mentally handicapped might have brilliant minds 
locked in there and are treated as if they understand nothing. 
</P>
<P>
"Two women patients," she wrote, "smile all the time and try to reach us. When 
a staff member said to a colleague, 'she has deteriorated so much recently,' 
the patient burst into tears. The staff member was brought face to face with 
the fact that the patient could understand every word." 
</P>
<P>
"When this is over," Nolan muses, "and I haven't changed the way people think, 
what are they going to do with the likes of me in the future? Prejudice and 
ignorance have to be moved over, turned upside down, mute man's suffering 
ended." 
</P>
<P>
"This" is far from over: Producers have flown in from all over the world, from 
Los Angeles, Australia, Japan, and Europe to see and bid for the play. It has 
been invited to the Edinburgh Festival, and to tour Japan, Australia and 
Denmark. The Mark Taper Forum is considering a production, as is a theater in 
Germany -- the book has already been translated into 14 languages -- and Nolan 
hopes the play will be adapted to television soon.

STAGE WEEK: 'CARROLL' THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
"I want people to think they spent some time with him," said Dan Bredemann of 
the title subject in "I Am Not Lewis Carroll," a one-man show which opened 
Friday at the Itchey Foot Cabaret. 
</P>
<P>
Bredemann, who has been assembling the piece for four years, draws on the 
author-mathematician-children's photographer's most famous works, "Alice in 
Wonderland" and "Alice Through the Looking Glass," as well as a legendary 
collection of letters written by Carroll (a.k.a. Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, 
1832-1898). 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to say I read them all," Bredemann said, "but there seems to be about 
100,000 of them. And they're hilariously funny. He'd write eight hours a day, 
always revising. He never sent out a first draft. He categorized, numbered and 
cross-filed each one so he would never repeat news. And he was not an outgoing 
person: He was shy and fussy and stammered with adults. But he melted with 
children." 
</P>
<P>
The actor-writer admits that much of the piece is a leap of faith. 
</P>
<P>
"The words are 80% to 90% Carroll's," he said, "which I've woven together. The 
greatest compliment I've received is people saying they can't tell which parts 
are mine and which are his. Doing this, I want to become him, convey the spirit 
of this strange, delightful man. Everybody asks me what drugs he took (to write 
"Alice"). Well, the facts just don't support (that claim). The work came from 
his own mind, his own genius." 
</P>
<P>
TWO TOGETHER: It's autobiography plus art in Raymond J. Barry's "Once in 
Doubt," opening tonight at the Cast-at-the-Circle Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
"One day five years ago, I wrote a monologue about a guy making a painting," 
said the actor (a former Open Theatre member and Obie winner for his 
performances in "Leaf People" and "Molly's Dream"). "It was about an artist and 
his work. I thought of it as a long poem -- or something that could be a 
theater piece. Meanwhile, I began writing a dialogue between a man and women, 
almost like a diary. A lot of the scenes were emblematic of my life then." 
</P>
<P>
Some time later, Barry began splicing the two pieces together. The resulting 
work was staged at his New York loft in 1986; he has only recently begun 
reworking the play. With a new partner, Kim O'Reilly (who co-stars here with 
Barry and Harvey Perr), he added a second act and a third character. "What I 
did was very much a trial and error process," Barry said. "So some of it is non 
sequitur, non-linear -- and some of it isn't. It's a real collage." 
</P>
<P>
CRITICAL CROSS FIRE: A pair of Ralph Hunt one-man one-acts, "L305" and "Siamese 
Twin Kills Brother For Bad Breath" is playing at Stages under the umbrella 
title "Two Alone." Guy Giarrizzo directs Dan Mason and Carl Bressler. 
</P>
<P>
Said The Times' Don Shirley: "Sometimes the word monodrama sounds like a 
contradiction in terms. Too many writers of solo pieces, absorbed by their own 
voices, neglect the conflict that's inherent in the drama. 'Two Alone' sounds 
as if Hunt might have fallen into this trap. Yet he avoided it." 
</P>
<P>
From Polly Warfield in Drama-Logue: "Both plays show how fearsome it can be to 
be alone with yourself. . . . Both are literate and well done, but the poetic 
professor (Dan Mason in "L305") definitely outclasses the Siamese twin." 
</P>
<P>
The Herald Examiner's Clifford Gallo found that while the piece "features 
strong performances, it suffers from a number of weaknesses that cannot be 
overcome by its cast. The essential conflict is basically subconscious and the 
plays lack a dramatic payoff." 
</P>
<P>
In the B'nai B'rith Messenger, Madeleine Shaner praised "a movingly focused 
performance by Dan Mason," yet felt that "Siamese Twin" -- while "creative and 
clever, played hard for laughs without getting close to any truths." 
</P>
<P>
Deborah Klugman of the Reader preferred the "more interesting" "Siamese Twin" 
to "L305" -- which she found "accurate in its human essence" but with "a 
predictable sameness." 
</P>
<P>
And from Ezrha Jean Black in the L.A. Weekly: "Both plays' failure is not a 
matter of character delineation, but their unwillingness to probe the thorny 
issues of truth and personal responsibility underlying the crisis of identity."

THE PRESERVATION OF AN AMERICAN CLASSIC; 
</P>
<P>
DONALD MCKAYLE'S 1951 'GAMES' IS REVIVED BY LULA WASHINGTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

"I saw a cop a walking down the street, swinging his billie and a strutting his 
beat. He's gonna catch you, beat you hard, break all of your bones, so help me 
God." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Children's street song from "Games." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the only way to get something done is to do it yourself. 
</P>
<P>
Choreographer Lula Washington did, and as a result, the repertory of her local 
troupe now boasts an American modern-dance classic whose survival she has 
perhaps helped to ensure. 
</P>
<P>
The work is "Games," choreographed by Donald McKayle in 1951. This danced 
picture of city kids' street games shattered by a police beating uses 
children's chanted songs and dialogue to combine a sense of harsh urban reality 
with sassiness and charm. Los Angeles Contemporary Dance Theater, which 
Washington directs, will dance the piece in a mixed-bill performance Feb. 11 at 
USC's Bing Theater. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always been a goal of the company to do works by pioneer black 
choreographers like McKayle," Washington said. "I'd especially wanted to do 
'Games.' " 
</P>
<P>
Then last summer at a conference on minority dance in Massachusetts at the 
Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival, that long-held desire turned into an immediate 
objective. 
</P>
<P>
At the conference, Washington learned about "The Black Tradition in American 
Modern Dance," a project created by the American Dance Festival, an event held 
annually in Durham, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
Funded by the Ford Foundation, the project, now in its second year, aims at 
reviving and preserving works of prominent black modern dance choreographers -- 
particularly those without their own companies. It places the works in the 
active repertories of troupes chosen by each choreographer. As part of the 
project, these productions are eventually seen at the prestigious 55-year-old 
Durham festival. 
</P>
<P>
"Games" was the pilot work in the three-year, $300,000 project, but it was set 
on Chuck Davis' company in Durham in 1986 (as a kind of prologue to the 
Ford-funded activity), Washington learned. After that, it was not scheduled to 
be remounted. 
</P>
<P>
"That motivated me to go all out to try to get the work," said Washington, 
whose 9-year-old troupe performs mostly her own choreography. Adding a classic 
to her company's repertory "would give us more visibility on a national scale," 
she said. "It would help people to take us more seriously." 
</P>
<P>
So Washington approached McKayle, who also choreographed the hit Broadway 
musicals "Sophisticated Ladies" and "Raisin" and whose works have been danced 
by Alvin Ailey's company and others. She felt her company was at last strong 
enough to perform the piece and hoped the world-class choreographer would too. 
</P>
<P>
"The timing was good," said Washington, who had known McKayle for several 
years. "I asked Donald if he thought we could handle it now and he said yes." 
</P>
<P>
All that was left was financial backing, and the people at the local Brody Arts 
Fund, which supports multicultural projects, apparently liked the idea too, she 
said. They awarded her a $5,000 grant to mount the work. 
</P>
<P>
Washington talks a lot about the low visibility of all Southern California 
concert dance, a "huge problem" exemplified by the absence of West Coast 
troupes from the first two years of the "Black Traditions" project. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't know you exist and what you can do," she said, ascribing the 
dilemma largely to a lack of funds for national publicity and touring. 
</P>
<P>
So far, besides "Games," McKayle's "Rainbow 'Round My Shoulder" and "District 
Storyville" have also been included in the preservation project, along with 
dances by Eleo Pomare, Talley Beatty and Pearl Primus. The works were or are 
all being mounted on troupes from the South, the Midwest and the East. 
</P>
<P>
American Dance Festival director Charles Reinhart said that a desire to please 
each choreographer, not a concern for geography, has been paramount. 
</P>
<P>
McKayle said that though he has lived in Los Angeles since 1969, he didn't 
select Washington's present 12-member company for his works because it 
previously lacked enough dancers. 
</P>
<P>
Washington did not dispute this, nor does she blame anyone for the larger 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
"I just feel that the more people around the country -- especially those that 
do festivals or other projects -- that we can make aware of our existence, the 
better off we're going to be. . . . With greater visibility, we would at least 
have been considered for the 'Black Traditions' program." 
</P>
<P>
The idea of challenging her dancers to act and sing as well as dance 
particularly attracted Washington to "Games." 
</P>
<P>
Filled with every-day gestures from mock fist fights to a game of jump rope, 
the work has been performed by the companies of Alvin Ailey (his junior 
troupe), Eliot Feld, Los Angeles' Gloria Newman and the Inner City Repertory 
Dance Theater. McKayle ran the latter troupe in the early '70s, when the work 
was last presented here. 
</P>
<P>
During a recent rehearsal with Washington's company, McKayle, 58, said the idea 
for the dance emerged from childhood memories. One of them triggered "Terror," 
the final, sordid scene of police brutality. 
</P>
<P>
"I was 14 years old in the Bronx playing 'Steal the White Flag' and suddenly I 
heard one of the Puerto Rican kids yelling 'La Jura! La Jura!' which was a word 
for cop," he said. "The next thing I knew, a cop was hitting a kid. Then a 
squad car came and took the kid away." 
</P>
<P>
McKayle praised the troupe's execution of his choreography. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Games' needs youthfulness, it needs dramatic as well as movement ability and 
it needs a kind of absolute innocence of approach. It's a work the company 
definitely can do and do well," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Bates, 17, a four-year member of Washington's company, said it was "an 
honor" to be working with a prominent modern dance figure. "Since I started 
dancing, I've known about certain choreographers like Alvin Ailey, Arthur 
Mitchell and Donald McKayle." 
</P>
<P>
Reinhart, who initiated the "Black Traditions" project, lauded the Los Angeles 
collaboration: 
</P>
<P>
"If we've raised the consciousness one notch to the value of 'Games' and the 
project's other works, then we've been incredibly successful," he said.

RICK ASTLEY 
</P>
<P>
"Hold Me In Your Arms." RCA.** 
</P>
<P>
The second album by the British pop star features more of the pleasant but 
disposable dance/pop that marked his platinum debut last year. Astley, a Grammy 
nominee for best new artist, has a manly voice and a shy, courtly manner that 
make him seem like a clean-cut version of the randier George Michael. 
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old is a capable vocalist, as he proves on an earnest, soulful 
version of the Temptations' classic, "Ain't Too Proud to Beg." But too much of 
the album is filled with featherweight fodder that makes Europop confections by 
ABBA and the Pet Shop Boys seem heavy by comparison. 
</P>
<P>
The encouraging sign is that Astley had more creative input on this album than 
he did on his debut. He wrote and co-produced half of the songs, including the 
warm, melodic title track and the sassy first single, "She Wants to Dance With 
Me." And Astley's songs are more distinctive and interesting than the 
homogenized, assembly-line fluff by the British writing/production combine 
Stock-Aitken-Waterman, which crafted back-to-back No. 1 hits for the singer 
last year. If this teen heart-throb is to achieve any credibility as an adult 
pop star, he should break from his pop-minded mentors and work with producers 
who will encourage him to be more soulful and mature. PAUL GREIN

POPLINE: EXOTIC GLOBE-TROTTER

<TEXT>
<P>
"Did you think I was ugly?" asked the beautiful woman sitting on the couch of 
her hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
Well. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Blame the odd cover of her album, "Shaday," for prompting Israeli singer Ofra 
Haza to pose that startling question. Before meeting her, it wasn't clear what 
she looked like, since on that album-cover head shot, both hands are covering 
her face. 
</P>
<P>
"Surprised at how I look?" she asked, smiling devilishly. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, more surprised that Sire Records would put out such a misleading 
cover. When an unknown artist's face is virtually hidden that way, it's only 
natural to assume that image-conscious label execs were hiding a face that's 
not terribly attractive. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd hate for people to get the wrong impression about me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Haza, who just turned 30, is a beauty who is as exotic as her music. On this 
album, her first American release, she sings in Yemenite and ancient Hebrew as 
well as in English. Her single, "Im Nin' Alu," is a dance-club favorite. But 
her high, piercing voice is actually better showcased on some of the LP's 
ballads, like the spine-tingling, a cappella "Love Songs." 
</P>
<P>
Haza is such a big star in her country that's she's often called the Israeli 
Streisand. But in the past year, Haza, one of the hottest performers on the 
World Beat scene, has spent most of her time globe-trotting, drumming up 
interest in her album throughout Europe and parts of South America. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Israel to Yemenite parents, Haza, one of nine children, joined a local 
theater troupe for fun when she was 13. By her late teens she was the troupe's 
singing star and had already recorded the first of her 20 albums. 
</P>
<P>
In Israel, Haza is known for singing Israeli folk and pop songs. But she's 
attracted a worldwide audience since deciding a few years ago to add a dance 
beat to some of those traditional numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"The sound of those songs is strange and mysterious and intriguing to people 
outside my country," she said. "A song like 'Im Nin' Alu' is partly in English 
but most of it is in Yemenite. People don't understand the words but they like 
the music and the rhythms." 
</P>
<P>
Singing in English, as she does for the first time on "Shaday," has also helped 
broaden her audience. "It's not easy singing in a language, like English, 
that's not your own," she explained. "But I had to do it to reach more people. 
It was time for me to expand beyond my country, to taste more of the world. . . 
. " 
</P>
<P>
She smiled devilishly again. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . and to give the world a taste of me." DENNIS HUNT

POPLINE: PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS' SATIRE; OFRA HAZA SINGS IN ENGLISH; ROB BASE'S 
RED-HOT RAP

</HEADLINE>

<P>
One of the odder concert co-billings of the season is the tour which has the 
Pursuit of Happiness, a punchy Canadian rock 'n' roll quintet, opening shows 
for teen heartthrobs Duran Duran (including stops Feb. 2-3 at the Universal 
Amphitheatre). It's a cinch that when the band plays its current rock radio 
anthem, "I'm an Adult Now," most of the audience on hand for the headliner 
won't be able to relate -- at least not on a literal level. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the ideal headliner for singer/songwriter Moe Berg and his band to 
pursue on the road would probably be the Replacements. Both groups play feisty, 
strongly melodic hard rock, filtering the pop of their teen years (the '70s) 
through punk. And both the Pursuit's Berg and the Replacements' Paul Westerberg 
draw lyrical conflict out of having trouble acting their age -- mourning the 
passing of those carefree teen years even as they obsess at times on looming 
old age. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm an Adult Now" is "the story of having a certain melancholy about the 
passing of your youth -- but at the same time making fun of young people," said 
Berg, calling from chilly Toronto. "Because you have the experience to realize 
that there are a lot of stupid things about being a young person, but at the 
same time you're not in any hurry to grow up and are sort of lamenting the fact 
that you have to." 
</P>
<P>
One of the pitfalls of rock musicians growing up, as Berg sees it, is the 
dawning of a sense of "responsibility," as in "social consciousness." Berg is 
unapologetic about the fact that much of the material on the Pursuit's "Love 
Junk" -- one of last year's most impressive debut albums, produced by Berg's 
'70s hero Todd Rundgren -- candidly focuses on the title subject and its 
attendant concerns while so many of his contemporaries discover the Third World 
and such. 
</P>
<P>
In the album's best song, "Consciousness Raising as a Social Tool," Berg gently 
satirizes the "cause" mentality as a means for fulfilling the need to belong, 
believe or even just get dates. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing wrong with heightening people's awareness about issues, but 
most of these guys (in rock) have never even been to college, and all of a 
sudden they have the answer for the problem in South Africa. I consider myself 
of only medium intellect, so I'm not gonna tackle any subject that people spend 
30, 40 years every day of their life trying to figure out the answer to. Just 
because I have a forum as a rock musician and kids listen to us play doesn't 
necessarily mean that we have anything meaningful to say about a lot of 
different subjects. Your responsibility as a songwriter is to write good songs, 
and a bad song about South Africa is the same as a bad song about baby food."

"Electric Youth." Atlantic *** 
</P>
<P>
For her debut album, "Out of the Blue," Debbie Gibson swiped a cookie cutter 
from Madonna's dance-pop pantry and wound up rolling in dough. Gibson's trifle 
went triple platinum and turned her into a teen-age star rivaled only by that 
other suburban girl-next-door, Tiffany. But with "Electric Youth," Gibson, now 
18, leaves juvenilia behind and takes a giant step toward becoming a pop 
craftswoman.

Gibson still is no original: A good deal of "Electric Youth" fits into secure 
niches that the likes of Whitney Houston and Belinda Carlisle already have 
found quite cozy and lucrative. But the Long Islander, who writes and 
co-produces her own songs, wields formulas with enough zest to make most of the 
tracks on "Electric Youth" sound fresh for a song's-length moment. Far from the 
thin-voiced, one-note singer she was on her first album, Gibson comes off as a 
confident performer willing to take vocal chances and try on a wide range of 
styles. 
</P>
<P>
At her best, Gibson shows a healthy affinity for the past. "Who Loves Ya Baby?" 
and "Shades of the Past" display a crooning, belting high register that sounds 
like Michael Jackson in his Jackson 5 days. Echoes of the Supremes' "Someday 
We'll Be Together" resonate in the fetching love-note, "We Could Be Together," 
while "Silence Speaks" appropriates delicate touches from Renaissance chamber 
music. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of repeating the bland love cliches of her first album, Gibson sings 
from the authentic, if naive, point of view of a teen-ager impatient to find 
out what love and life have in store. Her outlook is appealing: forthright, 
optimistic, hungry for experience. While it is too soon to tell whether Gibson 
can grow into an adult artist capable of writing and singing in her own 
distinctive voice, "Electric Youth" finds her putting away the cookie cutter 
and turning out the productive tracings of a serious and promising apprentice.

THE JANUARY PAN: Who got the worst review of the month? The winner is . . . 
Guns N' Roses, whose "G N'R Lies" EP got blasted by Washington Post critic Mark 
Jenkins as a "platter of half-baked filler." Calling the group "corny" and 
"mawkish," Jenkins wrote: "Guns N' Roses is an acutely sentimental band with a 
reverence for cliche that would impress a Hallmark card copywriter." Assessing 
side one of the EP, which features four live songs first released in 1986, he 
says: "To hear these tired tracks is to develop a new appreciation for Geffen's 
A&amp;R department: only a professional prospector could have seen the 
commercial potential in these bar-band Aerosmith moves. . . . The solemnity 
with which they replicate early '70s hard rock is almost sad. Platinum album or 
not, these guys aren't rock's conquerors -- they're its victims."

BURNIN' DOWN THE HOUSE: London's latest controversial music craze in London is 
acid house (a delirious big-beat dance music, which has Brit teens bouncing off 
the walls (and popping LSD to fuel their frenzy). If L.A. has an answer-music, 
perhaps it's the city's new wave of psych-rock bands, who'll be on display at 
Lhasaland Feb. 11. The bill features Caterwaul, Shiva Burlesque, the Nymphs and 
Red Temple Spirits. . . . Cinemax recently taped a New Orleans special, "The 
Neville Brothers: Tell It Like It Is," which will air on the cable service in 
April. It stars the Nevilles, Buckwheat Zydeco, the Dixie Cups, the Dirty Dozen 
Brass Band, Greg Allman, John Hiatt and actor Dennis Quaid, who flew down from 
Memphis (where he's starring in "Great Balls of Fire," the Jerry Lee Lewis 
bio-film) for a sizzling duet with Bonnie Raitt on "Closer to You," a song 
Quaid wrote for "The Big Easy." But our vote for the night's most unusual guest 
star goes to CBS-TV newsman Ed Bradley, a major Crescent City music fan who 
sings "Sixty-Minute Man." . . . Kudos to KMPC-FM deejay Jim Ladd for being the 
only rock deejay in town with enough savvy social consciousness to offer a Rev. 
Martin Luther King Jr. Birthday tribute. On his Monday show, Ladd interspersed 
excerpts from King speeches with anthems like Patti Smith's "People Have the 
Power," Bruce Springsteen's "Chimes of Freedom," Bob Dylan's "I Shall Be 
Released" and U2's moving ode to King, "Pride in the Name of Love."

ART NEWS: DEVELOPING PHOTO ARTISTS AT LONG BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One takes pictures without a camera, the other paints over her pictures: For 
photography's 150th birthday, being celebrated at several Southern California 
institutions this year, the Long Beach Museum of Art has chosen to showcase two 
artists who eschew the conventional. 
</P>
<P>
"Enlarging the Repertoire," today through March 5, features works by 
experimental photographers Jerry Burchfield and Charlene Knowlton. They differ 
greatly in their approach and process, but are alike in their talent for 
innovation. 
</P>
<P>
Burchfield creates "Cibachrome monoprints," which, like all photograms, are 
made without a camera. He places objects directly on sensitized photographic 
paper and "literally draws with colored light to illuminate portions of a 
picture and cast colors here and there," the artist said. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was working with a camera, as I still do, I was dealing with 
reflections of things that were external," Burchfield said. "This way of 
working is much more personal. With a camera, either you find things and 
photograph them or you stage them. What I do, is I have a particular idea and I 
figure out an approach to expressing it and I work out some sketches, so that 
when I go into the dark (room), I'm working from some sort of preplanned idea. 
But I'm also working totally from instinct, and literally creating the image in 
the dark." 
</P>
<P>
Burchfield's small to large works "deal with human circumstance and political 
and social issues." 
</P>
<P>
Knowlton, whose background is in abstract painting, makes "painted 
photomurals." 
</P>
<P>
She first paints expressionistic backdrops, then places in front of them live 
models made to resemble "modern-day aborigines" whose bodies have been painted 
with "with beautiful, wild, abstract patterns," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She then photographs the set-ups, blows up the shot to mural size, and paints 
over the layered imagery, so that the final product hardly looks like a 
photograph. 
</P>
<P>
Showing a connection between the ancient and the new, her works, sometimes 
three-dimensional, also contain symbols of contemporary culture, such one which 
includes her 1966 Mustang. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, you react to (the works) immediately," Knowlton said. "They are not 
comfortable little things. And I couldn't do that with just paint. It would be 
romanticizing the whole thing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not so much that I want to push the limits of photography," she added, 
"it's just that I want to use anything I need (in order) to say what I have to 
say. It's where art is going at this point." 
</P>
<P>
LOCAL TAPE MAKERS: Five video works by California artists will have their debut 
in an exhibit opening today at the Long Beach Museum of Art: 
</P>
<P>
 -- "In Heaven There is No History," by Victoria Beardon, combines fact and 
fiction to explore cult brainwashing in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Let Me (Entertain You)," by Hilja M. Keading, scrutinizes television 
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Memory Slope Section: L.A.," by Lynn Kirby and Erika Suderburg, look at 
early Los Angeles history. 
</P>
<P>
 -- ". . . Once You've Shot the Gun You Can't Stop the Bullet . . ." by Jayce 
Salloum, of Lebanese descent, who looks at her own life and heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Blinky the Friendly Hen 1978-88" by Bruce and Norman Yonemoto, is "an 
allegorical documentary about the life and death" of Blinky, a press release 
says. 
</P>
<P>
The videos were produced through Open Channels, the museum's television 
production grant program, and will be shown on cable stations across the state 
following the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
PRINTS FOR SALE: A variety of prints from the 15th through the early 20th 
centuries will be sold Feb. 3-5 at the fifth annual Los Angeles Fine Print 
Sale, at Butterfield and Butterfield Auctioneers, 7601 Sunset Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty print dealers, including Los Angeles' Tobey C. Moss and Marilyn Pink, 
will offer woodcuts, engravings, etchings, lithographs and drawings. 
</P>
<P>
The fair runs 6-10 p.m. Friday, noon-8 p.m. Saturday and noon-6 p.m. Sunday. 
James Cuno, director of the Grunwald Center for Graphic Arts, UCLA, will 
lecture on two local master print collectors at 11 a.m. Saturday. Admission to 
the fair is $2 per day. 
</P>
<P>
FOR THE RECORD: The La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art has changed its spring 
schedule. "Peter Shelton: Waxworks," a show of 34 sculptural objects by the Los 
Angeles artist, April 7 to June 4, will supplant a survey of Jake Berthot's 
paintings, announced Jan. 8 in Calendar's 1989 preview of art exhibitions.

AT DC 3, WINE IS TOO GOOD FOR THE GLASSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At first glance, the wine list at DC 3 is impressive. Among its 150 wines are 
all the requisite things and more -- stuff like Angelo Gaja Barbaresco, Guigal 
Hermitage, Domaine de la Romanee Conti, Joseph Swan, Hanzell, Ridge and more. 
</P>
<P>
Some prices are fair; those at the lower register are marked up moderately, so 
you can find something that won't shatter your plastic. And even at the higher 
range, prices aren't out of line. 
</P>
<P>
Especially when you see 1971 Beaulieu Private Reserve ($50), 1975 Chateau La 
Lagune ($75) or 1966 Chateau Pichon-Longueville ($85). Pricing for these older 
wines is just a few dollars more than suggested retail. Another example: the 
1978 Chateau Cos D'Estournel is still commercially available and has a 
suggested retail price of $75; at DC 3 that bottle is $90. 
</P>
<P>
Now, that's impressive: older wines at fair prices. 
</P>
<P>
A good sprinkling of half bottles is also a welcome treat. On my first visit, 
we had half bottles of 1986 Edna Valley Chardonnay ($13) and 1986 Ridge 
Geyserville Zinfandel ($11). 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, I was impressed with the number of unusual items that were well 
chosen, things such as Ridge York Creek Petite Sirah, Long Riesling, Chalone 
Pinot Blanc, and even such a rarity as Chateau Grillet. 
</P>
<P>
If this is supposed to be a haven for the Beautiful People, the "in" crowd and 
the wealthy, Grillet is the perfect wine. It has a cult following, but to me is 
one of the best examples of idle idol worship I can think of. This is a wine 
that has little to recommend it except high price. Here it is at $110 a bottle; 
the Beautiful People will be happy. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the mere fact that DC 3 would put it on the list indicates it knows 
its clientele. 
</P>
<P>
But now let's look at other aspects of the equation. First, the list itself 
isn't easy on the eyes. It seems to have been printed on a poor-quality dot 
matrix printer using a small, condensed type. 
</P>
<P>
And the glassware. The red wine glasses we were offered were little 
five-ouncers -- they looked like 59-cent specials from the drug store. So much 
for the delicate nuances of aroma in such bowls. I asked for better glassware. 
Sorry, I was told, this is it. 
</P>
<P>
We opted instead to pour our red into the slightly taller, but not much better 
69-cent-style jelly jars that were used for the white wine. 
</P>
<P>
Then, there's the service: We ordered a half bottle of Chardonnay to match our 
appetizers. The wine came. So did an ice bucket. The wine was poured. Fine. 
Then 35 minutes elapsed. By the time our first food arrived, the wine was 
nearly gone. So much for matching wine with food. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the wine program at DC 3 left me feeling ambivalent. It's sort of like 
watching two superb dancers, where the man is doing the waltz and the woman is 
doing the fox trot. If the glassware and service here could ever get into sync 
with the wine selection, it all might come together. 
</P>
<P>
Until it does, fasten your seat belt, you're in for a rough flight.

NO CHUMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every time Calendar decides to play wiseacre trade paper by running a 
figure-oriented analysis, it turns out to be unreadable, boring and inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
The equations in Klady's article are of no interest to non-industry readers, 
but you at least should be accurate as you flippantly dump on the "chumps." 
</P>
<P>
I refer to the budget figure of "Memories of Me" (MGM), given as $12 million. 
It was less than half that, namely $5.8 million! (And don't tell me your number 
includes distribution expenses because there are many other picture costs 
listed which obviously don't include prints and advertising.) 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, at the $5.8-million budget, the financiers will probably not lose 
when all other revenue sources are counted. 
</P>
<P>
Neither the pictures that are unsuccessful nor the many people who make them 
are "chumps." The pictures are assets, and the people could make next year's 
box-office smash. The real "chumps" are you guys who rarely have an original 
thought, whose major "talent" is thrashing somebody else's creative effort.

BAMBI BUCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Though "Bambi's" re-release last year didn't cost Disney anything in terms of 
production, it ran up other costs that Leonard Klady overlooked ("Box Office 
Champs, Chumps," Jan. 8). 
</P>
<P>
Whenever a movie is reissued, it costs money to strike new prints, to 
distribute those prints, to run ads and TV commercials and to supply the TV 
review shows with clips. 
</P>
<P>
So, I have to ask: How much of the $38.1 million brought in by "Bambi's" 
re-release was used by Disney for costs? If those costs are figured into the 
budget-vs.-box-office ratio the same as for all the other movies, what will 
"Bambi's" place on the chart be then?

Lawrence Christon's article "Kim, the Savant Who Came to Hollywood," Jan. 8), 
while showing great knowledge of and sensitivity toward autistic people, also 
shows great ignorance about and insensitivity toward toastmasters. 
</P>
<P>
Toastmasters are members of the international, nonprofit Toastmasters 
International. The steps of our program include getting over nervousness, 
speaking with sincerity, varying one's voice, using body language, organizing 
thoughts, working with words, persuading people, speaking with credibility and 
inspiring people. None of these attributes could ever be brushed aside by 
describing a toastmaster as someone with a "heavy, over-loud voice . . . 
playing to a crowd."

SADNESS FOR A SEARCHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On reading Gregg Barrios' moving portrait of his long-lost heroine, Carol 
Ohmart, ("The Last Starlet," Jan. 1 and 8), I felt very moved -- and very sad. 
But my sadness was not for Ohmart. 
</P>
<P>
The actress' scapegoats were anything and anyone within reach -- she blamed her 
mother, the system, the Hollywood of the '50s, the producers. 
</P>
<P>
The real victim in this story of fading dreams and fallen stardom is the 
writer, Barrios. How let down he must have felt when he discovered that his 
childhood fantasy turned out to be anything but the pure beauty queen with a 
heart as golden as her yellow hair. What a shock to discover that the object of 
one's former fan club was a weak, bitter woman who delighted in turning her 
back on society and blaming others for her shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>
I'm sorry, Mr. Barrios. Instead of searching so long and hard to find the 
answer to "whatever happened to Carol Ohmart," I think it might have been 
better to let the sleeping dogs lie -- or in this case, an image that really 
stopped existing back in 1958.

IT MUST BE England's chilly climate that inspires so many handsomely designed 
sweaters. Duckworth uses all-over patterns (flowers, peacocks, ducks), lots of 
colors -- and tiny needles. But the book is more than a series of instructions; 
each chapter is introduced with a very pretty arrangement, and in the back of 
the book is a colorful spread of gloves. ($25) Judith Sims

HERE'S A SUITABLE topic for a psychologist: Why do so many people who have no 
intention (or at least an extremely remote possibility) of ever building a home 
find immense pleasure in looking at house plans? Those small blueprints, with 
accompanying drawings of stately entrances to single-story cottages, gargantuan 
estates or vacation hideaways, are irresistible to some of us. This hefty 
paperback volume offers 360 floor plans, including farmhouses and 
plantation-style mansions. Decisions, decisions. ($8.95) Judith Sims

FUJI GETS THE PICTURE -- IT WON'T OPEN A PHOTO LAB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By William K. KNOEDELSEDER Jr., Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Fuji Photo Film U.S.A. announced last week that it was indefinitely 
postponing the long-planned opening of its professional color film laboratory 
in Hollywood, the decision represented a stinging defeat for the large Japanese 
film manufacturer and a heady victory for a small local firm. 
</P>
<P>
A&amp;I Color Laboratory, located just two blocks from the site of the proposed 
Fuji lab, had conducted a yearlong campaign to stop the Fuji operation. 
</P>
<P>
A&amp;I's owners, David Alexander and Mamoru Ishihara, wrote dozens of letters 
-- to senators and congressmen, to then-Vice President George Bush, U.S. Trade 
Representative Clayton K. Yeutter, U.S. Ambassador to Japan Mike Mansfield and 
Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky. They wrote to the Federal Trade 
Commission, the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo and a score of other professional color 
labs around the country. They even wrote to Japan's prime minister, Noboru 
Takeshita, and to the Rev. Jesse Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
They accused Fuji of deceptive and unfair competitive practices, of unethical 
conduct and of betraying the American small businessmen who helped the Japanese 
firm gain a foothold in the U.S. commercial film business. 
</P>
<P>
Fuji Vice President Carl Chapman calls such accusations "absolute falsehood." 
</P>
<P>
"Fuji has never done anything deceitful," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The company says it was all a misunderstanding, fueled in part by simmering 
anti-Japanese sentiment in this country. In a statement released last 
Wednesday, Fuji said it decided to postpone the lab "rather than risk that this 
misunderstanding would affect Fuji's fine reputation." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Surprised at Victory 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a little shocked right now," Alexander said after learning of Fuji's 
decision not to proceed with the lab. "We never expected to win this. They had 
all the money and power, and all we could do was keep telling our story. This 
wasn't about business and competition, it was about what's morally right and 
wrong. And it's about a little guy fighting a giant." 
</P>
<P>
According to Alexander and Ishihara, the story began shortly before the 1984 
Olympics, when two Fuji representatives first showed up at A&amp;I, looking for 
help. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese firm was about to launch a major assault on the U.S. commercial 
film market, long dominated by Eastman Kodak Co., whose pioneering research and 
development in the film processing field had practically invented the industry. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Kodak enjoyed a virtual monopoly in photo processing, film and 
paper sales in this country, controlling an estimated 85% of the business. 
Fuji's share of the market was less than 5%. 
</P>
<P>
Fuji, however, had a contract as the official color film sponsor for the 
Olympic Games and a brand-new blimp to hover over the Los Angeles Coliseum and 
carry the company name into millions of American living rooms. 
</P>
<P>
What Fuji wanted from A&amp;I that day was assistance in making its film more 
palatable to the top rung of professional photographers, the men and women who 
produce the color pictures for magazine fashion layouts and ad campaigns, movie 
posters and record album covers -- A&amp;I's customers. 
</P>
<P>
"They came to us and said, 'Help us understand the America market, what 
American photographers want and appreciate. Please advise us about our film,' " 
said Alexander, himself a former professional photographer. "We didn't see any 
harm in that," said Ishihara. "They were a manufacturer, a supplier, and 
helping them produce a better film for our customers would benefit everyone." 
</P>
<P>
So, for the next four years, A&amp;I and other top professional labs around the 
country worked closely with Fuji technicians -- granting them access to their 
production areas, running countless tests on Fuji film, providing Fuji with 
samples of their customized chemical mixes for analysis, pushing Fuji products 
to their patrons and even giving Fuji lists of their best customers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strategic Thrust 
</P>
<P>
During that time, Fuji managed to double its market share to 10% of photo film 
and paper sales in the United States, according to B. Alex Henderson, an 
analyst for the Wall Street investment firm Prudential-Bache Securities. 
</P>
<P>
"Fuji has a history of well thought-out, planned and executed entries into 
various markets," Henderson said. "Their entry into the consumer film market in 
this country was a particularly adept move, a strategic thrust that really 
caught Kodak looking." 
</P>
<P>
Fuji's targeting of the professional lab community was a clever move. Kodak was 
concentrating its energies on the much larger and more profitable amateur 
photographic market and was virtually ignoring the professional segment, 
according to lab owners. 
</P>
<P>
"Kodak had become something of a complacent monopoly, and they were difficult 
to deal with," said one lab operator. "If you had a problem or a technical 
question for Kodak, they might get back to you in six months. But Fuji really 
wooed us." 
</P>
<P>
"Fuji figured that if they got the pros to use their products, the amateurs 
eventually would follow," said another owner. 
</P>
<P>
The plan apparently worked. Kodak responded to Fuji's inroads into the 
professional market by creating its own professional products division in 1985. 
Lab owners credit Fuji with making the industry more competitive and 
responsive. 
</P>
<P>
Fuji's relations with the color lab community began to sour last spring, 
however, after Alexander and Ishihara learned through industry sources that 
Fuji was planning to open up its own professional color lab just a stone's 
throw away from their own. 
</P>
<P>
"I was floored; I just couldn't believe it," said Ishihara, who says he'd 
formed a close friendship with one of Fuji's executives, Ted Nakagami, the head 
of the company's technical products division. 
</P>
<P>
"The same week they had people in our lab, examining film coming out of our 
dryers, they were negotiating to lease space up the street from us," said 
Alexander. "We helped them and they betrayed our kindness. They should have 
come to us like men in the beginning and told us what they were doing, instead 
of lying to us and having us find out about it on our own. It was a corporate 
policy of deception. That's what we are objecting to, not the competition. We 
welcome fair competition." 
</P>
<P>
Alexander wrote a letter of protest to Koichi Yasunaga, Fuji's executive vice 
president of U.S. operations. Written in the style of a Japanese fable, the 
letter was soon circulating among the professional lab community. It began: 
</P>
<P>
"A stranger knocks at your door telling you he is hungry. That seems true 
enough so you invite him in. You share your food with him. He eats ravenously, 
appreciatively. He bows in gratitude. You tell him how glad you are to share 
with him, as he continues to bow. Enjoying his company, you relax with him. 
Later, after he has left, you discover that he has stolen your pots and pans." 
</P>
<P>
"He (Alexander) is very eloquent, I'll give him that," said Chapman. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mystique of Planning 
</P>
<P>
Chapman takes issue with allegations that Fuji's "infamous visits," in 
Alexander's words, to professional color labs around the country were unethical 
and deceptive. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, contrary to Alexander's belief, there were no plans prior to 
September, 1987, to open a Fuji professional lab, Chapman said. "This mystique 
that because this is a Japanese company, then this all had to be carefully and 
secretly planned, is a lot of bull." 
</P>
<P>
According to Chapman and other Fuji executives, the lab was intended primarily 
as a technical research facility for new product development and testing. While 
they acknowledge that the lab would have taken in photo-processing business 
from professional photographers, they say it would not have actively solicited 
business and would have offered higher prices and slower service than other 
professional labs in the area, so as not to steal their business. 
</P>
<P>
The problem was, having learned of Fuji's lab plans after the fact and from 
sources other than the company, the professional color lab community just 
didn't buy Fuji's assurances. A number lab owners began retaliating by pulling 
Fuji products out of their businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Letters of protest streamed into Fuji's U.S. headquarters in Elmsford, N.Y. 
Fuji executives conscientiously answered each letter, but their polite, 
dispassionate replies only seemed to further anger the lab owners. 
</P>
<P>
"We are establishing our new lab not to compete with you, but to be able to do 
some of the necessary new product testing and development without burdening 
you," Yasunaga wrote in reply to one angry lab owner. 
</P>
<P>
To another: "Our new lab is intended to serve primarily as a test facility and 
model lab so that we can provide information to, and begin to return the many 
kindnesses of, our professional lab customers who have been so helpful during 
the launch of our professional photographic and photo finishing products." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Thanks a Lot' 
</P>
<P>
And to A&amp;I: "I hope I have assured you that it is not our intention to 
betray your past kindnesses, but to repay them." 
</P>
<P>
Alexander called the replies "insulting." Several others called them 
"doublespeak." 
</P>
<P>
"They were going to repay our kindness by opening up a lab down the street? 
Well, thanks a lot," said Ishihara. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews before Fuji's announcement last week, the anger among some lab 
operators was almost palpable. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe anything they tell me," said one lab operator who asked not to 
be identified. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't buy product from them or sell for them anymore. They are not welcome 
here," said Tommy Morgeson, owner of Dallas Photolab. 
</P>
<P>
"My comment is, if they want to be in the processing business, then I don't 
need Fuji at all," said Rex Jobe, owner of the Color Place in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
"I've told my people at the front counter to start pushing Kodak products," 
said Peter Miller, president of New York Film Works in Manhattan. "Now I have 
to approve any sale of Fuji products to a customer, and no Fuji representative 
can come in here without supervision and my approval." 
</P>
<P>
According to Miller, Fuji representatives originally came to his lab in the 
mid-1980s, "telling us we were the best lab in the world and saying they wanted 
to work with us." 
</P>
<P>
"They really knew how to manipulate people, being very nice and stroking your 
ego to get what they wanted from you. And I was a fool and opened up -- a 
normal fool, I guess, since it worked with a few others. They got help from me 
-- a lot of film processed for nothing, client lists, personal introductions to 
photographers. They were in here on a regular basis for three or four years." 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, I think I'd only let them in my place under armed 
surveillance," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
A number of lab owners said they suspected that the proposed Los Angeles lab 
was just the first step in a Fuji plan to enter the professional color lab 
business in a major way by opening similar labs in other cities -- a scenario 
that Fuji has flatly denied. 
</P>
<P>
"They are positioning themselves two blocks from the best and largest 
professional processing facility on the West Coast. I'd call that targeting," 
said David Ross, owner of Ross/Ehlert Photolab in Chicago. "It's scary to me 
because they came into my lab the same way they did David Alexander's, and if 
they were to do the same thing with me, I'd be screaming and yelling, too. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like very much not to believe they're going to open other labs," Ross 
said, "but I don't trust them very much and would be very apprehensive about 
letting them in here again." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Full Disclosure 
</P>
<P>
According to Arsenio Lopez, owner of the New Lab in San Francisco: "In the 
beginning, we welcomed Fuji with open arms," "We were one of the first labs to 
apply for a Fuji dealership. We placed an order for $4,000 worth of film and 
handed it out to our clients free of charge. 
</P>
<P>
"We cooperated with them so that we could be on forefront of knowledge of what 
their film did, thereby enhancing our position in the marketplace," Lopez said. 
"We showed them tests that we'd done, gave them a picture of how film was being 
used by our customers, fulfilled their every request, even pointed them in the 
direction of clients, going through our Rolodex and picking out the people they 
should see." 
</P>
<P>
Lopez first got wind of Fuji's plan for the lab at the Photographic Marketing 
Assn. trade show in the fall of 1987, he said. "Several people came up and told 
me that Fuji had purchased a big film processor, what we call a dip and dunk 
machine, the key component of a commercial lab. And they had selected one of 
the largest and best machines. I wouldn't think they'd need a machine like that 
for a research lab." 
</P>
<P>
Lopez said that when he confronted Fuji representatives at the show, "they said 
they knew nothing about it." 
</P>
<P>
Lopez told Ishihara what he'd learned, Ishihara went to Fuji's Nakagami and 
demanded to know what was going on "and he admitted that it was true," Ishihara 
said. "He said he was sorry, but he'd been ordered not to say anything about 
the lab," Ishihara said. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Mathiesen, Fuji's technical manager, called it "unfortunate" that news of 
the lab leaked out the way it did. "We had every intention of making a formal 
announcement and telling everyone at the same time," he said. "But some people 
just found out before we were ready." 
</P>
<P>
Mathiesen said the site of the Fuji lab was determined by the fact that 
Hollywood is the center of the photo lab industry in Los Angeles. "There are 20 
to 30 labs in the area and we wanted to be nearby so we could better serve the 
photographic community." The building two blocks from A&amp;I "was not even our 
first choice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The professional lab was to be just one part of the Fuji Film Professional 
Center, which opened in December. The $1-million facility also houses a 
technical communications center that provides information, seminars and 
training services to photographers and professional labs around the country, 
according to Fuji. Only the professional lab portion of the operation has been 
put on hold, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sensitive to Public Opinion 
</P>
<P>
In an interview at the professional center last week, Chapman acknowledged that 
it was the growing bad feeling among lab owners that caused the company to 
postpone the opening of its professional lab. 
</P>
<P>
"We were simply unable to convince the industry of our good intentions, and we 
didn't want to continue this verbal battle," he said. "We feel that we are a 
good citizen, that we are responsible and that we have been wrongly accused. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very sensitive to public opinion," he said. "And we know that the 
Japanese are taking some hard shots these days. Like the real estate thing. 
There are a lot of countries with more U.S. investment, but all you ever hear 
about are the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese are easy to dump on because they look different," said Chapman, 
who has worked for Fuji for 18 years. "I fought against Japan in World War II, 
so I have as much right to be anti-Japanese as anyone. But some of the letters 
I've read from lab owners and some of the things I've heard said make me 
ashamed." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, in interviews with lab owners, anti-Japanese sentiment surfaced time 
and again in phrases like "sneak attack" and descriptions of Fuji's tactics as 
"warlike." 
</P>
<P>
"We don't need to be pulling out swords and hand grenades, but that's how they 
act," said one lab owner. "And it's not just Fuji, it's all the Japanese 
companies." 
</P>
<P>
Another operator pointed out that he was talking to a Times reporter on Dec. 7. 
"This is Pearl Harbor Day," he said. "And that's what's happening here again. 
Only the scale is different." 
</P>
<P>
"People in this country can be so reactionary, and it's very painful for me to 
be associated with that sort of feeling," Ishihara said. "I'm a 
Japanese-American and my partner is a Jew, so we know all about prejudice. I'm 
a war baby. I was sent to a relocation camp with my parents when I was a 
toddler. I know what's it's like to be called a slant-eyed Jap growing up." 
</P>
<P>
However, both Alexander and Ishihara insist that it was Fuji's actions, not 
their protests, that stirred up already existing anti-Japanese feelings in the 
photographic community. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Peace Offerings 
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath of Fuji's decision to postone the lab, both sides appeared to 
be offering olive branches. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was a courageous decision on their part, and one I'm sure was not 
easy for them to make," Alexander said. "We think the technical communications 
center will be a very positive thing for Fuji and the entire industry. All we 
ever asked was that they not take in any commercial film business." 
</P>
<P>
"I can understand their concern," Chapman said. "They're just trying to protect 
their business." He conceded that the "timing" of the Fuji lab "was not great." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed," he said. "To spent 10 years trying to build a relationship 
(with the color lab community) and then lose it in eight months is not much 
fun, I can tell you that."

PLACING MORE MINORITIES IN ADS TURNS OUT TO BE HARD SALE 
</P>

<P>
With famous actors like Bill Cosby, Pat Morita and Ricardo Montalban on 
television pitching everything from brokerages to toothpaste, it seems that 
minorities have become all the rage on Madison Avenue these days. 
</P>
<P>
The ubiquitous Cosby is the most convincing pitchman on TV, according to 
surveys conducted by Video Storyboard Tests, a New York-based research firm. 
And one-time Chrysler pitchman Montalban, a Latino, and Morita, a 
Japanese-American who starred in "Karate Kid" and now promotes Colgate 
toothpaste, have also enjoyed wide visibility. 
</P>
<P>
Such celebrities may make it appear that minorities are enjoying wider 
acceptance in advertising. But a Screen Actors Guild survey suggests that the 
drive to improve racial and ethnic diversity in advertising has stalled. 
</P>
<P>
The report, published last fall, says that of the nearly 60,000 television 
advertising roles in 1987, 11.93% were filled by minority actors, down from 
12.28% in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
While the percentage has increased 45% in feature films and television 
programs, "ethnic performers may actually be slipping backward in TV ads," the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
And it's not just the overall statistics that are frustrating to civil rights 
groups, minority media executives and the actors themselves; it's also the 
kinds of ads that offer roles for minorities. 
</P>
<P>
Some kinds of companies, they say, particularly housing developers, Japanese 
and West German car companies and firms selling so-called upscale products -- 
rarely use blacks, Latinos or even Asians to promote their products. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the biggest need is to stop segmenting groups in our population" based 
on stereotypes, added Elaine F. Brodey, who heads a Screen Actors Guild program 
to utilize more minority actors in advertising. "Blacks can sell cars, 
Hispanics do have credit cards, Asians do not always speak a foreign language 
and Native Americans do not run around with feathers and a tomahawk in their 
hands." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disclaimer Required 
</P>
<P>
The lack of minorities in housing ads, for instance, drew some attention 
earlier this month when the NAACP and two other groups filed a lawsuit against 
the New York Times. They charged the newspaper with publishing real estate ads 
that almost always portray whites as potential buyers -- a violation of civil 
rights laws. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Washington Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights and the Open Housing 
Center of New York are pursuing the case, the NAACP withdrew from the suit on 
Jan. 13, noting that it had failed to follow its usual policy of consulting 
beforehand with targets of lawsuits. The newspaper said the lawsuit was 
"without merit," but the dispute mirrors similar complaints lodged against real 
estate ads in other newspapers, including the Washington Post and the Los 
Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Times now requires that real estate ads contain "a disclaimer 
that says 'models used in this ad do not reflect any racial preference' " to 
comply with federal equal housing opportunity laws, said Joan Heid, retail and 
general display advertising manager in The Times' classified department. A 
special logo depicting four ethnic groups -- Asian, Latino, black and white -- 
is also used in such ads, Heid said. 
</P>
<P>
Advertising agencies say they take seriously the need to show racial and ethnic 
diversity in the ads they create. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a contractual obligation (with unions) as well as a moral obligation 
to foster the use of minorities in advertising," said Dorothy Forget, a 
spokeswoman for the American Assn. of Advertising Agencies in New York. "We are 
very aware of our commitment. But I don't see that there's that far to go. I 
don't think we are discriminating" against minorities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Foreigners Preferred 
</P>
<P>
Some ad executives also say the absence of minorities in advertising is not 
always a product of racism and discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
"I think clients have been made overly sensitive as to how and when to use 
blacks because they are afraid of tokenism," said Lee Clow, president and 
creative director of Chiat/Day, the largest advertising agency in Los Angeles 
and the producer of scores of award-winning ads. "But I think the consumer is 
getting pretty sophisticated. The color barrier is breaking down." 
</P>
<P>
Shuji Okawa, a vice president at Hakuhodo America Advertising Inc., the Los 
Angeles-based subsidiary of respected Japanese agency Hakuhodo, says that 
because the Japanese are loathe to focus attention on themselves, they often 
use famous foreigners in Japanese advertising -- from heavyweight boxing 
champion Mike Tyson to actor Dustin Hoffman -- or no actors at all. 
</P>
<P>
That philosophy extends even to the U.S., where Japanese beer maker Sapporo 
shuns actors of any kind because it doesn't want them to detract from its 
advertising message, Okawa said. By contrast, spots for Miller, Budweiser and 
other American beers often use dozens of actors in barroom settings. 
</P>
<P>
"The characteristic we want to emphasize is the quality of the (beer), not the 
person," said Okawa, whose agency produces ads for Sapporo as well as ANA 
Airlines, NEC Corp. and other Japanese companies. 
</P>
<P>
Earl G. Graves Jr., Black Enterprise's vice president of advertising and son of 
publisher Earl G. Graves, said the advertising climate has improved since his 
father complained in an interview two years ago that Japanese consumer 
electronics companies were reluctant to advertise in black-oriented magazines. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the younger Graves said that, among some West German car makers 
and Japanese companies, there is still "a prejudgment that if a product is 
associated with blacks or minorities in general that it's not as good, not as 
upscale. Our readers have a median household income of $51,000, according to 
independent research. . . . But advertisers think the black market is an 
all-inclusive market" of consumers with similar tastes and income. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Minority-Run Agencies 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have any statistics (on advertising)," countered Michael Tsukamoto, 
director of the Electronics Industry Assn. of Japan, a New York-based trade 
group representing Japanese electronics companies. "But I don't think that we 
have any discrimination against minorities. It's always up to the companies 
which media to buy." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas McGurn, a spokesman for BMW, said he's unsure whether BMW has used 
minority actors because most BMW ads do not use live talent. However, a 
commercial for the BMW 6 series luxury coupe that ran last year showed a 
glamorous white couple in evening wear promoting the car. It was the sole 
national spot for the car, McGurn said. 
</P>
<P>
Such portrayals might be less commonplace if corporations hired minority-run 
advertising agencies that might avoid racial stereotypes, critics contend. 
Byron Lewis, chairman and chief executive of Uniworld Group Inc., a black-owned 
agency based in New York, says major corporations rarely assign minority 
agencies the responsibility of putting together an entire general market ad 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
To change such attitudes, the Screen Actors Guild has begun showing advertisers 
a 30-minute reel of commercials it says shows minorities in non-stereotypical 
roles. A Citibank ad shows a black credit cardholder telephoning a Latino 
customer service representative. A SAG spokesman said it is one of the few 
financial services TV ads with an entire ethnic cast. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Procter &amp; Gamble Co., the nation's biggest advertiser, has 
created a management position to coordinate ad placement with black-owned 
media. The move came after the National Assn. of Black-Owned Broadcasters 
claimed that P&amp;G spent only $2.5 million on advertising in black media 
annually, compared to $20 million in Latino advertising.

Charge! The cavalry rides again. And right in the nick of time. Just like on 
the old TV westerns, the U.S military is riding hard to stave off the bad guys. 
But with a new twist this time: Instead of Indians, the bad guys are the 
Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese, along with the South Koreans and the Taiwanese, already produce 
just about every TV product this side of the Hawaiian Islands. From the TV's 
computer chips, to the picture tubes, to the VCRs. So, on the current TV 
battlefield, America already has lost. The only American company still left 
making TV sets is Zenith, and it controls but a fraction of the market. 
</P>
<P>
And now the Japanese are taking aim at another target: the TV you'll be buying 
tomorrow. Our Asian competitors are in a good position to control the 
blossoming market of a whole new generation of TV sets called high definition 
television. HDTV is the wave of the future, a system by which larger, clearer, 
more beautiful TV pictures can be made. 
</P>
<P>
Go right up to your TV picture tube and take a look. Notice those little lines 
that run horizontally across the screen? On a small set, say under 21 inches, 
you might not notice the lines. But as with this year's autos, the newer TV 
picture tubes are growing bigger. And flatter. Researchers are now able to make 
the tubes as big as your living room wall and hang them as flat as a painting. 
</P>
<P>
When the picture tubes get really big, those lines on the screen stand out like 
a newly plowed field. Simply stated, HDTV fills in the spaces between the lines 
with more lines so you can hardly tell they're even there. The picture looks 
smoother, more like a photograph. And images can be made wall-sized without 
sacrificing quality. 
</P>
<P>
The only thing growing faster than the tube size are our competitors' 
(including the Europeans') research and development budgets, which aim to 
corner the market in HDTV technology needed to make the images. And if the 
winds of war don't change, all the American companies really can do is watch 
and wait for a generation of new technology to pass them by. The HDTV market 
will be gobbled up by foreigners hook, line and transistor. 
</P>
<P>
The situation is so bleak that last week, a group of America's largest 
technology companies announced that they are looking into pooling their 
resources to develop HDTV. Considering the fiercely competitive nature of the 
TV business, this unprecedented move is mighty neighborly of them. It's like 
San Francisco asking Los Angeles for help. But just how much information this 
consortium will share and how long it will take for an array of highly 
independent companies to unite their mental and monetary might remains to be 
seen. 
</P>
<P>
That's where the cavalry comes in. Because now the Department of Defense 
realizes that to be all that it can be, it will need to make use of HDTV 
technology. With theater-size images, a field commander can stand in a room 
miles from the front and direct the battle in living color without getting his 
feet wet. Or a pilot seated in a flight trainer can view a breathtaking image 
of the real estate he will attack and know in precise detail the color, shape 
and size of the terrain and target thousands of miles away. 
</P>
<P>
With television's potential to revolutionize warfare, the Pentagon can't sit 
back and wait for a defunct American TV industry to develop the breakthroughs 
in TV technology to make this dream come true. The Japanese are years ahead of 
American HDTV. So the Defense Department has decided to invest in developing 
the technology itself. And the hope is that it will drag American industry 
along with it. The Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or 
DARPA, is asking for proposals from manufacturers and research labs for the 
production of low-cost, high-resolution video displays. 
</P>
<P>
One company DARPA is looking at is Zenith. Already a supplier of computers to 
the Defense Department, Zenith makes a magnificent flat screen color picture 
tube for its 14-inch computer monitors. With DARPA's help, Zenith would like to 
scale up the picture tube with high resolution suitable for HDTV and military 
use. 
</P>
<P>
There is more at stake than just fancy TV pictures. Practical, high-resolution 
screens mean breakthroughs in the development of computer chips to run them. By 
developing the kinds of chips that would find use both in military and 
commercial HDTVs, DARPA also hopes to bolster the nation's computer chip 
industry. In essence, the military will be riding to rescue the American 
consumer electronics industry. As quoted in Broadcasting magazine, DARPA 
spokeswoman Jan Bodanyi said: "We are very interested in making sure that the 
domestic semiconductor industry is robust." 
</P>
<P>
So far, published reports put the Pentagon's budget for HDTV research at about 
$30 million. Critics argue that that is hardly enough to overcome the 
multi-year lead the Japanese have. Add a zero or two to that figure, and we're 
talking real commitment, they say. 
</P>
<P>
This won't be the first time that television gets a boost from the military. 
You can trace the roots of TV way back to the 1920s. But it wasn't a pretty 
picture. It took the mother of invention, World War II, to speed the 
development of radar. And as any aging TV repairman will tell you, television 
is radar's kissin' cousin. (He ought to know. What do you think those radar 
technicians did after the war?) 
</P>
<P>
This is a crucial time in the future of American television. Reopening an 
abandoned market is risky. No crystal ball, not even a high definition one, can 
forecast whether the cavalry will arrive with enough monetary might to save the 
day. As shooting wars wane, the battleground has become high technology.

TENDING OUR OWN GARDEN IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN FINGER-POINTING AT MARXIST 
ECONOMIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding Allan H. Meltzer's Times Board of Economists column on Jan. 8, "The 
Model is Market, Not Marxism": 
</P>
<P>
While it is certainly true that in many respects capitalism "has worked, not 
perfectly, just better than any alternative," this is hardly a justification 
for the questionable assertions made and self-congratulatory tone struck by 
Meltzer throughout his essay. 
</P>
<P>
First, Meltzer repeatedly refers to the "Marxist system" and applauds the fact 
that it is now in seeming decline -- at least in the nations he chooses to 
discuss. But what does he mean by the "Marxist system?" 
</P>
<P>
If he means simply "planned economies," then why does he not speak of the 
Danish, French, Norwegian and Swedish economies? Why not speak of Japan and its 
systematic integration of government agencies with investment banks and export 
industries? Aren't these all examples of planning? 
</P>
<P>
The point here obviously is not that Soviet-style planning hasn't been a 
failure in many cases. It certainly has. But how can one generalize from that 
experience to all other planning efforts, as Meltzer tries to do? 
</P>
<P>
Second, if the economies of Hong Kong, Taiwan, and South Korea have been such 
successes relative to East Germany, North Korea, and Poland, among others, does 
Meltzer seriously wish to suggest that those successes have not, in many cases, 
also involved enormous human costs? If the workers of Hong Kong have incomes 20 
times higher than their counterparts on the mainland, why does Meltzer not 
point out how those incomes compare to those achieved, say, in France, Japan, 
Sweden or even the United States? 
</P>
<P>
Why so heavy on the self-congratulations and so fast to condemn? Why not spend 
more time tending our own gardens and dealing with our own problems, rather 
than pointing the finger at others who are often doing the best they can?

COMPUTER RIVALS CLAIM U.S. CONTRACT RULES ARE 'WIRED' TO FAVOR IBM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH TUCKER, the Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two years ago the National Institutes of Health, planning to modernize its 
computer center, announced that it would award a contract worth up to $800 
million over the next decade, a large and important piece of business even by 
federal government standards. 
</P>
<P>
Bidding on such a complex contract can be expensive and time-consuming, so to 
encourage competition, the agency offered to pay $1 million to any losing 
bidder. 
</P>
<P>
Not just any computer company could bid on the contract. The company's size was 
a factor, as was its reliability and service. And because NIH had already 
invested heavily in computers made by International Business Machines Corp., 
any new equipment would have to be compatible with IBM operating standards. 
</P>
<P>
All that narrowed the field to a number of strong contenders, including Amdahl 
Corp., National Advanced Systems, Electronic Data Systems, Martin Marietta 
Corp. and Computer Sciences Corp. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, however, there was only one bidder: IBM. 
</P>
<P>
"They structured it like it was a competitive procurement, but basically it was 
a wired specification," said Sidney M. Wilson, vice president of PacifiCorp 
Capital Inc., a Reston, Va., systems integrator that designs complex computer 
systems and is familiar with NIH's computer operation. Wired, that is, for IBM. 
</P>
<P>
According to one official at Amdahl, the NIH contract specifications were "just 
loaded with terms and conditions favorable only to IBM. We said, 'Who's kidding 
who?' and we all dropped out. With that much money at stake, I don't think 
anybody would have walked if we thought there was a chance in hell that we 
could win it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Yen for IBM 
</P>
<P>
It is, increasingly, a loud and common complaint in the world of 
government-computer contracting. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the complaints may be sour grapes on the part of losing competitors. 
But circumstantial evidence also supports the claim that government computer 
managers, like many of their counterparts in private industry, have a yen for 
IBM. For taxpayers, the result may well be millions of dollars in higher costs 
and a slowing of technological innovation. 
</P>
<P>
That charge was aired publicly last month when six IBM competitors risked 
offending the world's biggest computer buyer and released a letter to former 
Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci in which they alleged that procurement 
officials routinely favor IBM in Navy contracts. Carlucci has issued no public 
response, but the Pentagon's inspector general has launched an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
In their letter, the six companies claimed that Navy technical personnel 
"consistently manipulate the procurement process to guarantee the desired 
outcome, an award to IBM," using a variety of techniques. 
</P>
<P>
Those techniques, they charged, include drawing up computer equipment 
specifications based on IBM products rather than on the government's actual 
requirements; delegating the procurement to a large integrator of computer 
systems or a minority firm acting as a "front" for IBM; overstating the scope 
of a requirement by awarding long-term contracts that shut out the competition, 
and modifying existing contracts to allow purchases of equipment for other 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Competitive Environment 
</P>
<P>
IBM refused to comment on the charges or to answer specific questions for this 
article. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a wide range of complex and complicated rules surrounding the 
procurement process, and we have no reason to believe that the government does 
not follow those rules," said Mark Holcomb, an IBM spokesman. "It is an 
intensely competitive environment, and there is an exhaustive protest process 
for people who disagree with contract awards." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, in the past few months alone IBM has lost competitions against National 
Advanced Systems and Amdahl for expensive mainframe computer systems at the 
Energy Department's Oak Ridge, Tenn., facility and at an Air Force finance 
center in Denver, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
But to hear it from others in the industry, including people who have no vested 
interest in one company or another, the NIH scenario is endlessly repeated at 
many agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Miller, president of Government Sales Consultants Inc., a consulting firm 
based in Great Falls, Va., said some of the worst offenders are the Army, the 
Navy, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the Central Intelligence Agency, the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Social Security 
Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Agriculture and 
Justice departments. 
</P>
<P>
For companies that believe they have been shortchanged in the bidding process, 
there is always the option of lodging a protest with the General Services 
Administration's Board of Contract Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
But many companies say they don't protest, fearing that they will anger 
agencies and needlessly ring up legal bills and other expenses that usually 
start at $100,000 per protest. 
</P>
<P>
Even before a contract is awarded, a different office within the mammoth GSA is 
charged with reviewing contract plans of the various agencies -- a process that 
is increasingly viewed as a "rubber stamp," said Jack Biddle, president of the 
Computer &amp; Communications Industry Assn., representing 60 major computer 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
Francis A. McDonough, deputy commissioner for federal information resources 
management at the GSA, conceded that during the past few years reviews have 
been streamlined and eliminated for agencies considered to be doing a good 
procurement job, an effort to cut paper work and increase efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
But with complaints building, McDonough said his agency will review a sample of 
large procurements more thoroughly. 
</P>
<P>
"We hear the people," he said, "and we need to move as times change." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Huge Sales Force 
</P>
<P>
Because so much of the government buying of mainframe computers is cloaked in 
national security, it is impossible to tell how many big machines IBM sells to 
federal agencies each year. 
</P>
<P>
Computer Intelligence, a La Jolla market research firm, estimates that IBM 
mainframes constitute 37% of the installed value of all of the government's 
computers worth more than $1.5 million apiece -- a conservative estimate, 
according to others in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
Still, that is nearly twice the market share of its nearest competitor, Amdahl. 
But it is significantly less than the 81% market share IBM claims in the 
commercial mainframe market, where there are no rules requiring competitive, 
open bidding. 
</P>
<P>
One reason IBM has been so successful in selling to the government is that it 
has so many people doing it. 
</P>
<P>
In the Washington area alone, where IBM sells the government everything from 
off-the-shelf equipment to complex mainframe systems, IBM employs 15,000 
people, according to Washington Technology, a local high-tech newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
That makes it the third-largest employer not headquartered in the region. In 
marketing strength alone, IBM outnumbers some rivals such as Amdahl by 30 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
According to PacifiCorp's Wilson, it is not simply the number of salespeople 
but the sophistication of sales techniques that set IBM apart. Over time, he 
said, IBM has cultivated close relationships with clients in the various 
agencies and is relentless in sowing "fear, uncertainty and doubt" about 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Influence From Top 
</P>
<P>
As Wilson portrays it, IBM salespeople ask customers, " 'How can you possibly 
do business with those people? They won't deliver. When they do, it won't work. 
When it breaks they can't fix it.' " 
</P>
<P>
"If all that stuff was true, would any of these people (Amdahl, Cray, NAS, 
Unisys) be in business?" Wilson asked. 
</P>
<P>
The tilt toward IBM works from the top down. 
</P>
<P>
A former naval officer handling advanced data processing awards, who spoke on 
the condition of anonymity, said there was great pressure from his commanding 
officer to structure the specifications of a contract to favor IBM. The officer 
said IBM's computer was not technically superior but was several million 
dollars more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
"My commanding officer was approached by IBM when they saw that I, as project 
manager, was not structuring a procurement which openly favored them. They 
invited the commanding officer to attend a weeklong session . . . at an ongoing 
forum IBM uses to lay out the IBM gospel," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Upon his return, the commanding officer told the officer to structure the 
specifications to favor IBM. The manager refused, and the contract was awarded 
to Amdahl for $2.5 million less than IBM's bid. 
</P>
<P>
"When IBM saw that I was not giving them preference, they made the typical 
sweep of going above me to my commanding officer to give them the feeling that 
I wasn't doing well," said the officer. "I was put on the carpet a couple of 
times defending my actions." 
</P>
<P>
For many computer makers, the competitive advantage over IBM has always been 
price. But lately, as computer system contracts have become more complex and as 
IBM has sought to minimize its price disadvantage, agencies have begun to 
consider factors other than cost. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Process Called Fair 
</P>
<P>
"The government has completely switched to including a lot of technical 
evaluations of a lot of non-cost issues," said Bob Dornan, vice president of 
the Federal Sources Inc. consulting firm, issues such as "management support, 
reputation of the company, availability of software -- a lot of things that are 
a little more nebulous but still are valuable factors that can have some 
impact." 
</P>
<P>
It was just such non-cost factors, written into the specifications, that scared 
off a number of potential bidders from the $800-million contract at the 
National Institutes of Health. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Naughton, the computer center director at NIH, said the process was fair 
to all players and that, upon their recommendation, many requirements were 
removed from the request for proposals the agency issued. Several companies 
discussed teaming together, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The merger fell apart for some reason I couldn't tell you," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"IBM . . . is completely integrated and thoroughly supported," he said. "You 
can generally depend on it. . . . Many other manufacturers have a habit of not 
performing." 
</P>
<P>
There essentially are two types of computer companies that complain of an IBM 
tilt. 
</P>
<P>
One group, including Amdahl, Cray, NAS and companies that use their equipment 
to assemble complex systems, makes equipment that operates on IBM's software 
standards and can work compatibly alongside an agency's existing IBM computers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Agencies Inventive 
</P>
<P>
The other group, which includes Digital Equipment, Honeywell, Unisys, AT&amp;T 
and others, uses different operating standards. They often are disqualified 
even from bidding on government contracts because IBM compatibility is written 
into the specifications -- even when compatibility does not appear to be a 
relevant issue. 
</P>
<P>
It is the second group that seems particularly disadvantaged in the area of 
government sales. Industry sources say agencies are infinitely inventive in the 
ways they come up with to demand IBM operating standards. 
</P>
<P>
When, for example, the Navy sought in 1983 to award a $400-million contract to 
upgrade a spare parts inventory tracking system based on an original Sperry 
Univac machine, it got three serious bidders -- Sperry, Honeywell and IBM -- 
each of which used a different software standard. 
</P>
<P>
But according to an official of one of the three companies, the Navy began 
writing software code for the new system on an IBM machine and informed Sperry 
and Honeywell that, should either be awarded the contract, they would have to 
include in their price a $5-million item for software conversion. 
</P>
<P>
"By going this subterfuge route, IBM had a $5-million leg up," the source said. 
Honeywell and Sperry never made a "best and final" offer, leaving the business 
to IBM and H. Ross Perot's Electronic Data Systems Inc., a systems integrator 
that used IBM hardware. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the General Accounting Office say they investigated the 
contract award and the use of the IBM system in the writing of software code. 
But protests by Honeywell and Sperry before that agency were rejected for 
untimeliness, according to an industry source. 
</P>
<P>
There perhaps are good reasons for the government's tilt toward IBM, none more 
important than to bring some degree of standardization to the government's 
disparate computer operations. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, in the early 1980s, the White House issued a directive setting 
compatibility as a top priority in government computer purchases. With the 
prompting of IBM, a number of agencies interpreted that as a official 
endorsement for the IBM tilt, according to Jack Biddle of the Computer &amp; 
Communications Industry Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The day may come before too long when all major computer systems will be 
compatible, much like stereos and turntables are today, through a process known 
as "open systems architecture." 
</P>
<P>
But between now and then, billions of dollars of government computers will be 
purchased -- and the preference for IBM mainframes is likely to persist. 
</P>
<P>
"The agencies are saying . . . 'I have a problem now and only IBM can fix it,' 
" Biddle said. "Later they are going to say, 'We can't go to your new open 
system because of the investment we have made in the IBM proprietary system of 
operation.' 
</P>
<P>
"If you have no competition, the taxpayer will ultimately pay the price, and 
the nation will lose the benefit of the creativity of the Amdahls and Unisyses 
of the world."

CHILDREN: VULNERABLE IN CALIFORNIA

Services in Pacoima.

What is the outlook for the 1.75 million California children who live in 
poverty? What is the outlook for the 36,000 babies born each year in California 
without the benefits of basic health care? What is the outlook for the 48,000 
California children who are in foster care? What is the outlook for all of 
California's vulnerable children and their families? 
</P>
<P>
In early December, the Senate Select Committee on Children and Youth, headed by 
Sen. Robert B. Presley (D-Riverside) held a hearing in Sacramento on the 
coordination of children's services in California. In light of the massive 
federal deficit -- and especially in light of the passage of Proposition 98, 
which raises education funding, possibly at the price of other human-services 
programs -- the subtitle of the hearing could have been "how to get along on 
less." 
</P>
<P>
The topic is not new to California policy-makers. Since 1970, both the 
legislative and executive branches have repeatedly addressed the lack of a 
comprehensive children's-services system. In 1987, the Little Hoover Commission 
issued two reports on children's services. The initial report pointed out that 
the California children's-services system spends more than $5.9 billion 
annually, excluding state funds for kindergarten through grade 12 education and 
"is in a state of utter confusion and disarray." The major finding of the final 
report states that there is a "lack of uniform state policy and well-defined 
organizational structure for providing children's services." Finally, at the 
Presley hearing on Dec. 7, a long list of witnesses testified on ways to 
improve coordination of California children's services. 
</P>
<P>
Why is it that almost 19 years of scrutiny has produced no real results? Why is 
it that in spite of outstanding individual efforts, services to vulnerable 
children are "in a state of utter confusion and disarray"? Why is it that 
one-fifth of all California children live in poverty, that we spend so little 
on prevention and early intervention services, that we continue to fund 
services that address single problems when we know so many of our vulnerable 
children have multiple problems? 
</P>
<P>
One answer to many of the above questions rests with what each of us thinks the 
role of government should be in providing protection and service to vulnerable 
children. Two other answers cannot be ignored. First, most of the opposition to 
past proposals has come from public and private agencies within the 
children's-services arena who fear losing existing funding resources or fear of 
losing influence or identity. Second, little leadership or initiative was shown 
by either the governor's office or the Legislature in developing a 
comprehensive system. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, the outlook is grim. But there are some signs of progress: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Assembly last year passed legislation that may show the value of 
allocating resources for early-intervention child-welfare services. AB 558 
provides for an experiment in three counties -- 10% of the foster-care 
allocation will be devoted to in-home services aimed at preventing family 
disruption, to see if the foster-care caseload can be reduced. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Thanks to the work of the Southern California Child Health Network, the 
value of funding prenatal health-care services is beginning to be recognized. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Ventura County Interagency Model and the San Bernardino Children's 
Services Network are providing examples of county coordination. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Los Angeles County Children's Services Planning Council may be a model 
to demonstrate an effective public-private sector partnership in planning and 
service delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Los Angeles Roundtable for Children is composed of leaders from public 
and private agencies, volunteer organizations and universities who are 
committed to working together to improve the lives of children and their 
families in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
The mission of the roundtable is to promote improved services and systems 
through research, education and public-policy recommendations. A major policy 
study conducted by the roundtable in May, 1986, on the "Children's Budget of 
Los Angeles County," highlighted the fragmentation of existing services and 
emphasized using all possible resources, increasing prevention and early 
intervention services and expanding public-private collaboration. The Board of 
Supervisors instructed the county's chief administrative officer to develop an 
implementation strategy for the report's recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A new statewide organization for children, Children Now, aims to focus 
public attention on the conditions of children and on ways to improve their 
chances for a healthy and independent future. And the California Children's 
Lobby has been working since 1971, in Sacramento and around the state, to 
improve conditions of child care and foster care. 
</P>
<P>
All of us have a stake in how California provides protection and service for 
vulnerable children. The high numbers of children in poverty, the lack of early 
intervention services in health and social services, the lack of child-care 
resources and the lack of comprehensive services for multiple-problem children 
have a direct negative impact on the economy of this state, on the future 
effectiveness of our work force and on the safety and security of our 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
Lisbeth B. Schorr, in her superb new book, "Within Our Reach" (Doubleday), is 
painfully eloquent on this point: "High rates of violent juvenile crime, school 
failure and adolescent child-bearing add up to an enormous public burden as 
well as widespread private pain. Our common stake in preventing these damaging 
outcomes is immense. We all pay to support the unproductive and incarcerate the 
violent. We are all economically weakened by lost productivity. We all live 
with fear of crime in our homes and on the streets. We are all diminished when 
large numbers of parents are incapable of nurturing their dependent young and 
when pervasive alienation erodes the natural sense of community." 
</P>
<P>
If there is to be progress, we must, as citizens and taxpayers, let our 
legislators know that we want increased government resources to be directed to 
vulnerable children. Within the children's-services arena, public and private 
organizations must be willing to re-examine their perspectives. Finally, the 
governor and the Legislature must begin to exercise creative leadership.

<P>
Hart Lee Dykes, a wide receiver for Oklahoma State's football team, recently 
completed a unique sports grand slam. Four schools -- Illinois, Oklahoma, Texas 
A&amp;M and Oklahoma State -- were penalized for violations committed while 
attempting to recruit him. 
</P>
<P>
There is nothing new about college violations involving athletes (for years, 
players from major colleges in the National Football League have joked about 
the pay cuts they had to take when they turned pro). But recent events have 
brought the problem to the fore again. 
</P>
<P>
A casual observer might wonder, "Who cares?" Unfortunately, for most of its 
history, the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. has also been in the "who 
cares?" ranks. The NCAA's laissez-faire attitude has harmed coaches, schools, 
players and fans alike, by creating an atmosphere where all involved believe 
they can win only if they cheat. 
</P>
<P>
On the surface, college athletics have never been better. Athletes perform much 
better than they did even a decade ago. Games are faster and more exciting. The 
business side is also flourishing -- revenues generated by college sports are 
staggering. 
</P>
<P>
Beneath the surface, however, all is not well. Every day seems to bring another 
story about a college penalized for recruiting violations. The big money now 
available to schools for TV and postseason appearances has made it much more 
tempting for schools to ignore rules to land a big recruit. Coaches are under 
tremendous pressure to win. 
</P>
<P>
Top prospects among high school athletes quickly learn about the free-market 
economy. They are free agents, literally able to sell their services to the 
highest bidder, as was Dykes. The recruiting violations in such cases can be 
outright payments, or "signing bonuses," to the player, gifts to the player or 
members of his family, free use of rental cars and phone credit cards, among 
other inducements. The basic idea is to make the player a deal he can't refuse. 
Payments and gifts may continue throughout the player's career. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, top players are often not as outstanding in the classroom as 
they are on the football field or basketball court. Many schools take steps to 
allow star athletes to meet entrance requirements or to stay eligible. Schools 
have been caught falsifying transcripts and entrance-test scores, falsifying 
grades, pressuring professors to change grades and supplying other students to 
take exams for athletes who are poor students. 
</P>
<P>
Outstanding athletes are given special treatment early on. A top player quickly 
learns there are two standards, one for regular students and one for him. He 
begins to expect special treatment. He doesn't have to worry about studying 
because he knows someone will take care of his grades. 
</P>
<P>
Having been actively involved with the NFL Players Assn. for more than five 
years, I saw the negative effect this double standard can have on the athlete 
when he is no longer able to play. Suddenly, he is thrown into a world where he 
receives no special treatment and for which he is ill-prepared. 
</P>
<P>
Because of this double standard I support the NCAA's recent passage of 
Proposition 42 -- the amendment to the NCAA bylaw known as Proposition 48, 
which set minimum admission standards for student athletes. Where Proposition 
48 allowed freshmen who only partially met the standards to receive 
scholarships, while losing a year of eligibility, Proposition 42 would ban 
financial aid for partial qualifiers, starting in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
I believe, however, that Proposition 42 should be phased in over a period of 
years, to allow current high school athletes time to meet the new standards. 
</P>
<P>
Many coaches, most notably Georgetown's basketball coach, John Thompson, have 
been critical of Proposition 42. They argue that the new rule (which prevents 
schools from giving scholarship money to athletes who score below 700 on the 
Scholastic Aptitude Test and have less than a 2.0 grade-point average) is 
discriminatory. Despite these arguments, I believe Proposition 42 will help 
cure many of the problems that exist in college sports today. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 42 sends a signal to all athletes: They must perform in the 
classroom if they want to play college sports. It treats the athlete like any 
other student applying to college. It helps eliminate the double standard for 
athletes and will force all athletes to prepare for their post-athletic 
careers. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA should also reinstate the freshman ineligibility rule, which would 
help players by giving them more time to concentrate on academics in their 
first year and would ease the transition from high school to college. 
</P>
<P>
A high school player who cannot meet the minimal standards of Proposition 42 
should probably not be in college. Typically, such a student is frustrated by 
college and merely puts in time waiting to be drafted. A player who does not 
meet the standards can attend junior college, improve his skills and later 
attend college. It is easy to forget that colleges are institutions of higher 
learning, not training grounds for the professional leagues. 
</P>
<P>
All indications are that the NCAA has finally decided to come to grips with the 
problem of recruiting violations. Last year the association hired Dick Shultz 
as its executive director. Shultz had previously been the athletic director at 
the University of Virginia, where he ran a clean and competitive program. He 
has beefed up the NCAA's enforcement division and promised severe penalties for 
violators. 
</P>
<P>
But resolution will not come easy, so deeply ingrained are these practices 
among many major schools. Traditionally, the NCAA has only penalized its member 
institutions, not individual coaches or players. The NCAA's theory has been 
that coaches and players come and go, but the institution remains, so it is 
logical to penalize the institution. I believe for the NCAA's sanctions to be 
successful, it must penalize coaches and players. 
</P>
<P>
Some argue it is unfair to penalize the head coach because so many of the 
violations are out of his control. They point to gifts and payments by 
overzealous alumni and violations by overeager assistant coaches as examples of 
violations that are beyond the responsibility of the head coach. I find this 
argument unpersuasive. 
</P>
<P>
First, there is no excuse for a head coach not being aware of all violations 
involving his program. He is responsible for the entire program and he is the 
person to ensure that it is run cleanly and fairly. If a coach realizes that 
violations may cause him to be suspended for two years, he will take an active 
role in ensuring that the program is clean. 
</P>
<P>
A scene that has become all too familiar recently is the head coach who commits 
numerous violations, gets wind of pending NCAA penalties and leaves for a new 
position just before the penalties are announced. In this situation, the NCAA 
should suspend the coach and prevent him from coaching at any NCAA school for 
the period of the suspension. 
</P>
<P>
Individual athletes should also be personally responsible for their role in 
these violations. 
</P>
<P>
In many situations, the athletes are exploited by their schools -- used only 
for their physical abilities and forgotten when they are injured or can no 
longer play. In the recruiting process, however, the athlete is usually not a 
blameless victim. The athlete knows it is against the rules to accept money but 
freely accepts because he realizes there is little chance he will ever be 
penalized. 
</P>
<P>
The recent case involving Dykes is good example of how the athlete can have it 
all, despite the violations -- the money and four years of eligibility. Dykes 
would have thought twice about accepting money, if it put his eligibility at 
risk. 
</P>
<P>
The Dykes case also points out the NCAA's need for better investigative 
techniques. In order to gather information concerning the recruiting 
violations, the NCAA struck a deal with Dykes, promising him immunity from any 
penalties if he agreed to talk. He got to play his senior year and four schools 
were penalized. That the NCAA had to resort to this kind of agreement with a 
player indicates how difficult it is to get information from the schools. The 
NCAA must develop its own information-gathering techniques -- perhaps even 
going undercover -- if it is going to be successful in detecting recruiting 
abuses. 
</P>
<P>
Fans must remember that college athletics is only a part of our educational 
system. The lessons learned through sports -- dedication, teamwork, the ability 
to deal with victory and defeat -- are worthy ones. However, we are cheating 
today's athletes if we do not insist they get the education to use these 
characteristics in the real world.

'THE SAVINGS SCANDAL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The editorial "The Savings Scandal" (Jan. 12) is a well-intended analysis of 
the crisis facing the federal deposit insurance system. However, the editorial 
leaves the misguided impression that the nation's surviving, well-run savings 
institutions have not paid their fair share in trying to resolve the funding 
shortfall of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. and that they can 
afford to increase their support of the FSLIC. In fact, quite the opposite is 
true. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, savings and loans have paid more than $4 billion in 
special assessments to the FSLIC and had their investment of $823 million in 
the FSLIC secondary reserve taken away by fiat. And through their ongoing 
contributions to the FSLIC, the savings and loans are responsible for covering 
FSLIC's recent outlay to resolve the worst problem cases. 
</P>
<P>
The special assessment you suggest enlarging already causes thrifts to pay 2 
1/2 times more for deposit insurance than commercial banks. This very special 
assessment was responsible for pushing more than 100 otherwise healthy 
institutions into insolvency in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, why should Great Western or Home Savings of America, two of the 
strongest financial institutions in the nation, pay more for deposit insurance 
than Bank of America or Continental Illinois? These and 2,000 other healthy 
savings institutions in America continue to focus their lending activity on 
residential mortgages, among the safest of all investments -- not loans to 
foreign governments or to corporate raiders cashing in on the leveraged-buyout 
craze. 
</P>
<P>
Your conclusions, regrettably, are based on false assumptions. The broad 
diversification of savings and loans away from their historic mortgage 
financing function simply did not happen as you suggest. In fact, today only 2% 
of savings and loan assets are in non-real estate commercial loans, while 62% 
of assets are in residential mortgages -- a number that has not changed in 
several years. 
</P>
<P>
We also agree with you that there is no obligation to bail out investors, 
stockholders or failed managers. The public obligation is to protect the 
depositor, as the Congress has guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
The California League of Savings Institutions agrees with The Times that every 
effort should be made to ensure that the crisis facing the federal deposit 
insurance system is not allowed to occur again, and we are actively pursuing 
every avenue to help resolve this crisis. We fundamentally believe, however, 
that it is poor public policy -- and not in the public interest -- to break the 
backs of healthy, profitable savings institutions to achieve this resolution.

MAKING A DIFFERENCE; 
</P>
<P>
CHICO MENDES . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The people who killed Francisco (Chico) Mendes last month probably thought that 
they were ridding themselves of a problem. Instead they created a world-renowed 
martyr to the cause that he championed -- saving the vast and endangered rain 
forests of the Brazilian Amazon. 
</P>
<P>
Mendes had worked to protect the Amazon forests and their indigenous people for 
the last 12 years as the leader of a union of rubber tappers in Brazil's Acre 
state, an isolated region that borders on Peru and Bolivia. The tappers are 
forest dwellers who harvest natural latex from trees in the Amazon jungles to 
make rubber. Their work does not normally harm the forests, because the tappers 
give the trees enough time to replenish before the next harvest. 
</P>
<P>
The organization that Mendes helped them create has fought for the 
establishment of forest reserves in the Amazon where the tappers are free to 
work without encroachment by ranchers, who prefer to burn down the trees to 
make room for cattle grazing. Without official reserves, many tappers have been 
subject to intimidation by ranchers and other would-be settlers of the Amazon. 
As in the Wild West days of the United States, there is sometimes violence 
between ranchers and tappers. Mendes was aware of this, and traveled with 
bodyguards as a result. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities in Acre have arrested several suspects in Mendes' shooting death, 
including a prominent rancher and his two sons. While some press reports from 
the isolated state have suggested that Mendes died as a result of a personal or 
family dispute, his fellow environmentalists in Brazil are convinced that he 
was murdered to stop his work. They are demanding that the Brazilian government 
thoroughly investigate the killing. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps more important, Brazilian environmentalists are using Mendes' death to 
galvanize public opinion in Brazil and to educate their fellow citizens about 
the danger that uncontrolled development poses to the Amazon -- the last great 
rain forest on Earth and a resource for the entire planet. A Brazilian 
colleague of Mendes in the environmental movement said recently that Mendes' 
death sparked "the first mass movement in defense of the Amazon." If that 
movement prods the Brazilian government toward greater efforts to protect that 
region and its rain forests, Mendes will not have died in vain.

... AND PHIL SOKOLOF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1966 a Nebraska metal manufacturer named Phil Sokolof suffered a severe 
heart attack, becoming one of the more than 1.5 million Americans stricken that 
year. Sokolof, then 43, was lucky; he survived. He also went on to make a lot 
of money, and to develop an interest in the link between diet and heart 
disease. A few years ago Sokolof founded the National Heart Savers Assn., for 
which he supplies almost all the funding. Late last year the association bought 
full-page newspaper ads that accused major food-manufacturing companies of 
"poisoning" consumers by using coconut and palm oils in many of their products. 
The ads drew a lot of public and corporate attention; at least one food company 
threatened a lawsuit. Now, though, the threats have disappeared. Phil Sokolof 
has pretty much won his crusade. 
</P>
<P>
Last week Sokolof announced that he had been told by General Mills, Ralston 
Purina, Borden, Pillsbury and Quaker Oats that they would soon start replacing 
the coconut and palm oils in their products with vegetable oils containing 
unsaturated fat. Earlier four other food companies -- Kellogg, Sunshine 
Biscuits, Pepperidge Farm and Keebler -- had said that they would stop using 
the tropical oils. Coconut oil, palm oil and palm-kernel oil don't themselves 
contain cholesterol, but -- like beef tallow, lard and butter -- they are 
saturated fats. The consensus of health authorities is that consumption of 
saturated fats causes the body to produce more cholesterol than it needs, 
raising the risk of heart disease. Sokolof says that his goal is to extend 
lives by doing what he can to reduce this risk. 
</P>
<P>
Tropical oils became attractive to food companies because they are cheap, 
produce smoothertaste and texture, and promote shelf life. Sokolof was by no 
means alone in attacking them. The American soy industry has run ads in 
food-industry publications for the last few years citing the health dangers of 
oils high in saturated fat. The ads seem to have been effective. Palm-oil 
imports have dropped significantly. At the same time, various popular health 
publications have written about the risks of all saturated fats -- including 
tropical oils. 
</P>
<P>
Some nutritionists contend that removing tropical oils from crackers, cookies, 
coffee cakes and other snack foods will produce no more than a minor reduction 
in the overall consumption of saturated fats. Probably they are right, but the 
answer to their argument is that making the American diet healthier is and will 
remain an incremental process involving education, product substitution and 
moderation. So every bit of risk-reduction helps. A lot of food companies have 
been quick to find palatable alternatives to the tropical oils. The big losers 
are the Third World countries, Malaysia most notably, that have come to depend 
on the U.S. market for their tropical-oil exports. Here is a problem where 
American private or government-sponsored research to find alternative uses for 
tropical oils would be most welcome. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a modest but still significant shift toward healthier snack-food 
products is under way. A lot of considerations have gone into the decisions to 
make that shift. Pretty clearly one of them was the campaign, truly a cry from 
the heart, that Phil Sokolof sponsored. In our big, complex and bureaucratized 
society, here was indeed a case where one person made a difference, and where 
an idea had definite and beneficial consequences.

CHALLENGE TO PROP. 13 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Proposition 13, the 1978 law that has kept the property-tax bills of long-time 
California homeowners low by shifting the tax burden to newcomers, may be 
vulnerable to constitutional challenge. The U.S. Supreme Court, in striking 
down the method of taxation in a West Virginia county, said that the 
Constitution requires "rough equality in tax treatment of similarly situated 
properties" -- a principle that Proposition 13 violates, on its face. 
</P>
<P>
We would welcome the dismantlement of Proposition 13, either by the courts or 
by the voters. As should be apparent to all Californians, even those happily 
paying 1970s-vintage taxes, Proposition 13 and its companion tax-revolt 
measure, the 1979 Gann limit, have been devastating. The state's public 
schools, highways, parks and other public services have deteriorated. Voters 
have reacted to traffic congestion and poor schools by opposing further 
development and erecting barriers to the construction of badly needed new 
housing. Proposition 13 also has centralized fiscal authority in Sacramento, 
where local authorities unable to raise property-tax revenues have looked for 
bailouts. And, with tax increases virtuallyoff limits as a fiscal tool, the 
state is financing improvements through bond issues, going deeper and deeper 
into debt. 
</P>
<P>
Courts, of course, cannot overturn laws simply because they are disastrous; 
what makes Proposition 13 open to legal challenge is its many inequities and 
anomalies. Proposition 13 set the property-tax rate at 1% of assessed valuation 
and froze assessments for existing homeowners at 1975 levels, furnishing 
instant relief to Californians angry that their property taxes sometimes 
exceeded their mortgage payments. But there were built-in inequities: While 
assessments for pre-1978 homeowners could rise only 2% a year, anyone who 
bought property after that paid taxes based on the purchase price and, in the 
real-estate boom of the 1980s, could find himself paying 10 times as much in 
property taxes as his neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
And the inequities don't end there. Cities and counties unable to raise 
property taxes now impose "impact fees" on developers to cover the costs of new 
streets, sewers and schools associated with new homes; these fees, averaging 
$11,807 per house in 1987, are passed on to home buyers. So a young family 
struggling to make a down payment on a newly constructed house may end up 
paying not only heftier property taxes but also impact fees -- and, in essence, 
subsidizing public services for what one author, Edmund L. Andrews, has called 
a "low-taxed landed gentry." 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who still believes that he has benefited from Proposition 13 should 
consider another anomaly: The major beneficiaries have been not homeowners but 
businesses. Commercial property changes hands less frequently than homes, so 
many businesses are still paying pre-Proposition 13 property taxes. One study 
suggests that, in the first five years after the law was enacted, individual 
homeowners received just one-third of the total tax relief; the lion's share 
went to owners of commercial and industrial property. 
</P>
<P>
It is far from certain that the courts will over-turn Proposition 13; it 
represents not the practices of a single county assessor, as was the case in 
West Virginia, but the preferences of an electoral majority. The ardor behind 
California's tax revolt appears to be ebbing, however; one public-opinion poll 
found 71% of the people willing to pay more taxes to improve public services. A 
legal challenge to Proposition 13 would make Californians face up to its 
inequities and force the Legislature to consider alternatives more palatable 
than tax relief for the few. A split tax roll that repealed the benefits of 
Proposition 13 for commercial property owners but not homeowners has been 
proposed, though its long-range economic effects are unknown. Or the entire law 
might be repealed, with exceptions made only for low-income, elderly homeowners 
in danger of losing their homes if the assessments on their paper profits 
suddenly jumped. Whatever the solution, reconsideration of Proposition 13 is 
overdue.

DEATH OF HIROHITO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The death of Emperor Hirohito finished the list of political and military 
leaders of the World War II era, one of the darkest and bloodiest eras of 
history on either the European or Asian continents. 
</P>
<P>
The political and military role that Emperor Hirohito played before and during 
the war was never clear to us. He may not have had that kind of influence now, 
but before the war he was regarded as god and was worshiped in Japan with 
religious vigor. At the surrender of the Imperial Japanese government, Hirohito 
was spared punishment because "it was his ambitious military generals who made 
the decision to invade the neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
I found it is very hard to believe that a man in his middle age, in his 
position, in his culture and in his country at that time had nothing much to do 
with all the military aggravations that his armies imposed on neighboring 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, some Japanese military leaders were executed after the war for 
criminal acts they were responsible for. I often wonder if Hirohito ever felt 
grateful to those generals who were sacrificed, in part, so that he could live 
for another 43 years. I only wish that the soul of Emperor Hirohito be ready to 
face the ultimate justice when he meets with the waiting souls of millions of 
innocent men, women and children who were tortured and murdered in his name 
during the war.

HOMELESS FUNDS

<TEXT>
<P>
I want to clarify your article "United Way Assails Distribution of U.S. Funds 
for the Homeless" (Metro, Jan. 5). During the press conference and subsequent 
media contacts on Jan. 4, the point was made that I was speaking as the chair 
of the Local Emergency Food and Shelter Board, which is responsible for the 
distribution of $4 million in federal funds earmarked for this program in Los 
Angeles County, and not in my position as president of United Way. 
</P>
<P>
As chair, my comments reflected the sentiment of the Emergency Food and Shelter 
Board and not necessarily those of the United Way. 
</P>
<P>
Quickly now the Emergency Food and Shelter Board will meet to discuss what 
actions will be required to increase Los Angeles County's share of Emergency 
Food and Shelter Program funds. More than likely the United Way along with 
other partners on the Emergency Food and Shelter Board will be asked for 
support. And, I am confident support will be forthcoming.

SHORT TAKES: A CHIP OFF THE OLD TYPEWRITER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK RORABACK 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It is the stuff of fairy tales: A father wins a prestigious award for a book he 
has written. Two years later, his son wins the identical prize for a book he 
has written. And they all live happily ever after. 
</P>
<P>
The citation is the Newbery Award, given to the author of the year's best 
children's book. The father is Sid Fleischman, 68, Santa Monica writer who won 
the '87 Newbery for "The Whipping Boy." ("They had them, you know," Fleischman 
says, "boys who took spankings for a naughty prince who couldn't be punished 
physically. They had whipping girls, too.") The son is Paul Fleischman, 36, now 
of Pacific Grove, '89 laureate for "Joyful Noise" -- read-aloud poems about 
insects. "Astonishing," Sid says. "A father-son first." 
</P>
<P>
"It was about 12 years ago," Sid recalls. "Paul was home from college. One day 
he came downstairs, threw some pages on the couch and said, 'I've written a 
story.' He'd never written before. It was good. He sent it to Harper &amp; Row. 
They published it! He's been writing ever since." 
</P>
<P>
Is writing in the genes? Sid has no idea, but "I never pushed him. My father 
was appalled at my decision to become a writer. He was afraid I'd starve. I 
knew Paul had a gift, though. For my birthday, he'd give me original similes. 
Once he made me a little 'plotting board': You'd spin the arrow and get a 
character or a problem or a plot. 
</P>
<P>
"Often, at dinner, I'd say, 'Kids, I have this character in a spot and I can't 
figure how to get him out,' and they'd make suggestions. And, of course, Paul 
had been around writers all his life, heard writers' talk, and I guess he had 
to feel, 'This is kind of a nice life.' His father never had to get up in the 
morning and shave and go to work; just sit at a typewriter in his robe." And 
write prize-winners. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
He's a Man of True Grit 
</P>
<P>
At 32, eight years on the road including some really tough gigs, Dave Hutson 
qualifies as a genuine rock star. You can catch his act in South America, 
Europe, all over America. This spring Hutson opens in Los Angeles. At the zoo. 
</P>
<P>
Hutson works out of Tucson, for the Larson Co. He has been here since May, 
creating the framework for the new $8.3-million Children's Zoo, to open in late 
April. Hutson and a crew of 21 have built a rather splendid mini-mountain, a 
kingdom of caves, waterfalls, tidal pools, the works. Stone by stone. As in 
nature, no two alike. 
</P>
<P>
"We work either from molds, taken from actual rocks from all over the world," 
Hutson says, "or from scratch." Either way, it's painstaking work, duplicating 
textures, colors, veins; using dental tools, tiny chisels, mineral-colored 
paints. "Then we put 'em together like a puzzle. After a while you get a feel 
for the flow. You have to be artistic, know your geology, your 
</P>
<P>
zoology," Hutson says. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not so much for the kids -- how many are going to say, 'Look, Mom, 
there's a South African kudu on a North Dakota rock'? -- as it is for 
ourselves, mostly for the animals. When you first make the model, you think, 
'How can I contain the animal, yet make it interesting, exciting enough so he 
doesn't get bored in the exhibit?' 
</P>
<P>
"Studies show that animals do a lot more reproducing in a more natural 
environment. Hopefully, what we create is close enough that they'll still go 
for it." 
</P>
<P>
Hutson -- "I didn't exactly grow up wanting to make rocks; I just kind of fell 
into it" -- enjoys the work, loves the animals. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to get a high esteem for an animal when it's behind bars, like a 
prisoner," he says. "In their own habitats you feel more comfortable with our 
partners on Earth." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Hot Time in the Old Town 
</P>
<P>
They started building the fire truck -- the one Nora Page is going to ride on 
-- in 1943. The war interrupted delivery. Finally, the flaming-red engine -- "a 
Peter Pirsch, one of Culver City's first pumpers," driver-chief mechanic Bob 
Lewis says -- was finished in 1947, the year Nora turned 53. Both fire engine 
and Nora are still going strong, one putting out fires and the other starting 
them. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Lewis and crew will pick Nora up at Country Villa South, a West 
Los Angeles nursing facility for the elderly; pop a helmet on her head and 
siren her down to Culver City for a bit of a celebration and a citation as one 
of the city's oldest residents. Or at least Nora hopes so. "You never know," 
she says, "but if I make it to Jan. 26, that'll be 95 years of hell-raising." 
</P>
<P>
Has Nora ever ridden on a fire engine? "Are you kidding? I was born on one. Dad 
was a fireman in Springfield, Ohio, then in Culver City. He'd be home for 
dinner, the bell would ring and off he'd run, me right behind him. Never missed 
a good fire in those days." 
</P>
<P>
"The fire wagons were pulled by horses. Nothing to hold onto either. I'll never 
forget one day: I'm up with the firemen and starting down the pole to go home 
when the bell goes off and here come the horses. Me still on the pole. I almost 
lost my (backside) . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I tell you, I haven't missed much in my life, nothing worth doing." 
</P>
<P>
And after the ride to Culver City? "We're having a little party," she says. 
"Going to Chippendale's." DICK RORABACK

VICTIMIZED BY COMMENTS IN THE SEXUAL ABUSE STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The article in the View section, "Sexual Abuse: When Men Are the Victims" (by 
Kathleen Doheny, Jan. 10) was informative and no doubt served to broaden the 
scope of thought and understanding concerning this sensitive issue. 
</P>
<P>
However, there were comments made in the article that I found to be 
irresponsible, (coming as they did from members of professions devoted to 
assisting the healing of sexually abused people) and which were offensive to me 
as a woman. 
</P>
<P>
In reference to the assertion that sexual abuse has a greater effect on men 
(than women), social worker Peter Dimock is quoted as saying, "Abuse of women 
doesn't call into question their femininity." What ideal does Dimock apply to 
femininity, I wonder? 
</P>
<P>
Being feminine embraces qualities of strength, bravery and self-protection that 
are surely called into question when abuse has occurred. Questions such as 
"What could I have done to prevent the encounter?" or "Why did I let this 
happen to me?" are all possible responses from one who is feminine. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Lew, a Boston therapist says, "We have a place in our culture for women as 
victims." I find this statement appalling. Lew seems to have overlooked the 
fact that more than half the members of our culture happen to be female. Does 
it make sense to think that we, as females, would provide ourselves with a 
place in which we are victims in our culture?

DIETITIAN IN THE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I write in reference to an item that appeared on Jan. 8. This was a small 
question-and-answer item entitled "Medication, Changes in Diet Help Combat High 
Blood Pressure" by Dr. Neil Solomon. 
</P>
<P>
The question related to discontinuing blood pressure medication after a 
normalized pressure was achieved. I believe Solomon did well to recommend 
advice from a physician prior to making such a change, and to advise a diet and 
exercise program. 
</P>
<P>
What Solomon failed to do was to recommend the counsel of a Registered 
Dietitian for assistance. Many people believe they have reduced their sodium 
intake, but are unaware of hidden sources of sodium in our diets. The aid of a 
qualified nutrition professional is helpful in developing a dietary regimen. 
</P>
<P>
As an example, in a typical McDonald's lunch consisting of a Big Mac, a 
chocolate milkshake, French fries and an apple pie, the public may be under the 
impression that the shake and pie are OK, while the burger and fries would 
contribute more sodium to the meal. While the burger is indeed highest in 
sodium (979 mg.), the pie comes in second (398 mg.), the shake third (300 mg.), 
and the fries have the lowest sodium content in this meal (109 mg.).

NON-JAPANESE CUSTOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In regards to the article "The Turning Point" (by Itabari Njeri, Jan. 1) about 
the Japanese-Americans' concern over their culture's future. As a 
third-generation Japanese-American, I found this article to be somewhat 
overblown. 
</P>
<P>
My father was in a relocation camp and my parents are Buddhists. I'm 
non-religious. My wife and I do not observe any Japanese customs in our 
household and we will not force our two small children to attend Saturday 
morning Japanese-language school as many of our peers were forced to do by 
well-meaning parents. 
</P>
<P>
My children will most likely marry Caucasians and our grandchildren will be of 
mixed blood. We will not pressure them to marry in the same ethnic class as 
many Nisei and Issei parents have done to their children. Our major concern is 
that our children grow up happy and successful. If they want to learn about 
their heritage and culture, they will do so on their own.

AN ACT OF KINDNESS IN 1933 IS STILL REMEMBERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB O'SULLIVAN, O'Sullivan is a travel writer based in Canoga Park. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to Webster, nostalgia is "homesickness" or "a longing for something 
far away or long ago." So this is not nostalgia, because I certainly don't want 
to go back to either the scene or the time of the incident that follows. 
</P>
<P>
But I think what took place that hot afternoon in 1933 in New Mexico is worth 
sharing. 
</P>
<P>
A friend, who had just finished reading an article I wrote about being on the 
road in the '30s, reminded me of it. 
</P>
<P>
In that story my mother, my sister and I were traveling across the country from 
Denver to California in the family car, an old Essex. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Money Would Be Waiting 
</P>
<P>
Trying to get the jump on winter, we had started without having enough money 
for the trip, but my father had promised faithfully to wire money at some of 
the cities along the way. He said he'd have $25 waiting for us at the Railway 
Express Office by the time we got to Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
In the story I pointed out that when we got to Albuquerque the promised money 
had not arrived, so my mother "made do" and we continued to California. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, wait a minute," my friend said. "What do you mean by your mother made 
do?" Twenty-five dollars in the '30s was almost two weeks' pay. If she was 
counting on it and it wasn't there, how'd she swing it? How could she possibly 
"make do"? 
</P>
<P>
"Well," I answered, "that's not the story I started out to tell." 
</P>
<P>
The answer seemed to satisfy him but it didn't satisfy me. I got to thinking 
about it. A woman with two children in a car packed to the windows with 
personal belongings, almost out of gas and stuck in what was then a small town 
in New Mexico in the depths of the Depression. How had she made it? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Childhood Memories 
</P>
<P>
It's funny -- sometimes somebody accidentally nudges a door you'd forgotten was 
even there. It swings open and the memories come flooding through. 
</P>
<P>
It was hot and dusty and late afternoon as my sister and I waited for my mother 
to come out of the Albuquerque Railway Express Office. 
</P>
<P>
When she did, she was very upset. She stopped on the steps of the loading dock 
for a few seconds, wiped her eyes, came to the car and got in. 
</P>
<P>
"Was it there?" my sister asked. She was 11 or 12 at the time. Not exactly an 
adult, but old enough to help with the worrying. Mother shook her head and put 
on her driving gloves very slowly and very carefully. 
</P>
<P>
When I asked if we could get something to eat she didn't answer for a moment. 
Then she said, "Of course we can. We have to, don't we?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Low Voices 
</P>
<P>
She drove about two blocks along the railroad tracks to the Harvey House 
restaurant and took us inside. It was a huge dining room, smelling of good 
things to eat and almost empty. 
</P>
<P>
When a waitress came over to show us to a table, mother took her a few feet 
away from my sister and me and spoke to her in a low voice. The waitress 
listened and then went to the kitchen. She came back with a man who was wearing 
a suit. 
</P>
<P>
He and my mother talked for a few more moments. He nodded and led us all to a 
table, where he pulled out a chair and seated my mother. My sister and I sat on 
either side of her. 
</P>
<P>
"What would you like?" the waitress asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps sandwiches for the children," my mother said, "and I'd like a cup of 
coffee." The girl was starting to write it down when the man put his hand over 
her order book. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Handsome Order 
</P>
<P>
"Why don't you let me order for you?" he asked. Then, not waiting for an answer 
from my mother, he told the girl we would all start with hot soup and then we'd 
have the beef stew, mashed potatoes, bread and butter, and coffee for the lady. 
He asked my sister and me if we wanted milk or hot chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
We both said, "Yes, sir!" 
</P>
<P>
"Milk and hot chocolate for the children and some of the cobbler all around. 
Does that sound all right?" 
</P>
<P>
"Will that be all?" the waitress asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh," the man said, "and these people are the guests of Mr. Fred Harvey." 
</P>
<P>
I saw my mother say thank you, but I didn't hear her voice. 
</P>
<P>
The taste of the rich brown stew is still with me, though I've had a million 
meals since that one. 
</P>
<P>
And thinking about it still brings up the picture of that immense restaurant, 
so clean it looked as if it had been polished, and the waitresses -- the Harvey 
girls, with their bright smiles, puffed sleeves and starched aprons. They 
rustled when they walked. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Real Hospitality 
</P>
<P>
When the last of the cobbler was gone and we rose to leave, my mother pushed a 
couple of coins toward the waitress. The girl pushed them back with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh no, ma'am. You're Mr. Harvey's guests," she said and placed two bags in 
front of my mother. 
</P>
<P>
"The manager said I was to wrap up what you didn't eat, so you could take it 
along." 
</P>
<P>
"But we cleaned our plates," I said. My sister sighed and looked at me as if I 
was the stupidest person in the world. First the waitress, then my mother, then 
all of us got the giggles. Mother picked up the sacks and we left. 
</P>
<P>
In the car, mother and my sister looked into the bags, which clearly contained 
a greater volume of food than we'd had for dinner. 
</P>
<P>
"What's in them?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Loaves and fishes," mother said. "Loaves and fishes." 
</P>
<P>
That evening she swapped some of our personal possessions for a tank of gas and 
a room in an auto court. 
</P>
<P>
There was no money at Railway Express the next morning, either, but for some 
reason things didn't seem so bleak or so frantic. 
</P>
<P>
As we were passing the Harvey House on the way out of town, my mother pulled to 
the side of the road for a moment. "Some day," she said, "when you two grow up 
I want you to go to a Harvey House and order the most expensive thing on the 
menu and then I want you to leave a big tip." 
</P>
<P>
We both said we would. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Money Was Waiting 
</P>
<P>
There was a money order waiting for us in Yuma. I don't think it was $25, but 
it was enough to get us the rest of the way to the relatives we'd be staying 
with in California. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of the fact that Fred Harvey's long gone now and the last Harvey girl 
is probably married and celebrating her grandchildren or great-grandchildren, 
and Harvey's restaurant chain has probably changed hands a dozen times or more, 
I think I'll check and see if there are any still around. 
</P>
<P>
And if I find one, I'll stop in, order from the top of the menu and maybe 
finish with a little cobbler and a cup of coffee. Then I'll lift my cup: 
"Here's to you, Mr. Harvey."

THE SAVVY TRAVELER: SOME COUNTRIES OFFER BARGAIN PRICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER S. GREENBERG, Greenberg is a Los Angeles free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As you begin making preliminary travel plans for next summer, you may be 
pleasantly surprised. 
</P>
<P>
Americans have become much more sensitive to travel costs, and their travel 
choices are reflecting that concern. For example, the number of Americans 
visiting the United Kingdom in 1988 was about the same as 1987. 
</P>
<P>
For 1989 that figure is not expected to grow. Why? In a survey conducted by 
Ogilvy &amp; Mather, an advertising agency, only 38% believed that Great 
Britain is cheaper than other countries in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
With the dollar still weak against the pound, the United Kingdom is in the same 
category as France and Italy, relative to expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, many Americans have adjusted their trips accordingly. The trend started 
last year with some surprising travel choices by Americans. The biggest 
surprise was to the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
"Tours to Egypt were booming," says Robert Cazian, owner of R&amp;H Voyage in 
Glendale, a company that specializes in Middle East travel. "In 1987 hardly 
anyone went, and our business dropped off more than 60%. But 1988 saw a 
dramatic turnaround." 
</P>
<P>
Operators such as Cazian had trouble accommodating everyone who wanted to go to 
Egypt. It was nearly impossible to get space at most Cairo hotels, and it was 
impossible to get berths on Nile River cruises. 
</P>
<P>
Indications are that this trend will continue through 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Tour operators offer a variety of Egypt trips -- the more traditional Pyramids 
and Luxor, as well as the Sinai and St. Catherine's Monastery. 
</P>
<P>
A changing aspect of Middle East travel is the move toward individualized 
itineraries with firms like Abercrombie &amp; Kent offering first-class trips 
to Egypt. (One R&amp;H itinerary features a private dinner trip on the Nile 
aboard a felucca.) 
</P>
<P>
Turkey also has become a hot destination. Europeans have known about Turkey for 
years, but until this year most of the Americans who visited did so on one-day 
stopovers via cruise ships or they were backpackers. 
</P>
<P>
This year the flow to Turkey is due to its not being expensive. It has one of 
the best -- and one of the most unspoiled -- seacoasts. It has one of the best 
charter yacht fleets in the world and has a rich cultural heritage. Also, the 
people are great. 
</P>
<P>
But don't look for promotions and advertising. Instead, many major hotels and 
resort developers are putting their money into construction and development. 
</P>
<P>
Hotels (including a Regent) and elegant restaurants are being built, and 
tourism is slowly becoming more sophisticated. 
</P>
<P>
Many luxury tour operators also are combining Turkey with Egypt in one tour. In 
addition, more cruise lines are exploring Istanbul as a destination. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expanding Europe Service 
</P>
<P>
Some international airlines are investigating both Istanbul and the resort city 
of Izmir as new destinations. Some, like KLM, offer good connections and 
attractive air fares from the United States via Amsterdam. 
</P>
<P>
Many of these airlines also areconsidering flying into numerous U.S. gateway 
cities to expand European service. 
</P>
<P>
During the next few months Portugal and Spain will join Turkey as hot 
destinations. Both of these countries have always been terrific alternatives to 
the usual European itineraries of England, France and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Tourism to Portugal and Spain is growing, and with good reason. The dollar 
simply buys you more, and both national airlines are marketing attractive tour 
packages. 
</P>
<P>
TAP, the Portuguese airline, begins service to Los Angeles in April. 
</P>
<P>
Iberia, the Spanish airline, now has flights out of Miami, Chicago and Los 
Angeles to Madrid, in addition to its regular New York City service. Flights 
from Los Angeles are now nonstop. 
</P>
<P>
An example of the bargains: Iberia is offering a one-week trip to Madrid or 
Spain's Costa del Sol with hotel rates at $5 a day. 
</P>
<P>
Here's the deal: Buy an inexpensive APEX ticket from New York City to Madrid 
and Iberia will virtually host you for a week for $5 a day. This includes daily 
breakfast, hotel taxes and service charges. It's available through March 18 
from Petrabax World Tour Operators. Call toll-free (800) 367-6611. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
American Airlines 
</P>
<P>
But Iberia isn't the only airline that flies from the United States to Spain. 
TWA and Pan Am fly there, too. And American Airlines has started service from 
Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
American is also rapidly expanding its European route network, but along 
nontraditional routes. "If someone is going to the South of France," says 
spokesman Tim Doke, "then why do they have to fly through Paris?" 
</P>
<P>
Already, American flies from Chicago to Manchester, England, for those folks 
who don't like to go through London. And on May 1 American begins service from 
New York City to Lyon, France. On the same day the airline begins flying 
between Chicago and Stockholm. On May 12 American starts flying to Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
American's New York City flight to Brussels will continue to Hamburg, West 
Germany. And the Chicago-Brussels flight will fly on to Duseldorf. That will 
increase American's European routes to 13 cities and 119 flights a week. 
</P>
<P>
Swissair has decided on California as its sixth U.S. destination and will begin 
service in November between either San Francisco or Los Angeles and Zurich. 
</P>
<P>
There are also great bargains in Latin America, an area expected to become the 
destination of the 1990s. Already South America has experienced a major cruise 
ship boom. In 1987 only four or five ships visited. In 1988, 14 ships cruised 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Brazil is touting the Pantanal, an incredible wetlands wilderness. Ski trips to 
Chile will be advertised, as well as adventure trips to Patagonia. 
</P>
<P>
South American airlines will help make it happen. Six carriers have begun 
promoting in-country air passes, great ticket deals that allow inexpensive 
travel within a country once you get there. 
</P>
<P>
Aerolineas Argentinas offers a "Visit Argentina" fare. You can buy a pass good 
for three cities in 14 days ($199) or unlimited cities in 30 days ($299). 
</P>
<P>
Avensa, the Venezuelan airline, offers an air pass with unlimited stopovers in 
Venezuela. And the airline will even throw in Aruba. The one-week pass is $110, 
two weeks will cost you $125 and three weeks is $139. 
</P>
<P>
Varig offers the Brazil Airpass, with an unlimited number of flights and 
stopovers for 21 days, for $330.

FROM DESERT TO CANYONS ON THE SANTA ROSA TRAIL

RANCHO MIRAGE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a rough dirt road in canyonlands in the Santa Rosa Mountains, above 
Coachella Valley desert communities, Desert Off Road Adventures offers Jeep 
safaris. 
</P>
<P>
The three-hour safaris were tested beginning last March, hauling guests of the 
new Ritz-Carlton Rancho Mirage hotel. Now the safaris are available to anyone. 
</P>
<P>
From the lower desert, the safari route bounces, curves and dips into canyons 
where the vistas are the same as they were for the Cahuilla Indians in earlier 
times. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1970s, desert entrepreneur Michael Dunn of Rancho Mirage bulldozed 
a dirt road with the hope that it would lead to a mountainside hotel. The hotel 
never materialized and the dirt road remained Dunn's Road, which he often had 
to restore after canyon floods. 
</P>
<P>
When the Ritz-Carlton first opened on 24-acres last March, guests were welcomed 
by two, bronze, bighorn sheep, which roam beside a natural stone fountain. 
</P>
<P>
Guest rooms had valley and mountain views, art and antiques, and marble 
bathrooms. Dining was under crystal chandeliers. A 10-court tennis club was 
perched above its own canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Since the hotel doesn't have it own links, guests were transported to nearby 
desert golf courses. Enter a Seattle transplant named Mary Thomas, who left her 
marketing job at the Ritz-Carlton and joined Bruce Mercey in a partnership that 
expanded Mercey's just-born desert safari company to include five customized 
Jeep Scramblers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Private Road 
</P>
<P>
We began our safari from the Ritz-Carlton. After a short drive through 
Cathedral City our driver turned off Cathedral Canyon Road and unlocked the 
gate to the private Dunn Road. 
</P>
<P>
The gleaming four-wheel-drive Jeep had a rollbar, a fire extinguisher, a 
first-aid kit and seat belts for the half-a-dozen passengers facing each other 
on the two padded benches. 
</P>
<P>
Dunn's dirt road is an adventure in itself -- rocky, curving sharply, dropping 
abruptly down a bank steep enough to be a ski run, then scrambling up again. 
</P>
<P>
The driver was an expert. We soon braced automatically as spectacular cliffs 
and canyons absorbed our attention. The road is entirely within Dunn's 
property, skirting but not violating the ancient Indian oases, national park 
lands and the Big Horn Sheep Preserve. 
</P>
<P>
We stopped frequently, studying many varieties of cacti. We saw how rock 
formations were cracked and shaped by frost wedging, and how the earth settled 
into an angle that is maintained on steep mountainsides. 
</P>
<P>
Summit rocks exposed to millenniums of sunlight have turned dark. Newly cracked 
rock formations add lighter colors to the mosaic. Century plants wave high 
above cactus and manzanita. 
</P>
<P>
Centuries ago the Cahuilla Indians spent their summers in these cool mountain 
canyons after wintering around the warm natural waters around Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
Because of their affinity for the hot waters, the Spaniards named them the Agua 
Caliente Indians. 
</P>
<P>
Now the Andreas, Murray and Palm canyons are part of Agua Caliente lands. Their 
hiking and horseback trails and picnic grounds are accessible daily at the end 
of South Palm Canyon Drive in Palm Springs for $3 admission, 75 cents for 
children. The equestrian cost is $3.50. 
</P>
<P>
The Jeep safari covers a trek of nearly 20 miles. From a 4,800-foot lookout 
point, we could see across the desert to the Salton Sea. We stopped for lunch 
in a grove of 200-year-old palm trees. 
</P>
<P>
Dunn is carving another road on his property so that a round-trip Jeep tour can 
cover the views from each side of the canyon loop, with frequent stops for 
short walks. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Condon, founder of the "Save the Santa Rosas" environmental group, said he 
believes that the Jeep tours don't adversely affect the environment. 
</P>
<P>
His organization plans to sponsor a local ballot initiative next spring to 
limit and control development in the Santa Rosas, and to preserve them as a 
natural background for the lower desert and its communities. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Three-hour safaris are $55 per person through Dec. 31, $60 through June 15. A 
minimum of five people is required. Liability insurance of $750,000 per person 
is included. For more information and reservations, contact Desert Off Road 
Adventures, P.O. Box 4528, Palm Desert 92261, (619) 773-3187.

THE MATURE TRAVELER: FLORIDA HOTELS, TV TOURS HEAD LIST OF BARGAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL HUGHES, Hughes is a 30-year veteran travel writer living in Sherman 
Oaks.

<TEXT>
<P>
Though many California motels and resorts offer discounts, special promotions 
and package plans for mature travelers, those in Florida always seem to offer 
more. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Vacation Hotels, for example, offers a budget-priced package throughout 
the year at four central Florida hotels for travelers 60 and older. 
</P>
<P>
The deal is not aimed at the usual Florida two- or three-week, see-the-state 
tourist. It's usually a minimum stay of one month during the winter. 
</P>
<P>
That cuts the appeal for many from the West Coast. But it's hard to beat the 
rates, which are $25 to $30 a day per person, based on two people sharing a 
room at the monthly double rate. 
</P>
<P>
Singles have to add $175 to $200 more. And there are some smaller additional 
optional charges for corner or water-view rooms, plus a few suites. 
</P>
<P>
The rates include all meals, an entertainment program and special daily 
activities. It's often called the Club Med for seniors. 
</P>
<P>
The hotels, like the guests they serve, are in the senior age range, but well 
preserved. They include Sunset Bay Resort and The Courtyard in St. Petersburg, 
the nearby Riverpark in Bradenton and Regency Tower in Lakeland. 
</P>
<P>
The program has been offered for many years by the Levin family of St. 
Petersburg, with Stephen Levin taking over from his grandfather, Charles Levin, 
who began the idea with one hotel in 1948. It's been expanding ever since. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a very successful program," Levin said. "Last year at this time we 
were filled, even with the addition of a fourth hotel." 
</P>
<P>
For more information and a color brochure showing the hotels, write to Senior 
Vacation Hotels, 7401 Central Ave., St. Petersburg, Fla. 33710, or call (800) 
247-2203.

NBC Studios in Burbank will offer a Senior Citizens Special during February 
that includes a "Mystery Soap Opera Tour" in addition to its regular 
behind-the-scenes tour. 
</P>
<P>
The added special will let seniors take part in the making of a mystery soap 
opera. 
</P>
<P>
Offered during February on Saturdays only, at 9 a.m. and noon, the tour costs 
$7.50 per person. Pre-paid reservations are suggested two weeks in advance for 
either groups or individuals. 
</P>
<P>
For information on the special senior tour and other things to do at NBC, call 
Group Services at (818) 840-3555.

Virgin Atlantic Airways has a Sixty Plus deal for seniors through June 15 that 
sets a $369 round-trip fare to London from Newark, N.J., or Miami. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-day advance-purchase fare has a penalty for changes or cancellations 
during the period, but it also offers the chance to go by way of one gateway 
and return via the other. Travel agents have information and schedules. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the transatlantic run, Alitalia has become a partner in the United 
Airlines Silver Wings Plus Travel Club. Club members (65 and older) get a 10% 
discount on Alitalia between the United States and Italy.

<P>
In Jerry Hulse's Travel Tips (Dec. 4) there was a recommendation for 
"personalized itineraries" under the heading of "Tailored Itineraries." What 
caused us to take notice was the assertion that "travel agents are skilled at 
obtaining bargain fares," but it is necessary to go to a consultant who is not 
an agent for expert itinerary planning. 
</P>
<P>
We at Newport Travel Concepts pride ourselves on providing our clients with the 
most up-to-date faring and routing expertise and thoroughly researched and 
personalized itineraries. We have created specialized trips throughout the 
globe, including Africa, Asia and literally around the world. We provide 
service with respect to every aspect of travel and believe that your readers 
should know that there are travel agents who "do it all."

CHEFS STIR UP TASTY RECIPES IN LOUISIANA'S CAJUN COUNTRY

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rocky Sonnier was pouring 75 pounds of sliced pork rind into a big iron kettle 
full of lard. 
</P>
<P>
More than two hours of careful cooking would elapse before the "Cracklin' King" 
ladled out fresh crackling, a Cajun delicacy when eaten warm and sprinkled with 
salt and cayenne pepper. 
</P>
<P>
"I studied for almost three years with a master," Sonnier said. "This looks 
easy, but if the crackling is going to be light and tasty, it takes hard work 
and precise timing." 
</P>
<P>
While foot-stomping Cajun music blared from a portable radio, he stirred the 
rinds with a huge wooden paddle. 
</P>
<P>
"You cook the rinds for one to 1 1/2 hours, take them out, then put them back 
in for two to three minutes, to give them just the right finish," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scooped Into Large Pans 
</P>
<P>
When the cracklings were ready, Sonnier scooped them into large pans. Somewhat 
apprehensively we bit into the piping hot pieces. 
</P>
<P>
They were wonderful, crisp and slightly spicy. We began to eat them by handfuls 
until reason prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
We weren't quite so taken with Rocky's other Cajun specialties: boudin (sausage 
stuffed with rice), pork liver, green onion and spices, and hog-head cheese (a 
pate of, yes, hog's head). 
</P>
<P>
Rocky takes his 100-year-old iron pot to parties and cook-offs, but visitors 
can buy crackling from his small takeout restaurant, Bayou Boudin &amp; 
Cracklin, in Breaux Bridge between Baton Rouge and Lafayette. 
</P>
<P>
Rocky was just one of the dedicated chefs we met in Cajun country. The bayous 
of southern Louisiana have sprouted more great cooks than cypress trees and 
lily pads. 
</P>
<P>
While Lafayette is generally considered to be the center of Cajun culture, the 
entire region around Baton Rouge is a food lover's paradise. 
</P>
<P>
"The food here is every bit as good as any in the world," says John Folse, 
owner-chef of Lafitte's Landing, a restaurant between Baton Rouge and New 
Orleans near the Sunshine Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
A true Cajun from Donaldsonville, Folse has achieved international renown for 
opening restaurants in several countries around the world to spread the gospel 
of Cajun and southern Louisiana cooking. His most recent effort was in Moscow 
during last May's Reagan-Gorbachev summit. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to take something that was uniquely American and very regional and 
make the world aware of south Louisiana cooking," Folse said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Touring Soviets 
</P>
<P>
We were in Baton Rouge to see a delegation of Soviet chefs who had come to 
visit Folse on his own turf. While the chefs toured, we set out to discover 
what real Louisiana cooking was like. 
</P>
<P>
At Nottoway Plantation we met Tessie Mae Mitchell, who has made pecan pralines 
for more than 40 years. She combines milk, butter and vanilla in a large pot 
and cooks the mixture carefully, stirring constantly for about 45 minutes 
before turning out the candies onto a buttered marble slab. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no trick to it," she says. "You have to know what you're doing, that's 
all. It just takes special care." 
</P>
<P>
We watched. It seemed simple enough, but we realized that there is more 
artistry to the process than meets the eye when we tasted a praline. It was the 
best one we had ever had. Nottoway is an 1850s-era restored plantation home 
that operates as a restaurant and bed and breakfast inn. 
</P>
<P>
The day we met Mitchell we had arrived for lunch in the large, elegantly 
furnished dining room. Blackened crab cakes were served on deep-fried slices of 
eggplant in a champagne sauce, and smoked pork medallions came with cheese 
grits and sweet potato muffins. 
</P>
<P>
The bread pudding for dessert was creamy and laced with rum; people come from 
miles around for this bread pudding. But the high point of the meal was the 
gumbo -- rich, thick, spicy but not overpowering, and full of distinct flavors. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't do it all myself," said chef Johnny (Jambalaya) Percle in the kitchen, 
as he introduced his assistants, Oralee Williams (he calls her Ma) and Lillie 
Nelson. "Ma does the roux, I do the pot. And what you get is gumbo." 
</P>
<P>
Nottoway Plantation is open for lunch and dinner, and costs about $30 per 
person. 
</P>
<P>
In Baton Rouge we tried Juban's, a slightly formal restaurant with flowered 
tablecloths and ceiling fans. Glynn and Miriam Juban own and operate the 
restaurant, and chef Tim Kringlie offers a menu centered around fresh local 
seafood. 
</P>
<P>
A specialty of the house is the Brie and crab soup. We also tried a crawfish 
and wild rice soup that was chock full of fresh vegetables and delicately 
spicy. Speckled trout was sauteed and served with shrimp and crab in a dill 
butter. 
</P>
<P>
For dessert, cherry ice cream was topped with chocolate fudge, finished with a 
raspberry coulis and served with shaved white chocolate. Dinners about $30 per 
person. 
</P>
<P>
Another family-owned operation is Chalet Brandt, the most elegant and expensive 
restaurant in town. 
</P>
<P>
Swiss-born Charles Brandt and his son Eric serve continental cuisine using 
local ingredients and influences. Guests enter the dramatically modern building 
to find a setting reminiscent of an Alpine chalet. Huge wooden beams define 
space, and Swiss banners decorate the walls. 
</P>
<P>
We began with crawfish Peggy -- crawfish in a tarragon white sauce baked with 
toasted almonds, followed by veal Chalet Brandt, tender medallions of veal in a 
rich brandy cream sauce with chanterelles and morels. 
</P>
<P>
Dessert was a vision -- meringue glace topped with freshly made vanilla ice 
cream, and raspberry sorbet served in a fresh raspberry coulis. It tasted as 
wonderful as it looked. 
</P>
<P>
Dinners at Chalet Brandt cost $40 to $50 per person, without wine (there is an 
extensive cellar). 
</P>
<P>
At the other end of the spectrum is Phil's Oyster Bar and Seafood restaurant, a 
casual diner with vinyl booths and Formica-topped tables. 
</P>
<P>
This is the favored lunching spot for politicians from the State House, and on 
Friday afternoons locals gather here in droves to watch Louisiana State 
University basketball games on television. 
</P>
<P>
When the fresh raw oysters were served we mixed our own cocktail sauce from the 
ketchup, horseradish and Tabasco sauce on the table. Catfish came deep-fried 
and delicious, freshly cooked and not overly greasy. Lunch there will cost 
about $12 per person. 
</P>
<P>
For a taste of Cajun culture to go with the food there's Mulate's, a big, noisy 
restaurant where live Cajun bands play every night and everybody dances the 
Chank-a-chank, sort of like a Texas two-step. Little kids get up and dance with 
their grandparents, and everybody has a ball. 
</P>
<P>
The food is simple but good. We tried catfish Boutte, broiled catfish seasoned 
with Cajun spices and served with grilled onions. Dinner will cost $15 to $20, 
and there's no charge for the entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
But the best meal we had the entire time was at Lafitte's Landing. "What we're 
trying to do is stick with our roots and serve regional south Louisiana 
cuisine, but make it international by incorporating classical cooking 
techniques," Folse said. 
</P>
<P>
When we finally tried his restaurant, we began to understand. Although the 
ingredients were south Louisiana, the preparations had a professional finish. 
</P>
<P>
Incongruously within sight of oil refining and chemical plants, the restaurant 
is housed in a 19th-Century building where the pirate Jean Lafitte is said to 
have lived. Inside, the brick walls and wooden beams create a pleasant 
atmosphere, but the real attraction is the food. 
</P>
<P>
Large shrimp were served in a sauce that combined the sweetness of honey with 
the tartness of Cajun spices and just a touch of garlic, and a soup of fresh 
spinach was delicately flavored with Pernod. Fresh trout was sauteed in butter 
and served in a pecan sauce that was sweet but not overpowering. Zucchini and 
carrots were cooked perfectly. 
</P>
<P>
For dessert there was cheesecake -- incredible cheesecake, creamy and moist. 
And it was offered in several varieties. 
</P>
<P>
We couldn't decide between praline, butter pecan and chocolate, so we tried all 
three, then couldn't decide which was best. Meals here are $30 to $40 per 
person.

FOOTLOOSE IN FRANCE: COLORFUL BASQUE FISHING VILLAGE WAS A FAVORITE OF THE SUN 
KING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
ST. JEAN DE LUZ, France 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One look at the azure crescent bay, colorful harbor and cloudless skies makes 
you realize why this place has remained the perfect little Basque fishing 
village, one favored by Louis XIV for the Sun King's marriage to the Spanish 
infanta in 1660. 
</P>
<P>
Basques have always been great fishermen, claiming to have discovered 
Newfoundland in pre-Columbian 1372 as their ships roamed the Atlantic Ocean in 
search of cod. 
</P>
<P>
Fishing, however, wasn't the only pursuit of intrepid Basque mariners, who also 
did more than their share of privateering. The Basques were described by a 
16th-Century Spanish author as "very bellicose, especially at sea." 
</P>
<P>
Bellicose or benign, the British have always had a covetous eye for southwest 
France, at least since Henry II in the 12th Century. Wellington camped out here 
in 1814 on his way to finish off Napoleon at Waterloo. And half a century later 
it was a preferred watering hole for upper-crust Britons. 
</P>
<P>
St. Jean de Luz is still a preferred spot for French and foreign visitors, 
having the climate, lovely beach, fine old architecture and clutch of tempting 
Basque restaurants that add up to a memorable holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Getting here: Fly Air France nonstop to Paris. Or Air Canada, American, TWA Pan 
Am, Delta or Continental with changes. Take Air Inter on to Biarritz in an 
hour. From there it's nine miles down the coast to St. Jean de Luz. 
</P>
<P>
How long/how much? Europeans and the British usually stay a fortnight. But two 
or three days will do for the town, another for forays into the surrounding 
Basque country. Accommodations are very reasonable, dining moderate to 
expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Few fast facts: The French franc recently traded at 16 cents, 6.25 to the 
dollar. Late May until late autumn are the best times for a visit, but August 
is the month all France hits the road for vacations. You need good walking 
shoes. You also need a visa. 
</P>
<P>
Getting settled: Hotel Basque (Rond Point de Sainte-Barbe; $46 to $65 U.S. 
double) is on the edge of town on a cliff above the Atlantic. Above prices are 
for rooms in the main building; other two-room bungalows with kitchens, also on 
the beautiful grounds, $88. 
</P>
<P>
The buildings and all furnishings are in Basque style, with fig trees around 
the property and a three-hole golf course outside your room. La Reserve 
restaurant is where you may take full or half-pension. 
</P>
<P>
Ohartzia (28 Rue Garat; $44 to $49 double) is a 17-room hotel at town center, 
modest but very neat and close to the harbor, beach and main shopping street. 
Bedrooms are on the small side, baths are fine. In a private little garden in 
the rear you may take breakfast, the only meal served. Off the minuscule lobby 
you'll find a bright living room with fireplace, games and lots of magazines. 
</P>
<P>
La Deviniere (5 Rue Loquin; $57-$106 double) also enjoys a good central 
location. It's an enchanting little place completely done over by the owner, a 
former antiques dealer. Floors are of tile, with museum-quality rugs and 
furniture throughout. There's a small library with grand piano and fireplace, 
and a grassy courtyard with white lawn furniture and lots of flowers. 
</P>
<P>
Bedrooms are furnished differently, with traditional fabrics and fine antiques. 
La Deviniere will capture your heart immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Regional food and drink: Basques like to start a meal with an hors d'oeuvre or 
first course of piperade, a melange of peppers, tomatoes and onions cooked with 
eggs, often served with ham or cipolatas, small local sausages. Tuna, anchovies 
and sardines are grilled simply, or figure into other local dishes, while merlu 
(a type of whiting or hake) is a Basque favorite. 
</P>
<P>
Bayonne's ham is world renowned, the gateau Basque (a flat almond cake) almost 
so. As St. Jean de Luz is only a few miles from Spain, many locals drink 
sangria in the summer, which is made here with wine, fruits and cognac. 
Irouliguy is a hearty Basque wine, with the red version much favored here. 
</P>
<P>
Moderate-cost dining: Le Kayola (18 Rue de la Republique) is an indoor-outdoor 
place on a street with many similar restaurants. After entrees of piperade with 
ham, we had the fruits de mer en papillote and merlu koskera (in the manner of 
a fisherwoman). The last is a town specialty, a generous fillet of merlu under 
a sauce of peas, asparagus and mussels. Delicious. 
</P>
<P>
The kitchen also does an excellent chicken basque (with a piquant sauce of 
peppers, tomatoes and onions) and chipirons (cuttlefish) in its own ink, very 
black, but again delicious. A pair of young men come along the street with 
guitar and flute to entertain during lunch and dinner hours. Very festive. 
</P>
<P>
Just down the street at No. 17 you'll find what many consider the best seafood 
restaurant in town, Kaiku. Step down into a cellar room with stone walls and 
tile floors and you're sure to see the town trenchermen holding forth over 
oysters, sole, lobster, barbue (a type of brill or sand dab) and rouget (red 
mullet), all prepared and served simply. Lobster soup is a specialty. About $31 
for a huge lobster-shellfish lunch or dinner for two at Kaiku. It's worth every 
sou. 
</P>
<P>
La Reserve (Hotel Basque) has a classic French kitchen with Basque overtones. 
Dine on a broad terrace with views of the ocean and hills, or inside where the 
room is done in shades of peach, with lots of crystal and flowered china. 
</P>
<P>
A three-course luncheon costs about $18, including perhaps a fish soup or 
crudites as a first course, followed by young rabbit sauteed in a pesto sauce, 
grilled salmon or steak au poivre, finishing with the cheese board or a 
dessert. 
</P>
<P>
Going first-class: Le Grand Hotel (43 Blvd. Thiers; $106-$147 double low 
season, $147-$180 high) lives up to its name. It's a formal place with marble 
floors and walls, Edwardian-style winter garden, lovely rooftop pool and 
handsome bedrooms in soft pinks and grays, and fresh roses by beds. 
</P>
<P>
The Grande Carte dining room is a huge Edwardian rotunda with marvelous views 
of the bay and mountains. 
</P>
<P>
On your own: Start with a stroll down Rue Gambetta, a pedestrian street with 
the best shops. Then have a cafe filtre or cooling drink at a table beneath 
plane trees on Place Louis XIV. This is the heart of St. Jean de Luz, opposite 
the port, where band concerts and Basque dancing groups hold forth in summer. 
</P>
<P>
Visit the 14th-Century John the Baptist Church, said to be the most beautiful 
in Basque country, where Louis and the Spanish princess were married. Then haul 
your clubs to one of the two 18-hole golf courses for a round. 
</P>
<P>
Take your pick of water sports: surfing, lazing on the beach, diving, 
windsurfing. Or sign up for deep-sea fishing in the Atlantic in one of the 
boats that sail regularly from the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
One of the real joys of visiting Basque country is a sojourn to the villages in 
the Pyrenees foothills southeast of St. Jean. We always stop in at Ascain (four 
miles) to watch an informal but spirited game of pelote that is usually going 
on in the square. Ainhoa (14 miles) is noted for its colorful main street, with 
17th- and 18th-Century Basque architecture. 
</P>
<P>

YOUTH BEAT: ON THE BUDGET TRAIL IN LUXEMBOURG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCY IZON, Izon is a Canadian travel journalist covering youth budget 
routes. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Luxembourg is often overlooked as a destination. However, it's a country known 
for its well-marked trails through lovely forests, and many of the trails are 
linked by a network of budget accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
Luxembourg, about the size of Rhode Island, is squeezed between France, West 
Germany and Belgium. It became a grand duchy in 1354 and is Europe's last 
independent duchy and the only one to become a member of the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
Luxembourg's youth hostel association maintains trails between its country 
hostels, which are marked with white triangles. Distance between hostels is 9 
to 18 miles. This year the duchy expects 12 youth hostels to be operating. 
</P>
<P>
Individuals with International Youth Hostel Federation membership cards can 
stay in dormitory accommodations in the hostels for 190 francs (about $5.40 
U.S.) a night. Travelers under age 26 get a reduced rate of 170 francs. 
</P>
<P>
Many youth hostels, including those in Luxembourg, will not let you use regular 
sleeping bags on their mattresses. You must supply a sheet sleeping bag; they 
will provide blankets. If you don't have a sheet sleeping bag with you, they 
are available to rent for 80 francs. 
</P>
<P>
If you don't want to hike alone, three guided trips organized by the youth 
hostel association will be available next summer. 
</P>
<P>
The eight-day trips will depart the city of Luxembourg on July 9, 16 and 23. 
You will need hiking boots. The maximum size of each group is 25. 
</P>
<P>
The price is 5,600 francs (about $173 U.S.), or 5,320 francs for those under 
26. The price includes accommodations for seven nights, all meals, the services 
of a guide, a topographical map, a guidebook and a youth hostel handbook, 
museum entrance fees and some train transportation. You must make arrangements 
to join by June 15. 
</P>
<P>
If you prefer to travel on your own without a fixed route, you can buy a 
package that includes everything in the trip except the guide. The advantage of 
a do-it-yourself hiking package is that you don't have to worry about the cost 
of food; all meals are included. 
</P>
<P>
Arrangements are made for your first night's accommodation in Luxembourg, and 
you choose your route from then on. You can start any day between March 1 and 
Oct. 31, but must make arrangements a week in advance. The price is 4,650 
francs, or 4,370 for those under 26. 
</P>
<P>
To find out more about these programs or similar ones for cycling, horseback 
riding and canoeing in Luxembourg, contact Centrale Des Auberges De Jeunesse 
Luxembourgeoises at 18 Place d'Armes, B.P. 374, Luxembourg. 
</P>
<P>
If you are traveling on a Eurailpass, you can use it to visit Luxembourg. If 
you need to make transportation arrangements after you reach Luxembourg, 
Voyages Soutour Tourisme de Jeunes is a travel agency geared to student-style 
travelers. 
</P>
<P>
You'll find it at 15 Place du Theatre, L-2010 Luxembourg. This is one of the 
places where you can buy rail tickets for international routes; they're sold at 
reduced rates to travelers under 26.

THE TIMES SHOPPER: MEXICO: SAN MIGUEL DE ALLENDE OFFERS ELEGANT PRODUCTS, ART, 
HANDCRAFTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
People who visit San Miguel de Allende, Mexico, generally have an eye for the 
finer things in life. The town is such a gem that it has been declared a 
national monument. 
</P>
<P>
San Miguel de Allende also is a second home for artists. The town's elegant 
shops are filled with an assortment of handcrafts made locally and in other 
areas of Mexico. There are wearables, home accessories, gift items and 
collectible art. 
</P>
<P>
By wandering around the town's delightful zocalo (main square), you see the 
best shops. They have fixed prices. It isn't advisable to bargain unless you're 
negotiating for an antique or several items that amount to a substantial sale. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crafts, Souvenirs 
</P>
<P>
Union des Artesanias (Plaza Principal 6) shows the work of six local 
craftspeople. The shop has woven metal baskets with hand-painted flowers ($15 
U.S.), tin and brass woven wastepaper baskets ($25), large brass peacock 
mirrors ($75), small pocketbook mirrors in brass cases ($3), brass trivets

pretty hand-painted doves and flowers for about $9. 
</P>
<P>
In the back room you'll find a selection of hand-painted ceramic lamp bases 
from $35 and up. 
</P>
<P>
Casa Canal (Canal 3) is one of San Miguel de Allende's two most famous shops. 
In a home-like setting, the shop displays beautiful and expensive 
colonial-style home furnishings, decorative craft items and fashions. 
</P>
<P>
You might begin with the clothes boutique featuring the creations of Josefa 
(prices start at $250). It has long dresses, caftans and ensembles bedecked 
with ribbons, plus tastefully appliqued and beautifully hued adaptations of 
traditional Indian clothing. The boutique also has clothes by Opus 1, with 
fringed caftans ($200 and up) and other exotic items. 
</P>
<P>
The furniture galleries display hand-carved wooden sets for bedrooms and dining 
rooms, plus assorted chests, bed headboards, armoires and other cabinets. 
Smaller items include tableware, lamp bases, brass and ceramic sculpture. All 
expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Joyeria Monaco (Canal 13A) is a jewelry shop with unusual and reasonably priced 
pieces, including sleek and modern pendants made with silver and large polished 
sections of onyx ($20 and up), chalcedony ($20 and up), sodolite ($30 and up) 
and other semiprecious stones. 
</P>
<P>
Square- or dot-shaped silver ear posts with onyx, malachite or turquoise cost 
$12. A silver thick-link bracelet that looks heavy but is light enough to wear 
with comfort is $70. Good buys. 
</P>
<P>
Casa Maxwell (Canal 14 and Umaran 3) is a sprawling, multilevel mansion filled 
with antique furnishings and all sorts of contemporary decorative crafts and 
designer wearables. 
</P>
<P>
Take time in browsing through this shop, which has hand-carved pine wood 
chandeliers with 12 lights ($700), sets of bedroom furniture that include 
headboards, wooden chests and dressers ($1,000 and up), carved hardwood 
dolphins ($35 and up), colorful woolen area rugs and blankets ($175 and up), 
hand-blown glasses with red, blue or brown tints ($2 a glass), and matching 
pitchers ($10) and earthenware table settings from Guadalajara, Guanajuato and 
Morelia ($250 and up per 32-piece set). 
</P>
<P>
The shop also carries fine silver jewelry and designer clothes, including 
Judith Roberts' denim coats with bright satin appliques of desert scenes ($225) 
and Irene Pulos' lovely takeoffs of traditional dresses with ribbons, applique 
and beading ($180 and up). 
</P>
<P>
Plateria Cerroblanco (Canal 17) is a family-owned jewelry shop that designs and 
manufactures its own pieces in a modern style. There are large, smoothed-oval 
chunks of turquoise, onyx and other semi-precious stones set into sleek, 
square-shaped earrings that have well-designed and sturdy snap-backs ($30 and 
up). Matching rings cost $18 and up. The shop also specializes in silver and 
leather bracelets ($15 and up) and motherofpearl earrings ($32 and up). 
</P>
<P>
The arcade at Canal 21 has several shops. 
</P>
<P>
Tendencia Mexicana has colorful cotton fashions with appliqued flowers and 
birds at about $75. There are also pantsuits ($90 and up), broad, colorful 
belts ($21) and broad-brimmed cotton hats ($40) with applique. Across the 
patio, Acento has amusing stuffed pigs and other toy animals ($12 and up) made 
out of plaid, striped and polka-dot fabrics. 
</P>
<P>
Amanda Boutique has coats ($300 and up) made from hand-woven serapes in red, 
white and black, plus beaded gourds ($10) and masks ($30 and up), handmade 
leather and cotton shoes ($25) and musician Jim Doney's handmade "monochrome" 
instruments (about $90) and New Age cassette tapes ($8). 
</P>
<P>
Bazar Unicornio (San Francisco 1) is a vast showcase for home-decorating 
accessories, including carved wooden masks of devils, angels, monsters and 
pirates ($50 and up); thick white woolen hand-loomed rugs ($150 and up); carved 
wooden doves perched on a driftwood base ($100 and up), and green metal boxes 
that are the right size to hold tissues ($36), with matching oval picture 
frames ($41 a pair). 
</P>
<P>
Baskets are filled with milagros (the small silver medals shaped like praying 
men or women that many people pin beside statues of the saints to ask or give 
thanks for blessings) for $1 each, and black wooden crosses or sculpted little 
feet that are covered with milagros, for $25 and up. 
</P>
<P>
The shop also has a large selection of crystals and rocks containing fossils, 
and exquisite tooled leather handbags with silver clasps ($200 and up). 
</P>
<P>
La Calandria (San Francisco 5), another home decorating shop, has large tin 
chests with patterns of flowers and butterflies etched into their sides ($300 
and up), hand-painted ceramic candelabra (two for $27), antique wooden medicine 
cabinets ($38 and up), painted wooden chests ($725) and hand-carved wooden 
benches with ornately sculpted bases ($800). Also sets of dishes and J&amp;B 
bottles that have been cut and filed into sets of tumblers. 
</P>
<P>
El Sombrero (San Francisco 14) is a shop that's filled to the brim with hats of 
all shapes, mostly of straw or sisal. Best hats are Panama ones from the town 
of Becal in the state of Campeche. 
</P>
<P>
Some of these are so finely woven that you almost can't see the pattern of the 
weave (from $60). They will last forever. The coarser variety (from $10) have 
the same basic shape but don't wear nearly as well. 
</P>
<P>
The shop offers a variety of bands for the hats, and also sells those big gaudy 
charro or mariachi hats made of black or red felt and embroidered with silver 
or gold thread ($40 and up).

HER WORLD: ROMANTIC RETREATS OF PRESIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH MORGAN, Morgan, of La Jolla, is a magazine and newspaper writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After each presidential election I remind myself that romance is not governed 
by the U.S. Congress, although that body often threatens short honeymoons and 
dooms relationships. 
</P>
<P>
Now it is George Bush who may face a cold shoulder in Washington. And I bet 
that the folks at The Cloister resort on Sea Island, Ga., really smile at such 
talk. Their Wall of History, already rich with world leaders who have slept 
there, is in for a boost. 
</P>
<P>
In 1945 Barbara and George Bush spent their honeymoon at The Cloister, where 
soft breezes wrap around pools and magnolia gardens just steps from the 
Atlantic shore. The Cloister fits the Bush image. Tradition is important. Golf 
and tennis and family reunions are prime reasons to stake out that sunny 
Georgia island for a holiday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gentler Climate 
</P>
<P>
It is a gentler climate than the desert of Phoenix, where, in 1952, Anne 
Frances (Nancy) Robbins Davis telephoned the manager of the Arizona Biltmore to 
say that she was marrying the actor Ronald Reagan and would like to reserve a 
honeymoon suite March 5-13. Her parents then lived at the adjacent Biltmore 
Estates. 
</P>
<P>
(Comedian Harpo Marx and his bride also honeymooned at the Biltmore, Arizonans 
will tell you, although legend says that they were less decorous than the 
Reagans and given to holding hands and skipping through the formal dining 
rooms.) 
</P>
<P>
Hotels are proud of such claims to fame. The Mission Inn in Riverside never 
failed to let guests know that Pat and Richard Nixon honeymooned there. Both 
the horsy San Ysidro Ranch in the hills above Santa Barbara, and Las Brisas in 
the hills above Acapulco boast that Jack and Jackie Kennedy were honeymoon 
guests. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Whirlwind Campaign 
</P>
<P>
If I were planning a whirlwind campaign based on a platform of romance, I might 
send a candidate on a springtime honeymoon in northern Italy at the Villa 
d'Este on Lake Como, or the Villa San Michele in the hills of Fiesole above 
Florence. 
</P>
<P>
In ski season I would give a nod to a wedding trip to Telluride, Colo., or Park 
City, Utah. If I wanted to avoid snow I would fly to Australia and check into a 
room with a view at the Regent of Sydney, where corner suites have powerful 
telescopes aimed at the beauteous harbor with its shell-shaped Opera House and 
the classic iron bridge called "the Coathanger." 
</P>
<P>
For an English country honeymoon I would hide at the Lords of the Manor at 
Upper Slaughter in the honey-colored Cotswold hills, or perhaps find a cottage 
to rent in the village of Stanton or Chipping Camden. 
</P>
<P>
For a Scandinavian setting, especially in August or September, I would check 
into a balcony room at the Grand Hotel Saltsjobaden, on a fiord called 
Baggensfjarden in a suburb of Stockholm. I don't know that any U.S. Presidents 
have stayed there, but there is still talk of Henry Kissinger's visit. 
</P>
<P>
Or I would head to the Danish island of Funen west of Copenhagen, and savor the 
country setting and superb hearth and kitchen of a half-timbered, thatched inn 
called Falsled Kro. Gardens of larkspur and roses trail toward the sea. Poplars 
and linden trees rise above stone walls. 
</P>
<P>
However, if one has plans to run for President, I suppose one should think 
American. The most romantic honeymoon setting I have seen in this nation is on 
a wooded Virginia hilltop near the university town of Charlottesville. 
</P>
<P>
That is where the dashing Thomas Jefferson took his bride Martha on a snowy 
January night in 1772. They lived in a two-room brick pavilion at the end of 
the south colonnade until the main house of Monticello was habitable two years 
later. This honeymoon lodge, with its bed and candles, remains a favorite stop 
for visitors. 
</P>
<P>
"With what majesty do we there ride above the storms!" wrote Jefferson. 
</P>
<P>
No wonder I have a crush on the man.

LAW CLEARS WAY FOR MORE FACTORY UNITS; 
</P>
<P>
ZONING ISSUES SET, BUT GOOD FINANCING REMAINS HARD TO FIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A new California law makes it easier to put manufactured homes in residential 
neighborhoods, clearing a roadblock that has prevented many people from 
purchasing low-cost, factory-made houses. 
</P>
<P>
However, some industry experts complain that financing the purchase of a 
manufactured home generally remains more expensive than financing a 
conventionally built house -- a problem that keeps many consumers from 
benefitting from the factory-made homes' lower price tags. 
</P>
<P>
"The new law has pushed the zoning problems out of the way," says David J. 
Leichey, president of Meetings+Plus, a consulting firm to the manufactured home 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, if we can solve the financing problems, sales could really take off." 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to technical advances and new designs, most manufactured homes produced 
today look exactly like conventionally built houses and the quality is just as 
good, industry officials say. 
</P>
<P>
The primary difference between manufactured homes and traditional houses is 
that most of the components of a manufactured home -- from the walls to 
completed bathrooms -- are built in a factory instead of on the lot where it 
will sit. The home is then trucked to the site in two or three pieces, 
minimizing the need for on-site construction. 
</P>
<P>
The savings that result from factory production can be dramatic: Manufactured 
homes can cost as much as 30% less than conventionally built houses of 
comparable quality. 
</P>
<P>
Producers say wider use of manufactured homes could help solve affordability 
problems in California and other high-cost housing states. But they have long 
complained that many cities "discriminate" against factory-built homes through 
prohibitive zoning and planning laws, such as ordinances that require the homes 
to be placed in run-down mobile-home parks or other undesireable areas. 
</P>
<P>
The new California law, which became effective Jan. 1, prohibits cities from 
dictating where manufactured homes must be placed. Instead, cities must now 
allow installation of factory-built homes on all residential lots, as long as 
the units meet the same standards as conventionally built homes and are in 
architectural harmony with surrounding houses. 
</P>
<P>
However, cities will be able to turn down a request to install a manufactured 
home if the house is more than 10 years old, or if it doesn't meet certain 
requirements for roof overhang, roofing material or siding. 
</P>
<P>
Cities can use the provision to reject the placement of old-fashioned 
mobile-homes in residential neighborhoods, but won't be able to use it to 
reject modern, manufactured houses. 
</P>
<P>
The new law "bascially puts manufactured homes on an even-footing with 
conventional houses," says Jess Maxcy, president of the California Manufactured 
Housing Institute, a trade group that played a key role in the legislation's 
passage. 
</P>
<P>
"If a manufactured home is compatible with other houses in the neighborhood, a 
city won't be able to turn it down." 
</P>
<P>
Maxcy thinks that the legislation could boost the popularity of manufactured 
homes, in part because buyers will have more freedom to place their houses 
where they wish. 
</P>
<P>
According to Leichey at Palm Springs-based Meetings+Plus, about 10,500 new 
manufactured homes were sold in California last year. That's equal to about 5% 
of all the houses, condominiums and apartments that were constructed in the 
state in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Still, no one is predicting that the new law will send sales of manufactured 
homes skyrocketing -- in part because financing the purchase of a manufactured 
home is still expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Leichey says interest rates on manufactured-home loans now stand at about 14%, 
roughly three percentage points higher than rates on loans for conventional 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
He says lenders charge higher rates on manufactured homes "under the mistaken 
assumption that the loans are riskier. The foreclosure rate on manufactured 
homes is actually quite a bit lower than the foreclosure rate on conventional 
houses." 
</P>
<P>
Compounding problems, many lenders require that the loans be paid off in 10, 15 
or 20 years, compared to the typical 30-year term for loans on conventionally 
built houses. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the higher rate and shorter repayment term sometimes combine to 
push the monthly payment on a manufactured home higher than the monthly payment 
on a more expensive, conventionally built house. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a borrower who purchased a manufactured home with a $60,000, 
10-year loan at 14% would have to pay about $932 each month toward principal 
and interest. 
</P>
<P>
But if the borrower instead took out a loan for $30,000 more -- a total of 
$90,000 -- to buy a conventional house with a 30-year loan term at the current 
11% rate for a typical mortgage, the monthly payment would be just $858. 
</P>
<P>
"The manufactured home would cost you a lot less, but the financing would cost 
you a lot more on a monthly basis," says Leichey. 
</P>
<P>
Some lending institutions have been working with manufactured-home producers 
and retailers to bring the cost of the loans down, Leichey says. As a result of 
those efforts, a small but growing number of lenders are now charging the same 
rate on manufactured-home loans that they do on conventional mortgages.

SAM HALL KAPLAN: WELCOME REAGANS TO A SADDER CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sam Hall Kaplan 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dear Ex-President Reagan: 
</P>
<P>
Welcome back to Los Angeles, to be sure from a design and development point of 
view, a very different Los Angeles than the one in which you and Nancy once 
lived. 
</P>
<P>
In your waning days as president, one of your more popular lines was to ask 
people whether they were better off now than they were 8 years ago. No doubt a 
select portion of L.A.'s population is, judging from the over subscription of 
the pricey-per-plate testimonials honoring you; the sizes and costs of the 
custom designed houses rising here like souffles; and array of gilded autos 
being turned over to the parking attendants at the doors of overpriced 
eateries. 
</P>
<P>
But as a returning resident, I think you should know about another Los Angeles 
existing beyond the privately guarded residential islands, such as Bel Air 
where you will be living, the scattered upscale retail enclaves and 
restaurants-of-the moment, and the glittering new museums, art galleries and 
performance centers. 
</P>
<P>
From my perspective, this other Los Angeles which many of us see and experience 
is a much less livable city today than it was 8 years ago, due, frankly, in 
part to your tenure as President. 
</P>
<P>
Take, for example, housing. In 1980, in Los Angeles, the need for affordable 
units was estimated at 50,000. In 1988, the estimate was 250,000, following 
repeated deep cuts in federal aid for low and moderate income housing, 
consistent with your policy of disinvestment in urban America. To feed a 
bloated defense budget, you starved domestic programs. 
</P>
<P>
The private sector did not come to the rescue as you promised. Generally 
ignoring affordable housing, it instead indulged in questionable land deals and 
built speculative projects, such as mini malls, consuming tens of billions of 
dollars strewn about by a deregulated thrift industry. (And now we have to bail 
them out at no little damage to the federal budget.) 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, not speculative was the purchase by an unidentified consortium of a 
multi-million dollar house in Bel Air, and its lease to you and Nancy, with an 
option to buy. I presume some sort of preferred subsidy is involved, probably 
of the form that was to aid low income families to buy their project apartments 
under one of the housing assistance programs scuttled by your administrative. 
</P>
<P>
The private sector did for a while undertake an encouraging wealth of historic 
rehabilitation projects that benefited the city. However, that trailed off 
considerably after you signed the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which eliminated many 
of the incentives for such efforts, as well as for housing development. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there has been in Los Angeles a depressing increase in the number of 
people living in unsafe and unsanitary garages, raw sheds, and recreational 
vehicles. And what decent housing is available is costing more and more; one 
study estimated that 150,000 families here spend at least 50% of their income 
on rent. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are those who cannot even find shelter, however makeshift, and are 
homeless. The latest estimate put their number in Los Angeles at 50,000, 
including at least 10,000 children. They are scattered in street scenes as 
depressing as any Third World City slum. And just saying "no" to the problem 
won't make it go away. 
</P>
<P>
You probably will never visit these areas, if only because contending with our 
increasingly congested roadways to get there would be too difficult. At times, 
it also will be hard for you to get to your office in Century City, or your 
ranch above Santa Barbara. As an ex-president, you no longer can take a 
helicopter wherever you want to go, or have the roads in front of you cleared 
by a police escort. 
</P>
<P>
This seems fair, for it was your administration that emasculated a variety of 
transit programs that could have helped relieve the mess. For the record, we 
note that your last budget called for a whopping $100 million cut in funds for 
our frail Metro Rail project. Instead, billions were squandered on plans for a 
railroad line in the desert to carry MX missiles nowhere. At least if located 
in L.A., it also could have carried people. 
</P>
<P>
Not helping our freeways, and lungs, either was your easing of auto emissions 
standards, which, in effect, has encouraged the production of gas guzzlers, and 
our increased dependence on foreign oil. 
</P>
<P>
And then there were your vetoes of the clean water acts, your smudging of the 
Clean Air Act, the super fund, the national forests, off-shore oil rights, and 
your appointment of such stewards of the environment as James Watt. 
Consequently, I don't think you and Nancy will find Santa Monica Bay, or the 
Santa Monica Mountains, as attractive as you might remember them. 
</P>
<P>
I therefore expect you will be spending more and more time at home. When 
looking out at the Los Angeles skyline from your living room, bear in mind that 
many of the glittering high-rise towers you will be seeing are foreign owned. 
They have been snapped up by the Japanese and others at bargain prices as the 
unprecedented budget deficits incurred by you turned the United States in just 
8 years from the world's largest creditor nation into the world's largest 
debitor nation. 
</P>
<P>
This means that for the next 50 years, or however long it takes our children to 
mend the damage you did to our economy, it is going to be a little tougher in 
L.A. repairing infrastructure and improving city services, as well as buying a 
house and getting a mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
As for design, during the last eight years, there seems to me to have been an 
emphasis on how things look, rather than how things work. Playing to this, I 
feel, was the penchant of Post Modernist styling for self-indulgent and 
self-promoting pastiches. 
</P>
<P>
The result was an architecture viewed less as a social art aesthetically 
serving a human need -- a traditional definition of the craft -- and more as a 
photo opportunity. In this respect I feel it reflected the values of your 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
Your city which you referred to in your farewell address a few weeks ago might 
be "shining," "more prosperous, more secure and happier than 8 years ago," 
especially if seen through the smoked glass windows of a stretch limo in which 
you and Nancy probably will travel. 
</P>
<P>
But the city of most of the residents here at present when compared to 8 years 
ago is more inequitable, more threatening, uglier and sadder.

CASTLE RESORT PLANNED FOR LAS VEGAS STRIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Circus, Circus Enterprises Inc.'s most ambitious project to date, a 4,000-room 
castle-themed resort on the Las Vegas Strip, is slated for completion in 
mid-1990. 
</P>
<P>
Yates-Silverman Inc. the commercial interior design firm assigned to the giant 
Excalibur hotel project, revealed a design plan that incorporates all of the 
romantic features of castle lore, using details based on a study of European 
castles. It includes a dungeon that will house game arcades, movie theaters and 
a jousting arena. 
</P>
<P>
The castle complex, with 100,000 square feet of casino area, will have four 
towers consisting of 1,000 guest rooms each, and a moat surrounding the 
imposing fortress. Veldon Simpson of Las Vegas is the architect. 
</P>
<P>

INTRIGUING SAGA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Congratulations to Evelyn De Wolfe for her continuing series on the issue of 
asbestos in buildings. As a former executive for a large, publicly held 
asbestos removal firm and as current owner of Asbestos Advisory Associates (a 
consulting firm) it has been intriguing to watch the asbestos saga unfold. 
</P>
<P>
A material originally installed to safeguard the public and help conserve 
energy is "suddenly" declared a carcinogen by the government. Clean up and 
related costs run in the hundreds of billions of dollars. An industry is 
created almost overnight to deal with the problem, but legislation needed to 
both regulate that industry and to inform and protect the public is nonexistent 
or conflicting at best, from agency to agency, jurisdiction to jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
It is my hope that Ms. De Wolfe's series will continue to fulfill the public's 
need for increased awareness relative to this still-confusing issue.

INSURANCE AND REAL ESTATE; 
</P>
<P>
LINK EXISTS BETWEEN AUTO, HOME COVERAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CURTIS B. SMITH, Special to The TimesSmith is a multiple-line insurance 
agent in the West Los Angeles area. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You probably don't realize there is a relationship between your auto insurance 
coverage and the security of your real estate and personal property. It would 
seem the two are unrelated. The auto insurance policy covers your car, and the 
real estate policy covers your other property, right? Partly right and partly 
wrong! 
</P>
<P>
Your real estate insurance policy covers physical damage to your property and 
liability exposure in connection with its ownership. Your auto insurance policy 
covers physical damage to your car and liability exposure in connection with 
its operation. 
</P>
<P>
But, the distinction between the two is not as clear as it would seem. When you 
are sued by someone for alleged damages, it doesn't matter whether the act 
resulting in the suit was from property ownership, operation of your car, or 
some other act. All your assets are at risk. 
</P>
<P>
For example, if you are involved in an auto accident, are sued as a result, and 
a judgment is rendered against you, you must pay the other party even if your 
auto insurance policy doesn't have enough liability coverage to pay the full 
judgment. If you don't have enough liquid assets (cash or cash equivalents) to 
pay the difference between the judgment and what the auto insurance policy will 
pay, you may be forced to sell your real estate or other assets, or forfeit 
future earnings to fully satisfy your legal obligation. It is even possible you 
could be forced into bankruptcy as a result of being underinsured. 
</P>
<P>
The solution is to make sure you are carrying enough auto liability insurance 
to cover any potential liability that could arise from the operation of your 
cars. Check with your insurance agent to make sure you are adequately covered.

SALES TAX SLEUTHS HELP CITIES FIND MISSING DOLLARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERKLEY HUDSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Lloyd de Llamas was Monterey Park's city manager, he says, he did not have 
the expertise, the time or the staff to devote to an arcane but important job: 
sales tax analysis. 
</P>
<P>
The same was true of Robert Hinderliter, who was administrator of the City of 
Commerce until 1983. "I had this chore, and I found it was not easy. I thought: 
How come nobody does this for a living?" 
</P>
<P>
Now Hinderliter and de Llamas, who left his job with Monterey Park in 1987, are 
sales tax detectives. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with cross directories, telephone directories, computer printouts and 
records from the state's tax Board of Equalization, the two former city 
managers, as Hinderliter, de Llamas &amp; Associates, track errors in reporting 
and distributing sales tax revenues to cities throughout California. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pore Over Records 
</P>
<P>
In their Claremont office, they pore over coded accountings of the quarterly 
sales tax records for every business in a community. They try to determine 
whence products are shipped, where inventories are stored and where sales are 
made. 
</P>
<P>
This tedious task, the two men say, can be vital to the financial health of 
their clients, about 62 cities in the state, including 16 in the San Gabriel 
Valley. In some cases the sales tax revenues have been mistakenly allocated or 
incorrectly reported. 
</P>
<P>
Sales taxes and related taxes, called use taxes, are the bread and butter of 
many cities' revenues, accounting in some cases for as much as 40% of them. Use 
taxes are paid by out-of-state companies, such as mail order stores, which do 
business in California. 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, the factor of error with sales and use taxes is slim. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 900,000 businesses (including 20,000 out-of-state companies) that pay 
California local sales and use taxes, errors occur with perhaps no more than 
1%, de Llamas said. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Larry Micheli of the state Board of Equalization's business taxes 
division, said that in a random sample of 100 sales tax accounts, one account 
might be incorrect. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the state, the board has 30 district offices and also offices in 
Chicago, New York and Houston that keep track of large firms doing business in 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the errors statewide sometimes can mean as much as $5 million a year, de 
Llamas says. So, he says, mistakes can have significant bearing on a city's 
finances. In some cases, when de Llamas is successful, he can find an 
additional $10,000 to $500,000 in annual revenues for a community. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, de Llamas, who works on a contingency and percentage basis, said he 
uncovered $250,000 for Redlands. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, he said, mistakes happen simply because of a wrong address being 
recorded and no one catching the error. 
</P>
<P>
In Redlands he found 30 businesses whose addresses had changed because of a 
series of annexations there. But about half of those businesses were not 
recorded as being based in Redlands, so the city was not getting its fair share 
of tax dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Redlands, with 55,000 residents, took in $4.4 million in sales tax in 1988-89. 
So the $250,000 that de Llamas discovered is a substantial windfall, according 
to City Manager John Holmes. "We're really thrilled," he said, adding that his 
staff may never have discovered the mistake. 
</P>
<P>
"Big cities can afford to have a sales tax specialist on their staff. Little 
cities can't," said Hinderliter. 
</P>
<P>
One of the difficulties that cities face in reviewing reports sent them by the 
state, Hinderliter said, is that the information is presented in code, partly 
to ensure confidentiality of businesses' sales tax records. When de Llamas and 
Hinderliter are hired by a city, they are given permission to look at these 
records. 
</P>
<P>
The two men and their eight-member staff use computer programs that decode and 
analyze the tax data. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Another Company 
</P>
<P>
One other consulting firm in the state also deals principally with finding 
sales taxes errors. Municipal Resource Consultants has a staff of 10 at offices 
in Westlake Village and Madera. 
</P>
<P>
"My basic position on (these consultants) is neutrality," said the equalization 
board's Micheli. "The board provides the same information to both the cities 
and the consultants. (Cities) could easily set up their own computer programs." 
</P>
<P>
But, said John Austin of Municipal Resource Consultants, "it's cheaper for 
smaller cities to hire us than to do it themselves." The firm was started in 
1978 by Allen W. Charkow, who served as finance director for Fresno and Garden 
Grove. In the two years since Charkow has made the business a full-time one, 
his client list of communities has grown from nine to 60. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought we were working ourselves out of a job,' said Charkow. "But there 
is such a turnover with businesses, along with closings, movings, and 
consolidations. There is always a state of flux that seems to make errors 
occur." 
</P>
<P>
Errors tend not to be made by local retailers, de Llamas said, but instead by 
industries and corporations. 
</P>
<P>
In a large corporation headquartered outside California and doing business in 
30 to 40 states, de Llamas said, there is considerable room for error. 
</P>
<P>
Mistakes in reporting of use taxes are found in larger cities such as Los 
Angeles and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a firm could be headquartered in New Jersey with an administrative 
office in Los Angeles and its sales office in the San Gabriel Valley. The key 
to determining which city should receive the tax from a particular business, de 
Llamas said, is based on where the sales office is located. 
</P>
<P>
The accounting office in New Jersey might file its use tax forms by listing its 
office simply as Los Angeles. All the use tax money would be credited to Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're in a New Jersey firm, it's all Los Angeles to you," de Llamas said. 
The distinction between Monterey Park and Los Angeles can become lost, and thus 
Monterey Park gets shortchanged on the amount of tax it receives. 
</P>
<P>
Besides finding mistakes, the consultants perform a diagnostic function. De 
Llamas said he tries to provide data answering such questions as: "Are city 
councils and city managers taking steps that are actually generating more in 
sales taxes?" 
</P>
<P>
Also, through the use of computerized graphs, the consultants help cities 
discover what proportion of sales tax is coming from specific types of 
businesses and how to solve problems. "South Pasadena is a classic case," de 
Llamas said. "They've got to do something about their economic development, but 
they also have environmental goals." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tracking Trends 
</P>
<P>
In Pasadena, de Llamas did a geographic analysis, looking at the Old Town area 
to see the difference in sales tax generated by general retailers versus eating 
and drinking establishments. Says Pasadena's Finance Director Mary Bradley: "We 
were able to see more detailed trends on who was the leading sales tax 
producers. We were able to see businesses that were growing and ones that are 
shrinking." 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena, she said, also was better able to analyze how sales taxes related to 
the number of square feet occupied by a retail outlet. This kind of 
information, she said, is valuable for city leaders who are trying to decide 
what types of businesses they want to cultivate and attract. 
</P>
<P>
"We just don't have the computer facilities for this sort of thing," said 
Dianne Gershuny , assistant city manager and finance director of Los Altos, 
population 28,000. 
</P>
<P>
With the help of sales tax analysis, she said, Los Altos officials improved 
their budget estimate for sales tax revenues. A recent estimate, she said, was 
less than 1% off. "In prior years, we considered it pretty good if it were 5% 
off," she said. The difference of 4% improvement may not seem that dramatic 
but, she said, more accurate projections helps her city improve its ability to 
budget and plan. 
</P>
<P>
For Monrovia's city manager, Jim Starbird, it has been easier and cheaper to 
rely on an outside sales tax consultant. "It really helps keep you on the pulse 
of the business community," Starbird said. 
</P>
<P>
In Pasadena, an audit by Hinderliter and de Llamas "found maybe $100,000 worth" 
of erroneously allocated sales taxes, Bradley said. "One hundred thousand 
dollars a year is nothing to be sneezed at. That could, say, really help the 
police force." 
</P>
<P>
But, de Llamas said, he isn't successful in every case. "I've got one city in 
the San Gabriel Valley and I've been looking around there for three months, and 
we haven't found dime one." Still, he said, he hasn't given up.

LIGHTS ANNOUNCEMENT 'PREMATURE'; 
</P>
<P>
DEBATE FLARES AGAIN OVER HOLLYWOOD SIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON RUSSELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A controversial plan to light the landmark Hollywood sign was revived last 
week, but not the way its sponsors at the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce had 
intended. 
</P>
<P>
Embarrassed officials described as "premature" a chamber-authorized news 
release implying that agreement had been reached with a Camarillo solar energy 
company to light the sign. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (the release) sort of jumped the gun," said Bill Welsh, the chamber's 
president and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'News to Us' 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Arco Solar Inc., a subsidiary of Atlantic Richfield Co., which 
last April made the proposal to light the monument permanently as a 
demonstration of sun-powered electricity, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"It comes as news to us," company spokesman Steve Lowe said. "There are a lot 
of details to be worked out yet, and, frankly, we haven't had much 
communication with any of the chamber people in the last few months." 
</P>
<P>
Chris Baumgart, head of the chamber's effort to light the sign, said the news 
release was prepared by a public relations firm "as an effort to create some 
enthusiasm for the project." 
</P>
<P>
For years, chamber officials have wanted to light the sign on Mt. Lee in 
Griffith Park to promote the old and new Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Historic Monument 
</P>
<P>
Designated a Cultural Historic Monument in 1973, the sign is under the 
jurisdiction of the city's Recreation and Parks Department, which has 
authorized the chamber to raise funds to restore and maintain it. 
</P>
<P>
Before it was donated to the city, the land on which the 50-foot-tall letters 
stand was part of Hollywoodland, a residential subdivision that the sign was 
built to publicize. 
</P>
<P>
Originally illuminated by 4,000 20-watt bulbs as a real estate promotional 
gimmick in the 1920s, the often-vandalized sign was lighted during the 1984 
summer Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
But residents of the nearby Hollywood Hills complained that the 1984 experiment 
caused their neighborhoods to be flooded with trespassers, loiterers and 
vandals drawn to the sign after dark by the lights. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's proposal to light the sign permanently was met with protest from 
residents, prompting City Councilman John Ferraro, in whose district the sign 
is located, to push for a citizens' advisory panel to oversee future plans for 
the sign. 
</P>
<P>
Chamber officials formally withdrew their request to light the sign last 
November, citing opposition by residents, but they have continued to pursue the 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
Although the plan is in limbo, Baumgart said he is optimistic that, "if 
everything were to work out," the sign might even be illuminated by July 4. 
</P>
<P>
"The one thing we want to emphasize is that we aren't trying to do anything 
without the blessing of the people who live near the sign," he said. "First and 
foremost, we've got to present a security plan that people can feel comfortable 
with, and I'm confident we can do that." 
</P>
<P>
But several members of the advisory panel expressed surprise at the chamber's 
latest overtures. 
</P>
<P>
"I think most of us thought the proposal was dead," said Dino Williams, a panel 
member whose home is near the sign. 
</P>
<P>
Christine O'Brien, president of the Hollywoodland Homeowners Assn., said she 
was "unaware of any discussions with any of the (neighborhood group) leaders" 
during the last several months. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anyone's position has changed, and that's that we're opposed to 
lighting the sign," she said. "Nothing the chamber or anyone else has suggested 
in the way of security seems near adequate to deal with the type of problems we 
experience up here." 
</P>
<P>
An aide to Ferraro expressed a similar view. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way anything is going to happen to light that sign outside the 
channel of the (advisory) committee," Tom LeBonge said. "At this point, I don't 
see that (the chamber) has made any headway."

LOT OF WARMTH AND SOME HEAT FOR YAROSLAVSKY; 
</P>
<P>
CONTENDERS PROTEST THEY SHOULD HAVE HAD EQUAL TIME AT FORUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In one of his first political outings since he decided to seek reelection to 
the Los Angeles City Council instead of running for mayor, Zev Yaroslavsky got 
a warm welcome from a major residents' group. 
</P>
<P>
Appearing with his three opponents for the 5th District seat before the Sherman 
Oaks Homeowners Assn., Yaroslavsky spoke at length of his efforts to increase 
police protection, reduce large development and improve government services. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Richard Close, the homeowner group's president, said Yaroslavsky has won 
the respect of voters on the valley side of the district. "The people in 
Sherman Oaks view him as a leader trying to solve problems," Close said. "That 
was indicated (at the meeting). I would be shocked if he had any problems in 
the valley." 
</P>
<P>
Close allowed Yaroslavsky to speak much longer at than any of his three 
challengers on the ground, he said, that the forum, which was the monthly 
meeting of the homeowners group, gave the voters a good opportunity to hear 
their representative. 
</P>
<P>
But Yaroslavsky's opponents cried foul, charging that the councilman was given 
preferential treatment at the meeting, held Wednesday at the Dixie Canyon 
Elementary School and attended by about 100 people. 
</P>
<P>
Laura M. Lake, a Westwood activist who is seen as Yaroslavsky's primary foe in 
the council race, said each candidate deserved equal time. The three stayed to 
talk to Close at the end of the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'More Fairness' 
</P>
<P>
"Close played fast and loose with the format. . . . We wanted more fairness," 
Lake said. 
</P>
<P>
Challenger Jack McGrath of North Hollywood, a former campaign manager and chief 
deputy of Yaroslavsky's who now works in real estate, said he complained about 
the format before the meeting, to no avail. McGrath said he had hoped to 
question Yaroslavsky about development and other issues during the forum. 
</P>
<P>
Residents, however, were in no mood to throw stones, Close said. "This meeting 
was an opportunity for the general public to complain or criticize. But 
everyone appeared to be very pleased with what (Yaroslavsky) is trying to do." 
</P>
<P>
In another event Wednesday, the ever-changing field of candidates in the 5th 
District race changed again, when political activist Steve Saltzman bowed out 
of the race. 
</P>
<P>
Most observers say Yaroslavsky will be reelected easily now that he has decided 
against running for mayor. But the remaining three challengers have vowed to 
wage active campaigns, and Yaroslavsky said he takes them seriously. 
</P>
<P>
In his opening remarks to the homeowners group, Yaroslavsky unveiled a plan to 
add 10,000 officers to the Los Angeles Police Department by 1993. He also 
discussed efforts to reduce development along Ventura Boulevard by lowering 
density. Responding to questions, Yaroslavsky said he would oppose an 
above-ground light-rail system in the valley if it were to cause problems for 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
"When it comes time to make the decision, . . . there's no way I'm going to 
allow it to go by people's windows," he said. "I just ain't gonna do it." 
Yaroslavsky also defended his support for slow-growth initiatives, telling a 
disgruntled developer that he knew of no other way to control development. 
</P>
<P>
The other three hopefuls in the April 11 election for the 5th District seat, 
which includes the Beverly-Fairfax area, Century City, Bel-Air, Westwood, West 
Los Angeles, and parts of Sherman Oaks, North Hollywood and Van Nuys, were 
allowed to make only brief remarks at the beginning of the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
UCLA Professor 
</P>
<P>
Lake, a UCLA environmental sciences professor on leave who has been highly 
critical of Yaroslavsky's representation of the Westwood area, said she would 
always put the people's interests first. 
</P>
<P>
"This race will be about fairly representing the people of the 5th District," 
she said. "We need a council person willing to work with the 5th District 
rather than against it. . . . Vote as if your neighborhood depended on it, 
because it does." 
</P>
<P>
Lake had formally kicked off her campaign Monday with a spirited rally outside 
the Westside Pavilion. At that time, Lake, who heads Friends of Westwood, 
blamed Yaroslavsky for the expansion of the shopping mall and for other 
developments that have plagued Westside residents. Lake said she believes 
Sherman Oaks residents have the same concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"I would not say that Sherman Oaks is in anyone's pocket," Lake said. "They 
have enormous problems, and I think they're looking for a leader to solve 
them." 
</P>
<P>
McGrath also accused the councilman of turning his back on the voters. 
</P>
<P>
"Zev was an independent, he was a visionary," McGrath told the Sherman Oaks 
homeowners. "But the last three years, something has happened. We've got real 
problems in River City here. . . . And we've got to bring people together." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan Snyder, a private traffic consultant from Westwood, was the final 
challenger to address the group. Snyder did not criticize Yaroslavsky but told 
the group that he himself is the only candidate with the know-how to solve the 
area's chronic traffic problems. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder said he would create transportation-management organizations aimed at 
addressing traffic woes in each community. Snyder also pledged to return the 
diamond lane to the Ventura Freeway.

SOUTH GATE POLICE CUT SERVICE AFTER PHONE TAX DEFEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE HARRIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SOUTH GATE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police are reducing some non-emergency services and eliminating homicide 
investigations because of budget limitations, Police Chief Ronald George has 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
The cutbacks are in response to the defeat in November of a proposed tax that 
police had hoped would pay for more officers. 
</P>
<P>
Police response time to less serious crimes, such as thefts of car stereos, may 
increase from 20 minutes to as long as an hour, or officers may not respond at 
all, George said. 
</P>
<P>
"In some cases we'll probably not go to the scene of minor crimes, but will be 
asking citizens to come into the station to fill out reports," George said. 
</P>
<P>
Police will continue to respond as soon as possible to major crimes such as 
burglaries and robberies in progress or life-threatening emergencies, George 
said. On the average, South Gate police get to the scenes of those crimes 
within 3 1/2 minutes, George said. 
</P>
<P>
"I know we will be getting some complaints (about not responding to lesser 
crimes) but we can no longer afford the niceties. We'll try and make the 
transition as painless as possible," George added. 
</P>
<P>
The chief of the 89-officer force had warned of service cutbacks if voters 
failed to approve a tax on monthly telephone bills to help pay for 10 more 
officers, five more civilian police employees and new equipment. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, George said, the department has asked the county Sheriff's 
Department to investigate homicides in South Gate, a service provided regularly 
to small police departments. About eight or nine homicides occur in the city 
every year. Three South Gate homicide detectives have been reassigned to 
investigate other major crimes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, eight officers were reassigned to a new Crime Impact Team 
to concentrate on serious crimes. Four of the officers were from the patrol 
division, and two each were from the narcotics squad and grand theft auto 
squad. 
</P>
<P>
The team, which dons black jackets with gold lettering and rides in unmarked 
police vehicles, has been assigned initially to concentrate on a significant 
increase in stolen vehicles, George said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crime Rates Rose 
</P>
<P>
Although major crimes in the city rose 5% last year, the number of auto thefts 
increased 18.6% to 981. The stolen cars generally are stripped, and the parts 
are sold, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We think gangs are heavily involved in grand theft auto crimes. So, by 
fighting grand theft auto crimes we are also fighting the gangs," George said. 
He estimated that there are 17 known active gangs with about 1,700 members in 
the city of 80,000. 
</P>
<P>
A 24-hour telephone hot line was installed last week to allow people to report 
crime tips that the team will follow up on, George said. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Doug Christ, the impact team's supervisor, said it has been very successful 
in the first eight days of work, making 53 arrests, including eight arrests for 
stolen vehicles. The other arrests involve charges ranging from possession of a 
deadly weapon to burglary. George said the number of arrests is much higher 
than it would have been without the team. 
</P>
<P>
Christ said: "These are pro-active arrests, as opposed to someone calling us. 
We went out and generated them. We went out and found them (through 
surveilance) by being on the streets." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Councilmen Told 
</P>
<P>
Last week, George described the Crime Impact Team plan to City Council members 
and other officials, who approved. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman William H. DeWitt said: "It is an economic fact of life, we can only 
do so much with the resources we have. I hope we will be able to satisfy most 
of the people. Time will tell." 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Spragg, city administrator, said: "We are trying to make the best use of 
our resources by re-shifting them. There will be some complaints about the slow 
response, but that is the price we must pay." 
</P>
<P>
Five positions in the department were eliminated last year because of budget 
cuts.

DRIVERS TO FACE THE CAMERA AT RED LIGHTS IN PASADENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
PASADENA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just seven months after the city began using a controversial photo radar to 
catch speeding motorists, tests are about to begin on a similar surveillance 
device to catch red-light violators. 
</P>
<P>
The photo radar, which brought howls of protest against "Big Brother" when it 
was introduced last June, has already photographed thousands of speeding 
motorists, who received tickets in the mail. 
</P>
<P>
Now the city hopes that a photographic red-light surveillance device called the 
Multafot will be just as effective. 
</P>
<P>
The Multafot is a combination camera and microcomputer that automatically 
detects vehicles that enter an intersection after the light has turned red. 
</P>
<P>
The camera snaps a photo of the vehicle, its license plate number and the 
driver's face. Information from the photo is later printed out to produce a 
ticket that is mailed to the registered owner of the car. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One-Month Trials 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Pasadena will install one of the units at the intersection of Fair 
Oaks Avenue and Union Street to begin a one-month trial. Then it will be moved 
to California Boulevard and Hill Avenue for another month. 
</P>
<P>
No tickets will be issued during the test period, but Mayor William Thomson 
said that if the device works as advertised, it could be in operation by the 
end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena is the first city in the state and only the second in the United 
States to test the device. New York City tested the machine last year and is 
preparing to install 25 units. 
</P>
<P>
The Multafot, like the photo radar, has been used in Europe, Asia and South 
America for years, said Robert P. Umbdenstock, whose San Anselmo company 
distributes the machine in this country. 
</P>
<P>
The device, which costs between $40,000 and $45,000, is usually mounted on a 
pole about 12 feet above the road and 100 feet away from the intersection. 
</P>
<P>
A set of magnetic sensors is embedded in the road to detect when a car has 
entered the intersection. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Machine Is Activated 
</P>
<P>
When the signal light turns red, the machine is activated and a photo is taken 
of any car in the intersection. 
</P>
<P>
The device is programmed to screen out cars that are legally turning right or 
left on a red light. 
</P>
<P>
Thomson said he hopes that the machine will generate less controversy than the 
photo radar, which many have attacked as unfair, un-American and just plain 
sneaky. 
</P>
<P>
Motorists have complained that the ticket is sent to the registered owner of 
the car even though that person may not have been driving at the time of the 
violation. The city has not been prosecuting those cases. 
</P>
<P>
In several court trials involving photo radar tickets, motorists have contested 
the accuracy of the unit's radar and the legality of ticketing drivers without 
stopping them. 
</P>
<P>
In the vast majority of cases, the motorists have lost. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Successful Challenge 
</P>
<P>
But one man, Joseph L. Logsdon of Arcadia, successfully fought his ticket last 
year in a case that led to the dismissal of more than 900 other tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Logsdon's attorney, Thomas D. Hogue, argued that the police vehicle containing 
the photo radar unit was painted the wrong color. 
</P>
<P>
State law requires police vehicles be painted either all white or white with a 
sharply contrasting color. The Pasadena Police Department painted its radar 
vehicle white and gold, a color scheme not used on any of its other vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
A Municipal Court judge agreed with Hogue's argument and dismissed the case. 
The city prosecutor's office later agreed to dismiss all photo radar cases in 
which the white-and-gold car was used. 
</P>
<P>
The photo radar car has since been repainted all white. 
</P>
<P>
Thomson said drivers will be far less contentious about red-light surveillance 
because, while everyone speeds once in awhile, few drivers condone running a 
red light. 
</P>
<P>
"No one argues about that," he said. "If you run a red light, you're 
endangering your life and others. I don't expect much controversy." 
</P>
<P>
So far, Thomson has at least one supporter. 
</P>
<P>
Logsdon, who has remained intensely opposed to the photo radar, said using the 
Multafot to catch red-light violators is a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
"I almost got killed the other day in an intersection," Logsdon said. "You're a 
damn fool if you run a red light."

The chairman of a nonprofit housing firm accused of losing at least $5 million 
in taxpayer money since 1978 has charged that a recent federal audit is 
inaccurate and unduly critical because the auditor was in a hurry and failed to 
talk with the right people. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite our many requests for her to interview members of the original . . . 
staff, she never did," said James Woods, chairman of Hub City Urban Developers 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
In a Jan. 6 letter to Mayor Walter R. Tucker, Woods defended the firm and 
disputed the audit, prepared last fall by the U.S. Department of Housing and 
Urban Development and sent to the city in December. 
</P>
<P>
From 1978 to 1984, the firm obtained a $2-million HUD grant and $3 million in 
city loans to build 133 prefabricated houses in a blighted area of town. But 
when the money ran out, only a few houses were under construction. Now HUD is 
investigating with help from the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
The audit found that the city failed to adequately monitor Hub City's spending 
and that the firm failed to keep complete financial records. For some years, 
there were no records at all, making it impossible to determine how the money 
was spent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Auditor 'Missed Opportunity' 
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Woods complained that HUD auditor Jenny Lare "missed the 
opportunity to obtain valuable insight about the operation of the (housing) 
factory" because she was rushing to finish before moving to a different job 
within the federal agency. Members of the original staff would have been better 
able to recall how the government money was spent from one day to the next, 
Woods reasoned. 
</P>
<P>
Lare, who was in the audit division of the HUD Office of Inspector General when 
the audit was done, declined to comment last week. 
</P>
<P>
But Miguel P. Barrios Jr., the regional inspector general for HUD in San 
Francisco, denied Woods' charge. 
</P>
<P>
"The allegation is unwarranted," Barrios said. The official acknowledged that 
Lare, who was for many years an auditor for the Internal Revenue Service, has 
since transferred to the Inspector General's investigative division. However, 
he said the transfer in no way affected the Hub City audit. 
</P>
<P>
Hub City, which was founded by some of Compton's most prominent citizens, spent 
all its funds but never produced the houses or jobs that were supposed to have 
sprung from the creation of an on-going modular housing factory. 
</P>
<P>
In his letter to the mayor, Woods said that Hub City was doomed to fail because 
the government insisted on an unworkable production schedule. HUD, he said, 
insisted that the production process be divided into six phases and that 17 
houses be completed and sold before the next phase could begin. 
</P>
<P>
"In order for a factory to be successful," Woods wrote, "it is necessary for 
operation to be continuous. . . . In retrospect, this was the major reason for 
the failure of Hub City to complete the mission." 
</P>
<P>
Woods said in a telephone interview last week from Washington, where he was 
attending the inaugural of President George Bush, that at the time he "kept 
saying" that the production schedule was a bad idea. 
</P>
<P>
"By that time it was too late," he said. "But I'm not going to try to lay the 
blame on everybody. I did the best I could." Woods also said during the 
interview that he does not believe that fraud was involved in any of Hub City's 
financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
"It was poor management by everybody, HUD and the city and Hub City and I'll 
include (myself in that)," said Woods, who was on the board of Hub City when it 
began the housing project but was not the chairman. 
</P>
<P>
The $2-million federal Urban Development Action Grant (UDAG), Woods said, was 
spent setting up a housing factory on East Alondra Boulevard. "Two million 
(dollars) to set up a factory is nothing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Woods said he doesn't know how the $3-million in city loans were spent. At that 
time, he said, he was doing a lot of traveling overseas and wasn't as involved 
with the board as he is now. 
</P>
<P>
HUD wants Compton to take over Hub City's assets to recover the $2-million 
grant that the city steered to the firm. In his letter to the mayor, Woods 
called the federal idea "counterproductive." 
</P>
<P>
"The government will get (its) money back," Wood declared in the interview. 
</P>
<P>
The firm has income from a continuing joint venture with a private contractor 
who is building townhouses on the project site. The federal audit, however, is 
critical of the way the firm is spending that money and says any income should 
be going toward repayment of the original $2-million grant. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not a bit of that money going for anything other than paying bills," 
Woods said during the interview. He was referring specifically to the parts of 
the audit that questioned how Hub City's current income is being spent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Woods Criticized 
</P>
<P>
Woods, who is not supposed to receive any money for his work as chairman of the 
Hub City board of directors, was criticized by the auditor for getting a $1,000 
payment from the firm. He has said the amount was reimbursement for money he 
spent to clean up Hub City's factory site. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government and the city, he said, are not the only ones owed money. 
The state and several vendors, said Woods, must also be paid. In his letter to 
the mayor, Woods said Hub City has repaid $45,000 of a loan it got from the 
state Department of Commerce. There is still about $100,000 owing on the loan, 
he said in the interview. Hub City has also paid a $12,000 debt to Southern 
California Edison Co., he said. 
</P>
<P>
If the federal government would let the firm get on with business, he said, it 
will repay the UDAG grant to the city, something he said has already started. 
The joint venture on the townhouses with AFCOM, a private housing development 
firm in Seal Beach, calls for the city to get about $6,000 on the sale of each 
home. That will take care of about $600,000 of the $2-million UDAG debt. 
</P>
<P>
To repay the rest of the money, Woods said Hub City wants to give the city a 
five-acre parcel it owns along the Artesia Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Woods said the land is worth perhaps as much as $1.5 million now, according to 
an appraisal, because it is next to two of the city's largest redevelopment 
projects, a hotel and an auto sales plaza. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Offended by Audit 
</P>
<P>
Woods owns a construction company and an automotive parts business, and is 
chairman of the Los Angeles County Airport Commission. He said he is offended 
because the federal audit implied that Hub City was mishandling the income it 
has now instead of repaying the UDAG grant. 
</P>
<P>
"All I'm trying to do," he said, "is pick up the pieces and get things going . 
. . and make everybody whole." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Tucker did not return several calls for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Timothy Iverson, director of Compton's office of Economic and Grants Management 
Services, said the city is anxious to get the problem solved. It has 60 days to 
notify HUD how is plans to recover the $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
He wants the city to participate in other UDAG programs, he said. "Of course it 
will not necessarily help us if we haven't resolved this or attempted to 
resolve this in a satisfactory manner to HUD. This would dampen our chances (of 
getting another grant)," Iverson said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Maxcy Filer, meanwhile, said he is unconvinced by Woods' explanation 
that an unworkable production schedule ate up all Hub City's money. 
</P>
<P>
"His explanation is too thin," said Filer. "That doesn't answer the questions 
that were asked in the audit." 
</P>
<P>
Filer does not accept Woods' complaints about the auditor either. "The auditor 
had no ax to grind. . . . (She) came in to do a job that couldn't be done 
because the books were just not there," Filer said.

POLLUTION FOUND AT SITE OF CLOSED PLANT IN SANTA FE SPRINGS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Toxic wastes have seriously polluted ground water and soil beneath the closed 
Neville Chemical Co. plant, but the contamination has not yet affected 
drinking-water supplies, according to a six-month study of the site. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of the more contaminated sites" in the state, said Richard Hume, 
project manager of the Neville site for the state Department of Health 
Services. "But just because there's a lot of contamination doesn't mean it's 
necessary to make an immediate response. We don't see any risk we would call 
imminent and substantial endangerment." 
</P>
<P>
The study is the latest development in the effort to clean up the Neville site, 
where the state has been investigating soil and water pollution for almost five 
years. Neville closed the plant in 1987 after 25 years of manufacturing 
chlorinated paraffin, a chemical used as a metal lubricant, flame retardant and 
in paint for traffic lanes. Dichlorobenzenes, dioxins and furans are among the 
byproducts of the chlorinated paraffin manufacturing process. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concern Over Possible Migration 
</P>
<P>
There was concern that some of these chemicals had migrated to Norwalk Manor, a 
303-unit condominium development about 100 yards from the Neville site at 12800 
Imperial Highway. However, soil tests showed no contamination. 
</P>
<P>
Dichlorobenzene, a suspected cancer-causing agent, is present in the ground 
water beneath the plant at up to 1,400 parts per billion, a concentration more 
than 10 times the state limit for drinking water, the study concluded. The same 
chemical was found in the soil in concentrations of up to 29 million parts per 
billion, but the state has not established a limit on dichlorobenzene in the 
soil, Hume said. Excessive amounts of the carcinogens dioxin and furan also 
were found in the soil. 
</P>
<P>
Dioxin and furan, chemicals that have caused cancer in laboratory animals, 
usually do not migrate from the surface, Hume said. But at the Neville site, 
dichlorobenzene is acting as a carrier for dioxin and furan and has plunged the 
chemicals to a depth of five feet, according to the study by James M. 
Montgomery Engineering Co. 
</P>
<P>
The contamination is not considered an immediate threat because the 
ground-water table begins at about 100 feet and drinking water wells start at 
about 500 feet, Hume said. 
</P>
<P>
"The real danger would be in finding dioxins in the ground water," Hume said. 
"No dioxins are present now." 
</P>
<P>
The nearest well used for drinking water is about two miles away in the 
downtown Norwalk area and that well shows no sign of the chemicals polluting 
the Neville site, said Thomas Salzano, assistant general manager of the Central 
and West Basin Water Replenishment District. 
</P>
<P>
Soil contamination, which has been detected at depths of up to 65 feet, is not 
a threat because the Neville site has been fenced off and paved, Hume said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators still do not know the extent of the ground-water contamination, 
which the study called "a potential threat to public health and the 
environment." The most extensive ground-water pollution was beneath the Neville 
site, with less contamination farther from the plant, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
Hume said more monitoring wells will be drilled during the next phase of the 
cleanup to to determine how far the dichlorobenzene plume has traveled. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First Disclosed in 1984 
</P>
<P>
The pollution at the plant was first disclosed in 1984, when the Department of 
Health Services discovered the company had buried 21 drums of toxic wastes at 
the site. In 1986, Neville was convicted of federal charges of illegally 
disposing of hazardous wastes, and the government ordered the company to pay 
for the $2-million cleanup of the site and surrounding areas affected by the 
contamination. The state is spending $100,000 in federal Superfund money to 
oversee cleanup of the site, Hume said. 
</P>
<P>
The first part of the cleanup was the six-month study that identified the 
extent of the contamination on the 3.5-acre Neville manufacturing site, an 
adjacent 1.6 acres leased by Neville, about one acre owned by the city of Santa 
Fe Springs, and the Norwalk Manor recreation area. 
</P>
<P>
State Department of Health Services officials held a community forum a year ago 
at Norwalk City Hall to discuss the cleanup effort, and Hume said another forum 
probably will be held this spring once the state gives final approval to the 
first phase of study. 
</P>
<P>
The second phase of the study, to be completed late this year, will include 
further study of the extent of ground-water contamination and proposals for how 
the soil and water should be cleaned up.

CENTER FOR LATINO PROBLEMS MIXES ALTRUISM, PROFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK HOLGUIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The man on the phone sounded desperate. He had been working at a factory for 13 
years but had not been promoted because, he suspected, he is Latino. What 
should he do? 
</P>
<P>
Moments before, an exasperated woman had called seeking help in collecting 
$1,000 from her former landlord, money that was borrowed more than a year ago. 
Neither caller spoke English. 
</P>
<P>
The director of Centro de Proteccion Familiar (Center for Family Protection) 
scheduled appointments to work on solutions to their problems. Director Ana 
Rosa Rodriguez told the first caller that her staff could write letters to his 
supervisor and to the company president explaining the situation. She would 
also refer him to the state Department of Fair Employment &amp; Housing. 
Rodriguez would arrange for one of her mediators to work with the other caller 
and her former landlord. The services would be provided free of charge. 
</P>
<P>
The same services could be provided by a number of publicly funded, nonprofit 
social service agencies, but Centro de Proteccion Familiar has a distinguishing 
characteristic -- it's a business run by executives who mix altruism with 
profit. 
</P>
<P>
CPF is the brainchild of Spanish Research and Marketing, a South Pasadena-based 
advertising and marketing firm that specializes in tapping the Latino market. 
</P>
<P>
CPF is a marketing operation that is advertised as a way to help first- and 
second-generation Latinos adjust to life in the U.S., while generating business 
for doctors and other professionals. 
</P>
<P>
The idea is to assist and build good will in the Latino community by providing 
free services such as translation of rental agreements and other legal 
documents, mediation services for tenants and consumers and information on 
immigration questions. 
</P>
<P>
In the process, CPF counselors come across people who need medical, legal and 
insurance services. Those people are referred to professionals, who pay a 
monthly fee to be part of the marketing program. 
</P>
<P>
How much is altruism and how much business? 
</P>
<P>
"Fortunately we've done very well. We had a sense we owed something and wanted 
to give something back," said Dennis Delmonte, one of three principals of 
Spanish Research and Marketing. "Obviously making money is great, but if you 
don't feel good about what you're doing, then what good is it?" 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the business say that their referral system complies with state 
law and the ethical guidelines of the medical and legal professions regarding 
referrals to professional services. 
</P>
<P>
The first CPF office was opened in the Pico-Union District of Los Angeles in 
1986. A second office was established in Montebello last July and a third was 
opened in Santa Ana last month, Rodriguez said. A fourth office is scheduled to 
be opened in San Bernardino within two months. And the advertising firm hopes 
to eventually open offices in the South Bay area, the San Fernando Valley, West 
Los Angeles, Riverside, northern Orange County and San Diego, Delmonte said. 
</P>
<P>
The marketing technique has generated hundreds of referrals for doctors and 
other health professionals, who pay from $3,000 to $5,000 a month to be part of 
the cooperative marketing campaign, Delmonte said. More than 60 professional 
health offices and an insurance company participate, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We helped them (members of the Latino community) with those little problems 
that no one wanted to help them with because it didn't make money," Delmonte 
said. "That good will is coming back." 
</P>
<P>
Jesus Castanon of Los Angeles, for example, sent a $70 money order to a family 
in the Mexican city of Ciudad Juarez. After more than a month, it had not 
arrived and Castanon felt he was getting the runaround when he sought 
reimbursement from Western Union officials in Los Angeles. With the help of 
CPF, Castanon received his refund. There was no charge. 
</P>
<P>
"It was thanks to them more than anything," Castanon said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dispute With Dealer 
</P>
<P>
Leopoldo Lopez of Huntington Park said CPF helped him in a dispute with an auto 
dealer over the amount of money owed by Lopez. Again, there was no charge. 
</P>
<P>
"They resolved the problem," Lopez said. "I'm happy with them." 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez estimated CPF resolves about 15 such cases a month per office. 
</P>
<P>
Spanish Research and Marketing was established in 1978 by Jorge Azpiazu, who 
was born in Argentina, and Tito Alvarez, a native of Puerto Rico. Delmonte, who 
said his parents are from Puerto Rico and Chile, became a partner later. 
</P>
<P>
They started a cooperative marketing campaign for lawyers in 1978 that 
eventually became Centro de Proteccion Legal, a subsidiary of Spanish Research 
and Marketing. Delmonte said lawyers from about 350 offices in Los Angeles, 
Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and San Diego counties pay from $1,500 to 
$9,600 a month to participate in that campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The monthly fee buys them a marketing program, which includes group advertising 
in Spanish-language media, instruction in how to relate to Latino clients and 
other assistance. The average legal office receives from 25 to 50 referrals a 
month from the program, Delmonte said. 
</P>
<P>
Centro de Proteccion Familiar was formed when it became apparent that not 
everyone calling the legal branch needed a lawyer, Delmonte said. Centro de 
Proteccion Familiar uses similar group-advertising and referral techniques. 
Both subsidiaries also publish monthly magazines to provide their target 
audience with information on legal rights, medical and other issues. CPF 
distributes literature from various public agencies on issues ranging from 
consumer protection to drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Screen Professionals 
</P>
<P>
CPF and the legal branch screen participating professionals for expertise and 
sensitivity toward Latinos, Delmonte said. That includes an office visit and a 
check for malpractice lawsuits, he said. Some professionals have been refused 
participation, and others have been expelled, he said. Again, altruism is mixed 
with good business sense. 
</P>
<P>
"There are mills. They treat people like animals. They get them in, they get 
them out and bill," Delmonte said. "We have to get people who are 
conscientious. Every participating office is a reflection of the whole 
program." 
</P>
<P>
CPF works out of sleekly appointed, storefront offices, each with several 
bilingual employees. On a recent week, the Los Angeles office received 226 
calls, while the Montebello office received 243 calls, and Santa Ana had 113, 
according to CPF records. 
</P>
<P>
CPF makes referrals to medical professionals and lawyers in workers 
compensation, personal injury, general-civil, landlord-tenant and medical 
malpractice cases, said Rodriguez, the CPF director. Medical referrals result 
almost entirely from the workers compensation cases, she said. 
</P>
<P>
In those cases, CPF counselors ask the claimant what his injury is, and 
appointments are made with doctors, chiropractors and other medical 
professionals, said CPF spokeswoman Bettina Netri. 
</P>
<P>
Spanish Research and Marketing and participating professionals walk a fine line 
to avoid breaking state law regulating how doctors and lawyers get their 
business, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Medical referrals for profit are prohibited by state law, said Catherine 
Hanson, legal counsel for the California Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
A seldom-enforced state law prohibits "runners" or "cappers" from soliciting 
business for attorneys by frequenting hospitals, courthouses and other public 
and private places, officials said. That allowed for attorney referral 
services, which charge fees and advertise to drum up business. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1987 Legislation 
</P>
<P>
Legislation was enacted in 1987 to regulate attorney referral services to guard 
against price-gouging and other abuses, but those new regulations are under 
review by the state Supreme Court and have not taken effect, said Anne Charles, 
a spokeswoman for the California State Bar. 
</P>
<P>
Delmonte said his operation is legal because participating professionals are 
not guaranteed a set number of referrals for a fee. They are charged for a 
marketing program, from which they expect business as they would from 
traditional advertising, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Charles said the association was not familiar with the marketing practices and 
she, therefore, could not comment. 
</P>
<P>
But an official with the California Medical Assn., after hearing a description 
of CPF's program in an interview, questioned the ethics of the marketing 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"Profit is clearly a criterion, the purpose for making the referral," said Jay 
Michael, the association's vice president for government relations. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce Simmons, a consumer protection analyst with the state attorney general's 
office in Los Angeles, said she reviewed the marketing program more than a year 
ago for fraudulent advertising claims but found no violations. The review was 
done under the auspices of the Immigration and Amnesty Task Force based in the 
the Los Angeles city attorney's office. The operations of many area businesses 
offering services to immigrants were reviewed during the amnesty application 
period. 
</P>
<P>
Referrals aside, Rodriguez said one of her key responsibilities is to teach 
clients that they are not powerless to combat, say, a dishonest landlord or car 
dealer. 
</P>
<P>
Since the inauguration of the immigration amnesty program, more immigrants who 
figure they will be able to stay legally in this country are buying 
large-ticket items such as cars and making other decisions that require 
knowledge of business dealings and legal protections, Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Rodriguez said, the majority of disputes mediated by her counselors 
involve Latino businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of Hispanic businessmen are committing fraud in plain daylight," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for several Los Angeles immigration and consumer agencies and private 
immigrants' rights organizations said they had not heard of CPF or CPL. Some 
said it sounded as if the programs could be providing a valuable community 
service. 
</P>
<P>
But a spokeswoman for the Coalition for Humane Immigration Rights of Los 
Angeles, which is composed of 40 immigrants' rights groups, issued a word of 
caution similar to what Rodriguez and her staff might tell people. 
</P>
<P>
Said spokeswoman Linda Mitchell, "If people are offering you free services and 
referring to somewhere where you have to pay money, you should find out what 
you're getting for your money."

WIDOW OF SLAIN POLICE OFFICER KEEPS GOING BY HELPING OTHERS SURVIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD LEE COLVIN, Colvin is a Redondo Beach free- lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Norma Williams heard last month that a fearsome collision between two 
black-and-white police cars had killed three Los Angeles officers and widowed a 
young wife, the shock and sadness she had felt Oct. 31, 1985, washed over her 
once again. 
</P>
<P>
It was on that night three years ago that her husband of 17 years, Los Angeles 
Police Detective Thomas C. Williams, was gunned down. And "each time we lose an 
officer . . . it brings it all back again," she said. 
</P>
<P>
This was no ordinary police shooting. Williams, 42, was killed at his son's 
Canoga Park school by a career criminal who fired 17 shots with an automatic 
pistol. The assassination was in retaliation for routine testimony Williams 
gave against his killer, Daniel S. Jenkins, in a robbery case that day in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
In the three years since, Norma Williams has shown that she, too, is anything 
but ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
The 44-year-old Canoga Park woman has helped her young son, Ryan, recover from 
the trauma of seeing his father die, and she has become active in the Police 
Department's support group for officers' survivors. She has taken an intense 
interest in the courtroom proceedings that have so far convicted two of the 
five accused in the assassination plot. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'She's No Quitter' 
</P>
<P>
And she has done all of that, her friends say, with characteristic 
determination and good humor. 
</P>
<P>
"Every day has been hard for her," said childhood friend Yvonne Lewandowski, 
who now lives in Valencia. "Every time I see her, every time we talk, there's 
the loneliness, the hurting." 
</P>
<P>
Lewandowski said tears flow at times. "But Norma will let it out, and then 
she'll recharge her batteries and get back in there. She's no quitter." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Williams was a man who loved family camping trips, who helped coach his 
son's soccer games and who laughed at his wife's jokes. In proceedings at Los 
Angeles Superior Court, Williams has seen all that, the life of a man, reduced 
to official evidence: ballistics data, coroner's reports and detailed 
descriptions of meetings during which the crime was planned. 
</P>
<P>
It was also in the Van Nuys courtroom, blocks away from the Williams' first 
home, where she learned that Jenkins had at one point considered the execution 
of other family members. 
</P>
<P>
"She's there in the courtroom, not only for herself, but also for us and for my 
dad," said Susie Williams, 19. "No matter what she sees in court, she's 
strong." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most difficult experience for Williams has been the discovery that 
the justice system her slain husband dutifully defended is not always 
considerate of crime victims' survivors. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers succeeded in barring her from attending most of the trial of 
Jenkins and co-conspirator Ruben A. (Tony) Moss, which opened last January, 
because she was considered by prosecutors to be a potential witness. 
</P>
<P>
From February to the trial's end in June, she had to settle for detailed, daily 
reports from a friend inside the courtroom. She also quizzed Deputy Dist. 
Attys. Richard P. Jenkins and William Gravlin, who prosecuted the case, and 
Major Crimes Detective Michael Thies, who investigated it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Death Sentence 
</P>
<P>
Jenkins was convicted and sentenced to death for planning and executing the 
murder of Tom Williams. Moss, a Jenkins lieutenant who knew about the plot, was 
convicted and was sentenced to life without possibility of parole. (Three other 
men are charged with murder and conspiracy to commit murder; their trial 
started in November and is expected to last until March.) 
</P>
<P>
When Jenkins was sentenced last September, Norma Williams told the court about 
her husband, the man, the lover, the friend. But she had to fight for that 
right too. 
</P>
<P>
Williams was told the night before Jenkins' formal sentencing that she would 
not be allowed to make her statement, a right guaranteed her by the 1982 
California Victims' Bill of Rights Act. 
</P>
<P>
She was told that a 1987 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in a case known as Booth vs. 
Maryland had superseded California law in death-penalty cases and that 
statements from survivors could not be considered before sentencing. Williams 
was allowed to make a statement to the court, but only after the formal 
sentencing had occurred. 
</P>
<P>
"The defense portrayed Jenkins as a loving father, a guy who would do anything 
for his children, who was torn up when his grandmother died," Williams said 
bitterly. 
</P>
<P>
"They are allowed to seek sympathy. Then why can't the victims have that equal 
right to give a character reference for their loved one? Each side should be 
given equal consideration." 
</P>
<P>
When Moss was formally sentenced Dec. 15, Williams was there again. This time, 
because the jury had given Moss a maximum sentence of life in prison without 
the possibility of parole, Williams was allowed to make a statement before Los 
Angeles Superior Court Judge Judith M. Ashmann imposed the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
"Tony Moss, you deserve everything you've got coming to you," she said, looking 
into the eyes of the young man who sat less than 10 feet away. "You are a 
calculating, cold-blooded murderer, and you deserve every bit of pain and 
anguish coming to you all the days of your life." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Williams has tried on her own to restore routine family life, to 
soothe a hurt and to fill an emptiness that will never truly be soothed nor 
filled. 
</P>
<P>
For three weeks after the killing, Williams and her family were under 
continuous police guard. When police became convinced that the assassins had 
been arrested, the guard left. But the terror continued in a different form. 
</P>
<P>
The last three years were rough for Ryan Williams, now 10. There were incidents 
of shoplifting, of lying, of destroying his belongings. "It frightened me 
because I didn't know how long it would go on," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
The boy, who was 6 when his father was killed, is still in therapy. His father 
was picking up Ryan from First Baptist Church school in Canoga Park, and he 
probably saved his son's life when he yelled at him to duck. 
</P>
<P>
Norma Williams said Ryan gradually "has evolved from being a very angry little 
boy to being a very loving, very social little boy." 
</P>
<P>
She has tried to do her husband's job, as an active team mother for Ryan, who 
is developing his father's broad shoulders and long legs and becoming quite a 
presence on the peewee football field. 
</P>
<P>
But it is not easy. Ryan "is really having a rough time not having a dad," 
Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
And, now that her children's shock has passed, "they are more aware of the 
emptiness without their father." 
</P>
<P>
One source of understanding and friendship during the last 3 years has been the 
Los Angeles' Police Department's Family Support Group. The group was formed to 
help surviving spouses and children of police officers who die, whether or not 
it is in the line of duty. 
</P>
<P>
When she heard about the deaths of Police Officers Derrick C. Connor, 28, 
Manuel Gutierrez Jr., 26, and David Hofmeyer, 25, the morning of Dec. 11, 
Williams was quick to call Detective Kena Brutsch, the department's liaison to 
the group. Connor and Gutierrez had been single. But, Williams learned, Lynn 
Hofmeyer was five months pregnant with the couple's first child. 
</P>
<P>
Within hours after the death of a police officer, Brutsch visits a surviving 
spouse to determine what the group might to do help. Then Brutsch contacts 
Williams and another group member, and they pass the news along to the rest of 
the group. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Special Contribution 
</P>
<P>
Part of Williams' involvement is to return the concern the support group has 
shown her. But she also knows that she has something she alone can contribute. 
</P>
<P>
"What I bring to that new widow is that basic experience that no one else could 
understand," she said several days before the Police Department's latest 
tragedy. "I feel good that I'm able to express myself and let her know that the 
feelings she's feeling or going to be feeling are very normal." 
</P>
<P>
Brutsch said the wives of police officers are often overshadowed by their 
husband's careers and that, when a police officer dies, "the first goal is to 
get the ladies to feel better about themselves." 
</P>
<P>
The second goal is to help the women see that they still have a future and to 
help them seize control of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Within the support group, Brutsch said, Williams is a "natural leader" and 
openly talks about her feelings and about her husband. Such openness, Brutsch 
said, has helped other women in the group to express themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Sandy Verna's husband, Paul, was murdered in 1983 while stopping a car for a 
traffic violation. It was Verna who came to the Williams' house, representing 
the family support group, soon after Tom's death, and during the last three 
years, she and Williams have become good friends. 
</P>
<P>
"Norma's faced everything with a lot of intelligence," said Verna, 39, of 
Thousand Oaks. "She was not afraid to ask for help. She was not afraid to ask, 
'What did you do in this situation?' " 
</P>
<P>
Marine Lt. Col. Roger Rowe, who grew up with Tom Williams in Van Nuys and was 
his closest friend, said the most important change he has observed in Norma 
Williams is "the way she has taken the helm." 
</P>
<P>
Rowe said that before his death Tom Williams was clearly in charge in the 
house. Even now, his gold-plated badge, service revolver and other keepsakes 
are prominently displayed in the living room, along with pictures of him taken 
during his 13-year Police Department career. 
</P>
<P>
Williams has surprised herself as well. She said that four years ago she never 
would have thought of herself planning a major home expansion and renovation 
that is nearing completion. Or planning to push for legislation that would make 
killing a police officer a federal crime punishable by death. 
</P>
<P>
(A number of states, including California, Texas, Florida and Maryland, have 
such a law on the books. But, according to Susan Sawyer, the executive director 
of Maryland-based Concerns of Police Survivors, not all states follow the 
directives of the laws.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'My Source of Strength' 
</P>
<P>
Williams said she imagines conversations that she might have had with her 
husband. "I can honestly say that the reason I have maintained my strength is 
Tom, Susie and Ryan," she said. "They are my source of strength. My friends 
have helped me evolve, but everything I have done has been with the thought of 
Tom." 
</P>
<P>
Despite appearing calm and determined, Williams said she feels the stress. The 
Christmas holidays, she said, were particularly difficult. 
</P>
<P>
But she is confident that her time will come. She has a degree in counseling 
from Cal State Northridge and worked for a number of years in personnel before 
her husband's death. 
</P>
<P>
Pensions and insurance policies have left her financially comfortable, but 
eventually Williams would like to return to work, to establish another 
relationship, to see her children grow up and provide her with grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
But, whatever happens, she intends to see the legal process through. She has 
attended several sessions of the second trial, of Reecy Cooper, 33, Voltaire 
Williams, 25, and Duane Moody, 30. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution alleges that the first two had agreed to murder Williams for 
Jenkins but then backed out, and that Moody assisted in the plot in other ways. 
</P>
<P>
She plans to appear at every appeal and every hearing for Jenkins and Moss and 
even, she hopes, at Jenkins' eventual execution. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope my input will have some value," she said. "I definitely would not just 
tuck it away and say, 'Well, it's over and done with.' It's not over. It will 
never be over."

<P>
An excited look swept across Prof. Don Maurer's face as he scanned the clump of 
wet, black mud dredged from the bottom of Alamitos Bay off Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"Really, really good stuff," he told his assembled class of about a dozen Cal 
State Long Beach students. And sure enough, close examination revealed much 
more than a lifeless ball of muck. 
</P>
<P>
Maurer, dressed in a tattered yellow slicker and green-and-white baseball cap, 
hosed away at the ooze in a topside wash basin. He carefully extracted a 
polliwog-sized fish, a tiny shrimp, a worm and a miniature crab, and placed 
them in a petri dish for closer examination under a microscope. 
</P>
<P>
The exercise was intended to show what type of sea life exists in varied ocean 
environments, such as at the bottom of a bay, the mouth of a river or among the 
sea beds in the open ocean. It is all part of a class on paleoecology, in which 
students are taught how to identify ancient environments based on the types of 
fossils found in the sediments. 
</P>
<P>
To give students a firsthand experience, Cal State Long Beach and the 
California State University campuses in Pomona, Dominguez Hills, Fullerton, Los 
Angeles and Northridge share a floating classroom -- the research vessel 
Yellowfin. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Valuable Teaching Aid 
</P>
<P>
Maurer said the use of the specially equipped boat for the nearly four-hour 
expedition is invaluable, showing students existing sea life that they then can 
compare with fossilized ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not just coming from the prophet's mouth. They can see it," the biology 
professor said. 
</P>
<P>
Maurer is one of many Cal State instructors who use the 80-foot aluminum vessel 
as a teaching aid. The boat's missions have been as varied as catching fish 
with line-and-hook near a reef to ferrying a group of recreation majors to 
desolate Santa Barbara Island, where they set up camp for a week. 
</P>
<P>
While other colleges and universities operate research vessels, few, if any, 
have boats reserved primarily for undergraduate instruction, said Anthony Moye, 
vice chancellor of academic affairs for the California State University system. 
</P>
<P>
"If you just lecture about it theoretically, it is not the same if students 
have to run through it themselves," said Murray Dailey, director of the Ocean 
Studies Institute based at Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
He said the floating classroom has been set up to give science students 
firsthand experience with the latest research technology. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Competitive Market' 
</P>
<P>
"It's a competitive market out there (for) our students. We feel we need to 
have state-of-the-art, hands-on equipment. If they apply for a job with the 
same kind of equipment and sampling, it gives them a leg up," said Dailey, a 
biology professor who coordinates use of the Yellowfin among the campuses. 
</P>
<P>
The university system bought the boat for $300,000 two years ago from a company 
that used it for research off Hawaii. Besides being already outfitted for 
scientific work, the boat is 30 feet longer than the old wooden fishing boat it 
replaced, the Nautilus. It has lab and deck space for twice as many students, 
can sleep 11, and has a wide beam that makes it steadier than the Nautilus. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have as many students getting sick," said Prof. Richard Bray, an 
ichthyologist at Cal State Long Beach who uses the boat to teach students about 
different types of fish. "When you have a boat rocking . . . and these fish are 
slopping around, it can be dangerous. The Yellowfin is so much more steady and 
stable." 
</P>
<P>
Besides a lab, the boat has dual radar- and radio-navigation systems, a depth 
meter, fish finder and special marine radios. Three crew members are assigned 
to the boat full time. The budget for crew, fuel and maintenance totals about 
$310,000 a year. The university system is self-insured, negating the need for 
an expensive policy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Former Crewman 
</P>
<P>
The Yellowfin's skipper, Jim Cvitanovich, said his boat will crank along at "an 
honest 10 knots." He was a crewman for 2 years before he became skipper of the 
Nautilus a decade ago. "It's really a good boat job," said Cvitanovich, son of 
a San Pedro fisherman. "You don't have to catch fish to get paid." 
</P>
<P>
Recently, the boat cut through the glassy morning seas en route to five 
different locations, each with a different type of ocean bottom, in Alamitos 
Bay. At each point, a crewman reeled a clamshell-type bucket off a winch on the 
stern to scoop up the muck for Maurer and his students to analyze. 
</P>
<P>
The students liked the boat. Graduate student Chris Grant, 28, said he hopes 
that the oil company that employs him as a research assistant will charter the 
boat so he can collect samples of bottom sediments. The study would prove 
useful not only to the company but provide the data he needs to complete his 
master's thesis as well. 
</P>
<P>
He said the existence of certain "critters" in the samples could help point to 
new locations of oil in the Santa Barbara Channel.

700 WELCOME A NOSTALGIC REAGAN HOME TO CALIFORNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A nostalgic Ronald Reagan, acknowledging that "it was hard to say goodby," 
arrived home in California Friday after taking one last look at the Oval Office 
and leaving two handwritten notes for President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
After a brief airport reception with Mayor Tom Bradley, comedian Rich Little, 
actor Robert Stack and others, the former President and Nancy Reagan where 
whisked by motorcade to their new home in exclusive Bel-Air. 
</P>
<P>
The airport reception attracted about 700 people waving placards that read 
"Welcome Home," "The King and Queen Return" and "Happy Trails Again." 
</P>
<P>
"It has been a bittersweet several hours this day," Reagan told the crowd. 
"There were many wonderful associates that we have been working with the last 
eight years that we had to say goodby to. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have to stay eight years away from California except for an 
occasional visit, you live in a perpetual state of homesickness," Reagan said. 
</P>
<P>
Little kidded the former President about having to find a job, and Reagan -- 
the former actor -- quipped that he had a movie deal in the works. 
</P>
<P>
"I was asked to play a part in a remake of 'Bedtime for Bonzo,' only this time 
they wanted me to play Bonzo," Reagan said. "He wasn't a very friendly type." 
</P>
<P>
During his Hollywood days, Reagan played opposite a mean-tempered chimpanzee in 
"Bedtime for Bonzo." 
</P>
<P>
The Reagans left Andrews Air Force Base, Md., at 10:10 a.m. PST and flew home, 
both vowing to pursue objectives they battled for during Reagan's two terms. 
</P>
<P>
The former first couple waved to a cheering crowd of about 2,000 at Andrews, 
and Reagan received a 21-gun salute as he reviewed a platoon from each of the 
five branches of the military service. Reagan did not address the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
With their dog, Rex, the Reagans boarded the plane that in the previous eight 
years would have been designated Air Force One. A sign in the crowd read "So 
Long Gipper." 
</P>
<P>
About an hour earlier, Reagan stood by as George Bush took the presidential 
oath of office at the Capitol. Bush, who fought Reagan tirelessly for the 
Republican presidential nomination in 1980 before becoming his vice president, 
turned to Reagan after taking the oath and said, "President Reagan, on behalf 
of the American people I thank you for the wonderful things you have done for 
America." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Great Pride' 
</P>
<P>
Reagan, asked while he was walking with Bush through the Rotunda of the Capitol 
if he felt a sense of relief, said, "No, but a great pride in what's 
happening." 
</P>
<P>
After the solemn swearing-in ceremonies and Bush's acceptance speech, Bush and 
his wife, Barbara, escorted the Reagans to the east side of the Capitol to a 
waiting helicopter, where they said their goodbys with handshakes and kisses. 
</P>
<P>
As the Reagans stood in the doorway of the Marine helicopter, Reagan turned and 
snapped a salute to Bush, who returned it. 
</P>
<P>
Asked by a reporter for his final thoughts, Reagan said only, "Carry on." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Joined by Quayles 
</P>
<P>
The Bushes were joined by Vice President Dan Quayle and his wife, Marilyn, who 
waved goodby to the Reagans before their helicopter lifted off and made a 
traditional final sweep of the Mall and White House. 
</P>
<P>
Old foes at home and abroad praised Reagan, the first President to serve eight 
years since Dwight D. Eisenhower gave up the office to John F. Kennedy in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
He is, "according to all external indications, leaving office as a completely 
successful political figure," said Pravda, the official voice of the Soviet 
Union, the nation that Reagan denounced in 1983 as an "evil empire." 
</P>
<P>
Reagan began his final day in office with a nostalgic visit to the Oval Office 
to make sure, according to his spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, that the 
presidential office was shipshape for his successor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'World Is Quiet' 
</P>
<P>
His national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Colin L. Powell, who so often briefed 
Reagan there on trouble spots throughout the globe, told him, "The world is 
quiet today, Mr. President." 
</P>
<P>
Powell's words were relayed to reporters by Fitzwater, who was present during 
the Oval Office visit. 
</P>
<P>
Then, for the last time, Reagan made the walk through an arched colonnade to 
the executive mansion, where he and Mrs. Reagan lived and where the Bushes will 
now live. 
</P>
<P>
In a soft voice, he called out "goodby" to members of the White House staff and 
journalists seeing him off. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Letter to Thatcher 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said the last piece of paper the former President signed was a letter 
to British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, thanking her for her support. In 
London, Thatcher saluted the outgoing President as "a true and perfect 
gentleman." 
</P>
<P>
The First Lady's press secretary, Elaine Crispen, said that after returning to 
the executive mansion Reagan joined his wife in walking hand in hand down the 
central hallway and spending a few minutes in the Yellow Oval room overlooking 
the Washington Monument and Jefferson Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagans also said their goodbys to the domestic staff. 
</P>
<P>
Then, as their final social duty, they offered coffee and pastries in the Blue 
Room to Bush; his wife, Barbara; Vice President-elect Dan Quayle; his wife, 
Marilyn, and members of the congressional delegation sent to escort them all to 
the Capitol for the inauguration. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Last Salute 
</P>
<P>
At the Capitol, Reagan wore a black overcoat and white scarf in chilly, 
overcast weather and Mrs. Reagan wore her familiar red coat as "Hail to the 
Chief" was played for the last time of the Reagan presidency. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan flew on an Air Force plane designated SAM 27000. It was the same plane 
he had flown thousands of miles on as Air Force One when he was President. But 
Air Force One is a radio code reserved for the plane on which the President 
flies and is not used when a sitting President is not on the plane. 
</P>
<P>
From the Los Angeles airport, the Reagans were going by motorcade to the 
fashionable Bel-Air neighborhood and the home that they are renting from 
friends who bought it for $2.5 million. The pool of reporters assigned to fly 
with him from Washington, however, were not included in the motorcade as they 
are on presidential trips. As a private citizen, Reagan gets to travel without 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan has said he plans to speak out on behalf of causes he has long favored, 
such as the line-item veto for presidents and repeal of the constitutional 
amendment limiting them to two terms. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Reagan has lent her support to a drug abuse treatment center planned in a 
bankrupt hospital at Lake View Terrace, 15 miles north of Bel-Air on the edge 
of the Angeles National Forest.

Elderly housewife Leung Wan Chou shops at convenience stores and celebrates 
Thanksgiving since immigrating to the United States, but when it comes to soap 
operas she heads to Chinatown to rent a Cantonese version of "Dallas."

can't sleep," said Leung, who has moved to a middle-class neighborhood outside 
Chinatown since emigrating 20 years ago from Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
Chinatown waiter Hui Ming Kee likes to spend the days of his life watching such 
popular soaps as "Man in a Net" and "Family Feud" (no relation to the American 
TV program), both based loosely on "Dallas." 
</P>
<P>
In one sitting in his one-room apartment, he watched seven three-hour tapes 
without interruption, said Hui, adding that the tapes are his major form of 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
A stream of Asian-Americans, who lease 900 tapes in an average week in one 
Chinatown rental shop, nearly cleared the shelves of the 110 tapes in the 
"Family Feud" series one weekend, the manager said. 
</P>
<P>
"They nearly emptied out our inventory of the more popular tapes just before 
Thanksgiving weekend," said Lily Yee, supervisor of the Hong Kong TV Video shop 
in Chinatown. 
</P>
<P>
The locations are strictly Hong Kong in most tapes and the soaps reflect such 
Confucian ideals as loyalty to the family, respect for one's parents and 
dedication to work. 
</P>
<P>
Shops renting the tapes are springing up in cities including San Francisco, Los 
Angeles and New York. And with more and more Asian cultures taking up the 
practice, imported tapes in Cantonese are now dubbed in Mandarin, Vietnamese, 
Cambodian and Thai. Some include Korean subtitles. 
</P>
<P>
"Overseas Chinese don't want to be completely cut off from their roots," said 
Ernest Wu, director of family counseling at Christian Social Service. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Escape From Pressure 
</P>
<P>
"Watching Hong Kong soaps offers Chinese immigrants an escape from the constant 
pressure of adjusting to a new environment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Chinese tend to hold on to their cultural roots, no matter where they are," 
said Wong Lai Ming, a program coordinator of Self Help for the Elderly, a 
social service organization. Each afternoon, dozens of Asians arrive to view 
Cantonese TV soaps that it shows at two centers in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"These programs are extremely popular with our children," Wong said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the tapes are imported from Hong Kong and are produced by the Hong Kong 
Television Broadcast Corp., or TVB. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Six Rental Shops Opened 
</P>
<P>
TVB first attempted to enter the U.S. market seven years ago when it awarded 
the distribution rights to its videotapes to Hong Kong TV Video Program Inc., a 
San Francisco company. Hong Kong TV has since opened six rental shops in the 
city and provides the tapes to more than 100 dealers in other cities. 
</P>
<P>
At Hong Kong TV stores, customers must pay an initial $180 or $360 fee, which 
allows the customer to take home from 70 to 170 tapes, a few at a time. 
</P>
<P>
Tape distributors in San Francisco's Chinatown said neither TV stations in Hong 
Kong nor the few independent producers in Hong Kong and Taiwan can rival TVB's 
dominance in the U.S. market.

STRESS CLAMPS A HEAVY HAND ON LAWYERS IN NONSTOP TRIAL

<P>
Like a rug that has been tread on too often, a dozen defense lawyers are 
wearing thin in what will become the longest federal criminal trial in U.S. 
history next month, and there is no end in sight. 
</P>
<P>
They are showing the stress and emotional strain of defending a dozen men and 
woman accused of running an interstate drug cartel dubbed "The Company" that 
allegedly resorted to violence to protect its multimillion-dollar operation. 
</P>
<P>
One attorney got a divorce and vows never to practice law again. Another cannot 
meet the demands of his impressive client list. 
</P>
<P>
A third cannot get his law practice off the ground. Yet another says his 
partner is having to pull the load. 
</P>
<P>
All have been greatly affected, even changed, by the year-old trial, both 
personally and professionally -- and mostly negatively. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We Just Hate This Trial' 
</P>
<P>
"We love our jobs. We just hate this trial," Assistant U.S. Public Defender 
Patrick Flanagan said, summing up the feelings among the lawyers who have sat 
on the fifth floor of a Reno courtroom for 169 days over the last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Who knew it would take this long? It wears you down, physically, mentally, 
emotionally. It takes an extra effort each day just to get going, to get back 
to it." 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Steve Wassner agreed. "The hardest part is just not knowing when it's 
going to end, when you can get on with your life and your practice." 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution rested its case Jan. 11, eight days before the 
Nevada-California drug conspiracy trial's first anniversary. By conservative 
estimates, the defense is expected to take at least four months. 
</P>
<P>
The record for a federal trial in the United States is held by a case in 
Newark, N.J., that ended last year with the acquittal of 20 reputed members and 
associates of the Lucchese organized crime family. The trial lasted 21 months, 
but consumed only 187 actual trial days from the beginning of jury selection. 
</P>
<P>
When the Reno trial resumes Jan. 24, it will be one year and five days old and 
in its 170th court day. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Costs Approach $8 Million 
</P>
<P>
Court officials said costs for the pretrial investigation, the trial itself, 
salaries of the prosecutors and fees of the appointed defense attorneys have 
inched toward $8 million. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Anthony White defended the price tag, noting that laws 
allow the government to seize property and proceeds from criminals. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, he said, "The Company" had $2 million to $3 million in assets the 
government is targeting for seizure. Last year, he said the government seized 
$57 million from criminals in this country. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the time, prosecution of these types of offenses makes money for the 
federal government," White said. 
</P>
<P>
White said he, too, is feeling the strain of working weekends and nights, but 
defended the length of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to understand the significance of this case," he said. "These people 
are accused of providing drugs to children. We're not just talking about people 
who made dope. We're talking about people who killed people." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the trial before U.S. District Judge Edward C. Reed was not supposed to 
last more than six months. 
</P>
<P>
"If I would have known it was going to go this long I wouldn't have taken the 
case," said attorney Larry McNabney. 
</P>
<P>
"I've gotten a divorce during this trial. I've gone through a lot of personal 
changes. I'm not saying it's directly the result of this trial. But the 
pressure has speeded things up. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Maybe I'll Play the Flute' 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'm going to quit practicing after this is over. Seriously. Maybe I'll 
play the flute or take a year off and do nothing. If I never set foot into a 
courtroom again after this it will be too soon." 
</P>
<P>
Wassner said he used to have a reputation for taking great vacations to 
different places around the world -- and for the frequency of the trips. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't been on vacation for more than 1 1/2 years. That's just unimaginable 
for me," said Wassner, who commutes to Reno an hour each way from his home at 
Lake Tahoe. 
</P>
<P>
Worse yet, the trial has put a noose on the former state public defender's 
fledgling law practice. 
</P>
<P>
Wassner left the state office just before his appointment to "The Company" 
case, set up an office and put an ad in the Yellow Pages. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I'll Have Nothing' 
</P>
<P>
"It's all gone to waste," he said. "I've been turning people down. I can't take 
on new cases. At the end of this trial, I'll have nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Attorney John Aebi, who has been practicing for seven years, had built up an 
impressive client list, including the Nevada Industrial Relations Division. 
</P>
<P>
When a huge rocket fuel plant blew up in Henderson, Nev., in May, 1988, Aebi 
was virtually powerless to help the division handle the cases of hundreds of 
injured workers and two employee deaths at the plant. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't lose them as clients," a frustrated Aebi said. "But I had to bring in 
help. This trial has just crippled my practice. I've got two office employees 
who I don't want to fire but who are sitting around, well, with not as much to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
Aebi also is a lobbyist for several groups but will not be able to provide 
full-time help in the Nevada Legislature, which opened its 1989 session Jan. 
16. 
</P>
<P>
He estimated that it will take him at least a year to get back on track when 
the trial does end. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Becomes Withdrawn 
</P>
<P>
Larry Wishart, an introspective local attorney, has grown a beard throughout 
the long months of the trial and, by his own accounts, has withdrawn and become 
difficult to be around. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to get into details, but there is personal friction you have to 
deal with," he said. "This trial has affected everyone personally. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be alert in there every day in order to make objections and 
represent your client. It's stressful. The difference between a normal trial 
and this one is the difference between acute stress and chronic stress. This 
stress goes on and on." 
</P>
<P>
Lawyer David Nielsen was doing his partner, Ben Walker, a favor when he took on 
"The Company" trial. Normally a civil attorney, Nielsen was forced into the 
criminal drug trial when Walker became tied up in a prolonged child sex abuse 
case in Carson City. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Nielsen said, Walker has to shoulder some of his load. Sometimes they have 
to turn away potential clients. Others go elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"Some clients just can't hang with you," said Nielsen, who along with his peers 
puts in 12-hour days and often works weekends and nights. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Like Working Two Jobs' 
</P>
<P>
Flanagan said that as the only public defender in northern Nevada, his 
colleagues must be flown up from Las Vegas for even simple arraignments in 
Reno, although he tries to keep up with other cases while "The Company" trial 
continues. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like working two jobs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Financially, some of the attorneys are doing worse and others better. As 
appointed lawyers, the government pays them $60 an hour, about half of what 
many charge in private practice. 
</P>
<P>
But Nielsen pointed out that "The Company" case is steadier employment than 
some attorneys have, so the money is always flowing in. 
</P>
<P>
Amid the burnout of the job and the personal and professional hardships, the 
group of attorneys said they had become close from the shared experience. Some 
joked that the ties that bind are similar to what hostages might feel.

EMBRYONIC BIOTECHNOLOGY PROMISES HUGE EARNINGS DESPITE REGULATION

<P>
Miracle cures and cheaper, healthier food are on the horizons of biotechnology, 
but for companies able to cope with the regulatory patchwork of the embryonic 
industry the future holds huge earnings. 
</P>
<P>
The Industrial Biotechnology Assn. predicts that sales, now estimated at $600 
million, will rise to between $25 billion and $30 billion in the year 2000 and 
between $75 billion and $100 billion in 2025. 
</P>
<P>
"The first impact is going to clearly be on the medical side," said James 
McCamant, editor of Medical Technology Stock Letter in Berkeley, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
Genetically engineered products to cure AIDS and some cancers, to make pork and 
beef leaner and healthier and to protect crops from insects, weeds and weather 
are just a few of the promises held out by the industry. 
</P>
<P>
"You will see biotechnology products all over the shelves in the next few 
years. It will creep into your life and continue to accelerate. Fifteen years 
from now we can't even speculate," McCamant said. 
</P>
<P>
The United States remains the leader in all aspects of biotechnology -- 
diagnostics, medicine, forensics and agriculture, analysts say. But Japan and 
Western European nations are making inroads, partly due to a strong government 
role in financing and, in some cases, looser regulations. 
</P>
<P>
"Funding for the basic sciences has gone down in the last 10 years. We're being 
hit pretty hard by the Germans, the English and the Japanese," said Jim 
Gramlich, director of American Cyanamid Co.'s agriculture research center in 
Princeton. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
California Among Leaders 
</P>
<P>
California, Massachusetts, Wisconsin, North Carolina and New Jersey are the 
states having the most companies with biotech connections, IBA spokeswoman 
Sherrod Shim said. States benefit in taxes and jobs by supporting biotechnology 
and can be good sources of start-up funds, state biotech center officials 
state. 
</P>
<P>
However, in the long run, the New Jersey Center for Advanced Biotechnology and 
Medicine hopes to attract federal support and backing from pharmaceutical 
companies, said Robert Namovicz, the center's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
Agencies like the National Institutes of Health and the National Science 
Foundation have responded to challenges from abroad in recent years with more 
grants to universities and industry, but not everyone sees that as an answer. 
</P>
<P>
"They are good to a certain point. They're more directed toward the research, 
and what we're really about is developing a commercial product," said Don Reed, 
chief financial officer of Massachusetts' Cambridge BioScience Corp. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. companies have not yet taken their business to countries with looser 
regulations, such as France or Italy, said Jeff Gibbs, one of three authors of 
"Biotechnology and the Environment: International Regulation." 
</P>
<P>
But it could happen, Gibbs said, even though the European Community is studying 
whether to establish uniform rules that would probably lean toward those in 
countries like Denmark and West Germany, where the stronger influence of 
environmental groups has led to tougher regulation. 
</P>
<P>
What companies are doing is taking advantage of the newness of the U.S. 
regulatory environment. The Patent and Trademark Office, facing a backlog of 
more than 6,000 biotech applications, asked the industry association in early 
November to train more patent examiners to handle the caseload. 
</P>
<P>
All over the country, companies are racing to develop new products. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
AIDS Diagnosis Technique 
</P>
<P>
Cetus Corp., of Emeryville, Calif., has worked to develop polymerase chain 
reaction which lets scientists magnify a single piece of DNA, the molecule that 
carries genetic information. Cetus president Robert Fildes said PCR simplifies 
diagnosticians' task of finding viruses from infected cells. It can determine 
in hours if a cell has been infected with AIDS, for example, something that 
would take six weeks using tests in a culture medium, Fildes said. 
</P>
<P>
Lifecodes Corp., of Tarrytown, N.Y., is offering DNA tests to determine the 
guilt or innocence of criminal suspects from body fluids. Company spokeswoman 
Karen Wexler said Lifecodes will soon offer a kit that tests DNA samples of 
suspects' blood or semen to match them to samples taken from the crime. 
</P>
<P>
Turf battles between federal agencies trying to decide jurisdiction for each 
new biotechnology product and the constantly changing science complicate the 
task of companies seeking a piece of the market, said Jan Kurtz, with the 
science advisory board for the federal Environmental Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to make a patchwork quilt," Kurtz said. "It's not easy to 
promulgate new legislation. The questions are all new." 
</P>
<P>
Faye Peterson, a Food and Drug Administration spokeswoman, said the regulatory 
process does not differ greatly from that for other products submitted to the 
agency. Regulation levels are appropriate and do not require further expansion, 
an assessment shared by most company officials, she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Warnings of Dangers 
</P>
<P>
However, Mike Cannell of the Wisconsin Family Farm Defense Fund Inc., a group 
opposed to biotechnology in agriculture for economic and safety reasons, said, 
"It doesn't take a black heart to imagine the worst when the chemical companies 
are supplying most of the regulatory data." 
</P>
<P>
Groups like Cannell's and the Washington-based Foundation on Economic Trends 
contend that the dangers of biotechnology have not been sufficiently examined. 
Critics point to herbicides and pesticides that were once considered harmless 
and have been proven to pollute ground water as reason to doubt the motives of 
any industry that is being regulated. 
</P>
<P>
The industry says fears of genetically engineered bacteria running wild mislead 
the public and legislators into seeking to toughen the regulatory road. 
</P>
<P>
"The risks are sometimes greatly exaggerated of nature gone wild. We all grew 
up on the same movies of giant spiders that escaped laboratories and ate 
Chicago," said Hugh A. D'Andrade, executive vice president of Schering-Plough 
Corp. in Madison and vice chairman of the industry association. 
</P>
<P>
More plausible dangers involve weed-control experiments that could backfire 
with the wrong gene implanted, letting the weed reproduce, and even that would 
be highly improbable because researchers start experiments with some idea of 
which genes accomplish what ends, D'Andrade said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Smaller Firms' Troubles 
</P>
<P>
The specialized knowledge and costly equipment required will keep the 
technology out of the wrong hands, and regulation coupled with companies' wish 
not to damage their credibility will keep products from being rushed onto the 
market without proper safeguards, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Drake, a spokeswoman for Monsanto Co. in St. Louis, said that the company 
is used to regulatory mazes but that it is harder for smaller firms. "We're 
used to working within those kinds of boundaries. But a lot of smaller 
companies are bothered by regulations because it's so expensive and takes so 
much time." 
</P>
<P>
Smaller companies living off initial investment capital all feel pressure in an 
uncertain market to put products on the shelves, American Cyanamid's Gramlich 
said. "They can only survive so long in savings and research contracts. I don't 
think any company can put 50 to 60% into research as some of these have and 
survive long." 
</P>
<P>
Smaller companies like Epitope Inc. of Beaverton, Ore., can no longer ask 
investors to wait, as in the early days of biotechnology, said Michael Hubbard, 
president. "They're not satisfied with companies any more that say, 'We're 
going to lose money for six or seven years.' 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Very Applicable Things' 
</P>
<P>
"We've geared our work to very applicable things rather than heading into 
long-term things like cancer treatment." 
</P>
<P>
The competition could also reduce the number of companies. Executives predict 
that one-third of the industry will be acquired within five years and nearly 
half within 10 years, according to "Biotech 89: Commercialization," a report by 
Arthur Young Co.

HIJACK ALERTS AT ASIAN AIRPORTS;

SECURITY CRACKDOWN TURNS UP FAKE VISAS

<TEXT>
<P>
An alert among Asian airports against possible hijackings has revealed a large 
number of people traveling with fake documents. 
</P>
<P>
Manila airport officials said these would-be immigrants have been bounced back 
and forth by countries that did not want them. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a Ping-Pong ball," said Ruben Domingo, head of immigration 
intelligence at Manila International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Airports in the region have tightened security since a warning early this month 
that Palestinian guerrillas planned to hijack an Asian airliner. 
</P>
<P>
Domingo said that since then alert immigration personnel have been turning away 
one or two foreigners a day with fake or insufficient travel documents, most of 
whom are from Asia or the Middle East. That was up from an average of two or 
three a week over the last six months. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fake Canadian Visas 
</P>
<P>
He said that in the last two days of December officials expelled three Chinese 
holding fake Canadian visas, an Iraqi with an altered Saudi Arabian passport 
and a woman describing herself as Palestinian and carrying a false U.S. 
passport. 
</P>
<P>
He said many people turned away were sent back and forth several times between 
the same countries. A Chinese-speaking man with a fake Filipino passport was 
sent back and forth between Hong Kong and the Philippines five times, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A Western official of an international humanitarian organization said some 
individuals without legal papers spent years "in orbit," either locked away in 
immigration detention centers or deported from one country to another. 
</P>
<P>
Domingo said that for years Manila had the reputation of being one of the 
easiest capitals to travel through illegally, but security had become tighter 
over the last year. 
</P>
<P>
Last February the immigration commissioner described Manila as the "world's 
capital" for obtaining fake passports, with around 80 syndicates operating in 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fakes Previously Used 
</P>
<P>
Domingo said many of the forged travel papers recently confiscated indicated 
that they had been used successfully before in getting the illegal traveler 
through the airport. 
</P>
<P>
"Things are a lot stricter now. . . . We can no longer accept the rejects of 
other countries," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In Canberra, an immigration department spokesman said Australia deals with 
about 2,000 cases of forged passports a year, and considers itself one of the 
toughest countries to enter using forged documents. 
</P>
<P>
In Japan an immigration official at Tokyo International Airport said about 
7,500 foreign arrivals -- mostly from Asian countries -- were refused entry in 
1988 because of forged entry documents. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese Foreign Ministry said Japan plans to suspend its mutual visa 
exemption agreements with Bangladesh and Pakistan due to an increase in illegal 
entrants.

LEBANESE FEUDAL ELITE -- PASSING OF AN ERA BRINGS MIXED FEELINGS IN TROUBLED

They were wealthy, educated, cosmopolitan in their taste for the finer things 
of life. 
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's feudal elite ran the country as a private club, with a restricted 
membership and an etiquette handed down from father to son. 
</P>
<P>
Christian or Muslim, they were often landowners on a grand scale or members of 
the intelligentsia with enough family money to buy themselves a newspaper to 
run or a safe seat in Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Some were ruthless, ready to use violence to safeguard their 
states-within-a-state to the extent of calling the U.S. Marines to come ashore 
and help out. 
</P>
<P>
Even today, especially in rural areas, the surviving elite of the old Lebanon 
are still revered. 
</P>
<P>
But Lebanon will not see their like again, and their passing evokes mixed 
feelings. 
</P>
<P>
Some regard this fading generation as including people who invited foreign 
intervention and were largely to blame for the civil war that broke out 13 
years ago and still shows no sign of ending. 
</P>
<P>
"These effete people designed the system that got us into this mess," said a 
senior militia officer, a man in his 30s from a poor family and with a radical 
view of Lebanon's ills. 
</P>
<P>
For others, particularly the middle class, a decline of the ancient regime and 
a diminution in stature of the surviving gentry leave a vacuum in leadership. 
After all, had not several statesmen emerged from the old national elite? 
</P>
<P>
Taqi Eddine Solh, a former premier who died last month at age 79, was regarded 
as a gentleman of the old school and very much a moderating influence. 
</P>
<P>
Scion of a prominent Sunni Muslim family, he was educated at the American 
University of Beirut and began a career as a journalist. 
</P>
<P>
Twice premier, he was one of the architects of the 1943 National Pact, which 
sought to contain the fires of communal competition by dividing top 
governmental jobs along religious lines, so everyone got a share. 
</P>
<P>
That was the theory. In practice, many Lebanese say, some got a lot more than 
others and the system simply papered over the cracks instead of building a real 
sense of identity. 
</P>
<P>
The last surviving politician who helped formulate the pact is Shia Defense 
Minister Adel Osseiran, a landowner from southern Lebanon and, at 83, a man 
still admired for his personal charm and gentle approach to intractable 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
A very different man was former President Camille Chamoun, who died last year 
at age 87. 
</P>
<P>
A hard-line champion of Christian prerogatives, his attempts to draw Lebanon 
into the Baghdad Pact -- a British-sponsored buffer against a tide of Arab 
nationalism personified by the late Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser -- 
precipitated the country's first civil war in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
Chamoun's response was to invite the United States to intervene, and U.S. 
Marines landed at Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
A northern warlord politically active at least until a few months ago is former 
President Suleiman Franjieh. His close personal friendship with Syrian 
President Hafez Assad dates back to 1957, when Franjieh sought refuge in Syria 
after a gunfight with another northern clan in a village church. 
</P>
<P>
Also a Maronite Christian, he ran again as candidate in Lebanon's presidential 
election in August at the age of 78 -- but Christian deputies opposed to Syrian 
influence in the country boycotted Parliament, and the vote failed to take 
place. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, outgoing President Amin Gemayel handed over the reins of office -- 
what little there was of it -- to a Christian army officer of modest origins, 
Michel Aoun, who set up an administration to rival a Muslim-led Cabinet in West 
Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
Gemayel may be the last of his Maronite family to play a prominent role in 
national affairs. 
</P>
<P>
His father, Pierre Gemayel, formed the Falangist party in 1936. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, Amin's younger brother Bashir was elected president in the wake of the 
Israeli invasion.

ONLY 911 PEOPLE IN TOWN; 
</P>
<P>
THESE REPORTERS REALLY KNOW READERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The reporters on the Roosevelt Bulletin know their readers. Almost all of them. 
</P>
<P>
There are just 911 people in this central New Jersey town, which was founded as 
a social experiment in 1936 and named after FDR. 
</P>
<P>
"But there are a lot of people expecting babies," Honey Socholitzky said. 
</P>
<P>
Socholitzky, 78, is copy editor at the monthly newspaper, which is staffed by 
volunteers who cover the school board, the planning board and their neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
The staff is serious about its work. Since the Bulletin began as a mimeographed 
newsletter 11 years ago, it has grown into a sharp tabloid of 24 pages, neatly 
laid out with modern graphics. 
</P>
<P>
Its content also has evolved. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a small town with some fairly large problems," the editor, Mark 
Zuckerman, said. "We have some big decisions that have to be made." 
</P>
<P>
Reporters write about happenings such as the geese that camped at the town's 
only gas station, but they also pay close attention to the issues. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Improvements Needed 
</P>
<P>
Decisions must be made on how to pay for updating the sewer system and making 
school repairs. The Bulletin reports the potential solutions and residents take 
to the opinion columns. 
</P>
<P>
"We've become a little more hard-newsy," Socholitzky said. "There are a lot of 
problems in town, in that some people want to see it grow and some don't." 
</P>
<P>
About 600 acres of city-owned farmland is in the path of builders, and 
residents are debating whether to sell it to help pay for some of the needed 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people think if we let in the developers we can double the population and 
bring in some money," Zuckerman said. "Some people don't think that's such a 
great idea." 
</P>
<P>
The growth debate keeps Bob Clark busy on his planning board beat. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always just had a desire to stay involved in the affairs of the 
community, " he said. "It gets to be a bit of a drain because you have to keep 
up with it, going to meetings and so on, but it's worth it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
State-Employed Reporter 
</P>
<P>
Clark said his "real" job, as deputy director of the state division of 
investigation, precludes him from holding political office, but writing for the 
Bulletin gives him an outlet. 
</P>
<P>
"Occasionally, someone will question the objectivity of a hard news story, but 
I chalk that up to them not getting their favorite quote printed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper is no more unusual than the the town. Roosevelt, an experiment in 
socialism founded with New Deal financing, was established by immigrant Jews 
who moved here from New York. 
</P>
<P>
Garment workers here made coats in the winter for sale in a cooperative factory 
and raised their own food in summer. The experiment failed after three years, 
but the town remained. 
</P>
<P>
Like most of the newspaper's staff, Clark and Socholitzky have non-journalism 
backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters' articles are edited in an office owned by Zuckerman's company; 
Zuckerman takes care of the graphics on a computer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Purist' Does Editing 
</P>
<P>
To Socholitzky, the editing is of paramount importance. 
</P>
<P>
"I took a two-year hiatus once, but I had to come back because I wasn't 
satisfied with the quality of the editing," she said. "I'm a purist, 
grammatically." 
</P>
<P>
And she is picky. 
</P>
<P>
She once discovered a grammatical error in the listing of ingredients on a baby 
food label. 
</P>
<P>
"I wrote (the company) and said I didn't want to raise a baby on a baby food 
with a split infinitive in it," she said. "They wrote back and said they had 
already printed thousands of labels, but would correct their error on the next 
printing. And they did."

CAR WARS;

<P>
'STING' INFLAMES TAXI TURF BATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY and BARBARA KOH, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the citizen arrests made and the handcuffs put away, with the undercover 
photographs taken and the "sting" operation shelved, there still appears to be 
no resolution in sight to the festering taxicab war in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The clash has pitted the Valley Cab Co., holder of an exclusive Los Angeles 
taxi service franchise for the Valley, against Super Car Service, a small, 
upstart company that holds a charter car service permit from the state. 
</P>
<P>
Valley Cab officials have accused Super Car of illegally operating a taxi 
service and stealing their business. Super Car officials counter that they 
stick to their charter business, following rules that bar them from cruising 
streets, cabstands or hotels. 
</P>
<P>
It is a tempest in a taxicab that brewed for six months before finally spilling 
into police stations and the courts this month. 
</P>
<P>
Though the dispute focuses on the finer points of what a charter service permit 
allows, it clearly has not been just a war of words. Two weeks ago a group of 
Valley Cab drivers and an off-duty police officer carried out an unofficial 
sting operation, handcuffing and arresting seven Super Car drivers for 
allegedly operating "bandit," or illegal, taxicabs in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Declined to Prosecute 
</P>
<P>
The city attorney's office declined to prosecute the citizen arrests, and the 
city's Department of Transportation has said it has no authority to investigate 
complaints about Super Car Service because that is the state's responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
And on Thursday, a judge let lapse a preliminary injunction that barred Super 
Car from acting as a taxi service. The Superior Court injunction had been 
issued Dec. 30, and a hearing will determine later whether Super Car has been 
improperly operating a cab service. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, state officials said they had not been asked to look into the flap 
and, because of sparse staffing, they would need a written complaint before 
acting. 
</P>
<P>
Undeterred, Valley Cab officials said the war will continue. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to stop going after violators," said George Piadra, a general 
manager for Valley Cab. "They are illegally taking our business away. We are 
going to do something about it. The city isn't doing anything, so we will." 
</P>
<P>
Ivik Sarkisian, president of Super Car, vehemently disagrees and attributes the 
friction to David-and-Goliath-type clashes between a new, fledgling business 
and an entrenched giant. 
</P>
<P>
"That's all baloney," Sarkisian said of Valley Cab's accusations. "They have a 
monopoly in the Valley, and they don't want any competition. We are operating 
legally." 
</P>
<P>
The cab squabble began eight months ago when the North Hollywood-based Super 
Car Service opened for business with a fleet of nine cars. Sarkisian has a 
permit from the state Public Utilities Commission that allows him to operate 
the charter car service. 
</P>
<P>
The permit does not allow its holder to run a regular cab service, said Mike 
Nakasone, a utilities commission enforcement officer. But it does permit Super 
Car to offer a service in which rides are reserved in advance -- usually by 
phone -- and costs are computed per mile. 
</P>
<P>
A charter car cannot have a fare meter or a taxi dome light, and it cannot wait 
for riders at cabstands or pick up customers who flag it down on the street, 
Nakasone said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Noticed Competition 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Super Car opened, Valley Cab drivers began to notice they had 
competition, said Tom Hefferan, another general manager for the Van Nuys-based 
fleet of 71 taxis. 
</P>
<P>
Valley Cab has been the only taxi service licensed by the city to do business 
in the Valley since 1981. It is one of eight firms the city has licensed to 
operate in different parts of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The companies pay about $64 a month per cab for the right to cruise for fares 
in their assigned sections of the city. While each company can respond to phone 
requests from anywhere in the city, they are not allowed to advertise outside 
of their assigned areas. 
</P>
<P>
The city has licensed taxis since 1915, said David Leatherman, an engineer in 
the Department of Transportation's regulation and enforcement division. The 
arrangement allows the city to regulate safety, insurance and service standards 
of taxis and ensures that the companies can make a profit. 
</P>
<P>
City transportation department officials said they are considering revamping 
the franchising system when the taxi companies' permits expire in July. The new 
plan includes a proposal to allow a second company to operate in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had resistance from Valley Cab, but we've had resistance from everybody 
when that happens," Leatherman said. "We think the market's there, the need's 
there." 
</P>
<P>
John E. de Brauwere, Super Car's attorney, said the clash has developed because 
a company licensed by a different government -- in this case, the state -- to 
provide car service has entered the Valley to compete with the city's license 
holder for taxi service. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a strange case," de Brauwere said. "I can understand why Valley Cab has 
gotten its nose out of joint. But both companies have a right to operate." 
</P>
<P>
Valley Cab officials disagree. Shortly after noticing Super Car was in 
business, they started watching the smaller company closely. 
</P>
<P>
Off-duty Valley Cab drivers called for rides from Super Car and kept notes on 
how the company operated. They clipped Super Car advertisements in the 
"taxicabs" section of the local Yellow Pages. They photographed Super Car 
automobiles, which are painted school-bus yellow with orange stripes. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody would have to tell you it wasn't a cab for you to know," Hefferan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Accused of 'Guzzling' 
</P>
<P>
Worst of all, Hefferan claimed, Valley Cab drivers have watched Super Car 
drivers "guzzling" riders -- cabbie parlance for listening in on a competitor's 
dispatch radio frequency and then beating the driver to a pick-up spot to snare 
the unsuspecting rider. Super Car officials denied this. 
</P>
<P>
Hefferan said that after Valley Cab put together what he believes is solid 
evidence of Super Car's wrongdoing, the company informed the city Department of 
Transportation's bandit cab unit, which is charged with getting unlicensed cabs 
off the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Operating without a taxi license is a misdemeanor, with a penalty of up to six 
months in jail and a $1,000 fine. There are as many as 600 bandit cabs in the 
city in addition to 1,150 licensed cabs, according to Los Angeles Department of 
Transportation estimates. 
</P>
<P>
Bobbie L. Walker, head of the city's bandit unit, said he began an 
investigation of Super Car but ended it without taking action against the 
company. He said city transportation officials decided that because Super Car 
operates through a state Public Utilities Commission permit, the company fell 
under the jurisdiction of state investigators. 
</P>
<P>
"The city can't investigate them for violations of state regulations. The state 
has to determine that," Walker said. "We can only enforce the rules on cars 
that we license" or that have no license or permit at all. 
</P>
<P>
"The consensus was that any arrests we would make would be no good because if 
any laws were broken they would be state laws," Walker said. "In my opinion, 
they are using the state permit to get around the city's license." 
</P>
<P>
Valley Cab next took its case to Van Nuys Superior Court. On Dec. 30, Judge 
David R. Nisall granted a preliminary injunction ordering Super Car to stop 
operating a taxi service. He ordered the company not to advertise or solicit 
taxi service in the Valley or to try to "pass off" any of its vehicles as 
licensed cabs. 
</P>
<P>
But Valley Cab's victory was short-lived. The ruling did not eliminate its 
problem, it only set the stage for the company to take matters into its own 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
Hefferan said Super Car ignored the order. Sarkisian said his company had no 
choice because the judge ordered Super Car to stop doing something that it had 
not been doing. 
</P>
<P>
"We never were acting as a cab service in the first place," Sarkisian said. "We 
have stayed within the state PUC codes. I am not supposed to have the lights on 
top of my cars or the meters. I don't. We are not supposed to pick up flag-down 
fares. We don't. Anyway you look at it, I am not a taxi service." 
</P>
<P>
But Valley Cab representatives said they are unswayed by such subtle 
distinctions. 
</P>
<P>
"If it looks like a duck, sounds like a duck and eats like a duck, then it's a 
duck," said Valley Cab attorney Steven M. Neimand. "They are trying to fall 
through a crack and say as long as we don't have a meter and top light, we can 
operate." 
</P>
<P>
Frustrated by their unsuccessful effort to get Super Car off the road, Valley 
Cab officials hired off-duty Glendale police officer Ronald Jenkins and planned 
their sting operation. 
</P>
<P>
By Jan. 7, they were ready to strike. Hefferan and a Valley Cab driver called 
Super Car from a phone booth in Van Nuys and arranged for a ride while Jenkins 
waited at another location. 
</P>
<P>
What happened next is a matter of opinion and dispute. Valley Cab officials 
charged that by answering the call and providing a ride to the two men, Super 
Car was operating as a taxi service in violation of city law. 
</P>
<P>
Super Car officials said they were simply operating in accordance with their 
state permit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Waiting With Handcuffs 
</P>
<P>
Regardless, when the Super Car vehicle took the two riders to their 
destination, Jenkins, who had been on unpaid administrative leave from the 
Glendale Police Department since August, 1987, was waiting with handcuffs. He 
told the driver he was under arrest, read him his legal rights, cuffed him and 
hauled him to the Van Nuys police station. 
</P>
<P>
Police processed the paper work, and the driver was released on his own 
recognizance. The Valley Cab team made six more citizen arrests of Super Car 
drivers over the next three days. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Don Lawrence called the arrests "a little unusual. Normally, citizens 
will report a crime. But it's not regular that citizens will actually bring in 
a suspect." 
</P>
<P>
And while the use of handcuffs may have seemed excessive, it may not have been 
improper, Lawrence added. Citizens can use "reasonable force necessary to hold 
the suspect," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jenkins, who has accused the Glendale Police Department of discriminating 
against him because he is black, has been on leave awaiting a ruling on his 
claims that he has suffered severe emotional distress because of the 
harassment. 
</P>
<P>
Super Car officials said the arrests were uncalled for, the dispute has cost 
them business, and they are considering filing a lawsuit against Valley Cab in 
retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
"They are really bad-mouthing Super Car," de Brauwere said. "We have noticed a 
tremendous decline in patronage." 
</P>
<P>
The unofficial sting operation came to a screeching halt when police refused to 
take the Super Car drivers after the sixth and seventh citizen arrests. 
</P>
<P>
The city attorney's office declined to file charges against the Super Car 
drivers because of insufficient evidence gathered by Valley Cab, said Martin 
Vranicar, supervising deputy in the city attorney's Van Nuys office. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't meet the filing guidelines for bandit taxi cab operations," 
Vranicar said of the seven cases. "These cases were done by private individuals 
and not by professionals. We do not encourage private citizens to investigate 
crimes because of the possibility of violence, danger, not knowing whether it's 
really a crime and not understanding what evidence is necessary." 
</P>
<P>
Hefferan expressed disappointment in the city's stance. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not fair. It's very frustrating," he said. "The city doesn't pay enough 
attention to it. They should be protecting the companies they franchise." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Injunction Expires 
</P>
<P>
Valley Cab suffered another setback on Thursday when Associate Court of Appeal 
Judge Richard Amerian, sitting in Superior Court, continued until Feb. 3 a 
hearing on the company's request for a permanent injunction against Super Car. 
In doing so, he allowed a preliminary injunction against Super Car to expire. 
</P>
<P>
With no court order stopping Super Car from operating and the city staying out 
of the dispute, the Public Utilities Commission, the agency that gave Super Car 
its permit, may be Valley Cab's last resort. Late last week, Valley Cab 
officials indicated they may soon file a request with the commission to 
investigate the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Super Car attorney de Brauwere agreed that state officials ultimately may hold 
the key to peace in the dispute. He said state legislators someday may have to 
consider changing utilities commission codes to better define the role of 
charter services. 
</P>
<P>
"They should all get their heads together and decide the exact parameters of 
how a charter party service can operate," he said.

COUNTY'S CALL FOR SURCHARGE SNAGS TRADE FOR STATE PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN O'SHAUGHNESSY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A long-awaited swap between the state and Los Angeles County of two large parks 
could be jeopardized by the county's desire to be compensated because it says 
its land is far more valuable. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides had agreed to trade the county's Tapia Park in Agoura for the 
state's Placerita Canyon Nature Center in the Santa Clarita Valley. The unusual 
swap, first suggested by homeowner activists in the Las Virgenes area three 
years ago, seemed ideal for both parties. 
</P>
<P>
The county would no longer have to bear the expense of Tapia, which residents 
complain has deteriorated rapidly from lack of attention. Tapia would be 
absorbed into the nearby Malibu Creek State Park and a campground would be 
built on the property. In return, the county would own the Placerita Canyon 
Nature Center, which it has been operating anyway for decades. 
</P>
<P>
But the agreement hit a snag recently when the county received appraisals of 
the two properties. At the county's behest, a private appraiser assessed the 
value of Tapia's 111 acres at $8.7 million and Placerita's 331 acres at $2.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The county has decided to ask that the state compensate it for the large 
disparity in value. Park officials said they might request that the state pay 
for the construction of a campground at Castaic Lake Recreation Area or 
purchase additional property next to the Placerita Canyon Nature Center. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Balance Out the Value' 
</P>
<P>
"We're just looking at the possibility of trying to balance out the value of 
the property," said James I. Okimoto, the county's acting director of the 
Department of Parks and Recreation. 
</P>
<P>
But a top state park official said the deal will collapse if the county insists 
on any reimbursement. The state has no discretionary money to pay the county, 
and its share of revenue from Proposition 70 -- the park bond issue approved by 
voters in June -- already has been earmarked in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
"We just don't have it," said Allen Ulm, deputy regional director of the state 
Department of Parks and Recreation, who said he hopes the county's position is 
just a "trial balloon." 
</P>
<P>
"It's very clear we do not intend to negotiate this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the trade angrily accuse the county of threatening to scuttle the 
deal with an artificially high estimate of Tapia's worth. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe the appraisal," said Linda Palmer, president of the Santa 
Monica Mountains Trails Council. "I'm completely shocked. I'm hoping someone 
will do another appraisal and show it's false." 
</P>
<P>
The Placerita Canyon Nature Center is a rugged outpost that is home to bobcats, 
deer and gray fox just 2 1/2 miles from suburbia. The floor of the 
chaparral-covered canyon is dotted with oaks and sycamores. The park is heavily 
used by hikers and school groups for interpretive programs. 
</P>
<P>
Tapia is a favorite of picnickers who can spread their blankets under the 
canopies of oaks. A stream meanders through the hilly park, which serves as a 
link to trails in the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
The private appraiser assessed the parks based on their "best and highest use," 
said Curt Robertson, head of marketing at the county parks department. That 
means the appraiser determined what each property would be worth if it were 
sold for the development of housing tracts, he said. The Tapia property, near 
affluent homes in Calabasas and Monte Nido, would fetch a higher price than the 
Placerita Canyon acreage in the Santa Clarita Valley, where prices are lower, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowner activists say the Tapia appraisal is meaningless because homes would 
never be constructed on park property. They maintain that Tapia should be 
appraised solely as parkland, which would greatly reduce its value on paper. 
</P>
<P>
Ulm, who said he has not yet received copies of the appraisals, agreed that the 
criteria used to appraise Tapia were skewed. 
</P>
<P>
The county did not instruct the appraiser on what formula to use to conduct the 
assessments, Robertson said. Using the "highest and best use" test is a routine 
appraisal method, he said. Reacting to the criticism, Robertson said the 
appraisals could be redone. 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing irreversible if there is another basis for appraising them," 
Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Brown, president of the Las Virgenes Homeowners Federation, called the 
appraisal "way out of line" after comparing it to prices paid by the Santa 
Monica Mountains Conservancy for parkland near Tapia in recent years. None of 
the land acquisitions even approached the $78,000-an-acre value placed upon 
Tapia, which is in a flood plain and next to a sewer plant, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph T. Edmiston, executive director of the Santa Monica Mountains 
Conservancy, said park agencies would be hard-pressed to buy land in the future 
if the Tapia appraisal is an accurate reflection of land prices in the area. 
</P>
<P>
If the appraisal is correct, Edmiston said, "then we're in big trouble in the 
mountains. We're in real trouble." 
</P>
<P>
County officials have sought to assure backers of the swap that the deal 
shouldn't be jeopardized by the county's stance. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever it is we end up negotiating with the state on, it is not designed to 
impede the progress of the swap," said Okimoto, who predicted the state 
probably would be flexible during talks. 
</P>
<P>
"Our sole purpose is not to see how much we can get, it's what is the best 
possible scenario for everybody involved, including the homeowners who would 
like the swap and the state and the county," said Peter Whittingham, a deputy 
for Supervisor Mike Antonovich. 
</P>
<P>
But homeowners remain disturbed at the prospect of the county keeping Tapia. 
They charge that the park is treated like an unwanted stepchild, where the 
roads are pitted with potholes, the bathrooms are chained shut and broken 
drinking fountains are not fixed. There are no full-time employees at the park, 
which residents say has attracted drug dealers and people who sleep overnight 
in their cars. 
</P>
<P>
"If they are not going to take care of it and they don't want the expense of 
taking care of it, then get rid of it," urged Shirley Duryee, a board member of 
the Monte Nido Valley Property Owners Assn.

AFTER CROSS-BURNING; 
</P>
<P>
CHILDREN'S NAZI SYMBOLS STIR UP NEWHALL RESIDENTS

<P>
Next time, they'll play cowboys and Indians. 
</P>
<P>
That was the pledge Saturday from two Santa Clarita boys who briefly set off 
neighborhood alarm by leaving a Nazi flag and a painted swastika on a soccer 
field after playing a dirt-clod war game. 
</P>
<P>
The soccer field is a block from where a cross was burned Thursday on the front 
lawn of a black family's home. 
</P>
<P>
The swastika and the handmade Nazi flag were discovered at dusk Friday by a 
12-year-old boy who turned the flag over to leaders of the 271-family Hidden 
Valley Homeowners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Sensitive neighborhood leaders -- who a day earlier offered a $1,000 reward for 
information leading to the arrest and conviction of the cross-burner -- quickly 
called Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators learned Saturday morning that the Nazi symbols were left over 
from children playing army, not older people's racial intolerance. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a 13-year-old boy playing war games with a 12-year-old friend," said 
Deputy Dan Cox, a Sheriff's Department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"They had built forts and decided who would be the American and who would be 
the German armies. The 13-year-old painted the swastika on the soccer field 
grass and made the flag for his fort to mark his territory prior to a dirt-clod 
war game at noon on Friday." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Friend Sees Fort 
</P>
<P>
Later, the 13-year-old showed another friend the fort. 
</P>
<P>
But when the third boy became angry over the swastika, the 13-year-old got 
scared and didn't tell his friend that he'd made the flag, Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives are convinced that there were no underlying motives for the flag or 
swastika ,and the 13-year-old does not face any charges, Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Lt. Harvey Cantor said the swastika was apparently painted on the 
grass last Sunday and remained unnoticed for five days. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids are scared stiff," said Cantor, who would not reveal their 
identities. "Their parents are very upset." 
</P>
<P>
So were others in the Hidden Valley neighborhood, where the cross-burning at 
the home of Derrick Quals, 31, remained unsolved Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"Swastikas are sick. This is gross," said Mike Stewart, 12, as he examined the 
soccer field where freshly spread bark chips covered the white spray-painted 
Nazi symbol. 
</P>
<P>
"Look what the Nazis did to the Jewish people. I don't care if they were 
playing. I used to play army, but I'd never do anything like this." 
</P>
<P>
The cross-burning was wrong too, said friend Bryan Smith, 12. "It was dumb. 
There's no excuse for burning crosses. It's stupid." 
</P>

2-HOUR WAIT TO SAY GOODBY TO OLD PAINT; 
</P>
<P>
TOXIC ROUNDUP BRANDED A SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
San Fernando Valley residents gathered in a 1 1/2-mile-long line Saturday to 
turn in old bug spray, leftover paint and unwanted crankcase oil in Los 
Angeles' first roundup of hazardous household wastes. 
</P>
<P>
About 2,300 carloads of toxic materials -- more than twice the amount expected 
-- were collected during six hours in a parking lot behind the city's West 
Valley Regional Library in Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
"This is phenomenal, incredible, every adjective you can think of," said Edward 
J. Avila, president of the city's Board of Public Works, as tons of unwanted 
cans, jugs and bottles piled up. 
</P>
<P>
"People are willing to wait an hour-and-a-half in line rather than dump this 
material in the trash." 
</P>
<P>
Some residents waited even longer, but there were few complaints when they 
finally reached the head of the line and their wastes were separated into three 
huge piles -- oils, paints and a mixture of cleaners, poisons and other 
assorted chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
Although it was the first roundup by the city of Los Angeles, Los Angeles 
County sponsored a similar program last summer at the Calabasas Landfill in 
Agoura. 
</P>
<P>
"I waited in line for two hours, but I'd do it again if I had to," said 
Woodland Hills resident Elsie Demas, who turned in a small carton that 
contained bottles of old nail polish. 
</P>
<P>
Glen Schafer, who filled his car trunk with old paint cans and pesticide 
bottles, said he also felt it was worth the wait to get rid of a 20-year 
collection of chemicals from the garage of his Reseda home. 
</P>
<P>
Tarzana residents James Weddle and Gary Johns delivered three large drums of 
old gasoline, waste paint and solvents for their 75-year-old next-door 
neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
"The green barrel, the one with the solvents, was there when he moved in 35 
years ago. He never knew what to do with it," Weddle said. 
</P>
<P>
Two private firms will recycle the 3,500 gallons of crankcase oil and the 
uncounted thousands of cans of old paint turned in Saturday, said Reva 
Fabrikant, an environmental engineer for the city's Bureau of Sanitation. The 
paint will probably be bought back at a discount by the city and used to cover 
graffiti, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The city will recycle old batteries turned in Saturday and keep the profit, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cost of Success 
</P>
<P>
But the unexpected volume of material collected will probably cause the 
budgeted $66,000 cost of Saturday's toxic waste roundup to double, Fabrikant 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The turnout is likely to cause the City Council to consider creation of a 
permanent collection program, said Anthony W. Harris, a spokesman for the city 
Department of Public Works. He said seven other regional roundups are scheduled 
for this year, including one Aug. 19 in Granada Hills and another Nov. 18 in 
Sun Valley. 
</P>
<P>
This year's toxic collections were proposed by West Valley City Councilwoman 
Joy Picus, who won a $700,000 commitment from the city's environmental trust 
fund for the eight collection days around the city. 
</P>
<P>
"It's evident that there's an increased awareness of the need to recycle," said 
Myrlie Evers, a commissioner on the city's Board of Public Works. "This turnout 
sends a clear message to City Hall that people are concerned enough to wait in 
a long line if they have to safely dispose of these materials." 
</P>
<P>
All of the people who were in line by the scheduled end of the roundup at 3 
p.m. were allowed to turn in their toxic wastes. "One lady was crying when I 
told her it was too late. So I let her in. I couldn't turn her away," said Leon 
Ainer, a city truck operator who helped direct traffic at the collection site. 
</P>
<P>
The toxic roundup required city officials to close the library parking lot, 
although the library remained open -- and busy. Branch librarian Iris Speed, 
who turned in several boxes of her own old paint cans, said her staff 
anticipated the parking lot closure and did not require any books to be 
returned by borrowers Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
About 70 city workers and volunteers and 50 professional waste handlers worked 
without breaks during the six-hour collection to keep the line of cars moving 
through the parking lot drop-off point. 
</P>
<P>
"These are unselfish people," volunteer Lil Younger, former West Hills 
Community Organization president, said of those in line. "They care about our 
environment and our future generations."

2 ARRESTED, 2 SOUGHT IN JEWELRY STORE ROBBERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police were seeking two men Saturday who remained at large after their 
suspected accomplices in the armed robbery of a Lancaster jewelry store were 
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Frank, 28, and Richard Brown, 25, both of Los Angeles, were arrested 
Friday on suspicion of robbing at gunpoint a jewelry store in the 43700 block 
of N. 15th St. West in Lancaster, said Deputy Dan Cox of the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said four men held up the store Friday, Cox said. After taking an 
undetermined amount of jewelry, the robbers fled in two vehicles -- a white car 
and a black van, Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the robbery, officers from the California Highway Patrol spotted 
the black van heading south on the Antelope Freeway near Sand Canyon Road and 
began pursuing it, Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
The van, traveling at speeds of up to 100 m.p.h., eventually rear-ended a car 
and plowed into a guardrail on the eastbound Ventura Freeway near Van Nuys 
Boulevard, Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
Two men jumped from the van and ran onto surface streets in Sherman Oaks, Cox 
said. Police cordoned off the area and used helicopter and canine teams to find 
the men. 
</P>
<P>
Frank and Brown were being held at the Antelope Valley station in lieu of 
$50,000 bail each, Cox said.

JAZZ BAND MARKS 25 YEARS UNDER SAME DEMONSTRATIVE DIRECTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU FULTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stan Seckler paces in front of the saxophone section, a musical score in one 
hand and a pen in the other. The Pico Rivera Stage-Jazz Band is pounding out an 
arrangement of "In the Mood" and the driving sound slams against the rehearsal 
hall's walls. 
</P>
<P>
Seckler directs the band with body language. Bobbing his head to the beat, he 
suddenly drops to the floor in a crouch in an attempt to get the saxophones to 
play softer. Then he is back on his feet, lips pursed, as he matches each 
trumpet blast with a punch of his closed fist. 
</P>
<P>
An exasperated look crosses his face, and the fist changes to a flattened palm 
that slices the air as he whistles for the band to stop. "I don't hear any 
dynamic!" Seckler shouts, a trace of his native New York in his voice. "I don't 
hear the second measure building." 
</P>
<P>
Seckler, director of the city-sponsored band, has spent countless Sunday 
afternoons rehearsing in the activity room at Rivera Park. This year marks the 
25th anniversary of the 18-piece group, which Seckler founded when Pico Rivera 
officials were looking for entertainment at city-sponsored events. 
</P>
<P>
"Originally, the city was looking for more of a concert band," Seckler said. 
"But I said, 'Why not a jazz band?' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Professional Springboard 
</P>
<P>
Since 1964, the volunteer band has been a professional springboard for several 
of the more than 100 musicians who have played in the group. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had guys go on to play with Woody Herman, Buddy Rich, big bands like 
that," said Seckler, who teaches saxophone, clarinet and flute in Whittier and 
who used to play sax for the Charlie Barnett Band. The Pico Rivera band is also 
an outlet for retired musicians such as John Harris, who gave up playing 
saxophone professionally for a 9-to-5 job. 
</P>
<P>
"Music is in my blood," said Harris, a Pico Rivera resident who has played in 
the band about 12 years. "This is my creative outlet." 
</P>
<P>
The band's brassy sounds occasionally attract youngsters in the park who lean 
against the door frame to listen. The powerful sounds of five saxophones, four 
trumpets and three trombones reverberate through the cement-floored room where 
the musicians are perched on folding chairs. 
</P>
<P>
Seckler estimates that about 60% of the band's members are working musicians 
and the rest have other jobs. About a third of the members live in Pico Rivera; 
most of the others live in the Southeast area. Seckler recruits band members 
from among his students and at local high schools and colleges. The musicians 
range in age from 17 to the mid-30s. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not looking for the superstars," Seckler said. "I'm looking for a kid who 
loves music, who wants the experience and who wants to learn." 
</P>
<P>
The band performs for city gatherings such as those held on the Fourth of July 
and Cinco de Mayo, and also competes in local jazz festivals. In exchange, the 
city pays Seckler $2,100 a year as director and provides rehearsal space at the 
park. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 29, the band is scheduled to record several Big Band arrangements at 
Rio Hondo College for broadcast on Los Angeles jazz radio station KKGO-FM. The 
session will be taped for Channel 53, United Cable Television's community 
access channel in Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Seckler proudly recalled the band's early years when it won 
six first-place trophies at the annual Hollywood Bowl Battle of the Bands. But 
when passage of Proposition 13 eliminated funding for the Battle of the Bands 
and other school music programs, Seckler noticed a drop in the number of young 
musicians interested in joining the Pico Rivera band. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not Like It Used to Be' 
</P>
<P>
"We still get a few kids who come to the rehearsals and listen, but it's not 
like it used to be," Seckler said. "The whole idea is to have the kids hear us 
and say, 'Hey, maybe someday I can be part of that band.' " 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Seckler contentedly works with his current crop of musicians, 
leaving messages on their answering machines to remind them of performances and 
pushing them to "Work! Work!" at rehearsals. 
</P>
<P>
"I get ticked off and yell and scream at them, but when the rehearsal is over, 
everything is fine," said Seckler, whose briefcase features a picture of a 
pointing Uncle Sam with the message "I Want You to Practice."

VENICE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS MATCH WITS ON WORDS AT VOCABULARY BEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kenneth Curry was first out, stumped by combustible. 
</P>
<P>
The 10th-grader was one of nine students competing last week in a vocabulary 
bee at Venice High School. Held in the cafeteria, the war of words had the 
structure of an old-fashioned spelling bee. Each student was asked to define 
one of a list of words, many of which had been part of the school's 
word-of-the-day program. Students who failed were eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth's discomfort was obvious as he groped unsuccessfully for another way to 
say combustible. Afterward, he confessed that he hadn't studied his word list 
the night before. "We all forgot it was today," he said of the contest. 
</P>
<P>
Fellow contestant Adam Bray-Ali was done in by tortuous. "Something that 
tortures you?" the 10th-grader guessed. Bena Jaffe, a former teacher who served 
as quiz master, said she was sorry but that was wrong. The word was offered to 
Bryn Mowry, also a 10th-grader, who decided to take it. "Winding and twisting," 
she answered correctly. 
</P>
<P>
Every school day, a vocabulary word is posted at Venice High. In recent months, 
the words have included such stumpers as exoteric ("suitable to be imparted to 
the public") and opsimath ("a person who begins to learn late in life"). 
Youngsters who demonstrate that they can use the daily word in a sentence win 
candy bars and other treats. 
</P>
<P>
According to teacher Beverly Broger, who helps choose the word of the day, it 
is a painless way to help students build their vocabularies, if only to help 
them when they take the Scholastic Aptitude Test. "We'll do anything we can to 
get them to read more and learn vocabulary words," Broger said. 
</P>
<P>
Last week's bee pitted the school's most faithful daily-word participants 
against the dictionary. A stereo, not a Snickers bar, was at stake. The stereo 
and several smaller prizes had been bought with an $800 grant from the Los 
Angeles Educational Partnership's Small Grants for Teachers program, won by 
Broger and her colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Tenth-grader Susanna Wu was confronted with theocracy. "Is it something 
involving the theater?" she asked, frowning. Wu sat down, abashed by her 
failure to remember that a theocracy is a government ruled by a god. 
</P>
<P>
When only three players remained, Jaffe began giving them words they hadn't had 
a chance to study. Ninth-grader Sukaina Merchant stumbled on incredible. "It's 
so embarrassing," she said. Bryn, next up, asked: "Can I have that word?" Jaffe 
nodded yes. "It's something that's beyond belief," Bryn said. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, it was just Bryn and 11th-grader Troy Gilchrist. Troy almost tripped 
on the word sacrifice but saved himself by using it correctly in a sentence. 
Bryn defined accelerate, "to move faster and gain speed." 
</P>
<P>
Troy was given the word encumbrance. It proved indeed to be "a burden or 
impediment"; he failed to come up with that definition. Now only one correct 
answer stood between Bryn and the prize. Offered encumbrance, she exercised her 
option to define another word instead. She triumphed with obnoxious. 
</P>
<P>
 After the bee, the players and the students in the audience ate frozen yogurt 
donated by a Venice merchant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Harder in Front of People' 
</P>
<P>
Player Robert Farag noted that coming up with definitions "is much harder to do 
in front of people, when you know your friends and your teachers are looking at 
you." 
</P>
<P>
A 10th-grader, Farag had aced calumniate, with the definition "to say a false 
statement," only to be undone by contemporary. 
</P>
<P>
Winner Bryn, 14, said she was going to give the stereo to her mother. "I have a 
little ghetto blaster of my own," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Bryn said she is not a big reader, but she does think a rich repertoire of 
words is useful. "Sometimes it's hard to express your thoughts if you don't 
know a certain word."

As Phila McDaniel walked breathlessly from her classroom to the art gallery at 
Gardena High School the other day, she was, as usual, preparing for a trip. 
</P>
<P>
A crumpled note pinned to her gray-and-black-striped vest reminded her of 
things to do, headed by the admonition: "Don't forget briefcase." With her 
overloaded schedule, it's easy to see the need for reminders. 
</P>
<P>
McDaniel, 57, is an art instructor, intrepid world traveler, tour leader, 
artist, photographer, art gallery curator, art restorer. She is seeking air 
time for a television documentary she directed on her travels in China. She has 
amassed a highly regarded collection of costumes worn by some of China's ethnic 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Finalist for Award 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, McDaniel also finds time to study for her doctorate and continue work 
on two books she is writing. And for the second consecutive year, McDaniel is 
one of 10 finalists for the annual Bravo Awards for excellence in teaching the 
arts. 
</P>
<P>
Like the eye of a storm, the mild-mannered McDaniel remains unfazed amid the 
flurried pace of her life. "I love the drama and the adventure," McDaniel said. 
"I love art, and I just like to go places and to see what I can find out from 
many different standpoints." 
</P>
<P>
An art teacher for 33 years, McDaniel has taught at Gardena High since 1972. 
She is curator of the school's extensive collection of California art, which 
consists of 78 paintings donated to the school since 1919 by Gardena High 
alumni. 
</P>
<P>
For the last 28 years she has combined teaching with traveling. She instructs 
Gardena students in painting and art history during the school year and, for 
the last 10 summers, has led tours into remote sections of China. Before China 
opened its doors to Western tourists in 1979, she traveled extensively in 
Japan, Greece, India and Nepal. Since then, she has been to China 17 times. 
</P>
<P>
Wherever McDaniel goes, interesting things seem to happen. 
</P>
<P>
"I got into a little altercation with a Tibetan warrior last summer, and I'm 
still suffering from the damage he did to my arm," the scholarly looking 
McDaniel said. The warrior was of the fierce Khampa tribe, she said. 
</P>
<P>
As she recalls it, the fracas began when a Tibetan tour guide recommended that 
participants refrain from buying the warrior's goods in the Xigatse Bazaar, an 
outdoor folk market near Mt. Everest, because the items were too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
"The warrior got angry, and he tried to carry our guide away," McDaniel said. 
"Then I tried to rescue the guide. That's when I got hit by the warrior. He 
tore the tendons in my arm and separated the muscle, so my arm is very weak 
now." 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, McDaniel was preparing for a presumably safer trip to the Wing 
Luke Asian Museum in Seattle, where a major exhibition of her collection of 
ethnic costumes and jewelry, along with her photographs of the Chinese 
residents who made them, is opening. 
</P>
<P>
Museum Director Kit Freudenberg said McDaniel's collection is remarkable 
because of the completeness of the costumes. Few travelers to China see such 
costumes, she said, and it is possible that the Chinese will stop making 
traditional outfits as the country becomes more Westernized. 
</P>
<P>
McDaniel is a member of the China Exploration and Research Society, founded by 
a National Geographic Society researcher last year and dedicated to preserving 
the history and culture of China. 
</P>
<P>
Her research specialty is documenting the customs of China's 55 ethnic minority 
groups. So far, she has collected material from 40 of the groups, including 
members of the Miao, Dong, Tibetan and Manchurian minorities. Like the 
costumes, ethnic customs may be about to vanish. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'An Urgent Thing' 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to document things before they disappear," McDaniel said. "It's 
an urgent thing, because once these people get Western civilization, once they 
get television, once they know what's out there in the rest of the world, 
they're going to change. . . . So we have to document things now while they 
still exist in their pure state." 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, McDaniel traced the path of Mao Tse-tung's Long March across China in 
1934, traveling 900 miles by bus along the dusty roads crossing the Aba 
grasslands. The seven-day feat was celebrated by the governors of the Sichuan 
and Ganshu provinces, each of whom greeted her tour group with banquets and 
ceremonial white scarfs called khagatas that were draped around their necks. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how she does it," Freudenberg said. "She was one of the first 
people back in after China opened up, and she is frequently one of the first 
Westerners to go into many regions. She has made friends and acquaintances of 
governors and business managers. Many times her bus goes where there isn't even 
a road." 
</P>
<P>
Traveling where there was no road and no good gasoline once presented a problem 
when a tour bus broke down in the Yunan grasslands "hundreds of miles from 
civilization," McDaniel said. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a bottle of alcohol in my suitcase and I poured it in the carburetor," 
McDaniel said. "We limped along until we found some Tibetans who had a wrench 
so we could take off the gas tank and clean it. Then I strained the gasoline 
through my T-shirt so we could get the water and dirt out. It was because I 
knew a little bit about chemistry and mechanics that I knew what to do." 
</P>
<P>
McDaniel picked up some of her knowledge of chemistry from her husband, Calvin, 
a retired Harbor College chemistry professor who is also a tour director, and 
from her father, a mechanic and inventor. 
</P>
<P>
The couple, who live in Rancho Palos Verdes, have three adult children, all of 
whom have traveled to China with their mother. Calvin McDaniel, however, said 
he has never been to China. He specializes in tours to the Philippines, Taiwan, 
Malaysia, India and Burma. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles native and an only child, McDaniel said her love of travel and 
teaching came in great part from her mother, an elementary school teacher who 
bought her daughter lavish art and travel books. As an undergraduate, McDaniel 
studied fine arts at Pepperdine University before receiving a master's degree 
in Oriental art history from Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
McDaniel is one of 97 people nominated this year for the seventh annual Bravo 
awards. Two winners will be announced on March 6 at a ceremony at the Los 
Angeles County Music Center's Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, she said. The awards, 
coordinated by the Music Center's education division and sponsored by the 
Jeffrey Melamed Memorial Fund, are given to teachers in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
Helene Trudeau, program administrator of the education division, said McDaniel 
is remarkable as a teacher because of her success in inspiring Gardena students 
in arts careers while doubling as curator of the school's art collection. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A World of Knowledge' 
</P>
<P>
Gardena High Principal Tamotsu Ikeda agrees. "Because of her travels, she 
brings to our kids a world of knowledge which other art teachers would find 
difficult to give to youngsters." 
</P>
<P>
On her return from Seattle, McDaniel's whirlwind schedule will continue. Her 
current exhibit at the high school's art gallery is in celebration of the 
Chinese New Year, which begins Feb. 6. She is organizing a mural to be painted 
by beginning art students in honor of Black History Month, also in February. 
</P>
<P>
Some of McDaniel's former students have returned to exhibit their work in the 
school's gallery. 
</P>
<P>
"My greatest thrill," McDaniel said, "has been to see some of the result of my 
philosophy of teaching . . . to let children know the joy of creating art."

BIG EAST NOTES; 
</P>
<P>
THOMPSON PASSES ON PROP. 48 PLAYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANDY KEENAN, Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you think John Thompson is denouncing Proposition 42 to save his program at 
Georgetown, forget it. The Hoyas have never had a Prop 48 player, which makes 
Thompson's actions all the more powerful. 
</P>
<P>
The Big East voted against Proposition 42 nine to one. (Each member school gets 
one vote and Big East Commissioner Dave Gavitt also casts one vote.) 
</P>
<P>
Only Villanova favored disallowing scholarships to freshmen who fail to qualify 
under Proposition 42 standards. Like Georgetown, Boston College and Villanova 
never have signed a Prop 48 recruit. 
</P>
<P>
"We reviewed the issue thoroughly and we felt (Prop 42) put some teeth into the 
legislation regulating athletic scholarships," Villanova Athletic Director Ted 
Aceto said. "We respect John Thompson, but contrary to what John has been 
saying, racism had nothing to do with our position." 
</P>
<P>
Of the 12 Prop 48 basketball players in the Big East since the rule was 
instituted three seasons ago, 11 are black. The lone white Prop 48 player is 
Connecticut sophomore Marc Suhr, of Cologne, West Germany. UConn appealed 
Suhr's case to the NCAA, saying that he should have been able to take an 
untimed SAT test because of the language barrier. The appeal was denied. 
</P>
<P>
No one is certain how long Thompson's boycott will continue, but his absence is 
felt. "We miss him on the bench, him yelling at us," guard Dwayne Bryant said. 
"It means a lot to us to hear his voice." 
</P>
<P>
Three Bronx cheers for balanced scheduling. Seton Hall and Providence -- the 
top two teams in the conference right now -- don't meet at all until Feb. 25 
and then must play again March 1. 
</P>
<P>
Pitt junior Rod Brookin credits his mother Ethel, of Steelton, Pa., for his 
return to his glorious freshman form of spinning drives and sweet jumpers. 
"She's my biggest fan and my toughest critic," said Brookin, after scoring a 
career-high 24 points with eight rebounds and four steals Sunday in the 
Panthers' upset of then-No. 3 Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
Brookin called his mother often during his early-season struggles. "She'd say, 
'Rod, what's wrong with you? You don't do those things on the playground when 
you're home.' Sometimes she even hung up on me. But I don't think she'll hang 
up (now). She might even send me some money after this game," Brookin said. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Paul Evans said he regrets humiliating Brookin about taking too many 
trips to Burger King when Brookin reported to fall practice at 270 pounds. 
"It's not like he wants to be fat," Evans said. "It's an hereditary problem." 
</P>
<P>
Now down to 235, Brookin feels terrific. "Before, it'd get so bad on the court 
my eyes would roll back in my head." On days off, Brookin alone must report to 
the gym to run sprints. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Boeheim seems baffled by his team's 1-4 Big East virus. Here's a remedy: Go 
out and find some not-so-talented players such as Final Four participants 
Howard Triche and Greg Monroe to complement his selfish wonders-that-be. In its 
loss to Connecticut Monday, Syracuse had but five assists -- all from Sherman 
Douglas -- who probably shouldn't have played at all because of his sore lower 
back. Even a healthy point guard shouldn't be the only distributor on a team. 
</P>
<P>
The present Orange attitude reads: Why give the ball up when you can keep it 
for yourself? So pass it on. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas needs just 24 assists in Syracuse's remaining 11 Big East games to 
break Mark Jackson's career record of 342 in league play. 
</P>
<P>
But he'll have to stay healthy to eclipse the all-time NCAA record of 894 
career assists set by Northeastern's Andre Lafleur in 1987. With at least 15 
games left in the season, Douglas needs to average 7.4 a game to do it. 
Overall, he's averaging 8.3 assists, but in league play, he's down to 5.8 feeds 
a game after recording no assists against St. John's and five against UConn. 
</P>
<P>
The league's "Freshman of the Week" honor has been renamed "Rookie of the Week" 
to accommodate torrid performances from Prop 48 sophomores such as Brian 
Shorter's 37 points against Oklahoma. Junior college transfers need not apply. 
</P>
<P>
Villanova reserve forward Barry Bekkedam, a 6-10 junior forward, is out for the 
season with a torn ligament in his right knee suffered while swimming in an 
Orlando, Fla., hotel pool the day before the team went to Disney World. The 
fragile Bekkedam has a career average of three points. 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse's team foul shooting has dropped from 75 percent in 1983-84 to 58 
percent this season. At this rate of decline, the Orangemen will miss every 
free throw in the year 2009.

TEXAS IS IN LOVE WITH TOM PENDERS' RUN-AND-FUN STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANNY ROBBINS, Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
AUSTIN, Texas 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tom Penders entered the reception hall in the Erwin Center, the University of 
Texas' plush, 16,000-seat arena, to applause, and threaded his way between 
tables to the microphone at one side of the room. Munching popcorn and sipping 
mixed drinks in the hall, known unofficially as the Burnt Orange Room, were 
several hundred Texas fans, the most orange-blooded of the 12,647 who had just 
witnessed the Longhorns' game with Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
Penders, Texas' first-year coach, answered questions about the game and then 
told the gathering: "It's important to do this even when we lose." More 
applause. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Texas had, only an hour earlier, lost an important Southwest Conference 
basketball game to Arkansas. But if someone had wandered into the Burnt Orange 
Room without seeing the game, he easily could have gotten a different 
impression. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no unrealistic expectations here," Penders said later. "People are 
telling me after the game, 'Please hang in there, coach. We're just happy to 
have you here.' They're cheering up." 
</P>
<P>
Talk about appreciative people, a man, fortyish, standing behind Penders in 
line at an Austin grocery store plunked down a $100 bill and offered to pay for 
Penders' groceries -- and this was six months before Penders would even coach a 
game. Penders, taken aback, declined the man's offer and later asked Steve 
Ross, UT's basketball publicist, "Hey, what exactly happened here?" 
</P>
<P>
If Penders, the former Columbia and Fordham coach, is enjoying a nice, cozy 
honeymoon in Austin, it's because Texas fans and Texas basketball are just now 
reconciling after a long separation. 
</P>
<P>
For sure, Penders, hired by Texas after two 20-win seasons at Rhode Island, has 
given UT fans plenty to shout about in a 12-3 season. But more important than 
the record is the way Penders' upbeat personality and up-tempo game have 
revitalized a program that had languished under Bob Weltlich, the Bob Knight 
protege who replaced the popular Abe Lemons in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"No one is asking Tom for a national championship," said John Danks, a former 
UT player and coach under Lemons who is now a lobbyist in Austin. "We're just 
excited to have a competitive team and happy players. Regardless of what 
happens this year, we know we have a chance to go somewhere in the future. 
Under Weltlich, we didn't have that chance." 
</P>
<P>
Ready, willing and able to play Penders' up-tempo style, the Longhorns have 
scored more than 100 points six times and savored every minute of it. "Perfect 
choice," said junior guard Travis Mays, whose nine three-pointers against Rice 
last week set an SWC record. 
</P>
<P>
Under Lemons in the late '70s, Texas made a move as a basketball school. NIT 
champions in 1978, the Longhorns appeared destined for greater things in '82 
when they got off to a 14-0 start. But that team lost 11 of its final 13 games 
when one of its stars, forward Mike Wacker, suffered a severe knee injury. 
Athletic Director DeLoss Dodds fired Lemons when the season was finished. 
</P>
<P>
The situation only got messier when Weltlich, who had dragged the Mississippi 
program into the 20th century, failed to produce at Texas. Weltlich was a 
Knight foot soldier, all right, but without the championship banners, and his 
six seasons were marked by community apathy and player unrest. 
</P>
<P>
Recalling Weltlich's practices, which were closed to the media and public, Mays 
said: "He'd have us diving on the floor. He was breaking our bodies down. At 
this point in the season under Coach Weltlich, we would be tired. Coach Penders 
understands. We'll play hard, win a game, he'll give us a day off. But Coach 
Weltlich would have us in here the next day going just as hard. We were all 
banged up. My freshman year, I was hampered with injuries. My sophomore year, 
injury after injury after injury. It was the abuse, the physical abuse, we were 
going through." 
</P>
<P>
After last season, in which the Longhorns were 16-13 and first-round losers in 
the SWC tournament, Dodds called the players in to discuss Weltlich. The 
players told Dodds they were tired of Weltlich's walk-it-up style and constant 
negativism. The meeting pushed Weltlich over the edge. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, in the East, Penders' Rhode Island team was pushing the ball up-court 
and beating Missouri and Syracuse on the way to the NCAA Tournament's Sweet 16. 
Dodds noticed, and he sought Penders out for an interview at the Final Four in 
Kansas City. Dodds says he needed only "about 15 minutes of one interview" to 
know he had his man. Penders had been talking to Rutgers about the coaching 
vacancy there, but when he heard what the Texas job paid -- a total package of 
$200,000 a year -- he jumped on it. (Only four seasons ago Penders was earning 
about $40,000 a year and paying for his parking space at Fordham.) 
</P>
<P>
Texas had an antidote for Weltlich, and, after 17 years of toiling in musty, 
bandbox gyms, Penders had found basketball heaven, a school with first-class 
facilities and deep pockets. "Everything is there," he said. "It's the first 
situation -- well, I've been in such lousy situations. My total recruiting 
budget at Fordham was about one-tenth the size of what we have here." 
</P>
<P>
Penders certainly walked into a nice situation. He inherited a full complement 
of players, four of them returning starters, good people -- "Nobody's come up 
to my office and asked for his monthly payment" -- as well as good athletes. 
</P>
<P>
But he must create a recruiting presence for the Longhorns, who, in Danks' 
words, "haven't out-recruited anybody for anybody in the last 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
To Texas' facilities and resources, Penders has added his run-and-fun style and 
the ultimate weapon, national television exposure. Cashing in a chip from his 
Rhode Island success, he hustled up a network TV game (CBS) for Texas at 
Vanderbilt Saturday. The Longhorns' non-conference schedule next season will be 
tougher -- including games with LSU, Oklahoma, Florida and Cal-Santa Barbara -- 
bringing more TV opportunities and, Penders hopes, opening more recruiting 
doors. 
</P>
<P>
Penders wants to tie up the high school talent in Texas, much of which now 
leaves the SWC, while bagging a big-time national recruit or two. Texas thought 
it might get one last fall in Jamal Faulkner, the 6-7 forward from Christ the 
King High School in New York. Faulkner visited Texas but ended up signing with 
Pitt. Said Penders: "I think if we had a year under our belt here, we would 
have had him." 
</P>
<P>
In the Burnt Orange Room these days, they would not disagree.

NBA NOTES;

<P>
IT'S GETTING MIGHTY CROWDED IN THE WEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY SULLIVAN, Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Listen closely, folks. That distant murmuring you hear is coming from the West, 
and it's the sound of nervous fans, coaches and general managers coming to the 
realization that they're fighting for their playoff existence. 
</P>
<P>
Forget about the Los Angeles Lakers for a moment, and look at the gridlock 
that's forming in back of them in the Western Conference standings, which are 
starting to resemble midtown Manhattan at 4 o'clock on a Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Going into Thursday night's games, the eight teams behind the Lakers were 
separated by just three games in the loss column. And three of the league's 
supposed premier teams -- Dallas, Denver and Portland -- are perilously close 
to falling into ninth place. 
</P>
<P>
"Before the season, I told our coaches this would be the strangest season of 
all," Lakers General Manager Jerry West said. 
</P>
<P>
West said he suspected some of his team's chief rivals might slip this season. 
When teams reach a certain level, say 50 wins, expectations naturally become 
heightened. But achieving them is another thing. "Frankly," West said, "they 
haven't done it to this point." 
</P>
<P>
West didn't name teams, but he was clearly referring to the Mavericks, Nuggets 
and Blazers, three clubs that have, for a variety of reasons, been performing 
below the standards they established a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Denver won 54 games last season, Dallas and Portland 53 apiece. All three were 
perceived as a threat to the Lakers this year. With the Lakers slipping, 
they're slipping too, and they don't seem any more capable of beating Los 
Angeles now than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the only teams that have made significant strides in the West are 
Phoenix and Golden State, two lottery teams that have made stunning 
turn-arounds after hiring veteran coaches -- Cotton Fitzsimmons in Phoenix and 
Don Nelson for Golden State. 
</P>
<P>
Golden State's resurgence has been particularly remarkable, considering they've 
done it largely without Ralph Sampson and with a lineup that includes four 
guards (if you count Chris Mullin) and 6-8 Larry Smith at center. 
</P>
<P>
"I love playing for (Nelson)," Mullin said. "He's the best coach I've had by 
far. He doesn't get caught up in positions. He expects you to be a basketball 
player. I can't remember when I've had this much fun playing basketball." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson has his team thinking playoffs. No doubt, certain of his coaching rivals 
can't remember being this concerned about missing them altogether. 
</P>
<P>
Rik Smits, Indiana's 7-4 rookie center, has averaged 15.2 points on 57.4 
percent shooting in six games since Dick Versace took over as the Pacers' head 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
Smits hasn't made a very profound impression on certain NBA veterans, however. 
After watching Smits score 21 points in 20 minutes last week against Boston, 
Kevin McHale referred to him as "Rich Smiths," and Danny Ainge simply dismissed 
him as "Whatshisname." 
</P>
<P>
But the league's general managers apparently have been taking notice of the 
Dunking Dutchman's development. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you what," said Indiana General Manager Donnie Walsh, "everyone is 
talking to me about him now. I'm so happy I took him (with the second pick in 
the draft). The other night at Miami, he made a dunk you wouldn't believe. He 
was like a whooping crane or something." 
</P>
<P>
Notes 
</P>
<P>
Larry Bird says he probably won't compete in the Long Distance Shootout at the 
All-Star Game Feb. 12 in Houston. Bird, the three-time defending champ in the 
event, says it wouldn't be fair to his Celtics teammates for him to win the 
$12,500 first prize, then return to the disabled list for another month. ... 
Bird on the Pacers: "Every year I look at them and think they're going to be 
dangerous. Then for some reason, they're not. I guess they're just one Larry 
Bird short." Just like the Celts, eh? ... Seattle's Jerry Reynolds, after an 
uninspiring effort by the Sonics: "Things could be worse. I could be married to 
Robin Givens." ... Golden State is offering a seven-game ticket package called 
the 'Nute Plan in honor of 7-7 backup center Manute Bol. Bol, by the way, still 
owes a few cows to his father-in-law in Sudan, in accordance with his nuptial 
agreement. "If you don't have money or cows, it's hard to get married," said 
Bol, who was married a year ago. "I paid 80 cows. I only pay 32 so far, so when 
I go back home, I pay the rest." ... Add Atlanta's Chris Washburn to the list 
of former North Carolina State players who've come to the support of Jim 
Valvano: "If they changed grades, why didn't they change enough to get me a 
diploma?" ... Sacramento has informed oft-injured off guard Derek Smith he no 
longer figures in their plans. ... Former Utah coach Frank Layden says he's on 
the Oprah Winfrey diet. "It's not a diet," said Fat Frank, "it's a fast."

BOBBY MADURO STADIUM: IT'S HOME TO ORIOLES AND NICARAGUAN REFUGEES 
</P>

<P>
Maybe you've seen the pictures of wash hanging from the batting cage at the 
ballpark here. There's more wash on the railing that separates the stands from 
the field. In fact, most sight lines feature a baseball field framed in wet 
clothing. None of which is surprising in this strange city, where nearly 
anything is possible, up to and including a combination refugee camp-baseball 
stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The sign out front says, "Bobby Maduro Miami Stadium, the spring training home 
of the Baltimore Orioles." But despite the grounds crew hard at work, none of 
the signs inside seems even remotely connected with either the Orioles or 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Where it says, "No running on ramps," Spanish-speaking youngsters are racing on 
skateboards. Where it says, "Grounds crew," you open a door to find the control 
center at the heart of a city operation that includes housing and feeding and 
care for 400 Nicaraguan refugees and Miami homeless. 
</P>
<P>
That would seem to be job enough, but there is the additional responsibility of 
trying to figure out where else to place them. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not the best place for people to be," says Alex Martinez, the 
assistant director of Miami's Department of Parks, Recreation and Public 
Facilities. "We opened it in December, on a particularly cold night, to the 
homeless in the city. And we figured, why not make this a temporary home for 
the refugees." 
</P>
<P>
Martinez is a hospitable man, talking to an inquiring reporter when he can and 
talking to nearly everyone else, too. At one point, he is speaking into two 
phones at once. There is much to do. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have everyone out of here by the weekend," he says, before 
pausing and adding, with a wry smile, "hopefully." 
</P>
<P>
There is a deadline and, this once, it has nothing to do with the Super Bowl or 
with the riots. The refugee problem is business as usual in Miami, except that 
now the Orioles need to get the place in shape for spring training, the annual 
ritual that begins this season in Miami on March 1, after a few weeks' stay in 
Sarasota, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
In the best of times, the stadium would win few awards for aesthetics. And 
these are not the best of times. 
</P>
<P>
There's a certain disarray that comes of 400 house guests, beginning with 
backed-up plumbing and ending with the makeshift clotheslines. You don't easily 
shower where somebody else is keeping his pillow. And somebody's pillow is 
likely to be anyplace. 
</P>
<P>
The scene is something like a field hospital might be, except there are no 
wounded. Cots are stacked together, with almost no space between them, one for 
each man, woman and child. Men are in one section, women and children in 
another. And clothing is everywhere. A blue blazer is hanging on a railing. A 
young man has stuffed what seem to be all his belongings inside a jacket. 
Beside the cots are suitcases and, in some cases, plastic bags stuffed with 
clothes. And you don't even want to know about the diapers. 
</P>
<P>
For the Nicaraguans, who are refugees applying for political asylum, the coming 
baseball season is a dim reality. And dimmer still is their understanding of 
the controversy surrounding their arrival in Miami, where Nicaraguans have come 
by the thousands. 
</P>
<P>
Central to the riot that has set parts of their adoptive city ablaze is a 
feeling among many blacks that these refugees are the subject of greater 
concern and care than the inner-city underclass. 
</P>
<P>
"Why them before us?" asks Fred Lockhart, a student and one of the black 
homeless living at the stadium. "Everyone deserves an opportunity, but it 
should be an equal opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
Another problem is that Nicaraguans are allowed into the country in large part 
because of the Reagan administration's anti-Sandinista stand. Ordinary 
refugees, who are turned away from most other countries, seem to become 
political refugees when they're from Nicaragua. Because Haitian boat people, 
who are mostly black, are routinely turned away, that, too, has sparked 
tensions. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez says that people don't realize that the homeless are in the stadium 
along with the Nicaraguans. He says he is trying just as hard to place 
everyone, but he does admit to a certain responsibility he believes Americans 
owe the refugees. 
</P>
<P>
"They can't get jobs because they don't have work permits," he says. "They have 
no legal status. Right now, they're in limbo. But if they can't work, how are 
they going to survive if someone doesn't take responsibility for them? 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me, you have two choices: Either send them back where they came 
from or allow them to work. Of 400 cases, we have only 50 work permits. People 
here are trying to pressure Washington to speed up the process." 
</P>
<P>
And yet, refugees must be a patient lot. The trip here takes weeks and is not 
without danger. I talked to one man, Jose Vasquez, who arrived only Wednesday. 
He had fled Nicaragua through the mountains to Guatemala, taking his wife and 
four children. 
</P>
<P>
In Guatemala, he stopped to work -- "I do anything," he says through a 
translator -- to raise money for the rest of the trip, which amounts to a bus 
ride through Mexico and an illegal crossing of the Rio Grande. The coyotes, as 
those who aid the passage of illegal aliens and refugees are known, led him 
across, he and his wife swimming while pulling the children along in inner 
tubes. 
</P>
<P>
In Texas, they applied for asylum. And once there, they were wired money for 
the one-way bus ticket to Miami. They all want to come to Miami, where there 
are Spanish newspapers, Spanish radio stations, Spanish television stations and 
a large Latino community. A telethon on the two Spanish stations raised $35,000 
to place the new refugees in apartments. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a chance for a new life," Vasquez says, and you are hard-pressed not 
to root for him. 
</P>
<P>
"So many people are coming to their assistance," Martinez says. "We are a city 
with a big heart." 
</P>
<P>
And a city with big problems. The riots are one, where some in the inner-city 
say the big heart is closed to them; the refugees are another. But big problems 
are made of small ones. And getting the Nicaraguans out of the baseball park to 
make room for the Orioles is one more small headache in the mix.

SHOW BUSINESS LIFE IS A SERIES OF CRUISES FOR ACTRESS-DIRECTOR PAT CARROLL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Expect straight talk from Pat Carroll. It's what you'll get. "When I started 
working with this bunch of youngsters," said the redoubtable actress, referring 
to her staging of Wendy Wasserstein's "Uncommon Women and Others" (opening this 
weekend at the Melrose Theatre in Hollywood), "I don't think a lot of them knew 
who the hell I was. It didn't hurt my feelings -- why should it? The only thing 
I take seriously is the work." 
</P>
<P>
She talks gleefully about a recent nosebleed ("We're talking rivers of blood") 
that prompted a visit to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. "The front of my white 
shirt looked like I'd been in a gang knifing; my hair was matted from the ice 
packs. Later, my daughters told me there'd been two Latino fellows watching me. 
</P>
<P>
"One of them said, 'Isn't that the lady from "She's the Sheriff"?' 
</P>
<P>
"The other one said, 'Yeah, man, she's got blood all over her. I wonder what 
happened?' 
</P>
<P>
" 'Maybe Suzanne Somers punched her out.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Louisiana-born actress, who was educated in Catholic school, takes an 
equally unegotistic tack on the play. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel older and experienced -- in a good way," she said of her young cast, 
"but I don't feel older in terms of discovery. I think every time you start 
doing a play, it's like a ship cruise. We all book passage together. And each 
sailing is never the same. It can be the same ports of call, the same boat, the 
same cabin. But the people make the difference. People always make the 
difference. Different personalities, different inputs. We're all trying to 
discover this play at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
The play (last seen locally in 1981) was brought to the actress-director by her 
daughters, Kerry and Tara, as a potential family project. 
</P>
<P>
"It's about five gals who were really tight in college; they're meeting in a 
restaurant six years ater graduation -- and they haven't seen each other in all 
that time. It's a memory play, so you can go any place you want, do anything 
you want. We flash back to their senior year, when they were on top of the 
hill, but knowing damn well that in a few months they were going out into the 
world and being freshmen again, starting at the bottom." 
</P>
<P>
What does Carroll bring to it? 
</P>
<P>
"An eye, I hope," she said. "Laughter. Perhaps some hope." She shrugged. "Look, 
I don't know that much. I've got instincts. I've got 40 years of experience 
that's taught me some general rules. But each performance in the theater is 
another birthing. I can't tell you the number of things I've discovered two 
months into a run. It's the only kind of acting where you've got eight chances 
a week at bat -- the chance to be awake, alive and aware every night. I love 
it." 
</P>
<P>
You can almost hear her champing at the bit. For an actress so recognizable 
from her hundreds of TV appearances, Carroll, 61, can't wait to get back on the 
stage. The day after "Uncommon Women" closes, Carroll (who served as a civilian 
actress-technician during World War II -- producing, writing and directing the 
Army's shows) will trade in her director's togs for a nun's habit, reprising 
her role as the Mother Superior in a touring production of Dan Goggin's 
"Nunsense" -- "the most fun I ever had." 
</P>
<P>
A similar high point came in the early '80s with her one-woman tribute, 
"Gertrude Stein, Gertrude Stein," which Carroll performed around the country 
for five years. 
</P>
<P>
"Doing that, I got to use everything I'd ever done," she recalled with relish. 
"It was all in me: in my hands, in my bones. There wasn't anything I wasn't 
able to use. It was the only time in my career where I've thought, 'I can quit 
now -- because I know what it's all about. It's about compiling those stones, 
building whatever that ultimate edifice is.' I could've hung up my gloves after 
that," she chortled, "but I didn't. 'Cause I'm too curious about what's around 
the corner." 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
The acting bug bit early. As a child, Carroll went to the movies half a dozen 
times each week; at 13, she saw her first play. "And at 13 1/2, I knew I wanted 
to do it." At 20, she headed for New York City and got her Equity card. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked like a cocker spaniel," she said with a grin, "a bus-and-truck 
Patricia Neal. I also knew at 20 that I wasn't an ingenue. And I knew I did 
comedy. I did stand-up in some chic New York clubs. It took a lot of chutzpah, 
belief in self. I don't think I struck any of my contemporaries as being 
anything special. And nobody was writing young character people then. I always 
felt there wasn't a path for me, that I was going to have to cut my own. So I 
just kept banging on doors." 
</P>
<P>
Though recognition -- and a 1956 Emmy -- came for her work opposite Sid Caesar 
on "The Danny Thomas Show," Carroll swears that success never went to her head. 
"Apart from the work, there's a separate identity," she said, "the me I am at 3 
in the morning, when no one's around. My family is extremely important to me. 
So is the life of my mind. I'm an eternal seeker; my curiosity level is very 
high. I live on a street called Wonderland." 
</P>
<P>
It's definitely a rosy picture -- and financial security doesn't hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very grateful for TV," Carroll said with a nod, "because it's allowed me 
to do my theater. I'm very honest about the TV work; I try not to bite the hand 
that feeds me so nicely. Well, not too much." In fact, it was TV money -- 
contractually owed her for upcoming series work on the Ted Knight show, which 
was canceled when star Ted Knight died -- that is financing this production. 
"The money just didn't feel earned," Carroll said briskly. "Doing this with it 
. . . well, Ted would've adored it." 
</P>
<P>
She's certainly loving it. Working with her daughters -- the elder one 
producing, the younger one in the cast -- "has just knocked me out," Carroll 
said, beaming. "I will treasure this experience for the rest of my life." 
</P>
<P>
She does not take her success for granted. "I suppose I'm one of the 
fortunates. I know it's rare. Mind you, we're not talking about great stardom 
here. But it has been 40 years of consistent work in every area: from 
nightclubs to Broadway to any kind of stock, musicals and legit, dinner 
theater, regional theater, one-person shows. In the last three years, I've 
started doing cartoon series. Now I'm doing a voice-over for a fully animated 
Disney film. I play the mean sea witch, a squid called Ursula." 
</P>
<P>
As for future plans, "I really want to play Falstaff in 'The Merry Wives of 
Windsor.' " I know it sounds cocky. But I think I could pull it off. And it'd 
be a hoot."

In your article, "Consul Says Agents Shot 2 Mexicans From Behind," (Jan. 14), 
it is stated that three undocumented migrant workers were shot in their back, 
back of the skull and buttocks by members of the Border Patrol and the San 
Diego police. 
</P>
<P>
The way the events developed is unclear, but the allegations made by a Mexican 
diplomat and a San Diego lawyer directly contradict the neat official version. 
</P>
<P>
It is imperative to obtain the real story. This implies an independent 
investigation of events by agencies not linked to the Border Patrol and San 
Diego Police Department, which are parties in the deaths of the alleged 
undocumented migrant workers. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, in my opinion, it is necessary to obtain a clear statement from 
the authorities in charge of the Border Crime Prevention Unit clarifying the 
role and orders of this controversial task force whose preventive measures have 
resulted in 18 deaths since its creation.

SCHOOL CLINIC ISSUE DESERVES RECHECKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAUREEN BROWN, Maureen Brown is a former teacher who lives in La Jolla. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From what I have observed thus far, the Nintendo computer game system comes 
with a more comprehensive set of instructions and programs than parents and 
educators acquire with children. In Nintendo, guidelines are tidy and clearly 
mapped out, and the player needs only to comply with the instructions to 
perform skillfully. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, were it only so with parenting and education. With innumerable variables 
such as personality, behavior, intelligent quotient and economic factors, 
decisions affecting children become so much more onerous. Every decree must be 
weighed carefully and eventually re-evaluated when the timing is suitable. When 
the issues immersed in the judgment are emotional and controversial, time bears 
an important role in determining when best to approach the topic again. 
</P>
<P>
"Time crumbles things; everything grows under the power of time and is 
forgotten through the lapse of time," Aristotle wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Almost three years have elapsed since the San Diego Unified School District 
considered establishing health-care clinics at some high schools. Funded by a 
private foundation, the centers would have been staffed by professionals who, 
depending on the program adopted by the district, would provide physical 
examinations, immunizations, counseling and birth control information. 
</P>
<P>
The district appointed a committee of 30 people from business, educational, 
health and religious sectors to listen to the public's opinion, examine the 
needs of the community, study similar programs in other school districts and 
make a recommendation to the school board. The committee made a favorable 
recommendation to the school district. 
</P>
<P>
The board considered the recommendation of the committee, listened to more 
community debate and assessed that the public was unwilling to accept the role 
of the school district in this form of health care. 
</P>
<P>
But after three years, and two new board members, it's time to reconsider 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
It is fitting to bury the anger and emotional drama that accompanied the idea 
of school-based health clinics and approach the topic again in a caring milieu. 
Sufficient time may have passed to allow the various interest groups to 
approach the issue with facts, and without the distraction of emotion. 
</P>
<P>
The school district will now have more data to present to the community. 
Educators can interpret the effectiveness of similar programs in parallel 
communities. Does there still appear to be a need for the clinics in San Diego? 
</P>
<P>
Three years will have allowed religious factions to show how the alternative 
programs they suggested have been implemented and whether they have met the 
needs of adolescents. 
</P>
<P>
Three years will have given the medical community and affiliated groups an 
opportunity to relate how their programs have dealt with the issue of 
adolescent medicine. 
</P>
<P>
And, in three years, the legions of adolescents and parents will have grown, 
affording another group an opportunity to study and discuss the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Now is the time for the parents who supported the clinic to determine if their 
reasoning was accurate. Do they have specific examples where health care on 
campus might have helped a teen-ager? Moreover, it is an occasion for the 
parents who opposed the program to render their opinions. May we hear again 
from the mother of the ninth-grader who saw no need for such support. How have 
the subsequent years influenced her conviction? 
</P>
<P>
And this mother of four, who now has two high school students? How have the 
three years affected my views? Bobby McFerrin, the Grammy nominee, sings to me, 
"Don't worry, be happy," my dear friend tells me to pray more, but I am not 
calmed by what I read, hear or see. 
</P>
<P>
Am I alone in my belief that, although we counsel our children, preach to them, 
monitor their activities and love them, we still need and benefit from the 
assistance of other professionals? 
</P>
<P>
Three years later, like other parents, I am chanting "say 'no' " to drugs and 
alcohol, capitalizing on the merits of abstinence with regard to teen-age sex, 
stressing good nutrition and asking that wet towels not be left on the bedroom 
floors. Yet, I am still finding wet towels on the bedroom floors. 
</P>
<P>
I have sat with the anxious friend whose daughter had anorexia nervosa and 
wondered about other young people. I have heard of the football player who 
works at gaining weight or the wrestler who attempts to lose weight to wrestle 
in a different weight class. While discussing vitamins, nutritional supplements 
and diuretics, I observe adolescents consuming mass quantities of nachos and 
diet soda. 
</P>
<P>
I have heard the whispered talk of the young girl who needed an abortion and 
questioned how this might have been prevented. 
</P>
<P>
I have delivered the liturgical reading at the funeral of the friend who died 
from AIDS and prayed that I would not have to see another mother's anguish. 
</P>
<P>
I have applauded the PE teacher who introduced the topic of scoliosis and 
discovered the young girl's advanced case. I have been told of the curious 
teen-ager, who, after studying the circulatory system in a science class, had 
his blood pressure checked at a local shopping center. Three days later, 
cardiac surgery saved his life. How many others? 
</P>
<P>
And I have winced in the midst of a discussion about the child admitted to a 
drug and alcohol treatment program as another parent quipped, "Well, I know 
that none of my teen-agers would ever use drugs or drink alcohol." 
</P>
<P>
I have seen teen-agers weep over the suicide of a friend and watched parents 
and teachers question how they might have helped. 
</P>
<P>
The re-evaluation of school-based, health clinics in the San Diego Unified 
School District. It's time.

HUMAN NATURE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Escondido Police Officer Martin Hewlett shot Robert Scriven at least 11 times 
at close range, and Police Chief Vince Jimno defends the action by saying, 
"It's human nature to shoot until the attacker stops." 
</P>
<P>
If it took this much firepower to stop the 170-pound Scriven, then Officer 
Hewlett was certainly in grave danger, more than anyone can possibly imagine. 
</P>
<P>
The "human nature" factor that Chief Jimno cites is probably the reason why 
officer Hewlett fired 15 rounds total, but does it excuse him? Law enforcement 
officials have a great responsibility to the public, and part of that 
responsibility is to have a better control of their "human nature" than the 
average citizen. 
</P>
<P>
If I'm out of work and homeless and my children are hungry, and I take up a gun 
and rob a gas station to get money to buy my children food, will Chief Jimno 
defend me by pointing out that it is only human nature for me to want to feed 
my hungry children?

A man stood to speak at the second public forum of the Martin Luther King 
Tribute Advisory Board. His demeanor and dress were forbidding. He had a slight 
resemblance to Adolf Hitler, or maybe Charlie Chaplin, but, judging from his 
intense glare, he wasn't here to entertain us with pratfalls. 
</P>
<P>
King was a womanizer, he told us. He was also a Communist. The speaker had no 
whit of reliable evidence to support his claims, and he could barely conceal 
his hatred for blacks as he spoke. King did not deserve to be honored, he said; 
King was a disgrace to the United States of America. 
</P>
<P>
I haven't been able to forget that man. I thought of him during all the 
subsequent meetings the board held. 
</P>
<P>
As the attendance at the eight public meetings dwindled, I wondered about the 
viability of our task. We had to recommend a suitable tribute for the Rev. Dr. 
Martin Luther King Jr., a man who, even after death, engenders passions of 
antipathy and reverence. But the city seemed stricken by a civic anemia: Even 
after the bitter fight over Market Street/King Way, few people came forward to 
offer a better idea. 
</P>
<P>
Where, I wondered, were all the people who said: "I'm not a racist. King 
deserves to be honored, but the City Council tried to sneak the street name 
change past us"? Where were these people who, a few months before, were so 
eager to participate in finding a tribute for the martyred civil rights leader? 
</P>
<P>
I thought of that angry man, and I wondered if there was any difference between 
him and the people who vehemently opposed King Way. Their absence from our 
meetings seemed to lend credence to claims that their opposition was motivated 
by racism. 
</P>
<P>
I wondered how these people, or people like them, would respond to our final 
recommendation? The brilliance of our tribute decision, I hoped, would outshine 
the glare of any opposition lit by ignorance. 
</P>
<P>
I was naive. 
</P>
<P>
Ignorance can design sly ways to disguise itself as wisdom. 
</P>
<P>
Some people have said the convention center already has a name and that 
changing it would go against the tribute advisory board's own stated goals; 
some people claim that affixing King's name to the convention center will 
lessen San Diego's identity with the building; other people say that naming the 
convention center in honor of King will make it harder to market the building 
worldwide. And, most ludicrous of all, a few people allege that the citizens of 
San Diego haven't had a chance to give their input. 
</P>
<P>
The last argument against the tribute relates nicely to the first one. What 
citizen input was there in the first place when the name San Diego Convention 
Center was selected? I don't remember any. Maybe there was, but it wasn't 
publicized sufficiently. That is one of the same arguments the pro-Market 
Street people used, isn't it? At best, San Diego Convention Center is only a 
working title. 
</P>
<P>
The most insulting arguments against the San Diego Martin Luther King 
Convention Center dwell in the gritty world of economics. What are people 
telling us about themselves, about their prejudices, when they say King's name 
will drive away business? (As if money is more important than a community's 
dignity.) 
</P>
<P>
King's name on the building will not obscure San Diego. His name will 
illuminate it. It saddens me to hear our business leaders whine about the 
horrible injustice they will suffer if King's name is emblazoned on the 
convention center. How will the name of a man who preached against violence and 
hatred hurt business? 
</P>
<P>
By naming the convention center after the Martin Luther King, we are telling 
the world that we are a community of peace, love and equality. The name will 
advertise to all who come here for their car shows and sales meetings that we 
believe in the values espoused by King. When people in Singapore talk about 
that wonderful city in California, somebody in the group will comment that he 
or she "felt marvelously welcome in San Diego." The spirit of the man will 
radiate throughout the building -- if we allow it, if we welcome it. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Unified Port District should not let this opportunity slip away. 
The commissioners should ignore the plaintive cries of those who had a chance 
to express their opinions to the advisory board but chose to remain silent, and 
name the convention center for the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. By doing so, not 
only do they honor King, they honor San Diego.

BID FOR ANTENNA SPARKS A CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
The Federal Communications Commission says local governments cannot prevent 
amateur radio operators from having antennas of "reasonable" height. The 
commission notes the public safety role that ham operators sometimes play, and 
says their right to free speech is also involved. 
</P>
<P>
But the commission has never defined reasonable, and what is reasonable in a 
hilly Rancho Palos Verdes neighborhood near Peninsula Center has become a 
matter of bitter disagreement. 
</P>
<P>
Aerospace engineer Walter F. Ordway, a member of the Palos Verdes Amateur Radio 
Club who is active in the city's emergency communications network, contends 
that he needs an 85-foot antenna tower for his ham radio operations. 
</P>
<P>
But some of his neighbors and few hundred others in the city who have signed 
petitions opposing it assert that the antenna would be an eyesore, a hazard if 
it blew down and a precedent that could open the door for big antennas 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"It's too high and will interfere with our view," said Lucian S. Rochte, a 
retired Air Force colonel who lives behind Ordway's Grayslake Avenue home. 
"This is a high-density residential area with small lots. . . . The distances 
are so short. I'd be 75 feet away." 
</P>
<P>
In October, after residents protested the city staff's approval of the tower, 
the city Planning Commission, in response to concerns about it obstructing the 
view, required that the device be lowered to 23 feet when not in use. 
</P>
<P>
But last week, after a 3 1/2-hour public hearing in a meeting room packed with 
protesting residents, the City Council put off a decision on the tower until 
Feb. 7 and asked Ordway to provide more justification for the tower. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got to make a case for it," said Mayor Jacki Bacharach. 
</P>
<P>
Ordway said after the council session that he needs a pole of at least 70 feet 
for clear radio reception. A city ordinance requires permits and justification 
for any radio tower higher than 40 feet. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue is his need for an antenna of this height versus neighborhood 
concerns," said Robert Benard, city environmental services director. 
</P>
<P>
The antenna controversy has resulted in vandalism to the Ordway home and the 
theft of two ham radios from Ordway's van, according to his wife, Joanne, and 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Joanne Ordway said the home was pelted with eggs four or five times, and that 
last Thanksgiving, wet newspapers were spread over the front lawn. "There were 
two trash barrels full," she said. The culprits were never identified, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"This has created a situation that we have not experienced during my time in 
the neighborhood, and I've been here 25 years," said George W. Kacirek, a 
retired Mobil Oil marketing manager who opposes the erection of the antenna. 
"I've never seen a group of people as irate." 
</P>
<P>
But the Ordways have some neighbors on their side too. 
</P>
<P>
"I wonder what all the uproar is about," said Carol McLennas, who lives across 
the street. "They want one single vertical tower to put an antenna on and it 
will be lowered to 23 feet. There are plenty of trees in everybody's yard 
taller than that." 
</P>
<P>
She said youthful radio enthusiasts come to the Ordway home to learn about the 
hobby. "It's good to get the kids involved in that, rather than drugs and 
alcohol." 
</P>
<P>
Some critics assert that the city is overemphasizing Ordway's free-speech 
rights at the expense of neighborhood quality because three officials involved 
in the decision -- Planning Commissioner Peter Von Hagen and Councilmen Melvin 
Hughes and John McTaggart -- are members of the same amateur radio club that 
Ordway belongs to. 
</P>
<P>
Russell Harrison, another Ordway neighbor who fears that the antenna will 
reduce the value of his $600,000 home, has asked Hughes and McTaggart to 
disqualify themselves from council consideration of the issue. He contends that 
the club "will use this antenna" -- Joanne Ordway denies that -- and has 
something to gain from approval. 
</P>
<P>
"They can't be objective," Rochte said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No Conflict' 
</P>
<P>
Hughes disagrees. "There is no conflict of interest," he said. "I am a ham 
radio operator, but this does not mean I won't make a decision that weighs all 
the issues fairly. I hold a driver's license, but I should not disqualify 
myself from issues related to highway safety, parking or street construction." 
</P>
<P>
He called the pending decision a "balancing act" between "allowing all 
reasonable communication" and responding to community concerns.

THOUSANDS TO RUN REDONDO 10K TODAY, DESPITE TRAGEDY IN '88 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB WILLIAMS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Up to 15,000 people will take to the streets of Redondo Beach today for the 
11th annual Super Bowl Sunday 10K Run, set to begin at 7:50 a.m. at King 
Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
It will end at the same location on Harbor Drive as the participants dash, walk 
or limp to the finish line of the 6.2-mile course. There, according to 
sponsors, they will be "greeted by balloons, banners, cheering spectators and 
refreshments." 
</P>
<P>
The awards ceremony will be held at the Seaside Lagoon, a city park near the 
Sheraton Hotel parking lot -- not in the Redondo Pier parking structure, where 
a tragic accident marred the conclusion of last year's race. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsors of the 10K run said memories of the accident, in which one runner was 
killed and nine other people were severely injured when a ventilation grating 
collapsed under them, appeared to be having no effect on this year's event. 
</P>
<P>
Chamber of Commerce spokesman Deke Houlgate said Friday that more than 8,000 
people had turned in advance registrations, about the samenumber as last year. 
When last-minute registrations and "pirates" -- those who run without signing 
up -- are tallied , the total is expected to reach 12,000 to 15,000. About 
11,500 ran a year ago, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think people who like to run, or people in general, blame the event 
itself for that very tragic occurrence," Houlgate said. 
</P>
<P>
The Redondo run, timed to coincide with the Super Bowl, is billed as Southern 
California's oldest and largest 10-kilometer road race. Houlgate said proceeds 
go to community programs sponsored by the chamber. 
</P>
<P>
Ernie O'Dell, the chamber's executive director, recalled that the Seaside 
Lagoon had always been the location for post-run festivities and awards 
ceremonies, until last year's race. They were moved to the Redondo Pier parking 
structure because an ocean storm had left the park littered with boulders and 
debris, he said. 
</P>
<P>
O'Dell said the chamber, as the sponsor of the 10K event, is among defendants 
named in lawsuits filed by those injured in the accident. 
</P>
<P>
The dead man and the injured were among more than 500 people who had gathered 
on the park-like roof of the parking structure after the 1988 race. When the 
ventilation grating collapsed under the weight of people standing on it, they 
fell 25 feet to the concrete floor below. Several of them had just completed 
the race. 
</P>
<P>
City workers covered the garage's ventilation openings with thick plywood and a 
long, costly legal struggle began, as victims sought compensation for their 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The heavy metal grates rested on iron strips that were attached to the concrete 
sides of the ventilation shafts with quarter-inch bolts. In early attempts to 
determine the cause of the accident, some experts said the bolts should have 
been at least twice as thick and drilled deeper into the concrete. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuits blame local authorities and the run's sponsors for not taking 
measures to prevent people from standing on the grates. Victims were reportedly 
waiting in a refreshment line. 
</P>
<P>
Parties in the lawsuits are unwilling to publicly discuss the issue of 
liability. Resolution of the lawsuits is expected to take four or five years. 
</P>
<P>
Eight of the accident victims and the survivors of the man who died, 
36-year-old Robert A. Bode of Tujunga, have indicated that they intend to file 
lawsuits seeking either multimillion-dollar or unspecified damages. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Spaller, 27, apparently did not file an injury claim against Redondo 
Beach within the six-month limit set by California, thus making him ineligible 
to sue. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Gordon Phillips said only two accident victims have officially 
served lawsuits against the city so far, but more are expected. He said he 
could not estimate the total damages that might eventually be sought by the 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
The contractors involved in the design and construction of the parking 
structure are expected to be hit by lawsuits from both the accident victims and 
the city.

50TH DISTRICT CANDIDATES FOCUS DEBATE ON TUCKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As befits a special election expected to draw a low voter turnout, the small 
crowd that turned out for a candidate forum in Inglewood last week was 
dominated by political insiders. 
</P>
<P>
About 50 people, many of them campaign workers and former or future candidates 
for various offices, watched the debate among the 50th Assembly District 
candidates: Republican Mike Davis and Democrats Lois Hill-Hale, Carl McGill, 
and Curtis Tucker Jr. The four are seeking to fill the seat of Curtis Tucker, 
who died in October. 
</P>
<P>
The forum, organized by the Inglewood/Airport Chamber of Commerce, was one of 
the few opportunities voters will have to see the candidates before the special 
election on Feb. 7. 
</P>
<P>
As expected, the focus at Thursday's debate was on Tucker, considered the 
favorite because of the financial and political support he has attracted from 
top Democrats, most notably Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco). As 
of the last campaign reporting date, Tucker had raised more than $48,000; none 
of his opponents had raised more than $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker's foes hammered at the issue of leadership. Their hopes for an upset 
appear to rest on persuading voters that Tucker's main qualification is his 
name and that Brown is condemning the district to ineffective leadership 
controlled by outside forces. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tucker's Position 
</P>
<P>
Tucker, a legislative aide to Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles), said he 
is the most qualified candidate to carry on the policies of his father. He said 
his connections to the Democratic leadership will help him get things done in 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Another major issue was the death penalty, which Tucker supports and Hill-Hale 
opposes. 
</P>
<P>
Candidates also discussed health care, crime, education, economic development 
and ethnic relations, all pressing issues in the district, which encompasses El 
Segundo, Inglewood, Lennox, Westchester and parts of South Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Although Davis, a Republican, has sought the Assembly seat twice without 
success, most recently when the elder Tucker won a posthumous victory in 
November, Tucker's strategists see him as potentially the strongest challenger 
to Tucker. Candidates, their strategists and elected officials predict that as 
few as 26,000 of the largely Democratic district's 147,520 registered voters 
will cast ballots. That means conservatives in largely Republican El Segundo 
and Westchester, who tend to vote more consistently, could form a 
disproportionate part of the electorate and boost Davis' chances. 
</P>
<P>
If no one wins more than 50% of the vote Feb. 7, the top Democrat will face 
Davis in an April runoff. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, a business consultant, described himself as the candidate who can best 
serve as a "bridge" between the more affluent western part of the district and 
the economically depressed eastern sections. 
</P>
<P>
"One common sociological thread does not exist," Davis said. "You have to get 
out into the different communities and hear the constituents. I'm the man who 
can do it." 
</P>
<P>
Davis calls himself a moderate Republican. For example, he said, California 
should adopt a universal health insurance plan similar to that set up in 
Massachusetts by the former Democratic presidential candidate, Gov. Michael S. 
Dukakis. 
</P>
<P>
Hill-Hale, an Inglewood school board member who appears to be Tucker's toughest 
Democratic competition, emphasized that she is the only elected official in the 
race and worked eight years as chief deputy to Sen. Diane Watson. (D-Los 
Angeles). Watson has joined other Democrats endorsing Tucker, though Hill-Hale 
calls that a result of pressure by Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Hill-Hale said she would be a "fresh new start" for the district and lambasted 
Tucker as a tool of "fat cats in Sacramento." On the question of shrinking 
availability of emergency health care, especially to low-income constituents, 
she claimed that the elder Tucker respected her as a health expert. She pledged 
to work for increased state funding for health care and to be "eternally 
vigilant" against racism. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clash on Death Penalty 
</P>
<P>
Hill-Hale also attacked Tucker on the death penalty, which she opposes because 
she claims it is disproportionately applied to minorities. She called Tucker's 
statements that it is cheaper to execute criminals than pay for them to stay on 
Death Row "elitist and cavalier." 
</P>
<P>
Tucker accused Hill-Hale of misrepresenting his statements and reiterated his 
position that some of the money paying to house Death Row inmates could go to 
health care or education. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe in capital punishment for specific crimes," he said. "It costs more 
to keep a man on Death Row for a year than it does to send a kid to Harvard. . 
. . There's not much chance to rehabilitate a mass murderer." 
</P>
<P>
Tucker also said criticism of his allegiance to Brown is a diversionary tactic. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the most powerful man in the state," Tucker said. "In order to get 
anything done, you have to work with him, not against him." 
</P>
<P>
McGill, a Los Angeles police officer and recognized gang expert, is a political 
newcomer who admits to lacking funds. He claimed grass-roots support and 
commitment to law enforcement, especially his efforts to educate the community 
about gang violence. McGill also sounded the most repeated and passionate 
attack on Tucker and the Democratic leadership, whom he blames for neglecting 
the district and allowing problems of crime, unemployment and drugs to fester. 
</P>
<P>
"There are brothers out there who need jobs," McGill said. "There are sisters 
selling their bodies on Figueroa (Street). I'm sick of seeing kids die in the 
streets. . . . The community has suffered a great deal because it has not had 
proper representation." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE CANDIDATES 
</P>
<P>
Curtis Tucker Jr., Considered the favorite because of support he has drawn from 
top Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Davis, Conservatives, who tend to vote more consistently, could boost the 
chances for Davis, a Republican. 
</P>
<P>
Lois Hill-Hale, The Inglewood school board member emphasizes that she is the 
only elected official in the race. 
</P>
<P>
Carl McGill, The Los Angeles police officer, who is an expert on gangs, is a 
political newcomer.

PRINCESS LOUISE LOSES BID FOR PORT, SHUTS DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL STOLBERG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The cruise ship Princess Louise shut down its galleys, battened down its 
hatches and rolled up its gangplanks for good this week, quietly ending an era 
in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday -- six days after a Superior Court judge refused to order the Los 
Angeles Harbor Department to let the floating restaurant stay at its berth -- 
owner Marion Perkov turned the Princess Louise over to his main creditor, the 
Bank of San Pedro. The bank intends to sell it. 
</P>
<P>
The closing of the ocean liner-turned-restaurant, which came without publicity 
or fanfare, marked a sad day for many San Pedro old-timers who have fond 
memories of weddings, high school reunions and banquets aboard the 68-year-old 
Princess Louise. 
</P>
<P>
Perkov, however, had little choice. 
</P>
<P>
He had filed for protection from his creditors under federal bankruptcy laws 
last April and was struggling to reorganize. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Vessel Got Berth 
</P>
<P>
But in August, the Harbor Department assigned his berth to a new vessel, the 
Spirit of Los Angeles, which is set to begin running dinner cruises from there 
in the spring. Port officials ordered Perkov out by Jan. 15. 
</P>
<P>
There is little chance now that the Princess Louise, which has become a fixture 
during its 22 years in San Pedro, will remain in the seaside community. A 
Harbor Department official said Thursday that there is no other place in the 
port for the Princess Louise. 
</P>
<P>
And the president of the Bank of San Pedro, which has advertised the ship as "a 
piece of history" and "a fantastic floating attraction," said the two most 
promising offers he has received are from prospective buyers who would move the 
vessel to San Diego or San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a pleasant thing," said bank President Lance Oak, who said he has 
attended hundreds of events aboard the ship, including a Christmas party put on 
by the bank. "Nobody likes to foreclose on property. But it's a business 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
Oak said the bank hopes the 360-foot-long, 36,000-square-foot ship will bring 
in between $1.3 million and $1.5 million. He said the bank is offering 
financing if the ship remains in California. 
</P>
<P>
Perkov's lawyer, Michael Rogers, said the request for a preliminary injunction, 
denied Jan. 10 by Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Kurt Lewin, was his client's 
last hope. 
</P>
<P>
"Once we lost the injunction it was inevitable that somehow, some way, the bank 
would move (to claim the ship)," Rogers said. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers said Perkov is continuing to press forward with a $2-million lawsuit 
against the bank, the Harbor Department and the ship's former owners, San Pedro 
developers Steven Podesta and Bill Moller. The suit claims that the defendants, 
through a tangled series of transactions, defrauded Perkov and caused the 
Princess Louise to enter Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The defendants have denied the 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
Perkov himself could not be reached for comment. But in April, he told The 
Times that he had hoped to pay off his debts and remain in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not here to close," he said then. "We are inches away from the break-even 
point. It would be a shame to have to lose her now." 
</P>
<P>
Many in San Pedro feel the same way, but they are resigned to seeing the 
Princess Louise go. 
</P>
<P>
"We would have liked to have had the Princess Louise stay, but I guess it 
couldn't be," said Flora Baker, president of the San Pedro Bay Historical 
Society. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Name of the Game' 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of sentiment in favor of keeping the ship here because she has 
become somewhat of a landmark," said Bill Olesen, 84, an associate curator at 
the Los Angeles Maritime Museum. "But sentiment isn't where it's at nowadays. 
Nobody cares about sentiments. . . . They figure there's an opportunity to make 
more money and that's the name of the game." 
</P>
<P>
Built in 1921, the Princess Louise cruised the Alaskan straits from Vancouver, 
Canada, to Skagway, Alaska, for more than 40 years before being converted to a 
restaurant and brought to Terminal Island in 1966. The ship, which is no longer 
seaworthy, was moved to its current location, Berth 94, in 1979. It changed 
hands several times over the years; Perkov bought it in 1984.

Olesen, an aficionado of most things nautical, said he is particularly fond of 
the Princess Louise because its original structure has not been altered. The 
former Canadian ocean liner, named for the youngest daughter of Queen Victoria, 
is replete with intricate woodwork and detail. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a classic craftsmanship that will never be seen again," Olesen said. 
"It's a relic of a more stately and elegant era. . . . I just hope she doesn't 
end up in the scrap heap."

2ND-QUARTER ROLLING HILLS BURST SILENCES PV, 69-50

Trying to find a turning point in Rolling Hills' 69-50 victory at Palos Verdes 
Saturday night? 
</P>
<P>
Look no further than the second quarter at the Sea Kings gymnasium when the 
Titans netted the first 14 points of the period and outscored their hosts, 
29-11. The run, which lasted more than five minutes, silenced the Palos Verdes 
contingent in the standing-room-only crowd of 2,000 and paved the way for an 
easy victory for Rolling Hills, which was also well supported in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
The victory solidified the Titans' first-place hold in Bay League competition 
as they improved to 7-0 in league play and 16-3 overall, while Palos Verdes 
fell to 1-6 in league and 3-12 overall. 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills scored the first 5 points of the game but fell behind, 10-9, 
midway through the first period when Palos Verdes forward Cris Castello 
completed a 3-point play. The Titans reclaimed the lead seconds later on Mark 
Tesar's 3-pointer and led, 18-14, at the end of the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Center John Hardy and guard Ron Dinnel scored 7 and 5 points respectively in 
the first three minutes of the second quarter as Rolling Hills built a 32-14 
lead, and Tesar's 3-pointer at the buzzer capped off the second-quarter blitz. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes could get no closer than 15 points thereafter, and the Titans 
never looked back. 
</P>
<P>
"When we're running and making those shots, we look like a different team," 
said Rolling Hills Coach Cliff Warren. "At first our shots weren't going in, 
that's all." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "I think Tesar's 3-pointer just before half-time really gave us a 
boost, too." 
</P>
<P>
Both teams were somewhat sluggish in the third quarter, but a 10-0 Palos Verdes 
run pulled the Sea Kings to within 49-35 with 5:10 remaining. But Tesar and 
Rick Judge scored easy lay-ups and Dinnel swished two free throws to again pad 
Rolling Hills' lead. 
</P>
<P>
"We came out wanting to win the third quarter and play like the score was back 
to 0-0 again," said Sea Kings Coach John Mihaljevich. "We wanted to establish 
our offense and get some good shots. I think we did that, but we just weren't 
hitting them." 
</P>
<P>
Hardy led all scorers with 21 points, and Tesar contributed 20, including three 
3-pointers. Dinnel chipped in with 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes was paced by junior forward Scott Wilson's 14 points. Guard Craig 
Nagle scored 9.

TOROS SHOOT LONG, DEFEND TOUGH, COAST OVER POMONA, 73-51 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
You know things are going bad for a basketball team when the ball it selects 
for a game in its home gym is rejected by the officials before the opening 
tip-off. 
</P>
<P>
Such was the case Saturday night at Cal Poly Pomona where Cal State Dominguez 
Hills got a rare breather, tied a team record for most 3-point shots made, and 
coasted to a 73-51 California Collegiate Athletic Conference win before only 
491 spectators. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Blackmon led the Toros with 18 points, although he slightly twisted an 
ankle 1:20 into the game. It didn't seem to bother the senior on the boards, 
where he led both teams with 10 rebounds, or in assists, where he tied his 
career best with 7. 
</P>
<P>
About the only thing Pomona could do more of than the Toros was free-throw 
shooting. The Broncos went to the line 25 times, Dominguez Hills 5. 
</P>
<P>
Still, this one was over long before referee Bill White asked for the new ball. 
Pomona fell to 0-3 in the conference and 6-9 overall. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Hills on the other hand, is playing the best basketball it has 
exhibited in the past two seasons. The win improved the Toros' overall record 
to 10-6. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if you can call this a breather," said Dominguez Hills Coach Dave 
Yanai. "Pomona has been decimated with injuries. . . . Pomona played hard. They 
can be very proud." 
</P>
<P>
Pomona Coach Dave Bollwinkel agreed: "We're tying to do things with mirrors out 
there. . . . I'm proud of our kids. They played hard." 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Hills used nine 3-pointers en route to its fifth win in the last six 
games. The only loss was a 1-point defeat to second-ranked UC Riverside last 
Thursday night, a game that Riverside Coach John Masi said his team was 
fortunate to have won. 
</P>
<P>
In that game Dominguez Hills held Riverside, averaging 96 points a game, to 59, 
so it figured that Saturday night the Toros could improve upon their 
league-leading defensive posture. For the season Dominguez Hills has held its 
opponents to less than 63 points a game, less than 60 in each of the past three 
games. 
</P>
<P>
The Toros' defensive superiority was never so obvious this year than against 
the depleted Broncos. In the first half Dominguez Hills allowed Pomona just six 
field goals. Half of those came in the final five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Hills led after the first 20 minutes, 44-22, thanks in part to six 
3-point field goals. 
</P>
<P>
Segario Bozart had 16 points, Bryan Dell'Amico 12, and Barksdale 10 for 
Dominguez Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Guard Nate Macon led all scorers with 20 points and center Jim Skinner had 11. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Poly Pomona 83, Dominguez Hills 51 -- The fourth-ranked Lady Broncos toyed 
with the Lady Toros while improving their CCAA record to 3-0 and overall record 
to 14-4. Dominguez Hills is 5-9. 
</P>
<P>
"(Pomona Coach) Darlene May was very nice to us," said Dominguez Hills Coach 
Van Girard. "It could have been a lot worse." 
</P>
<P>
All 10 players scored for the Lady Broncos, who coasted to a 47-23 lead after 
the first 20 minutes. Guard Devon Akita led Dominguez Hills with 12 points but 
was just 4 of 9 from the field. Center Brigitte Frazier scored 11. Guard Khyra 
Anderson had 14 rebounds.

PREP WRAPUP / ROB FERNAS; 
</P>
<P>
2 BEST SOUTH BAY GIRLS' BASKETBALL TEAMS WON'T MEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Rob Fernas 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the great injustices of the prep basketball season, at least from a 
fan's standpoint, is that the powerful girls' teams from Morningside and Palos 
Verdes will not meet. 
</P>
<P>
Because they play in different leagues and are classified in different CIF 
playoff divisions, there is no chance that the two best girls' teams in the 
South Bay can settle the question of "Who's No. 1?" 
</P>
<P>
Instead, both teams are making a mockery of their respective leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside, the top-rated Division I team in California, improved to 17-1 
overall and 7-0 in the Ocean League this week with lopsided wins over South 
Torrance, 106-29, and Centennial, 90-32. 
</P>
<P>
But the scores don't tell the whole story. 
</P>
<P>
In Wednesday's game with South, Morningside Coach Frank Scott made senior guard 
Jo Jo Witherspoon the DS (designated scorer) in an attempt to break the school 
single-game record. Witherspoon easily set the record with 69 points, scoring 
49 by half-time and sitting out most of the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Scott said afterward that he is going to let junior center Lisa Leslie set the 
record next year. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes, meanwhile, twice managed to break the school record for most 
points scored in a game. 
</P>
<P>
The Sea Kings, ranked No. 1 in the Southern Section 4-A Division, first set the 
mark Thursday in a 102-17 win over Beverly Hills, then eclipsed it Friday night 
with a 107-22 whipping of rival Rolling Hills. Those games came on the heels of 
Tuesday's 71-27 romp over Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes' three-game total score this week: 280-66. 
</P>
<P>
As usual, 6-4 twins Heidi and Heather Burge did most of the damage for the Sea 
Kings. Heidi averaged 31.7 points over the three games, and Heather, coming 
back after missing three games because of illness, scored 33 against Beverly 
Hills and 20 against Rolling Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes is 15-3 overall and 7-0 in league play. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Morningside and Palos Verdes did have a chance to meet earlier this 
season. Both were entered in the Santa Barbara Tournament, but Palos Verdes 
lost in the semifinals to Southern High of Louisville, Ky., and Morningside 
lost to Southern in the final. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Morningside nor Palos Verdes has lost to a team from California. 
</P>
<P>
With its two Ocean League victories this week, Morningside's girls extended 
their league winning streak to 65 games, good for fourth place on the all-time 
Southern Section list. 
</P>
<P>
With two more wins next week against North Torrance and Redondo, the Lady 
Monarchs will tie Bishop Diego for third place. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside Poly holds the record with 97 consecutive league wins from 1978-85 
during the era of Cheryl Miller, followed by San Gabriel with 80 from 1979-86. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside's streak started in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Boys' basketball teams in the Bay, Ocean and Camino Real leagues have some 
chasing to do at the halfway point of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills (Bay), Morningside (Ocean) and St. Bernard (Camino Real) have 
each opened up two-game leads heading into the second round of league play. 
</P>
<P>
Can they be caught? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if anyone can catch (Rolling Hills) or not, but I think it will 
be a great game with Inglewood and a great game at our place," Torrance Coach 
Carl Strong said Thursday night, after his team suffered an 85-76 loss at 
Rolling Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The first-place Titans benefited from a favorable schedule in the first round 
of Bay League play, facing three of the top challengers -- Beverly Hills, 
Inglewood and Torrance -- at home. Rolling Hills now has to play those teams on 
the road. 
</P>
<P>
"We had all the advantages in the first round," said Rolling Hills Coach Cliff 
Warren. "The second round will be completely different. Our players know they 
have to improve." 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills leads the league with a 7-0 mark, followed by Torrance and 
Inglewood (both 5-2) and then Beverly Hills and Leuzinger (both 4-3). 
</P>
<P>
Leuzinger might be the team to watch in the second round. After starting out 
0-3, the young Olympians have won four straight. 
</P>
<P>
In the Ocean League, Morningside appears headed for its fifth league title in 
the last six years after completing the first round with a 7-0 record. 
</P>
<P>
The Monarchs are in an advantagious position, playing host to second-place 
Redondo (6-1) and third-place Centennial (5-2) in the second round after easily 
beating those teams on the road. 
</P>
<P>
St. Bernard, led by the inspired play of 6-11 center Ed Stokes, appears in good 
shape in the Camino Real League with a 6-0 mark and a two-game bulge over St. 
Monica and St. Anthony (both 4-2). Moreover, St. Bernard will play host to St. 
Monica, which gave the Vikings their toughest first-round game. 
</P>
<P>
Westchester ventures into the thick of the Metro League basketball race this 
week, playing host to Fairfax on Wednesday and then traveling to meet unbeaten 
Manual Arts on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Westchester (12-3 overall) and Manual Arts are each 5-0 in the Coastal 
Conference, with Fairfax trailing by two games at 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
Zan Mason, a 6-7 forward headed to UCLA, led four Westchester players in double 
figures Friday with 27 points as the Comets beat Palisades, 84-65. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne's track team won two relays and got a look at the team that might 
present the stiffest challenge to its quest for a third straight state title 
Friday night at the Sunkist Invitational indoor meet at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne's mile relay team of junior Chris Alexander, sophomore Eric Allen and 
seniors Kevin Gatlin and Curtis Conway won with a time of 3 minutes, 24.7 
seconds, barely edging out Oakland (3:24.8), which proved it will have to be 
reckoned with in June. 
</P>
<P>
A good start by Alexander and a strong anchor leg by Conway, the Cougars' top 
sprinter, made the difference. However, the squad did not live up to the 
expectations of Coach Kye Courtney, who had hoped for a 3:15 time. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne also won the 8x160 relay in 2:14.3, but the Cougars missed a chance 
for another victory when Conway scratched from the 60-yard dash for football 
players because he had not recovered from the mile relay. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougar girls won the 4x160 relay in 1:14.9 and were runners-up in both the 
2-mile (10:08.8) and mile (4:05.5) relays. Individually, Kesha Marvin of 
Hawthorne took third in the 500 (1:09.9) and teammate Rhonda Kennerson was 
second in the 880 (2:19.4). 
</P>
<P>
Carson and Banning have played some memorable basketball games in the past, but 
Friday night's Pacific League meeting was no contest. 
</P>
<P>
Led by 16 points from forward Vince Washington and 15 from guard Raymond 
Bennett, Carson ran away from its rival, 75-56, at home. The decision left 
Carson with a 9-7 overall mark and 2-2 Southern-Pacific Conference record, 
while Banning slipped to 8-10 and 1-4.

LOYOLA WOMEN IN TIE FOR 1ST, BEAT PORTLAND, 66-55 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Loyola Marymount women's basketball team maintained a tie for first place 
in the West Coast Athletic Conference with a 66-55 victory Saturday over 
Portland at Gersten Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions improved to 3-1 in the conference and 11-7 overall. Portland fell to 
3-13, 1-3 in the WCAC. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola led 35-31 at the half and pulled away in the second half, building leads 
that reached 64-48. Guards Lynn Flanagan and Kristen Bruich scored 17 and 14 
points to lead the Lion attack. 
</P>
<P>
Flanagan hit 7 of 11 shots, and Bruich added 10 assists. Portland shot 50% in 
the first half, but the Lions held them to 8 of 27 shooting (29.6%) after 
halftime. Loyola shot 41% for the game and hit 14 of 20 from the foul line. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions swept the weekend series, knocking off league leader Gonzaga 67-62 in 
overtime Friday to move into a tie for first place.

Syrian Defense Minister Mustafa Talas alleged that Israel duped an American 
soldier into carrying the bomb that blew up a Pan Am jetliner over Scotland on 
Dec. 21, killing 270 people. "An agent of Israeli intelligence, Mossad, handed 
him the bomb-laden bag to carry in return for $300,000, claiming it was 
diamonds worth $500,000 needed to be smuggled into the United States," Talas 
said in an interview published in Kuwait's daily Al-Qabas. British 
investigators determined the plane was destroyed by a bomb placed in the 
luggage hold, but they have not said who was responsible. In Israel, a Foreign 
Ministry spokesman called Talas' allegation "ridiculous and malicious."

PARTY OUSTS GRENADA CHIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prime Minister Herbert Blaize was ousted as leader of Grenada's ruling New 
National Party during a party convention vote and replaced by his longtime 
critic, Keith Mitchell, the minister of communications and works. The election 
of Mitchell means he will be the prime minister of the Caribbean island nation 
if the centrist party wins in elections due by December. Mitchell, 43, has 
regularly criticized Blaize for making major decisions without consulting his 
Cabinet. Blaize's ouster as party leader -- a position he has held since 1960 
-- was apparently due to a drop in popularity and ill health. The 71-year-old 
Blaize, who became prime minister in 1984, has prostate cancer.

MIAMI VICTIM'S FAMILY ASKS FOR CALM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

As his family made televised appeals for calm, blacks gathered to bury one of 
two men killed in an incident that sparked race riots in the Miami area. Police 
meanwhile said many of those arrested in the uprising would be kept behind bars 
until after today's Super Bowl. About 150 people entered the Cathedral of St. 
Mary for the funeral of Allen Blanchard, a passenger on a motorcycle whose 
driver was shot last Monday in the Overtown neighborhood by a Latino police 
officer. Police were chasing the motorcycle for a traffic violation. Blanchard, 
24, died of injuries suffered when the motorcycle crashed. Driver Clement 
Lloyd, 23, who was killed by a shot to the head, will be buried Monday. Riots 
touched off by the shooting left one man dead, and 11 others were treated for 
gunshot wounds. Thirteen buildings were torched and others looted in two black 
neighborhoods, and 372 people were arrested.

Chefs found themselves without dinner guests when a fund-raising event for a 
Washington shelter for the homeless was canceled because of last-minute 
contract problems. So they decided to cook for the homeless instead. Although 
the shelter's regular meals are "very nice," said Mitch Snyder, an activist for 
the homeless, "we don't serve clams or crab. People around here got all perky 
about that." Some of the invited guests reserved judgment until after the meal. 
"It'll probably be all right," said Ronnell Showell, 29. A for-profit group had 
planned to donate at least $150,000 of its proceeds from the event to the 
shelter, a spokeswoman said. After it was canceled, the chefs "decided we were 
here to help the hungry and homeless, so why don't we?" said John P. Hughes 
III, owner and chef of Windows on the Water in Kennebunkport, Me., where the 
Bushes have dined. Chef Daniel Thiebaut of the Mauna Kea Beach Resort in Hawaii 
got his company to donate lamb, fruit and special colored, chocolate-covered 
macadamia nuts. The crab meat came from two restaurants in Mobile, Ala. 
"Hopefully, they'll have a memorable meal and they'll realize they ate as well 
as some of the fat cats," chef John Weichman said.

 -- A 7-year-old boy appointed to the Berkeley Youth Commission after he worked 
for the reelection of a councilman proposed an attack on poverty when he 
attended his first meeting. Edward Andrews, who looked bored at times, sat 
through an hour of plodding discussion on topics such as student motivation and 
high school assemblies. But then the boy, known as Teddy, rose and said: "I 
propose we join together to help the poor and homeless children." His 
suggestions included soliciting contributions from UC Berkeley and the city 
Police Department; helping "children in need" get haircuts, and collecting 
books, toys and clothing for homeless children. He said he has found two 
bookstores willing to donate books and persuaded several establishments to 
donate haircuts. The rest of the Youth Commission endorsed his proposals.

 -- Rock star Ted Nugent, 40, married Shemane Deziel, 26, on a casino showroom 
stage in Reno, with actor Kurt Russell as a groomsman. It is the second 
marriage for both. Nugent met his new wife in October at a Detroit radio 
station, where he was a guest host and she was a traffic reporter at the time. 
The bridegroom wore black jeans and a casual coat, but the bride was dressed in 
a more traditional white gown. Nugent said they will spend their honeymoon 
hunting in Texas and will live in central Michigan. DAVE JOHNSON

200 ABORTION FOES ARRESTED 
</P>

<TEXT>

About 200 people were arrested at an anti-abortion demonstration in Northern 
California marking the 16th anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court decision 
legalizing abortion. Hundreds of other anti-abortion activists staged peaceful 
rallies in Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties. The arrests wewre made when 
a crowd of about 400 protesters in Sunnyvale attempted to block entry to a 
family planning clinic, police said. The demonstration, held by Bay Area 
Rescue, a local coalition of anti-abortion groups, also drew about 150 
supporters of Roe vs. Wade, the landmark 1973 Supreme Court decision.

RECALL ISSUED FOR ICE CREAM

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Stater Brothers market chain recalled some of its house-brand ice cream 
because of possible exposure to ammonia from a refrigerant leak during 
manufacture. Staters spokesman Tom Reingrover said the half-gallon packages 
affected contain golden vanilla and chocolate ice cream and are marked with the 
code number 092289. "It's strictly a precautionary thing," he said. "We found 
very little product affected." Reingrover said it was not immediately 
determined which of the chain's 101 markets in Southern California received the 
ice cream.

Newfoundland Premier A. Brian Peckford plans to step down after 10 years of 
governing Canada's poorest province. The fiery provincial leader announced his 
resignation, which will take effect at the end of March, at a meeting of 
Progressive Conservative party leaders. A date for a leadership convention will 
be decided by Monday, party officials said. International Trade Minister John 
Crosbie, a Newfoundlander who helped shepherd through Parliament a free trade 
pact with the United States, is believed interested in succeeding Peckford.

Soviet activist Andrei D. Sakharov, citing recent arrests in Armenia, said 
repression has resumed in the Soviet Union, according to an interview in U.S. 
News &amp; World Report. He objected to the arrest of 12 members of the 
Karabakh Committee, a dissident group in Armenia, in December and earlier this 
month. "These arrests were absolutely unnecessary," Sakharov said. "The 
committee had been providing invaluable aid and assistance" following the Dec. 
7 earthquake in Armenia. He said the arrests have led to a "return of prisoners 
of conscience" in the Soviet Union. As result, he said, plans for a human 
rights conference to be held in Moscow in 1991 should be suspended.

LONG WAIT ENDS FOR MATSUBARA IN CSUN WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN LUIS OBISPO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Darren Matsubara had waited a long time. 
</P>
<P>
Two and a half years to be exact. 
</P>
<P>
That's how long he had lingered on the sidelines before becoming eligible to 
play basketball for Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
But the 6-1 senior took center stage on Saturday night as the Matadors rallied 
for a 72-63 victory and their first win at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Matsubara scored a season-high 27 points at a very opportune time for CSUN, 
which was coming off a blowout loss at Cal State Bakersfield on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been waiting for this," Matsubara said after helping the Matadors run 
their record to 11-5 overall, 2-1 in California Collegiate Athletic Assn. play. 
"The wait was worth it, no doubt." 
</P>
<P>
Matsubara, whose ineligibility was prolonged by a complicated transfer from 
Hawaii Pacific, made 9 of 13 field-goal attempts and 7 of 9 free throws. And on 
the occasions he penetrated and didn't shoot, he created high-percentage 
opportunities for his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been watching myself on tape a lot," Matsubara said. 
</P>
<P>
And what had he seen? 
</P>
<P>
"I was doing a lot of passing around the outside, not doing much of anything." 
</P>
<P>
And what had he used during Saturday's game, teammate Kris Brodowski inquired 
in the locker room afterward? 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, yeah, Kris's body glove," Matsubara said. 
</P>
<P>
"No," Brodowski said. "You used common sense." 
</P>
<P>
Said Matsubara: "I'm still going to wear that body glove every game from now 
on." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever Matsubara used best, it helped stop a San Luis Obispo team that had 
been on a roll. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs (10-5, 2-1) had won 7 of their past 8 games and had not lost a 
conference game at home since the 1986-87 season. 
</P>
<P>
San Luis Obispo led, 56-52, with 6 minutes left when CSUN mounted its decisive 
rally. 
</P>
<P>
Matsubara made a 3-point shot to cut the Mustang lead to 1 and after CSUN 
forced San Luis Obispo into a 10-second backcourt violation, Karl Becker 
swished a 10-footer from the baseline to give the Matadors the lead for good, 
57-56. 
</P>
<P>
The suspense wasn't over, however. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge was clinging to a 3-point lead with a little more than a minute 
remaining and only a few ticks left on the 45-second clock when Matsubara 
converted a jump shot to give the Matadors a 66-61 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The elation of CSUN and its guard-of-the-night was temporary. Only 11 seconds 
after hitting perhaps the key shot of the game, Matsubara was gone. He was 
called for his fifth foul while trying to strip the ball away from the 
Mustangs' Coby Naess. 
</P>
<P>
But Jemarl Baker and Derrick Gathers each made 2 free throws and Todd Bowser 
added a short jump shot down the stretch as the Matadors held off San Luis 
Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
It was a somewhat ironic finish because Gathers and Bowser, CSUN's top two 
scorers, combined for only 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers, who came in averaging 18.5 points a game, made 3 of 15 field-goal 
attempts. He made up for an off-night shooting in other departments, however. 
He led all rebounders with 12 and added 4 steals. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers acknowledged afterward that, in this case anyway, a bad shooting night 
was for the best.

LESS-THAN-IMPROVED LIE USED TO SPURN SENIORS TOURNAMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Golfers can sometimes appear to be a quirky lot. Note the clothes, which make 
them look like a Rose Parade float. 
</P>
<P>
One would think, however, that even guys who wear paisley pants would jump at 
the chance to watch Arnold Palmer play golf on their home course, to see the 
legend putting on their greens, blasting out of their traps. 
</P>
<P>
Not so, according to news reports earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
The GTE Seniors Golf Classic, held at Wood Ranch Golf Club for the past 2 
years, had pulled out of the Simi Valley course because the golfers -- 
including Palmer, Gary Player, Chi Chi Rodriguez, Billy Casper and many others 
-- had grown a bit weary of having their eyebrows torn from their foreheads by 
the shrieking winds that often rake the course. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsors sought another Valley-area course to showcase some of the greatest 
names in golf. They talked about making a 2-year deal with a country club and 
bringing Jack Nicklaus into the tournament in 1990, when he joins the senior 
tour. 
</P>
<P>
They settled on 2 courses: North Ranch Country Club in Thousand Oaks and 
Lakeside Country Club in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
And both courses promptly told tournament organizers to take a hike. 
</P>
<P>
The members, tournament officials were told, didn't want it. 
</P>
<P>
"Our members just didn't want the pros tying up their golf course for a week," 
North Ranch General Manager Tom Carroll said last week. 
</P>
<P>
They didn't want Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player tying up their golf course for a 
week? They didn't want Arnold Palmer playing their course? 
</P>
<P>
Is this a country club or the Western Schmo Convention? 
</P>
<P>
Does it seem that if these folks were house painters they would have ordered 
Michelangelo to get that garbage off the ceiling? 
</P>
<P>
"We looked like jerks," said North Ranch member Rudy Commans, father of pro 
golfer Ron Commans. "I never felt like more of a jerk in my life." 
</P>
<P>
Commans and many other North Ranch members are in a frenzy because the 
directors of the club announced that the tournament was turned away because of 
a membership vote. 
</P>
<P>
There was no vote. 
</P>
<P>
There was no discussion with the members. 
</P>
<P>
Yet an event that attracted upward of 50,000 spectators each of the past 2 
years apparently will no longer be held in the Valley area. The tournament may 
end up at Sandpiper Country Club in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
At each country club, one man or a handful of men made the decision to tell 
Palmer, Player, Rodriguez and perhaps Nicklaus that they were as welcome at 
North Ranch and Lakeside as a man pounding brass cymbals together on the green. 
</P>
<P>
At North Ranch, more than 40 golfing members were asked this week if their 
opinions on hosting the senior event had been sought. 
</P>
<P>
All said no. 
</P>
<P>
All said they did not know any member of the club who was polled. 
</P>
<P>
"We would have loved to have had the tournament," Commans said. "Absolutely 
loved it. Arnold Palmer playing on our course? How can you ask for a bigger 
thrill? Everyone I know would have jumped at the chance. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't want Arnold Palmer tying up our golf course for a week? Damn, that 
makes me mad." 
</P>
<P>
Even the opinion of Bill Finn, the club's director of golf tournaments and 
social events, was not sought by the board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
"Having the seniors play on our course would have been not just a pleasure, but 
an honor," Finn said. "A great honor. These are the guys who made golf. And 
now, we just look like jerks." 
</P>
<P>
At Lakeside, dozens of members also said that they had not been asked by the 
club's directors about hosting the seniors tournament. Six of those interviewed 
did not even know that their club had rejected the event. 
</P>
<P>
Lakeside manager Ali Dargahi said that inquiries on the subject would have to 
be made in writing. He told a reporter an answer to any questions might take 
several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no idea what happened," he said. "You'll have to write to the golf 
committee. There is no one here. I can't help you. I am waiting for a phone 
call. Goodby." 
</P>
<P>
Which is roughly what Lakeside told Arnold Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
At North Ranch, chairman of the board Bill Cleary was the culprit in the eyes 
of some members. 
</P>
<P>
"If you took a poll, at least 80 percent of our members would be in favor of 
having the tournament," North Ranch member Duane Carter said. "And that's a 
conservative estimate. The other night we had dinner with about 30 people and 
every single one of them was strongly in favor of it. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all mad about this. Bill Cleary could have at least asked us. He never 
asked anyone." 
</P>
<P>
Cleary, who was preparing for a round of golf, spoke with a reporter on the 
condition that most of what he said was off the record. On the record, he said 
that the members weren't asked their opinion because there wasn't enough time. 
Tournament sponsors, he said, demanded an answer in 2 days. 
</P>
<P>
"It was unfortunate," Cleary said. "But the board of directors did what was 
best for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
Dick MacLean, who headed the Valley search for a new tournament site, 
reaffirmed that he was told North Ranch's rejection was a members' decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I was told that NCAA championships were held there last year and that the 
members simply said they weren't interested in having their course taken over 
for another week," MacLean said. 
</P>
<P>
Cleary, after a lengthy off-the-record response to a series of questions, said 
that he was aware of the reaction among the members. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had some negative feedback," he said. "Some members are dissatisfied, 
but just a few vocal dissidents." 
</P>
<P>
A moment later, Cleary stepped to the first tee and uncorked a drive. His swing 
was a bit unorthodox. The ball sailed a bit to the left and did not travel very 
far. 
</P>
<P>
But Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus will never hit a better drive off the first 
tee at North Ranch.

NOTRE DAME ALONE IN FIRST AFTER VICTORY OVER BELL-JEFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
It began like a horse race, evolved into a prize fight and ended with Notre 
Dame High hitting the jackpot. 
</P>
<P>
The Knights held all the winning numbers Saturday night, and the prize was sole 
possession of first place in the San Fernando Valley League as Notre Dame 
rolled over Bell-Jeff, 87-71, before a jam-packed Bell-Jeff gym. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Hicks and Brian Jones -- take your Division I pick -- dominated the 
showdown, scoring 35 and 31 points, respectively, while conducting a 
3-point-shot seminar. 
</P>
<P>
Hicks, on his way to Stanford next season, made 4 of 10 3-point shots while 
Jones, who has drawn interest from Baylor, Pepperdine and Texas El Paso, made 5 
of 8. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame (10-8, 4-0 in league play) made 31 of 55 shots overall (56%), 
including a sizzling 10 of 11 in the final period. 
</P>
<P>
"This game, I'd say definitely, I was pumped," Hicks said. 
</P>
<P>
Bell-Jeff, meanwhile, was deflated. The Guards (15-2, 3-1), who entered the 
game with 4 players averaging in double figures, kept 3-point pace in a quick 
first quarter, taking a 21-20 lead at the break. 
</P>
<P>
But before the game's final buzzer, 3 of the 4 -- Nick Sanderson (24 points, 4 
3-point baskets), Chris Dyer (17 points) and Ray Witt (8 points) -- had fouled 
out, and the fourth, Joe Dunn (14 points), was teetering with his fourth foul. 
</P>
<P>
The game also featured a brawl that resulted in the ejection of 2 players and a 
Notre Dame fan. 
</P>
<P>
Things became so chaotic at one point that an official inquired at the scorers' 
table if there were any police present. 
</P>
<P>
"The cheap shots," a disgusted Notre Dame Coach Mick Cady said, "the people 
don't come out here to see that. Really, you want to play good, hard 
basketball. All this bush-league stuff is on the side." 
</P>
<P>
With 2:51 remaining in the third quarter, Notre Dame's Pico Sandoval and 
Bell-Jeff's Matt Corse were ejected after coming to blows during a stoppage in 
play. 
</P>
<P>
Tempers had already flared under both baskets and tempers continued to heat up 
even after the skirmish, which drew a fan from the stands and created a 
15-minute delay. 
</P>
<P>
"Corse is our best defensive player," said Bell-Jeff Coach Joe Dunn, who 
conducted a 30-minute, closed-door team meeting after the game. "If he was 
guarding me and in my face all the time, I'd be angry, too. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost more than they did." 
</P>
<P>
Hicks set the first-half tempo with a 3-point swish before the game was 5 
seconds old. 
</P>
<P>
Hicks hit another 3-point shot and Jones and Mike Rimkunas each connected from 
long distance. But Bell-Jeff answered with 3 3-pointers from Sanderson to take 
an early second-quarter lead. 
</P>
<P>
Sanderson's first 3 baskets were 3-point shots, including a cruise missile from 
well behind the perimeter line at the top of the key. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame continued the long-distance shooting in the second half, parlaying a 
16-4 run into a 46-35 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Hicks made 2 more 3-point shots and scored 10 points, and Jones, hitting from 
everywhere, scored 11 points in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Bell-Jeff never came closer than 63-57 with 6:42 remaining in the third 
quarter. Hicks scored 15 and Jones 13 in the second half. The pair also teamed 
for a Jones-breakaway-hit-Hicks-the-trailer-for-a-monster-jam that iced the 
game, 81-65, with 2 minutes to play.

REDSHIRT LOGAN PRAGMATIC IN DECISION NOT TO BOYCOTT 
</P>

Kevin Logan hopes that when he returns to his San Jose State dorm tonight, his 
estranged teammates can sympathize. Like an employee who crossed the picket 
line during a strike, Logan is banking on a little understanding. 
</P>
<P>
He is not necessarily expecting it. 
</P>
<P>
"I just hope it can be normal again," Logan said. "I have no bad feelings 
toward them, and I hope they have none toward me. It was their choice -- and 
they chose their consequences." 
</P>
<P>
Logan, a 1988 graduate of Westlake High, was 1 of 4 players on the San Jose 
State basketball team who decided not to participate in a player walkout last 
week. Ten of Logan's teammates, citing what they said was the increasingly 
abrasive behavior of Coach Bill Berry, announced a boycott of all future games 
unless Berry is removed from his duties as coach. 
</P>
<P>
Logan and 3 teammates, including roommates Dwain Daniels and Tom Desiano -- 
both juniors -- pulled an about-face Tuesday after a meeting with Berry in 
which the walkout was announced. The full roster of 14 players had entered a 
verbal agreement to stick together, Logan said, but after some soul searching, 
the 6-foot, 6 1/2-inch freshman decided to remain with the team. San Jose 
State, using several players from the school's football team, fell to Cal State 
Fullerton, 82-60, Friday, its sixth consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
Logan says he believes that the boycotting players are standing on firm ground 
regarding Berry's gruff behavior and that he agrees in principle with the 
grievances of the 10 who left. It was their method of protest -- walking away 
for the rest of the season -- he said, that was unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
"Their complaints are true," Logan said. "I think they've just blown it out of 
proportion." 
</P>
<P>
Said Dave Logan, Kevin's father: "What (the 10 who left) are saying definitely 
has merit. The way they went about changing things was foolish, though. If they 
had gone through the proper channels, they wouldn't have destroyed themselves. 
They wouldn't have destroyed the coach." 
</P>
<P>
Logan was redshirting and agreed that Berry probably didn't demand as much from 
him in practice as from other players. "I probably wasn't quite as pressured," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Logan added, however, that Berry's practices often became unbearable for 
many players. Sean Davis, a sophomore and a 1987 graduate of El Camino Real 
High, said Friday that he was "even scared about shooting and scared to dribble 
the ball." Damon Greer, a freshman point guard from Cleveland High who also 
joined the walkout, said that the team's "confidence is totally shot." 
</P>
<P>
Logan said he reasoned that Berry's behavior was like that of most coaches and 
that sticking with the program through the lean times was all part of 
fulfilling his obligations as a student on athletic scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
"He's my first college coach," Logan said. "I pretty much thought, 'This is the 
way it is,' since I had nothing to compare him to. It got pretty bad at times, 
but I accepted it as part of being a college basketball player." 
</P>
<P>
Logan said that other players were simply unable to put Berry's criticism 
aside. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's just his way of coaching," he said. "When he'd scream at me, I'd 
think about what he said, what he wanted from me. But I wouldn't carry it 
around with me. It's the only way to deal with that kind of criticism." 
</P>
<P>
Logan said no single incident triggered the walkout and that he believes player 
frustration is probably the motive for the boycott. San Jose State is 5-12 and 
1-7 in Big West Conference play. 
</P>
<P>
"The big thing is that we were just losing," Logan said. "Everyone was upset 
and depressed. If we'd been 15-2, you can bet this never would have happened." 
</P>
<P>
Logan said that Daniels and Desiano decided to remain in the program because 
they felt interest from other Division I schools would be nonexistent if they 
tried to transfer since they each have only 1 year of eligibility remaining. 
Logan said senior center-forward Jan Svoboda, a Glendale High graduate and the 
only starter to remain with the team, told Logan that he decided to stay 
because he wanted to finish his schoolwork and complete his senior season. 
</P>
<P>
The 5 seniors who left the team will have no eligibility remaining unless they 
return, National Collegiate Athletic Assn. representative Rick Evrard said 
Friday. Evrard added that the magnitude of the boycott may be unmatched. 
</P>
<P>
"Collectively, I've never seen or heard of a walkout similar to this," said 
Evrard, a director of legislative services. "Individually it happens all the 
time, but not at this scale." 
</P>
<P>
Evrard said that players with eligibility remaining may transfer to another 
school and sit out a season to satisfy the NCAA residency requirement, then 
resume playing. If San Jose State chooses to revoke the scholarships of the 
boycotting players, it may not refill the scholarships until next season, 
Evrard said. 
</P>
<P>
"They're non-transferable," Evrard said. "They'll have to play with whoever 
they can find." 
</P>
<P>
The boycotting players have hired the firm of San Francisco lawyer Melvin Belli 
to represent them. Anassociate of Belli said Friday that the players will sue 
if their scholarships are revoked. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Logan said that Berry and school athletic department officials indicated 
after the Fullerton game Friday that the scholarships of the boycotting players 
will be rescinded, perhaps before Thursday when the spring semester begins. 
</P>
<P>
"They said the only guys they were even slightly interested in keeping were 
Greer and David Hollaway," Dave Logan said. "The other guys are history. They 
said they don't want them around anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Logan said he believes that the walkout stemmed from Berry's inability to 
coach players without using critical and disparaging remarks and that Berry's 
old-school philosophy was difficult for players to relate to. The boycotting 
players equated Berry's coaching style to "mental cruelty" and said that 
previous complaints to school administrators were ignored. 
</P>
<P>
"I really feel sorry for Berry," the elder Logan said. "He has the best 
interests of the kids at heart. In his own way he gives a lot, but the kids 
don't see it. 
</P>
<P>
"I think if he had a little better sense of humor, he might have gotten over 
the hump." 
</P>
<P>
Berry, in his 10th season, will remain as coach for the rest of the season, 
athletic department officials said last week. 
</P>
<P>
The elder Logan, who before the walkout last week advised his son to "go along 
with whatever the rest of the team did," said he nonetheless supports Kevin's 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have meant wasting a year of eligibility," Dave Logan said. "It has 
become a meaningless season." 
</P>
<P>
Logan and his father met with Berry after the Fullerton game and decided that 
Kevin, who did not play in the Fullerton game, will continue to redshirt.

CITY TO MIRROR MAJOR LEAGUES IN SCHEDULE FORMAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City Section baseball teams have photocopied a page from the Major League 
schedule and revised the order in which teams face each other as part of the 
City's sweeping releaguing proposal that went into effect this school year. 
</P>
<P>
The playoff structure also has been altered under the new format, which was 
adopted last fall on a 1-year trial basis by administrators acting on the 
advice of a panel of area coaches. 
</P>
<P>
In a conference containing 2 four-team leagues, for example, teams will face 
league opponents 3 times and conference opponents twice in a 17-game league 
schedule. Teams will play regular-season games on Tuesdays and Thursdays. 
</P>
<P>
"We looked at the Major Leagues," San Fernando Coach Steve Marden said. "A team 
in the Western Division will play other teams in the division 18 times and 
teams from the Eastern Division 12 times. We were looking for that same 3-to-2 
ratio." 
</P>
<P>
Under the new plan, teams will face each other 2 times in the same week on a 
home-and-away basis. 
</P>
<P>
"Now a guy with one great pitcher can't ride him all the way through the 
schedule," said Grant Coach Tom Lucero, who admittedly used right-hander Rodney 
Beck at every crucial juncture of Grant's drive to the 1986 4-A title. "We'll 
see everything a team has to offer by playing twice in a week. No more one-man 
teams." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, league foes will face each other for the first 6 games, beginning 
in mid-March. Teams will then play conference opponents for the next 8 games 
and conclude the regular season with single games against their 3 league rivals 
-- for a total of 17 games. 
</P>
<P>
The playoffs also have been restructured. Sixteen teams will qualify, including 
automatic berths for first- and second-place teams from each of the 6 4-A 
leagues. Two additional teams -- those with the best record from among the 6 
third-place finishers -- also automatically qualify. The remaining 4 
third-place teams will play in wild-card games to determine the final 2 playoff 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
"That way, a team doesn't get penalized if it happens to be in a very strong 
league," Marden said. "Even if they face some of the best teams all year long, 
they can still qualify." 
</P>
<P>
Last season Monroe, playing in the highly competitive Mid-Valley League, had to 
win a fourth-place league tiebreaker game against Birmingham to make the 
playoffs. The Vikings eventually won the City 4-A title, defeating league rival 
San Fernando in the final at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, teams will play on consecutive days in the weeks preceding and 
following spring break. Teams will play Tuesday and Wednesday before the 
vacation and Wednesday and Thursday after the break. In the past, only 1 game 
had been scheduled in each of those weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Rainout games, which under the previous format had always been scheduled for 
replay on Monday, will be made up on the next available day, Marden said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Two dry spells, one in each half, choked the University of San Diego men's 
basketball team and led to a 64-58 West Coast Athletic Conference loss to Santa 
Clara Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Toreros fell to 5-11 with their fourth loss in four conference games. 
</P>
<P>
The first drought came in the first half, beginning with 6:30 left. USD was 
leading, 19-16, but Santa Clara scored nine consecutive points and went on to 
take a 27-24 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
With 15:06 to play, USD again went cold. Ahead, 34-32, the Toreros allowed 
Santa Clara to score 10 consecutive points. Melvin Chinn's 3-pointer put Santa 
Clara ahead, 42-34. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara eventually increased its second-half lead to 13 points, and USD 
couldn't come all the way back. Down, 53-40, with 6:18 to play, the Toreros 
made their final run and closed to within 60-58 on Danny Means' 3-point jumper 
with 10 seconds to play. But four Santa Clara free throws put the game away. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a young and struggling team," USD Coach Hank Egan said. "We're on a 
death struggle every time out, and that is what we have to understand. We 
played hard tonight and hung in there, and hopefully that will help us when we 
get home. We've got to continue to keep making progress." 
</P>
<P>
The Toreros outrebounded Santa Clara, 40-21, but turned the ball over 26 times 
to Santa Clara's 10.

IT'S STILL A ZUNGUL OUT THERE; 
</P>
<P>
'LORD OF ALL INDOORS' CONTINUES TO MAKE HIS POINTS WITH SOCKERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When the little boy inside 34-year-old Steve Zungul gets loose, anything can 
happen. 
</P>
<P>
He can be as wild as the thinning, disorganized hair on his head. Or he can 
whine like a youngster whose parents haven't allowed him to go out and play. 
</P>
<P>
Mostly, though, he can be as beautiful as a smiling 7-year-old when he's 
controlling or shooting a soccer ball. 
</P>
<P>
With Steve Zungul, you get the entire package. 
</P>
<P>
You want a guy who has scored more goals and more points that any player in 
Major Indoor Soccer League history? A player voted the greatest of the league's 
first decade? 
</P>
<P>
OK. You've got him. But when he arrives, you had be better be ready to share 
your director's chair with him . . . or to paint the star on his dressing room 
door a little bigger if he asks. 
</P>
<P>
"More than just a few people have called Steve selfish and egotistical," former 
New York Arrows goalkeeper Shep Messing once said. 
</P>
<P>
They've also called him "The Lord of All Indoors." 
</P>
<P>
Turns out, that doesn't just mean on a soccer field. When he was younger, 
Zungul's indoor exploits took him to more than a disco or two. 
</P>
<P>
He missed curfew as often as he scored goals, and he disobeyed coaches as 
frequently as the class clown disobeys the teacher. 
</P>
<P>
Said Messing, relating a story of his first meeting with Zungul in New York: 
"Do you know what his first words to me were? 'Show me Studio 54.' " 
</P>
<P>
Zungul laughed: "That was all when I was younger. Now, I can't do that 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
But that kid is still in there. 
</P>
<P>
So is the soccer player. Zungul isn't ready to put either to rest. Like almost 
anyone else who has seen him play, Zungul remembers the accomplishments and 
accolades. 
</P>
<P>
Six times the league's Most Valuable Player. Eight times first-team All-MISL 
performer. Four times the playoff MVP. In all, there are 41 MISL records that 
Zungul either shares or holds. 
</P>
<P>
Zungul has tried to put it behind him, but he can't. Not yet, at least. 
</P>
<P>
That's why, before this season got under way, Zungul phoned the Sockers and 
asked to play. 
</P>
<P>
His last team, the Tacoma Stars, got fed up with Zungul's antics and wouldn't 
re-sign him. 
</P>
<P>
"When he first called us and said he wanted to play, we didn't think it was 
such a good idea," Socker Coach Ron Newman said. "But when said he'd play at 
any cost, we had to take a look at it." 
</P>
<P>
The cost issue certainly turned some heads. Here was the greatest player in the 
history of the indoor game saying he'd play for the minimum league salary of 
$24,000. 
</P>
<P>
Juli Veee, the former Socker, said Zungul was like a beggar, down on his knees 
hoping somebody would help him. 
</P>
<P>
Zungul said it was just his love for the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to come and finish my career here (in San Diego) where I have all my 
fans and the players I love to play with," Zungul said at the time. "The money 
is not the issue. I don't care about the money. I just care about playing." 
</P>
<P>
Because of Zungul's reputation, the Sockers didn't jump at him. Newman and 
Sockers' President Ron Cady went back and forth on the issue. One day, it 
seemed, they wanted Zungul. On another, they didn't. 
</P>
<P>
"We finally decided that if Stevie would come in and play for the minimum, it 
was just too good to pass up," Newman said. "It was like he came and replaced 
the 16th or 17th best player on our team." 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, the Sockers released 28-goal scorer Keder to make room. 
</P>
<P>
"The negative," Newman said, "is that maybe some youngster could have begun his 
career this year if Steve wasn't here. But if you had the chance to trade one 
of your lowest players for the greatest player the game has ever known, you'd 
have to be crazy not to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Ah, but when Zungul arrived, many still said the Sockers were crazy. 
</P>
<P>
So, who's crazy now? 
</P>
<P>
In his first 13 games with the Sockers, Zungul has scored 8 goals and added 5 
assists. Two of his goals were game-winners, and he even recorded the 98th 
hat-trick of his career in a victory over Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
It seems he hasn't performed badly. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything has gone along kind of like I expected," Zungul said. "I've been 
getting in better shape and playing with the team for a while now. I feel like 
I'm contributing pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
Ask Zungul if he's unhappy about anything, however, and the little kid is back. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, they need to give me more playing time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And one night, he threw a tantrum. The Sockers had cruised past Kansas City, 
5-1, and Newman had elected not to play his stars much in the fourth quarter 
when the game was in hand. 
</P>
<P>
Said Zungul: "That's when you can go out and have fun and entertain the fans. I 
wanted to be out there." 
</P>
<P>
Answered Newman: "The other players who don't get to play as much deserve to 
play, too. He just can't understand that." 
</P>
<P>
And so the relationship between Newman and Zungul continues to roll bumpily 
along. 
</P>
<P>
"He's always had trouble understanding the team concept of the game," Newman 
said. "He's always wanted to play offense and score goals. But a lot of times, 
it's the team that helps him score those goals, and he doesn't realize it." 
</P>
<P>
A lot of times, though, Zungul doesn't need a team. 
</P>
<P>
"He can be magic," said teammate Branko Segota, second to Zungul on the MISL 
all-time list for goals scored, 639-347. "If they let him play, he'll produce. 
He hasn't forgotten how to play the game, that's for sure." 
</P>
<P>
And Zungul hasn't forgotten his relationship with Segota. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1985 season, the two were torn apart when Bob Bell, then owner of 
the Sockers, was forced to sell Zungul to the Tacoma Stars for $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
Zungul scored 115 goals in 2 1/2 seasons for the Stars, but he was unable to 
lead them to a championship. And try as he might, he couldn't enjoy himself as 
much on the field without Segota. 
</P>
<P>
"He and I have just always worked so well together," Zungul said. "We always 
know what the other one is going 
</P>
<P>
to do. It's the greatest." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't that way when Zungul first arrived back in San Diego this season. 
</P>
<P>
Segota was hurt, still recovering from a pulled hamstring, and Zungul had to go 
it alone for a couple of games. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers lost 3 of 4, and Zungul really wasn't playing very well. 
</P>
<P>
But then Segota returned against Kansas City Dec. 17. Zungul got his hat trick, 
and the Sockers won, 8-6. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's been happier ever since," Segota said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Zungul: "Hey, I know there are a lot of younger guys now. I'm like a 
sunset going down. But I can still have some fun out there, and I know I can 
still score goals." 
</P>
<P>
Zungul then said that this would probably be his final season. 
</P>
<P>
Next year, the kid will have to find something else to do. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

VOY IS STILL A DOCTOR WITH A CAUSE;

<P>
USOC'S BELEAGERED DRUG CZAR FIGHTING A LOSING BATTLE

<TEXT>
<P>
He has been eluded by athletes who continue to flout the system, excluded by 
administrators who believe that he should hold his tongue, and deluded by his 
faith in a science that has failed to overcome the drug problem in sports. 
</P>
<P>
Five years after he became the U.S. Olympic Committee's chief medical officer, 
Dr. Robert Voy may soon hang up his beakers and return to private practice. 
</P>
<P>
And although no one doubts his commitment to the cause of eliminating 
performance-enhancing drugs from sports or his competency in the laboratory, 
the USOC's leadership seems to be evenly divided on whether the outspoken Voy 
should be encouraged to remain. 
</P>
<P>
Considering his opinions regarding the leadership, some of which emerged during 
an interview in his office last week at the USOC's headquarters here, he joked 
that a request for his resignation would represent a relatively light 
reprimand. 
</P>
<P>
"They would probably hang me if they knew my true feelings," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He consented to the interview only after it had been cleared with the USOC's 
executive director, Baaron Pittenger. Surrounded by memorabilia from his 
career, including two urine-sample vials mounted on a plaque, Voy, 55, appeared 
comfortable. But he stopped himself several times in mid-sentence to either 
rephrase a thought, making it less inflammatory, or to change the subject 
entirely. 
</P>
<P>
"You're going to have to forgive me if I couch a lot of what I'm going to say," 
he said. "I'm going to be perfectly up-front with you, but I am in a position 
in which I don't know what my longevity is within this organization. 
</P>
<P>
"In this kind of organization, you can't step on anybody's feet and expect to 
survive. Others have been in that position and have not survived. My personal 
conviction is that I don't mind either way. I intend to speak my piece, but I'd 
like to go out on the basis of resigning and not being fired." 
</P>
<P>
During the next 2 1/2 hours, Voy outlined his frustrations: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Although doctors have narrowed the gap, athletes who use anabolic steroids 
still have the lead. Instead of acting as a deterrent, increased testing has 
sent athletes in search of drugs that either are not on the banned list or that 
disappear quickly from the system. 
</P>
<P>
Even Ben Johnson's suspension had a reverse effect, serving as an advertisement 
to athletes that steroids can help create super athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Through lenient penalties, reported collusion between some officials and 
athletes and even malfeasance in some laboratories, the leadership at all 
levels of national and international sports has sent a message that it is not 
serious about combatting drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Because he has not been diplomatic when addressing imperfections in the 
system, he said that he was told last summer by USOC officials to tone down his 
comments. Since then, he said that he has felt like the odd man out in the 
USOC's drug-testing program, which he is supposed to oversee. 
</P>
<P>
For example, he said that he was not asked to join a USOC team that is 
negotiating a drug-testing agreement with the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"It puts me into a position where I'm not doing effective things," he said. 
"I'm doing the work, but my creativity, my innovation and my enthusiasm 
certainly aren't what they used to be." 
</P>
<P>
Voy's critics contend that his effectiveness waned earlier, when he lost the 
trust of many National Governing Bodies (NGBs), which are responsible for 
Olympic sports. 
</P>
<P>
That is most apparent in Voy's other responsibility, USOC research and 
development projects. He recently received the unkindest cut of all when his 
proposed budget for the next quadrennium in that area was slashed dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
Pittenger said that the NGBs believe the department has not produced, adding 
that Voy could have the funds restored if he does a better selling job. 
</P>
<P>
But whereas research and development may ultimately be more important to 
Olympic athletes, it is Voy's performance as the drug czar that stirred 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
In the most publicized incident, Ollan Cassell, executive director of The 
Athletics Congress (TAC), the national governing body for track and field, 
confronted Voy at a meeting of international sports leaders in Colorado Springs 
in October, 1987. A heated exchange, in full view of reporters, ensued. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the group, Voy had suggested that officials in some sports 
suppress results of positive drug tests to avoid negative publicity. At a 
subsequent news conference, Voy voiced his suspicions about two 1987 track 
meets, the World Championships in Rome and the U.S. national meet in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
Although cynicism about drug testing at major international track meets is 
common in the media, particularly in Europe, it was the first time that an 
official of Voy's stature had publicly admitted his doubts. But even one 
inclined to agree with him had to be disappointed that he either would not or 
could not present evidence to support his skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
Voy ran afoul of TAC again last summer, when he revealed during a media seminar 
in Colorado Springs that an unspecified number of track and field athletes had 
tested positive during the Olympic trials. Although Voy was not specific, the 
impression left with reporters was that the athletes had used anabolic 
steroids. That was reflected in the reporters' stories. 
</P>
<P>
A few days later, after much media speculation about a track scandal, the USOC 
announced that a number of athletes had tested positive for small amounts of 
stimulants, such as those found in common over-the-counter cold medications, 
and had been cleared in hearings because the use was ruled to be inadvertent. 
</P>
<P>
The press was criticized for reporting the initial story without more specifics 
but USOC officials ultimately blamed Voy. USOC President Robert Helmick said 
that Voy is not authorized to discuss the results of drug tests until after 
athletes have had hearings. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the same as a grand jury making an investigation," he said. "There has to 
be absolute secrecy until the process is complete. The principle is very 
clear." 
</P>
<P>
Voy made a number of enemies at that seminar, offending other NGBs when he said 
that only two sports, figure skating and women's field hockey, had never 
produced a positive drug test. Again, NGB officials thought that he should have 
been more specific and explained that he was not referring to steroids in every 
case. 
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of the program is supposed to be educational, not someone saying, 
'Nyah, nyah, nyah, you're on drugs,' " said Mike Jacki, executive director of 
the U.S. Gymnastics Federation. "By misrepresenting what's happening out there, 
he's not being respectful to the athletes." 
</P>
<P>
After several NGBs had complained, Voy received a message from USOC officials. 
</P>
<P>
"All that one of the NGBs has to do is complain or say, 'I want Voy to shut 
up,' and that happens automatically," Voy said. "There's no review. Nobody 
says, 'What did you do and why did you do it? Are you right or wrong?' No, it's 
just, 'Let's shut him up.' " 
</P>
<P>
Expressing his support for Voy, Pittenger said that the USOC has shown its 
confidence in Voy's drug-testing program by "considerably enhancing" his budget 
in that area for the next quadrennium. But Pittenger said that he has met with 
little success in his attempt to intervene on Voy's behalf with the indignant 
NGBs. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes you can express things to people, and they don't accept your 
position," Pittenger said. 
</P>
<P>
Voy has not lost all NGB support. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Lace, executive director of the U.S. Cycling Federation, said that, 
because of Voy's expertise, the USOC is "on the cutting edge of drug testing" 
in the world. He also said that he appreciates Voy's candor. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm an advocate of saying that we shouldn't keep things under our collars," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Another supporter is F. Don Miller, former executive director of the USOC. He 
hired Voy in January, 1984, as the USOC's first full-time chief medical officer 
in response to the drug scandal at the 1983 Pan American Games in Caracas, 
Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
"The man in that position has to possess the highest degree of integrity," 
Miller said. "Bob Voy does. He is extremely honest. As far as being outspoken, 
everything that I've read that he's said has been accurate. 
</P>
<P>
"It should be recognized that the person in that position has to make 
statements about the pros and cons of the program. I feel sorry for the NGBs if 
they don't recognize that. But even if he sold his soul, he wouldn't make 
everyone happy." 
</P>
<P>
Voy said that the USOC misses Miller's leadership. 
</P>
<P>
"My hat's off to F. Don Miller, who was shocked by the whole drug problem in 
1983 and took the right step," Voy said. "From that day, the program has been 
effective. But there's been a constant erosion in the authority of that program 
by the (NGBs). 
</P>
<P>
"Please don't make this statement sound like it's an accusation about their 
integrity. It's the reality of the sports world. If the competition has a 
performance-enhancement from a drug, the leadership of the sport may really 
feel that it's wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"But the success of sport in this country is based on success. The guy in the 
tavern drinking a beer and watching the television wants us to win. And so does 
the sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why we need strong leadership. Right now, it doesn't exist in the USOC, 
and it doesn't exist in the IOC (International Olympic Committee). The problem 
with leadership in sports in this country is that it's politically based. Maybe 
that's what life is. Maybe I'm too much of an idealist." 
</P>
<P>
Pittenger, who has been the executive director since January, did not seem to 
take Voy's criticisms personally. 
</P>
<P>
"Bob talks to the athletes every day, and I think his comments reflect their 
frustrations," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Voy confirmed that the athletes who are clean -- and he said that includes a 
large majority in most sports -- are frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
"We've played nice guys to the sports administrations when athletes are saying, 
'Please do something,"' Voy said. "Athletes who talk to me are saying, 'We're 
fed up with this. We're being cheated. There's no point in us being world-class 
athletes because we can't stay off the juice and still win.' " 
</P>
<P>
Voy said that he cannot assure them otherwise, adding that there is at least 
one masking agent, a substance that hides traces of steroids in the system, 
commonly used by athletes today that cannot be detected. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been part of the problem," he said. "I thought that testing after 
competitions would work. I know now that it doesn't work. You can't announce 
testing and deter drug use. 
</P>
<P>
"Not all of the money we've spent on testing in the last 5 years has been 
wasted. We've stopped a limited use of stimulants and protected a lot of health 
on that basis. But we haven't stopped the steroid problem. The reality of it is 
that we haven't done the job. 
</P>
<P>
"Ben Johnson wasn't a shocker to me. It's just a surprise that he got caught. 
As far as gaining the attention of the sports, it was good from that 
standpoint. But is it going to decrease steroid use? Not at all. 
</P>
<P>
"If anything, it's going to increase drug use. It's now been demonstrated that 
the fastest man in the world uses steroids." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he still believes that some sports are less than vigilant in their 
drug programs, Voy said, "It depends on who does the testing." 
</P>
<P>
To avoid such suspicions, he has joined numerous athletes in calling for 
testing conducted by agencies that are independent of sports organizations. 
</P>
<P>
"If somebody suspected my business of being unsound, I'm not going to do an 
internal audit," he said. "I'm going to hire Arthur Anderson to do an 
independent audit." 
</P>
<P>
Since there are no agencies conducting independent drug tests, Voy said that he 
might like to start one some time. But, for now at least, he has a job. 
</P>
<P>
"I have mixed emotions," he said. "I'm not sure I want to leave the USOC, but I 
do want to be effective. I'll let you know if I quit. I'd like to battle it a 
little more."

MORNING BRIEFING: HE JUST WASN'T READY TO HANG IT UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Coach Sam Wyche of the Cincinnati Bengals can make it to the top of the 
National Football League ladder today in the Super Bowl, and if he does, Wyche 
can thank Alexander Graham Bell for inventing the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
Wyche was a graduate assistant at South Carolina in 1968 when a Gamecock 
assistant coach made a telephone call that got Wyche a tryout with the 
Cincinnati Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
Although he was anything but a great player, Wyche's knowledge of the game 
allowed him to stick around for a 9-year NFL career with 5 teams. 
</P>
<P>
Once retired, Wyche opened a sporting goods store. Even though his business was 
successful, Wyche missed football. In 1979, he decided to coach but was turned 
down for a high school job because he didn't have a teaching credential. 
</P>
<P>
Then he got a telephone call from his quarterback coach with the Bengals, who 
now was a head coach in the NFL. He wanted Wyche on his staff. 
</P>
<P>
The first call was made by Lou Holtz, the second by Bill Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
Add Wyche: He obviously is an intelligent man, but reporters covering the Super 
Bowl have more than worn out that angle. Wyche had a little fun with them when 
he said: "You are what you think, you are what you eat, you are what you are. 
I'm asparagus, basically." 
</P>
<P>
Prison officials at Idaho State Penitentiary in Boise are trying their best to 
defuse a tense situation among the inmate population. 
</P>
<P>
The prisoners are angry, but not because of bad food or abuse from the guards. 
</P>
<P>
The prison's underground television cable went out a few days ago, and workers 
may not be able to fix it in time for today's Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The inmates offered to pay for the repairs and to dig trenches to reach the 
cable. But George Miller, acting deputy warden for programs, refused both 
offers. 
</P>
<P>
Said an inmate, "This is definitely fueling our animosity." 
</P>
<P>
Rookie Andrew Lang of the Phoenix Suns and his wife, Bronwyn, who met while 
both played basketball at the University of Arkansas, are expecting their first 
child next spring. Bronwyn Lang had a better shooting percentage in college 
than her husband, a 6-11 center. 
</P>
<P>
Said Sun Coach Cotton Fitzsimmons: "I'd like to have the draft rights to that 
baby." 
</P>
<P>
Alternate game plan: John Kordic of the Toronto Maple Leafs expressed his 
regret, sort of, for using his stick to break the nose of Keith Acton of the 
Edmonton Oilers, which got Kordic a 10-game suspension. 
</P>
<P>
Said Kordic: "I regret breaking his nose with my stick, but I don't regret 
breaking it. I should have just dropped my gloves and beat him up. I would have 
(been penalized), but I would not have been suspended. If something like that 
happens again, that's what I will do. I won't use my stick, I will just use my 
hands." 
</P>
<P>
From Speedy Morris, LaSalle basketball coach: "When I first got the job at 
LaSalle, the phone rang and my wife told me it was Sports Illustrated. I cut 
myself shaving and fell down the steps in my rush to get to the phone. And when 
I got there, a voice on the other end said, 'For just 75 cents an issue . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook 
</P>
<P>
Coach Jerry Reynolds of the Sacramento Kings, whose 11 victories include wins 
over the Lakers, New York Knicks and Houston Rockets, when each was a division 
leader: "Now we've beaten three of the division leaders. Cleveland's on our 
list, and I know they're scared to death."

MCNALL WORRIED AS KINGS FALL AGAIN; 
</P>
<P>
HARTFORD WINS, 5-4; GRETZKY NOW NO. 2 ON NHL POINT LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

HARTFORD, Conn. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After watching the Kings lose their third straight game Saturday night, owner 
Bruce McNall was looking for help wherever he could get it. 
</P>
<P>
"We need another tough winger. Can you be ready?" McNall asked Gordie Howe 
after the Kings came from 2 goals ahead to lose, 5-4, to the Hartford Whalers. 
</P>
<P>
"It might take a couple of hours," said Howe, a Hall of Famer who is two months 
shy of his 61st birthday. 
</P>
<P>
It may take longer than that to straighten out the Kings, who loaded all their 
big guns on one line but still fired a blank in the end, even though Luc 
Robitaille (2 goals), Wayne Gretzky (1 goal, 3 assists) and Bernie Nicholls (1 
goal, 2 assists) accounted for all of their scoring. 
</P>
<P>
The loss put a damper on a milestone night for Gretzky, who moved into second 
place on the all-time National Hockey League point list, one point ahead of 
former King Marcel Dionne, now with the New York Rangers. Gretzky, who has 
1,771 points, trails only Howe, with 1,850. 
</P>
<P>
Is McNall -- who has accompanied the team on the entire trip and was joined 
Saturday by General Manager Rogie Vachon -- concerned about his team? 
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely, I am," said McNall, who reiterated his desire to make another deal 
before the March trading deadline. 
</P>
<P>
A strong, grinding forward would be ideal. And if the asking price were more 
reasonable, McNall said he would be interested in Bob Probert, the tough 
Detroit wing, who is a handful on the ice but even more so when he's off it, as 
indicated by a string of alcohol-related offenses. 
</P>
<P>
"I would take the risk if the price came down," McNall said, "but they (the Red 
Wings) aren't even in the ballpark yet." 
</P>
<P>
And, McNall said, neither are the Kings at the desperation stage, even if they 
have won just 3 games in their last 11 and are in danger of losing 4 in a row 
for the first time this season. 
</P>
<P>
"We played a lot better tonight than (in) the other two games," he said. "I'm 
not panicked about it. We've had a lot of injuries. It's a typical midseason 
slump." 
</P>
<P>
Two more injuries occurred Saturday. Wing Igor Liba bruised a shoulder on his 
first shift, and during a first-period fight with Hartford hit man Torrie 
Robertson, King swing man Marty McSorley aggravated the shoulder injury he 
suffered in the New Year's Eve exhibition against the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
McSorley wasn't hurt by Robertson, but by the linesman, who refused to let go 
of his right arm. McSorley didn't play the rest of the night. "I'll be all 
right," he said. "But I don't understand the referee's logic. It was two 
against one, and he made it three against one." 
</P>
<P>
Talk of a slump might easily have been silenced except for a dreadful giveaway 
by King defenseman Tim Watters that led to the game-tying goal by rookie Jody 
Hull of the Whalers at 11:24 of the third period. 
</P>
<P>
Watters, who sat out the last game with a strained neck, collared a loose puck 
and headed unhindered toward the back of the King net. The puck, however, took 
a detour, hitting off the side of the net and right out front to Hull (no 
relation to Bobby). Hull merely had to tip it past a stunned goalie Glenn Healy 
to make it 4-4. 
</P>
<P>
"I lost it in the snow," said Watters, sounding a little like a baseball 
infielder saying he lost a grounder in the sun. It was a bad spot to lose it, a 
major league giveaway. Obviously, it changed the momentum of the game." 
</P>
<P>
How badly did Watters butcher the play? "I don't know how he (Hull) got the 
puck so fast after I chopped it up into so many pieces," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Whalers finished carving up the Kings a bit later, after referee Dan 
Marouelli whistled Gretzky for a hooking infraction of a highly dubious nature 
with 4:48 left to play. 
</P>
<P>
Hartford, which already had scored twice on the power play, clicked for the 
game-winning goal seconds after Gretzky had finished serving his penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Defenseman Dave Babych kept the puck in the zone at the left point and flicked 
it to wing Kevin Dineen -- who had scored his 28th goal to make it 4-3 in the 
second period -- at the top of the left circle. 
</P>
<P>
Dineen took advantage of a traffic jam in the slot to walk in on Healy, who got 
a piece of Dineen's shot but couldn't keep Babych -- who had circled to his 
other side -- from tipping the puck into the net. 
</P>
<P>
That goal spoiled a splendid effort by the Gretzky line, notably Nicholls, who 
now has 101 points -- surpassing his previous career high of 100 -- and 47 
goals in 48 games, leaving him 3 goals short of becoming the sixth player in 
NHL history to score at least 50 goals in 50 games. 
</P>
<P>
Would Nicholls like the line to stay together? "Oh, sure," he said, "the 
opportunity to play with Wayne is a great thrill. I think (Coach Robbie Ftorek) 
wants us to play together. He tried us some against the Islanders (Thursday), 
but nobody went on the other side of the blue line to help the defense. We 
can't do that. But if we take care of our own end, I think we can be a good 
line." 
</P>
<P>
Nicholls made exceptional plays on three of the Kings' goals. He got up after 
being knocked down by a defenseman to take a pass from Gretzky and beat rookie 
goalie Peter Sidorkiewicz with a slapper from the right circle. The goal, at 
the 3-minute mark of the second period, tied the score at 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in perhaps the most spectacular play of the night, he picked the puck 
cleanly off the stick of Dineen and fed it to Gretzky, whose skimmer from the 
left circle beat Sidorkiewicz at 14:01. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty-six seconds later, Nicholls fought off Sylvain Cote's check to advance 
the puck behind the net to Gretzky, who threaded a pass to Robitaille that 
resulted in the left wing's 32nd goal and a 4-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
But the Whalers came back, which means there's no guarantee that line will 
remain intact. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't get the W," Ftorek said. 
</P>
<P>
And Howe.

<TEXT>
<P>
Time waits for no man, as the declines of old dynasts Tom Landry, Don Shula and 
Chuck Noll are said to prove. 
</P>
<P>
They've all had to make way for the great young minds of the modern game like . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
Paul Brown? 
</P>
<P>
That's right, 80-year-old Paul Brown, still active as principal owner and 
general manager of the Cincinnati Bengals, who are about to play in their 
second Super Bowl in the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, it's Paul Brown's mind that has never waited for anyone. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to know where modern football started, try this man, who was the 
first to grade players on film and give IQ tests -- at Massillon High School in 
the early '40s -- who helped integrate the pro game, hired the first full-time 
coaching staff, first sent in plays from the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
That electronic helmet they're still trying to get right? 
</P>
<P>
"I did it, must have been 30-40 years ago," the old gent says. "I had this 
thing, no bigger than a watch. We put it inside George Ratterman's helmet. 
</P>
<P>
"We were playing an exhibition game and I could talk to George. The thing never 
worked real well. It was buzzing and all that. He finally came over and said, 
'Coach, some guy just got stabbed over on Fifth Avenue.' " 
</P>
<P>
Brown's news conference breaks up in laughter. 
</P>
<P>
"You had to know Ratterman," Brown says, grinning. "I probably made a mistake, 
trying it out with him." 
</P>
<P>
DAYS OF GLORY, DAYS OF RAGE 
</P>
<P>
PB, we barely knew ye. 
</P>
<P>
PB, that's what everyone in the Bengals' front office, including the 
secretaries, calls him. Far from the austere figure he appeared on TV, prowling 
the sidelines, looking sterner than stern, those flaring eyebrows making him 
look like a frowning hawk, he is gentle, polite, and, around people he doesn't 
know, a little shy. 
</P>
<P>
He is self-effacing and hates self-promoters. If he's aware that he changed his 
world -- don't worry, he is -- he is becomingly embarrassed if it's mentioned 
in his presence. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't mind talking about the good old days, when a team was a family, when 
football was a game rather than a retirement plan, and everyone wasn't bent on 
cashing in on each of his life's experiences. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't, however, have the modern habit of re-hashing his grievances over 
and over. 
</P>
<P>
But he has those, too, or one big one: That first Monday in 1963 when Art 
Modell, the new owner of the Cleveland Browns, barely off the plane from 
Brooklyn, called him into his office and fired him. 
</P>
<P>
"That's in the past," says Brown when asked about it. "Long gone. Forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
"Art and I see each other socially now and it's history." 
</P>
<P>
At the time, though, Brown considered Modell the devil in manipulative 
merchant-prince's clothing. 
</P>
<P>
Modell fired the coach who had started the franchise; who had 8 years left on 
his contract; who had built the team into a power in the All-America Football 
Conference and took it right to the top of the National Football League, too; 
who brought 12 future Hall of Famers players to town, among them Jim Brown, 
Marion Motley, Otto Graham and Mike McCormack; on whose staff Shula and Hall of 
Fame coach Weeb Ewbank learned their lessons; whose very name the team had 
taken. 
</P>
<P>
Modell had the things in Brown's office put in a cardboard box and placed on 
the porch of his house. 
</P>
<P>
Brown called his assistants to his home and told them they owed it to their 
families -- a theme he always returns to -- to stay on if asked, that he 
wouldn't consider them disloyal. 
</P>
<P>
Modell did retain them, under Brown's old top assistant, Blanton Collier, who 
took the team Brown had just gone 7-6-1 with and won a division title in his 
first season. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't hear from any of the coaches after they left my home that day," Brown 
says in his autobiography, "PB." 
</P>
<P>
"Katy (his wife) and I couldn't understand why they didn't call or come see us. 
Of course, I realize now that if Modell had heard about it, their jobs would 
have been in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
"Finally, I said to Katy, 'I've got to see these guys anyway,' so I reserved a 
room at the Midday Club in Cleveland and invited them all to lunch. I didn't 
know what I really expected to accomplish, although I did ask them one favor: 
To tell the truth if they were ever called to testify in a damage suit. 
</P>
<P>
"Other than that, very little was said by anyone and it just tore me up. When 
lunch ended, all I could say was 'Goodby,' and with a hollow feeling, I left 
them. I guess that I was upset, too, that the men to whom I had given so much 
had offered me so little when I really needed it. I had brought every one of 
these men into football. They were my guys and my closest friends, and I 
couldn't understand what was happening to them or to me." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ELBA ON THE PACIFIC, RESURRECTION ON THE OHIO 
</P>
<P>
It's January, 1989, the day after the Bengals have won the AFC championship, 
and Brown is sitting in his office in Riverfront Stadium. It's cool and dimly 
lit, with a Bengal tigerskin rug in front of the window. 
</P>
<P>
He's asked about Modell. He doesn't really want to go into it in length. He 
talked about it in his book and how many times can a private man trot out his 
soul? 
</P>
<P>
"Would you like a copy?" he asks. 
</P>
<P>
He reaches behind him into a cabinet and bring out one of the 50 or so copies 
there, autographs the flyleaf and gives it to his interviewer. 
</P>
<P>
"Art was not a football person at all," he says. "He was from a PR firm in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a friend of one of our owners, Bob Gries, and he made a suggestion to 
him -- that there should be doubleheaders in football like there were in 
baseball. Art thought that sounded like pretty good -- what's the term Bob 
used? -- merchandising." 
</P>
<P>
Modell ultimately bought a controlling interest in the Browns. Brown, a 5% 
owner himself and contractually entitled to full operating control of the team, 
found himself fighting for everything. 
</P>
<P>
"We drafted a young guy named Ernie Davis, but it turned out that he was going 
to die of leukemia," he says. "Art wanted me to put him in an exhibition game 
and I couldn't do that. Pete Rozelle backed me up, told me not to activate him, 
which I didn't. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It had never entered my mind that anything could ever happen in Cleveland to 
me. When I was told I wouldn't be there anymore, I guess that was the low 
point. It was difficult for me to go home, tell my wife, kids. It's part of the 
coaching world, but I never thought about it in terms of happening to me. 
</P>
<P>
"What he said to me was, 'This football team can never be mine as long as 
you're here.' 
</P>
<P>
"All we did was pack up and go as far away as we could, which was La Jolla. And 
say nothing. 
</P>
<P>
"But that's all history. It's so many damn years ago, it's nothing to me." 
</P>
<P>
It was something to him then, though. In his book, the chapter on his La Jolla 
days is titled, "Years of Exile." 
</P>
<P>
There were 4 such years, in which he looked around, and Rozelle looked around 
for him, and they concluded finally that the new franchise proposed for 
Cincinnati would be almost perfect. 
</P>
<P>
Brown's Bengals wore orange and black. 
</P>
<P>
His Browns had worn orange and brown. 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals had orange helmets. 
</P>
<P>
The Browns had orange helmets. 
</P>
<P>
Brown says it was just a coincidence, that he wanted a lively name, like the 
Tigers of Massillon High, and that Bengal tigers are orange and black. 
</P>
<P>
And so he set out. 
</P>
<P>
"We flew into Cincinnati," says Al LoCasale, now the Raiders' executive 
assistant but then Brown's newly hired head of scouting. "There was a big 
snowstorm. There was also a public transportation strike and everybody was 
stuck downtown. And the newspapers were on strike. 
</P>
<P>
"He looked at me and said, 'We left La Jolla for this?' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MODERN TIMES 
</P>
<P>
You don't fight a war with close-order drill. But the first thing you do in the 
Army, believe me, is close-order drill. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Paul Brown 
</P>
<P>
When Bill Walsh was a toddler and Sam Wyche an unformed hope, the one great 
thinker in football was Paul Brown, who thought out everything under the sun. 
</P>
<P>
On California players: 
</P>
<P>
"I remember he was talking about Frank Gifford," LoCasale said. "He said, 'Now 
that's a guy who went to USC who's normal.' 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'I don't want to coach guys who come into training camp with any 
surfboards in the back of their cars.' " 
</P>
<P>
On when a team should start weightlifting: 
</P>
<P>
"We scouted the Saints, who entered the league the year before we did," 
LoCasale said. 
</P>
<P>
"They put in a big strengthening program from Day 1. Paul's feeling was, 
they're spending a lot of time strengthening people they're going to cut the 
next day. He said, 'Let's get down to the people we think are going to play 
football for us and then put our strength program in.' " 
</P>
<P>
On entertainment: 
</P>
<P>
Brown was the first to take his team to a movie the night before the game, but 
he was particular. The Raiders might not mind -- or might insist on -- having 
their guys watch "Texas Chainsaw Massacre," but not PB. 
</P>
<P>
From his book: "In the '70s, the choice of movies became a bit skimpy for my 
taste and when I complained publicly, a local theater in Cincinnati provided us 
with some private showings of decent movies." 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals went back to "Bambi." 
</P>
<P>
On what he wanted in a player: 
</P>
<P>
"He put a tremendous stress on, quote, good people," LoCasale said. " 'We're 
going to win with good people.' 
</P>
<P>
"His speeches to the squad were famous. He met with our squad the first day in 
training camp for 2 hours, and he covered life. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'I'm very fortunate to be in the Hall of Fame and I've got nothing 
left to prove. I got back in football to have fun. And if anybody stands 
between me and my having fun, they're gone.' " 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'Don't call me Coach. Call me Paul. I want to have a first-name 
relationship. However, remember one thing; you play and I pay.' " 
</P>
<P>
In their third season, the Bengals made the playoffs, the fastest rise of any 
National Football League expansion team. 
</P>
<P>
But things were different. 
</P>
<P>
It was the '60s, and authority figures were hard-pressed on all borders. 
</P>
<P>
Football players hired agents, joined the union and became less interested in 
surrogate fathers than in obtaining raises in their allowances. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lot of philosophy," said Bob Trumpy, the NBC broadcaster who was a 
star Bengal tight end and early maverick, prone to revolutionary acts, such as 
smoking in the dressing room. 
</P>
<P>
Brown had trouble with Trumpy, and vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
"He started every year with a 6-hour talk, 3 hours the first night, 3 the next 
morning. I listened to it for 8 years. 
</P>
<P>
"He used to say, 'Lou Groza heard it 21 years.' We all thought, 'Lou Groza must 
have been able to sleep with his eyes open, or he must have been dead.' 
</P>
<P>
"He certainly encouraged us to call him Paul, but, I mean, nobody did. I think, 
after a lot of players retired . . . some of the Cleveland players . . . they 
became pretty good friends with him. 
</P>
<P>
"I played for him for 8 years and he wore the same pants and shirt to training 
camp for 8 years: black hat with CB on it; white T-shirt with nothing on it; a 
pair of khaki pants with a black belt; black shoes with white socks. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no complaints about him as a coach. I thought he got more out of us than 
we really had and he's got to be given credit for that. But when he stepped 
down, I thought he duplicated a lot of what Art Modell had done to him." 
</P>
<P>
Says linebacker Tom Dinkel, who arrived after Brown quit coaching: 
</P>
<P>
"You got a very cold feeling with him. I got along great with him, but there 
was always that feeling, like he definitely had the upper hand. That's his 
whole thing. He wants you to be part of a family, but he wants you to know that 
he has the leverage to dispose of you as he sees fit. 
</P>
<P>
"He thinks, as a player, you should have enough money to pay for a car in cash 
and have a nice, healthy down payment on a house. 
</P>
<P>
"That was one of his big sayings: 'This is not going to be your life's work.' " 
</P>
<P>
Cash for a car? 
</P>
<P>
Not lately, in this league. That rolling German steel goes for $50,000 and up. 
</P>
<P>
"He used to say, 'Those banks want you to take out those big loans,' " Dinkel 
said. "I didn't think I was going to take serious financial advice from him, as 
far as tax consequences go. But I used to chuckle about it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
GENIUSES PART 
</P>
<P>
After going 10-4, 7-7 and 11-3 in 1973, '74 and '75, Brown gave up coaching. 
</P>
<P>
Trumpy thinks that he picked Bill (Tiger) Johnson as his successor -- and 
passed over Bill Walsh, who had worked for him for 9 years -- so that he could 
retain control. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh, bitterly disappointed at not getting the job, left the organization and 
rose to greatness elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Said Brown: "The fact is that I made a business judgment and selected Bill 
Johnson -- Bill was our senior assistant. In those days they didn't have what 
they call offensive coordinators, defensive coordinators. 
</P>
<P>
"I fully thought that Bill Walsh would be back with Bill Johnson. I thought 
they'd make a great combination. 
</P>
<P>
"But Bill went down with the rest of our coaches to the Senior Bowl and while 
he was there, the owner of the San Diego Chargers, Gene Klein, got ahold of him 
and made him a good proposition, plus the title of offensive coordinator. I 
guess in those days there wasn't as much protocol. Nobody called us and asked 
permission. It just happened. 
</P>
<P>
"In fairness, Bill always had -- I thought -- a desire to get back to the West 
Coast. 
</P>
<P>
"You can only appoint one guy and I had Chuck Studley, Mike McCormack. I had a 
lot of people I could have made the coach. Bill Johnson's first year was a good 
one. He made the playoffs. But then he had health problems." 
</P>
<P>
So did the Bengals. They had consecutive 4-12 seasons. Homer Rice followed 
Johnson and Forrest Gregg followed Rice. 
</P>
<P>
In Gregg's second season, 1981, the Bengals reached the Super Bowl, where they 
lost in the Silverdome to Walsh and the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
Two seasons after that, Gregg bolted suddenly for total control in Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Brown hired Wyche, an ex-Bengal and Walsh's quarterback coach. 
</P>
<P>
Trumpy says that Brown hired Gregg, a powerful personality in his own right, 
because Modell had fired him, that Gregg left because of collisions with Brown, 
that Brown hired Wyche because he wanted a Walsh-surrogate. 
</P>
<P>
Brown doesn't agree, but history does seem to have a way of coming around again 
in his life. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FOREVER YOUNG 
</P>
<P>
PB does the Ickey Shuffle. 
</P>
<P>
Really. 
</P>
<P>
"I walked into the dressing room before a game," Brown said. "We were playing 
Seattle. I saw Ickey (Woods), James Brooks, Stanford Jennings. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Ickey, that dance you do -- I can't say much for it. But my wife 
likes it. I don't think it's taunting anybody. As far as I'm concerned, you can 
do it.' 
</P>
<P>
"And then I went . . . " 
</P>
<P>
The august Paul Brown then did the Ickey Shuffle for his news conference, 
complete with feigned spike, while the audience howled. 
</P>
<P>
(Mildly exasperated,) "Right away, some people thought that was funny. You can 
be 100 years old and do this. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing to it but leaning on one foot, then the other. But he's having more 
fun with it. It just developed. It's one of those things -- it's amazing what 
takes place in our society." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever else they say about Brown, they'll never say he was swayed by the 
tide. 
</P>
<P>
They say he's cheap, and old-fashioned. 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals rarely get a rookie signed before the end of training camp. The 
Bengals skimp on scouts and used to draft heavily in the Big Ten. The Bengals 
didn't like the idea of starting a scouting combine workout because it cost too 
much money, until they found out it would save them money, after which they 
fell in love with it. 
</P>
<P>
Well, try thrifty, and principled. 
</P>
<P>
Does he have an opinion about drug policy? 
</P>
<P>
"Well, you're talking to the wrong guy. I can remember when I dismissed a guy 
forever if he got drunk. I had a guy our first year in Cleveland who got 
himself . . . intoxicated and got in a fight with some police. That was the 
night before the championship. So when he came to the field the next day, I 
said, 'Jim, for the welfare of this football team, you are dismissed. Get out.' 
</P>
<P>
"That was the way it was then." 
</P>
<P>
Instant replay? 
</P>
<P>
The purist of purists, Brown still leads the fight against it. 
</P>
<P>
"He's on the competition committee," LoCasale said. "There'll be a number of 
issues on which there'll be a 3-1 vote, where Paul will just stand up and be 
the one. The game is very important to him." 
</P>
<P>
Fiscal policy? 
</P>
<P>
"You'd be surprised how many teams lost money," Brown said. "We've got people 
today who aren't football people. They call themselves entre . . . preneurs. 
They have outside businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"In the old days, there were the Rooneys, the Halases, the Maras. Right now, 
we're one of the old ones, ourselves, because we're nothing but football. We 
have to operate in terms of what we've got to do it with, and make no apologies 
for it. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, I got a lot of fun out of the fact that we got here with our 
rinky-dinky little 11. 
</P>
<P>
(Smiling,) "There used to be a writer in Pittsburgh, Chet Smith, the Village 
Smith. He'd call me on the phone when we were going to play the Steelers. He'd 
start like this: 
</P>
<P>
" 'How is the wily mentor today?' 
</P>
<P>
"I would say, 'Wiley's pretty good, Chet. What are the news?' 
</P>
<P>
"And he would say, 'Not a single new. I called to find out about your scrappy 
little 11.' " 
</P>
<P>
He smiles at the memory. 
</P>
<P>
Thus goes Paul Brown's last Super Bowl hurrah. 
</P>
<P>
Or is it? 
</P>
<P>
"I make a point of not thinking about it," Brown says, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
"I told our players and I told our coaches, 'Win this for yourselves.' 
</P>
<P>
"Who knows? I could be here . . . " 
</P>
<P>
He laughs. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . mind a little wishful thinking, fellows?" 
</P>
<P>
Figure he'll be back a couple of times.

Mark Calcavecchia, in the same situation a week ago, let a title get away from 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned something last week," Calcavecchia said Saturday after his late 
burst of 4 birdies and an eagle gave him a 3-stroke lead after three rounds of 
the $700,000 Phoenix Open golf tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"I was playing so good -- just like I am now -- and I got the lead going into 
Sunday and I had the feeling inside of me that I was going to win," he said. "I 
really expected to win. And I blew it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going into the last round tomorrow with a different attitude out there," 
the long-hitting Calcavecchia said after his brilliant run had produced a 
6-under-par 65 for a 54-hole total of 199 and a 3-shot lead. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to expect to win," he said. "I'm going to try to win. That's 
different." 
</P>
<P>
Calcavecchia was three shots off the pace when he went to the 13th tee and 
began a birdie-birdie-eagle-birdie-birdie string that vaulted him into the 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Hallberg and Mark McCumber shared second place at 202 going into today's 
final round. 
</P>
<P>
Hallberg made a 50-foot eagle putt in his round of 66, and McCumber shot a 69.

MIAMI'S GARY RUSHES FOR 97 YARDS TO HELP SOUTH SCORE A 13-12 VICTORY

Cleveland Gary from the University of Miami, said he wasn't thinking about 
awards or the National Football League, but he claimed the biggest award in 
Saturday's Senior Bowl game and probably helped himself in the upcoming pro 
football draft. 
</P>
<P>
Gary, named the game's outstanding player, rushed for 97 yards to spark the 
South attack in a 13-12 victory over the North. 
</P>
<P>
Tulane's Terrence Jones accounted for both South touchdowns, but Gary turned in 
the game's big plays. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just thinking about winning," Gary said. 
</P>
<P>
South Coach John Robinson of the Rams said: "He's going to be a big-time 
player. Although everybody knew about him, I think he helped himself today. He 
had such a workhorse effort. He handled the ball a lot, and in key situations." 
</P>
<P>
Jones capped a 70-yard drive on the South's first possession with a 1-yard run, 
then threw to Walter Reeves of Auburn with a 3-yard touchdown pass with 10:53 
left. 
</P>
<P>
Gary rushed for 38 yards on 4 carries in the first drive. He also caught 5 
passes for 42 yards in the game, including a 10-yard catch on a fourth-and-2 at 
the North 41 to keep the game-winning drive going on the opening play of the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"The wind was working against us, and I thought we had to make our move then," 
Robinson said of the gamble. 
</P>
<P>
"Our guys played real hard," said North Coach Dan Reeves of the Denver Broncos. 
"I'm just sorry we came up short." 
</P>
<P>
Jones completed 6 of 8 passes for 44 yards in the 72-yard fourth-quarter drive 
that erased a 12-6 North lead. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Mississippi's Chris Seroka, who missed his first extra point, broke 
the tie. 
</P>
<P>
The North first scored on a safety when Alex Stewart of Cal State Fullerton 
sacked Jones in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
That set up a 37-yard drive on the ensuing kickoff, which ended on a 7-yard run 
by Dave Meggett of Towson State. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Gillette of Michigan gave the North a 12-6 lead in the third quarter with 
a 24-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Jackson of Louisiana State intercepted a pass by Duke Anthony Dilweg at 
the South 27 with 2:22 left, stopping the North's last threat. 
</P>
<P>
The victory increased the South's series advantage to 20-17-3. 
</P>
<P>
Jones completed 14 of 21 passes for 128 yards, and Gary got his 97 yards on 19 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
After Meggett's 7-yard run gave the North a 9-6 lead, the South moved from its 
22 to the North 42 before Washington's Tony Zackery intercepted a Jones pass at 
the 28. 
</P>
<P>
Five plays later, Alabama's Derrick Thomas intercepted a pass by Dilweg and 
returned it 11 yards to the South 40. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the second quarter, the South stopped the North on the 3 with a 
39-yard punt by Alabama's Chris Mohr.

ICE FISHING FESTIVAL; 
</P>
<P>
MORE THAN 25,000 WILL BRAVE COLD TO COMPETE ON MICHIGAN LAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

HOUGHTON LAKE, Mich. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 25,000 fishermen are braving probable zero or subzero weather this 
weekend in the biggest ice-fishing derby in the nation. And there will be about 
that many here next weekend, too. 
</P>
<P>
It's the 39th annual Tip-Up Town, USA, Ice-Fishing Festival here on Houghton 
Lake, Michigan's biggest of more than 11,000 inland lakes. 
</P>
<P>
Tip-Ups are rigs that hold a reel and line set in a hole in the ice. They pop 
up a tiny red flag when a fish takes the bait, giving fishermen a signal that 
he has a bite. 
</P>
<P>
When the flag suddenly goes up, the action is on. Ice fishing is a skill sport. 
The fisherman has to have his line set at the proper distance beneath the ice. 
When the fish hits the bait and the spool stops, then starts again, it is time 
to set the hook and reel in the reluctant fish. 
</P>
<P>
Houghton Lake, 8 miles across and 16 miles long in the northern part of 
Michigan's Lower Peninsula, looks like a sieve, what with all those fishing 
holes. 
</P>
<P>
This tribute to the sport of ice fishing will also feature contests for the 
biggest fish, snowmobile races, ice sculpture competition, softball on ice, 
golf on ice and other esoteric activities. 
</P>
<P>
Fishing is the main attraction, though, and the fishermen take it seriously. 
Last year, the biggest northern pike caught during the Tip-Up Town contest was 
3 feet long and weighed 12 pounds 12 ounces. The biggest Walleye weighed 6-2 
and measured 23 1/2 inches. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, there was a big parade from Pinky's Plaza Shopping Center onto the 
lake with several elaborate floats made of crepe paper -- no Rose Parade floats 
with flowers in this icebox. Many floats were in the shape of huge walleyes, 
northerns, bluegills, perch and other lake fish. 
</P>
<P>
A carnival with a Ferris wheel is going on and there was a big dance inside a 
heated tent. Concession stands are strategically located on the ice, offering 
refreshments and souvenirs to those who come to fish and to those who come to 
watch those who fish. 
</P>
<P>
Houghton Lake Postmaster Ruth Coons is operating a portable post office on the 
ice and all letters posted here are canceled with a special Tip-Up Town, USA, 
Ice Festival postmark. 
</P>
<P>
Houghton Lake is the heart of winter recreation country in Michigan, the hub of 
a network of 5,400 miles of groomed snowmobile trails. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands have brought their snowmobiles to the ice-fishing festival from all 
corners of the state. Michigan has 205,000 registered snowmobiles, more than 
any other state. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan recently spent $2.5 million on 42 new snow grooming machines for the 
trails. This year, the state will spend another $2.5 million for trail grooming 
-- $1.5 million from gasoline taxes, $1 million from registration fees. There 
are 5 times more miles of groomed snowmobile trails than freeways for cars in 
this state. 
</P>
<P>
In Houghton Lake, population 7,000, there are 16 sporting goods stores catering 
to the needs of ice fishermen, selling live bait -- minnows and suckers -- 
canvas shelters ($180) with room enough to protect two fishermen from the 
elements, tip-ups, weights, line, hooks, jigging lures and other equipment. 
</P>
<P>
At shops such as Linda and Dave Perkins' Edgewater Beach Marina, fishermen can 
rent the tiny ice-fishing houses, called shanties, for $12 a day, including a 
propane heater and fuel. Hand warmers, at $3 a pop, are also a popular item. 
</P>
<P>
"The ice is nice and thick -- 10 inches thick clear across the lake now," 
informs Linda Perkins. "It should hold a car or pickup with no trouble, unless 
the vehicle falls through a pressure crack." 
</P>
<P>
She quickly adds: "If your car goes through the ice, we'll gladly haul it out 
of the drink for $2,500. That's as cheap as anybody on the lake." 
</P>
<P>
A winter doesn't pass without at least a dozen cars sinking to the bottom. The 
lake is 18 feet at its deepest. Ice-fishing season here generally runs from 
about mid-December until the end of March. 
</P>
<P>
It was 10 above zero, the wind-chill factor making it 10 below, a few days 
before the ice festival when 45 members of the Lansing Police Department were 
at Houghton Lake for their 12th-annual 1-day ice-fishing contest. They drove 
120 miles to get here. 
</P>
<P>
"We come up ahead of the mob. It's too crowded for us during the Tip-Up Town, 
USA, Ice Festival weekends," explained Bob Delamarter, 34, traffic officer for 
the department. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Jim Heyden, 50, said he has been ice fishing every winter of his life 
that he can remember. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like fishing out of a boat," he said. "I like walking on water." 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Joe Rodriguez, one of three Latinos on the Lansing PD -- he came north 
from San Benito, Tex. -- said it was a pleasure to join the troops on Houghton 
Lake for the camaraderie, the great ice fishing and to get away from the 
pressures of the big city. 
</P>
<P>
Big city? Lansing's population is 130,000. All things are relative, of course. 
</P>
<P>
The Lansing officers kept warm by ducking into their shanties and by wolfing 
down bowls of steaming hot chili. They wore "water snake" logos showing a 
tip-up and an ice fisherman embraced by a snake coiled around his body. 
</P>
<P>
"Ice fishermen call the (immature) northern pike snakes," said officer John 
Hunnell, who recalled the big controversy that occurred in one of the recent 
annual outings: 
</P>
<P>
"A fish took my line and reel under the ice. Officer Don Dunham was fishing 
nearby. It was moments before the 5 p.m. deadline to stop fishing. Dunham's 
hook caught my reel. He pulled in my line and the biggest fish of the day which 
I, not Dunham, originally caught. 
</P>
<P>
"I claimed the fish. I was overruled. Dunham walked away with the giant fish 
and all the money." 
</P>
<P>
Brandon Temple, 16-year-old son of detective Deane Temple, was the ice auger 
man, spudding new holes for the officers with his 7-foot-long auger. 
</P>
<P>
When a reporter's four pens all froze and note-taking became impossible, 
Lansing's finest roared. 
</P>
<P>
"Now you know what we go through in the cold," Sgt. Daryl Zuk said, laughing. 
"Many a time an officer starts writing a ticket and can't go on. His pen is 
frozen. Sometimes he lets the guy go." 
</P>
<P>
Detective Charlie Shawnee and others mentioned Magic Johnson, whose hometown is 
Lansing. 
</P>
<P>
"Tell our friend Magic to come join us next year. We'll teach him how to 
dribble snowballs," laughed Shawnee. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the guys from LAPD ought to join us, too. They would never believe 
this. Never believe we would rather be doing this than sitting at home beside a 
fire, watching TV." 
</P>
<P>
By midday, Deane Battley, Mike Foster, Tim Heyden, Charlie Shawnee, Daryl Zuk 
and Paul Wilkins had reeled in the biggest "snakes," northern pike 20 inches to 
2 feet long. 
</P>
<P>
A short distance away, dairy farmer Keith De Ruiter, 38, and his three sons, 
Wes, 8, Todd, 10, and Matt, 15, stood near their pickup truck, a half-mile out 
in the ice, waiting for a nibble. 
</P>
<P>
"We ice-fish as often as we can get away," said De Ruiter. "There is no better 
eating in the world than walleye and northern pike. The fish is firmer and 
tastes better, caught through the ice in winter than in summer." 
</P>
<P>
Thirty below zero isn't uncommon in this part of the country. Yet, the cold and 
miserable weather do not discourage the hearty ice fishermen. Braving the 
elements is part of the sport they say. The catch is well worth the trouble 
they insist.

AUSTRALIAN OPEN TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS; 
</P>
<P>
MCENROE AND KRICKSTEIN, LAST U.S. MEN, TO MEET IN 4TH ROUND 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The number of American men who can win the Australian Open has dropped to only 
2 on the seventh day, and it's going to get smaller soon. 
</P>
<P>
In a situation ugly for Americans, John McEnroe and Aaron Krickstein won their 
matches Sunday, which means one will eliminate the other when they meet in a 
fourth-round match Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Krickstein, seeded 10th, defeated Niclas Kroon of Sweden, 6-4, 7-5, 6-4, and 
McEnroe had an even easier time in what should have been a tougher match. The 
seventh-seeded McEnroe defeated hot-and-cold West German Patrick Kuhnen, who 
was mostly cold, 6-2, 7-5, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Krickstein, still on the comeback from injuries, said he wished more Americans 
had entered. He and McEnroe are the only Americans in the top 20 who chose to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everyone should be down here," Krickstein said. 
</P>
<P>
Brett Garnett, 21, a qualifier from Myrtle Beach, S.C., was eliminated by 
16th-seeded Amos Mansdorf, 6-2, 7-5, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
On a cool, cloudy and windy day, Ivan Lendl considered asking for permission to 
wear a warmup suit for his match against Nicklas Kulti. 
</P>
<P>
"I decided to rub hot cream on my legs instead," said the second-seeded Lendl, 
who defeated Kulti, 6-2, 6-4, 6-3, then rubbed it in afterward, saying the 
Swede's game was full of holes. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, fourth-seeded Stefan Edberg posted a 7-5, 7-5, 7-5 victory 
over Johan Kriek, then warmed up for his fourth-round match against Pat Cash. 
</P>
<P>
It was clearly the day's hottest moment. Edberg said that Cash, who eliminated 
Jeremy Bates of Great Britain, 7-6, 6-2, 6-3, performed less than admirably in 
Friday's 5-set victory over Richey Reneberg. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, it seemed like he tanked in the fourth set, and I thought it was pretty 
bad for him to act the way he did," Edberg said. "He didn't deserve to win. 
It's very seldom you see that, especially in a Grand Slam tournament." 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe was asked if he agreed with Edberg. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw that part of the match and I think he was pretty accurate," McEnroe 
said. "Tank may not be the right word, though. Maybe he lost concentration." 
</P>
<P>
Cash, of course disagreed. "No, I didn't tank and that's as simple as that," he 
said. "What was it, 6-4? That doesn't sound like a tank. Well, 6-0 is a tank. 
Enough of that, all right?" 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Steffi Graf, who scored a straight-set victory over Nicole Provis of 
Australia, was nevertheless forced to play out of a 4-4 game score in the first 
set. 
</P>
<P>
Graf, who had a 4-1 lead, won, 6-4, 6-0. She also wondered where all the nice 
summer weather has gone. 
</P>
<P>
"For sure, I don't know what's going on," said the West German, who will play 
Claudia Kohde-Kilsch in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Kohde-Kilsch, who defeated American Donna Faber, 17, 6-3, 6-3, also 
reaching the quarterfinals was Zina Garrison, a 7-5, 6-1 winner over another 
American, Cammy McGregor. Third-seeded Gabriela Sabatini, who will meet 
Garrison in the quarterfinals, defeated Raffaella Reggi of Italy, 6-0, 4-6, 
6-1. 
</P>
<P>
Boris Becker reached the round of 16 Saturday night with a 6-0, 6-1, 6-2 defeat 
of Canadian Chris Pridham, in a mismatch that required Becker's presence for 1 
hour 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like Steffi Graf," Becker said. 
</P>
<P>
But Pam Shriver had a different feeling after her match. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel pretty rotten," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Shriver, seeded fourth, lost in the third round to Catarina Lindqvist, 0-6, 
6-4, 8-6, in something that is becoming kind of an Australian Open tradition -- 
her third loss to Lindqvist in this event in the last 4 years. 
</P>
<P>
Shriver didn't take this latest defeat very well, knocking over every potted 
plant in her path as she walked through the tunnel to the dressing room. 
</P>
<P>
On a farm it would be the back 40, at a movie studio the back lot. But at the 
Australian Open it's Court 15. 
</P>
<P>
The most outer of outer courts, Court 15 is the utmost in the outback at this 
Grand Slam event. 
</P>
<P>
Its home is the National Tennis Center, which is located on a wedge of land 
squeezed between pasta ribbons of railroad tracks and the muddy brown Yarra 
River. 
</P>
<P>
The area is called Flinders Park, named after Australian Naval pioneer Matthew 
Flinders, whocircumnavigated Tasmania in 1802. 
</P>
<P>
Getting to Court 15 requires skill similar to Flanders'. It is at the farthest 
reaches of the tennis complex, a fact that American Elise Burgin discovered 
when she started looking for it to play her doubles match. 
</P>
<P>
Players are not assigned to Court 15, they are exiled. 
</P>
<P>
"It took about 3 hours to get there," she said. "I laughed when I saw it." 
</P>
<P>
After weaving through a maze of paths around the 11 other outside courts, 
Burgin found Court 15 resting uneasily with a railroad track on one side and a 
hospitality tent on the other. It is the only court at the Open with no 
spectator seating, except for a single park bench. 
</P>
<P>
"It's definitely the boonie of the boonies," Burgin said. 
</P>
<P>
Spectators could lean on the chain link fence within inches of the players, who 
are sitting during changeovers. Burgin said Lori McNeil, her doubles partner, 
knew what to expect. 
</P>
<P>
"She said people were coming up to her, asking for autographs and talking to 
her in the middle of her singles match," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Court 15 compares to one of the outside courts at the U.S. Open in 
Flushing Meadow, where smoke from grills cooking hamburgers wafts across the 
court during matches. 
</P>
<P>
Said Burgin: "At New York, you smell food. At Brisbane, you smell yeast from a 
giant brewery. Here, you've got trains, fans in your face and you can't get 
here without a map." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps taking the train would help. Shriver, who played a match at nearby 
Court 5, was distracted by spectators standing on the tops of trains just on 
the other side of the windscreen. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes a bit of getting used to," she said. "I felt like charging them 
admission." 
</P>
<P>
As the Australian Open finished its first week Sunday, courts were used closer 
to the showcase courts, Center Court and Courts 1 and 2, as the field got 
smaller and fewer outside courts were needed. 
</P>
<P>
Court 15 fell silent, or as silent as it gets with the trains running by.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pepperdine, behind the scoring of guards Craig Davis and Lamar Wilson, extended 
its winning streak to 4 straight games and remained in a 3-way tie for first 
place in the West Coast Athletic Conference with a 74-70 victory over Gonzaga 
Saturday night before a crowd of 3,700 at the Martin Centre. 
</P>
<P>
The Waves, who have won 17 of 22 from Gonzaga, are 4-0 in the WCAC, as are 
Loyola Marymount and St. Mary's. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, a junior, scored a season-high 26 points on 10-of-15 shooting, including 
6 of 7 from 3-point range. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, a senior, scored a career-high 15 points. 
</P>
<P>
After a 3-point shot by guard Doug Spradley gave Gonzaga a 47-42 lead with 
14:49 left, the Waves (12-7 overall) scored 16 straight to take a 58-47 lead 
with 9:56 left. Davis scored 11 of the points, including 3 3-pointers.

fouled on the play). 
</P>
<P>
But Wilson made 2 free throws to give Pepperdine a 70-66 lead.

RAVELING APOLOGIZES AFTER A SORRY GAME; 
</P>
<P>
LOSS TO ARIZONA STATE IS SIXTH IN ROW FOR USC, STILL WINLESS IN PAC-10 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
George Raveling, USC's basketball coach, issued an apology after the Trojans 
played poorly in a 67-62 loss to Arizona State Saturday at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing I can think to say to you (the media) is I'm sorry you had to 
sit through it," Raveling said. "Your employers ought to give you 
hazardous-duty pay. It was that kind of day." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Trojans are the only winless team in the Pacific 10, having lost 
their first six conference games, Raveling isn't discouraged. 
</P>
<P>
"They might let me go at the end of the season, but I sure as hell ain't going 
to worry about it," Raveling said. "I'm going to coach to the best of my 
abilities, and whatever happens happens. 
</P>
<P>
"Let me tell you, I'm 51 years old and there's a lot of damn things Raveling 
can do well in life besides coach basketball. Why should I worry about it? And 
I think I can do a better job because I'm not feeling insecure. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm smart enough to know that there are people who are upset. But the worst 
thing I can do is to get into a mind-set where I'm running scared. Then that 
gets into the kids." 
</P>
<P>
Raveling signed a 5-year contract 3 years ago. Although his record at USC is 
23-50 and he has had two last-place Pac-10 finishes, he said he has not felt 
pressure from school officials. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what more I could ask from (Athletic Director Mike) McGee and 
(President James) Zumberge, except an on-campus facility. They've been 
supportive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona State Coach Steve Patterson understands what Raveling is going through. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sorry for George," Patterson said. "I know his team is struggling right 
now. Yet, we're a struggling team, too." 
</P>
<P>
USC is 7-10 overall and 0-6 in the Pac-10, and Arizona State is 8-8 and 3-5. 
</P>
<P>
After being humiliated in a 28-point loss to No. 9 Arizona Thursday night, USC 
had a shot against injury-plagued Arizona State. After losing guard Tarence 
Wheeler to a knee injury two weeks ago, the Sun Devils had only nine healthy 
players. 
</P>
<P>
But that was all they needed to beat USC, which was plagued by mental mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans were beaten on the same play three times, giving up easy layups on 
length-of-the-court passes to Arizona State guard Matt Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the first time we've used the play this year," said Anderson, who had a 
team-high 17 points off the bench. "USC was pressuring us on the inbounds pass, 
and it was the logical thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans didn't do the logical thing very often down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
After USC forward Chris Moore, who had a team-high 15 points, hit a short 
jumper to tie it at 60-60, the Trojans, who had 18 turnovers, played giveaway. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore point guard Duane Cooper, walking the ball up the court against no 
pressure, was called for a 10-second violation, costing USC a chance to go 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Although Arizona State failed to capitalize on Cooper's mistake, the Trojans 
gave it away again on their next possession. 
</P>
<P>
USC forward Calvin Banks threw away a pass intended for Cooper, and Arizona 
State guard Ron Waller intercepted it and was fouled by Banks as he drove for a 
layup. Waller sank a free throw to give the Sun Devils a 61-60 lead with 1:17 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"Down the stretch, the last 6 or 7 minutes, we made some inexcusable mistakes," 
Raveling said. "They weren't mistakes of commission, but of omission. When 
you're told what to do, I don't know what else I can tell them." 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans went ahead again when Alan Pollard sank a layup with 57 seconds 
remaining for a 62-61 lead. 
</P>
<P>
But center Mark Becker put Arizona State ahead to stay when he tipped in a 
missed shot by teammate Alex Austin with 44 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
After Moore missed a layup, Sun Devil forward Trent Edwards sank two free 
throws with 25 seconds remaining after being fouled by Pollard. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 65-62, the Trojans called back-to-back timeouts to set up a play, but 
Andy Olivarez missed a three-point shot with 16 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Trojan Notes 
</P>
<P>
After scoring just 4 points in Thursday night's 97-69 loss to Arizona, USC 
guard Anthony Pendleton failed to score against Arizona State. Pendleton, the 
Trojans' leading scorer this season, took just two shots in 14 minutes. . . . 
USC shot 43.3% from the field, hitting 24 of 60 shots, and shot 52% at the free 
throw line, making 13 of 25. . . . USC plays at Washington next Thursday.

Robert Picard broke a tie with a shorthanded goal in the second period, and 
Peter Stastny added a power-play goal in the third as the Quebec Nordiques 
surprised the Calgary Flames, 4-3, Saturday night at Quebec for their third 
straight victory. 
</P>
<P>
Mario Gosselin stopped 35 shots for the Nordiques, who beat the powerful Flames 
for the first time in 3 games and achieved their longest winning streak of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting ahead early and we're not having to make up deficits," Gosselin 
said. "And we're playing better when we have a lead. We're not pulling back and 
letting the other team take the game away from us." 
</P>
<P>
The Nordiques went 9 games without a victory before embarking on their winning 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Hunter scored at 18:40 of the final period to get the Flames close, but 
Gosselin held them off in the final 80 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Quebec took a 2-0 lead on goals by Mario Marois and Michel Goulet in the first 
period, but the Flames got even on goals by Theoren Fleury and Joel Otto before 
the period ended. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 7, Edmonton 4 -- Mario Lemieux scored 2 goals and had 5 assists as 
the Penguins downed the Oilers at Edmonton, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just one of those games where everything went in," said Lemieux, who 
increased his league-leading totals to 52 goals and 77 assists for 129 points. 
</P>
<P>
Lemieux has been involved in each of the Penguins' last 12 goals over a 3-game 
span, scoring 3 and assisting on 9. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Coffey, traded by the Oilers to Pittsburgh last season, added a goal and 2 
assists as the Penguins won for only the second time in 16 career visits to the 
Northlands Coliseum and moved into second place in the Patrick Division, 1 
point ahead of the Washington Capitals. They remain 3 points behind the New 
York Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 4, Toronto 3 -- Guy Carbonneau scored 2 goals, and Mats Naslund was 
credited with a goal that the Maple Leafs accidentally knocked into their own 
net as the Canadiens won at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
Defenseman Todd Gill scored 2 goals for the Maple Leafs, who set up a close 
finish when Mark Osborne's goal at 13:43 of the third period pulled them to 
within a goal. 
</P>
<P>
A goal by Toronto's Tom Fergus was disallowed moments later because referee 
Kerry Fraser had called an interference penalty on the Leafs' Craig Laughlin. 
</P>
<P>
New York Rangers 5, Vancouver 4 -- Kelly Kisio scored from the crease just 1:59 
into overtime, and the Rangers slipped past the Canucks at Vancouver,Canada. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first victory for the Rangers in their last 19 overtime games. They 
were 0-1-17 in overtime games dating to March 4, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
New York rookie Tony Granato sent the game into overtime when he scored with 
12:03 left, his 10th goal in 6 games. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 7, Winnipeg 3 -- Goaltender Ron Hextall stopped 37 shots and 
assisted on Tim Kerr's third goal of the game as the Flyers defeated the Jets 
at Winnipeg,Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Hextall got his 21st victory and fifth assist of the season. 
</P>
<P>
The Jets trailed 4-3 after 2 periods, but the Flyers pulled away when Kerr 
scored twice in the first 8:02 of the final period. 
</P>
<P>
New York Islanders 8, Minnesota 6 -- Pat LaFontaine had 3 goals and 2 assists 
to lead the Islanders at Uniondale, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
The Islanders were outshot, 44-25, in the game, but scored 4 goals on 6 shots 
in a wide-open third period in which Dave Gagner had 3 goals for the North 
Stars. 
</P>
<P>
After Gagner's final goal got the North Stars close, Brad Dalgarno gave the 
Islanders the clincher. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo 6, Boston 5 -- Pierre Turgeon scored his second goal of the game on a 
power play with 1:02 left in overtime, and the Sabres rallied from 4 goals down 
to beat the Bruins at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Andreychuk of Buffalo, which tied Boston for second place in the Adams 
Division, scored on a rebound with 7 minutes 47 seconds left in the third 
period to tie the score, 5-5. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins had a 4-0 lead in the second period but lost it and are 0-4-1 in 
their last 5 games at Boston Garden. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 4, Chicago 2 -- Rookie Steve Tuttle scored the tiebreaking goal with 
17:27 left, and Peter Zezel added the winning goal 3 1/2 minutes later as the 
Blues beat the Blackhawks at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago made it close on Steve Larmer's 14th power-play goal of the season with 
3:54 left, but Rick Meagher scored into an empty net for St. Louis with 18 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Zezel and Bernie Federko each had 2 assists for the Blues, who are 4-1 against 
Chicago this season.

Olympic gold medalist Meldrick Taylor stopped John Wesley Meekins after 7 
rounds at Atlantic City, N.J., to retain the International Boxing Federation 
junior welterweight title. 
</P>
<P>
Meekins (20-2-2), of West Hempstead, N.Y., couldn't answer the bell for the 
eighth round because his right eye was closed, and there was a bad swelling 
under his left eye and a cut over the left eye. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor (21-0-1), of Philadelphia, has won 9 straight fights and has recorded 15 
knockouts in his career. He was cut over the left eye by an accidental head 
butt in the second round, but cut man Ace Marotta kept the gash from becoming a 
factor.

It's only the warm-up to the big event, but today's 11th annual Redondo Beach 
Super Bowl 10K run takes pride in its party-before-the-party reputation. 
</P>
<P>
The race, which drew 15,000 runners last year, features two world-class runners 
in the men's race. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Cram of Great Britain, the world-record holder in the mile, said he will 
approach the race as a training run. 
</P>
<P>
Also entered is Alejandro Cruz of Mexico, who was the surprise winner of the 
Chicago Marathon last fall. Cruz, who trains in Boulder, Colo., also considers 
the race a training run. 
</P>
<P>
Jacqueline Hansen of Santa Monica, former marathon world-record holder, is 
entered in the women's division. 
</P>
<P>
The race has gained a reputation as a running party in which football fans get 
some exercise before an afternoon of watching the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Today's race will include hundreds of costumed runners, centipede running teams 
and a handful of six-pack teams. 
</P>
<P>

RACING AT SANTA ANITA; 
</P>
<P>
VICTORY BY GOODBYE HALO IN EL ENCINO MAKES FOR A HAPPY DAY 
</P>

<P>
Pat Day inadvertently lost the mount on Goodbye Halo midway through last year, 
but he's not about to let it happen again. 
</P>
<P>
On Goodbye Halo's back for the first time since the filly and the jockey won 
the Kentucky Oaks last May at Churchill Downs, Day rode her to a half-length 
win over T.V. of Crystal in the $104,700 El Encino Stakes Saturday before a 
crowd of 8,956 at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
Savannah's Honor was third, 1 1/2 lengths behind Goodbye Halo, and it was 
another 2 lengths back to Variety Baby in a race reduced to 4 starters by the 
scratch of Seattle Smooth. 
</P>
<P>
After Goodbye Halo's victory in the Kentucky Oaks, the 4-year-old daughter of 
Halo and Pound Foolish, a Sir Ivor mare, won 2 more major races with Jorge 
Velasquez in the saddle. At the end of the year, Eddie Delahoussaye rode 
Goodbye Halo in 4 losing races, 3 of those on grass -- a surface the filly has 
shown she doesn't like. 
</P>
<P>
Day, fourth in the national jockey standings last year, probably would have 
added to his $11.6-million purse total had he not been separated from Goodbye 
Halo. A month after the Kentucky Oaks, the 35-year-old rider took a call on 
another filly, Costly Shoes, for the Mother Goose at Belmont Park, because he 
heard that Goodbye Halo was going to run in a grass race at Hollywood Park the 
same weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, trainer Charlie Whittingham ran Goodbye Halo in the Mother Goose and 
she won for Velasquez. Day finished seventh aboard Costly Shoes. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll work overtime to see that I stay with her the rest of this year," Day 
said Saturday, after Goodbye Halo won for the 9th time in 16 starts, earned 
$60,200 and increased her career earnings to almost $1.3 million for co-owners 
Arthur Hancock III and Alex G. Campbell Jr. Her time for the 1 1/16 miles was 
1:41 4/5, which was the same time Lady's Secret posted in the stake in 1986, en 
route to horse-of-the-year honors. 
</P>
<P>
All 4 of the 4-year-old fillies in the El Encino held the lead at one time or 
another. T.V. of Crystal broke the fastest and after a half-mile she dropped 
back to second behind Variety Baby. 
</P>
<P>
Toward the end of the backstretch, Savannah's Honor dragged Gary Stevens 
through a hole between the 2 leaders and shot to the front. Goodbye Halo and 
Day, not far back at any point, were also moving by then. Goodbye Halo, 
carrying 124 pounds to T.V. of Crystal's 117, was closing on the outside and 
she collared the leader inside the eighth pole. 
</P>
<P>
"After that, she got a little leg-weary," Day said. "But she does what's 
necessary to win. She had been off 6 weeks and was carrying a lot of weight. 
But one thing you know about Charlie -- when he sends a horse over, you know 
they're ready and you can ride them with a fair amount of confidence." 
</P>
<P>
Both Day and Chris McCarron, who rode T.V. of Crystal, had been on vacation 
before they resumed riding Saturday. Day was riding snowmobiles at his mother's 
farm in Colorado, and McCarron had been skiing in Utah. 
</P>
<P>
"My filly ran dynamite," McCarron said. "She gave it everything she had. At the 
five-sixteenths pole, I thought I might be riding for third, but at the eighth 
pole I thought I still might win it. Then Goodbye Halo just put it in 
overdrive." 
</P>
<P>
Stevens had trouble getting Savannah's Honor to relax in the French-raced 
filly's third U.S. start. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't really want to be on the lead down the backstretch," Stevens said. "I 
was happy where I was, in third, but Pat (and Goodbye Halo) came up on her hip, 
and she just took off between horses." 
</P>
<P>
After winning the first race she ever ran, last June at Hollywood Park, T.V. of 
Crystal won 2 stakes and wound up earning $120,000 for trainer Donn Luby. 
</P>
<P>
After the El Encino, Luby was being sarcastic. "She's better than an empty 
stall," he said. "She couldn't run any better than she did today. She never had 
a breather, they all took a shot at her. She should be tough coming back." 
</P>
<P>
Goodbye Halo will try to win the seventh major race of her career when she runs 
in the $200,000 La Canada at Santa Anita on Feb. 4. The day before, Day, who 
rides mainly in the Midwest, will be in Arkansas to ride on the opening card at 
Oaklawn Park. That shouldn't interfere with his travel plans to Los Angeles. 
He'd take a snowmobile here just for the chance to ride Goodbye Halo again. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Putting, whose record has been punctuated by more second-place finishes than 
victories in the past year, will be favored today in the San Marcos Handicap. 
Putting had 5 seconds and 2 wins in 13 starts last year and hasn't won since he 
took the San Marino Handicap last March. . . . Trainer Brian Mayberry, who has 
7 winners from 29 starters at the meeting, won Saturday with Pricey Mac, who 
paid $107.40, the highest win price of the season. A $50,000 claim last 
October, Pricey Mac hadn't won since early last year. . . . Another of 
Mayberry's winners, Sitting Appeal, is expected to run in the San Vicente for 
3-year-old colts Wednesday.

ICE FISHING FESTIVAL; 
</P>
<P>
25,000 WILL BRAVE COLD TO COMPETE ON A MICHIGAN LAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

HOUGHTON LAKE, Mich. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 25,000 fishermen are braving probable zero or subzero weather this 
weekend in the biggest ice-fishing derby in the nation. And there will be about 
that many here next weekend, too. 
</P>
<P>
It's the 39th annual Tip-Up Town, USA, Ice-Fishing Festival here on Houghton 
Lake, Michigan's biggest of more than 11,000 inland lakes. 
</P>
<P>
Tip-Ups are rigs that hold a reel and line set in a hole in the ice. They pop 
up a tiny red flag when a fish takes the bait, giving fishermen a signal that 
he has a bite. 
</P>
<P>
When the flag suddenly goes up, the action is on. Ice fishing is a skill sport. 
The fisherman has to have his line set at the proper distance beneath the ice. 
When the fish hits the bait and the spool stops, then starts again, it is time 
to set the hook and reel in the reluctant fish. 
</P>
<P>
Houghton Lake, 8 miles across and 16 miles long in the northern part of 
Michigan's Lower Peninsula, looks like a sieve, what with all those fishing 
holes. 
</P>
<P>
This tribute to the sport of ice fishing will also feature contests for the 
biggest fish, snowmobile races, ice sculpture competition, softball on ice, 
golf on ice and other esoteric activities. 
</P>
<P>
Fishing is the main attraction, though, and the fishermen take it seriously. 
Last year, the biggest northern pike caught during the Tip-Up Town contest was 
3 feet long and weighed 12 pounds 12 ounces. The biggest Walleye weighed 6-2 
and measured 23 1/2 inches. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, there was a big parade from Pinky's Plaza Shopping Center onto the 
lake with several elaborate floats made of crepe paper -- no Rose Parade floats 
with flowers in this icebox. Many floats were in the shape of huge walleyes, 
northerns, bluegills, perch and other lake fish. 
</P>
<P>
A carnival with a Ferris wheel is going on and there was a big dance inside a 
heated tent. Concession stands are strategically located on the ice, offering 
refreshments and souvenirs to those who come to fish and to those who come to 
watch those who fish. 
</P>
<P>
Houghton Lake Postmaster Ruth Coons is operating a portable post office on the 
ice and all letters posted here are canceled with a special Tip-Up Town, USA, 
Ice Festival postmark. 
</P>
<P>
Houghton Lake is the heart of winter recreation country in Michigan, the hub of 
a network of 5,400 miles of groomed snowmobile trails. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands have brought their snowmobiles to the ice-fishing festival from all 
corners of the state. Michigan has 205,000 registered snowmobiles, more than 
any other state. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan recently spent $2.5 million on 42 new snow grooming machines for the 
trails. This year, the state will spend another $2.5 million for trail grooming 
-- $1.5 million from gasoline taxes, $1 million from registration fees. There 
are five times more miles of groomed snowmobile trails than freeways for cars 
in this state. 
</P>
<P>
In Houghton Lake, population 7,000, there are 16 sporting goods stores catering 
to the needs of ice fishermen, selling live bait -- minnows and suckers -- 
canvas shelters ($180) with room enough to protect two fishermen from the 
elements, tip-ups, weights, line, hooks, jigging lures and other equipment. 
</P>
<P>
At shops such as Linda and Dave Perkins' Edgewater Beach Marina, fishermen can 
rent the tiny ice-fishing houses, called shanties, for $12 a day, including a 
propane heater and fuel. Hand warmers, at $3 a pop, are also a popular item. 
</P>
<P>
"The ice is nice and thick -- 10 inches thick clear across the lake now," 
informs Linda Perkins. "It should hold a car or pickup with no trouble, unless 
the vehicle falls through a pressure crack." 
</P>
<P>
She quickly adds: "If your car goes through the ice, we'll gladly haul it out 
of the drink for $2,500. That's as cheap as anybody on the lake." 
</P>
<P>
A winter doesn't pass without at least a dozen cars sinking to the bottom. The 
lake is 18 feet at its deepest. Ice-fishing season here generally runs from 
about mid-December until the end of March. 
</P>
<P>
It was 10 above zero, the wind-chill factor making it 10 below, a few days 
before the ice festival when 45 members of the Lansing Police Dept. were at 
Houghton Lake for their 12th-annual one-day ice-fishing contest. They drove 120 
miles to get here. 
</P>
<P>
"We come up ahead of the mob. It's too crowded for us during the Tip-Up Town, 
USA, Ice Festival weekends," explained Bob Delamarter, 34, traffic officer for 
the department. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Jim Heyden, 50, said he has been ice fishing every winter of his life 
that he can remember. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like fishing out of a boat," he said. "I like walking on water." 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Joe Rodriguez, one of three Latinos on the Lansing PD -- he came north 
from San Benito, Tex. -- said it was a pleasure to join the troops on Houghton 
Lake for the camaraderie, the great ice fishing and to get away from the 
pressures of the big city. 
</P>
<P>
Big city? Lansing's population is 130,000. All things are relative, of course. 
</P>
<P>
The Lansing officers kept warm by ducking into their shanties and by wolfing 
down bowls of steaming hot chili. They wore "water snake" logos showing a 
tip-up and an ice fisherman embraced by a snake coiled around his body. 
</P>
<P>
"Ice fishermen call the (immature) northern pike snakes," said officer John 
Hunnell, who recalled the big controversy that occurred in one of the recent 
annual outings: 
</P>
<P>
"A fish took my line and reel under the ice. Officer Don Dunham was fishing 
nearby. It was moments before the 5 p.m. deadline to stop fishing. Dunham's 
hook caught my reel. He pulled in my line and the biggest fish of the day which 
I, not Dunham, originally caught. 
</P>
<P>
"I claimed the fish. I was overruled. Dunham walked away with the giant fish 
and all the money." 
</P>
<P>
Brandon Temple, 16-year-old son of detective Deane Temple, was the ice auger 
man, spudding new holes for the officers with his 7-foot-long auger. 
</P>
<P>
When a reporter's four pens all froze and note-taking became impossible, 
Lansing's finest roared. 
</P>
<P>
"Now you know what we go through in the cold," Sgt. Daryl Zuk said, laughing. 
"Many a time an officer starts writing a ticket and can't go on. His pen is 
frozen. Sometimes he lets the guy go." 
</P>
<P>
Detective Charlie Shawnee and others mentioned Magic Johnson, whose hometown is 
Lansing. 
</P>
<P>
"Tell our friend Magic to come join us next year. We'll teach him how to 
dribble snowballs," laughed Shawnee. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the guys from LAPD ought to join us, too. They would never believe 
this. Never believe we would rather be doing this than sitting at home beside a 
fire, watching TV." 
</P>
<P>
By midday, Deane Battley, Mike Foster, Tim Heyden, Charlie Shawnee, Daryl Zuk 
and Paul Wilkins had reeled in the biggest "snakes," northern pike 20 inches to 
2 feet long. 
</P>
<P>
A short distance away, dairy farmer Keith De Ruiter, 38, and his three sons, 
Wes, 8, Todd, 10, and Matt, 15, stood near their pickup truck, a half-mile out 
in the ice, waiting for a nibble. 
</P>
<P>
"We ice-fish as often as we can get away," said De Ruiter. "There is no better 
eating in the world than walleye and northern pike. The fish is firmer and 
tastes better, caught through the ice in winter than in summer." 
</P>
<P>
Thirty below zero isn't uncommon in this part of the country. Yet, the cold and 
miserable weather do not discourage the hearty ice fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
Braving the elements is part of the sport they say. The catch is well worth the 
trouble they insist.

</P>
<P>
INVITES DEMOCRATIC, GOP LEADERS TO MEETING ON DEFICIT

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush dove eagerly into his new job Saturday, inviting Democratic and 
Republican congressional leaders to a federal budget summit on Tuesday, then 
joyfully sampling the many facets of White House life, from the Oval Office to 
the sun-soaked lawns. 
</P>
<P>
Bush dispatched a letter to the congressional leaders, addressing them by their 
first names and inviting them to the budget meeting. The letter, in which he 
proposed that he and they also look for ways to move toward a bipartisan 
approach on foreign policy issues, reflected a campaign commitment to begin 
attacking the federal budget deficit, which was $155.1 billion in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Speech to Congress 
</P>
<P>
"I look forward to our working together on these critical issues," he wrote. 
Bush is scheduled to spell out specific budget initiatives in a speech to 
Congress on Feb. 9. 
</P>
<P>
But with that matter dispatched, Bush ebulliently sampled many facets of the 
presidency, exploring the White House he sought for so long -- he got lost 
Friday night "trying to find a couple of kids' rooms" -- and trying out his 
desk in the Oval Office. 
</P>
<P>
There were congratulations to be answered -- Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev dispatched to Bush a brief note pledging to work toward a period of 
"stable and diverse development of relations between our countries." 
</P>
<P>
There was a fresh plea for the freedom of nine Americans taken hostage in 
Lebanon over the last four years -- to the groups, believed to be supported by 
Iran, that are holding the hostages, the President issued the reminder that 
"good will begets good will," a suggestion that their release would be met by 
improved U.S. relations. 
</P>
<P>
There were matters of government to be dispatched -- Bush signed the papers 
appointing 16 senior staff members to their White House posts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Celebrates With Family 
</P>
<P>
But mostly, Saturday was a day to stretch out and celebrate the arrival of the 
Bush Administration with the enthusiasm of a child in a candy shop -- first 
with family members, then with fellow Texans in black-tie and boots, and 
finally at a rhythm and blues concert in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
On his first full day in office, the new President, bubbling with enthusiasm, 
could not be contained. And so, he: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Welcomed the first dozen or so of 4,500 tourists who trooped through the 
formal rooms of the executive mansion in a sort of White House open house. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Showed his 87-year-old mother, Dorothy Walker Bush, the Oval Office, where 
he held an informal news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Conferred there with Chief of Staff John H. Sununu and received a national 
security briefing from CIA Director William H. Webster and National Security 
Adviser Brent Scowcroft. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Explored the two presidential studies next-door to the office, walked out 
to the patio and peeked at the covered swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Traveled to the State Department to speak with contributors who helped 
finance the inaugural celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Led a gaggle of family members on an exploration of the expansive White 
House South Lawn and a glimpse of the tennis court, insisting that a duo of 
Bush sons could take on tennis pros Pam Shriver and Chris Evert. 
</P>
<P>
And then it was noon. 
</P>
<P>
In flocked 240 or so relatives -- nephews and nieces, cousins and cousins' 
in-laws, not to mention the four generations of immediate family members who 
spent the night at the White House, all 23 of them -- for the First Family's 
first lunch in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
Bush arrived at the Oval Office for the first time as President a few minutes 
before 9 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Finds a Special Note 
</P>
<P>
He sat down at the desk and found his chair too low, tipped it over and raised 
it. He checked the drawers of his desk, discovering the handwritten note left 
for him in the top center drawer by the office's previous occupant. He read it 
to reporters who were invited in a few minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
On stationery decorated by a drawing of an elephant under attack by a flock of 
turkeys, Ronald Reagan had written: 
</P>
<P>
"Dear George, 
</P>
<P>
"You'll have moments when you want to use this particular stationery. Well, go 
to it. George, I treasure the memories we share and wish you all the very best. 
You'll be in my prayers. God bless you and Barbara. I'll miss our Thursday 
lunches. Ron." 
</P>
<P>
Bush confessed he was unable to find another note Reagan was said to have left 
in a dressing room, "over where the underwear goes." 
</P>
<P>
Later, in an address to the inaugural contributors, Bush continued to offer 
Congress the olive branch he extended in his inaugural address, saying that if 
approached "properly with the Congress, without rancor," the deficit problem 
can be solved, although he said, "we're not expecting miracles." 
</P>
<P>
The President, who has adopted a particularly cautious approach to foreign 
policy matters since he was elected on Nov. 8, was nevertheless sunny in his 
survey in this area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Talks of Presidential Power 
</P>
<P>
"I think I come in with a stronger hand now and I think the horizon is bright," 
he said. But twice -- at the State Department and in his comments to reporters 
in the Oval Office -- he addressed the need for a bipartisanship and expressed 
concern about "the erosion of presidential power, particularly in the field of 
national defense and foreign policy." 
</P>
<P>
Of the hostages in the Middle East, he said he recognized that "you can't 
finger any one country for holding Americans hostage against their will." 
</P>
<P>
"People have, in the past, facilitated the release of our citizens, and I'd 
love to see that happen again," he said. "And I won't forget it." 
</P>
<P>
As soon as Bush returned from his short motorcade to the State Department, he 
led his children and grandchildren on a 100-yard hike down the gentle slope of 
the South Lawn to see the tennis court, and then tossed a football on the walk 
back up the lawn. 
</P>
<P>
"Where should we put the horseshoe pit?" he asked, turning first to an aide and 
then to a Secret Service agent. They gave the same answer to the President of 
the United States: Anywhere you want. 
</P>
<P>
"See that squirrel up there?" he said, pointing to a creature atop the 
backboard. "When Millie gets here, he's history." Millie is the family's 
pregnant English springer spaniel, who is in Kentucky after having been mated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Issues Playful Command 
</P>
<P>
To a grandchild who wanted to run up to the second-floor Truman Balcony to wave 
to the rest of the family on the lawn, he playfully issued a command to move 
quickly, because "I'm the only guy waving from that balcony." 
</P>
<P>
As the day usually does for Bush, according to aides, this one began at 6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 10 grandchildren who spent the night in the White House, "one got sick, 
so I had the duty at about 6 a.m. this morning . . . pumped a half a Tylenol 
into her, and she's looking good," he said. The ill child was Nancy Ellis 
LeBlond -- 2-year-old Ellie, who starred in a campaign commercial. 
</P>
<P>
In the Oval Office, Bush confessed that "I couldn't wait to come over here this 
morning." And he said of his new life in the White House: "It's so exciting 
over there." 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in the Oval Office during his brief session with reporters, he chose 
the white, upholstered wing chair to the left of the fireplace, the one he sat 
in when meeting with Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
Introducing his mother, seated in Reagan's chair to the right, Bush, mindful of 
manners and tennis skills, said: "This is the one that told me not to brag 
about myself and to bend my knees when I volleyed." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Waves From Window 
</P>
<P>
The public day began at 7:52 a.m., when Bush slid back a protective glass 
covering, raised a window and waved from an upstairs study to several hundred 
people on the White House driveway awaiting the start of what was billed as an 
inaugural open house but was really the daily tour of the first floor of the 
executive mansion. He carefully closed the window, with an electronic switch, 
and slid the protective glass back in place. 
</P>
<P>
Some in the crowd had been waiting outside the gates since 8:30 p.m. Friday and 
they trooped sedately through the White House lugging blankets and sleeping 
bags. 
</P>
<P>
The President and First Lady Barbara Bush joined the first group on the tour, 
led by White House curator Rex Scouten. One person is assigned full time, he 
informed the President and the tourists, to clean the windows and chandeliers.

SLAIN BRAZILIAN BECOMES SYMBOL; 
</P>
<P>
BATTLE FOR HUGE AMAZON FOREST IS TURNING DEADLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

XAPURI, Brazil 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Francisco Mendes, 44, grew up in the forest and spent most of his life plying 
its shaded paths, gathering natural latex and Brazil nuts to earn a meager 
living. 
</P>
<P>
Like thousands of other rubber tappers in the Amazon basin, Mendes loved the 
peace and tranquillity of forest life. His conservation efforts earned him an 
international reputation -- and perhaps caused his death. 
</P>
<P>
When a 20-gauge shotgun blast killed Mendes last Dec. 22, Xapuri rubber tappers 
lost their leader -- and the Amazon conservation movement lost one of its most 
effective spokesmen. But here in Mendes' native state of Acre, rubber tappers 
and conservationists have much cause for hope. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to what is happening in some other parts of the Amazon, where the 
forest is being slashed and burned at an alarming rate, those who want to save 
Acre's forest seem to be winning. 
</P>
<P>
In the 3,000 square miles of Xapuri township, for example, only 133 acres of 
forest were destroyed last year. In some cases, demonstrations organized by 
Mendes' Rural Workers Union stopped chain-saw crews before they could start 
cutting. 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, the rate of deforestation has declined sharply in recent years, and 
the state government has adopted a policy that strongly discourages the 
conversion of forest into ranchland. Some officials in Rio Branco, the state 
capital, say that increasingly successful conservation efforts in Acre could 
serve as a model for the rest of the Amazon basin. 
</P>
<P>
The basin is drained by the biggest river system in the world and is blanketed 
by the Earth's largest tropical rain forest. Scientists say the forest plays a 
vital role in atmospheric and climatic conditions around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
In Brazil, the Amazon basin covers 2 million square miles, a region 12 times as 
large as California. According to rough estimates based on satellite surveys, 
as much as 30,000 square miles of virgin Amazon forest are being destroyed in 
Brazil every year as roadways, cattle ranching, farming, logging, mining and 
hydroelectric projects spread through the region. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Isolated Area 
</P>
<P>
Acre, remote and isolated in Brazil's far west, has lost only 6% of its forest, 
which once virtually covered the state's 59,000 square miles. Most of Acre's 
deforestation has been on the eastern wing-tip of the butterfly-shaped state, 
around Rio Branco and along the road to Xapuri and Brasileia near the Bolivian 
border. A road network that was planned to lace the rest of Acre has not been 
built because of lack of funds. 
</P>
<P>
About 80% of the state's territory is privately owned, and pressure is strong 
for spreading pastureland into the wilderness. It was this kind of pressure 
that Francisco Mendes was resisting. 
</P>
<P>
Known by the nickname Chico, Mendes was the son of a rubber tapper and began 
tapping rubber trees himself at age 9. He never went beyond fourth grade in 
school but received an informal education from a Communist and one-time army 
lieutenant who had participated in a ragtag rebel army's long march through 
Brazil's hinterlands in the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a very good ideological base from that guy," said Gumersindo Rodrigues, 
29, who worked closely with Mendes in the union. Mendes helped found the union 
and served on the Xapuri municipal council in the late 1970s. He also founded a 
local branch of the Marxist-oriented Workers' Party. For Mendes, the causes of 
socialism, unionism and ecology all placed him in direct opposition to the big 
landowners and ranchers. 
</P>
<P>
When the Rural Workers Union heard that a landowner had sent a crew to clear a 
piece of forest, the union would muster its members and their families to 
create an empate, or standoff. Dozens, even hundreds, of men, women and 
children would gather around the cutting crew and prevent it from starting the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Killing Threatened 
</P>
<P>
In one such action last year, the union prevented brothers Alvarino and Darly 
Alves da Silva from starting work on a road into their isolated ranch outside 
the town of Xapuri. The ranchers had threatened to kill the union leader, 
Xapuri residents say. 
</P>
<P>
Mendes did not take it as an idle threat. He and Rodrigues, his friend and 
union associate, had learned of an outstanding warrant in the southern state of 
Parana charging the Alves da Silva brothers with ordering the killing of two 
rural workers there. Mendes and Rodrigues had the warrant transferred to 
Xapuri, and the brothers went into hiding. Mendes was put under police 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
Two police guards were eating a fish dinner in Mendes' rustic Xapuri home Dec. 
22 when Mendes opened the door on his way to take a shower in an outbuilding. 
Mendes was shot in the chest; he staggered back into the house and died. 
</P>
<P>
The police began looking for members of the Alves da Silva family. Darly and 
two of his sons turned themselves in. One of them, Darcy, confessed to pulling 
the trigger. The police are still searching the jungle for Alvarino Alves da 
Silva and three hired pistoleiros said to be with him. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Brazil Nut Trees Survive 
</P>
<P>
Xapuri is about 50 miles from the border by the BR-317, a rutted, red-dirt road 
that becomes impassable after heavy rains. Most of the road from Xapuri to Rio 
Branco, a stretch of about 110 miles, is paved. It is flanked by ranches on 
rolling land, grassy pastures dotted with stumps and, occasionally, a 
green-topped castanheira, a Brazil nut tree. 
</P>
<P>
The castanheiras were left standing because government regulations prohibit 
their being cut down. But in isolation from the forest they are usually sterile 
-- towering but useless reminders of an ineffectual official gesture. 
</P>
<P>
Xapuri (pronounced shah-poo-REE) was once the capital of Acre, long before the 
territory became a state. Its brick and asphalt streets are lined with wood 
houses, many of them on stilts. One of the biggest buildings in town has been 
preserved as a landmark. It was the headquarters of the Bolivian provincial 
government before Brazil bought Acre in 1903. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rubber Barons 
</P>
<P>
That was at the time of the rubber boom, when Amazon latex fed burgeoning tire 
industries in the United States and Europe. Rubber barons made huge fortunes 
from the sticky sap that jungle workers painstakingly tapped from the trees, 
cutting groove after groove in a slanting pattern down the stout trunks. 
</P>
<P>
Tappers made their rounds on forest paths just as they do today. During the 
rainy season, they gather pods of Brazil nuts, and between seasons they 
cultivate corn, beans and cassava in small jungle clearings. Most tappers still 
live in thatch-roofed shacks deep in the forest, far from civilization. 
</P>
<P>
After the BR-317 came to Xapuri and cattle ranches began spreading out from the 
road, hundreds of rubber tappers were forced to abandon their source of 
livelihood, the forest. Others sold their tapping rights, discouraged by 
depressed rubber prices. Today, many former tappers live in the slums of Rio 
Branco, trying to make a living as unskilled laborers, but an estimated 120,000 
of the state's 380,000 people are still rubber tappers and their dependents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Resisting Ranchers 
</P>
<P>
The Rural Workers Union of Xapuri was formed to resist the encroachment of 
cattle ranching and to improve the lot of rubber tappers as well as ranch 
hands. Many of the tappers have little opportunity to participate in union 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
"The most distant ones stay out years and years without coming into town," 
Rodrigues said. But he said 600 of the estimated 3,000 rubber tappers in Xapuri 
township are active union members, dedicated to preserving the forest. 
</P>
<P>
"Between death from hunger in the city and death from fighting for the forest, 
we will die fighting for the forest," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rodrigues and others who lived and worked with Mendes are clear about who their 
enemies are: the ranchers. 
</P>
<P>
"They meant to finish off the forest, and Chico defended it," said Mendes' 
widow, Ilzamar. "They didn't accept that." 
</P>
<P>
Gilson Pescador, a Xapuri labor organizer and former priest, said that Mendes' 
killing was planned as an attack on the conservation movement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Tree in the Cause 
</P>
<P>
"That was the motive, to end the movement, to end the resistance," Pescador 
told a visitor in the offices of the Workers' Party. 
</P>
<P>
Pescador wore a new T-shirt that said, "They cut down one of the leafiest trees 
in the Amazon cause and the union movement. Chico Mendes, from your example 
other bold plants will spring, until the entire Earth is green." 
</P>
<P>
In Rio Branco, landowner Sergio Figueiredo argued that there can be forest 
conservation in Acre along with the development of ranching and farming. 
</P>
<P>
"There is room for everyone here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The law limits landowners to clearing the forest from no more than 50% of their 
property, but Figueiredo said that an average of only about 20% of large 
ranches have been deforested. 
</P>
<P>
Figueiredo, 36, said that most Acre residents want new roads and increased food 
production, which would reduce the remote state's high cost of living and 
provide new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
People 'Need to Be Fed' 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that Acre, one of the most fertile parts of Brazil, cannot be kept 
just to be admired when there are residents who need to be fed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Figueiredo, the slaying of Mendes was the result of a "strictly 
personal" dispute between Mendes and the Alves da Silva family. Mendes' friends 
and associates say it was part of a violent conflict between rubber tappers and 
others who want to preserve the forest and ranchers who want to destroy it. The 
struggle has cost several other lives in Acre, they say. 
</P>
<P>
But Figueiredo said that when a rubber tapper is killed in a personal quarrel, 
"ranchers are always seen as the guilty ones. . . . There is a political 
interest in throwing the working class up against the landowner class." 
</P>
<P>
The ranchers' point of view was supported by the Acre state government until 
1986, when Flaviano Melo was elected governor. Melo, a member of the centrist 
Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, is the first governor in the Amazon region 
to adopt a clearly conservationist policy. His main adviser on economic 
development, Gilberto Siqueira, heads the Acre State Technological Foundation, 
which has drawn up a plan for exploiting the forest while preserving it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
22 Research Projects 
</P>
<P>
The foundation is conducting 22 research projects on forest management, use of 
forest products and technology for extraction. In addition to latex and Brazil 
nuts, Siqueira said, Acre's forests abound with valuable woods, oils, resins, 
fruits and medicinal plants. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the ranchers' contention that Acre's soil is fertile, Siqueira said 
studies have shown that it is weak and not suitable for agriculture. He said 
much pastureland cleared in the 1970s will no longer support grass and is being 
taken over by weeds. 
</P>
<P>
The key to preserving the forest, according to Siqueira, is to make it 
economically productive. The state has recently created four "extractive 
reserves" totaling more than 700,000 acres that cannot be deforested. More 
reserves will be set aside, he said. At the same time, Siqueira's foundation is 
trying to bring about the creation of industries in Rio Branco that will use 
rubber, selected hardwoods and other forest products for manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe in any ecological proposal that doesn't translate into an 
economic answer," he said in an interview. "You cannot preserve the forest and 
let it sit static."

MOURNERS SEEK SOLACE AT RITES FOR SLAIN CHILDREN

STOCKTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every Saturday in recent months, 6-year-old Thuy Tran took her place among the 
other members of the youth group at St. Luke's Catholic church to celebrate 
Mass. This time, the group gathered for another Mass at St. Luke's, a funeral 
Mass for little Thuy Tran. 
</P>
<P>
More than 600 people gathered at St. Luke's to honor the Vietnamese girl in one 
of three services conducted in Stockton on Saturday in memory of the five 
Southeast Asian refugee schoolchildren slain Tuesday by gunman Patrick Edward 
Purdy, who then took his own life. 
</P>
<P>
The congregation at St. Luke's sang haunting Vietnamese songs of mourning, 
after observing a minute of silence to honor the five children who died. Four 
were girls, Thuy Tran, Ram Chun, 8, Oeun Lim, 8, and Sokhim An, 6, and one was 
a 9-year-old boy, Rathanar Or. All but Tran were of Cambodian descent. 
</P>
<P>
After a prayer that the physical wounds of the 30 others injured -- and the 
emotional wounds of the entire community -- will be healed, Nguyen Dang Sy, 
leader of the youth group, addressed the hushed congregation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Safety Is Not Possible' 
</P>
<P>
"Over the past 14 years, our people have looked for a country that would offer 
us shelter and safety," Sy said. "We realize that in a world such as ours, 
safety is not possible. 
</P>
<P>
"What we have found is something more important -- the love that people share 
here. . . . The tragedy that cut short Thuy Tran's innocent life is not in vain 
when the result is love for one another in the community." 
</P>
<P>
After the Roman Catholic ceremony, several hundred members of the congregation 
-- including members of Thuy Tran's family, wearing traditional white headbands 
of mourning -- marched in solemn procession from the church to the cemetery, 
about a mile away, where the little girl's body was entombed. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the family, including the girl's mother, Thin Tran, collapsed in 
tears at the crypt, and an elderly woman fainted. 
</P>
<P>
At Central United Methodist Church, where a memorial service was conducted for 
all the shooting victims, Patricia Busher, principal of Cleveland Elementary 
School, where the slaughter took place, offered a prayer "for the safety of 
children everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that every one of us needs to watch our children, to listen to our 
children and to know our children more closely . . . to look for signs of 
trouble," she said. "For I believe the man who did this terrible thing was a 
troubled child who grew to be a troubled adult." 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Fass, mayor of Stockton, expressed hope that her city can "take this 
time and turn it into a monument to a community that cares." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Buddhist Service 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. John Garamendi, the Democratic legislator whose 5th Senate District 
includes Stockton, told the refugees that Americans are truly sorry for what 
happened "and we pledge to all of you who came to this state and to this great 
nation to never let this happen again." 
</P>
<P>
A Buddhist funeral service was conducted at a Stockton mortuary for Rathanar Or 
and Oeun Lim. Barefoot monks, clad in saffron robes, chanted traditional 
prayers as about 100 mourners sat quietly, palms joined in prayer. The brief, 
open-casket service was conducted entirely in the Cambodian language. 
</P>
<P>
Funeral services for Ram Chun and Sokhim An will be conducted here today. 
</P>
<P>
All physical signs of the tragedy had been erased at the school by Saturday, 
except for a single bunch of roses, a few coins and a brief note, placed at the 
base of the concrete slab marked "Cleveland." 
</P>
<P>
"God loves you," the note said.

LOTTO CRAZE PUTS PRIZE AT $40.7 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROXANE ARNOLD, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
A torrent of ticket-buying that swelled the California Lotto jackpot to $40.7 
million ended Saturday just before 8 p.m. when lottery officials announced the 
six winning numbers -- 11, 12, 16, 31, 34, 37 and a bonus number of 17. 
</P>
<P>
Although it will not be known until today whether there was a winner -- or 
winners -- among the hordes of ticket buyers who flooded Lotto 6/49 retailers 
throughout the state, the prospect of riches was enough to propel a steady 
stream of gamblers to plunk down their money from San Diego north to the Oregon 
border in the days before the drawing. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the lines at some retailers were 40 deep. But most of the players 
seemed happy to wait, genuinely optimistic that they could buck the long-shot 
odds against them. 
</P>
<P>
"I could really use the money," said Rhoda Neal, 28, who rushed to buy six 
tickets before the Saturday night deadline of 7:45. "My $6 investment will give 
me as much of a chance as anyone else, right?" 
</P>
<P>
Sales were so rushed in anticipation of the drawing that lottery officials 
extended playing time an hour Friday night, the first time that had been done 
since last October's record $61.9-million jackpot. 
</P>
<P>
This jackpot -- the state's third largest -- reached such dizzying proportions 
because nobody picked the six winning numbers in three previous jackpots, and 
each was added to the Saturday total. When a jackpot worth $22.3 million went 
unclaimed after Wednesday's drawing, this latest episode of lottery fever was 
virtually assured. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going crazy down here," Christine Bazzi, manager of Ray's Liquor Center 
in San Diego, said before the drawing. "There are at least 40 people in line, 
all the way out the door." One group of buyers, she said, pooled their money to 
buy $1,500 in tickets. 
</P>
<P>
At George's Liquors in Chinatown, the daily average of 9,000 tickets already 
had been topped by noon. 
</P>
<P>
"It's doing real well, very busy," proprietor George Lee said during the buying 
rush. But sadly, he added, the customers, for the most part, had only one 
purchase in mind. 
</P>
<P>
"Just lotto tickets, nothing else," Lee lamented. 
</P>
<P>
Although other Lotto 6/49 outlets were less crowded at times, the hopefuls who 
visited them were no less single-minded. 
</P>
<P>
"I walked up and bought four quick picks," said one player at a South Pasadena 
liquor store. "I figured somebody has a chance to win. It might as well be me." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm on my knees . . . praying," said another, who bought his "usual two" at a 
grocery store in Highland Park. "I want to buy some skis. And this is the only 
way I can afford them. They're $410. If I win, then I'd buy the condo to go 
with it." 
</P>
<P>
For all the players, the moment of truth came when a mechanical juggling device 
in Sacramento spit out six of its 49 Ping-Pong balls, each one identified by a 
number. 
</P>
<P>
All those who picked five numbers plus the bonus number will share a prize pool 
of $4.94 million; five of six will divide $2.54 million; four of six will share 
$2.31 million. Three of six pays $5.

GRIEVING STOCKTON STARTS HEALING PROCESS

<P>
Fat City is in mourning. 
</P>
<P>
This tough Delta town is trying to cope with a deep and terrible grief over the 
slaughter of its innocent children. 
</P>
<P>
This weekend at places of worship all over Stockton -- Catholic, Baptist, 
Methodist, Buddhist and Unitarian -- prayers are being offered not only for the 
victims of Tuesday's carnage, but for the community at large. 
</P>
<P>
Ministers and priests, as well as civic leaders and others, said they are 
urging the residents of this often maligned city to search within themselves to 
see what the schoolyard slaughter tells them about themselves and their 
society, about the importance of child-rearing and the repugnance of racism. 
</P>
<P>
Few in Stockton believe the horror at Cleveland Elementary School -- in which 
an emotionally disturbed drifter named Patrick Edward Purdy used a military 
assault rifle to kill five children and wound 30 other people in an apparently 
random attack -- bared a problem unique to their town. While there have been 
reports that Purdy hated Vietnamese, police say he hated all races, and his 
motive for the attack on the predominately Southeast Asian students remains 
unclear. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Positive Effects 
</P>
<P>
Many here hope the tragedy can be turned to some good and used to force people 
here to face some of the problems Stockton shares with other American cities -- 
racial tensions, broken families, declining values and the widening gulf 
between rich and poor. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know that we will ever understand why such a thing occurred," said 
Father Aloys Gruber, a pastor at St. Luke's Catholic Church, which lost a 
6-year-old parishioner to Purdy's gunfire. "All we can do from here is go on 
and try to draw the community together so that there might be a healing 
process. " 
</P>
<P>
Stockton is the site of the novel and movie "Fat City," which depicted 
small-time boxing and life on the town's once huge Skid Row. 
</P>
<P>
With a culturally diverse population of 190,000, growing ties to the San 
Francisco Bay Area and economic influence over a large part of the fertile San 
Joaquin Valley agricultural region, Stockton has long considered itself a city 
in the gritty, urban sense of the word. 
</P>
<P>
But the nightmare at Cleveland Elementary School showed it is still able to 
feel pain and face adversity as a much smaller town might. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the community started to come together less than two hours after 
Purdy attacked the children and then killed himself at 11:40 a.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Before 1 p.m., business executives, street people, police officers, 
firefighters, people of all ages, races and walks of life crowded into 
Stockton's Delta Blood Bank and rolled up their sleeves for the wounded 
children and teacher. 
</P>
<P>
"It really was a spontaneous event," said Dr. Benjamin Spindler, executive 
director of the facility. They arrived before he even appealed for aid, he 
added, and by Wednesday, the agency had received 270 pints of blood -- more 
than five times its normal intake -- from volunteers who waited uncomplaining 
for hours to make donations. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like they all knew why each one was there," Spindler said. "They were 
all in it together. . . . The people were all tied together in a community 
thing. It was really kind of moving." 
</P>
<P>
Stockton's residents also deluged the daily paper, the Stockton Record, with 
calls offering help. They also sent money to the paper for the victims. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Could Have Happened Anywhere' 
</P>
<P>
"I think the rampage could have happened anywhere," City Editor Richard Hanner 
said, "I don't think the response could have happened anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
American Savings Bank is collecting money for the victims and families at its 
branches throughout California and had raised about $25,000 by the end of the 
week. USAir and IBM are also raising money for the victims, and four local 
funds have been set up. The money is to be channeled through the San Joaquin 
County Victims-Witness Assistance Program. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's just wonderful, the support that the town has received from all 
parts of the world," said D. David Smith, executive vice president of the 
Greater Stockton Chamber of Commerce. "I think people realize that these things 
. . . can happen anywhere in the world. And I think they become much less 
provincial in their response to these crises." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the fact that the shootings occurred in a middle-class neighborhood on 
the city's near-northside -- not farther south, in the city's harsh, 
crime-ridden downtown -- has shaken people's sense of security throughout 
Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
"People I've been talking to -- adults as well as children -- are just scared," 
said the Rev. Robert Edward Green of the First Unitarian Church of Stockton. 
"They feel more and more at risk. People have been unwilling to go downtown for 
some time; now they are afraid to walk around their own neighborhood. To have 
this happen at an elementary school their own children might have attended has 
left people ferociously insecure." 
</P>
<P>
Such concerns are evident in talking to the people of Stockton -- a waitress, 
the mayor, a shoeshine stand operator, a priest, the chief of police. Even as 
they grieve for the children and comfort one another, they are trying without 
much success to make some sense of it all. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'My Heart Stopped' 
</P>
<P>
"When I heard the news, my heart stopped," said Lydia Rodriguez, whose first 
thought was for the safety of her daughter, who is a first-grader at a school 
several miles from Cleveland Elementary. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez, a waitress at a Ramada Inn coffee shop, said fear was so great 
immediately after the shooting that one of her fellow employees suggested that 
they teach their children in one of their homes rather than sending them to 
school. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez, who went to public school in Brooklyn, N.Y., said she and her 
husband moved to Stockton so their children would not be exposed to big city 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
"So they wouldn't have to go through what we went through," she said. "And then 
you find out it's everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Stockton Chief of Police Jack Calkins agreed to meet Saturday with Cambodian 
families concerned over their children's safety. Mayor Barbara Fass and School 
Supt. Mary Gonzales Mend also agreed to answer questions at the meeting, which 
was added to the end of a memorial service at the Central United Methodist 
Church, a few blocks from Cleveland Elementary. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Free Society' 
</P>
<P>
Calkins said he is struggling for a way to assure the families that such a 
shooting is not an everyday thing, that the children are safe. 
</P>
<P>
"But basically this is a free society," he said, "and law enforcement is not 
there to look over everyone's shoulder . . . and in a free society people like 
this (Purdy) are allowed to walk the streets." 
</P>
<P>
Vic Harris heard the news and pondered it, turning the facts like a prism, this 
way and that to see how the light shown through, trying to understand. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, who operates a shoeshine stand in a Stockton shopping mall, figured 
Purdy might have been a bitter Vietnam veteran, driven crazy by society's 
rejection. When he learned that Purdy was not a vet, he thought maybe he was 
the son of a man who had served in that war and been driven mad by his father's 
fate. When he learned that was not true either, Harris turned to a cosmic 
explanation. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes," he said, "I think these things are predestined to make these 
apathetic Americans think about the value of human life." 
</P>
<P>
That is a theme being taken up by many in the community, particularly clergy 
members who agreed at a meeting Thursday evening of the Stockton Metro 
Ministry, a type of interfaith council, to make the schoolyard shootings a 
common theme in all of their Sunday sermons. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Others Like Purdys? 
</P>
<P>
"This (the shooting) stresses the harm, the damage one person can do," the Rev. 
Green said. "One point I want to make is the importance of caring for children 
and bringing them up with love and care and guidance. If they end up being 
angry, lonely and alienated, we all can pay the price for that. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to wonder," he added sadly, "how many other Patrick Edward Purdys are 
being bred out there, even in the best of houses." 
</P>
<P>
Green said he also intended to use the shootings, in which all of the 
fatalities and most of the wounds were suffered by the children of Southeast 
Asian refugees, to inveigh against the discrimination and harassment those 
immigrants often suffer. Others concurred. 
</P>
<P>
"Something like this, as horrible as it is, may be able to remind people that 
we have much more in common with one another, whatever our race or religion, 
than we have differences," said the Rev. Mark Wharff of Holy Cross United 
Methodist Church in the affluent far northside of town. "No matter how they 
felt about Asians before, everyone who saw their grief had to share in it. They 
had to see, and feel, that everyone cries in the same language." 
</P>
<P>
Wharff, too, acknowledged general feelings of anxiety among his congregation. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe," he mused, "this will get people to start thinking of the safety of the 
people downtown. Why can't they feel as safe and secure in their homes as we 
used to here? Will we again settle for making our own homes secure and forget 
their needs?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trouble Understanding 
</P>
<P>
Father Gruber of St. Luke's said he tries to guide anxious parishioners as best 
as he can, but he, too, is having trouble understanding what happened. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been trying to put something together over the last couple of days," he 
said. "I'm still struggling." 
</P>
<P>
The anxiety is made worse by Stockton's star-crossed history. 
</P>
<P>
The city has been called a murder capital because of its high homicide rate. 
Sometimes it is the object of derision because of the antics of its public 
officials, such as the incident in which a councilman displayed a sample of his 
urine at a public meeting, offering it for drug analysis. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a city without pretentions," the Stockton Record's Hanner said. "It's a 
lot of working people trying to do better. . . . We're a basic town with a lot 
of heart and soul and I think we're coming through in this time (of grief)." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike times past, this time Stockton is not being scorned by outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
When a diesel truck driver from Santa Fe rolled through town Tuesday and heard 
a radio report of the shooting, she pulled her rig off the highway and got a 
California Highway Patrol officer to lead her to the Delta Blood Bank. A 
busload of servicemen from Travis Air Force Base in Fairfield also came to give 
blood. The Police Department in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, sent a shipment of 
teddy bears for the wounded children. Fass and other city officials reported 
receiving cash, toys and other contributions from dozens of states, as well as 
from Japan and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Refugee Tragedies 
</P>
<P>
Much of the appeal, of course, is the senseless slaughter of innocents -- 6- 
through 9-year-olds cut down by high-powered rifle fire as they frolicked at 
play. But there is also tremendous sympathy generated by the tragic histories 
of the refugee families who were victimized -- people who had fled war in Asia 
only to find tragedy in a California schoolyard. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of those refugees have streamed into Stockton in the last decade, 
refugee counselors Dan Ortiz and Phong Van Tran said. Initially they were drawn 
by the region's reputation as a fertile farming center, but the tremendously 
high cost of land has prevented all but a very few from actually tilling soil. 
</P>
<P>
However, that disappointment did not dissuade others from following, the 
counselors said. Other refugees were drawn by the mildly warm weather, which is 
closer to their native climate than Pennsylvania, Minnesota or other areas to 
which they were originally sent after entering the country. Many more came in 
search of affordable housing -- a draw that also is bringing to town thousands 
of Bay Area commuters. More recently, many refugees have come to Stockton 
because relatives had already settled here. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rich Mix of Refugees 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many other places, which tend to attract refugees primarily of one 
nationality, Stockton's refugees are a rich mix of Cambodians, Vietnamese, 
Laotians and Hmong. In addition to distinct languages and cultures, each has 
its own rung on the socioeconomic ladder. 
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese, for example, were among the first to arrive here. They also 
generally were the best-educated of the refugees and the most acclimated to 
Western customs. As a result, they have made the easiest transition and have 
often prospered. 
</P>
<P>
Cambodians, on the other hand, have struggled. Their big families, a great 
asset on unmechanized Asian farms, are expensive to support in a place where 
one must pay for such things as housing, which they used to build themselves, 
and electricity, which they did not have, and water, which came free from a 
well. 
</P>
<P>
Many are on welfare and will remain there for years, even though they dutifully 
continue to send $20 a month each from their meager welfare stipend to repay 
whichever refugee resettlement charity which provided them with the airline 
ticket that allowed them to emigrate to America. 
</P>
<P>
Whether successful or struggling, they have attracted abuse by bigots. 
</P>
<P>
"If they're on welfare, they're criticized for being a burden on taxpayers; if 
they do well, they're criticized for taking jobs from Americans," the Rev. 
Green said. "On top of that, there is a lot of misunderstanding of their 
languages, cultures and history." 
</P>
<P>
Such prejudices are hardly unique to Stockton, of course, nor are they the 
majority view of its residents. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people in Stockton are very nice; they have been very nice to us," said 
Thanh Huynh of the Vietnamese Buddhist Center of Stockton. "But we know there 
are people who do not want us here, and we are afraid of them." 
</P>
<P>
He and other refugees tentatively expressed hope that the Stockton school 
tragedy will win them some tolerance. 
</P>
<P>
"I pray they are right," said the Rev. Jim Dunn of the First Baptist Church. "I 
pray this will make Stockton a more understanding and a more compassionate 
community. I pray some good will come of this."

KABUL, Afghanistan 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
West Germany's diplomatic staff left Kabul on Saturday under orders from the 
Bonn government, and Tass said the Soviet Union began an airlift of emergency 
food supplies to the beleaguered capital. 
</P>
<P>
The West German Foreign Ministry said it told its three diplomats in Kabul to 
leave because of fears of worsening economic conditions and increased violence 
as Soviet soldiers leave Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
Juergen Chrobog, chief ministry spokesman in Bonn, said the diplomats and their 
families left Saturday and that the embassy will function "on a reduced status" 
with a small local staff. 
</P>
<P>
Western diplomatic sources in Kabul, however, said the embassy was closed. That 
would make it the first foreign mission in Kabul to shut down amid concerns 
about an economic blockade and possible blood bath after the departure of 
Soviet troops, expected to be completed next month. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Flight to New Delhi 
</P>
<P>
The sources said the West Germans left on a flight for New Delhi with no 
advance announcement. 
</P>
<P>
Other Western embassies say they are reviewing their positions now that it 
appears the Soviets will meet the Feb. 15 deadline for removal of their troops 
from Afghanistan, where they have been helping government troops fight Muslim 
guerrillas since December, 1979. 
</P>
<P>
The British Embassy last week told Britons and nationals of six other countries 
for which it has diplomatic responsibility to leave. The U.S. Embassy has 11 
American staff members in Kabul and says the question of whether to stay is 
"under constant review." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tensions Increase 
</P>
<P>
Kabul has been increasingly tense as the withdrawal date for the remaining 
50,000 Soviet soldiers approaches and guerrillas close in. Food prices have 
doubled in recent weeks. Civilians, including young children, stand in bread 
lines for hours in 20-degree temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
Departing Soviet military forces leave behind a regime stockpiling ammunition 
for a battle of survival with the guerrillas, who ring the capital in mountain 
bases and have rejected proposals for a political settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Guerrilla disruptions of convoys of food and supplies, including ammunition, 
have increased as Soviet troops hand over escort duties and positions to 
government units along the key Salang Highway from the Soviet border. Bad 
weather also has held up convoys. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's English-language Tass report mentioned "significant shortages 
because of the effort by the unreconcilable opposition (guerrillas) to organize 
an economic blockade of the city." It accused some Kabul traders of engaging in 
"open sabotage" by hoarding food. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Food Airlift Begins 
</P>
<P>
The official Soviet news agency reported from Kabul that a 3,500-ton airlift of 
food began Friday. Tass said six flights arrived Saturday in Kabul with flour 
and other food supplies. 
</P>
<P>
U.N. aid officials welcomed the reported airlift and urged similar help from 
Western nations, which refuse to deal with the pro-Marxist government of 
President Najibullah. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very pleased. This is a beginning," said Vincent O'Reilly, head of 
UNICEF in Kabul. 
</P>
<P>
"We've heard reports of children dying (from cold) in the bread queues, and 
we're very concerned about the dangers of increased malnutrition. . . . This is 
a humanitarian, not a political issue, and the West should help too." 
</P>
<P>
Kabul's daily life has become a tableau of war, suffering, fear and efforts to 
escape. Amputees hobble in the potholed streets. Afghans cluster at the Indian 
Embassy for visas. 
</P>
<P>
The bitter Afghan winter is even harder to bear because of the scarcity of food 
and fuel caused partly by guerrilla attacks on convoys along the Salang 
Highway. 
</P>
<P>
Giant Soviet transports drop cascades of anti-missile flares as they climb from 
the Kabul airport, bound for Moscow with soldiers and civilian advisers after 
delivering cargoes of ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
An average of six planes arrive and depart daily. Hundreds of fully equipped 
Soviet troops have been seen boarding them. 
</P>
<P>
North of the Salang Pass toward the border, Soviet troops are digging in at new 
positions, diplomats say, apparently to secure the road for the final 
withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
Workers in Kabul are felling an avenue of trees and leveling the ground on 
either side of a long, wide road that runs from the Darulaman Palace, 
headquarters of the Defense Ministry, past the Soviet Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
It is wide enough to accommodate small Antonov transport planes, and there is 
speculation that the Soviets are preparing an emergency airstrip. 
</P>
<P>
Indications are that thousands of Afghans, including supporters or 
beneficiaries of the current regime, are trying to slip away or make 
arrangements for quick exits. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Visa Section Closed 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Embassy shut its visa section last month after a deluge of more than 
250 applications a day, compared to five a month last year. Since it stopped 
issuing visas, lines have formed outside the embassy of India, the nearest 
country for those who can afford air fare. 
</P>
<P>

RETURNED BURMESE DEMONSTRATOR FINDS GENERATION GAP AT HOME

Aung Naing, a 19-year-old apprentice mechanic with what passes for the punk 
look in Burma, is in good standing with the law, but he's got a bit of trouble 
with his parents. 
</P>
<P>
The youth, who goes by the alias Ya Coot, took to the streets in nearby 
Mandalay last summer when anti-government demonstrations swept the country. 
When the military took power in September, he fled to the jungles, fearing 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
"I went with my friend," Aung Naing told a reporter who was here interviewing 
students who had returned to their homes under a government amnesty program. 
</P>
<P>
"A bad choice of friends," snapped his mother, who for three months did not 
know what had happened to her son. 
</P>
<P>
He had gone to the Thai border, had a generally miserable time and caught 
malaria. But Thursday, malaria seemed minor compared to what he might catch 
from his father. 
</P>
<P>
In a generation gap further widened by the tumultuous events in Burma in August 
and September, the young apprentice, who wears an earring and a side-sheared 
haircut, had rejected parental pleas and joined the protests. He expressed no 
regrets. 
</P>
<P>
Hla Maung, wearing a traditional Burmese jacket and cap, said he was glad that 
his son had returned but that he should not have gotten involved in 
anti-government politics in the first place. On his chest, the father wore a 
government decoration, awarded for alerting the military when Communist 
insurgents attacked an air base in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
The parents said their son is a good, honest youth. Was it wrong for young 
people to work for a different kind of political system in Burma? "I have no 
idea," the father said. "As a civil servant, I'm not interested in politics." 
</P>
<P>
Somehow that attitude was not passed along to his son. "Everybody was taking 
part (in the demonstrations), so I took part," Aung Naing explained. "We had 
our demands." 
</P>
<P>
The father sees developments another way: "There was anarchy before the 
military took over. Now peace has been restored."

Convicted murderer Theodore Bundy confessed to at least nine killings while his 
lawyers maneuvered to block his execution scheduled for Tuesday, officials from 
two Western states said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Bundy confessed to killing at least eight young women in western Washington 
state in 1974, investigator Robert Keppel of the Washington attorney general's 
office said. 
</P>
<P>
Bundy also confessed to the 1975 murder of a 26-year-old Vail, Colo., ski shop 
employee whose body was never found, Vail Police Chief Ken Hughey said. 
</P>
<P>
Bundy, scheduled to die in the electric chair for the kidnap-murder of 
12-year-old Kimberly Leach in 1978, has been linked to as many as 36 killings 
and disappearances of young women in Washington, Colorado, Utah and other 
Western states. 
</P>
<P>
The 42-year-old law school dropout was visited Saturday by officials from 
several Western states, and more interviews were scheduled for today, said Paul 
Decker, assistant warden at Florida State Prison in Starke. 
</P>
<P>
Bundy's lawyers lost two more bids for a stay of execution Saturday. U.S. 
District Judge G. Kendall Sharp denied a request for a stay in the morning. A 
three-judge panel of the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta denied 
Bundy's appeal in a telephone conference Saturday afternoon without addressing 
any of the legal issues, court clerk Matt Davidson said.

3 RALLIES PROTEST ABORTION RULING; 200 ARE ARRESTED

About 200 people were arrested Saturday at an anti-abortion demonstration in 
Northern California marking the 16th anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court 
decision legalizing abortion. Hundreds of other anti-abortion activists staged 
peaceful rallies in Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties. 
</P>
<P>
The arrests were made when about 400 protesters in Sunnyvale attempted to block 
the entrance to a family planning clinic, police said. The demonstration, held 
by Bay Area Rescue, a coalition of anti-abortion groups, also drew about 150 
supporters of Roe vs. Wade, the landmark 1973 case. 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California, nearly 500 demonstrators rallied at the Federal 
Building in Van Nuys. Several hundred more gathered for a prayer rally at Our 
Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church in the San Bernardino County city of Montclair 
and then marched several blocks to a family planning clinic, where they stayed 
several hours. 
</P>
<P>
No arrests were made in Van Nuys or Montclair. Thousands of anti-abortion 
activists are expected to be in Washington Monday to march in favor of a 
proposed anti-abortion constitutional amendment. A sit-in on the steps of the 
Supreme Court is also planned.

TRASH DUMP WILL BECOME A LIVING LAB FOR SCIENTISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ASHLEY DUNN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For 31 years, a rumbling convoy of garbage trucks has brought load after load 
of waste to the 197-acre Spadra Landfill, piling trash into an imposing 
mountain in the rolling hills of the eastern San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the County Sanitation Districts close the landfill about the year 
2000, more than 18 million tons of garbage will have been heaped into three 
300-foot peaks. 
</P>
<P>
The garbage has created a scarred wasteland of oozing fluids and methane gas. 
Impermeable clay liners have been buried to protect underlying water supplies 
and a web of pipes extract gas created by the decomposing garbage. 
</P>
<P>
But what is an environmental nightmare to some has become a Mother Lode of 
opportunity for others. 
</P>
<P>
Due to an agreement made three years ago among the sanitation districts, the 
county and Cal Poly Pomona, the landfill is slowly evolving into a living 
laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement to turn the landfill into a full-time university research 
facility called LandLab is the only one of its kind in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Very Dramatic Things' 
</P>
<P>
"We think we are going to be doing some very dramatic things," said Hugh O. La 
Bounty, president of Cal Poly Pomona. "There probably isn't another (school) 
president in the United States that is as excited about a dump as I am." 
</P>
<P>
Since the agreement was signed, researchers have studied the effect of the 
landfill on animal life, the use of different grasses to control erosion and 
the effect of burrowing animals on soil stability. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Poly's civil engineering department has also placed probes throughout the 
landfill, which is next to the university, to study how much settling occurs as 
the tons of trash decompose. 
</P>
<P>
The cornerstone of the LandLab project is the development of a 16-acre, 
$5.5-million Institute for Regenerative Studies that will research ways of 
using the resources society has ignored or has grown used to discarding. 
</P>
<P>
When the institute completes its work, sunlight will heat the buildings, 
treated waste water will be channeled to a series of fish pools and irrigated 
vegetable patches and windmills will power water pumps around the site. 
</P>
<P>
Students and faculty are expected to pursue research in aquaculture, 
agriculture, landscape architecture, engineering and social science. 
</P>
<P>
"It is an opportunity to allow our faculty to do research that didn't exist 
before," La Bounty said. "All disciplines will have something to gain from 
LandLab." 
</P>
<P>
Research projects have been going on at the landfill since the agreement was 
signed in October, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
But Cal Poly is ready to begin the LandLab project. Last year the university 
completed a master plan for the site, and expects to receive a $2.7-million 
donation to help build the institute. Final negotiations with a prospective 
donor, not identified by the university, are under way. Officials said the rest 
of the money will be raised through private contributions and a bond issue. 
</P>
<P>
The entire project will encompass 339 acres on the landfill and adjacent 
university land. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't see this as waste," said Jeffrey K. Olson, professor of landscape 
architecture. "We see this as a resource." 
</P>
<P>
The partnership among the sanitation districts, the county and the university 
began in the mid-1960s when the landfill was running out of space for more 
garbage. 
</P>
<P>
The university agreed to allow dumping on some of its property adjacent to the 
landfill. The sanitation districts' part of the bargain was to fill the steep 
canyon with garbage and return it to the university as flatter land where crops 
could be raised. 
</P>
<P>
It started as just a convenient trade, but both sides soon realized that the 
agreement opened far grander possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
The Spadra Landfill, even with the added acreage, will have to be closed 
eventually, and the sanitation districts had to begin planning how the land 
should be managed after that. What contours should it follow? What trees should 
be planted? 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the university had its own problems. Founded as an 
agricultural college but hemmed in by suburban development, it had run out of 
land for research. It was also groping for ways to distinguish departments such 
as agriculture and environmental design from similar programs around the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
The needs of all groups intertwined at the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
The university was an ideal candidate to manage the site, and the landfill 
offered Cal Poly an abundance of land for research. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the sanitation districts will eventually turn over the 
entire landfill to the university, and for the life of the pact it will provide 
funds for research and the development of the site. This year, the university 
received $205,000 for research and to begin implementing the master plan for 
LandLab, which will take decades to complete. 
</P>
<P>
In return, the university will take over the management of the site and develop 
it as a research facility and recreation area. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything has worked out extremely well," said John Gulledge, assistant head 
of the sanitation districts' department of solid waste management. "It's a 
unique opportunity for the districts, the county and the university." 
</P>
<P>
Work has already begun to shape the area as called for by the master plan, 
which proposes a network of hiking trails, wildlife habitats and horse trails 
that will be open to the public. 
</P>
<P>
The university has also proposed building a replica of a California Indian 
village to help students better understand early technologies and the 
relationship of land, plants and animals in the region. 
</P>
<P>
Marvin J. Malecha, dean of the College of Environmental Design, said the 
potential of LandLab will blossom with the construction of the Institute of 
Regenerative Studies, which will house 90 students and faculty in a series of 
buildings covered with rooftop gardens. 
</P>
<P>
Malecha said the institute intends to bring together disciplines such as 
engineering, architecture, biology and sociology to look at old and new ways of 
reusing the planet's limited resources. 
</P>
<P>
Methods of recycling water, maintaining the fertility of soils and using solar 
energy are just a few of the problems the institute will look at, Olson said. 
"It will be the leading facility in the world for regenerative studies." 
</P>
<P>
Construction of the institute is expected to begin in the next year and a half. 
Since the site will not be turned over to the university for years, the use of 
large areas for recreation or research must wait.

PLAN TO BAN PROSTITUTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Ana's latest plan to drive prostitutes and their clients from Harbor 
Boulevard and out of town by declaring them public nuisances is no better or 
more constitutional than the hare-brained scheme the city was contemplating 
several months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Last September, the city was considering seeking court orders to allow police 
to bar from Harbor Boulevard women who merely dressed or acted like 
prostitutes. Someone on the city staff must have finally realized the obvious 
-- that there are legal and constitutional problems trying to arrest someone 
based merely on how she looks or dresses. 
</P>
<P>
The latest plan, which the city last Tuesday did actually launch in a lawsuit 
filed in Superior Court, is just as constitutionally questionable. What Santa 
Ana now seeks is an injunction against 350 convicted prostitutes and their 
customers, declaring them a public nuisance. If the court issues the order, 
then any prostitutes and their clients could be cited and held in contempt of 
court and jailed if they returned to Harbor Boulevard for any reason -- 
conceivably only to wait for a bus. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney for the city said the approach "has never been done before in 
California and maybe not anywhere in the U.S." No wonder. It has the same basic 
flaw as the original plan in that it seeks to arrest someone before she breaks 
a law, in this case because of a previous conviction, not because of any 
specific wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
We can understand the frustration that police and city officials face in trying 
to satisfy the justifiable complaints of merchants and residents against the 
streetwalkers, but that doesn't justify suspending the constitution and jailing 
people for nothing more than their mere presence on a public street. It is 
difficult to imagine any judge going along with that. 
</P>
<P>
If the courts do want to help discourage prostitution, on Harbor Boulevard and 
elsewhere throughout the county, they should set the highest bail and impose 
the strictest jail sentences that the law allows for anyone rightfully arrested 
and convicted of soliciting or engaging in prostitution. Prostitution will 
never be eradicated, but it can be discouraged considerably if hookers on 
Harbor Boulevard know that conviction here means a long time off the street, in 
a jail cell. Which is another reason to put the sales tax measure for a new 
jail on the ballot.

IRVINE'S ORDINANCE ON HUMAN RIGHTS 
</P>

<P>
Having read your editorial Jan. 15, I am compelled to write to you. 
</P>
<P>
I find it very disturbing that there are so many otherwise normal people who 
try to excuse the aberration known as homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
I do not advocate violence toward the poor unfortunates who are trapped in this 
behavior, but I do believe that they should have the decency to keep their 
activities private. Heterosexuals are expected to do as much. The only 
motivation for all the publicity and propaganda favoring homosexuality (and 
there is a great deal of it in movies, television and newspapers) is to snare 
other borderline or unformed individuals into their life style. Have we not 
enough of AIDS and other problems engendered by them without having the media 
producing apologies for them? 
</P>
<P>
Again, I do not care what they do in private. I only ask that they keep their 
activities private and cease proselytizing.

A REASONABLE PLAN FOR MASS TRANSIT IN COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In regard to the editorial on Jan. 8, here we go again, another new study on 
"the rail system" or better named "how to sell a sales tax increase"! It is a 
shame that these two issues cannot be separated so we can get into the 21st 
Century with some reasonable plan for mass transit. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some of the issues that need to be addressed in the "study." Is the 
Pacific Electric right of way the best route? Will it serve the public and get 
them where they want to go, and is there a large enough adjacent population for 
it to be effective? 
</P>
<P>
Are there better alternatives, such as: the Amtrak lines that have track and 
stations in place (50% of the county's population lives within 1 1/2 miles of 
this line)? Or down the 22 Freeway to the San Gabriel River to the Century or 
91 freeways (this line could be built as a monorail with park-and-ride lots 
that could be constructed for rail, bus and car-pooling), or along the 5 
Freeway? The use of the Pacific Electric right of way for rail transportation 
would disrupt existing streets. 
</P>
<P>
Disruption of the Garden Grove residential neighborhoods would occur. Just 
because Orange County might want the Pacific Electric line, does Los Angeles 
County have the same interest? If the line is developed underground, the costs 
escalate dramatically. If it stays at grade or is elevated, there will be an 
impact on the adjacent homes. 
</P>
<P>
I rode the Red Car to work in the 1950s. I understand it sounds like a good 
idea to reconstruct it, but we will soon be in the 21st Century, and there must 
be a better solution than turning the clock back to the turn of this century. 
Most all the points cited above have been addressed in past studies. Let's not 
make this into another study to sit on someone's shelf like the jail or airport 
studies. Let's not waste $500 million to $1 billion just to sell the sales tax. 
Let's pick a system to serve the people and move into the 21st Century.

STATE BUDGET PROPOSAL VERSUS SOCIAL VALUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding "The Governor's Budget Proposal" (Jan. 11), we are in trouble. This 
budget proposal confirms it. This budget report is evidence of the decline of 
leadership and continuing mismanagement of social service resources by our 
government. 
</P>
<P>
The governor alone is not culpable for the proposal. He is certainly 
accountable. But so is the Legislature. And beyond that so are our corporate 
and social representatives, including we the people. 
</P>
<P>
This budget and its attack on the impoverished is yet another slap at the 
consciousness of society, alerting us to the continuing demise in our social 
values and our inability to manage the needs and demands of our materialistic 
world. 
</P>
<P>
The governor challenges the Legislature to revise restrictive budget policies 
such as "entitlements" or guaranteed annual program increases tied to the rate 
of inflation. Individual legislators respond with nonspecific tough talk. None 
of our elected leaders are being straightforward and candid with the public. 
They have collectively failed to communicate with the public, to educate, to 
demonstrate, and to provide the leadership so critical to our social 
well-being. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with economic constraint, the governor has taken the easy way out -- 
delete those line items that will create the minimal public upheaval and 
political heat. By his decision, he has attacked the medically indigent, the 
aged, blind and disabled. And if he receives legislative pressure, the next in 
line are the mentally ill, senior nutrition, alcohol and drug treatment 
programs. It is bad enough to be poor -- to be poor and to be sick is 
intolerable! 
</P>
<P>
We the people must demand public accountability and a return to social 
responsibility.

A REASONABLE PLAN FOR MASS TRANSIT IN COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carl Schiermeyer in his Commentary (Jan. 15) produced some interesting data 
regarding existing rail transportation through Orange County. Building more 
sections of double track is a must and upgrading maintenance on the rolling 
stock mandatory, but these measures are mere Band-Aids on an already crisis 
transit situation. This is not to say that these measures should not be pursued 
immediately but that additional rail corridors should be on the drawing boards 
now. 
</P>
<P>
The San Joaquin Freeway, which is estimated to cost $409 million, a portion of 
which is to come from user fees in the form of tolls, can only exacerbate our 
transportation woes. A rail system is the only user fee that can and will 
relieve motorized congestion. If, indeed, the purpose of the San Joaquin Hills 
Corridor is to forestall freeway gridlock and not, as many believe, open more 
land for development, then let the planners seek some real solutions to the 
transit mess. 
</P>
<P>
What if we build a rail system in that corridor with depots only in the 
populated areas? What if that system would ultimately link all the coastal 
communities into Long Beach and beyond right into Los Angeles? Is it not 
possible that many would give up those second cars? 
</P>
<P>
Would it not be possible for business and industry to provide van service for 
employees to and from the railroad stations? Turn some of the vast parking lots 
needed to provide employee parking to better use as child-care centers or 
parks. I would hope that the San Bernardino and Riverside communities would 
join in the effort to link all those Orange County and Los Angeles working 
people with an easier and more economical commute. 
</P>
<P>
Is it too much to ask that if we must endure the haphazard growth that the 
despoilers of the environment have inflicted on us and future generations, that 
we must also be a party to their Neanderthal notion that more freeways are the 
answer to the problems they have in part created?

SANTA ANA'S DOG FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Ana residents were recently outraged by the Gestapo-like tactics of city 
representatives who knocked on their door and demanded immediate payment of dog 
license fees. 
</P>
<P>
Due to the high rate of crime in Santa Ana, many residents have obtained a dog, 
primarily as a deterrent to burglars. Who would deny that a dog is more of a 
deterrent to unwanted intruders than a cat? Yet, cat owners are not subject to 
paying license fees. 
</P>
<P>
Not too long ago, a Santa Ana police officer suggested that concerned residents 
obtain a Doberman pinscher because the understaffed Police Department was no 
longer able to control crime in our city. Shortly thereafter, the city decided 
to revise its 5-year plan to address public safety, specifically to hire 10 new 
police officers for each of the next 5 years -- a total of 50 police officers. 
This, apparently, is an admission that crime, in fact, was out of control in 
Santa Ana and predictions indicate that it will continue to get worse for at 
least the next 5 years. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, shouldn't dogs be considered an integral part of the city 
crime-prevention effort? If dogs are involved in crime reduction in our city, 
why should their owners be subject to paying a license fee? 
</P>
<P>
If enough dog owners agree and let their elected representatives know, in all 
fairness, the city should pay the owners a maintenance fee rather than charge 
the owners a license fee.

West Side Story took an early lead and paced to victory with the fastest mile 
of the meet in the featured $8,000 invitational Saturday at Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
Irresistible Magic, the 2-1 favorite, held a clear advantage until the far 
turn. West Side Story and Steve Desomer quickly closed the gap and came up on 
the outside at the top of the lane. Irresistible Magic held on gamely, but West 
Side Story went by and finished in 1:55 4/5, 1 3/5 faster than his previous 
best.

NEW ROUTES OPEN IN MEXICO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New U.S.-Mexico air carrier routes beginning in February are expected to boost 
Mexico's trade and tourism earnings, according to Arturo C. Sobrino, director 
general of American Airlines operations in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Sobrino said the carrier will offer three flights a day from Raleigh-Durham, 
N.C., to the resort destinations of Cancun and Cozumel on the Caribbean, 
starting Feb. 11. 
</P>
<P>
The same day American is to inaugurate three flights a day between Dallas and 
Monterrey, Sobrino said. 
</P>
<P>
Direct flights between Chicago and the Pacific coast resort of Puerto Vallarta 
are scheduled to begin in December, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sobrino said Continental Airlines already has routes connecting Denver, Houston 
and Mexico's Pacific Coast resort of Mazatlan. 
</P>
<P>
"The three flights from Monterrey to Dallas will allow booming industry in 
Nuevo Leon state great flexibility in sending its export products to 
international markets," Sobrino said. 
</P>
<P>
American Airlines expects to carry more than 650,000 tourists from the United 
States to Mexico this year, he added.

OK, there were a few gaffes in our Sneaks '89. It is Edward S. Feldman -- not 
Ed Pressman -- who is producing "Wired" with Charles Meeker. The Francis Ford 
Coppola-directed segment of "New York Stories" stars newcomer Heather McComb, 
not Coppola's daughter, Sofia. Sofia co-wrote the script with her father and 
also designed the costumes and titles. Merrin Holt and Ken Krauss are the

MAN-MADE MARSH: The Anaheim Wetlands has something that sets it apart from 
marsh restoration projects elsewhere in the county, such as Bolsa Chica, Upper 
Newport Bay and the San Joaquin Freshwater Marsh Reserve at UC Irvine: It was 
built from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
Composed of three freshwater ponds along the Santa Ana River southeast of La 
Palma Avenue and Weir Canyon Road, the Anaheim Wetlands was created in 1985 as 
mitigation for the loss of a 10.2-acre marsh at Ball Road and the Orange 
Freeway. That site was chosen as the location of a string of car dealerships. 
</P>
<P>
Cathy Glasgow, supervisor of Oak Canyon Nature Center in Anaheim Hills, is also 
in charge of the Anaheim Wetlands. She said the site is looking "pretty good," 
with the vegetation planted along the pond shores now well established. 
</P>
<P>
"Birds (especially waterfowl) do come in and use the area for feeding," Glasgow 
said, but it is not yet known if any birds are using the site for breeding. The 
old marsh, which was at the bottom of an abandoned gravel pit, was used by 
about 150 species of bird, and in 1985 was described as the only coastal 
nesting area for the great-tailed grackle and the yellow-headed blackbird. 
</P>
<P>
"The shame of it is that the area that was lost was so viable," said Glasgow. 
It will take time for the new marsh, which is smaller than the old one, to 
establish itself and attract wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
Permits are required to enter the site, which is not currently set up for 
visitation (although there is an observation deck along the Santa Ana River 
bike path). Glasgow said the city may eventually develop educational programs 
for the site and enlist volunteer work crews to help keep water channels clear 
of vegetation. A stream connects the three ponds with the river. 
</P>
<P>
For information on the site, call Oak Canyon Nature Center, (714) 998-8380.

ANGRY MASSEUSES DENOUNCE PLAN TO TRIPLE THEIR FEES

Orange County massage therapists are up in arms about a plan to nearly triple 
their yearly license fees to $939, which the Sheriff's Department says is the 
cost of a background check in a field notorious for prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
Therapists say charging more for licenses discourages the wrong people. A 
prostitute can afford higher fees but the legitimate therapist fresh from 
school cannot, said a spokeswoman for the California Massage Therapy Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The association is negotiating with the Sheriff's Department, hoping to make 
education and professional testing rather than criminal records the criteria 
for licensing. 
</P>
<P>
The group's long-range goal is to have the state Department of Consumer 
Affairs, which regulates various professions and vocations, take over 
regulation of massage therapy. 
</P>
<P>
"What you're dealing with is a large profession trying to prove itself to be 
legitimate. And the large majority is legitimate," said Sheriff's Lt. Russ 
Elsner, who supervises massage therapist licensing for unincorporated Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish we could have a window: 'All the professionals on the left, please, and 
the people in prostitution on the right.' It's an unfortunate thing that a 
number of professionals have to put up with this." 
</P>
<P>
But, Elsner said, prostitution remains a problem within the massage therapy 
field. "Our vice people say that in the last 18 months there have been 31 
violations from massage parlors alone -- from acts of prostitution to 
unlicensed massagists." 
</P>
<P>
He said there are five massage parlors and 30 massage therapists licensed in 
county territory, "mostly scattered through the south county." 
</P>
<P>
Under the county ordinance, to receive a license an applicant must have a 
certificate from a state-certified school, have undergone 200 hours of 
schooling and have a "good moral character," which generally is interpreted to 
mean no felony convictions. Prostitution is not specifically mentioned. Any 
false statement on an application means automatic denial of the license. 
</P>
<P>
Applicants are fingerprinted and photographed, and fingerprints are checked 
against national and state crime files. Sheriff's vice detectives investigate 
each applicant, Elsner said. Besides routine checking, "we stake them out, and 
we go in and get massages," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The fee was $366 when the County Board of Supervisors decided last year that 
applicants for all county licenses should be charged the actual cost of issuing 
the licenses. 
</P>
<P>
A auditor's analysis of the typical massage therapist background check set the 
cost at $939. County officials said it would be one of the biggest fee 
increases under the new policy. 
</P>
<P>
When the Sheriff's Department recommended that fee to county supervisors Oct. 
19, representatives of massage therapists were there to protest. Supervisors 
postponed their decision pending further study. 
</P>
<P>
M.K. Hungerford, who operates a school in Costa Mesa known as the American 
Institute of Massage Therapy, is on the massage association's Orange County 
legislation committee and has been negotiating with the Sheriff's Department. 
She said her organization represents about 200 massage therapists in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
"Every surrounding city charges less than the county does," she said in an 
interview. "You can get your license in Irvine, Costa Mesa, Newport Beach, 
Huntington Beach, even Los Angeles, for $100 to $300. It's ludicrous to charge 
more." 
</P>
<P>
She said the statewide organization is getting ready to lobby for statewide 
licensing but, in the meantime, she wants local authorities to concentrate on 
education and testing as a way of qualifying legitimate massage therapists. 
</P>
<P>
She said some jurisdictions require no more than 100 hours of schooling before 
issuing a license. "In three provinces of Canada they require 2,200 hours. In 
Europe, you have to have 2 years. But we're still besieged with people who want 
to take 100 hours in 10 days and call themselves massage therapists," 
Hungerford said. 
</P>
<P>
A person with such limited training "can wreak havoc -- a nerve pinch, a muscle 
tear," she said. "I don't care if she's a prostitute as long as she's a 
competent massage therapist. If they legalized prostitution, these women 
wouldn't have to pretend to be massage therapists." 
</P>
<P>
Elsner said a review of the Sheriff's Department's procedures shows some 
alternatives are possible. 
</P>
<P>
He said the typical prostitute posing as a massage therapist works in a massage 
parlor. Whether the massage parlor is a front for prostitution or a legitimate 
business, the prostitution often is solicited there and conducted elsewhere, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Massage therapists doing business in places "that don't lend themselves to 
prostitution" -- such as beauty salons -- might be given less scrutiny and 
therefore charged a lower fee, Elsner said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the Sheriff's Department is also studying a San Diego ordinance that 
deals with holistic health-care practitioners. 
</P>
<P>
"In essence, it states that if I have x amount of hours from a state-certified 
school and belong to a state or national professional massage organization and 
within a 2-year period received 30 hours of continuing education, then I'm 
exempt from fees and background checks," Elsner said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are good and bad points. At this time, it would be awfully hard for the 
Sheriff's Department to rely on someone to police themselves. They want to say, 
'These people are good because they passed our tests, and they're one of our 
members.' But there is still a prostitution problem. 
</P>
<P>
"We may examine giving the tests ourselves. Perhaps that will satisfy both the 
profession and law enforcement," Elsner said. 
</P>
<P>
Ahmos Netanel, president of the California Massage Therapy Assn., said his 
group is preparing to ask for statewide regulation but that a bill will not be 
submitted until after the current session of the Legislature. The association 
is seeking a minimum of 500 hours of instruction to qualify for a license, 
Netanel said. 
</P>
<P>
Statewide licensing would be "ideal," Hungerford said, "but right now I'd be 
happy to have the local licensing concentrate more on what a person knows than 
how much money they've got." 
</P>
<P>
Elsner said an amended plan by the Sheriff's Department should be ready for the 
Board of Supervisors "in 2 or 3 weeks."

An unidentified man died of a gunshot wound early Saturday at Western Medical

</P>
<P>
The victim, about 25 years old, died at 1:15 a.m. after surgery, Santa Ana 
Police Lt. Hugh Mooney said. Police received a call at 11:32 p.m. Friday of a 
shooting in the 200 block of South Bristol Avenue in Santa Ana. Officers found 
the victim on the sidewalk with a gunshot wound to the upper body. 
</P>
<P>
Mooney said the victim had no identification. The motive for the attack and the 
caliber of weapon used are unknown, Mooney said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is very little to go on," Mooney said. "It's one of those real 
puzzlers."

COUPLE HURT WHEN TRAIN HITS CAR THAT WAS THRUST ONTO TRACKS

An Anaheim couple were injured Saturday when a train hit their car, which had 
been rear-ended by another vehicle and thrust into a Fullerton railroad 
crossing, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Laura and Javier Nunez, both 28, were in the car when the train hit it but 
sustained only minor injuries, according to Fullerton Police Sgt. Bud Lathrop. 
They were taken to Martin Luther Hospital Medical Center in Anaheim and were in 
stable condition, a nursing supervisor said. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred about 6:25 p.m. at a Santa Fe Railroad crossing on State 
College Boulevard just north of Orangethorpe Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The driver who rear-ended the couple was described as an Anaheim man in his 
30s. He apparently was uninjured. Lathrop said the incident was originally 
being investigated as a hit-and-run because the driver left the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities later learned that he had left his identification with another 
passer-by. Lathrop said investigators are uncertain why the man left the area 
and said they will question him about the incident. 
</P>
<P>
"The driver was still at the scene after the train hit the car," Lathrop said. 
"When officers arrived, they told the driver to stay put while they assisted 
the victims. When they got back, he was gone. We now think his fleeing was not 
an attempt to get away as such. He apparently got bored. We still want to talk 
to him, though. " 
</P>
<P>
Lathrop said the driver may be cited for driving without a license.

TITANS' FUTURE LOOKS BRIGHTER AFTER VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Ushers were handing out sunglasses to fans entering Titan Gym Saturday night 
for Cal State Fullerton's game against Utah State. 
</P>
<P>
Not that the future of either of these teams seemed bright enough to require 
them. 
</P>
<P>
The Aggies, who went to the NCAA tournament last season, came into this game 
with a 6-10 record that included 5 losses to in-state rivals. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton, after a 5-1 start, had fallen to 6-8. 
</P>
<P>
But the Titans turned a corner against Utah State, looking like a team that has 
begun to find itself in a 96-87 Big West victory in front of a crowd of 1,621. 
</P>
<P>
This was a game in which the Titans did very nearly what they wanted. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd sum it up as a quality effort, a quality win for us," Sneed said. 
</P>
<P>
Utah State's Reid Newey had 3-pointers raining in, but Fullerton's Mark Hill 
nearly matched him. Newey hit 7, and Hill had 5. 
</P>
<P>
Cedric Ceballos scored 30 points, and he did it this time on just 16 field-goal 
attempts. He made 9 of them, and he hit 12 of 15 free throws. 
</P>
<P>
On offense, the Titans were taking good shots -- they hit 33 of 63 (52%) in the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
And on defense, they continued to improve their new matchup zone -- plus 
introducinga fullcourt zone press. 
</P>
<P>
The Aggies -- who, granted, have trouble with pressure of any sort -- committed 
14 first-half turnovers, many of them in the backcourt, and many of them 
resulting in Fullerton baskets. 
</P>
<P>
It was on such a play -- a steal by Ceballos in the backcourt that ended with a 
reverse dunk despite 3 defenders -- that Fullerton took a 10-point lead with 4 
minutes left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the big thing, those turnovers," Utah State Coach Kohn Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans, who made 18 of 36 shots in the first half, might have put the game 
away then, but Newey's 3-point shooting kept the Aggies close. Newey hit 5 
3-pointers in the first half, and Utah State still trailed at halftime, 45-38. 
</P>
<P>
Newey was the main gun for Utah State in the game, finishing with 29 points. 
</P>
<P>
"If it wasn't for Newey in the first half, we might have been blowing them 
out," Fullerton Coach John Sneed said. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Hill nearly matched Newey from 3-point range, and finished with 26 points, 
tying his career high. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans fell behind by as many as 3 in the second half, but Utah State 
couldn't pull ahead by more. 
</P>
<P>
"In the second half, we get up by 2 points and have the ball and then fire a 
quick shot from the corner," Utah State Coach Kohn Smith said. "Another time, 
we shoot a quick one on an out-of-bounds play and missed. We shot too soon." 
</P>
<P>
The Titans pulled away again, going up, 81-76, with 2 minutes left and then 
hitting 12 of 15 free throws down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
"The last 2 minutes seemed like an eternity," Sneed said. "I thought (Aggie 
Coach Kohn Smith) did an outstanding job of milking the clock. If we had missed 
our free throws, they might have beat us." 
</P>
<P>
Smith was hardly pleased with his team's performance, calling it the Aggies' 
"worst of the year." 
</P>
<P>
"The first half we came out and just didn't play. Defensively, we were very 
poor and, obviously, offensively we had 14 turnovers in the first half. You 
just can't play with that type of ballhandling." 
</P>
<P>
Smith also said his team had a hard time playing in 4,000-seat Titan Gym after 
playing Nevada Las Vegas in the 18,000-capacity Thomas &amp; Mack Center 
Thursday, a game the Aggies lost, 102-80. 
</P>
<P>
"You play at Vegas in front of 18,000 and then come in here and play in front 
of a few 100 in a small gym. . . . You go from a large arena that's really well 
lit. . . . You turn around after that big game. Mentally, it's a hard thing. " 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton's Sneed, on the other hand, was clearly pleased. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans had beaten a makeshift San Jose State team Thursday to break a 
7-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
"We played pretty doggone good against San Jose, too, but you're not going to 
get a lot of credit in that one," Sneed said. 
</P>
<P>
This victory moves the Titans to 2-4 in the Big West Conference, while Utah 
State dropped to 4-4. 
</P>
<P>
"If we get another win or 2, we can be right there in the middle," Sneed said. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans had opened the conference with 4 losses in a row. 
</P>
<P>
"If we win at home, and split on the road, that would be fine," Sneed said. The 
Titans don't play again until next Saturday on a road trip to Pacific. 
Fullerton will play at Fresno State Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we've got our 2 wins in a row to end our losing streak and we have some 
momentum," Hill said. "We gained a lot of confidence from the game at Las Vegas 
(a 66-63 loss) . . . We're ready to go on this trip now." 
</P>
<P>
Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
Brent Calvin started at center for the third game in a row. He played 11 
minutes and had 3 points and 3 rebounds. John Sykes played 17 minutes at the 
position, and had 3 points and 5 rebounds. David Moody had 2 points and 3 
rebounds in 12 minutes.
