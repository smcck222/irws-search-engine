GIRL SHOT DEAD, 4 OTHERS INJURED IN GANG-RELATED DRIVE-BY ATTACKS

<P>
A flare-up of gang violence in Pacoima over the weekend claimed the life of a 
17-year-old girl and left four other young people in the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The gunfire began near Paxton Park about 11:20 p.m. Saturday when four people 
were wounded in two drive-by shootings from the same car. The mayhem carried 
over into the early hours Sunday when a Sepulveda girl was fatally shot as she 
rode in the back seat of a car near Hansen Dam Park. Her name was not released 
because relatives had not been notified. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the incidents were gang related but did not appear to be connected. 
No motive had been established late Sunday in either attack. 
</P>
<P>
An 18-year-old man, whose name was not released, was arrested in the first 
drive-by shootings. Police were seeking other suspects in the incidents. 
</P>
<P>
The four people injured in the first shootings -- three young men and a girl -- 
were in stable condition at Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The attack in which the girl died occurred about 1:30 a.m. Sunday. Los Angeles 
Police Detective Marshall White said the girl was riding in a car with four 
teen-age friends in the 10900 block of Glenoaks Boulevard when two vehicles -- 
a car and a pickup truck -- pulled alongside. 
</P>
<P>
White said at least five shots were fired from one of the vehicles, several 
striking the car and the girl. White said the girl was hit in the upper torso. 
</P>
<P>
No one else was hurt in the attack, but the car could no longer be driven, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the car pulled to the side of the road and sought help. White 
said two men took the girl to Holy Cross where she was pronounced dead at 1:53 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
White said the girl was not a gang member. 
</P>
<P>
The earlier incident took place near Paxton Street and Haddon Avenue. Lorenzo 
Martinez, 19, and David Sedillo, 20, both of Pacoima, were hit by bullets fired 
from a passing car, said Sgt. O'Neil Carter of the police department's 
anti-gang unit. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez was hit in the upper left leg and back, Sedillo in the upper right leg 
and left side, Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, George Cervantes, 18, of Sylmar and a 15-year-old Pacoima girl 
were sprayed by bullets from the same car near Laurel Canyon Boulevard and 
Chamberlain Street, police said. Carter said Cervantes was hit in the upper 
right arm, the girl in the foot as she tried to flee. 
</P>
<P>
Carter said many people were in the area because of a party and that several 
party-goers apparently followed the injured youths to Holy Cross. The hospital 
called for police assistance to clear the crowd inside shortly after the 
wounded arrived. Hospital officials would not comment on the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Police said that when they arrived at Holy Cross they saw vehicles speeding 
away from the hospital. Officers gave chase and arrested a man for possession 
of a shotgun in a vehicle, Carter said. He did not believe the shotgun was used 
in the attack. He said a handgun was the probable weapon.

COUNCIL GOING PUBLIC WITH DUMP DEBATE; 
</P>
<P>
LANDFILL: THE SANTA CLARITA CITY COUNCIL WILL HOST A FORUM ON THE PROPOSED 
ELSMERE CANYON DUMP. FEEDBACK COULD INFLUENCE THE CITY'S STAND AS WELL AS THE 
UPCOMING ELECTIONS. 
</P>

<P>
For more than a year the Santa Clarita City Council has remained cautiously 
quiet about plans by the city and county of Los Angeles to open a garbage dump 
just outside Santa Clarita in Elsmere Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clarita cannot officially oppose or endorse the dump, council members 
have said, until the city reviews the environmental impact report on the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
But in an unusual move, the council will put the issue before citizens 
Wednesday night at a public forum, which could influence not only Santa 
Clarita's posture toward the dump, but the outcome of City Council elections 
three months away. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the dump issue is going to be a big campaign issue," said Marsha 
McLean, co-chairman of the anti-dump Elsmere Canyon Preservation Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Council members acknowledge that Elsmere Canyon is a volatile issue and that 
taking an unpopular stand on the dump could lose them votes in the April 10 
election. 
</P>
<P>
"We know we're vulnerable," Councilman Dennis Koontz said. 
</P>
<P>
Koontz is facing reelection along with Councilman Carl Boyer III and Mayor Jo 
Anne Darcy, an aide to Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich. So far, 
six challengers have filed to run against them. 
</P>
<P>
Darcy said the aim of the forum is to give the council a sense of the 
community's feelings on the proposed landfill about two miles northeast of the 
interchange of the Golden State and Antelope Valley freeways. 
</P>
<P>
The city and county of Los Angeles reached tentative agreement on a proposal to 
operate a dump in Elsmere Canyon late last year, but an environmental impact 
report on the project is not due until this spring. The earliest a dump could 
begin operating at Elsmere would be 1995, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
At Wednesday's forum, the public will be asked to respond to two draft 
resolutions outlining Santa Clarita's options on the dump. In a sense, the 
citizens are being asked whether the council should take an idealistic approach 
or a pragmatic one. 
</P>
<P>
One resolution says flatly that Santa Clarita will fight a landfill in Elsmere 
Canyon or anywhere else in the city's watershed. 
</P>
<P>
The other says Santa Clarita would endorse a dump only if it is environmentally 
sound and if Santa Clarita receives 18 concessions from the city and county of 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the resolution demands a share in the dump's profits and 
the right to annex about 100 square miles of unincorporated territory 
surrounding Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
It demands that the city of Los Angeles, which owns the defunct 583-acre Saugus 
Rehabilitation Center inside Santa Clarita, give that property to Santa 
Clarita. The resolution also demands that Los Angeles agree to provide Santa 
Clarita with fresh water in case the dump fouls Santa Clarita's wells. 
</P>
<P>
The complete list of concessions contained in the resolution will be detailed 
at the forum, which will begin at 6:30 p.m. in the Hart High School auditorium. 
At the request of the City Council, a local cable television company, King 
Video, will videotape the forum for broadcast at a future date. 
</P>
<P>
All five council members privately say they oppose the Elsmere Canyon landfill. 
But the city's attorneys have advised the council to delay officially endorsing 
or opposing the dump because it could open up the city to litigation. 
</P>
<P>
"City councils have to tread cautiously," Darcy said. 
</P>
<P>
"Now is not the time to declare oneself," Koontz added. 
</P>
<P>
Koontz said the forum might give the council the chance to explain to a 
skeptical public why it has remained silent on the Elsmere Canyon dump proposal 
for so long. "I think that's what people are getting frustrated about," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, members of the Elsmere Canyon Preservation Committee have said the 
council's silence has done the city more harm than good. By remaining neutral, 
"they are stacking the decks against us," McLean said. 
</P>
<P>
Darcy said many citizens mistakenly believe the council has already agreed to 
let the dump proceed in exchange for land and money. "I think there have been a 
lot of rumors floating around," she said. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager George Caravalho said the forum is just one step toward developing 
the city's position on Elsmere Canyon. It could take weeks or months before the 
council is ready to adopt either of the resolutions. The council also could 
revise the resolutions or continue its current course. 
</P>
<P>
The Elsmere Canyon Preservation Committee has greeted the public forum with 
skepticism. Jill Klajic, a committee member and a council candidate, likened 
the forum to "putting up a smoke screen." 
</P>
<P>
She noted how the committee collected 1,600 signatures on petitions asking the 
council to fight the Elsmere Canyon dump. "They know how the community feels," 
she said.

NO-FRILLS PARK COULD USE A FEW, RIDERS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Sixty years ago G. Henry Stetson, whose father invented the famed Western hat, 
moved from Philadelphia to a scenic citrus ranch in the northeastern San 
Fernando Valley. Stetson entertained movie stars and other prominent people at 
his lavish hillside mansion, adorned with a mammoth swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
Today a freeway slices through the rural terrain Stetson once enjoyed, and a 
mobile home park covers the land where his orange groves thrived. Time and the 
forces of nature were not kind to his estate, which was destroyed by a mudslide 
in 1963 and an earthquake in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
But the hat-company heir's legacy lives on in a 29-acre island of open space 
reserved for horse riders: Stetson Ranch Park. Most of the park remains in its 
rugged natural state, and local equestrians prefer it that way. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the people are pretty happy with it," said Gini Barrett of Sylmar, a 
Valley Horse Owners Assn. board member. "Horse people really don't want a lot 
of frills." 
</P>
<P>
But even avid supporters say the park could use some help in small doses. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a rural park in the middle of an urban community," said Jeannine Roman, a 
Sylmar equestrian activist. "It's working, even though there's been sort of 
benign neglect by the city." 
</P>
<P>
With this neglect in mind, representatives of the nonprofit Equestrian Trails 
group met this month with city officials to seek small improvements at Stetson 
Ranch Park. They asked for new hitching rails, electrical outlets and water 
spigots. They also want signs warning bicyclists and motorcyclists to stay 
away. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Ginevan, chief city parks supervisor for the Valley, said his staff will 
comply with most of these requests in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
The park itself has few trails, but Barrett said it is a popular launching 
point for equestrians who want to ride into the scenic Wilson Canyon area 
behind Olive View Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Along with portions of Griffith Park and Hansen Dam, Stetson Ranch Park is one 
of the few city recreation areas set aside primarily for horse riders. Equine 
enthusiasts, worried about the loss of riding areas in Sylmar -- the 
fastest-growing community in the city of Los Angeles in the 1980s -- lobbied 
for its establishment 11 years ago. Since then the remote park, off Glenoaks 
Boulevard north of the Foothill Freeway, has undergone little change. 
</P>
<P>
The park has a trail network, two riding arenas, restrooms and some battered, 
graffiti-stained bleachers. There are no lights -- even in the restrooms -- no 
paved parking lots, no lawn areas and no picnic tables. Because of its limited 
amenities and low rental fees, Stetson Ranch Park is used mainly for 
recreational rides and modest horse shows. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not looking to have a big equestrian center there because that can cause 
problems," said Glenn Hesselbrock, president of the Sylmar chapter of 
Equestrian Trails. 
</P>
<P>
Commercial horse projects at Stetson Ranch Park could lead to higher fees and 
traffic jams, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, city officials have considered building such a complex at 
the park. But now that an equestrian center is planned at Hansen Dam, Stetson 
Ranch Park will likely remain in its present rugged condition, Ginevan said. 
</P>
<P>
"As money becomes available, we may develop further trail networks, but it 
won't become a commercial venture," he said. Equestrians "are not looking for 
development. They're looking for a place to ride their horses, and those are 
best left in their natural state." 
</P>
<P>
Because it is geared to horse riders and is not easy to find, some Sylmar 
residents have never heard of Stetson Ranch Park. Very few know about the man 
for whom the park is named. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a lot of changes in this community," said Roman, a 22-year Sylmar 
resident who serves on the city's Equine Advisory Committee. "There are only a 
few people who understand the history of the area. It's lost in the mists of 
time. But it's a very unique part of the San Fernando Valley." 
</P>
<P>
More than a century ago, John B. Stetson fashioned a wide-brimmed hat to 
protect himself from the sun and wind while working on the Colorado frontier. 
He had shown his cowboy friends how to make cloth by boiling animal fur and 
used this technique to make the hat. 
</P>
<P>
In 1865 he opened a hat factory in St. Joseph, Mo., and began producing the 
headgear seen in countless Western movies. Late in life, Stetson had two sons: 
John Jr., who died in 1952, and Henry. In the late 1920s, Henry Stetson began 
building a large Spanish-style home on his 300-acre Sombrero Ranch in the 
northeastern Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"It was absolutely fabulous, one of the most fantastic places I've ever seen," 
said Roy Richardson, a former San Fernando city councilman who grew up on the 
ranch, which his father managed. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson said Stetson's wife Lucretia encouraged her husband to enlarge the 
estate and beautify it with expensive furnishings. "I think she was attempting 
to make it a small version of the Hearst castle. Every piece was custom-made." 
</P>
<P>
The complex included a hotel-size kitchen, servant's quarters and a separate 
nine-car garage, where Stetson kept the plush Lincoln automobiles he favored. 
He entertained frequently. 
</P>
<P>
"He loved to be outdoors barbecuing," Richardson said. "I remember once when 
they gave a party for the entire cast of Eddie Cantor's movie 'Whoopee.' " 
</P>
<P>
Although he did not manage his father's company, Stetson remained on its board 
of directors. "He made a big thing out of giving Stetson hats to the people who 
worked on his ranch and to his friends," said Richardson, who still has a hat 
given to him by the rancher. 
</P>
<P>
A highlight of the Stetson home was its swimming pool, 235 feet long and 100 
feet wide. It held a million gallons of water and was connected to a stream and 
a series of smaller pools and waterfalls, Richardson recalled. The pool easily 
accommodated the Stetsons' rowboat. 
</P>
<P>
Sybilla D. Stetson, who married Henry after he divorced Lucretia, said the pool 
once provided another type of recreation. "During the war, when we couldn't get 
the materials to keep the pool clean, we used to put fish in it," said Stetson, 
86, of Woodland Hills. "Friends used to come over and fish." 
</P>
<P>
The family kept tame deer on the ranch, which was devoted mainly to orange, 
lemon and lime groves, she said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1959 Henry Stetson sold the ranch to the Mormon Church, which planned to 
build a college on the site. But Stetson retained the right to live on his 
estate for the rest of his life. 
</P>
<P>
In February, 1963, the forces of nature stepped in. "There was a fire in the 
hills directly behind the house, followed by a rainstorm," Richardson said. 
"The water just came rushing down the canyon and right through the house and 
filled the whole thing with mud." 
</P>
<P>
The mammoth pool was also filled to the brim with mud. 
</P>
<P>
Sybilla Stetson said she and her husband were away when the disaster occurred, 
but she returned quickly to inspect the damage. "It was dreadful," she 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
The home could not be salvaged, and the Stetsons relocated to Woodland Hills. 
Henry Stetson died at that home in 1983 at age 95. 
</P>
<P>
The 1971 Sylmar earthquake further devastated the estate and destroyed the 
water system that fed the ranch's citrus groves. A few years later the Mormon 
Church hired Bob Van Dulm to oversee a small herd of cattle brought to the 
ranch. 
</P>
<P>
Von Dulm said most of the Stetson estate was demolished by the church after the 
earthquake. He lives in the chauffeur's house, which he said is the sole 
remaining structure built by Stetson. Van Dulm now is a maintenance worker for 
the adjacent mobile home park. 
</P>
<P>
The church's plan for a community college fell through, and it began planning a 
mobile home park instead. In the late 1970s it sold the land to Fullerton-based 
Continental Mobile Housing, which built the 600-space Oakridge Mobile Home Park 
that now occupies most of the land. 
</P>
<P>
The city required the developer to pay park fees or set aside land for a public 
recreation area, said Myron Reichert, a general partner in the firm. At the 
time, Sylmar-area horse owners were worried about the rapid loss of riding 
areas, so the developer donated Stetson Ranch Park for their use. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everybody was really happy because it was a good trade-off," said 
equestrian activist Roman. "It was just raw land that had been used for growing 
oranges." 
</P>
<P>
Dedication ceremonies were held on Aug. 26, 1978. Four years later another 
nearby developer put in the horse arenas, restroom building, water systems and 
some landscaping in place of paying a park fee. 
</P>
<P>
Sybilla Stetson believes that preserving a portion of the ranch for an 
equestrian park was a fitting tribute to her late husband. 
</P>
<P>
"It kept that land from being built up," she said. "I'm delighted." 
</P>
<P>
The park has changed little since its opening. City officials say they don't 
plan to add picnic tables because that might turn it into a hangout for 
potential lawbreakers after dark. 
</P>
<P>
Horse enthusiasts say they are glad to have a low-key, low-cost alternative to 
commercial equestrian centers. "If we didn't have Stetson Ranch Park, we 
wouldn't be able to have our horse shows," said Claire Shannon of Newhall Trail 
Riders. "We're a nonprofit group. We just want to make enough money to put on 
the next horse show and have a little Christmas party." 
</P>
<P>
Judy Hersh moved to Sylmar in 1978, the year the park opened and has been using 
it ever since. 
</P>
<P>
"When I started using it, nothing was up there, just a dirt road," she said. "I 
watched them put the arenas in a few years later." 
</P>
<P>
Hersh, noting that the changes would be "pretty minimal," said she'd like to 
see the ruggedness of the park maintained. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the people of Sylmar would like to keep it that way. I know I would," 
Hersh said. "We're horse people living in the city, but we like being where the 
terrain hasn't changed."

BOY SCOUTS RESCUED FROM MOUNTAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two Boy Scouts were rescued by helicopter Sunday morning after they failed to 
return from a hike and spent the night on a mountain, the San Diego County 
Sheriff's Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
At 11 a.m. Saturday, Jason Scott, 15, and Greg Nielson, 17, both of Huntington 
Beach, began hiking to San Ysidro Peak in Anza-Borrego Desert State Park with 
two other Boy Scouts, who later decided against the climb and returned to their 
troop in the park. 
</P>
<P>
But Scott and Nielson continued up a ridge toward the 6,100-foot peak. 
</P>
<P>
When they did not return by evening, Boy Scout officials alerted authorities. 
The Sheriff's Department sent 50 members from its search and rescue unit. The 
San Diego Mountain Rescue Team dispatched 12, and the De Anza Rescue Unit sent 
20. 
</P>
<P>
Scott and Nielson, who carried neither food nor sleeping bags, were dressed in 
lightweight clothes. During the night, temperatures on the mountain dropped 
into the 30s, said John Wehbring, president of the volunteer San Diego Mountain 
Rescue Team. 
</P>
<P>
Officers in a Sheriff's Department helicopter saw the boys and airlifted them 
at 8 a.m. Sunday, said Sheriff's Sgt. Jim Cook. The boys did not appear to be 
injured, Wehbring said.

ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I commend The Times for your special report At The Crossroads (Dec. 10) and for 
your continuing coverage of important environmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
The report was an excellent summary of the environmental problems which face 
not only the Southern California area, but the rest of the state, and our 
nation as well. 
</P>
<P>
It is perhaps not surprising that the severity of our environmental problems 
has given Southern California a leadership role in developing and implementing 
solutions -- which could become models for others to follow. 
</P>
<P>
In developing these solutions, however, it is important that we recognize the 
interrelated nature of these problems, and focus on their root causes. For 
example, 80% of the major smog producing pollutants in California are the 
result of the production or consumption of energy in its various forms. Once we 
realize this relationship, it becomes clear that any meaningful, long-term 
solution to our air quality problems (as well as our transportation problems) 
must include consideration of the way we produce and consume energy. 
</P>
<P>
At the state level, the Senate and Assembly recently initiated a cooperative 
venture to address the interrelated nature of energy and environmental 
problems. The Joint Committee on Energy Regulation and the Environment, which I 
chair, has begun an in-depth examination of three critical areas: (1) 
electricity resources and environmental impacts; (2) energy efficiency as a 
coordinated environmental and energy strategy; and (3) integrated solutions to 
energy, air quality, and vehicle problems. We intend to provide our next 
governor with a blueprint for restructuring and coordinating programs to 
address these problems. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990s will truly be the decade of decision on environmental, energy and 
transportation problems for all Californians.

The Jan. 12 Metro section had an account of developer Charles Tarrats who, 
without a Costal Commission permit, built a 2 1/2-mile road through Malibu's 
largely unspoiled upper Ramirez Canyon. His picture shows him holding a Bible.

METALLIC BALLOONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Recently, while driving south on the Harbor Freeway between Imperial and 
Rosecrans, I saw a group of about five metallic balloons tied together floating 
above. They came to rest to the west of the freeway on power lines, at which 
time a series of flashes ensued. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, two or three (possibly more) of these power lines were severed and 
fell earthward. 
</P>
<P>
The balloon manufacturer has made its profit and the public collectively shares 
in the costly repair. 
</P>
<P>
Of course this pales in comparison with the scenario whereby lives are 
endangered due to dangling live wires. 
</P>
<P>
Metallic balloons are not an essential to our quality of life, and as a result 
of my experience, I cannot imagine reason enough for their continued existence.

Jesse Jackson (Op-Ed Page column, Jan. 4) and Charlton Heston (letter, Jan. 12) 
are both wrong.

What guns "create" is power. This may be used for good or evil. It may lead to 
democracy, but it may create totalitarianism, institutionalized racism, 
theocracy -- you name it. 
</P>

As Gandhi demonstrated, when people are ready for freedom, their moral force is 
more effective than guns. He was, obviously, the man of the century.

WILL FREEDOM FROM APARTHEID BE NEXT?; 
</P>
<P>
SOUTH AFRICA: WITH THE WORLD IN MOTION AND THE COSTS OF SYSTEMATIC RACISM 
SKY-HIGH, PRETORIA'S LEADERS RECOGNIZE THAT DEMOCRATIC CHANGE IS INEVITABLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESSE JACKSON, The Rev. Jesse Jackson is a syndicated columnist in 
Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As democracy emerges from the shell of tyranny all over the Earth, people of 
good will look expectantly to South Africa. For if Vaclav Havel, a liberal 
playwright, can become president of Czechoslovakia, if the people of Romania 
can abolish the despised secret police, if Mikhail Gorbachev can suggest that 
the Soviet Union will tolerate new political parties, then we have reason to 
hope that the government of South Africa can drop the dehumanizing and brutal 
system of apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
As a new world is born, we pray that the 23 million blacks of South Africa will 
be next to gain their freedom and find peace with justice in their land, which 
is now run by a minority of 4.5 million whites. 
</P>
<P>
I, for one, am hopeful of the prospect for peaceful social reconstruction in 
South Africa. After 10 years of appeals, I have been granted a visa to go there 
later this month at the invitation of the South African Council of Churches, 
headed by Frank Chikane, and Walter and Albertina Sisulu of the African 
National Congress. It is also significant that I have received an invitation 
from the National Religious Broadcasters and the Dutch Reformed Church, to 
which the majority of Afrikaners belong and which holds that apartheid is 
heresy and "cannot be accepted on Christian ethical grounds." 
</P>
<P>
Whenever the theological rationale for oppression is eroded, and the moral 
foundations of domination begin to desolve, political change soon follows. If 
it is morally wrong, it cannot be politically right. 
</P>
<P>
My hope is that my visit will help further improve the climate of rebuilding, 
conciliation and reconstruction in South Africa at this crucial moment. 
</P>
<P>
There is so much damage to be undone. The apartheid system has brutalized and 
degraded the black majority: no vote, no voice, no justice, no respect. These 
are the realities of life for black people, our brothers and sisters, in South 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
And yet they have never accepted their oppression. More than 2,000 peaceful 
black demonstrators have lost their lives at the hands of South African police 
since the most recent round of resistance and protest began in the early 1980s. 
The courage of these martyrs focused the attention of the world on the brutal 
state of emergency imposed by the government. Soon after, nations around the 
globe imposed economic sanctions against South Africa. In October, 1986, the 
U.S. Congress, over the objection of President Ronald Reagan, and led by Rep. 
Ronald V. Dellums (D-Berkeley), passed a sanctions bill. 
</P>
<P>
Today, this strategy bears fruit. According to a recent bank study, foreign 
economic sanctions cost South Africa $32 billion to $40 billion between 1985 
and 1989, including at least $11 billion in net capital outflow and $4 billion 
in lost exports. South Africa's isolation during the 1980s has helped turn 
around the thinking of its leaders, who now recognize that the course of 
democratic change is irresistible and inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
President Frederik W. de Klerk has promised and delivered on a number of modest 
reforms. He has freed several political prisoners, effectively legalized many 
formerly banned political organizations and desegregated many beaches and 
public facilities. 
</P>
<P>
We may finally be moving to a South Africa beyond fear and distrust, beyond 
apartheid and the Group Areas Act, beyond pass laws and the cruel state of 
emergency. We may finally see a South Africa that is no longer based on the 
exploitation of one racial group by another. 
</P>
<P>
When Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was living in the throes of American apartheid, 
and his people were being killed, he dreamed of a new society beyond apartheid. 
We must now have such a dream for South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
A new South Africa will be a place of hope, where those who have had the 
advantage see the light and those who have been kept down finally share in the 
bounty of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
A new South Africa will profit from the tremendous leadership of African 
National Congress leader Nelson Mandela (who may soon be released from prison), 
Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the Rev. Allan Boesak, the Sisulus. It will rejoice in 
the splendor of all of its peoples, their creativity, passion and brilliance. 
It will triumph not through violence and hatred but through peace and justice. 
Democracy will replace tyranny in South Africa, and equality will take the 
place of domination. 
</P>
<P>
A new South Africa will be a thriving center of economic prosperity and growth 
on the African continent. It will be a powerhouse and a beacon among countries. 
It will not be isolated and vilified. It will be celebrated and dignified 
because of its accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
South Africa can kick off a historic transformation in the spirit and life of 
the African people. It can help the rest of the world lay to rest once and for 
all the discredited ideology of racism. It can renew its place in the community 
of nations. It can make history. It can throw away hysteria. It need only take 
a deep breath and blow down the house of apartheid.

DEMOCRACY IS THIN GRUEL WHEN CUPBOARDS ARE EMPTY; 
</P>
<P>
POLAND: THE GOVERNMENT IS THREATENED WITH STRIKES -- AND WORSE -- UNLESS IT CAN 
PUT FOOD AND FUEL ON THE MARKET. FOREIGN AID IS NEEDED IMMEDIATELY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED WARNER NEAL, Fred Warner Neal is professor emeritus of international 
relations at the Claremont Graduate School and executive vice president of the 
American Committee on U.S.-Soviet Relations. He has just returned from a visit 
to Poland and the Soviet Union. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A rapidly approaching crisis in Poland may well determine the ultimate success 
or failure of the revolutionary developments taking place in the Soviet Union 
and Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The economic situation in Poland is entangled in domestic and international 
complications. The initial steps taken by the new government to overcome it 
have included a restraint on wage increases and a sharp increase in prices -- 
and this in a land already suffering from galloping inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Every time in the last 15 years when there has been a general price increase in 
Poland, widespread strikes and serious political crises have developed. The 
only way a repetition of this scenario can now be avoided would seem to be 
immediate, massive infusions of direct foreign assistance -- several billions 
of dollars, in the opinion of some Polish economists. Western Europe has come 
up with $720 million for this year, and the United States has pledged $500 
million. The Japanese have promised aid. But it is doubtfule that the 
assistance will be enough and in sufficient time to make an impact when it is 
needed, which is in the immediate future. 
</P>
<P>
There are two major political groups in Poland, Solidarity and the Communist 
Party, and each is divided into three factions: a trade union-oriented wing, a 
democratic reformist wing and a radical reformist wing. The moderate wing of 
Solidarity now dominates the government. With the new price increases, the 
trade-union wing of Solidarity is pressuring for nationwide strikes. This would 
be disastrous. But if the Solidarity group doesn't call for strikes, the 
trade-union wing of the party is almost certain to do so. 
</P>
<P>
One reason for popular support for Solidarity was a widespread belief that 
leaders like Lech Walesa could produce foreign assistance to ease the shortage 
of consumer goods. This faith now appears to be waning. Understandably, the 
Polish population is more concerned with being able to buy food and fuel than 
with the government's structural reforms. Popular participation in the 
democratic process was sufficient to defeat the Communists, but it has not been 
really widespread. In the elections last July, voter turnout was about 38%; in 
a critical by-election in October, it was only 14%. 
</P>
<P>
With the discrediting of the Communist Party, Solidarity is the major, if not 
the only, force holding the Polish government together. Should it now falter, 
the result would likely be chaotic. Waiting on the sidelines, in anticipation 
of just such a development, are two small, right-wing parties, believed to have 
allies in the Polish army. These groups manifest all the characteristics of 
traditional Polish nationalist extremism -- violently anti-Soviet and with 
anti-Semitic tendencies. Already they have been demanding a return to Poland of 
territory seized by the Soviet Union during and after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Of all the Eastern European countries, Poland is considered by the Soviet Union 
as the most important from a geopolitical and strategic point of view. 
Gorbachev has proclaimed, and thus far observed, a strictly hands-off policy on 
Eastern European developments. He would be hard-pressed to maintain that policy 
if the crisis in Poland should result in a right-wing, openly anti-Soviet 
regime and raise the border issue. Soviet reticence would be especially 
difficult in the face of continued threats of secession by the neighboring 
Baltic republics. German pressures for reunification constitute another 
worrisome factor for the Kremlin in this connection, with some German groups 
calling for a return of East Prussian territories that are now part of Poland 
and the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet intervention -- direct or indirect -- in Poland would certainly produce 
a strong negative response from the West. This in turn would pose a serious 
threat to Gorbachev's valiant efforts in both domestic and foreign policy and 
possibly doom the renaissance of democracy throughout Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
If developments in Poland are the key, then Western aid to Poland is crucial. 
The question is whether the aid will be sufficient and whether there is time 
for it to have a beneficial impact.

NORTHWESTERNERS CAN JUST KNOCK IT OFF; 
</P>
<P>
MIGRATION: WE HEAR THEY DON'T LIKE IT WHEN CALIFORNIANS MOVE IN. BUT FACE IT, 
SEATTLE WAS PRETTY DULL BEFORE THE IMMIGRANTS MADE IT COME ALIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SYBERT, Richard Sybert is a lawyer and writer in Los Angeles.

<TEXT>
<P>
We hear word now and then, when it's a slow news day, that the folks up in 
Seattle are being unkind, or even downright unfriendly, to Californians moving 
north. They don't like the growth, they don't like the traffic, and they 
especially don't like the fact that people moving from California can sell 
their houses here for big bucks and then buy what they want in the Pacific 
Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
I think this is pretty silly. I was born in Southern California and live here, 
but I have enough Northwest qualifications to know what a "gooey duck" is and 
where to find one. I used to live and work in Seattle, and still regularly 
visit my two sisters, niece and nephew there. 
</P>
<P>
So I don't feel too uncomfortable suggesting that Seattle-ites knock it off. 
Americans can move and live any darned place they please, including Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
If the locals think the place is getting too crowded, let them move out and 
give other people a chance. 
</P>
<P>
What is ironic about this is that so many of the people in Seattle are from 
somewhere else, anyway. A hundred years ago Seattle was a one-horse town with a 
handful of settlers still sliding trees down Yesler Way, the original Skid 
Road. Even 20 years ago, it was a depressed little city where the sale of one 
or two jetliners was front-page news. 
</P>
<P>
Newcomers have made Seattle what it is. It is the refugees from other places 
who have changed Seattle into a charming provincial town. Most of the good 
urban things that have come to Seattle -- restaurants, coffee houses, the arts 
-- came from California in the first place. And new blood does a body good. The 
indigenous Northwesterner, after all, is a Norwegian in jeans and a Pendleton 
eating french fries with ketchup in the rain. 
</P>
<P>
Dig deep enough, in fact, and you'll find that most of the people making the 
biggest fuss about population growth in Seattle are the folks who just got 
there themselves. They're people relieved about escaping the congestion and 
crime of New York or San Francisco who are now determined to pull the 
drawbridge up. 
</P>
<P>
This is the politics of selfishness, and it is just plain wrong. What gives any 
of us the right to deny to others what we claim for ourselves? This is not 
medieval Europe, where some landed aristocracy has prior claims. This is 
America, land of the free. We're all part of one country, and one of the 
freedoms that made this country great is the freedom to live where you want. 
</P>
<P>
No place is frozen in time. Instead of complaining, Seattle ought to welcome 
the dynamism and creativity that is flowing to it. A little bit of Hollywood, 
after all, might do it some good. Seattle has beautiful scenery, some good 
restaurants, and a fine community ethos. But it's not exactly life in the fast 
lane. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, many people like it that way. But they're not the only ones who get 
to vote. And if someone from California comes north with a pot of money from 
selling a house down here, maybe that's fair for having put up with traffic and 
bad air for so many years. They ought to be welcomed to the community as people 
with get-up-and-go, not have noses turned up at them. If Seattle is indeed all 
it's cracked up to be, then one should expect a little class from its 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
So that's the message from down south, Seattle-ites. You'll always be welcome 
at Disneyland, and we can find another spot on the freeways for you. And we're 
glad to share our sunshine, too. Welcome.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL: UCLA FRESHMAN TRACY MURRAY GETS FIRST START AND SCORES 25 
POINTS DURING 106-97 VICTORY OVER CALIFORNIA.

<P>
The timing couldn't have been much more curious. 
</P>
<P>
Or the results more spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
After missing all eight of his shots and failing to score on Thursday night in 
a loss at Stanford, Tracy Murray marked the occasion of his first collegiate 
start on Sunday by making nine of 10 shots, scoring a season-high 25 points and 
passing for a season-high seven assists in UCLA's 106-97 victory over 
California. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA, apparently, has finally found a starting center. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him a long time ago that he was a starter," Coach Jim Harrick said of 
Murray. "They just didn't announce his name." 
</P>
<P>
From now on, they will. 
</P>
<P>
Murray, who made five of six three-point shot attempts, provided a spark as the 
Bruins played probably their best game of the season in running their record to 
12-3 and 6-1 in the Pacific 10 Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Cal (13-5, 4-3) made 51.5% of its shots, had only six turnovers despite the 
frantic pace and stayed even with the taller Bruins on the boards, and never 
led in the last 31 1/2 minutes in front of 6,578. 
</P>
<P>
"You just don't figure on UCLA playing a superb game like that and shooting 65% 
from the floor," Cal Coach Lou Campanelli said. 
</P>
<P>
Especially on the road, in front of a hostile crowd. 
</P>
<P>
The fast pace, though, was much to the Bruins' liking. 
</P>
<P>
"This is our style of play," Harrick said. "We're an up-tempo team. We like to 
run the floor. We like to play against the press. It gives you a lot of shots. 
We had a lot of good, quality shots." 
</P>
<P>
They made 39 of 60, including 10 of 13 three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
"Our guys like it when they're not guarded," Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
Don MacLean, upset with the way Campanelli used him last summer at the Olympic 
Sports Festival and determined not to let the Cal coach forget it, made 11 of 
16 shots and led UCLA with 27 points and 12 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I'm going to let him beat me for my next three years," MacLean 
said of Campanelli. "I'm going to make sure of that." 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Madkins made six of seven shots, including four of five three-point 
shots, and scored a career-high 20 points for UCLA. Trevor Wilson scored 16 
points and Darrick Martin had 10 points and seven assists. 
</P>
<P>
And then there was Murray. 
</P>
<P>
A freshman from Glendora High, where he was the state's all-time leading scorer 
and averaged a national-best 44.3 points a game last season, he was 
nevertheless surprised when Harrick pulled him aside at practice on Saturday 
and told him he was going to start against the Bears. 
</P>
<P>
He'd never gone zero for eight, as he did at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't expect it," Murray said, "but he gave me the chance, so I went ahead 
and played to the best of my ability." 
</P>
<P>
Harrick said that he had contemplated the move for a month, but didn't want to 
rush the 6-foot-8 Murray into the starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
But when senior Kevin Walker unexpectedly struggled through the first month of 
the season and his replacement, former walk-on Keith Owens, was unproductive in 
three starts, Murray's time had finally come. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt that I just couldn't wait any longer," Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
Murray made all four of his shots, including three three-point baskets, as the 
Bruins riddled a Cal zone in the first half. UCLA made 12 of its first 16 
shots, including five three-point baskets, to open a 33-26 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Cal last led at 26-23, but pulled to within 39-38 with 6:45 left in the first 
half. But UCLA then outscored the Bears, 15-6, to assume a 54-44 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins then made eight of their first nine shots in the second half, 
increasing their advantage to 66-51, before the Bears rallied. Cal, which got a 
season-high 31 points from freshman center Bryan Hendrick, twice cut its 
deficit to three points, the last time at 86-83 with 6:10 left. 
</P>
<P>
It was still a five-point game before Murray helped the Bruins pull away, first 
scoring on a tip-in, then passing to Wilson for a short bank shot and finally 
making a pair of free throws after rebounding a missed free throw by Wilson to 
make it 98-89 with 2:21 left. 
</P>
<P>
Bruin Notes 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's 65% shooting was its best of the season, surpassing a 60% effort last 
month in a 115-66 rout of East Tennessee State. "The nets are scorched beyond 
repair," Cal Coach Lou Campanelli said. "We'll put up new ones tomorrow." . . . 
UCLA has won 60 of its past 62 games against Cal, but Campanelli said: "I can't 
find fault with anything we did." . . . The Golden Bears had never scored as 
many points in a losing effort. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Owens spent the entire game on the bench after scoring four points and 
grabbing four rebounds in three games as UCLA's starting center. . . . Tracy 
Murray scored his previous season high, 20 points, last month against American. 
. . . Gerald Madkins' previous career high of 15 points was achieved against 
Louisville this month and against Washington State two years ago. He scored one 
point on Thursday night at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Smith and Roy Fisher each had 18 points and eight assists for Cal as the 
two teams combined for the fourth-highest point total in Harmon Arena history. 
. . . Murray, asked by a Bay Area reporter if he expected to soon be "the man" 
for UCLA: "This is a team. There's no man here." 
</P>
<P>
The victory was Jim Harrick's 200th as a major college coach. He was 167-97 in 
nine seasons at Pepperdine, is 33-13 in his second season at UCLA. . . . UCLA 
made a season-high 10 three-point shots and had a season-high 28 assists. . . . 
Cal is only the third team to make more than 50% of its shots against UCLA this 
season. The other two, Notre Dame and Louisville, beat the Bruins. . . . Trevor 
Wilson had a season-low four rebounds.

<P>
No longer content to remain civil on the court here Sunday afternoon, the 
Lakers considered every Detroit Piston elbow and shove, every stare and glare, 
as an act of aggression. As such, the only recourse was to launch a 
counter-offensive. 
</P>
<P>
As physical and aggressive as the self-dubbed "Bad Boys" ever have been, the 
Lakers wrenched control of the lead in the third quarter and then, like 
neighborhood bullies, held down the squirming Pistons in the fourth quarter for 
a 107-97 victory. 
</P>
<P>
When provoked, the Lakers are capable of pounding it out with anyone, including 
such heavyweights as the NBA's defending champions. And, seven consecutive 
losses to the Pistons, including last season's four-game sweep in the NBA 
Finals, provided all the provocation the Lakers needed. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they've ever seen their own style used against them like that by 
us," Laker forward James Worthy said. "I think it might have surprised them. We 
played the bump and grind. The Celtics use to do that against us, and we 
reacted the same way." 
</P>
<P>
Just as, a few seasons back, the Lakers had trouble beating the Boston Celtics, 
their erstwhile rival, they felt they needed a victory against the Pistons 
Sunday to heal any psychological scars. 
</P>
<P>
To do so, the Lakers turned to the credo know thy enemy. Only they took it a 
step further and imitated the Pistons' aggressive style. 
</P>
<P>
This time, it was the Lakers who flexed their strength on the boards for a 
43-42 rebounding advantage. It was the Lakers who used strong play off the 
bench. And, it was the Lakers who, in a reversal from form, incurred all blows 
and did not squander a significant fourth-quarter lead. 
</P>
<P>
In short, the Lakers finally have found a way to beat the Pistons. Whether 
their tactics will work again, should the teams meet in June for the NBA title, 
obviously is not known. But the Lakers (28-9) certainly did not want the 
prospect of carrying a losing streak against Detroit into the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"This win is more for our mind-set than anything else," Johnson said. "We came 
in here and beat the world champions. We've heard all that 0-7 stuff and now, 
we got that win and we know what to do to win." 
</P>
<P>
Piston players sloughed off the significance of Sunday's game, but gave the 
Lakers credit for not backing down and, in fact, fighting back. 
</P>
<P>
"They were really tough," said Piston forward Dennis Rodman, looking and 
sounding as surprised as the bully who gets his nose punched. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to be physical, and we had to be tough with them," Johnson said. "Their 
whole thing is coming out and being aggressive and intimidate you. If you don't 
meet that with your own (aggressiveness), then they are going to take you out 
of everything." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers not only gave shots, they took them without flinching. 
</P>
<P>
While Piston forward Mark Aguirre would be carried off on a stretcher with what 
turned out to be a minor back bruise, Worthy survived the collision and kept 
playing. 
</P>
<P>
By the same token, Laker center Mychal Thompson absorbed a flurry of slaps from 
Isiah Thomas -- a display not seen since Zsa Zsa Gabor was arrested -- late in 
the game and survived to play on. Thomas, who had 20 points and 10 assists, was 
ejected. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, it felt pretty good, like he (Thomas) was playing a Bahamian conga 
on my head," Thompson said of Thomas' blows to his neck and back of head. "It 
felt a little like a scalp massage. 
</P>
<P>
"We kept them in control because we were aggressive. We aren't a passive team. 
We're just so smooth it usually doesn't look like we're working hard." 
</P>
<P>
Assertiveness alone does not win games, however. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers still needed production from Worthy, who scored 26 of his 31 points 
in the first half, a 21-point, 16-assist output from Johnson, a third-quarter 
surge highlighted by the reemergence of Byron Scott and a consistently strong 
fourth quarter in which the Lakers' strong defense spawned offensive 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
In a departure from the Pistons' 108-97 overtime win over the Lakers at the 
Forum on Dec. 1, the Lakers this time started poorly and played well at the 
end. Coach Pat Riley had not planned on the start, but he had lectured his 
players in practice on Saturday about closing strong. 
</P>
<P>
If not for Worthy's prolific first half, the Lakers might have been too far 
behind to wage a decent second-half battle. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers missed their first five shots, and Detroit had a 7-0 lead before the 
ceremonial first elbow was even thrown. The Pistons opened as much as an 
11-point lead one minute into the second quarter -- paced by James Edwards, who 
had 19 of his 26 points in the first half -- before the Lakers followed 
Worthy's example and started being aggressive offensively. 
</P>
<P>
Worthy, in the first quarter, had 12 of the Lakers' 17 points. He made five of 
eight shots; the rest of the team one of 12. By halftime, Worthy had 26 points 
-- five above his season average. And, Worthy's defense limited Joe Dumars, the 
Pistons' leading scorer, to eight points. Dumars made just four of 13 shots. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank God for (Worthy)," Riley said. "He got down to business. I guess that's 
why he makes all that money." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers, thanks primarily to Worthy as well as contributions from reserves 
Orlando Woolridge and Michael Cooper, cut Detroit's lead to 53-50 at halftime. 
As the teams retreated to neutral corners, the Lakers began preparing their 
second-half offensive. 
</P>
<P>
It began with a dizzying 9-0 run that gave the Lakers' a 59-53 lead and finally 
forced Piston Coach Chuck Daly to call a timeout to assess casualties. Scott, 
scoreless in the first half and mired in a shooting slumping, made a 
three-point shot, followed A.C. Green's miss with an inside basket and then 
assisted on Johnson's basket during that stretch. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers' defense, meanwhile, forced the Pistons to miss their first eight 
shots and commit two turnovers. But Detroit seemingly had an easy two points 
when Mark Aguirre drove the basket for a layup with about seven minutes to play 
in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But Green caught up with Aguirre and contested the shot and then Worthy crashed 
into Aguirre out of bounds after the Piston forward had missed the layup. Both 
players lay entangled under the basket as play continued. 
</P>
<P>
Riley tried to call a 20-second timeout so that the players could be attended 
to, but no one heard him. Instead, Johnson sank a three-point shot for a 62-55 
Laker lead. 
</P>
<P>
When play was finally halted with 6:34 to play, Worthy emerged with a sore 
lower back and left hip. Aguirre did not emerge at all. Aguirre's back pain was 
so acute that he needed to be carried off on a stretcher. X-rays later showed 
no damage to Aguirre's vertebra. A team doctor later reported that Aguirre 
suffered a bruised lower back. 
</P>
<P>
That, basically, is the same injury as Worthy's. 
</P>
<P>
Worthy continued playing. Aguirre did not. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers continued to score, outside and inside, against the Pistons. Scott 
made two three-point shots in the quarter, Johnson one, and A.C. Green added 
six points, as the Lakers built as much as an 11-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit, conversely, missed its first 12 shots in the quarter. The drought 
finally was broken when Bill Laimbeer followed Thomas' miss with 4:41 to play. 
The Pistons finished the quarter making only four of 21 shots, enabling the 
Lakers to take an 80-69 lead into the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
In the Dec. 1 meeting, the Lakers took a six-point lead into the fourth quarter 
and extended the advantage to double figures before the Pistons took control, 
sent the game to overtime and then skunked the Lakers, 11-0, in the five-minute 
extra period. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers made sure the script was altered this time. 
</P>
<P>
Worthy's inside basket and accompanying free throw gave the Lakers a 14-point 
lead to open the quarter. Despite repeated Piston attacks, the Laker lead never 
dipped below five. In the final minutes, Thompson endured Thomas' slap attack 
and the Lakers' hardly flinched at the Pistons' last-gasp assault. The game 
ended, appropriately, with Johnson sinking a hook shot from the baseline.

<TEXT>
<P>
John McEnroe, the first player kicked out of the Australian Open for misconduct 
in its 85-year history, flew home to Los Angeles Monday. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe brushed silently past reporters at the airport and left with his wife, 
actress Tatum O'Neal, their two sons and his agent. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe threw his racket and a tantrum Sunday while leading his fourth-round 
match against Mikael Pernfors and was defaulted by the umpire. 
</P>
<P>
The action, which led to $6,500 in fines against McEnroe, made him the first 
player ejected for misconduct in any Grand Slam since pros and amateurs began 
playing together at the start of the open era in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
Two other players have been defaulted for bad behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Colombian-born Spaniard Willie Alvarez was defaulted from the French 
championships in 1963 and American Earl Cochell was ousted from the U.S. 
championships in the 1950s after a prematch altercation with officials. 
</P>
<P>
Third-seeded Stefan Edberg said McEnroe "only has himself to blame" for getting 
thrown out, but said his departure is "sad for the tournament." 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's done worse things than he did yesterday," Edberg said. "He's got 
a bad temper and he can't seem to do anything about it. Tennis has always had 
its characters. But the game needs players like John." 
</P>
<P>
Fellow American Aaron Krickstein, the fifth-seeded player who lost to David 
Wheaton today (Monday), said "some of the guys in the locker room said they 
were glad" McEnroe was thrown out. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe let himself get rattled by missed shots, close calls and a baby's 
cries, and after his default, with a 6-1, 4-6, 7-5, 2-4 lead, he admitted, "I 
don't really have anyone to blame but myself." 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe had been in Australia for three weeks with his family and seemed 
relaxed and fit. 
</P>
<P>
Yet all it took for McEnroe to revert to his old ways was a tough match against 
Pernfors, the Swedish-born two-time NCAA champion at Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
At one point in his match with Pernfors, McEnroe stood in front of a lineswoman 
he thought made a bad call. 
</P>
<P>
Bouncing a ball on his racket and glaring at her in intimidating fashion, 
McEnroe was hit with a code violation for unsportsmanlike conduct by umpire 
Gerry Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
He seemed to be in control of the match and himself again, but suddenly became 
distracted by a crying baby while serving the sixth game, with Pernfors ahead, 
3-2. 
</P>
<P>
"Give him a drink, the boy's hungry," McEnroe yelled, looking up in the section 
of the stands where the baby was crying. 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong asked the parents to take the baby out of the stadium, and after the 
mother and baby left, a fan yelled, "Can we breathe, John?" 
</P>
<P>
After his disqualification was announced, McEnroe simply packed his rackets and 
left. 
</P>
<P>
"It's appalling," said Mal Tuohey, one of the 15,000 screaming fans. "He'll 
never come back to Melbourne again, and I don't blame him."

MORNING BRIEFING: THE PROBLEM WITH THESE GUYS WAS THAT THEY GOT PUBLICITY

<P>
Earl Weaver, former manager of the Baltimore Orioles, and his Hall of Fame 
pitcher, Jim Palmer, often were at odds during their years together. 
</P>
<P>
Said Weaver: "We had arguments. I mean some pips. But the fact is we stayed 
together 16 years. Anybody with any sense would know that you had to get along. 
We'd go four, five, six days without talking to one another every now and then. 
</P>
<P>
"But the problems I had with Palmer, I had with anybody. It's in any 
employer-employee relationship. The difference is, when a stenographer gets mad 
at her boss and says a few words in the office, they don't get printed in the 
newspaper." 
</P>
<P>
Add baseball: Mike LaValliere, catcher for the Pittsburgh Pirates, now lives in 
Bradenton, Fla., the club's spring training site. 
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by Bob Smizik of the Pittsburgh Press on the possibility of a 
strike or lockout in February: "All that we have been told is to be ready for 
spring training, to treat everything like we will have spring training. But be 
prepared that there won't be spring training. That's what I'm doing." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: On Jan. 21, 1969, what two former National League stars were 
elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame? 
</P>
<P>
Welcome back: Many NFL observers attribute the resurgence of the Denver Broncos 
this season to the return of Mike Shanahan as quarterback coach after he was 
fired as coach of the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
Bronco quarterback John Elway said: "Mike has been great. I think you can look 
at the stats before Mike got here and after he got here. He and I are on the 
same page on a lot of things. It helps." 
</P>
<P>
Inferiority complex: Some Bronco fans said before the AFC championship game 
that it would be better for the Broncos to lose to the Cleveland Browns rather 
than risk a fourth Super Bowl humiliation. The Broncos won, and now are solid 
underdogs to the San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
Denver psychologist Mark Bailow said of such an attitude: "It's natural for 
fans to say they're disappointed, they're sad that their team lost. But people 
who don't even want them to play in the Super Bowl probably have less 
self-esteem than somebody who would say, 'Go for it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Signing off: University of Arizona public-address announcer Roger Sedlmayr, 58, 
has a reputation in the Pacific 10 Conference for his enthusiasm at the 
microphone. 
</P>
<P>
School officials recently suspended Sedlmayr, a Tucson city councilman, for two 
games because of his unabashed homerism during a game against Cal. When an 
Arizona shot missed, Sedlmayr, unaware the mike was open, shouted painfully, 
"Oh, Gaaaawwwwdd!" 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: The Dodgers' Roy Campanella and Stan Musial of the St. Louis 
Cardinals. 
</P>

the Detroit Pistons: "I could yell at officials and they couldn't do anything

IT TAKES TIME, BUT VIRGINIA GETS ACC WIN

<TEXT>
<P>
Don't look for Virginia Coach Terry Holland to get too excited about the 
Cavaliers' 81-79 Atlantic Coast Conference victory over No. 11 Georgia Tech in 
overtime Sunday at Charlottesville, Va. 
</P>
<P>
"You hate to be winless in the league, but we can only enjoy this for about 30 
minutes before we have to get ready for Virginia Tech and a four-game road 
trip," Holland said. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia's Kenny Turner, who had not scored since the first half, made a 
10-foot jump shot with six seconds left for the winning basket. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore forward Bryant Stith had a career-high 30 points for the Cavaliers, 
who recorded their first ACC win after four losses. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia, which led by as many as 13 points in the first half, found itself 
down, 66-65, with Georgia Tech's Karl Brown at the free-throw line for a 
one-and-one with 14 seconds remaining in regulation. 
</P>
<P>
Brown made the first foul shot to make it 67-65, but missed his second shot. 
Brian Oliver made a 16-foot shot for Virginia with one second left to send the 
game into overtime. It was Oliver's only basket of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
A four-point play by John Crotty, who was fouled by Brown as he made a 
three-point basket, and a pair of free throws by Stith put Virginia ahead, 
75-71, with 2:35 left in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Tech's Dennis Scott made two three-point shots in the last 1:01, the 
second with 29 seconds remaining, to make the score 79-79 before Turner made 
the game-winner. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman point guard Kenny Anderson of the Yellow Jackets missed a 20-footer 
just before the final buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
No. 25 Alabama 70, No. 13 LSU 55 -- James Sanders scored 21 points and helped 
hold Chris Jackson, the Southeastern Conference's leading scorer, far below his 
average as the Crimson Tide upset the Tigers at Tuscaloosa, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders and Keith Askins combined to hold Jackson, who was averaging 28.3 
points, to only 11 before he fouled out with just over a minute left. 
</P>
<P>
The victory left Alabama, LSU and Tennessee in a three-way tie for the SEC lead 
with 4-2 records. 
</P>
<P>
LSU (11-3) closed to four points early in the second half. Then, with Alabama 
(13-4) leading, 44-39, Sanders made two baskets, one a three-point shot, David 
Benoit added a basket and Alabama was led, 51-41, with 11:20 left. The Tigers 
trailed, 59-51, with five minutes left after two baskets by Shaquille O'Neal, 
but Sanders and Melvin Cheatum scored to extend the lead for Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
Vermont 64, Dartmouth 55 -- Matt Johnson and Rahim Huland El each made four 
free throws in the final minute to clinch the win at Burlington, Vt. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Roberson recorded an unusual triple-double for the Catamounts (7-8). He 
scored 20 points, had 17 rebounds and blocked 11 shots. 
</P>
<P>
James Blackwell led Dartmouth (8-6) with 18 points. 
</P>
<P>
Hawaii 74, New Mexico 71 -- Chris Gaines scored 24 points, including nine in 
the final 10 minutes, as the Rainbows beat the Lobos in a Western Athletic 
Conference game Saturday night at Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
Hawaii (15-4, 4-2 in the WAC) took its first lead of the game at 59-57 when 
Gaines made an 18-foot jump shot with 9:46 left. The Rainbows never trailed the 
rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
Luc Longley scored 26 points for New Mexico (9-9, 1-5).

All Patty Sheehan was trying to do was hold on. And she did, despite a final 
round of four-over-par 75 in the Jamaica Classic. 
</P>
<P>
It was still good enough to get the job done by three strokes in the first LPGA 
tournament of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Sheehan began the day with a five-shot cushion and easily won the 54-hole 
tournament with a 1-under 212 total. She earned the $75,000 first prize plus a 
bonus of $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Bradley, Lynn Connelly and Jane Geddes tied for second at 215. Patti Rizzo 
and Muffin Spencer-Devlin were at 216. 
</P>
<P>
Sheehan, who shot 69 on the first day and 68 on the second, began the final day 
well. But after she birdied the par-five fifth hole, she got bogeys on four of 
the next six holes. 
</P>
<P>
Sheehan, 33, recovered and parred the next six holes. With her victory almost 
assured, she finished the tournament with another bogey. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley made a late bid with a four-under 67 that included three birdies and 
six pars on the front nine. 
</P>
<P>
Spencer-Devlin and Maggie Will finished with 68s and Geddes and Rizzo ended at 
69. 
</P>
<P>
Beth Daniel shot the best round of the tournament, a 65, but finished at 219. 
Defending champion Betsy King shot 77 and wound up at 224.

<P>
Michael Jordan made sure it didn't come down to one shot this time. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan scored 42 points, 15 in the first 10 minutes, and the Chicago Bulls led 
from start to finish in a 117-109 victory over the New York Knicks Sunday at 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to control the tempo of the game," Jordan said. "We came out 
enthused and we put them on their heels. We didn't want it to come down to one 
shot." 
</P>
<P>
Jordan was referring to last Monday's 109-106 loss in New York, when Trent 
Tucker hit a game-winning three-pointer after taking an inbounds pass with 
one-tenth of a second left. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulls have protested the game, claiming it is impossible to get off a shot 
in such a short time. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't play well in New York, but we still felt that the game was a draw 
because of human error," Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago scored the first nine points of the game this time and Jordan sank all 
18 of his free throws in the second half to hold off the Knicks as Chicago won 
its 15th straight game at home. 
</P>
<P>
New York's Patrick Ewing was held to 16 points, 12 below his average, and sat 
out much of the third quarter with four fouls. It was only the sixth time in 39 
games this season that Ewing was held under 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
Golden State 120, Boston 115 -- Chris Mullin scored 20 of his 30 points in the 
second half and the Warriors beat the Celtics to snap a 12-year losing streak 
at Boston Garden and give Coach Don Nelson his 600th NBA victory. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson, who helped the Celtics to five NBA championships as a player, became 
the 10th coach in NBA history to win 600 games. He has a 600-404 record in 13 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
scored 25. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 127, Miami 101 -- Ricky Pierce scored 11 his 22 points in the second 
quarter and the Bucks won their fourth straight game by downing the Heat at 
Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
Alvin Robertson added 19 points, 15 rebounds and 11 assists for the Bucks, and 
Jay Humphries also scored 19. 
</P>
<P>
Portland 115, Charlotte 100 -- Jerome Kersey scored 26 points and Kevin 
Duckworth added 23 as the Trail Blazers turned back the Hornets at Portland. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the Trail Blazers' 16th in their last 17 games.

JOCKEYS GIVE CANANI 1-2 FINISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAY HOVDEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Corey Black and Jorge Velasquez, old pals from their expatriate riding days in 
Paris, convened a personal reunion at Santa Anita Sunday on the winning end of 
the $173,100 San Marcos Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
Black, riding the French horse Putting, hung a half-length decision on 
Velasquez, aboard the English horse Colway Rally, while up in the press box 
trainer Julio Canani quietly savored his 1-2 sweep of the 1 1/4-mile turf 
event. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't even have to root," the Peruvian trainer said. "I was two lengths in 
front of the field." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, it was four lengths back at the finish to the third horse, favored 
Live the Dream, who may have been the unluckiest of several unlucky horses in 
the field of 13. 
</P>
<P>
"My trip? A trifle horrendous," said Live the Dream's jockey, Chris McCarron, 
in his best Trevor Denman accent. "One horse came up on my inside, eliminating 
a lot of options, and then the horse I was following got stopped." 
</P>
<P>
Laffit Pincay, who was trying to make second choice Wretham his fifth winner of 
the day, would not be outdone by McCarron's horror stories. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a lot of horses in there that didn't belong," Pincay said after 
Wretham weaved his way home ninth. "I had no place to run from the five-eighths 
to the wire." 
</P>
<P>
Black, on the other hand, had no complaints. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a perfect trip," said the 21-year-old Black, who won the San Fernando 
Stakes the previous Sunday. "Once I got my horse covered up, he relaxed great. 
After that, it was just a matter of asking him to run." 
</P>
<P>
Black perfected his skills in "covering up" his horses -- placing them behind 
the opposition to conserve their energies -- during a spring and summer of 
riding in France in 1987. In 1986 the native of Westminster was California's 
leading apprentice. 
</P>
<P>
During that same summer of '87, Velasquez also was riding regularly in France. 
At the age of 41 and entering the twilight of his career, the former national 
champion was treating himself to one last international lark. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember riding against Corey a lot over there," Velasquez said after the 
San Marcos. "He beat me a couple of close ones, too." 
</P>
<P>
The irony was not lost on Black. 
</P>
<P>
"How about that, Jorgie!" Black said when he returned to the jocks' room. "Two 
European horses and a couple of old European riders." 
</P>
<P>
Velasquez grinned and shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to quit picking on me," Velasquez told Black. "I'm old enough to be 
your dad." 
</P>
<P>
Not only did Black and Putting beat Velasquez for first money, they may have 
compromised his early position in the race as well. 
</P>
<P>
At the start Colway Rally stumbled and found himself at the back of the field 
as they made their way down the hillside onto the main course. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted him behind horses," Velasquez said. "But not quite that far behind. 
Luckily, I was able to get a good position. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, all of a sudden everybody got off the rail," the rider added. "My horse 
saw daylight and took off.' 
</P>
<P>
The last horse to angle away from the rail was Putting, and Black was delighted 
when he saw Colway Rally pull Velasquez to the lead. After that, things went 
smoothly for the winner. At the head of the stretch, longshot Two Moccasins 
politely faded away to give Putting a clean run at the leader. 
</P>
<P>
Canani, who broke a frustrating three-month stakes drought with his sweep, 
credited the addition of blinkers to Putting's equipment for the victory. 
Putting had not won in nearly two years, while turning in respectable races to 
such top horses as Great Communicator, Pranke and Lively One. 
</P>
<P>
In his most recent start, Putting was beaten by a nose by Splendor Catch in a 
Jan. 4 allowance race at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
"That was his last chance," Canani said. "I hadn't put blinkers on him before 
because he had been running good, even without winning. But he was cheating on 
me. The other day he had the length of the stretch to go by that other horse." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Canani is convinced Colway Rally deserves the benefit of the 
doubt. The 6-year-old son of Final Straw cut a chunk out of a front foot when 
he stumbled and still ended up finishing second for the third time in three 
North American races. 
</P>
<P>
"You wait and see," Canani vowed. "He's going to turn out to be a nice horse 
around here." 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Putting, owned by Jay Goldinger of Beverly Hills, paid $19 to win. Canani's 
third San Marcos starter, Prince Ruffian, finished sixth. . . . Laffit Pincay 
won four straight races Sunday, beginning in the second with Zoe Akins and 
ending with Sam McGee in the fifth. . . . Wayne Lukas won two races Sunday to 
move into a tie at the top of the trainer standings with Brian Mayberry. Lukas 
provided Pincay with Autumn Beauty, a half-brother to 1979 Del Mar Futurity 
winner The Carpenter, and then snapped Pincay's win streak with Blushing John's 
half-brother Five on Five in the sixth race. 
</P>
<P>
Assyrian Pirate put himself in the picture for the top 3-year-old races of the 
meeting with a four-length victory in the 1 1/16-mile seventh race. The 
California-bred son of Pirate's Bounty is trained by Lewis Cenicola. . . . 
Champion mare Bayakoa moved a step closer to her 1990 debut with an effortless 
seven-furlong workout Sunday morning, timed in 1:27. Trainer Ron McAnally will 
nominate the Argentine mare to the Feb. 4 Santa Maria Handicap. . . . Two local 
Derby candidates also worked Sunday. Sunny Slope Stakes winner Pleasant Tap 
went a mile in 1:40 and Hollywood Juvenile Championship winner Magical Mile 
went a half-mile in :48 1/5.

Louder Than Words: 22 Authors Donate New Stories to Benefit Share Our 
Strength's Fight Against Hunger, Homelessness and Illiteracy edited by William 
Shore (Vintage Books: $9.95.; 335 pages.) 
</P>
<P>
Two things to get out of the way: 
</P>
<P>
* You don't have to buy this book simply because the writers have donated their 
stories and the publisher will donate all proceeds from "Louder Than Words" to 
the hungry, homeless and illiterate. The money that comes from selling short 
stories could be equaled in half a minute by a society matron in a good mood. 
</P>
<P>
* The fact that the last story in this collection is written by Carolyn See is 
an honor for me but probably an embarrassment to the collection -- more about 
that later. 
</P>
<P>
The idea was good but simple. Ask 22 writers to think about the homeless, the 
hungry. Then . . . have them turn in a story. The editor was, generally 
speaking, inspired in his choice of writers. Taken across the board, these 
names represent some of the most thoughtful and original work being done in 
America today. But with the exception of elegant household words like Anne 
Tyler, Louise Erdrich and Joyce Carol Oates, the reputations of all the others 
are still forming. Madison Smartt Bell, Mona Simpson and Ethan Canin all have 
their rabid fans, their career watchers. Each one of these 22 has bet his or 
her life on changing the world through words. Each one of these 22 stories will 
have a unique linchpin place in 22 separate bodies of work. 
</P>
<P>
These stories are uneven, and sometimes almost distressingly original. The 
writers have taken the cliche that "the homeless are just like us" and made it 
true. The homeless are us -- that's scary. Both Richard Russo and Lee K. Abbott 
tell stories of men pitched out of their domestic lives. In the Russo story, a 
young guy takes a sock at his wife and the next minute his in-laws have bought 
him a plane ticket to nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Dorris, who has written so movingly before about Native Americans, has 
produced a goofy love-comedy about a young Indian brave trying to get into the 
good graces of his prospective mother-in-law's family. Anyone who has ever 
railed against "the patriarchy" will have to read this story with a smile. 
Matriarchies apparently were no picnic either, and young bachelors had to go 
through hell to get a roof over their heads. 
</P>
<P>
Francine Prose, in "Cimarron," writes of one of those pregnant women we 
sometimes see on the 6 p.m. news. Her husband has been killed in Beirut. Our 
military adventuring leaves one homeless wife and one set of children for every 
married man killed. 
</P>
<P>
There are so many great stories here. In "Victory," Mona Simpson draws a group 
of "successful" people who have left their poverty-stricken hometown. They have 
got their money now, but they have lost their homes. And Madison Smartt Bell 
(what a writer!) follows a released convict as he scours the New York City 
underworld for an addicted girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
My favorite story here is "workers to attention please," a 1,500-word 
masterpiece by Jay Neugeborgn, the kind of story other writers gnash their 
teeth with envy for . . . and I had good reason to gnash, because "Don't Ever 
Get Daunted," my own story, is overwritten, disorganized and has no structure. 
It's about my father, in the Depression, cocky and handsome, and so broke that 
he had to steal food. No matter how awkwardly written, "that one goes out to my 
dad," as Los Lobos say. And all these stories go out, not to make money, but to 
get the reader to ponder, to dream, to open their eyes about what's happening 
in this country.

'MIDSUMMER' AND 'LEAR' PRESENTED BY BRANAGH'S RENAISSANCE THEATRE CO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, TIMES THEATER WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The banner outside the Mark Taper Forum proclaims "King Lear A Midsummer 
Night's Dream," minus a connecting/separating preposition. "King Lear" is in 
block letters; "Midsummer" is in a more delicate cursive. Only the most 
uninitiated theatergoer could mistake this proclamation of the twin bill 
playing inside for the title of a single play. But the similarity of the 
sensibilities that have gone into shaping the much-awaited Renaissance Theatre 
Company's "King Lear" and "A Midsummer Night's Dream" might give one momentary 
pause. 
</P>
<P>
There are ideas here: clear, direct, youthful, vigorous and unshaded. In both 
productions. Probably because both were staged by the same Wunderkind director, 
Kenneth Branagh (whose recent film redux of Shakespeare's "Henry V" captured so 
many imaginations). The acting company reflects this brash young leader. It too 
is mostly young, inventive, talented and energetic. These qualities imbue the 
whole enterprise with an exuberance that best serves the farcical elements of 
"Midsummer" -- those bumbling "rude mechanicals" rehearsing their silly 
play-within-the-play, the knock-down-drag-outs in the forest among the tortured 
young lovers, Bottom's asinine dream, and a "bergomask" at the end that would 
make the most resistent among us crack a smile through the sheer power of 
send-up. 
</P>
<P>
But where does all this buoyancy leave "King Lear"? Out on a limb. This is a 
forceful "Lear," full of sound and fury, but with the heart carved out of it. 
The vision is brash, dark, sexually tainted and not terribly interesting. We 
get the trappings of drama here -- reddish ground, clanging portals, shafts of 
unilateral light slicing the darkness -- but not the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
The King, as played by Richard Briers (the Bottom of "Midsummer"), gives us an 
arrogant tyrant whose descent into insanity seems remarkably sane. Not even 
when Gloucester's eyes are put out do we feel pained and revulsed -- partly 
because Edward Jewesbury as Gloucester doesn't feel it enough. But only partly. 
The scene itself is tamely done. There's a neatness to the whole undertaking 
that lacks real blood and real sweat. The production comes in at a taut three 
hours, but cutting the Fool (played by Emma Thompson, Branagh's wife) out of 
the Dover scenes is the wrong kind of streamlining. 
</P>
<P>
A play is not a race to be won. And this is not to imply that "Lear" is being 
played that way. Or "Midsummer." Both have a good idea of what they want to be 
and both offer some, if not enough, rewards. Branagh places both shows on the 
same set designed by Jenny Tiramani -- a kind of astral nowhere, with stars and 
a moon cut out of the backdrop and a circular stage in front. The stage is 
covered in red pebbles, surrounded by an empty moat and ringed with an 
additional playing strip. 
</P>
<P>
The set remains bare, which is at once challenging for the actors and practical 
for a touring production. There is one intrusive effect -- "real" rain during 
one of the storm sequences in "Lear" -- that smacks of unnecessary bravura. If 
you're going to indulge in this sort of thing, you'd better be prepared to 
carry it through and for more than one scene. No one gets wet in this "rain." 
It is the most overt example of the emphasis on externals that plagues both 
productions. Otherwise, the effects gap is largely filled by the skill of the 
actors, by Jon Linstrum's lighting and Patrick Doyle's original music (more 
sound than music and often, particularly when it comes to the fairy songs in 
"Midsummer," jarringly dissonant). 
</P>
<P>
On the tally sheet, "Midsummer" fares best, of course, by dint of its monkey 
business and fantastical lunacies, and because the play submits more easily to 
the superimposition of a contemporary vision. The vision won't please everyone. 
Titania (Siobhan Redmond) and Oberon (Simon Roberts) are charmless, noxious 
spirits here, speaking in tortuous dialect-flavored English and done up in 
fairly lurid punk rockish costumes. (All costumes are designed by Tiramani in 
Early Nothing -- a hodgepodge of different periods, "The Rocky Horror Show" and 
the far reaches of her singular imagination.) 
</P>
<P>
Puck, played by Ethna Roddy (who delivers a tender and articulate Cordelia in 
the other play) is more Caliban than Puck and almost completely 
incomprehensible in what sounds like a thick Scottish brogue. This is not 
practical with American audiences who have trouble enough with the Queen's 
English. "Midsummer's" epilogue which follows an almost Noel Cowardish climax, 
becomes a curiously anticlimactic pagan rite. It is hard to escape the feeling 
of a playful, upbeat, enjoyable college production. 
</P>
<P>
Branagh, it becomes abundantly clear, is an actor first, a good one, and an 
actor's director. He loves their tricks and their imagination. His own Quince 
is seething understatement broadly stated. Briers' Bottom is casual 
unrestraint. The lovers (Thompson, Max Gold, James Larkin and Francine Morgan) 
are bursting with peevishness and passion. They're absurdly, comically intense. 
</P>
<P>
What's lacking all around is substance. Penetration. Subtlety. Branagh's world 
is a place without nuance, a long drink of cold water: limpid, refreshing, 
healthy but without aftertaste. The productions are cool geysers. They explode, 
they don't dig deep and don't touch us deeply. For "Lear," which is a muscular, 
clear reading of the play and fiercely acted on the surface, it means the 
absence of subtext or of the possibility of tragic dimension. It is a 
workmanlike, respectable, unboring, capable presentation, that never moves us. 
It cannot make up in energy what it lacks in maturity. It runs but it does not 
fly. 
</P>

A FINE 'FIGARO' AT MUSIC CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No shenanigans. No gimmicks. No cliches. No caricatures. No exaggerations. No 
innovative distortions. 
</P>
<P>
Whew. 
</P>
<P>
The Music Center Opera takes the human comedy of "Le Nozze di Figaro," which 
opened at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion on Friday, very seriously. 
</P>
<P>
This doesn't mean that the production, borrowed from the Chicago Lyric Opera, 
reveres tradition for its own tired sake. It merely means that the director, 
Peter Hall, and his associates have gone back to Mozart and Da Ponte -- 
possibly back further to Beaumarchais -- for their inspirations. 
</P>
<P>
This may not be a perfect marriage. The singing is a bit uneven. The musical 
perspective seems more romantic than baroque. One can quibble. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Hall and Stephen Lawless, his faithful directorial ally, really care 
about the characters, their needs and their frustrations. That makes all the 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
This "Figaro" savors telling motivation and expressive detail. The action 
springs forward with a disarming air of spontaneity in recitatives that really 
sound like casual conversation. The words count. 
</P>
<P>
Interrupted by a single intermission, rather than the usual three, the long and 
convoluted narrative flows naturally, almost quickly. Compositional sprawl is 
minimized and cumulative tensions are heightened. 
</P>
<P>
The intrusion of farce is permitted only where it is logical and irrepressible: 
in the mistaken-identity hysteria of the garden scene. And here it is 
strikingly effective because it sets off the cathartic pathos of understanding 
and forgiveness that follows ("Contessa, perdono . . . "). 
</P>
<P>
The musical standards of this "Figaro" turn out to be somewhat less lofty. 
Lawrence Foster, the conscientious if somewhat bland conductor, has opened all 
the conventional cuts. Even Marcellina and Basilio get to attempt their bravura 
arias in the last act. Foster has restored the high Cs of the second-act 
terzetto to the Countess. In general, one must admire his integrity, not to 
mention his concern for matters of poise, balance and propulsion. 
</P>
<P>
Like hungry little Oliver, however, a Mozartean ingrate wants more. He wants 
more moon-struck lyricism for Susanna's "Deh vieni, non tardar," more ironic 
fury for Figaro's "Aprite un po' quegli occhi." In the enlightened days of 
1990, he wants some linear embellishment, a few cadenzas, consistent 
appoggiaturas. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Los Angeles cast can boast several international stars, the 
participants obviously appreciate ensemble values. That is rare, and wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
Young Rodney Gilfry introduces a very wide-eyed, very intelligent and very 
mellifluous Figaro. With agile wit, he holds his own against the mature, 
magnificently befuddled Count of Thomas Allen, whose darker baritone encounters 
vocal problems only in the climactic fioriture of "Vedro mentr'io sospiro." It 
may be worth noting, incidentally, that Allen has frequently sung the role of 
Figaro, and Gilfry will soon depart for Germany where he is to sing the Count. 
</P>
<P>
Arleen Auger is a somewhat matronly, unaristocratic Countess, and on this 
occasion she sang her two great arias with unaccustomed, gingerly caution. But 
she certainly knows the style. Angela Maria Blasi -- tiny, adorable and totally 
innocent of arch soubrette manners -- sounded engagingly wistful if sometimes a 
shade too wispy as Susanna. 
</P>
<P>
Frederica von Stade remains the Cherubino of one's dreams. She somehow manages 
to be impetuous, cheeky, sensitive, shy, smug, erotically combustible and 
self-amused, all at the same delirious time. Also, she happens to sing as one 
hopes angels sing. 
</P>
<P>
The buffo roles were discreetly delineated by versatile members of the local 
team. Marvellee Cariaga stumbled a bit in the formidable flourishes of "Il 
capro e la capretta," yet she managed to make the usually crotchety Marcellina 
sympathetically as well as amusingly maternal. Michael Gallup dispatched the 
pomposities of Bartolo with crisp abandon. Jonathan Mack offered a beautifully 
vocalized Basilio (that may be an oxymoron), though the impact of the sly old 
intriguer was compromised by sketchy characterization. 
</P>
<P>
Dale Wendel, like all Barbarinas, looked cute and piped prettily. John Atkins 
revealed an unsuspected flair for character comedy as a blustery Antonio. 
Stephen Plummer stammered dutifully and unfunnily as Curzio. 
</P>
<P>
John Bury's raked, warm-hued sets and muted costumes (a bit dowdy in the case 
of the Countess) exerted their own atmospheric allure. The Chicago decors 
seemed small, however, for the Pavilion proscenium -- one doesn't automatically 
achieve intimacy merely by leaving the sides empty -- and the banks of stage 
lights visible in the wings remained an irksome, Brechtian anachronism. 
</P>
<P>
Francis Rizzo's thoughtfully phrased supertitles were, well, supertitles: 
distracting or helpful, depending on the viewer's priorities. They actually 
came close to destroying the poignant climax of the opera (the audience 
tittered at that sublime moment when the Count finally begs for forgiveness). 
</P>
<P>
At least the instant translations reinforced the syllabic rhythm of the Italian 
text. And, for once, an attempt was made to time the word-flashes in a way that 
would discourage premature laughter ("Ecco tuo padre...."). 
</P>
<P>
This was, in all, a happy marriage.

Ewok Origin Contested: An assistant to "Star Wars" creator George Lucas, Jane 
Bay, testified Friday in federal court in Calgary, Alberta, that the film maker 
never read the script from which he is accused of stealing his endearing Ewoks' 
characters and that unsolicited material is given unread to another assistant 
to be returned to the sender. A Canadian writer-producer is suing Lucas, his 
company, Lucas Films Ltd. and 20th Century Fox for $128 million alleging that 
Lucas stole the concept and name for the Ewok characters, the bear-like 
child-sized tree dwellers that starred in the film "Return of the Jedi." 
</P>
<P>
Calgary writer-producer Dean Preston is alleging copyright infringement and 
breach of implied contract, saying Lucas stole the concept from a script called 
"Space Pets" that Preston co-wrote and sent to Lucas in 1978. Lucas testified 
Thursday that his Ewoks and Preston's creatures are similar "only in a gross 
sense -- they have fur, and they walk on two feet." The case continues today.

Webber to Produce Show at Disney World: Composer Andrew Lloyd Webber will move 
on from cats to all other kinds of animals, as the executive producer of a new 
show at Disney World in Orlando, Fla., called "Noah's Ark." 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd Webber, the creator of "Cats" and "Phantom of the Opera," will compose an 
original symphonic score for the pageant, which will be staged on water. "This 
is the most ambitious night-time spectacle in Disney history," said Michael 
Eisner, chairman and chief executive officer of the Walt Disney Co. Set to open 
in 1992, "Noah's Ark" will be part of 29 new shows that Disney plans to add to 
its Florida park in the 1990s. Claudia Puig

TED LEITNER'S OPINIONS -- A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN BRASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is a voyeuristic element to watching Ted Leitner's commentaries, similar 
to eavesdropping on strangers arguing in a restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
There is the thrill of the unknown, the possibility that one of the combatants 
in the restaurant might crack and start shrieking hysterically. Maybe one of 
them will snap and start throwing things, and you'll have a front-row seat. 
</P>
<P>
People watch because they are titillated by the uncertainty of the scene. 
</P>
<P>
The same element made the prophetic 1976 film "Network" seem eerily plausible. 
Albert Finney portrayed a news anchor who snapped, and grew more popular as the 
"mad prophet of the airwaves," exhorting viewers to scream, "I'm as mad as hell 
and I'm not going to take it anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Watching Leitner's commentaries on KFMB-TV (Channel 8), it is easy to conclude 
that the premise of "Network" was not so far-fetched. 
</P>
<P>
People clearly enjoy watching Leitner's blood boil, as he blindly strays off 
his first topic, careening through whatever thoughts happen to come to mind. 
For more than 10 years, his free-form sports commentaries/reports have been a 
key to any ratings success enjoyed by Channel 8. 
</P>
<P>
But he's moving into new waters with his "Something to Say" commentaries, 
apparently free to rage about any type of topic. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there is precedent for this. KGTV (Channel 10) anchorman Michael 
Tuck had no real credibility when he began doing commentaries. But at least he 
could cloak himself in the veneer of being a newsman, even if most people first 
saw him as a talking-head anchor. 
</P>
<P>
Leitner must live with the stigma of being a sports guy. He argues that he has 
always been opinionated about a wide variety of subjects in his sports reports, 
so it is a small step to do general commentaries. In a sense, he's right. There 
is no doubt that he is an opinionated guy. 
</P>
<P>
But, so far, his commentaries come across like nothing more than the thoughts 
of a semi-avid newspaper reader -- albeit a very opinionated one. They are not 
editorials designed to persuade people, nor are they critical analyses geared 
toward enlightening viewers. They are simply Leitner's opinions, nothing more. 
Clearly, the only goal is to touch nerves, to prod some type of reaction from 
viewers. 
</P>
<P>
Last week he came out against racism and the death penalty. Tuesday night he 
called convicted murderer Robert Alton Harris a "slime," who could "go to hell" 
for all Leitner cared, but that society should not kill him. 
</P>
<P>
He sure is an opinionated guy. And there is certainly entertainment value in 
seeing him work up a sweat, leaning into the camera, calling somebody a "bozo." 
</P>
<P>
But there is a very real problem of overexposure, the danger of Channel 8 
giving viewers too much of an obnoxious thing. Tuck only goes into his avenging 
angel of the airwaves persona once a day. In addition to his news commentaries, 
Leitner rants about sports during the 5 and 11 p.m. newscasts. He rants on 
KFMB-AM (760). He rants during San Diego State basketball games. 
</P>
<P>
San Diegans can only take so much. Everybody knows Leitner has an opinion. But 
sooner or later, they are going to have to ask, who cares? 
</P>
<P>
According to a well informed source, United States International University has 
reached a tentative agreement to sell its stock in KUSI-TV (Channel 51) to 
minority owner Michael McKinnon. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Former KSDO talk-show host Stacy Taylor is making waves with his new station, 
WLS-AM in Chicago. In a recent article, the Chicago Tribune refers to Taylor as 
"razor-tongued." Although it chastises him for referring to the city's elevated 
train as a trolley, the article calls Taylor "the most even-tempered of the 
station's talent, but rapier-witted nonetheless." It went on to state, "A 
social conservative, he particularly enjoys taking stabs at his more liberal 
colleague . . . whom he once said 'rolls over like a spayed cocker spaniel' and 
pants with delight whenever someone criticizes the good ol' U.S. of A." . . . 
</P>
<P>
The general public probably isn't aware of the turmoil behind the scenes at 
KUSI-TV (Channel 51). They simply see that the station is now airing 
"Gilligan's Island" and "Batman" from 5 to 6 p.m. each weekday. Of course, the 
new, dynamic programming move is probably more reflective of the pitiful 
ratings of "Highway to Heaven" reruns, which previously filled the hour slot. 
And, heck, maybe it is a shrewd counterprogramming decision. Now viewers will 
have to sit back and think seriously: Should I watch Gilligan or Stan Miller? . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
No, that was not a three-part commercial for a Colorado ski resort airing 
during the Channel 10 news last week. It was just a very cheesy free-lance 
piece submitted by Shawn Styles. The airline that flew him to Colorado and the 
resort that put him up were given ample publicity in the feature, which 
basically portrayed the resort as the best place to ski in the Western 
Hemisphere. . . . 
</P>
<P>
If the headline in last week's San Diego Union was really true, the story 
probably deserved better play, perhaps in a special miracle section: "Comatose 
man sees son, revives." According to the article, a man in a coma "saw" his 
son, and then woke up. . . . 
</P>
<P>
KPBS-FM (89.5) will host an "Afropop Dance Party" Friday night at the 
Bacchanal, hosted by Georges Collinet, the host of public radio's "Afropop 
Worldwide" show. The party is a fund-raiser for the public radio station, which 
airs "Afropop" at 11 p.m. Saturdays. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps trying to prove that radio stations can manipulate ratings in any way 
they please, KFMB sent out a letter to advertisers touting the fall Arbitron 
ratings. KFMB-AM (760) went from an 8.3 to a 4.2 among listeners 12 and over 
(the summer book was buoyed by Padres broadcasts), and KFMB-FM (B100) slipped 
in almost every category. Unfazed, the letter states that the two stations 
combined reach "more than enough people to fill Jack Murphy Stadium 10 times." 
Six paragraphs into the letter, general manager Paul Palmer acknowledges that 
"this report is not one of our better ones" -- a stunning admission for a 
letter of this kind. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Former KNSD-TV (Channel 39) reporter Cathy Clark was due to start work today as 
a reporter with the San Diego Tribune. . . .

North County Community Newspapers, which includes the Coast Dispatch, Del Mar 
Surfcomber, Solana Beach Sun and Rancho Santa Fe Times, will soon add a Vista 
paper. The group was recently purchased from the Virginia-based Times Journal 
Co. by publisher Bill Lyke Jr.

Jones Gets Legion of Honor: Quincy Jones was awarded the French Legion of Honor 
Sunday for his musical contribution as a trumpeter, composer, arranger and 
record producer. In presenting the medal to Jones, Thierry de Beauce, secretary 
of state for international cultural relations, called Jones "a man who 
reconciles the rhythms of rock, jazz and bop." 
</P>
<P>
Jones, 56, is well-known on both sides of the Atlantic. He first went to France 
in 1953 at age 19 with Lionel Hampton's orchestra. His career since then 
includes collaboration with some of America and France's greatest artists -- 
Aretha Franklin, George Benson, Jacques Brel, Michel Legrand, Miles Davis, Ray 
Charles and Charles Aznavour. As a record producer, Jones was responsible for 
two of the most successful albums of the 1980s -- Michael Jackson's "Thriller" 
and "Bad." After six years of producing, Jones released his own album, "Back on 
the Block," which has risen to 16th place on U.S. charts since its December 
release. Claudia Puig

EXINDIGO DELIVERS RECENT WORKS AT BARNSDALL PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY McQUILKIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Perhaps it was fitting that Steve Reich was the one major composer represented 
on Saturday's program at Barnsdall Park. While the three relatively new works 
on the program delivered by the new-music ensemble eXindigo! are not strictly 
minimalist, each shows minimalist traits. 
</P>
<P>
In the middle movement of "Walking on an Apple" (for mallet percussion), for 
instance, composer/percussionist Ron George uses driving ostinatos as an 
attractive minimalist foundation over which he improvised -- to fine effect. He 
revealed his fascination with bell-like sounds in the outer movements, but a 
dearth of substantive material renders these movements feckless. To make 
matters worse, George's prerecorded sounds (also mallet percussion) were 
cranked up to oppressive levels. 
</P>
<P>
Soprano Sun Young Kim made a strong case for Ted Peterson's "Dr. John Wants to 
Talk to Dolphins," delivering the odd text with incisiveness and haunting 
resonance. Intermittent, quasi-minimalist percussion accompaniment provided an 
interesting but often incongruous backdrop, and the rambling, 30-minute work 
can be considered only a partial success. 
</P>
<P>
But Peterson's strident "Voluntaries," minimalist only in its repetitiveness, 
completely lacks any rhythmic drive, melodic inventiveness or harmonic appeal; 
it probably made the five brass players suffer as much as the listener. 
</P>
<P>
Reich's "Piano Phase," a work of remarkably simple design -- a seven-note 
pattern is performed by two musicians who, by speeding up slightly, bring their 
respective parts in and out of phase -- manages to engage the listener for 20 
minutes. Originally for pianos, it was effectively performed by marimbists Ron 
George and Deborah Schwartz.TERRY McQUILKIN

HESTONS SAIL FOR 'TREASURE ISLAND' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The latest (and, at 131 minutes, not counting commercials, longest) filmed 
version of Robert Louis Stevenson's "Treasure Island" -- premiering at 5 p.m. 
today and repeating at 8 p.m. on the TNT cable network -- would seem to have 
vanity production stamped all over it. Starring as the one-legged pirate Long 
John Silver, one of the hammiest roles known to man or beast, is Charlton 
Heston, and making a directorial debut with this presumably big-budget 
action-adventure is one Fraser C. Heston, who also wrote and produced. Yo ho ho 
and a bottle of nepotism! 
</P>
<P>
The surprise, then, is that the younger Heston has turned in a directorial bow 
that is both respectable and fun, if occasionally lacking the tension necessary 
to sustain the running time. And the elder Heston, following in the filmic 
footsteps of Wallace Beery, Robert Newton and Orson Welles, dons sun-scorched 
makeup, curls his lips in and chews the island scenery for all it's worth; this 
time, at least, he's doing the right thing. 
</P>
<P>
If at times the production actually seems to be taking itself just a bit too 
seriously -- unlike the famous Disney version -- with its pretty pictorialism 
and graphic violence, it's largely up to Heston's Silver to risk flirting with 
high camp and send it over the top every now and then. Way over the top in the 
first half-hour are wheezing Oliver Reed and murderous Christopher Lee, both 
killed off before the ship ever sets sail; these two overact so gustily that 
when Heston turns up, his performance seems almost naturalistic. 
</P>
<P>
The action is once more seen through the eyes of brave young Jim Hawkins, who 
almost single-handedly averts a pirate mutiny that threatens an 18th-Century 
expedition to an unmanned island laden with stolen loot. Christian Bale (grown 
up a bit from "Empire of the Sun") is a good, believably enterprising choice 
for Jim; Julian Glover also shows up in a rare good-guy role as Dr. Livesy. 
</P>
<P>
Even as an admittedly long sit, both children and adults with a taste for 
period-piece escapism should be sufficiently amused not to commandeer the set's 
remote control. 
</P>
<P>
The TV movie will be shown again Saturday, Feb. 1 and Feb. 24.

ALEXANDRIA COMES OUT OF SHADOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lorez Alexandria has never quite received the recognition that her work has 
deserved. Much respected by musicians, as well as other singers, she has spent 
a good part of her several decades-old career in the shadow of performers like 
Sarah Vaughn and Ella Fitzgerald. 
</P>
<P>
Alexandria's opening night set at Marla's Memory Lane Friday night 
demonstrated, however, that she is an artist with much to offer. To her credit, 
and rare for most jazz singers, she sang a program that added brand new songs 
to the usual collection of familiar standards, sultry ballads and hard swinging 
up tempos. 
</P>
<P>
The always-dependable trio of Art Hillary on piano, Clarence Johnston on drums 
and Allen Jackson on bass opened the evening with a group of jazz-worthy tunes 
-- "The Night Has a Thousand Eyes," "It Could Happen to You" and "Softly, As in 
a Morning Sunrise" -- that were energized by Jackson's smooth, harmonically 
evocative bass lines. 
</P>
<P>
Alexandria kicked off her part of the show with a hard rocking groove on "I 
Wish I Knew" and a somewhat less-dynamic "Bittersweet." She hit her stride with 
Johnny Mercer's "I Remember You" and Duke Ellington's "I Got It Bad." 
</P>
<P>
But her finest moments came on new songs like "Sweet Pumpkin" and "Where Have 
You Been." Obviously delighted to have material that she can mark with her own 
stamp, Alexandria produced interpretations that reached into the heart of the 
music -- especially during a moodily introspective rendition of Arthur 
Hamilton's lovely "Are You With Me?" DON HECKMAN

BUSH AIDES SUPPORT EPA CABINET STATUS

<TEXT>
<P>
The White House senior staff has shifted its position and is now advising at 
least tacit support of bipartisan legislation to elevate the Environmental 
Protection Agency to Cabinet status, an Administration source said. President 
Bush has been reluctant to endorse such a move in the past on grounds that 
making the Cabinet larger makes it harder to manage the government. 
</P>
<P>
However, supporting the idea could bring considerable political benefit to Bush 
among environmentalists, who have long pushed the idea. Legislation to make the 
EPA the 15th Cabinet department is to be reintroduced in both houses of 
Congress within the next few days. Bills also were introduced last year, but 
did not make it to the floor of either the House or Senate.

'ICE' LAB RAIDED, DRUG SEIZED, 5 HELD

Detectives seized what they say is the first laboratory for making "ice," or 
smokable methamphetamine, in the continental United States and arrested five 
people, sheriff's deputies said. County and state narcotics agents found the 
laboratory in nearby Elk Grove containing four pounds of "ice" in various 
production stages and four gallons of liquid that would convert to 32 pounds of 
"ice", said Sheriff's Department spokesman Ed Close. 
</P>
<P>
The current price of "ice" in Los Angeles is $10,000 to $15,000 a pound, he 
said. In Hawaii, where use of the drug is widespread, the price is $50,000 a 
pound, he said. U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration chemists said it was the 
first "ice" lab seized in the continental United States and that the quality of 
the drug was very high. Arrested on charges of conspiracy to transport, 
possession for sale of and manufacture for sale of methamphetamine were John 
Skific, 28, William Vick, 38, Barbara Vick, 30, Bridgette Wisdom, 23, and 
Kimberly Vick, 18, all of Sacramento.

involving Proposition 103, the landmark insurance initiative, be consolidated 
in one court. Currently, different actions are proceeding in courts in several 
cities. Judge Richard Park said it is up to the state Judicial Council to 
decide which court will now be assigned the dozen pending cases.

GRIEVING ARMENIANS VOW TO AID HOMELAND; 
</P>

Raising clenched right fists to signal solidarity, their eyes fixed on the red, 
blue and orange Armenian flag by the podium, the 2,500 Armenians who rallied in 
Hollywood on Sunday solemnly vowed to defend their homeland with their lives. 
</P>
<P>
The people had come from as far as Chicago and Texas. Many wore lapel ribbons 
in memory of relatives killed in the conflict under way in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
They filled money baskets in minutes. 
</P>
<P>
They picked up thousands of unsigned letters handed out by volunteers and 
promised to mail them to their congressmen. And they signed petitions without 
bothering to read them. 
</P>
<P>
"We are a peace-loving people, and we want peace right now," Archbishop Datev 
Sarkissian, Western prelate of the Armenian Apostolic Church, told the outdoor 
rally at Alex Pibilos Armenian School. 
</P>
<P>
"But peace cannot come at the expense of our people and our national rights," 
he warned, as the audience exploded in applause. "Justice for our people!" 
Sarkissian cried. "Justice for Armenia! Do not underestimate our people's fight 
for honor, freedom and self-determination!" 
</P>
<P>
The rally -- organized by the Armenian National Committee, a local political 
group -- kicked off a fund-raising campaign to help Soviet Armenia in its war 
with the neighboring republic of Azerbaijan. 
</P>
<P>
The funds will be used to provide medical supplies, clothing and shelter for 
the tens of thousands of Armenian refugees who arrived in the Armenian capital, 
Yerevan, last week, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
It was the largest so far in a string of demonstrations by the 350,000 
Armenians believed to be living in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
For days, they had heard and read news reports of one tragedy after another: 
Armenians thrown from balconies and massacred in Azerbaijan; Armenians 
evacuated from their villages by the Red Army; Armenian militia members 
fighting and dying along the Azerbaijan border. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, as they stood before their flag, in one voice they promised to 
defend Armenia to the end. 
</P>
<P>
"We are angry because our people are being killed again for the sole reason of 
being Armenians," said ANC spokesman Berdj Karapetian. "We are angry at our 
president, George Bush, for not denouncing the massacres. We are angry at 
(Soviet President Mikhail S.) Gorbachev for downplaying the whole thing for 
geopolitical reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"It's 1915 being repeated all over again," he said, referring to the genocide 
in Turkey that killed two-thirds of the Armenians, "and nobody's stopping it." 
</P>
<P>
The fervor of support Sunday was typical of recent gatherings in the local 
Armenian community. 
</P>
<P>
In Glendale's Maple Park -- where as many as 50 Armenian refugees meet daily at 
the picnic tables to play checkers, the Armenian card game Shagma, and the 
Russian board game Shashki -- the members of the mostly male group have been 
overtaken by a feeling of despair. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, for example, only a handful were in the mood to play games. The 
others spent hours talking about their homeland, asking endless unanswered 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
"Why are they killing Armenians?" "Why are they driving us out of our 
villages?" "Why can't the massacres be stopped?" "Why us, again?" 
</P>
<P>
At local Armenian schools, officials were busy organizing fund-raisers and 
promoting letter-writing campaigns asking U.S. officials for help. 
</P>
<P>
"The students are very hotblooded," said Viken Balian, 50, the principal of 
Mesrobian Armenian School in Pico Rivera. "They say, 'Why don't we go to 
Armenia and fight to defend our brothers and sisters?' 
</P>
<P>
"We tell them that we understand their frustration, but things have to be done 
in a proper order and, for the time being, that option is premature." 
</P>
<P>
In an Armenian history class at Glendale Community College on Friday morning, 
an emotional discussion followed the showing of a videotape of the latest news 
clips of the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe we have to sit here and watch our people getting crushed by 
those filthy barbarians," snapped Derek Azoo, 18, one of 37 Armenian students 
in the 40-member class. 
</P>
<P>
"We have tried to be diplomatic, but it doesn't work," added student Stepan 
Boyajian, 18, with icy determination. "Fighting is the only solution at this 
point." 
</P>
<P>
Their instructor asked his students how many of them would fight for their 
homeland. Almost every hand went up. 
</P>
<P>
That was the response he expected, said Prof. Levon Marashlian. The night 
before, Marashlian had been among 1,500 people who met in the basement of St. 
Mary's Armenian Church in Glendale to hear community leaders address the 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
A tense silence permeated the packed auditorium as John Kossakian, managing 
editor of the local Armenian newspaper Asbarez, reported on the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
Many stared at the floor, slowly shaking their heads. Others covered their eyes 
with their hands to hide the pain. Outside, a group of smokers paced nervously. 
</P>
<P>
Kossakian spoke of the need to send aid to Armenia, to organize mass 
demonstrations and to ask U.S. leaders to put pressure on their Soviet 
counterparts to end the violence. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to get huge crowds, or it's not worth it," he said in Armenian. 
</P>
<P>
There was thundering applause. 
</P>
<P>
"Why don't we send arms to Armenia?" a man shouted from the back of the room. 
</P>
<P>
"Why don't we all go back to Armenia to help our brothers and sisters?" another 
cried. 
</P>
<P>
Arms smuggling is illegal and the borders are closed, Kossakian replied. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to do more!" the men and women shouted back. "We have to do more!"

MCMARTIN CASE FALLOUT TAKES ITS TOLL ON MINISTER; 
</P>
<P>
RELIGION: HE SAYS YEARS OF 'EXTREME STRESS' FIGHTING RUMORS THAT SATANIC 
RITUALS WERE PERFORMED AT HIS CHURCH HAVE FORCED HIM TO SEEK DISABILITY 
RETIREMENT. 
</P>

<P>
A Hermosa Beach minister who for years has tried in vain to quell rumors tying 
his church to the McMartin Pre-School scandal announced Sunday that the 
"extreme stress" of fallout from the case has forced him to seek disability 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. John D. Eales of St. Cross Episcopal Church -- where McMartin pupils 
claimed they had been forced to take part in satanic rituals -- told the 
congregation during his sermon that, "after much prayer and consultation," he 
realized his health could not withstand the continuing harassment and 
vandalization the church has borne as a result of the unsubstantiated claims. 
</P>
<P>
The McMartin case, which prompted the longest and most expensive criminal trial 
in U.S. history, ended Thursday with the acquittal of defendants Ray Buckey and 
Peggy McMartin Buckey on a total of 52 counts of child molestation at the 
Manhattan Beach school. The jurors deadlocked on 13 other counts. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the case continues to divide and haunt the South Bay communities 
where it was centered. 
</P>
<P>
St. Cross was never named as a defendant in the case and neither Eales nor any 
other official of the venerable seaside church was ever formally charged. 
</P>
<P>
But since 1985, the church has struggled to shake a McMartin pupil's allegation 
during the preliminary hearing that, six years earlier, he and other students 
had been forced to witness animal sacrifices and satanic rituals at the altar 
of St. Cross. 
</P>
<P>
When the then-10-year-old boy's allegation was reported in the local media, 
other children claimed that they too had been abused at the church. Though 
investigators using sophisticated equipment checked the altar and found no 
trace of blood, attendance dropped drastically at the church and the church-run 
preschool, which closed soon afterward. 
</P>
<P>
The allegations never died, despite the passage of time and the announcement by 
Los Angeles County sheriff's investigators that they had found no evidence to 
support the children's claims. 
</P>
<P>
Periodically over the years, Eales said, he would receive threatening phone 
calls at the church and rectory, and the harassment increased as the McMartin 
case began to wind down. 
</P>
<P>
Twice in December, the church and rectory were pelted with bottles and rotten 
eggs. In a note left in the rectory driveway after the second attack, the 
vandals, who identified themselves as "the Beach Cities' Conscience," warned 
that "there is simply no place for Satan worship in this town." 
</P>
<P>
The harassment was exacerbated by the arrest shortly after Christmas of a youth 
counselor at the church, who was charged with molesting two teen-age boys he 
had met through his work at St. Cross. 
</P>
<P>
The counselor, it turned out, was a convicted child molester who had been 
brought into the fold about a year and a half earlier by an assistant pastor 
who was hired after the McMartin case broke. Then, just days after that 
assistant pastor resigned, the McMartin verdict came down, and, according to 
several church members, the anonymous phone calls returned. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of like a violin string -- you can only tighten it so far and then 
it snaps," Eales said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Though at 61 Eales has 11 more years until the diocese would mandate his 
retirement, he said his doctors told him that "the kind of stress you have been 
under kills." 
</P>
<P>
Because of that, he said, he plans to extend a medical leave already scheduled 
to allow for some minor surgery next week and retire a year short of the 
10-year tenure that was his goal when he came to St. Cross. 
</P>
<P>
His decision shocked and saddened parishioners, who credited Eales with 
shepherding the church through difficult times. 
</P>
<P>
Said Ron Russell, a 16-year member of the congregation: 
</P>
<P>
"We brought a good, strong man in here, and -- well, this has ruined him."

BACTERIA PRODUCE AN UNUSUAL MAGNET FOR NAVIGATIONAL USE; 
</P>
<P>
ORIGIN OF LIFE: THE DISCOVERY SHOULD SHED NEW LIGHT ON HOW ANIMALS CAME TO 
PRODUCE SHELLS, TEETH AND BONES. AND THE PROCESS MAY BE MUCH OLDER THAN 
PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT.

<P>
Bacteria that orient themselves in the Earth's magnetic field by using tiny 
iron sulfide magnets have been discovered in Morro Bay by researchers at Cal 
Poly San Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
Many species of bacteria and animals -- and perhaps even humans -- are known to 
use embedded particles of magnetite, a form of iron oxide, for navigation. But 
the new bacteria, whose discovery is reported today in the British journal 
Nature, are the first using sulfur-based magnets. 
</P>
<P>
Understanding how the newly identified bacteria produce the unusual magnets 
should shed new light on the mechanism of biomineralization, by which animals 
produce shells, teeth and bones. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the presence of iron sulfide magnets suggests that the process of 
biomineralization began much earlier in the Earth's history than had previously 
been believed, when hydrogen sulfide rather than oxygen was the most important 
component of the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery "gives us a new line to follow back to the origin of life," said 
chemist R. J. P. Williams of the University of Oxford in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
It also "means that biomineralization is a much more sophisticated process than 
we had previously thought, and possibly much older as well," said physicist 
Richard B. Frankel of Cal Poly, one of the report's authors. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate paper, researchers from the Brazilian Center for Physics Research 
in Rio de Janeiro report that they have found other bacteria containing 
different magnetic iron sulfides. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, biologists believed that biomineralization began about 600 
million years ago, when the first shells appeared in fossils. 
Magnetite-containing bacteria have subsequently been dated back 2 billion 
years. The new discovery could extend the origin of biomineralization even 
further back into the Earth's 4.5-billion-year history. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very exciting discovery," added geobiologist Joseph Kirschvink of 
Caltech. 
</P>
<P>
The first magnet-containing or magnetotactic bacteria were discovered in a 
brackish Massachusetts marsh in 1975 by Richard P. Blakemore, now at the 
University of New Hampshire. Placed in a magnetic field, the bacteria swam 
toward the north. 
</P>
<P>
The bacteria live primarily in sediments on the bottom of marshes, where they 
feed on the rich detritus of other organisms. At the latitudes where the 
bacteria were discovered, the Earth's magnetic lines of force running northward 
dip into the Earth at a shallow angle, leading the bacteria downward toward the 
rich food sources on the bottom. Magnetotactic bacteria in the Southern 
Hemisphere swim toward the south, which again points them toward the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers have subsequently discovered magnetotactic organs in the bellies of 
honeybees and in the brains of birds, tuna, whales and dolphins. Some evidence 
suggests that similar organs might even be present in humans. The magnetotactic 
organs, in combination with visual cues from the sun, help the animals navigate 
during migration. 
</P>
<P>
In all previous cases, however, the magnetic organs have been based on 
magnetite. The new discoveries represent the first time sulfur-containing 
magnets have been observed. Frankel and his colleagues isolated the bacteria 
from environments that have high sulfide concentrations, such as the ponds, 
lagoons and marshes that line the Central Coast of California. 
</P>
<P>
Geophysicist Darci Motta S. Esquivel and his colleagues in Brazil isolated 
their bacteria from similar locations in South America. 
</P>
<P>
Kirschvink speculates that the iron sulfide deposits originally arose in 
bacteria as a method for storing iron, "which is crucial for any living 
organism's metabolism." Over time, the bacteria could then have evolved ways to 
use the material's magnetic properties as well. Eventually, the same 
biochemical mechanisms evolved to produce shells and, later, teeth and bones. 
</P>
<P>
The sulfide materials have not yet been found in fossils, he added, because 
they are "notoriously unstable chemically," breaking down into simpler 
compounds such as iron pyrite, or fool's gold. Interestingly, both Frankel's 
group and the Brazilians found iron pyrite particles in the new bacteria. Their 
function is not yet known. 
</P>
<P>
Oxford's Williams believes that the iron sulfide compounds may also have played 
a role in the bacteria's capture of life-giving energy from the environment, 
and he speculates that similar organisms may exist in the hydrogen sulfide-rich 
thermal vents that have been discovered on the oceans' bottoms. 
</P>
<P>
Concludes Williams: "There could well be a huge variety of life in the 
sulfide-rich zones on Earth, perhaps holding fresh clues to help answer the 
question of how life began."

CHEST PAINS TERMED TREATABLE

<P>
Tens of thousands of American women diagnosed each year with chest pain and no 
signs of heart disease may be suffering from a treatable disorder of the small 
arteries, a researcher said last week. 
</P>
<P>
Many of these women, who often experience intense pain, are being treated for 
psychiatric disorders because no physical symptoms can be found with 
conventional tests, said Dr. Richard Cannon of the National Heart, Lung and 
Blood Institute in Bethesda, Md. 
</P>
<P>
His studies have shown that many of the patients are suffering from a disorder 
he calls microvascular angina, in which blood flow may be blocked in very tiny 
arteries that nourish the heart. A variety of treatments exist to relieve the 
pain, Cannon said, including many of the standard heart drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Although microvascular angina is not a psychiatric condition, some psychiatric 
drugs also appear to relieve the chest pain, perhaps because they alleviate a 
disorder in the nervous system's regulation of certain muscles. 
</P>
<P>
His current hypothesis is that the condition may be the result of improper 
signals being sent from the body to the brain, or a problem in the brain's 
analysis of those signals.

COCAINE LINKED TO BIRTH DEFECTS

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cocaine use during pregnancy appears to be causing an epidemic of irreversible 
birth defects, including heart defects and possible retardation. Babies born to 
women who used cocaine during pregnancy tend to be smaller at birth and have 
smaller head circumference, and may go through withdrawal like babies born to 
women using heroin and methadone, said Bertis Little of University of Texas 
Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
Little and his colleagues recently reported that "cocaine infants" had 
significantly more congenital heart defects, primarily holes in the heart 
muscle. Such babies are also thought to face a greater risk of brain 
hemorrhages and high blood pressure. 
</P>
<P>
The study of 53 women who used cocaine continuously during pregnancy found that 
their babies were 10 times more likely to have heart defects than those born to 
women who did not use it. 
</P>
<P>
"My major concern right now is that these kids might have some major structural 
abnormalities" not detected at birth, Little said at an American Heart Assn. 
seminar. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the first things we want to do right now is a physical growth study to 
see if small birth weight translates into small children," Little said. "We 
want to see if reduced head circumference (at birth) translates into reduced 
head circumference later on. If if does, that means they're going to be 
developmentally delayed." 
</P>
<P>
Some experts have estimated that 10% of pregnant women in the United States use 
cocaine, Little said.

CATS' EARWAX CRAVING QUERIED

<TEXT>
<P>
A scientist wants to know why his cats seem to want the whole ball of wax. 
Earwax, that is. In a letter published in the British scientific journal 
Nature, Thomas Arny, a physicist at the University of Massachusetts, seeks the 
help of the research community in determining why his two Siamese cats "greatly 
enjoyed the taste of human earwax." 
</P>
<P>
The cats' craving for earwax is so great, Arny said, that one "leaps on the bed 
in the morning hoping to be offered some." 
</P>
<P>
When the Massachusetts scientist mentioned his pets' odd behavior to three 
other people, he said they told him their cats also had a fondness for wax. 
"I'd always thought that earwax tasted very bitter (as a deterrent to insects 
getting into your ears), so I find the cats' reaction hard to understand," Arny 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
"Does any of your readers have any explanation? I wonder if it might be a means 
to induce cats to groom their kittens," he asked.

<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. investigators have uncovered evidence to suggest that the fortune amassed 
by Manuel A. Noriega during his eight years in power may total as much as $300 
million, according to Panamanian officials and U.S. sources here. 
</P>
<P>
Among hundreds of bank accounts and pieces of property worldwide now believed 
linked to the ousted dictator is a $27-million castle in the South of France 
held in the name of Vicky Amado, Noriega's 35-year-old mistress, the sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The indication of the vastness of the Noriega holdings has sent a quiet 
reverberation of hope through the financially strapped government of President 
Guillermo Endara. The regime's grim economic outlook is compounded by new 
concerns that as little as half of the $400 million in government funds frozen 
by the United States during the Noriega years may ultimately be returned to 
Panama. 
</P>
<P>
Moving to seize the new opportunity, the government plans as early as today to 
stake a formal claim to the Noriega wealth and to announce plans to mount a 
legal effort to win possession of the holdings, Controller-General Ruben Carles 
said in a weekend interview. 
</P>
<P>
Carles and other officials cautioned that the estimate of the holdings is a 
preliminary one and said it is by no means certain that the entire sum, made up 
in large part of property and accounts bearing the names of others, can 
conclusively be tied to Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
But all of the sources, who were briefed by U.S. officials involved in the 
effort to track down the Noriega funds, said that investigators have found 
solid evidence of a Noriega connection to a vast range of holdings throughout 
Europe, Latin America and the United States and have indicated that the total 
value of the assets appears to be in the neighborhood of $300 million. 
</P>
<P>
The sources also said the United States now believes that Noriega acquired a 
significant portion of the total in the last two years through a scheme in 
which Panamanian visas were sold at monumental prices to Cuban and Chinese 
citizens desperate to leave their countries. 
</P>
<P>
As many as 18,000 immigrants, some of whom paid $10,000 or more for the 
necessary documents, are believed to have entered Panama under the scheme, 
which was coordinated by Noriega. One knowledgeable source estimated that the 
Panamanian leader's personal take exceeded $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
Other suspected sources for the dramatic stock of wealth included Noriega's 
stewardship of the Panamanian customs and tax systems, both of which demanded 
exorbitant bribes as a cost of doing business, and his relationship with the 
Colombian drug cartels, which allegedly made direct payments to him in return 
for his assistance in permitting drug traffickers to use Panama as a base. 
</P>
<P>
A surprising proportion of the recently acquired Noriega holdings is said to be 
in the form of real property, including the castle in France, a sprawling 
estate in Sweden and expensive homes elsewhere in Europe. Under the laws of 
most countries, such property is far more difficult to confiscate than are bank 
accounts, even if it can be shown to have been acquired through illicit means. 
</P>
<P>
Members of a Drug Enforcement Administration team who have gathered more than 
20 tons of documents here as part of the Noriega investigation were not 
available for comment. A U.S. Embassy spokesman said officials will be 
prohibited from discussing any aspect of the probe. The DEA has declared that 
premature disclosures about Noriega's financial assets could enable his allies 
to find more secure hiding places for his wealth. 
</P>
<P>
The prospect of recovering even a small portion of the presumably large Noriega 
stockpile of wealth has given at least a temporary boost to officials of the 
new government, who are still seeking to come to terms with the immensity of 
the belt-tightening that will be required if Panama is to become fiscally 
sound. 
</P>
<P>
Although President Endara, in his first nationally televised address last 
Thursday, outlined plans for a new economic reconstruction program, including 
new spending to combat rampant unemployment, he sought also to quell 
expectations that recovery would be anything but slow. 
</P>
<P>
And, in a government white paper due to be published today, Controller-General 
Carles will warn that the government -- which owes more than $5 billion to 
foreign creditors -- must reduce its overall expenditures by about 17% to 
restore the confidence of lenders. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Carles also confirmed that creditors' claims would make it 
necessary for Panama to turn over a significant portion of the $400 million in 
government funds that have been held in U.S. banks since being frozen two years 
ago to keep them out of the hands of the Noriega regime. 
</P>
<P>
The $400-million balance, envisioned by most Panamanians and economists as a 
source of funds that might furnish a jump-start to the cash-poor economy, would 
be reduced by one-half if the legal claims are honored, according to banking 
sources. Carles said the government hopes to reduce that obligation through 
negotiations, but he acknowledged that "we have to show creditors that we will 
honor our debts. . . . We cannot get all that money back." 
</P>
<P>
The controller hinted, however, that the government might use some financial 
sleight of hand to avoid the political humiliation of accepting less than the 
full $400 million, which assumed an enormous symbolic stature during the period 
of economic deprivation that was intensified by the U.S. sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
"How could we justify to the Panamanian people that their money was going to 
pay some international banker?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
A reconstruction plan outlined last week by Endara and his two vice presidents, 
Ricardo Arias Calderon and Guillermo (Billy) Ford, would reduce military 
spending from $115 million to $87 million. It seeks to increase revenues 
largely through privatization of agencies in which a tangled bureaucracy was 
thought to have slowed commerce, including the nation's ports. 
</P>
<P>
And, despite plans of a $200-million, two-year public works program designed to 
ease unemployment, government officials and their supporters have done their 
best to persuade Panamanians not to expect too much from their new government. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't come to the government for jobs, because there are no jobs," Father 
Javier Villanueva told the congregation Sunday at a Roman Catholic Church 
service attended by Endara and visiting U.S. Sen. Alfonse D'Amato (R-N.Y.) 
</P>
<P>
"Don't come to get a piece of the pie," he added, "because Noriega ate the 
whole pie."

the fortune amassed by Panama's Manuel Noriega during his years in power may 
total $300 million. The holdings, according to Panamanian and U.S. sources, may 
include a $27-million French castle held in the name of the ousted dictator's 
mistress. The report was welcome news to the financially strapped Panama 
government. Meanwhile, members of a U.S. medic battalion boarded a transport

TEPLICE, Czechoslovakia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This day, like most days, thin, pale children crowd the corridor that serves as 
a waiting room at Dr. Ladislav Peychl's clinic. Some lie quietly in their 
parents' arms. Some wander about fretfully. All cough. 
</P>
<P>
Outside, a light rain falls, dampening the ever-present soot into a blackish 
mud. The rain is laden with acid, etching ever-deeper lines into buildings and 
adding a few more dead trees to the ranks of denuded trunks that line Teplice's 
streets each spring. 
</P>
<P>
The poisoned rain and the coughing children are measures of what Teplice has 
become. 
</P>
<P>
This small city in northwestern Czechoslovakia, hard by the East German border, 
was once internationally renowned as a health spa. Today, sitting in a narrow 
valley surrounded by coal-fired power plants that produce roughly half the 
nation's electricity, Teplice has become a symbol of environmental devastation 
-- and of the health problems such devastation brings. 
</P>
<P>
And scenes such as those found here are scattered throughout Eastern Europe. 
For four decades, Communist governments warped their nations' political 
systems, suppressed historic cultures and terrorized opponents. But even the 
scars of those abuses may be healed before the region's new governments can 
reverse the environmental legacy of foul air, contaminated land, poisoned water 
and sickened people. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a catastrophe in the making," says Barbara Jancar, a professor of 
political science at the State University of New York at Brockport and an 
expert on East European environmental problems. 
</P>
<P>
In some areas, the catastrophe is already at hand. 
</P>
<P>
Peychl, chief pediatrician for the regional hospital here, and his colleagues 
receive a constant flow of children suffering from asthma, bronchitis and other 
respiratory ailments. The infant mortality rate here is about 30% higher than 
in the rest of the country, the overall life expectancy two years lower, the 
adult cancer rate 20% worse. 
</P>
<P>
So unhealthy has the environment of Teplice become that doctors themselves are 
reluctant to move here. Peychl has five vacancies on his staff that he has been 
unable to fill. The situation is little better in many other parts of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
"We have the worst environment in the whole of Europe," Czechoslovakia's new 
president, Vaclav Havel, told his countrymen in his New Year's address. 
</P>
<P>
And, while international environmental experts agree with his assessment, 
Czechoslovakia's neighbors know they are only slightly better off. 
</P>
<P>
The problems share a common cause -- the Stalinist model of economic 
development that demanded rapid growth of heavy industry and made no provision 
for environmental concerns. The results of this strategy can be found across 
the region. 
</P>
<P>
"They're using 19th-Century technology and 19th-Century environmental 
techniques," says Jancar. 
</P>
<P>
The most seriously damaged part of the region is a belt of heavy industry, coal 
mines and environmental devastation that stretches across three nations, from 
the East German province of Saxony into Czechoslovakia's northern Bohemia -- 
where Teplice sits -- and on into Polish Silesia. 
</P>
<P>
In the Silesian city of Krakow, about 300 miles east of Teplice, an endless row 
of smokestacks on the roofs of the aged Lenin Steel Mill complex daily belch 
10,000 tons of noxious gases and other effluents into the polluted skies, 
helping to create what Stanislaw Garlicki, director of the regional 
environmental health agency, calls an "environmental disaster." 
</P>
<P>
Krakow's sister city, Katowice, contains what may be the most massive 
concentration of heavy industry in Europe -- an estimated 50 square miles of 
tightly jammed steel mills, power plants, metal-manufacturing factories and 
coal mines. Environmental precautions are virtually nonexistent. Almost all the 
mills use technology that dates back to the late 1940s, when the Communist 
government took over in Poland. 
</P>
<P>
The Vistula River, which flows from the Upper Silesian Hills just south of 
Krakow on through Warsaw to the Baltic Sea, is virtually an open sewer, so 
heavily polluted with salt from coal-processing and other slag that it is unfit 
even for industrial use. It is even polluting the Baltic Sea, to the horror of 
Sweden and other Scandinavian countries. 
</P>
<P>
International officials say an estimated 70% of Poland's water is not 
drinkable. 
</P>
<P>
Far to the south, in the Bulgarian city of Ruse, residents say about 80% of all 
young men drafted into the army show some signs of lung damage. Bulgarian 
officials blame a massive chemical complex built across the Danube River in 
Romania just upwind of their city. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High Cancer Rates 
</P>
<P>
And in every major Eastern European city, fumes from burning soft coal, the 
dominant source of heat, suffuse the winter air with a heavy scent and a 
noxious haze that vanished from most Western cities decades ago. Blankets of 
soot cover streets from East Berlin to Sofia. The heavy use of coal, coupled 
with heavy smoking habits throughout the region, have helped to give Eastern 
Europe abnormally high rates of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Poland's Institute of Oncology in Gliwice has identified about 18 
cancer-causing agents in Polish coal that it says makes coal-burning a danger 
to health even during non-winter months. 
</P>
<P>
Rural regions also have been badly damaged. In Czechoslovakia, environmental 
activists say the concentrations of pesticide and fertilizer residues 
frequently exceed legal limits. And residents of Prague offer repeated 
anecdotes of people hospitalized for acute reactions to high levels of nitrates 
in fruits and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
In many areas of Eastern Europe, environmental activists say, overuse of 
chemicals has permanently contaminated the soil. The Polish government has 
considered a ban on growing vegetables in parts of Silesia after soil 
measurements for lead, cadmium and other poisonous metals revealed some of the 
highest levels ever detected anywhere in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the region, environmental concerns played a role in the political 
upheaval that appears to have brought the Communist era to a close. In 
Bulgaria, for example, an environmental group, Ekoglasnost, organized the first 
demonstrations against the regime of now-ousted Communist Party chief Todor 
Zhivkov. 
</P>
<P>
In Czechoslovakia, opposition leaders say popular revulsion against pollution 
hastened the downfall of that country's hard-line Stalinist rulers, fatally 
undermining the government's claim that it had provided a decent living 
standard for the people even if it had curtailed political liberty. 
</P>
<P>
One of the new government's first acts was to establish an environmental agency 
for the first time, and the environmentalist Greens Party is given a good 
chance of attracting considerable support in elections scheduled for June. 
</P>
<P>
In Poland, about 200 environmental groups have sprung up around the country, 
although all are locally oriented, without a single nationwide umbrella 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the public concerns, however, the problems the region faces far 
outweigh the resources available. In Poland, where the new government has been 
in place the longest and has begun estimating the cost of change, environmental 
cleanup alone could cost well into the billions of dollars -- far more than the 
nation's treasury can spare. 
</P>
<P>
The most hopeful scenario most East European government officials can offer is 
what might be called the "Pittsburgh Solution." Governments throughout the 
region plan to close massive, obsolete and money-losing factories to 
restructure their economies. Those closures will cause difficult unemployment 
but will also reduce pollution, just as the shrinking of the U.S. steel 
industry in the late 1970s and early 1980s helped to clean the skies of western 
Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that rather painful approach to reducing pollution, no government in 
Eastern Europe has yet laid plans for tackling the massive cleanup job. In 
Krakow, regional environmental director Garlicki admits, he doesn't even have 
the measuring equipment he needs to monitor emissions. 
</P>
<P>
In Teplice, officials currently monitor two pollutants -- sulfur dioxide and 
nitrogen oxide -- but say they will need several years to measure other 
problems. Toxic waste dumps are only beginning to be catalogued. 
</P>
<P>
Internally, cleanup efforts have met resistance. In Krakow, for example, 
Garlicki's agency wants to limit the steel mills' production to help cut 
pollution in the area. But he is running into resistance from the mill 
managers, who contend that the economy would be hurt severely if the mill had 
to operate at a lower speed. 
</P>
<P>
Garlicki's colleagues across the border in Czechoslovakia face similar 
problems. In Teplice and other heavily polluted areas, the government pays 
parents to send children to camps in the mountains on weekends for breathing 
breaks. But when temperature inversions trap smog over the city, health 
officials have little power to do more than warn residents to stay indoors, 
said Dr. Frantisek Kotesovec of the regional health commission. 
</P>
<P>
Although Teplice's environment has improved somewhat over the past six years, 
the average sulfur dioxide level in the city's air remains more than twice as 
high as the level international health experts consider dangerous. And during 
inversions, particularly common in the spring and fall, pollution levels can 
soar to staggeringly unhealthy amounts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dangerous Levels 
</P>
<P>
For 12 straight days last November, for example, sulfur dioxide levels exceeded 
400 micrograms per cubic meter of air -- the level at which officials can order 
minor reductions in power plant output. Pollution peaks during that period were 
far above the 400 level, and that, said Kotesovec, "was not the worst, just an 
example." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials consider prolonged exposure to any sulfur dioxide levels above 
80 micrograms to be dangerous to health. Short-term exposure above 365 
micrograms also causes lung damage, U.S. officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the Czechoslovak government recognizes any nitrogen oxide 
concentrations above 100 micrograms per cubic meter as unhealthful. In 
November, Teplice had 22 days with concentrations above that level. 
</P>
<P>
Meaningful solutions here would require massive and expensive changes in the 
nation's electric energy supply system. But even less dramatic changes have 
been slow in coming. 
</P>
<P>
The regional government, for example, will pay to lay gas pipelines to houses 
so residents can stop using sulfur-laden soft coal. But the residents must pay 
for new furnaces and gas lines inside their homes -- and the price tag is 
nearly three-quarters of a factory worker's average annual pay.

TRAVELERS IRKED BY SURPRISE TAX ON FOREIGN BUYS

<P>
When Rita Carton visited Hong Kong, Singapore and Thailand last summer she 
thought she was getting a bargain when she purchased handsome custom-made 
clothing, delicate silks and a watch. 
</P>
<P>
But then she opened her mailbox last week to find the state of California had 
the last word -- a bill for $110.16 in taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"I was livid," said Carton, a buyer for a women's specialty store in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't the amount of the tax that made her so angry, she said, but the fact 
that when she left American soil last May she had no inkling that she would be 
expected to pay a 6.5% tax on any goods she purchased and brought home with 
her. Had she known about the tax, Carton said, she might have kept her spending 
to a minimum. 
</P>
<P>
"I've gone out of the country two or three times a year for the past five years 
and never had to pay this tax before," she fumed. "Everybody knows they have to 
pay (federal) duty when they bring more than a certain amount back, but this 
state tax was totally out of the blue." 
</P>
<P>
Carton is not alone. The State Board of Equalization has billed 4,000 
California residents for "use taxes" owed on purchases made abroad last year. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1990, board officials estimate that as many as 58,000 California 
residents will have received the unwelcome notice to pay the state use tax, 
which generally applies to any goods purchased out of state for use in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
They estimate the average foreign traveler will pay a tax of $160, which will 
add a total of about $9.4 million in revenue to the state treasury each year. 
</P>
<P>
Carton and others included in the first wave of billings called the agency last 
week to protest. 
</P>
<P>
"There was absolutely no notice of this. It was a total surprise. No one had 
ever heard of it," said John Myers, the president of a small mining company in 
King City who got a bill for $83.44 after a European trip. 
</P>
<P>
Most states have a use tax, but California and North Dakota are the only ones 
to attempt to apply it to all residents traveling overseas. Although residents 
are supposed to pay a use tax on all goods purchased in other states as well, 
the board has not found a way to enforce such a levy across the board. 
</P>
<P>
However, officials said the new enforcement effort in California and North 
Dakota is being watched closely by other states that might copy it if it is 
successful. 
</P>
<P>
The California tax bills will be sent to any state resident who traveled abroad 
in 1989 and made a declaration with the U.S. Customs Service of goods purchased 
in foreign countries. Taxpayers are given a four- to eight-week deadline to pay 
the bill. If they fail to make the payment on time, they become subject to 
penalties and interest charges. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Cordell, the state board's assistant deputy director for business 
taxes, said the tax has been on the books since 1935, but until recent months 
it was rarely possible to enforce it on overseas purchases. 
</P>
<P>
As it turns out, he said, California taxpayers have the Customs Service to 
thank for this new opportunity to pay more taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Cordell said state officials decided to begin enforcing the tax when they 
learned that the customs agency had automated its files to such an extent that 
it would be a relatively simple procedure to pull out documents filed by 
California residents and turn them over to the state board for perusal. 
</P>
<P>
"These declarations used to be kept in millions of files. We would have had to 
send our whole staff out to paw through them if we wanted to enforce this tax," 
he said. "But as things were automated the information became easily available. 
Then all we had to do was work out an arrangement with customs." 
</P>
<P>
Once an agreement was reached with customs, the agency decided it would begin 
to enforce the tax on all purchases made in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
But officials acknowledge that when they made that decision they failed to 
consider that most California residents who stepped onto a ship or airplane 
destined for foreign lands would have no knowledge of the tax. 
</P>
<P>
Delena Bratton, tax service specialist for the board, said in December the 
agency distributed press releases and included notices about the new 
enforcement of the tax in bulletins it sends to 900,000 businesses, but by then 
most taxpayers had already taken their trips. 
</P>
<P>
"Typically, when there is a new tax there is a lot of discussion about it 
before it goes into effect. We lost the opportunity for information to get out 
that way on this tax because it was a tax started in 1935. However, all of that 
is not to say we shouldn't have done a better job of getting the word out," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The board is now trying to make up for its oversight, she said, by notifying 
travel agents and accountants of the tax and posting notices at ports of entry. 
</P>
<P>
Conway Collis, the new chairman of the Board of Equalization, said he has 
received so many complaints about the tax that he may propose that the board 
delay the enforcement until "proper notification can be made." 
</P>
<P>
"It's outrageous that we didn't let anyone know about this before we enforced 
it," he said. "The Board of Equalization is not out to get taxpayers as we have 
shown by recent changes like the addition of a taxpayers' rights advocate to 
our staff. (But) we obviously need to make sure that there is a standard 
procedure for notifying taxpayers when a tax is being enforced. " 
</P>
<P>
However, for Carton and Myers, notification is only part of the problem. To add 
insult to injury, both said they were overcharged on their tax bills. 
</P>
<P>
They said they should have been taxed at a rate that was in effect last summer 
when they took their trips but instead they were taxed at a rate that was in 
effect in December, when taxpayers were being charged an extra quarter of a 
percent to help pay for earthquake relief. 
</P>
<P>
Bratton acknowledged that the additional charge was a "mistake" and that a 
similar error had been made on nearly all the tax bills that were distributed. 
She said the agency would refund any amount over $10 that was due a taxpayer. 
</P>
<P>
Myers, who traveled to Europe and purchased leather goods, jewelry and gifts 
for family and friends, said the tax enforcement also appeared to be 
"discriminatory" because travelers who purchased less than $400 worth of goods 
do not have to make a customs declaration. The federal government only charges 
a 10% duty tax when the total amount of a travelers' purchases exceeds $400. 
</P>
<P>
"It (the state tax) should be paid by everyone not just those who exceed the 
limit and file a declaration," Myers said. 
</P>
<P>
Cordell acknowledged that there is no way the state can bill people who aren't 
required to declare their purchases with customs. 
</P>
<P>
"Technically they still owe us, and we would appreciate it if they would 
contact us voluntarily and (pay the tax). The state needs the money," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The California use tax was originally passed to protect state businesses who 
were hurt by residents purchasing high-priced items out of state to avoid sales 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Cordell said the Board of Equalization already taxes automobiles, boats and 
airplanes purchased out of state. But until the agreement with the Customs 
Service, it was not cost-effective to collect the tax on most consumer goods 
purchased overseas. 
</P>
<P>
On her next trip, Carton, for one, plans to test how effective the board's new 
program really is. She intends to re-enter the United States in Washington 
state -- not California.

Like many ranchers in the West, Fred Mallery is familiar with the tales of 
secret deals, bloody fights and quick riches that make up the region's water 
lore. 
</P>
<P>
These days Mallery is especially interested in the saga of the distant Owens 
Valley. In a blitz of deceit and cash early this century, agents took control 
of the fertile valley's streams and pointed them 300 miles south to water a new 
desert metropolis -- Los Angeles. Today, sagebrush covers the valley's old 
farms, and Owens Lake, once crossed by ferries and barges, is a vast dust bed. 
</P>
<P>
It is an old story, but one that is on a lot of minds here along the Nevada 
border in northeastern California, where Mallery grows alfalfa and breeds 
cattle on his family's old homestead in the Honey Lake Valley. 
</P>
<P>
For once again, an arid, growing city has come to an agricultural valley 
looking for water to ship south -- and the natives, fearing that history may 
repeat, have begun to fight. This time the thirsty invader is not Los Angeles 
nor even from California. It is Reno, 75 miles south of Mallery's farmhouse and 
hay barns. 
</P>
<P>
"We all know what happened in the Owens Valley," Mallery said recently. "The 
fear is here." 
</P>
<P>
Booming Reno is bursting at the seams. New homes are spilling over mud-brown 
hills into dry desert valleys recently populated by coyotes and jack rabbits. 
</P>
<P>
But just as corn and hay cannot grow without water, neither can cities -- 
especially on the lee side of the Sierra Nevada, which extracts most of the 
moisture from Pacific storms before they sail over Reno and across the Great 
Basin. 
</P>
<P>
Reno now gets most of its water from California by way of the Truckee River, 
which spills to life over a dam at the northwest corner of Lake Tahoe. But the 
Truckee's flow past Reno's downtown casinos is not enough for all the 
dishwashers, toilets and lawns that officials eagerly envision being installed 
in the 1990s on the city's expanding outskirts. A new master plan calls for 
extensive development in the rural areas around Reno and its neighbor city, 
Sparks, together the second-largest metropolitan area in fast-growing Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in Washoe County, which includes Reno and Sparks, have made an ironic 
choice in tying their future to the Honey Lake area, site of an armed border 
skirmish involving California and Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
California won the rights to the shallow lake in the 1860s in a brief battle 
over border lines called the Sagebrush War. After the revolt -- led by Isaac 
Roop, a former governor of the Nevada territory -- failed, the state line was 
moved east to annex Honey Lake to California. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nevada Water 
</P>
<P>
Washoe County has no plans to reassert Nevada's sovereignty over Honey Lake, 
and no exchange of gunfire is expected. But the Nevadans, since the early 
1980s, have wanted to pump ground water from beneath Fish Springs Ranch on 
their side of the state line and pipe it south to Reno. 
</P>
<P>
Here on the California side, Mallery and other ranchers say that the Nevada 
pumps could draw down the aquifer they say the two states share and thus harm 
the wells used to irrigate fields. 
</P>
<P>
They also complain that the Nevada pumps could lower the water table enough to 
dry up springs that seep naturally into some pastures and moisten wetlands used 
by deer and other wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
"While this would be a more subtle result . . . it would be no less 
destructive," said Jack Hanson, president of the Lassen County Cattlemen's 
Assn., in a letter to a California Senate committee. "The potential effects on 
natural vegetation, wildlife and cattle grazing in the area would be severe." 
</P>
<P>
Nevada's position is that the $80-million Truckee Meadows water project, as it 
is known, will have no impact in California. Franklyn Jeans, the Reno investor 
who is in charge of the project, insists that preliminary geological studies 
have found that a subterranean clay barrier separates the water beneath Fish 
Springs Ranch from the water basin beneath the California side. Thus, he says, 
the pumping in Nevada will not even be noticed in California. 
</P>
<P>
The battle could turn on a crucial document to be released next month -- a U.S. 
Geological Survey report that will be the first independent study of whether 
such a barrier exists and of how much water is at stake. 
</P>
<P>
Jeans said he has offered to install monitoring wells so the California 
ranchers can keep an eye on the condition of the aquifers beneath the area. But 
Reno's plans have prompted wary officials in the lightly populated California 
mountains from Lake Tahoe north to the Oregon line to keep a close watch on the 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Lassen and five nearby counties on the California side have begun meeting to 
keep tabs on Nevada's moves. The counties helped push the Legislature to create 
an agency that gave Lassen County ranchers and officials the power to negotiate 
with Nevada. The bill forming the Honey Lake ground water management district 
passed unanimously and was signed by Gov. George Deukmejian last Oct. 2. 
</P>
<P>
"Our biggest fear is, 'Where do you stop them? Where do you draw the line when 
they get thirsty again?' " Mallery said. "We fear they will sweep through here 
like what happened in the Owens Valley." 
</P>
<P>
The Owens Valley story has struck a chord here because, according to Lassen 
County Supervisor Helen Williams, "It's an example of what has happened before 
when a larger entity preys upon a smaller entity. I think there is tremendous 
concern about what the environmental effects will be." 
</P>
<P>
When Los Angeles long ago found itself in the same situation as Reno today -- 
coveting rapid growth but lacking water -- the city scoured the possibilities 
and sent agents bearing cash to the Owens Valley. 
</P>
<P>
In 1913, the Los Angeles Aqueduct began capturing most of the flow from the 
Owens River. Farmers lost their access to irrigation water, and many sold out 
to the city of Los Angeles. In the 1940s, Owens Lake finally dried up, leaving 
a 100-square-mile bed of caustic dust that winter winds blow over the 
California deserts. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles -- which now owns nearly all of the pasture and rangeland in the 
valley -- also began pumping ground water in the 1940s. New wells in the 1970s 
were blamed by residents for lowering the water table, denuding the valley of 
hundreds of trees and forcing residents to drill new wells. 
</P>
<P>
Jeans and Washoe County officials say they can understand the fears of 
Californians about another Owens Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"No doubt about it, there's a built-in fear," Jeans said. "It's an automatic 
knee-jerk reaction anywhere along the east slope of the Sierras." 
</P>
<P>
But, he added, the Truckee Meadows project "just isn't the same thing. This 
isn't a rape-and-pillage kind of thing." 
</P>
<P>
Nevada law forbids ground-water "mining" -- taking more water than nature 
replenishes -- and the Nevada state engineer will not issue the necessary 
permit unless the Geological Survey report and other studies show that there is 
enough water, Jeans said. 
</P>
<P>
But the question of how much water Reno and Washoe County want is feeding the 
anxiety on the California side, especially in Lassen County, which includes the 
Honey Lake area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pipeline Too Large 
</P>
<P>
Lassen ranchers say the pipeline that will convey the water south to Reno is 
far larger than needed for the 20,000 acre-feet a year that Jeans said his 
project will eventually use. They fear that the rising value of water in the 
arid West could lead to some California ranchers switching from the cattle 
business to the water business by hooking their wells up to Jeans' pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
Jeans himself set such an example. He and his partners bought the Fish Springs 
Ranch several years ago, intending to raise cattle and alfalfa. Then he found 
that there was more money to be made farming water, Jeans said. 
</P>
<P>
But Jeans said the larger capacity of the pipeline to Reno is needed to allow 
for heavier flows in summer, when Reno's other water sources are less reliable. 
</P>
<P>
Lassen officials also say they do not know how much water they will need for 
their own growth. The area has grown from 21,000 people in 1980 to nearly 
30,000 now and has been one of the fastest-developing areas in California in 
recent years. Planning Director Bob Sorvaag said another 6,000 people could 
arrive in the next few years, some drawn by new industry and some by expansion 
of a state prison outside Susanville, the county seat. 
</P>
<P>
In an unusual move to ease tensions across the state lines, the elected 
officials of Washoe County came to Susanville last month for a public meeting 
with the Lassen County Board of Supervisors. While still chary, the rivals have 
at least begun talking. 
</P>
<P>
"The relationship is improving," Jeans said. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides said they hope to avoid the cumbersome legal maneuvering that 
typically delays efforts by states to settle water differences. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, California and Nevada negotiated 13 years on a compact to divvy 
up water from Lake Tahoe and three major rivers. Once each state gave its 
approval, the compact waited 15 years in vain for congressional approval before 
California and Nevada gave up trying. Even a relatively uncontroversial pact 
over water in the Goose Lake area did not pass Congress for 21 years after it 
was ratified by Oregon and California.

EMOTIONAL BARRY VOWS TO SEEK WAY TO 'HEAL BODY, MIND AND SOUL' 
</P>

<P>
An emotional District of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry, facing crack cocaine 
charges and a shattered political future, announced Sunday that he intends to 
"find a way to begin to heal my body, mind and soul." 
</P>
<P>
Barry, 53, who originally was scheduled to launch his campaign for a fourth 
term Sunday, described the days since his arrest by FBI agents Thursday night 
as "the most difficult of my life, more difficult than fighting my way out of 
poverty as a black youth born in the segregated Deep South, more difficult than 
the fear and the hatred I faced as a civil rights leader in the 1960s, more 
difficult than I could have imagined, because this time I have come to face my 
deepest human failures." 
</P>
<P>
Barry, appearing close to tears, made his statement surrounded by members of 
the clergy in front of St. Timothy's Episcopal Church, located near his 
Washington home. At his side was his wife, who at times grasped his hand. 
</P>
<P>
Barry, who in the past has repeatedly denied using drugs, took no questions and 
did not specifically mention drug abuse in his comments. He did not directly 
state that he will seek treatment and did not address the question of whether 
he will remain in office. 
</P>
<P>
"I realize I'm going to have to walk this journey by myself," he said. "It's 
going to take Marion Barry walking this journey. But I say to others who are 
pained and hurt as I am: 'Join me brothers and sisters. We can make it. We will 
make it. It's going to be a lonely journey, but I stand and God stands with 
me.' " 
</P>
<P>
Barry said he had spent the morning praying and talking with members of the 
clergy. 
</P>
<P>
"They helped me feel good about the fact that, in the final analysis, it is not 
the title that a person holds that is important," he said. "It is not Marion 
Barry the mayor that counts. It is Marion Barry the person. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"These ministers have helped me to keep the strength that I need to announce 
today that I'm going to find a way to begin to heal my body, mind and soul." 
</P>
<P>
When he finished, Effi, his wife of 12 years, said she was grateful to God for 
giving Barry "the strength to admit to the whole world that, as a mortal human 
being, he has reached the hour of reckoning where he realizes that it is truly 
in God's hands." 
</P>
<P>
Turning to her husband, she said: "Marion, for you to admit to the world that 
you have a problem, (that) you need to deal with your problem to make yourself 
whole again, is truly a burden that has been lifted from our souls. And I know 
that for our family this is just the beginning. And we -- Christopher (their 
son) and I -- will be there with you every step of the way." 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Harold Brookins, who led Barry and the other clergy members in prayer 
before Barry spoke, told reporters after the mayor's statement that Barry had 
told him Saturday that he had a substance abuse problem. 
</P>
<P>
"He came to it with humility," Brookins said. "He broke down and he cried, and 
he said that 'I have made the decision. I'm going for help . . . and I'm going 
right away, as soon as all the logistics can be worked out.' " 
</P>
<P>
Lurma Rackley, the mayor's press secretary, told reporters she believed Barry's 
most serious problem is with alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
Barry was arrested Thursday night by FBI agents and charged with a misdemeanor 
for possession of cocaine. Agents said in an affidavit filed in court that the 
mayor was videotaped buying and smoking crack cocaine in a downtown hotel where 
he had gone to meet a longtime woman friend who had decided to cooperate with 
the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
Jay B. Stephens, the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, said blood and 
urine samples taken from the mayor after his arrest had tested positive for 
cocaine ingestion. If convicted, he could face a year in prison and a $100,000 
fine. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, his attorney, R. Kenneth Mundy, said Barry would plead innocent to 
the charges and seek a jury trial. A hearing is scheduled for Feb. 5.

AMERICAN ALBUM: OKIES JOINING A SORT OF 'GRAPES OF WRATH' IN REVERSE.

ELK CITY, Okla.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What with all the bad air in the East Bay of San Francisco, and what with Mabel 
Rafferty's asthma, her doctor told her that she needed to move to the 
California desert. 
</P>
<P>
She thought that one over for a while and decided to move, all right, but not 
to the desert. 
</P>
<P>
"I said: 'Nuts, I'll just go back where I came from,' " she recalls. Where she 
came from was Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
And therein is a tale. For decades, since the Great Depression, thousands of 
Oklahomans packed their belongings and headed to California for better jobs, 
better homes and a better life. Many succeeded. Now, the flood is headed the 
other way. 
</P>
<P>
Mabel Rafferty, who once was a cook for the Tournament of Roses (and once met 
Dwight D. Eisenhower in that capacity), bought a house in Elk City in western 
Oklahoma. For a three-bedroom brick house she paid the grand total of $39,500, 
which comes to a $354-a-month house payment. In the Bay Area she had been 
paying $800 a month for a small apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Her project for the spring will be landscaping the acre that came with the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
What could she have gotten in the Bay Area for that price? 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't have bought a pup tent," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Down the road a piece in Sayre live Fannie and Harold Gray, late of 
Westminster, Calif., in Orange County. They are Okies who made the migration to 
California in 1967 and returned to the place of their youth last year. It was a 
nice enough life in California, but both of them knew they would have a problem 
making their house payments after Harold retired from his teaching job. 
</P>
<P>
Then the Grays heard about a great house for sale from their cousins, Wallace 
and Billie Vincent, late of Placentia, Calif., and now good citizens of Sayre. 
They only had to look at it once when Fannie said she wanted it. The house, on 
an acre in the country, was $65,000. 
</P>
<P>
"We stole this one," Harold said. 
</P>
<P>
The Grays also went back to California and sold their home there for $150,000. 
In 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The Oklahoma Department of Commerce has estimated that about 50,000 of the 
900,000 people who left the Sooner State between 1930 and 1960 returned in the 
last 10 years. Most of those returning are retirees moving back to Oklahoma to 
live out their golden years. 
</P>
<P>
For many of them it is a matter of pure economics. They can sell their houses 
in California, pay cash for homes in Oklahoma and have money left over for 
retirement nest eggs. 
</P>
<P>
Others find the quality of life back home more appealing after years of living 
with smog, gridlock and the faster pace in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"I played nine holes of golf this morning," said Harold Gray. "I can go hunting 
and fishing any time I want to. The one thing I miss most is that if there is 
some little thing I need, I can't go down to a big hardware store and buy it." 
</P>
<P>
Billie Vincent said there was something else that was appealing: "If you want 
to go outside and yell, you can." 
</P>
<P>
Now, western Oklahoma could hardly be described as lush. And it was hit hard by 
the oil bust of the '80s that decimated the economy of the state. But it does 
offer cheap housing -- incredibly cheap by California standards -- and that 
fact was not lost on the town of Clinton, the self-described "Hub City of 
Western Oklahoma." 
</P>
<P>
Clinton has mounted a campaign, something of a "Grapes of Wrath" in reverse, to 
lure Okies back from California. The core of that drive so far has been to run 
in California newspapers classified ads extolling the virtues of Clinton and 
environs. 
</P>
<P>
"This is really healthy for both states," said Dale Jones, a Clinton business 
leader and one of the prime movers in the campaign to attract new residents. 
"Once they retire, what has California really got to offer?" 
</P>
<P>
Since the campaign began, the Clinton Chamber of Commerce has sent out 36 
packets to California residents who have requested information about the town. 
The goal, as Jones put it, is to convince people that Oklahoma is no longer a 
place "with Indians and cowboys running all over the place." 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the bait is real estate information, multiple listings showing 
photos of homes at prices ranging from $20,000 up to $225,000 (for a 
5,000-square-foot house). 
</P>
<P>
Jones concedes that the plains of western Oklahoma might not be for everyone. 
Oklahoma City is an hour and a half away. There are no professional sports 
teams, no beaches and no mall the size of, say, Orange Coast Plaza. But the 
area does seem to have an appeal to those who have lived here before. 
</P>
<P>
People like Mabel Rafferty. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, there were no surprises," she said. "I grew up 30 miles from here."

KEY REFORMER QUITS EAST GERMAN COMMUNIST PARTY;

EAST EUROPE: THE DRESDEN MAYOR'S RESIGNATION DEALS THE STRUGGLING ORGANIZATION

<TEXT>
<P>
The reeling East German Communist Party received another sharp blow late Sunday 
with the resignation of one of its brightest reformist stars. 
</P>
<P>
The 46-year-old mayor of Dresden, Wolfgang Berghofer, announced he is leaving 
the party along with 39 other senior party members from the southern part of 
the country. The group demanded that the party disband. 
</P>
<P>
Berghofer's resignation had been rumored ahead of time, but it still came as a 
severe setback to the Communists, who are struggling to regain credibility with 
East German voters in preparation for the country's first free elections, 
scheduled for May 6. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts predicted that Berghofer's defection will result in the collapse 
and dissolution of the party before the election takes place. The Dresden mayor 
was generally considered the party's No. 3 in terms of popularity. 
</P>
<P>
Berghofer's announcement came Sunday evening, on the heels of an earlier action 
at an emergency party congress, expelling former leader Egon Krenz from 
membership. Krenz, the man who opened the Berlin Wall in early November, had 
taken over as head of East Germany's government in October, replacing the 
toppled Erich Honecker. Honecker was expelled from the party in December, the 
same month that Krenz quit as party chairman. 
</P>
<P>
The emergency congress also threw out of the party 13 other members of the old 
ruling Politburo, including Guenter Schabowski, a reputed reformer, and former 
Defense Minister Heinz Kessler. 
</P>
<P>
But at the end of a long weekend meeting, the congress continued to resist 
pressure that the party disband. 
</P>
<P>
Krenz appealed his expulsion, arguing that he had saved the party from 
disintegration by opening the Berlin Wall and undertaking other liberalizing 
reforms. His appeal made him the first former top leader to fight back 
publicly. A number of other former top party people were expelled last month, 
and nine are in prison on charges of corruption. 
</P>
<P>
Senior party members who joined Berghofer in quitting issued a sharply critical 
statement Sunday, declaring that the Communist Party had "ruined the country 
and should be dissolved." They also called for reunification with West Germany, 
a market economy, and the cleanup of a heavily polluted environment. 
</P>
<P>
As the emergency meeting got under way here Saturday, a motion by some members 
to disband the party was overruled by a secret vote with the support of new 
party leader Gregor Gysi, who himself was catapulted into the top position as a 
reformist-minded dissident lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
Among the defectors who joined Berghofer in leaving the discredited party 
Sunday was Friedrich Wokurka, who heads the state-owned Robotron company, East 
Germany's largest electronics firm. 
</P>
<P>
Most political observers believe that Berghofer will join the newly created 
Social Democratic Party, a sister to the West German party of the same name. 
The West German Social Democrats form the main opposition to the ruling 
coalition, headed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union. 
</P>
<P>
Berghofer did not announce his future plans Sunday, but if he should move over 
to the Social Democrats as expected, it could give the new party a significant 
edge in the coming election, according to political specialists.

The Bush Administration has told Israel that it opposes secret shipments of 
cluster bombs to the Marxist government of Ethiopia for use against rebel 
troops and villages, officials said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said they have received several credible reports that Ethiopia's air 
force has recently begun dropping cluster bombs, which hurl deadly shrapnel 
over a wide area, in rebel-held areas.

If the bombs were U.S.-made or based on U.S. technology, their shipment to 
Ethiopia would probably be illegal under American law, officials said. But when 
the United States asked Israel whether it was providing the bombs to the 
Ethiopian regime, the response was "unclear," a U.S. diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
"They told us, in effect, that they are no longer sending any -- that they 
aren't sending any right now," he said. "But they've been vague about what 
they've done in the past." 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Israel's embassy in Washington, Ruth Yaron, said: "We don't 
sell cluster bombs to Ethiopia, and we don't give them either." Asked whether 
Israel had sent the bombs to Ethiopia in the past, Yaron replied, "I wouldn't 
be able to answer that, beyond what I've already said." 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials said that the American ambassador in Israel, William 
A. Brown, has repeatedly told high Israeli officials that the United States is 
concerned about their reported aid to Ethiopia, including cluster bombs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
U.S. Supply Cut Off 
</P>
<P>
The United States supplied cluster bombs to Israel until 1982, when the Reagan 
Administration halted shipments because Israel used them in civilian areas 
during its invasion of Lebanon. Cluster bombs were used by the United States in 
Vietnam and by the Soviet Union in Afghanistan, often with devastating effect. 
</P>
<P>
An official said Sunday that the Administration believes any cluster bombs 
going to Ethiopia "are more than likely of Israeli manufacture." Even so, he 
noted, the United States prohibits Israel from selling weapons based on U.S. 
designs or technology without approval from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The issue highlights a strange and little-noticed alliance between democratic 
Israel and Ethiopia's Soviet-backed dictatorship, one of the world's most 
repressive regimes. 
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem government has avidly pursued ties with Ethiopia for both 
strategic and humanitarian reasons. Strategically, Israel has been working to 
establish relationships with many African countries as a counterweight to the 
hostility of most Arab nations. 
</P>
<P>
On a humanitarian level, Ethiopia is home to an estimated 18,000 Jews, and 
Israel hopes that by cooperating with the Addis Ababa regime, it can win 
emigration rights for those who wish to leave. 
</P>
<P>
Israel and Ethiopia established diplomatic relations in October, ending a break 
of 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
Even before the formal resumption of relations, U.S. officials said, Israel 
provided the Addis Ababa regime with new military hardware, including 
communications equipment. However, Israel has not publicly acknowledged any 
military aid or sales to Ethiopia, an Israeli official said. 
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian government has long been seeking military aid to help fight 
rebels in Eritrea, the area along the country's northern Red Sea coast. Eritrea 
has been in rebellion against the central government for 27 years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aiding Marxist Regime 
</P>
<P>
The United States opposes any military aid to Ethiopia because it believes aid 
helps prop up the Marxist regime, officials said. In addition, they said, there 
have been many credible reports of attacks by the Ethiopian armed forces, 
including the air force, against civilians in Eritrea. 
</P>
<P>
"These are not nice people," one official said. 
</P>
<P>
Charges that Israel has supplied cluster bombs were first suggested by former 
President Jimmy Carter, who said last month that Ethiopia had received the 
bombs "from one of our Middle East allies." The Bush Administration's concern 
about the cluster bombs was first reported by The New York Times on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Carter, who did not name Israel as the source of the bombs, said U.S. diplomats 
had told him "that the Ethiopian government was quite happy that they had 
finally acquired cluster bombs, and they thought they could end the war quickly 
because of the devastating effect of those cluster bombs being dropped on the 
villages in the north." 
</P>
<P>
Israel has been seeking for several years to arrange emigration for the 
Ethiopian Jews, a remote community of black subsistence farmers who have kept 
Jewish traditions for centuries. A secret airlift brought thousands of the Jews 
out through neighboring Sudan in 1985, but the Sudanese government discovered 
the operation and stopped it.

YELTSIN DECRIES USE OF TROOPS IN AZERBAIJAN

The Kremlin was wrong to send in troops to put down the virtual civil war 
between Azerbaijan and Armenia, maverick Soviet politician Boris N. Yeltsin 
said over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
He also said that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev could soon fall from 
power. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a mistake to dispatch troops and suppress ethnic problems by armed 
force," Yeltsin told Akira Yamagishi, president of Rengo, Japan's largest labor 
organization, on Saturday, the financial daily Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
It also quoted Yeltsin as saying that "perestroika at present is going round 
and getting nowhere. Its future prospect is dark unless President Gorbachev 
joins forces with us. It (Gorbachev's regime) might collapse within several 
months." 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who arrived for an 11-day visit Jan. 13, said in an interview with the 
Mainichi Daily News that British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has a much 
more austere life style than Gorbachev, who, as the leader of a socialist 
country, should have a standard of living closer to that of the masses. 
</P>
<P>
"For example, when Thatcher visits a foreign country, she rides in the same 
plane that ordinary citizens use, but Gorbachev can't do that," he was quoted 
as saying. 
</P>
<P>
"While Thatcher rides in a car with two other people, Gorbachev uses a 
procession of four luxury cars plus an escort," he added. 
</P>
<P>
"There is too much of a gap between the standard of living of ordinary people 
and that of the most elevated party leaders," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Although 48 million Soviet citizens are living below the lowest standard of 
living, the leaders are indulging in the most unnecessary luxuries." 
</P>
<P>
He also said East European socialism became corrupted "because it was state 
socialism guarded by the military." 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, former Moscow party chief, was fired from the junior ranks of the 
Communist Party's ruling Politburo for demanding faster change. But he 
rebounded in March, 1989, taking 89% of the Moscow vote in parliamentary 
elections to win the country's largest grass-roots mandate.

MURDOCH PAYS $4 MILLION FOR 50% INTEREST IN 2 HUNGARIAN PAPERS

<P>
Newspaper publisher Rupert Murdoch has purchased a 50% interest in two 
independent Hungarian newspapers for $4 million, the official MTI news agency 
said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The Australian-born entrepreneur closed the deals Saturday amid signs he plans 
to expand his newspaper empire into Eastern Europe, where democratic reforms 
have spawned dozens of independent publications. 
</P>
<P>
MTI said Murdoch's firm, The News Corp., signed contracts Saturday to purchase 
50% of the shares of the daily newspaper Mai Nap (Today's Day), which has a 
circulation of 100,000, and the weekly Reform, with a circulation of 400,000. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the $4 million purchasing price, Murcoch agreed to set up a 
$750,000 development fund for both papers, MTI said. 
</P>
<P>
Both are independent tabloids that have a flashy style and sensational content 
not unlike many Murdoch tabloids in the West.

Foreign ministers from the 12 European Community nations have agreed to send 
about $70 million in emergency food and medical aid to Romania and Poland, 
officials here said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
After a four-hour meeting Saturday night in Dublin Castle, the foreign 
ministers said they will send shipments of beef, butter, olive oil, grain and 
medical supplies to Romania and food products to Poland. 
</P>
<P>
The final details of the aid packages will be worked out later this week, the 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Western Europe already has sent some medical supplies and other emergency aid 
to Romania as well as food packages to Poland over the last year. 
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers also sent a signal of support to Soviet President Mikhail 
S. Gorbachev by specifically endorsing his proposal for a 35-nation East-West 
summit this year to chart the future of a radically altered Europe.

Joseph Hazelwood, the former captain of the Exxon Valdez, the supertanker that 
spilled 11 million gallons of oil into Prince William Sound, said in a Life 
magazine interview that he has been a scapegoat for aspects of the disaster 
that were the responsibility of others. Hazelwood, who goes on trial Jan. 29 in 
Anchorage on criminal mischief charges for his role in the oil spill, said he 
feels the media has laid all the responsibility for the damage caused by the 
spill on his shoulders, despite what he called an inadequate initial cleanup 
effort.

4 RESCUED AFTER THEIR SMALL PLANE CRASHES INTO SEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four people were rescued from the waters off Rancho Palos Verdes on Sunday 
after their light airplane crashed into the sea, the Redondo Beach Harbor 
Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
The crew of a charter whale-watching boat pulled the four victims from the 
water minutes after the single-engine Bellanca aircraft crashed about 3:50 
p.m., said Harbor Patrol spokesman Officer Kevin McCamy. 
</P>
<P>
The victims -- two men, a woman and a 12-year-old girl -- were treated for 
minor cuts and bruises at South Bay Hospital and released, McCamy said. Their 
names were not released. 
</P>
<P>
McCamy said the four-seat plane, which was returning to Santa Monica from Santa 
Catalina Island, went down after its fuel pump and a back-up pump both 
malfunctioned. 
</P>
<P>
"Fortunately, the plane landed on its belly," McCamy said. "They got a 
relatively good landing. They were able to gather their things and get into the 
water." 
</P>
<P>
After the victims discovered that the plane was temporarily buoyant, McCamy 
said, they scrambled out of the water and onto the wings of the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, the crew of the whale-watching vessel Voyager arrived and helped 
the stranded foursome aboard.

TEACHERS DELAY A STAND ON SPENDING PLAN

<P>
The policy-making council of the California Teachers Assn., meeting in Los 
Angeles, voted unanimously Sunday to adopt a "watch" position on a proposed 
amendment to the state Constitution that would liberalize state spending 
limits. 
</P>
<P>
Before the association endorses the so-called state Constitutional Amendment 1, 
which would modify the 1979 "Gann Limit," leaders want drafters of the measure 
to spell out more clearly guarantees on education financing, said association 
President Ed Foglia. 
</P>
<P>
The association's 500-member State Council of Education, which ended its 
quarterly meeting Sunday, is scheduled to meet again in March. 
</P>
<P>
"If they (those drafting the amendment) carry out what they say they're going 
to do and give us what they say they will, I believe that the vote will be 
favorable in March," Foglia said. 
</P>
<P>
The amendment, backed by Gov. George Deukmejian and legislative leaders, will 
be on the ballot in June. If approved by the voters, it would permit the 
imposition of a 9-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax to improve transportation and 
ease traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
Two months ago, the 200,000-member teachers' organization had threatened to 
wage a war to defeat the amendment, believing it could erase many of the gains 
won by Proposition 98, which was passed by voters in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The teachers said that the amendment, as originally proposed, had introduced a 
loophole that would have allowed a reduction in education funds from 
Proposition 98, which provides that 40% of the state budget must go to schools.

FISHING CREW FLEES BOAT ABLAZE OFF PALOS VERDES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Coast Guard personnel took more than six hours to control a fire that broke out 
Sunday morning on a fishing trawler 18 miles south of the Palos Verdes 
Peninsula, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Ten crew members abandoned the "Luck Seven" and drifted in two life rafts for 
about 30 minutes before they were picked up by a passing fishing boat, Coast 
Guard Lt. John Dagostino said. 
</P>
<P>
The 96-foot trawler was carrying eels packed in peat moss, Dagostino said. 
</P>
<P>
The amount of damage done to the boat and the cause of the fire was not 
immediately determined, the lieutenant said. Authorities did not identify the 
boat's owner.

KRICKSTEIN HURT, COULD MISS DAVIS CUP

Aaron Krickstein limped out of the Australian Open today (Monday), his title 
bid wrecked by a groin injury that also threatens his place on the U.S. Davis 
Cup team. 
</P>
<P>
Krickstein plays singles on the U.S. squad, which faces Mexico in a first-round 
Davis Cup match at the La Costa resort in Carlsbad, Calif., on Feb. 2-4. 
</P>
<P>
Unseeded David Wheaton defeated Krickstein, seeded fifth, 7-6 (7-5), 6-4, 6-3, 
in the fourth round. But Krickstein clearly was hampered by the injury to the 
left side of his groin, which he suffered late in his third-round victory over 
Swede Lars Wahlgren. 
</P>
<P>
"I hoped I'd be able to play through it," Krickstein said. "It was OK for a set 
but at 2-2 in the second I hurt it again. 
</P>
<P>
"I've strained it pretty bad and I couldn't move very well to my right at all. 
</P>
<P>
"It was hard to concentrate. I knew I wasn't 100% by any means. I was just 
hoping with treatment it would be OK." 
</P>
<P>
Krickstein said he was not certain about his Davis Cup status. 
</P>
<P>
"You never know," he said. "The injury is high on the bone and it's a tough one 
to treat. I'll just have to wait and see what happens in the next few days." 
</P>
<P>
Wheaton, the last American in the men's singles, said he was aware late in the 
match that Krickstein was not moving freely. 
</P>
<P>
"I could see his lunging ability really wasn't there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Wheaton's advance to the first Grand Slam quarterfinal of his career continued 
the 20-year-old Minneapolis resident's meteoric rise. 
</P>
<P>
He was ranked 441st at the end of 1988, but has risen to 66th just 12 months 
later.

John McEnroe, the first player kicked out of the Australian Open for misconduct 
in its 85-year history, flew home to Los Angeles Monday. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe brushed silently past reporters at the airport and left with his wife, 
actress Tatum O'Neal, their two sons and his agent. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe threw his racket and a tantrum Sunday while leading his fourth-round 
match against Mikael Pernfors and was defaulted by the umpire. 
</P>
<P>
The action, which led to $6,500 in fines against McEnroe, made him the first 
player ejected for misconduct in any Grand Slam since pros and amateurs began 
playing together at the start of the open era in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
Two other players have been defaulted for bad behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Colombian-born Spaniard Willie Alvarez was defaulted from the French 
championships in 1963 and American Earl Cochell was ousted from the U.S. 
championships in the 1950s after a prematch altercation with officials. 
</P>
<P>
Third-seeded Stefan Edberg said McEnroe "only has himself to blame" for getting 
thrown out, but said his departure is "sad for the tournament." 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's done worse things than he did yesterday," Edberg said. "He's got 
a bad temper and he can't seem to do anything about it. Tennis has always had 
its characters. But the game needs players like John." 
</P>
<P>
Fellow American Aaron Krickstein, the fifth-seeded player who lost to David 
Wheaton today (Monday), said "some of the guys in the locker room said they 
were glad" McEnroe was thrown out. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe let himself get rattled by missed shots, close calls and a baby's 
cries, and after his default, with a 6-1, 4-6, 7-5, 2-4 lead, he admitted, "I 
don't really have anyone to blame but myself." 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe had been in Australia for three weeks with his family and seemed 
relaxed and fit. 
</P>
<P>
Yet all it took for McEnroe to revert to his old ways was a tough match against 
Pernfors, the Swedish-born two-time NCAA champion at Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
At one point in his match with Pernfors, McEnroe stood in front of a lineswoman 
he thought made a bad call. 
</P>
<P>
Bouncing a ball on his racket and glaring at her in intimidating fashion, 
McEnroe was hit with a code violation for unsportsmanlike conduct by umpire 
Gerry Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
He seemed to be in control of the match and himself again, but suddenly became 
distracted by a crying baby while serving the sixth game, with Pernfors ahead, 
3-2. 
</P>
<P>
"Give him a drink, the boy's hungry," McEnroe yelled, looking up in the section

<P>
Armstrong asked the parents to take the baby out of the stadium, and after the 
mother and baby left, a fan yelled, "Can we breathe, John?" 
</P>
<P>
After his disqualification was announced, McEnroe simply packed his rackets and 
left. 
</P>
<P>
"It's appalling," said Mal Tuohey, one of the 15,000 screaming fans. "He'll 
never come back to Melbourne again, and I don't blame him."

LENDL, GRAF OVERCOME MISTAKES TO WIN

Defending champions Ivan Lendl and Steffi Graf overcame unusually sloppy play 
Sunday, while American amateur sensation Angelica Gavaldon kept rolling to 
reach the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl hit 46 errors yet never was threatened in beating Australian Simon Youl, 
6-1, 6-3, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl will face Andrei Cherkasov in the next round after the unseeded Soviet 
teen-ager upset ninth-seeded Andres Gomez of Ecuador, 2-6, 6-3, 7-6 (8-6), 7-6 
(7-5). 
</P>
<P>
"I played Ivan once before at Hamburg last year and lost 6-4, 6-4," Cherkasov 
said. "We played for two hours, and at one point, I was up 3-1, 40-love. Then I 
lost my concentration, Lendl took control and it was over." 
</P>
<P>
It was Lendl having lapses of concentration during his victory over Youl, but 
he was still in control the entire match. 
</P>
<P>
Graf started with an ace and ended with another one to notch her 45th 
consecutive victory, 6-2, 6-3, over 13th-seeded Raffaella Reggi. 
</P>
<P>
Graf was in control of her match throughout, but was annoyed by an unusually 
high 28 unforced errors. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a lot left to improve," she said. "I need to find my right timing and 
I'm making too many errors." 
</P>
<P>
Graf's winning streak is one shy of her 46-match streak in 1988, which included 
titles in the French Open, Wimbledon and the U.S. Open. She also won the 
Australian that year to start her Grand Slam. Martina Navratilova holds the 
women's winning streak record of 74. 
</P>
<P>
Graf will face Patty Fendick in the quarters and the young American is looking 
forward to the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
The American already has beaten two seeds on her way to the final eight and 
isn't about to let the defending champion scare her. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a challenge," Fendick said. "I'm not the sort of player to roll over and 
die." 
</P>
<P>
Fendick, 25, will be playing in the quarters of a Grand Slam tournament for the 
first time in her eight-year pro career. 
</P>
<P>
The four-time All-American, a Stanford psychology graduate, is on the comeback 
trail after missing four months of last year with a shoulder injury. 
</P>
<P>
She followed a third-round victory over fifth-seeded Czech Jana Novotna with a 
7-5, 6-2 triumph over 16th-seeded Austrian Barbara Paulus, rallying from 2-5 
down in the first set Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Fendick has a new attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, when I got a break down, I started to panic," she said. "Now, I 
don't get too concerned. I just try to play harder. 
</P>
<P>
Graf holds a 3-0 record over Fendick, but the American believes her all-court 
game can trouble the West German. 
</P>
<P>
Gavaldon, an effervescent 16-year-old from Coronado, who entered as a qualifier 
ranked 192, upset 15th-seeded Gigi Fernandez 6-3, 1-6, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Gavaldon, taking high school correspondence courses, is playing her first 
professional tournament outside the United States and is the youngest player 
left in the field. 
</P>
<P>
Gavaldon, who beat former two-time champion Hana Mandlikova in the third round, 
next meets West German Claudia Porwik, who beat South African Dinky van 
Rensburg 7-6, 3-6, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Helena Sukova, who lost the 1989 finals against Graf, ended the surprising 
surge of Japan's Kimiko Date, 6-4, 6-3.

So much for Mr. Nice Guy. 
</P>
<P>
John McEnroe, still crazy after all these years, threw his racket and a tantrum 
Sunday at the Australian Open and became the first player tossed out of a Grand 
Slam event for misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
He let himself get rattled by missed shots, close calls and a baby's cries, and 
after his default, with a 6-1, 4-6, 7-5, 2-4 lead against Mikael Pernfors, 
McEnroe admitted, "I don't really have anyone to blame but myself." 
</P>
<P>
It was a sad and bizarre chapter in the career of one of the finest players in 
tennis, a 30-year-old former champion who came here determined to win his first 
major tournament since the 1984 U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
Only two days before, after winning his third match and playing his best tennis 
in years, McEnroe talked about how important it is for him to keep his temper 
under control. 
</P>
<P>
Yet all it took for McEnroe to revert to his old ways was a tough match against 
Pernfors, the Swedish-born two-time NCAA champion at Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe simply packed his rackets and left the court. The crowd roared its 
disapproval for another 15 minutes but left peacefully.

REPORT SAYS NCAA HAS AGREED TO SETTLEMENT WITH TARKANIAN

<TEXT>
<P>
A 13-year legal battle between Nevada Las Vegas basketball Coach Jerry 
Tarkanian and the NCAA, which went all the way to the Supreme Court, may be 
nearing an end. 
</P>
<P>
A published report said that the NCAA has agreed to a settlement that would 
call for Tarkanian paying a judgment of $21,000 and assuming his own legal fees 
-- estimated at $340,000. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Kitchin, a Kansas City lawyer who represents the NCAA, told the Las Vegas 
Review-Journal that an agreement may be near that would resolve the issue with 
the association, Tarkanian and UNLV. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution would involve only the legal battles dating back to 1977, and 
would not involve any future actions the NCAA might take, Kitchin said. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA placed UNLV on two years probation in 1977 for alleged recruiting 
violations and ordered Tarkanian suspended from coaching for two years. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV served the probation, but Tarkanian obtained a court order and continued 
coaching, compiling the winningest record among the nation's active coaches. 
</P>
<P>
The issue of his suspension went to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled in 
December 1988 that the NCAA had the right to order a coach suspended without 
due process. The same ruling said a university could not suspend a coach, 
however, without providing that due process. 
</P>
<P>
Since that ruling, the NCAA has been trying to decide what action, if any, to 
take against Tarkanian. 
</P>
<P>
Under the possible agreement with the NCAA, Tarkanian would have to accept the 
U.S. Supreme Court's reversal of legal fees -- approximately $340,000. 
</P>
<P>
Tarkanian was awarded those fees in state District Court, but lost the issue in 
the U.S. Supreme Court.

PEREZ TO DEFEND TITLE TONIGHT AT FORUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Raul Perez makes the fourth defense of his World Boxing Council bantamweight 
championship at the Forum tonight against ninth-ranked Gaby Canizales, a former 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
Perez, 5 feet 11 inches, from Tijuana, is one of the tallest bantamweight 
champions and is a textbook boxer. He will have a major height advantage over 
the 5-5 1/2 Canizales, an aggressive fighter from Laredo, Tex. This is the 
first of a planned 12 world title fights at the Forum this year. 
</P>
<P>
Perez, who earned the bantamweight title by beating Miguel Lora in Las Vegas in 
1988, is 44-1. Canizales, briefly the World Boxing Assn. champion in 1986, is 
45-6.

NEWSWIRE: HATFIELD ACCEPTS CLEMSON JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ken Hatfield of Arkansas accepted the job of football coach at Clemson Sunday, 
and a threatened player boycott was averted after he met with the team. 
</P>
<P>
Hatfield, who coached the Razorbacks for six years and led them to the Cotton 
Bowl the past two seasons, replaces Danny Ford, who resigned Thursday, less 
than two weeks after the NCAA accused Clemson of recruiting violations. 
</P>
<P>
"We understand it's a very difficult situation and time, but I promise you that 
things will work out," Hatfield said. "There's nothing that can't be 
accomplished if everybody's part of the team and you're part of something 
that's bigger than yourself." 
</P>
<P>
The 46-year-old Hatfield had a 55-17-1 record at Arkansas, guiding the 
Razorbacks to six bowl appearances in as many years. His bowl record at 
Arkansas, however, was 1-5, including Cotton Bowl losses to Tennessee (31-27 in 
1990) and UCLA (17-3 in 1989). 
</P>
<P>
The choice of Hatfield, who had a 27-31-1 record at Air Force from 1979-83, 
could have created more controversy. But after Hatfield met with the players, 
the threatened boycott for the 1990 season was called off. Saturday, players 
said that if Ford was not reinstated or an assistant wasn't promoted, they 
would sit out next season.

MICHIGAN STATE'S PERLES SAYS HE IS NEGOTIATING CONTRACT WITH JETS

Michigan State Coach George Perles apparently has been offered the Jets' 
coaching job. 
</P>
<P>
The 55-year-old Perles told a Pittsburgh television station Sunday that he's in 
the process of negotiating a contract with the Jets. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're talking to people and you're negotiating, you certainly try to 
keep as much of it to yourself as you can," Perles told WPXI-TV, Pittsburgh's 
NBC affiliate, in a brief interview at the airport. "I don't feel comfortable 
negotiating in front of the cameras. I've got some work to do on this." 
</P>
<P>
Perles, accompanied by an assistant coach, was in Pittsburgh to recruit players 
in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Jet General Manager Dick Steinberg, at the Senior Bowl Saturday, said he would 
have an announcement "real soon." 
</P>
<P>
One possible holdup is Perles' status at Michigan State. Perles is a strong 
candidate to become the athletic director.

LANE CHANGE: Even as officials take up the touchy issue of how to go back to 
the voters with a new transportation sales tax (B1), some vocal foes of last 
fall's failed tax measure are mulling their own proposal. . . . A change of 
heart? Not really. The group, Drivers for Highway Safety, fought the 1989 tax 
because some of the money would go to car-pool lanes. . . . Any proposal coming 
from the group would preclude funds for car pools and rail transit, sources 
said. Mark I. Pinsky and Steve Emmons

FOR O.C.'S TEEN HOMELESS, FEW DOORS TO KNOCK ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
They are called runaways and throwaways. 
</P>
<P>
Each year, hundreds and perhaps several thousand of these young transients, 
some not even teen-agers yet, wander the streets of Orange County -- seldom in 
large groups, and therefore mostly unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
"After I ran, I walked the beaches for about four days," said one 16-year-old 
from Anaheim. "Then someone stole all the things I was carrying with me. So I 
turned myself in to police. They had a hard time finding me a place to stay." 
</P>
<P>
The reason is painfully clear: Orange County has only five shelters with a 
total of 38 beds to care for an estimated 2,500 to 10,000 adolescents that 
child-care experts say roam county streets, alleys and beaches each year. And 
officials say the ranks of homeless adolescents are swelling, though exact 
numbers are unknown because no government or private agencies track homeless 
teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
Often called "runaways," many of the youths have actually been tossed out of 
home by their parents and are known by child-welfare workers as "throwaways." 
</P>
<P>
Typically, they are very young -- some still in grade school. The average 
Orange County runaway, according to one expert, is just 13 and was born here. 
Some are on the street only a few days. Others bounce around for weeks. They 
come from wealthy families and poor ones, too, and the reasons they are 
homeless vary as widely as their backgrounds. But they share one thing in 
common: They temporarily have no place to call home. And Orange County, despite 
its immense wealth, robust economy and population of 2.3 million, has few 
places to house them. 
</P>
<P>
"I had trouble finding a place to stay because two shelters said they were 
filled up when I tried to get in," said a 14-year-old girl who ran away from 
her family in Costa Mesa "because they were hitting me." 
</P>
<P>
The girl ultimately found a safe haven at Casa Youth Shelter in Los Alamitos. 
She was a lucky one, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
"There are only a handful of beds for teen-agers (without homes) in all of 
Orange County," said Carol Kanode, a school nurse who is spearheading a drive 
to build a shelter for teen-agers in Huntington Beach. Scheduled to open next 
summer, the shelter will add 20 new beds for homeless teen-agers -- a 52% 
increase in the current allotment of beds countywide for juveniles. 
</P>
<P>
But Kanode and others familiar with the problem said the need for shelters far 
outstrips the available beds, even with the addition of the Huntington Beach 
home. 
</P>
<P>
"Every community ought to have its own shelter for these kids," said Irene 
Briggs of the county's Child Abuse Registry. 
</P>
<P>
Only the cities of Garden Grove, Los Alamitos, Laguna Beach, Tustin and 
Fullerton have shelters that accept teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
Teens seeking temporary shelter can usually find it, but it often means they 
wind up living far from home, an arrangement experts say is counterproductive 
to repairing the youths' morale and outlook. Kanode said young people need to 
live in, or close to, their own community while living away from home, but the 
shortage of beds in Orange County makes it nearly impossible. 
</P>
<P>
To place homeless teen-agers as quickly as possible, existing shelter operators 
are in constant contact, swapping information on available space. 
</P>
<P>
"It's called the Orange County Shelter Network, and we try to keep track of how 
many beds are open," said Anne Fox, director of the Odyssey Program youth 
shelter in Fullerton. Despite such cooperative efforts, Fox acknowledges: 
"There's always more demand than supply." 
</P>
<P>
Child-care officials say that abuse, neglect and even death threats drive many 
children to risk the unknown of street life to escape the horrors of home life. 
</P>
<P>
Recent interviews with teen-agers at Casa Youth Shelter revealed, in part, why 
youths flee home. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was 7, my father punished me by driving me to Norwalk, dropping me in 
the middle of town and then leaving me there," said one 16-year-old runaway. He 
eventually found his way back to his central Orange County home, he said, but 
"I still don't know how." 
</P>
<P>
All his life, his father has terrified him. And now that he is out on his own 
again, his father has threatened to kill him if he returns home. 
</P>
<P>
Another youth, a shy, frightened-looking 17-year-old from Temecula in Riverside 
County, said he left home because he was an adopted child and his mother, who 
frequently hit him, no longer wanted him. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to be scared of her," he said. "So then I started thinking, 'I'm not 
going to let her do this to me any more.' " 
</P>
<P>
So he ran away and, through the help of friends in Orange County, found his way 
to the Los Alamitos shelter. 
</P>
<P>
Phyllis Phillips, a staff worker at Casa Youth Shelter, said the boy's tale has 
a troubling ring to it. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of these children who come here have been in danger all their lives," she 
explained. "It's only when they get older that they realize that they have to 
get away from that danger. The younger children don't know what to do." 
</P>
<P>
Cassy Tindall, assistant director of the Adam Walsh Child Resource Center in 
Westminster, said many homeless teens "come from dysfunctional homes where they 
have had physical, sexual or emotional abuse." 
</P>
<P>
She said that various pressures on teen-agers, including peer pressure and 
"mixed messages" from commercial television about how teen-agers should behave, 
sometimes overwhelm troubled youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids today face a lot of pressure, much more than most adults were exposed to 
when they grew up," Tindall said. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, cultural pressures also can lead to a family giving up on a 
child. One 14-year-old girl at Casa Youth Shelter said she was from a Cambodian 
family that had immigrated to the United States when she was an infant. 
</P>
<P>
"My family didn't want me to do things like other Americans, such as dating," 
she said. "They were always hitting me. Finally they told me to get out of the 
house." 
</P>
<P>
The Adam Walsh Child Resource Center helps locate missing children, but does 
not have its own shelter. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know how many (homeless teen-agers) there are in Orange County 
because nobody keeps track of the number," Tindall said. "But I would say there 
are thousands of teen-agers out there that are in need of temporary shelter and 
intervention." 
</P>
<P>
And many turn to crime to make money and friends, said Briggs of the county's 
Child Abuse Registry. 
</P>
<P>
"Some (newly divorced) parents with teen-aged children find they have to live 
in shabby hotels, and they end up telling the kids that they should go out on 
their own," she said. "And at 14, or even 17, kids can't make it, and what they 
do is turn to crime." 
</P>
<P>
Said one 17-year-old Santa Ana girl at the Los Alamitos shelter: "I know of 
runaways who've had to sleep under bridges and live in bushes. I lived in a 
bush myself for a while. You can see why some girls turn to prostitution. It 
gives them a warm place to spend the night." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes runaways work together. For example, in the spring of 1988, 
Huntington Beach police broke up a teen-age prostitution ring composed of 
runaway girls. The man who employed the girls, ages 14 to 17, paid them off in 
drugs, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police say they are unable to arrest runaways unless they've committed a crime, 
so the most they can do for homeless teen-agers is direct them to the few 
shelters that exist in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Los Angeles County, where Hollywood is a magnet for runaways, Orange 
County has no central strip where homeless teen-agers congregate on a permanent 
basis. However, in the summer months, many street children flock to the beach 
communities. The Huntington Beach Pier is a big draw, police say. 
</P>
<P>
But when the weather turns cold, many of the homeless youths move in with 
friends and their families. 
</P>
<P>
One 16-year-old from Buena Park said he lived away from his family for five 
years after his parents tossed him out when he was 9 years old. 
</P>
<P>
"I lived with my gang, my home boys," he remembered. His parents let him come 
home again at 14, but again ordered him from the house two years later. Now he 
is living at the Casa Youth Shelter. 
</P>
<P>
The county's five existing shelters for homeless children receive a mixture of 
federal, state and county money, but depend largely on private donations to 
remain open. 
</P>
<P>
Most shelters allow runaways to stay up to two weeks, usually enough time for 
staff to determine whether a youth and his parents can reconcile their 
differences or find the youth an alternative home. Sometimes a homeless child 
will be placed in a county-sponsored "emancipation training program" that helps 
teen-agers under 18 learn a job skill. 
</P>
<P>
County officials have long operated Orangewood Children's Home in Orange, a 
facility for abused, neglected or abandoned children of all ages. The facility 
occasionally takes in runaways, but those are usually special cases. 
</P>
<P>
William G. Steiner, executive director of the private fund-raising foundation 
for the home, said about 3,000 children a year are placed in the facility, 
which only has 166 beds. 
</P>
<P>
"Therefore we can only take runaways who are in really serious jeopardy of 
their lives," he said. "Our beds are too precious to be used (as a temporary 
shelter) in solving family problems that led to the running away." 
</P>
<P>
Steiner praised the new Huntington Beach shelter as a sorely needed facility. 
</P>
<P>
"The county certainly needs a network beyond the available number of beds, and 
any expansion of beds available is well received by those of us in the field," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Those lucky few who have experienced shelter life believe it has turned their 
lives around. 
</P>
<P>
"This place is a total trip," said the 16-year-old Anaheim boy who wandered 
along local beaches before receiving a bed at Casa Youth Shelter. "They don't 
lock you up. They give you freedom. They listen to you. They give you a warm 
place to sleep and good food. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I'm going to work to get my life together," he said. "I'm going to get a 
GED (diploma) to finish high school. And I'm going to study art. I always 
wanted to be an artist." 
</P>
<P>
Another 16-year-old boy at the shelter says he has also found new direction 
because of help from the staff. His plans do not include going home "because my 
father said he'd kill me." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to finish high school, go to a junior college and then a four-year 
college. I've always liked working with animals," he said. "I'm going to be a 
veterinarian." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
A 26-year-old water skier was fatally injured Sunday afternoon when he was run 
over by a boat that had been towing him, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Louis Michael Andreoli of Newport Beach was pronounced dead at 2:09 p.m., less 
than an hour after the boating mishap in which he suffered head injuries, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Andreoli had gone water skiing with three friends in a borrowed, 18-foot 
inboard-outboard power boat Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
He was skiing about 400 yards offshore from the main Corona del Mar beach 
Sunday afternoon when, "for some reason, he was run over by his friends," said 
Lt. Don Chandler of the Newport Beach Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Chandler said the boat was impounded and the case is under investigation. He 
refused to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. William Francis of the Orange County Sheriff's Department, which responded 
to the incident, said: "We're satisfied that it's strictly a boating accident. 
There's nothing to indicate there was anything intentional, absolutely 
nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Francis declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
Chandler said he could remember few if any fatalities like the one Sunday. And 
Sgt. Howard Mol of the Sheriff's Harbor Patrol, while recalling some serious 
jet-ski accidents, said: "This is really the first fatal water-skiing accident 
in at least four years."

PROTEST PLANNED FOR MALATHION SPRAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
North County residents are scheduled to get their fourth dose of malathion 
spray tonight, while critics of the state's expanded assault on the 
Mediterranean fruit fly prepare to step up their opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Helicopters will begin dropping hundreds of gallons of the malathion-bait 
mixture over a 26-square-mile region of northern Orange County and southern Los 
Angeles County about 9 p.m. tonight, barring rain or high winds. 
</P>
<P>
About eight square miles of Orange County, including parts of Brea, La Habra 
and Fullerton, are to be sprayed. 
</P>
<P>
Malathion critics, who question assertions that the pesticide is safe in the 
low doses being used, are planning a protest at 5:30 p.m. at the corner of Brea 
Boulevard and Imperial Highway in Brea. A similar event earlier this month drew 
about two dozen people. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, about 10 residents in the Garden Grove area organized over the 
weekend to begin mounting opposition there to the spraying. They are hoping to 
turn out at least 100 people for tonight's City Council meeting to voice their 
concern about the Medfly policy. 
</P>
<P>
The residents complain that the malathion spraying is an invasion of privacy, 
may not be safe, and "it's a waste of taxpayer money because it doesn't even 
appear to be working," said Jerry Yudelson, a state Assembly candidate who is 
helping to organize the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove gets its first malathion spraying Thursday night. It is at the 
center of a new, 36-square-mile spray area that state officials created last 
week after discovering two Medflies nearby. Parts of eight other cities, 
including about half of Westminster, will also be sprayed. 
</P>
<P>
TONIGHT'S MEDFLY SPRAYING 
</P>
<P>
A 26-square-mile region of North Orange County and Los Angeles County will be 
sprayed with a pesticide mixture tonight beginning at 9 as part of the state's 
ongoing battle against the Mediterranean fruit fly. The region includes a 
10-square-mile area that was sprayed initially on Nov.30 and twice since then. 
The entire region will be resprayed perhaps as many as a dozen times in coming 
months. ERIC LICHTBLAU

MONORAIL CLOSES FOR 2 HOURS DUE TO FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A small fire on on the Disneyland monorail track Sunday closed the train for 
about two hours but only caused minor damage and resulted in no injuries, 
according to officials at Disneyland and the Disneyland Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Goldman, a spokesman for Disneyland, said a spark from the "live," 
electrified, third rail on the monorail track near the hotel caught fire after 
passengers had already exited from the train. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel officials noticed smoke and notified Anaheim and Disneyland fire units 
shortly after 10:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Disneyland firefighters were first on the scene and extinguished the blaze 
before their Anaheim counterparts arrived. 
</P>
<P>
"There weren't any people affected," Goldman said. "This happened down the 
track from the boarding area." 
</P>
<P>
Investigators are still trying to determine the exact cause of the fire, but 
Goldman said early signs point to a spark igniting either debris or a 
fiberglass awning that sits beneath the track. A section of awning several feet 
long was damaged in the fire and will have to be replaced, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Windy conditions in and around the park Sunday afternoon could have blown 
debris onto the track, Goldman said, and that debris might have been ignited by 
a spark from the rail. 
</P>
<P>
"Like any train that runs on a live third rail, there is occasional electrical 
sparking," he said. 
</P>
<P>
There was no damage to any of the monorail train cars, and the monorail was 
back in service about 12:30 p.m. JIM NEWTON

EXPANSION PROJECT CLOSES WATERLINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
An imported-water pipeline serving 350,000 customers between Yorba Linda and 
Mission Viejo has been shut down for construction on a $60-million expansion 
project, water officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Water service to customers in nine affected water districts in east and south 
Orange County was not interrupted, but the public is being asked to halt 
outdoor watering to help ease the burden on stored water supplies, said Stan 
Sprague, general manager of the Municipal Water District of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can get a 50% cutback in water use, which would come mostly from water 
used outside the home, we'll be in great shape," Sprague said. 
</P>
<P>
Yorba Linda Water District, which serves 60,000 people, faces the worst impact 
from the shutdown because 55% of its water supply comes from the pipeline, 
district spokesman Mike Robinson said. To remedy the situation, a temporary 
waterline has been hooked up to neighborhoods in east Yorba Linda and the 
district's reservoirs are now full, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Other areas depending solely on the pipeline are the Los Alisos Water District 
in the Lake Forest area, El Toro Water District, Moulton-Niguel Water District 
in Laguna Hills, and Laguna Niguel and Santa Margarita Water District in 
Mission Viejo and Rancho Santa Margarita. Sprague said these districts would 
receive water piped in from other areas. 
</P>
<P>
The construction project, scheduled for completion Jan. 30, kicked off an 
expansion of the 32-mile Allen-McColloch pipeline that links the Metropolitan 
Water District's Dima Filtration Plant with waterlines in South Orange County. 
By installing a 66-inch-diameter line to parallel an existing 84-inch-wide 
line, more water can be pumped to these districts, Sprague said. 
</P>
<P>
The project also includes a three-mile extension of the pipeline to water 
districts serving San Juan Capistrano and San Clemente. WENDY PAULSON

After a lengthy dispute with area residents, Alloy Die Casting has been granted 
permission to build a $4-million building at 6560 Caballero Ave. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Donald L. Bone praised Alloy representatives and residents of the nearby 
Poet housing development for reaching compromises involving building height, 
landscaping and operating hours. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very proud of the way this situation has been handled by all parties," 
Bone said. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, Alloy wanted the warehouse height to be 32 feet, 5 inches, but 
agreed to reduce the height to 30 feet, 3 inches. Alloy also agreed to set the 
building eight feet back from the rear property line and surround the 
70,000-square-foot building with trees.

Construction is expected to begin this spring. DEBORAH L. CARPENTIER

HOTEL MARKS SIX DECADES OF HISTORY

Humphrey Bogart, Errol Flynn and Charles A. Lindbergh are among the luminaries 
who dined and drank there while gazing at picture-perfect ocean sunsets. The 
guest book bears the signatures of Myrna Loy, Faye Wray and Prince Theodore of 
Russia. 
</P>
<P>
The Hotel Laguna, the city's most significant historical landmark, celebrates 
its 60th anniversary this year. The distinctive, Spanish-style building has 
enjoyed a colorful past that has been documented by its current owners, Claes 
and Georgia Andersen. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of things have happened here," said Claes Andersen. "If only the walls 
could talk." 
</P>
<P>
Andersen, 43, came to America from Denmark in 1969. His plans were to ski and 
work as a chef for six months. Instead, he stayed and ended up buying the Hotel 
Laguna in 1985. Since then, the Andersens have researched the history of the 
68-room hotel, which dates back more than 100 years to when the first inn 
opened in Laguna Beach. At that time, the city was an isolated seaside resort 
with a year-round population of fewer than a dozen people. 
</P>
<P>
Historical records differ on exact dates, but according to the Andersens, Henry 
Goff built the first hotel on the site at 425 S. Coast Highway in 1888. The 
inn, then called Alpha Hotel, was expanded when Goff moved another building to 
the property. But in the early 1890s, an economic depression led to collapse of 
the travel boom and land values plummeted. The hotel was sold and deserted by 
all but squirrels, rats and polecats for a couple of years, the Andersens said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1895, Joseph Yoch purchased the hotel's mortgage for $600 and reopened what 
was then a 14-bedroom inn. Two years later, he expanded by combining his hotel 
with the Arch Beach Hotel, a deserted structure that he moved from Diamond 
Street in South Laguna. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-room "New Hotel Laguna," now the largest building in town, was the 
center of community life and a popular "Gay '90s" resort where guests such as 
Madame Modjeska and "life-of-the-party" James Irvine walked the halls, the 
Andersens said. 
</P>
<P>
By the 1920s, Laguna Beach was an established art colony and growing rapidly. 
In the midst of a building boom, the hotel, which had changed hands several 
times, was condemned as a fire hazard and razed. 
</P>
<P>
Today's Hotel Laguna, a white Early California Mission-style three-story 
building with Spanish arches and bell tower, opened in 1930. But the hotel 
struggled until new owners Lloyd and Gerta Seilset began a promotional campaign 
aimed at attracting guests from the motion picture industry. 
</P>
<P>
"The price of lodging was so low compared to other film locations and the 
Laguna terrain was so varied and adaptable to movie-making, that the film 
makers arrived in droves and the hotel was in the black again in no time," said 
a city report. 
</P>
<P>
From then through the 1950s, famous people such as Lauren Bacall, John 
Barrymore, Joan Fontaine and Rosalind Russell patronized the hotel's Pier Nine 
Bar. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the center of town," said Andersen. "All the civic organizations met 
here, and a lot of people stopped on their way from Los Angeles to the Del Mar 
race track. It was the in place for movie people." 
</P>
<P>
Today, the hotel with its old photograph-lined halls and panoramic views caters 
to local sunset worshipers, corporate meetings, weddings and summer tourists. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people were upset that we wanted to remodel," Andersen said of the 
$2.5-million renovation that has taken place since 1985. "But we had no 
intention of making a modern hotel. We went through all the historical records 
before we made any plans." LESLIE HERZOG

THE SINS OF SANTA ANA MAKE MISERABLE EXISTENCE HELLISH; 
</P>
<P>
CITY OFFICIALS' SYSTEMATIC CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE LESS FORTUNATE IS BECOMING 
BRUTAL AND UGLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Not to start on a downer, but in a hundred years everybody reading this will be 
someplace else. 
</P>
<P>
Almost every religion on earth has picturesque ideas about that Someplace, the 
consensus being that it has two or more levels, like a parking garage. The 
lower levels, we are taught, are for those who have failed to leave the world a 
little better than they found it. The Christian hell is a kind of eternal 
rotisserie; Asian hells are even worse. Those who believe in reincarnation had 
better not be right, or the council members and top administrators of Santa Ana 
will come back as termites, and we have enough of those already. 
</P>
<P>
The city fathers, the majority of whom are professing Christians, began a 
systematic oppression of the poor and homeless on or about June 6 in the year 
of Our Lord, 1988. The idea was to make the lives of the miserable even more 
miserable and thereby drive them away. The more pious surely know that the poor 
are to be cared for, not kicked around, and that the meek, not the termites, 
are meant to inherit the earth. Those who take Gospel as gospel will have read 
far enough into Matthew to know that Christ himself was homeless. 
</P>
<P>
God may reign but the majority rules. The city's campaign against the homeless 
and those who feed them blunders on. It hasn't got rid of the poor and 
shelterless; they are increasing. Also increasing is the number of Santa Ana 
park workers, street sweepers and police officers who have become heartily sick 
of their jobs. They are incorporated to do the dirty work, the rousting, the 
arresting, the trashing of bedrolls and the dispossessing of the already 
dispossessed. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana police fought shy of this effort until last May, when they conducted 
a business-like raid on street people at 3rd and Garfield streets, tidying up a 
corner whose landmark attraction is a junkyard. Since then police have 
campaigned against Santa Ana's homeless all the way from the river to the rail 
yards, rousting them and threatening them, citing them for drinking or 
loitering, and checking them for outstanding warrants. The smarter officers 
consider this an empty challenge. But it has become disquietingly clear to the 
department that some of its cops love dirty work. 
</P>
<P>
With the jail full, these officers face an ugly temptation to administer 
justice on the spot. At least two officers appear to have succumbed to it, and 
the city's war on poverty has turned brutal and raw. 
</P>
<P>
According to a claim filed, on the night of Oct. 16, in Civic Center Mall, one 
cop felt compelled to slug and wrestle down an inoffensive black man while four 
other cops stood by. The victim took his bruised ribs and bulging eye to a 
lawyer, and the names of principals involved are now a matter of public record. 
The city says the Police Department is still investigating. 
</P>
<P>
And on Nov. 22, according to a number of witnesses, another officer scattered a 
group of homeless and announced in a voice audible to most of east Santa Ana 
that he hated "niggers and Mexicans." The secular shrink might wonder if the 
cop also hates his family, his job and himself. The theologian might wonder 
about his state of grace, especially after what appears to have happened the 
afternoon of Nov. 26. 
</P>
<P>
This same officer (his superiors have his name and badge number) was cruising 
the lumberyard near the Amtrak station looking for targets. The person he found 
is well-known around Santa Ana as one of the city's most piteous poor. She is 
ragged and unwashed, has been homeless as long as she can remember, and she 
drags her lame right leg behind her as she forages trash cans for food. She is 
undersized and undernourished and drinks beer to kill her pains and lubricate a 
dreadful existence. 
</P>
<P>
I know her well, this lady. She has a number of aggravating habits, but 
fantasizing isn't one of them, and I'm afraid I believe her when she says this 
officer seized her and cracked her head against a lumber pile and bore her to 
the ground, leaving her with the left side of her face fractured, a blackened 
left eye and a citation for drinking in public. The officer admits a scuffle 
but claims the woman "took an aggressive stance." 
</P>
<P>
He was good enough to sign his name to the ticket, and because two experienced 
lawyers also believe the woman's story, he will have the chance to explain his 
techniques in court. 
</P>
<P>
You'll remember we started all this with Apocalyptic musings about the 
hereafter, and we may as well end that way. By tradition and testament, the 
deal is that we can help ourselves into heaven by prayer, and can even help 
others if we feel they're not going to make it. Consider then an armed and 
uniformed cop who beats up a crippled female half his size while his partner 
watches. That is not going to make points with whatever archangel keeps score. 
If we can keep this chap off the down escalator with intercessional prayer, 
we'd better get at it. He needs all the help he can get. 
</P>
<P>
Save your prayers for those who beat and abuse, not this one tattered victim. 
After what she's been through on Earth, she's got eternity locked up. Like the 
beggar Lazarus, she'll sleep in the bosom of Abraham.

LET'S PLAY BY THE RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If American diplomats in any part of the world were detained by foreign 
soldiers, the U.S. government would howl in protest -- and rightly so. So why 
is the Bush Administration letting U.S. troops in Panama do just that to 
diplomats there? 
</P>
<P>
Granted, most of the diplomats who have had run-ins with U.S. soldiers come 
from countries that are less than friendly, like Cuba, Libya and Nicaragua. But 
others represent parties with whom we are on good terms, like the Vatican, or 
countries with whom we should be trying to repair relations in the aftermath of 
the Panama invasion, like Peru. 
</P>
<P>
And while some incidents have stemmed from legitimate military concerns, such 
as searching for hidden weapons, others seem to represent little more than 
bullying. Why is Peru's embassy in Panama City, for example, surrounded by 
heavily armed U.S. troops, sandbags and concertina wire? The official 
explanation is that the armed troops, the sandbags and the wire are aimed at 
intercepting pro-Noriega fugitives trying to get in or out. But it would be a 
lot better all around to assign a detachment of Panamanian police, similar to 
those stationed at Nicaragua's embassy after flare-ups between U.S. troops and 
Sandinista diplomats. Why look for trouble? 
</P>
<P>
The 1961 Vienna Convention guarantees immunity of all diplomatic personnel and 
property. U.S. soldiers in Panama, concerned with military rather than 
diplomatic problems, probably find such rules bothersome. But those rules 
helped U.S. diplomats in many a tense situation, and are likely to be used 
again. This nation has interests all over the world, so the last thing we 
should do is set precedents that could come back to haunt us. The heavy-handed 
tactics used by some American troops in Panama may be doing just that.

AILING ESPERANZA ISN'T LIMPING ON SOCCER FIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Three years ago, when John Coppage left the Esperanza High School boys' soccer 
team to coach the girls, he took over a young, lackadaisical program and 
quickly turned it into a winner. 
</P>
<P>
In his first year, Coppage, a walk-on coach, led the Aztecs to the Southern 
Section 3-A final and a 22-2-2 overall record. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Esperanza finished with a 24-0-2 record, but was eliminated by Simi 
Valley, on penalty kicks, in the 4-A semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Esperanza (18-2-1 overall, 4-0-1 in the Empire League) continues to 
win, despite being plagued by illness and injury through most of the early 
season. Along with a team-shared flu, the Aztecs have been struck with 
everything from back injuries (Chrissy Coppage and goalkeeper Tymerie Busser) 
to a heart murmur (Jenise Webb). 
</P>
<P>
"All the luck I've had as far as not having injuries in years past (is gone)," 
Coppage said. "It's incredible, you don't even want to say it. It's like, well, 
what's gonna happen Monday?" 
</P>
<P>
But few coaches are feeling sorry for Coppage, who was 109-6-10 in four years 
as the Aztecs' boys' coach, leading Esperanza to four Empire League titles and 
the 3-A title in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Although the team's two losses -- to Mater Dei and Mission Viejo -- are two 
more than it had last year, and it has allowed more goals (10) than it did all 
of last year (seven), Esperanza is looking good elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Balanced scoring has helped Esperanza score 71 goals this season -- nine more 
than at this point last year. All but one of the team's 18 players, excluding 
the goalkeeper, have scored. 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza's talent is based on its core of 13 seniors -- the same players 
Coppage referred to as a bunch of squirrels three years ago -- but the team's 
underclassmen have provided a boost as well. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the injuries we had, actually we're stronger than we were last 
year," Coppage said. "We have more depth than last year because with so many 
injuries we were forced to play freshmen." 
</P>
<P>
The freshmen are Megan Murray, younger sister of junior Lynn Murray, and Kathy 
Haerle. 
</P>
<P>
"Kathy is 5 feet tall and weighs probably about 105," Coppage said. "I call her 
a Smurf but she's really more like a bulldog. She's scored two goals this year, 
that's unheard of for a freshman. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I'm telling you, it's a riot. The one thing that really turned this team 
around were these two freshman because all these other hot shots (seniors) saw 
them and said, 'Gee, they're out there hustling and making their way onto the 
varsity. We'd better do something.' " 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza, which plays at Loara Thursday, began the season as the third-ranked 
team in the preseason Southern Section 4-A poll. A week later, it moved to 
second where it stayed until today. After last week's 1-1 tie with league rival 
Los Alamitos, ranked 10th in the poll, Esperanza dropped to fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley is ranked No. 1, Upland is second and Arcadia is third. 
</P>
<P>
Coppage, who is not shy with his opinions, was not pleased. 
</P>
<P>
"We already beat Arcadia (in the Ocean View tournament). . . . Now two top 10 
teams play and tie and what does that mean?" Coppage said. "What a joke. I 
think the whole top 10 thing is a farce. It's not a top 10 soccer poll; it's a 
top 10 popularity poll." 
</P>
<P>
Jan Lipinski, the 4-A coordinator who puts out the weekly rankings, said one 
representative from each of the 4-A's nine leagues vote on the rankings. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all that, Coppage, who has a career record of 145-12-14 through seven 
years of coaching high school soccer, is assured of his team's capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
"Without a doubt, we have the best team, the best talent in (the 4-A)," he 
said. "But that doesn't necessarily mean we're gonna win. But the only team 
that can beat us is ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Rounding out the 4-A poll are No. 5 Dana Hills, No. 6 El Toro, No. 7 South 
Torrance, No. 8 Corona del Mar, No. 9 Mission Viejo and No. 10 Edison. 
</P>
<P>
The Five Counties Invitational wrestling tournament at Fountain Valley High 
School received plenty of praise by many area coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend's tournament packed the gymnasium with about 2,000 fans who got to 
see the most highly contested meet in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a real great preview for the state meet (March 2-3 at Stockton)," El 
Modena Coach Alan Clinton said. "You had almost all the sections (of the 
California Interscholastic Federation) there." 
</P>
<P>
Clovis, the top-ranked team in the state, won with 151 points. Canyon, the 
third-ranked team in the state and the tournament's defending champion, was 
sixth with 108.5. 
</P>
<P>
Clinton, president of the Orange County Wrestling Coaches Assn., released this 
week's county poll: No. 1 Canyon, No. 2 El Modena, No. 3 Valencia, No. 4 Laguna 
Hills, No. 5 Irvine, No. 6 San Clemente, No. 7 El Dorado, No. 8 Mater Dei, No. 
9 Savanna and No. 10 Buena Park. 
</P>
<P>
Out go the lights: The Marina-Fountain Valley girls' basketball game had to be 
postponed Tuesday after the lights in the Marina gymnasium went out minutes 
into the game. 
</P>
<P>
The cause? Marina junior Colleen Hatch was chasing a loose ball down the 
baseline when she hit a padded fuse box on the wall. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a total freak thing," Marina Coach Pete Bonny said. "We could do it 100 
times and it wouldn't happen again. She hit it, there were a couple sparks and 
all of a sudden we were all in the dark." 
</P>
<P>
After much debate, the game was postponed. It will continue -- with Fountain 
Valley leading, 4-0, tonight at 5 at Marina. 
</P>
<P>
Marina is 13-7 overall, 2-2 in the Sunset League. Fountain Valley is 14-5, 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
Big 8 Recruit: Tim Manning, Trabuco Hills' all-everything football player, took 
a recruiting trip to Iowa State last weekend. There, Manning was hosted, in 
part, by Blaise Bryant, one of the nation's leaders in all-purpose offense last 
fall, and a former Golden West College player. 
</P>
<P>
Lights, camera . . . Rainer Wulf, Trabuco Hills boys' basketball coach, has 
been seen on television recently. Wulf twice has hosted the halftime and 
postgame shows for KDOC (Channel 56) during Nevada Las Vegas home basketball 
games. 
</P>
<P>
"I did the UCI game (last Thursday)," Wulf said. "We watch the game in the 
studio (in Anaheim), then we pick out highlights from both halves, talk about 
the game, show the highlights, and then we have trivia questions and take phone 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a lot of (Trabuco Hills) players threaten to call in and ask me a tough 
question. It's a live show. If you screw up, you screw up." 
</P>
<P>
Wulf had worked with the program's director, Paul Higgins, on past projects. 
</P>
<P>
Wulf, who played at UC Irvine from 1980-82, got his start in television with a 
beer commercial five years ago. He played a player being chewed out by UCLA 
Coach Jim Harrick, then at Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
"It was fun," Wulf said. "They paid us $80 an hour." 
</P>
<P>
Justin Zayas, a 5-foot-6 junior fullback for Orange, returned from Indiana this 
season and has boosted the Panthers' defense significantly. 
</P>
<P>
Orange, 12-0-2 overall and the second-ranked 2-A team in the Southern Section, 
leads the Pacific Coast League with a 9-0 record. 
</P>
<P>
Zayas was an all-league selection as a freshman before the family moved to 
Indiana. Zayas wasn't doing well in school, said Orange Coach Ed Carrillo, so 
the Zayas family moved back to Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Last season without Zayas, the Panthers were 9-11-3. 
</P>
<P>
Said Carrillo: "He's so quick, they (the forwards) can push harder and not 
worry so much because he's back there. In fact, I think we depend on him too 
much."

WALKER HAS A JUMP ON HER OPPONENTS; 
</P>
<P>
GIRLS' BASKETBALL: FRESHMAN'S TURNAROUND SHOT HAS HELPED HUNTINGTON BEACH 
BECOME A CONTENDER IN THE SUNSET LEAGUE.

HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Clare Walker is only a freshman at Huntington Beach High School, but already 
she is making a name for herself as one of Orange County's best young jump 
shooters. 
</P>
<P>
Walker, 14, doesn't shoot just any jump shot. She shoots the turnaround -- one 
of the harder skills for a girls' basketball player to master. 
</P>
<P>
And for Walker, who has asthma, the jump shot is just what the doctor ordered. 
</P>
<P>
"(Asthma) can be something you're allergic to or something you just suddenly 
smell or, if you're nervous about something it can come on and you just get 
really tense and your lungs just shrink," Walker said. "The doctors encouraged 
me to play basketball and swim because they helped open my lungs. They said get 
as much exercise as you can." 
</P>
<P>
Before she and her family learned the right mix of medication to handle her 
asthma, Walker had attacks so severe that she ended up in a hospital, once with 
double pneumonia and three times to receive intravenous muscle relaxers, her 
father, Paul Walker, said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, she is fine as long as she takes her medication regularly. She also 
carries a small pump with her to every game in case she has an attack. 
</P>
<P>
But don't think of Walker as a delicate, wheezing, sickly little girl because 
she has asthma. 
</P>
<P>
At 5-feet-9, 150 pounds, Walker is hale, not frail. 
</P>
<P>
"She is not a little frail girl out there," Marina Coach Pete Bonny said. "She 
has a good basketball body. She is solidly built and pretty strong for a 
freshman." 
</P>
<P>
It is that strength that helps her with the turnaround jump shot. 
</P>
<P>
Walker does not believe her ability to shoot the turnaround jumper with good 
height and from beyond 15 feet is rare in county girls' basketball, even for a 
freshman. "People have commented about it, but I see other girls doing it," 
said Walker, who began playing organized basketball as a sixth-grader with The 
Untouchables, a Fountain Valley recreation team. 
</P>
<P>
Those other girls? Members of The Blazers, Walker's eighth-grade Downey-based 
Amateur Athletic Union team. It was Blazer Coach Laurie Woerful who got Walker 
started on the turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
Walker's shot has helped her lead Huntington Beach in scoring, averaging 12 
points a game. She also averages six rebounds a game. No small feat considering 
she never plays more than three quarters. Huntington Beach Coach Nick Bartlett 
spreads the playing time among 10 players. 
</P>
<P>
"I look at my team and say I've got a starting 10," Bartlett said. "It is real 
unusual. I have 10 what I think are really good players. 
</P>
<P>
"It really depends upon the defense I think (opponents) are going to be playing 
against us as to the players I am going to be playing in a game. But obviously 
to get points on the board I have got to get Clare and (senior) Jana Davis in 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Bartlett was impressed enough with Walker's talent to tab her as one of the 
best freshmen in the state. That might be too big a jump even for Walker, but 
she certainly has established herself as one of the county's best, along with 
Olivia DiCamille of Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
And she has been making an impression in the Sunset League where the Oilers, 
the league doormat along with Westminster the past couple of years, are 8-10 
overall, 2-3 in league play and competing for a playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
In a Sunset League upset of Edison, Walker scored a team-high 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
She had only an average game in a loss to Marina but Viking Coach Bonny took 
note. "I'm not sold on her being the best freshman in the state," he said. "She 
has never gone to her left in her life. But I'm sure that will change. She is 
going to be around for three years and that is scary." 
</P>
<P>
Though the Oilers lost to Ocean View, one of the county's top three teams, 
Walker showed her potential with 17 points. And she wasn't afraid to challenge 
Ocean View's 6-2 center Jennifer Sullivan, the Sunset League's most valuable 
player as a junior last season. 
</P>
<P>
"She made a couple of shots over Sullivan," Bartlett said. 
</P>
<P>
Walker can challenge taller player because she gets good height on her jump 
shot and she has a quick release. "She has a terrific jump shot and good range 
from about 17 to 18 feet," Ocean View Coach Ollie Martin said. "And it is very 
hard to block, she shoots the ball very high. She is going to become a real 
good rebounder. The thing that will determine it all with her is her basketball 
desire." 
</P>
<P>
Walker has the desire and more. 
</P>
<P>
"She is very mature for her age," Bartlett said. "She is extremely easy to work 
with. If you tell her to do something, she does it. She is a coaches' dream. Of 
course her family is very supportive of her in sports."

Her father, an engineer, laid a slab of cement and put up a hoop in the 
backyard at Walker's request. They are both modest about their one-on-one 
contests: "He could probably whip me in two seconds, but he plays it close," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Walker said: "Well that's what I try to make her believe." 
</P>
<P>
Walker's parents attend her games and videotape the action for the team. "They 
encourage me," Walker said. "They tell me what I could do better and they are 
just always there for me and just always helping me out."

POP WEEKEND;

LISA LISA: BY THE END, SHE WAS EXTORTING APPLAUSE BY SAYING SHE WOULD CALL IT A

Lisa Velez figured that lasting six years on the pop-R&amp;B scene was a 
milestone worth noting during a pause in her show Friday night at the Celebrity 
Theatre. Judging from the blandness of her hour's work, becoming a seasoned 
trouper has taken some of the spice out of Lisa Lisa's once-peppery stage 
persona. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Lisa &amp; Cult Jam has some of the stuff it takes to keep things fresh, 
with its blend of hip-hop beats, Latin rhythmic accents and rock-style guitar 
all folded into a polished urban pop package. The New York group presented the 
package proficiently enough, but it didn't contain much sass or personality. 
</P>
<P>
The tiny, cutely chunky Lisa Lisa has played the role of an emphatic young 
woman determined to hold on to her independence in romantic relationships, 
while still keeping a soft spot open for a lover who would be respectful and 
true. 
</P>
<P>
But, artistically at least, Velez doesn't have much independence. Her music is 
crafted by the New York songwriting-record producing team known as Full Force. 
And while the best of the songs that Full Force gives Velez feature catchy, 
hit-making hooks, the Lisa Lisa repertoire is generic pop product that doesn't 
form much of a basis for her to communicate a story or an identity of her own. 
On stage at the Celebrity, Lisa Lisa hardly even tried. 
</P>
<P>
The smoothly tuneful funk hits, "Head to Toe" and "I Wonder if I Take You 
Home," and the bouncy pop fluff of "Little Jackie Wants to Be a Star" were 
pleasant enough diversions. An attempt at a rap-dance workout was the flattest 
number, with Velez and most of the rest of her ensemble (except for 
percussionist Mike Hughes) proving to be unremarkable dancers. 
</P>
<P>
Velez, originally one of those thin-voiced Madonna clones, has improved her 
singing over the years, but she still doesn't have anything approaching the 
range or authority to elevate routine material on vocal power alone. 
</P>
<P>
With nothing much to say with their music, Lisa Lisa &amp; Cult Jam (Velez's 
regular sidekicks, Hughes and guitarist Alex "Spanador" Mosely, were joined by 
six other singers and players) spent an inordinate amount of time trying to 
stroke the crowd or cajole applause. 
</P>
<P>
By the end, Lisa Lisa had turned downright schoolmarmish, extorting applause by 
saying she would call it a night unless the crowd made her feel sufficiently 
welcome to continue. After singing a brisk "Head to Toe" as their reward, Velez 
ended with another teacher-like command: "Everybody say good night to Lisa." 
</P>
<P>
By that time, many in an audience that was definitely not interested in an 
encore had already bid a tacit adieu by heading for the exits.

A 'TWELFTH NIGHT' IN GARDEN GROVE SHORT ON VISION

<P>
Last summer in West Germany, where the director is king, a West Berlin theater 
was presenting Shakespeare's "Twelfth Night" under its subtitle, "What You 
Will," the ideal command for a director to let his imagination go. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind that Shakespeare inserts a cautionary aside (in the mouth of a 
servant), as the once contained, puritanical Malvolio now fantasizes himself as 
a count in love with countess Olivia -- "O peace, now he's deeply in; look how 
imagination blows him." Imagination is the prime natural resource of Illyria, 
this romantic comedy's Mediterranean utopia. It makes fertile soil for love to 
grow: "Twelfth Night" is about how make-believe is an act of the heart. 
</P>
<P>
Directors fond of Shakespeare tend to be especially fond of a play, such as 
this one, in which one can essentially invent a world. So it isn't surprising 
that veteran Shakespeare director Thomas F. Bradac mentions the subtitle in the 
program notes for his new Grove Shakespeare Festival production of "Twelfth 
Night." He comments on a world "where reality and illusion are confused . . . 
our production establishes the stage as Illyria, whose inhabitants (actors) and 
devices of illusion are evident." 
</P>
<P>
Tony Maggi's set, stripped down to a multilevel platform stage with narrow, 
chiffon curtains that can become ship's sails or garden hedges, also makes 
visible a costume change area on both sides of the stage. We'll see the actors 
come on, prepare for their roles, enter Illyria in costume, then exit. Shades 
of Paul Verdier's "1789," itself an offspring of Theatre du Soleil's theater 
without walls. 
</P>
<P>
That is, that's what we assume we'll see. The reality of Bradac's stab at 
exposing theatrical illusions is actually somewhat grim. The ideas on stage are 
not backing up the ideas in the notes. 
</P>
<P>
After the cast -- led by Gary Bell as Feste, the court jester -- presents a 
friendly introduction of the characters, they get off and let the show begin to 
the sound of shaking metal sheets for thunder, Liz Stillwell's pulsating lights 
and actors waving those chiffon curtains back and forth. Bradac even reverses 
the order of the first two scenes, cutting to the chase, so to speak. There 
seems to be a point of view going on here. 
</P>
<P>
Then things settle down, and before long, it's a night of perfectly competent, 
perfectly average American Shakespeare. The changing areas to the sides go 
virtually unused, becoming emblematic of Bradac's production as a whole. 
Stylistic notions, given the barest suggestion, become more frustrating when 
they're prevented from going the full distance. The people in Illyria, so 
hell-bent on making things up and changing clothes as the situation dictates, 
would never put up with such half-hearted leaps -- no, hops -- of imagination. 
</P>
<P>
Somewhere along the way, the urge to enchant lost steam; the resultant mise en 
scene, like Laura Deremer's maddeningly inconsistent costuming, looks clunky. 
The actors enter and exit through upstage door openings as if they're in a 
stylized office-warehouse. Once in a while, they're asked to freeze in tableau 
for no apparent reason, and, again, with no consistent pattern. Even Chuck 
Estes' music sounds half-done. 
</P>
<P>
But since this is an evening of competent American Shakespeare, the lead actors 
emit a good deal of charm. And intelligence, in the cases of Bell's Feste, who 
suggests a savant moonlighting as a clown for the money, and John-Frederick 
Jones' Malvolio, the show's most shaded performance. Right behind them, in 
various forms of nonsense and romance, are Steve Henry's Toby Belch, Steve 
Peterson's Andrew Aguecheek and Kerry Noonan's Viola. Alicia Woolerton begins 
her Olivia very mechanically, but then loosens up. Carl Reggiardo gives another 
of his grim-faced, stentorian turns as the love-lorn Duke, while Marc 
Whitmore's put-upon Antonio is just grim-faced. 
</P>
<P>
These actors, by themselves, can't send us on a magic carpet ride. They need a 
strong vision to give them a boost. This time out, there's a power failure. 
</P>
<P>
 At 12852 Main St., Garden Grove, on Wednesdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m.; 
Saturday and Feb. 3, 7:30 p.m.; Feb. 11, 3 p.m. Through Feb. 17. Tickets: $16

SCR PLANS READING OF WORK BY ONCE-BANNED SOVIET PLAYWRIGHT 
</P>

<P>
Government disapproval brings its own reward, particularly for writers. Ask 
Vaclav Havel. Well, don't bother -- everybody knows about the dissident 
playwright turned Czech leader. Ask Alexander Buravsky. 
</P>
<P>
When he started writing plays in 1980, the Soviet Ministry of Culture banned 
his works. Then along came perestroika. Political maverick Boris N. Yeltsin 
allowed a production, and Buravsky found himself the toast of Moscow with a hit 
play called "Speak Out." 
</P>
<P>
As the lanky, soft-spoken playwright recounted his breakthrough, an ironic 
smile flickered on his lips. "The fact that my plays were forbidden for many 
years gave me some kind of advertising," he said in university-trained English. 
"That is how I could push them very fast on the stage." 
</P>
<P>
Fast indeed. Following "Speak Out" in 1986, a political drama set around the 
time of Stalin's death in 1953, five more of his plays reached production over 
the next two years alone: "Tinfoil Stars," "Under the Table," "The Guest 
House," "We Play for Money" and "Liberty: Year Two." All had movie stars in 
them. All were mounted at elegant Moscow theaters. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the 37-year-old Buravsky has seen his plays translated and staged 
across Europe -- in Poland, West Germany and France. Now he hopes to launch a 
career in the United States with his seventh and most recent play, "The Russian 
Teacher," which will receive a New-SCRipt reading tonight at South Coast 
Repertory in an English adaptation by Keith Reddin. 
</P>
<P>
The original version, which opens Tuesday in Moscow (Story, F16), came to the 
attention of SCR's David Emmes last April on a trip to the Soviet Union, where 
he saw it in rehearsal. 
</P>
<P>
"Before this one, I wrote about the French revolution," Buravsky said, 
referring to "Liberty: Year Two" (given a reading Dec. 20 in Los Angeles as 
part of the Mark Taper Forum's "New Work Festival '89"). "It was very serious. 
Tragedy. Bloodshed. Robespierre. Danton. And so on. I decided, that's enough. I 
want to be funny, but at the same time not to be stupid. It was a kind of 
challenge to speak of serious things in a funny way." 
</P>
<P>
The idea for "The Russian Teacher" struck him while he was pondering the 
contradictions of a society in which no private property is allowed because the 
state owns everything, yet its citizens busily commandeer what they need for 
all sorts of commercial enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
"If you are on a Moscow street, for example, it is very difficult to get a 
taxi," Buravsky explained. "So when you are waiting with your hand raised, 
suddenly a black limousine will come to a stop and take you. It is not a taxi. 
It belongs to the Communist Party or the Central Committee or a government 
ministry. The chauffeur has nothing to do all day. He brings a bureaucrat to 
the office and takes him home. In between, the limousine is his private 
property. You give him money and he takes you." 
</P>
<P>
Buravsky recalled riding as a passenger in one of these gypsy cabs when it was 
flagged down for speeding. Without any prompting from the chauffeur, the 
playwright surprised even himself by suddenly becoming an impostor. He played a 
party official on his way to an important meeting, which achieved the desired 
effect. "We went free," Buravsky said. 
</P>
<P>
But he also got to wondering what role he might have taken had the limousine 
been a prison van. Would he have played someone on his way to jail, perhaps an 
arrested politician? And that led him to imagine a more bizarre situation. 
</P>
<P>
What if he were a surgeon in a hospital on the Black Sea, a luxurious resort 
area where accommodations are difficult to find during the height of the 
vacation season? What if this surgeon were to take advantage of the room 
shortage and rent out the beds in the orthopedic ward of the hospital as though 
it were a hotel? What if the people who check in, among them a Russian teacher, 
suddenly had to play the roles of patients with broken arms and legs because of 
an imminent inspection? 
</P>
<P>
"It was just my fantasy," Buravsky said. "I don't use symbolic phrases to say 
our Socialist country is this way. But there is a subtext that we are locked 
(in a ward) and we are forced to play roles different from who we are." 
</P>
<P>
In a society where professions are decided early, the Jewish, Moscow-born 
playwright believed until the age of 14 that he would be a cellist like his 
grandfather, Isaak Buravsky, a renowned Soviet musician. But after studying 
cello for 10 years at the Moscow Central School for gifted children, Buravsky 
made a discovery: "I wanted to read words in my books, not only notes." 
</P>
<P>
Shifting to language studies in high school, he went on to Moscow University 
and graduated with a journalism degree in 1975, he said. For several years he 
worked at Soviet Screen magazine as a feature writer. Eventually, he began 
turning out unproduced play scripts. 
</P>
<P>
"There were many people who wanted to use what I wrote before perestroika," 
Buravsky recalled. "Even in the Ministry of Culture there were people who 
wanted to help me. But they wanted me to rewrite, rewrite, rewrite, to go 
through the censorship. 
</P>
<P>
"My editor, a very kind woman, used to say to me: 'I'm helping you. Why don't 
you help me?' I tried. I'm not so strong that I refused altogether. I wanted to 
see my plays on the stage. But I couldn't. So I earned my living not only as a 
journalist. I wrote for comedians." 
</P>
<P>
Getting nowhere with his plays, Buravsky managed to shift course once again. In 
1984 he gained admission to the Soviet Union's sole graduate school for film 
makers and screenwriters, where only a dozen or so applicants are accepted each 
year. On graduation, he said, their future in the movie industry is virtually 
assured. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Buravsky already has four produced movies: "Down Main Street With an 
Orchestra," "The Amateurs," "Freedom Is Paradise," and "The Gambler," which he 
co-directed and is still in post-production. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the glamour of the movie world, theater remains his first love. To 
write screenplays, he said, "is to work as a professional. But to write plays 
is to be an artist." 
</P>
<P>
"With movies I feel I am serving a huge team of people," Buravsky explained. 
"Everyone is always in a hurry (because) movies are expensive to make. Or maybe 
it rains. Your character needs a raincoat. That means a bad mood. You must 
rewrite for the director, for the cameraman and so on. 
</P>
<P>
"But with a play I feel I am serving myself." 
</P>
<P>
 A staged reading of "The Russian Teacher," a satiric comedy about perestroika 
by Alexander Buravsky, will be given at 7:30 p.m. at South Coast Repertory, 655 
Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. Tickets: $6. Information: (714) 957-4033.

LONDON EVENT SHOWS ALL IN GOOD MIME 
</P>

<P>
Toby Sedgwick has been lying on a London stage pretending to be a slice of 
bacon, sizzling in a pan. 
</P>
<P>
As he twists and turns, the room is filled with the smell of frying bacon -- at 
least to the noses of many of those watching. 
</P>
<P>
Sedgwick is a mime artist, and some of the world's best are performing in the 
12th London Mime Festival, the oldest event of its kind. 
</P>
<P>
During the two-week festival, the mimes are performing in theaters, concert 
halls, local community arts centers, universities, even a library, in London 
and in towns across England. 
</P>
<P>
"We have probably presented every major mime in the world," festival director 
Joseph Seelig claimed in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Mime is entertainment without words, a form of theater practiced by the ancient 
Greeks and Romans. Seelig called it "the art of creating illusion in silence, 
without props or music, just the body." 
</P>
<P>
The world's best-known mime is probably Frenchman Marcel Marceau, who wears 
white makeup, a striped jersey and a tall hat, and makes you believe he is 
climbing stairs when there are none. 
</P>
<P>
"Marceau has one style, but he is so famous he has eclipsed the others," Seelig 
said. "Charlie Chaplin was a mime, but nobody thinks of that." 
</P>
<P>
"Because of Marceau, people think mime in France is bound to be the best and 
popular, but it isn't so. Mime is wonderful in Eastern Europe, and there are 
splendid American mimes." 
</P>
<P>
Dan Kamin, a busy American performer, has his own show at the festival called 
"Confessions of an Illusionist." His book, "Charlie Chaplin's One-Man Show," is 
regarded in the profession as the definitive study of Chaplin's art. 
</P>
<P>
Mime blossomed in Czechoslovakia because under the old Hapsburg Empire, the 
Austrian rulers made German the official language. Actors circumvented the 
prohibition on their own languages in theaters with mime theater, which didn't 
need a license. 
</P>
<P>
Seelig called the Czech mime Bolek Polivka, who is taking part in the festival, 
"the greatest clown of our time." 
</P>
<P>
Polivka and his partner, Chantal Poulain, work with every theatrical trick in 
the book: costumes, masks, puppets and illusion. 
</P>
<P>
Helen Lannaghan, the festival co-director, said the budget is small and 
dependent on box office receipts, with some help from the state-funded Arts 
Council. Income from all sources is $165,000. 
</P>
<P>
This year's festival opened Jan. 15 and runs through Sunday.

MARKET BEAT: WESTWOOD ONE IS A CLASSIC WALL ST. TUG OF WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERB GREENBERG, HERB GREENBERG is a financial columnist for the San 
Francisco Chronicle. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Back in 1985, Westwood One had a great story to sell, and Wall Street bought 
it. Instead of merely syndicating radio programs, it built its own radio 
network by acquiring existing networks that were in trouble. First, it bought 
the Mutual Broadcasting System, followed by the NBC Radio Network two years 
later, making Westwood the country's biggest radio network after ABC. Its 
stock, which sold for as low as $4.375 in 1984, shot to as high as $32 in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, Westwood has added radio stations in New York, Los Angeles and 
San Diego, among other properties. But fast growth may have taken its toll on 
the $100-million-plus Culver City-based company. Quips one short-seller: "It's 
a Cinderella story gone sour." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, its stock is resting near its 52-week lows, in part because of a 
slower-than-expected turnaround in NBC, and the bears believe that it will go 
much lower. It closed Friday in over-the-counter trading at $7.625 a share, up 
12.50 cents. 
</P>
<P>
(After the markets closed Friday, the company announced that it expects to 
report a record loss for the latest fiscal year of about $24 million, or $1.57 
to $1.63 a share.) 
</P>
<P>
One short-seller who declined to be identified -- which is often the case -- 
believes that in the best case, assuming the company's assets are sold, the 
stock is worth $2.50 a share after paying off about $190 million in debt. Not 
only is Westwood's debt double its equity, but it lost $18.6 million for the 
first nine months of its last fiscal year and interest payments more than 
doubled. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, Financial Statement Alert, which is produced by Los Angeles-based 
Kellogg Associates, has questioned some of Westwood's accounting. Kellogg has 
been early in spotting controversial activities at numerous companies whose 
stocks have subsequently declined, such as Prime Motor Inns, Cineplex Odeon and 
First Executive Corp. In the case of Westwood, Kellogg questions whether the 
company fiddled with its income statement in the third quarter "to avoid 
showing a larger loss." 
</P>
<P>
But bulls are also sounding off on Westwood, which is quickly evolving into a 
classic Wall Street tug of war. Most analysts are as bullish as ever. The lower 
the stock goes, they say, the more attractive it becomes. On Thursday, in fact, 
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette analyst Dennis Leibowitz issued an "aggressive 
buy" on the stock, dismissing bear talk that has mauled the stock in recent 
days as "the same old issues." 
</P>
<P>
He's impressed by what he sees as the company's strong cash flow and the 
underlying value of its assets, which he thinks are worth about $20 a share. 
</P>
<P>
As for the company's position on all of this, President William Battison takes 
issue with concerns raised by Kellogg &amp; Associates. He insists that 
Westwood generates enough internal cash flow to service its debt, and he 
believes that the company will be profitable sometime in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile . . . there's another less obvious cloud hanging over Westwood. A 
former Westwood executive has lodged a complaint with the Federal Election 
Commission against Chairman Norman Pattiz. 
</P>
<P>
A commission spokesman confirmed receiving the complaint but would say only 
that the case hasn't yet been closed. The letter states that Pattiz "secretly 
financed campaign contributions in the name of his employees and their 
relatives, each of whom was subsequently reimbursed by Mr. Pattiz through his 
corporation." 
</P>
<P>
According to the letter, the money, $13,000, went to the presidential campaign 
of Sen. Joseph Biden (D-Del.) as a way to enable Pattiz to testify before a 
broadcasting-related congressional subcommittee run by Sen. Daniel Inouye 
(D-Hawaii), who happened to co-chair Biden's short-lived presidential effort in 
1988. The company said it is cooperating with the FEC to resolve the matter and 
believes there was no intentional violation of the law. It declined further 
comment, citing a confidentiality requirement imposed by the commission.

Shareholder Sues Ashton-Tate Executives: A shareholder of Ashton-Tate Corp. 
filed suit in Los Angeles Superior Court Wednesday against the company's 
officers and directors, charging that a conspiracy existed to artificially 
inflate the software company's stock and violate securities laws. 
</P>
<P>
The stock fell from a high of $30.75 a share to $18 a share after a June 13, 
1989, announcement that the firm would lose $15 million in the second quarter 
of 1989. The damages being sought are unspecified. Shareholder Sara Shields 
filed the suit on behalf of the company. A spokesman for Ashton-Tate said: "We 
need to wait until we see (the suit) before we can comment." (Filed Jan. 17, 
1990. Case No. C749444)

Mothers of Invention Sue Frank Zappa: Six members of the now-defunct rock 
group, the Mothers of Invention, filed suit in Los Angeles Superior Court on 
Thursday against the group's former leader, Frank Zappa; his wife, Gail, and 
his companies, Bizarre Records, Barking Pumpkin Records, Barfko Swill and 
Intercontinental Absurdities. The suit is related to one filed in 1985 in which 
the former members of the band charged that after the group entrusted their 
business affairs to Zappa, he obtained the master recordings from another 
record company and profited from them without compensating the band members. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest suit, the members add to their claims that Zappa has defamed them 
by telling a newspaper that the previous lawsuit was "the product of chemically 
altered imaginations." A spokesman for Zappa could not be reached. (Filed Jan. 
17, 1990. Case No. C749601)

Hilton Hotels Wins $7.5-Million Damage Award: Los Angeles-based Hilton Hotels 
Corp. was awarded $7.5 million by a U.S. District Court jury in Maryland, which 
found that a hotel owner had breached a 20-year management contract with 
Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
Hilton was to manage a Greenbelt, Md., hotel for 20 years. However, in 1987 the 
owners said Hilton had breached its management agreement and ordered Hilton out 
of the property by June 30, 1987. The award represents Hilton's fees for the 
remainder of the contract. The hotel is now operated by Marriott Corp. (Filed 
July 6, 1988 Case No. C.A. HM88-1960)

Cash Offered for Buying American Car: A company chairman grew tired of seeing 
foreign cars in his firm's parking lot, so he offered a bounty -- $1,000 to any 
employee who buys an American-made car or light truck. "All it's got to be is 
an American label on an American-made car," said Peter Rossin, chairman of 
Dynamet Inc. in southwestern Pennsylvania. "A Honda car made in Ohio doesn't 
qualify because the profits derived from that car go back to Japan."

Home Savings Merger Denied: The federal Office of Thrift Supervision, as 
expected, denied Home Savings of America's request to merge with a New 
York-based bank that it owns, in a move that would cut its deposit insurance 
premiums. The Irwindale-based thrift's merger into Bowery Savings Bank would 
roughly halve Home's $47-million annual payment because banks pay much lower 
deposit insurance rates than thrifts. Home said it will keep fighting for the 
merger through a federal lawsuit filed last summer in Los Angeles.

AT&amp;T May Seek Mutual-Aid Pact: AT&amp;T, embarrassed by last week's massive 
long-distance network failure, is considering asking its competitors, MCI and 
US Sprint, for a mutual-aid agreement to prevent similar nationwide shutdowns. 
AT&amp;T officials say they are still only studying a possible pact, but that a 
proposal could be ready this week. MCI and US Sprint said they are willing to 
consider the idea.

INDIA MAY REFILE CASE AGAINST UNION CARBIDE; 
</P>
<P>
LAW: THE GOVERNMENT SAID IT WILL REINSTATE CRIMINAL CHARGES IF THE FIRM'S 
$470-MILLION BHOPAL SETTLEMENT IS OVERTURNED.

India's new prime minister said Sunday that his government will reinstate 
criminal liability charges against Union Carbide Corp. if the country's Supreme 
Court overturns the previous $470-million settlement of the Bhopal poison-gas 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
"My government has decided in principle to review the settlement and to support 
petitions filed before courts by voluntary groups for its review," Vishwanath 
Pratap Singh, who became prime minister Dec. 2, told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"Human life and criminal liability cannot be compromised," Singh said during a 
four-hour visit to the disaster site. "There will be no compromise with the 
crime in the settlement for compensation with the company." 
</P>
<P>
Some 2,500 people were killed in December, 1984, when poison gas spewed out of 
the Bhopal pesticide plant in central India. The death toll has since risen to 
3,400. 
</P>
<P>
The previous government of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, which lost power in 
elections last November, settled for $470 million in compensation from the U.S. 
company after a Supreme Court order in February last year. 
</P>
<P>
Several activist groups have filed public interest petitions before India's 
highest court, seeking abrogation of the agreement and criminal charges against 
Union Carbide. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Danbury, Conn.-based Union Carbide said Sunday that he had 
nothing to add to an earlier statement on the case issued by the company's vice 
president and general counsel, Joseph Geogan. 
</P>
<P>
That statement said: "We are confident the settlement will stand. There is 
simply no basis for overturning it. The settlement was extremely fair and is a 
binding agreement . . . The new administration may not disavow the settlement 
because it disagrees with it." 
</P>
<P>
Singh said his government would reinstate criminal liability charges if a 
petition challenging the adequacy of the settlement is upheld by a special 
Supreme Court review panel. 
</P>
<P>
Last Feb. 15, India's Supreme Court accepted the $470 million as "full and 
final settlement" of the government's suit, which had been dragging through 
Indian court procedures for about four years. 
</P>
<P>
The Gandhi government originally sought $3 billion in damages and later filed 
criminal negligence charges against top officials of Union Carbide and its 
local subsidiary, Union Carbide of India Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
When Union Carbide and the Gandhi government agreed on the $470 million, the 
Indian Supreme Court absolved the company of further civil or criminal 
liability. 
</P>
<P>
However, under Indian law, the decision is subject to review if challenged. Gas 
victims and activist groups challenged.

CRITIC AT LARGE: STANWYCK A UNIQUE SPIRIT AMONG HER PEERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, TIMES ARTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The founding fathers of the movie industry, and some of their heirs apparent to 
this very day, have preferred to think of women as decorative and reactive, 
cheering on the men who went off and did whatever valiant things needed doing. 
</P>
<P>
Yet from Mary Pickford forward there have been women -- never really that many, 
if you stop to count -- who did not accommodate well to the passive voice and 
whose independent spirit earned them a popularity and a power that often gave 
the moguls fits but was irresistible. 
</P>
<P>
Bette Davis seemed to spend much of her career jousting noisily with Jack 
Warner (and anyone else who sought to run her life for her). Rosalind Russell 
both portrayed and personified the self-starting, self-sustaining woman, 
delighted with the company of men, it might be, but on a sort of Dutch-treat 
basis in terms of careers and all else. Katharine Hepburn, Joan Crawford, 
Gloria Swanson, Olivia de Havilland (fighting her quieter wars with the studio 
system) spring to mind. 
</P>
<P>
And so, most particularly, does Barbara Stanwyck, who died on Saturday at 82 
after an astonishing six-decade career that ran from the chorus lines of 
Broadway to an early silent film, to being the best-paid actress in Hollywood 
in the early '40s, to a renewed career in television on a scale that only 
Lucille Ball and a handful of other film stars have managed. 
</P>
<P>
If a fiercely independent cast of mind linked the women who rose to the heights 
of the star system, each of them was unique, distinct from each of the others. 
Two New Englanders could not have worn such different hauteurs as Bette Davis 
and Katharine Hepburn, for example, and two up-from-the-chorus dancers could 
not finally have had such unalike screen personas as Joan Crawford and Barbara 
Stanwyck: Crawford with a steely and regal arrogance when it was required, 
Stanwyck with the always lurking possibilities of being kittenish, naughty and 
quite wicked in a wide range of situations, as well as powerful and commanding 
as need be. 
</P>
<P>
Stanwyck was too special, too identifiable, to qualify as Everywoman, and yet 
she never lost the most valuable gifts of her origins as Ruby Stevens in 
Brooklyn. Her resilience never overshadowed the sense that she was vulnerable; 
she was at home in the working class, the lower middle class, the middle class 
and that undefined terrain where people live and work who have escaped their 
beginnings. Better than many a sexpot starlet, she could convey a smoldering 
sexuality that was the more potent because it appeared to arise deep in her 
soul rather than from a sequence of thrusting and practiced postures. 
</P>
<P>
The envy of the film stars is that they leave a tangible legacy as well as 
memories. Tomorrow's film enthusiasts will discover in "Double Indemnity" and 
"Sorry, Wrong Number" just what a sensational dramatic actress she had learned 
to be, and her tour de force hysterics in "Sorry, Wrong Number" are chilling to 
remember. 
</P>
<P>
A glimpse of "Ball of Fire" will introduce the comedienne who understood that 
laughter emerges from character as well as circumstances (and is aided 
wonderfully when you have a script by Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder). It is 
an irony of timing that "Stella" will shortly be in release, with Bette Midler 
in the role that Stanwyck created in "Stella Dallas" more than half a century 
ago, tearing hearts to shreds in the ultimate tear jerker as the unwed mother 
watching in the rain as her beautiful daughter marries into high society. 
</P>
<P>
In the Frank Capra-Robert Riskin "Meet John Doe" with Gary Cooper, the warm and 
compassionate but still effective Barbara Stanwyck, making things happen, is on 
view. In "Annie Oakley," there is to be seen the Stanwyck who could bring life 
and depth to a delightful historic eccentric. 
</P>
<P>
That invaluable enshriner of film history, the late Leslie Halliwell, found a 
pair of Stanwyck quotes that hint of a whole biography. "I want to go on until 
they have to shoot me," Stanwyck said. It was the kind of drive that possessed 
Bette Davis as well. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Stanwyck also said, "Put me in the last 15 minutes of a picture and I 
don't care what happened before. I don't even care if I was in the rest of the 
damned thing -- I'll take it in those last 15 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
It was the total professional talking. Gloria Swanson in "Sunset Boulevard" 
says: "We had faces then." The pro that Stanwyck was might well have added that 
faces were never quite enough; to make it big, they had personalities that were 
eloquent, even in silent days. 
</P>
<P>
Stanwyck and her few contemporaries brought the liberated woman and the raised 
consciousness to the screen even before the society had defined the terms (and 
before the bosses were quite ready for it). So doing, she and other stars not 
only entertained the society but may well have helped to prepare it for change.

GLOBES ENTER THE '90S WITH A NOD TOWARD SOCIAL RELEVANCE;

ENTERTAINMENT: 'BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY' WINS FOUR AWARDS AND 'DRIVING MISS 
DAISY' THREE.

The Hollywood Foreign Press Assn., notes one television producer, was always 
considered five to 10 years behind the times. Note its selection of Pia Zadora 
as "new star of the year" in 1981. But, if Saturday evening's 47th annual 
Golden Globe Awards was any indication, the group has become almost cutting 
edge. Performances by Wayne Newton and Suzanne Somers notwithstanding, a tone 
of "relevance" and social activism dominated the night. 
</P>
<P>
Vietnam was very much in the forefront. Oliver Stone's "Born on the Fourth of 
July" swept four of the five categories in which it was nominated including 
motion picture (drama), director, screenplay and actor (Tom Cruise) -- boding 
well for similar victories in March's Academy Awards ceremonies. (Eight of the 
last Golden Globe best picture winners have gone on to repeat during the 
Oscars.) Though its star Dana Delaney was edged out by Angela Lansbury 
("Murder, She Wrote") in the TV acting category, "China Beach" -- which focuses 
on the women in the Vietnamese conflict -- was named best dramatic TV series. 
</P>
<P>
Civil rights was also in the spotlight. "Driving Miss Daisy," the story of an 
elderly Jewish woman and her black chauffeur, walked off with the best motion 
picture (musical or comedy) award and the film's co-stars, Jessica Tandy and 
Morgan Freeman, won the top honors in their respective categories. Denzel 
Washington, who played a member of the first black infantry regiment in the 
Civil War epic "Glory," was selected as the best supporting actor in a dramatic 
motion picture. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Danson, designated best actor in a TV series (musical or comedy) for his 
performance in "Cheers," called for people to get off their couches and "hit 
the streets . . . to get out there and do something," while perennial favorite 
Audrey Hepburn, recipient of the evening's Cecil B. DeMille Award and a UNICEF 
activist, hailed the media ("radio, newspapers, films, TV -- all of it") for 
helping to create a "global compassion which to so many has become the lifeline 
and, in fact, saved millions of lives." 
</P>
<P>
The evening, broadcast by the Turner Broadcasting System, was as presenter 
James Woods described it, one of those "nice, silly perks" of the business. A 
rare opportunity for TV and film folk to co-mingle at what felt more like a 
sprawling family cocktail party than a stiff, career-impacting awards ceremony. 
Celebrities ranging from Gregory Peck to Tom Selleck made appearances. The 
festivities were relaxed and upbeat. One of the evenings biggest laughs 
occurred when Diane English, producer of "Murphy Brown" -- winner of the award 
for best TV series (musical or comedy) -- dangled one of the dried-out squabs 
from the dinner salad and asked if anyone wanted hers. Another when Steve 
Martin and Billy Crystal -- losers to Morgan Freeman in the movie actor 
category -- startled hosts Sam Elliott and Cybill Shepard by running on stage 
demanding to know who came in second. 
</P>
<P>
Director Oliver Stone was asked backstage to compare this win with that of his 
first Vietnam film "Platoon." "Like getting a second daughter married off," he 
said with a weary smile. 
</P>
<P>
Cruise, noting that Ron Kovic, the disabled veteran on whom "Born" was based, 
had been wounded 22 years ago to the day, expressed hope that "after tonight 
Jan. 20 will carry with it a better memory" for him. 
</P>
<P>
Kovic sounded patently political with allusions to a "new America" and John F. 
Kennedy. He refused to confirm reports that he's running for Congress in Orange 
County but declared in the euphoria of the moment: "If I do decide to run, I 
will win." 
</P>
<P>
If outsiders were tempted to read into the fact that minority artists scored 
big, the actors themselves did not. Asked how she interpreted the fact that her 
co-star Freeman and Washington won major awards, Jessica Tandy said: "They're 
both damn good actors . . . that's all." Washington, too, cautioned against 
excessive optimism. "I never regard anything as monumental," he said. "It's all 
evolution. This business is predicated on fear and spending someone's money. 
You ask them to give you $20 million in the hope you can bring them back $60 
million. We're moving in the right direction, but it's still very tough."

KNBC Channel 4 and KCBS Channel 2 split top television honors at the 40th

racism in Long Beach and for Judd McIlvain's "troubleshooter" segment. 
</P>
<P>
KABC Channel 7, which was shut out of the Golden Mikes last year, garnered 
three awards Friday for best newscast writing, best news series reporting for 
its multi-parter called "Medical Gridlock" and for Bill Press' news commentary.

KCET Channel 28 and KCOP Channel 13 also won three statuettes. KCET's

<P>
'BAD GIRL' NOVELIST ERICA JONG IS BACK WITH A STEAMY NEW BOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH GETLIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WESTON, Conn. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Erica Jong stretches out on her big brass bed, leans back comfortably on a 
mound of plump white pillows and positions herself for the photographer. 
Suddenly, she sits up and frowns. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, maybe I shouldn't be doing this," Jong says, nervously fluffing her 
mane of thick blond hair. "My literary reputation is in bad enough shape as it 
is. Maybe I shouldn't be, hmm, photographed in bed." 
</P>
<P>
The moment of doubt passes. Jong settles back onto the pillows and strokes a 
pet poodle that has jumped onto her lap. As the camera clicks away, she talks 
excitedly about a coming trip to Italy to plug her latest novel, "Any Woman's 
Blues." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really looking forward to going there," she says. "In Italy, they treat me 
as a serious writer. Here, they treat me like the happy hooker." 
</P>
<P>
Ever since Jong burst onto the literary scene in 1973 with her bawdy 
best-selling novel "Fear of Flying," the outspoken writer says she has been 
fighting for respectability. The battle rages on, but it hasn't been all that 
painful for the 47-year-old Jong, a master of self-promotion. 
</P>
<P>
"Fear of Flying," a satiric and sexually frank book about a woman's quest for 
independence, sold 10 million copies and made Jong an overnight star. Formerly 
a little-known poet and essayist, she suddenly became a household name, a hot 
topic on talk shows, magazine covers and in gossip columns. 
</P>
<P>
Her madcap book, which was published in 20 countries, reflected the turbulent 
changes in sexual relationships between men and women that surfaced in the 
early 1970s. But critics were divided, and the resulting debate set a tone for 
Jong's career that has persisted. While some praised the novel as a chronicle 
of Everywoman's struggle, others said it was cliched, oversexed and a 
disservice to the women's movement. 
</P>
<P>
Today, 17 years later, "Fear of Flying" seems tame, even dated, and Jong 
herself appears to have mellowed. The woman who once ironically referred to 
herself as "the patron saint of adulteresses" now lives quietly in Connecticut 
and Manhattan with her fourth husband, New York attorney Ken Burrows. She has 
one child, 11-year-old Mollie, from her third marriage. 
</P>
<P>
Given a choice, Jong says she would rather go to a movie with her family than 
attend a celebrity bash. But if she herself has shed the "bad girl" image, her 
novels have not. Jong has continued to stir up controversy on the literary 
scene, and if the past is any guide, her latest book, "Any Woman's Blues" 
(Harper &amp; Row, $18.95), will be no different. 
</P>
<P>
Billed as a social history of the 1980s, the novel is a steamy smorgasbord of 
sexual obsession, drug addiction, alcoholism and self-destruction. Some of the 
lengthy X-rated passages may repel readers, especially graphic scenes of sexual 
bondage and humiliation. But Jong insists she has a duty to be outrageous. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody has to claim their territory, and I'll touch stuff that other people 
won't touch," she says. "I'll talk about what many women writers won't talk 
about. And since I seem to validate and heal people with my books, I feel it's 
a calling to do so." 
</P>
<P>
In her book, Jong charts the distance that American women have traveled from 
the 1970s to the present. Although feminists have made great strides toward 
sexual freedom, the experience has left many of them confused, she says. 
</P>
<P>
"These days, women are entitled to sexual pleasure. Women are entitled to be 
mommies and workers. But are they more liberated? I'd say no. We've only had a 
partial revolution." 
</P>
<P>
As the book begins, Jong informs readers that novelist Isadora Wing, the plucky 
heroine of "Fear of Flying," has disappeared in a plane over the South Pacific. 
But she has left behind a manuscript telling the story of Leila Sand, a rich 
painter who drifts from one sick relationship to another -- and through a 
series of crippling addictions -- before achieving inner peace. 
</P>
<P>
She also has lots of sex, beginning on Page 1. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no penis envy," says Sand, reflecting on her adolescent years. "I 
actually thought I had a penis." 
</P>
<P>
Rhapsodizing on her lover's erotic powers, she seems to faint with the 
recollection: "Who can describe lust when it is this hot, this succulent, this 
compelling? Words cannot touch it. Perhaps only music can echo the swell and 
heft of it, the heat, the vibration." 
</P>
<P>
As the novel nears its conclusion, the heroine hits rock bottom during a visit 
to Madama Ada, a Greenwich Village dominatrix. Asked how she got into the 
field, the siren in black stiletto heels doesn't miss a beat. 
</P>
<P>
"Let me tell you what I told Phil Donahue," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Jong contends that the S &amp; M episode is relevant because "I think that's 
what's happening. . . . I think there's a great deal of dark sexuality that has 
come out of women's liberation. 
</P>
<P>
"Women are saying, 'How can I prove I'm female?'. . . . So what are women 
doing? They're wearing black leather garter belts. They're playing with their 
men in a very submissive, kind of 'Story of O' way. And I think it's directly 
related to the confusion of sexual roles that has come out of liberation." 
</P>
<P>
The underlying problem, Jong says, is that the 1980s were a time of doubt and 
insecurity. It doesn't matter if people were hung up on a person, a drug, 
credit cards, shopping or chocolate, because "in the book it's all the same 
thing. It's a recurring theme." 
</P>
<P>
It's also autobiographical. 
</P>
<P>
Like her heroine, Jong comes from a New York Jewish family, lives in suburban 
Connecticut and has had several marriages. She too has had obsessive 
relationships with men who drove her to drink. And, like her character, she 
went to Alcoholics Anonymous to get her life back together. 
</P>
<P>
Is the entire novel -- including the, uh, candlestick scene -- 
autobiographical? Jong looks uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
"That's kind of dicey . . . it's the unanswerable question really. Let's just 
say that all the details in the book are not true. I did some research. But not 
all of the stuff that deals with the dominatrix is true." 
</P>
<P>
Like many writers, Jong says there is a clear line between her own voice and 
those of her characters. Still, she is passionate in discussing the travails of 
Leila Sand and their reverberations in her own life. 
</P>
<P>
The key issue, of course, is sex. Jong insists that most American women -- 
despite all the feminist rhetoric -- are still obsessed with men. 
</P>
<P>
"Are women better off today? No. Is society less sexist? No. Is this the fault 
of women? No. Women are still hung up on men, with love as a way of having 
identity. That simply hasn't changed." 
</P>
<P>
Haven't many American women gone beyond that stage? Jong is skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, sure, there are some," she says. "But I look around me, at all the women 
whom I admire, who are fabulous women, who are doing well . . . and if they're 
not with a man, they're unhappy. Society treats them as failures." 
</P>
<P>
The author says she learned this from her experiences as a single woman. For 
much of the '80s, she was looking for Mr. Right, but with no luck. The quest 
left her feeling like a pariah in polite society. 
</P>
<P>
"You know me, I get invited everywhere, right? Because I'm well-known and 
because I'm an affable, gregarious person and fun to be around. But there's 
always, when you're a single woman, an edge of fear and envy about the way 
other women treat you, particularly women who are married. 
</P>
<P>
"They always act as if you might possibly steal their husbands. And the married 
men are always coming on to you." 
</P>
<P>
In the book, Leila Sand dwells obsessively on her lovers, bragging about their 
sexual prowess and bewailing their infidelities. One of them, a surly young 
stud, lives off her money and cheats on her like a bandit. The humiliation is 
overwhelming, but Sand is incapable of freeing herself from the affair. Jong 
says she too has experienced that helpless, sinking feeling. 
</P>
<P>
"Have I sat by the phone, drinking wine, because my man didn't come home? 
Absolutely, I've done that. To the degree that I couldn't move. I think there 
isn't a woman with a soul so dead that she wouldn't say yes to that." 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, she says, these frustrating affairs led her into co-dependency, a 
state in which men and women inadvertently take on the worst addictions and 
character flaws of the people with whom they are involved. 
</P>
<P>
Much of "Any Woman's Blues" deals with that downward spiraling, and Sand's 
fight to get free. Although supermarket bookshelves are overflowing with 
"self-help" books about this problem, Jong says her novel is different because 
it deals with a human story and offers no magic solutions. 
</P>
<P>
"Co-dependency is just a trendy term for being a well-socialized woman," she 
says. "We're all trained to put other people's needs before our own. We're 
trained to be validated by what our husbands, children and lovers think of us. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not uniquely feminine, but it's considered normal in women, whereas in 
men it's considered a disease," Jong adds, with a sardonic laugh. 
</P>
<P>
As Leila Sand plummets downward, taking on the drinking, cocaine and sexaholic 
tendencies of her lovers, she finally seeks help from Alcoholics Anonymous. In 
her own life, Jong was lured to AA meetings out of concern for addicted 
friends. But she soon found the same problems in herself. 
</P>
<P>
"In my own way, I've been an addict," she says. "You cannot have been alive in 
the last decade without knowing someone whose life has been affected by these 
problems. To me, (AA) has been a very important tool, it's a self-diagnosis 
tool, and a real path to introspection and spirituality." 
</P>
<P>
Since much of the book mirrors her own life, Jong expects critics to zero in on 
the more lurid episodes. By now, she says, it's all part of the game. A visitor 
gets the feeling that she isn't too terribly concerned -- and may in fact be 
laughing all the way to the bank. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, I'm Erica 'Fear of Flying' Jong," she says. "And the Erica Jong that 
people expect is a kind of monster, created by a series of articles that began 
to be published around 1973, when the book became a worldwide phenomenon. You 
know, the Erica Jongs of this world who have led women into depravity and 
pornography. But nobody could be that person." 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't matter, she says, that her upcoming projects include a critical 
biography of author Henry Miller, a book on the art of writing and a new 
collection of poems. Forget the serious work she has done in the past, 
including essays on 18th-Century literature, volumes of poetry and thoughtful 
introductions to classics such as "Lolita." 
</P>
<P>
"If you go around fighting this image that people have of me, it just comes out 
worse, right? You get articles written as if you were a Charlie's Angel who now 
wanted to take serious acting lessons, or a Marilyn Monroe who had the 
temerity, after posing nude, to study with Lee Strasberg." 
</P>
<P>
Jong looks dismayed, but only for a fleeting moment. Her new book is No. 3 on 
the Italian best-seller lists, and she believes it has a chance to do equally 
well in America. The S &amp; M scenes may generate controversy, the author 
explains, and the resulting debate could boost sales. 
</P>
<P>
"Look, this is my 14th book," she says with a big, confident smile. "I'm a 
veteran of this process, and I don't expect nice things to be said. After all 
this time, I'm just grateful if they spell my name right."

BUSH GIVES ANTI-ABORTION MARCHERS HIS SUPPORT BUT CHOOSES NOT TO MEET THEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Associated Press

<DATELINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush assured anti-abortion marchers today of his "deep conviction" 
against the Supreme Court ruling 17 years ago today that legalized abortion, 
and his steadfast opposition to abortion on demand. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, speaking by telephone to marchers gathered outside the White House before 
their annual march past the Capitol and the Supreme Court, said the 
anti-abortion movement reminds Americans "of the self-evident moral superiority 
of adoption over abortion." 
</P>
<P>
Bush also addressed the March for Life last year on his third day as President, 
continuing the tradition of his predecessor, Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
Bush did not mention his support for a constitutional amendment to outlaw 
abortion. And, in another departure from past practice, neither he nor Vice 
President Dan Quayle met with organizers of the annual anti-abortion march. 
</P>
<P>
Even as Bush spoke, pro-choice forces led by the Planned Parenthood Federation 
were urging Americans to call the White House switchboard to register their 
support for legal abortions. 
</P>
<P>
After hearing Bush and a handful of congressmen and other speakers, the crowd, 
estimated by U.S. Park Police at 35,000, marched up Pennsylvania Avenue to the 
U.S. Capitol and the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, backers of legal abortion raised the specter of Romania's former 
Communist repression in warning against a rollback of abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
The head of the National Abortion Rights Action League told a gathering on 
Capitol Hill that legalizing abortions was one of the first steps Romania took 
after overthrowing its hated dictator last month. 
</P>
<P>
"Romanians know firsthand what most Americans can only imagine -- the deadly 
impact of government bans on abortion," said Kate Michelman, executive director 
of the abortion-rights lobbying group. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a travesty if the United States, the beacon of democracy in the 
world, applauded Romania's reforms while adopting repressive anti-choice laws 
here at home," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Activists on both sides of the issue -- sensing 1990 will be a pivotal year in 
the political debate on abortion -- held competing events marking the 
anniversary of the high court decision, Roe v. Wade, that legalized abortions. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion-rights advocates also gathered on the Mall outside the Capitol where a 
temporary memorial was erected in tribute to all women who have died from 
illegal, botched abortions -- including Becky Bell, a 17-year-old Indianapolis 
girl who died in September, 1988, after a self-induced abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Bell, her father, said his daughter died because Indiana law requires 
minors to obtain parental consent before they can get a legal abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"Our daughter was punished," he said.

PANEL OKS QUAKE BOND ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A City Council panel endorsed plans today to place a $376-million bond issue on 
the June ballot to reinforce 84 city buildings and 459 bridges to withstand a 
major earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Spurred by the devastating Bay Area quake in October, the full council earlier 
this month directed several city departments to work out the details of placing 
the measure before the voters and report back to the council. 
</P>
<P>
Prepared by the city administrative office, the report was presented to the 
council's Ad Hoc Buildings and Structures Earthquake Safety Committee. 
</P>
<P>
If the council approves the measure, the city attorney's office will draft the 
ordinance needed to place the bond issue on the ballot June 5. A second vote 
will be needed by the council to formerly adopt the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
The bond issue must be approved by two-thirds of the voters and would cost the 
average homeowner an additional $30 a year in property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Among the most expensive repairs would be $112 million for City Hall, $16 
million for historic buildings on Olvera Street and $14 million for Old San 
Pedro City Hall.

FIRST INTERSTATE REPORTS LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
First Interstate Bancorp today reported a fourth-quarter loss of $344.3 million 
and a loss for the year after the eighth-largest bank holding company put aside 
$454.1 million to cover possible loan losses, mainly in real estate. 
</P>
<P>
Investors had been expecting losses as Los Angeles-based First Interstate 
warned last month of a probable $400-million addition to reserves. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth-quarter loss compared to net income of $144.0 million for the same 
period in 1988. The loss for all of 1989 totaled $124.5 million, against a 
profit of $129.4 million the prior year. 
</P>
<P>
First Interstate has been plagued with problem real estate loans in Texas and

Mayor Marion Barry, facing a misdemeanor cocaine possession charge, left the 
nation's capital today to check into a residential treatment facility in 
Florida, a city official said. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point the mayor is not considering resignation," City Administrator 
Carol Thompson told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be no management vacuum" in the mayor's absence. 
</P>
<P>
Barry, who has turned over the daily control of the local government to 
Thompson, did not speak to reporters before leaving his home. 
</P>
<P>
"The mayor has left the city. . . . He has left for treatment," Thompson said. 
She said it was "not appropriate" for her to disclose details of the mayor's 
treatment. She said Barry would be doing that. 
</P>
<P>
However, a top political aide to the mayor said Barry left for the 
Hanley-Hazelden Treatment Center in West Palm Beach, Fla. Clinic spokeswoman 
Patricia McRae said confidentiality rules forbid the clinic from revealing the 
names of patients.

ALL-WHITE JURY RULED NON-RACIST; 
</P>
<P>
CONSTITUTION: SUPREME COURT REFUSES TO EXPAND SIXTH AMENDMENT RIGHTS ON AN 
IMPARTIAL JURY FOR WHITE CONVICTED RAPIST.

With members trading sharp words over racism, a divided Supreme Court ruled 
today that the Sixth Amendment right to a trial by an "impartial jury" is not 
violated when blacks are excluded from a white man's jury. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the court in a 5-4 ruling, said the 
decision was a narrow one and not at all involved in racial politics. He noted 
that previous rulings have made it clear that blacks may not be systematically 
excluded from juries. 
</P>
<P>
However, he said the question before the court was "whether the defendant has 
been denied the right to 'trial by an impartial jury.' The earnestness of this 
court's commitment to racial justice is not to be measured by its willingness 
to expand constitutional provisions designed for other purposes beyond their 
proper bounds." 
</P>
<P>
Scalia said the heart of the Sixth Amendment was its guarantee of an impartial 
jury -- not one that represents the racial makeup of a community. 
</P>
<P>
In his 13-page decision, Scalia also charged that Justice Thurgood Marshall, 
the court's only black member, resorted to waving the red flag of racism. 
</P>
<P>
"Justice Marshall's dissent rolls out the ultimate weapon, the accusation of 
insensitivity to racial discrimination -- which will lose its intimidating 
effect if it continues to be fired so randomly," Scalia said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not remotely true that our opinion today 'lightly . . . sets aside' the 
constitutional goal of 'eliminating racial discrimination in our system of 
criminal justice.' " 
</P>
<P>
Scalia continued, "The defendant in this case is not a black man, but a 
convicted white rapist who seeks to use the striking of blacks from his jury to 
overturn his conviction. . . . Race as such has nothing to do with the legal 
issue in this case." 
</P>
<P>
Marshall charged the majority -- the court's conservative wing comprised of 
Scalia, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Byron R. White, Sandra 
Day O'Connor and Anthony M. Kennedy -- of insulating an "especially invidious 
form of racial discrimination." 
</P>
<P>
"The elimination of racial discrimination in our system of criminal justice is 
not a constitutional goal that should be lightly set aside," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall was joined by Justices William J. Brennan Jr. and Harry A. Blackmun. 
Justice John Paul Stevens dissented in a separate opinion.

The Bush family is split along gender lines on the issue of abortion, Newsweek 
magazine reported, with George and Barbara heading the opposing camps. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush and his wife discussed abortion at a recent get-together with 
their children and spouses and found all the men were anti-abortion and all the 
women were pro-choice, said the magazine, released Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
It did not name its source. 
</P>
<P>
Bush opposes abortion except to save the mother's life or in cases of rape or 
incest. He opposes federal funding of abortions except to save the mother's 
life. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the women at the Bush family gathering, including the First Lady, said 
abortion should not be without controls, but insisted on a woman's right to 
choose in certain circumstances, the magazine said. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Bush has refused to answer reporters' questions about her personal 
views on abortion.

Britain's Princess Anne denied banner-headline reports today that she was 
planning to divorce her estranged husband, Mark Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't seen a paper today," Queen Elizabeth's only daughter told 
Independent Television News. "Divorce? Never been mentioned by anybody." 
</P>
<P>
The 39-year-old Princess Royal, looking puzzled, was speaking from behind the 
wheel of a farm vehicle on her country estate in western England. 
</P>
<P>
Princess Anne and Phillips announced their separation last August, saying there 
were no plans for divorce proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
In a report headlined "Anne: I Want a Quickie Divorce," the Daily Express said 
the princess was pushing to end the 15-year-old marriage despite Phillips' wish 
to let the separation run on indefinitely.

YUGOSLAV COMMUNISTS GIVE UP MONOPOLY ON GOVERNMENT CONTROL

<P>
Yugoslavia's Communist Party renounced its constitutionally guaranteed monopoly 
on power today after 45 years of unchallenged rule and decided to permit the 
creation of a multi-party system. 
</P>
<P>
The move was the latest in a string of abdications by Communist parties in 
Eastern Europe, the most recent in Bulgaria, which like the others chose to 
give up monopolies on power held since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"The League of Communists (the party) renounces its constitutionally guaranteed 
leading role in society," said Momir Bulatovic, Communist Party chief of the 
republic of Montenegro and chairman of a plenary session at the party's 
congress. 
</P>
<P>
"(The party) proposes to the Yugoslav Parliament that it pass a law on 
political pluralism including a multi-party system," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Only 28 out of 1,654 delegates at the congress voted against the renunciation 
at the end of a stormy plenary session. 
</P>
<P>
Delegates earlier shouted down speakers from the republics of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Slovenia who demanded the Yugoslav Communist Party 
dissolve as a unified body and break up into several parties. 
</P>
<P>
"We propose the . . . (League of Communists) transform itself into two parties 
-- one Communist and the other Socialist," said Bosnian delegate Desimir 
Medjovic. 
</P>
<P>
"The gradual suicide of the League of Communists is all the more worrying 
because it burdens social relations in Yugoslavia," Medjovic shouted amid 
derisive applause and calls for him to leave the podium. 
</P>
<P>
Slovenian Communists proposed that the Yugoslav party break up into a 
confederation of party branches from the country's eight republics and 
provinces which would enjoy almost complete autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
"I warn you that this demand represents the stand of an entire party branch and 
not just one delegate," Slovenian Communist Party chief Ciril Ribicic told the 
stormy session.

Ousted leader Todor Zhivkov, who was arrested last week, faces up to 30 years

</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper Pogled, Zhivkov could serve from 10 years to 30 
years in jail if convicted of illegally "receiving an especially large amount 
of public property." He has been accused of having about 30 hunting or holiday 
retreats. 
</P>
<P>
Another charge against him, "inciting ethnic hostility and hatred," carries a 
maximum of three years, it said. Zhivkov also faces charges of abusing his 
power during his nearly 35-year rule, which is punishable by imprisonment of 
between three and 10 years, it said.

Union Carbide Corp.'s stock dropped in heavy midday trading today after the 
newly elected Indian government said it will review the company's $470-million 
settlement with victims of the 1984 Bhopal gas disaster. 
</P>
<P>
In midday trading, Union Carbide fell $1.625 to $20.875 and was the second 
most-active issue on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Traders and industry analysts noted that the drop in Union Carbide's share 
price was also aided by the current cyclic downturn of the domestic chemicals 
business. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Union Carbide, Bob Berzok, said he had nothing to add to an 
earlier statement on the case by the chemical company's vice president, Joseph 
Geogan. 
</P>
<P>
The statement said, "We are confident the settlement will stand. There is 
simply no basis for overturning it."

'RAINMAKER' BECK LEFT TRAIL OF LIES -- REPORT

Investment banker Jeffrey Beck, who helped negotiate some of the biggest 
takeovers of the 1980s, continually lied about his past, fabricating stories 
about his background and military service and claiming to work for the Central 
Intelligence Agency, a published report said today. 
</P>
<P>
Beck, a member of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s mergers and acquisitions 
department, allegedly told friends and colleagues over the years that he had 
served in the Army's Special Forces in Vietnam, that he did intelligence work 
for the U.S. government and that he would inherit a family fortune of $2 
billion, the Wall Street Journal reported. 
</P>
<P>
However, the newspaper said after interviewing friends, family, colleagues and 
acquaintances of the investment banker, none of the stories apparently was 
true. Drexel and Oppenheimer &amp; Co., which was Beck's previous employer, 
kept him in their mergers and acquisitions departments although many of his 
co-workers did not believe his stories, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Beck could not immediately be reached today to comment on the story; his office 
said he was out. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that during an interview Beck backtracked on some of his 
prior claims, categorically denying that he had told most of the stories 
attributed to him by what the newspaper called business associates, friends and 
others. 
</P>
<P>
"This is getting wilder and wilder," he told the newspaper. "I am beyond 
shock." 
</P>
<P>
Beck acknowledged there were no official records of his Vietnam service, but 
said he had made trips to Vietnam, the newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
The article also said Beck claimed he had done years of intelligence work, but 
denied having told people he worked for the CIA or that he would inherit a 
$2-billion fortune. 
</P>
<P>
Beck, nicknamed "Mad Dog," is a "rainmaker," one who drums up takeover business 
for investment firms. He has been highly successful, working as an adviser to 
the buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. on a number of deals, 
including its record $24.53-billion purchase of RJR Nabisco Inc. in 1988.

The Bush Administration, in a move to help East European countries, is ready to 
ease restrictions on sales of high-technology computers and other 
telecommunications equipment, officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
"The political and military environment is changing . . . . The situation is 
different today than it was a year ago," said White House spokesman Marlin 
Fitzwater. 
</P>
<P>
He said recommendations for easing the controls, made Friday at a meeting of 
the National Security Council, are under final review by President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Bush announced last month that he favored a relaxation of some of the 
restrictions on high-tech exports into Warsaw Pact nations. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater called the proposal developed in response to that appeal "a prudent 
change . . . that will not jeopardize strategic interests." 
</P>
<P>
American experts are in London beginning discussions on a joint approach with 
British officials. 
</P>
<P>
The discussions are in preparation for a meeting in Paris in mid-February of 
Cocom, the coordination committee for multilateral export control. There, the 
United States hopes to work out details of what kind of equipment will be 
cleared and how much of it. 
</P>
<P>
Cocom, which includes all 16 NATO countries except Iceland, plus Japan and 
Australia, attempts to coordinate Western deliveries of technology to Eastern 
countries. The United States has been among the most reluctant to provide high 
technology to allies of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The countries likely to be assisted include Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia, 
all of which have shed Communist domination and are adopting capitalistic 
approaches to their weak economies. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting in Paris is designed to adopt uniform rules to guide technology 
transfers. In this respect, the Administration's decision to liberalize 
restrictions could be balanced against the more eager approaches of some other 
Cocom members and produce a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
The net result, however, would be to deliver better computers and 
telecommunications equipment to members of the Eastern Bloc, provided 
semi-sensitive technology is not then turned over to the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said the decision made at the National Security Council meeting 
applied directly only to Eastern Europe and not to the Soviet Union. But, the 
officials said, the principle -- aiding countries as they adopt Western-style 
economies -- could eventually be extended to Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Cocom decisions are taken by consensus, and the 17 members try to act in 
unison. Still, if the United States had held out against liberalization, there 
was always a chance one or several of the other countries "would go off on 
their own in this time of extraordinary change," a U.S. official said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is some difference of view how far and how fast we should go," he said.

Japan's leading car makers, Toyota and Nissan, today reported mixed results in 
exports for 1989, with Toyota's exports declining 8.1% from the previous year 
and Nissan posting its first rise in four years. 
</P>
<P>
Toyota cited sluggish exports to the United States as the main reason for its 
drop. 
</P>
<P>
Toyota, Japan's No. 1 car maker, said total exports for 1989 were down 8.1% to 
1,669,130 units -- the first time in two years that total exports fell below 
those of the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
Nissan's exports for 1989 amounted to 1,064,172 units, an increase of 2% over 
the year before. "This increase in exports reflects 1988's low figure and the 
favorable reception of new Nissan models in the U.S. market," the company said. 
</P>
<P>
Both Tokyo and Nissan reported record domestic vehicle sales in 1989 amid 
booming domestic demand.

Universal City-based MCA Inc., the film maker and distributor whose earnings 
have been boosted by a series of hits, said today it will take $53 million in 
charges against 1989 earnings but expects to post higher profits. 
</P>
<P>
MCA's Universal Pictures has produced recent box office hits like "Sea of 
Love," "Parenthood," "Do the Right Thing," "Back to the Future II" and "Born on 
the Fourth of July." 
</P>
<P>
MCA also runs the Universal Studios theme park in Los Angeles and expects to 
open another in Orlando later this year. 
</P>
<P>
The company said it will sell its LJN Toys Ltd. unit and take a $30-million 
charge against 1989 earnings for the sale. MCA also said it would take a 
$23-million write-off for discontinued operations. 
</P>
<P>
The company said that despite losses from LJN, it expects to report higher 
earnings for 1989. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, MCA earned $164.9 million, or $2.26 per share. 
</P>
<P>
In early trading, MCA share prices were down 12.5 cents to $57.625.

Two decades of movie-making have left Richard Dreyfuss at a comfortable level 
of fame. 
</P>
<P>
"I have the right-size celebrity," the 42-year-old actor said in February's 
Fame magazine. "Not as much as some and a lot more than others. And I'm known 
but not worshiped. 
</P>
<P>
"I can always get a good table at a restaurant, but when I get to the table, 
they let me eat in peace," said Dreyfuss, star of the current film "Always." 
</P>
<P>
In the 1970s, Dreyfuss starred in such blockbusters as "American Graffiti," 
"Jaws" and "Close Encounters of the Third Kind," and won an Academy Award for 
"The Goodbye Girl."

Ex-drug addict David Crosby is helping alcoholic teen-age actress Drew 
Barrymore stay straight. 
</P>
<P>
Barrymore, 14, lived with Crosby and his wife, Jan Dance, for three months as 
part of her program of recovery from alcohol and drug abuse, according to this 
week's People magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm an old Hollywood kid, and I knew her story. I felt she had been dealt a 
short deck, you know, a fifth-generation alcoholic, and I didn't want to see 
her go down the tubes," Crosby told People. 
</P>
<P>
Crosby, 48, of the rock group Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young, has a 
well-documented history of cocaine addiction, hitting bottom in 1983 with an 
11-month prison term on drug and weapons convictions. But now he's straight. 
</P>
<P>
Barrymore, the lovable moppet of the movie "E.T.," announced last year that she 
had struggled with drugs and alcohol since she was 9. When she left a clinic in 
October, the Crosbys took her in.

But Daniels has sympathy for him. The song's lyrics advocate the lynching of 
anybody involved in drugs and call for a slow death for child abusers by 
leaving them for alligators and rattlesnakes.

"When I say I'm a simple man, it's simple attitudes," Daniels said. "Obviously, 
I'm being facetious with the song. I certainly don't think we should string

GIANTS' CLARK NOW RICHEST PLAYER: $15-MILLION DEAL

<P>
All-Star first baseman Will Clark became the richest player in baseball today 
with the signing of a four-year, $15-million contract with the San Francisco 
Giants. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the contract, Clark will average $3.75 million per season, 
boosting him past the week-old record of $3.5 million belonging to Oakland 
Athletics' pitcher Dave Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
"It definitely overwhelms you to know that baseball has this much money," said 
Clark during a news conference at Candlestick Park. "I did not get into it to 
try to rob the bank. I got into it because I love the game." 
</P>
<P>
Clark's attorney, Jeffrey Moorad, noted that Clark also got the largest signing 
bonus in baseball history -- $2 million. Moorad said Clark will make $4.25 
million in the fourth year of the contract, "So Will becomes the first 
$4-million dollar player." 
</P>
<P>
"He plays like a Hall of Famer and he should be paid like one," said Giants 
General Manager Al Rosen. 
</P>
<P>
The left-handed batting Clark had probably his best season last year, when he 
finished with a .333 average, 23 home runs, 111 RBIs, 104 runs scored and 196 
hits.

</P>
<P>
French Tennis Federation officials announced the team at the Australian Open. 
</P>
<P>
Fleurian is the newest face on the squad. His selection was based on his 
Australian Open results -- he reached the third round and upset No. 7 seed 
Emilio Sanchez in the opening round. 
</P>
<P>
The Australians will be playing under less than ideal circumstances, having 
lost likely singles starter Mark Woodforde to an ankle injury. Former Wimbledon 
champion Pat Cash is on the team, but has not played singles for the past 10 
months after undergoing surgery on an Achilles tendon.

BECKER SURVIVES 5-SET STRUGGLE WITH MECIR, REACHES QUARTERFINALS

<P>
World No. 2 Boris Becker narrowly survived a thrilling five-set battle today 
with Miloslav Mecir of Czechoslovakia to reach the quarterfinals of the 
Australian Open tennis championships. 
</P>
<P>
Wimbledon and U.S. Open champion Becker dropped the first two sets against an 
inspired Mecir, the 16th seed, but staged a memorable comeback to win 4-6 6-7 
6-4 6-1 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth time since 1986 that the West German has come back to win 
from two sets down, keeping alive his hopes of overtaking Ivan Lendl as the 
world's top-ranked player. 
</P>
<P>
Becker will play three-time Australian champion Mats Wilander in the last 
eight. Wilander's Swedish compatriot Stefan Edberg also progressed smoothly 
into the quarterfinals where he meets unseeded American David Wheaton, a winner 
over fifth seed Aaron Krickstein. 
</P>
<P>
A relieved Becker admitted thoughts of his previous misfortunes at the 
Australian Open had flashed through his mind after he lost the second set 
tie-break. 
</P>
<P>
"If I'm honest I thought about it in the tie-break," he said. "Many things go 
through your mind. It's a struggle against yourself. That's the first battle 
you have to win. 
</P>
<P>
"He had to run very much in the first two sets, and the longer it went the more 
tired he got." 
</P>
<P>
Mecir's touch and accuracy unnerved Becker in the first set, but the second 
seed appeared to have the situation under control when he took a 5-2 lead in 
the second. 
</P>
<P>
The Czechoslovak, a losing finalist to Lendl last year, promptly won the next 
three games in which he conceded only one point and forced a tie-break, only to 
lose the first four points. 
</P>
<P>
Gradually, he again clawed his way back and took the tie-break 8-6 on his 
second set point. 
</P>
<P>
Mecir then stole into a 3-1 lead in the third set. 
</P>
<P>
Becker realized time was running out and suddenly produced his best form of the 
match to seize 11 of the next 13 games and square the match at two sets all. 
</P>
<P>
An increasingly desperate Mecir, who prepared for the tournament by going 
fishing in New Zealand for a week to rest an injured ankle, entered the final 
set knowing he had beaten his opponent in their only other five-set match at 
the U.S. Open in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
But this time he was powerless to stop the match from slipping through his 
fingers, and Becker rounded off a remarkable win after almost four hours on 
court. 
</P>
<P>
For Mecir it was an all too painful reminder of Wimbledon in 1988 when he lost 
a two set and 3-1 lead in the semifinal to eventual champion Edberg. 
</P>
<P>
Third seed Edberg gave the most impressive performance to beat fellow Swede 
Jonas Svensson 6-4 6-2 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I played very well right from the beginning," said Edberg, 
particularly pleased with his volleying that left his opponent gasping in 
admiration. 
</P>
<P>
"He was just too good," Svensson said. "I think he's shown everyone he's right 
up there with Lendl and Becker. The way he played today, he will be very 
difficult to beat." 
</P>
<P>
Eighth seed Wilander overcame injured Finn Veli Paloheimo 7-5 6-4 6-0 while 
Wheaton also profited from a groin injury to Krickstein to pull off a surprise 
7-6 6-4 6-3 victory.

MELVIN DURSLAG: CALCULATING THE HIGH PRICE OF FRIENDSHIP AT SUPER BOWL TIME

<TEXT>
<P>
Fastidious in their bookkeeping, the Denver Broncos offer a ticket breakdown 
for the upcoming Super Bowl, that monument to national lunacy, announcing they 
are receiving 13,000 of the 72,104 seats available in the Superdome. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco 49ers will receive the same number. 
</P>
<P>
As host team, the New Orleans Saints are tendered 6,100 seats, and 18,850 are 
spread among the other 25 brothers in the National League, amounting to 754 
each. 
</P>
<P>
Next, the league office is accommodated with 13,500, a figure to be explored 
shortly, and the remainder is allocated the luxury suite holders in the home 
stadium. 
</P>
<P>
It has been asked what the league office does with 13,500 tickets, and the 
answer never has been clear, no more than it is clear what anyone who gets 
tickets does with them. 
</P>
<P>
The league contends it takes care of friends, such as television networks and 
their sponsors. It also has a lot of friends in Washington and in industries 
dispensing products related to the league. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the 28 teams has friends, as well as the luxury suite holders. 
</P>
<P>
We have, at Super Bowl time, a display of friendship warming the heart of the 
republic. 
</P>
<P>
It is the sheerest coincidence that seats earmarked for friends should wind up 
selling for $500 and more -- much more in some instances. 
</P>
<P>
Before it entered into rest, the Herald-Examiner was planning a Super Bowl 
contest which would reward the winner with a trip, and two tickets, to the 
game. In order to obtain the tickets, it made an inquiry of a Los Angeles 
broker, obviously one with friends. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the broker could provide the tickets -- at $1,250 each. 
</P>
<P>
If there was any redemptive feature to the shutdown, it was only that the Super 
Bowl tickets weren't needed. 
</P>
<P>
But the point is, how has this monster evolved, this blatant scalping of a 
commodity reserved mostly for friends? 
</P>
<P>
The security force at 410 Park Avenue, residence of the National Football 
League, is massive. It levels a watchful eye on drugs. Its surveillance of 
gambling is close. It studies the personal habits of coaches, general managers 
and players. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't disclosed, but it is generally understood, that it keeps a dossier on 
each owner, too, tracing his everyday functions. 
</P>
<P>
Its ramparts of decency guarded with such impeccability, how does the league 
become a part of this heist, the shameful hawking of tickets to its biggest 
promotion at up to 10 times or more their value? 
</P>
<P>
Are those handling the tickets throughout the league being made accountable 
enough for their distribution? 
</P>
<P>
During his incumbency as commissioner, Pete Rozelle always worried about Super 
Bowl ticket scams, his worst fears realized when the fiance (later to become 
the husband) of the Los Angeles Rams owner got his hands on a large parcel of 
her tickets, scalped them and went to jail for failing to report the profits. 
</P>
<P>
"We try very hard to keep control of the tickets," said Rozelle, "but find it 
impossible to track down where they go after they leave the hands of those 
originally receiving them." 
</P>
<P>
If a Denver or San Francisco fan, for instance, latches on to a pair, the 
league can't account for what he does with them. 
</P>
<P>
Scalping, though, is so wide-scale that suspicion must focus on areas outside 
the fandom of the participating teams. 
</P>
<P>
Openly, for example, certain clubs over the years have gone into the travel 
business, selling Super Bowl packages at less than bargain prices. 
</P>
<P>
The trick to selling a Super Bowl package is to produce a Super Bowl ticket, 
around which can be wrapped air fare, hotel rooms, airport transfers and meals. 
</P>
<P>
Purchaser of the foregoing may be rewarded, at the packager's expense, with a 
welcome mai tai. 
</P>
<P>
Super Bowl tickets, believed supplied by owners, have served as a carrot at 
political fund-raisers, at which coaches have been enlisted to analyze the game 
for education-hungry contributors. 
</P>
<P>
One surveying the scene is willing to allow for normal larceny on the part of 
street guys turning a Super Bowl buck, but the league must labor to convince 
one it is doing enough to keep Super Bowl ticket distribution sanitary. 
</P>
<P>
In this Great American Scalp, too many seats are winding up in strange hands, 
dealing them off at strange prices. 
</P>
<P>
New Orleans has no law against scalping. All it does is prohibit this practice 
on the Superdome grounds. The scene, it feels, shouldn't be polluted by 
villainy and rascality. 
</P>
<P>
As it happens in Louisiana politics, enough explanations were required to 
justify the cost of the Superdome itself, running at the time $175 million, or 
roughly $100 million over budget. 
</P>
<P>
Their fears misplaced, the villagers in 1975 got a bargain, considering a 
stadium today costs $150 million with no roof. 
</P>

<P>
STAKES RACE FEB. 3 WILL BE SHOEMAKER'S FINAL RIDE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Anita officials have scheduled a special $100,000 stakes race on Feb. 3 
for Bill Shoemaker's final ride. 
</P>
<P>
The track announced Sunday that the race, called "The Legend's Last Ride," will 
be one mile on the turf for 4-year-olds and up. Shoemaker, 58, has won 8,833 
races in a career covering six decades. 
</P>
<P>
Shoemaker and his agent will choose his mount. 
</P>
<P>
Racing Secretary Tom Robbins talked to trainers before determining that the 
mile on grass for older horses was the most likely category available to form a 
full field. 
</P>
<P>
Nominations close Jan. 26 with weights to be assigned on Jan. 30. The race, 
with pari-mutuel betting, will be run as the fifth race on the program. The 
regular feature that day is the $200,000 La Canada Stakes for 4-year-old 
fillies. 
</P>
<P>
Shoemaker's final appearance required orchestration by track officials because 
the farewell date was selected in advance in order to be televised by ABC. 
</P>
<P>
In 1966, former champion Johnny Longden rode his final race with a victory on 
6-1 shot George Royal in the San Juan Capistrano Handicap, an annual Santa 
Anita feature. 
</P>
<P>
When Shoemaker bids farewell, the conditions for his only race of the afternoon 
will carry an unusual contingency clause. 
</P>
<P>
"This race will be Bill Shoemaker's final ride," the nomination blank reads. 
"In the event that his mount is withdrawn prior to the running of the race, any 
one of the remaining entrants' jockeys will be subject to replacement by Bill 
Shoemaker. The undersigned agrees to the aforementioned conditions that the 
undersigned's horse may be ridden by Bill Shoemaker." 
</P>
<P>
The contingency of a backup mount extends up to the start of the race, Robbins 
said. Shoemaker will be on his first choice at entry time but also will 
indicate his second and third choices, which will be made known to the public 
at that time. 
</P>
<P>
There were no such special conditions for Longden when George Royal provided 
his last ride and last winner. Longden made the decision to quit riding earlier 
that week but didn't announce his retirement until after he won with George 
Royal. 
</P>
<P>
Longden's final race was voted by the media as the most memorable event in the 
track's history. 
</P>
<P>
Shoemaker has been on a farewell tour that has taken him to three continents 
and 49 tracks. On Saturday, Shoemaker won the $50,000 Hallandale Handicap at 
Gulfstream Park, his final race on the East Coast.

SOCKERS HANDLED BY DALLAS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even in their toughest of times in past Major Indoor Soccer League seasons, the 
Sockers could count on manhandling the Dallas Sidekicks. 
</P>
<P>
Not any more. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego limped into Reunion Arena Sunday afternoon dragging a two-game losing 
streak. But instead of a quick fix, the Sockers received another swift kick, 
4-2, in front of 8,495 fans. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas, which owns the league's best record at 15-10, is 3-0 against the 
Sockers in Dallas this season. The Sockers, playing without the injured Branko 
Segota (pulled calf muscle), fell three games below .500 for the first time 
this season at 10-13. 
</P>
<P>
How bad is it for the two-time defending champions and Team of the Decade 
during the 1980s? 
</P>
<P>
"We're playing hard but the bottom line is that we're not as good as we thought 
we were," defender Kevin Crow said. "We're going to need to change some things 
to get us turned around." 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers were on the bad end of two questionable calls Sunday. But they did 
little offensively against Sidekicks' goalie Joe Papaleo. 
</P>
<P>
While Tatu got his league-leading 31st score, Dallas built a 2-0 lead after 
three quarters on a goal from Bruno Ferretti. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers appeared to take the lead, 1-0, as the first half ended when Crow's 
shot slipped through Papaleo's legs and caromed off the crossbar. But after the 
goal judge ruled a goal, referee Esse Baharmast waved it off. 
</P>
<P>
Bad break No. 2 came in the fourth quarter when a Sockers' power play cost them 
another goal and an insurmountable 3-0 deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Sidekicks' defender Mike Powers was called for a two-minute 
penalty, teammate Troy Snyder beat defender George Fernandez to a loose ball 
along the boards with what seemingly was a high kick. But with no foul call, 
Snyder played on and slipped a left-footer past goalie Victor Nogueira with 
6:30 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"I came on for five seconds and they scored," said Nogueira, who had been off 
in favor of a sixth-attacker. "It was a nightmare. It's ridiculous the way the 
goals are going in and the way things are going." 
</P>
<P>
Coach Ron Newman said the call didn't cost the Sockers the game, but it 
certainly didn't help. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy brought up his foot to George's head to go passed him," Newman said. 
"Everyone was waiting for the whistle. It was ridiculous, a terrible decision." 
</P>
<P>
Down 3-0, the Sockers got within two 1:16 later when Zoran Karic scored a 
power-play right-footer from 30 feet. But Papaleo held the Sockers scoreless 
until Smith clinched Dallas' victory with an open-netter with 1:46 left. Ben 
Collins got a meaningless header goal with three seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
But that was about the only thing that got past Papaleo, who made a season-high 
24 saves while facing a season-high 42 shots by the Sockers, including a 
season-high 26 the last 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"I was lucky today," said Papaleo, making his seventh start of the season after 
off-season knee surgery. "You can tell I went to church today. They hit a lot 
of hard balls but I was fortunate to be in front of most of them." 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers, four games behind Dallas in the West, slipped to the division 
cellar and 2-10 on the road. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not getting any good breaks so we need to be making our own," Crow said. 
"Right now things just aren't in sync."

MAMMOTH LAKES 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bring me men to match my mountains. -- SAM WALTER FOSS, "The Coming American" 
</P>
<P>
As he approaches 75, Dave McCoy might be excused if he suddenly chucked it all, 
bought a set of clubs and moved to a condo on a golf course at Rancho Mirage or 
some other resort. 
</P>
<P>
His monument, Mammoth Mountain, is secure in its position as one of the world's 
great ski resorts, its day-to-day operation in the capable hands of his son, 
Gary McCoy. Mammoth's recent acquisition, June Mountain, is being managed 
efficiently by his daughter, Kandi McCoy. So, why not relax and enjoy the 
remaining golden years in a balmier climate? 
</P>
<P>
"It's too late for me to retire now," McCoy said the other day. "And besides, 
I've never seen anyplace that I like near as much as this. It has the four 
seasons. It has all the things that go along with each season. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm here seven days a week. I put every ounce of effort into it I possibly 
can." 
</P>
<P>
Just kidding, Dave. Nobody thought you would really ever retire. There are too 
many irons in the fire: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Connecting Mammoth with June. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Helping to develop North Village. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Working with Snowcreek Resort to interconnect with the proposed new Sherwin 
Ski Area. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Providing support for the Juniper Ridge project. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, Mammoth, which already has three day-lodges and 30 lifts serving 
more than 3,500 acres of skiing terrain, is far from finished -- and neither is 
McCoy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE MAN AND HIS DREAM 
</P>
<P>
Dave McCoy was born in Los Angeles, but he said, "My father was a highway 
contractor, and I lived probably in 95% of the towns in Central California. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was 12 years old, I was over here, and saw the area and just fell in 
love with it, and said that's where I'm going to spend my life. My folks 
separated before my 13th birthday, and I really didn't see them after that for 
quite a long time. I worked on some ranches in the (San Joaquin) Valley, and 
then went to Washington where my grandparents were, up by Mt. Rainier. 
</P>
<P>
"I visited here twice, until I graduated from high school, and the minute I 
graduated, I headed for here." 
</P>
<P>
This was during the depths of the Depression, and jobs were scarce. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to work on a WPA project, an aqueduct," McCoy said, "and in the winter 
it snowed quite heavily, and they needed somebody who could ski, so I just 
transferred from the WPA project right into the regular (Los Angeles) 
Department of Water and Power. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a laborer but I was doing hydrographic work and cement work and rock 
work and everything else." 
</P>
<P>
As he skied throughout the region for the DWP, McCoy noticed that 
11,000-foot-high Mammoth Mountain, because of its location, exposure and 
bountiful snowfall, would make an ideal ski resort, but he had more immediate 
concerns, such as providing for a family. 
</P>
<P>
Just as it was love at first sight with the Eastern Sierra, his choice of a 
wife was equally quick and decisive. 
</P>
<P>
"Roma is a native of Bishop," he said, "and the first time I saw her, (I said) 
that's the gal for me." 
</P>
<P>
Before Mammoth, there was McGee Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
"I started (in the ski business, part-time) in 1936, working for . . . 
Courtlandt Hill when he had a cable lift on McGee," McCoy said. "I was just a 
handyman, so to speak. . . . And the Eastern Sierra Ski Club had their ropetows 
on McGee. I belonged to the ski club and helped with all the mechanical things 
there. 
</P>
<P>
"Corty (Hill) quit in '38, and the ski club sold me all of their ski lift 
equipment, I think it was '39. But from then on, I just used portables and put 
them wherever we wanted to put them. We had a roving permit from the Forest 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a full-time job (with the DWP) for 18 years. I didn't quit the city 
until '53. (But) we were skiing in here (on Mammoth Mountain) -- we had pretty 
good-sized ropetows -- prior to that. 
</P>
<P>
"We built the No. 1 chair in '54, and in '55 it was running. Our first little 
warming hut here was about 12 x 24, and we called it the Snake Pit." 
</P>
<P>
From that time on, there was no stopping Mammoth, as the post-World War II 
skiing boom, fueled by the 1960 Winter Olympics at Squaw Valley, and the 
population explosion in Southern California created the demand for first-class 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
McCoy grabbed on and rode the tiger's tail. 
</P>
<P>
Asked when he was finally convinced that Mammoth would make a go of it, McCoy 
didn't hesitate. "1953," he said, which was when he left the Department of 
Water and Power. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's ever been a time that I haven't questioned whether I've 
overextended (myself) or not," he said. "I just keep going as fast and as hard 
as I possibly can all the time. I never took anything out of the company, 
really, other than just to provide subsistence for the family. 
</P>
<P>
"Me and the bank have a good relationship. And the Forest Service. And the 
skiers." 
</P>
<P>
McCoy got the chance to develop Mammoth almost by default. 
</P>
<P>
Not long after World War II, he said, "a team of European and American ski 
groups and the Forest Service looked at Mammoth. (This was) before I got the 
permit to build the first chairlift. And their survey said that Mammoth was the 
least likely to be successful, of any other mountain in the country, because of 
its inaccessibility, its Alpine and high-altitude area -- and it's in a storm 
belt. 
</P>
<P>
"So, I put all those things together and kept working with them while everybody 
else ignored us. 
</P>
<P>
"The Forest Service had put out a prospectus for a big development here, but 
that (survey) scared everybody off, so the Forest Service asked me if I wanted 
to try to do it. I said sure, I'll try. I had nothing to lose. It was left wide 
open for me." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE MOUNTAIN 
</P>
<P>
Mammoth Mountain averages about 335 inches of snow a year, and it's not unusual 
for it to open by Columbus Day, in October, and close on the following Fourth 
of July. The terrain is about 30% advanced, 40% intermediate and 30% beginner, 
and the maximum vertical drop is 3,100 feet. 
</P>
<P>
The two gondolas, 26 chairlifts and two surface lifts have a total uphill 
capacity of 43,000 skiers an hour. Of course, not that many are ever on the 
slopes at the same time, although it may seem like it on a crowded holiday 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Mammoth, however, has never had to cut off lift-ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't (set a limit)," McCoy said. "They just kind of seem to set their own 
quota. Even if they're here, they're skating or they're bike-riding or 
cross-country skiing or just hiking or shopping. There's so many things that 
they can do, and they seem to just take turns, on their own. 
</P>
<P>
"We have never limited the skier. We always thought we'd have to, but they do a 
good job (on their own)." 
</P>
<P>
Although Mammoth, located about 300 miles north of Los Angeles via California 
14 and U.S. 395, attracts its biggest turnouts on the weekends, McCoy has no 
special plans for trying to boost midweek business. 
</P>
<P>
"If you look at Mammoth during top season," he said, "how many (midweek skiers) 
does any other destination resort, say Sun Valley, have -- 2,000 to 3,000 
people . . . It's not uncommon for us to have 8,000 to 10,000 people on a 
weekday. . . . And 10,000 people on the mountain is nothing. We cover about 
3,500 acres, and they just have all kinds of Alpine open skiing on the upper 
part of the mountain. You can't count those as acres or runs -- that's just 
space. So, you don't even know that there's anybody here with 10,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
"Just from our driving range of 300 miles -- well, San Diego is a little 
farther than that -- we must have 14 million people. So, we'll never get away 
from that weekend influx. 
</P>
<P>
"Even with all the acreage and all the lifts we have, we still don't try to go 
out and bring people outside of California in. We don't have to. We're happy 
the way we are, really. 
</P>
<P>
"But there will be a day as we expand and make what we call a "ski circus" out 
of it (that we will do that)." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE MOUNTAIN II 
</P>
<P>
June Mountain is another half-hour north on U.S. 395. It is about one-seventh 
the size of Mammoth and has seven chairlifts plus a state-of-the-art QMC 
tramway that carries skiers from the parking lot to mid-mountain. 
</P>
<P>
McCoy's plan is to eliminate the half-hour drive and enable skiers to ski and 
ride lifts between Mammoth and June, which he purchased in the summer of 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Explaining how he happened to buy June, McCoy said: "Bud Hayward (of Tustin) 
had June Mountain for 23 years, and it was actually one step from bankruptcy. 
Bud and I always got along real good, and he didn't want to turn loose of it 
for love nor money. I kept telling him that if there was ever a time when he 
wanted to get out of it, I'd see that he got a fair deal. And I would look at 
him as the pioneer who saved it for somebody to develop in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"We just had a handshake deal that if it ever came to that time, he would 
approach me, and that's exactly what happened. I made him a deal he couldn't 
turn down. I was glad to do it, because I felt he had put his heart and soul 
into it. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, even though June is small, it has the greatest percentage of any ski area 
in the business today of high-capacity units. It has two high-speed quads and 
the QMC, which we put in. 
</P>
<P>
"We're really happy with it, and now, it will make it more possible to connect 
the two. 
</P>
<P>
"Probably 12 or 15 (lifts would be needed to connect Mammoth and June, at a 
minimum). You could do it like a sawtooth, going up and down. (Or) you could 
actually connect them with one transportation system. We could take a baseline 
lift and go from here to June so that wherever you got up high enough, you'd 
ski down into a station on the transportation system. 
</P>
<P>
"So conceivably, you could build that lift and then pick one or two of the most 
desirable canyons or ridges or peaks, whatever, and develop them first, and you 
could do it with three or four lifts. . . . It would be a cable system of some 
kind. You can have angle stations and on-and-off stations. (Eventually,) that's 
what I see, that every major collecting point, like a canyon, may have five 
lifts in one big canyon, and where it would funnel out, then that would hit the 
transportation system. 
</P>
<P>
"You could do it with a smaller number (of lifts), but I would think before 
it's over, there are so many places out there to ski, you'd probably put in 50 
lifts. There'd (also) be some base facilities out there. Just like here, we 
have to put a base facility over at Chair 15 and probably another at Chair 4. 
We have to make skiing more convenient, easier and more enjoyable." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he thought there might be any opposition to such a project from 
environmentalists, McCoy said: "I really don't think so. I think they'll just 
keep an eye on us like they always do and make sure we do it, in their eyes, 
the way that it's right and proper, and to the best of our ability. 
</P>
<P>
"The Sierra Club realizes just like everybody else does that there has to be a 
place for the numbers of people to recreate and get out and really enjoy it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE FUTURE IS NOW 
</P>
<P>
The three new developments -- North Village, Snowcreek with its proposed 
Sherwin Ski Area, and Juniper Ridge -- are in various stages of development by 
other entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he was in favor of all three going ahead as planned, McCoy said: "You 
betcha." 
</P>
<P>
He also foresees the day when Mammoth Lakes Airport will be expanded to 
accommodate the larger jets of a major airline or two. At present, Alpha Air 
offers daily small-jet service from LAX's Imperial Terminal, Burbank, San 
Diego, Oakland and San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
"A 727 can land on this strip now," he said. "It's adequate. Occasionally, 
you'll see one down there (with a charter group). 
</P>
<P>
"I think when we get the bigger hotels, the full-service hotels, then 
(expansion of the airport) will happen. It looks like they're sitting there, 
ready to come on -- (the airport would) just piggyback right on that. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what the North Village is all about, and Juniper Ridge, and then Tom 
Dempsey out in the meadow is figuring on three full-service hotels -- at 
Snowcreek. They'll make a regular center out there. It will be beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
As for Mammoth's potential involvement in the proposed Sherwin Ski Area, which 
would be adjacent to Snowcreek and southeast of Mammoth, McCoy said: "If 
Dempsey doesn't (develop the ski area), and he comes to us to see if we'll do 
it, we would maybe consider. I don't know. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to try to interconnect (our lifts) regardless, and I would hope 
(the first lifts at Sherwin) would be ready within two years." 
</P>
<P>
A hearing was held by the Inyo National Forest here last Saturday to obtain 
public reaction to the Draft Environmental Impact Statement for the Sherwin Ski 
Area, and written comments on the proposal will be accepted by the U.S. Forest 
Service, c/o Dennis Martin, 873 N. Main St., Bishop, CA. 93514, providing they 
are postmarked no later than today. 
</P>
<P>
Regarding Juniper Ridge, McCoy said: "Whenever the hotel and condominiums, and 
all that, go in over there (adjacent to Mammoth, between the Lake Mary Road 
bridge and the base area of Chairs 15 and 24), then we would build a base lodge 
at the same time (at Chair 15). 
</P>
<P>
"North Village is right at the bottom, in town here. That's going to be a great 
development, a walk-around village. We have people now bidding for the project. 
</P>
<P>
"We owned a lot of the base land right there. That's the only land that I ever 
held onto. I gave properties away and stayed out of the real estate in town, 
because I wanted the people there to kind of guide their own destiny. I don't 
want any involvement with them, other than to help or support them wherever we 
can." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BUT IS BIGGER BETTER? 
</P>
<P>
McCoy acknowledges that one of the appeals of skiing is that it allows people 
to find some elbow room outdoors, away from the crowded freeways and housing 
developments. So, why is he in favor of all this intensive development, and how 
can the congestion be minimized? 
</P>
<P>
"That goes back to your (talk that Mammoth needs to be more of a) destination 
resort," he said. "The destination resorts that we know of, like Sun Valley or 
Aspen or Vail, that's what they are, they're really a congested area where 
people get really tight together. Mammoth is spread out, and you do have that 
quiet and that enjoyable privilege of being private, you might say, when you're 
off the hill. And I think a lot of people really like that about June, also, 
because it's very much the same way. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's why Mammoth spread out like it did. Otherwise, we'd have just 
had two or three great big base hotels, and each one take 3,000 or 4,000 people 
apiece, like they do in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"North Village . . . will be a walk-around center with underground parking. You 
bring your car in and leave it. (But) I don't see making a parking lot near 395 
and bringing people in, because of the numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"That would really be a problem (for Southern California people). They live 
with their cars, they really do, and I think the more convenient we make it for 
them to use their vehicles, the more they're going to like it. 
</P>
<P>
"But once they get settled in, if we can get transportation systems into the 
higher-density areas -- they like that, also. And they're now using our free 
shuttle (buses) a lot." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WILL SKIERS KEEP COMING? 
</P>
<P>
On the negative said, one of the raps against skiing is that it is too 
expensive. It's easy to spend $2,000 or more just to get started -- with one 
pair of skis, poles and boots and one outfit. Throw in the travel, lodging, 
meal and apres-ski costs, and the price of an all-day lift ticket actually 
becomes a minor item. 
</P>
<P>
At Mammoth and June, it's $35, which McCoy said is less than adequate to keep 
pace with rising expenses, although he believes the overall costs are not 
especially exorbitant. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really see (skiing) being too expensive (when) you compare it with any 
other recreation, or anything else like a car or food costs," McCoy said. 
"We've kept within that same area, and we're still able to develop a little, 
but slower. We don't have near the income to develop like we used to . . . say, 
up to three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"The expense now is . . . like our power expenses have changed. It used to be, 
the more kilowatts you used, the cheaper it got. Now, the more they have to 
supply you, the more it costs you, averaged throughout the year. And the 
equipment demand that the skier puts on us . . . like grooming equipment we 
used to buy for $25,000, now it's $175,000 for just one piece of machinery. 
</P>
<P>
"The chairlifts that are being replaced, some of them we bought years ago for a 
couple of hundred thousand (dollars), and some recently -- the fixed grips -- 
for $500,000. Now, a good quad detachable costs you three to four million 
bucks. 
</P>
<P>
"(Lift-ticket increases) haven't kept pace. So, our margin is a lot less. I 
thought there was (skier resistance) to paying more, but apparently there 
really isn't, because they see the quality, and we're trying to give them what 
they want. The sport is actually growing, as far as we're concerned. 
</P>
<P>
"Skiing has been so good to us here at Mammoth that I can't help but just want 
to return it to the skier and see that they have a better place to recreate." 
</P>
<P>
Dave and Roma McCoy show no signs of slowing down, but they have gradually 
concentrated more on enjoying themselves, turning over some of their duties to 
their children, all of whom grew up on skis, racing and learning all facets of 
the sport. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got six kids, 16 grandchildren and a great-grandchild," McCoy said, "and 
we still ride bicycles and ride horses and ski all day and just have a ball. 
</P>
<P>
"I hurt myself pretty bad about six years ago on a motorcycle. I tried to get 
right back out there (on the slopes) and stayed with it, but it took me awhile 
to feel comfortable again." 
</P>
<P>
Four of the McCoys' offspring are still around. 
</P>
<P>
"Gary is the manager of Mammoth," McCoy said. "Kandi is the manager of June. 
Penny is in special events both here and at June, and Randy is the pilot for 
Mammoth. 
</P>
<P>
"Poncho raises cattle. He has a big cattle ranch in Montana, and we use a lot 
of his animals. We use them for hamburger and steaks in the restaurant . . . 
all of the meat we can. And Carl -- "Peanut" -- is up in Canada. He has a 
little ranch and just kind of likes the quiet; he likes the outdoors very much. 
It's just too populated for him here. 
</P>
<P>
"In racing, Penny and Poncho did the best, because they could put up with the 
politics." 
</P>
<P>
In the late 1960s, McCoy was mentioned as a possible coach of the U.S. Ski 
Team, but he said: "I never even let 'em think that I would consider it, 
because I was too busy here. 
</P>
<P>
"When any of the kids left here (to race on the national level), I didn't 
interfere at all. I didn't try to coach them or anything, but we'd always 
communicate. I probably got more telephone calls from Europe than anyone could 
imagine. 
</P>
<P>
"They're still all great kids. They've all grown up. They're in businesses for 
themselves and all had good eductions. That's what I really pushed more than 
the skiing." 
</P>
<P>
So, Mammoth remains in good hands, according to McCoy, who has one other goal, 
improbable as it may be: "I hope I live another hundred years so I can develop 
Mammoth as big as it should be."

PALO ALTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's a hotel maid's nightmare. Strewn about the unkempt bed are three 
newspapers, each opened to the sports section, a tattered flight guide, airline 
tickets and reading glasses. A suitcase lies open on the couch. The floor is 
littered with shorts, a T-shirt, running shoes and a damp towel. 
</P>
<P>
There, in the middle of the mess, with one pillow tucked between his feet, 
another underneath his left side and the telephone an arm's length away, is 
Bobby Beathard. 
</P>
<P>
Beathard, who in the past two weeks has been to Washington, Chicago, San Diego, 
Cleveland, Denver, Honolulu, Los Angeles, back to Denver, Mobile, Ala., and 
Palo Alto, rubs his eyes, yawns and says: 
</P>
<P>
"Man, I'm really beat. All of this travel, I think, has finally caught up to 
me. I'm so out of shape right now, I couldn't even run a marathon if I had to. 
You know, I wouldn't even enter one because I'd be afraid I'd drop out. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm only running about 45 miles a week now. I should be running 65 miles. Look 
at me. I normally weigh the same as I did in high school, 165, but you know, I 
bet I weigh 169 right now. Gosh, maybe 170. I can really tell the difference." 
</P>
<P>
Beathard, a vegetarian, chastises himself for the extra bran muffin he ate 
earlier in the day, vowing to be back in shape by March, running 12 miles a 
day, surfing the waves of Leucadia, riding his bicycle through the hills of 
Encinitas and La Costa and swimming laps in the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
This is a guy who talks as if he's representing the U.S. Olympic team, dresses 
as if he just stepped out of class at San Diego State and has more fun than the 
boys in the local fraternity house. 
</P>
<P>
Which is more frightening, you might ask: the fact that he will turn 53 years 
old Wednesday or the idea that he'll be running the Charger football 
operations, sitting behind his desk as general manager for the first time this 
morning? 
</P>
<P>
"That town better brace itself and get ready for Bobby," said Ted Grossman, 
Beathard's best friend, who makes his living as a Hollywood stunt man. "I'm 
telling you right now, there's no one like him. No one." 
</P>
<P>
Just what do you mean? 
</P>
<P>
"Well, let me put it to you this way," Grossman said, laughing mischievously. 
"I get a call late at night a few weeks ago, and it's Bobby. Remember, this is 
right in the middle of when he was signing with the Chargers, he's still 
working for NBC, the playoffs are going on, and he's traveling back and forth 
across the country . 
</P>
<P>
"So the first thing he tells me is how happy he is. I figure something great 
happened with the Chargers or something great happened with the family, you 
know, something real big. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, he tells me how Christine, his wife, just bought him this new surfboard. 
I'm serious. He goes on and on about it. He's telling the length of it, the 
color of it, everything. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, it was unbelievable. All of this stuff is happening in his life at 
once, and he's going nuts about some surfboard. 
</P>
<P>
"But, you know, that's Bobby." 
</P>
<P>
It was during training camp in 1978, six months after he became general manager 
of the Washington Redskins, that Beathard and Christine Van Handel, his second 
wife, got married. 
</P>
<P>
The wedding took place at a mutual friend's house in Marina del Rey. There was 
a delay until Christine walked upstairs where the men were watching an 
exhibition game between the Rams and Raiders, and said, "Bobby, shouldn't we 
start?" 
</P>
<P>
Bobby: "We're watching the game, can't we wait until halftime?" 
</P>
<P>
Halftime arrived. Beathard rushed downstairs. Before the first beer commercial, 
he was back upstairs with his buddies watching the game. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the fastest wedding I've ever seen," Grossman says. "It was faster than 
Ben Johnson on steroids. I mean, I was just turning around when Bobby already 
is putting the ring on Christine's finger. The next thing I know, it's over, 
and we're going back upstairs to watch the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember Christine saying, 'Is this the way it's always going to be?' 
</P>
<P>
"Bobby said, 'I'm afraid so.' " 
</P>
<P>
Yes, in the staunch, conservative world of the NFL, where many of the game's 
administrators are balding, cigar-smoking, overweight men, there is Bobby. 
</P>
<P>
Not Bob. Not Robert. And certainly not Mr. Beathard. 
</P>
<P>
Just Bobby. 
</P>
<P>
Few in this game have matched his success, winning four Super Bowls and guiding 
his team into two others during stays in Miami and Washington. And none, 
perhaps, are as unpretentious. 
</P>
<P>
After all, when you see a man wearing shorts and running shoes for everyday 
dress, and light-colored slacks, a polo shirt and top-siders for formal wear, 
you don't exactly picture an NFL general manager. 
</P>
<P>
Beathard doesn't even pack a sports jacket on road trips. Once when he realized 
it was a necessity that he have one, he stopped off at an airport gift shop and 
bought the first one off the rack that fit him. 
</P>
<P>
Redskins owner Jack Kent Cooke said he was warned of Beathard's casual dress 
when he interviewed him for the general manager's job in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Beathard: "I've got to tell you something, I work hard, but I don't go to 
social engagements, and I don't wear a coat and tie." 
</P>
<P>
Cooke: "Bobby, I don't care if you work in a jockstrap as long as you win." 
</P>
<P>
And, oh, how Beathard won. There's enough gold and diamonds on the four Super 
Bowl championship rings he owns to make Mr. T envious. 
</P>
<P>
But not once has Beathard worn any of them. Sure, each represents a great 
achievement, but they're too gaudy for Beathard's taste. 
</P>
<P>
So, while the rest of the NFL would give just about anything to earn one of 
these sacred Super Bowl rings, guess how Beathard regards his symbolic 
treasures. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a day when I was at Bobby's house, and I cut my finger," Grossman 
said, "and I asked Bobby where I could find a Band-Aid. He tells me to look in 
the medicine cabinet below the sink. I pull out the Band-Aid box, and I can't 
believe it, there's a Super Bowl ring. 
</P>
<P>
"I say to Bobby, 'What the hell's your Super Bowl ring doing down here?' He 
says, 'Oh, I was wondering where that thing went.' 
</P>
<P>
"Can you imagine? People bust their asses for these Super Bowl rings, and 
there's Bobby keeping his behind a damn Band-Aid box." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, that's Bobby. 
</P>
<P>
He's fiercely competitive, whether he's running, surfing, cycling or running a 
football team. He strives to be the best in anything he does but couldn't care 
less about the accolades and prizes that accompany success. He's still annoyed 
at Sports Illustrated for calling him "The Smartest Man in the NFL." Fact is, 
his most prized treasures are the T-shirts he has received from the 38 
marathons in which he has run. 
</P>
<P>
It angers him that his right hamstring flares up from time to time, preventing 
him from training for marathons the way he desires. He consistently runs under 
three hours for the 26.2 miles but would sure like to lower his personal best 
of 2:46:11. Oh well, he says, that's what he gets for running those three 
marathons and a half-marathon in five weekends a few years ago, causing the 
initial hamstring damage. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Daniels, Redskin director of player personnel (league sources say he will 
take the same job with the Chargers when his contract expires in June), said: 
"I remember when it all started. We used to run together in the morning at 
Miami, just a couple of miles each day through the zoo, and then one day he got 
this wild look in his eye and said, 'I'm going to run over to the causeway.' I 
said, 'Bobby, that's eight miles.' He took off anyway, and he's been running 
like that ever since. 
</P>
<P>
"Even now when I run with him, I say, 'OK, now, Bobby, let's go slow.' He says, 
'OK, OK.' Well, before you know it, he's taken off, and I'm turning back." 
</P>
<P>
Beathard's buddies still like to talk about the time during the mid-'70s when 
they were sitting in a Manhattan Beach bar, and word started traveling that 
this All-American community college quarter-miler could beat Beathard in a 
four-mile race. 
</P>
<P>
Well, one thing led to another, and before anyone knew it, bets were placed, 
and Beathard was on the track in his bare feet ready to go. 
</P>
<P>
"The race is about to start," Grossman said, "and then Bobby lets me know he 
hardly got any sleep from the scouting trip he just finished. I said, 'Oh, man, 
don't tell me that. I just bet 100 bucks on you.' And these were the days I 
didn't have two nickels to rub together. I'm really panicking now. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, it's neck-to-neck the whole way. This guy's right on Bobby's heels the 
entire time, and with about 200 yards to go, Bobby turns on the hydroplanes. He 
sprints toward the finish line, and the other guy stops like he's running in 
place and keels over. 
</P>
<P>
"Bobby's still running, and this guy's eyes are rolling in the back of his 
head. He's foaming at the mouth. . . . I thought, 'Oh my God, Bobby just killed 
this guy.' 
</P>
<P>
"We called the paramedics and everything. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy got out of the hospital three days later." 
</P>
<P>
Now, Beathard has been challenged again, and some say this is his greatest 
obstacle yet. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers have not been in the playoffs since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
They have lost 28 of their past 40 games. 
</P>
<P>
Beathard has heard the whispers. He has listened to the warnings. He has 
received all of the advice. 
</P>
<P>
Don't take the Charger job, they told him. You don't want to work for that 
meddlesome Charger owner, Alex Spanos. It's a dead-end job that ultimately 
results in a firing, usually around the Christmas holidays. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going into this thing with my eyes wide open," Beathard said, "but you 
know something, I have a real good feeling about Spanos. 
</P>
<P>
"I know there has been a lot of stuff written and a lot of shots taken at him. 
But I've met him, and personally, I think he's a hell of a guy. I'm not just 
saying that so it looks good. I've been with him enough to know that he can 
laugh at himself, he has a great sense of humor, and there's genuinely a nice 
part of this guy. 
</P>
<P>
"I think things are going to be fun again." 
</P>
<P>
Beathard has already moved to improve a strained relationship between the 
Charger front office and the media. Practices will again be open, after Coach 
Dan Henning closed them for the season last fall. 
</P>
<P>
And Beathard's arrival also has caused visions of grandeur in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
After all, didn't Cooke offer Beathard a huge raise to prevent him from leaving 
the Redskins last May? And didn't the New York Jets and Detroit Lions offer him 
lucrative contracts to take over their struggling programs? And, hey, didn't 
NBC even step forward and try their best to convince Beathard to stay with the 
network? 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone knows what Bobby Beathard will mean to San Diego," said George Young, 
general manager of the New York Giants. "This is a guy who's 52 going on 22. 
He's got more energy than anyone in the business. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought all along that San Diego was a sleeping giant anyway, but now with 
Bobby there, well, let's just say I'm glad we don't play the AFC West for 
another three years. 
</P>
<P>
"It won't surprise me one bit to see that team in the playoffs this year." 
</P>
<P>
Beathard has been sought by Spanos since 1986, but when Beathard informed him 
that he was going to remain with the Redskins, Spanos tried the next-best 
thing: He asked for Beathard's recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
Beathard recommended Steve Ortmayer of the Raiders. Spanos hired him on Jan. 
27, 1987. He fired him on Dec. 18, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, sources close to Spanos said, the decision to fire Ortmayer was made 
before the season. When Beathard quit the Redskins on May 5, after a growing 
rift between him and Coach Joe Gibbs had become intolerable, Spanos immediately 
called. They had several telephone conversations, and sources said that Spanos 
even sent him a contract proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Beathard felt awkward because of his relationship with Ortmayer, and besides, 
he wanted to step away from the game for a few months. NBC called Beathard in 
July to work on pregame and halftime features, and Beathard figured this was 
the perfect opportunity to stay close to the game without being directly 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, he always knew that he would be back in the NFL for the 1990 season -- why 
else was he gone three days every week scouting? -- but he wasn't sure where. 
</P>
<P>
By early December, offers starting rolling in, according to sources close to 
Beathard. The Jets offered him a job. So did the Lions. Each wanted him before 
the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Now it was time to see if Spanos' interest still remained. Spanos assured him 
that it was. Beathard also was told he'd have a free hand running the team. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ortmayer heard the rumors that Beathard was coming in, and after the 
Chargers' victory over the Kansas City Chiefs, he decided to travel to Stockton 
to find out the truth from Spanos. Ortmayer left that afternoon unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an awkward situation because Steve and I are friends," Beathard said, 
"well, I hope we're still friends. I've left a couple messages on his answering 
machine, but he hasn't called back. 
</P>
<P>
"This game is all based on performance. Who knows? Someday someone might come 
in here and take my place." 
</P>
<P>
The muddy parking lot at Stanford Stadium is filled with a crowd of hundreds 
waiting for players to arrive for practice of the East-West Shrine game. There 
are scouts, coaches, friends and agents. Lots of agents. 
</P>
<P>
Beathard glares at the agents in their dark Italian suits, acting like piranhas 
in an aquarium filled with guppies. It makes Beathard sick. Oh, some of his 
dear friends happen to be agents. But too many, he says, are ruining this 
precious game of football. 
</P>
<P>
What happened to the days when guys just wanted to play good, old-fashioned 
football and didn't worry about their contracts until they established 
themselves in the league. It has gotten to a point now, he says, that he has to 
act as an amateur psychologist when talking to players and determining their 
motivation. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, Beathard just makes it simple on himself. There are four agents 
whose clients Beathard will not draft, no matter how talented they are. 
</P>
<P>
"So much goes into the equation nowadays," Beathard says. "Who's the guy who 
represents him? What kind of influence will his agent have on him? What 
influence is money going to have? Is he going to be satisfied, once he gets his 
large signing bonus, thinking, 'I got my money, I got my new car,' and not bust 
his butt to make the team.' 
</P>
<P>
"If you find out how a player is going to think, you're a step ahead. It's too 
bad the system is the way it is, it's upside down. The untested people get the 
money, and the other ones, the guys who have done it, are sitting there 
wondering why the untested guys are making more. 
</P>
<P>
"Why should Deion Sanders (of Atlanta) be the highest-paid defensive back in 
football. That's totally unfair. And when they see the way he's playing, it 
really affects people. Because this guy does not play the game like his ability 
would enable him to play the game. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't compare Barry Sanders (of Detroit) and Deion Sanders. Barry Sanders 
is going out there and laying it on the line. He's playing harder than anybody, 
and that rubs off on his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"Deion hasn't done that. I don't know if he'll ever do it." 
</P>
<P>
Beathard's ability to judge people always has separated him from the rest of 
the pack. How else was he able to have 26 free agents, and 11 players drafted 
in the fifth round or lower, on his 1983 Super Bowl team? 
</P>
<P>
"He's totally unafraid of taking chances," said Dick Steinberg, the Jets' 
general manager. "The typical approach in the NFL is go slow, be conservative, 
be careful when you make trades. If your trades go bad, you look bad. 
</P>
<P>
"Bobby could care less. He goes full speed and never looks back. I don't think 
he looks back on anything he does." 
</P>
<P>
Well, except for that one little incident this past summer. 
</P>
<P>
Beathard, spending the summer at his three-year-old Leucadia home that 
overlooks the beach, decided to compete in the World Body Surfing Championships 
at the Oceanside Pier. He never before had participated in a body-surfing 
contest and figured this was as good a time as any. 
</P>
<P>
Well, Beathard breezed through the preliminaries and suddenly found himself in 
the finals of his age group. The top two qualifiers advanced to the World 
Finals. 
</P>
<P>
This is great, Beathard thought, and he mapped out a strategy to guarantee a 
top-two finish. The rules are that you must catch at least four waves in a 
12-minute period, and judges will score your best four rides. 
</P>
<P>
What transpired still irritates Beathard every time he thinks about it. 
</P>
<P>
Let him tell the story: 
</P>
<P>
"There's one guy who had more points than me going to the finals, a guy named 
'Boom-Boom Beach.' I thought this is the guy I have to beat, and I knew I could 
compete with him. 
</P>
<P>
"But what happens is that because there were a few big swells coming in, 
Boom-Boom goes way outside. I'm thinking that's what I should do, too. So I go 
the exact opposite of my strategy of catching my four quick waves and go out to 
the big sets with Boom-Boom. 
</P>
<P>
"This is unbelievable. Oh, God was I mad. We're out there for seven minutes 
five seconds, and not one set comes. We're the only two guys in the heat who 
hadn't caught a wave yet. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, we start swimming in and swimming in, and finally get some medium waves. 
We didn't get our fourth wave until there were 11 seconds left, and we bombed 
out completely. 
</P>
<P>
"We should have finished one-two in our heat and gone to the (world) finals, 
but instead I finish fifth and he finishes sixth. How embarrassing. I realize 
now the most important thing is to catch your four waves and then go out and 
gamble." 
</P>
<P>
So, uh, Bobby, you don't go around and spread this story to your buddies in the 
NFL, do you?

"Hey, we've heard it all," Young said. "We know all about his surfing, marathon 
running, and all those granola bars and sardines he eats." 
</P>
<P>
Pretty crazy stuff, huh? You imagine the people around the league get a pretty 
big kick out of telling Bobby Beathard stories around the office. 
</P>
<P>
"No, to tell you the truth," Young said, "I think we're all pretty envious."

The defender falls down. You're suddenly wide open. You break downfield and 
look back for the pass. It's in the air. It's coming down on the wrong side but 
you turn around and catch it. 
</P>
<P>
There's no one between you and the end zone. The defender closes in from 
behind, attempts a diving tackle, but you break loose and score. 
</P>
<P>
It's a 70-yard touchdown pass play. 
</P>
<P>
Your team wins and is on the way to the Super Bowl. You are one of the stars. 
O.J. Simpson interviews you on national television in the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
It's the things dreams are made of. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had a lot of dreams like that," said Michael Young. "I just never thought 
I'd live it." 
</P>
<P>
Live it he did. His 70-yard touchdown reception was one of the biggest plays in 
the Denver Broncos' 37-21 victory over the Cleveland Browns in the AFC 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
Young also caught a pass for a 53-yard gain to set up a touchdown, almost 
scoring on that play as well. 
</P>
<P>
"I still don't think it's all sunk in yet," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Young, a Ram reject a year ago, is in Sunday's Super Bowl, and coming off the 
biggest game of his five-year pro career as a wide receiver. 
</P>
<P>
After the game, as Young was walking off the field, someone from ABC's "Good 
Morning America" came up to him to make arrangements to have him appear on the 
show. 
</P>
<P>
When Young got to the locker room, the Broncos' public relations director told 
him "CBS This Morning" wanted him to appear on that show. 
</P>
<P>
As things developed, the representatives from the two shows got in a 
semi-argument. 
</P>
<P>
"Can you believe it?" Young said. "The networks were fighting over me." 
</P>
<P>
"Good Morning America" won out, and a crew showed up at Young's home in 
suburban Denver the next morning at 3:15 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"I had only gotten two hours of sleep," Young said. "Jill (Young's wife) and I 
got home from the game about 7 p.m., and I had to call my family." 
</P>
<P>
Young's family is a big one. Young's parents, his brother, his sister and most 
of his relatives live in Visalia, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
"I made at least 10 calls," Young said. "I was on the phone for about three 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
"Finally, I made myself a drink and Jill and I got to bed at about 10:30. But I 
woke up at 12:30 and couldn't get back to sleep. I was just too wound up. Then 
the people from 'Good Morning America' arrived." 
</P>
<P>
Young's state of euphoria didn't last long. 
</P>
<P>
That morning a call came from Visalia with bad news. Jill's father, Don 
Britten, who has been battling cancer, had taken a turn for the worse and had 
been hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
The Youngs and their daughter Christine, who turns 2 on Feb. 3, were on the 
next plane to Fresno, which is 45 miles north of Visalia. 
</P>
<P>
Britten, 58, a retired veterinarian, is more than just a father-in-law to 
Young. The two have known each other since Michael and Jill met in junior high, 
and a close relationship developed over the years. 
</P>
<P>
Britten, while marlin fishing in Mexico eight years ago, came down with 
hepatitis, an inflammation of the liver. 
</P>
<P>
The disease worsened to a point where only a liver transplant would save 
Britten's life. Arrangements were made with the UCLA Medical Center a little 
over two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
While he waited for a compatible liver to be found, which took more than two 
months, Britten and his wife Wannie stayed with Michael and Jill at their home 
in Mission Viejo. They had to stay in Southern California because they couldn't 
be more than 1 1/2 hours from the hospital. Visalia is about 3 1/2 hours away. 
</P>
<P>
After the transplant, Britten was put on anti-rejection drugs. Without them, 
Britten's body would reject the liver and he would die. But taking them meant 
risking other diseases. That's one of the side effects of the drugs. One's 
resistence is torn down. 
</P>
<P>
Cancer first showed up in Britten's colon. Chemotherapy was out because of the 
anti-rejection drugs. The cancer spread and eventually settled into the bones. 
</P>
<P>
Young said Britten was in and out of consciousness when he visited him last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
"His condition is getting worse," Young said, a sadness detected in his voice. 
"Our prayers are with him. He's really had a tough time. If things don't take a 
turn for the better, the one positive is that he'll be going to a place where 
he won't be sick any more." 
</P>
<P>
Young returned to Denver last Thursday and went straight from the airport to 
practice. Jill stayed in Visalia, but is planning to join her husband in New 
Orleans on Thursday, flying on a special charter from Denver with the rest of 
the Bronco wives. 
</P>
<P>
For Young, his father-in-law's condition has provided a heavy dose of reality. 
</P>
<P>
"Something like this makes you realize the Super Bowl is just a game," he said. 
"There are so many other things that are so important." 
</P>
<P>
That Young, who played at UCLA and was drafted by the Rams in the sixth round 
in 1985, is even in the Super Bowl is somewhat of an amazing story. 
</P>
<P>
He played for the Rams for four seasons, spending the last two on the 
sidelines. He had only four catches during his third season and two his fourth. 
He finished the 1988 season on injured reserve. The Rams had put him there to 
make room for Ron Brown, who decided to come out of retirement. 
</P>
<P>
Young considered attempting to come back for a fifth season with the Rams even 
though the team chose not to protect him under the new Plan B rules. 
</P>
<P>
Under Plan B, a team can protect 37 players. The rest are free to sign with any 
team. 
</P>
<P>
Young talked to Coach John Robinson, who suggested he concentrate on special 
teams play. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not that type of player who enjoys running down the field and hitting 
someone," Young said. "I don't mind being hit, but I don't like to hit. 
</P>
<P>
"The Rams had four receivers. I don't know what I would have done had Ron Brown 
decided to retire again. Maybe I would have come back. I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
As it was, Young, who serves as his own agent, shopped himself around. He went 
to Denver for a tryout, and the people there were particularly impressed with 
his speed. He ran the 40 in 4.5. 
</P>
<P>
"Because I'm white, people stereotype me as being a possession receiver," Young 
said. "That means I can't run fast enough to go deep but I can catch the ball 
on short-yardage situations. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess that's not so bad. At least people say I can catch the ball. It'd be 
worse if they said I was slow and had bad hands, too. 
</P>
<P>
"But anybody who's ever played with me knows I have speed, and that's what 
counts." 
</P>
<P>
Young's statistics make a pretty good case for him being miscast as only a 
possession receiver. He caught 22 passes for 402 yards during the regular 
season. That's an average of 18.3 yards per catch. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos' Ricky Nattiel also averaged 18.3 yards, but he had only 10 
receptions. Steve Sewell, who had 25 receptions, averaged 16.6, and Vance 
Johnson, who caught 76 passes, averaged 14.4. Mark Jackson caught 28 passes and 
averaged 15.9. 
</P>
<P>
Young averaged 61.5 yards per catch in the AFC title game. That's pretty tough 
to beat. 
</P>
<P>
Young's speed is something he inherited from his father Bill, a 49.9 second, 
440 man at Tulare High in the late '40s and early '50s, which is back when a 
49.9 time was really something. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Young wasn't the only track star at Tulare. Bob Mathias, who went on to 
win two Olympic decathlons, also went to Tulare, although he was two years 
ahead of Young. 
</P>
<P>
When Michael, the youngest of Bill and Diane Young's three children, was a 
youngster, his father started a club track team for boys in the Visalia area. 
</P>
<P>
When Michael was 10, he ran the 100-yard dash in 11.9, which for his age was 
one of the fastest times in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Michael was also a Little League baseball star and went on to become a star in 
both football and baseball at Visalia's Mt. Whitney High. 
</P>
<P>
He also was on the track team briefly as a senior, and without much training or 
conditioning, ran a 9.7 in the 100. 
</P>
<P>
In football, Young was a prep All-American, helping Mt. Whitney win the San 
Joaquin Valley championship in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Mt. Whitney beat cross-town rival Redwood, 21-7, in the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
"This may sound a little strange, but just playing in that game is still my 
biggest thrill in sports," said Young, even though the AFC title game is fresh 
in his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"You know how they say the hair on the back of your neck stands up and chills 
run down your spine. Well, that's what I felt during the pregame introductions 
when we played Redwood. 
</P>
<P>
"I have never had that feeling since. Maybe I will Sunday."
