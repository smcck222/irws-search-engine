ROBERT WEITMAN, 84; INNOVATOR IN ERA OF BIG BANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robert M. Weitman, a retired film studio executive credited with instituting 
the Big Band policy at the Paramount Theater in New York City where Frank 
Sinatra first took the nation by storm, died Friday in his sleep. He was 84 and 
lived in Trousdale Estates. 
</P>
<P>
Born in New York City, Weitman was graduated from Cornell University and joined 
the Paramount Managers Training School. He was assigned to various theaters in 
Manhattan before becoming managing director of Paramount's flagship Times 
Square film house in 1935. 
</P>
<P>
During his tenure the theater introduced a policy of displaying the Big Bands 
of the day, among them the Tommy Dorsey band with Sinatra, Benny Goodman, Harry 
James and others. 
</P>
<P>
Later he became vice president of the Paramount houses in the South and after 
the theaters and studios were forced into separate ownership by legal decree in 
1949, became a vice president of program and talent development for American 
Broadcasting Theater Corp. with responsibility for about 1,500 houses. 
</P>
<P>
He went to work for CBS television as a program developer in 1956, MGM-TV in 
1960 and then became vice president in charge of production for all of 
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
He moved to Columbia in 1967 and two years later formed his own production 
company. His films included "The Anderson Tapes" and "Shamus." 
</P>
<P>
Survivors include his wife, Sylvia, two daughters and four grandchildren. 
Services are scheduled today in New York City.

<TEXT>
<P>
Irving (Ash) Resnick, a longtime gaming figure credited with luring high 
rollers to the Las Vegas Strip, died Wednesday. He was 72. 
</P>
<P>
Resnick died of heart failure at Humana Hospital Sunrise after being 
hospitalized after a long bout with cancer. 
</P>
<P>
His forte was bringing gamblers to Las Vegas casinos for high-stakes gambling, 
and he organized the first junkets that later became a fixture of the casinos. 
</P>
<P>
Resnick's Las Vegas career spanned four decades and included stints at Caesars 
Palace, the Aladdin, the Dunes, the Tropicana, the old El Rancho and 
Thunderbird hotels and most recently the Maxim Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
He was credited with starting the first baccarat game at the Dunes. Baccarat is 
now featured at most Strip hotels. 
</P>
<P>
In 1974, Resnick was convicted of income tax evasion while employed at Caesars 
Palace. The government alleged that Resnick skimmed more than $300,000 from 
Caesars and failed to pay taxes on it. The decision was later overturned.

STEVE WAHRER, 47; '60S ROCK DRUMMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Steve Wahrer, who as drummer with the 1960s' rock group The Trashmen snarled 
out the memorable lyric, "The bird is the word," in the hit song "Surfin' 
Bird," died Saturday in St. Paul, Minn. He was 47. 
</P>
<P>
The song, which also featured the immortal line "Pa-pa-ooh-mau-mau, 
Pa-pa-ooh-mau-mau," climbed to No. 4 on the national charts in 1964 before the 
Beatles arrived with their hit "She Loves You" and swept away the surfing 
sound. 
</P>
<P>
The Trashmen were formed by Wahrer and his high school buddy, Dal Winslow, who 
settled into their surfing sound after a 1962 trip to California. They picked 
up the name The Trashmen from a local hit at the time, "Trashmen Blues." 
</P>
<P>
The group broke up in 1967. Wahrer remained in the music business, playing in 
various bands in the Twin Cities area. 
</P>
<P>
The Trashmen regrouped a few years ago with the increased popularity of rock 
'n' roll revivals and Wahrer remained with the group until he fell ill with 
throat cancer about a year ago.

TREY WILSON; ACTOR NOTED FOR ROLES ON STAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trey Wilson, a second lead and character actor familiar to New York 
theatergoers but whose most recent effort was in film in "Great Balls of Fire," 
the Jerry Lee Lewis story, died last Monday of a cerebral hemorrhage. 
</P>
<P>
He was 40 and died in a New York hospital. He made his permanent residence in 
New York City.

GUARD, 4 OTHERS SLAIN IN GANG SHOOTINGS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Five people were killed in gang shootings in Los Angeles County during the 
weekend, including a security guard who was shot several times as he tried to 
stop gang members from crashing a party in Wilmington, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night, gang members, wielding pipes and bats, tried to get into the 
quinceanera at the Veterans of Foreign Wars Hall, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
After security guard David Eugene Ryan, 41, locked them out, the gang members 
fired shots, killing Ryan and injuring a 5-year-old girl and 16-year-old boy. 
</P>
<P>
In South-Central Los Angeles, Robert Hughes, 18, was killed, and a passenger in 
his car was wounded after an argument with suspected gang members who were in 
another car Saturday night, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Hughes was driving near Figueroa and 54th streets when he exchanged 
threats with the occupants of another car and one of them fired shots. 
</P>
<P>
Several bullets hit Hughes, fatally wounding him, and his car crashed into a 
utility pole. Hughes' passenger, Shandell Milligan, 15, was shot in the side as 
he ran from the car, police said. He was hospitalized in serious condition. No 
arrests have been made in either incident. 
</P>
<P>
In other weekend gang violence: 
</P>
<P>
* Miguel Jimenez, 15, a reputed gang member, was shot to death Friday in a 
brawl with a rival gang in Newhall. Alphonso Tapia, 18, was booked on suspicion 
of murder. 
</P>
<P>
* Charles Thomas, 30, was killed Saturday in a gang shooting as he stood on a 
sidewalk in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
* An unidentified man was killed in Pomona on Sunday night when a carload of 
gang members apparently entered another gang's turf and gunfire erupted. Five 
people were wounded, police said.

CHLOROFLUOROCARBON'S DANGER TO THE ATMOSPHERE HAS INDUSTRY SCRAMBLING TO 
REPLACE THE CHEMICALS THAT ARE; 
</P>
<P>
FRIENDS TO MAN, ENEMIES TO EARTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDY BERLFEIN, Berlfein is a free-lance writer in Encinitas. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Drink some cool milk for breakfast, take off for work and blast the air 
conditioner, type away at your computer and then take a quick break for a 
hamburger at the local fast food joint. Come home and take a nap on the soft 
cushioned couch. 
</P>
<P>
Chances are you weren't aware, but each of those actions couldn't have happened 
without one essential class of chemicals. And those chemicals are endangering 
the health of the planet. 
</P>
<P>
Chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs as they are called, have carved an essential niche 
for themselves in modern life. As coolants in refrigerators and air 
conditioning systems, as cleaning fluids for the electronics industry, as 
insulating materials in Styrofoam packaging, as rigid and flexible foam for 
cushions and home insulation, CFCs have become an increasingly large part of 
our everyday lives. 
</P>
<P>
Industry is trying to shift this dependence to other substances, however, 
because CFCs are escaping into the upper atmosphere, known as the stratosphere, 
and eating away at the ozone layer. And the ozone is essential for protecting 
the earth from the damaging ultraviolet rays of the sun. 
</P>
<P>
The shift is bringing with it an unprecedented, wide-ranging search for 
alternatives to CFCs. 
</P>
<P>
CFCs were used as propellants in aerosol cans until 1978, when they were banned 
in the United States. At that time, scientists were just beginning to realize 
that the chemicals were destroying the ozone layer in the stratosphere. 
</P>
<P>
By eliminating propellants alone, it was easy to make a large dent in 
consumption because propellants encompassed 50% of the market. Once aerosols 
went out the door, however, a host of other applications came in. Ten years 
later, CFCs are being produced at levels exceeding the pre-1978 ban. 
</P>
<P>
While CFC production has increased, the evidence incriminating the chemicals 
has also grown. In September, 1987, several nations convened to draw up an 
agreement limiting the use of CFCs. It states that participants must make a 20% 
cut in production by 1993 and a 50% reduction by 1998. To date, 46 countries 
have signed this document, known as the Montreal Protocol. 
</P>
<P>
The Montreal Protocol sparked a flurry of activity in industry. 
</P>
<P>
E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Co., one of the largest CFC producers, announced 
it would begin phasing out CFC production. The food packaging industry said it 
would abandon CFCs, which it uses to insulate Styrofoam containers for fast 
food, eggs, meat and other products. 
</P>
<P>
In order to meet these deadlines, scientists are racing the clock to develop 
alternatives. An international group of 14 manufacturers of CFCs joined to 
carry out toxicity testing on leading candidates. They hope to speed the 
process by working together, aiming to make the new products available by the 
mid 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all optimistic that these products are coming along very quickly," said 
Stephen Andersen of the Environmental Protection Agency. There is consensus 
among industry representatives, however, that no single product will replace 
CFCs. "We feel that it's going to require more than one material to replace all 
of our . . . needs," said John Fisher of AT&amp;T Bell Labs in Princeton, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
Several proposed alternatives are similar to existing CFCs with slight 
modifications to the chemical structure. Adding a hydrogen atom, for example, 
makes the compound less stable, so it breaks down before it reaches the upper 
atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Du Pont has begun marketing one such alternative for the food packaging 
industry. Because of the added hydrogen, Formacel (HCFC 22) has 95% less ozone 
depletion potential than CFC 12, the substance it replaces. The Food Service 
Packaging Institute has just switched over to the substitute. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the horizon is a replacement for refrigeration and cooling systems. The 
most promising substance, HFC 134a, is undergoing toxicity testing, which will 
take about five years to complete. 
</P>
<P>
Since 134a and most of the other alternatives operate at different temperatures 
and pressures than their original counterpart, equipment must be modified to 
accommodate them. As long as the equipment is functioning, coolants are sealed 
within its system. Only when a unit begins to break down do the CFCs leak and 
escape into the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, large commercial units like refrigerators, freezers and office 
air-conditioners can be retrofitted to accommodate alternative compounds, 
according to Kathleen Forte, senior public affairs specialist at Du Pont in 
Wilmington, Del. 
</P>
<P>
It makes economic sense to replace, rather than retrofit, such smaller 
appliances as home refrigerators, Forte said. Prices for new refrigerators 
equipped with non-CFCs should not be much higher than for those using CFC, 
Forte said. An average home-size unit only needs six ounces of refrigerant, 
which today costs less than a dollar. Although Du Pont projects the CFC 
substitute, 134a, will cost two to five times more, it will have little effect 
on the price of the refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
The cost increase will be much more obvious for commercial applications. An 
air-conditioner installed in a 150,000-square-foot office building requires 
1,500 pounds of coolant. A doubling of the cost of the coolant will raise the 
price of the system considerably. 
</P>
<P>
The expense associated with new equipment applies also to the electronics 
industry. The new compounds developed for cleaning electronic parts and circuit 
boards require special machinery for dispensing the cleaning agent. Existing 
machines cannot accommodate the different properties of the new products. 
</P>
<P>
One of those new compounds, which AT&amp;T has been using since 1986, was 
developed by Petroferm, a small company in Fernandina Beach, Fla. BIOACT EC-7 
is based on a completely different approach than other substitutes. The 
chemical, derived from citrus rinds and coniferous trees, bears no resemblance 
in its chemical structure to CFCs. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher from AT&amp;T said the company hopes eventually to use BIOACT EC-7 for 
20% to 30% of its needs. It has limitations, however. The components must be 
rinsed with water, and not all parts can be immersed in water. 
</P>
<P>
IBM is also experimenting with a new method for cleaning small mechanical parts 
for computers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a revolutionary new alternative," said Ray Kerby, director of 
environmental programs at IBM in San Jose. The procedure uses a mixture of 
water and a soapy substance along with ultrasonic vibration. 
</P>
<P>
Kerby said the IBM researchers have spent the last couple of years on technical 
work, "sharpening up its applicability to our particular cleaning." They are 
working with mechanical parts, which must be spotless to function properly. 
"Even a fingerprint can be a mess," Kerby said. "Absolute cleanliness is super 
important." 
</P>
<P>
David Wirth, senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, 
advocates cutting nonessential uses. "The nonessential uses should be the first 
ones to go," Wirth said. "There are still a large number of them out there." 
They include egg cartons and fast-food packaging, which could be made of other 
substances, such as cardboard. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to cutting nonessential uses, other avenues exist for bypassing the 
use of new chemicals. CFCs are extremely volatile. 
</P>
<P>
Containing CFCs in a closed unit or under a hood during cleaning may help. In 
the past CFCs have been routinely vented into the atmosphere when auto 
air-conditioners are recharged. Producers are encouraging users to contain the 
compounds during this process. Also, the chemicals can be recycled rather than 
disposed of after each use. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives from industry, regulatory agencies and public interest groups 
have voiced optimism that the deadlines outlined by the Montreal Protocol can 
be met. But Fisher of AT&amp;T expressed caution about focusing too heavily on 
specific deadlines and guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we should be shooting for a 50% reduction by the year 1998. I 
think we should really be trying to eliminate CFC usage altogether. Anyone 
shooting for just a 50% reduction is missing the boat. I think we ought to be 
trying to eliminate CFCs . . . wherever we can."

Half of sexual abusers of children have damage to the right temporal lobe of 
the brain, and 40% of sadistic rapists have similar damage to their left 
temporal lobe, according to psychiatrist Ron Langevin of the Clarke Institute 
of Psychiatry in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
The temporal lobes are the portion of the brain that mediates actions from 
conception to execution, including the assessment of potential consequences. In 
effect, Langevin said, they control the more primitive instincts of the central 
nervous system. 
</P>
<P>
Langevin performed computed tomography scanning and electroencephalography, as 
well as conventional psychiatric assessment on more than 400 sexual aggressors 
to reach his conclusion. He speculated that the damage was due to trauma before 
or shortly after birth, but cautioned that interpretation of the results is 
difficult because as many as half of the men he studied also abuse alcohol or 
drugs.

The first direct images of the double-helical structure of deoxyribonucleic 
acid (DNA) were released by researchers from Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and 
the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The three-dimensional images, 
magnified 1 million times, support recent evidence that DNA exists in several 
different variations of the helically wound shape. 
</P>
<P>
The images were made with a scanning tunneling microscope, and the researchers 
believe that even higher resolution can be obtained, perhaps high enough to 
reveal the identity of each of the individual chemicals that make up DNA. If 
so, the technique could possibly be used in the human genome initiative, in 
which investigators hope to identify each of the 3 billion individual chemicals 
in human DNA.

'PALESTINE NEEDS A STATE, TOO' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As one who treasures my friendship with Philip M. Klutznick, and enjoys a 
continuous exchange of views and information, I'll observe with great interest 
how the Jewish "establishment" spokespersons will react to his sage advice as 
to negotiations with the PLO in Israel's need for peace ("Palestine Needs a 
State, Too," Op-Ed Page, Jan. 10). Will they distribute Phil's opinion piece to 
their constituency for independent judgment(s), or skewer his remarks? 
</P>
<P>
If the treatment Stanley Sheinbaum and the others in the "Stockholm five" 
received is any example, Klutznick will be the target of abuse and distortion 
of purpose. Few people in the Jewish, as well as general community, know that 
these American Jews who went to Sweden to meet with PLO leader Yasser Arafat 
were representatives of the highly respected International Center for Peace in 
the Middle East. Its current chairperson is Abba Eban whose skills and talents 
have been certified by his work in the United Nations, as Israel's ambassador 
to the United States, and its foreign minister. Nahumm Goldmann and Klutznick 
were among the founders of the Center for Peace as these Jewish statesmen 
realized Israel's future was at stake by continuous warfare, regardless of the 
finger-pointing on who's at fault. 
</P>
<P>
I can only echo what Klutznick writes: "Now is the time to make peace . . . to 
talk." 
</P>
<P>
In a nuclear age, it's either peace under mutually acceptable conditions, and 
enforced agreements, or the continued march to the eventual day of world 
suicide.

The people of Israel were always willing to negotiate and talk with their 
neighbors, but not with a PLO whose sole purpose and aim was to destroy and 
exterminate Israel and its people. 
</P>
<P>
For the past 40 years they have struggled and worked hard, under most difficult 
circumstances and against severe odds (border attacks by their Arab neighbors). 
</P>
<P>
The population of Israel consists mostly of refugees and survivors of the 
Holocaust who were content to work in peace and make a homeland for themselves 
and their families. They were tired of living in fear of Nazi atrocities. But 
they were ready to defend themselves from enemy attacks and aggressors.

Most of the trouble started when their Arab neighbors, by sneak attacks, 
started major wars against the small state of Israel. We all know the results. 
Each time they drove the enemy back to where they thought would be a safe 
distance to discourage and deter their aggressors from further attacks. They 
even gave up valuable territory to make peace with Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
I believe if they were guaranteed that there would be no more attacks they 
would be glad to cooperate. My question to Mr. Klutznick -- who would guarantee 
a lasting peace?

NEW MILLENNIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dan Molitor (letter, Jan. 13) is exactly right in saying that the next 
millennium begins with 2001 not 2000 but common practice is to include the last 
year of the preceding decade, or century or millennium in the nominal '30s, 
'80s, 20th Century, Third Millennium. It's like trying to fight against "the 
reason is because" or split infinitives or ending sentences with a preposition.

Poor George Bush has seen so many banks go belly up in the Reagan years, he 
can't get his hands on an up-to-date calendar. Pearl Harbor, I remember it 
well. It was September. 
</P>

We know Ronald Reagan's political calendar was 19th Century, carry a big stick 
and clobber little Grenada or bomb women and children living in tents.

RAVENS VS. TORTOISES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The desert tortoise faces extinction unless there is a program to kill off at 
least some of the common ravens that are killing an increasing number of the 
reptiles, a detailed government study has concluded. Public responses to a 
proposed program to reduce raven populations are due by Feb. 13. 
</P>
<P>
Experts from the U.S. Department of the Interior and the California Department 
of Fish and Game have collaborated in drawing up a detailed assessment of the 
situation and offering the options. 
</P>
<P>
At the foundation of the problem are the intrusions of people that have so 
changed the environment that ravens, rare in the area only 40 years ago, are 
rapidly increasing. The birds now are a major cause of the dangerous decline in 
the tortoise. Both state and federal officials have proposed the tortoise for 
the endangered-species list. 
</P>
<P>
"Over 80 individual desert tortoise shells have been found under single raven 
nests," the scientists report. 
</P>
<P>
The only way to save the tortoises is to under-take a supervised program of 
poisoning and shooting ravens, with controls to minimize or eliminate the risk 
of affecting other wildlife in the areas of the Mojave Desert that are 
involved, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
Wildlife experts tell us that this is not the first time that a program has 
been proposed to kill one species to save another. Arctic foxes were killed 
with poison and gunfire to protect the Aleutian Canada goose, an Audubon 
Society official recalled. "You need to be darned careful, and it seldom 
works," he said, adding that "killing ravens is like bailing out the ocean." 
</P>
<P>
But it seems to us that this plan is worth trying. The report reflects a 
painstaking effort to assess all the risks and alternatives. It will be 
important to remember, however, that ravens are not the only threat to the 
tortoise. Off-road vehicles used in uncontrolled fashion are another serious 
threat -- a fresh argument to get on with proposals for expanded protection of 
the California desert.

SHADOW OVER ONLY HALF OF GERMANY; 
</P>
<P>
IF WORLD MUST GET IN A FRENZY, EAST MUST BE ACCOUNTABLE TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY W. RYBACK, Timothy W. Ryback, a lecturer in history and literature 
at Harvard University, is the author of the forthcoming Rock Around the Bloc: 
Rock Music in East Europe and the Soviet Union 1954-1988 (Oxford). 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The international media have been mauling West Germany's public image, even 
prompting the German press to set upon its people with cannibalistic ardor. 
German complicity in the construction of a poison-gas plant in Libya has 
implicated German businessmen, embarrassed German political leaders and 
maligned the image of West Germany as a nation. Columnist William Safire, with 
strident eloquence, recently wrote of the "Auschwitz in the desert," dubbing 
the West German people Todeskraemer -- merchants of death. 
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time the Nazi past has raised its lurid head over the 
West Germans. In May, 1985, the laying of wreaths at the Bitburg cemetery 
sparked similar outrage when it was disclosed that the burial ground contained 
the graves of several SS members. Last fall, Bundestag Speaker Philipp 
Jenninger, a Christian Democrat, resigned after he offered some well-intended, 
but poorly received, remarks commemorating Kristallnacht, the Nazis' pogrom of 
November, 1938. 
</P>
<P>
Such events make one thing clear. Forty years after the collapse of the Third 
Reich, the German people, still living under the shadow of the Nazi legacy, 
must be careful with what they say -- and with what they export. The recent 
past has vested West Germans with the moral imperative to carry themselves more 
prudently than other nations. The involvement of Belgians, Danes and Austrians 
in the poison-gas business has not evoked a similar sense of outrage. 
</P>
<P>
But what about the East Germans? From the outset it was known that East Germany 
was also involved in the construction of the poison-gas plant in Libya. Yet 
East Germany has received only passing mention in the world media. Should not 
East Germans bear the same moral burden for German fascism, German racism and 
German crimes against humanity? 
</P>
<P>
The territory occupied by East Germany constituted nearly one-third the 
landmass of Hitler's Grossdeutschland and provided Lebensraum for approximately 
20 million Aryan pure bloods, over 30% of whose electorate cast their votes to 
the Nazis in 1933. 
</P>
<P>
However, the shadow of the Nazi crimes that haunts West Germany rarely troubles 
the Germans to the East. How is it that the East Germans have avoided this 
stigma? In part, the East Germans were generally more assiduous in persecuting 
former Nazis. They also consciously distanced themselves from many aspects of 
the German past, adopting a new national anthem and leaving the people in Bonn 
to toil with the tainted lyrics of "Deutschland uber alles." East Germany also 
promoted the handy Marxist-Leninist syllogism that equates capitalism with 
fascism, explaining that West Germany, as a capitalist state, inherited the 
Nazi legacy. 
</P>
<P>
The inaccessibility of East Germany to the Western media further helped to 
insulate the country from recrimination. While East Germany remains a closed 
society under Soviet domination, West Germany provides a more accessible target 
for the world media. Camera crews can button-hole citizens on the streets of 
obscure towns like Lahr. Reporters can comb West Germany's free press for 
significant disclosures about government complicity in scandalous affairs. 
Public officials can be called to account before the national and international 
media. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the West Germans' attempts to deal with the Nazi legacy in a 
meaningful way have drawn attention to their role in the Holocaust. Films like 
"Heimat," a mini-series that did for German fascism what "Roots" did for 
American racism, pulled the skeletons out of the communal closet and paraded 
them before prime-time television audiences. The highly acclaimed German 
painter Anselm Kiefer, whose work was exhibited in Los Angeles and New York, 
creates vast, painful canvasses that place Semitic and Teutonic imagery in 
ominous constellations. 
</P>
<P>
West Germans neither defend their past, nor deny their complicity in Nazi 
crimes. As Chancellor Helmut Kohl observed during the commemoration service at 
Bergen-Belsen on April 21, 1985, "reconciliation" for Nazi crimes can be 
achieved only "if we Germans acknowledge our shame and our historical 
responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
The world media are justified in finding German interests in Libya's poison-gas 
plant morally reprehensible, just as they found Kohl's initial denial of West 
German involvement politically irresponsible. However, West German involvement 
in Rabta, Libya, is not the same thing as fascist atrocities in Auschwitz, 
Poland. Let's hold the Kohl government accountable for its transgressions, not 
for those of the Nazi regime. Further, if we want to insist that the West 
Germans, because of their past, have a moral obligation to act more responsibly 
than other nations, let's not forget that the East Germans share the same 
historic legacy and the same present complicity.

FOR AMERASIANS, A WELCOME MAT IS NOT ENOUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

clinical psychologists and assistant professors of psychiatry at Dartmouth 
Medical School.

<TEXT>
<P>
With the passage of the Amerasian Homecoming Act a year ago, Rep. Robert J. 
Mrazek (D-N.Y.) and Rep. Tom Ridge (R-Pa.), the bill's co-sponsors, stated that 
these half-American, half-Vietnamese youth "will have the opportunity to become 
(American) citizens and realize the dream that millions of others have pursued 
. . . ." Arrival in America should not be equated with the realization of that 
dream. 
</P>
<P>
Amerasians carry their own "dreams" about life in America. They arrive here 
with already intense emotional ties to this "land of their fathers," carrying 
inner images that are often highly idealized and unrealistic. All too many of 
the Amerasians we are working with are poorly equipped -- socially, 
educationally and psychologically -- to make the kind of adjustment and 
eventual adaptation to life in America that most of us would judge to be 
adequate. Without additional support to help them achieve a reasonable degree 
of economic and emotional self-sufficiency, we fear that many may fall into a 
cycle of poverty, gang membership and welfare dependency. 
</P>
<P>
Is the success of the Amerasian Homecoming Act to be narrowly defined, measured 
only by the "numbers moved" in a particular time frame? The legislation remains 
myopic, being almost exclusively focused on expediting emigration. It contains 
little balance of attention and virtually no fiscal allocation to address the 
hard human issues of actual resettlement. Other criteria of success might 
include measures of adjustment, for instance, the degree of economic 
self-sufficiency. Important indicators would be rates of stable employment, 
amount of time on public assistance and referral rates for medical and 
mental-health services. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last five years our work with Vietnamese Amerasians suggests that 
diversity is what most characterizes this population. The obvious and striking 
differences in terms of height, physique and skin color are matched by the 
variety of personal histories they carry within them. Some have shown real 
strength and resiliency, excelling socially, academically and economically. As 
a whole, however, we have been concerned that on an environmental basis alone 
(e.g., loss of a parent, material poverty, being of mixed race, minimal formal 
education), most are at high risk for serious problems in long-term adaptation. 
The Amerasians who arrived before the passage of the Amerasian Homecoming Act 
have required more intensive special services than any other Southeast Asian 
refugee group, both at the Philippine Refugee Processing Center and during the 
post-arrival period. 
</P>
<P>
Recent research suggests that, in general, this pattern will likely hold. As 
many as 15% of the Amerasians in our sample have had no formal education and up 
to 75% have had less than four years of schooling. The majority are virtually 
illiterate in Vietnamese and arrive with no transferable job skills. The 
implications are clear, including the high dropout rate already noted among the 
teens. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of Vietnamese Amerasians are now over 16 and have spent most of 
their everyday lives outside of school. Given the absence of their fathers, 
which has particular meaning in the patriarchal Vietnamese society, few have 
been raised in strong, traditional families. They have tended to be poor, even 
by Vietnamese standards. Thus, it should be no surprise that few have 
internalized the values of academic achievement, discipline and self-sacrifice 
that may have typified many of the earlier Vietnamese refugees. These 
circumstances, when added to the fact that special support services for all 
Southeast Asian refugee youth are extremely limited, will jeopardize their 
potential for achieving the dream that the congressmen allude to. 
</P>
<P>
Amerasians and their families are being resettled in about 25 "cluster sites" 
across the United States. The ongoing, collaborative efforts of the Office of 
Refugee Resettlement and InterAction (an organization of voluntary agencies 
involved in resettlement) to help prepare for the increased arrival of 
Amerasians and their families must be applauded and further supported. Funding 
to increase professional staff at the local level and the extension of 
educational and vocational training programs is crucial. 
</P>
<P>
We are strong supporters of the underlying intent of the Amerasian Homecoming 
Act. But Amerasians are a high-risk population arriving into a support system 
that is already overtaxed. Defining the legislation's success in the narrow 
terms of "numbers moved" fails to address the tougher and more long-standing 
human problems of actual resettlement. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, fate, circumstance and the arbitrariness of international 
politics have not been kind to Amerasians. Only by seriously attending to the 
course of resettlement can we assure a more genuine opportunity for them to 
"make it" in America. To stop short only further extends the disfranchisement 
of thousands of young people, who, under less politicized circumstances, might 
already be reaping the benefits of American citizenship.

DEFENDING THE ENVIRONMENT MEANS COMBATTING POVERTY IN THE RURAL THIRD WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IDRISS JAZAIRY, Idriss Jazairy is president of the International Fund for 
Agricultural Development in Rome. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In their struggle to survive, the growing number of rural poor may eventually 
destroy their natural environment. They are caught in a self-destructive trap 
where their immediate survival often depends on the over-exploitation of 
fragile lands. As victims of entrenched poverty, the poorest of the rural poor 
are being forced up mountainsides, into jungles or to deserts to eke out their 
existence as best they can. Unaided, the environment will not withstand this 
continual human onslaught. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is seen as a cyclical one in which population growth, past 
development strategies, increasing debt, declining terms of trade and natural 
disasters are leading to the over-use of productive soils, forests and waters. 
The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the World Bank and other 
international and regional bodies are trying to relieve some of the pressure 
through a more balanced trading system and debt reduction. 
</P>
<P>
Other organizations like the International Fund for Agricultural Development 
(IFAD) are meeting the challenge in the field by getting the rural poor 
involved and committed to their own development, which ultimately is linked to 
the preservation of their environment. This grass-roots approach is based on 
field evidence that the rural poor prefer to participate in their own sustained 
economic growth rather than receive short-term handouts. This same evidence has 
shown that success in breaking the link between poverty and environmental 
degradation depends on the level of local participation in development 
projects. Unless the rural poor are involved in project design and 
implementation, and unless they are assured of some immediate benefit from the 
environmental components, they will have little interest in its maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
The greatest challenge in following this approach is to convince the local 
people that environmentally sound practices such as crop rotation, 
afforestation and other soil conservation measures are not only in their 
long-term interest but are also instrumental in meeting their immediate 
nutritional needs. One of the best ways to achieve these objectives is to work 
through the traditional tribal groups. These groups often have their own 
conservation methods that may have gone into disuse because of demographic 
pressures and government land-use policies. 
</P>
<P>
For example, in Yemen, as in the entire Arab peninsula, a traditional system 
for the control of common lands (heman) evolved under tribal authority. There 
were rules affecting grazing and free harvesting, livestock sizes, and areas 
set aside for beekeeping. As government authority gradually expanded, tribal 
authority and the heman system declined. The result has been overstocking, 
overgrazing, soil erosion and overall environmental degradation. The Fund has 
proposed that the former heman-governed lands be controlled by tribal 
communities with exclusive contingency planning rights. 
</P>
<P>
Another way to ease the pressure on agricultural lands is to encourage off-farm 
employment in rural communities. Some progress has already been seen in this 
area but increased efforts should be made to encourage entrepreneurship -- 
especially among rural youth and women. By providing employment for laborers, 
women and young people who cannot be absorbed in the agricultural sector, the 
rural economies will become more diversified and stable. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, traditional conservation techniques stand a better chance of being 
maintained and the quality of life can be improved for those who would 
otherwise be forced to migrate to the already overcrowded cities. In Nepal, 
Bangladesh and other countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America, 
IFAD-sponsored credit proposals have helped women start small weaving 
businesses that allow them to practice a traditional skill and earn money, 
without having to leave their homes and children. 
</P>
<P>
IFAD is including many such components in its development projects in an 
attempt to break the link between poverty and environmental degradation. 
Support, however, is needed on the national, regional and international levels 
to direct more resources to applied research and to adapt existing technologies 
to the needs of the poor. 
</P>
<P>
Poverty is both a cause and an effect of environmental destruction. By starting 
with the principle of self-reliance and by drawing on existing local resources 
and capacities, external assistance can stimulate the creativity of the poor 
and thus serve as a catalyst for self-supporting and sustained development. 
</P>
<P>
Eradicating rural poverty, which affects more than 1 billion of the world's 
population, is the most direct way to ensure environmentally sound development 
in the Third World. When the prognosis is that the global land-production 
system faces possible long-term climatic changes that, compounded by the 
greenhouse effect, may accelerate further the process of resource degradation, 
do we really have any other choice?

A THAW BUILT ON SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT E. HUNTER, Robert E. Hunter is the director of European studies at 
the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
George Bush has become President of the United States and leader of the Western 
world at a time of peace and promise unprecedented in the postwar era. Ronald 
Reagan's presidency provided a solid basis on which to build in key areas of 
national security. But the choices that Bush makes must be grounded in part on 
an accurate understanding of what Reagan did and did not do. 
</P>
<P>
There can be no doubt that his optimism was far more consistent with the 
American national character than was Jimmy Carter's "malaise," and national 
self-assurance is a valuable asset in diplomacy. Through the occasional 
exercise of military power -- with Libya's Col. Moammar Kadafi as his favorite 
villain -- Reagan provided catharsis for collective anger over assaults on 
American dignity, even if he rarely produced concrete results. And in his 
support -- even if with words more than deeds -- of democracy elsewhere on the 
globe, Reagan gave a sense of purpose to U.S. policy that was rooted in 
American values. It was only in piling up mammoth budget and trade deficits 
while neglecting a wide range of global economic and environmental concerns 
that Reagan passed to his successor a set of challenges worse than what he 
inherited eight years ago, along with a weaker hand to play. 
</P>
<P>
Overshadowing all else during the Reagan years was the passing of the Cold War. 
U.S.-Soviet competition continues, even the risk of war, but rigidities have 
softened and East-West tensions have been reduced almost everywhere. Equally 
important, Reagan acknowledged that U.S.-Soviet relations have changed 
significantly, thereby disarming the right wing and giving the new era a 
political legitimacy that perhaps no other President could have conferred. Bush 
can now proceed in dealing with the Soviet Union by wrapping himself in the 
flag woven by Reagan. It is thus possible that wild swings in U.S. attitudes 
toward Moscow will be damped down, leading to more sustainable and productive 
policies toward the Soviet Union than proved possible during detente's false 
dawn in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
But, beyond the politics, it is important to analyze how the thaw occurred in 
superpower relations. Obviously, the Soviet Union has done most of the 
compromising. It is removing its troops from Afghanistan, reducing its military 
forces by about 10%, smiling warmly on a host of its neighbors, helping to 
broker reduced tensions and even settlements in places like Cambodia, Korea and 
Angola, supporting the United Nations, and accepting on-site inspection as a 
condition of arms-control agreements. 
</P>
<P>
Some observers, including Reagan himself, attribute these shifts in Soviet 
behavior largely to the U.S. defense buildup and years of firmness in resisting 
Soviet military encroachment (Afghanistan) or divisive diplomacy (medium-range 
missiles in Europe). Only in places where the President has not had his way -- 
notably Nicaragua -- has Soviet power resisted retreat. 
</P>
<P>
According to this view, the Soviets could not compete, and they are wisely 
drawing in their horns. The lesson for George Bush is clear: Be resolute and 
militarily powerful, and bargain only from strength. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, many critics of the Reagan hard line regard as self-deluding the 
vision that effects must necessarily have causes that are Made in America. By 
this account, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has changed his tune and 
his tactics in order to gain a breathing space in which to restructure the 
Soviet economy, supported by Western credits and technology. He has played 
relatively poor cards with consummate skill, thereby gaining relative 
advantages in many parts of the world. Unable to provide his people with bread, 
he has given them circuses, while the U.S. government has lacked the 
imagination to match his diplomacy. The lesson for the next President: Be wary 
of Gorbachev and learn to compete with him, but also do not undermine the best 
Soviet leader that the West can hope for. 
</P>
<P>
Yet another view gives President Reagan significant credit for helping to 
produce changes in Kremlin policy, but holds that he began to succeed only when 
he radically altered his own approach. That change can be dated from early 
1984, when he began embracing the goals and rhetoric of arms control in order 
to counter the nuclear freeze movement and to co-opt the Democrats' one 
selling-point in the presidential election. Reagan continued by making major -- 
indeed, bizarre -- concessions at the 1986 Reykjavik superpower summit, by 
concluding a Euromissile agreement that provided relative advantages to the 
Soviet Union, by inviting it to join Arab-Israeli peacemaking, and finally by 
supporting a human-rights conference in Moscow in 1991. Thus only by becoming 
more accommodating himself did Reagan evoke a similar response from Gorbachev's 
Soviet Union. The lesson: Resist a return to the confrontation policies of the 
early 1980s, pursue arms control and work to reduce regional tensions. 
</P>
<P>
Each of these visions has its strengths and weaknesses. But most remarkable, 
both for assessing the record of the Reagan years and for guiding the policy of 
the Bush Administration -- the lessons that they embody are all essentially 
correct. Taken together, they provide a reasonable basis for U.S. policy toward 
the Soviet Union for the foreseeable future. Indeed, by acting in ways that 
provided arguments for almost everybody, Reagan permitted a bipartisanship that 
Bush would be wise to emulate.

TARZANA MINI-MALL FIRE BURNS COSMETICS STORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fire erupted at a cosmetics store inside a Tarzana mini-mall Sunday, causing 
$45,000 in damage, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
There were no injuries reported in the 5:30 p.m. blaze at Gloria's Skin &amp; 
Body Care in the 19400 block of Ventura Boulevard, said Jim Wells, a spokesman 
for the Los Angeles Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
It took 35 firefighters about 25 minutes to extinguish the fire, Wells said. 
Fire-resistant walls prevented the blaze from spreading to neighboring 
businesses in the one-story complex, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Damage was estimated at $35,000 to property and $10,000 to the contents, Wells 
said. The fire is believed to have been started by an electrical short, he 
said.

MOTORCYCLIST RUN OVER AFTER HITTING PICKUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A motorcyclist died Sunday after he rear-ended a pickup truck on the Golden 
State Freeway in Arleta, was thrown onto the freeway and run over by two autos, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The motorcyclist, whose identity was withheld pending notification of 
relatives, was traveling north on the Golden State Freeway near the Hollywood 
Freeway early Sunday morning at speeds of up to 90 m.p.h., said Officer Monty 
Keifer of the California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
The motorcyclist hit a pickup truck and was catapulted onto the highway, Keifer 
said. Two autos ran over the man and did not stop, he said. The man was 
pronounced dead at the scene, Keifer said. 
</P>
<P>
The pickup truck driver, a 26-year-old Canyon Country man who authorities 
declined to identify, was not injured and will not be charged, Keifer said.

1 MAN DIES, 1 INJURED IN 2 APARTMENT FIRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One man died and a second was injured in two separate apartment fires Sunday 
afternoon in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
A body of a man about 30 years old was found after 20 firefighters doused a 
blaze in a Woodland Hills apartment about 1 p.m., Los Angeles city Fire 
Department spokesman Jim Wells said. The victim's identity was not available, 
and the cause of the fire was under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The fire, in a top-floor unit of a three-story building in the 22100 block of 
Victory Boulevard, took 12 minutes to extinguish, Wells said. The apartment was 
heavily damaged and the hallway had smoke damage, but damage estimates were not 
available. 
</P>
<P>
Less than an hour earlier, a Van Nuys man was injured in an apartment fire in 
the 6600 block of Woodley Avenue, Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
The man, also about 30, suffered first- and second-degree burns on his face and 
hands and was taken to Panorama Community Hospital in Panorama City, where he 
was in stable condition Sunday afternoon, officials said. His name also was 
withheld by authorities. 
</P>
<P>
The electrical fire was put out in less than 15 minutes, Wells said. Damage to 
the apartment, on the second floor of a two-story building, and its contents 
was estimated at $30,000. No further details about the cause of the fire were 
available, Wells said.

THE NEW FIRST STYLE DRAWS THE AYES OF TEXAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For George and Barbara Bush, the honeymoon is definitely on. At inaugural 
festivities that continued into the early hours of Sunday morning, the First 
Couple's down-to-earth warmth and spontaneity continued to be the hot topic. 
</P>
<P>
In one of the social highlights of the inaugural weekend, more than 5,500 
people packed the Washington Hilton Crystal Ballroom on Saturday night for the 
Texas State Society's "Black Tie and Boots" ball, an event where the men also 
wore furs, the women also wore hats and boots, and they danced like they really 
meant it. 
</P>
<P>
What continued to be noticeably different from the Reagan inaugural parties was 
the lowered-profile of the Hollywood crowd. That large contingency that swept 
through town back then received the royal treatment. This time, they were 
there, but in smaller numbers and less-starring roles. But the place went wild 
when the new President and First Lady and their oldest son, George, arrived. 
</P>
<P>
To a chorus of wolf whistles, Bush showed the crowd his cowboy boots, which 
each had a map of Texas on it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll show you my boots. I don't want Ann Richards to think I'm not a Texan," 
said Bush, referring to the Democratic convention's keynote speaker, Texas 
State Treasurer Richards, and the general campaign rhetoric that frequently 
painted the then-vice president as a "tourist from Kennebunkport." The Texas 
party crowd howled its delight. 
</P>
<P>
He then spotted someone he knew in the enormous crowd and pointed at him, 
barking: "There's Rocky Carroll from Houston, the man who made these boots!" 
</P>
<P>
It was more of the same from a man who began his historical inaugural address 
with, among his first words, "Hey, Danny!" -- an ad-lib salute to the Ways and 
Means Committee chairman, Illinois Democrat Dan Rostenkowski, whom he spotted 
in the crowd. And a man who bounced out of his limousine during the inaugural 
parade to walk and to wave at the crowd -- and then invite some of those 
tourists in to tour the White House the next day. Throughout the long weekend, 
Barbara Bush made just as big an impression as her husband, making fun of her 
unglamorous, size-14 self in speeches and patting White House visitors on the 
arm. 
</P>
<P>
At the Texas ball, where yellow roses, Mexican food and Lone Star beer (drunk 
straight from the bottle) were everywhere, Mrs. Bush scored another big hit. As 
she was introduced, she drew cheers just as loud as her husband, as the men 
waved their cowboy hats in the air. 
</P>
<P>
"All day long at our house," she said, "people have been coming up and asking, 
'How does the President like this? How does the President like that?' I said, 
'I don't know!' Then I remembered, 'My gosh! It's George!' " 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Bush went on to tell the party crowd that she "worked awfully hard this 
week to make you very, very proud of me. Next week I'm going back to being 
Barbara Bush again." The statement brought clapping, cheering and several 
shouts of "We love you, Barbara!" 
</P>
<P>
For some people in the crowd, the unpretentious nature of the new First Lady 
was nothing new. 
</P>
<P>
"I've known Barbara Bush for many years, and I've always loved her," said Texas 
Sen. Phil Gramm, who was a Democrat in some of those many years before he 
switched to Republican in 1983. "As Americans get to know her, they'll feel the 
same way I do." 
</P>
<P>
Another prominent Texan in the crowd agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"She's fantastic," said Roger Staubach, the former Dallas Cowboys quarterback. 
"You're seeing the substance and depth of a great mother and a great wife. 
She's been successful at what she's done, and it's not been easy." 
</P>
<P>
Staubach's wife, Marianne, who had boots on her feet and little silver boots 
dangling from her ears, chimed in: "She's fabulous. She's really showing that 
down-home, good American values like caring for your family come through and 
pay off." 
</P>
<P>
Gregg Petersmeyer, who will be George Bush's "thousand points of light man" in 
the Administration, overseeing the volunteer effort, said he has liked Barbara 
Bush since he met her 20 years ago, when he was a 19-year-old summer intern in 
the Nixon White House. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Qualities Much Admired' 
</P>
<P>
"I think she's going to be one of the most popular First Ladies in memory," 
said Petersmeyer, who was Bush's Colorado state chairman. "Her qualities are 
much admired. She's direct, humorous, unassuming, unpretentious, but classy." 
</P>
<P>
The praise for Mrs. Bush was just as thick at a party that preceded the Texas 
ball, a reception at the Four Seasons Hotel given by a group of Houston 
business executives in honor of incoming Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher 
and his wife, Georgette. 
</P>
<P>
"She has such a strong sense of self. And she's such a warm person that she 
brings that out in everyone she meets," said Georgette Mosbacher, who garnered 
quite a bit of attention over the weekend herself as Washington's great hope 
for a new social star. "She has no pretentions about her -- she's a great role 
model." 
</P>
<P>
Added Secretary of State James Baker: "As she says, what you see is what you 
get. I think that's what the public likes." 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Bush has gotten off to a much better start as First Lady than Nancy 
Reagan, who was new to Washington and not well prepared for it. Whereas the 
Reagans cruised into Washington crusading against government, the Bushes are 
the ultimate Washington insiders who have lived here and worked in government 
for many years. They know and love Washington, and Washington knows and loves 
them -- an important first step in making a good impression. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Transfer of Warmth' 
</P>
<P>
"Barbara has done a lot for George Bush," said John Vogt, a Washington lobbyist 
attending the Four Seasons cocktail party with fiancee, Lisa Richards, an 
Atlanta flight attendant. "In the last couple of weeks I've sensed this 
transfer of warmth; people feel more warmly about George Bush, and I believe 
Barbara has made a significant contribution to that transformation. People feel 
warm about him because they feel warm about her." 
</P>
<P>
Richards observed, "She likes her grandchildren more than fashion. Nancy Reagan 
was like an ideal person." 
</P>
<P>
Vogt agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"So many people in American can identify with Barbara Bush -- she's a very real 
person," Vogt said. "I think it's neat that a lot of people out there can see 
something of themselves in her."

FANE ON FEMALES: MAY HIS FAME, IF ANY, BE FLEETING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Cautionary Tales for Women by Julian Fane (Hamish Hamilton and St. George's 
Press/David &amp; Charles Inc.: $19.95; 307 pages) 
</P>
<P>
Speaking as a female, I can say unequivocally that reading "Cautionary Tales 
for Women" in one sitting is a little like slugging down a tea cup full of warm 
cod-liver oil in one gulp. The book is at once sickening in its own right in 
this present time, and nauseatingly familiar -- a nightmare from childhood, 
when, at the mercy of your well-meaning parents, you were stuffed with a 
ghastly diet of old wives' tales, half-truths and downright lies about womens' 
roles in the relationships of the sexes. 
</P>
<P>
The tone here is uniquely revolting. Julian Fane adopts that all-too-familiar 
voice of false cleverness, the form of the epigram. He is a professionally 
clever man, the kind you avoid at parties as if he had the plague. Here Fane 
is, addressing women, being clever: "Men are said to rule the world: Which is 
less than perfect in the eyes of feminists in consequence. But you women were 
closest to, and had the best chance to influence, us men in our formative 
years. Blame for our private and public misbehavior is attributable in large 
part to what you have done or omitted to do in our nurseries. And if we take 
after our brutish fathers, whose fault is it that our fathers were brutes? 
</P>
<P>
"Your disillusionment with the love that produced us, and your discontent that 
turned you into a hateful mother and twisted the characters of your children, 
are not extenuating factors: You chose or permitted yourself to be chosen by a 
mate who disillusioned you, and disturbed the peace of any number of minds." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An Old Message 
</P>
<P>
In other words, if you're raped, or marry a wife-beater, or a homosexual who 
hates women, it's your fault. There's nothing new in this message. I learned it 
at my own mother's knee, and Sister Dominic (who I sincerely hope has gone on 
to a just reward in the after-life), teaching at an elementary school in Eagle 
Rock, had the same message for all her third-grade female students. Your 
misfortunes will be your own fault. So, shut up. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, you can't argue with Fane when he mentions all this: He's 
not being serious, he would tell you. He's being clever; to argue would simply 
mark the female reviewer/reader as a humorless clod, which has been his point 
all along. When Fane writes: "Not love of money but love of another is the root 
of all evil, being the father and mother of evil people," he -- if I read 
correctly -- is not looking for the response, "Julian, you're as wrong as a 
three dollar bill." He does not want us to edge away, muttering, "Julian, I 
can't discuss this anymore, I think I hear my mother calling." On the contrary, 
he wants the reader to giggle and twitter and rap his knuckles with a 
metaphorical fan: "Julian, you're so clever! However do you think of such 
amazing tidbits?" 
</P>
<P>
Those of us who remember J. .M. Barrie's 1918 play, "The Admirable Chrichton" 
(in which a morally irreproachable butler in an English family of morally lax 
noblemen becomes their natural leader on a desert island once they're 
shipwrecked), will recall from that work a harmless, frivolous nitwit named 
Ernest, who, in England, torments his companions with such remarks as: "Life, 
Chrichton, is like a cup of tea. The more heartily we drink, the sooner we 
reach the dregs." Within the hateful bonds of civilization, Chrichton must put 
up with this cleverness, but once on the island, Chrichton opines: ". . . 
Sayings which would be justly admired in England are not much use on an island. 
I would therefore most respectfully propose that henceforth every time Mr. 
Ernest favours us with an epigram his head should be immersed in a bucket of 
cold spring water." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Product of Modern Times 
</P>
<P>
Now, such treatment might be just a little harsh on Fane; and, after all, we 
still live in civilization and probably have to put up with such stuff: It is 
the by-product of how we live, like discarded rubber tires or used plastic 
cups. 
</P>
<P>
Still, we certainly must be entitled, at some point, as Fane drones on ("The 
wounds of love she thinks she has received justify her instant remedies that 
wound. You could say she is retarded: It is her perennial innocence which is 
injured and injurious. She remains impressionable and malleable, or appears to, 
although the men who have loved her would argue in their turn that she never 
met them halfway. . . ."), I think the reader is justified in letting her own 
mind slip a few gears to tote up her grocery list or plan her upcoming schedule 
of good deeds. 
</P>
<P>
And when Fane finishes his cautionary tales with this stern admonishment to 
women: ". . . endure your despair " I think it's correct to ease away from the 
writer with a civil nod, a neutral monosyllable or two, and only in the company 
of sensible men and women, allow yourself a rude laugh or two at this silly 
person's expense. Let him endure his own despair, for heaven's sake, and let 
the rest of us enjoy life together and see if we can make it fair and fun for 
everybody all around.

POWER AND SUBTERFUGE IN THE TIME OF THE BOMB;

'WAR AND PEACE,' 'INTELLIGENCE': MIXED SIGNALS OF THE COLD WAR

</HEADLINE>

<P>
We live in an age of video paradox. 
</P>
<P>
How can something as exquisitely beautiful and majestic as a nuclear explosion 
be so unthinkably catastrophic? 
</P>
<P>
The familiar flash of warming white light precedes a disturbingly seductive, 
fiery, violent eruption in a fine new documentary series starting tonight on 
PBS. As we watch -- at once awed, enthralled and horrified by the orange shade 
of holocaust being drawn across the screen in "War and Peace in the Nuclear 
Age" -- we hear Robert Oppenheimer, father of the Bomb, recalling the first 
atomic blast in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
"A few people laughed. A few people cried. Most people were silent. I 
remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad-Gita: 'Now I am 
become Death, destroyer of worlds.' " 
</P>
<P>
How, also, can the romantic, glamorous and thrilling espionage epitomized by 
mythical idealistic heroes in spy stories be squared with the shadowy realities 
of the FBI and CIA pictured in another fascinating but upsetting documentary 
series titled "Secret Intelligence"? 
</P>
<P>
Domestic spying? Secret components of open government working covertly and 
sometimes illegally? Vendettas as a substitute for foreign policy? Often 
questionable ventures in Iran, Guatemala, Cuba, Vietnam and Central America? 
Even now, the negative residue remains. 
</P>
<P>
This pair of series -- the 13-part "War and Peace in the Nuclear Age" opening 
at 8 p.m. on Channels 28 and 15 and 9 p.m. on Channel 50, followed by the 
premiere of KCET's own four-part "Secret Intelligence" at 9 p.m. on Channels 
28, 15 and 24 -- is a powerful double whopper. Both series assume added 
relevance given the holdover perils facing the new Administration in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Add to them Tuesday's worthy but arid "Frontline" documentary on the John A. 
Walker Jr. spy ring ("The Spy Who Broke the Code" at 9 p.m. on Channels 28 and 
15 and 10 p.m. on Channel 50) and tonight's slimmed-down rerun of ABC's 
infamous nuclear holocaust drama "The Day After" (at 9 on Channels 3, 7 and 10) 
and you get a different and infinitely more depressing version of a thousand 
points of light. 
</P>
<P>
A production of Boston's WGBH-TV and England's Central Independent Television 
in association with NHK of Japan, "War and Peace in the Nuclear Age" not only 
documents the fusion of science and politics, but does so from the dual 
perspectives of the West and the Soviet Union. That may be the finest virtue of 
this impressive series. 
</P>
<P>
Appropriately titled "Dawn," tonight's opener traces the frantic race to create 
the atom bomb, a race culminating in that extraordinary first explosion in the 
New Mexico desert recalled by Oppenheimer, and also physicist Philip Morrison 
from his vantage point of 10 miles away: 
</P>
<P>
"I'll never forget the sense of heat on my face, as though the noonday sun had 
appeared across the cold desert morning. To me that was much more important 
than the flash or even the rumbling, thunderous sound that came and echoed 
among the mountains a minute later." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't long before the United States had dropped the two atomic bombs on 
Japan that ended World War II and altered the course of global relations for 
the foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
Already the Cold War was surfacing, for the Kremlin, we're told tonight, 
perceived the dropping of the bombs as less a blow to Japan than a U.S. threat 
to the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"War and Peace in the Nuclear Age" sort of meets "Secret Intelligence" at the 
pass in next week's second episode, in which a combustible mix of Cold War 
passions is seen shaping early nuclear politics. These intense feelings were 
fueled by such demagogues as Red-hunting Sen. Joseph McCarthy (R-Wis.), who is 
seen exploiting the Julius and Ethel Rosenberg spy case, and FBI chief J. Edgar 
Hoover, who accuses the controversial Oppenheimer of being a communist agent. 
</P>
<P>
Hoover also surfaces as a central character in "Secret Intelligence," the 
thoughtful, bold and provocative KCET series that explores still another 
paradox, the need for secrecy in democracy. The executive producer is Blaine 
Baggett, whose credits include last season's award-winning "Spy Machines" 
documentary for the PBS "Nova" series. And the correspondent -- who does a 
splendid job of setting the tone -- is Bill Kurtis. 
</P>
<P>
"Secret Intelligence" may offer nothing new for specialists, but undoubtedly 
will shock and perhaps anger lay viewers unaccustomed to encountering such a 
broad, blunt and expertly presented survey on the uneasy coexistance of secrecy 
and openness in America. It covers some of the same turf, but surpasses in 
scope Bill Moyers' 1987 program, "The Secret Government." 
</P>
<P>
"The Only Rule Is Win" is the title of tonight's premiere of "Secret 
Intelligence" that examines the evolution of Hoover and the FBI, the 
intelligence blunders that contributed to the disaster at Pearl Harbor and the 
legacy of the OSS, Bill Donovan's fabled wartime organization that sired the 
CIA. 
</P>
<P>
Subsequent episodes will clarify, among other things, the CIA's controversial 
role as America's "secret army of intervention" (spelled out even more 
definitively in William Blum's book "The CIA") and the zigzagging lines leading 
to the Iran-Contra affair. 
</P>
<P>
If there is one segment of recent U.S. history that more than any other 
dramatized limits of secrecy in democracy, however, it was John F. Kennedy's 
Bay of Pigs invasion, in which a CIA-trained brigade of Cuban exiles made a 
doomed attempt to overthrow Fidel Castro. 
</P>
<P>
For a myriad of reasons, CIA operatives who had succeeded in drastically 
shifting the courses of governments in Italy, Iran and Guatemala, failed in 
Cuba. Shrouded in subterfuge and disinformation, the Bay of Pigs debacle was 
more than merely an act of espionage against a communist regime whose existence 
had become a U.S. obsession, Kurtis notes in next Monday's episode. It was an 
act of war. 
</P>
<P>
After it was over, one former CIA official recalls, "I got drunk, drunk with 
fatigue and drunk with remorse." That is exactly the feeling pervading much of 
"Secret Intelligence."

TWO CASTS IN NYCO 'WIDOW'

<P>
New York City Opera shucked the serious stuff and turned to Franz Lehar's "The 
Merry Widow" over the weekend to close a six-day run at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
The production, new in 1982, was revived last year, and offers much that is 
attractive to look at. Helen Pond and Herbert Senn's Nouveau sets -- dominated 
by turquoise, purple and rose -- are handsome. Suzanne Mess' 
turn-of-the-century costumes are bright and stylish. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Bentley's staging, initially criticized for overly busy high jinks, was 
later toned down into relatively straightforward action; it was this version 
that was recreated in Orange County by Cynthia Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
The company offered two casts in a number of key roles. 
</P>
<P>
Leigh Munro was a warm, appealing, vulnerable, melting and yielding Sonia 
(a.k.a. Hanna Glawari, the Widow) Saturday afternoon. She sang with an 
aristocratic, dark-toned, weighty soprano, but inclined more toward beauty of 
vowels than clarity of enunciation. Thus she sang "Vilia" with gentleness and 
refined pianissimo, but the words were virtually indistinct. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday evening, Michele McBride proved an intelligent, sophisticated, sly, 
sensual and clever Sonia. She offered fine-edged vocalism though with some 
wobbliness under pressure. But she sang "Vilia" with clear diction, seamless 
line and magical tenderness. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, opposite each of them as Danilo was baritone Louis Otey -- tall, 
broad-shouldered, handsome in a Clark Gable look-alike way, but stiff and 
wooden in acting. There was virtually no chemistry between him and Munro in the 
afternoon, but he reacted more credibly to McBride in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
In both cases, he sang with coarse, forced vocalism, and had problems, 
particularly in the afternoon -- losing focus, tone and even at times, control. 
Oddly, he, rather than the Widows, got to interpolate a song in Act III, "Girls 
Were Made to Love and Kiss" (from Lehar's "Paganini"). But the effort drew no 
applause whatsoever from the Saturday evening audience. 
</P>
<P>
(Nor did the song fit well stylistically or in terms of its orchestration. 
"Paganini" was written 20 years after "Merry Widow," and in the meantime Lehar 
had worked hard to develop his style.) 
</P>
<P>
The secondary pair of lovers proved quite different. Gran Wilson brought 
matinee-idol looks to Camille in the afternoon, but sang with a light tenor 
more suitable for musical theater than opera, although it could blossom on top. 
He offered generalized acting. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Golden was his Natalie, singing with lyricism and clarity, and strongly 
exploiting her concern over their parting. 
</P>
<P>
As the evening Camille, Mark Thomsen proved boyish but ardent, attentive and 
serious. Despite a somewhat metallic and constricted tenor, he could portray 
pertinent, genuine distress. 
</P>
<P>
Opposite him, Susanne Marsee, who on Tuesday had portrayed a sensuous Maddalena 
in Verdi's "Rigoletto," offered a rather prim, up-tight Natalie, and seemed 
more involved in a kind of cat-and-mouse game with him than conscious of 
painful loss. But she sang with fine focus. 
</P>
<P>
Appearing in both casts, James Billings divested himself of the TV sitcom 
cutesiness he had occasionally indulged in as the Second Priest in 
"Zauberflote" earlier in the week and offered a dry, clever Nisch. 
</P>
<P>
On both occasions, Imre Pallo conducted with style and dash, with lingering 
affection and expansiveness, despite a penchant for slow tempos. However, he 
also rather often allowed the instrumentalists to overwhelm the singers, 
particularly at the matinee. 
</P>
<P>
The company orchestra, which all week had repeated the dreary cycle of starting 
imprecisely and gaining confidence only as the evening progressed, introduced 
new levels of slovenliness at these performances. The strings, already 
thin-sounding, were sour and squeally in the heights, occuring invariably at 
the most exposed moments. 
</P>
<P>
Choreographer Sharon Halley provided stilted waltzes, pseudo-folk character 
dances and a surpassingly vulgar cancan. The dancers coped gamely, if not with 
much finesse. 
</P>
<P>
Adrian Ross provided the bright, clever translation.

A federal appeals panel has cleared the way for hotel managers to rent movies 
to guests to watch in their rooms, without having to worry about legal action. 
The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a lower court decision in a 
copyright infringement case filed by Columbia Pictures Industries, Paramount 
Pictures, Walt Disney Productions and four other studios. The movie makers 
filed suit against La Mancha Private Club and Villas in Palm Springs, claiming 
it was staging public performances of copyrighted material by allowing guests 
to rent movies in a hotel gift shop to show in their rooms. Public showings of 
films without licensing agreements violate federal copyright laws. The appeals 
court affirmed an earlier ruling, saying that "while the hotel may be 'open to 
the public,' a guest's hotel room, once rented, is not." ALEENE MacMINN and

Tonight's airing by ABC of a truncated version of "The Day After" is spurring 
the Directors Guild of America to continue to pursue legislation on Capitol 
Hill that would "protect the reputation of the artist from any mutilation of 
his work," says a DGA spokesman. About 23 1/2 minutes have been cut from the 
1983 landmark TV film that graphically dramatizes the aftermath of nuclear war. 
In a letter to ABC Entertainment President Brandon Stoddard, DGA executive 
director Glenn J. Gumpel said airing the cut and compressed film "is 
potentially damaging" to the reputation of its director, Nicholas Meyer. Meyer 
has vigorously protested the trimming, calling it "censorship" and wanting his 
name removed from the credits. ALEENE MacMINN and VICTOR VALLE

'PINOCCHIO' STRAPS ON SKATES FOR 6-DAY STINT IN SAN DIEGO

After the Italian fairy tale "Pinocchio" was transferred to film, there didn't 
seem to be any other ways of telling the same story. But Walt Disney 
Productions didn't get its name from a guy who was short on imagination, and 
the folks now running the studio came up with another idea. 
</P>
<P>
Ice theater. 
</P>
<P>
"Walt Disney's Magic Kingdom on Ice" will present its skating version of 
"Pinocchio" during a 10-show, six-day run, Tuesday through Sunday, at the San 
Diego Sports Arena. The ice show arrives nearly 50 years after Disney produced 
the animated version of "Pinocchio" in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
"Pinocchio" is a departure from traditional vaudevillian ice shows, with their 
musical spectacles and costumed cartoon skits. Disney, which produced "Snow 
White" as a full-length ice play two years ago, employs the same splashy 
production techniques as a Broadway show to play up the theatrical aspects of 
ice skating. 
</P>
<P>
"Nowadays, people are looking for more continuity in a show," "Pinocchio" 
executive producer Kenneth Feld said. "So we've come up with a totally new kind 
of arena attraction." 
</P>
<P>
In a little more than two hours, skaters tell the story of the woodcarver, 
Geppetto, who crafts a boy from wood to keep him company. When Geppetto wishes 
the boy would come to life, his request is answered by the Blue Fairy. She 
tells Pinocchio he can become a real boy only if he proves himself worthy. With 
the help of his conscience, Jiminy Cricket, Pinocchio makes his way through 
adventures designed to test his courage, honesty and altruism. 
</P>
<P>
Disney's ice version of "Pinocchio" blends such familiar "Pinocchio" movie 
tunes as "When You Wish Upon a Star" and "Give a Little Whistle," with themes 
from other movies and other Broadway shows. 
</P>
<P>
San Diegan Shannon Sowers, 20, skates the role of the Blue Fairy. She began 
appearing with Magic Kingdom on Ice last year. Another local, Eric Kerr, 25, 
will perform with partner Toyka Raol of Spokane, Wash., to music from the 
"Nutcracker" and "Summer of '42." 
</P>
<P>
"Pinocchio" boasts 51 skaters, 147 costumes and 150 props and sets. Skaters in 
the chorus wear outfits decorated with at least 1,500 sequins, and 2,500 lights 
illuminate the glittery costumes, which are worn in 462 performances each year 
during the cast's 43-week tour. 
</P>
<P>
Disney plans to continue producing ice theater, with "Peter Pan," "Cinderella" 
and "Alice in Wonderland" under consideration as possibilities.

PITTER-PATTER OF 'LITTLE FOOTSTEPS' SOUNDS MORE LIKE A WHINE

Meet Mr. and Mrs. Whiner, stars of "thirty nothing." 
</P>
<P>
He's in advertising -- writing sports promos for a television network. She 
stays home -- when she isn't doing assistant volunteer service at the 
Metropolitan Museum of Art (while hoping to move up to full volunteer status). 
</P>
<P>
They're going to have a baby, and are they bummed out about it. 
</P>
<P>
Why? 
</P>
<P>
Well, six months into the pregnancy, it seems they've just realized the baby is 
going to wet its diaper sometimes. And -- is your heart breaking yet? -- the 
wife expects the husband to help her paint the baby's room-to-be! 
</P>
<P>
That, in fact, is what breaks this sorry couple up in "Little Footsteps," a 
travesty by Ted Tally now wetting its own diaper on the stage of the North 
Coast Repertory Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
The worst part, however, isn't that this couple breaks up -- that's a relief -- 
but that they get back together for more whining, accompanied by the 
shrill-voiced chorus of the wife's parents in the second act. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, folks, they are going to stay together for the sake of the baby because, 
as husband Ben says, the baby "deserves better" than to be brought up with one 
parent. 
</P>
<P>
The baby, a cute little tyke played by Christopher Bolles on Friday night, does 
deserve better than being brought up by either one of these characters, much 
less a double whammy. 
</P>
<P>
"Little Footsteps" might not be so bad if that's all it was. But it is also so 
offensive that it's depressing. 
</P>
<P>
Forget the insensitive way the playwright treats the interfaith marriage -- 
selfish, vulgar Jewish male marries sweet, incompetent Episcopalian girl. 
</P>
<P>
Forget the inept way he handles the issue of divorced parents, as if people 
should stay in bad marriages for the sake of the children. Forget the play's 
specious premise that an emotional narcissist like the father and an emotional 
vacuum like the mother are suddenly going to bloom into great parents simply 
because they looked at a cute baby face. 
</P>
<P>
The show is also a criminal waste of acting, directing and designing talent at 
a theater that usually knows better. No names are necessary. The guilty know 
who they are. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe we are helpless against the flood of yuppie angst now pouring into our 
theaters, movies and television screens. But we can demand some standards from 
the sad tales of how the young, well-educated and well-to-do cope with the same 
trials of relationships, work and child rearing that the poor routinely face 
without the benefit of fanfare or public sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
The movies "Baby Boom" and "Three Men and a Baby" at least tackled their 
situations with humor; television's "thirtysomething" often provides insights 
with clever self-deprecation. "Little Footsteps" is an emetic without the barf 
bag. 
</P>
<P>
Why Dori Salois, who produced as well as stars in it, was so in love with this 
property can go down with the Bermuda Triangle as one of the great mysteries of 
life. 
</P>
<P>
In one of the few good lines in the play, the husband refers to parenthood as 
"the unprepared undertaking the impossible for the sake of the ungrateful." 
</P>
<P>
Only, as usual in this play, he misses the point. It isn't the parents 
undertaking the impossible for the sake of the ungrateful here. It's the baby. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that the kid doesn't cry in the end is a testimony to his innocence. 
</P>
<P>

BUNDY CONFESSES TO 10 MORE MURDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

Theodore Bundy took responsibility for two Idaho murders and as many as eight 
in Utah, continuing tearful 11th-hour confessions even though they failed to 
bring him a stay of execution, officials said. Utah authorities had suspected 
Bundy in the deaths of two women and the disappearances of three others in 1974 
and 1975. But in a 1 1/2-hour prison interview with a detective late Sunday, 
"there was one incident where he mentioned eight," Sheriff Pete Hayward said in 
Salt Lake City. Idaho state Atty. Gen. Jim Jones said his chief investigator 
had met with Bundy and the condemned prisoner described two murders he said he 
committed in 1974 or 1975 in Idaho. Bundy has been on Death Row at Florida 
State Prison in Starke since July, 1979, and Jones said he had not been 
suspected in any unsolved Idaho crimes. Bundy, 42, is scheduled to die at 7 
a.m. Tuesday.

About 15,000 relatives, friends and Air Force officials flocked to the small, 
mountainous town of Utuado, Puerto Rico, for the funeral of the Puerto Rican 
pilot whose plane was shot down during a U.S. raid on Libya. The remains of Air 
Force Maj. Fernando Ribas-Dominicci, 33, were returned by Libya last week, 
three years after the downing of the plane. During the half-hour ceremony at 
the hillside San Andres de Utuado cemetery, four F-111 jet-fighters, the type 
Ribas-Dominicci piloted, flew over the small town, about 35 miles west of San 
Juan. The airman's wife, Blanca Berain, held their 7-year-old son's hand and 
wept as the planes flew in a "missing pilot" formation.

A San Quentin Prison guard was stabbed in the neck by an inmate serving a life 
sentence, prompting a lock-down of the facility, officials said. In the 
apparently unprovoked attack, the guard was stabbed in the right side of the 
neck while conducting an evening meal lock-up, said prison spokesman Cal White. 
The unidentified guard underwent surgery and is listed in good condition at 
Marin General Hospital. The unidentified inmate was placed in a prison wing 
that houses violent prisoners. A search turned up a weapon with a six-inch 
blade and a taped handle that was apparently made from a broken mirror, said 
White.

Frigid temperatures have stopped people cold across Alaska, where a dozen towns 
were locked up in the minus 50s and minus 60s, and the temperature hit 70 below 
zero at a truck stop in Coldfoot, on the trans-Alaska oil pipeline supply road. 
Even high temperatures were well below zero in most of Alaska, and temperatures 
were so low that much of the state has gone into hibernation. Planes that carry 
mail, groceries and people to numerous outlying villages have been grounded by 
extreme cold and, in some places, by ice fog -- dense fog formed by ice 
crystals.

A private London hospital denied British newspaper reports that it paid Turkish 
peasants $3,500 to donate their kidneys for transplant. The Humana Wellington 
Hospital said it has no evidence to back allegations being made in Turkey that 
the donors each received cash for one of their kidneys. It added that it will 
review its procedures and cooperate with an inquiry by authorities. In the 
latest report, the Sunday Telegraph said Turkish police last week arrested a 
bogus army colonel and charged him with masterminding a scheme to trick 
peasants into selling their kidneys.

A mother and son who operate a licensed foster-care and child day-care home in 
the Mira Mesa area of San Diego County have been arrested on suspicion of 
torturing children. Officials said Henri Mathis Dyson, 41, and her son, Harold 
Alexander Dyson, 24, were taken into custody after a 17-month-old boy in their 
care slipped into a coma after being administered an enema. Police said the 
Dysons are suspected of beating children tied to a whipping post and forcing 
them to sleep naked on a cold garage floor.

Soviet human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov was nominated by a mass public 
meeting as Moscow's at-large candidate in the March 26 election for the new 
Congress of People's Deputies. The meeting was organized by the Memorial 
Society, an unofficial group dedicated to the victims of the late dictator 
Josef Stalin. Sakharov, 67, was chosen last week as a candidate for the Oktybr 
district of Moscow. The second nomination makes him a candidate for the entire 
city, and in that contest, Sakharov is expected to run against Politburo member 
Vitaly I. Vorotnikov. The new congress, part of the reform effort in the Soviet 
Union, will choose more than 400 of its members to form a more active Supreme 
Soviet (Parliament).

East German Secretary of State for Religious Affairs Kurt Loeffler will visit 
Israel next week, Israeli officials said. Communist East Germany has never had 
diplomatic relations with Israel and until recently refused to accept any 
historical responsibility for the crimes of Nazi Germany. Loeffler is the most 
senior East Berlin official to visit the Jewish state. Israeli officials said 
they are not aware of plans to discuss East German reparations for the victims 
of Nazism, although East German leader Erich Honecker last year offered to pay 
compensation after talks with officials of the World Jewish Congress.

49ERS DEFEAT BENGALS, 20-16, IN SUPER BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the aftermath of three days of rioting in Miami's black neighborhoods, 
attention returned Sunday to Super Bowl XXIII, in which the San Francisco 49ers 
defeated the Cincinnati Bengals, 20-16, in front of 75,000 spectators in Joe 
Robbie Stadium and a nationwide television audience. 
</P>
<P>
As police patrolled quiet black neighborhoods and maintained checkpoints 
outside the stadium, the city's troubles gave way to one of the Super Bowl's 
most exciting finishes ever. Quarterback Joe Montana threw a 10-yard touchdown 
pass to John Taylor with 34 seconds left as San Francisco won its third 
National Football League championship of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lead Doesn't Hold Up 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati had taken a 16-13 lead on Jim Breech's third field goal of the game, 
a 40-yarder with 3:20 to play. But the lead did not hold up against one of 
football's most potent offenses. 
</P>
<P>
The winning score came at the end of a 92-yard drive, led by Montana, whose 
touchdown pass gave him a Super Bowl record with 357 yards passing. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor told television interviewers: "I was thinking if it comes to me, it's 
mine." 
</P>
<P>
Montana said he was trying to mount a drive to get his team in position to kick 
a potential tying field goal. 
</P>
<P>
"We just got going, thinking field goal," he said. "We never gave up. Things 
might go wrong, but you've got to fight back. That's one thing we never gave up 
on. Confidence. And it showed." 
</P>
<P>
Montana, the oft-injured 49er star, completed 23 of 36 passes and had two 
touchdowns and no interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven of Montana's completions were to Jerry Rice, who finished with 11 
catches for 215 yards, both also records. 
</P>
<P>
Rice, the Super Bowl most valuable player, said he was confident the 49ers 
could rally in the final minute. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew we (receivers) had to make the plays," he said. "Joe gave us the 
leadership we needed." 
</P>
<P>
Said Randy Cross, the All-Pro San Francisco center who played his last game 
after 13 seasons: "Montana has got to be the best quarterback of the '80s. He 
kept telling us on that last drive, we've got to believe, we've got to 
believe." 
</P>
<P>
In San Francisco, horns blared, fireworks lit the sky and strangers kissed in 
the streets as fans celebrating the 49ers' victory turned the city into an 
impromptu open-air party. 
</P>
<P>
The California Highway Patrol closed Highway 480 near the Embarcadero because 
of crowds in the area, and several city streets were closed because of the 
reveling fans. There were numerous arrests, most for being drunk in public, San 
Francisco police reported. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fifth straight victory for a National Football Conference team, but 
by far the most dramatic -- the previous four had been by an average score of 
41-14. 
</P>
<P>
The game was uneventful well into the third quarter, but Stanford Jennings 
enlivened the day near the end of the period with a 93-yard kickoff return to 
give Cincinnati a 13-6 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Until Jennings' return, the teams were resigned to two field goals each for a 
6-6 tie. 
</P>
<P>
But after the return, the game's tempo seemed to change. San Francisco's 
vaunted offense came to life at the beginning of the fourth quarter behind 
Montana, who led a quick 85-yard march down the field, culminated with a 
14-yard pass to Rice for a touchdown, which helped tie the score again. 
</P>
<P>
"It was one of the great games I've been involved in," 49ers Coach Bill Walsh 
said. "We put it together on the final drive." 
</P>
<P>
Media attention before the game was focused off the football field after a wave 
of racial unrest began Monday when an unarmed black motorcyclist, Clement 
Lloyd, was fatally shot by a police officer in Miami's predominantly black 
Overtown section. The motorcycle was being pursued for a traffic violation. His 
passenger, Allen Blanchard, later died of head wounds suffered when the 
motorcycle crashed. 
</P>
<P>
For the next three nights, crowds of angry blacks clashed with police, looted 
dozens of stores and burned 13 businesses. Two black men were killed, dozens 
injured and 400 arrested. Property damage was estimated at $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 black Miami residents gathered in the black Liberty City 
neighborhood for a rally to coincide with the game's kickoff to protest the 
police killings, but there was little trouble Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very quiet, there are no problems at all," police spokesman Raymond Lang 
said half an hour before the game started.

DRIVING AUTO RATES UP, INSURERS SAY; 
</P>
<P>
INFLATED CLAIMS SEEN AS FAST LANE TO EASY MONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
First there's the screeching of tires. 
</P>
<P>
Then comes the crash of metal on metal. 
</P>
<P>
And finally there is the tinkle of falling glass as headlights and taillights 
crumble to the pavement. 
</P>
<P>
These are the all-too-familiar sounds of motorists meeting by accident. 
</P>
<P>
But to many Californians, these are also the sounds of opportunity knocking, 
according to auto insurers who say Californians are routinely abusing the 
insurance system by running up thousands of dollars in unnecessary medical 
bills and pain-and-suffering claims. 
</P>
<P>
Simple but powerful incentives under California law -- such as the ability to 
collect multiple medical benefits from several insurance companies for the same 
injury -- are creating an atmosphere in which, the insurers say, an accident is 
not a tragedy but an opportunity to reap a financial windfall. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like hitting the lottery," said Melville P. Windle, general counsel of 
20th Century Insurance Co. 
</P>
<P>
Industry officials say it is these claims that are the engine driving runaway 
auto insurance rates in California. 
</P>
<P>
Trial lawyers and consumer advocates, most notably Ralph Nader, say that fraud 
is only part of the reason for high insurance rates. 
</P>
<P>
Even the insurers concede that eliminating fraud altogether would not make 
insurance cheap. One industry estimate is that cleaning up the fraud problem 
would mean a 7% to 17% cut in auto insurance rates, while other estimates run 
as high as 30%. 
</P>
<P>
Still, an examination of injury claims submitted to several California auto 
insurers reveals a pattern of large medical bills arising from even minor 
accidents -- some so insignificant that there was no damage to any vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Files reviewed by The Times showed that medical reports often differed only in 
the name of the patient -- with the diagnosis, cause, treatment and final 
billing amount almost identical to those of other patients visiting the same 
doctor. 
</P>
<P>
And, curiously, the files showed that accident victims often did not visit 
their neighborhood family physicians, but rather chose to see doctors and 
chiropractors miles away, at the suggestion of their attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
During the last 10 years, the rate at which Californians make claims against 
auto insurers for physical injuries has nearly doubled at some of the state's 
large insurers. The highest rates are recorded in metropolitan Los Angeles, 
where, on average, there is one bodily injury claim filed for almost every 
accident reported -- more than double the pace found in rural areas or smaller 
cities such as San Diego -- according to a study by 20th Century Insurance. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to conclude that people are double as fragile, or something else is 
at work . . . that something else is clearly wrong," said Rick Dinon, vice 
president of 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
The Automobile Club of Southern California reports that the frequency of 
physical-injury claims has jumped 32.4% over the last seven years, even though 
the frequency of accidents resulting in damage to autos fell by 6.5%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Few Have Visible Wounds 
</P>
<P>
What makes insurance officials skeptical of many of these bodily injury claims 
is that only a small percentage of all auto accident victims claiming personal 
injury have any wounds or other visible or verifiable injury. At the Automobile 
Club, for instance, only 10% of bodily injury claims have an "objective," or 
physically verifiable, injury. 
</P>
<P>
The remainder are for what medical officials refer to as soft-tissue, 
subjective injuries. 
</P>
<P>
In simpler terms, that means whiplash maladies -- sore backs, sore necks and 
headaches. 
</P>
<P>
Some medical authorities, such as Dr. Richard Corlin, speaker of the house of 
delegates of the California Medical Assn., said in an interview that "an 
overwhelming majority of these cases could have been treated adequately with 
home treatment of aspirin and heat and one or two visits to a family 
practitioner." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Peter Martin, president of the California Chiropractic Assn. and a 
practicing chiropractor in Lancaster, said "10 years ago they would just take 
aspirin and walk it off." 
</P>
<P>
But now victims of minor accidents are routinely seeking legal assistance and 
extended medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Greater Awareness 
</P>
<P>
Many attorneys and doctors defend the trend of increased medical claims by 
saying that it is rooted in a greater consumer awareness of legal rights and a 
heightened concern for personal health. 
</P>
<P>
But some also acknowledge that there is a pervasive and cynical desire among 
Californians to seize any opportunity to get even with the insurance industry. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not an attorney in California that hasn't had someone walk into his 
office and say, 'I just got hit and I want to make some money,' " said Will 
Glennon, legal analyst for the California Trial Lawyers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Glennon maintains that most attorneys would promptly show such a client to the 
door. "The job of an attorney is not to create injuries," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But hundreds of lawyers in California openly solicit personal-injury cases. 
Daytime television is filled with their ads, as are the Yellow Pages. 
</P>
<P>
And many California doctors regularly solicit attorneys to send them patients, 
according to Donald Kottler, a Los Angeles attorney who specializes in 
personal-injury cases and advertises his services in the Yellow Pages. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Defends Referrals 
</P>
<P>
Kottler defended the practice of steering clients to specific doctors who 
specialize in personal-injury lawsuit work. 
</P>
<P>
He said that many accident victims have no medical insurance and do not have 
the money to pay doctors, so he sends clients to physicians who are willing to 
wait to be paid until the claims are settled. 
</P>
<P>
Kottler said that many neighborhood family physicians "don't want to get 
involved" with lawsuits or are unwilling or unable to prepare the detailed 
medical reports necessary to build a successful claim file. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, not all or even a majority of these whiplash claims are pumped up 
or fraudulently invented. 
</P>
<P>
And there are a host of other reasons besides increasing medical claims for 
escalating insurance rates, including the inefficiency of some insurance 
companies, higher medical costs, worsening traffic and increased numbers of 
accidents. 
</P>
<P>
Critics suggest that insurance rates have grown at an even faster pace than the 
actual costs of the increased bodily injury claims. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dispute Claim of Insurers 
</P>
<P>
The legal and medical lobbyists say that the extent of fraud through pumped-up 
claims is nowhere near the magnitude claimed by the insurers. Still, early 
indications from a continuing RAND Corp. study of auto insurance claims 
indicates that there has been a sudden and sustained jump in lawsuits filed 
since 1985, following a 10-year period of flat growth. 
</P>
<P>
The growth is due to a number of factors such as changing legal precedents, the 
advent of attorney advertising, changing health concerns and social norms. 
</P>
<P>
People who have successfully milked the system often prod others to seek the 
same windfall. "People are talked into it by attorneys and their neighbors," 
said Michael Josephson of the Josephson Institute for the Advancement of 
Ethics. 
</P>
<P>
"It spreads by word of mouth," said J. David Cummins, a professor of insurance 
at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
In response to these changes, a complicated system has been created in which 
all the players now have a great financial interest. And the system is 
seemingly impossible to dismantle. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Making Claim Credible 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers send clients to doctors to form the basis of a credible claim, Kottler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors then often over-treat and test to an extreme out of fear of missing a 
real injury and then being sued for malpractice, according to Martin and 
Corlin. 
</P>
<P>
Insurance companies in turn pay off on many frivolous and questionable claims 
out of fear of being sued later for bad-faith dealings and because it is often 
cheaper to settle the claims than to fight them in court, claims executive 
acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
Even when cases are headed for trial, judges routinely pressure insurance 
companies to settle claims of less than $25,000 out of court, in an effort to 
clear packed court calendars. 
</P>
<P>
"Who's unhappy" about the trend? asked Dick Sacino, senior vice president of 
claims at CalFarm Insurance Co. "Not the doctors. Not the lawyers. And 
insurance companies can pass (the costs) along. If the public wants to tolerate 
this abuse, we'll deliver it." 
</P>
<P>
The myriad cases of what insurance company executives call "legalized fraud" or 
"claim inflation" are not the multimillion-dollar damage awards to 
quadriplegics and other severely injured victims. Those cases are rare and 
represent a small portion of an insurance company's costs, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Considered 'Peanuts' 
</P>
<P>
And the out-and-out fraud of staged accidents, while troublesome, is considered 
"peanuts" in comparison to the daily barrage of real, but deliberately 
inflated, cases, according to Sacino and other claims officials. 
</P>
<P>
Insurers say the most troublesome cases are the seemingly innocuous ones where 
medical treatment runs from $1,000 to $4,000 and requests for compensation run 
from $5,000 to $20,000. It is these relatively small cases that add up to 
billions of dollars annually. 
</P>
<P>
Several major insurers in the state allowed a Times reporter to review these 
whiplash and other soft-tissue injury claims files at random, under the 
condition that names of the claimants, doctors or lawyers not be used. 
</P>
<P>
One extreme case that illustrates the problem of growing medical claims was 
recently filed with the Automobile Club. 
</P>
<P>
In this case from Hollywood, a Mercedes-Benz carrying three occupants 
rear-ended a Cadillac carrying six people. The Mercedes driver, insured by the 
Automobile Club, admitted that he was at fault. 
</P>
<P>
There was no damage to either car, but all six occupants of the Cadillac sought 
and received medical care. Three ran up bills in excess of $3,500 each, and the 
others spent in excess of $2,500 each for treatment of sore backs and necks. 
</P>
<P>
Two passengers in the Mercedes also sought and received medical care in excess 
of $3,000 each for their sore backs and necks. 
</P>
<P>
Only the driver of the Mercedes did not seek medical care. He is also the only 
one of the nine people involved in the accident who is not in a legal position 
to sue for general damages, or the so-called pain-and-suffering awards. 
</P>
<P>
Pain and suffering is usually calculated at three to five times the value of 
medical care and lost wages. That legal precedent is seen as an incentive to 
all involved to run up, or build up, the medical bills as much as possible, 
insurers say. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of the Mercedes and the Cadillac, total claims for medical costs 
and pain and suffering are expected to top $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't believe that any trier of fact will believe (that this is a valid 
claim)," said Bruce W. Randall, director of claims for the Automobile Club. 
"But then, we have no evidence (that it is fraudulent). And if we are wrong, 
and they get an award (from an arbitrator or a jury) they can turn around and 
sue us for wrongful denial of the claim." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Get Multiple Payments 
</P>
<P>
In many cases, the medical costs have already been paid by the victim's own 
medical insurance, according to insurers. The injured can also file under the 
medical coverage of his own auto insurance for compensation. A third medical 
payment from the at-fault driver's insurance company is also gravy. 
</P>
<P>
So, even without a pain and suffering award, a victim with a $3,500 bill from a 
chiropractor could easily put $7,000 in his pocket even after paying off the 
doctor. And all insurance settlements are tax free. 
</P>
<P>
In another case that CalFarm Insurance claims manager Bud Myers called "very 
typical," one car rear-ended another in Los Angeles. One car sustained no 
damage, the other had damage of just $107. The driver of the not-at-fault car 
saw a doctor for whiplash and received $567.92 in care. She is suing for 
$5,000. CalFarm offered $2,000 to settle the case and indicated that it would 
not pay more than $2,750. The plaintiff's attorney would not budge and the 
matter is now headed for court. 
</P>
<P>
"In a vast majority of cases, there has been an accident, there has been an 
injury. But it is a matter of degree," Myers said. "The same accident 10 years 
ago would not result in medical claims. The same accident in Fresno would not 
result in a claim." 
</P>
<P>
In another low-speed rear-ender case submitted to CalFarm, three young laborers 
have filed suit. "Three people were in the car; three were injured. All with 
the same attorney, all the same injuries, all soft tissue (whiplash), all (had) 
90-day treatments," said Sacino, reading in a monotone suggesting that he has 
seen the same facts, from the same word processor, again and again. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$8,916 Medical Bill 
</P>
<P>
The total medical bill came to $8,916 -- half of which was for medical tests 
rather than therapy or treatment. Their attorney has asked for $15,000 for each 
of the plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
CalFarm plans to offer $7,500 each, and hopes to actually settle for $10,000 
apiece, or $30,000, in this routine case. 
</P>
<P>
"They may have been hurt, but were they hurt $10,000 worth?" asked Sacino, 
adding that he thinks this is a classic case of what has become know in the 
industry as "building up" a claim. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not fraud in the true sense of the word; it is not a staged accident. The 
build-up is a difficult kind of fraud (to prove). It's in degrees," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Insurance claims executives displayed a cynicism of their own. 
</P>
<P>
Some victims who saw doctors immediately following an accident were faulted for 
not waiting to see if the injury would go away naturally. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Basis for Lawsuit 
</P>
<P>
Others who did wait, and visited a doctor weeks after an accident, were 
suspected of seeing the physician only as a basis for filing a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
It difficult to tell who is actually suffering from whiplash and who is not. 
</P>
<P>
But until recently, insurers have had a great incentive to settle even 
questionable cases. A landmark 1978 California Supreme Court ruling known as 
the Royal Globe decision, gave accident victims the right to sue insurance 
companies for bad-faith dealings. If an insurer made a low offer to settle a 
claim and the injured party later received a much higher award from a jury, he 
could then sue the insurer for tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Four months ago, the high court reversed itself. 
</P>
<P>
It is still unclear what immediate effect the reversal is having on frivolous 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
Some insurance executives say claims adjusters are inclined to follow the old 
rule and pay off on many marginal claims. Trial attorneys, however, say the 
insurers started delaying claims settlements right after the Royal Globe 
decision was reversed. 
</P>
<P>
And just how much money would be saved by eliminating marginal cases is also 
unclear. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Reduce Costs 
</P>
<P>
Stanley Zax, president of Zenith Insurance and former head of the Assn. of 
California Insurance Companies, said that cutting fraudulent claims out of the 
system could cut auto insurance rates by 7% to 17%. 
</P>
<P>
Cummins, the professor at the Wharton School of Business, said that estimate is 
conservative. 
</P>
<P>
Cummins, who said California insurance claim rates are "outrageous," suggested 
that cutting out fraud and frivolous claims could lower rates by 30%. And 
"squeezing the fat" out of the insurance companies could save an additional 
10%, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Insurance industry critics question whether fraudulent claims are as much of a 
problem as the insurers say. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey Rosenfield, consumer advocate and Proposition 103 author, Glennon and 
others said they believe the problem is a minor one. The insurance industry is 
using the issue as leverage to usher in a no-fault system of auto insurance, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors, lawyers and consumer advocates say that wholesale changes in the 
system are not warranted. 
</P>
<P>
They say that if fraudulent claims are the problem, then the solution is to 
prosecute offenders. 
</P>
<P>
Said Glennon: "To the extent fraud is out there, let's do something about it; 
let's clean it up."

According to figures supplied by the Automobile Club of Southern California, 
the frequency at which motorists filed bodily injury claims rose by 32.4% 
during the first seven years of the decade, while the frequency of accidents 
that actually resulted in damage to vehicles dropped by 6.5%. Verifiable 
injuries, such as broken bones, cuts and bruises, represent just 10% of the 
claims filed. The vast majority of claims are for so-called whiplash injuries 
-- primarily sore backs, stiff necks and headaches.

'COLD WAR IS NOT OVER,' BUSH ADVISER CAUTIONS; 
</P>
<P>
SCOWCROFT SAYS NEW ADMINISTRATION IS SKEPTICAL OF SOVIET 'PEACE OFFENSIVE,' 
WILL WARN ALLIES

<P>
Declaring "the Cold War is not over," President Bush's national security 
adviser, Brent Scowcroft, said Sunday that the new Administration views Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's "peace offensive" with deep skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
Scowcroft said that Gorbachev's announced plan to cut Soviet military forces 
and military spending is driven by "awesome" economic and political problems at 
home and is at least partly inspired by a desire to drive a wedge between the 
United States and Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
He said that one of the Bush Administration's first foreign policy priorities 
will be to chill the euphoria created by Gorbachev's initiatives and persuade 
the European allies not to be blinded by "wishful thinking" about Soviet 
intentions. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's moves represent "a recognition on his part that he badly needs a 
period of stability, if not definite improvement in the relationship, so he can 
face the awesome problem he has at home of trying to restructure that economy. 
That's his basic objective," Scowcroft said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think, also, he's interested in making trouble within the Western alliance, 
and I think he believes that the best way to do it is a peace offensive, rather 
than to bluster the way some of his predecessors have." 
</P>
<P>
In his first television interview in the new Administration, on ABC's "This 
Week With David Brinkley," the former Air Force general gave a sweeping 
overview of the foreign affairs challenges facing Bush in his first months in 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Scowcroft said the Bush Administration will follow up on the Reagan 
Administration's opening to Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser 
Arafat, although he showed lingering skepticism about Arafat's motives in 
stating that he has renounced terrorism and accepts Israel's right to exist. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me that the important thing is to try to probe and find out what 
Arafat has in mind and how sincere, in fact, this conversion is," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Scowcroft opposed an early meeting between Arafat and incoming Secretary of 
State James A. Baker III, throwing a damper on a flurry of Sunday press reports 
from the Middle East that spoke of efforts to arrange such a meeting. 
</P>
<P>
A state-run newspaper in Abu Dhabi said that Egypt has invited Baker to visit 
the region to pave the way for an international peace conference and meet with 
Arafat during the visit. A Saudi Arabian newspaper reported that consultations 
are under way to prepare for a Baker-Arafat meeting in Tunis in mid-February. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arafat Meeting 'Premature' 
</P>
<P>
"I think it would be premature to meet at such a high level until we have a 
better indication of where Mr. Arafat may be going," Scowcroft replied when 
asked specifically about the subject. 
</P>
<P>
Scowcroft also said that the United States will conduct a deliberate review of 
defense and arms control policy before returning to strategic arms reduction 
talks (START) with the Soviet Union. Bush will not automatically adopt the 
Reagan Administration's negotiating positions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not trying to slow down or delay . . ," he said, "but they're going to 
be our START talks, our proposals, and we have to make sure that, in fact, they 
are ours and we're comfortable with them." 
</P>
<P>
Scowcroft also deplored the spread of chemical and biological weapons as a 
"very, very serious problem," but he admitted that he is not optimistic that it 
can be halted. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a problem akin in its scope to that of nuclear proliferation because 
these weapons, especially in city attacks and in anti-population attacks, can 
be every bit as devastating as nuclear weapons, and they are much harder to 
control because the plants to produce them are, in many cases, like 
pharmaceutical plants, like insecticide plants. It's a terrible problem," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Libya Chemical Plant 
</P>
<P>
He would not say whether the United States is seriously considering a military 
strike to destroy a suspected chemical weapons plant under construction in 
Libya. "I'm not about to make that choice now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Scowcroft also said he is not optimistic about prospects in El Salvador, where 
the democratically elected president, Jose Napoleon Duarte, is in failing 
health and the violent right wing is experiencing a resurgence. 
</P>
<P>
He said the situation in the small Central American country is analogous to 
that of 1981, when the Marxist-led insurgency began what it called a "final 
offensive" toward overthrowing the government that was met by bloody repression 
from the right. 
</P>
<P>
Scowcroft's remarks about Gorbachev's skillful manipulation of opinion in 
Western Europe were echoed on the same television program by Democratic Sen. 
Sam Nunn of Georgia, the influential chairman of the Senate Armed Services 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn said Gorbachev's "rhetoric" would likely amplify calls in the United 
States and Europe for a reduction in defense spending and cuts in troop levels 
stationed on European soil. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Call for Alertness 
</P>
<P>
"Gorbachev may unmake NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) if we're not 
alert as to what our future holds and if we're not certain that the (Soviet) 
forces have been reduced before we start relaxing in the alliance," Nunn said. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn, whose committee this week begins confirmation hearings for former Sen. 
John Tower as secretary of defense, said that Tower is in for "some tough 
questions" about his personal life and possible conflicts of interest. 
</P>
<P>
Since leaving the Senate in 1985, Tower has represented half a dozen major 
defense contractors as a Washington lobbyist and adviser. Questions also have 
been raised, although no charges have been proven, about alleged drinking and 
womanizing by Tower. 
</P>
<P>
"We are checking into a lot of allegations floating around," Nunn said. "We're 
checking into the conflict of interest." But he indicated that Tower is "well 
qualified" and said he expects him to be confirmed.

South Korean riot police clashed with thousands of anti-government and 
anti-American protesters during a march called by a day-old alliance of 
dissident groups. A crowd of 5,000 to 10,000 massed in a Seoul street, then 
headed toward the headquarters of President Roh Tae Woo's ruling party. Their 
way was blocked by police, who responded with tear gas when the protesters 
threw gasoline bombs and rocks. The protest was called by the Coalition for a 
National Democratic Movement.

REPORT OF GERMAN AID FOR LIBYAN JETS IS REINFORCED; 
</P>
<P>
DER SPIEGEL CARRIES PHOTOS PURPORTED TO SHOW USE OF AERIAL REFUELING TECHNOLOGY 
FROM MUNICH FIRM

A national newsmagazine published photographs Sunday to reinforce its assertion 
that a West German firm is furnishing air-to-air refueling technology to Libya 
that will give Col. Moammar Kadafi's fighter-bombers range enough to reach 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Der Spiegel printed four photographs, taken from a videotape, purporting to 
show a French-built Mirage jet of the Libyan air force nosing into a refueling 
drogue from another plane. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine said that Intec, a Munich-based company, had helped convert 
U.S.-built, Libyan-owned C-130 and Boeing 707 transport planes into refueling 
tankers to service the attack jets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Israel Within Range 
</P>
<P>
"The fighter jets are now able to fly to and from Israel," the magazine's story 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Der Spiegel also published a letter it said was from Intec to a technician 
involved in the assistance project. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine made its initial assertion about Intec last week, and Bonn's chief 
government spokesman, Friedhelm Ost, promptly denied the allegation, saying 
that Intec had sent two fuel tanks to Libya but that these could be used only 
on the ground and not in the air. 
</P>
<P>
Ost has several times lately been forced to change his public denials of West 
German companies' involvement in Libyan projects, notably those concerning a 
chemical weapons plant that Washington charges is being built at Rabta, south 
of the Libyan capital of Tripoli. Libya insists that the plant is intended to 
produce only pharmaceutical chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
3 Years in Libya 
</P>
<P>
Der Spiegel reported in its current edition, which will be on the newsstands 
today, that technicians recruited by Intec have been working in Libya for the 
last three years, and the published letter it said was from the company to a 
technician was dated Dec. 20, 1985. The letter referred to the "operation in 
North Africa." 
</P>
<P>
According to the magazine's account, Washington told the Kohl administration 
about Intec's arrangement with Libya in May, 1988. But it was only after the 
furor over the Libyan chemical complex surfaced that the West German government 
said Intec was under investigation for possible breach of export laws. 
</P>
<P>
In its current edition, Der Spiegel also reported that a state-owned East 
German company supplied steel parts for the Libyan complex at Rabta. 
</P>
<P>
Quoting intelligence sources and others, the magazine said that the state firm, 
VEB Metalleichtbau Kombinat, was aware that the Libyan plant is intended to 
produce chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Approached by Barbouti 
</P>
<P>
According to the magazine's account, the East German firm was originally 
approached by Ihsan Barbouti, a London-based, Iraqi-born entrepreneur whose 
defunct Frankfurt company is under investigation for allegedly having supplied 
goods and services to the Rabta factory. The magazine said the East German 
company furnished 10 steel construction elements weighing 800 tons each for 
Rabta. 
</P>
<P>
East German officials knew that "these civilian materials were intended for 
totally different purposes," Der Spiegel said, adding that in 1987 the East 
Germans tightened controls on exports of materials that could be used to make 
chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a West German parliamentary panel is scheduled this week to examine 
charges that West German scientists might be involved in an Iraqi government 
program to make biological weapons.

Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi suffered a double blow Sunday, with his Congress-I 
Party heading for a humiliating electoral defeat in south India and a key 
political lieutenant forced to resign. 
</P>
<P>
The regional Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam party, known as the DMK, appeared 
certain to win an absolute majority in the Tamil Nadu state assembly after the 
election Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"We have won the election. That is how it looks," party leader Muthuvel 
Karunanidhi told reporters as thousands of jubilant supporters besieged his 
headquarters in Madras. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Holds Wide Lead 
</P>
<P>
With more than half the ballots counted, the DMK or its allies led in 151 of 
the 232 constituencies, the government election agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
The Congress-I Party was ahead in 35 districts. 
</P>
<P>
Gandhi's problems were compounded when the party leadership asked the 
Congress-I chief minister of Madhya Pradesh state, Arjun Singh, to resign after 
a court ordered an inquiry into a lottery with which his family is connected. 
</P>
<P>
Gandhi, whose government has been battered by corruption charges in the last 
year, sent Singh to Madhya Pradesh in central India last year to rebuild the 
Congress-I's fortunes before national elections. 
</P>
<P>
Singh denied in his resignation statement that he had done any wrong.

BUSH MAY EXTEND ASIA TRIP AFTER HIROHITO RITES; 
</P>
<P>
DECISION ON VISITS TO S. KOREA AND CHINA WILL SEND A SIGNAL ON U.S. POLICY

<P>
In its first days in office, the Bush Administration will have to decide 
whether the President should risk offending the Japanese by making some quick 
stops in other Asian countries next month after he attends the funeral of 
Emperor Hirohito. 
</P>
<P>
This is one of the issues that will have to be settled quickly, probably within 
the next week, as the new Administration begins to sort out its plans and 
priorities for its first few weeks in office. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever Bush does will be taken as an early signal of future U.S. policy 
toward Asia: Does Japan, in the American view of Asia, stand alone, on a 
different plane from all other countries in the region? Or is it seen as merely 
one -- admittedly the most important -- of several nations in East Asia in 
which the United States has important interests? 
</P>
<P>
Ever since it was announced that Bush would fly to Tokyo for the Feb. 24 
funeral, officials in both China and South Korea have let it be known they 
would like to have the new President stop in their countries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Significance Seen 
</P>
<P>
From the standpoint of American foreign policy, U.S. officials say, such stops 
could prove to be of considerable significance. For example, Bush could see 
China's senior leader, Deng Xiaoping, and stress the continuing importance of 
ties between China and the United States a few months before Soviet President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev is scheduled to make his own ground-breaking trip to 
Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
In the weeks since Hirohito's death, U.S. policy-makers have been debating the 
wisdom of a quick Asian swing next month by the new President. 
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, such a trip would take at least a couple of extra days of the 
President's time during his precious "honeymoon" period at home. On the other 
hand, it isn't often that an American President makes the long trek across the 
Pacific -- and once he does, it seems an inefficient use of time to have him 
stop only in Japan before flying home. 
</P>
<P>
But there are Japanese sensibilities to consider if Bush travels elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"My own feeling is that it (an extended tour) would be a mistake, given the 
nature of the funeral and the early days of the new Administration," said one 
State Department official. "The Japanese are so important to us that I think it 
would be unwise to convey a signal that we consider them as one stop along the 
way." 
</P>
<P>
Another State Department official disagreed. "I don't think it would be any 
great offense to Japan for him (Bush) to go elsewhere. The great offense to the 
Japanese would have been if Bush had not gone to the funeral in the first 
place." 
</P>
<P>
After Hirohito's death on Jan. 6, Japanese officials made it plain they would 
like to have the new President head the American delegation to the state 
funeral. 
</P>
<P>
Not every nation responded to such requests. In Australia, Prime Minister Bob 
Hawke said he had never considered attending Hirohito's funeral. In New 
Zealand, Defense Minister Robert Tizard suggested that Hirohito should have 
been executed after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
But Bush agreed to go to Tokyo, where he will be one of about 100 foreign 
leaders at the rites. U.S. officials have said they expect the President -- 
along with Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who will also be in the 
American delegation -- to meet with some of these other foreign leaders in 
Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman told a news conference in 
Beijing that Bush would be welcome to visit China after the Hirohito funeral. 
If the President does visit Beijing, it might well be considered a snub for him 
not to stop also in Seoul, where South Korean officials have said they hope for 
a summit with Bush.

ABRAMS LEAVES STATE DEPT. JOB AS HE CAME IN -- SPEAKING OUT

"I don't have any regrets at all," said Elliott Abrams, the Reagan 
Administration's least-loved assistant secretary of state. 
</P>
<P>
And to show that he means it, Abrams' repertoire of malediction remains as rich 
as ever. His opponents, he says, are "vipers," President Daniel Ortega of 
Nicaragua is "a liar" and members of Congress who blocked U.S. aid to 
Nicaraguan rebels "will have . . . blood on their hands." 
</P>
<P>
Almost three years ago, Abrams became the Reagan Administration's chief 
strategist on Latin America, vowing to bring Nicaragua's Sandinista regime to 
its knees. Later, he added Panama's strongman, Gen. Manuel A. Noriega, to his 
list. 
</P>
<P>
Abrams left office Friday; he has not sought, nor has he been offered, a job in 
the Bush Administration. In Nicaragua and Panama, both Ortega and Noriega are 
still firmly in power. And Abrams admits only one major error: not being 
tougher. 
</P>
<P>
"When you look back eight years, a mistake was made in 1981 in the approach to 
this problem (in Nicaragua), which was to try to put it on a middle burner or a 
back burner," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see where we've been able to achieve a sensible negotiated solution 
unless we've placed great pressure on the Communist side," he said. "And great 
pressure will be needed now." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Argument for Use of Force 
</P>
<P>
Does that mean the United States should have intervened in Nicaragua with 
military force? "You can make a very good argument" for that idea, Abrams told 
an interviewer recently -- the idea that "the President should simply have 
said, 'Look, we have to enforce the Monroe Doctrine; we cannot have a Communist 
government in Nicaragua,' and (we should have) done whatever we needed to do to 
get rid of it, including a naval blockade or possibly even an invasion." 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't actually proposing an invasion, Abrams explained later -- merely 
offering "a very good argument." 
</P>
<P>
That has often seemed the essence of Abrams' stormy diplomatic career: a candid 
love of argument, a zest for saying things bluntly instead of clinging to 
Washington's customary gray euphemisms. 
</P>
<P>
Part of it, friends say, is that Abrams is brilliant -- and still believes in 
his ability to convince others by sheer force of argument. Part of it is that 
he is a neo-conservative, a former Democrat whose greatest passion is not 
merely advancing a policy but proving his liberal opponents wrong as well. 
</P>
<P>
The result has been a great divide: a few fiercely loyal and admiring friends, 
but a great many enemies. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a charter member of the Elliott Abrams fan club," said Rep. Henry J. Hyde 
(R-Ill.), one of the Contras' champions on Capitol Hill. "It is an elevating 
experience to find someone who believes in something and is willing to fight 
for it." 
</P>
<P>
"Elliott Abrams has done tremendous damage to relations between the executive 
branch and Congress," countered Rep. Sam Gejdenson (D-Conn.), a Contra foe. 
"There's no question that we didn't get the truth in our exchanges with him, 
and that is one of the gravest assaults on the way our system works." 
</P>
<P>
Hyde and others defend Abrams against the charge of misleading Congress. But 
even Abrams' allies acknowledge that his give-no-quarter style did not help 
broaden support for the Administration's policies in Central America. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Low 'Grovel Quotient' 
</P>
<P>
"Diplomacy is the art of the compromise, the art of the possible," Hyde said. 
"His virtues to us are vices to others. He wasn't temperamentally able to back 
and fill and grovel. To succeed in diplomacy, one's grovel quotient has to be 
fairly high -- and his wasn't." 
</P>
<P>
Inside the State Department, too, assessments of Abrams' performance are 
divided. "Elliott's problem is that he believes too much of his own rhetoric," 
one subordinate said. "The policy's been falling apart, but it took him a long 
time to recognize it." 
</P>
<P>
Even Secretary of State George P. Shultz has expressed some regret over the 
outcome of the Reagan Administration's policy in Central America. In several 
recent interviews, Shultz has said the Administration may have missed an 
opportunity to negotiate with Nicaragua in 1987 -- when Shultz proposed sending 
a special envoy to open talks with Managua but Abrams and other Administration 
hard-liners persuaded President Reagan to block the move. 
</P>
<P>
But Shultz has also stuck doggedly by Abrams despite demands from Democrats in 
Congress that he be fired. During the Iran-Contra affair, Abrams lied to the 
Senate Intelligence Committee in an attempt to conceal a State Department 
effort to raise money for the Contras from foreign governments. He later 
apologized, but some members of Congress never forgave the offense. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, Shultz pointedly gave Abrams one of the State Department's major 
honors, the Secretary's Award for Distinguished Service. And two weeks ago, 
Shultz spoke warmly of Abrams at a farewell ceremony, lauding him as 
"invaluable," according to officials who attended. 
</P>
<P>
"I owe Secretary Shultz a debt that I can never repay," Abrams replied. "But 
that's appropriate, since most of the countries I work with (in Latin America) 
also have debts that can never be repaid," he quipped, alluding to the vast 
foreign debts of most of the countries in the region. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Faults Congress 
</P>
<P>
If his goals in Nicaragua were not met, he said, that was the fault of 
Congress, which cut off military aid to the Contras when they were -- in his 
view -- approaching victory. And if the U.S. attempt to topple Noriega failed, 
he said, that was the fault of others in the Administration who resisted his 
proposals for action -- proposals that reportedly included a plan to kidnap the 
Panamanian dictator. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, though, Abrams said he views his tenure as a success: for having 
supported the movement toward democracy in most of the countries of Latin 
America, for setting a conservative Republican Administration against military 
dictatorships and for what success he did achieve in supporting the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
"In a sense, what's remarkable is how well we did, given the polls," he said. 
"We have never had a majority for military aid (for the Contras) . . . but 
Congress voted for it several times." 
</P>
<P>
And Abrams, still only 40, made it clear that he plans to be back in government 
after a stint at the conservative Heritage Foundation and some practice as a 
lawyer and investment banker.

SQUIRRELED AWAY, FERRETS WEASEL A SECOND CHANCE

<P>
Deep in the basement of a suburban house, 220 homeless ferrets frolic with toy 
balls, crawling tubes and other ferret-phernalia in a makeshift halfway house 
for the weasel-like creatures. 
</P>
<P>
The animals, all given up by their owners or between homes, are the pride and 
joy of Mary van Dahm, who keeps 14 ferrets of her own upstairs. 
</P>
<P>
It started 18 months ago, when a group of Chicago-area residents formed the 
Greater Chicago Ferret Assn. Van Dahm, the only founding officer with a 
basement, was asked to run the shelter. She agreed. 
</P>
<P>
So when a Chicago woman recently asked her veterinarian how she could dispose 
of two pet ferrets her son had outgrown, she was referred to Van Dahm. 
</P>
<P>
In her basement, the ferrets live in cages until new owners claim them. "We've 
gotten ferrets from all over the country," said Van Dahm, who prefers to keep 
her address secret so as not to disturb her neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the animals came from New Jersey. A batch arrived from Kentucky after 
Louisville animal welfare agents seized 19 ferrets from a woman who kept them 
in a cramped back-yard shed. 
</P>
<P>
Others were relinquished by disenchanted owners. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not what I expected," one woman said. She complained that her ferret 
did not like to sit in her lap to be stroked like a cat. 
</P>
<P>
"They are more exotic than dogs or cats," Van Dahm said. "They are good for 
apartment dwellers, because they are small and can be kept in cages most of the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
About 10,000 of an estimated 5 million pet ferrets in the nation are in the 
Chicago area, said Janice Miller, president of the Greater Chicago Ferret 
Assn., based in suburban Westchester. The animals usually are not legal as pets 
in California. 
</P>
<P>
Ferret lovers say the animal's reputation as a sometimes-vicious biter is 
unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
Often mistaken for rodents, ferrets are related to weasels and minks. They can 
be trained to use litter boxes and will eat cat food.

DEVELOPERS, NATIVE HAWAIIANS SQUARE OFF ON CULTURAL ISSUES; 
</P>
<P>
BATTLE OVER ANCIENT BURIAL SITE HALTS NEW MAUI HOTEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Protesters angry that ancient human remains were dug up to make way for a 
luxury hotel have halted a Maui island resort's construction and given new life 
to the fight between developers hoping to lure more tourists here and Hawaiian 
activists trying to preserve the islands' culture. 
</P>
<P>
"Although this land was once ruled by Hawaiians, they are no longer part of the 
power elite. I don't think this could happen to the grave site of a more 
powerful group," said Hawaiian activist Edward Kanahele, a spokesman for the 
group Malama Na Kapuna, or Caring for Our Ancestors. "It's been painful for us 
to see so many other burial sites paved over or dug up, but we were never 
organized enough before. Now we are." 
</P>
<P>
It was hundreds of protesters like Kanahele, with the sympathy of part-Hawaiian 
Gov. John Waihee, who forced a temporary halt Dec. 23 to the excavation of the 
second-largest known Hawaiian burial site in this island chain. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
900 Skeletons Exhumed 
</P>
<P>
By then, more than 900 skeletons had been exhumed, most believed to have been 
buried more than 1,000 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
But the state cannot force Kapa-lua Land Co. Inc. to give up its plan to build 
the nearly $100-million, 450-room Ritz Carlton hotel on Maui's northwest shore. 
</P>
<P>
Kapalua has the county-issued construction permits it needs, and halted the 
excavation only as long as it takes to work out a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
Kanahele said it was up to Hawaii residents concerned with its history and 
culture to stop the "desecration of burial sites and removal of our culture." 
</P>
<P>
As recently as 20 years ago, when bones were regularly found at construction 
sites, they were often burned, thrown away or just left at the site. That 
treatment was considered desecration; according to ancient Hawaiian tradition, 
a person's "mana," or spirit, lived on with his remains. 
</P>
<P>
"We mainly have to look at the morality and religious aspects of this issue," 
Kanahele said. "Those bones have been buried there for thousands of years, they 
are our history and our culture. We should not be swayed by the brief economic 
interlude provided by a hotel that surely won't last as long as those remains." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Says Firm Knew of Site 
</P>
<P>
Kapalua Land is a subsidiary of Maui Land &amp; Pineapple Co., and the latter's 
chairman, Colin Cameron, said the presence of the burial ground was known 
before the site was chosen. He said he worked closely with Maui County and the 
Office of Hawaiian Affairs, a state agency that represents native Hawaiian 
interests, before the construction permits were granted. 
</P>
<P>
"OHA knew all along that it was a large and possibly very significant site and 
they agreed to the excavation," said Paul Rosendahl, an archeologist hired to 
excavate the grounds. He reported weekly to OHA and a Maui Hawaiian group after 
the dig began. 
</P>
<P>
But Linda Delaney, the OHA's land and natural resources officer, said the 
site's significance has only recently become clear. "The history of the site 
wasn't well documented and people just didn't realize how many people were 
buried there," she said. "Now that we know, we're trying to stop it." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, OHA passed a resolution calling for a permanent halt to the 
excavation, reburial of the remains, consultation with local Hawaiian activist 
groups and the designation of the 2.3-acre burial site as "culturally 
sensitive" and off-limits to development. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Appeal to Conscience 
</P>
<P>
When asked where that leaves the development company, which has already poured 
$3 million into the project, Delaney said: "I don't know what happens to the 
hotel. Those are the kinds of questions that need to be worked out . . . . We 
have to appeal to the community conscience, the developer's conscience." 
</P>
<P>
Kapalua Land agreed to rebury the bones about a mile from the hotel site. With 
the excavation 85% complete, it is too late to preserve the original burial 
site, Cameron said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he was surprised by opposition to the dig. Excavation began in August 
of 1987, and there were no protests at the site until last December. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the remains are being stored at the Kapalua site, said Rosendahl, 
who would like to analyze the skeletons. "It's such a complete population," he 
said. "We could learn so much about the ancient Hawaiian culture from this 
dig." 
</P>
<P>
But Kanahele said the activists do not want the bones dusted off. 
</P>
<P>
"Their afterlife has already been affected," he said. "They've gone through 
enough."

NUDE MAN ARRESTED IN HIT-RUN DEATH 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A nude man shouting "Hail Satan" as he strolled through a popular Malibu 
beachfront restaurant was arrested and later linked to a fatal hit-run crash, 
authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Brian L. Harlow, 28, of Malibu, allegedly was driving a stolen pickup truck 
involved in a Pacific Coast Highway crash minutes before the Friday night 
restaurant escapade that led to his arrest, California Highway Patrol Officer 
Monte Keifer said. 
</P>
<P>
Harlow, hospitalized briefly for observation at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, was 
booked for investigation of murder and was being held without bail Sunday at 
the Los Angeles County Jail, Keifer said. 
</P>
<P>
Five minutes after entering the Charthouse restaurant yelling "Hail Satan," he 
walked through the crowded bar to an outside patio and down to a rocky 
outcropping on the beach, where he was detained by authorities. 
</P>
<P>
A stolen pickup truck Harlow reportedly left running in the restaurant parking 
lot was involved in a fatal accident Friday night in Corral Canyon, said CHP 
Officer Richard Perez. "The pickup driver hit a motorcycle from behind, 
rear-ended it, then kept going," the officer said. 
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old passenger on the motorcycle, a recently discharged sailor from 
Norfolk, Va., was killed. Identification was withheld until relatives could be 
contacted. The motorcyclist suffered minor injuries, Perez said.

HIGH SCHOOL'S EATERY OFFERS STUDENT STAFF A RECIPE FOR SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For many people who eat at the Hungry Tiger, the bungalow cafe on the Paradise 
Hills campus of Morse High School is just a nice little place for an 
inexpensive but tasty breakfast or lunch. 
</P>
<P>
After all, there are few places in town for 2-inch-thick French toast "made 
from butter bread, dipped in egg, milk and cinnamon batter, toasted golden 
brown and served with butter and syrup," all for $1. Or the luncheon menu's 
fish sandwich and chips for $2, "delectable tidbits of breaded Atlantic Ocean 
Cod, served on a toasted bun, served with French fries, tartar sauce, malt 
vinegar and a slice of lemon." 
</P>
<P>
To the Morse faculty and staff, and school guests who make up the restaurant's 
clientele, the attentive, though inexperienced, student employees who prepare 
and serve the food enhance the already informal, unpretentious atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Larger Role at Play 
</P>
<P>
Only after several visits to the Hungry Tiger -- and the chance to talk and 
watch the students and their instructor in action -- do people begin to 
perceive the larger role this unique vocational education course plays. 
</P>
<P>
For Dewayne Schilling, who founded the two-semester course 17 years ago and has 
shaped it ever since, his goal with the 90 or more students he teaches annually 
is not primarily to train legions of future food-service workers. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, you can't lose knowing how to cook and prepare food," said Schilling, 
who, before returning to college for his teaching credentials, enjoyed a 
food-service career in the Air Force, working for a while on the presidential 
jet, Air Force One, for Lyndon B. Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
"But my philosophy is rather to show these kids how to find jobs, the mechanics 
of staying on the job and being successful, how to work with people and how to 
develop positive attitudes toward people and life. 
</P>
<P>
"With that emphasis, they can go into the food business or any other business, 
work part time in cooking while going to college, whatever. It's a win-win 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
Add to Schilling's philosophy his caring but firm attitude toward students, and 
the recipe is complete for a course that shows how vocational education can 
coexist -- even complement -- the so-called basic-skills curriculum of 
</P>
<P>
English, math and social studies at a time when job-related study has come 
under fire. 
</P>
<P>
"We always perceive academics and vocational courses as either-or," said 
Shirley Weber, the new San Diego city schools trustee from the Morse area and a 
strong supporter of an improved basic-subjects curriculum. "I think that the 
Hungry Tiger shows we can have both and they can complement each other. We do 
need these functional courses, but what I don't want are situations where 
students are put only into (vocational education courses) and not given other 
options." 
</P>
<P>
"This is a great program," teacher Connie Phillips said between bites of Hungry 
Tiger chili last week. "Dewayne has accomplished things for his students that 
you wouldn't believe. These kids learn about math, work ethics, politeness as 
much here as in any other classroom." 
</P>
<P>
Schilling does all this while shuttling from the dining room, where he guides 
students on how to approach customers, to the well-equipped but frenetic 
kitchen, where students at the short-order grill tackle the art of mixing 
pancake batter while others handle vats of carrot cake mix near the ovens. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Eric Fernandez was waiting on tables last week as part of his 
two-hour-a-day course work at the Hungry Tiger. "I took the course because I 
wanted some job experience in any category, and I also wanted to raise my 
grade-point average," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez credited Schilling with showing him how to prepare for a job and 
present himself in a positive manner. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Stresses Teamwork' 
</P>
<P>
"I think that also I've been helped with my other courses," the soft-spoken 
Fernandez said. "Mr. Schilling stresses teamwork, learning how to work with 
other people, how you should never give up on any work, that you should try 
hard, and that you can make new friends." Fernandez plans to attend college 
next year and might consider a career in the military. 
</P>
<P>
Vocational education has been criticized strongly in recent years for 
emphasizing too much training for specific occupations and for not stressing 
enough links to academics. Academic core-class requirements for graduation have 
increased in districts nationwide, leaving less time for students to take 
vocational classes. Educators expect that only those classes flexible enough to 
adapt to the educational reform movement will survive. 
</P>
<P>
"I know about the criticism, but, at the same time, 85% of the student 
population probably is not going to college," Schilling said. "I'm not saying 
don't teach algebra, no way am I saying that. But I am saying that for some 
students, why not set up algebra or science like our class is structured, where 
we have class work instruction in the first semester, and then in the second 
semester we apply it. You could measure angles on buildings or understand 
decibels as they correlate to the kids' music." 
</P>
<P>
Schilling said that success with his course requires that students perform as 
well as they do in their core classes. When Schilling teaches baking, he 
emphasizes that correct measurements and formulas are critical to a decent cake 
or blueberry muffin. 
</P>
<P>
"Baking is an exact science, and the kids then begin to see a relationship 
between school and success in life, and they'll lean back and say, 'Yeah, I 
should remember this,' instead of asking about the relevance of this and that. 
. . . We reuse and relearn things every day here, and I often ask them to try 
the same task in a different way the next day." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lessons Sink In 
</P>
<P>
Not that the students innately pick up on the method behind Schilling's 
madness. "At 16 or 17 years old, a lot of kids don't know where they want to 
be," he said. "It's only a year or two later when so many come back to tell me 
they got a lot out of the class." 
</P>
<P>
Rick Whittington dropped in to say hi last week while Schilling was being 
interviewed. Whittington, 20, now works for American Pest Control. He graduated 
from Morse in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"What you learn in here helps you to go out and get a job if that is what you 
want to do," he said. "And Mr. Schilling helps out all his students and treats 
you the way you want to be treated. I think I worked harder in other courses 
because of him, because I learned that all teachers aren't the same, that 
others too were like Mr. Schilling." 
</P>
<P>
Senior James Ethridge would like to go into hotel management. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Schilling, he really can deal with students in a group or one-on-one," 
Ethridge said. "He has come down on me a couple of times, but he has been fair, 
and I sometimes do get a little wild. Last year, I was in and out of the 
(principal's) office for a lot of petty things, but this course has matured me, 
and teachers have complimented me on my attitude. . . . I am doing better in 
classes now." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Ethridge has become a "pretty good" cook. Last November, he cooked 
all but the Thanksgiving turkey for his family and relatives during their 
holiday get-together. He also said he now can cook up a real meal when he is 
hungry, instead of simply throwing a bag of instant noodles into boiling water. 
</P>
<P>
Some students praise the food-management course but admit they signed up 
primarily because they thought it would be easy, despite the difficulty most 
have encountered in preparing a consistent pancake batter. 
</P>
<P>
"This course is like a break to me compared to other classes," junior Minnie 
Myers said. "I thought it would be fun and I want to learn more about cooking. 
I was a little surprised about all the things we did first semester in learning 
how to put together a resume and going out for a job interview, understanding 
what work requirements are." 
</P>
<P>
Senior Ray Martin isn't sure how the course has helped him with school in 
general, although he concedes it has "added a little bit of discipline." And, 
while he enjoys knowing how to cook more than a potato, he hopes for a career 
in computing after a stint in the military following graduation. 
</P>
<P>
"Dewayne Schilling is amazing at what he can do," said Evelyn Jones, the 
program's assistant director for the past two years, after having worked as a 
security officer on the Morse campus. 
</P>
<P>
"The word is out among students that he is fair; that is why this course has 
been so popular over the years," Jones said. "He treats everyone the same and 
gets the 'good' out of the student that no one else will give a chance. We hear 
from other teachers who ask how we were able to get through to a student. 
</P>
<P>
"Almost no student ever leaves the program. Mr. Schilling won't let them." 
</P>
<P>
Schilling downplays his effect on students, saying simply that he will "touch 
students, hug students, chew out students, force them to deal with problems. . 
. . They're not used to that. . . . We learn how to finish a job we start, how 
to communicate, how to understand someone's cultural background a bit." 
</P>
<P>
"The kids see that I care about what happens to them," Schilling said. He has 
few of what he calls "house rules," but among them are no wearing of gang 
colors and no racial or other put-downs. 
</P>
<P>
Even with all the counseling and personal-growth work that Schilling does with 
his students, he manages to train them to put out decent meals. 
</P>
<P>
So as far as breakfast or lunch goes, just how good is the food? 
</P>
<P>
Math aide Fumi Marquez is one of many faculty who choose the Hungry Tiger each 
day over the regular cafeteria food. 
</P>
<P>
Said a confident Marquez -- who at five months into her pregnancy is eating for 
two -- as she wolfed down a Tigerburger with cheese the other day: "There is no 
competition."

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: LET THE BEST SUDS WIN, NOT (GASP) GO DOWN DRAIN

Beer wars in San Diego? 
</P>
<P>
After several decades of not having a single local brewery-eatery, San Diego 
will soon have two: the Karl Strauss' Old Columbia Brewery &amp; Grill downtown 
and Brewski, which will be part of the Mission Brewery shopping complex in Loma 
Portal. 
</P>
<P>
Old Columbia is set to open Feb. 2 and Brewski won't be ready until October, 
but the competition (none dare call it feuding) has already begun. 
</P>
<P>
Four grim-faced agents from the state Department of Alcohol Beverage Control 
visited Brewski late last week. As quick as you could say "untaxed and 
unlicensed production of alcohol for commercial purposes," they poured all 400 
gallons of Mission Red ESB (Extra Special Bitter) down the drain. 
</P>
<P>
Brewski principal Mike Foote, a developer, is in the process of applying for a 
brewery license. He says he thought he had the go-ahead to make a limited 
amount of beer for beer shows and promotional events. 
</P>
<P>
And what gave the ABC agents the idea to arrive unannounced at Brewski? Could 
it have been an inquiry made earlier in the week by Old Columbia co-owner Chris 
Cramer about whether Brewski's license will carry the same restrictions (no 
dancing, no entertainment) as Old Columbia's? 
</P>
<P>
After the agents departed, Foote had occasion to contact Cramer to ask him 
these and other questions. The two share a passion for the brewing art but are 
otherwise quite dissimilar. 
</P>
<P>
Cramer, 27, is MBA (Stanford). Foote, 42, is NFL (Rams and Redskins). Still, 
the discussion reportedly was amicable. Both sides say they have the same 
motto: Let the best suds prevail. 
</P>
<P>
"I never dreamed that asking a few questions about the Brewski license would 
result in this," Cramer said. 
</P>
<P>
"It sure took the wind out of our sails," Foote said. "We were already to start 
making T-shirts. But we'll be back." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Of Bengals and Opera 
</P>
<P>
The Peking Opera, which gives three performances this week at the San Diego 
Civic Theatre, played earlier in the tour at the Pikes Peak Center in Colorado 
Springs, Colo., not normally a hotbed of ancient Oriental art forms. 
</P>
<P>
The critic for the local Gazette-Telegraph decided to grab his Super 
Bowl-entranced 
</P>
<P>
readers with a homey comparison between Chinese opera and pro football. 
</P>
<P>
"In both art forms, highly trained performers in bizarre, colorful costumes 
appear, often with names taken from the animal kingdom -- Monkeys, Bears, Dogs, 
Bengals, Buffaloes, Snakes. They perform time-honored ritualistic acts filled 
with passion, larceny, wry fatalism, violence and sometimes inexplicable 
motivations. The audience . . . laughs, applauds or weeps." 
</P>
<P>
True, but there's one difference: In Chinese opera, Bengals do not blow a lead 
with 34 seconds remaining. Maybe that's where the wry fatalism comes in. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Miserly Thoughts 
</P>
<P>
The Escondido Times-Advocate has criticized the proposed name of San Diego 
Martin Luther King Convention Center as a "laborious moniker" and said it 
probably won't allow the name in its news columns, even if adopted by the Board 
of Port Commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
Conscientious objection to civic name changes is not new to the Times-Advocate. 
It also abhors San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium, renamed for the late sports 
editor of a rival newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
"To save newsprint, the Times-Advocate refers to the stadium as San Diego 
Stadium," said a recent editorial. "The same dedication to efficiency and 
common sense would probably prevail if the new convention center name 
survives." 
</P>
<P>
A rough calculation: 50 omissions of King's name in stories about the 
convention center, during the course of maybe five years, would save enough ink 
and space for three paragraphs.

SITTING ON A POWDER KEG;

<P>
TIERRASANTA MARKS TIME, WAITS FOR ORDNANCE CLEANUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Near the end of a Tierrasanta street of neat, brown-shingle homes, where girls 
cartwheel across manicured lawns and boys ride brightly colored bikes, an 
ominous sign warns that the hillside below the cul-de-sac has not been swept 
for unexploded ordnance. 
</P>
<P>
Suzanne Gillick-Pew, whose 8-year-old son was killed less than 10 yards from 
where the sign now stands when an abandoned, World War II-era mortar round 
exploded, says the warning is long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 10, 1983, her son Matthew Smith, 8-year-old Corey Peake and Corey's 
12-year-old brother, Carl, discovered an unexploded shell while playing "fort" 
with friends. Matt picked up the round and threw it into the brush. Corey 
retrieved it. Then one of the boys banged it against a rock and it detonated, 
instantly killing Matt and Corey and injuring Carl. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$6.5-Million in Settlements 
</P>
<P>
The families of the two dead boys received a total of $6.3 million last April 
in out-of-court settlements with the city and the developers and builder of the 
2,600-acre community. 
</P>
<P>
Last November, the city finally posted 81 signs in 64 locations warning 
residents that they live atop what during World War II was a Marine Corps 
artillery range. Cruz Gonzalez, director of the city's risk management 
department, said the city paid about $2 million to the two families without 
admitting any liability. The city was not required to post the signs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The city decided in July to erect the signs at a cost of about $7,000, less 
than a week after a crew from ABC-TV's "20/20" went to Tierrasanta to film a 
story on the ordnance problem. For months the city had refused requests by the 
boys' families to post warnings, prompting Superior Court Judge Dennis Adams, 
who presided over the case, to label the city's position as "totally 
outrageous." 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez denied that the posting of the signs had anything to do with the 
airing of the "20/20" segment, saying that the city had merely "bowed" to 
wishes of Tierrasanta residents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'An Added Precaution' 
</P>
<P>
"We just didn't think there was a need, but we got a lot of requests from the 
community," he said. "We decided to put up the signs as an added precaution." 
</P>
<P>
John Madaffer, chairman of the Tierrasanta Community Council, said that "it was 
interesting that it was so coincidentally close," but also said he does not 
believe that the city acted as a result of the television program. 
</P>
<P>
The new signs explain that Tierrasanta was once part of Camp Elliott, a 
13,000-acre Marine Corps base for artillery and tank training. The bottom part 
of the sign reads: "This area has not been swept for unexploded shells. It is 
currently slated to be done." 
</P>
<P>
The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, which will conduct subsurface sweeps with 
electromagnetic equipment to find unexposed shells, said it is uncertain when 
the sweeps will begin. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason for the delay is that federal officials are worried about 
damaging the hillsides and canyons and so must proceed with caution. Corps 
spokesman Ken Crawford said that "it may be spring of 1990" before sweeps 
occur. 
</P>
<P>
Another corps official, Judy Wilson, said the organization is still in the 
process of selecting a contractor to design a cleanup plan. "It looks like we 
will be able to make an award for design in the first part of February," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
After that, a contractor still needs to be selected to do the actual cleanup, 
said Maj. Gene Miller, project manager of a feasibility study of the ordnance 
danger done last April. 
</P>
<P>
What is clear, however, is that no one knows how long the cleanup will take. It 
could take years or it could become a process almost without end, with 
continuous sweeps taking place indefinitely. Wilson said it will be a 
"torturous" process. 
</P>
<P>
The Corps of Engineers estimates there are 263 hazardous items, or "devices 
that are considered dangerous," in the Tierrasanta area. According to the April 
feasibility study, there are more than 66,000 pieces of ordnance-related 
contamination that are not considered hazardous, including shell fragments, 
grenade spoons and shotgun shells. 
</P>
<P>
A long-term concern of many residents is that rainfall and erosion will bring 
more shells to the surface, said Deanna Spehn, editor of the Tierra Times and 
chairwoman of the Community Council's ordnance committee. "We want sweeps every 
year, forever," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Education Stressed 
</P>
<P>
Gillick-Pew agrees, saying she is glad the signs are finally up but that, 
unless more is done to educate other Tierrasanta residents, the neighborhood's 
children remain at risk. She says she has seen children running around on the 
hillside where her son was killed, and she knows the canyons are irresistible 
playgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
"If they don't do more than this, it's going to happen again. And I'd like to 
think my son didn't die in vain," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Robin Smith, Matt's father, says he feels the Tierrasanta canyons will continue 
to pose a threat unless periodic, electronic searches for ordnance are made. 
</P>
<P>
Joanne Peake, Corey's mother, is also pleased that signs have been posted at 
trail heads and entrances to most of the open spaces in the canyon, but says 
she will be much happier when the sweeps start. 
</P>
<P>
"If they had done this years ago, none of this would have ever happened," Peake 
said. "What upsets me is when people keep us in the dark. . . . I think that, 
when there's a little bit of risk, we should be told -- something." 
</P>
<P>
Madaffer of the Community Council says the signs are "only one small part of an 
overall program of education, awareness and safety," and he is trying to find a 
way to require Tierrasanta homeowners to notify renters of the ordnance danger. 
</P>
<P>
People who buy homes in Tierrasanta are told of the danger because state law 
requires that developers and real estate brokers provide full disclosure, 
according to Ron Rinehart, assistant manager at Coldwell Banker in Tierrasanta. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Warning From Realtors 
</P>
<P>
Coldwell Banker clients interested in Tierrasanta are told that "some live, 
unexploded military ordnance has been found and is known to exist in the open 
space and canyon areas of Tierrasanta . . . (and) in 1986 the government 
earmarked money for a comprehensive program to clean up this ordnance, and 
officials are studying how best to accomplish the cleanup," Rinehart said. 
</P>
<P>
Madaffer and others expressed frustration at bureaucratic delays in cleaning up 
the site and stressed that residents continue to be made aware of the ordnance 
danger. 
</P>
<P>
"Five years is too long," said Karl Higgins, aide to Congressman Bill Lowery 
(R-San Diego). Higgins noted that the Corps of Engineers is working on a second 
feasibility study to assess contamination in east Tierrasanta for another 
sweep. Gillick-Pew would like to see an education program for the parents in 
Tierrasanta and a better program in the schools. 
</P>
<P>
Every year, members of the San Diego Fire Department's explosive device team 
visit the 12 schools in the Tierrasanta area and lecture students about the 
dangers of unexploded shells and other ordnance. Department spokeswoman Lonnie 
Kitch said the 1988-89 lecture series is expected to reach a total of 8,300 
students. 
</P>
<P>
The program, which teaches children not to touch any suspicious objects, to 
mark where they find the objects and to call an adult, began in 1984 in 
response to the accident the year before, Kitch said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sufficient Action 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez, the city official, believes that what is being done now -- education 
in the schools, library displays, announcements in the local paper and 
notification to new homeowners -- is sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
But Gillick-Pew said her daughter Kristen, 16, came home from school in tears 
after hearing firefighters who had come to talk to students say that the boys 
who played in the Tierrasanta canyons were "bad boys." Gillick-Pew said she was 
not sure the firefighters knew how to teach children. 
</P>
<P>
Russ Heyneman, explosive-device technician with the Fire Department, said 
members of the Explosive Device Team tailored their presentations to each age 
group and never "condescended" to the students. He said the department is 
considering expanding the lectures to two a year, before Christmas and summer 
vacations. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters have responded to three calls to remove unexploded ordnance since 
November, when the signs were put in place, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Matt's father still lives on the cul-de-sac near where his son was killed. 
Gillick-Pew and Peake have also remained in Tierrasanta. 
</P>
<P>
Smith says he stayed because he feels enough has been done now to warn 
residents and their children of the danger. He says living there now is more of 
a "calculated, reasonable risk," like driving a car. 
</P>
<P>
Gillick-Pew has friends here, and her church is here. 
</P>
<P>
The Peakes suffered another tragedy when Corey's father died a month after the 
accident. The family's lawyers said he had been suffering from cancer and that 
the strain of his son's death was too much. 
</P>
<P>
"They've lost a brother, they've lost a father, they didn't want to be moved," 
Joanne Peake said of her family. "It was a real security for me to be able to 
have a home."

49ERS GET TAYLOR-MADE FINISH; 
</P>

BENGALS DEALT OUT ON SCORE IN LAST MINUTE

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the most dramatic finish in Super Bowl history, Joe Montana hit receiver 
John Taylor on a 10-yard scoring pass with 34 seconds remaining Sunday to give 
the San Francisco 49ers a 20-16 over over the Cincinnati Bengals before a crowd 
of 75,179 at Joe Robbie Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers, who started their last-gasp effort with 3:10 remaining in Super Bowl 
XXIII, drove 92 yards on 11 plays on the go-ahead drive, highlighted by catches 
of 17 and 27 yards by receiver Jerry Rice. 
</P>
<P>
It was the third Super Bowl victory of the decade for San Francisco and the 
fifth consecutive title for the National Football Conference. 
</P>
<P>
A 40-yard field goal by Cincinnati kicker Jim Breech with 3:20 remaining gave 
the Bengals a 16-13 lead, but they couldn't hold it. 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals drove 46 yards in 11 plays on their drive toward that go-ahead 
field goal, after the 49ers missed a 49-yard field goal attempt that would have 
given them the lead with 8:47 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
The key plays on the Bengals' field goal drive were a 17-yard pass from Boomer 
Esiason to Ira Hillary on third and 12 at the Cincinnati 29-yard line, and a 
13-yard pass from Esiason to James Brooks to the 49er 24, setting up Breech's 
kick. 
</P>
<P>
The first quarter was a costly one for both teams. The 49ers lost left tackle 
Steve Wallace with a broken left fibula on the game's third play. Wallace was 
injured when Bengal nose tackle David Grant knocked Montana backward after a 
pass, Montana rolling over onto Wallace's leg. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the quarter, Cincinnati's Pro Bowl nose tackle Tim Krumrie broke both 
the tibia and fibula bones in his left leg after he planted his foot awkwardly 
into the turf while chasing Roger Craig on an 8-yard run. Krumrie remained in 
the locker room after the injury, watching the game on television. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers quickly took advantage of the injury to the Bengals' top defensive 
player, driving 73 yards in 13 plays for the game's first score, a 41-yard 
field goal by Mike Cofer with 3:14 left in the quarter. It came after an 
apparent 22-yard pass completion from Montana to receiver Mike Wilson -- down 
to the Cincinnati 2-yard line -- was ruled incomplete after an instant-replay 
review. San Francisco had to settle for the field goal after two Montana 
incompletions. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers showed no signs of slowing as they headed into the second quarter. On 
the last play of the first quarter, Rice made a great left-handed catch of a 
Montana pass for a 16-yard gain. Rice's hands, and his ankle, seemed fine, 
despite a Super Bowl week's worth of worry. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the drive, Montana read a Bengal blitz by safety David Fulcher and 
found Rice wide open down the right sideline for a 30-yard gain and a first 
down just outside the Cincinnati 10. The 49ers made it as far as the 1 on 
fourth down, called time out, and then decided to send Cofer in for the easy 
19-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
If only it was that easy. Randy Cross' center snap skidded off line to holder 
Barry Helton, who didn't do much with the plant, and Cofer's kick hooked wide 
to the left with 12:59 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers were dominating the game, but not the scoreboard. Later in the 
quarter, Taylor had a 45-yard return after a 63-yard punt, setting his team up 
nicely at the San Francisco 46. 
</P>
<P>
But on third and 21, Craig fumbled after taking a short pass and heading up 
field into the Bengals' secondary. Fulcher's hit forced the fumble, and Jim 
Skow recovered with 9:52 left. The Bengals, again, did nothing with the 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati didn't get moving until late in the half, only after they held the 
49ers in check deep in San Francisco territory. 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals took over after a 49er punt on their own 44 with 4:04 left. They 
managed to drive 28 yards in 6 plays, the key play an 18-yard pass from Esiason 
to Tim McGee, and settled for a 34-yard Breech field goal to tie the game, 3-3, 
with 1:15 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals took the lead for first time in the third quarter, 6-3, on a 
43-yard field goal by Breech. Cincinnati did it the hard way, taking the 
second-half kickoff and driving 61 yards on 13 plays, using 9:21 on the clock. 
Esiason had key passes of 23 and 11 yards to Cris Collinsworth on the drive and 
another of 20 yards to Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
But the drive stalled inside the 49ers' 30. San Francisco Coach Bill Walsh, who 
would not say whether this game was his last as 49er coach, had a tough 
decision to make after the Bengals were called for illegal motion on an 
incomplete pass on third and 10 at the 25. The 49ers could have pushed the 
Bengals back 5 yards and given them another down. Instead, they decided to test 
Breech, who had made only 2 of 6 field goal attempts outside of 40 yards this 
season. Breech's longest field goal was 45 yards, but he made this one with 
ease. 
</P>
<P>
The first big play of the game came with 2:22 left in the third quarter when 
49er linebacker Bill Romanowski intercepted an Esiason pass at the Cincinnati 
23. San Francisco turned it into a 32-yard Cofer field goal to tie the game, 
6-6. 
</P>
<P>
The lead would last just 16 seconds, the time it took Stanford Jennings to 
return the ensuing kickoff 93 yards for a touchdown. Jennings was untouched on 
the play until Terry Greer clipped Jennings' heels at the 3. The score and 
extra point put Cincinnati ahead, 13-6. 
</P>
<P>
It was only the second kickoff return for a touchdown in Super Bowl history. 
The first occurred in 1983, when Miami's Fulton Walker returned a kickoff 98 
yards for a score in a 27-17 loss to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The Jennings play served to shock and inspire the 49ers, who drove with ease up 
the field on their next possession. 
</P>
<P>
On first down at the 15, Montana threw 31 yards to Rice, who had beaten corner 
Lewis Billups. Then it was Montana to Craig for 40 yards down to the 14. After 
an incomplete pass, which could have been intercepted by Billups in the end 
zone, Montana threw perfectly to Rice, who was fading toward the left corner. 
Rice made the catch inside the 5, and hooked the ball over the end-zone marker 
as he went out of bounds. It was a 14-yard touchdown pass play on a drive 
covering 85 yards on 4 plays, and it helped tie the score, 13-13, with 14:03 
left. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers had a great chance to take the lead on their next possession, thanks 
to a spectacular 44-yard reception by Rice to the Bengals' 38. But the drive 
stalled there, and a 49-yard field goal try by Cofer was wide to the right.

<P>
It may have been the most talked-about, fussed-over, reported-on, overexposed 
ankle since Marilyn Monroe stepped on a subway grating. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Jerry Rice's right ankle is a lot like yours -- a bony thing wrapped 
in ligaments that is the most important friend a dangling foot could ever know. 
</P>
<P>
But there the comparisons end. Rice's ankle went out for a pass in practice 
this week and made headlines. He tweaked it on Monday, and the stock market 
almost crashed. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco 49ers worried about the ankle. So did the media. Reports on 
the ankle came in hourly. People spied on it. If the ankle was ready to fall 
off, as some were led to believe, why was it seen dancing with other little 
ankles at a local Miami hot spot one night last week? 
</P>
<P>
Even sore ankles gotta have fun, Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
Well, it turns out the ankle was fine. What a shock. Jerry Rice and all his 
assembled body parts showed up on time at Joe Robbie Stadium on Sunday and led 
the 49ers to a Super Bowl championship. 
</P>
<P>
Rice, who was held out of considerable practice time this week, held out no 
more. He stole Super Bowl XXIII with 11 receptions and 215 yards. He took it 
from the Cincinnati Bengals with one-handed catches, leaping catches, sprawling 
catches, touchdown catches. 
</P>
<P>
On his 14-yard scoring reception in the fourth quarter, a fade pattern toward 
the left corner, Rice made the catch inside the 5 and instinctively stuck the 
nose of the ball over the plane of the goal line as his momentum carried him 
out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never made a catch like that," Rice said afterward. 
</P>
<P>
Rice kind of makes them up as he goes along. This was no Achilles' ankle here. 
This was the game's most valuable player, a guy who set a Super Bowl yardage 
record by slicing his way through a sleek Cincinnati secondary. 
</P>
<P>
Yeah, but did you notice the limp? 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Green, the 49ers' receivers coach, swore afterward that Rice's ankle was 
no better than 90% and would take 2 or 3 months to recover fully. 
</P>
<P>
"He heals fast, he always has," Green said of Rice. 
</P>
<P>
Which is why an ankle can go dancing on Wednesday and stomping on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me he was only going up and back on the dance floor," Green said. "Not 
side to side." 
</P>
<P>
Rice saved the fancy steps for Cincinnati, especially when it counted. His two 
biggest catches of the day were not his most spectacular. They were two 
receptions -- of 17 and 27 yards -- on his team's dramatic last-minute drive to 
Super Bowl glory. One of Rice's greatest qualities remains his craving for the 
ball in pressure situations, a time when others might dive for cover or 
volunteer to block. 
</P>
<P>
"He wants to be in that position," Green said. "Jerry has never been a guy who 
didn't want to be in that position." 
</P>
<P>
Well, Jerry was ankle deep in it on Sunday, never dreaming of the moment he 
might become the greatest Super Bowl receiver since Pittsburgh's Lynn Swann. 
</P>
<P>
"This is something I will remember the rest of my life," Rice said. "Lynn Swann 
was an idol. It really would amaze me how he could fly through the air and make 
those catches. I'll never forget the one versus Dallas. It was the greatest 
catch I've ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
Rice can add a few more to his Best Catch list -- his own -- and perhaps 
explain again this certain lack of speed he possesses. 
</P>
<P>
"It's deceptive speed," Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, a bag of goods Rice has sold the rest of the league. This 
deceptive speed, he says, is the type that lures cornerbacks into thinking they 
can cover him. And they really do think it. This week, Bengal corners Lewis 
Billups and Eric Thomas didn't exactly bend down and pay homage to King Rice. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Rice might have cruelly described the cornerbacks' strategy as 
deceptive coverage. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a lot of respect for Thomas and Billups," he said. "But they did a lot 
of talking about what Jerry Rice couldn't do. In situations like that, I try 
not to get intimidated. I don't talk a game, I just play it." 
</P>
<P>
Billups, who was burned by Rice all afternoon, defended himself afterward. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody had asked me who I thought was better, Eddie (Brown) or Rice," he 
said. "And before the game, I said Eddie. Now and after the game, I still think 
Eddie. Jerry had a great game and Jerry made some great catches." 
</P>
<P>
And Eddie Brown made 4 catches. 
</P>
<P>
What Rice does you don't measure with a stopwatch, Green said. Rice can 
cat-and-mouse a cornerback out of the league. He runs picture-perfect patterns 
and explodes with bursts of speed when the situation calls for it. And the 
whole time you think you have him covered. Deceptive speed. See? 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of defensive backs think they can check me," Rice said. "But as I said 
earlier this week, this is not a track meet. This is a football game." 
</P>
<P>
And this one, in particular, may be etched in football minds forever. 
</P>
<P>
"I've said all along that Jerry Rice is the best wide receiver ever to play 
this game," 49er safety Ronnie Lott said. "Yes, ever. I've never seen a guy 
that has those kinds of tools come to work as hard as he does." 
</P>
<P>
Bengal receiver Cris Collinsworth almost agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"Jerry Rice hasn't been playing long enough to be called the greatest receiver 
ever to play this game," he said. "But maybe by sometime next week he will have 
earned it." 
</P>
<P>
And just wait until that ankle heals next year. Then you'll see the real Rice. 
</P>
<P>
"Rice had a legitimately sprained ankle," retiring center Randy Cross said. "To 
make a comeback like that was amazing." 
</P>
<P>
OK.

49ERS GET TAYLOR-MADE FINISH;

SUPER ENDING SHUFFLES OFF BENGALS, 20-16

<P>
To the 49ers go the '80s. With a drive for the ages, they reeled in a decade, 
which is only fitting, since they started it off the same way. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981 NFC championship game, Joe Montana rallied San Francisco over the 
Dallas Cowboys with a desperate 89-yard drive, ending it with a touchdown pass 
play to Dwight Clark. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the 22nd day of 1989, Montana rallied them over the Cincinnati 
Bengals with an equally improbable 92-yard drive, ending it with 34 seconds 
left on a 10-yard touchdown pass play to the unheralded John Taylor for a 20-16 
victory, their third Super Bowl championship of the '80s, breaking their tie 
with the Raiders and the Washington Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
What do they do for an encore? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe nothing. San Francisco Coach Bill Walsh has been hinting he'll retire and 
break up his magic partnership with Montana, the one that survived so narrowly 
this season after Walsh's early attempts to ease his veteran out in favor of 
Steve Young. 
</P>
<P>
Ask the Bengals, Montana . . . and Jerry Rice . . . won't go quietly. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just like '81 . . . watching them make that drive against the Cowboys," 
said 49ers safety Ronnie Lott. "Don Griffin came up to me and said, 'You got to 
believe we're going to win this one.' 
</P>
<P>
"The same thing happened in 1981. Archie Reese came up to me and said the same 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
It was one of the poorest Super Bowl games . . . and the series' greatest 
finish. It was 3-3 at the half. There were no touchdowns until the game was 
44:26 old, when Cincinnati's Stanford Jennings returned a kickoff 93 yards to 
give the Bengals a 13-6 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Whereupon Montana, who'd been held to 131 yards passing to that point, picked 
up another 81 in a hurry on four completions in five plays, the last a 
10-yarder for the score to the one, the only, Jerry Rice. 
</P>
<P>
Rice had sprained his right ankle in practice Monday . . . and had been spotted 
dancing at a local beach club named Penrod's Wednesday night. He limped off 
once in this game to get the ankle retaped, but he was in at the end -- 11 
catches and 215 yards worth. 
</P>
<P>
Could these guys suck it up or what? Lott, the free safety whose hits on 
230-pound Ickey Woods shook the stands, stuck it out through a late Bengal 
drive, remaining in the game, doubled over between plays, shaking off backup 
Tom Holmoe, who came out onto the field, took him by the arm and tried to ferry 
him to the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
Were these guys tested, or what? 
</P>
<P>
After the AFC absorbed successive wipeouts at the hands of the Redskins, 
Giants, Bears and 49ers, by the Broncos, Broncos, Patriots and Dolphins, 
respectively, an AFC team finally came to play. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Bengals, who broke the 13-13 tie late in the fourth period, marching 
46 yards to the San Francisco 22 . . . as Boomer Esiason picked up a third and 
13 with a 17-yard completion to Ira Hillary in front of Talkin' Tim McKyer . . 
. and Woods ran for 22 yards in 5 carries . . . and Jim Breech kicked his third 
field goal, a 40-yarder that gave the Bengals a 16-13 lead, with a mere 3:20 
between them and the upset of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
And then, before Montana could try to rally anyone, a 49er bomb squadder was 
flagged for holding on the kickoff and the Niners were penalized back to their 
8-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
Onto the field ran the offense, 92 yards away from paydirt with America peering 
over its shoulders like 200 million buzzards getting ready to cackle. 
</P>
<P>
How does that feel? 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's sobering," 49er center Randy Cross said. 
</P>
<P>
"It gets your attention." 
</P>
<P>
By all accounts, the 49ers' huddle was quiet and businesslike, with one or two 
people like Cross saying peppy things like, "We got to believe," and Montana, 
quiet as usual. 
</P>
<P>
And here's how it went: 
</P>
<P>
First and 10 at the 8 -- Montana throws over the middle to Roger Craig for 8 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
Second and 2 -- Montana hits John Frank for 7 as the clock keeps running. 
</P>
<P>
First and 10 at the 23 -- Montana hits Rice, who has being given plenty of room 
by Bengal left corner Lewis Billups. Rice steps out at the 30 for a 7-yard 
gain. 
</P>
<P>
Second and 3 -- The Niners try to catch the Bengals by surprise with Craig 
carrying up the middle on a draw play. The Bengals aren't surprised; they stop 
Craig for a 1-yard gain and the clock runs down to the 2-minute warning. 
</P>
<P>
Third and 2 -- Craig rips off right tackle for 4 yards and a first down. 
Cincinnati defensive end Jim Skow is hurt and the 49ers can have a free timeout 
if they see it, but they don't and call their first timeout. 
</P>
<P>
First and 10 at the 35 -- Montana hits Rice for 17 yards on a sideline pattern. 
Rice beats right corner Eric Thomas and steps out of bounds at the Cincinnati 
48, with 1:34 left. Montana says later he was delighted to find Rice being 
covered man-to-man. 
</P>
<P>
First and 10 at the Bengal 48 -- Montana hits Craig over the middle for 13. The 
clock keeps running. 
</P>
<P>
First and 10 at the Bengal 35 -- Montana overthrows Rice, running another 
sideline pattern against man-to-man coverage by Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
"I overthrew him," Montana said later. "I was sitting there screaming as loud 
as I could (at himself) and I hyperventilated. I got dizzy. I almost called 
time out, but it faded away." 
</P>
<P>
Second and 10 -- Cross is penalized for being downfield. The 49ers are set back 
to the Cincinnati 45, with 1:00 left. 
</P>
<P>
Cross, the 3-time Pro Bowl choice playing in his final game, is having a grisly 
end to a fine career. Besides this penalty, he also has a bad snap, leading to 
a botched chip-shot field goal, and a holding penalty. 
</P>
<P>
"With the plays I had in this game," Cross says later, "I owe a lot to Joe 
Montana. 
</P>
<P>
"The bad snap? I could tell you it was low biorhythms . . . or the curvature of 
the earth . . . or the ball was in a divot . . . or the mood wasn't right. The 
bottom line, it was bad concentration. Hence, a bad snap. 
</P>
<P>
"A bad snap, a holding penalty, an ineligible downfield. I mean, you'll be 
amazed at what kind of game I'll have had 10 years from now when I look back at 
this one." 
</P>
<P>
Suffice to say, the last penalty didn't seem as funny at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Second and 20 -- Montana hits Rice, who tears away from Bengal safety Ray 
Horton and runs for another 15 yards, making it a 27-yard gain and a first down 
at the 18. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone says this was the play of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone is right. 
</P>
<P>
"It was bump-and-run at first," Rice says. "I got away from his (Billups') 
bump. That was really something I thought I wouldn't be able to do earlier this 
week." 
</P>
<P>
Says Bengal safety Ray Horton: "I thought that was the biggest play of the 
game. We were in a perfect coverage for it and I just didn't break on it. I 
should still be running with the ball. I was the one who hit him originally and 
missed the ball. But it should have been an interception on our part -- on my 
part. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's the best at the ball, if you know what I mean. Some people let 
the ball play them. He plays the ball. When the ball's up, he goes and gets it, 
where other players just run out and let the ball come to them." 
</P>
<P>
First and 10 at the 18 -- Montana passes over the middle to Craig, under a zone 
coverage, who runs it 8 yards to the 10. The 49ers take their second timeout 
with 39 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
"A fairly conservative-type throw because now we're in field goal range," 49er 
quarterback coach Mike Holmgren said. 
</P>
<P>
Were they going for the field goal? 
</P>
<P>
Not as far as some of them were concerned. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as we crossed their 30," says Cross, "we were going for their throat." 
</P>
<P>
Second and 2 at the 10 -- The Bengals are playing zone, as the Niners expect 
them to, and Montana zips a 10-yard touchdown pass to Taylor, his first 
reception of the night. 
</P>
<P>
Ballgame. 
</P>
<P>
"Taylor was lined up at the tight end," Horton says. "It didn't pose a problem, 
until Rice came in motion to that side. When he came, I had to widen out a 
little bit, widen my area of responsibility. It gave Taylor more room to 
operate. He shot right inside. Before I could react, the ball was in there." 
</P>
<P>
What is there to say, but hail to the 49ers? 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, what could you say?" said Bengal safety David Fulcher. "They beat us. 
They did what they had to do to beat us, but it wasn't easy. I guarantee you, 
it wasn't easy. 
</P>
<P>
"We played with 'em. It wasn't like it was easy. They were the guys who were 
supposed to win easy, from the time we got here. San Francisco was supposed to 
walk away." 
</P>
<P>
So the 49ers limped away, instead with crazed smiles on their faces and a song 
in their hearts. 
</P>
<P>
In the 49ers' dressing room, they did a parody of the Bengals "Who dey?" cheer. 
Talkin' Tim McKyer, who had sneered publicly at the Bengal receivers, and been 
beaten by them for about five completions, announced that the 49er defensive 
backs had "just owned 'em, that's all. Just owned 'em." 
</P>
<P>
Tim has a big future in the entertainment business. 
</P>
<P>
Thus did the sorcerer, go Walsh, best his old apprentice, Sam Wyche. 
</P>
<P>
It was a fair contest. The sorcerer had a magician named Montana on his side 
and the '80s disappeared up their sleeve. Hail to the 49ers, indeed.

Randy Cross' name won't pop to mind when the 1989 Super Bowl is recalled years 
from now, and that's just fine with Randy Cross. 
</P>
<P>
"I made some mistakes today," the San Francisco 49ers' 13-year-old center said 
after the 20-16 victory over Cincinnati on Sunday. "But I went from goat to 
glory, so I'll be nothing but a little footnote to this game." 
</P>
<P>
Cross, who announced this week that this Super Bowl, his third, would mark the 
end of his playing career, made three mistakes that almost helped swing the 
decision to the Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
Two minutes into the second quarter, his snap was to the right of holder Barry 
Helton and foiled a 19-yard field goal try by Mike Cofer that would given the 
49ers a 6-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Two San Francisco possessions later, on a first down play from the 49ers' 21, 
Cross was called for a 10-yard holding penalty that put the team in a hole. The 
49ers were forced to punt from their 12-yard line, and 6 plays later the 
Bengals tied the game, 3-3, on a 34-yard field goal by Jim Breech. 
</P>
<P>
With 1:22 left in the game, his 10-yard penalty for being an ineligible 
receiver forced the 49ers into a third-and-20 situation at the Cincinnati 45. A 
27-yard pass play from Joe Montana to Jerry Rice and Montana's 10-yard 
touchdown pass to John Taylor bailed out Cross. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going out literally on top, No. 1, and getting to go on and lead my life," 
Cross said. "I can't thank those other 46 guys enough." 
</P>
<P>
Cross said he never got down on himself, even after several plays went against 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very much an optimist, so I was walking up and down the sideline grabbing 
anybody I could and telling them, 'You've got to believe we're going to do it,' 
" he said. "You've got to believe it.' " 
</P>
<P>
He was effusive in his praise of Montana, who at age 32 becomes the oldest 
49er. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nobody in history that you'd want to have as quarterback in a drive 
like that other than Joe Montana," Cross said. "Those who might've thought he 
had a peer might have to reconsider now. He's the biggest winner I've ever been 
associated with." 
</P>
<P>
It was the confidence exuded by Montana, Cross and some other veterans that 
several players cited as critical during the winning rally. 
</P>
<P>
"From the very first 10-yard penalty, I made a comment to (guard) Guy McIntyre, 
'Why not do it the hard way?' " Cross said. "By those last 3 or 4 plays, we 
were just positive we were going to find a way to get in the end zone."

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the morning of a Super Bowl game, the stadium is easy to find. Just look for 
the circus tents. The area around the stadium always looks like the world's 
biggest circus. 
</P>
<P>
As it did again Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
For much of the day at Joe Robbie Stadium, much of corporate America was holed 
up in the tents, the largest of which could have passed for the big top in the 
heyday of Ringling Bros. 
</P>
<P>
The idea, of course, is to entertain the advertisers and others of the VIP 
class, who don't just want to sit in their cars eating doughnuts until the 
gates open. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Robbie Stadium is the newest in pro football. Known in the Miami area as 
JRS, it was built a year ago by Miami Dolphins owner Joe Robbie after a lengthy 
argument with the operators of the Orange Bowl, where the Dolphins played for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Robbie wanted to modernize a half century-old stadium. Turned down, he built 
JRS on a site halfway to Ft. Lauderdale, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
It's the league's only privately built and owned stadium. In the beginning, the 
proprietor had planned to call it Dolphin Stadium. His children renamed it. 
</P>
<P>
Robbie, a former Minneapolis lawyer, started in Miami on a shoestring in 1960. 
First he borrowed heavily to fund the Dolphins, a 1960s expansion team. Then he 
mortgaged the Dolphins for $115 million to fund JRS. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, he and his family will own the team and stadium outright. 
</P>
<P>
"My only partners now are the bankers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The JRS playing field is laid in Prescription Athletic Turf, called PAT, the 
most rain-resistant of the natural turfs but not as satisfactory as AstroTurf 
in a storm such as the one that struck Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Even AstroTurf cannot handle a big rain. But it is better than PAT, which is an 
improvement over typical grass fields. 
</P>
<P>
The Dolphins' surface is similar to Notre Dame's in South Bend, Ind. PAT also 
is used at Augusta, Ga., where the Masters golf tournament is played. 
</P>
<P>
PAT fields are irrigated from below with a network of pipes, which also are 
used to remove excess rain. 
</P>
<P>
This was the sixth Super Bowl in Miami but the first at the new stadium. The 
others were played at the Orange Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Robbie said his next goal is to have a World Series at his stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball is being played at the stadium now with a left-field 30-foot screen 
that resembles the 40-foot Chinese wall at the Coliseum, L.A. site of the 1959 
World Series. 
</P>
<P>
For $2 million, Robbie said, JRS can be converted into a real baseball park. 
</P>
<P>
He will settle for a baseball franchise in either the National or American 
League, so long as the club plays in his stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Before the game, 49er quarterback Joe Montana said he had enjoyed the week at 
Miami more than the weeks before his first two Super Bowls at Pontiac, Mich., 
and Stanford, where he was the most valuable player of both Super Bowl XVI and 
XIX. 
</P>
<P>
"The hardest was the second one (at Stanford)," Montana said. "All I remember 
all week was trying to get people tickets." 
</P>
<P>
Joe Theismann, the Washington Redskins quarterback in two Super Bowls, said he 
thinks the players are better rested for game day than they were in his day. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember the media hype lasting all week, through Saturday," said Theismann, 
who is now an ESPN commentator. 
</P>
<P>
"In recent years, they've protected the players a lot better. The teams are off 
by themselves all day Saturday, and most of the day Friday. That's the way it 
should be." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Stupak, Las Vegas high roller casino owner, won a $1 million bet, possibly 
the largest single wager in the history of Nevada bookmaking, when the 49ers 
won by only a 4-point margin. 
</P>
<P>
Stupak placed the bet at Little Caesars Gambling Casino on the Las Vegas Strip 
at mid-morning several hours before kickoff. Little Caesars gave minus 7 points 
on the 49ers and plus 7 points on the Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
Stupak would have lost if the San Francisco 49ers had won by 8 points or more. 
</P>
<P>
Little Caesars owner Gene Maday said Stupak walked into the establishment 
carrying two suitcases filled with cash. Stupak bet $1,050,000 in order to win 
$1 million on the Bengals, which means he gets back his original wager plus the 
$1 million victory. 
</P>
<P>
A 63-yard punt by Cincinnati's Lee Johnson in the second quarter was a Super 
Bowl record. The ball sailed over return man John Taylor's head at the San 
Francisco 25 and rolled to the 9 where Taylor picked it up and ran it back 45 
yards to the Cincinnati 46, giving him the longest punt return in Super Bowl 
history.

RICE SHOWS HIS ANKLE IS OK; SO ARE HIS HANDS

Was Jerry Rice's gimpy exit from practice at the start of Super Bowl week a 
ploy to sucker the Cincinnati Bengals? 
</P>
<P>
If so, it worked. If not, Rice made one heck of a recovery. 
</P>
<P>
He opened Sunday's Super Bowl with a reverse run, then made some spectacular 
catches in the San Francisco 49ers' 20-16 victory Sunday over the Cincinnati 
Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
Rice, named most valuable player of the game, caught a 14-yard touchdown pass 
from Joe Montana early in the fourth quarter and set up John Taylor's winning 
touchdown with 34 seconds left by making 3 catches for 42 yards on the drive. 
</P>
<P>
Rice, who had 5 touchdowns in the 49ers' two previous playoff games this year, 
finished with a Super Bowl-record 11 catches for 215 yards. Dan Ross of the 
Bengals held the record of 10 receptions set in the 1982 game. 
</P>
<P>
"Today is a day I will never forget," Rice said as he held is 18-month-old 
daughter, Jaqui, in the 49ers' locker room. "It was just stupendous." 
</P>
<P>
Bengals' Coach Sam Wyche said Rice had "a world championship performance." 
</P>
<P>
The week began with Rice's mysterious departure from practice on Monday. He 
caught a pass from Montana but left the field, complaining of a twinge of pain 
in his ankle. Rice was bothered by a sprained ankle suffered in October, and 
didn't feel fully healthy until mid-December. The injury on Monday, however, 
did nothing to slow him down. 
</P>
<P>
Montana said he saw nothing wrong with Rice and said the wide receiver would 
play Sunday even if he had to drag him out on the field. 
</P>
<P>
Rice didn't have to be dragged. He said his ankle problem was a bit of 
tendinitis that didn't give him any problem. 
</P>
<P>
As if to prove the point, Coach Bill Walsh called for a reverse to Rice on the 
first play, and Rice ran it for 5 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Rice didn't run with the ball again, but he soared on pass plays. By the end of 
the first half, he 3 three catches for 58 yards. 
</P>
<P>
It was in the second half, though, that Rice really took off. 
</P>
<P>
With the 49ers trailing, 13-6, Rice caught a 31-yard pass from the San 
Francisco 15 to start an 85-yard touchdown march. Roger Craig caught a 40-yard 
pass and, 1 play later, Rice caught a 14-yard pass near the sideline, and dove 
over for the score. 
</P>
<P>
Rice started the 49ers' next drive with a 44-yard pass play, catching the ball 
with a magnificent leap over cornerback Lewis Billups. 
</P>
<P>
On the winning drive, Rice contributed catches of 8, 17 and 27 yards before 
John Taylor's 10-yard touchdown catch with 34 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew the receivers had to make some plays," Rice said. "Whenever Joe put the 
ball up in the air, we just tried to go up and fight for it. Joe put the ball 
in the right spot and made it easy for me. I really give Joe the MVP." 
</P>
<P>
Rice said Cincinnati "talked all week, but I guess we were the better team 
today." 
</P>
<P>
Walsh credited Rice for taking advantage of the Bengals' man-to-man defense. 
</P>
<P>
"They could not stay with him man to man," Walsh said.

IT'S ALMOST GAME OF LOST OPPORTUNITY FOR 49ERS

San Francisco's greatest Super Bowl triumph nearly disintegrated in a flurry of 
mistakes and missed opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
The heroics of Joe Montana, Jerry Rice, John Taylor and the combined efforts of 
the defense produced a come-from-behind, 20-16 victory over the Cincinnati 
Bengals Sunday and saved such players as Roger Craig, Randy Cross and Taylor 
from spending a long off-season pondering their errors. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the 49ers' fourth game-winning rally in the fourth quarter this 
season, San Francisco will likely be called the team of the 1980's. 
</P>
<P>
"It's got to be one of our best wins ever," said Montana, who completed 23 of 
36 passes for 357 yards. "To be down by a field goal and come back and win it 
like we did . . . it's got to rank up there, believe me." 
</P>
<P>
Montana's 10-yard touchdown pass into the outstretched arms of Taylor in the 
end zone with 34 seconds remaining brought back memories of what had been known 
as "The Catch" but which might now be renamed "The Other Catch." The Catch was 
made by Dwight Clark, who leaped in the end zone to grab a high Montana pass to 
beat Dallas in the NFC championship game 7 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Montana said he would have a difficult time choosing between the two. 
</P>
<P>
"We were in a tough position, but we never gave up," Montana said of the 
92-yard drive at game's end. "We had a lot of time on the clock. We felt we 
could move the ball in that situation. We had to be confident because we had 
done it in the past." 
</P>
<P>
Craig, who wasn't on the 49ers' team that beat Cincinnati, 26-21, in the 1982 
Super Bowl, scored a touchdown in San Francisco's victory over Miami in the 
1985 game. On Sunday, Craig ran for 74 yards and made critical receptions of 13 
and 8 yards during the final drive. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the greatest drive in the history of the Super Bowl," Craig said. 
"It's got to be." 
</P>
<P>
In the second quarter, Craig had fumbled, the 49ers' only turnover of the game, 
to kill a drive into Cincinnati territory. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to make up for that fumble," Craig said. "Right before that, the other 
players were telling me to keep two hands on the ball, but I didn't." 
</P>
<P>
Craig said the 49ers' experience in championship situations made the difference 
down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
"We kept talking to ourselves throughout the game and saying not to get down on 
ourselves," he said. "And Joe Montana and Randy Cross kept providing leadership 
in the huddle."

BAD BREAKS EVENED OUT FOR BENGALS AND 49ERS 
</P>

Never has a Super Bowl caused so much physical pain so early. In the first 7 
minutes of Super Bowl XXIII Sunday night, two players who have made major 
contributions all season went down with broken legs. 
</P>
<P>
The second injury was one of the most graphic and severe in Super Bowl history. 
It happened to Tim Krumrie, the Cincinnati Bengals' Pro Bowl nose tackle, when 
he stepped awkwardly while tackling San Francisco 49ers running back Roger 
Craig. The damage: a broken left tibia and fibula -- the two major bones below 
the knee. 
</P>
<P>
On the third play of the game's first series, San Francisco tackle Steve 
Wallace suffered a broken left fibula. After Joe Montana was hit as he threw a 
10-yard completion to Craig, Montana crashed into Wallace's left leg. Wallace's 
leg was bent at an awkward angle, causing his left fibula to snap. 
</P>
<P>
With 8:06 left in the first quarter, Krumrie's season ended. On first-and-10 
from the 49ers' 3, Craig broke through the middle of the line and was chased by 
Krumrie. He got a grip on Craig, and as he tried to tackle him, Krumrie's left 
ankle collapsed. As replays showed graphically, Krumrie went airborne to 
complete the tackle, and as he did, his leg below the knee flopped grotesquely. 
It obviously was broken. 
</P>
<P>
As the injury happened, Bengals Coach Sam Wyche seemed to sense the severity of 
it. He shook his head, then stared glumly at the ground. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL said Krumrie chose to remain in the locker room and watch the game on 
television. He remained there into the second half before doctors advised him 
to go to a hospital. Wallace remained at the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Replacing Wallace was Bubba Paris, the veteran 310-pounder. In the Bengals' 
basic 3-4 defense, rookie David Grant took Krumrie's place; in the four-man 
line, Grant and Skip McClendon were the tackles. 
</P>
<P>
Bengals defensive coordinator Dick LeBeau said, "It was obviously a big loss, 
losing Timmy the way we did. But you've got to hand it to Grant. I thought he 
played an incredible ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
There was history staring Cincinnati Bengals kicker Jim Breech in the face, but 
it was such a familiar position to be in. He'd been in the same position all 
week. 
</P>
<P>
The situation, in Sunday's Super Bowl XXIII against the San Francisco 49ers: 
score tied, 13-13, with 4:25 left in the game, and a field-goal attempt of 40 
yards lined up slightly left of the center of the field. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked being in the position right then, because I probably kicked that exact 
same kick 10 or 15 times this week in practice," said Breech, downcast after 
the 49ers won, 20-16. 
</P>
<P>
"There was some wind, more wind than I'd faced during the week. But I felt 
good. The hold was good and the snap was good. When I kicked it, I didn't kick 
it very well; it didn't hit the net or anything. But it was enough." 
</P>
<P>
Enough then. But not enough for a victory. 
</P>
<P>
"To be that close hurts so much," Breech said, speaking softly. "I didn't care 
how we won. I didn't care if I kicked five extra points or three field goals. I 
just wanted to win so bad." 
</P>
<P>
Breech did his part. He kicked field goals of 34, 43 and 40 yards -- the only 
points the Bengals' offense scored -- but got no support from the other 
components of the Cincinnati offense. "And look at how great the 49ers are in 
the 2-minute offense," Breech said. "I didn't think it was over when I made my 
kick."

BENGALS, WOODS SHUFFLE OUT OF THE BIG DANCE

Ickey Woods didn't shuffle and Boomer Esiason went bust, but the Cincinnati 
Bengals still thought they had Super Bowl rings on their fingers with 3 minutes 
left on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
But San Francisco quarterback Joe Montana and wide receiver Jerry Rice -- who 
thrive on big moments -- gave the Bengals a lesson in greatness under pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Montana led the 49ers on a 92-yard touchdown drive, hitting John Taylor with 
the winning score with just 34 seconds remaining for a 20-16 victory over the 
Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
Just minutes before, Jim Breech's third field goal of the game left Boomer 
Esiason and the sputtering Bengals offense, best in the AFC during the season, 
feeling good about its chances. 
</P>
<P>
"After Jim kicked that last field goal, I figured with the way our defense had 
been playing, it was going to be a sweet ride home," Esiason said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Montana gave the Bengals' offense a lesson in true grit, leading the 
49ers to victory. As Esiason watched from the sideline, he thought back to John 
Elway's 98-yard touchdown drive 2 years ago that helped Denver beat Cleveland 
in the AFC championship and gain a Super Bowl berth. 
</P>
<P>
"You might as well forget the great Denver drive that got them into the Super 
Bowl," Esiason said. "Now, it's the great San Francisco drive that won the 
Super Bowl. That indicates how great Joe Montana is." 
</P>
<P>
The game was billed as a matchup of two explosive offenses, with Cincinnati 
having an advantage because of its bruising running game, which led the NFL 
with a 169-yard average in the regular season. But San Francisco shut down the 
running attack, holding rookie Ickey Woods to 79 yards and no touchdown 
shuffles. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers also limited Esiason, top-rated passer in the NFL, to 11 of 25 
passing for 144 yards with one interception. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt really good throwing the ball. Sometimes things don't go right. What 
can you do?" a befuddled Esiason said. 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals' offense roared only once in the game, marching to a field goal and 
their first lead of the game after taking the second-half kickoff. But the 
Bengals never put another solid drive together again, having to settle for 
Stanford Jennings' 93-yard kickoff return for their only touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"The first drive of the second half, that was the Cincinnati Bengals' offense," 
Esiason said. "Unfortunately, we were only able to do that once or twice." 
</P>
<P>
Bengals coach Sam Wyche said Esiason did a good job running the offense, but 
the Bengals merely were outplayed. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how to describe his performance to you," Wyche said. "The numbers 
may not be what Boomer can do statistically." 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals' offensive failures finally came back to haunt them as San 
Francisco cashed in on its final opportunity for the winning touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a classic game for the Super Bowl, and a classic game for a player 
like Joe (Montana), whose career has revolved around those kinds of finishes," 
Wyche said.

John McEnroe, in his first appearance in the Australian Open since 1985, says 
he has made a conscious effort to relate to the fans here at the National 
Tennis Center. 
</P>
<P>
And he has become a crowd favorite, the fans seeming to appreciate his tennis 
ability for all its artistry. 
</P>
<P>
Has he made a conscious effort with the lines judges, too? 
</P>
<P>
It might not have looked that way last Friday when he was fined $500 for verbal 
abuse of a linesman, but McEnroe is trying to take a more mellow approach. 
</P>
<P>
And Mark Woodforde of Australia, who in this tournament is McEnroe's doubles 
partner for this first time, says he has seen a change. 
</P>
<P>
"After I beat him at the U.S. Open (last year), he came up to me and shook 
hands and said, 'Good match, Mark. You played really well and I hope you do 
well in the tournament.' 
</P>
<P>
"No one ever does that. I think that's an indication that he's trying to change 
and I think he's achieving it." 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe, seeded seventh here, says he thinks he has made "a transition from a 
real kid to a man." 
</P>
<P>
"Just seeing what I've done in the past, I realize it's not what I want to be 
doing when I'm 30," he said. "I've changed quite a bit in the last 2 years for 
the better." 
</P>
<P>
But with his 30th birthday less than 5 weeks away, McEnroe says his game has 
not taken a turn for the better as quickly as he would like. He says he has not 
found the inner drive he once possessed, and is not sure if it will ever come 
back. 
</P>
<P>
"I now wonder how I was that intense for that long of time; that I was able to 
get up for so many matches," he said after beating Patrick Kuhnen of West 
Germany, 6-2, 7-5, 6-2, in the third round here. "In retrospect, I actually 
felt like I had come back too soon. I would probably have liked to take more 
time off to get the juices flowing more." 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe said the pressure from family, friends and sponsors played a part in 
his decision to return to the game. 
</P>
<P>
The break was necessary to evaluate his life and take responsibility for his 
world outside a tennis court. 
</P>
<P>
"The 8 or 9 years on the circuit had gone so fast," said McEnroe, whose wife 
Tatum O'Neal and two sons chose to stay at home in Malibu rather than making 
the trip to Australia. "I had accomplished a lot in tennis and received a lot 
of rewards for it, but I was looking at life negatively. I needed to take a 
step back and decide where I wanted to go, especially as a human being." 
</P>
<P>
Today, McEnroe says he has a desire to win, but doesn't let the desire run his 
life. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great challenge to try to get to the top again, but I'm not going to 
try to worry about being No. 1. In some ways, I'm not sure if I want to be No. 
1 again because I don't want to be on top again the way it was in the past. I 
wasn't enjoying myself the way I would have liked." 
</P>
<P>
Players such as Woodforde welcome the new McEnroe as a friend. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a strange feeling last week driving to play golf in my new car, in my 
hometown, with John sitting in the passenger seat. I had to pinch myself to 
believe it was all happening," Woodforde said. "I can't believe tennis has 
given me the opportunity to be friends with a guy I've always admired." 
</P>
<P>
For McEnroe, the trick is getting more than Woodforde to notice the change.

REDONDO BEACH SUPER BOWL 10K; 
</P>
<P>
MEXICO'S CRUZ SHOWS OFF TALENT IN FINISHING FIRST AMONG 14,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a run in the sun for most everybody else, but for winner Alejandro Cruz 
of Mexico, Sunday's Redondo Beach Super Bowl 10K was another race to showcase 
his developing skills. 
</P>
<P>
Cruz, unknown internationally until he won last fall's Chicago Marathon in 2 
hours 8 minutes 57 seconds, ran a canny race Sunday in sunny and cool 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Cruz led almost from the start, running just ahead of Steve Cram of England, 
the world-record holder in the mile, and Thom Hunt of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt and Cruz left the pack at about 3 miles and left Cram to battle Matt 
Ebiner of West Covina for third place. 
</P>
<P>
In the hilly second half of the course, Cruz, 20, wore down Hunt with a series 
of surges. In the last mile, Cruz attacked the final hill and pulled away from 
Hunt for good. 
</P>
<P>
Cruz, seventh in the 1988 Los Angeles Marathon, is a university student in 
Mexico City who trains at Boulder, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
Cruz' winning time was 29:20, Hunt was second in 29:23, Ebiner was third in 
29:42 and Cram, who almost lost a shoe early in the race, was fourth in 29:51. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to stop and tie my laces at 2 miles," Cram said. "That was it. End of 
race. You can't catch up against these guys. It's a basic error. That's the 
first thing you learn. It's the first time in my career this has happened. But 
I had fun. I like these kind of races." 
</P>
<P>
It was nothing more than a training run for Cram, and something of an exercise 
in anonymity. The three-time Olympian went largely unrecognized at the race, 
which was the 11th annual bash for 14,000 entrants. 
</P>
<P>
Sylvia Mosqueda of East L.A. was the women's winner in 32:48. 
</P>
<P>
The real stars of this race, though, are the wacky runners who run dressed in 
all manner of garb. There was the predictable: Young men wearing football 
uniforms, complete with helmets and pads. The football players carried -- and 
passed -- a football the entire 6.2 miles. 
</P>
<P>
There were the odd: Five men inside a cardboard bus (mounted on their 
shoulders), wearing wigs and singing the theme song to TV's "Partridge Family." 
Singing badly. 
</P>
<P>
There were the irreverent: At least two groups lampooning Florence Griffith 
Joyner, the fashionable winner of three gold medals at the Seoul Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
A group of women in the 6-pack division wore long black wigs, taped-on 
4-inch-long fingernails, false eyelashes and, of course, Joyner's trademark 
one-legger -- in this incarnation, the women wore a flesh-colored tight on one 
leg and a lacy white tight on the other. 
</P>
<P>
There was also Slo-Jo. A middle-aged woman wearing a flannel shirt with one 
sleeve cut off. She ran wearing a sign that read, "No speed. No fingernails. No 
chance."

SKIING ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
AUSTRIAN BEATS TOMBA AS GIRARDELLI CONTINUES TO STACK UP THE POINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rudolf Nierlich of Austria edged Italian star Alberto Tomba in winning a World 
Cup slalom race for the first time Sunday at Wengen, Switzerland, and 
Luxembourg's Marc Girardelli virtually clinched his third overall title. 
</P>
<P>
Nierlich was timed in 1 minute 35.90 seconds for two runs down the tricky, 
steep washboard slope, in beating Tomba by .02. Another Austrian, Hubert 
Strolz, was third, in 1:37.60. 
</P>
<P>
The Austrian-born Girardelli, who broke course records in winning downhills 
Friday and Saturday, was fourth in 1:37.75 with a brilliant second-heat 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth place, together with Saturday's downhill victory, gave Girardelli 
the combined title based on the results in both. 
</P>
<P>
"Today's second heat was the most difficult I have ever skied in my 10-year 
career," Girardelli said of the run over hard-packed snow brought from nearby 
glaciers in 400 helicopter flights because of warm temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
"You see the World Cup champion of the 1988-89 season," a Swiss television 
announcer said during Girardelli's second run. Girardelli, who has 306 points, 
more than he needed to win in 1985 and 1986, wasn't ready to claim the title. 
</P>
<P>
He was dethroned in 1987 by Pirmin Zurbriggen of Switzerland, the defending 
champion who finished out of the point standings in the slalom but placed 
second in the combined. Zurbriggen is second with 231 points and Tomba is far 
back in third place with 133 points. 
</P>
<P>
Bernhard Knauss of Austria won for the second straight day on the U.S. Pro Ski 
Tour by taking the slalom title on Mt. Bachelor in Bend, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
Knauss defeated Werner Herzog, also of Austria, in the finals, with Joakim 
Wallner of Switzerland beating Tomaz Cerkovnik of Yugoslavia to take third 
place. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't compare World Cup racing to this, but I do feel confident in the 
slalom right now," said Knauss, who has won 3 of his 5 pro races since leaving 
the World Cup circuit earlier this season. "I really like it. I'm glad I'm 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Phil Mahre, who finished second to Knauss in the giant slalom on Saturday, was 
beaten again by the Austrian, in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
Niklas Lindqvist and Jorgen Sundqvist, both of Sweden, are tied atop the season 
standings with 200 points, while Mahre is third at 195. Herzog, who finished 
fourth on Saturday, is fourth in the standings with 155 points. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Mahre, Phil's brother, fell on his second run and was eliminated in the 
preliminary rounds. He remained ninth in the overall standings with 110 points.

SUN SHINES IN A TOUGH WORLD; 
</P>
<P>
HARD-DRIVING FOUNDER MAKES SURE COMPUTER CHAIN THRIVES ON ITS OWN AMID A 
SHAKEOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
David Sun was 5 years old when his mother decided to move her two sons and two 
daughters to Sichuan province in China from Shanghai while they waited for 
government approval to join their father in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
David had to help farm the family's small plot of land eight miles away from 
their home. "I had a little plow and walked with my uncles and mother. It took 
a long time," he recalled. He was also in charge of the family's ducks. "I took 
the ducks out in a basket to the pond. I had to learn to get them back in the 
basket. I threw rocks to scare them, except one time I hit one. He sort of 
limped for a while. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a tough life. We didn't have enough to eat every day." When David was 
6, the family moved to Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the 32-year-old Sun owns a Jaguar, a Mercedes, a hilltop home in Palos 
Verdes -- fruits of his labor as the founder, president and chief executive of 
Sun Computers. He is one of the longest-term Apple computer dealers, having 
built a 13-store regional chain that has prospered despite an industry 
shakeout. 
</P>
<P>
He has turned down buyout and franchise offers, doggedly determined to stay 
independent and private. The boyish-looking Sun is taking Sun Computers 
(unrelated to Sun Microsystems) overseas into Hong Kong and plans a major West 
Coast expansion of stores beyond Southern California and Seattle. He hopes to 
have sales in the $100-million range in two to three years, more than double 
the expected $40 million in fiscal 1989. Sun's sales totaled $29 million the 
previous year. 
</P>
<P>
Sun and his wife of 12 years, Betty, face formidable challenges in managing the 
growth. "We either go real big or real small," he explained. Sun is going big. 
</P>
<P>
"We see the evolution (in the industry) from the hobby type of store to a 
something that's a wholly different ball game," observed Joan Stael, president 
of StoreBoard Inc., a Dallas market research company. "It is not normal 
retailing by any stretch of the imagination. Those who don't get into trouble 
are creative merchants who are one step ahead of the competition." 
</P>
<P>
The personal attention that the Suns offered when they were a mom-and-pop 
operation has been a critical element in their success. "The dilemma is that we 
have to change. We're growing so fast, but will we lose the personal touch that 
made us? David and I believe we can continue to be involved," Betty said. 
</P>
<P>
So far, her husband's entrepreneurial instincts have earned the company local 
and national kudos, including the Commerce Department National Minority Firm of 
the Year, Los Angeles Minority Business Enterprise Retail Firm of the Year and 
Venture Magazine/Arthur Young Entrepreneur of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
A key to his success has been the discipline and drive that he developed early 
during those 16-mile round-trip walks in Sichuan. He left Hong Kong at 15 to 
nurture that discipline at Shattuck Academy in Farbough, Minn., then a military 
school. 
</P>
<P>
When Sun moved to Westwood to attend UCLA, he showed unusual discipline as a 
new driver. He practiced driving to and from Los Angeles International Airport 
at 2 a.m. so he could drive his brother there. 
</P>
<P>
David's rise, however, is not near as dramatic as his father's. While David 
toiled at the farm, his father eked out a living as a camera repairman in Hong 
Kong where he earned as little as 50 cents a day and ate only bread. After he 
opened his own camera business, he was asked to become the distributor for Fuji 
film in Hong Kong. He eventually added mainland China. 
</P>
<P>
During the past 20 years, his father has built a multimillion-dollar business 
that employs 300. "The Sun family is very prominent (in Hong Kong); we don't 
have to do this," explained Betty, who is executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
"We do it for our own interest, a hobby," said Betty, a graduate of UC Berkeley 
and holder of masters degrees in psychology and education. Like her husband, 
she moved to Hong Kong from China when she was 6 and went to high school in the 
United States in Idaho Falls, Ida. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Liked Computers 
</P>
<P>
After Sun graduated from UCLA with a degree in economics (he switched from 
pre-dental), he earned an MBA from Cal State University at Long Beach. For a 
graduate project, he bought an Apple computer to develop a statistical program 
that was not available. 
</P>
<P>
"David liked computers and Apple so much, he just wanted to have all the toys 
he wanted," said Betty, 33, who met her husband in a French class at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Sun's father offered David an opportunity to join the family business (his 
older brother, Dennis, a U.S.-trained pharmacist, did) or to start his own a 
business. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had worked for my father, I would always be in the shadow that someone 
else did it," said David, who figured that the worst that could happen on his 
own was that he might fail. "My father was against my starting my own company. 
He said I should work for a company to learn structure. I agreed. But if I had 
done that, I would have missed the opportunity. There are certain windows in 
time for people. I believed that was the time; I grabbed it quickly." 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, at age 23, David opened his first store in Huntington Beach with 
$10,000 from his father. He was the only full-time employee and worked seven 
days a week, commuting from Torrance. He had an inventory of seven Apple 
computers. In this first year of business, sales hit nearly $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Today, he goes through 1,000 computers a month. About 60% of all Sun's sales 
are Apple products. It also sells equipment produced by AST, Hewlett-Packard 
and Toshiba. The chain serves both consumers and business customers, providing 
the expertise and personal service demanded by today's more sophisticated and 
demanding computer users. 
</P>
<P>
Sun's growth has paralleled that of Apple. But when the Apple executive who 
approved plans for the first Sun store later left Apple, he told David that he 
had had early doubts that Sun would actually make it. "I outlasted him at 
Apple," Sun quips proudly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Turning Point 
</P>
<P>
"What motivates David is he wants to realize his potential -- what he can do," 
said his wife. "David is fearless. He often says, 'I lived my hardships in my 
early childhood.' " 
</P>
<P>
A big turning point for the Suns came at the second store in Lomita when a 
customer wandered into the store with an NEC printer that other dealers said 
they could not repair. 
</P>
<P>
Sun examined the machine, noted that the switches were not set correctly and 
made the necessary adjustments. The printer worked. Sun provided the service at 
no charge. 
</P>
<P>
The grateful customer, who turned out to be an aerospace employee, sent Sun's 
name to TRW's purchasing department, and within weeks Sun was invited to bid on 
his first corporate contract, which he won. That opened an entirely new 
customer base, which Betty built. 
</P>
<P>
"In the early days with TRW, I talked with the customers, took the orders, 
packed the orders and delivered them myself," Betty said. "If an item was 
defective, I would deliver the replacement myself. I liked to do it, it was the 
personal touch." 
</P>
<P>
Today, corporate and business clients include TRW, Hughes Aircraft, Rockwell 
International, McDonnell Douglas, UCLA, UC Irvine, Los Angeles Unified School 
District, Arco Transportation, Mars Co. and Southern California Edison. Betty 
still takes calls and orders from clients. 
</P>
<P>
"The basic philosophy of Sun Computers is: Honesty is our No. 1 priority. We 
want our customers to feel yes, we made a profit, but it is fair and we've 
earned it. We feel honesty has gotten us where we are," said Betty. "Some of 
our corporate customers even know our costs, they know our profit, especially 
the large corporate customer." 
</P>
<P>
Many competitors also know Sun's costs. "Sun is clearly in business to be in 
business," said William E. Thomas, district manager of Businessland's 10 stores 
in Southern California who competes with Sun for corporate accounts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lean Operation 
</P>
<P>
"We pretty much all know one another's costs for the products," Thomas said. 
"Some competitors sell items at or below cost just to sustain revenue flow, 
whereas it appears that Sun considers profitability of the business. They are 
very aggressive. They are as aggressive on pricing as anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
Sun Computers is as lean as it is aggressive. David does not like to lay off 
people, so he keeps his staff to a minimum. Often some of his 130 employees 
sound harried as they answer phones. "Someone said we are the best 
firefighters. We have had to take care of a lot of fires. It's not a good thing 
to be, but at least we can do it," David said. 
</P>
<P>
When Sun bumped into his Lomita store manager at the Carson corporate 
headquarters a week after Christmas, Mike Hamilton was nursing a cold. "The 
reason Mike is sick is he worked so hard during Christmas." He said: "It's not 
easy to work for me. I'm not easy to please. My best trait as a manager is I 
drive more out of people than others." 
</P>
<P>
David, who always wears white shirts with his suits, believes that people are 
the most important asset of a business, and he sets high expectations for 
himself and his employees. He may be satisfied with their performance, "but I 
never tell them." As Betty said: "David always compares people with himself. He 
always says, 'How come people don't work as hard as me?' " 
</P>
<P>
"My vision is that they target higher than what they can do," explained David. 
"I always believe in pushing. Once they achieve a certain level, I don't expect 
them to go below that. That becomes the new minimum. Life is not easy. When 
people say America is the land of opportunity, I believe that. What they don't 
say is that you have to work very hard to get it." 
</P>
<P>
"Everything has a measureable unit, even if it is intangible," he said. "Even 
our receptionist -- the number of complaints; the number of rings before a 
phone is answered. We're all here to grow and progress, if you don't measure 
things, how do we know if we grow and progress?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Touch of Humor 
</P>
<P>
Betty lives with a triple whammy. "I live with high expectations not only as 
his wife, but as a good businesswoman and mother. Boy, what a job. He always 
says, 'Betty you're paid to work.' When I asked about a three-month maternity 
leave (they have a daughter, 7, and son, 6), he said, 'You're my wife. It's 
your own business.' " 
</P>
<P>
But he humors his staff, too. Sun once threatened to give his sales staff blank 
business cards so they could fill in their names in pencil in case they did not 
make their sales quotas. "I joke a lot. If you work hard without humor, it is 
twice as much hardship. You have to be able to laugh it off. The key is to try 
to create an atmosphere of having a good time even if we have to work hard." 
</P>
<P>
Betty softens the edge to her husband's demands. Having worked as a counselor 
for the Los Angeles Unified School District before joining the company, she 
takes a counseling approach to her corporate clients, learning about their 
needs and requirements before recommending a product. 
</P>
<P>
"David looks at the bottom line, the dollars and cents," explains Betty. "I 
look at the business as something that we nurtured, that we developed. You have 
to be a businessman to succeed, but if you're just a strategic businessman you 
lose personal relationships with vendors and customers. I come in as that link. 
I develop those relationships." 
</P>
<P>
Sun Computers, like other dealers, has faced tough times. "1984-1985 really was 
the only time in the history of Sun when we had to wonder about Sun," David 
said. "No phone calls were coming in. We were lean. . . . I don't think we ever 
lost hope. . . . We treated it like a learning phase." 
</P>
<P>
"It was the only point that he once thought for a split second to dissolve the 
company," recalled Betty. "But David said, 'We've come this far, we'll go 
through it.' He looks at Sun Computers as his baby. He'll never give it up." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Didn't Fit Talents 
</P>
<P>
David, who worries about losing hair -- "I think a lot, that's why I'm losing 
hair. I'm losing hair like crazy" -- wondered briefly if he was burnt out three 
years ago. "Too many things were not going right. We were trying to put in a 
new structure, cut operations costs, yet we were not realizing it." 
</P>
<P>
Then in 1987, Sun Computers hired a president. "I was trying to establish a 
presence in Hong Kong. I knew I'd be tied up in the Orient. I wanted someone to 
manage. The president (who he would not identify) was and is a good friend. He 
had good talents. This environment didn't fit his talents as I expected. To 
fit, he would have had to change. He was from banking, which was a lot slower 
pace." 
</P>
<P>
Did he offer his wife the job? "I don't think Betty's best ability is to be the 
next president. I don't think she has the understanding for the next level. Why 
take away what she does best: dealing with customers? I'm not sure she wants to 
be president. The big challenge is to find someone like me." 
</P>
<P>
The other goals for Sun Computers is "to stay ahead of the industry and achieve 
economies of scale." A major decision that the company is wrestling with is 
whether to launch its expansion in Southern California, where it operates 11 
stores, or to move into Northern California where there are no Sun stores. The 
chain has two stores in Seattle. The goal is to have 30 stores along the West 
Coast in three years. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Sun is looking to other computer affiliated businesses. "We want 
to diversify a little." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the Suns believe that fierce competition and downward pressure on 
prices in the United States will slow profit and sales industrywide. So they 
are moving aggressively into Hong Kong. "If overseas is growing, the West Coast 
will benefit the most. In Hong Kong, we have an advantage there. We have 
contacts." 
</P>
<P>
Sun has a staff of 36 in Hong Kong where it has opened two outlets, one known 
as the Apple Centre, a retail concept which has only been used in Europe and 
caters to the business user. 
</P>
<P>
Howard E. Hamann, Sun's attorney at the law firm of Mendes &amp; Mount, sums up 
his former classmate at Shattuck: 
</P>
<P>
"He knows what he wants and where he is going. I don't think he sees obstacles 
or barriers. He see things as challenges."

U.S. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh Sunday called the FBI's undercover probe of 
alleged fraudulent trading on the world's two largest commodities futures 
exchanges "far reaching" and "significant." 
</P>
<P>
It was the first government acknowledgement that traders and brokers at the 
Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange -- and perhaps the 
exchanges themselves -- are targets of a federal grand jury investigation into 
a range of illegal trading practices that may have cost customers tens of 
millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh's confirmation of the investigation came as a Board of Trade veteran 
and former exchange official said the investigation alone, regardless of its 
outcome, was "a disaster for the reputation of the board. And a loss of 
reputation cuts down trust in the market." 
</P>
<P>
The probe "does reflect an increased concern on our part, in the Department of 
Justice, to deal with fraud and insider dealings in both the securities and 
commodities markets," Thornburgh said on NBC's "Meet The Press." "The people 
who trade on these markets are entitled to their integrity, and we hope to work 
with the leadership in both the commodities and securities markets to ensure 
that people are getting a square deal. We'll be announcing soon a much 
beefed-up operation in this regard because this is basically a pro-consumer 
initiative." 
</P>
<P>
The three-year investigation is "the result of an uncover operation carried out 
superbly by the FBI," Thornburgh said. At least five FBI agents worked as 
commodity traders for 18 months while wearing hidden microphones to collect 
evidence of alleged wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be gathering and submitting evidence (to a grand jury) to see if 
violations of the federal criminal laws have occurred," said Thornburgh who, 
since becoming attorney general last fall, has emphasized fighting white-collar 
crime. He declined to predict when any definitive action can be expected from 
the grand jury, which began calling witnesses and seeking records last week. 
</P>
<P>
Before Thornburgh's acknowledgement Sunday, both FBI and Justice Department 
officials refused all comment on the investigation in an apparent attempt to 
minimize any impact it might have on trading at the two exchanges. However, 
word began to spread throughout Chicago's financial community last week after 
the first subpoenas were delivered. 
</P>
<P>
So far dozens of commodities traders and brokers who work in the noisy, 
bazaar-like trading pits of the two exchanges have been subpoenaed during by 
the grand jury -- some as recently as Sunday. Both exchanges have also received 
subpoenas from the grand jury asking for six years of records covering tens of 
millions of complex transactions. 
</P>
<P>
"This (investigation) really gets to the core of the exchange. It questions the 
reputation and the integrity of the exchange," said a 30-year veteran and 
former Board of Trade official who discussed the government's investigation 
with The Times on the condition that he not be identified by name. "Regardless 
of the outcome it will take years to build up confidence again. 
</P>
<P>
"This could rob users of the marketplace of confidence in the way that market 
works," the former official said. 
</P>
<P>
Centered in Chicago, commodities futures exchanges are international markets. 
They are used by major financial institutions, insurance companies, farmers, 
grain companies, importers and exporters and multinational corporations as a 
hedge against price swings. Traders and brokers, working in crowded pits -- 
literally depressions or small arenas on the trading floor -- buy and sell 
contracts guaranteeing delivery of commodities at a future date for a 
guaranteed price. 
</P>
<P>
Commodities traded this way range from corn, soybeans and pork bellies to 
foreign currencies, Treasury bonds and precious metals. The markets provide 
those using them with a kind of insurance. For example, a farmer can sell his 
crops at a set price months before the harvest and food processors can assure 
themselves quantities of commodities at a set price months before they actually 
need them.

JET FIGHTER PACT WIDENS RIFT OVER SHARING OF DATA

<P>
Scant attention was paid over the past decade when Japanese industry forged 
ahead with the task of making mundane commercial products out of "new 
materials" -- high-technology compounds spun off from U.S. defense research. 
</P>
<P>
But now the technology, improved and refined by Japanese makers of golf clubs, 
industrial ceramics and fishing rods, is about to circle back to its 
originators as an innovative wing design for a jet fighter. 
</P>
<P>
The arrangements for what will become a landmark reverse-transfer of military 
technology did not come easily, however, and not without raising hackles about 
"techno-nationalism," a phrase some analysts use to describe a syndrome of 
mutual suspicion and mistrust that is straining relations between two of the 
world's closest allies. 
</P>
<P>
Although U.S. and Japanese officials agreed in October, 1987, that defense 
contractors from both countries would jointly develop Japan's next-generation 
support fighter, the FSX, final details for sharing the workload were not 
settled until Jan. 12. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations had snagged over how the Japanese would hand over technology for 
the radical design of the aircraft's wings, which will incorporate 
sophisticated carbon fiber materials. But more was at stake than the industrial 
secrets of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the lead contractor. 
</P>
<P>
Festering beneath the surface of the dispute over the FSX wing were complex 
questions of U.S. national security and the competitiveness of America's 
high-technology industrial base, which has been losing contests to its Japanese 
rivals on a number of commercial fronts. 
</P>
<P>
In essence, the American side perceives a stubborn reluctance on the part of 
Japanese corporations to pay back a technological debt to the United States. 
Much of what Japan now has to offer, analysts say, has grown out of commercial 
applications based on U.S. technology that has been acquired at nominal costs 
over several decades. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Signs of Arrogance 
</P>
<P>
In June, Japan took a symbolic step to remedy the imbalance by signing a 
science and technology agreement with the United States that opens government 
laboratories and provides $4 million to invite U.S. scientists here. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there is a growing fear -- on both sides of the Pacific -- that Japan is 
losing sight of its technological indebtedness and that recent achievements in 
the marketplace have bred arrogance among some Japanese engineers and 
corporations. 
</P>
<P>
"Technological arrogance is catching like a cold, especially among younger 
engineers," said Makoto Momoi, a defense analyst and former official of the 
Japan Defense Agency. "They don't remember that we were born with the abacus, 
not the computer." 
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi, which obtained the foundation for its postwar aerospace technology 
from U.S. licensing agreements, at first demanded that it be allowed to go it 
alone in developing the FSX, without American help or interference. 
</P>
<P>
Its position reflected "nationalistic pride in Japan's superior technology," 
said a veteran U.S. observer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "Their 
argument was, we built the Zero, which was in its day the best fighter in the 
world. We can do it again." 
</P>
<P>
Only after much pressure was applied by U.S. officials did the Japanese agree 
to base the FSX design on technical data provided under license by General 
Dynamics Corp., which makes the F-16, America's front-line fighter. The U.S. 
aim was to help offset Japan's bilateral trade surplus and also to maintain 
compatibility between the weaponry of the two military allies. 
</P>
<P>
General Dynamics and its U.S. subcontractors will be awarded about 40% of the 
work on six prototypes for the $1.3-billion project and will have rights to any 
new technology used on the plane. But Mitsubishi balked at allowing the U.S. 
firm to acquire the technology for the wings by actually building some at its 
own plant in Ft. Worth, a move considered a crucial learning step. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prepared to Cooperate 
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi spokesman Takayoshi Furuya said both contractors ultimately were 
satisfied with the arrangement to have General Dynamics build two sets of wings 
and denied there was ever any intent to block the technology transfer. 
</P>
<P>
"Our aim is to build a good plane, not to fuss about who gets what share," 
Furuya said. "We were prepared to cooperate with General Dynamics from the 
beginning. We just wondered why they couldn't acquire the technology here in 
Japan." 
</P>
<P>
Japanese analysts say the dispute over the FSX underscores a fundamental 
weakness in U.S. industry that is at the core of simmering techno-nationalism. 
Despite America's formidable prowess in basic research, American firms are 
overly reliant on Pentagon contracts and defense-related government research 
funding. At the same time, they are short-sighted when it comes to investing in 
commercial development that would allow them to fully exploit their wealth of 
high technology. 
</P>
<P>
"When the new materials first came out, Japanese industry started with the 
simplest of applications," said Hajime Karatsu, a professor at Tokai 
University's Research &amp; Development Institute. "Only after they had 
confidence about building a better fishing rod did they think about using it in 
aerospace." 
</P>
<P>
Karatsu, formerly an engineer with Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., cites 
Japan's dominance in the market for computer memory chips as the classic 
example of how its electronics firms leapfrogged their American mentors. 
</P>
<P>
When integrated circuits first came out, Japanese companies devoted themselves 
to mass producing electronic calculators, spurring a demand for memory chips 
that created economies of scale and fostered constant reinvestment in 
production equipment. The Japanese perfected production techniques by selling 
to a booming commercial market while U.S. companies made their chips in lower 
volume, and on antiquated machinery, for the Pentagon's missiles, Karatsu said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sees Some Limits 
</P>
<P>
Japan's decisive victory in the chip war has sparked dire warnings that the 
United States is now dependent on a foreign country for a crucial supply of 
military components and high technology. 
</P>
<P>
The high-tech alarm is expected to gain increasing attention in the coming 
year, as U.S. policy-makers focus on restoring competitiveness to American 
industry. Already, in a textbook show of techno-nationalism, Japanese firms 
have been denied participation in Sematech, a government-sponsored research 
project begun last November, in which U.S. companies are pooling their efforts 
to catch up in the development and production of advanced memory chips. 
</P>
<P>
Sematech was inspired by research consortiums that the Japanese and European 
governments sponsored in the 1970s, said Andrew Procassini, president of the 
U.S. Semiconductor Industry Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"Techno-nationalism is not a U.S. invention," Procassini said. "We're learning 
it from other people." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Industry Scolded 
</P>
<P>
The critical battle in the U.S.-Japan technology showdown appears to be taking 
shape in the development of superconductors, which allow electricity to flow 
without resistance and that have an array of potential applications in such 
products as magnetically levitated trains and compact supercomputers. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Office of Technology Assessment warned in a report last June that 
although the American government will spend $95 million on superconductor 
research in fiscal 1988, half that will go to military research with limited 
commercial applications. The agency also scolded U.S. industry for emphasizing 
short-term profits over long-term payoffs in its research and development 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
The Defense Science Board, a Pentagon advisory panel, declared in November that 
the United States was "already well behind the Japanese in the development of 
superconductivity applications" and urged a major boost in spending. 
</P>
<P>
In another display of techno-nationalism, scientific conferences sponsored by 
the U.S. government have been closed to Japanese and other foreigners. Sen. 
John Glenn (D-Ohio) summed up the mood when he said last year: "America can't 
afford to let other countries reap the lion's share of rewards from our 
superconductivity research program." In contrast, the Japanese government has 
gone out of its way to show it does not intend to promote superconductor 
research as a national contest. 
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Trade and Industry, calling for "competition and cooperation," 
has urged foreign companies and scientists to join its research consortium, the 
International Superconductivity Technology Center. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
American Indifference 
</P>
<P>
But so far, not a single American or other foreign firm has decided it would be 
worthwhile to pay the $800,000 initiation fee necessary to participate in the 
research and have full access to results, according ot a MITI official. Six 
foreign companies, including four from the United States, have signed on as 
associate members with limited rights -- and far lower fees. 
</P>
<P>
The flip side to Japanese technological arrogance, analysts say, is American 
indifference, which they describe with another buzzword: "techno-isolationism." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. engineers and scientists have been slow to take advantage of opportunities 
to work in Japanese labs, even after last year's science and technology pact, 
while their Japanese counterparts still flock to the United States for advanced 
study at the top universities. 
</P>
<P>
"Americans are in general less concerned about what happens in Japan," one U.S. 
analyst said. "There's a 'not-invented-here' syndrome, a feeling that if it 
isn't generated in a U.S. lab, it doesn't have scientific validity." 
</P>
<P>
That attitude could prove costly as Japan, propelled by massive civilian 
research spending, threatens to overtake the United States or widen its 
existing lead in such key technological fields as supercomputers, biotechnology 
and laser optics. 
</P>
<P>
Data on U.S. patents, meanwhile, suggest Japan is evolving from a stage of 
mimicking and improving upon foreign know-how to one in which it is creating 
its own. But many Japanese complain of being unable to shake off the copycat 
reputation, or the suspicion that they owe their success to a free ride. 
</P>
<P>
"The United States has a lot of pride," and even a trace of racism, said Noboru 
Makino, chairman of the Mitsubishi Research Institute. "It's the WASP 
mentality. Americans still have a sense that people with Oriental faces must be 
doing something unfair to make such good things."

Southern California Edison Co. reports that contributions during the first six 
weeks of its 1988-89 Winter Energy Assistance Fund campaign are 25% ahead of 
last year's total for the entire campaign. An Edison spokesman said its 
customers have contributed $450,000 to the fund, which provides emergency funds 
to pay electric bills for poor residential customers who are handicapped or 
disabled. 
</P>
<P>
Edison matches customer contributions dollar for dollar. During the past six 
years, the fund has distributed $3.6 million to needy households, Edison said. 
Disbursements from the 1988-89 fund, administered by United Way, will begin in 
February, the utility said.

Accent on Tower 
</P>
<P>
The Title Guarantee tower in downtown Los Angeles is finally going to become 
the genuine article. 
</P>
<P>
From 1977 to 1982, the 12-story building at the corner of Fifth and Hill 
streets housed the Los Angeles Tribune, the fictional newspaper in the 
television series "Lou Grant." The building's exterior and lobby were shown on 
the series that starred Ed Asner as curmudgeonly city editor Lou Grant, but 
there was never a newsroom, fake or real, in the tower, says developer Daniel 
Swartz. 
</P>
<P>
That will change in May when the edifice, built in 1930 as an insurance company 
headquarters, becomes home to a real newspaper: La Opinion, the 
Spanish-language daily.

Laughing at Own Problems 
</P>

Brokers at the troubled investment banking firm Drexel Burnham Lambert can have 
a pretty good sense of humor -- even when the joke's on them. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, brokers from Drexel offices in Los Angeles, New York and St. Louis 
separately placed calls to the Shalek Agency, a Los Angeles advertising firm. 
Each asked for copies of a mock advertisement that the agency created for an 
article that appeared in the Jan. 15 issue of the Los Angeles Times Magazine, 
"Picturing the New L.A." 
</P>
<P>
The ad features a boy standing on a Beverly Hills street corner, hawking maps 
while holding a sign that reads, "Maps to the Stock Brokers Homes." The agency 
has received so many calls for copies of the mock ad that executives are 
considering licensing it as a poster. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think we'd end up in the poster business," said Nancy Shalek, the 
agency's founder. "I suppose we could do greeting cards next."

For the second straight year, the company that serves this market with mobile 
telephone service, Irvine-based PacTel Cellular, was the nation's largest 
provider. The subsidiary of Pacific Telesis had 255,000 customers in six major 
markets, according to Radio Communications Report, a trade journal. 
</P>
<P>
That's not bad, considering the industry only got started during the Los 
Angeles Olympics in 1984. The company had just 155,000 subscribers last year. 
</P>
<P>
Another West Coast firm -- McCaw Cellular of Kirkland, Wash. -- finished a 
fast-closing second with 227,000 subscribers in 67 markets in 24 states, moving 
up from fourth place and 132,000 subscribers last year. Another cellular 
provider in California, GTE Mobilenet, ranked seventh.

Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., which won control of RJR Nabisco Inc. in 
November, plans to divest the tobacco conglomerate's holdings in South Africa 
amid pressure from investors who oppose that nation's race policies. The two 
holdings are Royal Beechnut, a confectioner, and South African Preserving Co., 
which produces canned fruit. The move came after the treasurer of Michigan 
threatened to withhold its $110-million pension fund investment in KKR's buyout 
of RJR because of the company's South African interests. Michigan has a law 
that took effect Jan. 1 barring investment in companies with ties to South 
Africa.

Procter &amp; Gamble Co. announced that it plans to remove palm oil from 
Crisco, its vegetable-based shortening product. The National Heart Savers Assn. 
of Omaha, Neb., which has been pressuring food manufacturers to alter product 
ingredients, applauded Procter &amp; Gamble's announcement. P&amp;G officials 
said Crisco is made mainly from soybean oil, with palm oil added for stability 
and baking performance. The new palm oil-free version is to be sold later this 
year as supplies of the special grade of vegetable oil needed to meet Crisco's 
standards become available, company officials said. The new Crisco, like the 
current product, will be all-vegetable and contain no cholesterol.

Television talk show host Morton Downey Jr. says he's clinched the deal to buy 
Del Webb's Claridge Casino Hotel in Atlantic City N.J., but Claridge officials 
refused to confirm that claim late last week. Downey said his attorneys were 
notified of the acceptance and immediately began drawing up "a definitive 
contact" for the purchase. Neither Claridge officials nor their investment 
banking firm, Oppenheimer &amp; Co., agreed with Downey's assessment. "The 
Claridge board of directors has not acted to accept any offer for the purchase 
of the Claridge, and when it does, we will make it official," said Glenn 
Lillie, a Claridge spokesman.

Many Japanese housewives living in the United States have not warmed up to one 
of the most convenient methods for buying things in this country -- catalogue 
shopping. 
</P>
<P>
For them, the process of ordering merchandise in English, from reading product 
descriptions to conversing with American salespeople over the telephone is a 
nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
This frustration motivated a New York-based Japanese business to launch the 
first Japanese-language catalogue in the United States.

introduced the 32-page, four-color catalogue last November. The catalogue is 
targeted at the 250,000 Japanese residents in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The service accepts shopping orders by mail and telephone, in Japanese -- a 
great relief for Japanese families sent to work in the United States before 
they could perfect their English, said Iida, the firms's executive vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
The new catalogue lists nearly 300 products, ranging from typical American 
consumer products to items that can be obtained only at Japanese stores. In 
response to customers' greater need for the latter type of products, 
made-in-Japan items represent 80% of the catalogue's entire listing, Iida said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clothing Popular 
</P>
<P>
Sukiyaki pots, bath preparations and face rollers are among the most popular 
items. 
</P>
<P>
Clothing also ranked among the popular items among Japanese residents, Iida 
said, explaining that it is very difficult for them to find U.S.-made clothing 
that is fitted for their bodies. 
</P>
<P>
With an increasing Japanese business activity in the United States, more 
Japanese are beginning to settle in rural areas, a factor contributing to a 
rise in their reliance on companies such as Dynamix for securing Japanese 
products. 
</P>
<P>
Iida said most of the Japanese living in the United States, especially 
housewives, feel uncomfortable about many aspects of their American life, 
stemming from their lack of language skills. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can't Buy Tofu 
</P>
<P>
They do not know how to cope with the rush of shopping catalogues sent from 
many American stores to their homes every day. They do not know what kind of 
products are available from the catalogues, how to order them, how to lodge 
complaints and how to return undesired products. Each task requires a minimum 
skill of English language, Iida said. 
</P>
<P>
In an extreme case, he said, there are some Japanese who even have trouble 
buying a piece of tofu -- Japanese bean curd. They may have been transferred to 
the United States from Japan's most rural areas where English is rarely used. 
</P>
<P>
The new venture uses a membership plan, requiring customers to pay an annual 
fee of $15 to receive four catalogues a year and $50 worth of gift coupons. 
Already, 13,000 have joined the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Orders in the first month of distribution have been well ahead of expectations, 
Iida said, forecasting annual sales to exceed an originally projected $4 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The company has enjoyed a 15% response rate from a mailing of the catalogue 
sent to 40,000 Japanese households in the United States -- much higher than an 
average rate of 2% to 3% normally seen in the mail-order business.

ORANGE COUNTY OPERA REVIEW;

<P>
TWO CASTS IN NYCO 'WIDOW' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
New York City Opera shucked the serious stuff and turned to Franz Lehar's "The 
Merry Widow" over the weekend to close a 6-day run at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
The production, new in 1982, was revived last year and offers much that is 
attractive to look at. Helen Pond and Herbert Senn's Nouveau sets -- dominated 
by turquoise, purple and rose -- are handsome. Suzanne Mess' 
turn-of-the-century costumes are bright and stylish. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Bentley's staging, initially criticized for overly busy high jinks, was 
later toned down into relatively straightforward action; it was this version 
that was recreated in Orange County by Cynthia Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
The company offered two casts in key roles. 
</P>
<P>
Leigh Munro was a warm, appealing, vulnerable, melting and yielding Sonia 
(a.k.a. Hanna Glawari, the Widow) Saturday afternoon. She sang with an 
aristocratic, dark-toned, weighty soprano, but inclined more toward beauty of 
vowels than clarity of enunciation. Thus, she sang "Vilia" with gentleness and 
refined pianissimo, but the words were virtually indistinct. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday evening, Michele McBride proved an intelligent, sophisticated, sly, 
sensual and clever Sonia. She offered fine-edged vocalism, though with some 
wobbliness under pressure. But she sang "Vilia" with clear diction, seamless 
line and magical tenderness. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, opposite each of them as Danilo was baritone Louis Otey -- tall, 
broad-shouldered, handsome in a Clark Gable look-alike way, but stiff and 
wooden in acting. There was virtually no chemistry between him and Munro in the 
afternoon, but he reacted more credibly to McBride in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
In both cases, he sang with coarse, forced vocalism, and had problems, 
particularly in the afternoon -- losing focus, tone and even, at times, 
control. Oddly, he, rather than the Widows, got to interpolate a song in Act 
III, "Girls Were Made to Love and Kiss" (from Lehar's "Paganini"). But the 
effort drew no applause whatsoever from the Saturday evening audience. 
</P>
<P>
(Nor did the song fit well stylistically or in terms of its orchestration. 
"Paganini" was written 20 years after "Merry Widow," and in the meantime Lehar 
had worked hard to develop his style.) 
</P>
<P>
The secondary pair of lovers proved quite different. Gran Wilson brought 
matinee-idol looks to Camille in the afternoon, but sang with a light tenor 
more suitable for musical theater than opera, although it could blossom on top. 
He offered generalized acting. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Golden was his Natalie, singing with lyricism and clarity, and strongly 
exploiting her concern over their parting. 
</P>
<P>
As the evening Camille, Mark Thomsen proved boyish but ardent, attentive and 
serious. Despite a somewhat metallic and constricted tenor, he could portray 
pertinent, genuine distress. 
</P>
<P>
Opposite him, Susanne Marsee, who Tuesday had portrayed a sensuous Maddalena in 
Verdi's "Rigoletto," offered a rather prim, up-tight Natalie, and seemed more 
involved in a kind of cat-and-mouse game with him than conscious of painful 
loss. But she sang with fine focus. 
</P>
<P>
Appearing in both casts, James Billings divested himself of the TV sitcom 
cutesiness he had occasionally indulged in as the Second Priest in 
"Zauberflote" earlier in the week and offered a dry, clever Nisch. 
</P>
<P>
On both occasions, Imre Pallo conducted with style and dash, with lingering 
affection and expansiveness, despite a penchant for slow tempos. However, he 
also rather often allowed the instrumentalists to overwhelm the singers, 
particularly at the matinee. 
</P>
<P>
The company orchestra, which all week had repeated the dreary cycle of starting 
imprecisely and gaining confidence only as the evening progressed, introduced 
new levels of slovenliness at these performances. The strings, already 
thin-sounding, were sour and squeally in the heights, occurring invariably at 
the most exposed moments. 
</P>
<P>
Choreographer Sharon Halley provided stilted waltzes, pseudo-folk character 
dances and a surpassingly vulgar cancan. The dancers coped gamely, if not with 
much finesse. 
</P>
<P>
Adrian Ross' bright, clever translation was easily heard. Although 
amplification is often used for dialogue in operettas, none was used in this 
production, a company spokesman said.

DRAMA WAS HIGH, BUT NOT VOICE 
</P>

<P>
A new Queen of the Night brought dramatic and textual insights hitherto lacking 
in the role at New York City Opera's second (and final) presentation of 
Mozart's "Die Zauberflote" Friday at the Orange County Performing Arts Center 
in Costa Mesa. But the vocalism was far from ideal. 
</P>
<P>
As the arch-villain of Mozart's Masonic opera, Virginia Sublett revealed new 
aspects of character each time she appeared -- from plaintive, grief-burdened, 
sly manipulator (first aria); to coercive, forceful tyrant (second aria); to 
cold, contemptuous, even petulant conspirator (finale). 
</P>
<P>
It was an insightful, valuable tracing of character. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, although she offered rich, sonorous, dark-hued vocalism in 
mid-range, Sublett experienced severe problems whenever she ventured too far 
above the staff. Pitch and focus blurred whenever the voice ascended to a high 
C and above. She also had problems with agility and connected phrases, although 
she recovered nicely in "Der Holle rache" after some unfortunate sequences of 
wide-spreading tone.

ART; 
</P>
<P>
FOR BARRY LE VA, IT'S QUITE LOGICAL TO STUDY SEEMINGLY RANDOM ACTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A photographer asked artist Barry Le Va recently if he would perch on a white 
cube in one of the installations in his retrospective exhibit at the Newport 
Harbor Art Museum. Le Va obligingly sat down, and the cube began to give way 
with a dry, cracking sound. 
</P>
<P>
"They must have cast it much thinner than the others," he murmured as he 
examined the piece, made of plaster-like hydrastone. 
</P>
<P>
The piece would need to be fixed, of course, but the accident was hardly a 
tragedy. Although some viewers admire his art simply because of the way it 
looks -- the rambunctious disarray of "scatter pieces" from the 1960s, the 
austere, puzzlelike quality of later works -- Le Va has no interest in making 
it seductive to the eye. 
</P>
<P>
For this installation, "Stare Down (Abscessed Imprint)" from 1988, he 
deliberately left the plaster "absolutely unfinished," Le Va said. He used 
mahogany to make a mazelike piece that hangs on the wall -- not because of the 
sensuous character of the wood but "because there's less warpage and less 
grain," so the wall fixture can be read as "a continuous line." 
</P>
<P>
Slotlike components of the piece that hold huge aluminum balls in suspension 
are made of lowly fiberboard. Le Va even deglamorizes the balls by rubbing 
graphite on them to remove the shine of the metal. 
</P>
<P>
"I try not to embellish them," he said of his installations. "I try to keep 
them bland. The materials are based on the most immediate way the work can be 
done." 
</P>
<P>
For Le Va, making art is an intensely cerebral matter. 
</P>
<P>
During the past 2 decades, his chief concern has been to investigate the logic 
behind seemingly random activities. Both his installations of three-dimensional 
objects dispersed on gallery floors and walls and the complex drawings he makes 
for these pieces (considered full-fledged works in their own right) require the 
viewer to re-create mentally specific sequences of events. 
</P>
<P>
The quirky intellectual motivation behind Le Va's art has its roots in his 
teen-age fascination with architecture and mathematics. 
</P>
<P>
"When I visualize something in my mind, I visualize where things are locating 
themselves in space," he said. "I tend to look at drawing as if I'm looking 
down at something, never as a frontal view." 
</P>
<P>
For "Stare Down," he explained that the portion of the piece that hangs on the 
wall is supposed to be understood as if seen from above -- as if the wall were 
the floor. The resulting disorientation is a major part of what Le Va is after. 
</P>
<P>
Growing up in Long Beach in the 1950s, Le Va's early interest in art was 
sparked by magazine illustrations of Abstract Expressionist paintings, which 
appealed to him mostly because of their huge scale. After dropping out of 
several universities, he finally enrolled at the Otis Art Institute in Los 
Angeles in 1963 to study painting. But his restlessness was not appeased. 
</P>
<P>
"The more I got involved with painting," he said, "the more it was 
dissatisfying to me. Because no matter what I did, it was going toward a fixed 
end result." 
</P>
<P>
During this discouraging period, Le Va spent his time looking at art, reading 
widely and listening to the avant-garde jazz of John Coltrane and Ornette 
Coleman. As Art in America writer Stephen Ellis has pointed out, Coleman and Le 
Va have both used methods of improvisation involving rigorous, self-imposed 
rules to discover "patterns at the edge of disorder." 
</P>
<P>
"I was really interested in getting rid of every influence and trying to make 
art on my own set of terms," Le Va said of his years at Otis. "I wanted art 
that really questioned the underlying structures of art. 
</P>
<P>
"One day I was looking around at the process that led to (the three-dimensional 
pieces he was making at the time) -- the remnants sitting in the studio, the 
overturned chairs, all of that. And that seemed to hold much more potential for 
me in terms of art making. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything seemed to be logical in terms of the cause-and-effect activity I 
was going through. If a can was overturned here, it was overturned because 
maybe I needed to pour something and the can was left on its side. It may have 
rolled to that position because of the force with which it was laid down or 
because the floor was warped, or something like that. "(The materials I used) 
one day would overlap with the materials of another day and another day. 
</P>
<P>
"That's more or less (the notion) I've proceeded with ever since. . . . It's 
not that I set out deliberately not to make an object. It's just that I'm 
interested in how things locate themselves in space through time -- whatever 
logic it takes for things to exist in space." 
</P>
<P>
Le Va says the logic underlining his work can be based on geometric patterns, 
mathematical formulas or even purely arbitrary events, like kicking an object 
across the floor. 
</P>
<P>
One early (1967-68) installation re-created in the Newport Harbor show, "Black 
Felt With Flour Dusted and Glass Dropped" is a seemingly wildly anarchic 
scattering of felt pieces on the floor -- large, irregular swaths, medium-size 
squares and tiny snippets -- punctuated by layered sheets of broken glass and a 
tidy rectangular area covered with a thin layer of flour. 
</P>
<P>
It is up to the viewer to figure out the sequence in which Le Va accomplished 
the events (scattering, dropping, "dusting") that resulted in the surprisingly 
organized clutter visible in the piece. But in the absence of detailed 
explanations (Le Va's "clues" are limited to the titles he gives his pieces), 
how are viewers supposed to follow the complex logic of each piece? Does the 
artist even care whether viewers understand his work? 
</P>
<P>
He chewed on the question, answering it in a ruminative, somewhat 
self-contradictory way. 
</P>
<P>
"(Viewers) have to work," Le Va said. "I think art is something that has to be 
seen over and over and over again. You read a book the first time, you read it 
again and again, and the third time you have a whole different kind of 
understanding of the book than when you first read it. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always maintained that for some of these (works), you have to spend as 
much time with the work as it did for me to make it, which is at least 3 or 4 
days. So maybe somebody has to sit in that space for 3 or 4 days. But nobody is 
going to do it, and (the art) isn't about that kind of (activity) anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Then again, Le Va said he doesn't necessarily spend much time with other 
artists' exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
"I (may) walk out in 2 seconds because I immediately kind of think I know what 
they're about and I'm not interested beyond that," he said. "I think we all do 
it. The artists probably do it more than the public does. . . . Because (we've) 
seen so much, you know." 
</P>
<P>
And finally, Le Va admitted, "I may see the audience totally irrelevant to me 
while I'm making the work. Because I'm more after something I can learn from. 
The audience's acceptance or rejection of it doesn't matter too much." 
</P>
<P>
Le Va paused for a moment. "But I'm happy when they like it, sure," he added 
with a smile. "Ultimately, the real judges -- to me -- are the peers I respect. 
My own generation (of artists)." 
</P>
<P>
His generation of conceptually attuned sculptors and draftsmen -- Le Va was 
born in 1941 -- includes such major American figures as Richard Serra, Vito 
Acconci, Mel Bochner, Richard Tuttle, Bruce Nauman and Eva Hesse. But Le Va 
declined to specify the artists he most admired. 
</P>
<P>
One important quality he shares with them is a disinclination to make work that 
overtly appeals to an art-market sensibility. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's about appeasing or amusing anybody," Le Va said of his art. 
"I think at the moment there is a lot of work that seems to be only on an 
amusement level. Amusement does not interest me at all." 
</P>
<P>

REBELS ATTACK ARGENTINE BASE; UP TO 24 DEAD

Armed civilians seized a small military base near the capital today, and up to 
24 people were killed or wounded before soldiers firing tank shells, mortars 
and machine guns retook most of the base, news reports and officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The civilian attackers who stormed the base carried pamphlets supporting 
officers who have led three previous uprisings, the private news agency Diario 
y Noticias said. 
</P>
<P>
"Militarily, the situation at the 3rd Infantry Regiment at La Tablada is 
dominated," the secretary for state intelligence, Facundo Suarez, told the 
government news agency Telam about 10 hours after the incident began. 
</P>
<P>
He admitted, however, that some civilian attackers remained inside, and gunfire 
could be heard coming from the base as he spoke on the radio. 
</P>
<P>
DyN, the news service, quoted a military source it did not identify as saying 
at least 20 of the estimated 50 civilian attackers were killed or wounded 
during fighting. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials said at least four soldiers were killed and 12 wounded in 
the fighting, along with one reporter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Caravan of Insurgents 
</P>
<P>
The attack by the rebels began about 3 a.m., when civilians in a truck crashed 
through the regiment's main gate, DyN said. Six cars followed, with 40 to 50 
people taking part in the attack, news agencies reported. 
</P>
<P>
According to DyN, as they entered the base, the civilians threw pamphlets 
supporting what is known as the "New Argentine Army" of Lt. Col. Aldo Rico, who 
led short-lived army uprisings in April, 1987, and January, 1988. Rico was 
dismissed and now is in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Two small tanks opened the noon counterattack, firing on the officers' club, in 
which the civilians were thought to be isolated, Telam said. Sporadic shooting 
continued for several hours. 
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Defense, anticipating a possible fourth insurrection against 
the government in the past 21 months, bolstered defenses at Government House 
and the official residence of President Raul Alfonsin, Telam said.

REMAINS OF HOLLYWOOD PILOT FOUND IN WRECKAGE ON ANACAPA ISLAND

<P>
A 77-year-old Hollywood pilot missing for more than two weeks has been found 
dead in the wreckage of his small plane in a wildlife preserve on Anacapa 
Island in Channel Islands National Park, officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot, John Thompson, had taken off from an airport in Watsonville on Jan. 
5 in a single-engine Cessna 172 and was the subject of an intensive search by 
the Civil Air Patrol after he failed to arrive at Santa Monica Airport as 
planned. 
</P>
<P>
The wreckage of his plane was spotted last Thursday by a pilot flying above a 
preserve for California brown pelicans on Anacapa Island, about 15 miles west 
of Oxnard, said Cindy Nielsen, a spokeswoman for Channel Islands National Park. 
A U.S. Coast Guard helicopter verified the discovery Friday, but the area is a 
closed nesting site for the endangered species and the Coast Guard waited for 
park officials to enter the protected area over the weekend and to identify the 
dead pilot, Nielsen said. 
</P>
<P>
An investigation was under way to determine the cause of the crash.

languages today for immigrant children gunned down during last week's 
schoolyard massacre. 
</P>
<P>
Eulogies were recited in Cambodian, Vietnamese, Laotian and English in front of 
mourners wearing white-and-black ribbons that honored the cultural traditions 
of the five victims' refugee families. Near the close of the ceremony, at 11:45 
a.m., organizers observed five minutes of silence. The time corresponded to the 
time of the attack six days ago.

HIGH COURT UPHOLDS STATE BAN ON TESTIMONY ADS FOR LAWYERS

The Supreme Court let stand a California rule that virtually bans all lawyer 
advertisements featuring testimonials or client endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
Six months after the high court said it would use a challenge to the California 
rule to issue a decision that would bind all the states, the justices dismissed 
the case today. 
</P>
<P>
The court's one-sentence opinion said a Los Angeles lawyer's appeal was being 
dropped "for want of a properly presented federal question." 
</P>
<P>
Mark H. Oring of Los Angeles was reprimanded by the California Bar Assn. for a 
radio commercial in which a client who had been involved in an auto accident 
praised Oring and his partner. 
</P>
<P>
Oring said the state rule presuming that testimonials are deceptive violates 
his free-speech rights. The California Supreme Court rejected Oring's challenge 
to the rule in 1987, and today's action by the U.S. high court leaves the state 
rule undisturbed.

DENOUNCES ABORTION ON DEMAND AS AN 'AMERICAN TRAGEDY'

President Bush told tens of thousands of demonstrators today that abortion on 
demand is an "American tragedy" and said he favors reversal of the landmark 
Supreme Court decision legalizing it. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking by telephone hookup to activists gathered near the White House on the 
16th anniversary of the historic Roe vs. Wade decision, Bush said he believes 
that the ruling "was wrong and should be overturned." 
</P>
<P>
The new President made the call shortly after Vice President Dan Quayle also 
assured anti-abortion leaders that the new Administration supports their cause. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to share with you my deep personal concern about our American tragedy 
-- abortion on demand," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Way of Life' 
</P>
<P>
"I think America needs a human life amendment, and I think when it comes to 
abortion, there's a better way -- the way of adoption, the way of life," he 
said, adding: 
</P>
<P>
"I'm confident that more and more Americans every year -- every day -- are 
hearing your message and taking it to heart. I promise you that the President 
hears you now and stands with you in a cause that must be won. God bless you 
all and God bless life." 
</P>
<P>
Talking to anti-abortion leaders earlier, Quayle said, "I have been involved 
with a lot of people in my state (Indiana) on this issue. I couldn't think of a 
more appropriate group to be meeting with." 
</P>
<P>
White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu accompanied Quayle to the meeting, 
and the vice president said Sununu was there because he wanted to hear the 
visitors' views. 
</P>
<P>
When a reporter asked whether the Bush Administration could succeed in getting 
the Roe vs. Wade decision reversed, Quayle replied, "Time will tell. We have 
the same commitment." He said it is important that someone stand up and speak 
for "those people who are not yet born." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Missouri Case 
</P>
<P>
The noontime rally and a march to Capitol Hill culminated a series of 
nationwide protests against the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision that 
legalized abortion. 
</P>
<P>
The debate has taken on added intensity this year, with a reconstituted Supreme 
Court considering a Missouri case with the potential to result in significant 
changes in the legal doctrine governing abortion. 
</P>
<P>
In downtown Pittsburgh, about 1,200 pro-choice marchers joined a "March For 
Women's Lives." They were met at the Allegheny County morgue by about 40 
anti-abortion marchers. 
</P>
<P>
The pro-choice march was preceded by a rally at which Eleanor Smeal, a former 
National Organization for Women president, said, "Some people want to save 
their souls by spilling the blood of innocent women. That isn't Christianity. 
It's hypocrisy. The church has no business dictating the policies of this 
country." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Bush said, "Let's go to work," as he presided at a brief 
ceremony in the East Room at which 65 White House staff members were sworn in 
by Quayle. Bush declared that the lights in his White House will "burn brightly 
well after dark," and he instructed his senior staff to put in long hours. He 
also told them to avoid even the appearance of conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush would soon set up a 
commission to propose ways of strengthening ethics laws governing both 
Administration officials and members of Congress.

<TEXT>
<P>
Surrealist painter Salvador Dali, whose fantastic and memorable dreamscapes 
were as eccentric and flamboyant as his behavior, died today in his hometown, 
his doctor said. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
Dali died at 10:15 a.m. at Figueras Hospital, said Dr. Charles Ponsati. "The 
cause of death was cardiac arrest brought on by his respiratory insufficiency 
and pneumonia," Ponsati said. 
</P>
<P>
The painter had been in poor health and confined to a wheelchair since 
suffering severe burns in an electrical fire in his home in August, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 Founder of Surrealism 
</P>
<P>
Dali, who was a founder of the surrealist movement, was born on May 11, 1904, 
in this small Catalonian town. He was the last of an outstanding generation of 
Spanish painters that included Pablo Picasso and Joan Miro. 
</P>
<P>
His "Persistence of Memory" -- with its melting clocks and barren landscape -- 
is perhaps the world's most celebrated surrealist painting: a vivid image that 
became an indelible part of 20th-Century culture. 
</P>
<P>
"The Divine Dali," as he liked to call himself, was instantly recognizable: his 
pointed, waxed mustache curling up like a bull's horns, his long hair falling 
over his neck and one of his more than 30 walking sticks draped over an arm. 
</P>
<P>
What Dali called his "sublime craziness," began early -- he was expelled from 
art school in 1926 for arrogance and was briefly jailed for Catalonian 
separatist political activities. He said later, "The only difference between a 
crazy person and me is the fact that I am not crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Few critics faulted Dali's technical virtuosity, although his work was not held 
in the highest esteem. Nonetheless he was overwhelmingly popular: in 1979 and 
1980, a major retrospective drew more than a million visitors in Paris and 
250,000 in London. 
</P>
<P>
sh Youthful Creativity 
</P>
<P>
To most critics, Dali was a flawed talent -- sometimes managing to balance 
realistic technique and irrational content, but all too often caught up in his 
own role as a poseur-painter. He completed most of his critically successful 
works before he was 35. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to being a painter, Dali was a decorator, a fashion and jewelry 
designer and an author of poetry, prose and essays. 
</P>
<P>
After being kicked out of the School of Fine Arts in Madrid, Dali went to Paris 
and quickly became involved in the surrealist movement. 
</P>
<P>
But Dali's exhibitionism and egocentrism provoked the wrath of his fellows when 
he claimed: "Surrealism is me." At the end of the 1936-39 Spanish Civil War, he 
was drummed out of the movement as a "phony" and an "arch-Francoist 
dilettante." Dali made no secret of his support for the 36-year regime of 
Francisco Franco. 
</P>
<P>
With a loan from Picasso, Dali made his first trip to the United States in 1934 
with Gala, the Russian-born woman who became his faithful companion, muse and 
the touchstone of his personality and life. 
</P>
<P>
Gala Dimitrovna Diaharoff met Dali in 1929 when she and her husband, French 
surrealist poet Paul Eluard, visited the painter at his seaside home on Spain's 
northeastern Costa Brava. 
</P>
<P>
At Dali's request, she never left. They married in 1958, six years after 
Eluard's death. They had no children -- Dali said geniuses always produced 
mediocre children.

Americans for Democratic Action, one of the country's oldest liberal political 
action groups, released its annual ratings of congressional voting records 
today and gave Vice President Dan Quayle a zero rating for his last year in the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
The ADA gave two senators -- Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) and Claiborne Pell 
(D-R.I.) -- perfect scores for their 1988 voting records, while 11 Republican 
senators, including Quayle, who represented Indiana in the Senate, received 
scores of zero. The ADA, founded by such liberal stalwarts as Eleanor 
Roosevelt, Hubert H. Humphrey, Walter P. Reuther, and John Kenneth Galbraith, 
has been rating the voting records of members of Congress since 1947.

Iraq, home of some of the world's oldest archeological sites, is turning to the 
private sector to spark a tourist boom after eight years of war with Iran. 
</P>
<P>
As part of a drive to loosen rigorous state control of the economy, the 
official press has said major hotels and almost all state-run tourist firms 
will be sold off in whole or part. 
</P>
<P>
Al-Iraq daily quoted tourism commission chief Abdul-Tawab al Mullah Huwaish as 
saying 38 tourist enterprises will be offered in their entirety to Iraqi and 
other Arab companies. 
</P>
<P>
A 51% stake in 36 other firms would be sold off, he said, and to ensure their 
freedom from state control, no government representatives would sit on their 
boards. 
</P>
<P>
Babylon, Sumer and Ur are among a string of ancient sites that could be big 
tourist draws after the August cease-fire with Iran. 
</P>
<P>
Since President Saddam Hussein launched a privatization campaign more than a 
year ago, more than 50 state-owned enterprises, including farms, 
food-processing plants and light industrial projects, have been privatized. 
</P>
<P>
The tourist commission said last week that 51% of the 21-story Baghdad Sheraton 
hotel is to be offered to private investors and run by a company with capital 
of 50 million dinars ($160 million).

European foreign ministers today agreed to impose stiff duties on some U.S. 
imports but delayed implementing the sanctions to give both sides time to 
resolve a transatlantic trade dispute. 
</P>
<P>
The 12-nation European Economic Community will levy the tariffs if there is no 
move to ease the conflict by mid-February, Spanish Foreign Minister Francisco 
Fernandez Ordonez warned. "We hope the new North American administration will 
adopt a more intelligent attitude." 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Mission to the EEC said in a statement: "We want to make every effort 
to first contain and then resolve this dispute, and this decision . . . is 
clearly a positive step in that direction." 
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. officials also said they are "very concerned" about the ministers' 
decision to approve a list of products that "could eventually be the target of 
. . . counter-retaliation." 
</P>
<P>
The dispute was touched off by the EEC decision to impose a Jan. 1 ban on U.S. 
meat from cattle treated with growth hormones. The United States retaliated 
with higher tariffs on a variety of products from the trading bloc.

China signed a $30-million contract today to launch an American-built 
satellite, and officials said few obstacles remain in the way of Beijing's goal 
of entering the lucrative commercial space market. 
</P>
<P>
The scheduled 1990 launch of the telecommunications satellite Asiasat 1 has 
been overshadowed by claims in the U.S. that technological secrets could be 
leaked to Beijing during launches of Western satellites and that China's low 
prices are unfair competition. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Seddon, head of Asia Satellite Communications, told a news conference in 
the Great Hall of the People that agreements on satellite security and pricing 
signed by the United States and China late last year have allayed such fears. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has granted the satellite an export license and a meeting of 
Cocom -- a body which examines technology transfers to communist countries -- 
will discuss it later this month, he said. "We anticipate the results will be 
favorable." 
</P>
<P>
China has invited journalists and diplomats to its once top-secret Xichang 
launch site in the mountains of Sichuan province, in the hope of attracting 
more foreign custom for its Long March 3 carrier rockets.

CENTRAL BANKS' SELLING DRIVES DOLLAR LOWER

<P>
Nine central banks launched a new wave of open-market dollar sales today, 
driving the U.S. currency lower in their fourth-straight trading day of 
intervention. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the banks appeared determined to stamp out any rebound by the 
dollar after they had hit it particularly hard last week by dumping up to $2 
billion on the market to stop a disruptive new-year rally. 
</P>
<P>
They struck again today when new buying lifted the dollar near 1.85 West German 
marks. The dollar had opened higher in slow New York trading, with cautious 
optimism resurfacing for the currency, but the intervention soon took it lower. 
</P>
<P>
sh Numerous Banks 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve sold dollars around the day's high of 1.8480 marks. It was 
joined by the Bundesbank, the Bank of Canada and six other European central 
banks. 
</P>
<P>
At 12:30 p.m. EST the dollar stood at 1.8330 West German marks and 127.65 
Japanese yen, down from 1.8375 marks and 127.75 yen at Friday's close. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar stumbled last week after the central banks' selling and coordinated 
interest-rate increases in Europe, which brought the U.S. currency off its 
three-month highs against the West German mark. Firm U.S. rates and hopes that 
the Bush Administration will sharply cut the budget deficit had bolstered the 
currency. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Caution Abroad 
</P>
<P>
But the new central-bank dollar selling has sown new caution into the foreign 
exchange market, keeping a lid on the dollar's upside potential, dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like more people are letting dollars out," said Charles Spence of 
First Interstate Bank. "The top side is limited by the central bank 
intervention." 
</P>
<P>
Much of today's activity focused on dollar-mark trading. The yen has shown 
little movement, given the continued absence of the Bank of Japan from the 
central bank intervention. 
</P>
<P>
But traders said there was still some support for the dollar. "It's an orderly 
decline," said Stuart Frost of National Westminster Bank, adding that 
underlying corporate demand was still evident for dollars. "I still believe 
people want to buy dollars." 
</P>
<P>
This week's key U.S. economic indicator is expected to be Friday's release of 
fourth-quarter gross national product. Economists forecast the GNP to rise by 
2.4%, down from 2.5% in the previous quarter. But excluding the effects of the 
drought, growth last quarter would have been higher. 
</P>
<P>
Gold for February delivery was down 60 cents at $408.60 in midday trading on 
the Commodity Exchange in New York.

Ruling that the NCAA and the Southwest Conference are not government 
organizations, the Supreme Court today let stand a lower court finding that 
investigation files on Southern Methodist and other SWC schools need not be 
turned over to news organizations. 
</P>
<P>
In a case sparked by a football recruiting scandal at SMU, the court upheld a 
U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals decision that the NCAA and SWC are not 
subject to the Texas Open Records Act. The appeals court had overturned a 
decision by another federal judge. 
</P>
<P>
Because of NCAA sanctions against SMU, which is in Dallas, some Texas news 
organizations sought disclosure of files compiled by the NCAA. They also sought 
files compiled by the SWC, which includes four public universities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'73 State Law Invoked 
</P>
<P>
When the requests were denied, the news organizations sued, invoking the 1973 
state law that requires "governmental bodies" receiving "public funds" 
generally to make public their internal documents. 
</P>
<P>
A federal trial judge ruled that the state law applies to the NCAA and the 
Southwest Conference, and ordered that the sought-after documents be 
surrendered so it could be determined which should be made public. The U.S. 5th 
Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that ruling last July 26. 
</P>
<P>
The appeals court agreed that the NCAA and the SWC receive public funds, but it 
said they are not governmental bodies, defined as organizations "supported in 
whole or in part by public funds."

hours after leading the 49ers to their third Super Bowl victory of the 1980s. 
"It does not necessarily need that I be the coach. But we'll see. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be easier to do it (now). But I don't want to leave and then come 
back in nine days and say I changed my mind." 
</P>
<P>
Walsh did single out defensive coordinator George Seifert from what he called 
"a staff as good as any." 
</P>
<P>
"The single person who made the difference in our organization was George 
Seifert," he said. "He's the brightest, best tactician of defensive football 
and the players believe in him. I hope he's a head coach (next year). He sure 
deserves it." 
</P>
<P>
Walsh deserves credit for building the team of the decade. But he wouldn't put 
the 49ers in the class of the four-time champion Pittsburgh Steelers of the 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know who will ever break Chuck Noll and Pittsburgh's record," Walsh 
said. "That was as great a dynasty as any. The only difference (is faces); we 
did ours with three different teams. They had basically the same nucleus. 
</P>
<P>
"Winning four is not motivating me." 
</P>
<P>
Just two months ago, Walsh was ready to give up coaching. The 49ers were 6-5 
and rumors that he and DeBartolo were at odds had surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
"Ed really was frustrated after two straight losses. We blew a game to Phoenix 
that we led 23-0 and we were so flat we couldn't even play against the Raiders 
the next week. Ed was very upset. I was very upset. But never at each other. 
</P>
<P>
"After the Raiders game (a 9-3 loss), I could've told you what my plans were. 
They were easy." 
</P>
<P>
They might still be easy, but he isn't saying yet.

RACE CAR KILLS 2 SPECTATORS IN MONTE CARLO

<P>
Two people were killed and three others injured today when Italian driver 
Alessandro Fiorio's Lancia Integrale ran off the road into a ravine, hitting 
spectators at the 57th Monte Carlo Rally, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
Fiorio, 23, who finished third in last year's world championships, also had 
missed a turn Sunday, injuring two spectators by the roadway, but he was able 
to stay in the race. He and his co-driver, Luigi Pirollo, suffered bruises in 
today's crash and this time had to drop out. 
</P>
<P>
Neither could give any reason for the accident. 
</P>
<P>
One spectator was killed on the spot and another died later of head injuries in 
a hospital in Aubenas after being taken there by helicopter, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the injured were transported by ambulances. There was no immediate word 
on their conditions. The third was treated at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
The accident was the latest in a series at international auto rallies and 
renewed questions about security at such races. 
</P>
<P>
Rallies are run along thousands of miles of often winding roads, making crowd 
control difficult. In the Monte Carlo race there are ice, snow patches and 
moisture, and drivers race at maximum possible speeds against the clock, trying 
to save a few seconds and improve their positions.

NEBRASKA RECRUIT VICTOR STACHMUS DIES OF LEUKEMIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Victor Stachmus, 19, a Nebraska football scholarship winner last year, died 
early today at the UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles, where he was being 
treated for leukemia, a Nebraska football coach said. 
</P>
<P>
Stachmus, who was from McAlester, Okla., had been hospitalized for two weeks in 
the UCLA center for chemotherapy treatments. He had been transferred there from 
the M. D. Anderson Medical facility in Houston, where he had been receiving 
treatments since September. 
</P>
<P>
"Victor has shown a great amount of courage and was at peace with himself when 
he died," Nebraska coach Tom Osborne said. "It was a very tragic situation, but 
his spirit was high. It is unfortunate that he never did get to play at 
Nebraska, because it was something he really wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
Stachmus died at 1:30 a.m. PST, according to Nebraska assistant football coach 
Ron Brown. 
</P>
<P>
sh First Oklahoman to Sign 
</P>
<P>
Stachmus, who graduated from McAlester High School last spring, was the first 
Oklahoma high school recruit to sign a national letter of intent with Nebraska. 
He was admitted to St. Francis Hospital in Tulsa, Okla., last April, when it 
was discovered he had leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
After a month of hospitalization last spring, doctors said Stachmus' disease 
was in remission, and he planned to enroll at Nebraska this semester. 
</P>
<P>
A week ago, Stachmus received more than 1,600 cards and letters from Nebraska 
football fans who participated in a "Go Big Vic," campaign to let him know that 
Cornhusker fans still thought of him. 
</P>
<P>
"The Stachmus family and the coaching staff at the University of Nebraska would 
like to thank all the people for their cards and prayers during Victor's 
hospital stay," Osborne said. 
</P>
<P>
"His mother said Victor told her before he passed away that he was spiritually 
ready to die and that was a great comfort for the family," said Brown. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a very wonderful young man," said Allen Wadsworth, Stachmus' high 
school football coach and McAlester's athletic director.

GOVERNMENT SPENDING REDUCTION IS TOPIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Recommendations for cutting federal government spending, including the proposed 
elimination of some military bases in Southern California, will be discussed by 
the featured speaker at the Feb. 1 meeting of the World Affairs Council of 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
George S. Goldberger, president of Citizens Against Government Waste, will 
speak at the session, which begins at 7:30 p.m. at the Anaheim Marriott hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Goldberger served on the Grace Commission, a task force of 161 business 
executives who donated $75 million of their own or their corporations' money to 
make a long-term study of how to cut government waste. The organization 
Citizens Against Government Waste evolved from the commission. 
</P>
<P>
Among the Grace Commission's recommendations were the elimination of many 
military bases, including several in Southern California.

ENROLLMENT JUMPS 6.5% FOR FULLERTON COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fullerton College spring semester classes begin today with an enrollment of 
16,923 -- a 6.5% increase over last spring, according to college spokesman Al 
Busch. 
</P>
<P>
Busch said several factors account for the significant increase in students 
this semester. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been advertising and marketing the college," he said. "We also had class 
registration for our continuing students prior to Christmas break so that we 
could devote all our attention to new, incoming students in January. Also, we 
have been adding classes to the schedule to take care of students' needs."

EL MODENA STUDENTS PLAN BENEFIT FOR ALUMNA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
El Modena High School theater arts students are planning a fund-raising 
musical-variety show Saturday for a 1982 alumna who is burdened with "enormous 
hospital bills" because of the premature birth of her baby. 
</P>
<P>
"Ever since the premature birth of her baby, Brandon, Chariya (McGee), an 
alumna of El Modena, and her husband, Steve McGee, have been plagued with 
medical bills," said Andrea Menke, spokeswoman for the fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
Menke said Chariya McGee has helped with many theatrical and musical 
productions in Orange since graduating from El Modena High in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the musical variety show, the fund-raiser will also feature an 
all-you-can-eat dessert bar available at intermission. The $15-per-person 
ticket includes the show and dessert bar, Menke said. 
</P>
<P>
The event will start at 7:30 p.m. and be at El Modena High, 3920 Spring St. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets can be bought in advance through the El Modena High theater arts 
department or at the door. Information is available at (714) 998-4949.

HARNESSING HIS ENERGY;

<P>
NORMAN TRADES IN HIS TOUGH-GUY IMAGE FOR ROLE AS 2-SPORT STAR AT OCEAN VIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA CARTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Todd Norman, Ocean View High School's 6-foot 6-inch, 245-pound 
football-basketball player, was a not-so-little first-grader at Golden View 
Elementary School, he used his extra pounds to pound his smaller classmates. 
</P>
<P>
He tried channeling his aggressiveness into soccer, but the game was not 
physical enough. It seemed young Todd would get the urge to reach out and shove 
his opponents, which was against the rules. 
</P>
<P>
Then he found the sport that would change him from class bully to, by all 
accounts, a classy guy -- football. 
</P>
<P>
Norman, who plays inside linebacker and offensive guard, is being recruited for 
football by Notre Dame, USC and UCLA. He has basketball coaches sighing because 
he has made it clear he will be writing his name on a letter of intent to play 
on the fields, not the courts. 
</P>
<P>
But in elementary school, Norman was the type to do his writing on the 
blackboard, 100 times please. "I will not thump my classmates," or something 
like that. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole reason I started playing football is I tended to get a little 
physical with the other kids at recess," said Norman, grinning. 
</P>
<P>
"The honest truth is I used to be in the principal's office every other day. 
The little fat kid used to pick on all the scrawny kids." 
</P>
<P>
Norman was teased about his size but said that was not the only motivation for 
his bullying. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just an aggressive little kid. You could look at me wrong, call me a 
name, bump into me. . . . I was ornery. Kids would build something in the 
sandbox and I would want to come over and play, and they would say no, so I 
would just kick it over," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to call him 'our bull in the china closet,' " said his mother, Marcia 
Norman. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a hard time finding his identity on the street because the kids he grew 
up with were at least a year older -- however, he was physically bigger than 
most of them. I think (the aggression) was his way of letting them know, 'Hey 
I'm here.' " 
</P>
<P>
It did not help that there was no organized physical education during recess at 
his elementary school to help him deal with some of his youthful exuberance. 
</P>
<P>
Enter Junior All-American Football. Norman, then 8, found an outlet for his 
aggression. 
</P>
<P>
"For as much trouble as I got in as a little kid, since then, I haven't done 
anything," Norman said. "I have been a perfect little angel." Well, a big 
angel. 
</P>
<P>
Norman, in his senior year at Ocean View, has earned the respect of peers, 
coaches and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a super kid to be around," football Coach Guy Carrozzo said. "I think I 
would miss his personality whether he was as good as he was or was 
fourth-string for us. He is just a fun person to be around." 
</P>
<P>
Norman, 17, also has received compliments playing his second sport. He is the 
leading scorer on the Seahawks' basketball team, which is 13-7 overall, 3-2 in 
Sunset League play. He is the latest in a long line of outstanding post players 
at Ocean View, from Wayne Carlander to Jim Usevitch to Ricky Butler. 
</P>
<P>
"Every great post player I have has trained the next," Harris said. Butler 
trained Norman. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first couple of weeks, I thought all he was teaching me was lessons in 
humility, how to pick myself up off the floor, how to duck to miss elbows," 
said Norman, who is teaching the same lessons to 6-7 sophomore Marcel TenBerge. 
</P>
<P>
Norman has learned well. He ranks in the top 10 in scoring in the county, 
averaging 21.4 points. He is the county's third-leading rebounder with almost 
11 a game, and has made almost 67% of his shots. 
</P>
<P>
"He is just too strong and too mobile for his opponents," Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
Norman has grace uncharacteristic of a player his size, said Mater Dei Coach 
Gary McKnight, who has coached Norman on summer league teams. "For a kid his 
size and weight, he is extremely coordinated," McKnight said. "If a kid is that 
graceful on a basketball court, he is even that much more valuable on a 
football field. I can understand why (football) coaches are going after him." 
</P>
<P>
Harris and McKnight believe Norman could use his skills in a Division-I 
basketball program, but they know football is his future. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a very good player, but he is not a true basketball player," McKnight 
said. "He is a big rugged kid who is incredibly coordinated. He is not like a 
Carlander or a (Johnny) Rogers or a Matt Beeuwsaert or a LeRon Ellis. Here is a 
kid splitting his time and doing just a solid and great job." 
</P>
<P>
Said Harris, "As a basketball coach I would love to see him play basketball in 
college, but he may make money in football someday, so that is the way he is 
going to go." 
</P>
<P>
Football scouts seem to agree with his choice. 
</P>
<P>
"We think Todd Norman is one of the better linemen in the state of California," 
said Dick Lascola, owner of the Scouting Evaluation Assn., which provides 
scouting reports to some 90 universities nationwide, including USC, UCLA and 
Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the biggest assets he has is his lateral mobility. He has extremely 
quick feet. He is an aggressive kid and he has a lot of intensity. But the 
thing we were impressed with is his quickness off the football." 
</P>
<P>
Norman led his Ocean View team in tackles as a senior with 95 despite teams 
double- and triple-teaming and running away from him. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, he is one of the most dominant players I have ever coached or been 
around," Carrozzo said. "The physical mismatch created when he blocked or 
tackled somebody was pretty overwhelming." 
</P>
<P>
With all the success he has enjoyed, it would be easy for Norman to become a 
bit conceited, but he is not, according to his best friend, Greg Szuba. 
</P>
<P>
Szuba, a strong safety and tight end for Ocean View, played youth football with 
Norman and attended Hope View Elementary School and Mesa View Junior High 
School with him. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of his size, he is so intimidating, so he is kind of shy," Szuba said. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids who don't know him, sure they are intimidated. . . . Walking down the 
hallway, I'm sure there are little freshmen and sophomores who jump out of his 
way. . . . But once you get to know him, his nature is not intimidating at all. 
If you got to know him, you would know that he is a pussycat." 
</P>
<P>
He has come a long way from his days as a bully. 
</P>
<P>
"We really stress the kids showing class on the field and off," Carrozzo said. 
"Todd certainly embodies that. 
</P>
<P>
"If (Ocean View football) ever opened up an embassy somewhere, he would be the 
guy we would send because he would represent the school so well. He would also 
defend the embassy really well, too, because he is a pretty big guy."

LOS ALTOS COACH WEIGHS MOVE TO CENTURY HIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Tom Hamilton 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dwayne DeSpain, one of the most successful football coaches in Southern Section 
history, said he is interested in the coaching position at Century High School, 
scheduled to open in Santa Ana this fall. 
</P>
<P>
DeSpain, 49, won his seventh Southern Section title at Los Altos last season 
when his team defeated El Rancho, 12-0, for the Division IV title. DeSpain tied 
former Temple City Coach Bob Hitchcock for the most section football titles won 
in a career. 
</P>
<P>
Century High, at 1401 S. Grand Ave., will open with freshmen and sophomores in 
the fall. The new school will offer computer training and will be open to all 
students in the Santa Ana Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea of open enrollment is enticing," DeSpain said. "A new program is also 
attractive because you can surround yourself with good people. The only 
question would be at what (salary) step I could start in the district." 
</P>
<P>
DeSpain has won 10 league titles in 22 years at Los Altos, but he said that 
dwindling enrollment in the Hacienda Heights area has made it increasingly 
difficult to field strong teams. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, DeSpain applied for a vacant coaching job at Palm Springs High 
and was offered the position, but declined when district officials offered him 
a salary that would have meant taking a loss of nearly $20,000. DeSpain is more 
optimistic about the Century High position. 
</P>
<P>
DeSpain has developed some of the top prep quarterbacks in Southern California 
during his tenure at Los Altos, including Rob Hertel, Mike Smith, Dennis Smith 
and Dennis Sproul. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Arriola, principal at Century, began interviewing administrators for the 
new school last week and is completing interviews of teaching applicants. 
</P>
<P>
The odds of the Huntington Beach boys' basketball team leading the Sunset 
League appeared slim only a month ago when the Oilers concluded nonleague play 
with a 5-8 record. 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley, Ocean View, Marina and Edison were given a better chance of 
winning the 6-team league than Huntington Beach, which hadn't qualified for the 
playoffs since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
But Huntington Beach is tied with Fountain Valley for the league's top spot 
after the first round of play after defeating Fountain Valley, 71-61, Friday. 
It was the Oilers' fourth consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a combination of five players playing together as a unit," said Roy 
Miller, Huntington Beach coach. "There's no star player on the team, and 
they're finally starting to believe in themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Center Scott Drake has been instrumental in the Oilers' success, limiting 
Marina's Cherokee Parks to 12 points and Ocean View's Todd Norman to 9 points. 
</P>
<P>
Guard Andy Thompson has controlled the tempo the past 4 games and orchestrated 
the offense to the point where Miller said, "Andy is like a quarterback on the 
court. He's really come of age." 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach opened a 15-4 lead against Fountain Valley and never trailed. 
The Oilers also went wire-to-wire against Ocean View. The Oilers hadn't beaten 
either team in 6 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Winning goes in cycles," Miller said. "We had some lean years, now it's our 
turn. The players, teachers and myself are really enjoying this season." 
</P>
<P>
Playoff sites for the Southern Section's boys' and girls' basketball 
championship games have been established. The boys' 5-AA, 5-A, 3-A, 2-AA and 
2-A division games will be played at the Los Angeles Sports Arena on Saturday, 
March 4. The boys' 4-AA and 4-A championship games are scheduled for Wednesday, 
March 1, at UC Irvine's Bren Center. The girls' 5-AA, 5-A and 3-A division

REALTY WING WANTS A SHARE IN THE LAND OF THE TOUGH SELL

They are the battleships of the residential real estate industry: Century 21, 
based in Irvine; Denver's RE/MAX, the only national broker in the top three not 
based in the county; and Coldwell Banker, based in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Jerome M. Cole of Corona del Mar has worked for Coldwell Banker and Century 21. 
Now he is trying to strike pay dirt again, this time based in Costa Mesa and 
backed by the gigantic Prudential Insurance Co. of America. 
</P>
<P>
Prudential joins other giants -- Metropolitan Life, which owns Century 21, and 
Sears, which owns Coldwell Banker -- in selling franchises to local brokers. 
Not only is there the potential to make a lot of money in franchise and service 
fees, but the franchisers can also use their network of local brokers to sell 
home buyers other merchandise, from furniture to insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Cole, 54, didn't get into real estate until he was 29. He joined a San Fernando 
Valley company, which was bought by Coldwell Banker in the late 1960s. The firm 
became the base for Coldwell Banker's leap into residential real estate. 
</P>
<P>
Other acquaintances left the firm and set up in Santa Ana to sell franchises to 
brokers nationwide. They called the new company Century 21. 
</P>
<P>
Until 1987, Cole ran Coldwell Banker's franchising operation, which he had 
started and which existed alongside the company's own network of residential 
brokers. 
</P>
<P>
While still at Coldwell, Cole said, he talked Prudential, the insurance giant 
based in Newark, N.J., into starting its own franchising program. 
</P>
<P>
Prudential unveiled its new subsidiary, Prudential Real Estate Affiliates Inc., 
in 1987, with Cole as president. 
</P>
<P>
But it is a tough market, and other franchisers have already swept up the easy 
pickings, leaving many brokerages that will be tough sells. And franchised 
brokerages' share of the real estate business is shrinking, from a 21% peak in 
1981 to 15% last year. 
</P>
<P>
Cole talked recently with Times Staff Writer Michael Flagg about 1988 -- the 
company's first full year of operation -- and the outlook for 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Let's start with nuts and bolts. How does Prudential's franchising program 
work? 
</P>
<P>
A. There's a franchise fee at the front end (charged a local brokerage). We 
have a sliding scale, with the main office the most expensive at $22,000 and 
decreasing for branch offices, down to a low of $8,000. As part of the deal, 
they must have our computer system, which we give them, and they must use it. 
They also get training, help in recruiting and advertising. There's also a 
sliding scale for the ongoing service fee they pay us, which starts at 6% and 
-- depending on how much business the broker does -- can work its way down to 
3%. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Is that competitive with other franchises? 
</P>
<P>
A. To my knowledge, only we and Coldwell Banker -- which did it to be 
competitive with us -- have a sliding scale. That makes it more feasible for a 
large, highly successful brokerage to justify joining a franchise program. And 
we give them about $10,000 worth of computer software and hardware. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How has the first year gone? 
</P>
<P>
A. We brought aboard our first franchisees in May. We're currently at 209 
offices, which is probably as successful a start as anybody's ever had, if not 
the most successful. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Isn't that quite a bit less than you predicted you would have? 
</P>
<P>
A. The goal was to have 300 at the end of our first fiscal year (which ends 
March 30). We're probably a touch behind schedule, not because we couldn't sell 
franchises but because we spend so much time qualifying people, getting 
financial statements and doing background checks, and it's a slower process 
than we had anticipated. We've probably received checks and applications from 
two or three times as many brokers as we have on board, but our direction is to 
maintain a high quality. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What happens this year? 
</P>
<P>
A. This year is the more critical year. I think we got off to a very 
respectable start last year. This thing is the largest undertaking that's ever 
been done in this business from scratch. The question isn't whether we're going 
to succeed. The question is how long it's going to take us. The goal is 5 
years. It might take 6 or 7 years. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What happens in 5 years? Are you still planning to be be first or second in 
the industry in revenues and have 3,500 offices, as you said last year? Or is 
that not a realistic goal anymore? 
</P>
<P>
A. I really try to avoid the 3,500 number. I feel 3,000 in that period is a 
realistic number. I think 3,500 is possible, but maybe not in 5 years. It may 
take longer because of the quality factor, and there's another reason too: In a 
really hot real estate market, a lot of the bigger, better brokers don't feel 
they need a franchise. It's been proven time and time again that in a bad 
market, franchise sales are much better. 
</P>
<P>
Q. When do you turn a profit? 
</P>
<P>
A. Probably in another year. It usually takes a couple of years to turn it 
around. This is a major investment. Prudential pulled out the stops. They put 
aside $40 million to get this program off the ground. Considering we started 
the Coldwell Banker program at $2 million, you can see the degree of the 
commitment. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Why does it take so long to decide who you want in the franchise program? 
How do you qualify them? 
</P>
<P>
A. We get 3 years' financials on them that the accountants have to fill out. We 
get personal income tax returns from them. They must be among the leading firms 
in their area, both in market share and in reputation. They must be financially 
stable. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Are there many out there that are not stable? 
</P>
<P>
A. You'd be amazed at the number of real estate companies that appear to be 
very successful, but underneath it all they're really just hanging on. It's a 
business that's been forced to get more aggressive in commission splits as 
companies try to keep their top sales people. The sales population is fairly 
fickle; they get a better deal down the street and they're gone. As a result, 
there's a commission war, not publicly but in house. 
</P>
<P>
It's caused a lot of brokers to be operating without enough revenues to sustain 
themselves. That's another reason why they need these strong franchise 
relationships; it'll help them recruit and maintain top people. If all a broker 
has to offer is a better commission split, he's going to go down the drain. 
With so many of them -- it's incredible -- they've been driven to give a 
greater percentage than they can afford to give away. A lot of them are losing 
money. This is what we're running into out there. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Given that the housing market has been pretty hot the last few years, surely 
things can't be all that tough? 
</P>
<P>
A. What the companies really need is a more realistic split with their 
salespeople. That's the prime problem most of them have today. Theoretically, 
the perfect split is 50-50. But 60-40, with 60% going to the salesman, has 
become more of a normal split. In the more aggressive, competitive markets, 
brokers have gone to a 70-30 split. All this happened in the last 5 years. That 
kind of a split can be disastrous, because the bills for the owner often amount 
to 30% of what the company takes in. A lot of this is due to the RE/MAX 
concept, where the owner is like a landlord, and the broker pays him a fixed 
number of bucks and keeps the rest. 
</P>
<P>
Q. But, after all, you are in the business of selling franchises. Why not just 
take a chance on anybody who wants one? 
</P>
<P>
A. We don't make money on the up-front franchise fees, they cost us money. We 
make money down the line with the service fees, depending on how much business 
the franchisee does. And we don't want companies -- I don't care how great they 
look or how great their reputations -- if the first time we have an economic 
downturn or another real estate down cycle, they go belly up on us. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Are there any good companies left? Or have they all been snapped up by your 
competitors? 
</P>
<P>
A. There has been a very strong consolidation of real estate companies. Where 
there used to be a three-tiered market -- the big guys, middle guys and the 
little guys -- the middle guys are disappearing fast. The big guys are the 
Coldwell Bankers and the big local brokers -- the three or four local companies 
that are huge, with as many as 200 offices. They're the reason the other guys 
join franchises: to compete. 
</P>
<P>
The middle guy is the hardest hit. The little guy can still make it as kind of 
a boutique guy. He's got his own little niche. He's got his own little 
neighborhood where he knows everybody and he does okay, he makes a living. It's 
the middle guy who's neither fish nor fowl. He's big enough to have a massive 
overhead, a lot of sales people, and he's got to try and compete against the 
big guys. He's got to advertise, train people, all the things the big guy does, 
just in order to maintain his 10 offices. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line is that the middle tier is getting thinner and thinner. They're 
still there, but there are not as many as there used to be. And they're really 
our market. Somebody who's got 200 offices isn't going to join a franchise. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Does this trend toward consolidation worry you at all? What about the 
possibility that it might make the industry a lot less competitive and mean the 
consumer could get shortchanged down the line? 
</P>
<P>
A. It's not just our business. Consolidation is happening in every industry. 
But in real estate it's highly illegal for one real estate company to even talk 
to another company about what they're going to charge home buyers. You can go 
to jail for that. So the commission is set by what the market will bear. 6% is 
kind of the going rate. The reality of it is, if you charge less than that 
you're probably going to go out of business. It takes that kind of a commission 
just to pay the bills and pay salespeople and do all the things you have to do. 
</P>
<P>
If somebody tries to go to 7%, people who are selling their homes probably 
won't want to list with them. Everybody would have to go to 7% together, and 
the minute that happens Uncle Sam is going to be all over the place trying to 
find out why. So that isn't likely. Actually, in order to become more 
profitable and viable, the companies almost need a 7% commission. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Speaking of commissions, are you finding a lot of competition from the 
discount brokers and sell-your-own-home folks? 
</P>
<P>
A. None of them have been successful. They've happened before, they'll happen 
again. I see them as a flash-in-the-pan thing. They make a little noise and 
then they disappear. None of them has ever been a serious threat. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How do you find franchisees and get them to come aboard? 
</P>
<P>
A. There are two secrets to this business that give you an edge: One is you 
don't have to worry about selling a franchise in order to pay the bills. 
Whenever your sole source of income is selling franchises, you lose your 
ability to go after the top guy in a market and stick to your guns until you 
get him. Because the pressure of making payroll comes looming up on you, and 
there comes a point when you say: "I can't get No. 1, I can't get No. 2, and 
the payroll's due. I'll take No. 8 because we have to pay some bills." And once 
you take No. 8, you can't get No. 1, because he won't join a program that's got 
No. 8 in it. 
</P>
<P>
The other thing is that when you come into the business without any 
credibility, you're just a concept. That's a hard sell. But when you're 
somebody like Coldwell Banker, and you already have hundreds of offices, you're 
renowned. You can say: "Hey, we want to franchise you, we can give you programs 
that will make you more profitable." That's saleable. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What was behind Prudential's decision to start a franchise network from 
scratch rather than just buy one? Were they turned off by their experience with 
trying to buy Century 21, when they were outbid by Metropolitan Life? 
</P>
<P>
A. Prudential -- among many others -- made offers to buy Century 21. It kindled 
their interest in getting into the real estate business. They looked around the 
market to see what else might be available, and there was nothing else that 
they felt made sense economically or quality-wise or whatever -- I wasn't party 
to it. So they just shut the door and walked away. 
</P>
<P>
One of the possibilities was to go out and start buying individual companies in 
a major acquisition program, similar to Merrill Lynch or Coldwell Banker, which 
are the two prime examples of companies built primarily through acquisition. If 
you look at both those companies, what you see is the expenditure of millions 
of dollars and to date not a particularly outstanding return on those 
investments. And so that approach has not proven to be a real strong way of 
getting into the real estate business. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Because you have to put up so much money up front? 
</P>
<P>
A. You have to do two things: You have to put up enormous amounts of money, and 
it takes forever. It's a long, slow process. It creates enormous management 
problems, because you're buying all these entrepreneurial types of people, and 
the strength of what you're buying is that they were successful entrepreneurs, 
and you try to incorporate them into some big national thing. And they don't 
fit real well. They're difficult folks to handle. 
</P>
<P>
Q. So these companies have tended to have problems? 
</P>
<P>
A. Merrill Lynch apparently didn't do a very good job, because the top 
management they bought ended up leaving them within a short period of time. 
They tried to impose very strict regulations on these entrepreneurial people, 
and those people said "adios." 
</P>
<P>
Coldwell Banker, on the other hand, worked out some attractive earn-out 
opportunities for these folks, and in almost all cases they stuck around for 
many years. Despite that, neither company has shown any great profitability. 
</P>
<P>
Q. So you talked Prudential into a franchise operation instead of acquiring 
brokerages? 
</P>
<P>
A. Franchising is a much more successful way of entering the business, of 
expanding rapidly, and of getting the market share that you're looking to get. 
Look at Century 21; in a relatively few short years, they got up to 10% or 11% 
of the national market starting from scratch, even though they were 
tremendously underfinanced. It was not a company built on millions of dollars. 
It was a company built on dreams. I was one of the original vice presidents of 
Century 21, so I know the whole story.

CITY, CATHEDRAL STILL SPLIT OVER ENTERTAINMENT TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK I. PINSKY, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Garden Grove and the Crystal Cathedral remain at odds over whether 
the city can tax large-scale stage productions such as "The Glory of Christmas" 
and "The Glory of Easter" to help finance the arts. 
</P>
<P>
A 15-member Blue Ribbon Committee on the Arts, appointed by the City Council, 
is recommending that the council consider a tax on live, commercial 
entertainment in halls with more than 500 seats. The two religious pageants, 
held in the 3,000-seat Crystal Cathedral, are not mentioned by name in the 
report, but according to one panel member they were among the events under 
discussion. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Todd, attorney for the Crystal Cathedral, said the State Board of 
Equalization has ruled that the "Glories"' have religious significance. Because 
"religious significance constitutes a form of worship, the state board held it 
was appropriate for the Crystal Cathedral to conduct the pageants on its 
property and remain tax exempt," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The question for both the arts committee and the City Council, according to 
John Bushman, spokesman for the city, is whether the pageants -- which charge 
between $14 and $25 per seat -- are commercial. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's exactly what they're going to look into," Bushman said, 
"whether they would meet our criteria for a commercial enterprise for purposes 
of entertainment." 
</P>
<P>
Even if the city decides that the pageants are commercial, Bush said, taxation 
is only "a possibility. That doesn't mean we would tax them. . . . We're 
looking at step one in an involved process. . . . If they jump to the 
conclusion that this is a tax on the Crystal Cathedral, they're off base." 
</P>
<P>
The committee's report is expected to be presented to the City Council early 
next month.
