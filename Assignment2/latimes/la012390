Police seized two U.S. citizens who tried to make off with a 37-ton meteorite 
that has become a landmark of northern Argentina, a newspaper reported. La 
Nacion said that Jeffrey W. Smith, 31, and Robert Hagg, 33, both of Tucson, 
Ariz., were detained after police -- told by residents that the meteorite was 
missing -- became suspicious of a small convoy that included a heavy truck with 
a winch.

ETHICS FIGHT GOES TO THE PEOPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The debate last week on the proposed City of Los Angeles Ethics Act was 
unfortunate and disappointing not only because of its result but also because 
of its tone and style. 
</P>
<P>
As drafted by an independent commission of distinguished private citizens named 
by Mayor Tom Bradley, and agreed to in a slightly revised form by the City 
Council's own ad hoc ethics committee, the proposal would have put before the 
people of Los Angeles council-crafted charter amendments giving the city tough 
new conflict-of-interest regulations and partial public financing of political 
campaigns. Together, these steps would have put Los Angeles in the vanguard of 
a burgeoning political reform movement that already has enacted such ordinances 
in cities like Seattle and New York. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the council majority's decision to kill public financing and to 
subject what remained of the proposal to more than 50 amendments left the 
ethics act, in the apt description of Councilman Michael Woo, "gutted." Almost 
as regrettable was the council's rather mean-spirited discussion of the issue 
and its elimination of public financing through an act of parliamentary sleight 
of hand that protected the majority from having to declare itself in a simple 
"yes-no" vote. These actions introduced a new rancor and furtiveness into a 
process heretofore characterized by openness, conciliation and constructive 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
A quick summary of what the council did gives a flavor of the process: It 
rejected public financing of campaigns; deprived the proposed city ethics 
commission of fiscal independence of the council; narrowed the circumstances in 
which a special prosecutor could be appointed, and generally weakened 
prohibitions against gifts, honorariums and outside income. On the other hand, 
the majority did vote to place on the ballot a charter amendment raising 
council members' pay; it imposed new financial disclosure rules on private 
citizens seeking to recall incumbent council members, and it voted to extend 
its authority over eight city departments, commissions and boards that are 
currently protected against council intervention. 
</P>
<P>
When the Ethics Act was put before the council last week, the issue was clear 
enough: Either the lawmakers could restore city government to a basic integrity 
people could rely on, or the people would have to do it themselves through the 
initiative process. Members of the mayor's ethics commission are now drafting a 
proposal that will put the key provisions of the original Ethics Act, including 
public financing of campaigns, before the voters in November. 
</P>
<P>
The situation created by the council's failure in this matter is precisely what 
the initiative process was designed to redress. Some questions of governance 
simply are too important to be left to government to decide. The integrity of 
the political process itself is one of them. Since the council has declined to 
put self-interest aside, the people of Los Angeles have no choice but to make 
the cause of ethical reform their own.

LOS ANGELIZATION OF CENTRAL COAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Having grown up in Los Angeles during the 1950s, having lived in Santa Maria 
attending Cal Poly at San Luis Obispo during the 1960s, and having resided in 
San Diego County for the last 18 years, I am wondering if that makes one a 
quasi-expert on the "Los Angelization" of the entire California coast? 
</P>
<P>
There certainly has been a massive movement out of Los Angeles, both north and 
south. 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere more than San Diego County can this mass migration of Angelenos be 
found. San Diego, formerly a sleepy little Navy town, having more in common 
with Tijuana than Los Angeles, has dedicated itself to imitating its neighbor 
to the north with accelerated yuppie fervor. Within a decade there should be no 
more open land in San Diego. Within three decades decay should be setting in as 
is happening in beautiful Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Now we read in your paper that Los Angelization is moving north into San Luis 
Obispo County -- it certainly was inevitable (Part A, Jan. 7). Where else could 
it go? It's too wet to the west, too dry to the east, and San Diego County has 
already prostituted itself to the south. But still untouched is beautiful, 
pastoral, quaint San Luis Obispo. Remember the old ad "Come North for the Slo"? 
Times aren't changing "slo," they're changing rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
Since I have also lived and traveled extensively in Northern California (I mean 
the real north), I think I will just keep my memories and experiences to 
myself. God forbid the "sophisticated" hordes from Los Angeles venture farther 
than 200-300 miles from home.

ACCOUNTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All the financial reporting in the news these days makes me wish I had gone 
into show business. However, I chose accounting for my life's work because it 
was so logical and made such good sense. 
</P>
<P>
I clearly remember, in 1946, my tough professor at Woodbury College (now 
University) stressing never to anticipate any income but always to provide for 
all expense. 
</P>
<P>
Now, accounting gimmicks and legerdemain are used to mask the federal deficit, 
make junk bonds look good, mislead investors in savings and loans and a myriad 
of other financial matters. It appears there is as much fiction in the business 
section of the paper as there is in the entertainment section. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back, I wonder how I might have done writing novels and screenplays. I 
think I could have been a contender.

THE FLOW OF COMBAT NEWS WAS A STRANGLED TRICKLE; 
</P>
<P>
MEDIA: THE SEQUESTERING OF REPORTERS AFTER THE PANAMA INVASION PROVES THE 
PENTAGON'S OPENNESS TO COVERAGE A SHAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARTHUR A. LORD, Arthur A. Lord is a producer for NBC News in Burbank and a 
former Air Force public-affairs officer. He was in Panama after the invasion 
and again from Jan. 4-14. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two hours before U.S. troops began their combat assault in Panama, 16 reporters 
and photographers lifted off from Andrews Air Force Base aboard an Air Force 
C-141. Their mission was to cover the fighting and to share with all media 
their reports, photographs and video of this historic event in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
The concept of a press pool to cover such military operations was conceived 
after the 1983 invasion of Grenada, during which the news media were completely 
and apparently deliberately frozen out. A Pentagon commission concluded that 
prohibiting press coverage in Grenada was improper and recommended that in 
future combat situations, military commanders should make provisions for at 
least a small pool of journalists to witness, record and document the action. 
The commission's report was adopted as official Pentagon policy. 
</P>
<P>
Now the combat phase of Operation Just Cause is over and it can be said with 
certainty that the policy is being ignored. The Pentagon is not living up to 
its agreement with the American media or, by extension, the American people and 
their right to know. 
</P>
<P>
As pool television correspondent Fred Francis said in his after-action report, 
"The pool was repeatedly denied or ignored when it asked for access to 
front-line troops, wounded soldiers -- simple interviews." Denied access to the 
combat area, the pool was virtually sequestered at the Quarry Heights military 
facility during the first 36 hours of fighting. Less than two miles from Quarry 
Heights, American soldiers were moving in on Noriega's headquarters, which was 
ablaze. When pool members asked to go there, they were told that it was "too 
dangerous." When Francis tried to interview an Army major general whose 
paratroops had seized the international airport, the officer said, "Sorry, my 
operational orders are that I cannot let you talk with any of my men. I can't 
speak with you." 
</P>
<P>
The press pool did not produce one eyewitness account, one still picture or 
even 10 seconds of television video that showed how American forces 
successfully completed their mission. 
</P>
<P>
The day after the invasion began, the Pentagon, apparently thinking the 
situation was "well in hand," authorized the press to charter an L-1011 to fly 
169 more journalists, including me, and about 25,000 pounds of electronic gear 
into Howard Air Force Base. We were greeted by a wide-eyed master sergeant, 
apparently astounded by the size of our contingent, who explained that we would 
not be allowed into Panama City because roving gangs of Noriega's "Dignity 
Battalions" were still at large, certainly a legitimate reason. But if the 
situation was not under control, why was the trip authorized? 
</P>
<P>
For two days we were uncomfortably locked up in a recreation center on the air 
base. Finally, the military said the influx of journalists was too much to 
handle and most of us were airlifted back to the United States with nothing to 
show for the trip. 
</P>
<P>
There is official documentation of Operation Just Cause, but even that is 
currently being withheld. Defense Department combat photographers were allowed 
to go along with the invasion force, but according to Robert Hall, an aide to 
Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, the combat photography is "for internal use." 
</P>
<P>
What kind of a public information policy is this? Just Cause was the biggest 
military operation since Vietnam, conducted in a country where the United 
States government has had a considerable presence since the digging of the 
Panama Canal. Some within the press ranks believe there is a deliberate policy 
-- that the Bush Administration wants to manage the news and that the Pentagon 
views the press as hostile. I'm not sure. But either through official design or 
incredible ineptitude, the American press was not allowed to do its job. The 
traditional eyewitnesses to history were blindfolded and a free society was not 
well served.

A CAUTIONARY TALE OF RAISED EXPECTATIONS; 
</P>
<P>
DEMOCRACY: A LESSON LEARNED IN THE PHILIPPINES IS INSTRUCTIVE FOR EASTERN 
EUROPE: THERE'S NO QUICK FIX, THE ROAD IS ROCKY AND THE REVIEWS ARE NASTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE NATIVIDAD, Irene Natividad is a Filipina-American who is the immediate 
past chair of the National Women's Political Caucus. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Corazon Aquino of the Philippines and Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia have a lot 
in common. 
</P>
<P>
Both are "citizen presidents" catapulted reluctantly to power by the masses. 
Untainted and untrained, they are referred to as "just a housewife" and "just a 
playwright." For each of their countries, Aquino and Havel have symbolic 
importance beyond the significant roles thrust upon them. They embody their 
peoples' hope for a new order that is "clean," inclusive and prosperous. To 
realize that hope, they face impossible challenges that would daunt more 
seasoned politicians. Yet produce they must. 
</P>
<P>
Four years hence, will Havel too be called "weak" and "indecisive" if 
Czechoslovakia is not yet a thriving democracy? Those are the adjectives used 
to define Aquino's seeming inability to turn around 20 years of damage in the 
four years that she has been in charge. In a speech to an American audience, 
she addressed these criticisms directly: "I think they wanted a calvary officer 
and not a President because people kept urging me to be more impetuous. I was 
surprised at the premium men, especially, put on recklessness." 
</P>
<P>
In this simple statement, Aquino capsulized the dilemma that not only she 
encounters daily, but also Havel and the new leaders of Eastern European 
democracies. How does one lead a people accustomed to strongman techniques and 
get them to respond positively to the different leadership styles and 
strategies that nurturing democracies need to succeed? 
</P>
<P>
The rapid tumble of dictatorships and one-party rule this past holiday season 
generated a euphoria that obscures the rough times ahead. For these fledgling 
democracies, the Philippines stands as a cautionary tale. 
</P>
<P>
The founding mother of "people power," Aquino also rode an international crest 
of good will that created unreal expectations from the start. Seeing how 
swiftly the Marcos regime had fallen, most Filipinos anticipated a rapid change 
in the quality of their lives. Although Eastern Europeans seem to have a 
clearer understanding of the financial crisis they are facing, there is 
nonetheless a palpable expectation that things will be different -- right away. 
</P>
<P>
What they may not realize and what Filipinos did not anticipate is the rough 
and painful road to national reconstruction. Ferdinand Marcos' legacy was a 
nation on the brink of financial ruin, epitomized by a $29-billion foreign 
debt. Worse, economic deterioration was accompanied by the subversion and 
corruption of the country's institutions. "Getting around the system" had 
become a way of life for most Filipinos. 
</P>
<P>
For Eastern Europeans, the economic and social legacy of their ousted leaders 
is similar to the one left by Marcos. Furthermore, Eastern Europeans share with 
their Asian counterparts a potential clash between their desire for change and 
the habits of old. 
</P>
<P>
This is the past that must be acknowledged in any assessment of Aquino, Havel 
and other Eastern European leaders. Initial changes will take place in each of 
their countries. Aquino, for instance, has restored all democratic processes 
and institutions, passed a new constitution, held elections, resumed payments 
on Philippine foreign debt and encouraged enough foreign investment so that her 
country has been able to post a modest 5% to 6% economic growth rate. Not bad 
for a leader often perceived as a cup half full, either by virtue of her gender 
or lack of government experience. 
</P>
<P>
But these accomplishments may not mean much to Filipinos who saw democracy as 
more loose change in their pockets. Bewildered by the cacophony of unbridled 
democracy, denied the economic quick fix they desired and not recognizing the 
burdens imposed by their nation's past, some Filipinos are now hankering for 
the simplicity of imposed order embodied in the tantalizing idea of a military 
junta. External discipline is easier than the internal discipline needed to 
make democracy work. 
</P>
<P>
The Philippine story is not yet complete and no one should underestimate the 
staying power of Aquino or the commitment of Filipinos to democracy. However, 
the cycle it has undergone to date is likely to be the same pattern (with 
varying gradations) that may be followed by the newly forming democracies of 
Eastern Europe. These nations will be led by men and women unschooled in the 
basic business of running a government. They learn as they rule, and the 
swiftness of events as well as the national impatience that accompanies major 
upheavals will not allow them the luxury of time they need to develop. Some may 
escape the vilification of their constituents, but more than likely they will 
be buffeted by the different factions that emerge with every incipient 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
The rigors imposed by measures needed to bring about economic recovery will tax 
the commitment of each citizen to democratic processes. Long-range goals don't 
fulfill short-range hunger. In some instances, a yearning for the old order may 
crystallize into a military resurgence or a revitalized Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
A grim scenario -- or is it the necessary voyage of evolving democracies? Will 
Vaclav Havel and Corazon Aquino successfully steer their countries away from 
this historic U-turn? Let's hope so. In the meantime, judgment should be 
withheld by all democracy-watchers eager to play Monday-morning quarterback 
after any setback. For there will be many such reversals. After all, it is 
easier to win democracy than to run it.

Here is what passes for an explanation in the West: There has always been 
animosity between the Muslim Azeris and the Christian Armenians. Until 
recently, however, they have been kept from each other's throats by the strong 
arm of Moscow. Now, as Mikhail Gorbachev allows greater freedom, the old ethnic 
and religious tensions break into the open. Hence the bloodshed, a tragic 
consequence of perestroika proceeding too fast and maybe too far. 
</P>
<P>
The implications of this view are obvious. Nationalism is an evil genie from 
the past that can wreck reform in the present. Perestroika cannot fall prey to 
such an atavistic passion. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, this explanation is far from the mark. It reduces both Azeris 
and Armenians to the level of irrational hotheads. It ignores the fact that 
each party to the dispute has urgent and legitimate complaints -- not just 
against each other, but against Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
And it treats Gorbachev and perestroika as innocent victims, whereas in reality 
they are the immediate cause of the strife. Finally, it recasts what is 
actually a crisis of imperial policy into a more local problem of inter-ethnic 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
What are the Armenians' complaints against Moscow? They are quick to remind 
anyone who will listen that Gorbachev at first jailed members of the Armenian 
committee formed to raise the Nagorno-Karabakh issue. Communists in Yerevan 
point out that Gorbachev then did a flip-flop, freeing the Nagorno-Karabakh 
Committee and proceeding to negotiate with it over the head of their party. 
Even then Moscow refused to accede to the will of the Armenian majority in 
Nagorno-Karabakh, placing the region instead under the control of a special 
committee from Moscow. In yet another volte-face, Gorbachev then abolished this 
committee and returned the region to the control of Azerbaijan, thus tilting 
toward the Muslims. This caused hundreds of thousands of Armenians to flee 
their Azerbaijan homes. Meanwhile, every Armenian knows that Gorbachev took a 
week to get to Armenia after the devastating earthquake there, and that his 
lieutenants have still failed to deliver much of the emergency relief aid 
Moscow promised. And even before this, actions by Moscow ministries had 
inflicted grave damage on Armenia's ancient treasures and its environment. 
</P>
<P>
What are the Azeris' complaints? The Caspian coast was once rich in oil. In 
recent years these fields have been depleted, throwing hundreds of thousands of 
Azeris out of work. Short of labor elsewhere in the Soviet Union, Moscow 
commandeered thousands of unemployed Azeris to work in the new oil fields of 
Western Siberia. There, they were exposed to a hostile climate and attacks from 
Russian bigots. Meanwhile, unemployment continued to soar back home. Peasants 
trudged into Baku in search of food and work but found neither. Huddled into 
vast slum districts, these immigrants finally exploded in anger. Nor could 
local leaders have prevented this. They had little voice in the Kremlin since 
Gorbachev sacked the last Azeri politician prominent in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
This, then, is the background to the tragic blood bath of recent weeks. Call 
the Armenians and Azeris ethnic hotheads if you will. But both have been driven 
to this state, not merely by the others' actions but by policies emanating from 
Moscow. The brutality of Red Army and Interior Ministry troops toward both 
groups further implicates the central government. 
</P>
<P>
What, then, should be done? The presence of Soviet troops may bring temporary 
relief. But without further and more basic measures, the crisis will only 
deepen. The only way out is for Gorbachev to begin treating the problem in the 
Caucasus for what it is, a visceral and primitive response to the way Russians 
have ruled their empire. 
</P>
<P>
Is it naive to think that this might happen? Given the mounting extremism on 
all sides, is there any process by which a settlement can be reached among 
Moscow, Yerevan and Baku? There is. The Inter-Regional Group is a faction 
within the Soviet Congress of Peoples' Deputies founded by the late Andrei 
Sakharov and others. It has called for the creation of regional commissions 
throughout the Soviet Union, which would be responsible for negotiating new 
relationships among the republics, and between the republics and Moscow. 
Gorbachev should convene such a commission for Azerbaijan and Armenia at once. 
The local congresses should be represented, as should the Communist parties of 
the republics, as well as the popular-front-type independent groups. 
</P>
<P>
These negotiations could result in a very different set of relations than now 
exists. They would almost certainly require Moscow to make both economic and 
political concessions to the republics that have, until now, been unthinkable. 
But only such a process can address the issues of imperial policy underlying 
all the violence and save the region from further bloodshed.

MOSCOW FEARS IT WILL HEAR, 'BURN, BABY, BURN'; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: CIVIL-WAR SCENARIOS ARE ON EVERYONE'S LIPS AS THE COUNTRY'S 
IMPROVERISHMENT GROWS WORSE AND HOPES DECLINE.

<P>
The mysterious "great fear" that preceded the French Revolution -- that season 
of hysterical gatherings and sudden outbreaks of random violence -- has 
intrigued historians ever since. The latest theory blames ergot poisoning of 
the rye crop, among whose symptoms is the sort of temporary madness that sprang 
up that fateful summer in 1789. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of rye bread is eaten in the Soviet Union, but the ergot fungus is 
unlikely to be the cause of the new great fear that now grips the country. From 
a high-ranking officer of the internal-security force whom I met on the 
Moscow-Leningrad night train, from senior Moscow officials who may have been 
speaking for effect and from Leningrad industrial managers who were plainly 
saying only what they thought, I heard the same message: 
</P>
<P>
"With us, it will end as in Romania, or in another Tien An Men." "There will be 
blood in the streets." "When the rioting starts, it will be catastrophic." "The 
civil war has already started in the Caucasus; it can spread to Russia at any 
time." 
</P>
<P>
When I asked my acquaintances to explain their fears, they began by citing the 
dramatic impoverishment of the population, except for the "speculators, 
exploiting cooperators, smugglers and Mafiosi" (they use the Italian word) 
created by perestroika. Moscow has been printing money non-stop, and because 
supplies have not increased, prices have shot up. In a country where the median 
old-age pension is 84 rubles a month, and where 300 rubles amounts to a good 
monthly salary, last week's price in Leningrad shops for a small chicken (no 
other fresh meat was in sight) was 20 rubles; a kilo of apples (the only fruit 
on sale) costs 5. Nobody need starve, but this winter in Leningrad, many must 
survive on bread and cabbage (there is a potato shortage). 
</P>
<P>
Poverty does not cause riots. Impoverishment does. But even impoverishment is 
tolerable if there is hope of better days ahead. There appears to be no such 
hope in the Soviet Union. Of dozens of industrialists whom I met, not one 
believed that current economic reforms might succeed. The most visible results 
of perestroika, the "cooperative" restaurants and shops much celebrated in the 
West, were said to divert rather than increase production, thereby aggravating 
shortages in state shops. They, in turn, sell their "stolen goods" at vast 
profit. The cooperatives, I was told, are "outside civilization," their owners 
-- some of whom can afford a black-market Mercedes (100,000 rubles) -- no 
better than Mafiosi. 
</P>
<P>
Other offspring of perestroika -- new "self-financing" management rules, joint 
ventures with Western companies -- inspire no hope, either. Even the Leningrad 
managers who understand the complicated new rules argue that the "wooden" (i.e. 
grossly inflated) ruble has made a mockery of self-financing. Most joint 
ventures remain on paper, since Western partners cannot obtain guarantees that 
they can repatriate future profits in hard currency. 
</P>
<P>
In light of this bitter hopelessness, the civil-war scenarios on everyone's 
lips no longer seem unrealistic. Food and vodka riots are already frequent, but 
they remain locally confined. Even the miners' strike did not go beyond the 
coal basins of the eastern Ukraine and Siberia. But any event with nationwide 
implications, I was told, would bring out rioters in all cities and towns 
simultaneously, forming a full-scale insurrection. It would escalate into a 
civil war if Soviet security forces resisted. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the great fear may serve to secure Mikhail S. Gorbachev's position 
in the Politburo and Central Committee, because his removal would be precisely 
the sort of precipitating event that might lead to civil war. As one Leningrad 
manager put it: "Our workers hate Gorbachev's policies, but if the 
intelligentsia goes into the streets to protest his removal, they will join in 
to loot and burn." 
</P>
<P>
No wonder, then, that the liberalizing wave that has swept Eastern Europe has 
aroused so little comment in the Soviet Union. The great fear makes even those 
momentous events seem trivial.

VALLEY EARNINGS: TRADITIONAL INDUSTRIES POSTS $2.72 MILLION LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Traditional Industries posted a $2.72-million loss for its fiscal year that 
ended June 30, largely because of costs related to the company's settlement of 
a dispute with the Federal Trade Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The Agoura Hills concern, which sells photographic supplies directly to 
consumers, earned $4.91 million the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
Its revenue in fiscal 1989 jumped 32%, to $62.3 million from $47.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, Traditional also said its bank lenders agreed to raise the 
company's credit lines by about 25%, to $25 million. The additional credit 
should enable Traditional to achieve a positive cash flow by June 30, the 
company said. 
</P>
<P>
Traditional is only now announcing its fiscal 1989 results because it took 
several months to figure out how much the FTC settlement, announced last 
summer, would cost the company. The cost totaled $2.7 million, which 
Traditional recorded as a one-time, pretax charge against its earnings for the 
fourth quarter of fiscal 1989, Traditional said. 
</P>
<P>
The FTC had alleged, among other things, that certain Traditional sales 
practices misled consumers about the services Traditional provides. In the 
settlement, Traditional agreed to cancel contracts with some customers, which 
contributed to the charge and the delay in tallying its fiscal 1989 results. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of Traditional's fourth-quarter figures will not be available until 
the company files its 10-K annual report with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, which Traditional expects to do within the next week.

ART BUCHWALD: MAKING NO BONES ABOUT FOREIGN POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART BUCHWALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An assistant secretary came into the State Department kitchen and said, "Old 
Mother Hubbard, we need 5 billion bones for East Germany." 
</P>
<P>
Mother Hubbard replied, "My cupboard is bare. Hungary cleaned me out last 
week." 
</P>
<P>
The secretary sounded grim. "Nation after nation is achieving independence, but 
they can't do it without bones. Have you looked carefully?" 
</P>
<P>
Mother Hubbard told him, "I know a bare shelf when I see one. If I were you, 
I'd inform the next country asking for bones that they are barking up the wrong 
tree." 
</P>
<P>
"We can't do that," the secretary said. "We've been telling the people of every 
enslaved country that if they break the chains that bind them, we will supply 
them with everything needed to become a democratic nation." 
</P>
<P>
"Look, I just store the bones. I don't make them. Before the White House tells 
Bulgaria to jump over to our side, they could at least check to see how many 
bones are left in the cupboard." 
</P>
<P>
The secretary became agitated, "What's going on today is bigger than a bread 
basket. We thought that only one country would liberate itself this year -- and 
perhaps another country would do the same next year. How could we have known 
that they would all torch their governments at the same time? If you don't have 
any bones in the cabinet, do you have anything that Romania can chew on?" 
</P>
<P>
Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard and opened the doors wide. "Do you see 
something that I don't? And why the pressure?" 
</P>
<P>
"Guess who's coming to dinner? Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia." 
</P>
<P>
"You're kidding." 
</P>
<P>
"And Chile." 
</P>
<P>
"Tell Chile to cool it -- at least until we find some bones for Panama. Why 
don't we just issue junk bonds to the liberated countries and charge it to 
Bloomingdale's?" 
</P>
<P>
An intern came in and announced, "Mr. Secretary, the Polish ambassador is out 
in the hall. He says that the President promised Lech Walesa 6 billion bones 
when he toasted him at the White House. He was wondering if he could have them 
now." 
</P>
<P>
The secretary responded, "I was there and the President promised no such thing. 
Why is it that every time some freedom fighters liberate themselves, they come 
to us for aid?" 
</P>
<P>
Mother Hubbard added, "Someone should tell Poland that knocking off communism 
does not guarantee them a Rose Garden. In any case, when it concerns bones, I'm 
not going to give any to El Salvador. Doesn't the President know that the 
cupboard is bare?" 
</P>
<P>
The secretary said, "He does and he doesn't. Every time we tell him we have no 
bones, he says, 'We would if we cut the capital gains tax.' " 
</P>
<P>
Mother Hubbard sounded upset, "Do you know what really gives me nightmares? I 
am so afraid that someday you will come into the kitchen and inform me that the 
Chinese have overthrown their leaders, and we have to give them bones." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see that happening soon," the assistant secretary assured her. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd trust you more, but you are the person who declared that the Berlin Wall 
would never come down," Mother Hubbard reminded him. 
</P>
<P>
"Can we talk about Central America?" the secretary asked. 
</P>
<P>
"We can talk about it as long as we don't have to give them any bones," Mother 
Hubbard declared. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to. None of those countries is going to come over to our side for 
peanuts."

YOUR BODY: ANNUAL VIRUS HITTING KIDS HARD AND EARLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A virus that leaves most adults with just a bad cold has sent hundreds of 
children to doctor's offices and hospitals around Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, "comes around every winter," says Dr. 
Harris R. Stutman, director of pediatric infectious diseases at Memorial Miller 
Children's Hospital in Long Beach. "But this year it's very early and it's much 
more common, with about two times as many kids hospitalized as last year." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Shirley Fannin, associate deputy director of communicable disease control 
programs for the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services, says the 
impact of the virus is cyclic. 
</P>
<P>
"The RS virus is not necessarily any worse than we expected this year," Fannin 
says. "We're having a heavy year this year, but that happens every two or three 
years." 
</P>
<P>
"It hits kids under 2 years the hardest," says Dr. Wilbert Mason, a 
pediatrician at Childrens Hospital, Los Angeles. In December, 192 cases of RSV 
were diagnosed there, twice the number diagnosed during last season's peak 
month. It seems to be leveling off, Mason says. 
</P>
<P>
First symptoms of RS virus are sniffles, sore throat and fever. 
</P>
<P>
"In adults, the symptoms often stop there," Stutman says. "But in children, the 
virus is more likely to move to their lungs and bronchial tubes." 
</P>
<P>
When to call the doctor? 
</P>
<P>
"If the child is having trouble taking in fluids, looks pale or is having 
breathing difficulties, seek help," says Stutman, who says children can worsen 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Children hospitalized with the virus are given breathing treatments and fluids, 
sometimes intravenously, for three to five days. 
</P>
<P>
A few need aerosol applications of ribavirin (Virazole), an antiviral 
medication administered for 12 to 18 hours a day via a hood or tent. 
</P>
<P>
"This virus is spread by hand to mucous membrane, so it's not good enough to 
turn your head away when you cough," Stutman says. "Parents and care-givers who 
have colds should be scrupulous about hand washing. Any good soap will do, but 
liquid is better. The virus can live on a bar of soap for a few hours." 
</P>
<P>
Adds Mason: "You don't catch it just by being in the same room with someone 
sick. But kids can pick it up by such activities as sharing toys in day care." 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of respiratory viruses circulating in the community right 
now," says Fannin, pointing out that it's often difficult for people who are 
not trained in medicine to distinguish between potentially serious viruses and 
minor ones. 
</P>
<P>
Her guideline: "If it's a simple cold virus, kids should be feeling better in 
one to three days." 
</P>
<P>

POINT/ COUNTERPOINT 
</P>
<P>
Diet Dilemma: Should You Seek Help or Go It Alone? 
</P>
<P>
OK, so you've been overeating since Thanksgiving. The average American gains 3 
to 8 pounds between November and January, according to some hospital surveys. 
But statistics don't make zipping your jeans any easier, so you've decided to 
take action. If you have 10 pounds or so to drop, is it better to go it alone 
or enroll in a formal weight-loss program such as Weight Watchers, Diet Center 
or Nutri/System? 
</P>
<P>
Here are two experts' views. 
</P>
<P>
GO IT ALONE. Henrietta Spencer, Los Angeles psychologist and weight-control 
specialist: 
</P>
<P>
"Going it alone isn't for everyone. Those most likely to succeed don't have 
compulsive overeating problems like binging and purging, have a small amount of 
weight to lose and perhaps have already participated in an organized 
weight-loss program where they learned good habits. Men are more likely to 
succeed if they go it alone than women are. 
</P>
<P>
"If you pick the do-it-yourself path, the best way to start is to consult a 
doctor, but figure at least 10 weeks to lose 10 pounds." 
</P>
<P>
* TURN YOURSELF IN. Jeanne Peters, Torrance dietitian: 
</P>
<P>
"None of these (formal weight-loss) programs are perfect, but they offer people 
group support. Some people just don't get that kind of support from family and 
friends when they try to lose weight on their own. Dieters with a group plan 
can be successful in a relatively short period of time. To boost the chance of 
success, look for programs that encourage exercise. 
</P>
<P>
"These programs have become more flexible in terms of their meal plans. 
However, some require you to eat their foods, which can be a drawback for 
people with allergies and high blood pressure. The sodium content may be too 
high." 
</P>
<P>

Hair Removers on the Market Soon 
</P>
<P>
Women weary of shaving their legs might consider two new devices expected on 
the market next month. The Epilady Mini, small enough to fit in the palm of the 
hand, removes hair at the root, supposedly leaving legs hair-free for three 
weeks. It will retail for $29 in drug stores. A $39 version, which massages as 
it plucks, will be sold in department stores. Made by EPI Products, both 
devices are scaled-down versions of Epilady. 
</P>
<P>
Don't expect perfectly hairless legs, says Beverly Hills dermatologist Rhonda 
Rand, and there can be complications. 
</P>
<P>
She treats several patients a month for ingrown hairs, pimples around the hair 
follicles and itching. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Taking It Off 
</P>
<P>
The following is a sampling of weight-loss programs: what they claim, what they 
cost.

ERMA BOMBECK: AN EXTRA HELPING OF ADS WITH YOUR DINNER, MADAM? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERMA BOMBECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I can't get too worked up over someone taping a phone call between my mother 
and me on a cellular phone. It would serve them right. The same goes for 
eavesdropping on my conversations with my kids' answering machines. Big deal. 
Every day it's the same message: "Make me a grandmother!" 
</P>
<P>
What we really should be screaming about is how advertising is invading our 
privacy. In recent years we've all become walking billboards for designers. 
Professional athletes are as subtle as demolition balls. Hot-air balloons hover 
over us with corporate logos and billboards dot the countryside. I half 
expected Manuel Noriega to wave and shout as he left the plane in Miami, "I'm 
going to Disneyland!" 
</P>
<P>
Now it seems the last frontier of privacy is about to be assaulted by 
commercialism -- dining out. 
</P>
<P>
Someone got the bright idea that waiters and waitresses have nothing to do 
except introduce themselves, tell you about the specials not on the menu, 
announce the soup du jour and the catch of the day, take your order, deliver 
your drinks and bread, toss the salad, elevate the pepper mill like a chalice, 
set fire to your food, recite the litany of the desserts, serve coffee and 
disappear for two hours with your credit card. So an ad agency is suggesting 
waiters and waitresses model clothes and fill you in on where to buy them and 
how much they cost. 
</P>
<P>
Get real. I have more conversation with my waiter now than I've had with my 
entire family over the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
There's more. Also under consideration is a magazine/menu that will run ads for 
food, beverages and banks (that makes sense) and offer food and drinks named 
for advertisers. ("Could I suggest starting off with a Lincoln S&amp;L Lite 
Hemlock, sir?") 
</P>
<P>
In my heart, I know it won't stop there. When someone is late for his 
reservation, he'll be awarded the No Excuses Jeans Award. Strangers will sit 
down at your table and say, "I'm not a doctor, but I own a white coat and 
pretend I am when I eat out, and you need more fiber in your diet." 
</P>
<P>
It will only be a matter of time before a rabbit with a drum and two Energizer 
batteries will march through your stall in the powder room. 
</P>
<P>
It may seem like a little thing. First a book of matches in the center of the 
table with the name of an insurance company on it, and the next thing you know, 
there will be a fax machine to place your order for Stud's (or whatever his 
name is) leather jacket. 
</P>
<P>
I'm probably getting paranoid, but the other night in our favorite restaurant, 
every waiter there looked like Ed McMahon.

DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: WILL HUSBAND BE ABUSER TOO? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JOYCE BROTHERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: My husband admitted to me after our marriage that he was a 
victim of sexual abuse by his stepfather. Eventually, his mother divorced this 
man, but the abuse went on for some time before that. We're thinking of having 
children and I'm wondering if I should be concerned that my husband will repeat 
this pattern of abuse. -- K.W. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR K.W.: We know that a high proportion of troubled adults were abused as 
children, and we also know that, unfortunately, many children who were sexually 
abused become abusers themselves. Studies show that about one-third of those 
who were abused in childhood repeat the pattern. Let us hope that your husband 
is one of the two-thirds who does not. 
</P>
<P>
Studies indicate that one of the important factors in whether or not the 
pattern is repeated is whether the person has the insight to recognize that the 
abusive parent was wrong to abuse them. Many youngsters deny their abuse or 
claim it wasn't so bad. It's important for them to accept that it was bad, that 
they didn't invite or initiate the abuse and that it wasn't in any way their 
fault. 
</P>
<P>
Children do better after having been abused if there's one person in their 
lives on whom they can depend -- a relative, teacher, minister or friend who is 
emotionally nurturing. According to Martha Erickson, a psychologist at the 
University of Minnesota, the earlier the maltreatment occurred, the more severe 
the consequences. 
</P>
<P>
Talk with your husband about his feelings regarding children. If he has any 
doubts, suggest that he work with a therapist. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: I used to look forward to going into my office in the 
morning, but now I have a new boss who is a mean pig. He's hostile and unkind 
to almost everyone, but there's nothing I can do about it. I can't afford to 
quit my job so I guess I'll have to live with this. I'd like to figure out some 
way to turn off my anger. -- H.Z. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR H.Z.: You might try to use this as a kind of test or experiment where you 
take control of your mind and when you're not actually doing specific work in 
your office, try taking mini-vacations in your mind. This is an inexpensive way 
to go on a ski trip, visit the Alps, go scuba diving or do anything that 
pleases you. You'll find that if you change your focus away from your boss, 
you'll relax and much of your tension will disappear. 
</P>
<P>
If it's any comfort to you, the kind of personality you're describing can be 
expected to face a lot of problems. Your boss is unhappy with himself, which is 
why he behaves as he does. Angry, cynical people are five times as likely to 
die under 50 as are people who are calm and trusting. 
</P>
<P>
According to Dr. Redford Williams, a professor at Duke University Medical 
Center in Durham, N.C., "toxic personalities," such as that of your boss, can 
be traced to biological differences probably present from birth. These 
individuals are more likely to suffer from premature death from all causes.

The Dead to Play at Forum: The death of a fan who clashed with police at the 
Forum in Inglewood during a Grateful Dead concert last December won't change 
the group's plans to play there again in February. The Grateful Dead will 
perform at the Forum Feb. 9, 10 and 11, a band spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
In December a three-night series of shows by the band ended with the death of a 
fan who stopped breathing while handcuffed in the back of a police car. Patrick 
Shanahan, 19, died after arrested on suspicion of being under the influence of 
drugs. An autopsy later determined Shanahan died from compression of the neck 
caused by a carotid neck hold and the death was ruled a homicide. The incident 
is still under investigation by the Los Angeles County District Attorney's 
Office. BETH KLEID

Ask Not What Your Country Can Do for You: The U.S. government's new song "Wait 
for Me" may not be on the pop charts yet, but people all over Nigeria are 
singing along: "Dis tin them call love / na serious affair / make you think 
well / before you gree," the song says in pidgin English. Translation: "This 
thing they call love is a serious affair. 
</P>
<P>
Think well before you agree." That's the population control message the Agency 
for International Development is trying to get across all over the Third World, 
where the agency is sponsoring similar songs in languages from West African 
pidgin to Philippine Tagalog. The Nigerian hit was recorded by King Sunny Ade, 
known in West Africa for a style called ju-ju, and Onyeku Onwenu. Ade has three 
wives and 12 children. BETH KLEID

The San Diego Superior Court cut its backlog of civil cases awaiting trial by 
75% last year, recently released statistics indicate. 
</P>
<P>
The astounding cut would seem to dramatically highlight the success of the 
controversial "fast-track" plan, which pushes judges to speedily resolve civil 
cases. First put into practice in San Diego, it has been closely watched by the 
rest of the state. 
</P>
<P>
The cut is all the more amazing because it occurred during a year that saw all 
civil trials in San Diego come to a screeching halt for three weeks. Not only 
that, other county courts reported slight increases in the number of cases they 
had waiting for trial, the statistics indicate. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that the San Diego court's judges and managers don't believe the 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"If somebody told me I reduced the caseload in that year by 20%, I would be 
ecstatic. And I think we probably did that," said Judge Michael I. Greer, the 
court's presiding judge last year. 
</P>
<P>
"But to have reduced the caseload by 75% in one year is not the real world." 
</P>
<P>
Greer and San Diego court administrators conceded that they generated the 
numbers, which they passed on to the state, which dutifully reported them. They 
also acknowledged that they have a good, but not firm idea about why the 
figures might be wrong, can only guess at what the true numbers might be and 
are scrambling to figure out the true picture. 
</P>
<P>
So, at a time when the state report should be a point of pride for the San 
Diego court and Greer's leadership, he is left, once again, to deny charges 
that the three-week moratorium on civil trials was not a pressure ploy designed 
solely to secure more judges for the county -- which it did. "I was not crying 
wolf," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And, though the report should provide empirical support for the efficiency of 
the "fast-track" plan, Greer, one of its primary proponents, is left to fret 
about whether the statistics will instead spark a public-relations fiasco and 
jeopardize expansion of the fast-track program around the state. 
</P>
<P>
"It hurts the system to have inappropriate figures like that," Greer said. 
"Then people wonder about everything. It's unfortunate. I'm rather taken aback 
by it." 
</P>
<P>
According to the figures, the San Diego Superior Court reported 9,141 civil 
cases "awaiting trial" on June 30, 1988. At the end of the next fiscal year, on 
June 30, 1989, the San Diego court counted 2,249 waiting cases, a 75.4% drop. 
</P>
<P>
The statistics were published Jan. 5 by the Judicial Council of California, 
which administers the state courts. They were taken from monthly reports sent 
by the courts themselves to the state agency's San Francisco headquarters, said 
Mike Kramer, a spokesman for the Administrative Office of the Courts. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the eight other Superior Courts that were ordered by law to begin 
a "fast-track" program beginning in January, 1988 -- a year after the plan 
began in San Diego -- reported that the number of cases awaiting trial went up 
by a combined 4% from June, 1988, through June, 1989, according to the Jan. 5 
report. 
</P>
<P>
Those eight courts include other counties with large backlogs, including Los 
Angeles, San Francisco, Orange and Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Courts that voluntarily instituted a "fast-track" program in 1988 
recorded a 6% increase, according to the tables. All other Superior Courts 
reported a 23% increase. 
</P>
<P>
Because the San Diego figure is so dramatically down when other counties' are 
up, Ron Titus, the director of research and statistics for the Administrative 
Office of the Courts, said he "would definitely suspect something is wrong 
there." 
</P>
<P>
And yet both Titus and Pearl M. Taylor, executive director of central 
operations for the San Diego Superior Court, confirmed that the state agency 
only printed what the San Diego court sent it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying it's not true," Taylor said. "It's a gut feeling it's not 
true." 
</P>
<P>
A court deputy, she said, has been assigned to figure out what might be wrong 
-- and, if there's a discrepancy, to calculate the correct figures. The "strong 
feeling" among the court's managers is that there may be a discrepancy caused 
by a change in computer software, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Court managers suspect the problem is not with the June, 1988, figure 
indicating 9,141 cases awaiting trial, but with the June, 1989, count of 2,249 
-- which should be "more like 7,000," said Kenneth Martone, executive officer 
of the San Diego court. 
</P>
<P>
Court staffers hope to have a clearer picture by the end of the week, Martone 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
All of this might never even have been noticed in previous years because the 
tables detailing the number of pending cases were printed in the spring as an 
appendix to the Judicial Council's annual report. Buried among reams of 
statistics in the back of a fat, bound book, the "awaiting trial" category 
rarely drew public attention. 
</P>
<P>
This year, however, the Judicial Council published on Jan. 5 a slim volume 
listing the "awaiting trial" tables -- along with information on filings, 
dispositions and criminal convictions -- for all state trial and appellate 
courts. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst thing that can happen is to have statistics like that come out and 
have someone say, 'How did you do it?' " Taylor said. "We have to say, 'We 
didn't do it.' " 
</P>
<P>
That answer is especially galling, she said, because the success of the 
"fast-track" program is being measured, in large part, by what happens in San 
Diego. The program began in San Diego in 1987, a year before it was taken up 
anywhere else in California. 
</P>
<P>
The program pushes San Diego judges to conclude 90% of civil cases filed after 
January, 1987, within 12 months. The court's most recent statistics indicate 
that it is meeting the 90% goal at the 24-month mark, Greer said, much better 
than the four years it used to take to get a case to trial but not what the 
program demands. 
</P>
<P>
The fast-track programs are to be reviewed at the end of 1990 by the state 
Legislature, which, after watching San Diego's experience with it in 1987, 
ordered it extended in 1988 to the eight other counties with large backlogs and 
urged other counties to experiment with it. 
</P>
<P>
"I would bet we had a very significant reduction in our backlog," Greer said. 
"But, to me, significant would be, just guessing, 20%." 
</P>
<P>
The publication of the 75% figure, meanwhile, has renewed debate over Greer's 
move in February, 1989, to halt civil trials because of an overwhelming backlog 
of criminal cases. Civil cases resumed three weeks later, after Gov. George 
Deukmejian named seven San Diegans to the Superior Court bench. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to get out those criminal cases," Greer said. "I was down five judges 
and in trouble in crime. The minute I got those judges assigned, I could go 
back to work. I think those cases are too important to play games with them." 
</P>
<P>
The number of criminal cases awaiting trial rose from 691 in June, 1988, to 848 
in June, 1989, a 23% increase, according to the Judicial Council tables.

CASE AGAINST JUDGE SHOULD REMAIN IN SAN DIEGO, COURT RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A lawsuit that claims a San Diego family-court judge committed fraud and legal 
malpractice before he took the bench should be heard in San Diego County, a 
state appellate court ruled Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The 4th District Court of Appeal ordered the case against Judge Thomas Ashworth 
III returned to San Diego Superior Court, saying it was improperly ordered out 
of the county. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Michael I. Greer, former presiding judge of San Diego Superior Court, was 
wrong to take it upon himself last November to order the case to Orange County 
because he did not follow the proper procedures for a transfer, the unanimous 
three-judge appellate court said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the panel said, there is "no evidence" to show that Ashworth 
cannot get an impartial trial in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The $3-million suit was filed against Ashworth in 1987 by a Northern California 
woman, Virginia Searles, charging him with fraud and malpractice while he 
served as her divorce lawyer, before he took the bench in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Ashworth negligently allowed Searles' husband and others to defraud her of 
possibly millions of dollars from an insurance company and other properties the 
couple owned, the suit charges. 
</P>
<P>
Although the suit was filed more than two years ago, it has yet to be assigned 
to a judge for trial. 
</P>
<P>
First, San Diego Superior Court Judge Ben Hamrick bowed out, saying he had a 
conflict of interest because of his working relationship with Ashworth. Next, 
the Imperial County judge to whom it was assigned withdrew, saying he once had 
served on a legal panel with Ashworth. 
</P>
<P>
In September, Greer indicated he would ask the state to assign a judge from 
outside the county. But, at a Nov. 30 hearing, Greer decided himself, over 
Searles' objection, to transfer the case to the Orange County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Searles appealed Greer's decision. The 4th District agreed with her that Greer 
acted improperly, saying he deprived her of due-process rights by not giving 
her an opportunity to file legal papers objecting to a transfer before the Nov. 
30 hearing. 
</P>
<P>
In ordering the case returned to San Diego, Justice Howard Wiener said the 
current presiding judge of the local Superior Court, Judith McConnell, should 
ask the state to provide an out-of-town judge to hear the case. 
</P>
<P>
Judges Patricia Benke and Don Work concurred in the decision. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the ruling, the case still might not be heard in San Diego. Ashworth's 
lawyer, Patrick McCormick, said Monday night that he will ask that the case be 
heard in another county. 
</P>
<P>
Searles' lawyers, as well as Ashworth and Greer, could not be reached Monday 
for comment.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: POMONA SETS UP PANEL ON POLICE, FIRE 
PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Pomona City Council has voted to establish a Public Safety Commission to 
advise the council on police and fire problems. 
</P>
<P>
Council members Nell Soto and C. L. (Clay) Bryant were appointed to work with 
city staff members to prepare an ordinance spelling out the commission's 
duties. 
</P>
<P>
The council must approve the measure before appointments are made. 
</P>
<P>
Soto, who proposed the commission, said it would examine public safety issues, 
ranging from traffic problems to citizen complaints. She said the commission 
would not have the power to punish employees, nor would it function as a 
watchdog. However, Bryant offered a different view, saying it could serve as a 
police review board to look into complaints against officers. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Donna Smith and Councilman Mark A. T. Nymeyer voted against the proposal. 
Smith said the commission might alienate workers, and Nymeyer said Soto's 
proposal was too vague.

COUNCIL REJECTS MAYOR'S BID TO DELAY PORT PICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an unusual decision Monday, the San Diego City Council rejected Mayor 
Maureen O'Connor's request to postpone today's scheduled appointment of two new 
San Diego port commissioners because she will be absent. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor leaves today for a meeting of the U.S. Conference of Mayors in 
Washington and then travels to Moscow for the opening of an exhibit of Faberge 
eggs and the opening of the Soviet Union's first McDonald's restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
The council did agree, however, to schedule a Feb. 7 discussion of whether it 
has the authority to recall Dan Larsen, one of its three appointees to the 
powerful San Diego Unified Port District. 
</P>
<P>
The latter decision, scheduled to discuss City Atty. John Witt's legal opinion 
that the council lacks the authority to recall Larsen without demonstrating 
malfeasance on his part, appears to have been made because the coalition that 
wants to dump Larsen is one vote short of the five votes needed to recall him, 
according to council sources. 
</P>
<P>
Council members John Hartley, Bob Filner, Wes Pratt and Abbe Wolfsheimer appear 
ready to oust Larsen for failing to vote the council's position on several 
issues, including renaming the San Diego Convention Center for the Rev. Dr. 
Martin Luther King Jr. However, the group lacks the fifth vote needed for a 
majority, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The council will proceed, however, with naming replacements for outgoing 
Commissioners William Rick and Louis Wolfsheimer, appointments that could have 
a substantial impact on how much control the council has over the wealthy and 
influential agency. The city has three seats on the seven-member Board of Port 
Commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, the council agrees to postpone debates when a member asks for the 
courtesy. But the commission appointments have become a heated political issue 
between O'Connor and Filner, who has claimed that the mayor is attempting to 
delay the appointments to round up support for her choices. 
</P>
<P>
Filner was joined by Wolfsheimer, Hartley, Pratt and Councilwoman Linda 
Bernhardt, who, in the past two months, formed a new council majority on some 
issues.

ZOO PHONES RING FOLLOWING TV REPORT ON SALE OF SURPLUS ANIMALS FOR HUNTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego Zoo was flooded with telephone calls Monday after it was featured 
in a television news report that suggested that animals from some zoos end up 
on private hunting farms, a zoo spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Jouett, the spokesman, said a "60 Minutes" segment that aired Sunday 
prompted about 75 people to call the zoo Monday. The segment, which focused on 
what the nation's zoos do with their surplus animals, said that animals from 
the San Diego Zoo are often entrusted to an animal trader named Earl Tatum. 
Tatum, the segment alleged, has used middlemen to sell exotic animals at 
wildlife auctions, where private hunting farms buy their stock. 
</P>
<P>
Jouett, who spent the day talking to people who called a special line installed 
to handle the heavy telephone traffic, said the news show gave many people a 
mistaken impression. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest misinformation is that people call and think the San Diego Zoo is 
selling animals at wildlife auctions," he said. "We don't participate in 
wildlife auctions. We certainly don't participate or condone hunting ranches, 
and we don't work with anybody who does." 
</P>
<P>
Jouett confirmed that the zoo has a longstanding relationship with Tatum, but 
he defended Tatum's reputation. In October, Jouett said, when a "60 Minutes" 
reporter showed zoo officials a videotape of Tatum attending an animal auction, 
the zoo immediately stopped doing business with him. 
</P>
<P>
Soon afterward, Doug Myers, executive director of the Zoological Society, flew 
to Arkansas to confront Tatum, Jouett said. 
</P>
<P>
"He assured us again that no San Diego animals that he has handled have gone to 
an auction or a hunting ranch," Jouett said. 
</P>
<P>
The zoo then resumed its business with Tatum, Jouett said. Mostly, Jouett said, 
the zoo hires Tatum to transport animals from San Diego to other zoos, often 
giving him surplus animals as payment for his services. 
</P>
<P>
"We trade animals to him in return for his transport services," Jouett said. 
"He really is the best person at transporting animals, and we move over 1,100 
animals a year." 
</P>
<P>
Jouett also said that, at the request of the San Diego Zoo, the American Assn. 
of Zoological Parks and Aquariums has appointed a task force to investigate the 
practices used by all animal suppliers and transporters. 
</P>
<P>
"If they turn up any evidence that Earl Tatum or anyone else is working through 
a middleman at a game auction or a hunting park, then we have done our last bit 
of business with that person," Jouett said.

AFTER 15 YEARS, THIS SHIPYARD BECOMES JUST ANOTHER YARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
After at least 15 years of looking at what might be the biggest boat ever to 
dry-dock in the west San Fernando Valley, residents of a Reseda neighborhood 
prepared to say goodby Monday to the craft they adopted as a landmark. 
</P>
<P>
According to Los Angeles building officials, Steve Schleder has been building 
the 16-foot-high, 50-foot-long boat in a lot next to his rented house at the 
corner of Geyser Avenue and busy Vanowen Street since at least 1975. 
</P>
<P>
But under pressure from zoning laws, Schleder readied the boat Monday for a 
move from its makeshift port, drawing a crowd of about 30 neighbors and 
passers-by. 
</P>
<P>
"My God, after all these years, he's finally going to move it," neighbor 
Richard Terry said as he watched Schleder and some workers fasten the boat to a 
flatbed trailer. 
</P>
<P>
Schleder had nothing to say to reporters Monday. A spokesman for the El Segundo 
yacht transport company he hired said the boat would be moved sometime today to 
an undisclosed location. Schleder recently told Los Angeles officials that he 
was planning to move the boat to Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
The move takes place about a week before Schleder was to face the possibility 
of misdemeanor criminal charges for building the boat in an area zoned for 
residential use only, said Rick Usher of the city's Building and Safety 
Department. A settlement hearing with a deputy city attorney is scheduled for 
next Monday, Usher said. 
</P>
<P>
If the boat has been moved, the matter will become moot, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the city's qualms about the zoning, those who stopped Monday at 
Schleder's yard expressed overwhelming support for him. 
</P>
<P>
"It becomes part of you when you've been here so long and see it," neighbor Al 
Washburn said. 
</P>
<P>
"How am I going to tell people how to get to my home?" neighbor Karen McConnell 
said. "I always used to say take a right at the boat or take a left at the 
boat, because it was such a landmark."

GRANDMOTHERLY WOMAN, 81, ACCUSED OF SWINDLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA KLEIN LERNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A grandmotherly 81-year-old Van Nuys woman who was convicted six years ago of 
attempting to swindle then-President Ronald Reagan is now charged with stealing 
a portion of an elderly neighbor's life savings. 
</P>
<P>
Ann Roberts, described by a prosecutor as looking "like anybody's grandmother," 
has a record of forgery convictions dating back to 1940, prosecutors said. She 
faces a preliminary hearing Feb. 9 on charges of grand theft. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts is accused of bilking Mildred Hendricks, 74, out of $2,000 last June 
with tearful claims that she needed money to buy a headstone for a recently 
deceased aunt, Deputy Dist. Atty. Andrew W. Diamond said. 
</P>
<P>
Hendricks told Los Angeles police that Roberts claimed she was worth $13 
million and would repay the money and an additional $1,000 as soon as funds 
became available, Diamond said. 
</P>
<P>
Hendricks called police after the $3,000 check Roberts wrote her in repayment 
for the loan bounced, Diamond said. 
</P>
<P>
"You walk by her on the street and she looks just like anybody's grandmother," 
Diamond said. "She has a criminal record going back a half a century" for 
theft, embezzlement and fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts has pleaded not guilty to the charges. "I didn't do anything," she said 
in a telephone interview. "When I get to court I will prove that everything is 
a lie. I'm a nice, honest lady and if you met me, you'd say the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
Roberts' attorney, Philip Nameth, said the case should be handled in civil 
court. "But for the fact she was involved in the Reagan case, this matter would 
not be filed as a criminal offense," Nameth said. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts and her husband, James Yarborough, were convicted six years ago of 
opening escrow on Reagan's former residence in Pacific Palisades with a phony, 
postdated cashier's check and other documents to make it appear they were 
multimillionaires. She used the name Ann Yarborough at the time. 
</P>
<P>
She also pleaded guilty to swindling two banks, a dentist and her maid and 
chauffeur out of more than $350,000, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Adalbert T. 
Botello. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts used fake court orders indicating that she would inherit large sums of 
money from her late ex-husband and doctored financial statements and money 
orders to persuade people to make temporary loans, Botello said. 
</P>
<P>
She was sentenced to three years and four months in prison and her husband, who 
prosecutors said was a follower in the scheme, received three years probation. 
</P>
<P>
"I think her age and gender made it easier for her to steal from people," 
Botello said. "People want to believe an elderly woman who fits the image of 
their grandmother."

The two blacks rejected in September -- the Rev. Jules S. Bagneris III and 
Thomas J. Montgomery -- said Harvey's acceptance would encourage their plans to 
reapply in March. And Deputy State Atty. Gen. Louis Verdugo, who is 
investigating the earlier vote, said his "interest is piqued" by tonight's 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
Jose De Sosa, president of both the San Fernando Valley chapter and state 
conference of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People, said 
the outcome of the vote may help his organization determine whether the Van 
Nuys lodge has racist membership practices. 
</P>
<P>
Lodge spokesman Dan Davis declined to release any information about Harvey, 
saying the nominee had requested anonymity to avoid "that circus the media 
created the last time." No black community leaders contacted recognized 
Harvey's name. 
</P>
<P>
Another Elks member and a Valley resident familiar with the nomination, both of 
whom asked not to be identified, confirmed that Harvey will be formally 
sponsored tonight by the lodge's exalted ruler, George Aguilar. 
</P>
<P>
Aguilar, a Los Angeles police officer, did not return telephone calls Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana) sponsored both Montgomery, a retired state motor 
vehicles examiner, and Bagneris, an unsuccessful City Council candidate who now 
represents the firm that is dredging Hansen Dam. The lodge considered those 
nominations twice, voting 34 to 19 in favor of their admission the second time, 
just shy of the two-thirds majority required by lodge bylaws. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Davis blamed the rejection on Robbins' involvement rather than on 
racial bias. By his own admission, Robbins is not very active in the 
organization. In past interviews, several lodge members charged that Robbins 
had made the nominations merely to win beneficial publicity for sponsoring 
black applicants. 
</P>
<P>
"The last time was a political thing and that was what upset most people," 
Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
Also rejected in September was Robbins' aide, Jack Sheffield, who is white. 
</P>
<P>
However, Steve Duchscherer, a past exalted ruler of the Van Nuys lodge, on 
Monday continued to describe the September vote as the work of a "handful of 
bigots." Duchscherer said he hopes tonight's outcome will be different. But if 
it isn't, he said, he may leave the lodge. 
</P>
<P>
Duchscherer said he had hoped to sponsor another black nominee before he 
learned of Aguilar's motion. But, he said, "If his candidate cannot get through 
. . . I know that I won't have a chance."

A Woodland Hills woman and an alleged accomplice were charged Monday with 
murdering the woman's husband, an X-rated film producer shot to death on a 
Northridge street last August. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Snyder, 39, and Victor Diaz, whose address was not immediately 
available, were charged with murder and conspiracy to murder Theodore J. 
Snyder, 47, of Woodland Hills, part owner of Video Cassette Recordings and Mark 
V International adult video companies. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder was shot Aug. 1 at Blackhawk Street and Wilbur Avenue in Northridge. 
Sharon Snyder and Diaz were arrested Friday by Los Angeles police detectives 
and are being held without bail in city jails pending arraignment today in San 
Fernando Municipal Court, said Sandi Gibbons, spokeswoman for the Los Angeles 
County district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
The murder charge carries a special circumstance allegation of murder for 
financial gain, which makes it possible for prosecutors to seek the death 
penalty or life in prison without possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
Further details were not available because law enforcement officials could not 
be reached for comment Monday evening. 
</P>
<P>
At least one law enforcement source said after the shooting that Snyder's ties 
to organized crime might have led to his death, but police publicly said no 
clear motive had emerged in their investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Diaz, whose occupation was not immediately known, also is charged with one 
count of possession of a machine gun, Gibbons said. 
</P>
<P>
Court affidavits showed that Snyder's company did business with and owed money 
to a firm allegedly controlled by Martin Taccetta, a man linked by federal 
prosecutors to the Lucchese crime family. 
</P>

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO

On the 17th anniversary of the legalization of abortion, pro-choice forces won 
a victory Monday as the U.S. Supreme Court tossed out a case against San Diego 
abortion clinic personnel who placed protesters under citizen's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very clear message to anti-abortion groups that there are limits to 
their actions, and that support for their actions is getting smaller and 
smaller," said Rina Berkhout, executive director of Womancare Clinic. 
</P>
<P>
"Anti-abortion protesters are losing more and more ground." 
</P>
<P>
Five demonstrators were placed under citizen's arrest in October, 1985, when 
they picketed the Womancare Clinic in the 2800 block of 6th Avenue. The case 
involved almost five years of litigation as the demonstrators charged that they 
had been denied their right to free speech and subjected to false arrest, 
emotional distress and negligence. Although the group was initially awarded 
money, the case was reversed in a court decision in January, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The final blow came this week when the Supreme Court declined to hear the 
protesters' case. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very disappointed," said Lloyd Tooks, the attorney representing the 
five demonstrators. "I believe this will encourage citizens to make arrests 
instead of police." 
</P>
<P>
But Berkhout said Womancare officials would continue to depend on police to 
keep protesters from disrupting the clinic's operations. The Supreme Court's 
action does, however, give clinic officials an additional tool to help protect 
their clients, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"If we have to make citizen's arrests, we will do it," Berkhout said. "We will 
protect our clients."

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: EL CAJON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An El Cajon man convicted of involuntary manslaughter in the death of his 
girlfriend's 18-month-old son was sentenced Monday to nine years in state 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin Chloupek, 26, was given the maximum term by San Diego Superior Court 
Judge William Kennedy, who also fined him $100. 
</P>
<P>
A jury on Dec. 12 found Chloupek not guilty of murdering Jeffri Brown, but 
found him guilty of manslaughter, child abuse and inflicting corporal injury on 
a child. 
</P>
<P>
Chloupek testified that the boy must have received his head injuries when he 
fell off a water bed on April 13, 1988, but medical experts told jurors the 
injuries probably occurred in a violent shaking or beating. 
</P>
<P>
The boy was taken to a hospital and died April 20, 1988. Chloupek's former 
girlfriend, Donna McLane, testified against Chloupek at the trial, saying she 
left her son in his care at their El Cajon apartment when she went to a video 
store. 
</P>
<P>
McLane told jurors Chloupek at first told her at the hospital that the boy 
choked on something and later attributed the injuries to the fall. 
</P>
<P>
McLane told Probation Department officials she was not pleased with the verdict 
and wished her former boyfriend could be sent to prison for life, saying he had 
planned the crime.

A Santee woman and her 2-year-old daughter were killed Sunday night, apparently 
by the woman's estranged husband, who then turned the gun on himself, the San 
Diego County Sheriff's Department said. 
</P>
<P>
The bodies of Sherry Lucern Battaglia, 41; Kelly Renee Battaglia, 2, and Joseph 
Frances Battaglia, 32, were found at 6:55 p.m. by Sherry Battaglia's family, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Sherry's father, mother and sisters went to the apartment in the 9400 block of 
Lake Canyon Road to take her and Kelly to dinner for Sherry's birthday. When no 
one answered the door, Irving Knight, Sherry Battaglia's father, climbed 
through a window in the back of the house and found the bodies in the bedroom, 
sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
The mother and daughter were found in bed. Joseph Battaglia was on the bedroom 
floor with an apparently self-inflicted gunshot to the head. A .38-caliber 
pistol was found nearby, Sheriff's Sgt. Manuel Castillo said. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph and Sherry Battaglia had been separated for several months, Castillo 
said, but authorities are unsure what led to the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"The whys and why nots, we may never know," Castillo said.

GAVALDON'S OPEN BID ENDS IN QUARTERFINALS 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
MELBOURNE, Australia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Coronado's Angelica Gavaldon saw her amazing Australian Open end Tuesday in the 
quarterfinals as she fell to West Germany's Claudia Porwik, 6-4, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Gavaldon, a 16-year-old amateur from Our Lady of Peace High School in San 
Diego, blamed the loss on poor strategy and a lack of concentration. 
</P>
<P>
"I think she played really well and smart," Gavaldon said. "I should have 
attacked a little more. I tried to over hit and it was too windy. The ball was 
blowing all over. I also could have concentrated a little more." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the tournament, Gavaldon upset Hana Mandlikova, the seventh-seeded 
player and two-time Australian Open champion, and 15th-seeded Gigi Fernandez. 
</P>
<P>
"(Porwik) didn't come in like Gigi and Hana," Gavaldon said. "She stayed on the 
baseline and played good with the wind. When I would touch the ball, it seems 
like it would go into the crowd. But that's not an excuse, because it was windy 
all week. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everybody has a bad day, this was mine. My first serves weren't going 
in. I really wanted to win badly, it just didn't happen for me." 
</P>
<P>
Porwik, ranked 75th, reached the semifinals in a Grand Slam event for the first 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Gavaldon entered the tournament ranked 192nd, but will end it ranked 95th. 
</P>
<P>
Gavaldon's incredible run began a week ago Monday with a first-round defeat of 
Upland's Laxmi Pouri, 6-3, 6-3. She then beat Alexia Dechaume of France, 6-4, 
4-6, 7-5 in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pleased with what I did, but I'm disappointed because I think I'm good 
enough to beat these players," she said. "I had an opportunity here, but I 
should have taken more advantage of it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very pleased, but not surprised. I feel I'm ready to play at this level. I 
gained a lot of confidence and experience." 
</P>
<P>
Gavaldon had planned to play in a tournament in New Zealand next week, but, 
instead, will return to San Diego for some rest and a reevaluation of her 
future. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, Gavaldon had said she would remain an amateur until she reached the 
top 100. But after her success in Australia, she said her plans may be 
changing. 
</P>
<P>
"I have some decisions to make," she said. "I'm going to think about turning 
pro." 
</P>
<P>
As an amateur, Gavaldon can claim expenses, but won't collect the $24,000 prize 
for reaching the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
Gavaldon's next scheduled tournament will be in Indian Wells at the Lipton 
International on Feb. 26. 
</P>
<P>
* Meanwhile, neither Boris Becker nor Steffi Graf nor Zina Garrison had an easy 
time in the heat. 
</P>
<P>
Becker had to go five sets. Graf nearly lost a set for the first time in the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Only Garrison wilted. 
</P>
<P>
The third-seeded woman fell to Mary Joe Fernandez, 1-6, 6-2, 8-6, in the 
quarterfinals at the National Tennis Center, where the temperature on court was 
said to be well above 100 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty frustrating. I don't understand it sometimes," said Garrison, who 
appeared to have a clear run to the final after an injury forced No. 2 Gabriela 
Sabatini to withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
Garrison was serving for the match at 5-4 and 6-5 in the third set, but her 
serve was broken each time and then broken again at love when the sixth-seeded 
Fernandez won the match. 
</P>
<P>
"I work very hard, but I never seem able to make my breaks," said Garrison, a 
Houston native who was a semifinalist at last year's U.S. Open. "Until I do, I 
don't deserve to win. (This was) a match I think I lost. It was in my hands and 
I didn't take advantage of it. More than anything, I wanted to win. Sometimes 
you want to win too bad." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Graf had her toughest challenge of the tournament before turning 
back Patty Fendick of Sacramento, 6-3, 7-5. That tied Graf's career-best 
winning streak with a 46th consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
Fendick had a 5-2 lead and a set point on Graf's serve in the second set, but 
Graf held and allowed Fendick only four points in the next four games to wrap 
up the match. 
</P>
<P>
Becker survived a tougher test. Down a service break in the third set to 
Miloslav Mecir of Czechoslovakia, Becker stormed back to win, 4-6, 6-7 (8-6), 
6-4, 6-1, 6-1, and reach the quarterfinals against Mats Wilander.

FIRST INTERSTATE LOSES $344 MILLION IN QUARTER; 
</P>
<P>
EARNINGS: THE LOS ANGELES-BASED BANK CITED PERSISTENT TROUBLES AT ITS TEXAS 
SUBSIDIARY. GREAT WESTERN ALSO RECORDED A QUARTERLY LOSS AS IT SUFFERED FROM 
REAL ESTATE PROBLEMS.

<P>
First Interstate Bancorp, battered by continuing loan problems in its troubled 
Texas unit, on Monday reported a larger-than-expected $344.3-million loss in 
the fourth quarter and a total deficit of $124.5 million for the year. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, another major Southern California financial institution, Great 
Western Financial, blamed real estate problems for its $77.3-million loss in 
the quarter. Despite the fourth-quarter loss, the Beverly Hills-based parent of 
Great Western Bank posted a profit for the year of $100 million, down 60% from 
$248 million earned in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
First Interstate's quarterly loss, which contrasts with a $144-million profit 
earned a year earlier, exceeded predictions by several securities analysts 
after the Los Angeles-based banking company's disclosure last month that it 
would allocate $400 million largely for its reserves to cover possible losses 
on problem real estate in Texas. The 1989 loss contrasted with a $129.4-million 
profit earned in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
First Interstate's earnings report comes less than one week after the company 
disclosed plans by Joseph J. Pinola to retire as chairman and chief executive 
on June 1, to be succeeded by First Interstate President Edward M. Carson. 
</P>
<P>
Both moves were expected, although some speculated that the announcement was 
moved up to placate investors who have grown impatient with Pinola and the 
firm's string of unexpectedly large problems in Texas and Arizona during the 
past two years. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth-quarter loss reflects continuing problems stemming from First 
Interstate's acquisition in early 1988 of Allied Bancshares, which got into 
trouble when the Texas oil boom turned into a bust in the mid-1980s. Top First 
Interstate executives, including Pinola, now acknowledge that the acquisition 
was a mistake and that they failed to adequately evaluate the bank's condition 
before buying it. 
</P>
<P>
First Interstate acquired the bank without federal assistance. Competitors such 
as NCNB of Charlotte, N.C., and Banc One of Columbus, Ohio, later acquired 
banks in Texas with federal assistance. Those units are outperforming First 
Interstate's operation. Indeed, NCNB last week attributed its strong earnings 
performance largely to its Texas unit. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, First Interstate has consistently misjudged the depth of its 
problem in Texas, a factor that securities analysts and real estate experts say 
makes it difficult to tell if the latest moves are adequate to deal with its 
problems. The real estate projects that Allied became involved with generally 
were not large, high-quality office projects. That market is recovering the 
fastest in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas P. Marrie, First Interstate executive vice president and chief financial 
officer, restated First Interstate's position that it believes it has taken 
adequate reserves and is in a position to move ahead in Texas to make the unit 
profitable. In Texas, he said, reserves total $520 million, while 
non-performing assets -- loans 90 days past due or ones that are likely to go 
bad -- total $489 million. 
</P>
<P>
Marrie said First Interstate now owns $907 million in real estate as a result 
of foreclosures, or property that is clearly headed for foreclosure. That is up 
from $635 million at the end of the third quarter. He said First Interstate is 
working to sell those properties, or negotiating with borrowers so that they 
can make payments on the loans. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the fourth-quarter loss comes as First Interstate's 
investment bankers continue efforts to raise $400 million to replenish its 
capital. The bank has said that it wants to sell 7.5 million shares of stock, 
but analysts believe that it may have to sell more than that to raise the money 
it wants. 
</P>
<P>
That would further dilute the holdings of shareholders at a time when 
institutional investors, who own 70% of the stock, are increasing 
disillusioned. Since August, First Interstate's stock has plunged from about 
$70 a share to $44.625. It rose 62.5 cents in Monday's trading on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
First Interstate's plunging stock price, combined with periodic comments from 
Wells Fargo Chairman Carl E. Reichardt that he would like to buy the banking 
firm, has renewed speculation that First Interstate may be a good takeover 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth-quarter loss by Great Western was not unexpected. The Beverly 
Hills-based thrift had previously disclosed that it would set aside $200 
million for problem loans, largely ones on apartment and commercial projects 
such as office buildings, in Texas, Florida and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
In the year-ago fourth quarter, Great Western earned $59.7 million.

LESABRE'S SUCCESS PROVED POINT FOR GM: QUALITY SELLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

FLINT, Mich. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This may be the most improbable place in America for the domestic auto industry 
to make a stand against the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
After all, Flint -- the aging birthplace of General Motors -- is a town that 
has come to symbolize everything that went wrong with the U.S. auto industry in 
the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Devastated by plant closings and layoffs that cut GM's Flint payroll nearly in 
half during the decade, the city is now most famous as the setting for "Roger 
and Me," a savagely funny new movie about filmmaker Michael Moore's attempts to 
take GM Chairman Roger B. Smith on a tour of the desolate landscape left behind 
by GM's virtual collapse here. 
</P>
<P>
Yet amid Flint's industrial rubble, one GM factory has been transformed into a 
showcase of American quality, building cars that are nearly as trouble-free as 
the best from Japan. 
</P>
<P>
For here at its "Buick City" assembly plant, GM produces the Buick LeSabre, 
which received the highest quality ranking of any American car in 1989 from J. 
D. Power &amp; Associates, an Agoura Hills research firm that is considered the 
last word on automotive quality in Japan and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, after years of languishing near the bottom in the annual rankings, the 
1989 LeSabre turned in the highest quality score ever posted by a domestic car 
under J. D. Power's rating system. 
</P>
<P>
Remarkably, the LeSabre also came in with higher quality scores than almost 
every Japanese car on the market and was rated the second-most trouble-free car 
sold in the United States, trailing only the Nissan Maxima. 
</P>
<P>
The LeSabre's success in the J. D. Power ratings -- usually dominated by the 
Japanese -- has acted as something of a tonic for Detroit's auto makers. 
</P>
<P>
After a decade in which the Big Three were never able to become fully 
competitive with the Japanese, the LeSabre has provided a glimmer of hope that 
Japan's quality advantage can finally be erased in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a great American success story," Buick General Manager Edward Mertz 
said. "It tells the world that the American worker can do the job on a 
world-class level." 
</P>
<P>
And, for GM in particular -- now amid its worst sales slump since the early 
1980s -- the LeSabre's surprising success comes at just the right time, when 
the organization is so badly in need of a win. 
</P>
<P>
"I really get encouraged when I look at the LeSabre," said J. T. Battenberg, 
vice president and group executive of GM's Buick, Oldsmobile and Cadillac 
Group. "Our dealers tell me that as the recognition grows that we are building 
cars of comparable quality to the Japanese -- that sells." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the LeSabre has proven once and for all to GM executives that if they 
build quality cars, people will respond; the LeSabre took off like a rocket on 
the sales charts after last June's release of the Power survey. 
</P>
<P>
In July, LeSabre sales rose more than 91% compared to those of the July, 1988; 
in August, nearly 99%. 
</P>
<P>
The public perception of quality made the LeSabre the hottest domestic car on 
the market. 
</P>
<P>
"The dealers told us that people started coming in with newspaper clippings 
about the quality ranking and would say, 'I want one of these cars,' without 
even knowing what a LeSabre was," said George Gurnsey, Buick's product 
satisfaction manager. 
</P>
<P>
For managers at the plant here, the LeSabre's success has been all the more 
rewarding because they remember too well just how bad the quality was when 
LeSabre production began at the renovated Buick City complex in September, 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
Buick City, conceived as a model plant where GM would introduce the latest in 
robotics and innovative manufacturing processes, along with a fresh approach to 
labor policies, instead quickly became one of GM's biggest headaches. 
</P>
<P>
Today, even top GM executives admit that the quality of the early LeSabres from 
Buick City was terrible. 
</P>
<P>
Quality suffered, they acknowledge, because the company tried to introduce too 
many new elements into the production system all at once. 
</P>
<P>
Not only did the LeSabre have a new design, but the Buick City plant itself was 
essentially new as well. GM had gutted a 75-year-old Buick plant and stuffed it 
with the most advanced robotics available. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the plant's workers were unaccustomed to each other, having been 
brought in from different plants in the Flint area. And, as production began in 
the fall of 1985, even the management in Flint was being restructured as part 
of GM's corporate-wide reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
"An upheaval that massive is more than anyone needs," Buick City plant manager 
Nelson Gonzalez said with a sigh. 
</P>
<P>
The result was chaos on the line at Buick City, and some of the worst quality 
anywhere inside GM. 
</P>
<P>
"We were unhappy with the start-up and the quality of the plant, no question 
about it," recalled Battenberg, who from 1986 to 1988 was in charge of GM's 
Flint Automotive Group, which runs Buick City. 
</P>
<P>
Stories abound of how Buick City's robots went haywire, militant workers 
silently stared down managers, absenteeism went sky high and the assembly line 
was repeatedly shut down because of parts shortages -- even as trucks carrying 
auto parts backed up outside the plant. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Battenberg took over in Flint in 1986 after spending six years in 
Europe with GM, Buick City seemed destined to go down as yet another failure in 
GM's decade-long campaign to catch up with the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
When he arrived, Battenberg was horrified to find out just how messed up Buick 
City really was. "I had just been trying to sell cars against the Europeans, so 
I knew how important quality was," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Quickly, Battenberg tried to pour a cold dose of reality on Buick City. 
</P>
<P>
Robots that weren't working were pulled out, and the level of automation in the 
plant was drastically reduced. 
</P>
<P>
Outside suppliers were ordered onto the shop floor at Buick City until problems 
with the machinery they had sold to GM were corrected. Materials that were 
defective were returned to their suppliers, and Buick City imposed a new rule 
that it would not perform repairs on materials coming from outside. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, GM engineers came in from around the corporation to simplify both the 
LeSabre's design and the layout of the plant to make it easier for workers on 
the assembly line to consistently build quality cars. 
</P>
<P>
"That plant had been over-engineered," Battenberg said. "There were too many 
robots and too much automation. There were just too many variables in a 
brand-new plant, so we tried to minimize the variables by taking out 
automation." 
</P>
<P>
Management also proved willing to scale back on some of its overly ambitious 
attempts to copy Japanese labor policies. An early, unsuccessful attempt to 
introduce the Japanese practice of andon -- allowing workers to pull a cord at 
their workstation to shut down the line when things went wrong -- was modified. 
At first, workers unaccustomed to such power had pulled the cord constantly, 
leading to repeated stops and starts; later, a yellow warning cord was added, 
so that workers could call for help without shutting down the line because of 
minor glitches. 
</P>
<P>
But the turnaround at Buick City did not really begin until management and 
labor started to share a new sense of urgency about their plight. 
</P>
<P>
To foster that sense of urgency and to make it clear to the work force that GM 
was serious about quality, Battenberg started shutting down the plant -- and 
sending its workers home -- whenever quality sagged. In addition, all outside 
visitors were barred from the plant for a year to "refocus people on quality," 
Battenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to stress to the organization that their future depended on selling 
world-class quality," he added. "So we set some demanding standards for 
quality." 
</P>
<P>
The United Auto Workers and local community leaders were brought in to try to 
boost the spirit of teamwork and to deal with absenteeism, and drug and alcohol 
abuse at the plant; absenteeism dropped by 40%. A new problem-solving method 
helped speed the process of turning management and labor into more of a team. 
</P>
<P>
The full-court press at Buick City quickly started to show results. Quality 
turned around, and by late 1988 GM's own internal quality surveys showed the 
plant was one of its best. Now, GM says its warranty costs on the LeSabre have 
dropped 59% since 1986, while the number of defects per car has fallen 77%. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the J. D. Power survey was released, quality levels at Buick City 
had surpassed those of GM's joint venture with Toyota in Fremont, Calif., which 
had previously produced the highest-quality cars inside GM. 
</P>
<P>
"The (Buick City) plant was really running rough in 1986, but now it is one of 
the smoothest-running plants in the industry," Battenberg said proudly. 
</P>
<P>
GM hopes to transfer what it has learned at Buick City to its other assembly 
plants, but some outside analysts are still not convinced that GM has made the 
fundamental changes in its system needed to maintain high levels of quality. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Cedergren, an automotive analyst at J. D. Power, says he won't be sure 
that the Buick LeSabre has really changed until he sees where the LeSabre ranks 
in Power's 1990 quality survey. 
</P>
<P>
He remains cautious because the other two GM cars that share the LeSabre's 
basic design -- the Pontiac Bonneville and the Oldsmobile Delta 88 -- have not 
fared as well as the LeSabre in independent quality surveys. If basic changes 
in the car's design were made to improve the LeSabre's quality, Cedergren 
argues, such alterations should also have benefited the Bonneville and Delta 
88, which were being built at plants in Willow Run, Mich., and Wentzville, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
But the Delta 88 came in 58th and the Bonneville 82nd in the same survey of 154 
models that ranked the LeSabre second. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, it seems that the improved quality of the LeSabre came instead from a 
gritty determination on the assembly line -- which is more difficult to sustain 
than a good design, Cedergren observed. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese theories about quality would tend to support Cedergren's concerns; 
engineers in Japan constantly talk of "building in" quality early in the design 
process to minimize the chances that problems will crop up later on the 
assembly line. 
</P>
<P>
The LeSabre's high ranking "could be just a fluke," Cedergren warned. "If these 
products all had a high level of quality engineered into their 'basic design' 
platform, then they should all have been relatively close in the rankings. 
Instead, these quality levels are based just on the assembly plant, which is 
hard to maintain if quality isn't built in." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the improved labor climate on the assembly line, which played such a 
big role in helping Buick City to better its quality, may suffer a setback this 
year. Dave Yettaw, president of UAW Local 599, which represents Buick City 
workers, says he will campaign for reelection this spring on a platform calling 
for the local to disengage from the plant's joint union-management programs. 
</P>
<P>
He charges that management is using the team concept approach to run roughshod 
over the union. "The teamwork concept is becoming quite shaky at Buick City," 
Yettaw complained. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the LeSabre's high ranking came at a time when it was the only car 
that Buick City was producing. But since then, Delta 88 production has been 
shifted to Buick City, further complicating the plant's production process. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to see how the LeSabre comes out this year," a skeptical Cedergren 
added. "Then I will be more confident."

SHOULD INVESTORS BRACE FOR A MORE VOLATILE MARKET? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL RICHTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the stock market took another tumble Monday, it inevitably made many 
individual investors again wonder whether the market is becoming more volatile 
-- and perhaps too volatile for their financial health. 
</P>
<P>
The question has recently inspired much debate and research. But many who have 
studied the issue have concluded that the wrenching rises and falls shouldn't 
be of great concern to the investors who are willing to invest for the long 
term. 
</P>
<P>
It's not hard to understand what investors find so scary in the market's 
gyrations. For many, memories have still not faded from the Oct. 19, 1987, 
crash, which sliced 508 points from the Dow. Then there was the 190-point 
"mini-crash" of last Oct. 13. And Monday's drop was preceded by a 71.46-point 
drop in the Dow on Jan. 12. 
</P>
<P>
Unquestionably, these daily point swings in the Dow are greater and come more 
swiftly than they used to. But when price changes are analyzed on a percentage 
basis, and over a longer intervals, the story is different. 
</P>
<P>
Ibbotson Associates, an investment research firm in Chicago, has concluded that 
when stock price changes are measured on a minute-to-minute or hour-to-hour 
basis, they are indeed more volatile than they used to be. But when monthly or 
yearly changes in prices are tracked, there's no appreciable difference from 
earlier decades, the research firm says. 
</P>
<P>
Ibbotson studied the daily variations in the prices of the Standard &amp; 
Poor's 500-stock index and found that over the past four years, the index had 
swung more violently than at any time since the 1920s. But the monthly and 
yearly changes in the S&amp;P 500 are only about average, Ibbotson says. 
</P>
<P>
Laurence B. Siegel, a managing director at Ibbotson, says there may be three 
reasons stock prices have become more volatile on a minute-to-minute or 
hour-to-hour basis in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
The use of computers has allowed institutional traders to more quickly analyze 
what's occurring in the financial world and to more quickly buy or sell 
securities or futures once they've decided to act. Also, in the past four 
years, stock prices have been relatively high; investors have been skittish as 
they have considered selling their holdings and taking profits. 
</P>
<P>
Last, so-called program trading techniques may also have contributed to the 
gyrations, Siegel says. He adds, however, that "there is less solid evidence 
that programs are a factor." 
</P>
<P>
To put recent volatility in perspective, Siegel said that October, 1987, was 
only the fifth-most volatile month in the century. 
</P>
<P>
While he discounts the significance of the short-term fluctuations, Siegel 
acknowledges their psychological impact. "Long-term investors aren't hurt by 
daily volatility, but that doesn't make it any easier to swallow when the 
market falls out of bed," Siegel says. 
</P>
<P>
The Paine Webber investment firm has also taken up the volatility question, and 
it concluded after analyzing daily changes in the S&amp;P index that stocks 
were slightly more volatile in the 1980s than in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
One reason for the increased movement, the firm's researchers note, is that in 
the 1980s central banks allowed interest rates to fluctuate more freely without 
intervening. That movement, in turn, brought quicker changes in the securities 
and currency markets. 
</P>
<P>
Also contributing to the greater volatility was the closer meshing of world 
financial markets, they say. Now changes in the markets of one country are more 
likely to have a greater impact abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Joanne Hill, director of derivative-products research at Paine Webber, 
suggested that the stock market's gyrations seem greater in part because the 
daily changes in the Dow index are large. "If we split the Dow, we wouldn't 
feel like things are as volatile as they are," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But analysts say if there is not a long-term increase in volatility, the 
markets are without question unusually unstable this month. They blamed 
investors' insecurities about weak corporate earnings, interest rates and the 
world economy. 
</P>
<P>
And many see more wild swings ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Edward Lavarnway, director of options trading at First Albany Corp., says in 
the past four weeks the S&amp;P 500 index has been about 50% more volatile than 
normal, as judged by the statistical measures called standard deviations. 
"Right now, investors don't know which way to turn," he says.

MERRILL LYNCH POSTS LOSS OF $361 MILLION IN 4TH QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOT J. PALTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., severely battered by the prolonged downturn in the 
securities industry, said Monday that it was reporting a significant net loss 
for its 1989 fourth quarter and the full year because of a $395-million 
after-tax charge to cover costs of restructuring its operations. 
</P>
<P>
The firm, the nation's largest securities brokerage, said the charge resulted 
in a net loss for the fourth quarter of $361.8 million, contrasted with a 
profit of $275.8 million for the same quarter a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
For the full year, Merrill Lynch reported a net loss of $213.4 million, 
contrasted with a profit of $463.2 million for 1988. 
</P>
<P>
However, revenue for the full year reached an all-time high of $11.335 billion, 
up from $9.748 billion in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The charge against earnings, which totaled $470 million pretax, appears to be 
the largest the firm has ever taken. In 1987, it took a $377-million pretax 
charge as a result of a loss incurred in a single day from mortgage-backed 
securities trading. 
</P>
<P>
The firm, as have most on Wall Street, has suffered from the effects of a 
weaker stock market and fierce competition for a smaller amount of business, 
including new competition from commercial banks and overseas firms. In recent 
months, it has announced plans to scrap several lines of business, consolidate 
offices and scale back other operations. 
</P>
<P>
Like other firms such as Shearson Lehman Hutton and Drexel Burnham Lambert, 
Merrill Lynch has begun laying off large numbers of employees. Merrill 
reportedly is planning to lay off at least 3,000 by the end of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"Our 1989 operating results reflect the difficult environment experienced 
industrywide, characterized by a low level of individual investor activity, 
broad-based deterioration of the high-yield (junk) bond market, thinning 
margins in several product areas and intensified competition," Merrill Lynch 
Chairman William A. Schreyer and President Daniel P. Tully said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
The firm said the special one-time charge includes the cost of leases, 
severance payments and writeoffs of assets that have been eliminated or cut 
back. It includes the costs from the sale of its Canadian retail brokerage 
business and its abandonment of certain European securities dealing operations. 
Merrill Lynch said it expects the cutbacks to save it about $100 million per 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The brokerage said that, without the charge, it would have reported a profit of 
$181.6 million for the year and $33.2 million for the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The firm's year-end earnings report shows that commission revenue, interest and 
dividend income, and insurance and asset management revenue were all up for the 
year, while revenue from investment banking and "principal transactions" -- 
securities traded for the firm's own account or held as inventory -- declined. 
</P>
<P>
The decline in revenue from principal transactions presumably reflects a 
markdown of the value of junk bonds that the firm holds. The junk bond market 
has been in a slump for months, following defaults and bankruptcy proceedings 
by several prominent junk bond financed companies. 
</P>
<P>
For the fourth quarter, Merrill's per-share net loss amounts to $3.56, compared 
to net income of $2.59 per share a year earlier. For the full year, the net 
loss equaled $2.31 per share, compared to net income of $4.21 per share in 
1988.

Judge Drops Unocal Lawsuit: A federal judge granted a request by Mesa Limited 
Partnership to drop a lawsuit by Unocal Corp. stemming from Mesa's unsuccessful 
attempt to take over Unocal in 1985. Unocal had sought profits, estimated at as 
much as $181 million, resulting from Mesa's disposal of 6.7 million shares of 
Unocal stock that Mesa exchanged for Unocal debt securities in May, 1985, to 
settle the takeover dispute. A Unocal spokesman said no decision had been made 
whether to appeal the ruling.

L.A.'S UNION STATION SOLD TO SANTA FE PACIFIC REALTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Historic Union Station has been sold and its owners plan extensive improvements 
for the 51-year-old building and possible future development to reestablish the 
nearly 50-acre site as a regional transportation hub, it was announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Fe Pacific Realty said Monday that it bought the 22% interest in the 
downtown station that Union Pacific Railroad has owned since 1939. That's when 
the railroad joined with the Southern Pacific and Santa Fe railroads to build 
the Los Angeles Union Passenger Terminal, as the Spanish-style, art-deco 
flavored depot is formally known. Terms of the deal, which involved an exchange 
of real estate, were not revealed. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Fe Pacific Realty disclosed that in the last month it bought the 44% 
stake held by Southern Pacific for cash on Dec. 31. The value of the deal was 
not revealed. The company also said it traded real estate for the 34% stake 
owned by its sister company and former parent, Santa Fe Pacific Corp., formerly 
known as Santa Fe Southern Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
The convoluted transaction is one of the more minor repercussions of the failed 
merger of the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific railroads. 
</P>
<P>
After that merger was disallowed by the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1987, 
the Southern Pacific Railroad was sold and Chicago-based Santa Fe Pacific was 
radically restructured. Southern Pacific Railroad's new owner, Philip Anschutz, 
began selling some non-rail properties, including the Union Station interest. 
</P>
<P>
"Our acquisition of this landmark property will enable us to initiate an 
extensive improvement plan and to begin urban planning efforts aimed at 
reestablishing the facility as a regional transportation hub," said Vernon B. 
Schwartz, chief executive of Santa Fe Pacific Realty, based in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Future development could include offices, stores and restaurants, said Ted 
Tanner, director of development for the property. But any project must await 
completion of construction of a Metro Rail station there, he said, adding that 
the station won't be finished for about two more years. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Amtrak, which has provided passenger service at Union Station 
since 1971, is about to move into new facilities on the property, which would 
free much of the station for renovation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal here clearly is to maintain and preserve the historic character of 
the building," Tanner said.

MUSICIANS UNION SAYS IT IS PREPARED TO STRIKE; 
</P>
<P>
ENTERTAINMENT: THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF MUSICIANS SAYS IT WILL FIGHT TO KEEP 
A SPECIAL ROYALTY AND A FREE CONCERT FUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUBE SHIVER Jr., TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The entertainment industry, which was hit by a crippling 22-week strike by TV 
and movie writers in 1988, is bracing for a possible walkout by the American 
Federation of Musicians, which has told its 185,000 members that it will strike 
if record companies carry out plans to end payments to two special union funds. 
</P>
<P>
As contract negotiations get under way today, federation officials have said 
they are prepared to fight to keep a special royalty fund as well as the Music 
Performance Trust Fund, set up in 1948 to pay for free live concerts. The 
latter fund has been the subject of a heated dispute at least since 1973, when 
the record industry began arguing that its original purpose -- to provide jobs 
for live concert musicians displaced by the growth of the modern studio-based 
recording industry -- has become obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been put on notice by the (record) companies that their primary 
demands will be the elimination of the Music Performance Trust Fund," said 
President J. Martin Emerson in a letter sent to union members earlier this 
month. "They also seek elimination of the Special Payments Fund. . . . 
Apparently, the companies are intent on inviting a strike." 
</P>
<P>
It is unclear, however, whether musicians will support a strike over the issue. 
The federation says it has 185,000 members, but only about 27,000 of them work 
regularly in the record industry, union officials estimate. 
</P>
<P>
Emerson could not be reached for comment Monday, but a federation spokesmen 
said the union plans to press the issue of maintaining the two funds. A strike 
could delay completion of film and television sound tracks as well as disrupt 
the recording industry. 
</P>
<P>
The Special Payments Fund pays studio musicians based on a complex formula 
devised by the federation and recording industry. The payments, which have 
declined substantially in the past two decades, are similar to the "residuals" 
earned by actors in the film and TV industries. 
</P>
<P>
The Music Performance Trust Fund was established in 1948 as a nonprofit public 
service organization through negotiations with the federation and record 
companies. A royalty fee from the sale of record albums and tapes is paid by 
the record companies to the fund to finance free musical performances at 
veterans' hospitals, schools, nursing homes and other facilities. 
</P>
<P>
While record industry officials say about $320 million has been paid into the 
performance fund since it was created, federation officials say it has received 
less and less industry support in recent years. In 1989, for example, royalty 
fees paid to the fund totaled $8.3 million, compared to $10 million in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Norman Samnick, a New York lawyer who is the record industry's chief 
negotiator, argued that "the (trust) fund has gone beyond its time. We want to 
eliminate the trust fund and cut the" special payment fund. 
</P>
<P>
Samnick also said that the $6.2-billion-a-year record industry has grown large 
enough that it should be able to provide work for displaced musicians, many of 
whom drew their salaries from performing on live radio shows. These displaced 
musicians have already been compensated through the performance trust fund, he 
claimed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like when the plumber comes and fixes the bathroom," Samnick said of the 
recording industry's position, "you don't (then have to) pay every time you 
flush the toilet." 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, former federation President Victor W. Fuentealba was defeated 
in a reelection bid, in part for his failure to press the trust fund issue. And 
this year, for the first time, the union has launched a high-profile campaign 
to win public support for continued funding of the free concerts. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, several record industry officials -- who said they are worried about 
the threat of a walkout -- are trying to speed work on some forthcoming albums 
to avoid being hurt by any possible strike. 
</P>
<P>
A CBS Records official, who declined to be identified, said a musicians strike 
could have as much impact on the record industry as the writers strike had when 
it disrupted TV production, forcing network television executives to scramble 
for replacement programming two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, the industry is worried about it," the official said. "You can't make 
money off of reissues (of albums) forever," the official added. 
</P>
<P>
MUTE CONCERN 
</P>
<P>
Labor Columnist Harry Bernstein says the recording industry is being 
shortsighted in its attempt to end funding for free live musical concerts. D3

LABOR: TRYING TO SILENCE FREE CONCERTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARRY BERNSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unfortunately, the music recording industry is once again trying to dump a 
valuable program that is primarily responsible for sponsoring 35,000 free live 
musical concerts across the country each year -- a million performances since 
they began in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
The American Federation of Musicians will try to block the industry's 
counterproductive move in contract negotiations that start today in New York, 
and they hope to do it without a strike. 
</P>
<P>
The talks involve the six major recording companies, and although they 
negotiate together, each has a separate contract with the union. Small 
companies almost always follow the pattern set by the majors. 
</P>
<P>
The companies want to stop their contributions to a fund that pays musicians to 
play in concerts that are open to the public without charge. 
</P>
<P>
The union's leaders are rightly concerned about the generally declining status 
of live music in this country. Music is being taught less and less in the 
public schools these days, and the loss of those free live concerts could only 
worsen things. 
</P>
<P>
Also at stake are an estimated 300,000 jobs for musicians -- both union and 
non-union -- who are paid mostly out of a small royalty contributed by the 
industry on each record it produces. 
</P>
<P>
Norman Samnick, the industry's chief negotiator, says the concerts are dandy, 
but there's no reason for the record companies (now mostly foreign-owned) to 
continue footing most of the bill for the concerts in the United States and 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
But there is a good reason: It was recorded music that displaced live musicians 
on a massive scale. 
</P>
<P>
In 1942, the rapidly increasing displacement of musicians by records infuriated 
James Caesar Petrillo. He was a short, pugnacious fourth-grade dropout who 
fought with almost anyone, from Chicago gangsters and President Franklin D. 
Roosevelt to members of the union he led with an extremely firm hand from 1940 
to 1958. 
</P>
<P>
Petrillo, who dreamed up the free concert program to cope with the job losses, 
became one of the country's best-known but not best-loved labor leaders after 
he led a bitter, two-year strike to make the dream a reality. 
</P>
<P>
Petrillo argued that since the industry produced the records that were putting 
musicians out of work, it should make amends by paying into what is still 
called the Music Performance Trust Fund that finances the concerts. 
</P>
<P>
The industry flatly rejected Petrillo's proposal and a strike against the 
record companies began. 
</P>
<P>
World War II was raging, and music helped to ease some of the war news. 
Jitterbugging young people were listening to the big bands on records and on 
radio stations that played recorded music. 
</P>
<P>
"Little Caesar," as Petrillo was known, was hated by millions, especially 
teen-agers, for muting the sound of music. 
</P>
<P>
But he ignored the widespread resentment and even orders from the War Labor 
Board to end the strike. He ignored a personal appeal from Roosevelt. The 
Senate launched an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The walkout didn't end, however, until 1944, when the record industry finally 
agreed to put up a small fraction of 1% of its income for the free live 
concerts that quickly became, and remain, a mainstay of live music. 
</P>
<P>
The disgraceful decline in music education in the public schools in recent 
years underlines the need to continue a program that lets millions of 
schoolchildren hear and see live musicians instead of only hearing them on 
records or watching them on television. Adults, too, attend the free concerts, 
held in hospitals, libraries, parks, churches, senior citizen homes and mental 
health centers. 
</P>
<P>
The recording industry has been whittling away at the program for years. Its 
contributions totaled only $7 million last year from an industry gross income 
of $6.2 billion. In 1980, before serious cutting began, they totaled nearly $19 
million. 
</P>
<P>
While the industry contributions form the base of the concerts and are a key to 
their success, they are helped by thousands of local governments, businesses, 
unions and community groups that co-sponsor the concerts. 
</P>
<P>
There was almost a strike over the issue in 1987, but it was averted when the 
union's then-president, Victor W. Fuentealba, agreed to yet another cut in the 
industry contributions. 
</P>
<P>
The cut was approved by a vote of recording industry members after a bitter 
internal union fight and after Fuentealba warned the musicians they could never 
win a strike. He said there were too many potential strikebreakers among the 
union's 185,000 members, since only about 15% of them earn enough to make a 
living from music. 
</P>
<P>
Fuentealba was defeated for reelection largely because of what the members felt 
was his sellout on the concert issue. Although the union has publicly said it 
is a strike issue, its new president, J. Martin Emerson, knows such a strike 
would be almost impossible to win. As an alternative he has started a 
nationwide campaign for public support. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign has these simple themes: the concerts are extremely valuable; the 
industry should help sponsor them because records eliminated most live music, 
and the industry can easily afford to continue and even increase its 
contributions. Emerson doesn't hesitate to add a neat extra thrust to reach 
those who worry about the increasing influence on the United States of the 
Japanese and other foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
Only two of the six record companies that control 96% of the American music 
market are still American-owned. Emerson says maybe that is why Sony of Japan, 
which owns CBS Records, and the other firms don't think it's important to spend 
a little money to benefit their best customers, the American and Canadian 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the musicians' campaign may help them win their dispute with the 
industry without a strike. It is certainly one of the few union disputes that 
is likely to win widespread public sympathy.

DREXEL BUYOUT OFFICIAL VANISHES AFTER REPORT; 
</P>
<P>
TAKEOVERS: JEFFREY BECK, WHO PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN THE BEATRICE AND RJR/NABISCO 
DEALS, DISAPPEARED AFTER A NEWS STORY SAID HE USED FALSE TALES OF MILITARY 
HEROICS AND A POTENTIAL INHERITANCE IN HIS PITCHES TO CUSTOMERS.

A top Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. investment banker who played a significant 
role in some of the largest corporate takeover fights of the 1980s apparently 
has gone into hiding after a newspaper account on Monday that claimed he had 
lied repeatedly to customers and co-workers about his own background. 
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal reported that Jeffrey Beck, 43, nicknamed "Mad Dog," 
had made up elaborate stories about military service in Vietnam, including 
tales of heroism, war wounds and decorations. But the newspaper claimed that 
Beck had never been on active military service. The report also said Beck 
falsely claimed that he was heir to a fortune in the billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
The well-connected investment banker reportedly used the tales of his war 
heroism as part of his pitch to customers -- individuals involved in leveraged 
buyouts or corporate takeover battles whom he persuaded to turn to Drexel for 
investment banking services. Beck was regarded as one of the top "rain makers" 
in investment banking, able to drum up hugely profitable merger and acquisition 
business for Drexel. 
</P>
<P>
Beck played a key role in two of the largest leveraged buyouts ever, those of 
Beatrice Cos. and RJR/Nabisco. He enjoyed a close professional relationship 
with Henry Kravis, a principal of the leveraged buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis 
Roberts &amp; Co. He also was credited with getting Drexel hired in the 
takeover fights for Federated Department Stores and Pillsbury. 
</P>
<P>
The disclosures, if true, mark a significant new embarrassment for Drexel, 
which has been reeling from the criminal prosecution of its former junk bond 
chief, Michael Milken, the fallout from the firm's own guilty plea to 
securities fraud charges and from the depressed state of the junk bond market. 
</P>
<P>
A Drexel spokesman, Steven Anreder, refused to discuss the specifics of the 
Wall Street Journal article. But he said Beck had "preliminarily tendered a 
resignation a couple of weeks ago." He said Beck didn't give a reason for 
wanting to resign, and the matter was left unresolved after a couple of initial 
talks with senior Drexel executives. Anreder said Drexel since then has been 
unable to find or talk with Beck. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been unable to be in contact with him since then," Anreder said. He 
refused to say if Drexel is now inclined to accept the resignation. 
</P>
<P>
Beck couldn't be found by The Times for comment. A secretary in his office said 
she had heard from him by telephone shortly before a reporter called. But she 
said she did not know where he was and confirmed that Drexel officials had been 
unable to get in touch with him.

LOTUS FOUNDER, AT NEW OUTFIT, DEBUTS PRODUCT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly three years, $4 million and an entire business strategy later, the 
company formed by departed Lotus Development Corp. founder Mitchell D. Kapor 
has introduced its first software product. 
</P>
<P>
The program, unveiled Monday by Kapor's new firm, On Technology, is designed to 
help users of Macintosh personal computers better organize files and data 
stored in their machines. Although the product, called On Location, has already 
been hailed by reviewers, analysts said it is not likely to reach the superstar 
status of Kapor's first program, Lotus 1-2-3, the best-selling personal 
computer software program ever written. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the introduction of On Location is a milestone of no small 
proportions for Kapor, a 39-year-old Yale University graduate and former rock 
and roll disc jockey who founded Lotus Development in 1978 and introduced the 
popular Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet program just three years later. 
</P>
<P>
Kapor left Lotus in 1986, citing its huge size and growing impersonal corporate 
culture. Within months, he had opened On Technology and announced grandiose, 
but vague, plans to develop an advanced and highly sophisticated personal 
computer software system. However, two years later, Kapor scrapped those plans 
and said the company would instead concentrate on smaller and specific 
applications programs, such as the product unveiled Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"This is what we are," Kapor said. "We're going to find niches where there are 
real problems and we're going to offer the best solutions we can." 
</P>
<P>
Kapor acknowledges that he, and the notoriety he generated at Lotus, are key 
ingredients to the success of the new strategy. "Certainly there's a curiosity 
factor. Certainly people are interested in what we're doing because of who I 
am." 
</P>
<P>
But Kapor said his public persona should be sufficient to draw attention to the 
company in the increasingly crowded pack of software developers. After that, he 
said, the products have to speak for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
So far, early reviews of On Location, which is expected to be available next 
month for $130, are favorable. Richard Shaffer, editor of a personal computer 
newsletter in New York, pronounced the product a "hit" in his most recent 
issue.

DOWNEY S&amp;L PLANS TO SELL REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS; 
</P>
<P>
THRIFTS: THE NEWPORT BEACH COMPANY SAYS IT WILL START BEHAVING MORE LIKE A 
COMMERCIAL BANK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Capitulating to new federal rules governing thrift industry investments, Downey 
Savings &amp; Loan Assn. said Monday that it will sell nearly $600 million 
worth of real estate investments over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
And as it unloads its real estate holdings, Downey will begin acting "more like 
a commercial bank than a thrift," stressing short-term commercial and consumer 
loans and downplaying residential mortgage lending, said Maurice L. McAlister, 
president and co-founder of the 33-year-old thrift. 
</P>
<P>
Downey, with $4.1 billion in assets, has 47 branches in California. Based in 
Newport Beach, the company is the fourth-largest S&amp;L headquartered in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
McAlister said Downey continues to meet all three of the new capital 
requirements imposed by the S&amp;L bailout measure last year. 
</P>
<P>
He also said the S&amp;L will establish nearly $21 million in additional 
reserves for 1990 -- a year in which such a charge won't detract much from 
earnings because of tax benefits Downey will realize from its acquisition of 
the insolvent Butterfield S&amp;L in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the increased reserves, McAlister said Downey expects 1990 to be a 
profitable year, in part because of earnings it will realize from the sale of 
"a substantial amount" of its commercial and retail properties. 
</P>
<P>
That property is carried on Downey's books at a gross value of $590 million, 
McAlister said, but it has a fair market value of $763 million. 
</P>
<P>
McAlister also said Downey will report a profit for 1989. The thrift posted a 
$27-million profit for the first six months, followed by a $3.7-million loss 
for the third quarter because of a new accounting requirement that forced it to 
write down the value of a block of mortgage-backed securities it was holding 
for investment purposes.

JAPANESE BANKS SET TO RESUME LOANS TO CHINA

Japanese banks are set to resume lending discreetly to China with the blessing 
of Japan's Ministry of Finance, banking sources said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese bankers said they had received signals recently indicating they would 
be able formally to resume lending to Beijing in February, seven months after 
loans by Japanese and most Western banks were cut off after a government 
crackdown on China's democracy movement. 
</P>
<P>
A loan of $30 million will be granted to one of the eight national Chinese 
import-export corporations in Beijing by a consortium of three Japanese banks, 
sources close to the banks said. 
</P>
<P>
"The (Japanese) Ministry of Finance did not signal any dissatisfaction with the 
deal last week," one source said. 
</P>
<P>
The loan was being arranged by CCIC Finance, a Hong Kong-based joint-venture of 
U.S., Japanese and Chinese banks. 
</P>
<P>
Some Japanese banks have already begun quietly contacting potential Chinese 
borrowers with noncommittal loan proposals, banking sources said. They have 
told Chinese borrowers the range of terms they can expect when lending resumes. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like a Grand Prix, they are almost at the starting line and are 
raring to go," said one source. 
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has hinted it will discuss resumption of loans to China at its 
February board meeting, and a senior delegation from Japanese banks is due in 
China the same month, Japanese bankers said. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said Dai-ichi Kangyo Bank officials had made a special trip to see Hong 
Kong developer Hopewell Holdings' infrastructure project in southern Guangdong 
province, a $1.53-billion ($12-billion Hong Kong) highway that will link Hong 
Kong, Canton and Macao.

FIRM'S TECHNOLOGY COULD HERALD NEW GENERATION OF CELLULAR PHONES

When comic strip hero Dick Tracy needed to call the police chief, he never 
bothered rifling through his pockets for loose change. The famous detective 
simply pushed a few buttons on his two-way wrist radio and, voila, he had 
headquarters on the line. 
</P>
<P>
The comic strip's creators could not have known just how sophisticated 
telephone communications would become in the 1990s. But a young San Diego 
telecommunications company is developing technology that some say will herald a 
new generation of cellular telephones that could make Dick Tracy-like 
communication affordable to the masses. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Communication Sciences in Sorrento Valley is working on a digital voice 
processor that could allow cellular service providers to squeeze more 
conversations onto the already crowded cellular radio waves and thereby bring 
down the cost of owning and using portable and mobile phones. 
</P>
<P>
The 70-employee company, founded in 1987, is by no means the only one working 
on digital technology. But it achieved a major coup earlier this month when it 
landed a $2-million contract with Uniden America, the U.S. subsidiary of Uniden 
Japan, one of the world's largest cellular phone manufacturers. The contract 
calls for Pacific Communication Sciences to create an integrated circuit-based 
voice processor that will go inside Uniden's new digital cellular phone. 
</P>
<P>
If successful, the contract could give Pacific Communication Sciences a 
strategic connection to industry leader Uniden and lead to millions of dollars 
in business, either from licensing its technology or manufacturing components, 
said Michael L. Lubin, executive vice president and co-founder. 
</P>
<P>
The technological leap the cellular phone may soon take would improve service, 
increase capacity and eventually make the expensive device affordable to a much 
broader market, engineers and industry analysts say. The advance involves a 
digital voice-processing technology that is much more efficient than the 
analog-based system now used in cellular phones. 
</P>
<P>
"Digital is the wave of the future," said telecommunications analyst Fred Moran 
of Moran &amp; Associates in Greenwich, Conn. "The costs (of cellular phones 
and service) would come down even without it, but, with digital, they will be 
able to provide services to everyone. Eventually, they'll all be digital." 
</P>
<P>
The $2.5-billion cellular telephone industry nationwide is expected to expand 
substantially when the price of owning and operating a cellular phone comes 
down. The number of cellular phone subscribers, now estimated at about 3.5 
million nationwide, is expected to grow to as many as 20 million by 1995, 
according to a study by Herschel Shosteck Associates in Silver Spring, Md. 
</P>
<P>
The development of digital technology is key to being able to put that many 
people on the system, Shosteck said. Any company that wants to stay in the 
cellular industry is looking toward the digital revolution, he said. But the 
number of companies with the technical competence to make that transition is 
surprisingly small, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"You have an analogy with what happened to long-distance and international 
rates when (U.S.) Sprint came onto the market with optic fiber cable," Shosteck 
said. "Today, people use the long-distance network 10 times more, and carriers 
have had a fourfold increase in revenue." 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the new technology, cellular phone users in major metropolitan 
areas will be less likely to get busy signals when trying to make a cellular 
call during peak hours. The new telephones, which eventually will require a 
complete revamping of the costly cellular ground systems now in place, could be 
available for sale as early as 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what you're seeing is the first step toward true personal 
communications, meaning that your telephone can accompany you wherever you want 
to go," said David Lyon, president of Pacific Communication Sciences. "What 
market researchers tell us is that once any of the system manufacturers add 
digital, almost all of the (cellular phone service providers) will demand to 
add this capacity. It will have an avalanche effect." 
</P>
<P>
For now, the cost of cellular phone service is beyond the reach of most people. 
Local providers charge their customers 40 cents a minute during weekday peak 
hours. That rate, combined with a $35-a-month service charge, means a typical 
customer ends up paying more than $100 a month. 
</P>
<P>
The price of cellular phones, however, has dropped significantly. In 1983, the 
lowest-priced phone cost $2,600, Shosteck said. Six years later, the same phone 
costs about $525. 
</P>
<P>
Cutting the high cost of cellular phones was one of the challenges that spurred 
five ex-M/A-COM Linkabit engineers to found Pacific Communication Sciences in 
April, 1987. When M/A-COM's telecommunications division decided to sell off a 
satellite project the engineers had helped develop from scratch, they decided 
to leave and start their own business. 
</P>
<P>
"When it became clear we didn't know where our future was going, we decided we 
wanted a little more control over our destiny," Lyon said. 
</P>
<P>
The five founders put in about $1.5 million of their own money and since have 
raised about $8 million in venture capital to get the business off the ground. 
Advancing previous innovations at M/A-COM Linkabit, the company soon 
established a reputation as a leader in quality voice-compression technology, a 
key aspect of digital communication. 
</P>
<P>
That technology went into the creation of Clarity, a digital communication 
system made by Pacific Communication Sciences that cuts the costs of 
interoffice communications for corporations with overseas offices. 
</P>
<P>
The company's technology also won for the company a soon-to-be-announced 
contract with the U.S. government to create a scrambling system that would make 
public safety radio channels invulnerable to eavesdropping. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Communication Sciences' revenue is now running at an annualized rate of 
$6 million, mostly from sales of Clarity, Lubin said. The company projects its 
1990 revenue at $8 million to $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Uniden contract, announced Jan. 3, represents just a fraction of Pacific 
Communication's existing business, but could mean millions of dollars in future 
sales, Lubin said. Heading the Uniden project is George M. Peponides, an 
electrical engineer who joined the company after working at Hughes Network 
Systems for five years. 
</P>
<P>
The contract is strictly for research and development, and the terms and 
conditions of supplying the digital components that may be developed have yet 
to be worked out, Lubin said. But, according to Tom Kawada, executive vice 
president of Uniden America, the company will probably buy the rights to the 
digital component from Pacific Communication Sciences and manufacture it at 
Uniden's Ft. Worth plant. 
</P>
<P>
The new phone, which will first be created for the car phone market, will be 
more expensive to manufacture than current models, but those costs probably 
will not be passed on to the consumer, Kawada said, adding: "It's kind of a 
funny market. Right now, we sell our phones to the service providers for $450. 
But they typically sell them for $299. The telephone company gives rebates to 
the retailer."

VALLEY ROUNDUP: COSTA MESA FIRM SELLS OFF SYNCOR INTERNATIONAL STOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Costa Mesa drug manufacturer has sold its 8.3% stake in Syncor International 
Corp., a Chatsworth company that supplies radioactive pharmaceuticals to 
hospitals and doctors. 
</P>
<P>
ICN Pharmaceuticals said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that it 
sold the 868,000 shares between Jan. 3 and Jan. 8 for between $7.75 and $8 
each. 
</P>
<P>
ICN had been rumored to be interested in a possible buyout of Syncor. In 
November, Syncor adopted a shareholder rights plan -- a common takeover defense 
often referred to as a "poison pill." However, Syncor said the move was not in 
response to any specific takeover threat. 
</P>
<P>
Syncor's stock closed Friday at $8.125, up 12.5 cents.

VIOLINIST SHERYL STAPLES WITH CHAMBER ORCHESTRA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HETTMANSBERGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the seemingly endless proliferation of chamber orchestras, one needed a 
good reason to attend a performance Sunday afternoon by our latest local 
entrant, the Southern California Chamber Orchestra. But one wasn't provided by 
founder Clyde Mitchell or his fledgling ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, soloist Sheryl Staples turned what might have been a frustrating, 
run-of-the-mill affair into a memorable experience. 
</P>
<P>
Her performance of the Violin Concerto No. 1 in G minor by Max Bruch gave every 
indication that her enormous potential is nearing fulfillment. Except for 
lacking the last measure of interpretive maturity in building the Adagio from 
start to finish, one waited in vain for any sign that the young artist was not 
taking the full measure of the work. 
</P>
<P>
The incessant double stops of the outer movements never posed problems, and the 
exceedingly rich, vibrant tone Staples produces perfectly matched the work's 
lush phrases. Mitchell's accompaniment suited her impassioned approach without 
any miscalculation of balances -- no small feat in the United University Church 
at USC. 
</P>
<P>
But the acoustical deficiencies thoroughly sabotaged the young ensemble in 
their ensuing attempt at Beethoven's "Eroica" Symphony. The cavernous hall made 
the 42-member group seem twice as large with a resultant sound of half the 
clarity one would hope for -- or else why perform this work with a reduced 
size, modern instrument group at all? 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, neither Mitchell nor his orchestra (about half of whose 
members are USC students) have garnered enough experience to provide any new 
insights into this landmark work. They fared well though in an energetically 
controlled Scherzo, and the last third of the Marcia Funebre gave ample 
evidence that both orchestra and conductor may yet produce memorable 
performances sans soloists. 
</P>
<P>
The Overture to Mozart's "Don Giovanni" opened the concert, revealing that 
Mitchell does possess a true gift for sustaining a legato line. GREG

BALLETMET WINS NEW FANS WITH COUNTY DEBUT

<TEXT>
<P>
BalletMet, which performed Sunday afternoon at McKinney Theatre on the 
Saddleback College campus, is the kind of regional dance company that wins 
people over to ballet. The 22 dancers are lithe, fleet and personable, and they 
seem to be genuinely enjoying themselves. The repertory is essentially 
contemporary, stressing humor, lyricism and an athletic ease. 
</P>
<P>
For its first Orange County appearance, the Ohio-based company left the 
Balanchine and Paul Taylor at home and chose not to offer a new James Kudelka 
work that's on the program elsewhere on the three-week West Coast tour. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, we got a taste of the style of company artistic director John McFall 
in "Beyond Midnight"; "Shinju," a 15-year-old exercise in balleticized Japanese 
ritual drama by McFall's mentor, former San Francisco Ballet artistic director 
Michael Smuin, and the good-humored, if long-winded, antics of Lynne 
Taylor-Corbett's "Great Galloping Gottschalk," to the Latin-flavored music of 
Louis Moreau Gottschalk. 
</P>
<P>
McFall's piece, danced to Gabriel Faure's Piano Quartet No. 1, does have its 
charms. Among them are the white turn-of-the-century style dresses for the 
women (the handiwork of Victoria Gyorfi, a former San Francisco Ballet dancer), 
which make all the languorous turns and lifts look especially lovely. 
</P>
<P>
The steps take full advantage of the upper-body pliancy of the 10 dancers, as 
well as their ability to look into each others' eyes and suggest that something 
romantic is actually transpiring. But all the melting fluidity in the world 
can't make up for a lack of structure and development. 
</P>
<P>
By the third movement, McFall seemed to have run out of ideas. A startlingly 
misplaced gymnastics sequence (a woman dragged downstage by two men suddenly 
vaults up over their shoulders) suggested the well of inspiration was very dry 
indeed. 
</P>
<P>
The woman -- tiny, quicksilver Catherine Yoshimura -- was a delight, however. 
Rapturously romantic and soft-edged in "Beyond Midnight," she was an impish 
sprite in "Gottschalk," a human barnacle clinging for dear life to one man in a 
whirling circle of dancers. One wonders what she would have done with the 
sweetly stoic geisha in "Shinju." 
</P>
<P>
Paige Fulleton navigated the role's small vocabulary of shyly angled movements 
(feet flex, knees bend, the head tilts) with great delicacy and control but 
without conveying much intensity of feeling. Todd Woffinden, her stolid samurai 
hunk, lacked the power and toughness that would be second nature to a 
professional warrior. 
</P>
<P>
The sinister aura of the stern bit players surrounding the doomed lovers was 
also in need of weightier, darker notes. 
</P>
<P>
The striking visual effects (by Willa Kim) and the spare, suitably exotic music 
(by Paul Chihara) still weave a persuasive spell around this essentially hokey 
piece. The double suicides -- Romeo and Juliet meet Bonnie and Clyde -- come 
complete with writhing bodies and leaping red ribbons of blood. 
</P>
<P>
"Gottschalk" was a breezy send-off, with the right-on-the-mark comedic timing 
of Michael Cornell and Daren Savage, the warmly romantic playfulness of 
Elizabeth Zengara and Armando Luna, and the pertly audience-conscious clowning 
of Anastasia Glimidakis, Patti Owen and Andrea Hodge.

CRUELTY ON A LONG LEASH IN JAPANESE 'HARRAS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Harras" (at the Little Tokyo Cinemas) is yet another of those 
ultra-sentimental animal pictures so beloved by the Japanese. However, not only 
is it predictably tedious and smarmy, it is also -- unintentionally and 
unattractively -- the story of a couple who never learn how to care for the dog 
they supposedly love like the child they never had. 
</P>
<P>
Consider this: The couple are the unexpected but not ungrateful recipients of 
an adorable little puppy, which the husband names Harras. As they sit reading 
in their comfortable suburban living room every evening, they let Harras bark 
and cry, chained outside, until the neighbors complain. The husband reacts by 
beating the puppy severely. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve years pass, and the husband decides to give Harras a treat by taking him 
along on a trip to a ski resort in the dead of winter. You guessed it: The 
now-elderly dog gets lost in the snow. Miraculously, he survives, but the 
following year is afflicted with a tumor the veterinarian is convinced is 
malignant. Do the couple humanely put Harras to sleep? Of course not; it never 
even occurs to them to do so, which means we have to watch Harras suffer until 
he at last mercifully dies. 
</P>
<P>
It is depressing to note that "Harras," which plays as one long contrivance, 
was written by Tora-san creator Yoji Yamada and his longtime writing partner, 
Yoshitaka Asama, but directed (routinely) by Tomio Kuriyama. In this synthetic 
heart-tugger (Times-rated Mature), the various dogs who play Harras lend the 
only natural touch to the film. Go Kato, who plays the obtuse husband, and 
Yukiyo Toake, cast as his highly emotional wife, are veteran professionals who 
deserve all our compassion.

NEO-NAZI DRAMA DEFEATED BY A WEAK SCRIPT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG, TIMES TELEVISION CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"So Proudly We Hail" is billed as a movie about the rise of neo-Nazism in the 
United States. However real that threat, this story lacks a script and 
characters credible enough to make it come alive on the screen. 
</P>
<P>
It airs at 9 tonight on CBS (Channels 2 and 8). 
</P>
<P>
Writer-director-executive producer Lionel Chetwynd creates parallel stories -- 
one involving anthropology professor James Wagner (Edward Herrmann) and another 
involving three young drifters (Chad Lowe, Billy Morrissette and Peter Dobson) 
-- and then merges them as these characters become human chess pieces 
manipulated by white supremacist Alden Ernst (David Soul) and his smirking 
nephew (Raphael Sbarge). 
</P>
<P>
Chetwynd has shaped these casualties to fit his apparent thesis that the new 
Nazi leadership is smooth and shrewd enough to victimize and exploit discontent 
in a broad cross section of Americans, ranging from the uneducated to liberal 
intellectuals like Wagner. It's something to think about. 
</P>
<P>
However, everything and everyone here -- including the soft-headed media -- are 
almost comically obvious. The victims are script-serving setups, the least 
believable of whom is Wagner, an incredibly naive boob who so easily falls prey 
to Ernst and his Nazi temptress cohort (Harley Jane Kozak) that he appears 
brain dead. 
</P>
<P>
By trivializing Wagner, the story trivializes the danger. Equally injurious are 
such fanciful sidebars as Ernst's girlfriend -- whose Nazi sympathies seems 
obvious to everyone but Wagner -- being able to plant the simpleton professor 
on a prestigious network show patterned after "Nightline." As he is being 
interviewed, she is given the run of the control room like an insider. 
</P>
<P>
The performances are perfunctory, the direction without dramatic edge and the 
story lacking in anything that hasn't been said before -- and said better.

RICK DU BROW: 'ELVIS' VERSUS LANSBURY: IT'S NOW OR NEVER

TV or not TV. . . . 
</P>
<P>
CHALLENGE: Is "Murder, She Wrote," CBS' top hit, ready to be taken? 
</P>
<P>
ABC thinks so -- and believes it has the guns in two new series, "America's 
Funniest Home Videos" and "Elvis." 
</P>
<P>
"Videos" has already shown ratings muscle in several outings. "Elvis" is about 
Elvis Presley as a young man. 
</P>
<P>
And ABC will fire the two half-hour series against "Murder, She Wrote" as a 
Sunday tandem starting Feb. 11. 
</P>
<P>
It's not the first challenge for "Murder, She Wrote." NBC tossed "Family Ties" 
against it, but the Angela Lansbury detective yarn held its ground. 
</P>
<P>
And Lansbury's amazing drawing power could well pull her through again. 
</P>
<P>
But ABC will give "Elvis" -- starring Michael St. Gerard -- a whopping sendoff 
with a Feb. 6 preview following No. 1 "Roseanne." 
</P>
<P>
Priscilla Presley, the singer's former wife, is one of the executive producers 
of "Elvis." 
</P>
<P>
BIG: Now that Roseanne Barr's got a new husband (over the weekend) and a new 
producer to keep her happy on "Roseanne," will she suddenly become a little 
buttercup? Nahhhh. She wouldn't be half the star she is if she were 
predictable. 
</P>
<P>
FAREWELL TOUR: Judy Woodruff became host of PBS' "Frontline" after anchor 
Jessica Savitch was killed in a 1983 car accident. And she'll launch tonight's 
season debut of "Frontline" -- about the terrorist bombing of Pan Am flight 103 
over Scotland. But come June, Woodruff is out of there despite her impressive 
growth on the series. Says she wants to spend more time in her reporting role 
on PBS' "MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour." Kudos. 
</P>
<P>
SHOCKER: It's infinitely sad to read of the tragedies of former child actors. 
And the suicide of Rusty Hamer, 42, once the funny and feisty little son on 
"The Danny Thomas Show," is another stunner. Couldn't help thinking of troubled 
Anissa Jones -- the lovely little pig-tailed Buffy on "Family Affair" -- who 
died at 18. 
</P>
<P>
A LITTLE NIGHT MUSIC: Paul McCartney is the subject, on stage and off, when 
CBS' "48 Hours" expands from an hour to 90 minutes Thursday. The conversations 
with the former Beatle took place during his first U.S. tour in 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
IN A WORD, NYET: ABC took out huge ads for last week's Moscow visit by the 
Diane Sawyer-Sam Donaldson show, "Prime Time Live." Leading with its chin, the 
network described it as "a broadcast you can't possibly say nyet to." Oh my. 
The show died with just 15% of the viewing audience. It got creamed by "L.A. 
Law" and "Knots Landing." 
</P>
<P>
BALLOON PAYMENTS: "Saturday Night with Connie Chung" and "Prime Time Live" came 
in 74th and 75th among 86 shows in last week's ratings. What does that tell you 
about the value of anchor salaries? 
</P>
<P>
SLEEPERS: On the other hand, CBS' unheralded "Jake and the Fatman" cracked the 
top 30 last week. And ABC's "Coach," which replaced "Chicken Soup," seems to be 
building steam in its back-to-back pairing with "Roseanne." 
</P>
<P>
FUTURE PERFECT: Keep an eye on Jay Leno's 1989 prediction that Home Shopping 
Network will merge with C-SPAN "for those of you who want the convenience of 
buying a politician in the privacy of your own home." Seems particularly 
appropriate for California these days. 
</P>
<P>
REVENGE: Sportscaster Scott St. James, fired by KCAL Channel 9, plays a TV 
station manager in ABC's upcoming "Equal Justice" series and says, "To get into 
character, I'm refusing to return phone calls." 
</P>
<P>
FAST BREAK: Biggest kick in TV sports these days is watching the Clippers 
suddenly come of age. 
</P>
<P>
EXECUTIVE SUITE: Now that Barbara Corday has split from CBS as head of 
prime-time programs, how long will it be before another woman reaches that 
level in male-dominated network TV? 
</P>
<P>
CLASS ACT: Did you catch last week's vivid NBC drama, "Blue Bayou," by 
producer-writer Terry Louise Fisher, co-creator of "L.A. Law"? Real series 
possibilities in "Blue Bayou," which starred the superb Alfre Woodward as an 
L.A. district attorney who moves to New Orleans with her son. 
</P>
<P>
MORNING LINE: Sunday's San Francisco-Denver showdown will be among the 
highest-rated TV shows ever because all Super Bowls are -- but the champ is 
still the 1983 finale of "MASH." It scored an unreal 60.3 rating and attracted 
77% of the national TV audience. 
</P>
<P>
PRIME CHOICE: After our item suggesting that TV carry Cal State Long Beach 
football because George Allen's the new coach, Prime Ticket called to say it 
was doing just that -- at least three games this fall. On the other hand, the 
channel also reminded us it carried three of the team's games this past season 
before Knute -- I mean George -- began his reign. 
</P>
<P>
OBSERVER: Reader Barbara Bartole of La Habra says James ("Gunsmoke") Arness and 
the Rev. Billy Graham are look-alikes. "Must be the noses," she writes. 
</P>
<P>
ALL-PRO: Bill Murray's low-life saloon singer in those "Saturday Night Live" 
reruns gets cheapness down to a level where it's never been before. Caught him 
singing "Thank Heaven for Little Girls" to a group of feminists -- Jane Curtin, 
Gilda Radner and Laraine Newman. 
</P>
<P>
AROUND THE BEND: Saigon and Vietnam look pretty distant and real when you watch 
them on "Tour of Duty" -- especially considering the show is shot in the Santa 
Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
BEING THERE: "History is mostly killin' people." Who said it? Beaver Cleaver in 
"Leave It to Beaver." 
</P>
<P>
Say good night, Gracie. . . .

8 ESCAPES STIR BID TO UPGRADE INS FACILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS and ELIZABETH LU, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Embarrassed officials of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service are 
scrambling to upgrade the security at a Los Angeles detention center that had 
been operating for less than a week when eight women escaped by breaking 
through a barred window to freedom Christmas Eve. 
</P>
<P>
One of the escapees, a Chinese woman who later surrendered because she is 
seeking political asylum in the United States, said she felt compelled to bust 
out because of what she said were poor conditions at the recently opened 
facility near MacArthur Park. The woman, Chen Wanpeng, said there was a lack of 
blankets for detainees at night and no opportunities to take showers. 
</P>
<P>
Officially, INS officials said they are working with Transitional Housing Inc., 
a Long Beach company contracted to operate the closed detention center, to 
correct "security problems" and make "other needed contractual improvements." 
</P>
<P>
Privately, some within the agency, noting that none of the 50 or so men 
detained there escaped, are a bit embarrassed that the facility had to be 
closed so quickly after it opened Dec. 18. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, we just opened the place and these women got away," one INS agent said. 
"But we're working on it so nobody else gets away . . . I hope." 
</P>
<P>
Like other law enforcement agencies, the INS is pressed by problems of 
overcrowding at its various detention facilities. The record number of aliens 
apprehended throughout Southern California has forced the agency to turn motels 
and apartment houses into holding centers for deportable aliens. 
</P>
<P>
The placement of such facilities, particularly one in a largely immigrant 
community in Hollywood in 1986, has drawn the ire of Latino activists and 
others. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, the INS awarded a $2-million contract for the operation of a 
detention center in the heart of Los Angeles' burgeoning immigrant population. 
It chose a 30-year-old stucco building at 1115 S. Alvarado St. that had been a 
nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
Renovations were made to accommodate up to 253 detainees. INS officials said 
the two-story building eventually would include recreational and educational 
opportunities for the detained aliens. English-language teachers were even 
assigned to the center. 
</P>
<P>
Without much fanfare, Transitional Housing Inc. opened the detention center a 
week before Christmas. But it turned out to be too soon. 
</P>
<P>
"They said they were ready," said Robert M. Moschorak, INS' acting Los Angeles 
district director. "Apparently, they were not as prepared as they said they 
were." 
</P>
<P>
At 8:45 p.m. on Dec. 24, officials said some of the women detainees had pushed 
open a window that was not secured and bent two bars of the window's security 
frame. Weakening the frame made the bars easy to bend, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Eight women climbed through the window and escaped. 
</P>
<P>
Two days later, the center was closed for repairs. Of the 90 aliens being held 
there at the time of the escape, 22 have been transferred to an INS detention 
center in El Centro and the rest were released on their own recognizance. 
</P>
<P>
Chen, who was apprehended by the INS upon arrival at Los Angeles International 
Airport in October, said she escaped because she did not want to be left 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very cold (there)," said Chen, who is now staying with Chinese-speaking 
families in the area while her petition for asylum is being considered. 
</P>
<P>
She said there were no amenities -- such as blankets and access to showers -- 
at the Alvarado Street center. She also said there were restrictive rules 
regarding the use of pay telephones. 
</P>
<P>
Chen said none of these problems occurred at an INS detention center in 
Inglewood, where she was first taken by authorities. There are several such 
facilities throughout Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
What upset her the most about the Alvarado Street center, Chen said, was that a 
male guard would spend the night in the cell where she and three other women 
slept. Although nothing occurred, Chen said his presence frightened her. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Edwards, president of Transitional Housing Inc., rejected Chen's 
assertions. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing of that nature ever happened," Edwards said. "It's nothing but 
hearsay. It would have taken a conspiracy of a number of employees for that to 
happen. I can't imagine that type of conspiracy happening." 
</P>
<P>
He also said there were blankets and showers available for any of the detainees 
who asked for them. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards was perturbed as the INS' characterization of the facility as a 
detention center. It is a "processing center," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If they choose to leave, they can," he said. "I'm not going to prevent anyone 
who wants to leave." However, he conceded, if they do leave they will 
"obviously be violating rules." 
</P>
<P>
Edwards and INS officials said they did not know when the Alvarado Street 
facility would be reopened.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: STATE KNEW BUS DRIVER HAD DRUNK-DRIVING 
RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State officials knew more than a month ago that a school bus driver charged 
last week with drunk driving while trying to pick up a load of students in 
Encino had applied for his driver's license using an alias and had an extensive 
criminal record. 
</P>
<P>
But state Department of Justice policies -- designed to protect the rights of 
those accused of crimes -- kept that agency's officials from passing the 
information on to the California Highway Patrol or the Department of Motor 
Vehicles, which had issued Harold Keith Lone a temporary school bus driver's 
certificate, Assemblyman Richard Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Lone, who had been convicted of drunk driving five times, was 
allowed to continue driving a bus.

If you set out to find the Person of the Century, the names Mark Spitz, Donald 
Trump and Michael Jackson might not come immediately to mind. Well, at least 
not Spitz and Trump. 
</P>
<P>
But they are among the 89 personages nominated by the Walt Disney Co., which 
will survey customers at its amusement parks over the next decade in what it 
calls "the longest-running poll ever conducted" to find "the individual who has 
made the greatest impact on the 20th Century." 
</P>
<P>
The candidates, which Disney said were compiled from a list of recommendations 
by college presidents, represent a curious mixture of world leaders, 
politicians, scientists, executives, athletes, entertainers and literati 
(including writer Virginia Woolf, whose name was spelled "Wolfe" in the 
announcement). 
</P>
<P>
Alas, L.A.'s most famous entertainer/politician -- Ronald Reagan -- was left 
off the list. 
</P>
<P>
While the Disney company forbids mustaches or beards among its employees -- 
four members of the staff at the Queen Mary were recently fired for such 
offenses -- it did accept the nominations of such proponents of facial hair as 
Walt Disney (mustache) and George Bernard Shaw and Andrew Carnegie (beards). 
</P>
<P>
It's difficult to tell who the favorite would be in the Person of the Century 
balloting. Disneyland visitors, after all, may have a unique perspective. How 
many 8-year-olds, for instance, will choose Albert Einstein or Thomas Edison 
over, say, Michael Jackson? 
</P>
<P>
One more question: Will Elvis vote for himself? 
</P>
<P>
Newspapers in the state of Washington have taken to decrying the trend of 
fleeing Angelenos who purchase beautiful spreads in the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
The panic seems to be mounting there. Now, Washingtonians are turning on 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle Times columnist Erik Lacitis recently discovered that many residents 
have advertised properties in the L.A. Times. He added facetiously: "Of course, 
we Northwesterners could never be accused of such a thing as being hypocrites 
when it comes to all our regionalism." 
</P>
<P>
The city of Paramount, which recently acquired a radar device that flashes the 
speed of passers-by on a screen, employed the machine during a 10-K race over 
the weekend. The fastest runner, William Musyoki, won the 6.2-mile race with an 
average speed of 12.6 m.p.h. No problem with the local gendarmes. As the 
machine points out, the "speed limit is 25." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Alan Cranston has seen his ratings in the popularity polls fall in recent 
weeks as a result of reports of his involvement in the Lincoln Savings &amp; 
Loan scandal. The 75-year-old Cranston, a quarter-miler in his collegiate days 
at Stanford, didn't post great numbers at the Sunkist indoor track meet at the 
Sports Arena the other night, either. He finished fifth and last in the 
50-meter Legends race. 
</P>
<P>
Nonsense, Joe Brito says, to reports that Santa Monica has no official city 
ditty. 
</P>

He writes: "I bring your attention to a song which came out in the 40s:

AL MARTINEZ: A DAY IN THE PARK WITH GINO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
L.A. is a city of light and shadow, of sunny days and scary nights, of 
compassion beyond duty . . . and of madness beyond an ability to comprehend. 
</P>
<P>
Creatures haunt the dark side of community, shapes at the edge of the light 
that move like spirits of violence through our collective conscience, 
confounding the experts, threatening the peace. 
</P>
<P>
There are two worlds here. 
</P>
<P>
One is the world most of us occupy, with families and jobs and the ability to 
function without breaking. 
</P>
<P>
We deal with our problems, cope with our pain and go about our business in a 
manner that neither enhances nor disrupts the public weal. 
</P>
<P>
The other is a world we read about. 
</P>
<P>
Family life shatters in this world and dreams die. Children grow without hope 
and rage burns like fire in the night. 
</P>
<P>
It's a world of guns and violence, where survival, not adjustment, prevails, 
and drugs blur the outlines of castles in the distance. 
</P>
<P>
Gino Rodriguez has lived in both worlds. 
</P>
<P>
What makes him important today is the energy he expends to stay in the world of 
light and the message he imparts to those who remain in the world of darkness. 
</P>
<P>
"Come out," he says to them. "Maybe I can help. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
I met with Gino in West Covina's Gingrich Park on a day of bright sunshine 
laced with the chill of winter. He had telephoned several times to ask for the 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm an ex-con, an ex-junkie and an ex-gang member," I remember him saying 
during one of the calls. "If I can tell kids about what I went through and how 
much I regret it, maybe they can avoid it." 
</P>
<P>
He is a solemn, muscular man of 46, and regret lies over his life like tule fog 
on a riverbed. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-eight of his years have been spent in juvenile halls, jails and prisons. 
He began using heroin at 15 and quit only three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
He has been shot, stabbed and beaten and, in return, has robbed, stolen, dealt 
drugs and committed acts of violence too terrible to admit. 
</P>
<P>
"I did everything you can think of," he said with deliberate ambiguity that day 
in the park, unable to look me in the eye. 
</P>
<P>
"Murder?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
He lit one of many cigarettes he would smoke during the time we talked. 
</P>
<P>
"That too," he said softly. The son of immigrant Mexicans, he was called Chino 
as a boy because of eyes that have an Asian slant. He was born in Vernon and 
raised in East L.A., and almost from the start edged toward the shadow world. 
</P>
<P>
At 10, he began burglarizing homes. "I took stuff I didn't even need," he said. 
"You know, glasses, shavers, things like that. I don't know why. I don't know 
the why of anything." 
</P>
<P>
At 11, he went to Juvenile Hall. Later, he was kicked out of school for 
breaking another boy's ribs in a fight. 
</P>
<P>
"I was sent from school to school," he said. "Nobody wanted me." 
</P>
<P>
During one of many trips to various juvenile halls, Rodriguez became a soldier 
for the Mexican Mafia, organized a gang of his own in the barrio and began 
dealing drugs. 
</P>
<P>
When his own heroin habit grew to $800 a day, he led his gang into robbery to 
support it. 
</P>
<P>
What may be Gino's salvation today is a girl named Yolanda he met and married 
during the depth of his craziness 27 years ago. Five children were born during 
those years. 
</P>
<P>
"She tried to get me to straighten out, to stop using drugs," Rodriguez said, 
"but I thought I knew it all." 
</P>
<P>
His last crime was bank robbery, his last stop federal prison. At Terminal 
Island, an old man who had spent most of his life in prison gave him two words 
of advice: "Grow up." 
</P>
<P>
"I finally came to grips with myself," he said. "Call it burnout, call it 
anything you want, but the old man's words meant something. A new me was born. 
I was ready for the real world." 
</P>
<P>
Out of prison, he moved his family from East L.A. to West Covina. Two children 
still live at home. Thanks to Yolanda, all are making it. They know their 
father's history, and he hopes they forgive him for it. 
</P>
<P>
He works at whatever jobs he can find and coaches a teen-age baseball team on 
weekends. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez recognizes how tenuous is the will that keeps him in the light and 
how necessary it is to have help. He wants to apply that knowledge to the kids 
still in the shadow world and is trying to figure out how. 
</P>
<P>
Talking about it is one way. 
</P>
<P>
He faced me directly for the first time during our conversation. "Before I 
die," he said evenly, "I want to be able to say I did something good." 
</P>
<P>
Then he sat there in silence for a long time on a day radiant with sunlight, 
pondering the remembered darkness.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EX-HOSPITAL OFFICIAL, TWO SONS GET PRISON FOR 
FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former administrator of an Inglewood hospital and two of his sons were 
sentenced to prison Monday for their roles in a false billing and kickback 
scheme that defrauded local hospitals and businesses out of millions of 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Donald A. Wright Sr., 57, former director of engineering at Daniel Freeman 
Memorial Hospital, was sentenced to three years in prison, fined $100,000 and 
ordered to pay $23,799 in restitution to the hospital.

EXTORTION BY 3 AT TABLOID ALLEGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN H. LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The three staff members of a tabloid that published a sensational series of 
articles on business improprieties in Koreatown and then allegedly demanded 
money to discontinue the reports have been arrested on suspicion of extortion, 
authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The staffers of Ka Ju News -- which during 2 1/2 years of publication has 
featured headlines such as, "A Scene Out of a Brawling Western: Customers in 
Korean-Owned Restaurant Are Threatened With Sushi Knife, Then Handcuffed and 
Beaten" -- were arrested Thursday and each booked for investigation of two 
counts of extortion and two counts of attempted extortion. 
</P>
<P>
Publisher Tae Kyun Kim, 45; chief reporter Sang Suk Kim, 31, and editor Kook 
Kyun Chung, 32, denied involvement in the alleged extortion. 
</P>
<P>
They said the allegations are attempts at retaliation by disgruntled businesses 
whose practices were challenged by investigative pieces published in the paper. 
The three men were released Thursday after posting $5,000 bail each. 
Arraignment was set for Feb. 8. 
</P>
<P>
Police have been investigating allegations of extortion committed by several 
Korean-language newspapers since the spring of last year, said Detective Ray 
Futami. 
</P>
<P>
In a similar but unrelated case, Korean business owners told police in 
September that the publisher and two staff members of the California Peace News 
-- an infrequent, makeshift newsletter -- had pressured advertisers into paying 
exorbitant rates for unwanted ad space. 
</P>
<P>
When victims refused to pay ad fees, damage to their property or physical 
threats followed. The three suspects pleaded either guilty or no-contest to 
charges of extortion and arson and are currently serving sentences of a minimum 
of one year in jail, Futami said. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives said they have been frustrated by the reluctance of victims to 
report extortion. In some cases, police said, Korean business owners were 
resigned to paying the extortion demands, considering them part of the cost of 
doing business. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives said they are continuing to investigate 15 to 20 non-subscription or 
"throwaway" publications for possible extortion activities. 
</P>
<P>
Extortion demands ranged from $300 for advertisement space to $36,000 for a 
seat on Ka Ju News' Board of Directors, said Detective John Byun. 
</P>
<P>
Five Los Angeles businesses filed extortion charges against Ka Ju News -- 
including the Koreatown restaurant where the sushi-knife-wielding chef 
allegedly threatened customers, a used-car dealership that reportedly reneged 
on several warranty contracts and a Korean supermarket whose long-outdated 
snacks reportedly caused a customer stomach problems. 
</P>
<P>
Reporter Kim, who five years ago uncovered a widespread bribery scandal that 
led to Los Angeles County district attorney indictments of a state acupuncture 
licensing official and 47 fraudulently licensed acupuncturists, said Monday 
during an interview at the newspaper's office in the 3000 block of West 6th 
Street that the subjects of Ka Ju's investigations repeatedly have accused the 
newspaper of running an extortion racket. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not the criminals here," Kim said in Korean. "The businesses that we 
have written about -- that have been caught taking advantage of people -- are 
behind the accusations. We just write the truth about what happens in 
Koreatown."

HEALING COMES SLOWLY ON FIRE-SCARRED STREET; 
</P>
<P>
DISASTER: MORE THAN A YEAR AFTER BLAZE, RESIDENTS ARE TRYING TO REBUILD THEIR 
LIVES. AND THEY HAVE FOUND A NEW NEIGHBORHOOD UNITY IN THE PROCESS.

<P>
Thirteen months after a wind-whipped fire charged out of the Santa Susana 
Mountains and into a sleeping neighborhood in Porter Ranch, the physical scars 
are healing. 
</P>
<P>
The blackened slopes north of Granada Hills have given way to brown winter 
brush. On Beaufait Avenue, where the fire exacted its greatest toll, nearly all 
of the 36 damaged homes have been rebuilt or repaired, and most families have 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
Construction crews and trucks still arrive each workday, and the last houses to 
rise from their ashes are just a few months from completion. 
</P>
<P>
But the emotional damage from the blaze has been harder to repair. The victims 
of the Porter Ranch fire say they find solace in one another, in a neighborhood 
closeness forged in the shared experience of the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Ann Friedman recently surveyed the new house built on the spot where her old 
house had stood for 18 years. But in the new one -- bigger, with high ceilings, 
polished wood floors and electrical outlets exactly where she and her husband 
wanted them -- there are few personal belongings. They were all lost in the 
fire. So, to Friedman, the house doesn't feel much like home. 
</P>
<P>
"It just doesn't feel right," she said. "I don't know when it will. We lost 
almost a whole lifetime of belongings. Maybe it will take another lifetime 
until we feel at home." 
</P>
<P>
Despite that uncertainty, Friedman and other residents on Beaufait Avenue look 
back on the past year and can easily find a positive note: The fire left them 
with something they didn't have before, a "real" neighborhood, a place where 
superficial waves and hellos have been replaced with actual bonds of friendship 
among residents. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a sense of place now," said Eric Struthoff, who lost his home to the 
fire and is still waiting for rebuilding to be completed. "It was a fire that 
brought it on, unfortunately, but there is a sense of belonging now. The fire 
has given us a spirit of community." 
</P>
<P>
It was that neighborhood closeness and spirit that was toasted last month at a 
community dinner organized to mark the first anniversary of the fire. About 75 
Beaufait Avenue residents -- casual acquaintances before, close friends now -- 
met at a local restaurant to begin the second year after the fire together. The 
media, which have closely chronicled the neighborhood's destruction and 
rebuilding, were not invited. 
</P>
<P>
"Just residents," Friedman said. "We want to start getting some of our 
anonymity back. We want normal lives." 
</P>
<P>
The residents' anonymity was lost at dawn on Dec. 9, 1988, when Santa Ana winds 
up to 70 m.p.h. pushed flames over the hills northeast of the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, the fire of unknown origin scorched 3,200 acres -- including 
nearly all of 714-acre O'Melveny Park -- and then destroyed 15 houses and 
damaged 25 others. All but four of the houses were on two blocks of Beaufait 
Avenue, an exclusive neighborhood of $400,000 homes built above Aliso Canyon in 
the 1970s.

FEDERAL OFFICIALS HOLD MAN AS CAMARENA CASE WITNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man believed to be a Texas resident is being held by federal authorities in 
Los Angeles as a "material witness" in the ongoing investigation of the 
February, 1985, murder of U.S. drug agent Enrique Camarena, The Times learned 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Jesse Najir Zuno is scheduled to have a bail hearing Friday before U.S. 
District Judge Edward Rafeedie. 
</P>
<P>
Najir Zuno is not related to Ruben Zuno Arce, a Mexican businessman, who is 
scheduled to go on trial Feb. 20 on charges he helped organize plans to kidnap 
and kill Camarena in Guadalajara, Mexico, nearly five years ago, according to 
James Blancarte, one of Zuno Arce's defense lawyers. His client has pleaded not 
guilty and vigorously denied any involvement in the Camarena murder. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Manuel Medrano would say only that Najir Zuno was being 
held and added that he "is not a defendant" at this point. Neither Medrano, 
officials of the Drug Enforcement Agency nor defense lawyer David Reed of 
Beverly Hills would say where Najir Zuno was arrested, but another source close 
to the case said he had been taken into custody last week in El Paso. 
</P>
<P>
Medrano said he could not say anything about Najir Zuno because government 
papers submitted to the court can be read only by Judge Rafeedie. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyer Reed said he would not comment on anything regarding Najir Zuno, 
other than to say, "I'm very troubled and concerned that information about him 
being brought into court as a material witness was released." 
</P>
<P>
Thus far, 16 people have been indicted in Los Angeles in connection with the 
Camarena killing, which was recently the subject of an NBC television 
miniseries. Three men were convicted and sentenced to prison after a 1988 
trial. Federal law enforcement authorities have said that there will be more 
indictments by Feb. 7, the fifth anniversary of the murder and the last date on 
which charges can be filed under the federal statute of limitations.

L.A.'S POOR GET NEW CHANCE TO APPLY FOR CITY RENT SUBSIDIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Housing Authority on Monday reopened enrollment in the popular 
Section 8 rental subsidy program for the poor, and officials said response from 
people hoping to qualify was light but was expected to grow as word spread. 
</P>
<P>
Low-income people who want to be considered for a Section 8 subsidy can call a 
hot line at the Housing Authority or get an application at any Housing 
Authority office, city-run senior center, city library, City Council field 
office or county welfare office. Some state Assembly district offices are also 
participating. 
</P>
<P>
The Housing Authority created a furor last month when it reopened the 
enrollment program for the first time in three years -- but for only four days. 
The short time frame caused a near-panic as more than 300,000 callers jammed 
phone lines to the agency, most of them never getting through. 
</P>
<P>
Housing officials decided to offer a second chance this month to tens of 
thousands of prospective applicants who were unable to apply the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Section 8 is a federal subsidy program that helps poor families, the elderly 
and the disabled. Applicants who qualify are required to pay only 30% of their 
income in rent, with the rest paid by subsidy. That represents a huge savings 
for most of the poor, who in Los Angeles generally pay more than 50% of their 
income to rent. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Renahan, Section 8 director, said, "We are aiming for maximum access." 
For the next two weeks, phone calls will be accepted from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. 
Monday through Friday "to give working people a chance," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Applicants also can clip the application out of local newspapers and mail it to 
the Housing Authority, he said. All mailed applications must be postmarked on 
or before Feb. 16, Renahan said. 
</P>
<P>
People who apply will be placed on a waiting list for consideration. The order 
of people on the list will be chosen by random lottery, housing officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Hot line numbers to call are: (213) 484-1051 and (818) 787-5136. The special 
TTY teletypewriter number for the deaf is (213) 252-0103.

COMMUNISTS IN YUGOSLAVIA SPLIT INTO FACTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
BELGRADE, Yugoslavia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ruling Communist Party, posing a political crisis in already unstable, 
ethnically diverse Yugoslavia, split into rival factions during a special 
congress Monday, only hours after the party had voted to renounce its monopoly 
leadership role in the government. 
</P>
<P>
The split in the party that has ruled here for 45 years came late Monday when 
delegates from Slovenia, richest of the six republics in the Yugoslav 
federation, stormed out of the congress of the League of Communists of 
Yugoslavia, as the party is formally known. The walkout came after the Slovene 
delegation had been soundly defeated in a series of reform proposals. 
</P>
<P>
Stepping to the podium after his delegation had been continually thwarted in 
attempts to add reform amendments to the central party platform, Slovene party 
leader Ciril Ribicic declared: "We are leaving because we do not want to share 
responsibility for the agony of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the delegates from conservative Serbia applauded derisively as the 
Slovene delegates filed out. At the same time, liberal Croatian party leader 
Ivica Racan expressed dismay at the loss of his Slovene allies and called for 
the congress to be halted. But Serbian hard-liner Slobodan Milosevic insisted 
it continue and that a new quorum be constituted. 
</P>
<P>
Party leaders from Slovenia, where a strong secessionist movement already 
exists, denied they are seeking a breakup of the Yugoslav federation of six 
republics and two autonomous provinces. 
</P>
<P>
"With this gesture we are just trying to accelerate the movement toward 
democracy, not only for us but also for other republics," said Petar Bakes, a 
senior leader from the Slovene capital of Ljubljana. 
</P>
<P>
But since Marshal Josep Broz Tito founded the national party in 1945, it has 
been one of the few unifying elements in Yugoslav society, and the split could 
have far-reaching ramifications for future unity. Officers in the Yugoslav army 
and national police forces, for example, are required to be Communist Party 
members. Without the membership of Slovenia and possibly neighboring Croatia in 
the central party organization, the composition of these institutions could be 
affected. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Western diplomats cautioned against overreaction to the party 
split. "The party has been losing authority for some time," one said. "I don't 
think this necessarily leads to the dissolution of the country." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, as it renounced its monopoly on leadership, the party also 
voted to accept participation of rival political parties in elections. 
</P>
<P>
But the party membership, dominated by conservative Serbian delegates, soundly 
defeated a range of other reform moves, including a proposal to restructure the 
party along Western European Socialist lines. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Serbian delegates successfully blocked two human rights amendments 
to the party platform tied to alleged mistreatment of Albanians in Kosovo, one 
of the autonomous provinces inside Serbia. One of the defeated proposals called 
for the release of Albanian political prisoner Azam Vllasi, whose arrest and 
trial on charges of "counterrevolutionary activities" has been widely 
criticized in the West. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the national Yugoslav party can keep its Slovene members, the congress' 
actions gave mixed signals about the party's commitment to radical reforms such 
as those in other Eastern European countries. By crushing reform efforts by the 
more liberal republics, hard-liners may have alienated important parts of the 
population. 
</P>
<P>
"I came to this congress to save the League of Communists of Yugoslavia," one 
delegate complained amid roars and catcalls in the meeting hall. "Now it 
appears from our actions that we are here to bury the party." 
</P>
<P>
At one moment in the often chaotic debate, a delegate from Bosnia proposed that 
the party be divided into a Socialist Party and a Communist Party. The proposal 
was defeated by a sizable margin, but it reflected the deep divisions among the 
delegates. 
</P>
<P>
On several occasions delegates came close to blows. The leading Belgrade 
newspaper, Borba (Struggle), quoted a Serbian delegate as saying in defense of 
a monthlong economic boycott of Slovenia instituted by the Serbian government: 
"Why should we buy goods from someone who is spitting in your soul?" 
</P>
<P>
The boycott was called by the Serbian government after the Slovenian government 
banned a pro-Serbian demonstration last month in Ljubljana. Slovenian efforts 
to persuade the congress here to lift the boycott ended in failure. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, spurred by the wave of reform elsewhere in Eastern Europe, 
Yugoslavia has become a country with two distinct visions of its future. 
</P>
<P>
The western republics, Slovenia and Croatia, where multi-party elections are 
scheduled to take place in April, see themselves as becoming part of the 
liberal democratic tradition in West Europe. 
</P>
<P>
In Serbia, the largest and most populous of the republics, the party clings to 
the Communist tradition of centralized direction. Under the leadership of 
Milosevic, the Serbian party has developed a strong populist, chauvinistic 
strain. 
</P>
<P>
The division between the western republics and the Serbian-led easterners was 
reflected in a vote Monday on the question of relations with Western Europe. 
The Slovenian leader, Janez Kocjancic, director of the Slovenia-based airline 
Adria, had suggested that Yugoslavia seek membership in the European Community. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted as much as possible to be part of the modern European left," 
Croatian party leader Racan said, explaining the western republics' position. 
</P>
<P>
But Serbian delegates urged that the country maintain its ties to the Soviet 
Union and its traditional trading partners in East Europe. 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 1,156 to 169, the Serbian position was upheld, leaving Yugoslavia 
as the only country in Eastern Europe where change is occurring that has not 
sought membership in the European Economic Community.

BOARD DROPS L.A. SCHOOLS' NO-FAIL POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN MERL, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Board of Education voted Monday to drop the no-fail part of its 
pioneering policy requiring that students who participate in extracurricular 
activities meet minimum academic standards. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-2 vote, with board members Rita Walters and Leticia Quezada dissenting, 
came after a highly emotional, 1 1/2-hour debate. 
</P>
<P>
Effective immediately, students in grades 4 through 12 who receive a single 
failing grade will no longer be barred from extracurricular activities as long 
as they maintain an overall average of C. 
</P>
<P>
Led by Walters in a unanimous board vote late in 1982, the Los Angeles Unified 
School District became the first in the nation to require students to meet 
minimal academic standards to participate in sports, drama, music and scores of 
other activities conducted outside regular school hours. 
</P>
<P>
Other districts across the United States soon followed suit and, in 1987, a 
state law extended the C-average requirement to schoolchildren throughout 
California. 
</P>
<P>
The no-fail provision of the policy has remained controversial in the seven 
years the policy has been in effect in the 600,000-student Los Angeles 
district. 
</P>
<P>
Some of that controversy could be heard in the divided testimony Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
"Please do not take a backward step" by diluting the policy, John Mack, 
president of the Los Angeles Urban League, urged board members. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Los Angeles chapter of the National Assn. for the Advancement 
of Colored People, in a letter to the board, urged that the no-fail rule be 
kept. If the board insisted on dropping the rule, it should require failing 
students to get extra help to improve their grades, the NAACP suggested. The 
board referred the proposal to a committee for study. 
</P>
<P>
Board member Julie Korenstein, who proposed the change, said the rule had 
discouraged students from taking challenging courses out of fear of failing and 
getting bounced from the choir, an athletic team or a play. 
</P>
<P>
Two students, Kerry Lotts of North Hollywood High School and Sofia Paiz of 
Wilson High School, argued passionately for the board to keep the rule. 
</P>
<P>
"Decreasing the rules will only make it easier for students to slack off," said 
Paiz, who is student representative to the board. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my responsibility to keep up my grades," said Paiz, who is taking 
advanced college-placement courses while serving as Wilson student body 
president and editor of her school paper. "And if I can do it, others can, 
too." 
</P>
<P>
Parents Jerry Gaines of San Pedro High School and Susan Wong of Venice High 
argued that the policy was unnecessarily punitive. 
</P>
<P>
"We've seen really good kids who are really trying hard being blocked by this," 
Wong said. 
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of this policy was to say our mission . . . is education. There is 
no other reason for school to exist," Walters pleaded, as it became 
increasingly clear that her colleagues were bent on the change. 
</P>
<P>
Board President Jackie Goldberg said she disagreed with Walters and Quezada's 
argument that to lower the standard would tell students that academics are not 
important. 
</P>
<P>
Concerned about the dropout rate, Goldberg said extracurricular activities are 
sometimes "the only way we have of catching on and holding on in whatever it 
takes to make these kids decide to stay with us." 
</P>
<P>
In a voice filled with emotion, she told of a young baseball player who -- 
disqualified from the team when he received his first-ever failing grade -- 
left school 1 1/2 years before graduation. 
</P>
<P>
"His family is devastated by this, as are all of us who care about him," 
Goldberg said.

HOME KNOCKDOWNS ROUST MORE THAN DRUG DEALERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Mayor Tom Bradley announced an aggressive new program last January to 
bulldoze abandoned homes and drive out the crack cocaine dealers and users who 
often inhabit them, he probably did not have Florence Kirksey or Henry Smith in 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the city's Operation Knockdown has caught these two unrelated individuals 
in its web, driving Smith out of his childhood home and into homelessness two 
days after Christmas, and forcing the disabled Kirksey to exhaust her life 
savings to save her property from the wrecking ball. 
</P>
<P>
Billed as a way to rid drug-weary Los Angeles neighborhoods of about 70 homes 
in its first year -- double the number the city ordered torn down in 1988 -- 
Operation Knockdown has indeed helped some areas. Residents from South-Central 
Los Angeles to San Pedro say they cheered when bulldozers flattened the 
seemingly impervious drug dens that had terrified them. 
</P>
<P>
But Operation Knockdown has grown far beyond a war on drugs or derelict 
shanties. 
</P>
<P>
Not 70, but 215 homes and other structures have been demolished under city 
orders. An unknown number of them, including Henry Smith's, were salvageable 
homes in low-income areas where the city's housing crisis is at its worst. 
</P>
<P>
The demolitions make Los Angeles one of the few metropolises in the United 
States that is tearing down usable dwellings in the midst of a housing 
shortage. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said the number of homes torn down is three times their original 
estimate because more buildings than expected were found and placed in 
violation, and the subsequent tear-downs proceeded more quickly than 
anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, in the most widely publicized demolition program in the nation, 
Oakland ordered only five homes torn down in its drug-riddled urban core last 
year. There, housing shortages have spurred a well-received campaign to restore 
150 such homes. 
</P>
<P>
In Boston, "Our rule is, whatever you do, don't tear it down, even in the 
worst, poorest neighborhood," said an official. Boston makes renovation loans 
to owners. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco, with its worsening housing crisis, does not order housing torn 
down. "Two-hundred homes gone in L.A.? Oh, my gosh!" said Barbara Smith, 
director of the mayor's office of housing. "Wouldn't it be better to get rid of 
the drug dealers and keep the housing?" 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, an avid backer of Operation Knockdown, appeared in person to watch the 
demolition of two crack dens. His aide, Bill Chandler, said the program "is 
ridding innocent neighborhoods of something nobody deserves to live with." 
</P>
<P>
Safety officials also defend the program, saying that many of the destroyed 
homes were ramshackle magnets for illegal activities. 
</P>
<P>
Some had been reinforced with bars and heavy doors by crack dealers, and one 
was the site of a recent rape, said Art Johnson, assistant chief of the 
Department of Building and Safety. "It is nearly impossible to permanently 
secure some of these homes," he said. "Like magnets, when one building is 
removed, (dealers) move to the next." 
</P>
<P>
But officials acknowledge that most of the destroyed homes were not known crack 
houses. The exact number is not available, because city officials say they are 
not keeping a tally. Rather, the homes were deemed public nuisances because 
they were open to passers-by or squatters and were unkempt or sometimes 
hazardous, prompting complaints, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, in Miami, the drug-weary center of a major cocaine smuggling route 
into the United States, only homes with proven drug troubles are destroyed 
under the city's anti-crack program. 
</P>
<P>
Pablo Canton, Miami's assistant director of building and zoning, said that of 
more than 300 homes ordered torn down last year, "95% were crack houses, and 
the rest were wrecks, not rebuildable." Video cameras were used to document 
drug use in buildings bulldozed there. 
</P>
<P>
But in Los Angeles, open and abandoned houses are being flattened because many 
owners cannot afford repairs, others are interested only in the appreciating 
land value, and still others cannot be located, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Otis Slaughter, a senior building inspector, estimated that 10% to 30% of the 
houses were "completely trashed" crack dens, were deemed hazardous, or had been 
severely fire-damaged. For many of the other houses, he said, "the cost of 
demolition would go a long way toward fixing them." 
</P>
<P>
Demolition costs an owner roughly $2,500 to $4,500. Homeowners have a choice of 
hiring their own bulldozer or waiting for the city machines. If a homeowner 
waits for the city, he is charged a 40% administrative fee and a lien is placed 
on the property to assure payment. 
</P>
<P>
To save money, more than 150 owners bulldozed their homes themselves, Johnson 
said. More than 50 other homes -- the vast majority in poor areas of 
South-Central -- were bulldozed by the city when owners failed to act. 
</P>
<P>
Under city codes, owners have no right to a court hearing. The city conducts a 
title search to notify owners and lenders, but need not actually find them. 
Except in cases of extreme hazard where immediate demolition can be ordered, a 
notice is posted on the building, giving 10 days to secure it from outsiders 
and 30 days to repair it. 
</P>
<P>
It usually takes longer to arrange a demolition, but the lag time has not 
proved enough for many homeowners, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
One owner has threatened to sue the city because her fire-damaged home in 
Reseda was destroyed without her knowledge. She had not updated her property 
tax records, and the city notification was sent to her last known address, a 
city attorney said. An attorney for the homeowner declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Another owner, Florence Kirksey, is struggling to find a loan to complete 
city-ordered repairs, but may still face demolition after completing $20,000 in 
framing and roofing work on her rental duplex. 
</P>
<P>
Kirksey, a landlord who is disabled and relies on a modest rental income, said, 
"I would sue the city tomorrow if I had a dime left." 
</P>
<P>
Slaughter, the building inspector, said it is unfortunate when such homes are 
lost, "but it was decided that things have just gotten so bad with drugs, we 
have to move faster. We used to give people all the time in the world to fix 
these places because of the (city's) housing problems." 
</P>
<P>
The new policy led to the destruction in South-Central of the boyhood home of 
Henry Smith, an unemployed man who, until Dec. 27, lived in the filthy, 
unheated, but repairable house on East 47th Place. The house was owned by his 
absentee family. Smith had taken in five homeless men, including a paraplegic 
who slept in a car in the driveway. 
</P>
<P>
Police said that the men attracted trouble. The neighbors, who asked not to be 
named, said the men were down on their luck and had banded together to survive. 
</P>
<P>
In December, a city official informed Smith that he was trespassing in the 
building, since it had been declared uninhabitable, and that the eyesore would 
be destroyed. Two days after Christmas, the city knocked down the small stucco 
house. 
</P>
<P>
"I've lived here since elementary school, and I'll have to move to Skid Row 
after they tear it down," Smith, 33, said a few days before the house was 
razed. He wrung his hands and, in a panicky voice, recited prayers. He said he 
was unable to find his mother, whom he believed was living in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what to do," he said. "I'm sad. I have to find something, but I 
don't know how." 
</P>
<P>
Franklin James, a paraplegic who slept in his old Cadillac in Smith's driveway, 
said he and the others are too poor to rent even the cheapest apartment. 
</P>
<P>
A victim of severe rheumatoid arthritis, James, 53, is on a waiting list at 
Rancho Los Amigos Medical Center to get a pair of artificial knees that will 
let him walk again, he said. He lives on $380 a month in Social Security 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sufficiently able to get housing," James said. "I'll have to park my 
car on the street after this, but it's hard to find a safe spot." 
</P>
<P>
Owners who are fighting to save their property, such as Kirksey, wonder if the 
city has lost track of its original purpose. 
</P>
<P>
Frustrated by red tape that prevented her from getting a loan from the city's 
Community Development Department, Kirksey and her brother finally were forced 
to spend their $7,000 life savings to make repairs on the fire-damaged duplex 
in South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
The city has ordered her to 
</P>
<P>
enclose and finish the house, for an estimated total cost of $40,000. The 
dwelling has on two occasions attracted homeless squatters. 
</P>
<P>
But Kirksey faces a Catch-22 situation. The Community Development Department 
required that she insure the home before it would approve a city renovation 
loan. Kirksey could not get such insurance, however, because the home is open 
to the elements and considered a bad risk. 
</P>
<P>
So, after spending $7,000, Kirksey persuaded a builder to do $13,000 worth of 
work on credit. She is at a loss to find the $20,000 to finish the job. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to rent this duplex to two low-income families," Kirksey said. "We 
are good people. . . . The city doesn't care if we lose everything. It just 
makes you sick." 
</P>
<P>
Slaughter, appreciative that Kirksey is trying to save a house that would cost 
$140,000 to build from scratch, has granted time extensions. But, he said, 
Kirksey "is not out of the woods yet." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Oakland and Boston, there is no coordination between Los Angeles city 
agencies to help such owners. "We don't communicate with other agencies aside 
from the police, but that is being looked at," said Building and Safety 
official Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland's so-called Beat Health program uses city codes and an array of city 
agencies to force owners to fix derelict houses and throw out drug dealers. A 
Housing Conservation team ushers offending owners through the bureaucracy, 
helping them get loans. 
</P>
<P>
"To tear down housing that could be rehabilitated is stupid," said Oakland 
Police Sgt. Bob Crawford, supervisor of the Beat Health program. "I'm not 
saying L.A. is stupid, but we just wouldn't do that in Oakland. If you go in 
there with a hard-line attitude, please understand, you will lose the housing." 
</P>
<P>
"Financially speaking, it's crazy when demolitions cost thousands of dollars 
and rebuilding costs are sky-high," said Peter Welsh, director of Boston's 
Inspectional Services. Los Angeles, he said, "should think about turning 
eyesores into opportunities" by making sure owners get the help they need. 
</P>
<P>
But Los Angeles officials defend Operation Knockdown, especially in light of 
what they say has been an increase in the number of abandoned homes in the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
"Until we come into the picture, (wayward owners) are just waiting for the land 
to appreciate," Johnson said. "Unfortunately, the neighbors get caught in the 
middle." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said city officials are looking into ways to improve Operation 
Knockdown -- such as fixing some homes -- but that the program's success in 
wiping out magnets for crime "is something we are really pleased with." 
However, officials said they have no statistics on the program's impact on 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
Operation Knockdown has its supporters in the community too, among everyday 
families horrified by the transformation that crack can bring to a decent 
street. 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy and Robert Malone recall the year that the building next to their neat, 
picket-fenced home on East 51st Street in South-Central was taken over by drug 
dealers. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Malone said the violent group lived in such squalor that "giant rats 
came around, so big that they dragged my rat traps away." 
</P>
<P>
"I cheered the day they tore it down, and I'm speaking for my neighbors when I 
say that," said Dorothy Malone. 
</P>
<P>
But for families in the troubled 1100 block of East 47th Place, where the city 
has bulldozed two houses, the demolitions have had no effect. The block, 
frequented by speeding cars and bursts of gunfire, is as drug-ridden as ever, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
"All they're doing on 47th is tearing down black folks' housing," said one man 
who requested anonymity. "I live in this neighborhood and I see drugs every 
day." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Operation Knockdown was initiated on Jan. 6, 1989, to attack what was perceived 
as a rising problem of abandoned properties serving as crack houses or gang 
hide-outs. In 1988, before Operation Knockdown, the city tore down only 35 such 
"public nuisance" homes and other buildings. Under the program, the city has 
leveled 215 homes and other buildings.

ON CALIFORNIA: PRESERVING THE PROGRESS AT YOSEMITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. JONES 
</P>

<DATELINE>

YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I remember the first time I saw California. It was 1967, an early spring just 
before the Summer of Love. I had dropped out of college and come chugging 
across the great American desert in a rusty Ford with no spare tire. My hair 
snaked down my neck and I was, in all respects, a cliche of the period except 
for one thing. I was not headed to San Francisco to be a revolutionary. I was 
headed here, to Yosemite. 
</P>
<P>
Having quit the academic life, I needed a place of refuge. So, for about three 
weeks, I spent my days settled into an armchair in the great hall of the 
Ahwahnee Hotel here. If you have lived long in California, surely you know this 
place. The ceilings are as high as a cathedral, the walls draped with Navajo 
rugs, the windows bright with the light of the valley. 
</P>
<P>
Every morning I would find my armchair and read murder mysteries while the sun 
warmed up the valley. In the afternoons I would take walks and at night sleep 
in the car. Yosemite was the most benign and lovely place I had ever seen. I 
was mostly broke and paid for nothing except a few groceries. I finished a 
half-dozen books in my chair and watched spring arrive through the windows. No 
one ever questioned my right to the armchair or asked me to leave, and that 
first spring remains one of the best memories of California. 
</P>
<P>
I tell this story to illustrate a point. You can walk into the Ahwahnee Hotel 
today and still find that same armchair in the same place. The Ahwahnee and 
Yosemite Valley have changed very little in the 20 years or so since my first 
visit. It's part of what I love about this place. I can depend on the status 
quo here. 
</P>
<P>
I bring up this subject because this year marks the centennial for Yosemite. In 
the coming months you will hear more and more about the centennial celebration, 
and you will also hear a rising debate over the future of the park. 
</P>
<P>
Some of our more esteemed environmental groups will lay claim to the argument 
that the National Park Service has betrayed Yosemite. They will say the 
government has failed to carry out a management plan to institute major changes 
in the park. It is true enough that the plan was not carried out. It is not 
true that this amounts to a betrayal of the park. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps you recall this plan, which became famous for its unusual approach. The 
Park Service sent tens of thousands of questionnaires to people of all 
persuasions, trying to find what kind of Yosemite they wanted. About 20,000 
answers came back. The vast majority indicated that they preferred the park to 
remain pretty much as it was. In other words, they wanted the status quo. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of examples from the survey: Only about one-third of the respondents 
said they would favor excluding cars from the park, and only one-fourth wanted 
the number of overnight accommodations reduced. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the final plan included both these elements. It proposed a scheme whereby 
no one could simply drive into the valley. A bus trip would be required. Hotel 
rooms would decline in number and employee housing would be moved out of the 
valley, forcing the workers to commute over the same roads used by visitors. 
</P>
<P>
Why did the Park Service endorse a plan that the public clearly did not want? 
Most likely it was intimidated by the major conservation groups who have always 
regarded Yosemite as holy ground. Yosemite is the place, after all, that 
nurtured the naturalist John Muir, environmentalist David Brower, photographer 
Ansel Adams. You can go on and on. If social engineering was necessary to 
"save" a place as sacred as Yosemite, then so be it. 
</P>
<P>
But save Yosemite from what? It's true that on three or four weekends each 
summer the valley becomes so crowded it looks like Van Nuys with scenery. 
Anyone crazy enough to visit Yosemite on July 4 deserves all the misery they 
get. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, Yosemite's problems are minor, and this truth has finally been 
recognized by the Park Service. Instead of enforcing its mandated nightmare, 
the Park Service has tinkered here and there. Traffic flow has been smoothed 
and a free shuttle bus operates inside the valley. Some ugly congestion spots 
have been removed. 
</P>
<P>
And it works. You can still drive into the valley with a picnic basket or a 
couple of bicycles and have a swell time. You can, in the summertime, walk 100 
feet from the road and hardly be aware that you share Yosemite with thousands 
of others. 
</P>
<P>
You could even snuggle into my armchair for a good read, and I bet no one would 
bother you. That's the kind of place Yosemite was, and still is. Not such a bad 
gift for a centennial.

BARRY FLIES TO FLORIDA SUBSTANCE ABUSE CLINIC; 
</P>
<P>
DRUGS: NAACP OFFICIAL HOOKS QUESTIONS WHETHER THE MAYOR OF WASHINGTON IS BEING 
PROSECUTED UNFAIRLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amid continuing controversy over his arrest for allegedly smoking crack 
cocaine, District of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry flew to a Florida alcohol and 
drug abuse treatment clinic Monday, leaving his office in the hands of a career 
civil servant. 
</P>
<P>
"We've acted in the mayor's absence before," Carol B. Thompson, the city 
administrator, said at a press conference. "There will be no leadership 
vacuum." 
</P>
<P>
Just a day after vowing to "heal my body, mind and soul," Barry and his wife, 
Effi, left their Washington home at about 6 a.m., en route to the 
Hanley-Hazelden Center in West Palm Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement by Lurma Rackley, the mayor's press secretary, said Barry will 
be receiving treatment for alcoholism. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, 38, who was given control of the day-to-day duties of running the 
nation's capital Friday, said she did not know how long Barry would be gone. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a top civil rights leader, Benjamin L. Hooks, questioned whether 
Barry had been unfairly singled out for prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not trying to justify any wrongdoing . . . (but) I am opposed to selective 
enforcement of the law," the NAACP executive director said. 
</P>
<P>
Hooks said accounts of the sting in which Barry was arrested made it sound like 
"the search had finally paid off. We spent all of these years trying to find 
him with a grain of cocaine, and by God, we did it, didn't we?" 
</P>
<P>
He added: "We haven't found all the people who've stolen all the money from the 
savings and loan associations and are driving Rolls Royces and Jaguars, so 
obviously many of us in the black community will have some peculiar feelings as 
we go further." 
</P>
<P>
When a reporter asked if he opposed bringing law-breakers to justice, Hooks 
replied: 
</P>
<P>
"No, I think you ought to bring everybody to justice for violating the law. 
That would have meant most of us here would be arrested for speeding, spitting 
on the sidewalk or something. If we can afford to do it, let's do it." 
</P>
<P>
Hooks' comments came after his second meeting in two weeks with President Bush 
on the recent wave of bombings and threats against civil rights activists and 
sympathizers. 
</P>
<P>
Asked later whether Bush thought there had been any harassment of black 
officials by federal investigators, White House Press Secretary Marlin 
Fitzwater said: "This issue did not come up in the meeting. We are not going to 
have any comment on the Mayor Barry situation. And we simply urge our 
investigators, law enforcement agencies, and everyone to be very careful that 
that never . . . happens." 
</P>
<P>
Barry, 53, has long been dogged by persistent rumors of his drug use, but had 
steadfastly denied all charges and frequently lectured schoolchildren about the 
danger of using drugs. 
</P>
<P>
He was arrested Thursday night at a swank downtown hotel during a sting 
operation staged by the FBI and district police. Barry had been lured there by 
a longtime woman friend who, prosecutors said, had decided to cooperate with 
authorities. Officials have said they captured him on videotape buying and then 
smoking crack cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Barry intends to plead innocent to the federal misdemeanor charge, said R. 
Kenneth Mundy, his lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
His departure left many questions unanswered, such as whether he will complete 
the 11 remaining months of his term and whether he will seek reelection. 
</P>
<P>
A variety of political activists are discussing a campaign to draft civil 
rights leader Jesse Jackson, who recently moved to the district. Early surveys 
gave Jackson a wide lead over all other potential candidates. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Thompson is empowered to perform all the duties of the mayor 
during his absence, except for signing and vetoing legislation and signing 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
"At this time, we have to take one day at a time," Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
The West Palm Beach treatment center has a capacity for 40 men and 20 women. It 
is a nonprofit chemical dependency clinic. 
</P>
<P>
Officials there declined to comment on Barry's reported admission. But John S. 
Baudhuin, former treatment director at the center, said the cost of an average 
30-day stay is about $6,500. He said patients typically are assigned to a 
large, four-person room, where each one has a single-bed, a desk and closet 
space. 
</P>
<P>
They are addressed by first names only and spend most of the day, including 
evenings, in group therapy sessions, There is also time for casual recreation 
or exercise on the campus-like grounds, Baudhuin said. 
</P>
<P>
Treatment is centered on positive peer pressure, he added. Other patients whom 
Barry is likely to encounter at the center are largely middle class 
professionals: "engineers, teachers, lawyers, occasionally performers," 
Baudhuin said. 
</P>
<P>
Most patients have dependency problems with both illicit drugs and alcohol, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll get very good treatment there," Baudhuin added. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Barry and one of the mayor's bodyguards reportedly flew back to Washington 
on Monday night.

COURT RULES RIGHT TO FAIR TRIAL DOES NOT LIMIT PROSECUTORS' JURY SELECTION 
POWER 
</P>

<P>
The Supreme Court, limiting the rights of defendants to contest the fairness of 
their juries, ruled Monday that prosecutors may continue to remove potential 
jurors because of their profession, religion, gender or ethnic background. 
</P>
<P>
On a 5-4 vote, the court said that a defendant's constitutional right to a fair 
trial does not flatly prohibit a prosecutor from excluding members of any 
specific group from the jury. 
</P>
<P>
One exception to this rule still stands. In a landmark 1986 ruling, the court 
said that a prosecutor may not arbitrarily exclude blacks from a black 
defendant's jury, and the high court affirmed that decision Monday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cites 6th Amendment 
</P>
<P>
The 1986 ruling relied on the Constitution's ban on racial discrimination: the 
14th Amendment's guarantee of the "equal protection of the laws." But in the 
case before the court Monday, a white defendant from Chicago contended that his 
Sixth Amendment rights to "public trial by an impartial jury" were violated 
when the only two blacks in the jury pool were removed from his jury. 
</P>
<P>
Under the current system of jury selection, both the prosecutor and the defense 
lawyer are entitled to disqualify a fixed number of potential jurors without 
stating a reason. The number is typically six, but it varies from state to 
state. 
</P>
<P>
Except in the case of black jurors for a black defendant, the prosecution and 
defense lawyers may use this power to affect the racial makeup of the jury. 
Monday's case challenged the prosecutor's power to disqualify potential jurors, 
because it is the defendant whom the Constitution guarantees a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the court, said a defendant's right to a 
fair trial did not confer a right to be tried by a "fair cross section" of the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
The current system of selecting jurors is "a means of assuring, not a 
representative jury (which the Constitution does not demand), but an impartial 
jury (which it does)," Scalia said. Giving both sides an equal chance to 
exclude possibly biased jurors is the best way "of assuring the selection of a 
qualified and unbiased jury," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The court's four liberals, in dissent, said Scalia's ruling would permit racial 
discrimination. Justice Thurgood Marshall said the ruling "insulates an 
especially invidious form of racial discrimination . . . from Sixth Amendment 
scrutiny." 
</P>
<P>
Scalia shot back that "race as such has nothing to do with the legal issue in 
this case." He criticized Marshall for having "rolled out the ultimate weapon, 
the accusation of insensitivity to racial discrimination -- which will lose its 
intimidating effect if it continues to be fired so randomly." 
</P>
<P>
Scalia said that the defendant, Daniel Holland, should have challenged the 
prosecutor's action under the 14th Amendment if he wanted to raise the race 
issue. His opinion was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and 
Justices Byron R. White, Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony M. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
In a concurring statement, Kennedy sided, in part, with Marshall, saying that 
all defendants -- white as well as black -- have a right under the 14th 
Amendment to be free from racial discrimination in the selection of their 
juries. The case was Holland vs. Illinois, 88-5050. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conservatives' Concern 
</P>
<P>
When the court heard arguments on the case in October, the conservatives, led 
by Rehnquist and Scalia, said the case raised the specter that juries would be 
required to reflect their communities by having appropriate proportions of 
Protestants, Catholics and Jews, an equal percentage of women and men and a 
balance of white-collar and blue-collar workers. 
</P>
<P>
A trial jury is selected in two stages. First, a large number of citizens are 
called to jury duty, and they generally reflect "a fair cross section" of the 
community. Second, both the prosecutor and defense lawyer have the right to 
remove several potential jurors they suspect of harboring biases against their 
client. 
</P>
<P>
In practice, lawyers often select juries that do not mirror the community. For 
example, in the trial of former White House aide Oliver L. North, defense 
lawyers sought to remove jurors who had closely followed the scandal in the 
news. The result was a jury that was entirely unrepresentative of Washington: 
12 adults who had barely heard of the Iran-Contra case. 
</P>
<P>
In its ruling Monday, the court said that it found nothing unconstitutional 
about an unrepresentative jury. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ruling on Drug Tests 
</P>
<P>
In other actions, the court: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Made clear again that public employees may be randomly tested for drug use 
if their jobs involve safety, drugs or highly sensitive information. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Department employees who hold top-secret clearances and Army drug 
counselors have been subjected to random testing, which they say violates their 
privacy rights. That requirement was upheld by lower courts, and the justices 
refused without comment to hear their appeal. (National Federation of Federal 
Employees vs. Cheney, 89-635, and Bell vs. Thornburgh, 89-679.) 
</P>
<P>
 -- Agreed to decide whether a newspaper can be forced to pay damages for a 
columnist's charge that a public figure lied. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, the court has drawn a line between defamatory statements involving 
"facts" and those stating "opinions." The press can be forced to pay damages 
for a false statement about a public figure that is maliciously published, the 
court has held, but it cannot be punished for publishing a "false opinion." 
</P>
<P>
In April, in a case that may yield a precise distinction between these two 
forms of journalism, the justices will consider a 15-year old libel suit filed 
by an Ohio wrestling coach. A sports columnist accused him of having "lied at a 
hearing" before state officials, but on a 4-3 vote, the Ohio Supreme Court said 
this was an opinion, not a statement of fact. (Milkovich vs. Lorain Journal, 
89-645.) 
</P>
<P>
 -- Agreed to decide whether the owners of pleasure boats may use the nation's 
maritime laws to shield themselves from liability. 
</P>
<P>
The case concerns a yacht docked on Lake Michigan south of Chicago that caught 
fire and burned a marina. Under the maritime laws, the ship's owner would be 
responsible for the damage only to his vessel, but an appeals court said the 
yacht could not rely on the immunity provisions of the maritime laws. (Sisson 
vs. Ruby, 88-2041.)

<P>
Israeli police freed Palestinian leader Faisal Husseini from jail Monday, 
removing one of several roadblocks in the way of peace talks between Israel and 
Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
Husseini, 49, who had been held four days for questioning on charges that he 
paid for uniforms used by Palestinian rebels, said he was arrested to block the 
peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
The arrest was criticized by the Bush Administration, Palestinians and some 
Israelis. Husseini is considered a likely candidate to take part in the talks, 
which are being promoted by Washington. 
</P>
<P>
As Husseini left a courthouse in central Jerusalem, fistfights broke out 
between rival demonstrators. Rightist Israelis want Husseini locked up or 
deported because of his links to the Palestine Liberation Organization. 
</P>
<P>
Husseini said at a news conference: "I think that my arrest was political, and 
the result was that they could not prove anything against me. Everything they 
did was intended to stop moves for peace. I am not in prison, and I am working 
and will work for peace." 
</P>
<P>
However, a police spokesman said Husseini is still under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Husseini's arrest was a diversion in the frenetic Israeli-Palestinian activity 
focused on peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III has invited officials from Israel and 
Egypt to meet and agree on a Palestinian delegation to a peace panel. Israeli 
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir is facing a revolt in his Likud Party over the 
possible meeting. Hawkish Cabinet ministers, led by Trade Minister Ariel 
Sharon, believe that such talks will mean the loss of the Israeli-occupied West 
Bank and Gaza Strip to a Palestinian state. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir threatened Monday to resign if a party meeting next month censures his 
foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very clear that if the (party's) Central Committee doesn't support me, I 
cannot stand at the head of Likud and not at the head of the country," he said 
in a radio interview. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir rejects participation of the PLO in peace talks and is pressing 
Washington to bar the group. He also wants to bar Palestinian residents of East 
Jerusalem -- where Husseini lives -- from taking part and to limit the subject 
of the talks to his plan to have elections in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
In Shamir's view, letting Jerusalem Arabs take part would tend to undermine 
Israel's control of its capital city. He also believes that opening the agenda 
to other subjects would let the Palestinians bring up the issue of statehood, 
which he resolutely opposes. 
</P>
<P>
Later this week, Finance Minister Shimon Peres, who heads the center-left Labor 
Party, is scheduled to visit Cairo and discuss peace proposals. Labor is 
considered more agreeable to a role for the PLO and to giving up some land in 
return for peace. 
</P>
<P>
Palestinian activists, meanwhile, have been holding quiet meetings to consider 
possible participants in peace talks. People who have been mentioned, beside 
Husseini, include Elias Freij, the mayor of Bethlehem; Radwan abu Ayash, a 
Jerusalem journalist affiliated with the PLO; Mustafa Natsche, a lawyer from 
the West Bank town of Hebron, and Said Kanaan, a Nablus businessman and cousin 
of a PLO official in Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
The names of two men have surfaced to represent Palestinians from outside the 
West Bank and Gaza Strip: Mohammed Milhem, former mayor of Halhoul, a West Bank 
community, and Akram Henayah, a journalist. Both have been deported from Israel 
and are living in exile. 
</P>
<P>
The PLO is demanding that outsiders take part. It also wants the agenda to 
include independence for the occupied lands.

EAST GERMAN LEADER OFFERS CABINET POSTS TO OPPOSITION GROUPS

<P>
Communist Prime Minister Hans Modrow offered places in his Cabinet to 
opposition groups Monday in order to keep the struggling East German government 
intact until elections scheduled for May. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the opposition groups, including the Social Democratic Party, indicated 
they would accept the offer to keep the government from collapsing. 
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim Boehme, leader of the Social Democrats, said at the regular 
"round-table" meeting of the government and opposition groups that he is 
generally in favor of the move. But he said conditions for joining the 
coalition government should be set out in advance and that other major 
opposition groups should be included. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that such participation is possible," Boehme said, "only if all 
parties and groups at the round table are prepared to join the government on an 
emergency basis, without long negotiations that would further damage the 
country." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Democratic Awakening Party expressed support for Boehme's 
position. 
</P>
<P>
The reformist Modrow, seeking to avert a government crisis, said his offer to 
include opposition members was "not just a friendly gesture but a reflection of 
the prevailing conditions." 
</P>
<P>
Modrow told the meeting -- five government parties and a dozen independent 
groups were represented -- that candidates for posts in the government must 
have professional credentials for the jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The nine-week-old Modrow government has been beset with criticism that it has 
not moved quickly enough to bring about reform nor pushed through an electoral 
law for the scheduled May 6 elections, which would be the first free and open 
elections in East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The government suffered another setback Monday when Finance Minister Uta Nickel 
resigned. She has been accused of financial irregularities and is under 
investigation but has denied any wrongdoing.

Soviet troops deployed along the Iranian frontier with troubled Azerbaijan on 
Monday to block cross-border movement by Azerbaijanis on both sides, Tehran 
Radio reported. 
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of Soviet Muslims reportedly have crossed into Iran in the 
last week. According to press reports from Moscow, many of them have returned 
to Soviet soil carrying weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Iran's official radio said that mechanized units of the Soviet army fanned out 
along the border west of Astara, a town just north of the frontier on the 
Caspian Sea coast. The broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, reported that no 
movement south across the border was being permitted but that Soviet 
Azerbaijanis who had crossed into Iran were being allowed to return under 
"strict controls." 
</P>
<P>
But in Moscow, the Soviet news agency Tass said that "the situation remains 
complicated on the state border. Azerbaijanis and Iranians continue to cross 
the border en masse in both directions." 
</P>
<P>
The extent of the attempt to seal the border was not clear. When violence 
erupted earlier this month between Soviet Azerbaijanis and Armenians, 
Azerbaijanis started forcing their way across the frontier into Muslim Iran 
several hundred miles west of Astara, along the Araks River separating Iranian 
Azerbaijanis from their Soviet kinsmen in the autonomous republic of 
Nakhichevan. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet and Iranian border officials met Monday in Astara to discuss measures to 
control movement in the frontier zone, Tehran Radio said. No specific results 
of the talks were given. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
20,000 Crossings 
</P>
<P>
The Tehran broadcast said that more than 20,000 border crossings had been 
reported in the last four days. Crossing points, it said, were established at 
Astara and nearby Bilehsavar to permit the return of Soviet nationals. All 
other passage across the 400-mile-long border was reportedly forbidden. 
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, the Soviet government daily Izvestia charged that Iranian 
Azerbaijanis were crossing the Araks and sending guns over the border to help 
their kinsmen on the Soviet side. Tehran newspapers have denied the accusation 
but have widely reported the crossings of Soviet Azerbaijanis, who, according 
to these reports, carried out a demonstration on Iranian soil in support of the 
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's Shiite Muslim spiritual leader, and attended 
Muslim prayer services last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Hard-line Iranian newspapers decried the Soviet military assault in Baku, the 
Azerbaijani capital, to quell the unrest, terming it a massacre. According to 
an Iranian television report Sunday, President Hashemi Rafsanjani ordered 
Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati to "take serious steps to solve problems 
and end bloodshed and violence" in the neighboring Soviet republic.

In an interview published Monday in the newspaper Le Figaro, Silviu Brucan, a 
member of the 11-member executive council of the National Salvation Front, said 
the firing squad's enthusiasm reflected popular support for the Dec. 25 
execution.

"The officer in command asked for five soldiers to step forward and prepare to 
fire. The squad was made up of 80 men. All fired at the same moment. They found

RALLIES COMMEMORATE ABORTION RULING 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Demonstrators on both sides of the abortion issue marched at state capitols and 
cities around the nation Monday to commemorate the 17th anniversary of the 
Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade ruling, which legalized the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
At least 9,000 people marched against abortion at the Georgia Capitol in 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
"It may be a long fight," the Rev. Pat Robertson told demonstrators in Atlanta, 
but "we will come back this year, we will come back next year, we will come 
back the year after . . . until sooner or later we have victory." 
</P>
<P>
At the California Capitol in Sacramento, about 500 people gathered to hear 
lawmakers and abortion rights activists praise Roe vs. Wade and denounce the 
Webster decision in a Missouri case that opened the door for states to impose 
some restrictions on abortion. The demonstrators waved American flags and held 
signs reading "Pro-woman, Pro-family, Pro-choice." 
</P>
<P>
Among the speakers was state Sen. Lucy Killea, the San Diego Democrat who won a 
special election Dec. 5 in a Republican-dominated district after her Roman 
Catholic bishop banned her from receiving Communion because of her pro-choice 
stand. 
</P>
<P>
Norma McCorvey, the woman who was "Jane Roe" in Roe vs. Wade, was keynote 
speaker. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still fighting and will continue to fight as long as the fight must go 
on," she said. "The movement didn't start with me. I was just the straw that 
broke the camel's back." 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles Monday night, Roman Catholic Archbishop Roger Mahony called for 
greater unity within the anti-abortion movement and urged anti-abortion 
activists to demand greater support for their cause from government officials. 
</P>
<P>
"We must call one another to courage, and we must call our elected officials 
and moral leaders to courage in protecting all created human life," Mahony said 
in an address to the nearly 300 people who had gathered at Immaculate 
Conception Church on West 9th Street for the "Operation Prayer" speech. 
</P>
<P>
As Mahony and other anti-abortion proponents spoke inside the church, some 30 
pro-choice demonstrators marched outside. 
</P>
<P>
"We are here to celebrate (the court ruling) and to protest the fact that the 
archbishop of Los Angeles is supporting the death of women," said Julie 
Schollenberger, a spokeswoman for the Clinic Defense Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Sarah Weddington, the Texas lawyer who argued McCorvey's 
case before the Supreme Court, told a breakfast in Dallas: "We are here to say 
we won 17 years ago today, and we will win again." 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday night, police in San Francisco had cited McCorvey for illegally 
posting stickers bearing the name "Roe" on city street signs. The signs were on 
Webster Street. "It was just a prank," McCorvey told reporters Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, members of an anti-abortion group placed four mock baby coffins 
on the sidewalk Monday outside David Starr Jordan High School in protest of a 
campus health clinic there. 
</P>
<P>
John Madrid, a spokesman for Network of Parents and Students Against School Sex 
Clinics, said the demonstration was to dramatize to students what is going on 
at the clinic. But Assistant Principal Joseph Santana said Madrid's charges 
that the clinic dispenses birth control and gives abortion advice are 
unfounded.

In Baton Rouge, La., about a dozen pro-choice demonstrators wrapped 200 feet of

GILLESPIE VOWS TO DISALLOW SOME INSURANCE FIRM COSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie said Monday she will try to prevent 
insurance companies' costs for political contributions, bad-faith judgments, 
institutional advertising, fines and penalties from being passed on to 
consumers in higher rates. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie added that she will also place caps on what companies can charge 
customers for what she deems in rate hearings to be "excessive executive 
compensation." 
</P>
<P>
In short, Gillespie vowed that, in calculating what rates should be, she will 
try to disallow the expenses she listed. That policy would follow suggestions 
made to her in recent months by a number of consumer groups seeking to hold 
down rates. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie's latest expressions of intent also include a suggestion that she 
"press" in ongoing hearings for the 11.2% "fair rate of return" standard for 
companies that she originally advanced last summer but later wavered on. 
</P>
<P>
"The (Insurance) Department has developed a record in the proceedings which 
supports its original figure," she stated. 
</P>
<P>
Such a rate of return, lower than most companies contend they should get, could 
eventually mean lower rates and more customer rebates under Proposition 
103-mandated rollbacks. However, as in many past instances, following through 
on her pronouncements will almost certainly lead to industry lawsuits seeking 
to invalidate them. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie also responded to what she termed "unfounded, inaccurate and truly 
tasteless" charges last week from Harvey Rosenfield, chairman of the Voter 
Revolt organization that sponsored Proposition 103, that she is intentionally 
aborting enforcement of the measure in a kind of conspiracy with the industry. 
</P>
<P>
"Rosenfield's accusations are absolutely and demonstrably false," Gillespie 
said. "Harvey and his Proposition 103 proponents are busier than sandbox cats 
trying to cover up a flawed law based on empty promises." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of Proposition 103's promised rate rollbacks, Gillespie said, she 
believes that "millions of Californians will actually see rate increases as a 
result of the proposition's passage." She did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenfield responded by reiterating his charge that many of Gillespie's 
statements of intent are deliberate attempts to "make it look like she's 
enforcing 103, when, in fact, she's crippling it." He accused her of 
incorporating legal defects in her actions that allow the companies to 
successfully sue her.

FEINSTEIN ADS GET THE RACE GOING; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: HER TELEVISION SPOTS SEEKING THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION FOR GOVERNOR 
BEGIN TODAY. IN ONE, SHE TAKES AN EARLY SWIPE AT RIVAL VAN DE KAMP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEITH LOVE, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If television advertising largely shapes statewide political battles, then the 
1990 California governor's race officially begins today as Democratic candidate 
Dianne Feinstein goes on the air with the campaign's first commercials. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein's 30-second spots, which will run in Los Angeles, Sacramento and San 
Diego, attempt to introduce her to voters who may not be as familiar with her 
as residents of San Francisco, where she was mayor from 1978 to 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Known as "bio spots" in the political business, her ads open with what many 
believe was Feinstein's finest hour, the day in November, 1978, when she began 
to pull San Francisco together immediately after the assassinations of Mayor 
George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk. 
</P>
<P>
As president of the county Board of Supervisors at the time, Feinstein stepped 
in as acting mayor, a job she later won twice at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
Her new commercials also give her account of her years as mayor, saying that 
she cut crime, put more police officers on the street and stopped the dumping 
of untreated sewage into San Francisco Bay. Those are accurate statements, 
although her opponents and critics will no doubt argue over the details. 
</P>
<P>
The spots conclude by stating that she has always been pro-choice on abortion 
and that she is "the only Democratic candidate for governor who is for the 
death penalty." 
</P>
<P>
That is Feinstein's jab at her opponent in the Democratic primary, Atty. Gen. 
John K. Van de Kamp, who is personally opposed to capital punishment. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein's advisers believe that position will hurt Van de Kamp in a state 
where voters have overwhelmingly endorsed the death penalty in ballot 
initiatives, and that it would be exploited in the general election by 
Republican U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson, who is unopposed for the GOP gubernatorial 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
But Van de Kamp's advisers had a ready comeback Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"John Van de Kamp is the only candidate for governor, Democrat or Republican, 
who has put people on Death Row in California," said the attorney general's 
campaign manager, Richie Ross. 
</P>
<P>
That was a reference to Van de Kamp's willingness to argue in court for the 
death penalty in his role as attorney general. Neither Feinstein nor Wilson has 
ever prosecuted a criminal case. 
</P>
<P>
Ross said his sources told him that Feinstein will spend $500,000 to air her 
commercials from today through Feb. 18 and that her advisers had purchased time 
near local news shows in an effort to reach political insiders and contributors 
and convince them that her lagging campaign is now up and running. 
</P>
<P>
One source in the Feinstein camp said the ad purchase was actually a little 
larger than that, but Feinstein manager William Carrick would not discuss it. 
</P>
<P>
Ross was also scathing in his appraisal of the Feinstein ads. 
</P>
<P>
"They leave out a major chapter in Dianne's life," he said, "and that is that 
she sided with the insurance companies when insurance reform was on the ballot 
in 1988." 
</P>
<P>
To which Carrick replied, "Yes, just as Van de Kamp sided with the trial 
lawyers." 
</P>
<P>
That exchange, spurred by the new Feinstein ads, indicates that the 1990 
campaign is indeed under way. It is expected to get even nastier in the coming 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Political professionals speculated Monday that Feinstein's advisers may be 
hoping their television ad purchase will affect any statewide polls taken in 
late February. 
</P>
<P>
But spread over three weeks, the amount Feinstein apparently is spending to air 
the ads may be the political equivalent of shouting from the top of a 
skyscraper at midnight, given the millions of dollars it costs to reach voters 
in California's huge and expensive media markets.

DAVIS MOVES TO HALT TAX ON OVERSEAS PURCHASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State Controller Gray Davis vowed Monday to seek either legislative or 
administrative action to stop the Board of Equalization from taxing California 
residents for purchases they made abroad last year. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said it was "fundamentally unfair" for state administrators not to give 
taxpayers any notice before they began charging a use tax on goods purchased 
overseas. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone understands that hitting someone with an unexpected tax bill when 
they return from overseas is just not part of the American way," Davis said. 
"Fairness is a fundamental aspect of the American legal system. Notice is a 
fundamental aspect of the American legal system. This retroactive tax bill has 
neither." 
</P>
<P>
Board of Equalization officials said they decided to enforce the tax after the 
U.S. Customs Service agreed to give them access to the declarations that 
California residents make of their overseas purchases as they re-enter the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of California residents began receiving the unexpected tax notices 
last week. By the end of the year, officials estimate that as many as 58,000 
travelers will be required to pay the tax. Officials acknowledged that they did 
not send out notices advising taxpayers that the levy was being enforced until 
December. 
</P>
<P>
The use tax, which was passed in 1935, applies to all goods purchased outside 
the state for use in California. However, until officials reached the agreement 
with the Customs Service, they said they had no way of enforcing it on 
purchases made overseas. 
</P>
<P>
"In effect this is really a new law," said Davis. "It's been ignored for 55 
years, so no taxpayer could be faulted for being ignorant of it." 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who is also a member of the Board of Equalization, said he will ask 
lawmakers to pass an urgency bill that would delay enforcement of the tax until 
the public can be informed. If legislation is not successful, he said he will 
ask the five-member board to delay enforcement of the tax. 
</P>
<P>
At least one board member, Chairman Conway Collis, has already suggested 
similar action by the board.

If you like the Denver Broncos in the XXIVth Super Bowl Sunday, you get 12 1/2 
points. 
</P>
<P>
If you like the Denver Broncos, you should get a straitjacket. 
</P>
<P>
Wait a minute! That's not my opinion. That's the opinion of the ablest 
historians of our day, the Vegas betting parlor line makers. Go argue with 
them. 
</P>
<P>
You look at the Vegas line and you think they're charting an execution, not a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
The over-and-under is 47. That means Vegas expects a high-scoring game. But not 
necessarily 27-20. More like San Francisco 40, Denver 7. 
</P>
<P>
They figure 49er Jerry Rice is almost a cinch to score the first touchdown. At 
least, they make him only 3-1. You get 20-1 against Ricky Nattiel, Denver's 
Jerry Rice, scoring the first touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
The only Denver player Vegas really respects is Bobby Humphrey, the halfback. 
The odds against his scoring the first touchdown are only 4-1. And he has two 
cracked ribs. He is held to be almost the equal of San Fran's Roger Craig, who 
is only 7-2 not to score first. Humphrey's teammate, Sammy Winder, is 25-1. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers are favored to make the first field goal, the longest field goal and 
the most field goals. They are favored to score most in every quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Montana is 8-5 to roll up more yards passing than John Elway. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers are favored to score first. They're favored to score last. They will 
have the longest scoring play. They will have the shortest scoring play. 
</P>
<P>
All this is the considered opinion of Bob Gregorka of the Sands Hotel. Denver 
should just mail in the game. 
</P>
<P>
What are we to think of a team whose slogan going in is, "We'll show up."? 
</P>
<P>
Somehow that is not one of the great confidence builders of our time. I mean, 
it doesn't rank with, "We have met the enemy and they are ours," or, 
"Fifty-four-forty or fight," or, "Don't fire till you see the whites of their 
eyes," or, "Millions for defense but not one cent for tribute," or even, "I 
have not yet begun to fight." 
</P>
<P>
I mean, "We'll show up."? That's something Custer would have said. The Light 
Brigade showed up. The Spanish fleet showed up at Manila. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever happened to, "We'll surprise some people."? What's the matter with, 
"They pull their pants on one leg at a time, the same as everyone else."? How 
about, "What's so great about the 49ers? They lost two, didn't they?" 
</P>
<P>
"We'll show up," smacks of "Let me out of here, this guy's got a gun!" It's 
like a note in a bottle, "Help! I'm being kept prisoner by the San Francisco 
49ers! If you find this, please call your local police." It's like dialing 911. 
</P>
<P>
The poor Broncos have the same problem eagles, condors and pumas have. They 
can't function at low altitude. In the mountains, they're invincible. At sea 
level, they gasp like grounded whales. Up there in Denver, where their 
opponents turn purple about the third quarter, they're the 1940 Bears. At 5,280 
feet, God help you. At 50 feet, God help them. 
</P>
<P>
No one quite knows what happens to the Broncos at sea level. Is their white 
blood count too high? Is the air too thick? 
</P>
<P>
Does John Elway not take into account the fact that the ball won't go as far on 
his passes as it will up in the Rockies? Do the special teams overrun the punt 
coverage, figuring the ball will go farther? Is it all in their heads (which, 
come to think of it, is the worst place to have it)? Should their slogan be, 
"Pike's Peak or (we) Bust!"? 
</P>
<P>
The Denver Broncos have been to the Super Bowl three times in the past four 
years. In 1986, they lost five regular-season games. They lost four of those on 
the road. They got beat by Seattle, in sight of Puget Sound, 41-10. Their only 
home loss was a 9-3 decision to San Diego. They lost the Super Bowl to the New 
York Giants at Pasadena, 39-20. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, they lost four regular-season games and tied one. They lost three of 
them on the road and the tie was on the road. They lost the Super Bowl to the 
Washington Redskins, 42-10. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Denver lost five games. They lost three of them on the road. They 
beat the Raiders at home, 31-21 -- and lost to them at Los Angeles, 16-13. They 
beat the Chargers at home, 16-10 -- and lost to them at San Diego, 19-16. 
</P>
<P>
They beat Seattle at home, 41-14. They beat Seattle at Seattle, 24-21, in 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
We're not talking coincidence here, we're talking trend. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the likelihood is not so much that Denver plays better at altitude 
as that the opponent plays worse. Any physiologist can tell you it's worse for 
a flatlander to go up in the mountains than for the mountaineer to come down to 
the sea. 
</P>
<P>
But the reality is, Denver loses its edge coming round the mountain. The 
Broncos are like a guy who loses his horse. Whose gun jams. Who drops his 
glasses. They have been in three Super Bowls and the cumulative score is NFC 
108, Denver, 40. 
</P>
<P>
Based on history, you should get Denver and 17, 19, or 32 points. If the 49ers 
are on target, the spread should be infinity. Denver gets a little worse with 
each Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
It's possible to feel for Denver Coach Dan Reeves, an ultra-decent sort who was 
probably as conscientious a player as ever suited up and has the sore knees to 
prove it. Dan didn't put the franchise up there in the ski lifts and cable 
cars. He can't even yodel. 
</P>
<P>
But what Reeves is facing this week in this city, which is so close to the sea 
that they can't even bury their dead underground, is more an inquisition than a 
press conference. You'd think he took the Lindbergh baby. The questions stop 
just short of open hostility, of the "Tell me again what you did with the 
baby," category. 
</P>
<P>
They are tactfully couched but mean the same thing: "Is there any difference in 
attitude between this team and the two other teams you brought into the Super 
Bowl?" English translation: "Are these bums going to fall apart and lie down, 
too?" 
</P>
<P>
Reeves is patient. It's his stock in trade. 
</P>
<P>
"We realize we had two disappointing games in Super Bowls," he says. "If you've 
got any competitive spirit at all, you don't like things like that. What you 
read does ruffle you a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
What he reads would ruffle Mother Teresa. What he reads is that he's just 
bringing the piano for the 49ers' recital. 
</P>
<P>
Around a race track, when a horse is overmatched in a stake, it's customary to 
say of him, "He's coming up to the race a little short." 
</P>
<P>
What Dan Reeves reads is that his team is coming up to the game a lot short -- 
about 5,280 feet short.

</P>
<P>
SUPER BOWL IV: LEN DAWSON NOT ONLY PLAYED FOR UNDERDOG CHIEFS, HE FACED 
GAMBLING INVESTIGATION.

<P>
So John Elway thinks his world is closing in on him, with the Denver media 
piling on his socializing habits, his Halloween candy-giving habits and his 
Super Bowl-losing habits as he readies for another Roman numeral in New 
Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
Elway says he's suffocating. 
</P>
<P>
Elway ought to talk to Len Dawson. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years ago, Dawson was the quarterback for the 1969-70 Kansas City 
Chiefs, the Denver Broncos of their era. At that point, the Chiefs had been to 
one Super Bowl, lost it big, and were advised not to try it again. They were 
the first wild-card team to reach a Super Bowl, upset winners over the Oakland 
Raiders in the American Football League's final championship game, and they 
went off as 12 1/2-point underdogs to the Purple People Eating Minnesota 
Vikings in Super Bowl IV. 
</P>
<P>
But for Dawson, that was the least of it. Five days before Armageddon, Dawson 
was rousted from his sleep by pounding on his hotel door. Nightmares of Carl 
Eller and Alan Page gave way to a far more frightening reality once Dawson, 
blurry-eyed, swung the door open. 
</P>
<P>
The press. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you have a statement to make?" one reporter asked Dawson. 
</P>
<P>
"On what?" Dawson wanted to know. 
</P>
<P>
On what had just been broadcast on the Huntley-Brinkley Report: That a 
sports-gambling investigation had turned up a Detroit suspect holding $400,000 
and a slip of paper with Dawson's name on it. 
</P>
<P>
Some wake-up call. 
</P>
<P>
Dawson, currently a sports broadcaster in Kansas City, Mo., well remembers his 
first reaction. Ever the quarterback, he called an audible, phoning Coach Hank 
Stram and assembling a quick strategy session that included Chief owner Lamar 
Hunt. What to do? What to tell the reporters? 
</P>
<P>
"I told them, 'Fellas, I've just been sleeping. Why not tell the truth?' " 
Dawson said. "I know the guy. He called me twice. Once when I hurt my knee and 
again when my father passed away." 
</P>
<P>
Dawson described the man as a casual acquaintance and nothing more, a claim 
that would later be substantiated. But for Dawson, the next four days were the 
worst of his life. 
</P>
<P>
On the fifth, he led the Chiefs to a shocking 23-7 victory over Minnesota, 
completing 12 of 17 passes and winning the game's most valuable player award. 
</P>
<P>
But to reach such a height, Dawson first had to pass through the depths. 
</P>
<P>
"It was hell," he says. 
</P>
<P>
The Chiefs spent the rest of Super Bowl week plotting two game plans -- one for 
the Vikings and one for the national media, who hounded Dawson to the point of 
exhaustion. 
</P>
<P>
"My name was just one of a lot of names that were supposed to be subpoenaed," 
Dawson said. "And anybody can be subpoenaed; it has nothing to do with being 
innocent or guilty. 
</P>
<P>
"But I happened to be the quarterback in the Super Bowl in New Orleans and the 
writers went crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Misdirection plays were devised. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lot of intrigue," Dawson says. "I changed rooms with (safety) 
Johnny Robinson -- and he got no sleep. We were going out the back door, 
talking with NFL security. It looked like a B movie, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
Nothing much worked. By week's end, Robinson said his road roommate had "aged 
five years. . . . You looked into his face and you knew it wasn't the face of 
Len Dawson." 
</P>
<P>
All of this was dumped into the ample lap of Stram, the coach who had been 
embarrassed by Green Bay in the inaugural Super Bowl and had been pining for 
vindication ever since. Stram was proudly plugging his multi-back, 
multi-formation schemes as "the offense of the '70s," but on Super Sunday, 
would his quarterback be too weary to run it? 
</P>
<P>
A turning point, Stram says, occurred at the Chiefs' first workout after the 
Huntley-Brinkley newscast. 
</P>
<P>
"After the press conference, I met with the squad and explained all the details 
and what was going on," Stram says. "Then I asked if there were any questions. 
</P>
<P>
"E. J. Holub, who was one of our holler guys, stood up and said, 'Yeah, I've 
got three. 
</P>
<P>
" 'When do we eat? 
</P>
<P>
" 'Where do we get tickets? 
</P>
<P>
" 'And what time do we have to get up for practice?' " 
</P>
<P>
The Chiefs broke up in laughter. 
</P>
<P>
"I could tell then that we weren't going let this interfere with our 
preparation," Stram says. 
</P>
<P>
Dawson remembers another conversation during that week of practice, a 
conversation that made him a believer. 
</P>
<P>
Says Dawson: "Johnny Robinson came up to me and said, 'All right, I've heard 
the coaches, I've read the papers, I've listened to all the BS. You tell me -- 
what's really going on? Can you move the ball? Can you put points on the 
board?' 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'John, the game plan fits. I think we'll be able to score some 
points.' And he says, 'Good. I've been watching films all week long. We might 
shut them out.' " 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City came close. The Chiefs led at halftime, 16-0, gave up a 69-yard 
scoring drive to open the third quarter and then bottled up Viking quarterback 
Joe Kapp the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
A nation was stunned. A National Football League was stunned. 
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, Stram says, they should have seen it coming. 
</P>
<P>
"We played Minnesota in the preseason and we knew we matched up very good with 
them," Stram says. "Their center, Mick Tingelhoff, was a good one, but he 
weighed only 235 pounds. With our triple-stack defense and Curley Culp, who 
weighed 275, lining up on the nose of the center, we knew we had a mismatch 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota made it simpler with a limited offense led by the slow-footed, 
overachieving Kapp and two straight-ahead, inside runners, Dave Osborn and Bill 
Brown. 
</P>
<P>
"A vanilla offense," Stram calls it. "They were basically a two-formation team 
that executed very well. That changed when they got (Fran) Tarkenton, but that 
was their personality then. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Joe was a competitor and he made some plays on the run, but we didn't think he 
could beat us outside the pocket." 
</P>
<P>
First impressions mattered greatly in Super Bowl IV. Dawson's first pass of the 
game went to halfback Mike Garrett for a first down. 
</P>
<P>
"What am I thinking then?" Dawson says. "I'm thinking, 'All right!' " And that 
first drive resulted in a 48-yard field goal by Jan Stenerud, a nice little ice 
breaker. 
</P>
<P>
"When I sent Stenerud in, Minnesota was laughing on the bench," Stram says. "It 
was a misty day, the ball was heavy, but Stenerud kicked it like it had eyes. 
It got the flaps down and it went through. 
</P>
<P>
"They were stunned." 
</P>
<P>
Stenerud kicked two more and then the Vikings fumbled a kickoff and the Chiefs 
recovered on the Minnesota 19. Moments later, Kansas City had the ball on the 
five, third down, and Stram was having a ball. 
</P>
<P>
His sideline narration of Garrett's ensuing touchdown burst, captured for 
posterity by NFL Films, remains an audio sports classic, right there with Tom 
Lasorda's opinion of Dave Kingman's performance. 
</P>
<P>
Some excerpts: 
</P>
<P>
"OK, boys, 65 toss power trap, look for 65 toss power trap . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It might pop wide open, boys. It might . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 (Garrett scores. Much screaming by Stram follows.) 
</P>
<P>
"Was it there, boy? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yessir boys. Your coach drove it in there, boys." 
</P>
<P>
 Boy, was Stram happy. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a one-time thing," Stram says, collected again after 20 years. "We 
didn't use that play in that many short-yardage situations, but because Alan 
Page was so fast and reacted so quickly, we thought that if we pulled a tackle, 
he'd chase the tackle to the outside. 
</P>
<P>
"And that's exactly what happened. We didn't even have to block him. That's why 
we got a little excited on the sidelines." 
</P>
<P>
The Chiefs added a fourth-quarter touchdown when flanker Otis Taylor caught a 
quick out from Dawson, slipped a tackle and high-stepped down the sideline for 
46 yards. 
</P>
<P>
It was a big victory for Stram, who moved to 1-1 in Super Bowls, and a huge 
victory for the AFL, ready to merge with the NFL on even terms, but no one 
cherished it more than Dawson. 
</P>
<P>
"Afterward, I had to shudder," Dawson says. "What if I looked lousy and we got 
blown out? What would've been said then? 
</P>
<P>
"At least this turned out to have somewhat of a happy ending. Nothing ever came 
out of Detroit and I have a Super Bowl ring on my finger." 
</P>
<P>
So, can Broncos follow where Chiefs once roamed? 
</P>
<P>
Even old champions of the underdog have to wonder. 
</P>
<P>
"What we had, and what Denver maybe doesn't have, was a dominant defense," 
Dawson says. "Our defense was so good, it enabled us to be patient on offense. 
</P>
<P>
"Are the Broncos strong enough to put heat on (Joe) Montana? Defensively, what 
they're hearing is, 'Geez, they've got Taylor and Rice and then there's the 
tight end roaming around. They've got Roger Craig.' . . . Hell, (Tom) Rathman 
caught more balls than anyone. Montana throws to them all. Denver's got to put 
pressure on the guy doing all this." 
</P>
<P>
Adds Stram: "Any time you've got a quarterback like Elway, you've always got a 
chance. I think Denver's much better than their last two (Super Bowl) teams. 
They have much better balance, they're a bigger team, defensively they're 
greatly improved and they have a definite edge in the kicking game over San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"They're closer to having it all than the last two times, but I don't think you 
can win it all unless you have it all. 
</P>
<P>
"San Francisco has it all." 
</P>
<P>
But it can be done. That much Kansas City proved 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
So let's not deflate Denver's balloon any more than it already is. It sounds as 
if Elway needs all the air he can get. 
</P>

GAMBLERS BRACING FOR THE BIG SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW BEYER, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The key participants in the Super Bowl will be laying everything on the line 
Sunday, knowing that a win or loss can make or break their season. 
</P>
<P>
We're not talking about Joe Montana and John Elway, of course -- they'll still 
have their lucrative contracts regardless of what happens in New Orleans. But 
the San Francisco-Denver showdown is genuinely crucial for the nation's 
bookmakers: It will be the biggest betting event of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"In Nevada alone, $50 million will be bet on the game," said Michael "Roxy" 
Roxborough, president of Las Vegas Sports Consultants, the country's most 
influential oddsmaker. "Nationally the figure might be $500 million. I'd guess 
that 25 percent of the adult males in America have some type of wager on the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"From the standpoint of bookmakers, this has been as good an NFL season as 
we've ever had. But nobody will remember that if we botch the Super Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
Over the long run, of course, bookmakers always have the percentages in their 
favor. On a single game, however, they can lose, if a point spread attracts a 
disproportionate amount of action on one team. Their worst fears are generated 
by fluctuations in the point spread that can leave them vulnerable to being 
"middled" -- i.e., losing no matter which team wins. This happened in the 1979 
Super Bowl, in which Pittsburgh was favored over Dallas by anywhere from 3 to 4 
1/2 points. When the Steelers wound up winning 35-31, it was Black Sunday for 
the nation's bookies. 
</P>
<P>
With such high stakes involved, no rocket scientist ever pored over his figures 
any more diligently than Las Vegas oddsmakers did before San Francisco was 
established as a 12 1/2-point favorite in the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Roxborough explained that making a point spread for a game that generates such 
broad public interest is different from an ordinary football game. If Brigham 
Young is playing the University of Hawaii in midseason, Roxborough wants to 
publish the most accurate possible line, knowing the game will generate 
attention only from serious bettors who are looking to capitalize on an error 
in the point spread. But in pro football playoffs, and especially the Super 
Bowl, the line also must take into account public sentiment. The betting public 
generally loves favorites, and this year the public worships San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
What is the "correct" point spread for a game between the 49ers and the Broncos 
on a neutral site? 
</P>
<P>
"If I were locked in a small room with the five sharpest gamblers in the world, 
and I had to take their action, I'd put the game up at 8 1/2," Roxborough said. 
"But this is a game where the public will totally dominate the wagering, and we 
have to make a price that balances the action. The 49ers have just played two 
games as flawless as you'll ever see -- both on national TV. The public thinks 
that Joe Montana can't throw an incomplete pass. ... Still, you don't want to 
put up the number too far from what it should be, and give the players a big 
value. So we put out the point spread at 10-just to test the waters." 
</P>
<P>
A week ago Sunday, the 10-point spread went up on the board at major sports 
books in Nevada, and this testing of the waters turned into a brief deluge. The 
money poured in on San Francisco, and half an hour later the 49ers were favored 
by a solid 11 1/2. By Monday, it was 12 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
Because of this obvious trend, the people who want to bet Denver are waitingand 
their money will not show until later in the week. "The pros are waiting to see 
if it goes to 13," Roxborough said. If that happens, the bookmakers' great risk 
would be a San Francisco victory by exactly 12 points -- which would enable 
bettors on both sides to win. 
</P>
<P>
The fascinating aspect of the Super Bowl is Roxborough's acknowledgement that 
he thinks the "correct" spread on the game is 8 1/2. If that is the case, 
betting Denver plus 13 would be the kind of bargain rarely found in sports 
wagering -- and the pros in Las Vegas are waiting to capitalize on that 
phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
However, the same Vegas pros took the same position in the NFC championship 
game, figuring the 7 1/2-point spread favoring San Francisco over Los Angeles 
was inflated, and the final result was Public 30, Wise Guys 3. Roxborough 
points out too that in the last two Super Bowls with lopsided spreads -- 
Chicago vs. New England and New York vs. Denver -- the smart money "took the 
perceived value with the underdog, and wound up getting blown out." 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos could easily get blown out on Sunday too. But a bettor who takes 
the underdog will go down to defeat in the company of the wise guys.

TENNIS AUSTRALIAN OPEN;

<P>
BECKER CALLS MCENROE PENALTY TOO HARSH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
Boris Becker is defending John McEnroe, saying the misconduct rules are wrong 
and warning tennis officials against trying to turn players into robots. 
</P>
<P>
"Tennis has to be careful," Becker said at the Australian Open while McEnroe 
was flying home to Malibu, Calif., after being disqualified from the tournament 
for smashing his racket and cursing. 
</P>
<P>
"Not everybody is like a computer. Tennis is more than just hitting a few 
balls," Becker said. "It is very good to have a John McEnroe, and I hope we 
have a couple of more. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, you can't say what he said to the umpire, but there should be a 
different penalty than just taking him out of the match." 
</P>
<P>
Becker took some of the attention off of the McEnroe affair with a slick escape 
from two sets down Monday night, a trick reminiscent of his route to the U.S. 
Open title last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Down a break in the third set to 1989 Australian finalist Miloslav Mecir of 
Czechoslovakia, Becker won, 4-6, 6-7 (6-8), 6-4, 6-1, 6-1 and reached the 
quarterfinals against three-time champion Mats Wilander. 
</P>
<P>
"I was quite astonished I got out of it," Becker said. 
</P>
<P>
It was the third time in recent months that Becker has come back from two sets 
down. He did it against Derrick Rostagno in the second round of the U.S. Open, 
and against Andre Agassi in Davis Cup play. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to tell yourself not to go down," Becker said. "If I go down, the 
other guy has to beat me. So it's first a struggle against yourself. That's the 
first fight you have to win, and then your opponent." 
</P>
<P>
Becker won both fights, turning up the level of his game midway through the 
second set after one fan called out, "Hey, Boris, you want to be No. 1?" and 
another fan yelled, "Remember Davis Cup in America." 
</P>
<P>
Becker's first serve was off in the opening set, when he seemed distracted by 
cawing crows on the rim of the stadium and frustrated by the deft passing shots 
of Mecir, who broke Becker three times. 
</P>
<P>
Becker blew a 4-0 lead in the second-set tiebreaker, double-faulting to 4-4 and 
losing it on a lunging forehand he hit long. 
</P>
<P>
But after Mecir broke him in the third set for a 3-1 lead, the match suddenly 
changed. Mecir weakened -- missing a short drop shot, double-faulting and 
getting broken at love after two more errors.

Neither Boris Becker nor Steffi Graf nor Zina Garrison had an easy time in the 
heat at the Australian Open. 
</P>
<P>
Becker had to go five sets. Graf nearly lost a set for the first time in the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Only Garrison wilted. 
</P>
<P>
The third-seeded woman fell to Mary Joe Fernandez, 1-6, 6-2, 8-6, today 
(Tuesday) in the quarterfinals at the National Tennis Center, where the 
temperature on court was said to be well above 100 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty frustrating. I don't understand it sometimes," said Garrison, who 
appeared to have a clear run to the final after an injury forced No. 2 Gabriela 
Sabatini to withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
Garrison was serving for the match at 5-4 and 6-5 in the third set, but her 
serve was broken each time and then broken again at love when the sixth-seeded 
Fernandez won the match. 
</P>
<P>
"I work very hard, but I never seem able to make my breaks," said Garrison, a 
Houston native who was a semifinalist at last year's U.S. Open. "Until I do, I 
don't deserve to win. (This was) a match I think I lost. It was in my hands and 
I didn't take advantage of it. More than anything, I wanted to win. Sometimes 
you want to win too bad." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Graf had her toughest challenge of the tournament before turning 
back Patty Fendick of Sacramento, 6-3, 7-5. That tied Graf's career-best 
winning streak with a 46th consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
Fendick had a 5-2 lead and a set point on Graf's serve in the second set, but 
Graf held and allowed Fendick only four points in the next four games. 
</P>
<P>
Becker survived a tougher test. Down a service break in the third set to 
Miloslav Mecir of Czechoslovakia, Becker stormed back to win, 4-6, 6-7 (8-6), 
6-4, 6-1, 6-1, and reach the quarterfinals against Mats Wilander. 
</P>
<P>
"I was quite astonished I got out of it," Becker said. 
</P>
<P>
It was the third time in recent months that Becker has come back from two sets 
down -- the first time against Derrick Rostagno in the second round of the U.S. 
Open, the second time against Andre Agassi in Davis Cup play. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to tell yourself not to go down," Becker said. "If I go down, the 
other guy has to beat me. So it's first a struggle against yourself. That's the 
first fight you have to win, and then your opponent."

MCENROE ANGERED BY PHOTOGRAPHER

<TEXT>
<P>
On his way home, after being thrown out of the Australian Open for losing his 
temper, John McEnroe directed his anger Monday at an Associated Press 
photographer who was attempting to take the tennis player's picture as he and 
his family arrived at Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
"He stuck his finger in my face, swore at me and told me to get out of his 
way," the photographer, Nick Ut, said. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, I thought he was going to kill me. He kept yelling at me, swearing 
at me. He was very angry at me, and so was his wife. I've never had anybody 
angrier at me when I was trying to do my job." 
</P>
<P>
Ut, a Pulitzer Prize winner in 1973, took several pictures and said he never 
answered McEnroe. Ut also said he was the only photographer at the airport to 
photograph McEnroe, who was accompanied by his wife, actress Tatum O'Neal, and 
their two sons. The couple live in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
The AP said no charges were filed and Ut was unhurt.

Alleged illegal payments to players by former Coach Bud Middaugh, perhaps as 
much as $70,000 over a period of years, could result in the University of 
Michigan's baseball program being placed on three years probation and other Big 
Ten Conference sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
Money from the sale of football programs was allegedly used to pay players, 
some in the form of improper scholarship aid. The money should have gone 
instead into athletic department coffers. 
</P>
<P>
It would be the first blemish of any kind on any Michigan athletic team in the 
university's history. Middaugh was 465-146-1 at Michigan with six Big Ten 
championships and four College World Series berths.

Keith Millard, the NFL's defensive player of the year, was charged with drunk 
driving Monday, the 12th such incident involving Minnesota Viking players in 
the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
Bloomington Police Sgt. Frank Heino said Millard was arrested at 12:51 a.m. 
when his vehicle was stopped near a residential neighborhood in a 40 m.p.h. 
traffic zone. 
</P>
<P>
Heino said Millard was charged with speeding and drunk driving. It was the 
second time in a year Millard was arrested on a charge of drunk driving. 
</P>
<P>
Millard, 27, was booked at and released pending a March 27 court appearance. 
Millard admitted he was speeding but said he was "nowhere close to being 
drunk." 
</P>
<P>
Last March 22, Millard was arrested by police in Redmond, Wash., on four 
misdemeanor counts, including drunk driving and threatening police officers. In 
July he was placed on probation, ordered to abstain from alcohol, complete two 
years of counseling and perform community service work.

WESTMONT A PLEASANT SURPRISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MITCH POLIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This was not supposed to be the big year for the men's basketball team at 
Westmont College in Montecito. 
</P>
<P>
With no seniors on his team's roster, longtime Coach Chet Kammerer and his 
staff figured that the best season for the Warriors was still another year down 
the line. 
</P>
<P>
But success at Westmont appears to be a year ahead of schedule. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors are off to their best start at 17-1 and are No. 11 in the National 
Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics rankings. 
</P>
<P>
Westmont has won 16 consecutive games and would tie the school record of 18, 
set in 1983-84, with victories over Point Loma Nazarene and Fresno Pacific this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Not that any of this should come as a major surprise, however. 
</P>
<P>
After all, Kammerer began the season seventh among active NAIA coaches in 
victories with a 475-230 record, and his winning percentage of .674 was tied 
for 25th among active coaches. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors also have won four NAIA District 3 titles under Kammerer, most 
recently two seasons ago, when the team lost to Wisconsin Eau Claire in the 
first round of the NAIA national tournament in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
Still, after going 18-13 last season, this had the appearance of a rebuilding 
year for Westmont. Only two starters returned. 
</P>
<P>
"Its been unexpected because we graduated five seniors from last season," he 
said. "In no way did we expect to be 17-1 at this point. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still sort of amazed to see the success we're having every time we go out. 
I know they've surprised the coach, they've surprised their fans and I think 
they've surprised themselves." 
</P>
<P>
The seeds of success might have been planted last summer, when Kammerer and 
three of his starters visited Czechoslovakia for 17 days with a touring team 
and played 10 games and conducted clinics. The players were forward Chris Hahs, 
guard Peter Partain and guard Chad Kammerer, the coach's son. 
</P>
<P>
"That probably helped Chris the most because he got a chance to play a lot of 
basketball against big players," the coach said. "We played the best teams in 
that country." 
</P>
<P>
Kammerer said another factor this season has been the improvement of Partain, 
who had difficulty adjusting last season after having knee surgery two years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Peter came off major knee surgery and last year was just a season of total 
adjustment for him," Kammerer said. "This season he's playing at just a 
completely different level." 
</P>
<P>
Partain, a 6-foot-3 junior, averages 17.2 points and six rebounds. Junior 
forward Noel Matthews leads the team with averages of 19.2 points and six 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Westmont has five players averaging double figures in scoring. 
Kammerer averages 14.1 points, Hahs 13 and guard Chris Brown 12.8. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a good balance, yet on the other hand it's a good blend, too," the 
coach said. "What makes a team is not only that they like each other but that 
they blend together well and this team does. 
</P>
<P>
"People that watch us are not going to be impressed just by looking at us, but 
we play very well together. I think individually they wouldn't stick out, but 
as a group they do." 
</P>
<P>
Kammerer said his team has a goal of going undefeated at home, winning the 
district title and returning to the NAIA national tournament. So far the 
Warriors are 9-0 at home and another district title appears within reach. 
</P>
<P>
Kammerer says that, so far, Westmont has managed to keep its early success in 
perspective. At the moment he is more concerned about the race for first place 
in the Golden State Athletic Conference, where the Warriors are tied for the 
lead with Fresno Pacific at 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
"We've hardly said one word about the streak," he said. "Right now we're tied 
with Fresno Pacific and we haven't won anything yet. We're still focusing on 
our next game. It seems like there's always another challenge down the line for 
us." 
</P>
<P>
After two weeks of the conference season, the Cal State Northridge men's 
basketball team is still the biggest surprise in the California Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors, the only undefeated team in conference play, improved to 4-0 in 
the CCAA and 9-8 overall with victories over Cal State Dominguez Hills and 
Chapman. 
</P>
<P>
The Northridge women's team has also been a big surprise after a 3-12 
nonconference season. The Matadors are tied for first with Cal Poly Pomona at 
3-0. But Pomona, which has won or shared the CCAA title the last eight seasons, 
is still the heavy favorite to win the title. 
</P>
<P>
In the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference, the 
Claremont-Mudd-Scripps men are off to the best start at 4-0 in the conference 
and 14-3 overall. 
</P>
<P>
College Division Notes 
</P>
<P>
Goalkeeper Steve Goodson of Claremont-Mudd-Scripps has become the school's 
first first-team All-American selection in men's NCAA Division III soccer. 
Goodson, a senior, posted 33 shutouts in his career and 12 last season to lead 
the Stags to a 17-2-1 record and their seventh playoff appearance in the last 
eight years. Sophomore forward Mahntie Reeves, who had 13 goals and five 
assists last season, was selected to the second team. 
</P>
<P>
Steve deLaveaga, former Cal Lutheran basketball star and the school's all-time 
leading scorer with 2,549 points, has signed to play pro basketball with 
Nadawani of the Southeast Basketball League in Australia. He was the NCAA 
Division II scoring champion last season with a 28.1-point average. . . . 
DeLaveaga's younger brother, Jeff, is following in his footsteps at Cal 
Lutheran. A sophomore, he is among the NAIA leaders with a 26.8-point average. 
</P>
<P>
The Cal State San Bernardino women's basketball team extended its winning 
streak to 12 with an 86-79 victory over UC San Diego last week. Leading the way 
was sophomore guard Laura Beeman, who set a school record with 13 assists. The 
Coyotes are 13-3 and ranked No. 5 in the NCAA Division III West Region. . . . 
Kathy Goggin, former Cal State Dominguez Hills women's basketball star, has won 
the 1989 Woody Hayes National Scholarship Athlete Award presented by the 
University Sertoma Club of Columbus, Ohio. Goggin was one of six winners of the 
award that is presented to NCAA Division I, II and III athletes. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Bell, starting guard at Dominguez Hills, has left the men's basketball 
team to concentrate on his studies. Bell, a defensive specialist, was averaging 
4.3 points and 2.7 rebounds.

THE PREPS: SMALL RIO HONDO WINS BIG ON COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Calling Rio Hondo Prep a small school is a gross understatement, considering 
that the Arcadia school's enrollment is 50 students in grades 9-12. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the school's basketball programs are prospering. Rio Hondo holds the 
Nos. 1 and 2 positions, respectively, in the girls' and boys' Southern Section 
Small Schools Division polls this week. 
</P>
<P>
With only 31 boys and 19 girls eligible to play in a school that goes from 
kindergarten to the 12th grade, Rio Hondo's varsity teams have won 26 of 32 
basketball games this season, often beating larger schools. 
</P>
<P>
The high school division of the school opened its doors in 1964 and had its 
first varsity boys' basketball team in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Drain played on that first team as a sophomore and now, 24 years later, he 
is in his first year as coach of the Kares, a nickname derived from school 
founder Orrick W. Hampton's Care Youth Program. To Drain, things have not 
changed much at Rio Hondo Prep. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was going to school here, the high school only had 20 kids," said 
Drain, whose Kares were ranked No. 1 in the Small Schools' boys' poll until 
they lost to Pasadena Poly on Friday. "There may be a little more students here 
now but everyone still plays a different sport year-round." 
</P>
<P>
The Kares field three 10-player boys' basketball teams, freshman, junior 
varsity and varsity. 
</P>
<P>
The entire eight-man football team, which reached the Southern Section 
championship game this past fall, is on the basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
Drain's varsity Kares, with no player taller than 5-11, have a 13-5 record. "We 
have to approach things differently here," said Drain, who replaced Mike Dowd 
as coach this season. "We have to work hard on defense and always wait until 
the big guys bring the ball down to us. Our game is simply fast break and 
pressure defense." 
</P>
<P>
The leading scorers for the Kares, who do not have a senior on the team, are 
Todd Carson, a 5-11 junior center, and Mike Whiteside, a 5-9 sophomore forward, 
each of whom is averaging 14 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
A pair of sophomores start in the backcourt, Jeff Fairly, who averages more 
than six assists a game, and Jose Montanez. Rick Johnson, whose father, 
Randall, is the girls' basketball coach, is the team's leading rebounder, 
averaging eight a game. 
</P>
<P>
Almost all of Rio Hondo Prep's players participated in the Care Youth League 
near the school, which has proven to be an advantage and a disadvantage. The 
after-school program has helped in developing players, but it has also alerted 
larger nearby public schools to talented players. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not actively recruit players here," Drain said. "Sometimes we lose kids 
who played in our Care program to public high schools. Two of the top scorers 
in the area, Greg Mann at Arroyo and Mike Parisi at Arcadia, both played here." 
</P>
<P>
Whereas the boys' team is winning this season after finishing 8-13 a year ago, 
the girls are just picking up where they left off last season. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who also coaches the football and baseball teams and is the boys' 
athletic director, directed the Lady Kares into the semifinals of the Southern 
Section Small Schools playoffs last season with a team comprising only freshmen 
and sophomores. 
</P>
<P>
The Rio Hondo girls are 13-3 this season, having lost only to larger schools -- 
Palos Verdes Chadwick, Fullerton Rosary and Los Angeles Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
"We only have seven players on the team and they all played last season," 
Johnson said. "They all played together in our junior high school program, 
which is part of the reason we've been successful." 
</P>
<P>
Leading the way is sophomore point guard Pauline Hampton, the team's top 
scorer, and her cousin Alana Hampton, who leads in rebounds. They are 
granddaughters of the school's founder. 
</P>
<P>
The other key players for the Kares are sophomores Michelle Johnson, who 
averages 10 points a game; Linda Lunney, who averages 12 rebounds and 10 
points, and Mindy Sakamoto, who leads the team in three-point baskets. 
</P>
<P>
"Every game we go into, we are worried if we can play at the level of our 
opponent," Johnson said. "We never go into a game knowing that we're going to 
win. We have been very fortunate not to have any major injuries."

Wayne Gretzky is the player they would pick if they were starting a franchise, 
but Mark Messier is the NHL's best all-around player, according to a survey of 
NHL players by the Pittsburgh Press. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 123 players, about one-fourth of the league's active players, took 
part in the poll, held in conjunction with Sunday's All-Star game at 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
In the voting for best all-around player, Messier, the Edmonton Oilers' center, 
was picked on 64 ballots to 19 for Gretzky and 13 for Boston Bruin defenseman 
Ray Bourque. Pittsburgh center Mario Lemieux, the Oilers' Jari Kurri and 
Detroit's Steve Yzerman earned four votes apiece. 
</P>
<P>
Winnipeg's Thomas Steen was voted the most underrated player. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky, the King center who was held scoreless in the All-Star game, also was 
selected as the toughest player to defend against and was the runaway winner 
for best playmaker. He collected 102 votes to six for runner-up Lemieux. 
</P>
<P>
Lemieux, who won a record third most valuable player award Sunday by scoring 
four goals, was picked as the best puck handler and most likely to score on a 
breakaway.

MORE LAUGHS: Sen. Alan Cranston's move to placate victims of the Lincoln 
S&amp;L collapse (D1) is good news for comedian Jay Leno, above, who has been 
mining jokes from that mother lode for months. . . . Leno is hosting "The 
Tonight Show" all week, "and the stuff that works best there is sex and money," 
he said. "This is the ultimate money scandal of the '80s, plus the fall of the 
high and mighty." . . . A favorite: "Why was it called Lincoln Savings? Because 
Charles Keating walked 12 miles through a blizzard just to give $600,000 to a 
senator." Mark I. Pinsky and Steve Emmons

The altars on Monday were buried in chrysanthemums -- even more than the usual 
amount for a weekly service at the Chua Phat Giao Viet Nam tai Orange County, a 
Vietnamese Buddhist temple here. In the temple's yard, workers were putting the 
finishing touches on a platform in front of a gigantic statue of the Buddha of 
Compassion, to whom worshipers will be asking for new year's blessings. 
</P>
<P>
At the Vietnam Associates offices in Midway City, a scenery crew was busy with 
wood, paint, metals, cloth materials and custom lighting -- all to make 
backgrounds depicting various themes for the Tet festival scheduled to take 
place this weekend in Little Saigon. 
</P>
<P>
"All the volunteers are trying to work as quickly as possible because it's 
getting so close to the deadline," said Khang Quy Pham, one of the workers. 
"These are not ordinary backdrops; they're very elaborate. We have had to 
customize everything to fit the special needs of the numerous acts that people 
will see." 
</P>
<P>
About 250,000 people are expected to attend the two-day Tet festival welcoming 
the Year of the Horse, which begins Saturday according to the Chinese lunar 
calendar. The Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce in Orange County, sponsor of the 
event, has been preparing for this weekend since last March. 
</P>
<P>
The festival will open with a colorful parade along Bolsa Avenue -- the main 
street of Little Saigon -- and feature carnival rides, food booths, game booths 
and art displays. 
</P>
<P>
Entertainment director Thanh Thien Tran said groups will perform traditional 
dances and songs, Vietnamese bands will play Eastern and Western numbers, four 
martial arts teams will demonstrate their skills, and two casts of actors will 
perform a folk musical and a play. 
</P>
<P>
Admission is $3 for adults and $1 for children. Children under four feet tall 
can enter free. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past 14 years, the Little Saigon commercial district along Bolsa 
Avenue in Westminster and Garden Grove -- designated a tourist zone in 1988 -- 
has gained a reputation as the vibrant heart of Vietnamese business and culture 
in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
But this will be only the second year of such a full-scale celebration. Last 
year's festival drew hundreds of thousands but was considered only a qualified 
success. 
</P>
<P>
"We had many problems last year because we had only about six weeks to get 
everything done," said Dr. Co Long Pham, the chamber's president and an 
obstetrician and gynecologist in Fountain Valley. "Our fences and gates 
(surrounding last year's festival) were of flimsy materials so we had people 
coming in without paying. We were in the hole from the loss of money. This 
year, we have gone to a commercial fencing company and we have hired 35 
security guards to make sure there are not trespassers." 
</P>
<P>
Bolsa Avenue will be closed from Magnolia to Dillow streets from 7 p.m. Friday 
until early Monday morning, when the area will be reopened to automobile 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
After the organizers set up the stages, booths and fences Friday night, the 
gates will open at 10 a.m. Saturday. The parade will begin at noon at Bolsa and 
Dillow and end with a formal ceremony in front of a stage at Bolsa and 
Magnolia. 
</P>
<P>
For many of the 120,000 Vietnamese residents in Orange County, the eve of the 
new year will be spent giving traditional offerings to the God of Prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
The area's Buddhist temples will be open. And many Buddhists who have altars at 
home will set out meatless and sweet dishes to enable their ancestors or 
deceased family members to share in the new year's promise of good luck. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese lunar calendar, on which Tet is based, has a 12-year cycle. Within 
this cycle, the 20th Century began with the Year of the Rat. Next came the Year 
of the Ox, then the Tiger, the Hare, the Dragon, the Snake, the Horse, the 
Sheep, the Monkey, the Rooster, the Dog and the Wild Boar. Each of the 12 
animals traditionally has both positive and negative qualities. 
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese New Year celebration begins at the first new moon after the sun 
enters Aquarius. The day annually falls between Jan. 21 and Feb. 19. 
</P>
<P>
Pham said the festival's three purposes are to remind Vietnamese youth of their 
heritage, to share that heritage with the Western community and to help bring 
tourists to Little Saigon. 
</P>
<P>
"The way Tet is celebrated here is different from the way we celebrated it in 
Vietnam," Pham said. "It was normal to take a whole month off to really 
celebrate the holiday. Life here only allows us to celebrate it from two to 
three days. 
</P>
<P>
"The main difference is that like Christmas, we have had to commercialize Tet 
here. We still want to preserve the beauty of our culture and make our children 
proud of our roots. But the commercialization advertises about our culture and 
helps us to intermingle with the American society. And the bigger we make it, 
the more attention it will bring to Little Saigon." 
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese merchants along Bolsa Avenue have been bombarded with customers 
around the holiday for the past 10 years. Even without the festival, tourists 
from all over the country habitually pour into Little Saigon because it 
provides an authentic Vietnamese-cultural atmosphere, said Huong Thi Nguyen, a 
giftshop owner. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tet in Little Saigon 
</P>
<P>
What: The Vietnamese lunar year: a celebration combining the qualities of 
Christmas, Thanksgiving and Memorial Day. Vietnamese dress in their best 
clothes, feast and decorate their homes with red-colored chinese characters 
expressing wishes for happiness, prosperity and longevity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
When: Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 11 p.m. The opening ceremony at noon 
Saturday includes a parade along Bolsa Avenue from Dillow to Magnolia streets. 
Sunday events include six of the most popular Vietnamese local bands.

PROPOSED LEASE CALLED 'ECONOMIC BLACKMAIL'; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: NEW OWNERS OF TREASURE ISLAND MOBILE HOME PARK WOULD FINE TENANTS 
WHO PUBLICLY CRITICIZED THEIR PLANS. THE DISPUTE IS THE LATEST IN A 
LONGSTANDING FEUD. 
</P>

<P>
Under a new lease agreement proposed by the owners of the Treasure Island 
mobile home park, tenants would be forbidden to speak out publicly against the 
owners' long-term plans for closing the park and redeveloping 27 acres of prime 
oceanfront property. 
</P>
<P>
Tenants who criticize the landlords at a public forum or write letters of 
opposition to their development plans would be fined 25% to 50% of the value of 
their mobile homes, according to a copy of the lease agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Treasure Island Residents Assn. President Michael Kenney assailed the provision 
as "economic blackmail." Park residents apparently agreed, voting 
overwhelmingly at a tenants' meeting Sunday to reject the new lease, sending 
the tense negotiations to mediation. 
</P>
<P>
Treasure Island Associates, the park owner, had stipulated that it would not 
honor the lease agreement unless it was supported by 80% of the park's 265 
tenants. Instead, the agreement was defeated by 82%, Kenney said Monday after 
the ballots were counted. 
</P>
<P>
The recent dispute is the latest episode in a longstanding feud between park 
residents and Treasure Island Associates, which bought the property last 
August. The new owner originally had offered residents a 10-year lease that 
called for a 20% increase in lease payments their first year and 7% each 
subsequent year. Residents now pay between $400 and $1,700 per month depending 
on the size and location of their mobile homes. 
</P>
<P>
Residents said such increases would force them out, clearing the way for 
multimillion-dollar homes. In response to their complaints, the Laguna Beach 
City Council enacted sweeping changes last month that locked in zoning at 
Treasure Island and put a 70-day rent freeze on all three mobile home parks in 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, tenants and management have been negotiating to draft a new, 
10-year lease agreement. Once that expires, Treasure Island Associates would 
pay the tenants for their mobile homes, then redevelop the property. 
</P>
<P>
Richard A. Hall, a partner in the company, said Treasure Island Associates may 
consider replacing the mobile home park with an upscale hotel. He denied 
charges that the lease infringes upon tenants' rights, saying the company had 
made various concessions based on future income that would be derived by 
developing the property. 
</P>
<P>
"We're giving them a lot of things in the lease, so we didn't want to offer 
them a lease if they were going to continue to oppose us," Hall said. "It's not 
risk-free for us either. It's an agreement where we were going to give up some 
of our rights so these people would not oppose us." 
</P>
<P>
Tenants, however, were angered by what some called a "gag order." 
</P>
<P>
"What I find so obnoxious is not an abridgment of my rights because they can't 
force me to sign the lease," Kenney said. "But they are economically 
blackmailing people into giving up their First Amendment rights." 
</P>
<P>
Another resident who declined to give her name agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's scary when someone can force you under duress to sign something 
that takes away your civil rights," she said. "That kind of thing can snowball 
into all kinds of stuff. . . . I have the feeling they're going to get whatever 
they want anyway no matter how much we scream and moan."

<P>
BALANCING BUDGET A PRIORITY FOR CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Balancing the city's budget will be La Palma's greatest concern as the county's 
smallest city begins 1990, according to city officials. 
</P>
<P>
After the November defeat of Measure Q, a proposed 4% utility tax that would 
have raised money for the city's depleted general funds, the council must begin 
considering which services can be cut to save money, Councilman Richard Polis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The budget is a major problem and very hard to deal with," Polis said. "We may 
end up having to make some cuts that people won't be happy with." 
</P>
<P>
During the election, city officials said the council would try to make cuts in 
areas that would have the least impact on residents, and it would also begin 
exploring other revenue sources.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; 
</P>
<P>
STUDY SESSION WILL FOCUS ON MEASURE M 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Orange County Transportation Commission voted unanimously Monday to hold a 
Feb. 15 study session on whether to place another sales tax increase measure on 
the November ballot, a year after the last proposal failed. 
</P>
<P>
The panel also repealed an ordinance that had called for last fall's countywide 
vote on Measure M, the half-cent sales tax proposal that was rejected 52.6% to 
47.4%. 
</P>
<P>
Measure M would have raised $3.1 billion over 20 years for new freeway lanes 
(mostly limited to car pools), so-called regional "super streets," road 
repairs, and transit and commuter rail projects. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, the panel asked the OCTC staff to study the possibility of 
denying existing funds to cities that fail to comply with growth-control 
requirements. Such restrictions were included in Measure M but but would have 
applied only to a city's eligibility to receive new sales tax proceeds, not 
existing funds. OCTC controls about $16 million a year in state, federal and 
local transportation funds distributed among the county's 29 cities. 
</P>
<P>
The study is sure to tweak city officials, who are expected to argue that no 
new burden should be imposed on them. However, commission member Dana W. Reed 
said growth controls are needed in the cities to bring them into line with the 
growth-management policies adopted by the Board of Supervisors for the county's 
unincorporated areas. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews last week, most panel members said they favor repeating a vote on 
Measure M this November, possibly without any changes to the ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
Roger R. Stanton, a commission member and county supervisor, said Monday that 
he may ask that the long-proposed merger of OCTC and the Orange County Transit 
District be added to a revised Measure M, but just how many panel members agree 
with him remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
Even before the Transportation Commission set the sales tax study session for 
Feb. 15, critics rose during the meeting at the county Hall of Administration 
to call for a ballot proposal that would be dramatically different from Measure 
M. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year we supported placing Measure M on the ballot because we knew it was 
an unacceptable plan and that it would be defeated," leading to discussion of 
better, alternate proposals, said Bill Ward of Drivers for Highway Safety, a 
group opposed to car-pool lanes. 
</P>
<P>
"We were only half right," Ward said. "We underestimated the bureaucracy's 
tenacity." 
</P>
<P>
Referring to efforts to resurrect Measure M, Ward said: 
</P>
<P>
"It lost because it is a bad plan. Give it a rest. . . . The public will pay 
but only for transportation that we want." 
</P>
<P>
Ward said people sink tens of thousands of dollars into their automobiles and 
want new roads for those cars to travel on, "not schemes to force us out of our 
cars." 
</P>
<P>
"In short," Ward said, "show some respect for the taxpayers." 
</P>
<P>
Ward suggested that a user fee, specifically a local gasoline tax that would 
not be used for car-pool lanes or transit, is preferable to Measure M and 
"would almost assuredly pass." 
</P>
<P>
But Ward did not provide details, such as the amount of such a local gas tax, 
or what projects it would finance. 
</P>
<P>
The OCTC staff has previously concluded that a local gasoline tax would take a 
two-thirds majority vote countywide and would have to be 19 cents per gallon to 
raise as much money as a half-cent sales tax. State and federal gasoline taxes 
already total 18 cents per gallon.JEFFREY A. PERLMAN

RULING DELAYED ON DEVELOPMENT PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City officials have delayed a final ruling on the development of businesses and 
houses on 37 acres along Santiago Creek. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council referred Burnett-Ehline Development Co.'s proposal back to the 
Planning Commission for further review. 
</P>
<P>
Although the commission recommended in December that the council deny the 
proposal for the Santiago Golf Course property, the plan has been modified to 
meet some of the commission's concerns. 
</P>
<P>
An alternative plan presented to the council replaces the previously proposed 
extension of La Veta Avenue from Tustin Street to Cambridge Avenue with a 
landscaped greenbelt featuring walkways and bike paths. 
</P>
<P>
Although some residents speaking at the 1 1/2-hour public hearing last week 
said they support the proposal, many expressed concerns about traffic, noise, 
the possibility of flooding and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
The commission is scheduled to consider the development Feb. 5. The council 
will consider the project again Feb. 20.SHANNON SANDS

COYOTE HILLS FUTURE IS WORKSHOP TOPIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council and two of its commissions will hold a workshop at 7 p.m. 
tonight to consider the future development of the Coyote Hills area, the 
largest piece of undeveloped land in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
The council will meet with members of the Planning Commission and the 
Redevelopment Design Review Committee in room B of the library at 353 W. 
Commonwealth Ave., next to City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting is open to the public. 
</P>
<P>
Undeveloped land in the Coyote Hills, which is in the north side of the city, 
is used mostly for oil and gas pumping. The land is expected to be developed 
more extensively as more of the wells run dry. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to development, the members will discuss an update of the general 
plan and consider the role of the Redevelopment Design Review Committee, which 
makes recommendations to the Planning Commission on the physical design of 
building projects inside community-improvement zones.

ADMINISTRATORS GRANTED PAY RAISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Irvine Unified School District Board of Trustees has voted to give top 
administrators a 12% pay raise, 6% a year for two years. 
</P>
<P>
"The raise paralleled those given the teachers and classified personnel," said 
Paul Reed, deputy superintendent for business services. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers were given 6% raises each year for three years in November and 
classified, or non-certificated, employees have been given 6% raises for the 
next two years, Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
The increase pushed the salary of Supt. David Brown to $91,584 a year, Reed 
said. The four other top district administrators and their current salaries are 
Bruce Givner, deputy superintendent for special education, $80,779; Dean 
Waldfogel, assistant superintendent for curriculum, $79,285; Reed, $77,848; and 
Susan Long, assistant superintendent for personnel, $76,627. All raises were 
retroactive to July 1, 1989, the beginning of the fiscal year.

RANCH STILL A RANCH ON 44,000 ACRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stepping outside of his Irvine Ranch farm headquarters on a recent late 
afternoon, Pete Changala surveyed the skyline. He was looking for clouds, but 
not necessarily for rain. 
</P>
<P>
"If it clouds up, it stays warmer at night," Changala explained. "When it's 
clear, the temperature can drop into the high 20s. Of course, 32 degrees is the 
threshold. When it freezes, we can have some crop damage." 
</P>
<P>
Crop damage is something Changala constantly looks out for as director of the 
agricultural division of the huge Irvine Co. home-building and land-management 
empire. 
</P>
<P>
Overnight lows on the ranch and the adjacent Saddleback Valley farmland have 
stayed in the high 30s so far this winter, nothing like the freezing 
temperatures that have plagued farmers in Texas and Florida, two of 
California's major agricultural competitors. 
</P>
<P>
"In Texas, the weather got down into the teens, meaning they actually lost some 
of their citrus trees," Changala said. "That's devastating for a farmer. It's 
one thing to lose part of a crop and have some damage. It's another to lose the 
trees altogether." 
</P>
<P>
Changala, 30, watches over what has become a diminishing ranch program. Long 
gone are the heyday of lima beans and such crops and the old warehouse off Sand 
Canyon Avenue near the Santa Ana Freeway -- now the site of a La Quinta Inn, 
Tia Juana's and Sirius Cellars. 
</P>
<P>
"As the Irvine Co. has evolved and land values in Southern California have 
become astronomical, the farming business has changed around here," said 
Changala, who was born on the Saddleback Valley's Moulton Ranch. "This has 
become an urbanized area. Grading controls have increased. We have to get 
permits for any agricultural grading, just like a development. Pesticide 
controls are very strict. We can't start our machines up until 7 a.m. and we 
have to shut them down at 5. It makes it very difficult to compete with the San 
Joaquin Valley." 
</P>
<P>
But 44,000 acres of Irvine Ranch land are still being farmed or used for 
pasture. And while oranges remain the No. 1 crop, necessity has mothered the 
invention of newer, hybridized vegetables. The first seedless melons were grown 
on the ranch and, these days, red (Sunworld's Le Rouge Royales), yellow and 
even orange bell peppers are being harvested, patented and given a trademark. 
</P>
<P>
"We seem to be taking a lot of our directions from the Israelis, who are great 
innovators when it comes to farming," Changala said. "The Israelis have 
developed a new strawberry variety and a new tomato variety with a longer 
shelf-life." 
</P>
<P>
With the ranch flatlands gradually being taken over by new homes, local farmers 
are now turning to planting on the hillsides, thanks again to techniques from 
the Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
"Avocados are often grown on hillsides because the trees are non-sensitive and 
can adapt to the poorer soil you find on a hillside," Changala said. "But we 
also have some tomatoes, cabbage, squash, strawberries and bush beans growing 
on the hillsides." 
</P>
<P>
Strawberries used to be the second biggest crop on the ranch, but they are 
gradually being replaced by bell peppers, Changala said. Celery and asparagus 
are also beginning to disappear at the ranch, although not completely. 
</P>
<P>
"Our early-season berries get air-freighted to Europe and the Far East," 
Changala said. "Most of our asparagus go to Europe, to the high-end market. 
Ninety percent of our Valencia oranges go by boat to the Far East, places like 
Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and Japan. For some reason, they really like our 
oranges. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Educating buyers is part of a grower's job in a specialized market, according 
to Changala. A group of Korean buyers recently visited the ranch to taste the 
avocados, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"They loved our avocados, which were new to them. You have to educate people 
about different products. The Koreans had not seen a lot of avocados. But then 
a lot of our own people from the Midwest don't know what avocados are either," 
Changala noted. LEN HALL

SOS FEARS CITY IS BACKING AWAY FROM ITS PLEDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Directors of the uprooted charity Share Our Selves expressed fear Monday that 
city officials appear to be backing away from their pledge to help the agency 
relocate to a new site. 
</P>
<P>
Their comments came in response to the city's latest proposal to help SOS 
relocate from its current home at the Rea Community Center to a building on 
West MacArthur Boulevard that also houses the Community Development Council, a 
private anti-poverty group. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council today is scheduled to consider a revised plan that places 
significantly more of a financial burden on SOS and enhances the financial 
position of the CDC. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very obvious that the rules have changed" since last week, SOS Executive 
Director Jean Forbath said shortly before the SOS board was to meet to discuss 
the city's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the council endorsed a plan to help SOS move to quarters in the CDC 
building, at 1695 W. MacArthur Blvd., under terms that called for the city to 
assume almost the entire cost of the lease payment. 
</P>
<P>
Under the revised plan, however, SOS would assume at least 25% of the lease 
payment and, among other conditions, would be required to make an up-front 
deposit of its total obligation. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Peter Buffa had announced the initial proposal at a press conference two 
weeks ago and said it was intended to be a "safety net" for the problem-plagued 
charity, which Buffa and a council majority recently ordered to vacate its home 
of nine years at the city-managed Rea center. 
</P>
<P>
SOS directors have said all along that they would accept the CDC move only as a 
last resort. 
</P>
<P>
But the latest city proposal now places SOS in an even more precarious 
position. It can accept conditions that directors believe are not in the 
charity's best interests, or it can reject the CDC move and hope that it can 
quickly find a suitable building on its own. If not, it faces closure. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever course SOS takes is complicated by the fact that the city has virtual 
veto power over where the agency can locate. 
</P>
<P>
Any move will require a special permit and public hearing by the city's 
Planning Commission, at which point the charity is likely to face opposition 
from the surrounding community. City Manager Allan L. Roeder said Monday that 
the revised proposal reflects the recently "improved financial circumstances of 
SOS" and is not an attempt to renege on the city's offer of help. 
</P>
<P>
When it appeared that SOS might have to close after being ordered to move from 
the Rea center, the charity received a flood of contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Forbath said, however, that the bulk of the contributions -- an estimated 
$300,000 to date -- are contingent on the charity purchasing its own building.

BOYS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: TEAM'S BALANCED SCORING GIVES MCCORKLE THE EDGE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
As the leading scorer of Capistrano Valley High School's Southern Section 5-A 
champion boys' basketball team last year, Scott McCorkle figured to lead the 
Cougars again this season. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents braced to stop McCorkle, a 6-foot-5 forward who signed a letter of 
intent in November to attend Syracuse in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
"He's had two people running at him in every game we've played," Coach Mark 
Thornton said. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, McCorkle, The Times' Athlete of the Week, is averaging 27 points a 
game, three points above his regular-season average last year. 
</P>
<P>
He had 25 points and nine rebounds in a 74-52 victory over Dana Hills 
Wednesday. And he had 26 points as the Cougars defeated El Toro, 74-51, 
Saturday and moved into a tie with Mission Viejo for first place in the South 
Coast League. 
</P>
<P>
But Thornton said the key to the Cougars' success is balance. And not just 
balance between McCorkle and his neighbor, point guard Chris Kostoff, who had 
20 points and nine assists against Dana Hills and 26 points and nine assists 
against El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, after a 64-47 loss to Mater Dei, the top-ranked team in 
Orange County, in which McCorkle and Kostoff scored 41 points, Thornton decided 
the Cougars were depending too much on the pair. In one practice, Thornton 
prohibited McCorkle and Kostoff from shooting, and in games, he told the rest 
of the team to take more shots. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to try to get some of the other kids involved in the offense and we 
have accomplished that," Thornton said. 
</P>
<P>
McCorkle said his teammates' willingness to take more shots gives him and 
Kostoff more opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
"It opens up a lot of things for me and Chris because they have to guard the 
other guys too now," McCorkle said. 
</P>
<P>
TOP PERFORMERS 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Carlson scored 33 points in Katella's 80-71 victory over Cypress Friday. 
Carlson also scored 20 in a 70-53 loss to Esperanza Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Orange goalkeeper Tres Martin had two shutouts -- his sixth and seventh of the 
season -- as the Panthers won two Pacific Coast League soccer matches. Martin 
had 12 saves in Orange's 2-0 victory over Laguna Hills Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Savanna wrestler Tony Okada pinned Richard Martinez of Covina to win the 
132-pound division in the Five Counties Tournament at Fountain Valley Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Robbie Shelton of Western had 30 points and 18 rebounds as he led his team to a 
67-48 victory over Anaheim Friday. He had 27 points and eight rebounds in 
Western's 63-51 loss to Brea-Olinda Wednesday.

<P>
Because she is 6-feet-2 and starts at center for Woodbridge High School, Deanna 
Harry is bound to get rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
But last week, Harry found herself putting the basketball through the hoop and 
not just grabbing the ones that bounced off it. 
</P>
<P>
Harry, The Times' Athlete of the Week, had 29 points, 23 in the first half, and 
16 rebounds to lead Woodbridge in a 69-38 victory over Trabuco Hills Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I had scored over 15 by halftime, but I didn't think it was that much," 
Harry said. "My role on the team is rebounding. But (Trabuco Hills) was playing 
a defense designed to stop our guards, so I got a lot of baskets." 
</P>
<P>
Harry had 21 rebounds in a 65-31 victory over Laguna Hills Thursday and had 20 
more in a 76-52 nonleague victory over Estancia Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
What's with the big week? 
</P>
<P>
"Away games," Harry said. "I don't know what it is exactly. On the bus ride 
over there I have time to think about the game and visualize. When we play at 
home we talk more before the game." 
</P>
<P>
Now people are starting to talk more after the game too. 
</P>
<P>
"She came out for basketball on a whim as a 5-9 freshman and grew so fast in 
the next year and a half -- you couldn't believe it," Woodbridge Coach Eric 
Bangs said. "She's still a little gangly . . . but she works hard on footwork 
and positioning." 
</P>
<P>
TOP PERFORMERS 
</P>
<P>
La Habra's Leslie Ferguson scored 48 points in two games. 
</P>
<P>
The guard tandem of Michelle Harris and Valerie Ruiz led Kennedy to two 
victories. Harris had 42 points and seven steals in the two games and Ruiz had 
a total of 51 points. 
</P>
<P>
Amy Jalewalia had 33 points and seven rebounds to lead La Quinta to a 64-30 
victory over Los Amigos Wednesday, and had 32 points, nine rebounds and six 
assists in an 82-39 victory over Garden Grove Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman Amber Parkinson had eight goals in three soccer matches for Orange 
Lutheran, including three goals in one game twice. 
</P>
<P>
Laurie Sallinger set an Orange High School record for assists in a game when 
she had 11 assists and eight points against Laguna Beach Tuesday. Sallinger 
also had seven assists and 10 points in a 62-53 victory over Costa Mesa on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In a 56-43 victory over Esperanza, Wanda Sequeira had 13 points and seven 
assists to set Tustin's single-season assist record at 145, breaking the mark 
set in 1979 by Mary Hegarty.

CRANSTON TO SEEK RELIEF FOR LINCOLN BONDHOLDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sen. Alan Cranston said Monday he will introduce legislation, perhaps as early 
as today, to allow bondholders hurt by the collapse of Lincoln Savings &amp; 
Loan and its parent firm to sue the federal government for negligence in 
approving the sale of the bonds. 
</P>
<P>
The California Democrat, whose political career has been jeopardized by the 
Lincoln Savings scandal, also released a copy of a letter he sent to the 
Justice Department last week asking for help in letting bondholders seek relief 
from the government. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston's proposed bill is aimed at helping some 22,000 small investors 
recover nearly $200 million in debt securities in Lincoln's parent, American 
Continental Corp. The investors are mostly elderly people who bought their 
bonds at Lincoln's 29 Southern California branches. Many mistakenly thought the 
bonds were insured by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
"What has happened to these bondholders is one of the most tragic events that 
have occurred during the time that I have been in the Senate," Cranston said. 
"Many of them are now bereft of all their resources. They can't pay their rent. 
They can't pay for decent food. They can't even heat their homes." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a separate development in Washington, House Banking Committee 
Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.) said Monday that the committee will decide 
today whether to subpoena junk bond financier Michael Milken as part of the 
continuing investigation of Lincoln and other failed thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston's efforts to aid the bondholders comes at a time when polls show that 
his popularity is at an all-time low because of his involvement in the Lincoln 
debacle. Bondholders in particular have blamed Cranston and four other senators 
for intervening with regulators in 1987 during a long audit of the Irvine-based 
S&amp;L's financial condition. 
</P>
<P>
Had regulators taken action against Lincoln then, they maintain, most of them 
would not now be holding worthless bonds. Instead, regulators seized Lincoln 
last April 14, a day after American Continental filed for bankruptcy 
protection. The S&amp;L failure may become the costliest ever, with a 
$2-billion bill for taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing his proposal Monday, Cranston said that documents he received 
from the General Accounting Office provide "clear evidence" of negligence on 
the part of federal thrift regulators and the Securities and Exchange 
Commission in approving the bonds for sale and in monitoring how the company 
sold the bonds. He earlier had asked the GAO to determine if taxpayers were 
liable for the bondholder's losses. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston's bill would waive sovereign immunity, which precludes most suits 
against the federal government. In the Lincoln case, it would allow bondholders 
to look to the government for any losses they don't recover in pending 
litigation against American Continental executives, including its controversial 
chairman, Charles H. Keating Jr., and the lawyers and accountants who advised 
them. 
</P>
<P>
In his letter to Atty. Gen. Richard Thornburgh, Cranston asked the Justice 
Department to waive the immunity provision, which would allow bondholder suits 
to be filed more quickly. He also asked Thornburgh to apply whatever funds the 
government recovers in civil judgments or possible criminal action to 
bondholders first. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston's office said Congress or the attorney general grants waivers in a 
dozen or more egregious cases every year. 
</P>
<P>
Bondholders and their lawyers, who have been highly critical of Cranston in the 
past, were generally appreciative of his help. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe Sen. Cranston is sincere," said Shirley Lampel, who met with the 
senator for more than an hour in her home last Thursday. "The idea may be a 
good one and I'm happy to hear it, but I just don't know if it's possible to 
get done," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for bondholders also welcomed Cranston's proposal, Bondholder lawyer 
Ronald Rus of Orange called it a "backstop" proposal that would cover whatever 
losses remain after pending litigation is completed. 
</P>
<P>
"There are professionals as well as the Keating group who all bear legal 
responsibility for losses," said William Lerach, a San Diego bondholders' 
lawyer. "Many of them have significant insurance, and it's in everybody's 
interest to go after that and exhaust that before we ask the taxpayers to pay." 
</P>
<P>
Another lawyer, Richard Greenfield of Philadelphia, said Cranston's suggestion 
was "very constructive and will receive serious consideration in the Senate." 
But, he said, "a number of people are going to look at Sen. Cranston's 
suggestion as self-protective." 
</P>
<P>
Cranston, the Senate majority whip, is one of five senators under investigation 
by the Senate Ethics Committee over their 1987 intervention with regulators on 
behalf of Lincoln and American Continental. Keating had raised more than $1.3 
million for the senators' campaigns and their causes. Cranston got the biggest 
share, with more than $39,000 in campaign contributions and $850,000 in 
donations to three nonpartisan voter registration groups he supported. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston cited testimony before the House Banking Committee, which has been 
looking into Lincoln's collapse, to show that federal regulators themselves 
believe they hold "primary responsibility" for approving American Continental's 
debt securities, excluding approvals from any other agencies under securities 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Gonzalez said that the committee would meet today to conduct 
hearings on the operation of the Resolution Trust Corp., the agency formed last 
August to oversee the restructuring of the thrift industry. 
</P>
<P>
He also said the committee would consider whether to subpoena Milken and two 
other individuals connected to Lincoln. Milken, who made a fortune selling junk 
bonds for corporate takeovers, is under indictment for securities fraud and 
insider trading. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez said the appearance of Milken would signal a new phase in the 
investigation of thrift failures and "will concentrate on the extent to which 
trading in junk bonds and subordinated debt contributed to the collapse of 
Lincoln.

AGENCY TAKES ON GANGS IN AD CAMPAIGN; 
</P>
<P>
MEDIA: FRANKEL &amp; ANDERSON IS USING RADIO AND TV IN AN EFFORT TO ADDRESS 
URBAN PROBLEMS. IT IS THE AGENCY WHERE KAREN TOSHIMA, WHO WAS KILLED BY A GANG 
MEMBER IN WESTWOOD, WORKED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It is a chilling anniversary. Two years ago this month, Karen Toshima, a 
27-year-old advertising agency art director, was shot in the head and killed in 
random gang violence in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
Since that time, gang violence has only grown worse. And so has the sense of 
helplessness of many Los Angeles area residents. But the Van Nuys ad agency 
where Toshima worked has decided to take action -- not just for her, but for 
all victims of gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
"The role of advertising is to motivate people," said Rob Frankel, president of 
Frankel &amp; Anderson. "If we can sell soap flakes, I'm convinced we can also 
sell social good." 
</P>
<P>
With that in mind, Frankel &amp; Anderson has created a series of print ads 
that urges Southern Californians to make a stand against gangs and graffiti. 
And it has enlisted two of the city's media powers -- KABC-Talkradio and 
KABC-TV -- to help create and air public service announcements that address 
urban problems. 
</P>
<P>
The ad campaign has been named "Turn the Tide." 
</P>
<P>
Beginning this month, print and broadcast advertisements will try to persuade 
Los Angeles residents to dial a 900 telephone number -- 1-900-USA-TURN -- to 
help stop gang violence. When people dial that number, they will automatically 
be donating $2 to one of several local, anti-gang educational groups. Those who 
call will also be given further information on how they can help fight gangs. 
</P>
<P>
The four-person ad shop isn't trying to tackle the gang problem alone. Nearly a 
year ago, it enlisted the help of KABC Talkradio, which is spearheading the 
effort. In fact, the station will air on Thursday a special four-hour show on 
gangs featuring radio talk show host Michael Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
"This is something we probably should have done years ago," said Nelkane 
Benton, director of community relations at the station. "We look at this as 
just a beginning, not an end." Other corporate sponsors of the campaign are the 
Vons grocery chain, which will promote the campaign in its stores and in 
advertisements, and Main Street Dairies, which will run "Turn the Tide" ads on 
its milk cartons. 
</P>
<P>
The agency's first print ad -- which appears in today's Times -- is an entire 
page filled with what looks like spray-painted graffiti. The headline to that 
ad says, "The next thing they spray is bullets." 
</P>
<P>
One print ad the agency created -- but eventually decided to drop -- may be the 
most provocative of all. The ad features a large swastika above the headline, 
"It started out as gang graffiti too." 
</P>
<P>
"Needless to say, the ad would have caused a sensation," said Frankel. "The 
feeling was that the ad brought up too many racist images." 
</P>
<P>
The money raised from the ad campaign will mostly go to six local grass-roots 
organizations dedicated to reducing gang violence. Among the largest of those 
groups is Community Youth Gang Services. That nonprofit group is seeking nearly 
$1 million to fund its program of sending specialists to inner-city schools to 
talk about gangs with children ages 10 to 12. 
</P>
<P>
"The object is to cut off membership at the grass-roots level," said Schuyler 
Sprowles, public affairs consultant with the group. "It's no panacea. But it's 
better than anything else that's available."

LITERACY: PEOPLE WHO CAN'T READ IN ORANGE COUNTY NUMBER IN THE THOUSANDS, BUT 
OPPORTUNITIES TO PROVIDE THAT BASIC NEED ARE GROWING.

As his young daughters cuddled next to him one recent evening, Geno Godinet 
read them bedtime stories in a slow, deliberate tone. A year ago, Godinet used 
to recite the same fairy tales by memory because he couldn't read. 
</P>
<P>
Then, the 40-year-old elevator repairman decided to do something about his 
reading problem. 
</P>
<P>
After nearly one year of weekly tutoring sessions, Godinet not only can read 
stories to his daughters but can also perform the everyday reading and writing 
tasks that he needs on his job. 
</P>
<P>
"More and more reading is required," Godinet said. 
</P>
<P>
There are an estimated 23 million adults in the United States who are 
illiterate -- and several hundred thousand of them in Orange County. Studies 
have found that 15% of the nation's work force is functionally illiterate. 
</P>
<P>
For businesses, the cost of re-educating illiterate workers is staggering. In 
1988, private corporations nationally spent $25 billion on programs to teach 
basic reading and writing skills to their employees, according to the National 
Alliance of Business in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
And, according to a report from the Literacy Volunteers of America, 99% of all 
workers perform some reading-related work each day. To keep pace with the job, 
they need to read an average of 113 minutes each day. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, Orange County companies have been taking steps to address the literacy 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
Fourteen local companies, for example, contributed money to the Newport Beach 
Public Library literacy program and took part in the first Business Spelling 
Bee for Literacy in Newport Beach last Friday. The spelling bee, sponsored by 
the library, is intended to boost awareness about illiteracy in the county. 
Organizers hope to make this an annual event. 
</P>
<P>
Lucinda Zirkelbach, assistant account executive for InterCommunications Inc. in 
Newport Beach, says the spelling bee "is one excellent way of getting the word 
out to companies that there is a (literacy) problem." 
</P>
<P>
Some businesses are striving to improve their employees' reading and writing 
skills by setting up in-house literacy programs. 
</P>
<P>
Ricoh Electronics, a Tustin-based electronics manufacturer, started a 
English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) program in late 1988. More than 80% of 
Ricoh's 1,300 employees are minority workers, most of whom are Latino. A 
company official estimated that more than 20% of the firm's employees are 
illiterate. 
</P>
<P>
The ESL program is free to Ricoh and its employees, with the cost of the 
program paid by the state Department of Education. It is offered as an extended 
course at Rancho Santiago Community College. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 Ricoh employees already have completed the literacy program. And the 
Japanese-owned firm is so pleased with the results that it plans to continue 
the program, said Rino Zaccuri, a company spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"The classes are free to employees, and the students learn skills in chart 
reading and inventory. The classes also are geared toward survival skills: 
banking, reading traffic signs and everyday things (such as in) grocery 
stores," Zaccuri said. 
</P>
<P>
Jo Caines, director of community relations for KOCE-TV in Huntington Beach and 
coordinator of the county chapter of Project Literacy U.S., a national literacy 
program, said that businesses are becoming more aware of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"They are realizing that if their employees are illiterate, it definitely 
affects the economy," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the company-run programs, there are more than 70 other literacy 
services throughout the county, sponsored by libraries, churches, schools, 
nursing homes and other organizations, according to Keri Gee Barnett, 
chairperson of the Literacy Communications Coalition, a literacy project 
coordinated by the Public Relations Society of America. 
</P>
<P>
"There are many (people) falling through the cracks who don't read. We hope 
that anybody who is not an effective reader will know there are literacy 
providers in the county. All they have to do is call for help," Barnett 
advised. 
</P>
<P>
Another project is the Literacy Is for Everyone (LIFE) lab at Orange Coast 
College in Costa Mesa. The lab, designed to teach people to read and write, is 
scheduled to open in March. Funded by contributions from businesses, the lab 
has received $72,000 in cash and $14,000 in computer equipment from 12 
companies. About $12,000 more is needed to get the program under way, said 
Douglas C. Bennett, executive director of the Orange Coast College Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Godinet, the elevator repairman, turned to the Newport Beach Public Library's 
literacy program because he wanted to improve his career options. He realized 
that, without the ability to read, he would be unable to complete even a simple 
task, such as filling out an employment application. 
</P>
<P>
For most of his career, Godinet, who works for Montgomery Elevator Co. in 
Irvine, managed to get along by learning his skills through 
on-the-job-training. But he says it is getting harder and harder for people 
like him to find jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Godinet, who now reads at about a sixth-grade level, said he is no longer 
embarrassed about his reading problem. But he remembers how, in the past, he 
used to fear that his co-workers would discover his illiteracy. 
</P>
<P>
"At work, there were many instances when I would be humiliated," he recalled. 
"When I would make the lunch run, the other workers would tell me to write down 
the order list, but I couldn't write. People caught on and started making fun 
of me. They would ask, 'You don't know how to read?' It got to be a joke. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel all that bad now because I am doing something about it," he said. 
"There are times in your life when you just have to put things behind you. This 
may help someone else in the same situation and maybe they will do things 
better for themselves."

WESTERN DIGITAL RECOVERS FROM 1ST-QUARTER LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Western Digital Corp. rebounded from a first-quarter loss, with earnings of 
$8.6 million for the second quarter ended Dec. 31, though the profits were down 
from the $12.7 million recorded for the corresponding period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine-based personal computer components company reported revenue of 
$264.9 million, the second-highest quarterly figure in the firm's history, 
contrasted with $258.4 million in the second quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
The earnings figure included a one-time gain of $1.1 million from the purchase 
of debentures and $1.1 million in tax benefits from the first-quarter loss. 
</P>
<P>
The recovery from the first-quarter loss of $2.7 million exceeded analysts' 
expectations and was largely attributed to the success of the company's 
3.5-inch intelligent disk drives. The company said its communications products 
operations also did well, but problems remained in the imaging sector, which 
makes computer graphics products. 
</P>
<P>
Roger W. Johnson, chairman and chief executive, said he was "pleased with the 
direction, not pleased with the absolute level" of the company's earnings. He 
also noted "very nice improvements" in the balance sheet, as inventories and 
receivables declined even as revenues climbed. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Payne, an analyst with Wheat First Butcher &amp; Singer in Philadelphia, 
said earnings were "a bit better than everybody expected," and lauded the 
"impressive" performance of the disk drive products. She added, however, that 
there are "still some problems to work through." 
</P>
<P>
"The real problem is that they have five different product lines and they've 
never been able to get them all firing at the same time," Payne said. She also 
said that increased competition in the disk drive area might hurt profit 
margins over the next year. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Matheson of Cruttenden &amp; Co., a Newport Beach investment firm, said 
the quarter "could have been a blockbuster" were it not for the problems with 
the imaging business. Western Digital acknowledged that its microcomputer 
products unit -- including the imaging, communications and systems logic 
products -- was unprofitable, largely as a result of poor sales and low margins 
in the imaging business. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said he hoped the microcomputer products division would be profitable 
by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
A company spokesman said the company expected to sustain the strong performance 
in disk drives, with substantial increases in orders for the next several 
quarters. Johnson also said the firm was succeeding in its effort to get 
customers -- primarily personal computer manufacturers -- to buy groups of 
products from Western Digital.

TED TURNER'S TNT EXPLODING ONTO THE CABLE SCENE; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: NETWORK FOR CLASSIC MOVIE BUFFS EXPANDS HORIZONS WITH ITS OWN 
PRODUCTIONS AND ADDED EMPHASIS ON SPORTS. 
</P>

<P>
It was the big bash for the launching of TNT, Ted Turner's cable channel 
forclassic-movie buffs. Standing onstage at the Trump Plaza hotel in Atlantic 
City, N.J., Turner ceremonially threw the switch on TNT. 
</P>
<P>
The first film to be shown on the new network was a movie that the Atlanta 
entrepreneur had loved for years: "Gone With the Wind." As Clark Gable and 
Vivien Leigh appeared on a large video screen, Turner, according to an 
observer, looked up and quietly said to nobody in particular, "Well, it cost me 
a billion dollars, but it's worth it." 
</P>
<P>
At one time, Turner was virtually alone in that assessment. When the creator of 
Cable News Network went to Hollywood in 1986 and paid more than $1 billion for 
the rights to "Gone With the Wind" and the other 3,300 titles in the MGM film 
library as part of his $1.5-billion purchase of the MGM/UA Entertainment Co., 
financial analysts said that Turner had overpaid by a significant margin. 
</P>
<P>
The MGM/UA deal so burdened Turner's company, Turner Broadcasting System Inc., 
with debt that the lone gun who had taken on the Big Three networks was forced 
to take in Time Inc. and other major cable-system operators as corporate 
partners. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, I identified with Rhett Butler as a kid and wanted to own 'Gone with the 
Wind,' " Turner said in a recent interview. "But what we needed was the bulk 
and quality of the MGM library. And it turned out to be a good deal for us." 
</P>
<P>
Born of heart or head or both, TNT has proved to be one of the most successful 
new channels in the crowded cable field. Launched on Oct. 3, 1988, TNT is now 
available to about 40 million cable TV subscribers across the country. An 
advertiser-supported, basic-cable channel, TNT is offered to subscribers as 
part of the package of channels that comes with their monthly cable fee. 
</P>
<P>
TNT is not on the list of the 10 largest cable networks, but it is one of the 
fastest-growing cable networks. It didn't hurt that many of Turner's cable 
partners gave TNT a base of subscribers to start with, but industry analysts 
say its growth is still a big hit at the cable box office. 
</P>
<P>
"There was little doubt that TNT would be successful over time," says Larry 
Gerbrandt, a cable analyst with Paul Kagan Associates. "What was surprising was 
that it was in the black by the end of its first year. What looked like an 
expensive deal ultimately turned out to be a smart move." Gerbrandt places the 
current value of TNT at $700 million. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to offering some 250 films a month, TNT recently has been expanding 
into making its own made-for cable TV-movies. The ratings are small by network 
standards, but not by cable's, and they're attracting some well-known actors. 
The TV-movies -- now averaging about two a month but due to increase to four 
per month in 1991 -- range from a remake of "Dinner at Eight" with Lauren 
Bacall and Harry Hamlin to a biography of photographer Margaret Bourke-White 
starring Farrah Fawcett to an eight-hour adaptation of William L. Shirer's "The 
Nightmare Years," about the rise of the Third Reich, with Sam Waterston and 
Marthe Keller. Its most recent production, a new version of "Treasure Island" 
with Charlton Heston and Oliver Reed, premiered Monday night and repeats 
Saturday, Feb. 1 and 24. 
</P>
<P>
The network also is going after Hollywood film makers interested in pursuing 
projects for TV. Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment company last month 
signed a deal to produce a series of teleplays by American playwrights for TNT. 
The dramas, which will be performed by a repertory company of actors, are 
expected to start airing in the spring of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
And continuing a trend that may bring sorrow to sports fans who think it's 
un-American for sports not to be on "free" broadcast TV, TNT also is joining 
other cable networks in buying the rights to major TV sports events. TNT is 
airing some 70 National Basketball Assn. games this winter. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, in what was said to be the first sale of Olympics events to 
basic-cable TV, TNT has agreed to pay CBS Sports $50 million to air 50 hours of 
live events during the 1992 and 1994 Winter Olympics. TNT will carry several 
hours of events live during the day, with an overnight rebroadcast of the CBS 
prime-time coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Although TNT executives say theatrical films will remain the mainstay of the 
network, the moves into other areas of programming are designed to 
differentiate the network and appeal to younger, upscale viewers in prime time. 
</P>
<P>
"The good news/bad news about a 'vertical' cable channel like TNT is that 
people feel they can tune in any time to see movies," said Scott Sassa, 
executive vice president. "We want to create events in prime time, including 
our best movies, that will compete with the broadcast networks." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the MGM film library, which includes RKO Studios and pre-1950 
Warner Bros. movies, Turner recently acquired the rights to 1,000 Columbia 
Pictures films, including such hits as "Tootsie," for TNT and his superstation, 
TBS. The Warner library ranges from "Gone With the Wind" and "Casablanca" to 
such lesser-known films as "Dangerous Female," a 1931 mystery billed as the 
first screen version of Dashiell Hammett's novel "The Maltese Falcon." 
</P>
<P>
(Turner, with Time Warner and Denver-based Tele-Communications Inc., two of his 
most powerful shareholders, reportedly has been in on-again, off-again 
negotiations to add the United Artists film library to his collection through a 
bid for MGM/UA Communications Co. The sale is said to be off for now.) 
</P>
<P>
Other cable channels and network TV stations offer old movies, of course. But 
in addition to the films in its library, TNT offers freshly minted prints -- 
and clever repackaging. 
</P>
<P>
"We struck all brand-new prints and tried to package them with a combination of 
reverence and fun," said Gerry Hogan, president of TNT. The promotional 
materials aim for hip movie-lovers, and films on the network may be grouped by 
star, subject matter or even similar titles. One recent triple-feature: "He 
Couldn't Say No," "She Couldn't Say No" and "She Had to Say Yes." 
</P>
<P>
Classics are there, but movie fiends who want to revel in a Lupe Velez festival 
or a "good trash" B picture can find what they're after. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, while Turner has outraged many film makers with his colorization of 
classic American movies on TBS, TNT tends to plays its black-and-white films 
unadulterated. 
</P>
<P>
"Colorization is an issue that people associate Ted with," says Sassa. "But 
showing the original black-and-white versions seems more congruous with this 
channel." 
</P>
<P>
The reviews for TNT's own made-for-TV movies have been generally positive. 
"Dinner at Eight" and "Man for All Seasons" were criticized as lesser, 
unnecessary remakes. But such recent TV-movies as "Cold Sassy Tree," with Faye 
Dunaway, and the Holocaust drama "Max and Helen," have been praised by some TV 
critics. 
</P>
<P>
As TNT expands into sports and other areas, it may run the risk of alienating 
some of its core audience. Will there still be a happy ending for the audience 
that made TNT a surprise hit, the people in the dark (to quote Norma Desmond in 
"Sunset Boulevard") who like their Bette Davis straight? 
</P>
<P>
"Our primary identity is as a classic-movie channel," Hogan said. "We won't be 
walking away from that."

APOLLO FLIGHTS SEND PRODUCER ON A MISSION; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: AL REINERT USES FOOTAGE FROM NINE APOLLO MOON VOYAGES TO CREATE 'FOR 
ALL MANKIND.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ten years ago, Texas magazine writer Al Reinert made a trip to the Johnson 
Space Center in Houston to research an article commemorating the 10th 
anniversary of man's landing on the moon. Until then, he had not followed 
America's space program with unusual interest and certainly could not have 
foreseen that his sojourn inside the vaults of the NASA archives would 
eventually uproot him from his familiar free-lance writer's desk and hurl him 
into the quixotic role of independent film maker. 
</P>
<P>
But that is what happened, as is now evident from the release of Reinert's 
decade-in-the-making documentary about the moon missions, "For All Mankind," 
now playing a limited engagement at the Cinerama Dome, Crest in Westwood, and 
other selected theaters. 
</P>
<P>
The feature-length film he made is a brand of poetic nonfiction. The voices of 
13 astronauts narrate a composite voyage to the moon, assembled from rarely 
seen NASA footage taken during the nine manned Apollo flights and underscored 
by the quietly ethereal guitar lines of art rock composer Brian Eno. 
</P>
<P>
Like fellow journalist Michael Moore, who made the recent movie "Roger &amp; 
Me," Reinert had no previous experience in motion pictures when he began his 
film odyssey in 1979. Initially, he was armed only with $30,000 raised from 
friends and the knowledge that most of the film shot by NASA during the 
historic Apollo missions was technically in the public domain. The biggest 
problem was, there were 2,000 hours of it. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody can walk into the NASA film archives and do film research," Reinert 
said during a visit to Los Angeles, where the film opens today. "I was just the 
first fool who said, 'I want to see all of it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Reinert moved to Houston, where for two years he sat down almost every day with 
a NASA film librarian to look at film of the Apollo flights. Eventually, he 
logged more time there than all three television networks combined. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the first time I had an awareness of it as film instead of just boring 
TV stuff. I thought, 'Why has this never been on a big screen?' It was my naive 
writer's reaction to it. I mean, I wasn't a film maker, but I thought, this is 
a movie that I would like to see." 
</P>
<P>
He had arrived at a good time. The Apollo program was finished and the first 
space shuttle launch was still a few years away. "All these people at NASA had 
nothing better to do than sit around and tell you their stories. That's when I 
met the first astronauts I'd ever met. Most of them were retired even then, and 
so they no longer had NASA looking over their shoulders. And as individuals 
they had had time for the experience to have settled and percolated a bit." 
</P>
<P>
Reinert talked to all 24 men who had flown to the moon and recorded 80 hours of 
interviews with 20 of them. The interviews revealed something surprising that 
would shape the movie: the experience the astronauts remembered most vividly 
was not going to the moon but leaving the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
"Apollo had always been portrayed as going to the moon. It never occurred to me 
that that's really secondary," Reinert said. "The moon's just the first place 
you can stop. But what was really meaningful to these guys, if you talk to 
them, what sticks in their minds was leaving the Earth . . . because for days 
they watched the Earth shrink! 
</P>
<P>
"What I heard from all these men was the story of a spiritual journey, much 
more than a technical achievement." 
</P>
<P>
Reinert made the decision early on to "scramble all the missions together," in 
order to create a single representative trip in the narrative. He said the 
astronauts themselves encouraged him to do this. 
</P>
<P>
"My attitude is that it's historical trivia that there were nine different 
missions. Most people aren't even aware of that after only 20 years. The story 
we tried to tell from the beginning was a subjective story -- what was it like 
to leave Earth? It's not about the space program, it's not about NASA." 
</P>
<P>
NASA is not even mentioned in the film. 
</P>
<P>
"What we were trying to do from Day One was make the movie that people would 
watch in 500 years when they want to know about this. Had there been a camera 
crew with Columbus, we'd still watch that movie and that was 500 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Each of the Apollo missions carried at least three movie cameras aboard for the 
astronauts to use, as well as cameras mounted inside the stages of the rocket 
to capture close-up pictures of a separation 70 miles above the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
"For All Mankind" also includes such exotica as platform-level footage of a 
blast-off taken by a camera that was melted in the process and startling 
moonscapes of astronauts hopping up and down in song like boys on a playground. 
</P>
<P>
These are images most Americans have never seen before, but such originality 
was not enough to get the movie made or distributed in less than 10 years. 
Reinert, 42, used up his initial investment to make a 10-minute sample to show 
investors, but it wasn't long before he was back looking for magazine 
assignments to pay his bills. 
</P>
<P>
"We showed that 10 minutes to whoever would look at it and raised the next 
bunch of money, about $75,000, and went back to work," he said. "That's been 
the history of the whole project." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, a limited partnership was put together and $600,000 was raised. In 
all, Reinert and co-producer Betsy Broyles Breier tapped 40 Texas investors to 
cover the film's $1.5 million budget. 
</P>
<P>
"We were not great fund-raisers," Reinert said. "It took us two years to sell 
17 partnership units of $33,000 each. We're not talking Donald Trump here." 
</P>
<P>
But Reinert, a bearish, garrulous Texan, was not without the gift of 
persuasion. Back in 1983, when he was still editing parts of the rough cut in 
his Houston living room and listening to assorted records in search of a 
suitable sound track, he sent off a six-page letter to Brian Eno asking for his 
help. 
</P>
<P>
Two months later Eno booked six weeks of studio time with his own money to 
score the film. "He hasn't been paid anything yet," the director said. 
</P>
<P>
"For All Mankind" was finished a year ago and shown for the first time at the 
U.S. Film Festival in Park City, Utah, where it won the grand jury prize for 
best documentary. It has gone on to showings at festivals in Tokyo, Munich, 
Montreal, Toronto and last week Palm Springs, earning support along the way 
from George Lucas, Robert Redford and the Sierra Club, Earthwatch and other 
environmental groups. 
</P>
<P>
But it has not found a Hollywood distributor. 
</P>
<P>
In November, Reinert and executive producer Fred Miller decided to go directly 
to theater owners, essentially booking the film themselves into five theaters 
in San Francisco and Seattle "to see if we were right or not, or if we were 
complete fools." 
</P>
<P>
The film did more than $200,000 worth of business in four weeks, which led to 
later bookings in Los Angeles, Texas and, next month, the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
"Off and on I think the most I ever got paid was $600 a week," Reinert recalled 
of his decade-long film labors. "And I got that sporadically. But mostly I paid 
the bills as a magazine writer. I had a lot more money 10 years ago than I have 
now."

SOVIET THREAT EASING: CIA; 
</P>
<P>
EAST BLOC DEFECTION A SEVERE BLOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The director of the CIA told Congress today that Eastern Europe's tumultuous 
push for democracy has cut the Soviet threat to the West and that "we can 
probably expect a continued diminution." 
</P>
<P>
William H. Webster, in an unusual public appearance before the Senate Armed 
Services Committee, said that as unchallenged Communist control comes to an end 
in the Eastern Bloc, those nations' links to Moscow have been radically 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
The result, he said, is a severe blow to the Soviet Union's certainty that 
Eastern Europe will respond to Moscow's military directives. 
</P>
<P>
The armed services committee is beginning work on writing a defense budget for 
fiscal 1991 with an assessment of the Soviet threat to the West. 
</P>
<P>
"Overall, the conventional threat to the United States and our alliance 
partners in Europe has decreased as a result of changes in Eastern Europe and 
Soviet force reductions," Webster told the panel. 
</P>
<P>
The CIA director cautioned, however, that the Soviet Union is vigorously 
upgrading its strategic forces. 
</P>
<P>
Webster cited the Soviets' deployment last year of two new silo-based nuclear 
missiles, the continued deployment of SS-25 and SS-24 rail-mobile missiles and 
the launching of new Typhoon and Delta-IV ballistic missile submarines. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets also have made considerable gains in the anti-submarine effort, but 
they still "will be unable at least in this decade to threaten U.S. subs in the 
open ocean," Webster said. 
</P>
<P>
In what appeared to be a plea to head off budget cuts for the CIA and other 
intelligence agencies, Webster said the United States must maintain its 
intelligence capability. He pointed to the continued Soviet strategic 
modernization and to terrorism, illegal drugs, uncertainty in Latin America, 
Asia and the Middle East and weapons proliferation. 
</P>
<P>
Intelligence operations are hidden in the Defense Department budget, which 
faces significant cuts on Capitol Hill this year. Although the exact figures 
are secret, U.S. intelligence reportedly spends $25 billion to $30 billion a 
year, just under 10% of the defense budget. 
</P>
<P>
In his public statement, Webster emphasized that the situation in Eastern 
Europe and the Soviet Union is in constant flux, with widespread economic 
problems, turmoil in regional areas and the Communist Party's reduced power. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is committed to reforms, but they have 
been slow in coming, the CIA director said. The chance of Gorbachev's removal 
as Kremlin leader is unlikely, and a major reversal of his policies would come 
only if he is removed from power, Webster said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, "we can probably expect a continued diminution -- but not 
elimination -- of Soviet threats to U.S. interests," the CIA director said. 
</P>
<P>
A question-and-answer period was held in closed session. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Gen. Harry Soyster, the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, agreed 
with Webster, telling the committee that the threat of "deliberate aggression 
directed against Europe and its extension to global conflict is much reduced."

WOMAN IN BARRY'S ARREST TESTIFIES; 
</P>
<P>
EX-MODEL WHO LURED MAYOR TO HOTEL TALKS TO GRAND JURY

The one-time model who helped lure Mayor Marion Barry to a Washington hotel and 
allegedly provided him with cocaine in a "sting" operation appeared today 
before a federal grand jury investigating Barry's activities. 
</P>
<P>
Rasheeda Moore, who reportedly lives in Burbank, Calif., with her husband and 
three children, was brought by police and FBI agents to U.S. District Court for 
secret testimony behind closed doors. 
</P>
<P>
Moore, who sources said called Barry to the hotel room where he was arrested 
Thursday night, spent about 2 1/2 hours in the grand jury room after entering 
the courthouse under tight security. She said nothing as she entered or left 
the building through the back door. 
</P>
<P>
Moore, 38, presumably gave the grand jury details about how she invited Barry 
to Room 727 of the downtown Vista International Hotel, allegedly sold him crack 
cocaine and then watched him smoke it. 
</P>
<P>
"You set me up!" an angry Barry reportedly said to Moore when police and FBI 
agents burst into the hotel room and arrested him. Secret cameras had filmed 
the liaison, the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
Her testimony to the grand jury could lead to filing of other criminal charges 
against Barry in addition to the misdemeanor charge that Barry already faces 
for possession of crack, a potent and highly addictive smokeable form of 
cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Barry's defense lawyer has said he would plead not guilty to the charge, which 
carries a maximum one-year prison term and a $100,000 fine, and that he will 
demand a jury trial. 
</P>
<P>
Moore is in the protective custody of the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
Also today, Barry's press secretary said that he "sounded fine" when she spoke 
to him by telephone at the Hanley-Hazelden drug and alcohol treatment facility 
in West Palm Beach, Fla., that he entered on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Spokeswoman Lurma Rackley said she did not know how long Barry would be in the 
drug and alcohol treatment center where she said "he's being treated for 
alcoholism." 
</P>
<P>
The center normally has a monthlong program for treatment. It has often treated 
celebrities, including Kitty Dukakis, wife of Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. 
Dukakis, for diet pill addiction in 1982.

An Israeli sought for the December drug-related slaying of a Tarzana man has 
been arrested in New York City, where he was attempting to obtain a visa to 
return to his native country, police said today. 
</P>
<P>
David Hagag, 29, apparently used a small piece of plastic to try to slash his 
wrists Saturday when he learned from Israeli consul officials in Manhattan that 
instead of giving him a visa, they were going to hold him for police, Los 
Angeles Police Detective Rick Swanston said. 
</P>
<P>
Hagag was not seriously hurt in the apparent suicide attempt and was jailed at 
Rikers Island prison pending extradition proceedings. Hagag has been charged 
with the Dec. 27 slaying of Simon Sarkissian, a Tarzana man who police say was 
involved in drug dealing.

FBI SEEKS 'MR. MCGOO' BANDIT LINKED TO O.C. BANK ROBBERIES

<P>
The FBI today released a photograph of the "Mr. McGoo Bandit," believed to have 
staged five bank robberies in Orange County during the last year. 
</P>
<P>
Dubbed "Mr. McGoo" because of his thick glasses and his resemblance to the 
popular cartoon character, the bandit struck again a week ago, robbing the 
Laguna Hills branch of the Wells Fargo Bank, the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
FBI officials say investigators have linked the bandit to the robbery of the 
Household Bank in Westminster on Jan. 30, 1989. Since then, officials said, he 
has also robbed the Wells Fargo Bank in El Toro and is believed to be 
responsible for two robberies within a week at a Western Federal Savings &amp; 
Loan office in Seal Beach last year. An FBI spokesman declined to disclose the 
amount of cash taken. 
</P>
<P>
Agents describe "Mr. McGoo" as being about 60 to 65 years old; weighing 165 
pounds; 5 feet, 8 inches tall with brown graying hair balding in front. He has 
a tattoo on his right forearm. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone with information about "Mr. McGoo" is asked to call the FBI at (714) 
542-8825 or (213) 477-6565.

Hungarian Premier Miklos Nemeth said today that the Soviet Union has agreed to 
withdraw all its armed forces stationed in Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
Nemeth told Parliament that he and Soviet Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov agreed 
that there is no political or military reason for their continued presence, and 
that talks on a timetable for withdrawal will be held shortly in Budapest. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union has had more than 50,000 troops stationed in Hungary since 
Soviet tanks quashed the 1956 Hungarian uprising. 
</P>
<P>
"The strategic and military geographic position of Hungary makes it possible to 
withdraw Soviet troops from Hungary fully and without any risk within the 
shortest time," Nemeth said. 
</P>
<P>
Hungary does not border on any member of the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization.

The justice minister today said jailed black leader Nelson Mandela definitely 
will be freed and might be asked to be a mediator between the government and 
the outlawed African National Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Hendrik J. Coetsee, in an interview with the newspaper of the governing 
National Party, said the question no longer was whether Mandela would be 
released, "but when and under what circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
Coetsee was responding to widespread speculation that Mandela will be freed 
within the next few weeks, but he gave no indication when the release would 
occur. 
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet is to meet Wednesday in Cape Town. South African political 
correspondents said Mandela's release is certain to be discussed, as well as 
the possible lifting of the 30-year ban on the African National Congress, which 
Mandela led when he entered prison in 1962.

President Bush's spokesman today shrugged off news reports that Colombian drug 
lords are plotting to shoot down Air Force One and voiced confidence in the 
Secret Service's ability to protect the President. 
</P>
<P>
"The Secret Service says it can provide the President security and the 
President intends to go" to a drug summit in Cartagena, Colombia, next month, 
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the Colombian ambassador to the United States, Victor Mosquera 
Chaux, dismissed the report. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe Colombian terrorists don't yet have missiles," he said. "I believe 
that it's a simple rumor. If they had them, they would have used them already" 
against government helicopters and aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Mosquera said his government is "confident that we can and will provide the 
necessary security required for this meeting." 
</P>
<P>
CBS News reported Monday the Secret Service was checking reports that Colombian 
drug lords were smuggling SA-7 shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles into 
Colombia for an attack on Air Force One when Bush attends the meeting Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
But Fitzwater said his own inquiries on the matter had drawn a blank and that 
the Secret Service apparently also is unaware of such specific threats. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody here seems to have heard of missiles," Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the Secret Service "has made several survey tours" to the summit site 
and is convinced it can protect the President. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and the presidents of Colombia and Bolivia are expected to sign an accord 
to fight drug traffickers at the Cartagena meeting. Peruvian President Alan 
Garcia says he will send a minister in his stead unless U.S. invasion forces 
are out of Panama by then. 
</P>
<P>
CBS said some warnings of threats against Bush are being dismissed as attempts 
by informants to curry favor with law enforcement officials, but that the 
surface-to-air missile threats are being taken seriously. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Times said it had confirmed the gist of the CBS report. Both news 
organizations quoted unidentified sources.

Facing a possible jail sentence, Houston lawyer Craig Washington was sworn in 
as Texas's 18th District congressman today, only one day after being found in 
contempt of court for the second time in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Found in contempt of court in Harris County, Tex., Monday by a judge who 
accused him of abandoning his clients, Washington was flanked by members of the 
Texas congressional delegation as he was sworn in during a brief floor ceremony 
at the start of the 1990 congressional session. 
</P>
<P>
Washington, a Democrat, won a special election in his district in December to 
replace the late Rep. Mickey Leland, also a Democrat, who died in a plane crash 
with 15 others during a hunger mission to Ethiopia last August. 
</P>
<P>
"I could never replace Mickey Leland," Washington told his new colleagues after 
his swearing in. "I'm merely his successor. I'm not here to serve as king of 
the hill. I'm on the bottom of the hill, and I need your help."

Stock prices closed widely mixed today as traders, still pessimistic about 
interest rates and corporate earnings, picked up blue chip issues but shied 
away from secondary stocks. 
</P>
<P>
The blue chips posted moderate gains after bouncing up and down throughout the 
day. However, the broader market was lower for much of the session. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 14.87 to 2,615.32. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a margin of about 5 to 4 on the New 
York Stock Exchange, with 659 stocks up, 848 down and 471 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 179.30 million shares, against 148.38 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index rose 0.40 to 183.60. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said there was not enough buying momentum for the market to recover 
from Monday's sharp drop, in which the Dow industrial average fell more than 77 
points. 
</P>
<P>
"Investors and speculators don't have the courage to buy secondary stocks," 
said Michael Metz, an analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's decline was attributed to concerns about interest rates and lower 
corporate profits, and analysts said those fears lingered on Wall Street today. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Baker, head of block trading with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., said the 
selling wave seemed to be running out of steam, but that the market had no 
reason to start a rally. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices sagged and interest rates moved up this morning as a negative mood 
prevailed in the credit market. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond lost 9/32 point, or about $2.60 per 
$1,000 in face amount. Its yield, which goes up when prices go down, rose to 
8.33% from 8.30% late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
A strong indication that the market is stuck in the doldrums came Monday, when 
it failed to react much to a steep plunge on Wall Street, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 7.92% as the discount increased 2 
basis points from Monday's auction average to 7.67%. Yields on six-month bills 
dipped to 7.96% as the discount edged 1 basis point lower from Monday's auction 
level to 7.56%. Yields on one-year bills rose to 7.96% as the discount went up 
2 basis points to 7.42%. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other for overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8 3/16%, compared to 8 1/8% late Monday.

Gordon Buehrig, who revolutionized automotive design with such masterworks as 
the Duesenberg Model J, the Cord 810 and the Auburn Boattail Speedster, died 
Monday. He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
The son of a banker in Mason City, Ill., Buehrig dropped out of Bradley 
University in Peoria to work as a body shop apprentice in Wayne, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
Buehrig, the dean of classic automotive design, crafted cars that tickled the 
imagination and were unconstrained by the limits of mass marketing. 
</P>
<P>
The Cord 810 was the talk of the 1935 New York Auto Show. Not only was it one 
of the earliest front-wheel drive cars, it also featured flip-up headlights and 
allowed drivers to step, rather than climb up, into a car for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
In 1951, the Museum of Modern Art selected the Cord as one of the outstanding 
automotive designs of all time.

</P>
<P>
Gov. Bob Martinez and his Cabinet suspended Katie Tucker for 10 days with pay 
to allow her to explain her role in the Revenue Department probe of businesses

<P>
Resha unsuccessfully ran against Tucker's husband, Daniel Miller, for president

</P>
<P>
Resha's bookstore and two video stores were subjected to a five-month 
investigation into allegations of pornography and sales tax violations. 
</P>
<P>
The probe found no wrongdoing, but the businesses were then audited. The audit 
found that Resha owed $588.18 in taxes, penalties and interest, which he paid.

Chrysler Corp., retrenching in the face of a slumping and bruisingly

toward the end. 
</P>
<P>
General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co., the other Big Three U.S. auto makers, 
also had a rough time and are expected to report lower fourth-quarter earnings, 
the analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
They said Chrysler could report a loss of as much as $280 million, or about 
$1.20 a share, in the final three months of 1989, mainly because of more than 
$300-million worth of write-offs attributed to staff cutbacks and a plant 
closing. 
</P>
<P>
"Chrysler will be several hundred million dollars in the red after the 
write-offs," said independent auto analyst David Healy. 
</P>
<P>
The company is expected to report fourth-quarter results on Feb. 13, and Ford 
and GM will report later that week. 
</P>
<P>
The last time Chrysler lost money was in the fourth quarter of 1982, when it 
had a deficit of about $96 million. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler's present difficulties have prompted some comparisons with its 
situation in the early 1980s, when it was struggling back from near-bankruptcy 
and the entire U.S. auto industry was mired in recession. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that it is now a stronger company but that the auto market it 
faced in 1989 was one of the most treacherous in years. 
</P>
<P>
The annual selling rate in December fell as low as 5.5 million cars, a level 
analysts consider recessionary. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler responded by drastically cutting production, temporarily closing 42 of 
62 assembly plants in the United States and Canada in January alone. 
</P>
<P>
At Chrysler, the anticipated write-offs are strictly accounting measures, and 
on an operating basis the company will probably break even or earn up to 9 
cents a share in the last quarter of 1989, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
But this is a pittance compared to the $1.85 a share earned in the same period 
in 1988, or the $1.19 and $1.56 expected by Shearson Lehman Hutton analyst 
Joseph Phillippi for GM and Ford respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the expected losses, analysts say the write-offs are as well-timed as 
they could be, given the dismal state of the auto business. "1989 turned out to 
be a very difficult year. You might as well take as many charges as you can," 
Phillippi said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. car sales bounced back in this month's most recent period, but analysts 
remain cautious about the industry's 1990 prospects, given the continued high 
levels of unsold cars on dealer lots.

General Electric Co. today reported that both its fourth-quarter and full-year 
earnings soared 16% to $1.17 billion and $3.94 billion respectively, due to 
gains in its financial services, plastics and medical systems units. 
</P>
<P>
GE, one of the world's largest industrial conglomerates, makes everything from 
light bulbs, appliances and aircraft engines to television programs. 
</P>
<P>
"This was the third consecutive year of strong double-digit earnings 
increases," Chairman John Welch said in a statement, citing improved full-year 
performances in GE's core businesses. 
</P>
<P>
In heavy midday trading, GE shares were unchanged at $62.875. It was the 
second-most-active issue on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Welch said GE's operating margin of 11.3% of sales, a company record, reflected 
continued productivity improvements companywide and worldwide revenue gains. 
</P>
<P>
GE said its longer-cycle businesses were also very strong, with 1989 aircraft 
engine orders of nearly $8 billion.

MILLI VANILLI, TRAVIS AND DANCERS STAR AT AMERICAN MUSIC AWARDS

<TEXT>
<P>
German duo Milli Vanilli and country crooner Randy Travis were triple-winners 
Monday night as dance music dominated the 17th Annual American Music Awards. 
</P>
<P>
Five dance acts -- Janet Jackson, Bobby Brown, Paula Abdul, rapper M. C. Hammer 
and New Kids On The Block -- each won two awards, along with heavy-metal 
rockers Guns 'N Roses. 
</P>
<P>
Nominees were compiled from year-end charts in the music industry trade 
publication Cash Box. Winners were selected by 20,000 members of the public 
chosen on the basis of age, sex, geographic location and ethnicity. 
</P>
<P>
Milli Vanilli, an international duo with a lively pop sound capitalizing on 
dance trends crossing different music styles, beat stiff competition during the 
three-hour show broadcast live on ABC-TV Monday night at the Shrine Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
The duo won favorite new pop-rock artist over critically acclaimed rockers 
Living Colour and the all-star collaboration of the Traveling Wilburys. 
</P>
<P>
They also upstaged Bon Jovi's "I'll Be There For You" and Gloria Estefan's 
"Don't Wanna Lose You" to win the pop-rock single trophy with "Girl You Know 
It's True." 
</P>
<P>
Milli Vanilli, also the favorite new soul-rhythm &amp; blues artists, dedicated 
their crystal obelisk trophies to the stirrings of freedom in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to say that this is a symbol of freedom and peace in the world and for 
East and West Germany," Rob Pilatus, a member of the duo and a native West 
German, said backstage. 
</P>
<P>
Travis claimed all three awards in the country category, defeating George 
Strait and Hank Williams Jr. for favorite male vocalist and besting Alabama's 
"If I Had You" and Strait's "Baby's Gotten Good at Goodbye" for favorite single 
with his "Deeper Than the Holler." 
</P>
<P>
Travis' "Old 8 X 10" LP was the favorite country album. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, sister of pop superstar Michael Jackson, won for her "Miss You Much" 
single in both the dance and soul-rhythm and blues categories. 
</P>
<P>
Abdul, the vivacious ex-cheerleader for the Los Angeles Lakers, won two of four 
nominations, female pop-rock vocalist and favorite dance artist. 
</P>
<P>
Teeny bop sensation New Kids On The Block won the pop-rock album trophy for the 
"Hangin' Tough" LP and also were named favorite pop-rock group. 
</P>
<P>
For the eighth consecutive year, the group Alabama was named favorite country 
duo or group.

SNOOPY CREATOR SCHULZ RECEIVES FRENCH HONOR

Cartoonist Charles Schulz drew lofty praise from the keepers of French culture 
today as they lavishly celebrated the 40th birthday of America's favorite 
floppy-eared dog, the irrepressible Snoopy. 
</P>
<P>
The beagle was glorified with a giant retrospective at the Decorative Arts 
Museum. 
</P>
<P>
French Culture Minister Jack Lang named Schulz a "commander of arts and 
letters," one of France's highest awards for excellence in the arts. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank you for being the creator of Snoopy, full of humor and with a zest for 
life," Lang told Schulz. "Your character is both mythical and hedonistic and he 
has taken over our collective consciousness and become a part of our everyday 
lives." 
</P>
<P>
Schulz, 67, beaming but appearing slightly embarrassed by all the fuss, said 
that when Snoopy was a World War I flying ace, he asked him how he learned to 
speak French. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he had a small tourist phrase book but he told me you only really need 
to know one word, and that is merci," Schulz said in English. 
</P>
<P>
The show opens to the public Wednesday and runs through April 22.

Sixteen of the 24 tenured musicians of the Minneapolis Chamber Symphony have 
quit after abstaining from voting on a contract proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The musicians issued a statement Monday saying the orchestra's board had 
threatened to disband the orchestra if the musicians didn't ratify the 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
They said the board also threatened to sue the union if the musicians pursued 
in further negotiations their wish for significant input in artistic decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Brad Eggen, union president, said the 18-month contract was ratified by a 
majority of the eight remaining tenured musicians who voted on it Sunday. "We 
were committed to accepting the best possible offer from the management," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Orchestra Manager John Coughlin said he has no plans to cancel any concerts. 
"We've got a Rolodex full of people who want to audition for this orchestra," 
he said. "We anticipate we'll have musicians of as good -- or better -- 
caliber."

ASK DR. RUTH: SENILE FATHER CAN BUMP SEX FROM WIFE'S PRIORITY LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. RUTH WESTHEIMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Q. My wife has been ducking sex with me for about half a year, beginning when 
we had to put her father in a home for the aged, to which he never consented 
and has never made any adjustment. He is demented and makes a very difficult 
resident. Among his misbehaviors is asking all the female staff for sexual 
favors and going into the unlocked bedrooms of the women residents when they 
have been tucked in at night. This upsets my wife and I think it has turned her 
against all male sexuality. 
</P>
<P>
A. I doubt that. I don't know everything about the situation, but it would be 
typical of your wife to become obsessed with this to the point of losing sexual 
interest. Women become so engrossed in the many things that they are expected 
to be in charge of and on top of all the time that they always have in their 
heads a shopping list or check-off list. This is great for getting lots of 
things done -- and so many women get almost everything done, don't they? But 
they are worried about what they have forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
Now, this preoccupation with everything all at the same time can be kept up 
while cooking, while doing the work at the office, while driving in rush-hour 
traffic, while giving the bathroom a last-minute scouring just before the 
dinner guests arrive, while all kinds of things. But it is sheer destruction to 
having a sexy, self-arousing image in the head. So it happens that thousands of 
women who would like to be getting close to orgasm are instead going over that 
list of items. 
</P>
<P>
Your wife has a difficult thing to get used to. She has to accept that she has 
reached a point with her father where nothing much can be done. He will not 
respond to her daughterly attentions and efforts. 
</P>
<P>
No sign comes from this old man that he has any regard for her. For being 
unable to reach him she feels guilty. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, you are not a monster for wanting things to be as they used to be 
between you and her, but I think you have to put sex-sharing on the back 
burner. What your wife needs now is support and affection. 
</P>
<P>
And the affection should not seem like a sexual approach. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe she doesn't want sex, but she would like lots of what went with it like a 
nice dinner out and you maybe wearing something other than that old Popeye 
sweat shirt. This is a time to be reminded that a man can also be sweet and 
protective, not just clamoring for intercourse.

Teen-age amateur sensation Angelica Gavaldon turned her back on $24,000, saying 
she's not sure she's ready to play tennis for a living. 
</P>
<P>
Gavaldon, 16, made the quarterfinals of the Australian Open, her first Grand 
Slam tournament, before losing 6-4, 6-3 to West German Claudia Porwik today. 
</P>
<P>
"The money is tempting," Gavaldon admitted. "But I want to be sure I'm ready. 
This is the type of thing that makes you want to turn pro." 
</P>
<P>
Gavaldon, taking 11th-grade classes by correspondence, has yet to decide 
whether she wants to play full time on the tour or go to college. 
</P>
<P>
If she turns professional, she will be ineligible to play in NCAA competition. 
</P>
<P>
"One tournament is not enough," she said. "I think I should play a couple more 
and see how I do. I just want to be really sure about my decision." 
</P>
<P>
The Coronado, Calif., resident came through three qualifying rounds at the Open 
with a ranking of 192. She then beat No. 7 Hana Mandlikova, a two-time champion 
here, and No. 15 Gigi Fernandez on the way to the quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Gavaldon was the youngest quarterfinalist in the Open since Carling Bassett in 
1983 and is now ranked in the top 100. 
</P>
<P>
Gavaldon's performance in the Open lifted her to the forefront of the new wave 
of young players set to challenge top-ranked Steffi Graf over the next few 
years.

AUSTRIAN SKIS TO 2ND STRAIGHT WORLD CUP WIN

Richard Kroell won his second straight World Cup giant slalom today and, for 
the second time, led a 1-2-3 finish by Austrian skiers. 
</P>
<P>
Kroell, who had never won a World Cup event until 10 days ago, had two 
near-flawless runs over a course made bumpy by hard artificial snow. 
</P>
<P>
He beat teammate Hubert Strolz by more than half a second. 
</P>
<P>
Rudolf Nierlich, winner of two gold medals in the 1988 World Championships, was 
third. 
</P>
<P>
Pirmin Zurbriggen, bidding for his fourth overall World Cup title before 
retiring from the tour, finished 14th and lost some of the cushion in his lead 
in the overall standings. 
</P>
<P>
Christian Ole Furuseth, his closest rival, was fourth today and now trails the 
Swiss skier by 22 points after 20 of 34 scheduled races. But the Norwegian 
slalom specialist avoids the downhill races. 
</P>
<P>
Kroell, a 21-year-old in his third season, produced a major surprise when he 
won at Alta Badia, Italy, earlier this month. That was the first victory in his 
career, and it moved him up to the elite first 15 starters at Veysonnaz. 
</P>
<P>
Starting 10th today, he had the fastest first run after clocking the best 
intermediate time. On the second, he was edged only by Kjetil Andre Aamodt, a 
19-year-old Norwegian newcomer to the World Cup tour. 
</P>
<P>
Aamodt finished sixth after being 14th in the first run. 
</P>
<P>
Veysonnaz was a race site for the first time, replacing the traditional 
Adelboden venue because of bad weather. 
</P>
<P>
The course features a drop of 1,320 feet, with 53 gates on the first leg and 56 
on the second.

Four of the finest players in UCLA basketball history -- Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, 
Bill Walton, Ann Meyers and Denise Curry -- will be honored at halftime of the 
Bruins' game against DePaul on Feb. 3 when their uniform numbers will be 
retired. 
</P>
<P>
The four numbers -- Abdul-Jabbar's 33, Walton's 32, Meyers' 15 and Curry's 12 
-- will be the first UCLA basketball numbers ever retired. 
</P>
<P>
All four players received All-America honors at least three times. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel this will be the highlight of our season-long celebration of Pauley 
Pavilion's 25th anniversary," UCLA Athletic Director Peter T. Dalis said. 
"Certainly, we have had many great players perform in Pauley during its 
illustrious history, but these four are at the head of the class." 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar, known as Lew Alcindor during his career at UCLA, led the Bruins 
to three national championships and a three-year record of 88-2. 
</P>
<P>
Walton led the Bruins to two national championships and a three-year record of

PERLES TO REJECT JETS' JOB OFFER, TRUSTEE SAYS

Michigan State Coach George Perles, who has been offered the New York Jets' 
coaching job, will reject the offer and remain at his alma mater, a member of 
Michigan State University's board of trustees said. 
</P>
<P>
The trustees, in an effort to keep Perles at Michigan State, will formally 
offer him the job of athletic director tonight at a board meeting, one trustee 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Perles is expected to accept the athletic director job, a position he has 
coveted since it became available. 
</P>
<P>
"George received an informal offer from the Jets and he will turn it down," 
said the board member, who claimed that he spoke with Perles Monday evening. 
</P>
<P>
Perles met with Jets General Manager Dick Steinberg on Monday in Hempstead, 
N.Y., presumably to hammer out a deal. Perles returned immediately to East 
Lansing, Mich., where he was expected to meet today with school officials. 
</P>
<P>
According to Steinberg, Perles had to consult with certain officials before he 
could be released from his contract. Steinberg said the athletic director job 
"has nothing to do with the discussions." 
</P>
<P>
But Perles was noncommittal after his meeting with Steinberg. "(My wife) and I 
have talked about this before," Perles said. "Now I have some things I can 
convey to her. Now it's reality. Mentally, I've got a lot stored up in my 
mind." 
</P>
<P>
Perles was in a similar position two years ago. He had accepted an offer to 
become the Green Bay Packers' head coach, but he backed down at the last minute 
when Michigan State offered a 10-year contract.

LAKERS GET STONGER AS YOUTH FILLS VACUUM LEFT BY ABDUL-JABBAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HUBBARD, NEWSDAY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The farewell tour seems nothing more than a distant memory. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 
is gone and, in an immediate sense, forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
That is not an insult, no matter how it sounds. Last season, the Lakers gave 
him the respect he had earned. He turned 42 in April. He was an old basketball 
player. His statistics and production were at all-time lows. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Lakers talked of his greatness. They talked of how they would miss 
him. When it finally was time for him to leave, his teammates bought a 
Rolls-Royce for him. 
</P>
<P>
But when the Lakers met in Hawaii for training camp, Coach Pat Riley no longer 
looked backward. He no longer had to massage Abdul-Jabbar's ego and hope it 
would pay off in a last-second, game-winning sky hook. Riley made it clear that 
the new-look Lakers were aggressively moving forward. He said they were faster, 
quicker, younger and no longer confined to a half-court offense. 
</P>
<P>
"The anchor," Riley said, dramatically, "has been lifted." 
</P>
<P>
Riley could defend his use of the word "anchor" by noting that Abdul-Jabbar 
steadied the ship. But there also is little doubt that with Abdul-Jabbar in the 
lineup, the running game could bog down and the defense was a step slow. 
</P>
<P>
Whether intended or not, the Lakers' players also indicate they do not miss the 
older Abdul-Jabbar's diminished skills. That is evident when they talk about 
the potential of 21-year-old Yugoslav rookie center Vlade Divac, who was only 1 
when Abdul-Jabbar began his rookie year. 
</P>
<P>
"We've changed," Magic Johnson said, "because the addition of Vlade makes us a 
little bit better." 
</P>
<P>
Better? In the first 37 games of the season, Divac has averaged fewer than 19 
minutes a game. 
</P>
<P>
But after 37 games, the record indicates the Lakers are better. At 28-9, they 
not only have the best record in the league, but they are three games better 
than their 25-12 record at the same point last season. 
</P>
<P>
They also have achieved something they did not last season. On Sunday, they 
beat the Pistons, 107-97. That broke a seven-game losing streak against the 
Pistons -- including two regular-season games last season, four games in the 
National Basketball Assn. finals and the first meeting this season. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you lose a great center, you lose a great dimension," Riley said. 
"But we're a better team this season." 
</P>
<P>
When describing their improvement, the operative word among the Lakers, who 
will be at Madison Square Garden to play the New York Knicks tonight, is 
defense. For years, they have been an underrated defensive team, primarily 
because their defense was sporadic. They were capable of impressive defensive 
displays, but not over an extended period. 
</P>
<P>
This season, however, they have given up an average of 101.0 points a game, 
ranking third in the league. In the last three seasons, the Lakers never 
allowed less than an average of 107 points a game, and they have ranked eighth, 
11th and 12th in defense. 
</P>
<P>
Riley credits much of the improvement to Mychal Thompson, who replaced 
Abdul-Jabbar in the starting lineup. "Mychal Thompson is one of the best 
low-post defenders in the league," Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
"Their defense is tougher," said Phoenix Suns Coach Cotton Fitzsimmons, whose 
team lost in the Western finals to the Lakers last season. "I personally think 
the Lakers are better now, not because Kareem is gone, but because they're more 
versatile. A lot of times, you used to set picks with Kareem's man, and Kareem 
couldn't come outside and cover. Now they jump out and cover. Thompson and 
Divac both will get out there." 
</P>
<P>
Offensively, the Lakers no longer have the sky hook to rescue them when a play 
breaks down and the shot clock is running out. But they still have Magic 
Johnson and James Worthy, and that seems to be more than enough. Johnson leads 
the Lakers in scoring with a 21.7 average and is second in the league with 11.6 
assists a game. Worthy averages 21.4 points and had 31 to lead the Lakers in 
their victory over the Pistons on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers have been so efficient as a team that they have been able to 
withstand an off year by shooting guard Byron Scott, who has not fully 
recovered from the hamstring injury that kept him out of the finals last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Scott said the injury has healed, but he has not fully regained his strength. 
Last year, he could curl 70 pounds with his left leg; this year, he can curl 
only 30 pounds. That obviously has affected his jumping ability and his jump 
shot. Scott, a 50.8% career field-goal shooter, has made a career-low 44.1% of 
his shots and is averaging 15.4 points, his lowest average since the 1985-86 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Scott's struggles, however, have not slowed the Lakers. And they seem to be 
invigorated by the presence of Divac, the 7-foot-1, 245-pound center who has 
averaged 8.8 points and is the fourth-leading rebounder on the team with 6.3 a 
game. He also leads the Lakers with 45 blocked shots and should surpass 
Abdul-Jabbar's total of 85 last season. 
</P>
<P>
"Vlade has grown leaps and bounds and has given us excellent play at center," 
Riley said. "He really has surpassed expectations for us. It's a real gift." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers got lucky because of the language barrier. Divac's inability to 
speak English scared many teams, which is why he lasted until the 26th pick of 
the first round. Before the draft, scouts said Divac was as good a talent as 
Pervis Ellison, the No. 1 pick. 
</P>
<P>
Divac has had his moments. On Jan. 15, he had 25 points in 28 minutes against 
the Sacramento Kings. But he also has had his rookie moments. He was so 
overmatched against the Pistons' James Edwards and the game Sunday was so 
intense that Divac played only six minutes. And now he gets to meet the Knicks' 
Patrick Ewing. 
</P>
<P>
"In two or three years, if he works on his strength and defense, he will be a 
force in this league," Scott said. "He'll find out against Patrick. He's going 
to have to be very physical, even though he's not a very physical player. He's 
going to have to learn to use his lower body a lot and try to move Patrick out, 
and then hope and pray that Patrick misses a lot of shots." 
</P>
<P>
That makes Divac no different from any other center in the league. And if 
Abdul-Jabbar were in the middle, the Lakers still would need to hope he 
wouldn't be too much of a defensive liability. But he's gone. And the Lakers 
are moving forward nicely.

RIDDER STABLE TO GO AFTER CONSECUTIVE TITLES ON WED.

Ridder Thoroughbred Stable will be going after consecutive titles in the 
California Breeders' Champion Stakes when San Miguel Stakes winner Tarascon 
carries his owner's colors in the $125,000-added race Wednesday at Santa Anita 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
Ridder's Past Ages captured the seven-furlong event for 3-year-old California 
foals last year. Like Past Ages, Tarascon is a homebred son of top California 
sire Flying Paster, who won this race in 1978 for the late B. J. Ridder. 
</P>
<P>
In the San Miguel, Tarascon was 2 1/2 lengths the best, while Wednesday rivals 
Express It and Shantin O. had to be separated by a photo for the place. In his 
only loss since finishing fourth in his career debut in October, Tarascon was a 
creditable third in the Grade III Hollywood Prevue behind highly regarded 
Individualist and Top Cash. 
</P>
<P>
With a dozen starters, the California Breeders' Champion Stakes will be worth 
$141,900 and the winner will bank $85,650. 
</P>
<P>
In post position order, the field includes Shantin O., Russell Baze riding at 
119 pounds; Makaleha, Tom Chapman, 114; Due to the King, Laffit Pincay, Jr., 
114; Hawaiian Pass, Sandy Hawley, 114; Wild Too, Robbie Davis, 114; Tarascon, 
Chris McCarron, 119; Express It, Gary Stevens, 114; Iam the Iceman, David 
Flores, 117; French Seventyfive, Rafael Meza, 122; Solar Launch, Gary 
Boulanger, 114; Shapiro's Hero, Alex Solis, 114; and Kleven Up, Corey Nakatani, 
114. 
</P>
<P>
Before their photo-finish battle for second in the San Miguel, Shantin O. and 
Express It ran first and third, respectively, in the Atherton Stakes at Bay 
Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
Due to the King hasn't found the winner's circle since his debut at Del Mar in 
August but he tested some of the best youngsters around in the Grade I Norfolk 
here in October, running third to division leader Grand Canyon and Single Dawn. 
</P>
<P>
Iam the Iceman missed by a head in his first start in late November, but is 
two-for-two since then. He broke his maiden here on opening day of the meeting 
and came back to win an allowance test 10 days ago.

JOCKEY FINED $1,000; HE LOST TRACK OF HIS RACE

Jockey Jorge Chavez, who says he became confused during a race in which he gave 
up a commanding lead, was fined $1,000 by New York Racing and Wagering Board 
steward John Joyce for misjudging the distance of a race at Aqueduct. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez was riding Westelm Stables' High Policy in sixth race Sunday, a $50,000, 
2 1/4-mile race for 4-year olds and up on the inner track. 
</P>
<P>
The race started at the head of the stretch and required horses to make more 
than two circuits of the track, crossing the finish line three times. After 
making one trip around the oval, Chavez began whipping his mount and opened a 
lead of some 10 to 12 lengths approaching the finish line for the second time. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently under the impression he had won easily, Chavez pulled his mount up 
at the wire, while the rest of the field quickly caught up with High Policy. It 
was only after surrendering his advantage that Chavez became aware of his 
mistake and resumed riding High Policy the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
High Policy finished second, beaten four lengths by the favorite, Dual 
Elements. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just confused. I thought it was over. I am very sorry. I've never in my 
life done something like this. I'm very upset," Chavez said afterward. 
</P>
<P>
It was not the first time that a New York rider erred so embarrassingly. 
</P>
<P>
Jorge Velasquez made a virtually identical mistake during the running of the 2 
1/4-mile Display Handicap on the same track in 1985. Velasquez was also fined 
$1,000 for his mistake.
