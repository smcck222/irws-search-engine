FAMILY DINNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As President Reagan neared the end of his farewell address he offered today's 
youth ". . . lesson No. 1 about America. All great change in America begins at 
the dinner table. So tomorrow night in the kitchen I hope the talking begins. 
And children, if your parents haven't been teaching you what it means to be an 
American, let them know. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
As I listened to this instruction, the thought occurred to me that the 
President was not in tune with the American family today. His view of the 
entire family gathering night at the dinner table is more consistent with the 
Ozzie and Harriet era than the day of microwaves and fast food. I thought that 
it would be interesting to inquire into family dinner practices by asking my 
high school American history students. I teach 16 and 17 year olds in the 
middle-class community of West Covina. 
</P>
<P>
The day after the address I asked the 121 students who came to class to tell me 
if they ate dinner with their parents on a regular basis. Even I was surprised 
when only 33 indicated that they ate as a family. If you eliminate the 11 who 
ate in a family environment from my 22 advanced placement students, the figures 
are even more striking. Of the 99 students present in my four average classes, 
only 22 indicated a regular family dinner experience. 
</P>
<P>
I agree with Reagan's belief that "we've got to teach history based not on 
what's in fashion but what's important." If we forget what we did we won't know 
who we are." But if the President believes that the evening meal will provide 
the setting for the transfer of the "American memory" to today's youth he is 
sadly mistaken. That important responsibility appears to be left to the public 
school teachers of American history.

REAGAN LEGACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to Robert J. Samuelson's "Reagan's Legacy Needs No Slogan" (Op-Ed 
Page, Jan. 11), I wish to suggest that he is wrong and that a very appropriate 
slogan would be "Borrow and borrow, spend and spend." Given his statement that 
the debt "nearly tripled since 1980 to more than $2.6 trillion" it seems fair 
to ascribe about $1.7 trillion to the Reagan Administration. 
</P>
<P>
If one divides $1.7 trillion by 250 million, the present U.S. population, the 
per capita increase in debt is $6,800 during the Reagan Administration. For a 
family of four, this is $27,200 in the last eight years. I hope all of the 
people who voted for Reagan feel that they have obtained their family's share 
of this debt increase in either tax reductions or additional benefits. 
</P>
<P>
I believe that there would be a certain poetic justice if Reagan were to be 
remembered as "Big Red," the champion of deficit spending and debt increase.

'OUR HEALTH CARE IS SICK' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Where can I sign up for that national health program? I am one of those 22% of 
all Californians who have no medical insurance. I would certainly like to have 
insurance, but I cannot find anybody who will sell me any at a reasonable 
price. 
</P>
<P>
Last year I decided to become self-employed -- the American dream. I am 
responsible to myself. I love it. I earned more as a salaried worker, but the 
satisfaction I derive from my independence more than makes up for the loss in 
income. But the health insurance companies are not interested in me, not at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
I have been willing to pay my own doctor out of my pocket when he treats me for 
strep throat or a cut foot, but I am concerned with the (I hope) remote 
possibility of a serious accident or illness. Nobody wants to sell me insurance 
that would cover such a catastrophe, except for an absurdly high premium of 
upwards of $1,000 a month. So I'm stuck. And the state will be stuck for the 
bill if I (God forbid) do require lengthy hospitalization, because I will have 
to file for bankruptcy. That notion does not appeal to me at all. 
</P>
<P>
Instead I would love to take part in a national health program, wherein I could 
pay a fair share of my earnings in return for good health care. All I ask for 
is the opportunity to participate in a health insurance program; at the moment 
there is none which will have me.

THE BIG RAID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Call it what he will, Gov. George Deukmejian's proposed use of proceeds from 
the increased tobacco tax, voted in November, violates the language and the 
intent of Proposition 99 and constitutes a formula for wreaking more damage on 
health care in the state. 
</P>
<P>
We do not minimize the budget problem that the governor faces in the wake of 
the passage of Proposition 98, which earmarked specified funding for public 
education. We are aware of his dogged resistance to adequate taxation, and his 
determination to restore a $1-billion budget reserve. 
</P>
<P>
But nothing can justify taking the cigarette-tax money, passed with a 
remarkable 58% yes vote, and diverting it to the precise use forbidden in the 
initiative. It was to prevent just such a raid that the initiative specified 
that the increased tobacco-tax revenue was to "supplement existing levels of 
service and not to fund existing levels of service." 
</P>
<P>
The governor's staff insists that he is respecting the law. But no court of law 
could possibly uphold his budget plan as conforming to the wish of the voters. 
He proposes cutting $358 million from funding for the medically indigent in 
major counties, a general-fund obligation assumed by the state when it dumped 
the program onto counties. Then, to create the illusion of conforming with 
Proposition 99, he proposes creating a new operation, the California Health 
Care for Indigents Program (CHIP), with $331 million taken from four separate 
accounts of the tobacco-tax initiative. He insists that this is not funding an 
existing service because CHIP is "new." Nor is that the only raid on 
tobacco-tax money. 
</P>
<P>
If the governor has his way, at least 70% of the proceeds of the tax initiative 
would be used to replace general-fund revenue. To make matters worse, his plan 
would reduce funding for the indigent-care program despite incontrovertible 
evidence that the program already is desperately underfunded. That underfunding 
is a major factor in the decline of emergency services, particularly in Los 
Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Los Angeles County would face what can only be described as a 
public-health disaster. The basic budget of the county Department of Health 
Services is based on tobacco-tax revenue. Even with the promised Proposition 99 
funding, the county's emergency services would continue to unravel unless 
additional state funding was provided. The downtown emergency rooms, kept open 
with special supplementary hospital allocations through calendar 1988, are now 
without any special funding. At least one more emergency room will close in the 
immediate future, making even worse the pervasive overloading. As matters rest, 
the caseload is so high in the remaining emergency and trauma centers that as 
many as seven may be at saturation levels at any given moment -- meaning that 
they must temporarily refuse additional patients. 
</P>
<P>
Given this crisis and the budget pressures created by the education initiative, 
Proposition 98, the governor owes the people of this state candor -- not 
deceptive bookkeeping. If there is not money enough to meet the basic needs, he 
must say so. In no case, however, can the budget pressures justify a raid on 
funds voted and earmarked by the people of the state to address the 
deterioration of public-health services. 
</P>
<P>
This dispute must not be allowed to divert state officials from the more 
important challenge of working out an equitable distribution of the more than 
$600 million that Proposition 99 is expected to generate each year. This is not 
a pie for the health-care sponsors of that successful proposition to carve up 
for the benefit of each and every health-care provider. It must be used to 
address the priorities for which it was intended, to supplement and not to 
replace the existing resources. To do otherwise would betray the trust of the 
voters and violate the rule of law.

AMERICA SHINES AS APOSTLE OF WORLD ECONOMIC GROWTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN H. MAKIN, John H. Makin, the director of fiscal-policy studies at the 
American Enterprise Institute in Washington, was recently a visiting scholar at 
the Bank of JapanJapan's central bank. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of Washington's favorite 1988 themes was "burden sharing." The idea will 
probably stay around in 1989. Its adherents argue that our rich allies in 
Europe and Japan should pay a bigger share of the Western world's defense 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
The American complaint is that Japan and others have been "free-riding" under 
the U.S. defense umbrella. Worse still, the complaint goes, America's budget 
and trade deficits have resulted from this free ride. Heavy defense spending 
has swollen our budget deficit while, freed of the defense burden, Japan and 
Europe have been able to compete better with American companies, thereby 
contributing to our trade deficit. 
</P>
<P>
There is some truth to parts of the burden-sharing argument, though some of the 
conclusions drawn from it are faulty. The 1981-88 surge in defense spending 
added about $300 billion to budget deficits and, along with rapid growth of 
spending on Social Security and other government retirement programs, pushed up 
interest rates. The higher interest rates pulled in foreign investment that, 
until 1985, made the dollar much stronger. The stronger dollar made it more 
difficult for American companies to compete in world markets. 
</P>
<P>
The stronger dollar and its harmful effect on American competitiveness was one 
of the major unanticipated negative effects of large budget deficits. The 
budget and trade deficits have come down, and the rate of dollar-buying by 
foreigners has slowed. 
</P>
<P>
Despite lower budget and trade deficits, their persistence entails some 
dangers.The biggest risk is that the global preoccupation with the twin 
deficits and the defensive U.S. demand for more "burden sharing" will mask the 
recognition of some immensely important long-term achievements by America and 
its allies. 
</P>
<P>
Since World War II the United States has spent hundreds of billions of dollars 
on direct and indirect aid worldwide. The primary aim was to contain the spread 
of communism. The Marshall Plan, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, 
foreign-aid programs and -- until 1971 -- easy access to U.S. markets on 
preferential terms all contributed to strengthening the economies of Europe and 
Asia. 
</P>
<P>
Now we see ourselves as victims of our own success. The economies that we 
helped grew so much stronger, especially in Asia, that their exports to us now 
exceed our exports to them by more than $100 billion a year. And some, 
especially Japan, are turning around and investing in America with purchases of 
Treasury securities, land and buildings. 
</P>
<P>
American ambivalence about the economic success of our allies has resulted ina 
protectionist trade bill and overblown scare talk about foreigners "buying into 
America." Foreigners own about 10% of U.S. assets while America owns about the 
same share of foreign assets. Japan's share of U.S. assets is about 2% -- well 
behind the shares of the British and the Dutch. 
</P>
<P>
Economic success on a level that included some investments in America 
apparently was not what Americans envisioned for our allies when we embarked on 
generous postwar aid programs. Feelings of altruism and generosity toward our 
allies have given way to charges of free-riding and downright ingratitude. 
</P>
<P>
The start of the new year is a good time to reflect on some questions about our 
long-run achievements and goals for the world economy. Did we really think that 
America's unprecedented economic and military strength right after World War II 
would last forever? Our aid strategy suggested that we did not want it to last, 
and, if that was true, our allies had to grow faster than we were growing in 
order to close the gap. Did we expect to decide unilaterally how far the gap 
could close? Would we not prefer that the strategy of encouraging economic 
growth worldwide succeeded? Is it so bad, in the richest country in the world, 
to be getting rich a little more slowly than others? (Yes, America is still 
richer than Japan. Doubters should live in Japan for a while.) 
</P>
<P>
The other immense policy success that America should be celebrating in 1989 is 
the return on the much-maligned Reagan defense build-up. An extra defense 
outlay of $300 billion appears to have persuaded the Soviets to forgo, at least 
for now, another round of the arms race. If 1987's intermediate-nuclear-force 
missile reductions in Europe and 1988's Soviet troop reductions signal a 
cooling of the arms race that allows us to cut defense spending by just 2% of 
our gross national product for a decade, we'll save about $1 trillion in 1989 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
The most significant event of 1988 in the world's major capitals -- Washington, 
Moscow and Tokyo -- was the collective realization that economic strength has 
become more important than military strength. It follows from this realization 
that, for both America and the Soviet Union, the economic challenge from Japan 
is more significant than the U.S.-Soviet military contest of the last several 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that U.S. policies over the past 45 years have had a great deal to do 
with establishing the primacy of economic over military power should be a 
source of great satisfaction even though it presents us with a new set of 
challenges. The policy has been good for our allies, and ultimately it will be 
good for us. It has been a major disaster for the Soviet Union, a prime example 
of "imperial overreach," impoverished by excessive military spending. 
Fortunately, for the Soviet Union and the world, Mikhail S. Gorbachev appears 
to have recognized the grotesque error of trying to run an economy without 
incentives for efficient production while draining away a huge share of 
resources for military use. The leftovers have supported only a third-class 
living standard for Soviet citizens. 
</P>
<P>
If our friends are successful and our enemies unsuccessful in a new world of 
economic primacy, what is there in it for us? Plenty. Facing an economic 
challenge is invigorating, especially when you have at hand America's great 
human and natural resources. The competition is tough. We'll win some and lose 
some. But economic competition surely beats military competition or, worse, a 
war. Then everybody loses. That was the expensive lesson of World War I. 
Forgetting it resulted in an even more expensive lesson barely a generation 
later. 
</P>
<P>
American leadership for more than two generations since World War II has been 
aimed at encouraging worldwide economic growth and competition, a positive-sum 
game. The signs of success all around us should be reminder enough that this is 
no time to give up.

MILITARY NOW TARGETS CIVILIANS LIVING IN THE WAR ZONE

We had just finished breakfast when we noticed the red smoke. It was pouring 
out of the low underbrush on a hill north of Guarjila, a repopulated community 
in El Salvador. In October, 1987, 1,200 Salvadorans came from the Mesa Grande 
refugee camp to settle in this fertile area north of Chalatenango. Their return 
was part of a national popular movement, unaligned with the government, to 
resettle refugees in the lands that they inhabited before being driven out by 
El Salvador's long civil war. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier that morning there had been an exchange of gunfire between about two 
dozen Salvadoran soldiers and what appeared to be three to five young men from 
the opposition force, the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN). The 
volley had broken the silence of the morning, but it did not last long. The 
sporadic shots of the FMLN muchachos perched on the hill were quickly subdued 
by the army unit crouched on the fringe of the farming community. Our 
post-breakfast sighting of the red smoke told that a "chopper" was coming in to 
retrieve a soldier downed by an FMLN marksman. 
</P>
<P>
As priests on a pastoral visit, we had been told of the accelerating dangers to 
the people living in Guarjila. For them the war is never far away. That morning 
we stood alongside the church workers assigned to this repopulation site and 
watched the helicopter close in to pick up its wounded. With the Guarjila 
settlers, we, too, had been transfixed by the battle on the nearby hill, and we 
hoped that it would keep its distance. We hoped that it wouldn't touch the men 
already at work in the fields, and the women and children tending the chores of 
their homes and the communal tasks of the village. 
</P>
<P>
As we watched, the same three to five muchachos struggled for a better angle to 
fire at the helicopter. It circled the army position, then leaned into the hill 
with a spray of bullets. Soon it was joined by another -- this one equipped 
with rockets. We watched as the first helicopter airlifted the wounded soldier. 
The second helicopter swooped low over the village with a rage and a reckless 
disregard for the civilians below. It wheeled and drew closer, and then opened 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
We dove into the church workers' mudthatched shack, seeking cover under useless 
protection -- cots and benches -- and huddled together as the bullets flew 
within the confines of the village. Rockets shot from the belly of the chopper, 
presumably meant for the fighters in the mountains, while bullets pierced the 
tin roofs of the peoples' simple homes. The children cried, the women sought to 
console their young, and the men hurried in from the fields even as the 
relentless shooting continued. 
</P>
<P>
"They're shooting at us," we said to one another as, in disbelief, we 
acknowledged that indeed the civilian population had become the objects of the 
helicopter's fury. 
</P>
<P>
After an hour the helicopter flew off, leaving the village with hundreds of 
spent shells as an ominous sign of things to come. 
</P>
<P>
The people speak constantly of death these days. Miraculously, in that 
confrontation no one was hurt. One old woman insisted, "God doesn't want that 
for us now." The people of Guarjila, like those in the nine other repopulated 
communities, prepare themselves for the massacre to come. They have been told 
as much by soldiers who warn that soon there will be nothing left of their 
beloved Guarjila. 
</P>
<P>
The army maintains that the notable absence of young men in these settlements 
is due in large part to their involvement with FMLN forces in the neighborhood. 
That has left the villagers of Guarjila, decidedly noncombatant civilians, 
vulnerable to attack as if they, too, were armed for battle. As they spoke of 
their fears to us, they pleaded for international attention -- hoping to be 
spared, hoping to have their noncombatant status respected. 
</P>
<P>
The people have known massacres before. Rape, torture and displacement are no 
strangers to them. However, this moment in their history of struggle and pain 
is different. This time, unlike all the times before, they have decided not to 
move. So convinced are they of their human right to live in this community -- 
to till its soil and see their children grow here -- that not even death 
compels them to abandon the work of these many months. 
</P>
<P>
The Salvadoran military sees these men, women and children as terrorists. 
Repopulated communities, explains a Salvadoran colonel, are the sea and the 
FMLN are the fish, "and in order to rid ourselves of the fish we must rid 
ourselves of the sea." 
</P>
<P>
Guarjila's sympathies in this war, in a country where neutrality is considered 
impossible, has in the eyes of the military placed the villagers in the same 
category as combatants. It is precisely because the military places no value on 
their integrity as civilians that their fear is real. Accustomed as they are to 
death, they would not be so certain of their imminent demise were it not so 
likely to happen. 
</P>
<P>
As we prepared to leave Guarjila after having assessed the damage of the attack 
from house to house, we embraced the members of the village directorate, aware 
that this might be our last meeting. As we said our goodby, we felt shame in 
recognizing that the terrorizing of these people and, we fear, their 
annihilation would be financed by our own government. 
</P>
<P>
In the spring of 1984, then-Vice President George Bush spoke before a gathering 
of dignitaries in San Salvador. But first he apologized to his hosts for the 
bluntness of what he was about to say. He blurted out that the death squads 
must end. Given our more than $3 billion in military aid, which the Salvadoran 
government depends on, his admonition did not fall on deaf ears. For a time the 
death squads' activities stopped. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as President Bush sets the agenda for his Administration, those of us who 
witnessed the immoral disregard for the lives of civilians in Guarjila dare to 
hope that he will have a different Central American policy. Our hope is for a 
policy that will not tolerate, and certainly will not finance, a regime that 
countenances the barbarism of death squads and the wholesale massacre of 
unarmed civilian populations. 
</P>
<P>
The President would get his foreign policy off to an honest and moral beginning 
by denouncing the tactics employed in Guarjila. And, as Salvadoran elections 
draw near, he must condemn as abhorrent a government that would make its policy 
this ultimate violation of human rights.

Amoco Corp.'s 1988 earnings jumped 52% to $2.063 billion. Revenue climbed to 
$23.9 billion, up 6%. Fourth-quarter profit eased to $375 million from $377 
million, while revenue advanced to $6.2 billion from $5.9 billion. The 
Chicago-based oil, chemicals and plastics company said strong fourth-quarter 
gains in chemicals and refining operations were offset by lower earnings from 
explorations and productions, due to lower worldwide energy prices.

Data General Corp. posted a $19.5-million loss in its first-quarter, contrasted 
with a profit of $13.8 million a year ago. Revenue fell 9% to $309 million. The 
Westboro, Mass.-based minicomputer maker attributed the loss in part to an 
interruption in sales from a transition to a new line of computers.

JACK SMITH: KITTEN-CAT: WE ONLY SCRATCHED THE SURFACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Another entry is heard from in the kitten-cat verse question. Who was first? 
Ogden Nash ("The trouble with a kitten is THAT/Eventually it becomes a CAT") or 
Richard Armour ("One dreadful truth I rather wish /I did not know is that/The 
woman who is kittenish/May one day be a cat"). 
</P>
<P>
Now Ruth Merriam Spaeth comes forward with one by Carl Van Doren, which she 
thinks antedates both: 
</P>
<P>
 Gather ye kittens while you may, 
</P>
<P>
For time brings only sorrow. 
</P>
<P>
And the kittens of today 
</P>
<P>
Will be old cats tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
"Probably Van Doren was before your time (1885-1950)" she says. "Not mine. I'm 
93 now." 
</P>
<P>
I suspect that the observation is as old as cats and man. 
</P>
<P>
By the way, Blanche Campbell says she always thought that Richard Armour's 
verse "Going to Extremes" ("Shake and shake/The catsup bottle/None will 
come/And then a lot'll") actually read "none'll come" instead of "none will." 
</P>
<P>
Armour tells me that "none will" is correct, explaining that "none'll" would 
have weakened the surprise of "a lot'll" in the last line. 
</P>
<P>
The writing of light verse is a passing affliction. Few master it as Nash, 
Armour and Dorothy Parker did. 
</P>
<P>
Merle Wollman offers her first effort in a poetry class: 
</P>
<P>
 The sun goes down, 
</P>
<P>
The tide drifts in. 
</P>
<P>
Now I can start 
</P>
<P>
My glass of gin. 
</P>
<P>
Light verse is often employed in amorous pursuits. Screenwriter Melville 
Shavelson confesses that he courted his wife with this one: 
</P>
<P>
 Of course we should do what is proper 
</P>
<P>
to do/And act as we're told we must; 
</P>
<P>
And the world will say we are wise, 
</P>
<P>
and true,/And the world will 
</P>
<P>
say we are just. 
</P>
<P>
But couldn't we wait for another year 
</P>
<P>
To prove to the world our worth? 
</P>
<P>
Oh, think of the terrible taxes, dear, 
</P>
<P>
If we should inherit the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
Shavelson notes: "The lady continued to resist, but she did have a sense of 
humor. She married me." 
</P>
<P>
Shavelson also recalls a verse he wrote "in the Middle Ages" as a humor 
columnist for the Cornell Daily Sun: 
</P>
<P>
 Men seldom make passes 
</P>
<P>
At girls who wear glasses 
</P>
<P>
So Dorothy Parker has writ. 
</P>
<P>
But they pass at the lasses 
</P>
<P>
Who empty their glasses, 
</P>
<P>
Eh, Dorothy -- isn't that it? 
</P>
<P>
Joe Ansen contributes a verse he wrote for a dinner in honor of Leon Kaplan, 
Hollywood entertainment lawyer, last month: 
</P>
<P>
 We are here to pay tribute to Lee, 
</P>
<P>
But my brief will be brief as can be, 
</P>
<P>
A Lawyer like Leon 
</P>
<P>
Comes one to an eon, 
</P>
<P>
He's as rare as a reasonable fee. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Pettit of Laguna Beach, who says he has little time for correspondence 
because the 1989 bikini season is open, recalls a verse by another of my 
favorites, Samuel Hoffenstein: 
</P>
<P>
 You have a most attractive pan 
</P>
<P>
And I'm a very foolish man 
</P>
<P>
And in between the two I fell 
</P>
<P>
As deep as Dante into hell. 
</P>
<P>
My favorite Hoffenstein is this one: 
</P>
<P>
The ocean spills upon the sands 
</P>
<P>
Water with a thousand hands 
</P>
<P>
And when the ocean all is spilled 
</P>
<P>
The sand is dry, the ocean filled. 
</P>
<P>
I discovered Hoffenstein in my teens and bought his book, "Poems in Praise of 
Practically Nothing." Their nature can be guessed from some of his chapter 
titles: "Songs to Break the Tedium of Riding a Bicycle, Seeing One's Friends, 
or Heartbreak"; "Poems of Passion Carefully Restrained So as to Offend Nobody"; 
"Poems Intended to Incite the Utmost Depression"; "Poems of Fairly Utter 
Despair." 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago I found a copy of the 1928 first edition (autographed to Mrs. 
Ann Baum) at Smith's Acre of Books in Long Beach. It still had the jacket, in 
almost mint condition, with a blurb by Dorothy Parker: "Were I to be cast alone 
on a desert island (this) would be the book I should wish to have along with 
me!" H. L. Mencken said: "Incomparable." 
</P>
<P>
What happened to light verse? Here's a clue from Ogden Nash: 
</P>
<P>
 I'd rather flunk my Wasserman test 
</P>
<P>
Than read the poems of Edgar Guest.

A SURVIVOR'S ACCOUNT OF BRAIN SURGERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE DEMBART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Bomb in the Brain: A Heroic Tale of Science, Surgery and Survival by Steve 
Fishman (Scribners: $19.95; 318 pages) 
</P>
<P>
Illness is a universal human experience, with a vast literature of fiction and 
nonfiction from doctors and patients alike. "A Bomb in the Brain" by Steve 
Fishman is a stunning contribution to the genre, which should take its place 
alongside the best of them. 
</P>
<P>
It is the first-person story of a young man's brain hemorrhage and all that 
follows -- diagnosis, successful surgery and, ultimately, epilepsy -- told with 
searing and heart-rending honesty and insight. It is full of texture and layers 
and conveys a great deal of information to boot. No book in a long time has had 
such an emotional impact on me. 
</P>
<P>
The story begins in Nicaragua, where Fishman, a 28-year-old journalist from New 
York, suddenly suffers a searing headache and loss of vision while standing in 
a hotel lobby. For two weeks no one correctly diagnoses the life-threatening 
nature of the problem. Not till he gets back to New York and has a CT scan does 
Fishman discover that a blood vessel broke in his brain and that many people 
die on the spot when that happens. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 From Groin to Brain 
</P>
<P>
After that, he undergoes an angiogram, in which a tube is threaded through his 
body from his groin to his brain so doctors can determine what caused the 
hemorrhage. 
</P>
<P>
It turns out to be an arteriovenous malformation, a patch of malformed blood 
vessels in the brain, which could explode again at any time. Surgery is 
recommended to remove the malformation and prevent a recurrence. Fishman 
agrees. 
</P>
<P>
At each stage of the diagnosis and treatment, Fishman stops and steps back, 
explaining the diagnostic and surgical procedures, including anesthesia. He 
provides fascinating histories of these medical miracles and the pioneering 
doctors who brought them about. 
</P>
<P>
Until fairly recently, brain surgery was considered a hopeless enterprise. 
One-third of all patients died of the treatment, and many others suffered 
debilitating effects. Few were cured. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 Not Quite a Piece of Cake 
</P>
<P>
Yet medicine persevered, burying many patients along the way (most of whom 
would have died of their ailment if they hadn't been killed on the operating 
table). Now, if brain surgery is not quite a piece of cake, it is regularly 
performed with a high degree of safety and success. 
</P>
<P>
After his own surgery, Fishman persuaded his doctors to let him observe other 
similar operations, which he writes about with exceptional clarity and control. 
</P>
<P>
All of this sounds pretty straight-forward and not much to get excited about if 
you're not interested in the history of medicine and the latest surgical 
techniques. 
</P>
<P>
But there is much more to this book. Seamlessly interwoven through the story 
are a welter of feelings, not only of the patient, but of his family, his 
girlfriend, his doctors, his nurses -- even the social worker who visits him 
the night before his surgery. Fishman skillfully shifts his point of view among 
all of the actors. 
</P>
<P>
While giving the details, he never loses sight of the whole. Shortly after 
checking into the hospital, he writes: "Sickness isn't only estrangement and 
pain. At its core is an invitation to respite. I experience this aspect of my 
condition as the most seductive pleasure. I had trudged around with that pain 
in my head for how long? It might have been my whole life. Then a doctor said, 
'You're sick,' and it was for me, as if the whole imploring world, pacing at my 
door, had been told to cool its heels. I feel unburdened." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 Opened His Head to Save a Life 
</P>
<P>
He adores his doctors, idolizes them, a not-uncommon experience. They have 
opened his head and saved his life. 
</P>
<P>
And then, a year after the surgery, he begins to have epileptic seizures. 
Whether they are caused by damage done by the original hemorrhage or by the 
surgeon's scalpel no one knows. But he will have them forever. He has traded 
the possibility of another brain hemorrhage and sudden death for the certainty 
that several times a year his brain will misfire and he will have a seizure. 
</P>
<P>
His four-year love affair collapses under the strain. Life is irreparably 
different. 
</P>
<P>
Fishman's attitude toward the doctors and surgeons who treated him so 
skillfully changes. "Medicine could not return me to a presick state, nor could 
I," he writes. "The surgeons learned to accept failure by putting it behind 
them; I had to learn to live with it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 A Long Way From Nicaragua 
</P>
<P>
"I have come a long way from the hotel lobby in Nicarague where nearly a half 
cup of blood jetted into my brain and almost killed me. I have been introduced 
to medicine's most sophisticated diagnostic machines, benefited from its finest 
therapeutic skills. I had signed on as a booster of high-powered medicine, the 
medicine that saved my life. In the end I got epilepsy, a weird ailment with an 
incomplete treatment, and needed other help. Having been marked cured, I was 
left to cope, which changed how I viewed the cure." 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't blame the doctors. They did their best, which was very good indeed. 
But they did not -- could not -- do much for his anguish. 
</P>
<P>
Fishman was lucky to survive the hemorrhage. We are lucky he was so lucky.

ART BUCHWALD: THE CHANGING PICTURE(S) OF WASHINGTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Art Buchwald 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What kind of big changes are going on in Washington now that we have a new 
President? 
</P>
<P>
If there are any at all, they are taking place among the lawyers and lobbyists 
who make their living persuading our elected officials that what's good for 
their clients is good for the country. 
</P>
<P>
I dropped in to see the lawyer-lobbyist, Norton Nesbitt, the day after the 
inauguration. He was removing all the photographs of Reagan appointees and 
replacing them with autographed pictures of Bush people. 
</P>
<P>
"Redecorating the office?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Just changing the decor a little," he replied. "You get tired looking at the 
same faces all the time." 
</P>
<P>
"You're not throwing an autographed picture of Ed Meese in the trash can, are 
you?" 
</P>
<P>
"What kind of a friend do you think I am? I'm taking it home and putting in the 
bathroom. Ed was good to me. He always took my calls." 
</P>
<P>
pichar 
</P>
<P>
"I can understand your taking Ed Meese off the wall, but how can you discard a 
picture of you and Cap Weinberger, particularly when he signed it 'To Ted, with 
admiration'?" 
</P>
<P>
"I need that space for a golf photo of me and Secretary of State Jim Baker." 
</P>
<P>
"Can I see it?" 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have it yet, but I'll get one at the next Republican fund-raiser." 
</P>
<P>
"I notice that you have a big gap where you used to have an autographed photo 
of Ronald Reagan." 
</P>
<P>
"Yeh, I decided to take Ronnie down and put him in the storeroom so that no one 
will steal him." 
</P>
<P>
"Who are you planning to put in his spot?" 
</P>
<P>
"I'm waiting for a picture of the big guy." 
</P>
<P>
"You mean President Bush?" 
</P>
<P>
Nesbitt said, "I could kill myself. I had thousands of opportunities to have my 
picture taken with him when he was vice president. I remember one time I was at 
the New Jersey State Fair for the crowning of Miss Bergen County, and George 
wanted to get a photo with me. I turned him down and went off to get myself a 
beer." 
</P>
<P>
"You really blew it." 
</P>
<P>
"How was I supposed to know he was going to be President? Whoever heard of 
having your picture taken with a vice president of the United States?" 
</P>
<P>
"I just hope for your sake that Bush doesn't remember that you walked away from 
him." 
</P>
<P>
"I doubt it. People were doing it to him all the time. I have someone in the 
White House working on an autographed picture of the Prez right now. They owe 
me for all the money I raised for the party in Michigan." 
</P>
<P>
"Nesbitt, people will think of you as a good lobbyist whether you have a photo 
with the President or not." 
</P>
<P>
"That may be true of those who know me, but what about the potential clients 
who don't? They will only judge me on the basis of whose picture I have hanging 
on the wall. This is a dog-eat-dog business and the reason that they hire you 
is because they think you have access to the top dogs." 
</P>
<P>
"I guess once they're out of power there is no reason to keep in touch with the 
Reagan people any more." 
</P>
<P>
"Some folks may feel that way -- but I don't. Those I dealt with during the 
Reagan years are still my friends -- regardless of what they are doing now." 
</P>
<P>
Nesbitt's secretary came up to him and said, "George Shultz is on the phone." 
</P>
<P>
"Well, for gosh sake, don't tell him I'm here." He turned to me, "The man 
thinks I have nothing to do but chat with him on the phone."

NO SHOCKS IN 'CULTURE SHOCK!' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There was only one culture and absolutely no shock in "Culture Shock!" Sunday 
afternoon at the Japan America Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Extravagantly billed as "a fusion of music and dance idioms from Indo-Hispanic 
and Asian cultures," this was a program that used native instruments to garnish 
lightweight suites resolutely in the European classical tradition. 
</P>
<P>
Though she led a chamber ensemble bristling with exotic winds and percussion, 
composer-conductor Elisabeth Waldo inevitably reduced such "ethnic" elements to 
teasers or dabs of local color in her sweetly melodic evocations of the Spanish 
Conquistadors, Central American Maya, Peruvian Incas, Chinese Silk Route and 
California Indians. 
</P>
<P>
Far from a fusion of idioms, or even multicultural expression, this approach 
represented a throwback to the court entertainments and opera-ballets that 
titillated Europe from the 16th to 18th centuries with stylized suggestions of 
faraway places. Rameau's "Les Indes Galantes" is probably the most famous -- 
and, like Waldo's program on Sunday, the 1736 version included depictions of 
Incas and North American aboriginals. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Waldo relied more than Rameau on folk sonorities but she proved no 
less Eurocentric in style or outlook. Indeed, she celebrated the forced 
Christianization of Mexico as if this bloody process of enslavement had been 
merely a matter of gentle padres winning hearts. Ai, yai yai. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout, Waldo's resourceful orchestrations achieved maximum variety and 
camouflaged the lack of development in any of this music. Her song-lyrics, 
however, were deadly, though their stale ideas and ghastly rhymes did give them 
an archaic, foreign flavor -- as if they'd been translated into English a 
century ago. Paul Morse delivered every cliche solemnly. 
</P>
<P>
Four choreographers contributed diversionary dances to the program -- many of 
them ethnographically dubious and appallingly cutesie-poo. Pei Ming Tang, 
however, brought great charm and surety to the Chinese numbers. LEWIS SEGAL

Sylvester Stallone will star in another "Rocky" sequel for United Artists, but 
there ends Stallone's relationship with the troubled studio that recently was 
put up for sale. On Monday, Stallone announced that he was transferring a 
production deal with his White Eagle Enterprises from UA to Tri-Star, the 
studio that distributes Stallone's "Rambo" films. Three years ago amid much 
fanfare, White Eagle signed a six-year, 10-picture deal with UA, but not a 
single film came out of it. The first planned project, an untitled drama in 
which Stallone stars as a prison convict, will now be produced for Tri-Star 
this spring. Under the new deal, Stallone must star in at least five films but 
is otherwise free to choose his own projects. "That's the beauty of the deal 
for Stallone," said Tri-Star President David Matalon. Carolco, which produces 
the "Rambo" films, gains worldwide TV rights as well as video and foreign 
theatrical rights, to all White Eagle productions. ALEENE MacMINN

Negotiators trying to head off a television actors' strike resumed work Monday 
following a 22-hour weekend session. "They worked very, very hard," said Dick 
Moore, spokesman for the American Federation of Radio and Television Artists. 
"There is obviously a desire on everyone's part to get this thing behind us." 
The talks at CBS headquarters in New York began at 9 a.m. Saturday and 
continued through Sunday morning, Moore said. "There was some progress, but the 
negotiations are not concluded." An agreement between AFTRA and the television 
networks prevents him from providing progress reports on specific issues. Some 
37 different contracts are being hammered out. AFTRA contracts expired Nov. 15, 
but work is continuing under a day-to-day agreement. ALEENE MacMINN

Sunday's close Super Bowl proved super in the preliminary major-city ratings 
for NBC, whose telecast of the game averaged a 42.7 rating and 65% share of the 
audience in 17 cities. In Los Angeles, the Bengals-49er matchup averaged a 42.4 
rating and a 72% share of the audience, according to Nielsen estimates provided 
Monday by NBC. National ratings for the telecast are due today. ALEENE MacMINN

SOLOISTS OFFER NEAT BUT OFTEN UNINSPIRED PROGRAM

In other cities, it's not unusual for the symphony orchestra to present its 
more accomplished players in chamber music concerts. In Los Angeles, even Andre 
Previn, the L.A. Philharmonic's music director, might have keyboard duty at 
such musical offerings. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Symphony, however, has neither music director nor chamber music 
series, and opportunities to hear its soloists depend upon other local 
institutions. Sunday afternoon, symphony principal clarinet David Peck, 
associate principal first violin Karen Dirks, and pianist Edith Orloff played a 
neatly packaged, if only occasionally inspiring, program at San Diego's First 
Presbyterian Church. 
</P>
<P>
For this concert, Dirks exchanged her violin for viola, since there is a small 
but engaging repertory of works for viola, clarinet and piano. This trio's 
reading of Mozart's "Kegelstatt" Trio, K. 498, rippled along with style, 
confidence and admirable balance. If the players' light-hearted sparkle in the 
concluding rondo movement had surfaced earlier in the piece -- or the program, 
for that matter -- it might have been a more memorable concert.

for the 1987 San Luis Obispo Mozart Festival, received a welcome local debut. 
Although the abrasive counterpoint of the opening movement recalled early 
Schoenberg, the idiom of this young British composer was not disturbingly 
derivative. The quiet pools of shimmering sound in the sonata's companion 
movement invoked the mystical serenity of a Mark Rothko canvas. The trio's 
intense concentration and control served the work well. 
</P>
<P>
The program's opening half languished indulgently in the shoals of Romanticism, 
piling Robert Schumann's four "Fairy Tales," Op. 132, on top of three equally 
short, saccharine sketches by Max Bruch. It is precisely this sort of 
claustrophobic salon treacle that caused Gertrude Stein to snarl, "Kill the 
19th Century dead!" The level of performance was anything but casual, although 
Orloff tended to overpower her colleagues in the Schumann, but in the end it 
amounted to a great deal of fussing over modest musical material. 
</P>
<P>
The program was sponsored by the San Diego Musical Merit Foundation and the 
Presbyterian church's concert series.

The newly formed Trinity Theatre opens its first program with a blast of 
unaccompanied Irish singing -- first in Gaelic, then in English -- by a woman 
named Jacintha Friel. Wearing a warm shawl, warbling her plaintive tunes, she 
transports her listeners across the water. 
</P>
<P>
Next up on the program, titled "Voices From Joyce" and "Hughie," is Matthew 
Sullivan's thoughtful recitation of the last great speech from James Joyce's 
"The Dead" -- which filmgoers heard last year in the closing minutes of John 
Huston's film of the same name. Sullivan's delivery is beautifully clear and 
understated. 
</P>
<P>
The same can't be said for Maria Hayden's performance of a monologue that Joyce 
wrote for Anna Livia in "Finnegan's Wake." Although director Jim Kerrigan 
places it into context in a brief introduction "so you're not totally lost by 
the inaccessibility of it," most listeners won't be able to make heads or tails 
of it. Hayden's stance and voice are full of oomph -- and the piece is fairly 
short. But generally this is language that should be read (with footnotes), not 
recited. 
</P>
<P>
Eugene O'Neill's one-act "Hughie" follows intermission, picking up on the same 
theme (the "shades" among us) as the excerpt from "The Dead." Kerrigan's 
gambler is properly scruffy, but he swallows too many words and his morose 
moments lack weight. As the night clerk (who says he hailed from Ireland, 
instead of the text's Saginaw), Sean O'Connor is blissfully bored by Kerrigan's 
patter. But he doesn't support the man's sudden change of mood near the end of 
the play.

SHARED LESSONS FROM 'MY PAST IS MY OWN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's nothing childish about today's "CBS Schoolbreak Special," called "My 
Past Is My Own" (airing at 3 p.m. on Channels 2 and 8). And don't think comedy, 
even though Whoopi Goldberg has the lead. 
</P>
<P>
Combining fantasy with painful reality, the hourlong film is a surprisingly 
strong look back at the civil rights struggle of the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg plays mystical, world-traveling Aunt Moriah, visiting her niece and 
nephew Kerry and Justin (Allison Dean and Phill Lewis). Using the technique of 
"hypnotic regression" that she learned in India, Moriah takes the two teens 
back to the year 1961, to help them understand why their father (Thalmus 
Rasulala) says, "We have to make good on the struggles of those who came 
before." 
</P>
<P>
Kerry and Justin find themselves in Georgia with a much younger Aunt Moriah, 
part of a group of young people about to take part in a sit-in at the local 
whites-only lunch counter. 
</P>
<P>
There are harsh, unpleasant moments -- racial slurs and violent epithets. 
Parents should be ready to discuss them with their children. 
</P>
<P>
Director Helaine Head lets the actors' faces bring the message home, and 
Goldberg is ably supported by a fine cast; Kenneth Edwards and Dominic Hoffman, 
as two of the group, are outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
With simplicity, writer and producer Alan L. Gansberg (Goldberg serves as 
creative consultant) has created an effective reminder of one history lesson 
that no one, black or white, should have to relearn. LYNNE HEFFLEY

UNFULFILLED PREMISE IN 'RED EARTH, WHITE EARTH' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CBS' "Red Earth, White Earth," tonight at 9 p.m.(Channels 2 and 8), is 
supposedly about white farmers in conflict with Native Americans over 
reservation land. That's just a backdrop, however, for soap opera with a hint 
of social conscience. 
</P>
<P>
Timothy Daly is Guy Pehrsson, driving home in his Mercedes to his grandfather's 
farm after a 10-year absence. Things have changed. Grandpa (Richard Farnsworth) 
has had a stroke, the farm is in debt and Guy's drunken, bitter father (Ralph 
Waite) is carelessly running things. His mother (Genevieve Bujold), a free 
spirit and former alcoholic, has moved in with her young Indian lover Tom 
(Billy Merasty) who was Guy's best friend. 
</P>
<P>
The good cast has nowhere to go, although Farnsworth is always a pleasure and 
Bujold, looking too young and fragile even without makeup to be the mother of 
an adult, has some affecting moments. 
</P>
<P>
Merasty is strong but under-used, a victim of the film's blurred emphasis. 
Waite is wholly unsympathetic and Daly's role is curiously passive. He is not 
directly involved in the white/Indian conflict, not even as a catalyst. 
</P>
<P>
Dramatic tension unravels as though writer Michael DeGuzman never decided what 
he was after; director David Greene is left to film a series of scenes that 
trail off like a forgotten punch line. LYNNE HEFFLEY

AGENCY VOWS FINES IN ITS SEARCH FOR PLUME SOURCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH FRAMMOLINO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Water pollution officials vowed Monday to get tough with some downtown property 
owners who have continued to ignore their requests to help find the source of a 
giant plume of underground fuel now threatening redevelopment efforts. 
</P>
<P>
State Regional Water Quality Control Board members endorsed a course of action 
by their staff to levy administrative fines -- possibly as much as $1,000 a day 
-- for the handful of companies that fail by Jan. 31 to allow underground tests 
to determine the source of the plume made up of old petroleum. 
</P>
<P>
Failure to find the sources of the plume, thought to consist of about 450,000 
gallons, is stalling cleanup efforts by the Centre City Development Corp., the 
redevelopment arm of the city of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Won't Proceed on Cleanup 
</P>
<P>
So far, the CCDC has spent $630,000 to study and monitor the plume, which 
encompasses all or parts of nine blocks in the Marina Redevelopment Area, 
running roughly between 1st and 3rd avenues and between Market Street and 
Island Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
But the redevelopment agency will not proceed with a $5.3-million cleanup of 
the mess unless it knows which properties caused the problem so they can be 
billed, said Pam Hamilton, the CCDC's executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
Finding the sources is up to the regional water board, and it has narrowed the 
possibilities to four downtown sites thought to have active or abandoned 
underground tanks, said David Barker, a board staff member. 
</P>
<P>
Only one property owner -- the Greyhound bus company -- has agreed to comply 
with the board's request to conduct soil samples to determine if its tanks have 
contributed to the plume. The results were submitted in December and are being 
studied, Barker said. 
</P>
<P>
Former and current owners of the remaining three downtown sites, however, have 
repeatedly refused requests to conduct the soil samples, Barker said. While a 
number of letters have been sent to the former and current owners during 1988, 
some have ignored the requests while others have written back to say they would 
not comply, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Board staffers have threatened the property owners with fines if they do not 
comply by Jan. 31, and water board members said they will back that up. 
</P>
<P>
"Sock it to 'em," said board member Terrance D. Thelan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Undecided on Size of Fines 
</P>
<P>
Ladin H. Delaney, the board's executive officer, said staff members have not 
decided on the size of administrative fines to be levied, but they could be as 
much as $1,000 a day for every day a property owner has failed to respond to 
the board letters, which were initially sent out in January, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The CCDC's Hamilton told water board members that the plume is hampering 
redevelopment efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't acquire the land if there is suspicion that it is contaminated by the 
plume," she said, adding that "lenders are afraid of this area." 
</P>
<P>
She also said a study conducted in August shows that the plume has slowed in 
its migration toward San Diego Bay and the construction site of the new 
waterfront convention center. She also said the CCDC has decided to drill 18 
new wells to keep tabs on the plume. 
</P>
<P>
David Allsbrook, the CCDC's project director, said two redevelopment efforts 
have been delayed because of the plume. Development agreements have been 
extended a year, until February, 1990, for Tyson Plaza -- bounded by 1st 
Avenue, G Street, Market Street and 2nd Avenue -- and the Courtyard -- bounded 
by 1st Avenue, Front Street, G Street and Market Street. 
</P>
<P>
Both of these proposed high-rise apartment and retail projects border or cover 
areas of the plume, Allsbrook said.

BILL WOULD REQUIRE VOTERS' OK OF MERGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Calling the proposed merger of San Diego Gas &amp; Electric and Southern 
California Edison an "immoral" business deal, Sen. Larry Stirling unveiled 
legislation Monday that would require the approval of San Diego County voters 
before the transaction could advance. 
</P>
<P>
The measure also would permit the San Diego County Water Authority to produce 
and sell gas and electricity and sell bonds to finance a public takeover of 
SDG&amp;E if the voters approved, Stirling said. 
</P>
<P>
But Stirling, a San Diego Republican, was promptly exposed to an unsolicited 
preview of how hard it will be to guide his bill through the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
A luncheon news conference sponsored by Stirling that included San Diego Mayor 
Maureen O'Connor was crashed by Assemblyman Steve Peace, who showed up 
uninvited and criticized the bill and the strategy Stirling and the city have 
charted to block the utility merger. 
</P>
<P>
Peace, a La Mesa Democrat, said the water board is the wrong agency to promote 
as a potential 
</P>
<P>
municipal power district because it is an appointed body he believes is 
controlled by real estate developers. Those developers want to control both 
water and power in San Diego so that they can ensure a steady supply of cheap 
electricity for pumping water and for desalination of sea water, thus allowing 
growth to continue at its current rapid rate, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Peace also suggested that the highly charged, public way in which the issue has 
been handled by San Diego political leaders may make it more difficult to win 
votes in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Comments 'Unfortunate' 
</P>
<P>
"Their fear of being stampeded or the opportunity for political capital has 
interceded to turn this into a circus," Peace said. "It is very easy for the 
San Diego delegation (in the Legislature) to win the politics and lose the 
war." 
</P>
<P>
Stirling classified Peace's comments as "unfortunate" and said he thinks his 
bill offers the best approach for heading off the merger of SDG&amp;E and 
Rosemead-based Southern California Edison. He said he might consider amending 
the bill or introducing follow-up legislation to make the water board, which he 
would rename the San Diego Water and Power Authority, more accountable to the 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
If approved by the Legislature and signed by the governor, Stirling's bill 
would apply statewide, requiring an election any time one public utility tried 
to take over another. The election would be held in the service area of the 
smaller utility. Other provisions in the bill would require any water authority 
taking over a utility to compensate local governments for the loss of 
property-tax revenue previously paid by the investor-owned utility. 
</P>
<P>
An Edison takeover of SDG&amp;E would mean the loss of local control over San 
Diego's energy supply and would probably mean higher utility rates, dirtier 
air, poorer service and worse working conditions for those utility employees 
who did not lose their jobs in the merger, Stirling said. 
</P>
<P>
He also criticized SDG&amp;E executives and board members for advancing the 
interests of the company's stockholders at the expense of local ratepayers. 
</P>
<P>
"They are trustees of a public monopoly," Stirling said. "They exist solely to 
provide a necessity of life for the health, safety, welfare and income of the 
people of SDG&amp;E's service area. For them to put the stockholders' profits 
above the health and welfare of the ratepayers is an immoral decision." 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor said Stirling's bill is needed to head off what she described as a 
"hostile takeover." 
</P>
<P>
She said that Edison and SDG&amp;E will use their considerable influence to try 
to muscle the merger through the Public Utilities Commission and to fight off 
any legislative attempt to help block the deal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Open to Suggestions 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor said she is open to suggestions from Peace and others about the best 
way for the government to take over SDG&amp;E. But she was adamant about the 
need for an election to decide the fate of Edison's proposed merger with 
SDG&amp;E. 
</P>
<P>
"Let the voters decide," she said. "It's the voters who are going to be paying 
the bills. We feel very strongly that we should participate in this decision." 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor said a public vote would render useless the hundreds of thousands of 
dollars in campaign contributions and lobbying costs expended by Edison and 
SDG&amp;E each year, which she implied give the utilities undue influence in 
the Legislature and at the PUC, whose members are appointed by the governor. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't buy off a whole city," O'Connor said. "You can try, but it's much 
more difficult. Democracy is the best thing we have going for us." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Wood, an SDG&amp;E attorney, said in a telephone interview from San Diego 
that she expects the utility to fight Stirling's measure in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
She said she believes it would be unwise and perhaps unconstitutional to take 
control of the merger out of the hands of the PUC and give it to the people. 
</P>
<P>
"I worry about elections because things tend to be hit on the surface only," 
she said. "You get into these 30-second sound-bites that sound great, but 
whether you get to the issues and get good decisions is another question." 
</P>
<P>
Wood also said the idea of a public takeover of SDG&amp;E ought to be set aside 
while the Edison-SDG&amp;E merger is considered. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think municipalization is a good idea under any circumstances," she 
said. "Utilities have to make long-term, good business decisions. When you 
politicize that process you may not get good business decisions." 
</P>
<P>
Stirling, despite Peace's objections, said he still expects to win the support 
of the entire San Diego County delegation in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
He said Assemblywoman Lucy Killea (D-San Diego) had signed on as a co-author of 
the bill, and O'Connor said Sen. Wadie Deddeh (D-Bonita) told her he would 
support the measure.

SDG&amp;E SURVEY CLAIMS VOTERS WOULD REJECT A PUBLIC TAKEOVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If an election were held today, two out of three San Diego County residents 
would probably vote against a takeover of San Diego Gas &amp; Electric by the 
San Diego County Water Authority, according to a survey released Monday by 
SDG&amp;E. 
</P>
<P>
According to the poll, conducted in early January by the San Francisco-based 
Field Research Corp., 66% of the county's residents would also prefer that the 
local utility remain a privately owned company rather than become a government 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
The poll, which cost $75,000 and evidently marks the start of an SDG&amp;E 
campaign aimed at stopping a government takeover, drew a harsh response from 
critics of the proposed merger between SDG&amp;E and Edison. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Keeping It in SDG&amp;E's Arena 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor claimed that "the only real poll that will 
count is when we put it to the vote of the people. . . . (The utilities) don't 
want it to go to a vote of the people. They want to keep it in the arena they 
control." O'Connor spokesman Paul Downey claimed that Field's "methodology is 
suspect because (pollsters) never mentioned the word Edison. They never once 
mentioned the proposed merger." 
</P>
<P>
SDG&amp;E spokeswoman Karen Hutchens maintained that the poll's validity was 
not affected by the decision to avoid questions on the proposed merger between 
SDG&amp;E and Edison. The proposed merger "is a separate issue" from the 
government takeover, Hutchens said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Shames, executive director of Utility Consumers Action Network, on 
Monday described the poll as premature. 
</P>
<P>
"The public is not going to be hot on buying a utility unless it makes economic 
sense, and no one has proved that yet," Shames said. "SDG&amp;E wasted 
$75,000." 
</P>
<P>
UCAN members, Shames said, have made it clear that they are not going to 
support a merger or a takeover unless someone proves that it is going to save 
them money. "That's the critical point, and SDG&amp;E ignored it." 
</P>
<P>
State Assemblyman Larry Stirling, who is preparing legislation to allow a vote 
of the people on a takeover, on Monday argued that the poll was not valid 
because SDG&amp;E "posed a false question." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Ought to Be Told the Whole Truth' 
</P>
<P>
Voters "ought to be told the whole truth . . . that by and large rates are 
lower under municipal ownership than they are under investor ownership," 
Stirling said. 
</P>
<P>
SDG&amp;E, which has pledged to oppose a government takeover of its business, 
plans to publicize results of the poll, beginning with full-page newspaper 
advertisements that appeared this morning in local newspapers. The 
advertisements include a clip-out coupon that encourages readers to register 
their opposition to a "government takeover of SDG&amp;E." Shareholders of the 
local utility paid $75,000 for the poll, Hutchens said. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of the 803 respondents who completed the lengthy telephone poll 
said they would oppose a $3-billion bond issue to finance an acquisition of 
SDG&amp;E by the CWA. About 25% said they would support a bond issue, and the 
rest had no opinion. 
</P>
<P>
However, the CWA has yet to indicate what level of financing would be required 
to acquire SDG&amp;E, and Field did not fully explain why the $3-billion figure 
was used in the poll.

MOTHER OF VICTIM SUES KILLER, 73;

FAMILY UPSET BY OUTPOURING OF SYMPATHY FOR SLAYER

<P>
The mother of a Southeast San Diego man shot to death, allegedly by a neighbor 
who was irate about a parking problem, has filed a wrongful death lawsuit 
against the neighbor in Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Martha Copper of Alpine alleges in court documents that the "negligence" of 
retired junk-car dealer Sam Lewis caused the death of her son, Sean Nichols, 
who was 28 when he was killed Nov. 22 in his Gavin Street home. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, 73, is charged with two counts of murder in the deaths of Nichols and 
his friend, Robert Rose, 33. His preliminary hearing is scheduled for Thursday 
in San Diego Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors say that the confrontation that left Nichols and Rose dead erupted 
after Lewis became angry about a car that was blocking his driveway. Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Robert Eichler said Lewis grabbed a .32-caliber revolver, walked 
across the street and confronted Nichols through his screen door before firing 
two fatal shots into the small living room. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, who had lived on Gavin Street for about 15 years, then walked back home, 
asked his wife, Bertha, to call police, and turned himself in. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fired With No Warning 
</P>
<P>
An eyewitness who was in the living room at the time of the shooting told 
police that an "angry" Lewis opened fire even though Nichols had offered to ask 
a friend in the rear of the home to move the offending car. 
</P>
<P>
But defense attorney Millie Durovic said Lewis shot Nichols and Rose in 
self-defense, believing they were going for guns. No weapons were found in the 
house, but Durovic said Lewis heard Nichols ask another person in the home to 
get him a gun and that he feared for his life. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, filed a week ago, seeks unspecified general and compensatory 
damages. But, in an interview Monday, Copper said that she and her husband, 
Tom, were not motivated by hopes of financial gain in suing Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not about money, because there is no amount of money that can bring 
back my son," Copper said. "Nothing is going to make it right. But there have 
been all these suggestions that this man was justified in doing this, that he 
had a reason. Well, we just can't take that. We just got tired of it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tide of Support 
</P>

Copper was referring to the tide of support Lewis has received from friends and 
community members, who founded a "Sam Lewis Support Fund" and raised enough 
money to bail the Mississippi native out of jail in time for Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Many supporters have painted Lewis as a sort of folk hero, suggesting in 
interviews and in letters to newspapers that he was justified in shooting 
Nichols and Rose. At the same time, the two victims have been portrayed as drug 
dealers who "tormented" the elderly Lewis, although police say there is no 
evidence supporting those conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
The Coppers' attorney, Peter S. Doft, said the civil action against Lewis 
alleges that "whatever justification Mr. Lewis might think he had in shooting 
Mr. Nichols, he was mistaken in that belief."

SETUP FOR PAYING JAIL DOCTORS SPURS INQUIRY 
</P>

Spurred by an audit showing that doctors in San Diego County jails have been 
paid tens of thousands of dollars for hours they did not work, county officials 
plan to examine other county contracts to ensure that similar arrangements do 
not exist elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Although top county administrators expressed doubt Monday that any comparable 
payroll problems exist in other departments, they acknowledged that a county 
auditor's report showing that the jails' three doctors received nearly $100,000 
in salary and benefits for time not worked during the last fiscal year points 
up the need for a thorough review of county programs. 
</P>
<P>
"There are regular checks and audits, but in any large organization, some 
things inevitably are going to fall between the cracks," said David Janssen, 
the county's assistant chief administrative officer. "We have a good system. 
But you can't catch everything." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Policy Changed 
</P>
<P>
County administrators characterized the 24-year-old policy under which the 
doctors were paid as being ill-advised but not illegal, but they said no 
employees will be disciplined and they will not seek repayment of funds. 
</P>
<P>
The payment policy was changed last summer because of the audit, and doctors in 
county jails now are paid only for the hours they work. 
</P>
<P>
The policy, begun in 1965, created a quasi-retainer for doctors who provided 
part-time medical services in the jails while maintaining their private 
practices, county officials said. Feeling that the county's maximum salary -- 
$6.51 an hour in 1965 -- was too low to attract doctors, county officials 
decided to pay the physicians for more hours than they actually worked, 
establishing what they considered to be a more equitable salary. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't right, but we did it for years because that's the way it had always 
been done," said Cmdr. John Galt, head of the Sheriff's Department jail support 
bureau. "At the time it started, the problem we faced was, where do you find a 
doctor who's willing to come in at 7 in the morning a few days a week for $6 an 
hour? This was a way to make it halfway worth their while." 
</P>
<P>
Because most county records are destroyed after two years, it is impossible to 
estimate how much doctors were paid over the years for time not worked, 
according to Christopher Gilmore, head of the audit division of the county 
auditor and controller's office. However, the $100,000 figure found in the 
1987-88 fiscal year audit suggests that the 24-year total could reach seven 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Salary and Benefits 
</P>
<P>
According to the audit and county payroll records, dentist Philip Burgess was 
paid an average of $22.83 per hour for 20 hours weekly last year, even though 
he worked only about five hours a week. Similarly, Dr. Jules Frank was paid for 
38 hours a week at $26.44 per hour while working only about eight hours weekly, 
and Dr. Merrit Matthews, who only worked 12 hours per week, was paid the same 
hourly rate for 25 hours weekly. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the three doctors also received fringe benefits valued at roughly a 
fourth of his salary. As a result, the amount that the county paid last year in 
salary and benefits for time not worked totaled about $52,000 for Frank and 
$22,000 each for both Burgess and Matthews. 
</P>
<P>
The inflated time sheets were filled out, not by the doctors themselves, but by 
jail administrators acting in accord with the longstanding policy, county 
auditors found. Janssen, however, explained that an informal opinion from the 
county counsel's office determined that there was no criminal intent in that 
arrangement. Therefore, no legal or administrative action will be taken against 
any of the principals, he added. 
</P>
<P>
For the same reason, the county apparently has no legal grounds for seeking 
repayment for the time not worked, Janssen said. 
</P>
<P>
Burgess, who had worked for the county for about 3 1/2 years, stopped providing 
dental services in the jails shortly after the county changed its policy so 
that doctors were paid only for hours worked, jail administrator Galt said. 
Frank, who had worked for the county since the policy began in 1965, retired 
last week, but will work in the jails about 10 hours weekly at $26.44 per hour, 
under a special three-month contract. Matthews, who has worked for the county 
since 1976, will continue to work 20 hours weekly at the same hourly rate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Focus on Problem 
</P>
<P>
The major problem highlighted by the audit, Galt argued, has more to do with 
how the doctors were paid than with how much they were paid. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not very competitive, salary-wise, as it is," Galt said. "This (policy) 
was a way of trying to attract professionals who probably wouldn't have 
bothered with this kind of work otherwise. . . . Still, it would have been 
better to just pay them under a simple contract -- X dollars for X amount of 
work -- all along."

<P>
A nephew of Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad) has agreed to replant 12 acres of 
vegetation along the San Luis Rey River in exchange for the district attorney's 
office dropping a misdemeanor charge that he cleared the farmland, which was a 
habitat for the least Bell's vireo, an endangered bird. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, announced Friday, calls for H. Von Packard Jr. to plant 1,000 
trees, including black willows, cottonwoods, wild roses and live oaks on the 
property, at a cost of up to $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
Packard's attorney, Charles Goldberg, said the land was cleared by a farmer who 
was leasing the land from Packard and planned to plant tomatoes on it. In the 
agreement with prosecutors, Packard said he did not intend to cause any harm to 
the river bank, but nonetheless accepted responsibility for the farmer's 
action. 
</P>
<P>
The land clearing was in violation of a state Department of Fish and Game law 
that prohibits the changing of a river bank without first notifying wildlife 
officials. The misdemeanor carries a maximum sentence of six months in jail and 
a $500 fine. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office charged Packard with the crime in November, but 
Goldberg said he and prosecutors were already in settlement negotiations, which 
included Packard hiring an environmental consultant to determine how to repair 
the damage.

A police detective testified Monday that a man accused in the downtown drive-by 
shooting of three people told him he shot the victims "for their own good." 
</P>
<P>
Detective Robert Brown said at the preliminary hearing that Rolando Ignacio 
admitted shooting the people. Brown testified that he asked Ignacio after his 
arrest, "Why did you shoot those people?" and that Ignacio replied, "Because I 
was angry." 
</P>
<P>
" 'I put the bullets in the gun and I went downtown to shoot someone,' " Brown 
said Ignacio told him. 
</P>
<P>
A San Marcos couple also testified, from wheelchairs, about their wounds. 
Robert Mengar, 59, and his fiancee, Cynthia Conyiers, 37, appeared at the 
hearing for Ignacio, 25, of Encanto. 
</P>
<P>
The Nov. 22 shootings, which also wounded Susan Snyder, 29, of San Diego, 
occurred as Mengar and Conyiers were leaving a Lions Club meeting. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Municipal Judge Joe Littlejohn ordered Ignacio to stand trial on 
three counts of attempted murder and three counts of assault with a deadly 
weapon. Littlejohn left bail at $500,000 and ordered Ignacio, who is in County 
Jail, to appear Feb. 10 for arraignment and trial setting.

POLICE MEMO ON PAROLED KILLER MAILED TO NEIGHBORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY and BARBARA KOH, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A strongly worded Los Angeles Police Department internal memo about a paroled 
killer has been mailed without authorization to residents of the ex-convict's 
North Hollywood neighborhood, a spokesman for the department said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The memo, which describes Raymond Louis George, 36, as a "dangerous threat to 
be taken seriously," could create unnecessary fear in the community, said Capt. 
Daniel B. Watson, who drafted the memo. 
</P>
<P>
George -- convicted of killing a police officer, assaulting two others and 
attacking a college student with a machete -- was paroled Wednesday. He is 
living in an apartment in the 11800 block of Vanowen Street, where he is 
visited daily by a parole officer, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Watson, patrol commander of the department's North Hollywood Division, said he 
drafted the two-page memo Jan. 13 after he was notified of George's release. He 
said he ordered it distributed to North Hollywood patrol officers and to other 
police stations in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Psychiatric Condition 
</P>
<P>
George, on medication for a psychiatric condition, is described in the memo as 
a "5150," the police code for a mentally unstable person. The memo also details 
his criminal history. 
</P>
<P>
"George is a 5150 who believes his mission in life is to kill police officers 
and women," the memo says. "Needless to say, George is a dangerous threat to be 
taken seriously. There is no new information indicating he wants to kill a 
police officer, but extreme caution should be used if you come in contact with 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Watson said he is unhappy that details of the memo have been made public. He 
said he has no idea who might be responsible. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not made for the community," Watson said. "It was a message from myself 
to my officers. Our officers would be facing a potential risk if they came in 
contact with him. It was supposed to be kept behind closed doors." 
</P>
<P>
Watson said the memo was strongly worded to make sure officers took notice. He 
acknowledged that the wording could unduly alarm the community. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we don't know that that is any longer the case," Watson said of the 
memo's description of George. "I don't want to create unnecessary fear." 
</P>
<P>
Copies of the memo arrived by mail at The Times, which reported George's parole 
last week. Residents of three homes on Vanowen said they received the memo 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The anonymous sender said in a note in the same envelope as the memo that 
copies had been mailed to 50 residents who live near George. 
</P>
<P>
"George is a time bomb," the note says. "They have a right to know who is 
living in their neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
Tony Chavez, 32, said he learned of George's presence in the neighborhood from 
the memo mailed to his house. "We're pretty concerned with this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Decision 
</P>
<P>
Chavez said he has not decided whether to take the note's advice and contact 
authorities to protest George's presence in the neighborhood, or to keep quiet. 
</P>
<P>
Calvary Temple on Vanowen also received the memo in the mail, said Tom 
Pennington, temple pastor. 
</P>
<P>
"If this stuff is factual, it's really not fair to us," Pennington said. 
Referring to children in the neighborhood, he said: "To me, it's a 
life-threatening position they could be in." 
</P>
<P>
Pennington said he told two neighbors about the letter, "not to be 
discriminatory, but to be aware. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
George was convicted of second-degree murder in the Oct. 21, 1974, killing of 
David Jack, 21, a state police officer. He was also convicted of attempting to 
murder two Los Angeles police officers, one of whom was shot four times, and a 
19-year-old woman who was permanently disabled when he attacked her with a 
machete. 
</P>
<P>
George was paroled in 1983 but was returned to prison when police arrested him 
for possession of a weapon, a knife found taped to his leg.

RESTAURANT'S CUSTOMERS CAN DANCE ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY PYLE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Folk dancing by patrons may continue at the Great Greek restaurant, despite 
neighbors' complaints that the revelry attracts too many customers who make 
noise late at night and gobble up parking on residential streets. 
</P>
<P>
"The sole request here is to legalize the apparently spontaneous inclination of 
patrons to join the dancing done by waiters," said John J. Parker, associate 
zoning administrator for the city of Los Angeles, in a ruling released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Before the ruling, the restaurant's entertainment permit only had allowed the 
waiters to dance. But when Greek folk music was played, waiters encouraged 
diners to join them in conga-style lines. 
</P>
<P>
Parker said he attached strict conditions to his approval to try to address the 
neighbors' concerns. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling requires that the restaurant hire two security guards to monitor 
parking, noise and the number of restaurant patrons. It also requires that 
outdoor lighting be subdued, that off-site parking be increased from 54 to 60 
spaces, that garbage not be picked up after 10 p.m. and that neighbors who live 
within 500 feet of the establishment be given its telephone number so they can 
complain directly when problems arise. 
</P>
<P>
However, neighborhood residents said they would appeal Parker's ruling to the 
Board of Zoning Appeals because they think it rewards past illegal activities. 
The Great Greek has been cited twice by the Los Angeles Fire Department for 
exceeding its 119-person occupancy limit. And Parker said in the ruling that 
the restaurant has not provided enough off-street parking. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds like Mr. Parker is saying, 'Well, they're breaking the law, so let's 
make this legal so they won't be breaking the law anymore,' " said John Allen, 
a member of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not Ecstatic' 
</P>
<P>
A private planning consultant hired by restaurant owner Ernie Criezis said that 
Criezis was "not ecstatic" about the conditions because of the expense involved 
in complying, but that he probably would not appeal. Under zoning regulations, 
both sides have until Feb. 2 to appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm advising them to just try to grit their teeth," said consultant Karen 
Blackwell. "If this is what it takes, if this really will improve the quality 
of life in the neighborhood, they will benefit from that, too. You really don't 
want to be at odds with your neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Mike Woo had opposed the dancing permit at the restaurant because of 
the previous problems. Julie Jaskol, a spokeswoman for the councilman, said Woo 
felt that the ruling "more than satisfies our concerns," but she said that he 
wanted to talk with area residents about their lingering concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, similar conditions were attached to a dancing permit for the 
Moonlight Tango restaurant, which has the same owner and is also on Ventura 
Boulevard in Sherman Oaks.

PLANE CRASH KILLS MAN ON WEEK OF RETIREMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A 65-year-old pilot who had planned to retire this week from his job as a 
toolmaker was killed when his light plane crashed in Lake View Terrace, 
authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The body of Merlin Thomas Glass, 65, of San Jacinto, was found after the 
wreckage of his single-engine Gruman was spotted at 7:40 a.m. on the side of a 
hill at the Lopez Canyon Landfill, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
Glass had been commuting each week from his home in Riverside County to a 
temporary job at Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Co., said Gail Glass, his wife. 
He had left Ryan Field in Hemet shortly after 11 p.m. Sunday en route to 
Burbank airport, police said. 
</P>
<P>
A pilot for more than 50 years, Glass had for years traveled by air to 
temporary jobs in the Los Angeles area, his wife said. He had been working for 
Lockheed since December, she said. He often flew into the area on Sunday nights 
and returned to San Jacinto on Friday nights, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was going to retire from work at the end of this week, believe it or not," 
she said. "I wish now it had been last week." 
</P>
<P>
The fatal crash is under investigation by police and the National 
Transportation Safety Board. However, authorities on Monday had not found what 
caused Glass' plane to crash about six miles northwest of Burbank airport. 
</P>
<P>
"The aircraft appeared to have been intact" when it struck the hillside, 
Detective Stephen Fisk said. 
</P>
<P>
There was no sign of fire on the plane before or after the crash, Fisk said. 
"There was no indication of a mechanical problem. The fuel tanks ruptured on 
impact, but there was fuel in the plane." 
</P>
<P>
Although it is not known if weather played a part in the accident, skies 
reportedly were clear at the time Glass took off, Fisk said. 
</P>
<P>
There was no indication that Glass had been reported missing, and the wreckage 
of the white and blue plane was not discovered until a landfill employee 
spotted it as he arrived for work, police said. 
</P>
<P>
There were no known witnesses to the crash, and investigators were unable to 
pinpoint its exact time. "It happened sometime during the night," Fisk said. 
</P>
<P>
A Lockheed official on Monday could not immediately confirm that Glass was 
employed by the firm. 
</P>
<P>
Gail Glass said her husband had learned to fly when he was 14 and had worked at 
one time as a crop duster.

Pepperdine, ranked fifth in the nation, finished third at the Santa Barbara 
tournament.

5 CANYONS PLAYERS AWAIT ARRAIGNMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Lee Smelser, men's basketball coach at College of the Canyons, said Monday that 
he will wait for the outcome of an arraignment hearing before deciding whether 
disciplinary action will be taken against 5 Cougar players arrested Sunday 
after an early-morning scuffle with 5 off-duty Sherriff's deputies outside a 
Santa Clarita Valley restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
The players, who are scheduled to appear in Newhall Municipal Court on 
Wednesday at 8:30 a.m., are practicing with the team pending the outcome of the 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll just have to look at the decision that is handed down and go from 
there," said Smelser, who also is Canyons' athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred at the In-N-Out Burger restaurant at The Old Road and 
Chiquella Lane near the Golden State Freeway at 1:10 a.m. -- a few hours after 
Canyons' 79-76 Western State Conference loss to Oxnard on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the deputies involved works at the Peter J. Pitchess Honor Rancho, a 
county jail in Castaic. Deputy Daniel Fedele sustained a head wound during the 
incident and was taken to Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital, where he was 
treated and released, Sgt. Michael Watner said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Loren Cash and Kevin Price, both 19, and of Valencia, Deon Myricks, 19, of 
Northridge, Aaron Clark, 21, of Canyon Country, and Michael Collins, 19, of Los 
Angeles were booked in the Santa Clarita Valley Sherriff's station for assault 
with intent to commit great bodily harm and were held in lieu of $3,000 bail 
each. 
</P>
<P>
Cash, Collins and Myricks were released Sunday on their own recognizance, Clark 
was released Sunday on bond and Price was released Monday on his written 
promise to appear, said Det. Richard Cesaroni, who is investigating the case. 
</P>
<P>
Cesaroni said Monday that he was in the process of locating and interviewing 
witnesses, including other Canyons players who were present at the incident. 
Cesaroni said he will present his findings this morning to the district 
attorney, who will decide whether to proceed with the case.

<P>
North Hollywood High outlasted Monroe, 1-0, on a drenched field Monday at 
Monroe to move into sole possession of first place in the Valley Pac-8 
Conference boys' soccer standings. 
</P>
<P>
The win moved the Huskies (8-3-1, 3-0-1 in league play) a half-game ahead of 
previously unbeaten Monroe (7-1, 3-1). 
</P>
<P>
"It was wet, but the field was in pretty good shape," North Hollywood 
first-year Coach Chris Van Duin said. "If it had been at our place, the field 
would have been a mud bowl. We call ours Astro-dirt." 
</P>
<P>
Senior forward Pablo Crespo scored the only goal of the match 5 minutes into 
the second half on an assist from senior halfback Jose Umana. 
</P>
<P>
Junior goalkeeper Leo Gonzalez, who recorded his third shutout, preserved the 
lead by blocking a penalty kick by Oscar Rios with 15 minutes to play.

as the Chancellors built a 3-0 lead. Starter Scott Kuhn shut down the Hunters 
in the second half. 
</P>

San Fernando 3, Kennedy 2 -- Sergio Pizano scored all 3 goals for San Fernando 
with assists from Elenilson Garcia, Jaime Ballesteros and Marco Jaramillo in 
the Northwest Valley Conference match at Kenendy. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando led, 1-0, at halftime, but Keith West and Rubin Rios scored for 
Kennedy early in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Pizano scored with 10 minutes remaining and again with 3 minutes to play. San 
Fernando is 6-1-2, 3-0-2 in league play. Kennedy is 3-3-3, 1-1-3. 
</P>
<P>
Grant 3, Birmingham 0 -- Birmingham, playing without its 4 starting forwards, 
each sidelined with the flu, was unable to mount a consistent offensive attack 
in a Valley Pac-8 Conference match at Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
Birmingham is 6-3, 2-2 in league play. 
</P>
<P>
Reseda 0, Poly 0-Reseda goalkeeper Danny Keeva recorded his fourth shutout of 
the season in a Valley Pac-8 Conference match at Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams had 12 shots on goal.

</P>
<P>
Cleveland 0, Granada Hills 0 -- Granada Hills forward Heros Daniels was awarded 
a penalty kick after being tripped midway through the second half. But Daniels 
missed the shot and the Northwest Valley Conference match ended in a scoreless 
tie. 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills goalkeeper Erick Miseroy blocked 11 shots. Granada Hills took 
only 5 shots on goal. 
</P>
<P>

remaining to give host Alemany a San Fernando Valley League win. 
</P>
<P>
After a scoreless first half, Chaminade's Maria Costa scored the game's first 
goal before Renaud, a junior, and teammate Yvette Lopez each scored to give 
Alemany (11-6-2, 4-0) a 2-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Jenny Roberts added a goal for Chaminade (2-2 in league play) to tie the score 
before Renaud followed with the game-winner.

MONSANTO GETS OK TO SELL SILICON UNIT TO GERMANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A high-level U.S. review board recommended Monday that the Bush Administration 
not try to block plans by Monsanto to sell a silicon manufacturing subsidiary 
in Palo Alto to a West German company, despite earlier concerns that it could 
pose some national security risks. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said the recommendation came after the would-be buyer provided 
written assurances that it would keep the factories and research and 
development facilities inside the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The firm, known as the Monsanto Electronic Materials Co., is the nation's last 
remaining major producer of silicon wafers, the materials from which the 
semiconductors used in computers and other vital electronic products are made. 
</P>
<P>
Monsanto has said it plans to sell the company to a West German firm, Huels AG, 
a unit of West Germany's huge Veba AG conglomerate. Three potential U.S. 
bidders, including one representing some employees in Palo Alto, also had 
expressed interest in buying the plant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Case Goes to Bush 
</P>
<P>
Although most of the agencies on the high-level panel had favored allowing the 
sale to go through unimpeded, the Defense Department had raised concerns that 
the United States might lose control over the plant -- particularly its 
manufacturing and research and development facilities. 
</P>
<P>
But Defense Department officials withdrew their objections Monday, and the 
recommendation that the United States not block the sale now is unanimous. The 
case goes to President Bush, who is considered certain to go along with the 
recommendation. Bush has 15 days to decide. 
</P>
<P>
The move to review the proposed sale of the Monsanto firm came under a 
provision of the recently enacted Omnibus Trade Act, which made it easier for 
outsiders -- including the affected firm's competitors -- to challenge the sale 
of a domestic corporation to foreign buyers. 
</P>
<P>
The government has been under increasing pressure from Congress to become 
"tougher" about foreign acquisition of U.S. companies, particularly in the face 
of the sharply lower dollar, which makes U.S. firms attractive to overseas 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. James J. Florio (D-N.J.), author of the trade act provision and chairman 
of a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee, has vowed to conduct hearings on 
the foreign acquisition issue. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials say they see nothing wrong per se with most foreign 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Production Fears Cited 
</P>
<P>
The high-level government panel that conducted the review is known as the 
Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States and is made up of 
sub-Cabinet-level officials from about half a dozen agencies and departments, 
including Treasury, Defense, Commerce and State. 
</P>
<P>
The review came after competing bidders had suggested that if Huels bought the 
firm it would close a Monsanto plant in Missouri and only operate a 
Spartanburg, S.C., facility, reducing America's ability to produce silicon. 
Monsanto officials denied that charge. 
</P>
<P>
The committee met informally to discuss the case a week ago but delayed any 
decision until Monday, after Monsanto and Huels had had time to respond to the 
Defense Department's objections. Had the United States sought to block the 
move, another bidder would have stepped in. A purchase price on the acquisition 
has not been disclosed.

Hughes Aircraft completed its acquisition of Western Union's Westar satellite 
system, which includes three orbiting satellites and a fourth satellite 
awaiting launch. Hughes did not disclose terms of the deal, but analysts have 
valued the deal at $100 to $200 million. Stephen J. Petrucci, president of 
Hughes Communications, said the Westar system will ease a shortage of capacity 
in Hughes' Galaxy satellite fleet and provide a backup for commercial 
customers.

The Treasury sold $7.2 billion of new three-month bills at an average discount 
rate of 8.26%, down from 8.30% last week. Another $7.2 billion of new six-month 
bills was sold at an average discount rate of 8.31%, down from 8.35% last week. 
The rates were the lowest since three-month bills sold for 8.24% on Jan. 3 and 
six-month bills averaged 8.29% on Dec. 19. The new discount rates understate 
the actual return to investors -- 8.55% for three-month bills, with a $10,000 
bill selling for $9,791.20, and 8.79% for six-month bills selling for 
$9,579.90. The discount rate reflects the price discount received when 
government securities are purchased at less than face value.

U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe, the federal judge hearing the stock 
manipulation case against GAF Corp. ordered jurors to return next Monday in the 
event a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that halted the trial is lifted. Sunday 
night, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall temporarily halted the 
trial and gave federal prosecutors until Wednesday to file arguments with the 
Supreme Court. Marshall could possibly lift the stay or continue the halt while 
the full Supreme Court continues to review the matter. GAF's first trial ended 
in a mistrial two weeks ago.

DEL WEBB SUES CALMARK OVER SEC FILINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL DELUGACH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Responding to a $150-million cash takeover offer, Arizona developer Del Webb 
Corp. sued the Los Angeles-based Calmark Holding Corp. investment group for 
allegedly misleading the public in filings with the government concerning the 
proposed acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
Privately owned Calmark develops, manages and syndicates residential and 
commercial real estate. Last December, Calmark bought the Vagabond hotel chain 
from imprisoned Wall Street speculator Ivan F. Boesky. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Webb said it had asked the Calmark group for financial 
information so it could evaluate its $17-per-share offer, which was made Dec. 
27. Getting no answer, Webb said Monday, it was left with "no choice" but to 
sue. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges that the Calmark group's 13D filing with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission did not disclose that Calmark President Donald J. Brumlik 
was disbarred in 1980, had filed for bankruptcy and has been a defendant for 
alleged failure to pay financial obligations in Illinois and California. 
</P>
<P>
Filed in U.S. District Court in Phoenix, the suit said Brumlik was disbarred in 
Illinois because of a disciplinary complaint accusing him of "repeated 
conversion of substantial amounts of cash from clients, partners and 
employees." 
</P>
<P>
Brumlik said late Monday that he had "withdrawn" as an Illinois lawyer because 
he could not afford to fight the charges against him, but that they were not 
adjudicated. He acknowledged that he had been in financial difficulty in the 
late 1970s and early 1980s and had filed bankruptcy in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Answer 
</P>
<P>
The Webb suit also said Calmark Chairman Uri Sheinbaum has been a defendant in 
a number of civil suits alleging failure to satisfy financial obligations and 
is the subject of a civil fraud suit in connection with syndication of Texas 
real estate. This information was not mentioned in the 13D, the suit alleged. 
</P>
<P>
Sheinbaum's office referred inquiries to a public relations consultant, who 
could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
The suit also alleged that Calmark did not disclose that affiliate Northview 
Corp. is a defendant in a pending civil suit arising from Boesky's criminal 
case. 
</P>
<P>
Another defendant, New York investment banker Oppenheimer &amp; Co., which is 
Calmark's investment adviser, was accused in Webb's suit of breach of contract 
and fiduciary duty. Webb alleged that Oppenheimer received confidential 
information as a financial adviser for the Webb-controlled Claridge 
hotel-casino in Atlantic City last April. No one was available for comment at 
Oppenheimer's Los Angeles office. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles-based ESA Associates made an unsolicited bid of $17.50 a share for 
Webb last July. The suit alleges that the recent 13D falsely said that ESA 
discontinued discussions with Webb after getting "a strong negative response."

<P>
Analysts have said the support of such large institutional shareholders would 
tend to dilute Icahn's chances of launching and winning a proxy fight for the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
Icahn, who owns 16.2% of Texaco, has said he may push his own slate of 
directors. But since Texaco has granted a CALPERS nominee a seat on the board, 
analysts said Icahn may have less support from institutional shareholders if he 
launches a proxy contest. 
</P>
<P>
Texaco stock, which had been boosted by speculation of an Icahn-led takeover, 
closed down $1.375 a share at $54.25 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Texaco President and Chief Executive James W. Kinnear said Texaco had held 
talks with CALPERS about the qualifications and criteria for board candidates. 
During those talks, CALPERS suggested 14 possible board nominees, including 
Brademas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Another Nominee 
</P>
<P>
"We share CALPERS' enthusiasm for Brademas and are delighted our entire 
selection process has produced two superbly qualified candidates for the 
board," Kinnear said. 
</P>
<P>
Brademas will join the board later this month. In addition, nominee Charles H. 
Price will join the board in March after completing his tenure as the U.S. 
ambassador to Britain. 
</P>
<P>
Texaco also said Lorene Rogers, retired president of the University of Texas at 
Austin and a Texaco director since 1976, would retire when her term ends this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Both Price and Brademas will stand for reelection at the 1989 annual meeting, 
increasing the board size by one to 15, if they win their seats. 
</P>
<P>
Icahn failed in a proxy fight last year after the company won the backing of 
institutional shareholders such as CALPERS that were seeking greater say in the 
nomination of directors. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to boost profits, the company also underwent a $6-billion 
restructuring. As part of that asset sale program, it agreed on Friday to shed 
its 78% owned Texaco Canada Inc. for $3.24 billion.

COMPUTERLAND SETTLES SUIT FOR $30 MILLION

<P>
A $30-million settlement has been reached in a lawsuit filed by ComputerLand 
Corp. franchise operators against the company, the nation's largest franchised 
retail computer store chain, it was announced on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement with the 800-store company provides for a permanent contractual 
reduction in franchisee royalty rates to 5% from 8%, according to attorney 
Norman Stone, who represented the plaintiffs in the class-action suit. 
</P>
<P>
The company also agreed to forgive $5.2 million in debt from past franchise 
holders and pay $720,000 to all franchisees. 
</P>
<P>
The reduction in royalty rates "represents a savings of about $23.4 million to 
member franchisees" over the next three years alone, Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
ComputerLand attorney Edward Keech said that "broadly defined, the class 
represents all present and former U.S. franchisees." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
List of Grievances 
</P>
<P>
The suit was initially filed in 1984 by Michael Belling and Kenneth Klein, the 
former operators of ComputerLand stores in Marin County, Calif. They alleged 
that the company failed to ship them products, leading to lost profits and 
eventually the failure of their stores. 
</P>
<P>
A class action was filed a year later on behalf of all stores worldwide, said 
Ralph Miller, a spokesman for the plaintiffs. He said the action was cut to 
only U.S. store operators, which "meant about 500 people." 
</P>
<P>
The suit also contended that ComputerLand failed to pass on inventory and 
supplies at cost, did not obtain the best prices available for the benefit of 
franchisees, failed to pass on discounts to the stores and did not take 
favorable trade terms when offered by suppliers, Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the settlement, Keech said, ComputerLand received a release from the 
plaintiffs giving up their right to sue the company. 
</P>
<P>
The cash portion of the settlement comes from insurance funds, Keech said. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit was one flare-up in several years of stormy relations between 
ComputerLand Corp. and its franchisees. 
</P>
<P>
In September, 1985, the franchisees demanded and received the resignations of 
controversial founder and Chief Executive William H. Millard and his daughter, 
Barbara, as president, after they refused to cut franchise fees in the midst of 
a computer slump.

JAPANESE GROUP BUYS MARRIOTT HOTEL IN CENTURY CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Another choice piece of Los Angeles real estate -- the newly opened, luxury J. 
W. Marriott Hotel in Century City -- has been quietly sold to a Japanese realty 
and development firm for $85 million. 
</P>
<P>
Sumitomo Realty of New York purchased the 375-room, 17-story building and 
certain leases on the property, according to Jonathan Q. Loeb, general manager 
of the J. W. Marriott. However, Marriott Corp. of Bethesda, Md., retains 
ownership of the land and continues to manage the luxury facility as a 
Marriott. 
</P>
<P>
The actual sale to Sumitomo was completed in October but was not made public 
until Monday when Sonnenblick-Goldman Corp. of California, a Century City real 
estate investment firm, disclosed that it had put the deal together. It had 
declined to identify the buyer. 
</P>
<P>
The Marriott is the latest prime U.S. hotel property to be snapped up by 
Japanese investors. Aoki Corp. purchased Westin Hotels &amp; Resorts, which 
operates major American hotels including the Century Plaza Hotel, located just 
north of the Marriott. 
</P>
<P>
Last October, Seibu/Saison Group paid $2.27 billion to buy the 
Inter-Continental Hotel chain, which includes the Mark Hopkins in San 
Francisco, the Mayfair in London and part ownership in the Willard in 
Washington. Both Japan Air Lines and All Nippon Airways operate hotels in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opened Last June 
</P>
<P>
The J. W. Marriott, which opened last June, is on Avenue of the Stars, next to 
Fox Plaza, where former President Ronald Reagan will have an office. 
</P>
<P>
Travel &amp; Leisure magazine awarded the Century City Marriott, which took 
nearly two years to build, its "Best Performance by Major Chain" award last 
month. Half the rooms are suites.The hotel also has a 150-seat restaurant and 
lounge, conference rooms, a 300-car parking garage and a recreation center. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Marriott in Bethesda said the Century City hotel was put in a 
limited partnership in which Sumitomo is the general partner. He added that 
about 90% of the chain's hotels are not owned by Marriott. 
</P>
<P>
Sonnenblick-Goldman called the purchase price "one of the highest paid per room 
for a hotel in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Greg Skjonsby, spokesman for Sonnenblick-Goldman, explained: "Marriott 
typically sells parts of the properties they develop so its investors do not 
have to carry the burden of costs associated with construction and financing."

 San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co.'s 1988 profits dipped 3%, to $177.6 million. 
Revenue rose to $2.08 billion, up 9%. The utility attributed the results to a 
decision by the California Public Utilities Commission lowering SDG&amp;E's 
return on equity from 13.9% in 1987 to 12.75% in 1988.

MILITARY'S PHYSICAL PRESENCE IN COUNTY REMAINS STRONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While the flow of defense contracting dollars into San Diego County has slowed, 
the military's physical presence remains strong. 
</P>
<P>
"There are still about 140,000 active-duty military in San Diego, and, with 
dependents and retirees, the figure goes up to 400,000," according to U. S. 
Navy Chief Craig Huebler. "The military continues to be the single largest 
employer in San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
The Navy accounts for slightly more than 100,000 of the county's active-duty 
personnel. Most of the rest are Marines. San Diego's military bases are 
increasingly being used to train service personnel, Huebler said. About 15,000 
military personnel are now in the county for training. And much of the 
military's construction program in the county has been dedicated to classroom 
and training facilities, Huebler said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Number of Ships Based in S.D. Is Stable 
</P>
<P>
The number of Navy ships based in San Diego has remained stable in recent 
years, despite fears that several ships would be lost to the controversial 
home-porting program that transferred many to new ports. 
</P>
<P>
The aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk, one of three based in San Diego, was 
transferred to Florida. But, in October, it was replaced by the carrier 
Independence. 
</P>
<P>
The only other notable arrival in recent months was the Aegis class cruiser 
Lake Champlain, Huebler said. 
</P>
<P>
"A few years ago we thought that we'd settle at about 100 ships, and we're 
evidently going to stay at 102 if we don't lose or gain anything else," Huebler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's military bases also were untouched by Congress' recent 
controversial decision to close more than 90 military bases around the United 
States, Huebler said. 
</P>
<P>
Home-porting and the base-closing campaign have "basically been a wash for us," 
Huebler said. "We didn't lose anything and, while it's possible that we could 
gain a ship or a new function, it's probably only a couple of hundred people 
that we're talking about." GREG JOHNSON

GAS-DETECTOR MANUFACTURER IS PICKING UP SOME STEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAUREEN FAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three months ago, Point Loma resident Bill Lange stuck a small rectangular 
badge, the size of a credit card, on his water heater closet. On New Year's 
Eve, it turned black. 
</P>
<P>
Lange credits the device, a carbon monoxide detector manufactured by a 
fledgling San Diego company, with saving his life and that of his wife and 
2-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
"Our condo project has been having terrific problems with our gas heaters. . . 
. I stuck the little Quantum Eye outside the gas heater, and, on New Year's 
Eve, I noticed it had turned black, which is an indication of a dangerous level 
of CO present. So I called (San Diego Gas &amp; Electric) and told them that I 
had detected carbon monoxide," Lange said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Black and Spewing Fumes 
</P>
<P>
"They sent somebody out, a repair man who gave the heater a visual inspection 
and determined that just by looking at it there was nothing wrong . . . but I 
insisted he continue to look. 
</P>
<P>
"He finally turned it off and opened it and looked in the back. Sure enough, 
the heater was black and spewing fumes and damaged to the point where he 
immediately condemned it." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Goldstein, president and founder of Quantum Group, says the Quantum Eye, 
and another carbon monoxide detector his company manufactures, which uses an 
alarm, are particularly helpful during the winter when heaters are in constant 
use. A reading from a detector can also be useful in convincing a repair worker 
to take a closer look at an appliance, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Goldstein said he considers the Quantum Eye, which sells for about $10, the 
only product of its kind in that price range. The company also makes a 
battery-powered carbon monoxide alarm called the Co-Star, which sells for $70. 
Other versions of the Co-Star run on electricity and hook into security or fire 
systems, and are designed for use in commercial, multistory buildings. They 
range in price from $80 to $250. 
</P>
<P>
The higher-priced Co-Stars have been approved by the American Gas Assn. and the 
$70 model is awaiting approval, Goldstein said. The association has no 
standards for approving non-electrical devices such as the Quantum Eye, he 
said, but added that the sensor in the Quantum Eye is the same as in the 
Co-Stars. 
</P>
<P>
Quantum Group started in 1982 with just three employees. Goldstein contacted 
two UC San Diego chemistry professors who had developed a warning device to 
detect carbon monoxide, an odorless, colorless gas that can cause dizziness, 
headaches and other flu-like symptoms, and, at higher levels, death. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Complex Chemical Mixture 
</P>
<P>
The scientists had developed a complex mixture of chemicals that changed color 
when exposed to the gas. The technology was licensed in 1983 to Quantum, which 
began improving the invention and turning it into a marketable device. 
</P>
<P>
"Carbon monoxide is responsible for substantial losses of life. It seemed 
surprising that, with all this modern technology, we still didn't have a way of 
protecting people from it," said Gerhard Schrauzer, one of the inventors. 
</P>
<P>
Now Quantum has 10 full-time employees plus a handful of part-timers. After 
years of research and product development, the firm began producing in bulk 
last January and sold about $6,000 worth that month. The company saw sales of 
$400,000 in 1988, $100,000 of that from product sales and the rest from 
research-and-development contracts. Goldstein said he expects sales this year 
to increase. 
</P>
<P>
Plant space on Sorrento Valley Road was doubled to 10,000 square feet in August 
to allow full-scale production of the Co-Star models. 
</P>
<P>
The company, not to be confused with a neighboring superconductor manufacturer 
called Quantum Design, also makes ventilation controls for underground parking 
garages, as well as gas appliance controls. 
</P>
<P>
Quantum's plans include developing by early 1990 a breath, rather than blood, 
test for carbon monoxide poisoning that can be used in a doctor's office. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gold Mine Expected 
</P>
<P>
"We expect that to be the real gold mine" because of the similarity between flu 
symptoms and carbon monoxide poisoning, Goldstein said. 
</P>
<P>
Goldstein has spent much of his career working with detection of carbon 
monoxide, radon and other gases. He served as a science adviser in the Ford 
Administration, heading a nuclear policy study within the National Science 
Foundation's science advisory office. His work there focused on the health 
risks from energy sources, including the dangers of radioactive waste and fuel 
emissions. 
</P>
<P>
Lange, the Point Loma resident who credited the product with saving the lives 
of him and his family, is the director of client services for Stoorza, Ziegaus 
&amp; Metzger, a public relations firm that counts Quantum as one of its 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
Others who sing the product's praises include Sheila Akin, 39, who said her 
husband was exposed to carbon monoxide two winters ago and had to be flown to a 
hospital for treatment in a hyperbaric chamber. After that, the Lakeside couple 
bought a Quantum Co-Star, which sounds an alarm when it detects dangerous 
levels of carbon monoxide. 
</P>
<P>
Then, last winter, Akin fell ill. "I thought I had had the flu for three weeks, 
then the alarm went off about the week between Christmas and New Year's, and we 
realized the reason I had been sick was carbon monoxide poisoning," she said. 
"I called Quantum, they sent some people out . . . and found out there was 
something wrong with the ventilation to the heater." 
</P>
<P>
Craig Pykles of Pykles Plumbing, Heating, Conditioning and True Value Hardware 
on University Avenue in East San Diego heard about the Quantum Eye on 
television news. Now he instructs his service technicians, who make at least 20 
calls a week, to offer the Quantum Eye to every customer whose gas appliance 
they service. About 50% of the customers take them up on the offer, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Pretty Useful, All Right' 
</P>
<P>
Pykles serviced a 30-year-old furnace for North Park resident Pauline Gilmore 
last year and sold her a Quantum Eye. Three months later she called Pykles to 
say the detector had turned darker. Pykles sent out a technician, who found the 
combustion chamber had cracked. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's probably pretty useful, all right," said the 75-year-old Gilmore. 
"If people pay attention to it, it could save your life." 
</P>
<P>
According to Dick Berry, gas services coordinator for SDG&amp;E: "I have no 
reason to believe it doesn't work and that it's not a good device. . . . It's 
undergone some testing, and it's been approved." 
</P>
<P>
A Vancouver-based firm, Newtec Industries, also makes carbon monoxide gas 
detectors; its least expensive model is a household unit that retails for $99.

 Mycogen, a San Diego manufacturer of biopesticides, reported a first-quarter 
net loss of $736,000 on revenue of $1.4 million, against a loss of $719,000 on 
revenue of $1.3 million over the corresponding three months ended Dec. 31 the

revenues were all derived from contract research and interest income. Mycogen's 
only product, its M-One biopesticide for the Colorado potato beetle, is sold 
only in the spring and summer, Vice President Andrew Barnes said Monday.

The Vietnamese government turned over to the United States remains believed to 
be those of 23 Americans killed in the Vietnam War, a U.S. Embassy spokesman 
said in Bangkok, Thailand. Ross Petzing said the remains are being flown to the 
U.S. Joint Casualty Resolution Center in Hawaii for identification. Currently, 
2,383 Americans are listed as missing in action in Indochina -- 1,747 in 
Vietnam, 547 in Laos, 83 in Cambodia and 6 in China. The latest repatriation 
comes a month after Vietnam turned over the remains of 38 individuals, the 
largest group since the war's end.

The body of a murder victim found two years and eight months ago in Idaho has 
been identified as that of a 25-year-old Monica Hibbs of San Jose, authorities 
said. A possible suspect -- someone Hibbs' parents knew their daughter to be 
traveling with when she disappeared -- is in jail on another charge in Northern 
California, officials said. The identity was not released. A truck driver found 
the body May 2, 1986. Franklin County Sheriff Don Beckstead said the body was 
nude and wrapped in three plastic bags. An autopsy revealed the victim had died 
from several knife wounds and had suffered a blow to the head. The body was 
buried as a "Jane Doe" when no leads about her identity turned up. "It has 
always made us feel good to observe that people have placed flowers on her 
grave, but we are greatly relieved to have her identity resolved," Beckstead 
said.

South Africa named a special envoy to Namibia and said it is willing to remove 
2,300 police officers from the territory as it prepares to grant independence 
to Africa's last colony. South Africa has ruled neighboring Namibia, also known 
as South-West Africa, for 74 years but has agreed to begin implementing a U.N. 
independence plan in April. South Africa has an estimated 50,000 soldiers in 
Namibia, but under the U.N. plan, the force is to be reduced to 1,500 by June. 
Willem Retief, South Africa's ambassador to West Germany, has been named 
special envoy to serve as a liaison between Namibia's current transitional 
government and the U.N. special representative to the territory.

Convicted spy Jonathan Jay Pollard, imprisoned at the Federal Penitentiary in 
Marion, Ill., began a five-day fast to protest the transfer of his wife, Anne, 
from a Danbury, Conn., hospital to a federal prison medical facility at 
Rochester, Minn., said Anne Pollard's father, Bernard Henderson. Pollard, 34, 
was sentenced in 1987 to life in prison after he was convicted of supplying 
classified U.S. documents to Israel. His wife, 28, was given a five-year 
sentence as an accessory. Anne Pollard collapsed Jan. 11 at a federal prison 
work camp at Danbury, her father said. She was taken to a hospital for 
treatment of a gastrointestinal disorder, he said. Henderson claimed his 
daughter was moved from the hospital Jan. 14 before treatments had been 
completed. A U.S. Bureau of Prisons spokesman said Pollard was moved "for 
medical reasons" and denied that she was being mistreated.

Tehama County Sheriff Mike Blanusa's son is wanted in connection with two 
murders and Blanusa says he would turn him in -- if he knew where he was. Rudy 
Mike Blanusa Jr., 35, was cited Sunday on Fox Network's "America's Most Wanted" 
program. He is wanted in the 1986 killings of brothers Gilbert Garza Flores, 
26, and Joe Garza Flores, 29, whose bodies were found near Modesto, 190 miles 
south of Red Bluff, the Tehama County seat. Sheriff Blanusa, 56, told a 
reporter: "I'm not a parent that says, 'My kid couldn't have done it.' " He 
said his son had not been a problem until he got a divorce.

A federal judge in San Francisco denied nearly every motion made by five 
defendants in a huge hashish-marijuana smuggling case and cleared the way for 
their trial to begin in April. Alleged ringleader Calvin Robinson and his 
co-defendants -- a son, stepson and two nephews -- will face trial nearly a 
year after they were arrested in the seizure of $189 million worth of hashish 
and marijuana. They allegedly used a tugboat and a barge to bring huge 
quantities of the drugs into the Bay Area from a "mother ship" anchored well 
offshore in the Pacific. Last May, a U.S. Customs Service investigation ended 
when the Coast Guard intercepted the tug and found the drugs hidden in secret 
compartments in the barge. U.S. District Judge John Vukasin, during a pretrial 
hearing at which details of jury selection were also to be discussed, denied 18 
pretrial motions.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in Anchorage announced a $2,500 reward for 
help in catching those responsible for recent killings of bald eagles. Federal 
wildlife agents have a dozen carcasses and believe many more of the big birds 
may have been gunned down in the unexplained rash of killings this winter, 
agency spokesman Bruce Batten said. The bald eagle, America's national symbol, 
is endangered or threatened everywhere except in Alaska.

The Soviet military stepped up emergency airlifts to the capital of Afghanistan 
to ease severe food shortages it blamed on hoarding and inefficiency by local 
authorities. Soviet officials said 400 to 500 tons of flour were arriving daily 
on a dozen flights from the Soviet cities of Tashkent and Fergana, both about 
an hour from the capital of Kabul by plane. Observers said the supplies had an 
immediate impact on the food shortage, which also was blamed partly on 
disruption of road supply convoys by Muslim guerrillas. It was unclear whether 
the Soviets would be able to mount food airlifts after their troops withdraw 
from Afghanistan by Feb. 15 as expected.

MAX LAEMMLE DIES AT 82; SHOWCASED FOREIGN FILMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Max Laemmle, who emigrated from Europe to the United States to start a small 
chain of American motion picture houses and then ironically made a success of 
them by showing European movies, died Friday of respiratory problems at his 
Beverly Hills home. 
</P>
<P>
He was 82 and a memorial is scheduled Wednesday at 11 a.m. at the University of 
Judaism. 
</P>
<P>
Laemmle, who last year observed the 50th anniversary of his first Los Angeles 
theater, was a cousin of "Uncle Carl" Laemmle, the founder of Universal 
Pictures. He was working for Carl Laemmle in Paris as head of the French 
division of the studio when he came to Los Angeles in 1938 with his brother, 
Kurt. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Began With 2 Theaters 
</P>
<P>
They began by leasing two small neighborhood theaters -- the Dale and the 
Franklin -- in Highland Park. Besides offering four features a week, the new 
owners gave away dishes and anything else they could to attract business during 
the Depression. 
</P>
<P>
When the war broke out they leased the Los Feliz, a theater that, like the Dale 
and Franklin, showed films several weeks after their debut. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Feliz and the Royal, another Laemmle house, for many years were the 
premier art houses of Los Angeles -- the theaters where the new cinema of 
Ingmar Bergman, Jean Luc-Godard and Francois Truffaut first became familiar to 
local moviegoers. 
</P>
<P>
The shift to these avant-garde features was not by choice, Max's son, Bob, 
recalled in an interview last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Television," he said "killed the Highland Park theaters." 
</P>
<P>
But such neo-realistic films as "Open City" and "The Bicycle Thief" whetted the 
appetites of a new generation of filmgoers -- war veterans who would never 
again be able to fantasize over Hollywood's gossamer as they had before; and 
their wives and children who had first seen Europe devastated in newsreels and 
now saw it again in the post-war films as a backdrop for characters struggling 
to recapture the common threads of their humanity. 
</P>
<P>
Max Laemmle organized a French film festival and persuaded the New Yorker's 
Pauline Kael to write the program notes. The Laemmles developed a loyal 
following and at one point had a mailing list of more than 6,000 people who 
were lured regularly to their theaters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
French Films, Opera 
</P>
<P>
French students and their teachers occupied the theaters on Wednesday mornings 
to view French films tailored to their needs. So did opera and Shakespeare 
enthusiasts, at other times when screens would have been blank. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years their family chain came to include the Music Hall, the Fine 
Arts, the Monica Fourplex, the Grande Fourplex, the Royal in West Los Angeles 
and the Town &amp; Country Triplex in Encino. There also will be five new 
Laemmle theaters when construction is completed on the site of the old Schwab 
drug store at Crescent Heights and Sunset Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
It was not all rosy, however; higher rents forced the Laemmles out of the Los 
Feliz where many of their classics had screened. 
</P>
<P>
But at a profit or loss, the Laemmles provided one basic service to the film 
industry: Most of the time their theaters were the first to screen the short 
subjects and documentaries being offered for Academy Award consideration. 
</P>
<P>
Max Laemmle's honors over the years included being made a chevalier de l'Ordre 
des Arts et des Lettres by the French government, a special achievement award 
from the L.A. Film Critics Assn. and the Community College of Jewish Studies 
Tikum Olam award. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his son and his brother, Laemmle is survived by his wife, Bobby, 
a daughter, Margaret Reisbaum, four grandchildren and a great-grandson.

STATE AWARDS $56,000 TO 2 WHO ACCUSED MITCHELSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED ROHRLICH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two women who claim they were sexually assaulted by Los Angeles divorce lawyer 
Marvin Mitchelson were awarded $56,000 for medical and psychiatric care Monday 
by the state crime victims compensation panel. 
</P>
<P>
The awards, made after determinations that the women were in fact crime 
victims, came despite earlier findings by prosecutors that there was not enough 
evidence to charge Mitchelson with the crimes. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County district attorney's office decided not to prosecute in 
early 1987. 
</P>
<P>
At the request of one of the victims, the California attorney general's office 
then looked into the case but decided not to intervene, concluding that the 
district attorney's decision not to prosecute was reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
In the midst of an ensuing, highly public effort by the victim to interest the 
Los Angeles County Grand Jury in investigating, Gilbert Garcetti, then chief 
deputy district attorney, said: "We're convinced, based on our investigation, 
that a crime did not occur." 
</P>
<P>
Austin Eaton, executive officer of the victims compensation panel, officially 
the state Board of Control, explained that the board's standard of proof is 
substantially less than that of prosecutors. Prosecutors, he said, have to be 
convinced that they can prove a case beyond a reasonable doubt. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to find a preponderance of the evidence," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The three-member board concluded that it had enough evidence after hearing 
about 20 minutes of testimony from the women, from a psychiatrist for one of 
them and from Los Angeles Police Detective Robert Kestler, who investigated the 
women's claims in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Kestler told the panel, meeting in Los Angeles, that he believed that the women 
-- former clients of Mitchelson -- were telling the truth when they said the 
lawyer sexually assaulted them. 
</P>
<P>
One of the assaults was alleged to have occurred in 1981, the other in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Gary Shepherd, the psychiatrist for one of the women, Kristin 
Barrett-Whitney, said he found the award "fascinating." 
</P>
<P>
"The district attorney won't prosecute, but the state will pay money, because 
they say a crime occurred," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Barrett-Whitney said the ruling gave her "a marvelous feeling of vindication." 
</P>
<P>
She was awarded up to $23,000 for psychiatric expenses related to the alleged 
assault, which she said took place in Mitchelson's Century City office, and up 
to $23,000 more for related medical expenses. 
</P>
<P>
The second victim, Patricia French, was awarded up to $10,000 for medical 
expenses, Eaton said. She could not be reached for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Control gave about $60 million last year to an estimated 25,000 
crime victims, Eaton said. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchelson, one of the nation's best-known attorneys, has steadfastly denied 
the allegations. He was not invited by the Board of Control to contest them. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not normal procedure to notify the alleged offender," Eaton said. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchelson could not be reached for comment Monday.

SYSTEM SUFFERS ANOTHER JOLT AS QUEEN OF ANGELS NEARS CLOSURE 
</P>

Los Angeles County will no longer be able to continue subsidizing private 
hospital emergency rooms that accept thousands of rescue ambulances each month 
because of the governor's recently announced fiscal policies, county Health 
Services Director Robert Gates said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Gates made the disclosure in an interview following a "summit" of 19 public 
officials who gathered downtown to voice grave concerns about the county's 
overloaded emergency services network. The network has been periodically 
crippled when key hospitals temporarily close their emergency rooms at once, 
triggering what paramedics call medical gridlock. County officials said the 
system may be devastated by the governor's newly proposed budget. 
</P>
<P>
Even as county Supervisor Ed Edelman called attention to the county's "very 
fragile" emergency services network, the system got another jolt. Queen of 
Angels Medical Center began refusing all new patients Monday in preparation for 
closing down its aging 404-bed facility overlooking the Hollywood Freeway and 
merging Friday with Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Queen of Angels had been considered a "key provider" of emergency care, 
receiving 400 rescue ambulance runs a month. The net effect of the merger, 
health officials pointed out, will be an overall reduction in the number of 
emergency beds available to paramedics responding to 911 distress calls. The 
tightening comes at a time when the county's emergency medical network has 
already been pushed to its limits on several occasions this month. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, about a dozen key private and public hospitals that accept 
hundreds of rescue ambulances each day have periodically been so full that they 
have all at once temporarily closed their emergency rooms to ambulance traffic. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concern Arose Last Year 
</P>
<P>
Last year, county supervisors became concerned that an irreparable blow would 
be dealt to the county's emergency services network if certain key hospitals 
were allowed to proceed with plans to permanently close their emergency rooms. 
The hospitals contended that they were losing too much money treating medically 
indigent patients that typically arrive by public ambulance. A crisis was 
headed off when the supervisors provided millions of dollars in bail-out funds 
to the hospitals and promised to continue those subsidies assuming that 
Proposition 99, the tobacco tax, passed. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 99 did pass, generating a profound but short-lived sigh of relief 
in health care circles. Additional revenue of about $650 million was projected 
from the tax, with much of the money expected to be used to reimburse hospitals 
and physicians for providing medical care to indigent patients who typically 
enter a hospital through its emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
But Supervisors Kenneth Hahn and Ed Edelman charged Monday that emergency 
services will not benefit in the least because the governor in his proposed 
budget has diverted the new revenue to purposes other than health care. 
</P>
<P>
"He's robbing the cigarette tax money and using it for general state purposes," 
Edelman said. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Gates said he informed hospital representatives on Friday that the 
county will no longer be able to continue to subsidize private hospital 
emergency rooms. "The fact is we don't have the money," Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
The only way to continue the subsidies would be for the Board of Supervisors to 
find an alternative funding source or for Gov. George Deukmejian or the 
Legislature to alter the budget. The board is to consider the matter at this 
morning's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Hahn, Gov. Deukmejian explained that his budget proposal 
attempts to balance a great assortment of needs and that he is pleased, 
overall, to have been able "to maintain and expand funding for local 
government." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian said that demands placed on the budget by Proposition 98, the school 
funding proposition requiring a commitment of more than $400 million to school 
and community colleges, means "it will be necessary for us to reduce funds for 
a number of local health-related programs." 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Gamble, president of the Hospital Council of Southern California, 
predicted that hospitals "right and left" will soon be reexaming whether they 
will let their emergency rooms remain open without subsidies to help defray the 
cost of treating medically indigent patients. 
</P>
<P>
The closure of one or two key emergency rooms, he said, could trigger mass 
closures, knocking out the whole network. 
</P>
<P>
"And once it (the system) is shut down," Gamble said, "it's murder to get it 
back up." 
</P>
<P>
Hahn declared, "There's a disastrous future unless we get this money." 
</P>
<P>
Private ambulance companies have provided the Hospital Council with a 
memorandum citing several recent cases that show "how transport times are being 
extended because of various (emergency room) closures" in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
They reported, for example, that on Jan. 15, paramedics were summoned to 
transport a patient from a nursing home to Glendale Memorial Hospital, which 
turned out to be closed to emergencies. The ambulance was then diverted to 
Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital, but within a few blocks of that hospital the 
dispatcher notified the driver that Hollywood was also closed, and the 
ambulance was redirected back to Glendale Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday, paramedics were dispatched to a board and care home to transport 
a patient to Brotman Medical Center. En route, the driver called Brotman, only 
to learn that the emergency room was closed. He called two other hospitals, 
which were both closed, before finally transporting the patient to Daniel 
Freeman Hospital.

JAILHOUSE INFORMANT ARRESTED IN RAID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Veteran jailhouse informant Leslie Vernon White, who last week failed to appear 
for sentencing in a purse-snatching case, has been arrested during a drug raid 
on a downtown Los Angeles motel where he was staying, one of White's attorneys 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
White told his lawyers that he missed his court appearance last Thursday 
because he had been beaten by unidentified gang members who had marked him as a 
"snitch," said Mark Geragos, who represents White. "He said he was hiding 
because he was afraid for his life," Geragos said. 
</P>
<P>
White, whose $10,000 bail in the purse-snatching case was forfeited after he 
failed to appear, was arrested Saturday on a no-bail warrant. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, White prompted a major investigation of Los Angeles County criminal 
cases in which informants have testified after he demonstrated to authorities 
that he could, through various ruses, convincingly fabricate a murder 
confession from an inmate he had never met. 
</P>
<P>
Geragos said White will appear in Los Angeles Superior Court on Wednesday to be 
sentenced for the purse-snatching. "He's not going anywhere now," the lawyer 
said.

OFFICERS, BACKERS PICKET NBC STUDIOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 300 Long Beach police officers and their supporters picketed Monday 
in front of NBC Studios in Burbank to protest the network's participation in a 
"sting" operation that videotaped the arrest of a black activist by a white 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
The off-duty officers marched peacefully for about an hour "to bring to the 
public's attention that the police were victims in this and the job of media is 
to report the news and not make it," said Mike Tracy, president of the Long 
Beach Police Officers Assn., which staged the demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
A crew from NBC's "Today Show" videotaped the Jan. 14 incident in which Long 
Beach Police Officer Mark Dickey appeared to thrust the head of Don Jackson, a 
Hawthorne police sergeant on administrative leave, through the plate-glass 
window of a motorcycle parts shop. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson said he has has conducted a series of "stings" to test how police 
around Los Angeles treat minorities. 
</P>
<P>
In picketing NBC, the police officers also protested NBC's refusal to release 
its unedited tape of the incident.

ARSON SUSPECTED IN CHURCH BLAZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A possible arson fire erupted in a Los Angeles church, causing $750,000 in 
damage before firefighters were able to douse it an hour later. 
</P>
<P>
About 60 firefighters from 14 engine companies battled the Thursday fire at the 
the Eternal Hope Baptist Church at 1910 W. 48th St., city Fire Department 
spokesman Jim Williamson said. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the fire was under investigation, Williamson said, but 
firefighters believe an incendiary device helped the blaze spread through the 
church. There were no injuries.

REMAINS OF 76-YEAR-OLD HOLLYWOOD PILOT FOUND IN WRECKAGE ON ANACAPA ISLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John F. Thomson was to turn 77 years old this month, but even at his age, the 
Hollywood resident never gave any thought to giving up his favorite pastime: 
flying. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Thomson, a professional photographer, was in the process of upgrading 
his credentials to a commercial pilot's license when the single-engine plane he 
was flying solo was reported missing earlier this month, his daughter recalled 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"He thought it would be a kick," Anita Thomson said. "And he wanted to become 
better qualified to do aerial photography." 
</P>
<P>
Thomson's Cessna 172 was reported missing Jan. 5 after he failed to arrive at 
Santa Monica Airport from Watsonville during stormy weather. The wreckage was 
discovered late last week in a wildlife preserve on west Anacapa Island, and on 
Monday the Ventura County medical examiner confirmed that the lean, athletic 
septuagenarian had died in the accident. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have to go I guess he was doing what he liked to do," said E. Bruce 
Howell, an associate at Thomson's Hollywood photo studio. "He wasn't the kind 
of person who would want to end up in a rocking chair and be unable to carry 
his heavy photo equipment." 
</P>
<P>
Federal flying rules do not prohibit medically fit pilots from retaining their 
air licenses, regardless of age. According to other pilots at Santa Monica 
Airport, several contemporaries of Thomson still fly single-engine planes out 
of Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Thomson, who was flying home after visiting a friend in Northern California, 
had been a pilot for three decades and was no stranger to long, grueling 
flights, friends said. 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, he and his wife Jann, who died last year, flew a single-engine 
plane to Upstate New York with a second couple, Roger and Nancy Bowman. After 
leaving the Bowmans off -- and going water skiing -- Thomson proceeded to fly 
to Newfoundland. 
</P>
<P>
"He loved to fly into remote areas -- he kept in good shape," said Bowman, 
president of the Air Spacers Flying Club, based at Santa Monica Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Thomson, past president of the club, also had once flown to Alaska and crossed 
the Arctic Circle, friends said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was real hard to think of him as elderly -- he was old but he sure wasn't 
elderly," said Rol Murrow, president of the Santa Monica Airport Assn. "He was 
alert as most 20-year-olds, if not more so." 
</P>
<P>
Thomson, who operated American Photo on Melrose Avenue, was in a rented Air 
Spacers plane when he was reported missing. 
</P>
<P>
An 11-day Civil Air Patrol search ensued, covering 13,650 square miles on 
several 300-mile trips between Watsonville and Santa Monica. But the searchers 
did not fly over Anacapa, which is well outside the normal route. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, federal authorities said they were still investigating and had no 
idea why Thomson crashed into Anacapa. Pilot friends of Thomson theorized that 
he may have flown along the California coast past Santa Barbara and because of 
foul weather did not see the steep cliffs of Anacapa, 15 miles offshore. 
</P>
<P>
The plane's wreckage was spotted last Thursday by a passing pilot, according to 
Cindy Nielson, a spokeswoman for Channel Islands National Park. Authorities are 
seeking to remove the wreckage by helicopter as quickly as possible because it 
is strewn in a remote nesting habitat for the endangered California brown 
pelican. 
</P>
<P>
Thomson, born in New York City on Jan. 11, 1912, moved to Hollywood with his 
parents in 1919. 
</P>
<P>
His father, Bing, was a stage and film director, and Thomson himself worked 
briefly as an actor, including a part in a silent movie version of Heidi, 
according to his family. The Hollywood High School graduate went on to work in 
a 20th Century Fox photography darkroom before eventually opening his own shop. 
</P>
<P>
Thomson leaves two daughters, Anita, of Berkeley, and Sandy, of Hollywood, and 
a granddaughter, Pira Kelly, of Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
His ashes will be scattered at sea.

MAN BEHIND STING OPERATIONS FOR ZZZZ BEST GIVEN 5-YEAR SENTENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM MURPHY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man who helped ZZZZ Best Carpet Cleaning Co. set up an elaborate series of 
sting operations to dupe investors into giving the company millions of dollars 
in bank loans and stock offerings was sentenced Monday to five years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Roddy, who helped set up tours of phony job sites to make it appear that 
ZZZZ Best was earning huge revenues from restoration work, was also ordered to 
serve five years' probation at the end of his term. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian handed down the sentence after federal 
prosecutors urged him not to give Roddy leniency simply because of his claim 
that he is a religious man. 
</P>
<P>
ZZZZ Best founder Barry Minkow, 22, convicted as the architect of a massive 
fraud that may have totaled as much as $70 million, is now leading a Bible 
study group, dubbed "Barry's Boys," in the downtown federal prison where he 
awaits sentencing Feb. 21, prosecutors told the judge. 
</P>
<P>
"He has readings where he gets up on a couple of stairs, and he reads from the 
Bible and gives a little sermon," said Assistant U.S. Atty. James Asperger. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said Roddy, who posed as the owner of a company that was supposedly 
handling ZZZZ Best's fraudulent insurance restoration contracts, took care of 
minute details at the makeshift job sites to convince accountants and lawyers 
that the jobs were real. 
</P>
<P>
In an instance that Assistant U.S. Atty. Gordon Greenberg called "the height of 
intelligence and shrewdness, at least for a criminal mind," Roddy bribed a 
guard at a Sacramento office building to greet Roddy and another ZZZZ Best 
official by name as they entered the building with the accountants for the tour 
of a floor that ZZZZ Best was supposedly rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
But Roddy's attorney said his client was merely a "glorified gofer" who had 
arranged the tours but who never made much money off the ZZZZ Best fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Because he is albino, defense lawyer Cornell Price said, Roddy felt a sense of 
belonging at ZZZZ Best that he had never experienced before. 
</P>
<P>
"What you have here is a fellow who's been kind of an outcast all of his life. 
. . . All of a sudden he was going to belong to something that was significant, 
that was going to make him feel significant," Price said. 
</P>
<P>
Roddy himself admitted he should have backed out of ZZZZ Best once he learned 
that the restoration jobs were phony.But he told Tevrizian that he always 
believed that ZZZZ Best would be able to end the fraud and go legitimate. "I 
thought somehow we would pull the thing together."

YOUR BODY: FLU BUG'S BITING L.A. KIDS ESPECIALLY HARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Children have been especially hard hit by an influenza virus that appears to be 
on the increase in Southern California, according to several local 
pediatricians. 
</P>
<P>
The federal Centers for Disease Control reported last week that Type B 
influenza has been identified in California and 22 other states. In confirmed 
cases, 56% of sufferers were age 18 or younger, a CDC spokesman said. "Compared 
to previous years, there seems to be a lot morechildren with flu this year," 
confirmed Dr. Susan Igdaloff, a North Hollywood pediatrician who has treated 
about 50 children for flu-like symptoms in the last two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, children with the flu will run a fever of 102-104 degrees F. for 
four to six days, said Dr. William Singer, an Encino pediatrician and USC 
clinical professor of pediatrics. And the fever can come and go. In many flu 
patients, "there is fever for two or three days, then no fever, then two or 
three days of fever again," Singer said. Also common are aches and pains, cough 
and sore throat. Vomiting and diarrhea are usually minimal, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
"Parents often get hung up on the thermometer numbers," Singer said, explaining 
that "fever is a protective mechanism and will disappear when the infection is 
over." 
</P>
<P>
To speed recovery, give children plenty of fluids and encourage bed rest or 
quiet play, Igdaloff advised. 
</P>
<P>
Singer suggests giving acetaminophen for fever, not aspirin, which has been 
linked to Reye's syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
If a child seems really sick, if fever lasts more than three or four days, or 
if other potentially serious symptoms -- such as a continual stiff neck -- are 
present, seek medical attention, doctors say. 
</P>
<P>
That Takeover Feeling 
</P>
<P>
Your company's just been acquired by a corporate giant. Or internal 
reorganization has sent your boss to another department. 
</P>
<P>
Either scenario can leave a worker feeling as psychologically distressed as a 
jilted lover, said Michael Mercer, a Highland Park, Ill., industrial 
psychologist who specializes in working with such employees. 
</P>
<P>
"When people ask me how employees feel during a takeover, I ask them to imagine 
how they would feel if their lover or spouse had an affair and left them," 
Mercer said. "That is how people feel during a friendly takeover." During an 
unfriendly takeover, he added, workers can feel much worse. 
</P>
<P>
Panic and a crisis mentality are other common psychological side effects, he 
finds. "From a psychological point of view, mergers and reorganizations are 
similar," he said. "People feel flabbergasted. With breathtaking speed, their 
jobs, finances, identities, careers and life styles go up for grabs." 
</P>
<P>
Uncertainty is almost universal among workers in merged or reorganized firms, 
added Mitchell Marks, a Los Angeles organizational psychologist. "The common 
first reaction is, 'Will I survive?' " He tells employees that it's natural and 
OK to worry. After the initial shock wears off, he added, "People may leave 
physically. Or they may leave psychologically." 
</P>
<P>
Action can quell anxiety, Mercer and Marks agreed. "Realize the rumor mill is 
the 'worst-case scenario,' and don't rely on it for all your information," 
Marks advised. "Collect data on your own." In a merger situation, talk to 
people who work for the other company, he said. "Make an appointment to meet 
your new boss. Don't assume the new boss knows anything accurate about you." 
</P>
<P>
"The first rule is to take care of yourself," Mercer said. "Put out feelers for 
new jobs. Past performance may not mean that much. But meanwhile, act like a 
team player." And don't bury your sense of humor, he added. "Humor and jokes 
are good ways to relieve anxiety." Among his favorites: "If my boss calls, 
would you get his name?" 
</P>
<P>
Antibiotic Antipathy 
</P>
<P>
Due to inconvenience, cost or side effects such as abdominal cramping, many 
patients don't take the full course of antibiotics often prescribed for such 
ailments as ear or urinary tract infections, finds Ed Thompson, a Los Angeles 
pharmacist. 
</P>
<P>
"Much research has focused on which antibiotic to use and how long to use each 
one," he said. "For patients to decide on their own that they don't need (the 
medicine) anymore is folly." 
</P>
<P>
"It's important you take the full course of therapy to be sure you've cleared 
away all the infection," added Cynthia Hespe, vice president of education for 
the California Pharmacists Assn. in Sacramento. "Even though you feel better, 
the infection may not be gone entirely." 
</P>
<P>
Other advice about antibiotics: If it's prescribed to be taken on an empty 
stomach, "that means one hour before or two hours after a meal," Thompson said. 
Take medicine at intervals prescribed, Hespe added. "Three a day means three a 
day."

KINGS SEND CARPENTER TO BRUINS TO GET KASPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GORDON EDES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
General Manager Rogie Vachon, acting like a man who believes the Kings have a 
shot at winning the Stanley Cup this spring -- a laughable notion in the 
pre-Gretzky era -- made another deal Monday, sending forward Bobby Carpenter to 
the Boston Bruins for center Steve Kasper. 
</P>
<P>
In trading Carpenter, Vachon gave up the player who cost the Kings center 
Marcel Dionne 2 years ago but never regained his scoring touch, even with the 
advantage of playing left wing with Wayne Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
In Kasper, 27, the Kings are getting a player once voted the top defensive 
forward in the National Hockey League, a reputation earned in great measure by 
his skill in shadowing Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting ready," Vachon said, looking forward to the playoffs. "Our team 
has been giving up too many goals, and we have to adjust defensively to go into 
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"Steve Kasper is the type of guy we needed," Vachon added. "He is one of the 
best defensive forwards in the league, and he is an outstanding penalty killer. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to really start thinking defensive hockey. There are some teams, 
you're not going to get too many good scoring chances. That's when you have to 
play a grinding game and wait for your chances. We haven't been doing that 
consistently, which is one of our problems." 
</P>
<P>
Kasper became the second Bruin-turned-King in 3 days. Late Saturday night, 
Vachon -- looking for more muscle -- obtained wing Jay Miller for future 
considerations, which at the time figured to be a mid-round draft choice. The 
Carpenter-Kasper deal wipes out any further compensation by the Kings for 
Miller. 
</P>
<P>
The timing of Monday's trade was curious, because Carpenter has not played 
since Dec. 31, when he broke a bone in his right hand, affecting his thumb. But 
the injury-wracked Bruins, Stanley Cup finalists last spring but 3 games below 
.500 this season, decided after consecutive weekend defeats by Buffalo to make 
the deal. 
</P>
<P>
"It might look like a bit of a shot," Boston General Manager Harry Sinden said, 
"but it's not easy to go out and deal for a goal-scorer. Hopefully, we'll get 
him scoring again." 
</P>
<P>
Sinden said that Carpenter, who was scheduled to be examined by a doctor in Los 
Angeles today, thought he could have his cast removed and be ready to play in a 
week to 10 days. One King official, however, estimated that it could be closer 
to a month before Carpenter returns. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter, the first American player ever to make the jump from high school to 
the NHL, scored 53 goals for the Washington Capitals in 1984-85, the first 
American to score 50 or more. He was 22 years old. 
</P>
<P>
Now, after a brief stint -- 28 games -- with the New York Rangers and 120 games 
with the Kings, Carpenter will be playing for his fourth team before his 26th 
birthday. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm reading nothing into that," Sinden said. "I've learned not to read 
something into situations like that. If I'd believed what was out there at the 
time we traded for Rick Middleton, I would have been 100% wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Middleton, who retired last season, was a journeyman forward who blossomed into 
a 50-goal scorer with the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter had only 11 goals and 15 assists in 39 games this season. After 
scoring 145 goals in his first 4 seasons, all with Washington, Carpenter's 
totals read: 27, 9, 19 and 11. 
</P>
<P>
Sinden is hoping that a return to the Boston area, where Carpenter was a prep 
star, will help to revive his game. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought he was playing pretty damn good until he got hurt," Sinden said. 
"I've always followed his career, but in those last couple of weeks I noticed a 
change in his play. A little more intensity, a little more drive." 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter came to the Kings on March 10, 1987, from the New York Rangers, along 
with defenseman Tom Laidlaw, for Dionne, Jeff Crossman and the Kings' 
third-round pick in this year's draft. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a case where we weren't really dissatisfied with him," Vachon said. "He 
worked really hard in the time he was here. We were just expecting a little 
more offense from him." 
</P>
<P>
Coach Robbie Ftorek, who said that Carpenter reported to camp in great shape 
last fall, moved him from center to left wing to give him a chance to play with 
Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
Guaranteed goals? Not for everyone, Ftorek said. 
</P>
<P>
"Bobby worked so hard this year -- I thought his defensive game improved 
immensely," Ftorek said. 
</P>
<P>
"But with Wayne, you've got to relax and play, don't be intimidated. Some 
players become intimidated a little bit, at least subconsciously. . . . It's a 
difficult position to be put into." 
</P>
<P>
That difficulty wears off, Ftorek said, once you start scoring goals and 
recognize when to take your shot and when to make a play. Carpenter, however, 
never got going. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't shoot the puck as much as we would have liked him to shoot it," 
Ftorek said. "He's got a great shot. 
</P>
<P>
"Bobby has so much talent, I feel confident in him. I know he was coming 
around. He's going home now, and the shorter rink (at Boston Garden) with his 
quickness should help him." 
</P>
<P>
Vachon said he has been after Kasper for 3 years. In 1982, Kasper won the Selke 
Award as best defensive forward. As a rookie, he followed Gretzky everywhere so 
closely that after a game at Edmonton, when Kasper failed to show up on the 
team bus and Coach Gerry Cheevers wondered where he was, another player said: 
"He followed Gretzky home." 
</P>
<P>
Kasper, who is 5-foot-8 and 170 pounds, has 10 goals and 16 assists in 49 
games. Last season was his best offensively, with 26 goals and 44 assists. 
Besides being a strong penalty killer, he is regarded an excellent faceoff 
player. 
</P>
<P>
"There was never a time he put on the Bruins' uniform when he didn't play all 
out," Sinden said. "Never." 
</P>
<P>
Kasper is expected to join the Kings in time for tonight's game against the 
Washington Capitals. 
</P>
<P>
"The way it looks, the Bruins are going nowhere right now in a hurry," Kasper 
said Monday. "Now I'm going to a team that seems to be making a real run at 
things. 
</P>
<P>
"They're certainly not just the Wayne Gretzky show. His coming to L.A. has made 
other guys believe they can do it, too. Guys like (Bernie) Nicholls and (Luc) 
Robitaille. 
</P>
<P>
"(Mike) Krushelnyski and (Marty) McSorley have been there before, and from 
everything I read, (John) Tonelli has been playing like a kid."

<P>
TODD FOSTER'S HOMETOWN IN MONTANA IS DECKED OUT FOR HIS PRO BOXING DEBUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
GREAT FALLS, Mont. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When last seen by reporters, Todd Foster had tears running down his face, and 
was being embraced by his girlfriend, his parents, and his brother and sister 
in a hallway of the Chamshil Students' Gymnasium at Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
That was last September, on the night the boxer from Great Falls had been 
beaten in the quarterfinals of the Olympic Games boxing tournament. He had just 
broken down in a news conference and left the room, crying. 
</P>
<P>
Foster, 21, returned to Great Falls without a medal but with his popularity 
intact. When he came home, 300 cheering people waving placards greeted him at 
the airport. A band played. They even held a parade for him. 
</P>
<P>
The Great Falls Tribune published a "Todd Foster Commemorative Edition," for 
which 130 local firms bought ads. All this, for a guy who didn't even win a 
medal. 
</P>
<P>
They love him here. For one thing, he says all the right things about Great 
Falls -- "It's the greatest city in the world." And having a face that could 
have been in a Norman Rockwell painting doesn't hurt, either. 
</P>
<P>
This week, though, folks here are a little worried. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Foster turns pro tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Before what is supposed to be a full house of 5,000 Foster faithful at the Four 
Seasons Arena, they're throwing him in with a guy known as The Gangster. 
</P>
<P>
This is his reward? 
</P>
<P>
The way folks here see it, traveling all over the Rocky Mountain states to 
tournaments in the Great Falls Amateur Boxing Club van was one thing. That was 
when all the moms had bake sales to pay for the gas. That was for fun. But 
this? The Gangster? 
</P>
<P>
Is it too late to call this off, Todd? 
</P>
<P>
No, Foster is going through with this. And he says he's not afraid of The 
Gangster, who looks as if he lost a half-dozen knife fights. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Chris Alvarado, 24, from Phoenix, nearly bled to death in a 1984 auto 
accident. One scar runs across his throat, another nearly encircles his right 
eye. So, his boxing management group thought it would be cute to call him The 
Gangster. 
</P>
<P>
So he's not really a gangster. But he's not a tomato can, either. 
</P>
<P>
He's 13-4 and has gone 10 rounds 4 times. Foster, who has never gone more than 
amateur boxing's 3-round distance, will go 6 tonight in a lightweight bout on a 
card to be televised by ESPN. The main event features Frank Tate, former 
International Boxing Federation middleweight champion, against Jimmy Bills. 
</P>
<P>
"Todd's going to school Tuesday," said his manager, Bob Spagnola. "Todd's a 
very talented boxer and fighting tomato cans would do nothing for his 
development as a pro. We want him to meet tough opponents, we want him to 
learn." 
</P>
<P>
Said Foster: "I told them when I started training 2 months ago for my first 
(pro) bout that I didn't want some 3-3 guy. I wanted to meet good fighters." 
</P>
<P>
Still, uneasiness reigns here. Great Falls folks didn't even much like the idea 
of Todd's moving to Houston, to train at the Houston Boxing Assn. gym under 
Kenny Weldon. Not enough good sparring partners in Great Falls, Todd explained. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's that Lou Duva business. A lawsuit already, and he hasn't even had 
a pro bout yet! None of this would have happened if he had been training for 
the state regionals at Helena instead of the pros. 
</P>
<P>
In the summer of 1987, while still an amateur, Foster apparently signed some 
kind of pro contract with New Jersey trainer Lou Duva's Main Events group. 
Then, after the Olympics, Foster told Duva he was going pro with the Spagnola 
group of Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Duva sued Spagnola, demanding a return of the $50,000 he said he had spent on 
Foster when he was his sponsor during Foster's amateur period. 
</P>
<P>
Spagnola says Duva compromised Foster's eligibility for the Olympics by 
coercing him into signing a contract when he was an amateur. 
</P>
<P>
Duva says the contract was approved and signed by Col. Don Hull, who was then 
president of the USA Amateur Boxing Federation. 
</P>
<P>
"My father spent $50,000 on Todd Foster, including paying Kenny Weldon $300 a 
week to train him," said Dan Duva of Main Events. "Everything was cleared by 
the USA/ABF. It was a valid agreement. But I think at this point if Todd paid 
back the $50,000, that would be the end of it." 
</P>
<P>
Spagnola won't say how much Foster is to make tonight, but says it isn't 
anything like $50,000. He said that Foster would make about $100,000 his first 
year as a pro, under a promotional arrangement with the Houston Boxing Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, Foster is perceived as a valuable property. He's a puncher, and 
punchers are penalized by amateur boxing's rules, which favor the boxer of 
movement and left jabs. 
</P>
<P>
Foster said: "As a pro, I'll be able to get in there and really throw some 
punches instead of having a referee stop me every 5 seconds, telling me I can't 
do something," 
</P>
<P>
Spagnola says the plan is for Foster to crack the top 10 rankings at 
lightweight or junior welterweight in 2 years. 
</P>
<P>
Weldon, who made the jump to Spagnola with Foster, says Foster is a complete 
package. 
</P>
<P>
"Todd's really going to do well," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Remember, he's coming down from 10 ounce gloves to 8 ounces. For a 
lightweight, that's a big difference. He's got great legs. They're probably his 
best attribute. He's fluid in there, getting into punching position so 
effortlessly, and it's because of his legs. 
</P>
<P>
"He also listens and learns well. People think of him as a short-armed guy, but 
he's really got a good left jab. He already knows how to set people up." 
</P>
<P>
Weldon also mentioned two faults, a breathing problem and weight distribution. 
</P>
<P>
To correct the breathing problem, Foster had a deviated septum corrected right 
after the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
"Todd's breathing normally now through his nose, but he breathed through his 
mouth for 5 years as an amateur, and he has trouble breaking the habit," Weldon 
said. "I'm a little worried about it, because with 8-ounce gloves now he could 
get a broken jaw." 
</P>
<P>
And the other fault? The weight distribution? 
</P>
<P>
"He has a tendency to lean to his left, away from his center of gravity," 
Weldon said. "We've worked a lot on keeping his upper body over his feet, and 
he's improved a lot. He's ready." 
</P>
<P>
He may be ready for prime time, but is he ready for color TV? 
</P>
<P>
Foster was a member of amateur boxing's all-bleeder team. One tap on Foster's 
nose and you wanted to check the other guy for a razor. 
</P>
<P>
"I had that problem because I had an infection in my nose for a long time," he 
said. "I finally got that cleared up with antibiotics. The deviated septum had 
nothing to do with the bleeding. The inside of my nose was too dry and it 
didn't take many punches to start it bleeding, especially if I was boxing in an 
air-conditioned building." 
</P>
<P>
Once, Foster was primarily known as a football star in this town, at Charles M. 
Russell High. And basketball and baseball, too. He started at second base for a 
senior Little League team when he was 13. 
</P>
<P>
His dad saw all this coming. 
</P>
<P>
"Vicki (Todd's mom) and I went to a PTA meeting when Todd was 5, and the PE 
teacher came up to me," recalled Vern Foster, 41. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me he'd lined all the little kids up on a basketball court and had 
them dribble from one end of the court to the other, once left-handed, and once 
right-handed. He said Todd was the only little kid who could do it." 
</P>
<P>
When Todd was 8, his father, as a lark, entered him in a peewee boxing 
tournament. He not only won, but beat the defending Montana champion. 
</P>
<P>
Foster made his final commitment to boxing before what was to have been his 
senior football season. Foster was a returning all-league defensive back at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"The coach told me I was going to have to decide between football and boxing, 
and I said, 'So long, coach,' " Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
Vern Foster is a lineman for Montana Light and Power. A month ago, during a 
heavy storm, a shopping mall lost its power. In 39-degree temperatures, he was 
45 feet up in the air, putting up new lines. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Foster figures he has the talent that will one day put him in 
million-dollar casino championship fights, that he will earn enough money to 
get his dad down off those power poles. But of course, The Gangster will have 
something to say about that.

SAN JOSE ST. WILL HONOR SCHOLARSHIPS OF 10 BOYCOTTING BASKETBALL PLAYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
San Jose State will continue to honor the scholarships of the 10 basketball 
players who are boycotting the team, Athletic Director Randy Hoffman said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt a sense of commitment to these men, and we wanted to fulfill that 
commitment from our end," Hoffman said. "Secondly, some of them . . . aren't in 
the greatest financial shape, and I didn't want to do anything that might 
impact their ability to complete their college educations." 
</P>
<P>
The threat of a lawsuit by the players was not a factor in the decision, 
Hoffman said. 
</P>
<P>
"Under (National Collegiate Athletic Assn.) rules it was clearly our 
prerogative," Hoffman said. 
</P>
<P>
NCAA rules provide that if a player leaves the team voluntarily, aid may be 
withdrawn at the end of the current semester. San Jose State's spring semester 
begins Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The players walked out on Coach Bill Berry last week, accusing him of verbal 
abuse and vowing not to play again until he is fired or resigns. The school 
repeatedly has backed Berry, and last Thursday it fielded a team that included 
the four remaining players, four football players, a team manager and three 
other walk-ons for a game won by Cal State Fullerton, 82-60. 
</P>
<P>
None of the boycotting players has sought to return to the team, Hoffman said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (Berry) is still holding out hope, as well as myself, that some 
players might reconsider," Hoffman said. "But there's going to be a time frame 
where we have to make a final decision." ROBYN NORWOOD

MCENROE, LENDL TO MEET AGAIN IN QUARTERFINALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
MELBOURNE, Australia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the end of his match with Aaron Krickstein, John McEnroe raised both arms, 
did a 360-degree turn to the cheers of a sellout crowd at the Australian Open 
and walked off the court amid loud applause. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe will be back Wednesday to play an old rival in the quarterfinals of the 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
On center court, beneath the hot summer sun, McEnroe will run up against Ivan 
Lendl, with the winner advancing to the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe, who played his best match of the tournament Tuesday when he defeated 
Krickstein, 7-6, 6-2, 6-3, said he is right where he wants to be. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm reasonably confident I will play well," McEnroe said. "The question is how 
well. 
</P>
<P>
"The opportunity is there. I'm more interested in winning the tournament than 
beating Lendl, but obviously, it's a big obstacle to beat him." 
</P>
<P>
Lendl, the highest-seeded man remaining in the tournament, struggled early in 
his match against Amos Mansdorf of Israel but still won in straight sets, 7-6, 
6-4, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
All of the men's singles quarterfinals will be played Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Stefan Edberg, who defeated Cash after literally being flat on his back, will 
play Austrian Thomas Muster. Jonas Svensson, conqueror of Boris Becker, will 
meet unseeded Jan Gunnarsson, and Miloslav Mecir of Czechoslovakia will face 
17-year-old qualifier Goran Ivanisevic of Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg, who defeated Cash, 6-4, 6-0, 6-2, was 2 points away from a routine 
victory when something unexpected happened. Edberg suffered an apparent muscle 
spasm in his back at 30-15 in the final game and took a 3-minute injury break. 
</P>
<P>
After a trainer treated his lower back muscles with a freezing spray, Edberg 
lay down on the court. When he got up, he served an ace. Two points later, 
Edberg had defeated Cash, who was not distracted by Edberg but perhaps by 
something else. 
</P>
<P>
There were rumors that Cash's girlfriend, Anna Britt, had left him. There were 
other rumors that he was sick. 
</P>
<P>
The real reason? 
</P>
<P>
"None of your business," Cash said. 
</P>
<P>
He certainly didn't play as though he felt well. During changeovers, Cash 
buried his head in a towel. He performed listlessly, making only 38% of his 
first serves and committing 11 double faults and 21 unforced errors. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt good enough to get out there," Cash said. "I thought to myself, 'If I 
can get out there on the court, he might break a leg or something.' " 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Edberg hurt his back. The extent of his injury is unknown, and there 
is some question whether Edberg will be able to play Muster as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl said he had difficulty with his timing in the first set against Mansdorf 
but was satisfied with the result. Like McEnroe, he is looking forward to 
another meeting in their 11-year series. 
</P>
<P>
"He has so much talent," Lendl said of McEnroe. "Hopefully, you can step right 
into his face from the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
Although the series has been virtually even, Lendl has won the last three times 
-- straight-set victories in the 1985 and 1987 U.S. Open and a 4-set triumph in 
last year's French Open. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl pointed to two victories over McEnroe in particular -- the 1984 French 
Open, when he came from 2 sets down to win, and the 1985 U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
"The '84 French, that turned my career around," Lendl said. "At the (U.S.) 
Open, I became No. 1." 
</P>
<P>
Krickstein wanted to start off quickly against McEnroe but lost the first set 
in a tiebreaker, 7-4. 
</P>
<P>
A service return that sailed wide, a forehand volley into the net and a 
forehand volley winner by McEnroe, and that was that for Krickstein. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have had a good chance if I had won the first set because, like him, I 
play better when I'm ahead," Krickstein said. "We're both confidence players." 
</P>
<P>
As for McEnroe's hopes against Lendl, Krickstein said McEnroe has a chance. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes his serve doesn't look quite as hard, maybe he's not as quick on his 
feet, but he can still hit some good shots and hit some big points at the right 
time." 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe is reveling in his newfound role as the people's choice, even though he 
is not too pleased about playing consecutive matches. 
</P>
<P>
"At this stage of my career, having the fans behind me is a positive feeling," 
he said. "After all these years of having the crowd against me and the 
pressures of being No. 1, the underdog role is a good opportunity for me." 
</P>
<P>
Steffi Graf powered her way into the women's semifinals with another convincing 
victory, 6-2, 6-3, over another West German, Claudia Kohde-Kilsch. 
</P>
<P>
Graf, the top-seeded player, will meet No. 3-seeded Gabriela Sabatini, who 
survived her quarterfinal match with Zina Garrison to win, 6-4, 2-6, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Garrison was serving to go up, 4-1, in the third but lost that game and the 
next 4. Garrison held serve in the ninth game, but Sabatini won on her service, 
Garrison netting a backhand on match point. 
</P>
<P>
Unseeded New Zealander Belinda Cordwell, filling the void left by the exit of 
fourth-seeded Pam Shriver, got past Catarina Lindqvist of Sweden, 6-2, 2-6, 
6-1, to reach the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
It may be something of a surprise for Cordwell, ranked No. 62 in the world, to 
get this far, but she doesn't feel that way. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in fairly respectable company, but I'm playing well, so I deserve to be 
there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Cordwell will play the winner of Tuesday night's match between second-seeded 
Martina Navratilova and fifth-seeded Helena Sukova.

UPSETS HELP TO CLEAR PATH TO FINAL FOR MECIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
MELBOURNE, Australia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With Mats Wilander the first to go, followed Monday by Boris Becker, the road 
to the Australian Open men's singles final might have been cleared for Miloslav 
Mecir. 
</P>
<P>
The sleepy-looking Mecir, whose only other Grand Slam final appearance was the 
1986 U.S. Open, in which he lost to Ivan Lendl, started strong and got stronger 
Monday night in the fourth round with a 6-4, 6-1, 6-0 victory over Christo Van 
Rensburg of South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Jonas Svensson had taken Becker out of Mecir's path, 7-6, 6-4, 
6-3, the 24-year-old Czech needed only 1 hour 34 minutes to eliminate Van 
Rensburg and move into the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
Mecir was his usual talkative self afterward. 
</P>
<P>
Question: Does everything seem to be falling into place, with all the seeds 
getting knocked out in your half of the draw? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: I cannot do anything about that. 
</P>
<P>
Q: You're not complaining, presumably? 
</P>
<P>
A: Not yet. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do you think you have a very good chance to make the final? 
</P>
<P>
A: I don't know. 
</P>
<P>
Mecir said he also doesn't know very much about his next opponent, 17-year-old 
Goran Ivanisevic of Yugoslavia, who came from 2 sets down and beat Leonardo 
Lavalle in a fourth-round match, 3-6, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
Becker's straight-set defeat was a stunning upset, but the third-seeded West 
German committed 35 unforced errors and made only 48% of his first serves. 
</P>
<P>
Svensson, whose other big victory was a quarterfinal upset of Lendl in the 1988 
French Open, was remarkably steady. He provided Becker with only 2 break-point 
opportunities and allowed none. 
</P>
<P>
"It was his day," Becker said. "On his day, he beat Ivan Lendl at the French 
Open. I haven't seen many players beating him the way he did, almost the same 
way he beat me, in straight sets. When he's hot, he's hot." 
</P>
<P>
Jan Gunnarsson of Sweden moved into a quarterfinal match with Svensson after 
scoring a 7-6, 6-1, 6-2 victory over Michiel Schapers of Holland. 
</P>
<P>
Martina Navratilova and Helena Sukova set up a quarterfinal meeting with 
victories Monday. Navratilova defeated Hana Mandlikova, 6-4, 6-1, and Sukova 
rallied from a 2-5 deficit in the first set to defeat Catherine Tanvier of 
France, 7-5, 6-4.

DRURY, 'NOBLEST TROJAN OF THEM ALL,' DEAD AT 85 
</P>

<P>
Morley Drury, legendary USC tailback who was called, "The Noblest Trojan of 
Them All," died of a stroke late Sunday night at Santa Monica Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Drury, 85, had been an invalid for about 12 years and was preparing for a knee 
operation when he was stricken. 
</P>
<P>
Drury is survived by his wife, Louise; a daughter, Margaret; a brother, Harold, 
and 2 grandchildren, Tom and Carol. 
</P>
<P>
Private funeral and cremation services will be held Thursday, with the Veterans 
Center in West Los Angeles conducting the arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
Many credit Drury with pioneering the Trojan tailback legacy that has produced 
four Heisman Trophy winners. 
</P>
<P>
Drury received a stirring standing ovation at the Coliseum when he left the 
field after his last game in 1927. 
</P>
<P>
An All-American, Drury finished his college career by running for 180 yards and 
scoring 3 touchdowns as USC beat Washington, 33-13. 
</P>
<P>
The public address announcer told the crowd that Drury was coming off the field 
for the last time and should get "the hand that he deserves." 
</P>
<P>
Drury later recalled that emotional moment: "I reached the track and looked up 
at all those people. I tried to wave, but my hand jerked, so it wasn't much of 
a wave. My knees got weak even if I did feel as fresh as a horse. And I bawled 
like a baby." 
</P>
<P>
A big running back at the time -- 6 feet and 185 pounds -- Drury was the first 
Trojan tailback to gain more than 1,000 yards rushing in a season, piling up 
1,163 in 9 games in 1927. 
</P>
<P>
A USC tailback wouldn't gain more than 1,000 yards in a season again until Mike 
Garrett rushed for 1,440 in 10 games in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
Drury is identified with Howard Jones' Thundering Herd teams of the late 1920s. 
Jones used his tailback extensively in a single wing formation, and no one, 
past or present, was as durable as Drury. 
</P>
<P>
He played every position in the backfield at one time and was a safety on 
defense. It wasn't uncommon for him to play all 60 minutes in a game. 
</P>
<P>
Drury also passed and punted as a triple-threat tailback, but he was best 
knownfor his power running. 
</P>
<P>
In one game in his senior season, he carried the ball 45 times. Forty-one years 
elapsed before another Trojan tailback, O.J. Simpson, would work as hard. 
Simpson had 47 carries in a game in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
So Drury was ahead of his time, in productivity and work ethic. 
</P>
<P>
Drury lived most of his life in Santa Monica and was confined to a wheelchair 
in recent years. He received a rousing ovation when he was introduced on the 
floor of the Coliseum last August in a celebration of USC's centennial year of 
football. 
</P>
<P>
He had some memorable games, such as the 13-13 tie with Stanford in 1927, when 
he gained 163 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Drury came to USC in 1925, the same year that Jones became the school's coach. 
During his 3 years on the varsity, the Trojans had a 27-5-1 record. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Kelly, a former sports editor of the Los Angeles Examiner, is credited 
with immortalizing Drury in Trojan lore when he wrote of the running back: 
"He's the noblest Trojan of them all." 
</P>
<P>
The nickname endured over the years and was a constant source of gratification 
to Drury, who was recognized as such at every function he attended. 
</P>
<P>
Drury was born Feb. 5, 1903, in Midland, Ontario, Canada. His father died when 
Morley was 7, and the family, his mother and brother, Harold, moved to Long 
Beach when Drury was a teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
Drury was older than most students when he enrolled at USC. He worked in the 
Long Beach shipyard for 2 years after he finished grammar school and before he 
went to Long Beach Poly High School, where he established his credentials as an 
outstanding running back. 
</P>
<P>
And the ovation he received in 1927 as he trotted off the field to the locker 
room for the last time is a moment he always cherished. 
</P>
<P>
"We had just scored a touchdown, and the teams were all lined up to kick when 
Jones grabbed me and said, 'You can go on to the dressing room, but you have to 
walk across the field,' " Drury recalled. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, the whole crowd stood up as I started my walk. Then, the opposing team 
stood up. The ovation lasted until I reached the tunnel. As I approached the 
tunnel, I knew I couldn't hold back the tears."

SUPER BOWL RATINGS UP ONLY SLIGHTLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART

<TEXT>
<P>
Apparently, the closeness of the Super Bowl does not have a great effect on 
television ratings. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's game, in which San Francisco edged Cincinnati, 20-16, drew an average 
overnight Nielsen rating of 42.7 and a share of 65 in the nation's 17 largest 
markets, according to NBC. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's Super Bowl, in which Washington routed Denver, 42-10, drew an 
overnight rating of 41.2 -- only 3% lower than this year's -- and a 60 share. 
</P>
<P>
The final national rating will be announced later in the week. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, this year's Super Bowl rating was a 42.4 and the share a 72, 
compared to a 42.8 and a 66 for last year's game. 
</P>
<P>
In San Francisco, the game drew a 53.3 rating and an 82 share. 
</P>
<P>
The highest national Super Bowl rating ever, a 49.1, was for the 49er-Bengal 
game in 1982. The San Francisco rating for that game was a 55.7 and the share 
an incredible 93, meaning 93% of the people in San Francisco watching 
television at the time were watching the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
A rating represents the percentage of television households where a particular 
program is being watched. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's Super Bowl drew a national rating of 41.9, the lowest since 1974.

NEWSWIRE: DODGERS REPORTEDLY NEAR A DEAL FOR ORIOLE PITCHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A deal that would send Dodger outfielder Mike Devereaux to the Baltimore 
Orioles for pitcher Mike Morgan is being discussed, according to the Baltimore 
Sun. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the deal might be completed in the next day or two. 
</P>
<P>
"I've talked to (Dodger Vice President) Fred Claire recently," Oriole General 
Manager Roland Hemond said Monday night. "I don't know if we're close." 
</P>
<P>
Claire, reached at his home in Pasadena, declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Devereaux, 25, a right-handed hitting outfielder, was one of the players who 
was supposedly heading for Baltimore in the Eddie Murray trade in December. But 
the Orioles opted instead for pitcher Brian Holton. 
</P>
<P>
Last year at Albuquerque, Devereaux batted .340 with 13 homers, 76 RBIs and 33 
steals. With the Dodgers, he batted .116 in 43 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan was 1-6 for the Orioles last year. He began the season as a starter but 
after going 0-5 through 7 starts, he went to the bullpen.

WALSH GIVE THE FANS THEIR QUARTER'S WORTH 
</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Of the many things it takes to win a National Football League championship, one 
of the most important is superior coaching. 
</P>
<P>
That seemed as obvious this winter as it has for most of the 1980s, in which 
two teams have won 5 of the last 8 Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
They are the San Francisco 49ers, coached by Bill Walsh, and the Washington 
Redskins, coached by Joe Gibbs. 
</P>
<P>
Although no champion has been able to win in successive years in a decade of 
parity, the 49ers and Redskins have both made the Super Bowl 3 times since 
1981. 
</P>
<P>
No other team in that spell has been there more than twice. 
</P>
<P>
This has been a decade in which either Walsh or Gibbs usually had his players 
peaking at just the right time to sweep the 3-game playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh's 1981 team made the first sweep. 
</P>
<P>
Then Gibbs' 1982 team won it. 
</P>
<P>
Next, Walsh's 1984 team. 
</P>
<P>
Then Gibbs' 1987 team. 
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's Super Bowl here, Walsh's 1988 National Conference champions made it 
3 for the '80s, coming from behind in the fourth quarter to beat the Cincinnati 
Bengals with a 92-yard drive, 20-16. 
</P>
<P>
For the NFL, it was a season in which the Buffalo Bills peaked on Nov. 14, when 
they won their 11th straight, after which they finished 12-4. 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals also peaked at mid-season. Their pass offense didn't do much after 
Thanksgiving, although, by then, Boomer Esiason had the momentum to earn 
all-pro. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers were 6-5 on Nov. 21. They improved after that, peaking in January for 
the third time in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to explain it Monday, Walsh said: "We lighten up the workload later in 
the season. Some frustrated teams start to work harder -- too hard." 
</P>
<P>
But that can't be more than a partial answer. The real answer has to be Walsh's 
secret. And Gibbs'. 
</P>
<P>
The only visible thing is the result. 
</P>
<P>
This was the fifth straight Super Bowl triumph for the National Conference, but 
the first in years that wasn't a blowout. Is the AFC beginning to send up 
tougher champions? 
</P>
<P>
It didn't seem so. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers just couldn't get started this time. 
</P>
<P>
They drove repeatedly through the Cincinnati defense but mixed in so many 
misplays with their big plays that they scored only a field goal in the first 
half. 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals, thankful for the reprieve, took the second-half kickoff and made a 
game of it. 
</P>
<P>
So will Super Bowl XXIII be remembered for the 49ers' mediocre performance in 
the first 3 quarters or for the brilliance of Joe Montana, Jerry Rice, Roger 
Craig and their sidemen in the fourth quarter? 
</P>
<P>
The history of these games suggests that only the glitter is remembered. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most memorable of all NFL title matches was won by the Baltimore 
Colts over the New York Giants in 1958 in sudden-death overtime, 23-17. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the era of television, it was the game that led the NFL to national 
prominence. 
</P>
<P>
And it was as full of misplays as Sunday's Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
What's remembered, however, is the glitter of John Unitas, who guided the Colts 
to victory with two key drives -- first in the fourth quarter, then in the 
fifth. 
</P>
<P>
What's remembered are comebacks. 
</P>
<P>
One difference between Walsh and, at the moment, other coaches, seems to be the 
skill that he has developed as a talent scout. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, General Manager Bobby Beathard is in charge of the draft. 
</P>
<P>
On other NFL clubs, the chief of personnel is sometimes a draft specialist, 
sometimes a coach, sometimes a general manager. 
</P>
<P>
But few get Walsh's results. In part this is because, as both coach and chief 
scout, he is uniquely in position to bring in just the players who best fit his 
philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't all the best in college," Jerry Rice said. "But Bill saw something 
in all of us that he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
"He took me in like a son, and developed me into the player I am." 
</P>
<P>
Rice was a first draft choice of the 49ers, as was Pro Bowl safety Ronnie Lott. 
But most of Walsh's starters were second- or third-round choices. 
</P>
<P>
Montana was a third. Roger Craig was a second. Fullback Tom Rathman was a 
third, as was John Taylor, the wide receiver who scored the winning touchdown 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
A second-round choice has to be passed over by 28 personnel departments in the 
first round, and, usually, by a few in the second. A third-round choice is 
passed over at least 56 times. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers, in other words, have proven that high choices can be overrated as a 
championship precondition. 
</P>
<P>
It can be a cop-out to say, as many have said, "We've won so much that we've 
been drafting too low to keep winning." 
</P>
<P>
Championship players can be found in the second and third rounds, and lower, 
for those who have the skill to find them.

SMALL BUSINESS: OFFICER IS TARGETING POLICE IN HIS MAIL-ORDER 'LINEUP' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY STAVRO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like many cops, when Sgt. David Crockett heads home at night, he takes his 
pistol -- a 9-millimeter Beretta -- with him. But after nearly two decades on 
the Los Angeles Police Department, Crockett has come up with a few ideas of his 
own. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of leaving the pistol on a nightstand, he stores it in a bedside 
holster on the side of his mattress. Why? "Cops are concerned about 
neighborhood burglars just like everybody else," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He sells the bedside holster to other cops for $23.50. 
</P>
<P>
Some nights, it gets awfully quiet in the squad car, so Crockett has tested a 
portable AM-FM radio that clips onto a rear-view mirror to help pass the time. 
He sells the radio for $39.95. 
</P>
<P>
Other nights, when Crockett has gotten the rear windows of his police car 
kicked out by a suspect, things aren't so quiet. So Crockett sells a $9 nylon 
chain that wraps around a suspect's legs and clips onto their handcuffs. 
Crockett calls this a "Duster Buster." In police lingo, somebody who is numbed 
by the drug PCP, or angel dust, is "dusted" and, as Crockett describes it, the 
chain keeps "your PCP suspect or other obnoxious combatant . . . restrained, 
whether he likes it or not." 
</P>
<P>
Crockett, 42, works out of the North Hollywood Division, but in his spare time, 
he sells police paraphernalia from his mail-order business called Lineup Police 
Products, which he runs out of a cramped Chatsworth warehouse. He offers about 
300 items to police around the country and writes every word of copy in his 
36-page catalogue, which goes out four times a year to 90,000 potential 
customers and brings in about $450,000 a year in sales, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He sells handcuffs, gun-cleaning kits and, from $8.50 on up, Slim Jims -- the 
notched metal bars that unlock cars, which police use to rescue those who have 
locked their keys in their cars. He targets many of his sales to small-town, 
Andy of Mayberry-type police departments that have a couple of officers, little 
follow-up training and no access to new-equipment supply stores. "I do the 
research and the shopping for them," Crockett said. 
</P>
<P>
The Potosi Correctional Facility in Missouri, for instance, ordered a couple of 
videotapes that deal with how to defend against knife or razor-blade attacks. 
"We need to get anything we can get on edged weapons. It's what a lot of 
inmates use," said Danny Berry, Potosi's business manager. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the books and videos that Crockett stocks offer tips on police 
techniques, such as collecting evidence at a crime scene. What do you do if you 
have to fingerprint a corpse whose fingers look like 2-year-old prunes? First, 
inject water into the wrinkled digit. The same volume points out that if blood 
drips from a height of 20 inches or less, it will form an almost perfect coin 
shape on the floor, while blood that drops from seven feet resembles a scallop 
shell. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tips on Escorting Suspects 
</P>
<P>
One videotape demonstrates how to escort a suspect without handcuffs. The 
instructor advises to keep one hand on the suspect's elbow and, with the other 
hand, grab the back of his pants and yank upward to tighten the pressure on his 
groin. "That's darn uncomfortable. It takes his mind off resistance," the 
instructor says. If the suspect turns belligerent, the instructor says to 
remember that "the head is a gift." He shows how to grab a suspect's hair and 
yank him to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Crockett also sells jokes, coffee mugs and T-shirts emblazoned with cartoons 
and sayings that he composes in the spirit of black police station humor. One 
popular mug for the Homicide Division reads: "Our day begins when yours ends." 
Another mug shows a burglar in flight with a gun trained on him. It reads: "Cut 
Court Costs." 
</P>
<P>
Crockett's boss, Capt. Dan Watson, commanding officer of the department's North 
Hollywood Patrol, said: "It's a business he's developed using his expertise 
from being a police officer. I see it as a combination of serious training aids 
and novelty items. I know that people here purchase his products." 
</P>
<P>
Crockett has three employees, plus his mother, who does the accounting, and 
says his business turns a profit, although he won't say how much. It's 
promising enough that he's thought about quitting the department. Next month, 
Crockett hits his 20-year mark on the job, so he's eligible to retire at 40% of 
his $50,000-a-year salary. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Difficult Time' 
</P>
<P>
"I'm having a difficult time figuring out if this is the right time or not," 
Crockett said. He still likes his job and his co-workers, and there's also the 
worry of making enough from his business to keep up his life style. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure that it's going to work yet. Every time you turn around, the 
bureaucracies are going after you," Crockett said. 
</P>
<P>
Postage for instance. Last year, the post office upped the mail order tab; now 
Crockett pays 17 cents to mail each catalogue, up from 12 cents. Add the 25 
cents that he pays to print each catalogue and Crockett invests about $37,000 
to get each run out the door. He also gripes about workers' compensation 
insurance -- it's doubled in three years -- and says finding reliable suppliers 
is a nagging headache. 
</P>
<P>
But he sticks with mail order because he likes the magic of sending out a piece 
of paper in the mail and getting money sent back. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Joke-Filled Police Calendar 
</P>
<P>
He got started in 1981 when an artist friend came up with an idea for a 
joke-filled police calendar. They printed 1,000 calendars, and Crockett left 
flyers around the police station and put a small ad in a police newspaper. Two 
months later, he had 800 calendars left and was looking at a $1,000 loss -- 
then the responses came in from his ad, and he sold out. The next year, he put 
together another calendar and added some coffee mugs and, as his business grew, 
he moved it from his garage to a warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
There are about 800,000 police and other law-enforcement types in the United 
States, and Crockett figures that the average pay for police nationwide is a 
modest $24,000, so he tries to keep his prices down. One item that flopped was 
a $214 steel battering ram to bust down doors. "Too expensive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Crockett only advertises in police magazines, he's careful not to sell 
some of his products unless customers enclose a copy of their police 
identification card. "I don't want some people out there to have these 
products," he said. Possible Crockett contraband includes a videotape on how to 
burglarize a home, which neatly demonstrates how to force open an electronic 
garage door in 15 seconds with a crow bar; how to beat the three most popular 
brands of door locks with an awl and a screw driver, and an explanation why 
GM's cars have the toughest locks of the Big 3 car companies. 
</P>
<P>
Another item Crockett sells, which he says isn't authorized for use by the Los 
Angeles Police Department, is a 26-inch steel baton (price $45) used by the 
U.S. Capitol Police. For police on other departments, it makes a dandy "impact 
weapon," he said, and whips out in a second to its full length. Even when 
retracted, the baton comes in handy, Crockett said. "It improves your punch, if 
you're going to punch a guy." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Field Supervisor 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, Crockett works as field supervisor on the 3:30 p.m.-to-midnight 
shift, getting called in on such special problems as family disputes that won't 
stop simmering, and chemical spills. In his tenure, Crockett said, he hasn't 
shot anybody or been shot at, although he was burned when he was surprised by a 
wall of flame during a rescue at an apartment building that caught fire from 
fireworks. He was off work a month. 
</P>
<P>
He still likes being a police officer, but the bureaucracy grinds on him. As a 
member of the department, for instance, he needed a special permit to run his 
mail-order business and, even with the permit, he can't put in any more than 20 
hours a week. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Crockett said he will probably stay on the force a few more years. Each 
year's service fattens his pension by 3%, and it will lessen the pressure on 
his mail-order business to hit it big. 
</P>
<P>
As Crockett noted, sending out a catalogue is like "going to the races or to 
Las Vegas. It's a gamble. You put your money down and hope everything goes

VALLEY EARNINGS: CHEROKEE GROUP IN SUNLAND LOSES $1.57 MILLION IN QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cherokee Group, a Sunland apparel company that is in the process of going 
private, said it lost $1.57 million in its fiscal second quarter ended Nov. 26. 
</P>
<P>
Cherokee, which earned $2.28 million, or 18 cents a share, in the year-earlier 
period, said the loss mostly reflected $1.9 million in pretax costs that 
stemmed from the pending $174-million leveraged buyout of Cherokee by Green 
Acquisition Co., an investor group that includes some top Cherokee executives. 
</P>
<P>
Cherokee's second-quarter sales fell to $27.9 million from $33.2 million, which 
the company blamed on a slowdown in the apparel industry and customer 
uncertainty about the proposed takeover of the company. Cherokee said its 
orders have improved in the current quarter, however. 
</P>
<P>
For the first half of its fiscal year, Cherokee's profit tumbled to $891,000, 
or 7 cents a share, from $5.23 million, or 40 cents a share, a year earlier. 
Six-month sales climbed to $71.1 million from $68.9 million.

VALLEY EARNINGS: DATAPRODUCTS REPORTS A 51% JUMP IN 3RD-QUARTER PROFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dataproducts Corp., a Woodland Hills manufacturer of computer printers, said 
its fiscal third-quarter profit jumped 51% from a year earlier on a 4% gain in 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
In the three months ended Dec. 24, Dataproducts earned $1.63 million, or 8 
cents a share, up from $1.08 million, or a nickel a share, a year earlier. 
Revenue rose to $94.5 million from $91.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Dataproducts said the improved results reflected higher sales volume. But the 
company also reported a slowdown in computer-printer orders in the current 
quarter from customers that market complete computer systems. 
</P>
<P>
For the first nine months of its fiscal year, Dataproducts earned $3.58 
million, or 18 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $5.27 
million. Nine-month revenue rose to $268.1 million from $249.2 million.

VALLEY EARNINGS: TRANSTECHNOLOGY REPORTS 12% DROP IN 3RD QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TransTechnology's earnings fell 12% in the third quarter that ended Dec. 31 to 
$2.9 million, or 57 cents a share. Revenue rose 13% to $60.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Sherman Oaks aerospace company attributed the drop in earnings to lower 
results at its Breeze-Eastern/Aerospace business. The unit, which makes chains 
that are used to tie down jet fighters on aircraft carriers, completed a 
contract a year earlier. However, TransTechnology said its backlog of orders is 
a healthy $121 million. 
</P>
<P>
For the nine months, TransTechnology's earnings fell 34% to $5.6 million, or 
$1.08 a share, as revenue climbed 14% to $163.0 million.

HOH IS ORDERED TO PAY $760,000 TO EX-EXECUTIVE IN LOAN DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOH Water Technology, a Newbury Park company that is developing a 
water-purification system, has been ordered by a federal court to pay $760,000 
to a former executive who claims the company reneged on an agreement to repay 
money he loaned it. 
</P>
<P>
George Todt, a businessman in Cape Girardeau, Mo., last Thursday was awarded 
$360,000 that he claimed HOH owed him and an additional $400,000 in punitive 
damages. Todt sued HOH and its chief executive, Harry O'Hare, in 1987 in U.S. 
District Court in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The judgment is the latest piece of bad news for HOH. Last September, HOH 
announced it received a seven-year, $3.25-million line of credit from Sisson 
International &amp; Associated Refineries. Sisson, a real estate and energy 
concern, also agreed to pay $1.75 million to sell HOH products in such Asian 
countries as Indonesia and Malaysia, HOH said then. 
</P>
<P>
But Ronald Givner, a lawyer who represents HOH, confirmed Monday that Sisson 
has so far failed to meet its obligations under the contract. Givner said HOH 
is reviewing its options on what to do in the wake of the court judgment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Price of Securities Dropping 
</P>
<P>
The prices for HOH's stock and units are beginning to reflect the company's 
problems, in sharp contrast to last year when they shot up in price even though 
the company did not have a product on the market. Three months ago, HOH's units 
were trading at $23.625 each on the over-the-counter market. 
</P>
<P>
But on Monday, they plunged $1.875 to $9.875 each, while the stock fell 28 
cents to $2.625. (One HOH unit consists of three shares of common stock and 
three warrants, which give holders rights to a specific amount of stock at a 
certain price within a specified time.) 
</P>
<P>
Todt had been working since 1982 with O'Hare, who invented Ty-D-Bol toilet bowl 
cleaner and helped pioneer the use of chlorinators to clean swimming pools. HOH 
is developing "The Watergizer," a purification technology it hopes to sell to 
homes, offices, factories and farmers. 
</P>
<P>
Todt claimed he had loaned the company $218,000, which HOH would pay back 
periodically with interest as it raised money. HOH paid nearly $20,000 to Todt 
in 1983 and 1984, but it stopped after that, according to Todt's lawyer, 
Jeffrey Ehrlich. 
</P>
<P>
HOH claimed that in 1984, Todt agreed to give up his claim to the money in 
exchange for 100,000 shares of stock. Todt denied that he made any agreement, 
saying he bought the stock separately in July, 1984, for 1 cent a share. 
</P>
<P>
The company ultimately raised $4 million in June, 1987. Ehrlich said Todt was 
entitled to receive his money then.

HEART AND SELL; 
</P>
<P>
A SELF-HELP AUTHOR IS TAKING HIS OWN ADVICE IN REBUILDING AFTER A BANKRUPTCY 
AND CORONARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Charles R. Whitlock is a Westlake Village businessman who claims to have earned 
millions of dollars from starting several small companies. On March 3, 1985, he 
suffered a heart attack at age 42 while having dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Whitlock survived the attack, and while he recovered he searched for one book 
or magazine that had all the diet, exercise and psychological help that a heart 
attack victim would need to stay healthy. There was none. 
</P>
<P>
So as an inveterate entrepreneur, Whitlock last year started HeartCorps 
magazine, "a self-help journal" for heart patients. The bimonthly publication, 
which premiered last summer, is getting early raves from patients, doctors and 
insurance companies, said Whitlock, who is the magazine's publisher. No less 
than Dr. Michael E. DeBakey, the famous heart surgeon in Houston, has loaned 
his name to HeartCorps's advisory board. 
</P>
<P>
Things are going so well that another health-related magazine, Hippocrates, 
which is half-owned by Time, already has offered to buy HeartCorps for $2 
million, Whitlock said. 
</P>
<P>
The story of HeartCorps, in fact, would likely have made another chapter in a 
book Whitlock wrote two years ago, titled "10 Ways You Can Earn $1 Million This 
Year," in which he reveals his secrets of success. The book's cover shows 
Whitlock standing next to a limousine in front of his $1-million house. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a magic touch," said William L. Bush, a former hospital manager whom 
Whitlock hired as HeartCorps's editor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Other Side 
</P>
<P>
Maybe not. As Whitlock's book was coming out in 1987, he was filing for 
personal bankruptcy protection in federal court in Los Angeles. Meanwhile, a 
windmill-energy company he helped start a few years earlier also was filing for 
protection from creditors in bankruptcy court. And just as embarrassing, the 
house pictured on Whitlock's book doesn't belong to him anymore. His bankruptcy 
led to its foreclosure. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't the first time Whitlock had stumbled financially. He had filed for 
personal bankruptcy in Green Bay, Wis., in 1969, although he neglected to 
mention that in his book. Whitlock said he "elected not to include it." 
</P>
<P>
And, Hippocrates says it has not offered to buy HeartCorps, it has only held 
exploratory talks with the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Although his financial setbacks aren't in his book, Whitlock said recently that 
"half the battle in this life is to be able to get back up and dust yourself 
off." In many ways, his hopes of returning to financial health depend on the 
success of HeartCorps magazine. 
</P>
<P>
How did Whitlock find himself in such a deep hole? His problems stemmed from 
Airtricity, a venture he helped start in 1982, which built and maintained 
powered windmills in the aftermath of the oil-shocked 1970s, when alternative 
energy was all the rage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tax Incentives 
</P>
<P>
The windmills were popular with investors, largely because of tax incentives, 
and Whitlock said about 3,000 of his windmills are among the wind farms that 
populate the desert near Palm Springs. Whitlock was president and owned 39% of 
Airtricity. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1986, the tax incentives were repealed, world oil prices collapsed from 
around $30 a barrel to $10, and interest in alternative energy waned. By May, 
1987, Airtricity had fled to federal bankruptcy court amid a flurry of lawsuits 
between the company, its management, creditors and investors. 
</P>
<P>
Whitlock said some Airtricity investors and creditors sought damages directly 
from him, and that most of his money had been invested in Airtricity, both of 
which led to his personal bankruptcy filing. 
</P>
<P>
Whitlock claims to have made millions, but according to the filing, the 
millions had vanished. He listed total assets of $1.22 million, but $1.2 
million of that was the market value of his 5,500-square-foot house in the 
exclusive North Ranch district between 
</P>
<P>
Westlake Village and Thousand Oaks. His debts totaled $986,946, including a 
$738,276 mortgage on the house, and more than $93,000 of bank and credit-card 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
After filing for bankruptcy protection, he hoped to sell the house, pay off his 
mortgage and use his $460,000 of equity in the house to pay off other 
creditors. But he discovered that the house was built on loose, shifting land, 
and he could not sell the property, Whitlock said. 
</P>
<P>
So Whitlock's lender, Glendale Federal Savings &amp; Loan, foreclosed on the 
property last August by purchasing it for the amount left on the mortgage. 
Proceeds to Whitlock? Zero. And "the builder had gone bankrupt so there was no 
recourse through him," Whitlock said. 
</P>
<P>
Whitlock's book recounts how he started each of his businesses, along with 
advice and upbeat tips: "Be prepared to work hard, but be positive about your 
own capabilities." Chapter 2 is titled, "The First Million(s)" and Whitlock 
lists in detail what "action steps" the reader must take to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
The book also portrays a man constantly searching for greener pastures. Born 
and raised in Chicago, Whitlock says he snuck into the Marine Corps at age 12 
by altering his birth certificate, took basic training and then was honorably 
discharged after admitting his true age. He claims to have done it again at age 
14, only this time he joined the Air Force and studied electronics. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Businesses 
</P>
<P>
Over the next 25 years, Whitlock's resume fattened considerably. He says he 
started a firm that made printed circuit boards in Illinois, started a 
Chicago-area magazine devoted to the circuit board industry, briefly became a 
policeman in Lexington, Ky., revitalized another circuit board company in 
Eveleth, Minn., started a Green Bay, Wis., firm that serviced medical 
equipment, spent brief stints as a medical marketing officer at such large 
industrial companies as Honeywell, Bendix and Baxter-Travenol. 
</P>
<P>
Next, having moved to Southern California, he started a Woodland Hills company 
to sell add-on products for dialysis machines, started a company to extract 
silver from hospital X-rays, started a firm that provided security guards for 
hospitals and then started Airtricity. 
</P>
<P>
Whitlock said some of the firms he started were later sold to other 
corporations, giving him money to plow into his next venture. The security 
business, for instance, was sold to Bekins, he said. Others, like the circuit 
board magazine, were unable to compete in their markets and were discontinued. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Poor at Maintenance' 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a concept man," he said. "I'm very poor at long-term maintenance. I'm very 
good at getting something launched and started and built up to a certain 
level." 
</P>
<P>
Whitlock says he got a bachelor's degree in business from LaSalle Extension 
University in Chicago and an MBA from American University in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Whitlock's personal bankruptcy case was formally discharged by the court in 
October, and in the meantime, he managed to raise about $200,000 from 
consulting jobs and loans to help start HeartCorps magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, 125,000 copies of each HeartCorps issue are printed at a cost of 
$180,000, but paid subscriptions total only about 10,000, Bush said. An 
additional 70,000 are being sent to hospitals, cardiac-rehabilitation centers 
and other medical facilities nationwide in the hope of luring subscribers. 
Another 55,000 copies are handled by U.S. and Canadian newsstands and 
bookstores, with about a third being sold, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Life Style Questions 
</P>
<P>
HeartCorps addresses various life style questions facing heart patients. Its 
stories provide diet and exercise help, describe which medicines are "heart 
healthy," and help family members cope with a relative who has heart trouble. 
The current issue's cover story asks the question, "Should recovering heart 
attack patients have sex?" The answer: Yes, but carefully. 
</P>
<P>
There's no question HeartCorps' potential audience is big. About 60 million 
Americans have some sort of heart disease, and each year 1 million of the 1.5 
million Americans who suffer heart attacks survive, according to the American 
Heart Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Whitlock said his priorities changed after his heart attack. "I don't work for 
money," he said. "I work to enjoy my life style, to live a healthy life and to 
help others do that." 
</P>
<P>
Heart disease remains the nation's biggest killer, accounting for more deaths 
than cancer and AIDS combined. 
</P>
<P>
But that doesn't automatically build a magazine's circulation. Jim Martay, 
executive publisher of Hippocrates, an 18-month-old magazine based in 
Sausalito, Calif., said "we probably could identify 20 million people 
interested in health, but we're doing well at 500,000" circulation. In 
November, Time paid $9 million to buy 50% of Hippocrates. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Selling Ads 
</P>
<P>
He said the hard part of making health magazines successful is selling enough 
advertising. "That's part of the question we have, whether HeartCorps has 
enough potential on the ad side to succeed," Martay said. 
</P>
<P>
Whitlock and Bush asserted that HeartCorps' advertising is off to a fast start. 
Although advertisers often agree to place ads in a magazine's first issue only 
if it's free, 18 of the 24 ads in HeartCorps 74-page debut issue were paid, and 
paid advertising is now running about 30 pages, Bush said. The magazine needs 
about 40 pages of ads to make money and Whitlock says that the magazine will be 
making money in a year. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the start-up and operating costs not covered by ads or subscriptions 
are picked up by HeartCorps' printer, Amway Corp. in Michigan. Also, HeartCorps 
is saving money by paying Amway with stock in the magazine instead of cash. 
Whitlock and Bush each still own 25% of HeartCorps; the rest is owned by Amway 
and other investors. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, giving a printer stock in exchange for its services is one of the 
techniques Whitlock's book prescribes for budding publishers who want to save 
cash. So Whitlock is following his own advice in the hope of making a financial 
comeback. 
</P>
<P>
Which to brings to mind what B.C. Forbes, the late founder of Forbes magazine, 
once said: "You make more money selling advice than from following it."

1,000 FEARED DEAD IN SOVIET ASIAN QUAKE, MUDSLIDES 
</P>

MOSCOW 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rescuers worked feverishly Monday, but with little hope of finding survivors, 
after the second major earthquake in less than two months jolted the south of 
the Soviet Union, triggering a mudslide that buried parts of two villages and 
an estimated 1,000 people under a 50-foot layer of earth and rock. 
</P>
<P>
Officials stressed that the casualty toll was preliminary since the disaster 
had wiped out roads, bridges, power and telephone lines, making it impossible 
to reach several other villages in the mountainous area of Tadzhikistan. At one 
point Monday, Radio Moscow put the death toll at 1,415. 
</P>
<P>
Tass, the official Soviet news agency, said that at its epicenter, the tremor 
measured 7 on the 12-point Soviet scale, the rough equivalent of a magnitude 
5.4 quake by Western measurements. 
</P>
<P>
Last month's devastating earthquake that killed at least 25,000 people in 
Soviet Armenia, near the Turkish border, registered 10 on the Soviet scale, or 
magnitude 6.9. 
</P>
<P>
That giant quake also left 500,000 people homeless. And officials in the 
Armenian capital of Yerevan revealed Monday that, based on geologic phenomena 
that could "portend a dangerous release of energy accumulated in the Earth's 
crust," the population has been warned about possible new shocks to come. 
</P>
<P>
Tass said the latest temblor was centered 20 to 30 miles southwest of Dushanbe, 
capital of the Central Asian Soviet republic of Tadzhikistan. 
</P>
<P>
"Cries and wails can be heard everywhere," the news agency reported in a 
dispatch from the area. "Some are bemoaning and burying their relatives and 
near ones, while others are trying to find the few survivors beneath the thick 
layer of sand and clay." 
</P>
<P>
State television showed film Monday evening of dozens of local men dodging the 
bucket of a heavy bulldozer as they tried with picks and shovels to help dig 
through the fast-drying mud. 
</P>
<P>
Others dressed in traditional, calf-length padded robes and square, embroidered 
skullcaps carried away a body in what appeared to be a funeral procession. 
</P>
<P>
State television reported only 104 people being treated in hospitals more than 
18 hours after the quake. Most of those were apparently injured when their 
adobe houses and other buildings collapsed from the quake. 
</P>
<P>
Those in the path of the giant mudslides apparently had little hope. Novosti 
News Agency correspondent Rima Alekseeva said in a telephone interview from 
Dushanbe that fewer than 10 people had been pulled alive from the mud by Monday 
afternoon, and they were lucky to have been at the outer edge of the 
devastation. 
</P>
<P>
The worst hit was reportedly the village of Sharora, where at least 100 of 150 
homes were completely or partially buried by a murky wall of mud and debris 
measuring more than a mile across at its widest point. 
</P>
<P>
The village had grown up around an experimental farm, according to the 
government newspaper Izvestia, and it butted up against a high earthen mound. 
"Rains and wet snow, falling almost incessantly in the last weeks, 
significantly weakened the soil," the newspaper said. And when the quake struck 
at about 5 a.m. local time Monday, the earth gave way. 
</P>
<P>
In the Tadzhikistan village of Okuli-olo, Tass quoted Hairrulo Yuldashev, head 
of the local cooperative farm, as saying that 70 homes had been demolished by 
Monday's quake. State television film from the settlement showed adobe-type, 
one- and two-story buildings that looked as if they had been crushed like 
cookies in some giant, unseen hand. 
</P>
<P>
Panels of corrugated metal that had once been roofs lay scattered like a 
dropped deck of playing cards. The gnarled roots of a large tree swept along by 
a mudslide protruded grotesquely from the dirt and rubble. 
</P>
<P>
"The natural calamity has also battered several other villages of the 
district," Tass reported. "The number of killed was estimated at 1,000 by the 
close of the day, but this is a preliminary figure as yet. Rescue work is being 
continued and distant mountain villages have not been checked yet." 
</P>
<P>
The disaster also killed "thousands of head of publicly owned cattle," Tass 
said, and buried "thousands of hectares of fertile plow-land." 
</P>
<P>
Izvestia quoted local officials as saying rescue operations began within two 
hours of Monday's earthquake and that military units and teams of doctors, some 
from as far away as Moscow, were taking part. Heavy excavators, bulldozers and 
cranes were rushed to the scene from nearby Dushanbe. 
</P>
<P>
Tass said that 35 special medical brigades were sent from Dushanbe to the 
disaster area within hours of the quake. A group of specialists also set off 
from several Moscow institutes and others were standing by, it said. 
</P>
<P>
One village jolted by the quake but apparently not badly damaged was Nurek, 
home to one of the world's highest dams, a 984-foot-tall structure filled with 
compressed clay. The dam, completed in 1980, is almost a mile thick at its base 
and was built especially to withstand strong earthquakes. There was no 
indication that it was damaged. 
</P>
<P>
Novosti correspondent Alekseeva said that officials in Dushanbe saw no reason 
at this point to seek international relief, although both France and West 
Germany were reported by Tass to have offered assistance. 
</P>

In the much larger Armenian earthquake, which felled multistory apartment

them.

COLD WAR THINKING IS CHANGING; 
</P>
<P>
GORBACHEV OUTPOLLS BUSH IN ORANGE COUNTY SURVEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev is rated more favorably than President Bush in 
largely Republican Orange County, which handed Bush and Ronald Reagan their 
greatest margins of victory of any county in the nation in the last three 
presidential elections. 
</P>
<P>
In this bellwether conservative region, The Los Angeles Times Orange County 
Poll has found signs of new thinking on both foreign and domestic issues. 
Nearly half the people believe that the Cold War is coming to an end and that 
Japan and the Third World are greater threats to the United States' future than 
the Soviet Union or China. Twice as many people favor decreasing the U.S. 
military presence overseas as favor an expanded role. 
</P>
<P>
Leading Republican consultant Stu Spencer, a longtime Reagan adviser, sees such 
Orange County attitudes as part of a national trend: "The message is that 
Orange County is more in the mainstream of American thinking than the 
perception. Thinking on the Cold War undoubtedly is changing due to Ronald 
Reagan's policies. His handling of the Soviets has an 80% national approval 
rate with only 8% negative. 
</P>
<P>
"So a conservative leader's accomplishments have affected conservatives at 
home," said Spencer, whose office is in Irvine. "Sure there's a shift. You can 
prove there's a shift by the numbers -- these numbers are in line with what I 
expected." 
</P>
<P>
The results of the Times poll underscore the dilemma Bush faces this week as he 
officially begins work in the Oval Office. Sunday, for example, Brent 
Scowcroft, the new President's national security adviser, declared flatly that 
"the Cold War is not over" and he expressed skepticism about what he termed 
Gorbachev's "peace offensive." 
</P>
<P>
If, as Spencer believes, national conservative thinking on the Soviets is 
shifting under the influence of Reagan's policies, Bush may face as great a 
difficulty with this important domestic constituency as his Administration 
apparently believes that it does with the Western European allies. Scowcroft 
said Sunday that one of Bush's first foreign policy priorities would be to 
persuade the Europeans not be be blinded by "wishful thinking" about Soviet 
intentions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conservative Social Agenda 
</P>
<P>
Responses among Orange County residents also suggest that Bush will have 
something less than overwhelming backing if he attempts to act on his 
conservative social agenda. On Monday, for example, the President telephoned a 
message of support to anti-abortion protesters rallying to mark the 16th 
anniversary of the Supreme Court's historic ruling in Roe vs. Wade. 
</P>
<P>
However, fully 60% of the Orange County residents polled oppose a Supreme Court 
ruling that would outlaw abortion. By an almost 3-1 margin, Orange County 
residents also reject further cuts in federal social and health programs as a 
means of reducing the national deficit. 
</P>
<P>
In the realm of family values, a majority (56%) oppose a ban on the rental of 
X-rated videos in their community. And a stunning 82% favor educating 
adolescents in public schools about the use of condoms to control the spread of 
AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Differences With Leadership 
</P>
<P>
"I am too young to be too conservative" is the way one of those polled, Alex 
Ball, explained his differences with the GOP's leadership on the so-called 
social issues. Ball, a 28-year-old Republican, did volunteer work for Reagan in 
1980 and 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"I can understand Reagan's views on moral values, but he's 77 years old and a 
bit out of touch. It's just not practical to ban abortions, and if they do, a 
lot of people will have regrets later," remarked Ball, who said he voted for 
Bush "largely on the economic and foreign policy issues." 
</P>
<P>
On both domestic and foreign policy issues, there was not much difference in 
the attitudes of the county's Republicans and Democrats. Gorbachev's rating was 
as high among Republicans (73%) as among Democrats (72%). Slightly more 
Republicans (47%) believe that the Cold War might be coming to an end as 
compared to Democrats (44%). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Margin of Error 
</P>
<P>
The Times Orange County Poll of 600 adult residents was conducted Jan. 13-17 by 
Mark Baldassare &amp; Associates of Irvine. The poll has a margin of error of 
plus or minus 4%. 
</P>
<P>
Top Republican pollster Richard B. Wirthlin, who conducted President Reagan's 
public opinion research, said: "The findings of the Times poll reflect changes 
in the political and demographic makeup of Orange County. But more important, 
they are consistent with what I find nationally, which is a tremendous change 
in attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"The Cold War generated a lot of worry and concern about the Soviet threat. It 
is dramatically lower than during any time in the past 20 years. During the 
Cold War period, the feeling that the Soviet threat was the most important 
problem facing the United States ranged between 25% and 50%. In my poll, which 
we've been conducing for 15 years, it is at an all-time low of 8%." 
</P>
<P>
A majority of Republicans (53%) said they oppose a ban on X-rated movies in 
their local community video store, favor teaching about condoms (76%) and 
oppose a new California law that requires schools to teach that abstinence is 
the only acceptable form of premarital birth control (55%). 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people here are liberal on top of their conservative foundation," 
observed one of those polled, Irvine artist-designer Tom Kellog, a Republican 
who opposes a ban on abortions or X-rated videos. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Republican pollsters previously have documented a libertarian streak 
in conservative Republican ideology. They see this insistence on individual 
rights as a natural adjunct to the conservative belief in limited government 
intervention in all social spheres. 
</P>
<P>
"The tendency has been for hard-core Republicans to look at things in a 
libertarian manner," GOP consultant Spencer said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Much More Broad-Minded' 
</P>
<P>
"The perception of the Republican voters of Orange County has always been too 
simplistic. As the Times polling data shows, they are much more broad-minded in 
some areas then people give them credit." 
</P>
<P>
For instance, despite yearlong hearings conducted by Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese's 
commission on the possible adverse social effects of pornography, 47% of those 
Orange County residents who labeled themselves conservatives oppose a ban on 
the rental of "adult X-rated movies" in their community, while 43% favor such a 
ban. And 50% of conservatives oppose the new state law requiring teaching 
abstinence as the only acceptable form of birth control. Conservatives are 
evenly split on the abortion issue, but 78% "favor educating adolescents in 
public schools about the use of condoms as a means of controlling the spread of 
AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fundamentalists Divided 
</P>
<P>
The poll indicates that it would be simplistic to think of the religious 
fundamentalist community as being united on social issues. One-third of those 
interviewed identified themselves as religious fundamentalists, meaning 
"someone who takes the Bible literally on issues such as the creation of life." 
</P>
<P>
But in this group, 44% oppose the requirement on teaching abstinence and 44% 
approve, and 73% favor education about condoms in connection with AIDS. And 47% 
of the fundamentalists oppose a ban on X-rated video rentals, while 45% favor 
it. 
</P>
<P>
On the issue of abortion, whereas non-fundamentalists strongly "oppose having 
the Supreme Court outlaw abortions except in the case of a threat to the 
mother's life," a majority of fundamentalists (52%) favor such a ban, while 41% 
of this group oppose such a prohibition. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Civil Liberties Orientation' 
</P>
<P>
"Orange County residents have traditionally shown a civil liberties orientation 
about personal life-style issues," said Baldassare, who is a UC Irvine 
professor. "But at the point at which civil liberty conflicts with a strong law 
and order (issue), as with the issue of drugs, their attitude swings toward 
stronger authority." 
</P>
<P>
A strong law-and-order stance on drugs coincides with residents' belief that 
drugs are the biggest problem facing young people, although twice as many 
believe that alcohol abuse is a bigger problem than drugs for adults. The 
federal government's so-called "zero-tolerance policy" of seizing boats and 
cars in which a small amount of marijuana is found was favored by 51%, with 42% 
opposed. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's 70% favorable rating was accompanied by a low 15% unfavorable, even 
lower than Reagan's at 18%. Bush had a 67% favorable rating, with 17% 
unfavorable. Reagan topped Gorbachev with 76% favorable and British Prime 
Minister Margaret Thatcher won the sweepstakes with 79% favorable and 11% 
unfavorable. 
</P>
<P>
Yitzhak Shamir, the Israeli prime minister, is less well known to Orange County 
residents, many of whom declined to state a view of him. Of those who did, 21% 
had a favorable impression and 35% unfavorable. 
</P>
<P>
Republican candidates in each of the last three presidential elections have 
carried Orange County by the largest margin of any county nationwide. In 1980, 
Reagan's margin over Jimmy Carter in the county was 353,000 votes. It rose to 
428,000 over Walter F. Mondale in 1984. Bush defeated Michael S. Dukakis by 
314,000 votes in the last election.

THORNBURGH VOWS TO BE FIRM ON CIVIL RIGHTS

Some Americans may be in for "rougher and tougher" treatment from the Justice 
Department as it helps implement President Bush's version of "a kinder, gentler 
America," Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh declared Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Although he did not spell out what measures the Justice Department will take, 
Thornburgh vowed that there will be "firm law enforcement" in several areas, 
including civil rights and environmental protection and illegal drug 
trafficking. "Very high priority" will be given to prosecuting any law 
enforcement officers linked to drug trafficking, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reagan Officials Accused 
</P>
<P>
During Ronald Reagan's eight years as President, his Administration was widely 
accused of shunning civil rights leaders and of failing to adequately enforce 
environmental and civil rights laws. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh stressed that he already has met with civil rights leaders and that 
under Bush they have access to the Justice Department and are being consulted 
on civil rights cases. 
</P>
<P>
Already, he said, some civil rights leaders have "grudgingly agreed" that there 
may be instances where they will agree with the Justice Department that old 
court orders decreeing school desegregation should be terminated because the 
schools are now desegregated and the orders are not needed. 
</P>
<P>
During the Reagan Administration, he said, the department "aroused a great deal 
of animosity" when it moved to terminate such orders without consulting civil 
rights groups. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the Justice Department sent out its first letters seeking to remove 
desegregation orders from schools that it said had become integrated. A civil 
rights group -- the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund -- contested the 
department's attempt to strip the orders from 11 districts, all in Georgia. In 
the words of one department attorney, "substantial litigation ensued," and so 
far none of the cases have been dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Animosity' Developed 
</P>
<P>
Bush's primary goal, Thornburgh said, is to re-establish lines of communication 
with civil rights groups that became "snarled" during the Reagan years and to 
"reduce the apparent level of animosity" that developed between them and the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
While civil rights groups often found themselves aligned against the Justice 
Department in civil rights cases during the Reagan Administration, Thornburgh 
said that under Bush the department and the groups can make "joint assaults" on 
problems as they "work together to solve the nation's civil rights problems." 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh, interviewed at a luncheon session with reporters, also disclosed 
that the Justice Department soon will announce a special task force to work 
with U.S. attorneys in the mushrooming investigation of fraud in Chicago's 
commodities markets. 
</P>
<P>
He called it a "serious and substantial" investigation that has included 
extensive FBI undercover work, but he declined to say when criminal charges are 
expected. The Justice Department task force, he said, will coordinate the work 
of several U.S. attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh, who was appointed attorney general by Reagan last July and 
reappointed by Bush, bristled when a reporter suggested that he had been 
reluctant to criticize his predecessor, Edwin Meese III, even though the 
Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility filed a report 
accusing Meese of ethical violations while in office. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not reluctant to criticize him," Thornburgh said, adding that he had 
released to the public the department's report of how Meese had "violated 
departmental and governmental ethical standards."

HIGH COURT UPSETS DEATH SENTENCE OF FRESNO COUNTY MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A widely divided state Supreme Court on Monday overturned the death sentence of 
a Fresno County man convicted of murdering his estranged wife to avoid paying 
nearly $49,000 he owed her in a divorce settlement. 
</P>
<P>
The justices, filing four separate opinions, upheld the conviction but, by a 
vote of 4 to 3, ordered a new penalty trial for Peter Edelbacher, 33, found 
guilty of murder for financial gain in the slaying of Lela Schwartz-Edelbacher, 
25, in April, 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Only weeks before the woman was fatally shot in the back, Edelbacher, a 
painting contractor, had been acquitted of spousal rape in the first such trial 
of its kind in the county under a new state law making the act a crime. 
</P>
<P>
The court majority concluded Monday that the trial judge's instructions and 
arguments by the prosecution may have misled the jury as to its discretion and 
personal responsibility in deciding whether Edelbacher should be sent to the 
gas chamber or receive the alternative penalty, life in prison without parole. 
</P>
<P>
Statements by the prosecutor indicating that jurors should not exercise their 
"moral judgments" in deciding the sentence were "gravely misleading," Justice 
Marcus M. Kaufman wrote in the court's lead opinion. 
</P>
<P>
The justices, however, rejected Edelbacher's contention that he should not have 
had to face the capital charge of murder for financial gain merely because he 
was trying to avoid the financial obligation of paying money owed in the 
settlement. Such a murder charge, he argued, should be limited to cases 
involving hired killers, murder for an inheritance or a killing for insurance 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
But the court, reaffirming past rulings, said the issue was only whether the 
murder had been committed in the expectation of obtaining a "desired financial 
gain." 
</P>
<P>
"It has been widely recognized that murder for financial gain is an especially 
vile crime for which the death penalty may appropriately be imposed," Kaufman 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
"The (ruling) urged by the defendant would result in an arbitrary and 
irrational distinction . . . since a killing to avoid a loss is as basely 
motivated and repugnant as a killing for a positive reward or profit." 
</P>
<P>
The decision marked the 19th reversal in 66 capital rulings by the court since 
the departure of Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird and two other court members 
defeated in the fall, 1986, election. 
</P>
<P>
In an unusual series of votes, all seven justices agreed that the charges and 
Edelbacher's conviction should be upheld. The narrow majority to overturn the 
death sentence was provided by Kaufman, writing a 90-page lead opinion; Justice 
Stanley Mosk, joined by Justice Allen E. Broussard in a separate concurring 
opinion, and Justice Edward A. Panelli, writing another separate concurring 
opinion. 
</P>
<P>
In dissent, Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas, joined by Justices John A. 
Arguelles and David N. Eagleson, contended that any procedural errors in the 
penalty phase of the trial were harmless and that Edelbacher's death sentence 
should be upheld. 
</P>
<P>
Edelbacher was married in 1977, but after the birth of a son the two separated 
and Lela Edelbacher filed for divorce. In May, 1980, Lela Edelbacher reported 
that he had raped her and Edelbacher was arrested and released on bail. A few 
days later, witnesses said, Edelbacher threatened to "blow her . . . head off." 
</P>
<P>
Later, Edelbacher was acquitted in the locally well-publicized rape case. 
Meanwhile, a dissolution settlement was reached in which Edelbacher retained 
the couple's 44-acre ranch but agreed to pay her $48,730.50 for her interest in 
the property. 
</P>
<P>
On the night of April 3, 1981, Lela Edelbacher, while in the bedroom of her 
parents' home, was struck in the back with a shotgun blast fired through the 
window. 
</P>
<P>
Edelbacher was charged with murder while lying in wait, murder for financial 
gain and solicitation to murder another woman who allegedly "knew too much" 
about the crime. (Edelbacher later pleaded guilty to that charge; there was no 
attempt on the woman's life.) The prosecution charged that Edelbacher killed 
his wife in the belief that he could avoid his debt to her, as well as sidestep 
a child-support payment of $700 by gaining custody of their son. 
</P>
<P>
In Monday's ruling, the court concluded that there was a "reasonable 
possibility" that the jury was misled as to how it should weigh the favorable 
and unfavorable factors in deciding whether the defendant should live or die. 
</P>
<P>
Kaufman said the trial judge, then-Superior Court Judge Hollis G. Best, had 
failed to make clear the jury was not to "mechanically" weigh aggravating 
factors against mitigating factors. Jurors should have been told that they have 
discretion to "assign whatever value they deem appropriate" to such factors and 
to take personal responsibility for their individual decisions, the justice 
said.

49ER FANS EXUBERANT OVER 3RD BOWL VICTORY 
</P>

<P>
Blowing horns and waving signs, tens of thousands of noisy fans flooded the 
city Monday to cheer the San Francisco 49ers, last-minute winners of Super Bowl 
XXIII, as they paraded down Market Street in cable cars and antique 
automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
The California Highway Patrol, relying on a helicopter spotter above the 1 
1/4-mile parade route, estimated that 250,000 people filled the sidewalks or 
watched from windows and rooftops. 
</P>
<P>
More revelers perched atop phone booths, news stands and trash receptacles or 
shimmied up leafless trees and ornate, cast-iron light standards, which were 
decorated with 49er flags and balloons in the team's colors, red and gold. 
</P>
<P>
"Was it worth the wait? Are you kidding? Definitely!" said Tommy Barrett, a 
49er fan from San Francisco. "The only disappointment is that they didn't have 
a rally at City Hall like they did in the past. But it really doesn't matter. 
We're dedicated fans, 49er faithfuls." 
</P>
<P>
"Bud, too," added Barrett's girlfriend, Etta Roberts of San Francisco, 
referring to their pit bulldog, which sported a 49er championship T-shirt. 
Humans in the crowd were similarly attired in all manner of souvenir garb: 
T-shirts, helmets, sweat shirts, hats, jackets -- even helmet-shaped umbrellas. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco Police reported one arrest after the late-afternoon parade and 
they characterized the crowd as noisy but good-natured. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Bill Walsh, team owner Eddie DeBartolo and Mayor Art Agnos led the parade 
in an antique Jaguar Phaeton, with Walsh drawing roars by waving the hefty 
silver Vince Lombardi trophy awarded annually to the National Football League 
champions. 
</P>
<P>
Star quarterback Joe Montana rode in one of the 15 cable cars -- actually 
motorized replicas, because Market Street is not equipped to run real cable 
cars -- with his wife, Jennifer, a local television personality, and their two 
daughters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pink Cadillac 
</P>
<P>
Wide receiver Jerry Rice, the Super Bowl's Most Valuable Player, followed in a 
1950s pink Cadillac convertible. Randy Cross, a popular offensive lineman who 
announced his retirement before the championship game, rode in a similar car. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco beat the Cincinnati Bengals, 20-16, with a 10-yard touchdown pass 
from Montana to wide receive John Taylor with just 34 seconds left in the game. 
It was the closest Super Bowl score in a decade and the only last-minute 
come-from-behind victory in the history of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Although Monday's parade was the official city commemoration of the Super Bowl 
triumph, it was by no means San Francisco's only outpouring of joy. 
</P>
<P>
Spontaneous streetside victory parties began just minutes after the winning 
touchdown pass Sunday evening and continued to build over the next six hours 
until rain showers near midnight finally dampened celebrants' enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
Strangers kissed strangers, and streams of celebrants snaked down sidewalks 
exchanging a seemingly endless series of "high fives" with people moving the 
opposite way. 
</P>
<P>
Some people said they drove up to 35 miles to join the outpouring. Traffic in 
North Beach soon grew bad enough to back cars onto the Embarcadero Freeway, 
forcing the Highway Patrol to close that entire elevated highway. 
</P>
<P>
Despite 90 arrests Sunday night -- most for drunkenness -- police said there 
was relatively little violence or property damage. A few store windows were 
broken, two cars were overturned and a couple of outbreaks of bottle-throwing 
had to be quelled by swift musterings of helmeted riot officers. 
</P>
<P>
The tone was in marked contrast to similar festivities after 49er Super Bowl 
victories in 1982 and 1985. In both cases, police reported fights, many broken 
windows, minor looting and the setting of street corner bonfires by 
over-exuberant fans.

JUSTICES ALLOW COPTER SWEEPS FOR MARIJUANA

The Supreme Court Monday upheld police use of low-flying helicopters to detect 
marijuana plants, ruling that such searches do not violate a homeowner's right 
to privacy. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-4 ruling in a Florida case clears up most legal doubts about searches by 
hovering helicopters, which are employed widely by local and state authorities 
in California. 
</P>
<P>
While upholding the actions of the police pilot in the case before the court, 
the conservative majority left unresolved exactly how low a police helicopter 
could fly without violating the Fourth Amendment's ban on unreasonable searches 
and seizures. 
</P>
<P>
"The helicopter in this case (flying at 400 feet) was not violating the law," 
wrote Justice Byron R. White in a terse opinion, because Federal Aviation 
Administration rules permit helicopters to fly at that altitude. 
</P>
<P>
"No intimate details connected with the use of the home or curtilage (yard) 
were observed (by police) and there was no undue noise, wind or threat of 
injury. In these circumstances, there was no violation of the Fourth 
Amendment," he concluded. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling is in line with more than a dozen opinions in recent years giving 
police more authority in the war against drugs. In 1967, the Supreme Court said 
that the Fourth Amendment protects a citizen's "reasonable expectation of 
privacy" in his home, yard, automobile or person. But in recent opinions, the 
high court has narrowed the definition of what is reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the court has said in the last year that police can search garbage 
cans outside a home, baggage at airports and a closed container in an 
automobile -- all without search warrants. 
</P>
<P>
In the case decided Monday (Florida vs. Riley, 87-764), the Florida Supreme 
Court had ruled that police violated the Fourth Amendment by hovering at 400 
feet over a greenhouse owned by Michael Riley. State prosecutors appealed this 
conclusion and won the reversal. 
</P>
<P>
Justice William J. Brennan Jr., writing for himself and Justices Thurgood 
Marshall and John Paul Stevens, said that the court ruling raises the specter 
of "Big Brother is watching you" in George Orwell's "1984." He pointed out that 
the police in Orwell's totalitarian state used helicopters to "skim down 
between the roofs . . . snooping into people's windows." 
</P>
<P>
"Who can read this passage without a shudder, and without an instinctive 
reaction that it depicts life in some country other than ours?" Brennan asked. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Harry A. Blackmun filed a separate dissent arguing that police should 
have to demonstrate that their search was reasonable, rather than force the 
homeowner to prove it was unreasonable. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago the U.S. Supreme Court created some uncertainty about the 
legality of helicopter searches when it left standing a California appellate 
court ruling. In that case the state court threw out a marijuana-growing charge 
against a San Diego man because police spotted the plants from a helicopter 
flying at 400 feet. Neither the California Supreme Court nor the U.S. Supreme 
Court agreed to hear the prosecutor's appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Laurence Sullivan of the California attorney general's office said that 
helicopters are used widely in the state's Campaign Against Marijuana Planting. 
However, state officials have agreed in a court consent decree that they would 
not fly below 500 feet, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But city police and county sheriff's departments use helicopters that fly at 
lower altitudes, he added. "This ruling says that it is not a per se Fourth 
Amendment violation to be flying at 400 feet over someone's back yard," said 
Sullivan, a supervising deputy attorney general in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Police Department does not have a policy limiting how low 
police can fly in helicopters. "It is a case-by-case situation depending on 
what is required. We don't have a minimal altitude policy," said Lt. Fred 
Nixon, an LAPD spokesman.

The highest-ranking woman official in the Soviet Union revealed herself at a 
rare press conference Monday to be a cultural conservative whose husband does 
the housework while she puts in 12- to 14-hour days as a deputy premier and 
non-voting member of the ruling Communist Party Politburo. 
</P>
<P>
Alexandra P. Biryukova, 59, who last October became the first woman elevated 
into top party office in more than 27 years, told Soviet and foreign reporters 
that the government plans to double or even triple the production of scarce 
consumer goods by the year 2005. 
</P>
<P>
But the journalists seemed more interested in her views on women's issues, 
peppering her during a 95-minute press conference with questions about the 
common use of women in heavy manual labor, opportunities for women in politics 
and the extraordinarily large number of abortions in the Soviet Union.

<P>
Out of all these issues, only the subject of abortions appeared to stir her. 
She called the current situation "abnormal," the result primarily of inadequate 
supplies of contraceptives. Referring to a recently published letter from a 
woman who described her humiliating and painful treatment while seeking an 
abortion, Biryukova said she had ordered that the patient be located so that 
the doctors and clinics involved could be dealt with. 
</P>
<P>
Government figures show that 90% of first pregnancies are aborted, and the 
total number of abortions here is reportedly many times higher than that in any 
other industrialized country -- 6.5 million a year, or about four times the 
number reported in the United States. An even higher Soviet figure, 8 million 
annually, was recently reported by the weekly publication Ogonyok. 
</P>
<P>
Biryukova said the number of abortions each year is about equal to the number 
of births in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"It is abnormal, and we must correct this situation in the next two or three 
years by developing contraceptives," she said. 
</P>
<P>
As for the many women who work at such jobs as shoveling snow and repairing 
roads, the official acknowledged that "quite often I do see women working on 
jobs that should be occupied by men." However, she added, "we have a whole 
program of eliminating female employment in heavy occupations," and she 
predicted that "in a few years we'll overcome that problem." 
</P>
<P>
Whether there are enough women in high party and government posts "depends on 
how you look at it," she said. But she stressed that it is not only the male 
establishment that determines how far a woman can go in the Soviet system. "It 
depends also on the desire of the woman." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the privileges attached to her high office, Biryukova smiled and 
said that the greatest privilege of all Soviet officials is to work tirelessly 
"to make our people happier, more free." 
</P>
<P>
As for recreation, she said, "I practically don't have any leisure." She said 
she works 12- to 14-hour days, often including weekends. She has no maid, she 
said. "My housework is done by my husband," who is a retired military officer. 
The couple has no children. 
</P>
<P>
Pressed for her opinion of exiled Soviet author Alexander Solzhenitsyn, 
Biryukova said that she had "not read a lot of his works, but I did read some 
of them. . . . Personally, I do not like Solzhenitsyn." 
</P>
<P>
She said she prefers the more elegant prose of the late Leo Tolstoy and 
Valentin Rasputin, a conservative, contemporary Russian author known among 
other things for his depictions of village life. 
</P>
<P>
Born of peasant parents near Moscow, Biryukova studied at a textile institute 
and became a party member in 1956. She began full-time political work in the 
trade union movement, where she held progressively higher offices until 
becoming secretary of the Communist Party's Central Committee responsible for 
overseeing light and consumer industries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Tense' Consumer Market 
</P>
<P>
She continues to have special responsibilities in those areas as deputy premier 
and chairman of the government's office of social development issues. 
</P>
<P>
Echoing what has become a common theme among Soviet leaders, Biryukova stressed 
Monday that "the situation in the country's consumer market is now tense." She 
said the unsatisfied demand for goods and services here is estimated at the 
equivalent of more than $110 billion, equal to nearly five months' output of 
non-agricultural consumer goods at current production rates. 
</P>
<P>
Biryukova blamed the shortages on years of "one-sided orientation of the Soviet 
economy," stressing production of industrial rather than consumer goods. 
</P>
<P>
The government is trying to change that and recently decided to convert all or 
part of 300 enterprises in the machinery, defense, fuel and power industries to 
the production of consumer goods, she said.

ARGENTINE TROOPS BATTLE REBELS WHO SEIZED ARMY BASE

Argentine troops backed by tanks and artillery stormed an army base near the 
capital Monday and battled gunmen who had seized the facility in a dawn raid, 
the military said. Officials said the attackers were leftist guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
At least 20 of the estimated 50 gunmen were killed or wounded and fighting was 
reportedly continuing at the La Tablada base, headquarters of the 3rd 
Mechanized Infantry Regiment, the independent news agency Diarios y Noticias 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials said at least four soldiers were killed and that 28 others, 
including soldiers, police officers and one reporter, were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
The rebels smashed through the base's main gates in a stolen Coca-Cola truck 
shortly after dawn, lobbing grenades at buildings where soldiers slept, news 
agencies reported. Witnesses said the truck and six cars that followed it 
carried 30 to 50 men and women. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the regiment's 300 officers and troops, mostly conscripts, were allowed 
to spend the weekend off the base, situated 12 miles north of the capital, and 
only about 100 were at La Tablada at the time of the attack, the government 
news agency Telam reported. 
</P>
<P>
Buenos Aires provincial police quickly surrounded the base, evacuated area 
residents, diverted traffic and took up sharpshooter positions in nearby homes 
and buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Horacio Jaunarena and army chief Gen. Francisco Gassino 
immediately sent elite troops to assist soldiers and provincial police. 
</P>
<P>
About noon, two small tanks rolled onto the base and opened fire on the 
officers' club. Soldiers fired mortar rounds and artillery shells onto the 
buildings held by the gunmen. The shells caved in at least one building, and 
the regimental cafeteria, cells and guard post were in flames, news agencies 
reported. Dozens of the conscripts at the base reportedly escaped during the 
counterattack. 
</P>
<P>
By early evening, the gunmen were isolated in the officers' club, chapel and 
armory, although some took up positions in buildings and trees outside the base 
and sniped at soldiers and police, Diarios y Noticias reported. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said dozens of people in civilian clothes, police agents, army 
soldiers and raiders roamed the base shooting at each other. 
</P>
<P>
Soldiers held back from an all-out attack on the buildings for fear of injuring 
conscripts thought to be held hostage by the attackers, news agencies reported. 
</P>
<P>
The rebels distributed pamphlets praising ousted Lt. Col. Aldo Rico, who led 
short-lived uprisings in April, 1987, and January, 1988. The leaflets praised 
Rico's so-called New Argentine Army and said "Long Live Rico!" and "Long Live 
Seineldin!" 
</P>
<P>
Col. Mohamed Ali Seineldin led a four-day military insurrection last month. 
Both he and Rico are now in military prison. 
</P>
<P>
But Cesar Jaroslavsky, leader of the ruling Radical Civic Union in the House of 
Deputies, said at least one of the attackers was a member of the leftist 
Peoples Revolutionary Army, which engaged soldiers in open battle a decade ago 
but has been inactive since. 
</P>
<P>
Military sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, also said the rebels were 
leftist guerrillas. Government officials said they may be members of Montonero, 
another leftist group that carried out kidnapings, bombings and assassinations 
in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Ministry spokesmen rejected the possibility that soldiers sided with 
the attackers. They also said the attack was not a military insurrection 
against President Raul Alfonsin, who has put down three such uprisings in the 
past 21 months. 
</P>
<P>
By late afternoon, there were no reports of attacks on other bases in the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
The assault was treated as a potentially grave threat, and the most serious of 
its kind since Montonero and the Peoples Revolutionary Army attacked an army 
arsenal near Buenos Aires in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
Additional troops were dispatched to Government House in downtown Buenos Aires, 
where Alfonsin was at work Monday, and the president's official residence in 
suburban Olivos.

Underground Palestinian leaders said in a leaflet circulated Monday that they 
will escalate their rebellion despite the army's tough new measures to quell 
the 13-month revolt. 
</P>
<P>
In the city of Nablus in the occupied West Bank, assailants hurled firebombs 
into an Israeli bank, injuring several Arab employees and causing minor 
property damage, the army said. Arab reports said four employees were treated 
for burns or smoke inhalation. 
</P>
<P>
In the underground leaflet circulated in the occupied territories, the Unified 
National Leadership of the Uprising rejected Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin's 
proposal to hold elections in the occupied territories in return for an end to 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
The leaflet said the proposal "will be sent to the garbage dump of history." 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, head of the rightist Likud Party, also 
criticized Rabin's plan. 
</P>
<P>
"I hear that all the Arabs reject this plan," Shamir told Israel Radio. "I 
would not propose that we enter into a whirlpool of arguments about a thing 
that stands no chance of coming into being." 
</P>
<P>
Shamir's closest ally, Foreign Minister Moshe Arens, said Israel's peace plan 
still is being formulated. 
</P>
<P>
Uprising leaders said in their leaflet that an Israeli agreement to an 
international conference with PLO participation is required for an end to 
anti-Israeli violence. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the army announced that it will destroy the homes of stone-throwers 
and fire plastic bullets at fleeing assailants and protesters who build stone 
barricades. 
</P>
<P>
A 33-year-old man was shot with a plastic bullet Monday in the West Bank 
village of Jabaa, and four Palestinians were wounded in the occupied Gaza Strip 
when army troops opened fire to halt stone throwing, Arab hospital officials 
said.

Abortion rights groups Monday distributed fortune cookies filled with reasons 
to support state-financed abortions for poor women, the day after the 16th 
anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing abortions. 
</P>
<P>
"It's letting them know that it makes good political choice to vote 
pro-choice," said Shireen Miles, state coordinator for the National 
Organization for Women. 
</P>
<P>
The cookies were distributed to members of the Legislature, which for the last 
11 years has tried to restrict abortions under the state's Medi-Cal health care 
program. Each year, the state Supreme Court has overturned the restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
The cookies contained statements and poll results indicating broad public 
support for abortion rights, Miles said.

Pleased that voters have approved building a new, domed stadium, Mayor Henry G. 
Cisneros said he may run for re-election, although he earlier said he would 
leave politics because of personal problems. 
</P>
<P>
Cisneros said Sunday he would decide whether to enter the May 2 election 
contest after he talks with former Mayor Lila Cockrell, who already has 
announced her candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
Cockrell is considered the front-runner and has only one announced opponent, 
insurance businessman Carl Mauthe. 
</P>
<P>
Cisneros, a prominent Latino twice considered for the Democratic Party's vice 
presidential nomination, said he will review his options during a trip to 
Massachusetts this week. 
</P>
<P>
Last October, Cisneros, who is married, acknowledged having a close personal 
relationship with political fund-raiser Linda Medlar, who also is married. The 
previous month, he said he would abandon politics in order to spend more time 
with his young son, John Paul, who is in poor health. 
</P>
<P>
Cisneros answered questions about his political plans as he met with reporters 
after a sales tax referendum to build the $174-million Alamodome stadium was 
passed Saturday.

ROBERTI APPOINTMENTS REFLECT LITTLE CHANGE

There were no major changes in leadership Monday as Senate President Pro Tem 
David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) announced appointments of senators to 24 
standing committees for the new legislative session. 
</P>
<P>
The Rules Committee, which Roberti chairs, did create one new five-member 
committee, Veterans Affairs, which will be headed by Sen. Wadie P. Deddeh 
(D-Bonita). 
</P>
<P>
Deddeh previously chaired the Transportation Committee, but was demoted last 
year because he voted for confirmation of Republican Rep. Daniel E. Lungren of 
Long Beach, Gov. George Deukmejian's first choice for the vacant state 
treasurer's job. He was replaced as head of the Transportation Committee by 
Sen. Quentin I. Kopp (I-San Francisco), who cast a key vote with the majority 
against Lungren. 
</P>
<P>
Chairing the Senate's committees will be 21 Democrats, two Republicans and 
Kopp, the Senate's only Independent. Democrats outnumber Republicans in the 
upper house, 24-15. 
</P>
<P>
The two GOP committee heads are Sens. Marian Bergeson of Newport Beach, 
chairwoman of the Local Government Committee, and Edward R. Royce of Anaheim, 
who chairs the Constitutional Amendments panel. Kopp continues as chairman of 
the Transportation Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Regarding the new Veterans Affairs Committee to be headed by Deddeh, Roberti 
said: "Issues affecting veterans in California are growing with each day and 
are becoming more complex. It is fitting that the Senate deal with these 
matters on a regular basis through the standing committee process." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) downgraded 
the Assembly Veterans Affairs Committee to a subcommittee because, according to 
an aide, Brown felt the panel did not have enough bills to consider.

The Super Bowl put a damper on business for the nation's theaters over the 
weekend. "Sunday receipts held the week's numbers down," said John Krier, 
president of Exhibitor Relations. Despite that, MGM/UA's "Rain Man" continued a 
strong showing, grossing $7 million at 1,509 theaters, an average of $4,641 per 
screen. Universal's "Twins" grossed $4.8 million at 1,640 theaters, an average 
of $2,940 per screen. 
</P>
<P>
* New Line added 21 cities to its play list for "Torch Song Trilogy" over the 
weekend, with good results. Now showing at 44 theaters, the film grossed 
$269,803, an average of $6,131 per screen.

MONTEVECCHI'S TOUR OF THE 'BOULEVARD' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Life is a cabaret for Liliane Montevecchi. 
</P>
<P>
From Roland Petit's Ballet de Paris to almost 10 years in the Folies Bergeres, 
to New York's Paris Ballet, a long-term contract at MGM, the concert version of 
Stephen Sondheim's "Follies" and a 1983 Tony Award for the musical "Nine," the 
Parisian entertainer has had her share of opening nights, curtain calls, high 
kicks and throaty ballads. On Sunday, her one-woman "On the Boulevard" will 
launch the Pasadena Playhouse's Balcony Theatre season. 
</P>
<P>
The titular boulevard belongs to Paris after dark, the setting for the New 
York-based actress-singer's musical "tour" -- accompanied by the sounds of 
Sondheim, Aznavour, Porter, Gershwin, Brel, Herman, Yeston, Newley &amp; 
Bricusse and Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot tell you what the show is till you see it," Montevecchi said over the 
phone from New York, where she is completing a mini-version of the show in an 
engagement at the Rainbow Room. "It is a very personal thing. It is about my 
heart, my singing, the way I do a song. Each song tells a story -- the story of 
my life." 
</P>
<P>
Montevecchi credits director Tommy Tune with the confident persona she brings 
to the show. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the first time I wear my own hair," she said proudly. "I always wear a 
turban or a wig. But Mr. Tune told me, 'It's time to be yourself, to be you.' I 
was afraid, you know. When I was in the Folies Bergeres, we had all these 
extravagant gowns and sequins. . . . But he said, 'Trust yourself, because you 
have what I like.' I guess I had to have somebody telling me that before I 
could (believe it)." 
</P>
<P>
In the show -- which she has dedicated to her late mother -- Montevecchi also 
says she feels a palpable give-and-take with the audience. 
</P>
<P>
"They're interested, they care, they're there -- healthy and listening," she 
said. "They give me so much, and I give them much more in return. I think I'm 
open all the time to suggestions that tickle my fancy, adding different colors 
to my rainbow. I'm always saying, 'Somebody, give me another color.' 
Vulnerable? Ooh-la-la. If they don't like me, it's awful. Then I cannot do what 
I do. So it is very fragile. But that's OK. I take my chances." 
</P>
<P>
Montevecchi is also looking forward to taking her chances in Los Angeles, where 
then-MGM producer John Houseman first brought her for a screen test in 1952. 
(Resulting film credits include "The Glass Slipper," "Daddy Long Legs," "Meet 
Me in Las Vegas" and "The Young Lions.") "I was spoiled to death in Hollywood," 
she said with a laugh. "I had many wonderful friends -- and many wonderful 
things happened to me there. So I'm happy to hear that some of these friends 
are still alive!" 
</P>
<P>
Although her career has encompassed singing, dancing and acting -- in various 
mediums -- it was as a ballerina that Montevecchi established herself. 
</P>
<P>
"Ballet gave me the discipline and respect of theater," she said. "I think it's 
the best place to start, because it's so hard to be a ballerina. If we miss the 
first plie, we miss everything. We have to arrive on time, we cannot eat too 
much or drink too much, we cannot (live) life too much. It's sort of like a 
nunnery. But it's also extraordinarily rewarding. Nothing can touch the ballet 
in that way. I still go to dance class every day. I have to." 
</P>
<P>
In a profession dictated by looks as much as talent, Montevecchi has made peace 
with her inner and outer selves. 
</P>
<P>
"Being a ballerina, I'm constantly in front of a mirror," she said 
matter-of-factly. "So I have to like what I see in the mirror -- otherwise I'd 
never go to class again. I'm getting older," she said, while firmly but 
politely declining to give her age. "You cannot help that. I have to accept it 
the best I can. So I rest, I don't put junk in my body. I don't surround myself 
with people I shouldn't. And I never let down my discipline or love of theater. 
That's always there."

A leaky cargo door seal caused the cabin of a Braniff jetliner bound for Kansas 
City to depressurize, forcing the airliner to return to Dallas-Ft. Worth 
International Airport, a Braniff spokesman said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
None of the 51 passengers or crew of five aboard Flight 548 were injured 
Sunday, although air masks dropped from overhead and the Boeing 737 made a 
steep descent from 31,000 to 10,000 feet, Braniff spokeswoman Irma Ellis said.

HOUSE MEMBERS MORE LIBERAL, ADA SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The House of Representatives was more liberal than ever in 1988, signaling good 
prospects this year for improving long-neglected social programs, Americans for 
Democratic Action said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
While the Senate became more conservative in President Ronald Reagan's final 
year in office, liberal voting records were not a handicap for senators seeking 
reelection, and a high-ranking liberal, Sen. George J. Mitchell (D-Me.), was 
chosen to be majority leader, the independent political organization said. 
</P>
<P>
The ADA score card on 20 key issues showed that the House had a record-high 
"liberal quotient" of 52% last year, up by a single percentage point from 1987, 
while the Senate's rating dropped from 53% in 1987 to 48% in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Figures Bode Well' 
</P>
<P>
"The prospects for holding President Bush accountable on his campaign pledge to 
create a 'kinder, gentler nation' appear excellent," said Marc Pearl, ADA 
national director. "The figures bode well for positive action on the critical 
issues that even President Bush raised during the campaign: child care, 
education and the environment." 
</P>
<P>
Pearl criticized the last Congress for not acting on campaign finance reform, a 
minimum wage increase, handgun restrictions, parental leave and further 
sanctions against South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
"A new Congress and a new President have the responsibility to restore the 
social and economic balance that was so severely shredded during the Reagan 
years," Pearl said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the results for 1988, we are optimistic that the 101st Congress will 
have the muscle to do it," he added. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Perfect Records 
</P>
<P>
The ADA said that 24 members of the House and two senators -- Patrick J. Leahy 
(D-Vt.) and Claiborne Pell (D-R.I.) -- had perfect 100% voting records last 
year. Mitchell earned a 95. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, 25 Republicans in the House received zero ratings, including Jack 
Kemp, secretary-designate of housing and urban development. In the Senate, 11 
members got a zero from the ADA, including Vice President Dan Quayle. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the ADA said that Democrats averaged 75% in the House and 72% in the 
Senate, compared to 20% scores for Republicans in both chambers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Issued Since 1947 
</P>
<P>
The ADA, founded by a group of anti-Communist liberals including Eleanor 
Roosevelt and the late Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota, has been issuing 
its congressional score card since 1947. It covers a wide range of issues from 
civil rights to foreign policy and is one of the oldest and best-known of 
interest-group ratings of liberal and conservative voting patterns. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Don Edwards (D-San Jose), who has compiled a 100% ADA voting record in 
every year since 1982, said that he expects Bush to follow moderate Republican 
policies of the kind once championed by the late Nelson A. Rockefeller. 
</P>
<P>
"George Bush's inaugural speech was a Democratic speech," Edwards said in an 
interview. "In a quarter-century here, I've never been more encouraged about 
world peace, disengaging from the Soviet Union and finding money for these 
starving social programs. The Cold War's over."

CALTRANS ORDERED TO PAY VICTIM $1.5 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Orange County jury has ordered the state to pay $1.5 million to a former 
mayor of Fullerton who was injured in a 1983 car accident on a freeway in 
Anaheim Hills when another car blew a tire, crossed the median and struck his 
car. 
</P>
<P>
The judge in the case, however, has not yet entered a judgment because he is 
considering whether to deduct $300,000 in uninsured motorist's benefits paid 
out to Everette C. Farnsworth from the jury award, said Larry Danielson, 
assistant chief counsel to the California Transportation Department. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no obligation to pay anything until the judgment becomes final," 
Danielson said. 
</P>
<P>
Farnsworth declined comment Monday on the case. 
</P>
<P>
The jury issued its ruling in Superior Court in Santa Ana on Friday. Danielson 
said he expects the judgment to be entered within the next 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans is also considering an appeal of the verdict or asking for a new trial 
because the agency disagrees with the plaintiff's contention that the accident 
site was dangerous and that a barrier should have been erected there, said 
Anthony J. Ruffolo, deputy chief counsel for Caltrans.

<P>
While undergoing brain surgery, Farnsworth, 68, suffered a stroke that left him 
blind and partially paralyzed on the left side. The accident occurred on the 
Riverside Freeway about a mile east of the Imperial Highway exit.

Farnsworth served on Fullerton's City Council from 1958 to 1966 and as mayor 
from 1964 to 1966.

PACIFIC BELL STARTS VIETNAMESE SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vietnamese community leaders have been invited by Pacific Bell to help 
celebrate on Wednesday the opening of the telephone company's Vietnamese 
Service Center in Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
The new center, which is part of the telephone company's Asian marketing plan, 
will have eight Vietnamese-speaking employees taking orders for residential 
telephone service and answering billing inquires in Orange, Riverside and San 
Bernardino counties, company spokeswoman Linda Bonniksen said. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Bell will hold an open house at the center, which is in the Pacific 
Bell office complex in Tustin at 1472 Edinger Ave., in Room 2150 of Building 2. 
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese Service Center is expected to expand its services to include San 
Diego County in February and Los Angeles County in June. By 1990, the center 
expects to serve the estimated 278,000 Vietnamese living in California, said 
Reed L. Royalty, Pacific Bell area vice president.

ARSON IS PROBABLE CAUSE OF APARTMENT FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Arson was the probable cause of a fire that forced seven families to flee their 
apartments early Sunday morning, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze, which started about 1:18 a.m., caused an estimated $40,000 damage to 
six carports and cars at the apartment complex in the 1100 block of North East 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities were continuing their investigation and had no suspects, Anaheim 
city spokeswoman Barbara Burke said. 
</P>
<P>
The apartment complex was also the site of a Dec. 7 fire that was caused by a 
short circuit in a stereo system, fire officials said. No one was injured in 
either blaze. 
</P>
<P>
The Sunday fire caused power outages in many apartments at the complex, so 
officials of the county chapter of the American Red Cross relocated all 33 
residents there to motels in Anaheim. Red Cross officials said residents 
probably would be able to return to their apartments today.

ROBBERS TAKE CASH FROM CREDIT UNION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two men robbed an employees' credit union Monday and escaped with an 
undetermined amount of cash, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton police said one of the robbers carried a small handgun and demanded 
money from a teller during the 11:40 a.m. robbery of the Beckman Employees 
Credit Union, in the 400 block of East Imperial Highway. 
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported in the heist, and no shots were fired. 
</P>
<P>
The men fled on a motorcycle last seen headed west on Imperial Highway, Police 
Lt. Bud Lathrop said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the suspects was described as a white male in his early 30s, 5-foot-9, 
with a medium build and black hair. He wore a sports jacket and black pants, 
Lathrop said. The other was described only as wearing a red motorcycle helmet. 
</P>
<P>
The motorcycle was described by witnesses as medium-size "with a lot of 
chrome," Lathrop said.

APPEAL COURT ORDERS NEW SENTENCING IN ABDUCTION OF OFFICER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An appellate court, finding that the trial judge had erred, ordered Monday that 
an Arizona man be resentenced for abducting an Irvine police officer at 
gunpoint. But the court refused to throw out his conviction altogether. 
</P>
<P>
Edward M. Reyna Jr., 46, of Peoria, Ariz., drew a sentence of nearly 13 years 
following an attempted murder conviction for wrestling a police officer to the 
ground, grabbing his .357-caliber revolver and trying to kidnap him and take 
him to Mexico on Sept. 19, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Officer Found Cocaine 
</P>
<P>
A fugitive from Arizona, Reyna was pulled over along the San Diego Freeway 
after Irvine Police Officer Thomas Friday observed Reyna's car weaving in 
traffic. After the officer searched Reyna and discovered several vials of 
cocaine, Reyna managed to grab Friday's gun and hold it, cocked, at the young 
officer's head, threatening to kill him. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, who testified that he was ordered at gunpoint to drive Reyna to Mexico, 
was able to bring the vehicle to a screeching halt and then knock the gun away 
from Reyna, wrestling him out of the car. Another officer, who arrived on the 
scene as the pair struggled beside the roadway, then aided in the arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, who was 26 at the time of the incident and was serving only his second 
week alone on patrol, was lauded for heroics that later were dramatized in 
police training films. But the incident took its toll emotionally. Friday took 
a medical leave from the force because of mental stress. He has not returned to 
the job. 
</P>
<P>
Reyna appealed his conviction for attempted murder, maintaining that Friday 
discovered the vials of cocaine through an unlawful search. Reyna also 
complained that his attorney was unfairly prevented from trying to discredit 
Friday's testimony by questioning him during a preliminary hearing about what 
effect the attack had had on the officer's career. 
</P>
<P>
But the 4th District Court of Appeal in Santa Ana, in its decision released 
Monday, rejected both those claims as it upheld Reyna's conviction. 
</P>
<P>
The justices did, however, find fault with Reyna's sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Superior Court Judge James K. Turner, citing Reyna's history of 
criminal convictions, ordered him to serve 12 years and 8 months in prison for 
attempted murder, kidnaping and the use of a gun. 
</P>
<P>
But the appellate court on Monday ruled that Reyna essentially faced a double 
jeopardy. It faulted Turner for citing Reyna's use of a gun both in imposing 
the maximum possible sentence for attempted murder, and in adding an extra 2 
years to his total sentence for using a gun. 
</P>
<P>
Reyna now must be resentenced. But Mathew Vallance, who prosecuted the case, 
said he expects Reyna to receive the same sentence when he returns to Superior 
Court. Vallance said other factors in the incident besides Reyna's use of a gun 
could be considered in imposing the maximum cumulative penalty. 
</P>
<P>
"My opinion (in February, 1987) was that he should have gotten the maximum 
sentence, and that remains the same today," said Vallance, who is now in 
private practice. "I wish the judge could have given him more than he got." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'This Guy Is Dangerous' 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Michael White of the Irvine Police Department, which supported Judge 
Turner's imposition of the maximum sentence, said the appellate ruling was a 
disappointment. "This guy is dangerous, and he should be put away for a long 
time," White said. 
</P>
<P>
Friday could not be reached for comment after the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
In September, 1987, the city of Irvine sued the manufacturer of the Police 
Department's holsters, Hoyt Holster Co. of Costa Mesa, charging that the 
company had reneged on its promise to provide "unequaled safety" for officers. 
The suit is pending in Orange County Superior Court.

HOPE KEPT ALIVE FOR PILOT MISSING 22 YEARS IN VIETNAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Barbie Robertson held a large photo of a young Air Force fighter pilot. 
</P>
<P>
Seated in her quiet living room in Tustin, Robertson looked at the photo as she 
reflected on recent news reports that U.S. technical experts had ended 10 days 
of investigation in Vietnam without finding any live U.S. MIAs -- servicemen 
missing in action from the Vietnam War era. 
</P>
<P>
Robertson said Monday that it is just one more disappointment. But it does not 
prove one way or another that her MIA husband is not alive, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We know there are American men over there who are still alive," she insisted. 
"Forget about bringing back bones. There are men over there who are still 
alive. Our country can't close the door on that war until all those men are 
accounted for. Where are those servicemen who are still alive?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Youthful in Photo 
</P>
<P>
A film of tears in her eyes, Robertson motioned to the picture of the young 
fighter pilot. 
</P>
<P>
"This is how my husband, Johnny, looked," she said in a steady voice. "I still 
dream about his coming home. I see him walking in. I see where the oxygen mask 
pressed down on his face after flying all day. In the dream, I have the pitcher 
of martinis waiting just as we did in those days when he was 35, and I was the 
perfect Air Force wife waiting at home. Oh, God, it would be so wonderful if he 
were to walk in. It would be so wonderful for him to see how grand the children 
turned out, how they grew up. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
For 22 years now, Robertson said, she has lived with the possibility that her 
husband, Air Force Col. John L. Robertson, would someday walk back into her 
life. 
</P>
<P>
"Johnny was shot down over North Vietnam, 27 miles northeast of Hanoi, on Sept. 
16, 1966," she said. "The other pilot in the F-4 with him survived and was 
taken prisoner." 
</P>
<P>
Barbie Robertson said there are many indications that her husband also 
survived. For many years, John Robertson was listed as missing in action. But 
in the mid-1970s, she said, the Air Force officially "declared all of the ones 
still missing as dead." 
</P>
<P>
His body has never been found. He is one of 2,383 Americans listed as missing 
in Southeast Asia -- 13 years after the last U.S. troops left Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the U.S. State and Defense departments, in one of the last acts of 
the outgoing Reagan Administration, issued a 22-page report saying that no 
evidence has been found to indicate that North Vietnam held any American 
prisoners after 1973. 
</P>
<P>
But the report also acknowledged that it may be impossible to ever account for 
many of the MIAs. "Because of . . . discrepancies and the lack of knowledge 
about many cases, the Reagan Administration has concluded that we must operate 
under the assumption that at least some of the missing could have survived . . 
. ," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Robertson said emphatically that she does not believe the United States has 
done all it could to locate the missing servicemen, including her husband. And 
while she considers herself "still a loyal service wife," she said she no 
longer trusts the government. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has not been open or sympathetic about the MIA situation, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is still concern about American hostages in the Middle East, and I agree 
there should be," she said. "But what about our men in Vietnam? The men who are 
still alive over there are hostages, also." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
She Has Her Reasons 
</P>
<P>
Robertson said she does not believe that the latest mission of U.S. experts to 
Vietnam has closed the book on MIAs. 
</P>
<P>
"There are many reasons why Americans are being held over there (Vietnam)," 
Robertson suggested. "For one thing, Vietnam may be using them as negotiating 
chips, maybe for repatriation money. Then there is all the technical equipment 
that our government abandoned when it left Vietnam. Vietnam had no one to 
repair it. There are reports that some Americans have been seen having to work 
on that equipment over there." 
</P>
<P>
Robertson said that governmental pride on both sides also may figure into the 
mystery of the MIAs. 
</P>
<P>
"Our government has said they are all dead. Does it want to admit now that it 
was wrong and that it abandoned all those men over there? Could it ever get men 
to fight again when it was proved that it had abandoned so many men for so 
long? 
</P>
<P>
"And as for Vietnam," she continued, " . . . Vietnam has said there are no more 
men alive. Would it want to lose face and admit that this is not true?" 
</P>
<P>
So Barbie Robertson, her children and her grandchildren still ponder the fate 
of John Robertson. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband's co-pilot was freed 7 years after their aircraft was shot down. 
But Robertson said the man, who now is living somewhere in New England, told 
her that he had no idea what became of John Robertson. 
</P>
<P>
"He is still such a big part of our family," she said of her missing husband. 
"When we get together, we always talk about him." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Children Are Grown 
</P>
<P>
The children are now grown, she noted. Deborah is 33, married with two children 
and lives in Los Angeles; Barney is 32, married with one daughter and lives in 
Canyon Lake, and Stacey, 30, is married with one daughter and lives in Denver. 
The youngest, Shelby, 25, is married and living in Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
"Shelby was only 3 when her father was shot down," Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
Barbie Robertson grew up and met her future husband in the Seattle area, where 
she was living when his plane was shot down in 1966. She moved to Orange County 
17 years ago, she said, because "everything up there in Washington reminded me 
of Johnny." 
</P>
<P>
"We had known each other since our freshman year at the University of 
Washington. So I came down here to the sun. I started using lipstick again and 
trying to live." 
</P>
<P>
But she never remarried, despite the Air Force's declaration that Robertson 
could be presumed dead. "Where would I ever find someone like that fighter 
pilot again?" she asked. "There was the man who could laugh and dance all 
night, the man who did cartwheels when he finally got his orders to Vietnam, 
even though he was 35 then and really didn't have to go. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Still Hopeful 
</P>
<P>
"Where would I find a man like that?" 
</P>
<P>
Then, too, she cannot escape her belief that even after 22 years, Johnny 
Robertson might still be somewhere in Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
"If anyone could survive, he could," Robertson said. "He was mentally extremely 
tough; a brilliant man with great powers of concentration. And he could eat 
anything; if had to survive on bugs, he could do it. He had great strengths of 
survival, plus he was so crazy about his kids and his wife. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"But do I want him to have sat over there for 22 years, thinking his country 
has abandoned him?" she asked. "I don't think I could wish that on anyone."

<P>
Shelley Riehl has a sure-fire way of letting her 2-year-old son know instantly 
and precisely where she has just spotted a California gray whale migrating past 
the family's hilltop home in South Laguna. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell him it's either above the wires or below the wires," Riehl said, 
referring to power lines that are strung from pole to pole across the middle of 
her otherwise-magnificent ocean view. 
</P>
<P>
Within about 2 weeks, however, Riehl, 39, is going to have to find some other 
reference point for whale spotting. Work crews from San Diego Gas &amp; 
Electric Co. on Monday began tearing down overhead wires and poles in front of 
her home and dozens of others along Coast Highway in South Laguna. 
</P>
<P>
The lines and poles are being removed under a statewide program by the 
California Public Utilities Commission, in part to beautify scenic areas such 
as the Laguna Beach coastline, Laguna Beach City Manager Kenneth C. Frank said. 
</P>
<P>
The program also aims to reduce the number of power outages caused by such 
external factors as squirrels nibbling transmission cables, Frank said. 
Underground wiring is not as susceptible to such damage, he said. 
</P>
<P>
All but tiny stretches of Coast Highway at the extreme north and south ends of 
the city have been cleared of overhead wiring over the past decade, Frank said. 
</P>
<P>
Frank said the city also is working with Southern California Edison Co., the 
other major electrical utility for Laguna Beach, to remove overhead wiring from 
Laguna Canyon Road and the downtown business district. 
</P>
<P>
The work currently under way in South Laguna involves a two-phase removal 
project along a 1-mile stretch of Coast Highway between La Senda Drive and West 
Street, according to Mike Tao, SDG&amp;E district engineering supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
During the first phase of the current project, which began Monday, utility 
crews are removing wires between La Senda Drive and 5th Avenue, a process 
expected to take about 2 weeks, Tao said. Later this year, he said, overhead 
utility lines will be removed along a one-third-mile stretch between 5th Avenue 
and West Street. 
</P>
<P>
Also participating in the work are crews from General Telephone Co. and 
Dimension Cable, which use the same lines to distribute their services. Tao 
said the work crew that last finishes removing its wiring is responsible for 
removing the poles. 
</P>
<P>
Planning for the current project actually began more than 3 years ago, Tao 
said, when county officials representing South Laguna, before its annexation to 
Laguna Beach, petitioned SDG&amp;E to take out the overhead lines. 
</P>
<P>
Under a funding plan set up by the Public Utilities Commission, local entities 
such as Orange County or Laguna Beach are allocated a certain amount of money 
from a power company's budget for removing overhead lines. The county used 
$700,000 of its SDG&amp;E allocation to pay for the first phase of the current 
removal plan, Tao said. 
</P>
<P>
But when South Laguna was annexed by Laguna Beach on Dec. 31, 1987, the county 
balked at using another $600,000 of its allocation to finance the second phase 
of the plan, Tao said. Consequently, Laguna Beach city officials were asked to 
pick up the tab out of their allocation, he said.

COUNTY IRS AGENT, EX-BANKER ACCUSED OF FRAUD 
</P>

<P>
An Internal Revenue Service agent and a former bank president are accused of 
conspiring to arrange $134,000 in fraudulent personal loans to buy a house, 
sailboat and rental property, according to a criminal complaint. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley E. Gardner, 55, the former president and chief executive of San 
Dieguito National Bank, has agreed to plead guilty to one felony count of 
conspiracy to defraud the Encinitas-based institution, Assistant U.S. Atty. 
Stephen Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
Gardner, the U.S. Small Business Administration's Banker Advocate of the Year 
in 1984, was named in a one-count complaint filed Friday by the U.S. attorney's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
A federal grand jury also indicted Bobbie Jack Tadlock, an IRS agent in Orange 
County, on eight counts of conspiracy, false statements on loan applications 
and misapplication of bank funds. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors contend Gardner used his position at the bank to approve the phony 
loans between April, 1984, and May, 1985, in the names of Tadlock and another 
man, Leopold Salas, to purchase investment rental property in Dana Point, a 
26-foot sailboat and to pay off a trust deed on Gardner's home in Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
Gardner, a childhood friend and Whittier College fraternity brother of Tadlock, 
also allegedly laundered the loan proceeds through a series of other accounts 
at the northern San Diego County bank. 
</P>
<P>
Salas, also a longtime friend of Gardner, had minimal involvement in the 
alleged scheme and cooperated early in the 3-year investigation by the FBI and 
IRS, Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the amount of money involved does not make it a major fraud case, 
Clark said it needs to be prosecuted vigorously because it concerns "the 
violation of the fiduciary duty by a senior bank official and . . . similarly 
the involvement of misconduct by an IRS employee." 
</P>
<P>
Tadlock, who examines records and handles audits for the IRS, is expected to 
surrender himself for arraignment this week. An IRS spokeswoman said the agency 
hasn't taken any disciplinary action against Tadlock, 53, of Laguna Niguel, but 
an administrative review has begun. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'll be vindicated in this whole thing. I think it's all bank 
politics," said Tadlock, who declined to discuss specifics about the case. 
</P>
<P>
Gardner, who joined San Dieguito Bank as president in 1980 after holding 
similar positions with several other banks, resigned in 1985 after the bank's 
auditors discovered the allegedly fraudulent loans.

BOYS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: SWANWICK TONES UP FOR AN APPETIZING SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
With 1 minute 31 seconds left in the first half of Friday night's game, Tim 
Manning of Trabuco Hills High School stole the basketball and flipped a pass to 
Rick Swanwick. 
</P>
<P>
What followed was a monster dunk by Swanwick that may not have registered on 
the Richter scale, but certainly did in the minds of Swanwick's teammates. The 
Mustangs proceeded to outscore Laguna Hills, 35-18, the rest of the game for a 
66-48 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"The guys like it when I dunk," said Swanwick, The Times' athlete of the week. 
"It gets the crowd fired up and it seems to get us going." 
</P>
<P>
Dunks are an addition to Swanwick's game this season. So are blocked shots, 
tip-ins and anything else that involves jumping. 
</P>
<P>
This is the new Rick Swanwick, the sleek, greyhound model. He's 64 pounds 
lighter and a whole lot quicker. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Swanwick, a senior 6-foot 10-inch center, had 18 points and 19 
rebounds against Laguna Beach and followed with a 30-point, 21-rebound 
performance against Laguna Hills as the Mustangs moved into sole possession of 
first place in the Pacific Coast League. For the season, he's averaging 20 
points and 13 rebounds per game. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year I could dunk, but I needed at least two or three steps," Swanwick 
said. "Now, I can dunk anytime I want. At first, teammates really didn't notice 
a change. But when they started seeing me doing things like running and 
jumping, they noticed." 
</P>
<P>
Swanwick credits Trabuco Hills' Coach Rainer Wulf for his improved physique. 
</P>
<P>
In June of 1988, Wulf was named the Mustangs' coach. On arriving at the school, 
he took one look at Swanwick and put him on a scale. 
</P>
<P>
"He was 274 pounds and was bench-pressing 135 pounds," Wulf said. "Basically, 
we had a talk. I wanted to know if he was playing basketball just as something 
to do or was he serious. He said he wanted to be a player." 
</P>
<P>
To be a player, Wulf told him, he had to lose weight. A lot of weight. 
</P>
<P>
To begin with, Swanwick cut out that extra hamburger or two that had become a 
habit. He also started lifting weights, 2 hours per day, 6 days per week, to 
increase his strength. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to go to McDonald's and eat three Big Macs, a couple orders of fries 
and a couple of shakes," said Swanwick. "Then I would go out for dessert. Now I 
can barely get through one Big Mac." 
</P>
<P>
Swanwick now bench-presses 275 pounds and weighs 210, which is actually below 
what he feels is his ideal weight. He plans to add weight when he goes to 
college next year. But he will do so by lifting weights, not Big Macs. 
</P>
<P>
"During the summer, I would be tempted to head out for McDonald's and get a 
couple hamburgers," Swanwick said. "But then I would play in games against guys 
like Adam Keefe (Woodbridge) and others who were going to college. I would say, 
'I can do that.' If not having a Big Mac was what it was going to take, then 
that's what I was going to do." 
</P>
<P>
</P>

GIRLS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: SHANNON'S MOVE TO POINT GUARD PAYS DIVIDENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA CARTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Capistrano Valley Christian Coach Tim Shelton describes point guard Carrie 
Shannon as "a diamond in the rough." 
</P>
<P>
"She is still a junior and she has a long way to go," Shelton said. "She takes 
some silly shots every once in a while." 
</P>
<P>
Shelton moved Shannon from her off-guard position to point guard this season. 
</P>
<P>
She has taken awhile to get accustomed to the change, but last week she settled 
in, scoring a career-high 30 points to lead the Eagles to their first Olympic 
League victory this season. Capistrano Valley Christian defeated Santa 
Margarita, 46-43, Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Shannon, The Times' athlete of the week, had been averaging about 15 points a 
game. She said she had no idea she had scored so many Thursday night. "Everyone 
was coming up to me saying, 'Oh, you had 28.' Then they said I had 30 and I 
said, 'Oh, my God!' " 
</P>
<P>
Before high school, Shannon watched all the college and National Basketball 
Assn. games television had to offer. "I just love it," she said. When she got 
to Capistrano Valley Christian as a freshman, she decided it was time to get 
off the couch and onto the court. 
</P>
<P>
She plays softball and volleyball as well as basketball for the Eagles while 
carrying a 3.0 grade-point average. 
</P>
<P>
"The nice part about it for me is that basketball is her sport," Shelton said. 
"I think she would do just about anything to excel in basketball." 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles are off to a slow start at 4-9 overall and 1-6 in league play, which 
Shannon said has been frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been hard to keep going because you feel like you're practicing and 
nothing is being accomplished out on the court," she said. "But we have been 
able to get things going in the third and fourth quarters. We usually catch 
them a little bit and scare them. We can play with everybody, but we just have 
to get started earlier." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TOP PERFORMERS 
</P>
<P>
Amy Jalewalia scored a school-record 52 points Friday to break her record of 48 
points set in December. Jalewalia's big night came in La Quinta's 85-12 victory 
over Pacifica in Garden Grove League play. Wednesday, Jalewalia scored 39 
points in a 64-14 victory over Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
Keri Erkenbrach of Canyon made three 3-point shots and scored a team-high 21 
points Tuesday in a 54-44 victory that ended Foothill's 66-game, 7-year 
domination of Century League opponents 
</P>
<P>
Melody Mayfield of Saddleback scored 31 points and had 15 rebounds Thursday in 
a 63-31 Sea View League victory over Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
Kristen McDonald of Valencia made 14 of 16 shots on her way to a 30-point, 
10-rebound performance Tuesday in a 102-25 victory over Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Danielle Tomasick's three goals helped Newport Harbor edge Estancia, 3-2, 
Tuesday in a Sea View League soccer match. Tomasick has eight goals this season 
for Newport Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Tracy Greer accounted for three of Valencia's nine goals in a shutout of 
Savanna Thursday. The victory helped Valencia (4-0) remain undefeated in Orange 
League soccer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Carrie Shannon 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley Christian 
</P>
<P>
Position: Point guard 
</P>

this season with a 30-point performance in a 46-43 decision over Santa 
Margarita Thursday. 
</P>

CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTES; 
</P>
<P>
STAR PITCHER MARK BECK OUT FOR YEAR; 
</P>
<P>
HE REINJURES SHOULDER THAT FORCED WITHDRAWAL FROM OLYMPIC TRIALS 
</P>

<P>
Mark Beck, the Cal State Fullerton pitcher who withdrew from U.S. Olympic team 
competition with a shoulder injury last year, is out for the upcoming college 
season and will undergo surgery within 2 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Beck, a junior right-hander, had been rehabilitating the shoulder but reinjured 
it while throwing about 2 weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Beck, who set a Fullerton record for strikeouts in a season with 162 last year, 
was named a preseason All-American by Baseball America magazine. 
</P>
<P>
He had a 10-7 record last season for the Titans, who advanced to the semifinals 
of the College World Series. 
</P>
<P>
"We're certainly going to miss Mark this year, but we're still confident in our 
pitching staff," Fullerton Coach Larry Cochell said in a released statement. 
"We sure hate to lose a player of Mark's caliber, but this just means somebody 
else is going to have to step forward." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton will not make a decision on whether John Sneed, acting basketball 
coach, will get the job before opening the position for applications, Athletic 
Director Ed Carroll said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"We have an institutional commitment to affirmative action and an open-search 
process," Carroll said. "We are going to go through our regular process." 
</P>
<P>
Carroll, who publicly defined the selection process for the first time Monday, 
said the decision is not an indication of Sneed's chances. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton has begun publicizing the opening and expects to close application 
filings by late February. A coach could be named as soon as the day after the 
season ends, Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
Sneed, an assistant under George McQuarn for 8 seasons, was named acting coach 
after McQuarn resigned Nov. 3. He has said he is an applicant for the job since 
that day. ROBYN NORWOOD

COUNTY'S MEDIAN HOUSE PRICE RISES 2.8%, TO $237,114 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGORY CROUCH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The median price on the resale of a single-family home in Orange County 
increased 2.8% in December, to reach a record $237,114, the California Assn. of 
Realtors reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Sales, however, fell 12.8% from November's total. "That is a normal seasonal 
decrease," said Joel Singer, chief economist for the association. "In December, 
people don't want major changes in their lives, particularly because of the 
holiday season." 
</P>
<P>
Some real estate agents speculated that December's record price, up 32% from a 
year ago, may have been skewed by a slowdown in sales of 
moderate-to-lower-price houses, caused by higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Affluent Buyer' Is Remaining in the Market 
</P>
<P>
Michael Meyer, managing partner of Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co., an accounting 
concern in Newport Beach, said: "I think that with higher interest rates and 
the overall increases in the prices of houses in Orange County, a lot of the 
movement is in higher-priced homes, which pushes up the median price. More and 
more, it's the affluent buyer who is remaining in the market." 
</P>
<P>
But the main reason for the increase in price, experts said, is elementary: 
Demand for housing in the county continues to exceed supply. "The inventory of 
available homes is exceedingly low," Singer said. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, December's median price broke the September record of $234,934. 
</P>
<P>
The state's median price dipped in December, the first time that has happened 
since November, 1987. December's median price was $172,405, a 2.9% drop from 
November's median price of $177,485. 
</P>
<P>
Singer attributed the decrease in large part to lower prices for two- and 
three-bedroom homes in California's inland areas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Results Differ From TRW Information 
</P>
<P>
The association's December results differ from those reported by TRW Real 
Estate Market Information earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
TRW said that the number of homes and condominiums sold in the county rose in 
December by 2.6% and that the average price of those residences was a record 
$219,744. 
</P>
<P>
The TRW statistics differ from the association's because TRW's study includes 
sales of new homes and condominiums. The association's results apply only to 
existing single-family, detached homes.

AFTER JAPANESE PURIFICATION CEREMONY, HITACHI BREAKS GROUND FOR UCI CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Following a traditional Japanese ceremony to purify the land, ground was broken 
Monday on the $12-million Hitachi Chemical Research Center to be built on the 
UC Irvine campus. 
</P>
<P>
The 40,000-square-foot building, scheduled to be completed in the spring of 
1990, will be used jointly by Hitachi Chemical Co. Ltd., a diverse Tokyo-based 
chemical manufacturer, and the university, under an agreement approved in March 
by the University of California Board of Regents. 
</P>
<P>
Appearing at the 2-hour ceremony were Hitachi Chemical President Dr. Ryoji 
Yokoyama, UCI Chancellor Jack W. Peltason, UCI College of Medicine Dean Ted 
Quilligan and Kenneth Gibson, director of the California Department of 
Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
A Shinto ceremony to purify the building site was conducted by three priests 
from the Meiji Shrine in Tokyo. By Japanese tradition, a cone of dirt was moved 
with a plow and a hoe. In recognition of the U.S. ground-breaking tradition, a 
shovel was also used in the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
The university is providing rent-free land to Hitachi for the center. In 
return, UC Irvine will use the ground floor of the building for research and 
office space. 
</P>
<P>
Hitachi will occupy the top two floors of the building for the 40-year term of 
the lease, after which the entire building will become UC property.

ALMANAC / COUNTY EMPLOYMENT BY INDUSTRY: NOT ALL OCCUPATIONS SHOWING GROWTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It may be hard to believe that there are 2 industries in Orange County that 
have seen double-digit job losses in the last year. But there were 18.8% fewer 
miners working in the county in November, compared to the year-earlier month. 
And employment declined 13.6% in chemicals and allied products, according to 
monthly data provided by the California Employment Development Department. 
</P>
<P>
Total jobs in the county increased 2.1% in the period. Manufacturing did better 
than that with a 2.6% gain.

Two substances commonly used in building materials are also listed by the state 
Health and Welfare Agency as causing cancer and requiring warnings when 
consumers are exposed to them in sufficient amounts: 
</P>
<P>
Formaldehyde -- Found in a broad range of building materials, including 
adhesives, carpeting, plywood and paneling. Under Proposition 65, consumers 
must be warned when exposed to 15 micrograms or more a day in a form that can 
be inhaled, eaten or absorbed through the skin. 
</P>
<P>
Benzene -- Commonly used to manufacture roofing materials. Consumers must be 
warned when exposed to levels above 20 micrograms a day. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas E. Warriner, undersecretary of the Health and Welfare Agency, said he 
believes that most new homes do not contain high enough levels of formaldehyde 
or benzene to pose a health threat or to require warnings under Proposition 65.

TOUCHED BY A GIRL'S TRAGEDY, DEPUTY POLICE CHIEF LAUNCHES HEALING CRUSADE

When Mark Kroeker undertook a mission of mercy for an Argentine child who 
needed a new liver, the deputy chief in the Los Angeles Police Department could 
not have dreamed that his work would lead to a multinational crusade. 
</P>
<P>
It began in January, 1987, when Kroeker and Larry Binkley, now Long Beach 
police chief, went to Argentina at the Argentine government's invitation to 
explore an exchange program with the police in the province of Cordoba. 
</P>
<P>
As they disembarked from their helicopter in the village of Carlos Paz, where 
they were to witness a rescue demonstration, they were welcomed by a sea of 
youngsters, singing songs and chanting pro-American slogans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Moment I'll Never Forget' 
</P>
<P>
"I was kissed by about 200 Argentine children," Kroeker says. "Now in 23 years 
on the police department, I've been welcomed a lot of different ways to 
different situations, but never like that. It's a moment I'll never forget . . 
. a very special moment." 
</P>
<P>
Later, in Los Angeles, Kroeker was invited to a dinner honoring Cordoba's 
visiting governor. There he met an Argentine physician who told him about an 
11-year-old girl from a poor family in Berazategui, a Buenos Aires suburb, who 
was dying of liver failure. 
</P>
<P>
"You could not get a liver transplant in Argentina," Kroeker says, "and she was 
doomed." 
</P>
<P>
Kroeker could not get the child out of his mind: "I guess I was kind of 
responding to the love that was shown to me" by the children in Carlos Paz. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, he called the doctor and said, "I want to help that girl 
somehow." 
</P>
<P>
He met with the doctor, and that, says Kroeker, 44, was the beginning of "an 
incredible adventure that has been just a monumental part of my life": his 
drive to improve Third World youngsters' access to the trained surgeons, 
technology, facilities and support for state-of-the-art organ transplants. 
</P>
<P>
In Argentina, a friend's campaign had raised about $25,000 for Veronica 
Arguello, only a fraction of the sum needed to get the girl -- whose father was 
an auto mechanic who struggled to support his family -- a liver transplant in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Let's bring her here, Kroeker decided, "and see what we can do." The doctor 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I Knew the Money Existed' 
</P>
<P>
"There were no options," Kroeker says. "Once I knew of her, I couldn't just let 
her die there. I knew the money existed in Los Angeles. I just figured this 
will get done . . . we'll put something together." 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 5, 1987, Veronica, with her mother, Racquel, and one of her two 
brothers, arrived at Los Angeles International Airport filled with hope. 
</P>
<P>
"I did my best, through every conceivable way, to alert everyone I knew to her 
plight," Kroeker says, "and some support came in. We opened a trust fund for 
her. We put out a notice here in the police department and formed a Veronica 
Arguello Support Committee." A bond quickly developed between Kroeker and the 
child's mother, who knew that her daughter, already jaundiced from idiopathic 
cirrhosis, would be dead in months without a new liver. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll do anything," she told him. "I'll go anywhere. But my daughter has to 
live. She's gone through so much. She must live." 
</P>
<P>
Soon, however, reality hit. A liver transplant could cost as much as $300,000 
-- a sum out of reach for Third World children who lack insurance and state aid 
for organ transplants. 
</P>
<P>
But not long after Veronica's 12th birthday, which she celebrated at a party in 
Disneyland, Kroeker learned that Dallas Children's Medical Center might perform 
the transplant for about $150,000. At that point, he says, "We had about 
$40,000." Dallas seemed their best hope. 
</P>
<P>
Kroeker flew with the Arguellos in mid-August to Dallas, where he had arranged 
for housing at Genesis House, a church program for the homeless operated by a 
pastor friend. 
</P>
<P>
With the Dallas Police Department providing the impetus, a Dallas support 
network was formed, Kroeker says: "There were endless barbecues and fiestas and 
car washes and piano concerts to raise money. Veronica became a household word 
there. . . . They started Veronica's Liver Fund. They kept working and kept 
raising money and they ended up with $100,000." 
</P>
<P>
That was a lot of money but not enough. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, when that mark was reached, Veronica's name went on the medical 
center's list of patients ready for a transplant. "Every day and every night, I 
was living with this problem," Kroeker says. "She became like a daughter to my 
wife and me, and I thought if this was my daughter -- and I have a daughter -- 
I'd sure want someone out there pounding the pavement to make something happen 
for her." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hope in Canada 
</P>
<P>
While they waited -- it had now been four months since Veronica had been taken 
to Dallas -- Kroeker had a phone call from Dick Hayward, a constable from the 
Ontario (Canada) Provincial Police. He wanted to know, had Kroeker ever heard 
of the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto? Sometimes, Hayward said, with 
government money for medical care, procedures could be arranged. 
</P>
<P>
The next day Kroeker spoke with Dr. Rick Superina at the hospital in Toronto. 
He confirmed that "under very special circumstances," arrangements could be 
made. The next day, Superina called back: For $80,000, he said, "we can do the 
whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
Kroeker quickly said yes, knowing the savings on the operation's cost would 
leave Veronica $20,000 for the expensive anti-rejection medication she would 
need to take for the rest of her life. He broke the news to the Dallas group, 
which supported his plan. 
</P>
<P>
In Toronto, Veronica's name immediately went on the transplant waiting list. 
Her father, Pedro, joined the family in Toronto, where they moved into two 
rooms near the hospital. Veronica enrolled in school. 
</P>
<P>
"By now," Kroeker says, "Veronica had hundreds of friends pulling for her, and 
waiting. Everyone was holding their breath. They were holding their breath in 
Argentina, Los Angeles, Dallas, Toronto." 
</P>
<P>
Then, one day in March, the pager Veronica wore at all times went off. There 
was a liver available; that same day she went into surgery. Kroeker recalls 
that the child was "what the doctors called spunky and ready and optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
But things did not go well. Veronica's general condition was weak, and earlier 
surgeries had left a web of internal scar tissue. In 15 hours in the operating 
room, she bled profusely and doctors could not stop this. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, Kroeker waited for news. When Superina, who was the lead 
surgeon, called, he remembers, "I could hear the despondency and the fatigue in 
his voice. He told me that things did not look good for Veronica and all we 
could do was hope and wait and pray." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Two More Attempts 
</P>
<P>
Her body apparently was rejecting the donated liver. Another organ became 
available and doctors decided to try a second transplant, a second 15-hour 
procedure. "This time," Kroeker says, the calls from Toronto were "a little bit 
more hopeful . . . then her kidneys began to fail, and there was a whole string 
of other complications. So they decided to do it a third time." 
</P>
<P>
During the third surgery, a clot formed in her portal vein, an important vein 
into the liver, and it collapsed. "When that happens," Kroeker says, "that's 
the end." 
</P>
<P>
Four days after she had entered the hospital full of hope, Veronica was dead. 
Her family, Kroeker says, was "just destroyed and yet grateful that she had had 
her one chance to live and that all these people had tried to help her have 
that chance." 
</P>
<P>
An airline returned the body, and Veronica's family, to Argentina as its 
anonymous contribution. En route, the plane made a scheduled stop in Dallas, 
where there was a small memorial service. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Language of Love' 
</P>
<P>
Racquel Arguello called Kroeker from Dallas -- she always addressed him as 
commandante -- and, through an interpreter, thanked him for all his help. She 
said he had become like a second father to Veronica. 
</P>
<P>
"The principal language in all of this was the language of love," says Kroeker, 
who spoke no Spanish. "There was not much else needed between us." 
</P>
<P>
Veronica's mother asked one more favor of him. Would he continue on, do this 
for other children? And could something be named for Veronica, so she would be 
remembered? 
</P>
<P>
Kroeker promised -- yes, and yes. 
</P>
<P>
But what? Aware that he had virtually no knowledge of medicine, Kroeker started 
asking for advice from, among others, Dr. Robert Gale of UCLA, the bone marrow 
transplant expert who had treated victims of the Chernobyl disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Gradually, Kroeker put together a geographically diverse board of seven medical 
advisers that includes: Gale; Superina; Dr. Tom Starzl of the University of 
Pittsburgh, an expert in pediatric liver transplantation; and Dr. Leonard 
Makowka, soon to become head of surgery at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Kroeker told the doctors the story of Veronica and each offered the same 
advice: "Don't ever do that again." They explained that, by taking on an 
individual case, Kroeker would burn himself out, run out of money, and, 
ultimately, have the heartbreak of having to say no to a truly deserving 
family. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Provide Medical Centers 
</P>
<P>
Instead, what is needed, the doctors said, is to give children's medical 
centers in the Third World the capability to perform organ transplants, to 
ensure they have the technology and the trained surgeons -- and to create 
public awareness in the countries of the need for donor organs and make people 
"more comfortable with the whole idea of organ transplantation." 
</P>
<P>
Last September, the World Children's Transplant Fund was incorporated in 
California. Its goal, Kroeker says, is "to provide life-saving organ 
transplants to children of our planet without regard to anything except that 
they're kids. . . . When a kid dies in Mexico City, it matters to me." 
</P>
<P>
The foundation will have its first board meeting in February. "I guess I'm the 
chairman, founder, president," Kroeker says. "I'm pushing this thing with 
whatever spare time I can find." 
</P>
<P>
The initial plan is to look at major population centers in Latin America, sites 
such as Mexico City, Sao Paulo, Brazil and Buenos Aires where, he says, there 
are "a whole lot of little Veronicas" and where existing medical facilities can 
be converted into first-rate organ transplant centers. 
</P>
<P>
In 30 days, he expects to have physician liaisons in Mexico, Brazil and 
Argentina, where the medical communities are, he says, "very receptive, very 
willing, very open to help." Indeed, Kroeker has been invited to be the 
keynoter at the first Pan American Conference in Emergency Medicine in May in 
Buenos Aires. 
</P>
<P>
Even as transplant technology and capability are exploding in the United 
States, Kroeger observes, the debt burdens of Latin American countries are 
resulting in dwindling public subsidies "and the quality of life and medical 
care for the child is going downhill. In Latin America, there is some 
transplantation going on, there are some really fine surgeons, but they have 
scattered pieces of equipment and outdated equipment and inadequate training. 
There is none that you could call a first-rate transplant center." 
</P>
<P>
He is a policeman, he emphasizes, not a fund-raiser, but he is an officer with 
dreams who knows "you can't do all these dreams without money." Already, he has 
enlisted as national chairmen for his group Michael and Barbara King (he is 
chief executive officer of King World, packager and owner of TV's "Wheel of 
Fortune," "Jeopardy!" and "The Oprah Winfrey Show.") The fund-raising campaign 
will officially begin March 6, the anniversary of Veronica's death. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Volunteers, Donated Offices 
</P>
<P>
Initially, the foundation -- whose address is 5809 E. Telegraph Road, City of 
Commerce 90040 -- will run mostly with volunteers in donated space at Western 
Office Interiors. 
</P>
<P>
Kroeker is adamant: "We're not going to be a rich foundation with a bunch of 
offices while kids are dying." 
</P>
<P>
His personal goal is to have the first fully staffed, fully operational 
children's transplant center in a Latin American hub city by March 6, 1990. 
That, he estimates, will mean raising a minimum of $350,000, but the cost could 
go as high as $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
"The bill is paid at Toronto," he says, "and we have around $30,000 left over. 
We're using that as seed money." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps that first center will be named for Veronica, whose picture will appear 
on the foundation's stationery. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Invested Our Hearts' 
</P>
<P>
Kroeker remembers a "bright, playful, courageous" child named Veronica 
Arguello. 
</P>
<P>
"We invested our hearts," he says simply. Perhaps, he suggests, his upbringing 
as the child of missionaries who lived and worked in the Third World directed 
him toward his own mission. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting on the odyssey that began with Veronica's arrival in Los Angeles, 
Kroeker says: "I learned, 'Don't get involved unless you are willing to let 
your heart drag you all over the place. But once you do, then stand by because 
you're going to have some immense joy.' 
</P>
<P>
"I can honestly say there's not one thing I could have done for that little 
girl that I didn't do. We don't get these chances very often in life."

NEW TWIST IN TREATING BACK PAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN PARACHINI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A growing number of back pain specialists are now preaching what would have 
been medical heresy a decade ago: that vigorous, aerobic exercise is often the 
best way to help a hurting back and that bed rest often does more harm than 
good. 
</P>
<P>
The turnabout in thinking is apparently the result of improved body chemistry 
science and the increasing willingness of back specialists to question their 
own long-held assumptions. It has been hastened recently by publication of a 
new Danish study that found that an especially strenuous exercise program was a 
much more effective treatment for low back pain than either light exercise or 
rest. 
</P>
<P>
The Danish program, which was tested on 105 backache sufferers, depends on a 
sequence of three exercises so demanding that the Copenhagen researchers who 
described it in the journal Lancet -- as well as American experts questioned by 
The Times -- cautioned that the program should only be initiated with a 
physical therapist in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Options 
</P>
<P>
The American experts said the Danish regimen is only one of an increasing array 
of exercise options being chosen by progressive back pain specialists. Many of 
the programs, they said, can be safely followed at home, without direct medical 
supervision. 
</P>
<P>
"I think most of us have been comfortable for years in prescribing (mild) 
exercise for many forms of low back pain," said C. David Tollison, director of 
Pain Therapy Centers, of Greenville, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
"But when you emphasize the word intensive, which is consistent with the 
philosophy many of us have sort of preached for the last year or two, it goes 
from an area of universal agreement to an area of some level of controversy," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Tollison and Dr. Mark D. Brown, a professor of orthopedics at the University of 
Miami School of Medicine and another back treatment expert, said changes in the 
therapy recommended for heart patients and new mothers -- which emphasizes a 
rapid return to normal exercise and life style -- prompted orthopedists to 
question the traditional prescription for the back. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Opposite Effect 
</P>
<P>
In fact, said Tollison, Brown and Dr. Paul Nutter, a Seattle back pain expert, 
bed rest or long periods of inactivity actually have the opposite effect of 
what is intended because muscle structures that support the back, in the back 
and abdominal area, become deconditioned. 
</P>
<P>
When that happens, Nutter said, and a back pain patient stands and moves about, 
ligaments -- not muscles -- then tend to hold the body erect, and the result 
can be even more intense back pain and the risk of serious injury. Intensive 
aerobic exercise, the three experts said, builds strength in the back so 
exercise has the effect of preventing pain, not risking it. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason you do aerobics is not so much to increase strength as to increase 
endurance," Nutter said. "As you stay in the upright position, your abdominal 
and back muscles are able to hold your body erect." 
</P>
<P>
There is also a fear dynamic in many patients, Tollison said. Often, he said, 
back pain patients are apprehensive about pain since they erroneously assume it 
indicates they have sustained a serious injury. But the average case of low 
back pain is not the precursor of a major spinal catastrophe, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Just as important but less understood, perhaps, Brown said, is the biochemical 
role of exercise. Within the last decade, neuroscientists have started to 
understand the function of a family of body chemicals called endorphins, which 
produce a natural morphine-like pain relief when their production is 
stimulated. 
</P>
<P>
One of the factors that stimulates endorphins, Brown said, is vigorous aerobic 
exercise. 
</P>
<P>
This observation, the experts said, has led to the rethinking of back exercise 
theories first developed as early as 1937 in which back pain treatment included 
cautious, gentle exercise but avoided anything more vigorous. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Confirms Earlier Work 
</P>
<P>
In this climate, the new Danish study has added confirmation to earlier work by 
Tollison and at least a half dozen other researchers. Tollison has published 
studies of 4,100 patients at his clinics that conclude vigorous exercise is 
valuable treatment modality. 
</P>
<P>
The new Danish study, by a team at the University of Copenhagen, divided 
research subjects into groups that received one of three forms of treatment -- 
traditional rest, light exercise and intensive exercise -- over a three-month 
period. The intensive exercise group performed vigorous programs of sets of 50 
repetitions of three different exercises that emphasized trunk lifting, leg 
lifting and pull-ups. 
</P>
<P>
"We were surprised to find such a pronounced difference," the Copenhagen group 
reported. The researchers said the intensive nature of the program and its 
length were credited with its success. "On theoretical grounds," the 
researchers concluded, "the treatment should probably be lifelong." 
</P>
<P>
Tollison advocates exercise programs designed for home use that rely on a wider 
variety of movements, ranging from calf stretching and back arching to pelvic 
tilts and exaggerated sit-ups. The program, Tollison emphasized, should only be 
started after a complete medical review. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there is a psychological benefit, as well," Tollison said. "You give 
an individual some control over his own destiny, instead of going off to bed 
and lying there."

Reputed Gambino godfather John Gotti, unruffled after a night in jail, today 
pleaded innocent to charges that he ordered the shooting of a labor leader and 
was released on $100,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
An associate also charged with first-degree assault and fourth-degree 
conspiracy, Anthony (Tony Lee) Guerrieri, was released on $50,000 bond. Acting 
state Supreme Court Justice George Roberts ordered Gotti's release on bail 
after receiving assurances that he would not flee the area. An indictment 
charged that Gotti recruited two members of a notorious Irish gang to maim a 
union leader, John O'Connor, who had wrecked a Mafia-run restaurant. (Story on

Relatives of the 167 victims of July's oil rig explosion in the North Sea have 
been offered a total of $187 million in compensation payments, the rig's owner, 
Occidental Petroleum Corp., disclosed today. 
</P>
<P>
Armand Hammer, chairman and chief executive officer of the Los Angeles-based 
oil company, revealed the offers in a meeting with securities analysts in New 
York, saying he believes that most of the families will accept them. 
Occidental's oil platform Piper Alpha off Aberdeen, Scotland, exploded and 
burned July 6. The platform was destroyed and 167 men were killed. Most of the 
company's cost will be covered by insurance, Hammer said.

A man in a wheelchair tried to set fire to a 16th-Century painting by Raphael 
in the Vatican Museum today by setting ablaze a flammable liquid he tossed at 
the painting, Vatican officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Museum guards restrained the man, quickly extinguished the flames and prevented 
the work from being damaged, said Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro. 
</P>
<P>
The Italian news agency ANSA said police identified the man as Thomas Lange, a 
31-year-old West German from Berlin who had been living in Italy about a year. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred in the Vatican Picture Gallery, which contains some of 
Raphael's most famous works. Navarro said the man's target was the Madonna of 
Foligno, painted from 1512 to 1513.

Fourteen civilian commandos surrendered this morning after holding off hundreds 
of tank- and artillery-backed soldiers and police at an army base for a day, 
the Argentine government news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
At least 25 people were killed in fighting after about 40 commandos, who the 
government said were leftist guerrillas, broke through the base's main gate in 
a stolen truck early Monday, authorities said. The state-run Telam news agency 
said 13 men and one woman walked out of the base early this morning, their 
hands in the air and one waving a white shirt as a flag of surrender. Sporadic 
shots and mortar rounds were heard for about an hour afterward, but two hours 
later all was silent.

Japan's Economic Planning Minister, Ken Harada, resigned today over a share 
trading scandal he was once charged to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
Harada joined two other ministers driven out of office last month by the 
Recruit Co. scandal but said he had done nothing illegal. 
</P>
<P>
Harada, who took over as economic planning minister less than a month ago, had 
previously been chairman of a government committee charged with investigating 
the share trading scandal. 
</P>
<P>
The Asahi Shimbun newspaper reported in its afternoon edition that Harada had 
received large contributions from Recruit Co., parent company of a real-estate 
firm at the center of the scandal that has rocked the Japanese government. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement to reporters after handing his resignation to Prime Minister 
Noboru Takeshita, Harada confirmed that he had received money from the company. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I have done anything wrong in receiving political contributions. 
The amount of contributions I received was within the law," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Harada, a close aide to Takeshita, said he resigned in order to spare the 
government any trouble.

GREENSPAN SEES NEED FOR TIGHT MONEY POLICY

<P>
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said today that monetary policy 
needs to err on the side of restrictiveness because if the economy continues to 
grow indefinitely at the recent pace, inflation could accelerate significantly. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan told the House Banking Committee that the gross national product 
appears to have risen more than 3% in 1988 and there are few signs of any 
significant impediment to continued expansion in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Overhangs of inventories are rather isolated and manageable, he said. 
Industrial capacity is relatively fully utilized, and there appear to be no 
widespread problems with out-of-control costs and inadequate profit margins. 
</P>
<P>
But Greenspan said this positive outlook does not mean that there is little 
reason for concern. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Higher Resource Use 
</P>
<P>
Resource use has risen to levels that have been linked in the past with rising 
inflation, Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
"If growth were to continue indefinitely at the recent pace, the concomitant 
tightening of supply conditions for labor and materials would risk a serious 
intensification of inflationary pressures at some not-too-distant point in the 
future," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The labor market is showing clear signs of tightening, although it is unlikely 
that a few tenths of a percentage point up or down on the unemployment rate 
would change the inflation outlook dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pressure for Pay Hikes 
</P>
<P>
"Nonetheless, the available evidence points to a high probability of stepped-up 
wage pressures should unemployment decline significantly further," Greenspan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The jobless rate in December was 5.3%, well within what Greenspan said is the 
4.5% to 6.5% range for the "natural rate" of unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
Compensation increased about a percentage point in 1988 as labor shortages 
grew, and Greenspan said there is some fear that the tenor of wage negotiations 
may shift further in a direction inimical to cost restraint. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan said U.S. labor markets and industrial plants may well be flexible 
enough to allow the economy to operate for some time at higher levels of 
resource utilization without a visible deterioration in inflation. 
</P>
<P>
"But there is little doubt that margins of slack have been reduced. The risk of 
greater inflation could be appreciable if real GNP continued to increase at 
recent rates over the next several years," he said.

Car and light truck sales among the nation's Big Three auto makers fell 12.3% 
in mid-January from last year, when sales and consumer confidence bounced back 
after the stock market crash, the companies reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Cars and light trucks sold by General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler 
Corp. dealerships sold at an average daily rate of 27,072 during the Jan. 11 to 
20 period this year, compared to a rate of 30,867 during the same period last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
There were nine selling days in each period. 
</P>
<P>
Car sales among the Big Three dropped 17.4%, going to a daily rate of 16,164 
during the period this year from a rate of 19,565 in mid-January last year. 
Trucks made by GM, Ford and Chrysler sold at 10,908 this year, compared to an 
11,302 daily rate last year, a decline of 3.5%. 
</P>
<P>
During the period last year, consumer confidence was on the upswing after the 
Oct. 19, 1987, stock market crash. This year, the Big Three, with Ford in the 
lead, began a round of cut-rate financing with interest rates as low as 4.9% on 
some loans on a limited number of cars and light trucks. 
</P>
<P>
So far this year, the Big Three have sold cars at a daily rate of 15,380, down 
12.9% from the 17,659 daily rate for the first 20 days of January last year. 
Light truck sales have risen 5.2% to a daily rate of 10,520, compared to a rate 
of 9,999 during the same time last year.

Bucknell University football coach George Landis announced his immediate 
resignation today after three years, citing "inequalities" in the Colonial 
League. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the inequalities in the Colonial League have been ongoing frustrations 
for me. They may be growing pains but they have been daily frustrations for 
me," Landis said. 
</P>
<P>
He also said he has no plans for the immediate future. 
</P>
<P>
Director of Athletics Rick Hartzell said Landis' departure "is a great personal 
loss to me, and I did everything I could to convince him to stay." 
</P>
<P>
Hartzell announced that assistant head coach Lou Maranzana will serve as 
interim head coach and that a national search for a successor to Landis will 
begin immediately.

Golfer George Knudson, whom Ben Hogan once described as having the sweetest 
swing on the PGA Tour, died today after a long battle with cancer. He was 51. 
</P>
<P>
Knudson, Canada's outstanding pro golfer of the 1960s and '70s, had been 
undergoing treatment for lung cancer since June, 1987. He died in Princess 
Margaret Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Winner of eight PGA Tour tournaments between 1961 and 1972, Knudson had planned 
on joining the Seniors Tour in the fall of 1987. He turned 50 June 28, 1987, 
just days after entering the hospital for chest scans and bone marrow analysis. 
</P>
<P>
After a lengthy recovery period following initial treatment, Knudson went on 
tour last summer to promote a recently published book and video. 
</P>
<P>
Knudson, who ran a golf school just north of Toronto for several years, was a 
five-time Canadian PGA champion, won individual honors in the 1966 World Cup, 
won the World Cup in 1968 with Al Balding, tied for second in the 1969 U.S. 
Masters.

PACE PHYSICIAN GROUP TO BUY SAN CLEMENTE GENERAL; 
</P>
<P>
HOSPITAL PURCHASE GETS COURT'S TENTATIVE OK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A group that once was a dark horse in the competition among local physicians to 
buy San Clemente General Hospital said Monday that it has received tentative 
approval from a bankruptcy court to buy the facility for $23 million. 
</P>
<P>
The group, called PACE Inc. (Physician Associates Committed to Excellence), 
said a few issues must be resolved before a definitive agreement can be signed 
with American Healthcare Management, a Dallas-based hospital chain in 
bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
The bankruptcy court last Thursday approved the transaction contingent on PACE 
and American Healthcare Management obtaining an extension on a state deadline 
to upgrade the hospital emergency room, deciding whether to renew its contract 
with a radiology group, and coming to terms on the wording of a definitive 
sales agreement. 
</P>
<P>
But PACE officials said Monday that these issues had been mostly resolved. They 
were optimistic that a definitive agreement would be reached soon and that the 
sale would be completed by April 30. 
</P>
<P>
Timothy Domain, American Healthcare Management's director of corporate finance, 
was more cautious. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously," he said, completion of a sale "is much closer than it was a month 
ago." But he added: "I have seen deals break apart at the last moment. They 
still have to come up with the financing." 
</P>
<P>
A definitive agreement must be signed before a loan can be sought to obtain 
financing for the proposed PACE acquisition, according to David Atchison of 
John Nuveen &amp; Co. in Chicago, PACE's investment banker. 
</P>
<P>
PACE proposes that a limited partnership of staff physicians at San Clemente 
General Hospital buy the 116-bed facility and then lease it to a management 
subsidiary of SamCor Inc., a nonprofit hospital chain based in Phoenix. 
American Healthcare Management would have no ownership or operating role. 
</P>
<P>
SamCor has said it plans to put in a new management team at the hospital but to 
retain the rest of the staff. 
</P>
<P>
In arranging the acquisition, PACE has recruited staff physicians at San 
Clemente General Hospital to a limited partnership that is expected to supply 
between $3 million and $5 million toward the purchase price. Dr. Dava F. 
Gerard, president of PACE, said that so far 58 staff physicians have joined, 
each investing a minimum of $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
The remainder of the $23-million cash price of the hospital's fixed assets will 
be raised by arranging a loan with institutional investors, Atchison said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Green said SamCor will pay an amount not yet determined to 
American Health Care Management to acquire the hospital's cash on hand and 
receivables. 
</P>
<P>
PACE is not the first group to announce having come close to purchasing San 
Clemente General. In October, a physicians' group led by Dr. Ron McGee won 
tentative court approval to proceed with the purchase of the hospital on 
condition it could complete financing. 
</P>
<P>
However, McGee's group withdrew in late November. McGee complained at the time 
that physicians in the PACE group had undermined the group's attempts to obtain 
financing by deliberately sending their patients to other hospitals. When the 
patient occupancy dropped from 50 to 17 in about a week's time, McGee said, the 
group's prospective lender, Citicorp, became nervous. 
</P>
<P>
PACE President Gerard, however, denied that PACE had anything to do with the 
dip in the hospital census, which later rebounded.
