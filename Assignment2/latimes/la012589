SUSPECTED FERRY JOY RIDERS SAIL RIGHT INTO BRIG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Chances are good that Danny Andrews, Roy Bennett and their 15-year-old 
companion never heard of a sea chest. That's the system that pumps seawater 
through marine engines to keep them cool. 
</P>
<P>
Because of this shortage in nautical know-how, officials said, the trio's 
attempt to take a joy ride on a Santa Catalina Island ferryboat Tuesday morning 
ended with the craft catching fire in Los Angeles Harbor and the three catching 
a ride to jail. 
</P>
<P>
After the fire was quenched, Andrews, 28, of Bell and Bennett, 28, of Bell 
Gardens were booked at the Los Angeles Police Department's Harbor Division Jail 
on suspicion of grand theft. The youth, whose name was withheld because of his 
age, was booked on a juvenile count and released to his parents. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said the three apparently hot-wired the 56-foot Channel Express 
at San Pedro's Berth 95 sometime after 2 a.m., started the engines and headed 
out into the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
"The meatheads . . . didn't know they had to turn on the cooling system," said 
Elaine Vaughan, vice president of marketing for Catalina Express, the firm that 
owns the boat. "The engines overheated . . . and caught fire." 
</P>
<P>
The boat went dead in the water in the harbor's main channel, midway between 
the Coast Guard base at Reservation Point on Terminal Island and the Angel's 
Gate lighthouse on the outer breakwater, according to the Coast Guard. 
</P>
<P>
"The captain of a harbor pilot boat called us at about 3 a.m. to say he'd come 
upon a passenger ferryboat on fire with three men aboard," said Petty Officer 
Brad Smith, a spokesman for the Coast Guard. "He took the three men off, and we 
sent a boat out to fight the fire. A Los Angeles fireboat arrived on the scene. 
So did a Long Beach lifeguard boat." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
20-Minute Battle 
</P>
<P>
It took about 20 minutes to extinguish the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard called Catalina Express and came to the conclusion that the 
three had stolen the ferryboat. The suspects were transferred to the Coast 
Guard boat and from there to a boat sent out by the Harbor Division of the Los 
Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett and Andrews remained in custody Tuesday at the Harbor Division Jail. 
Their arraignment on grand theft charges was expected today. 
</P>
<P>
The 55-passenger Channel Express, one of four ferryboats operated by Catalina 
Express, was towed to the San Pedro Boatworks, where preliminary estimates 
placed the damage at close to $350,000. 
</P>
<P>
"The engines are completely burned out, and it'll need a new exhaust system," 
said Jim Geddes, yard foreman at the boat works. "Some of the fiberglass on the 
hull is scorched, too." 
</P>
<P>
Vaughan said there was also some vandalism to electronic gear aboard the craft. 
</P>
<P>
Catalina Express -- one of two principal operators providing ferry service from 
the mainland to Avalon and the Isthmus on Catalina -- said its service to the 
island will not be affected by the incident.

SHARP CUTS FORESEEN IN HEALTH PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICTOR MERINA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On top of a worsening crisis over emergency-room care, Los Angeles County 
officials warned Tuesday that other county health care services could suffer 
drastic cuts if Gov. George Deukmejian succeeds in pushing through his proposed 
state budget. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Administrative Officer Richard B. Dixon, delivering a bleak message to 
the Board of Supervisors, estimated that the county stands to lose between $66 
million and $180 million in state aid for health care services under the 
governor's spending plan. 
</P>
<P>
In unveiling his recent budget proposal, Deukmejian suggested reduction of 
general fund dollars for medical assistance to indigent adults. But he also 
proposed making up for that cut by using revenues from Proposition 99, the 
voter-approved tobacco tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Dixon said, Los Angeles County would come out a loser. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon said that the "best-case scenario would place us in the position that we 
not only could not substantially support the private emergency room problem, we 
would have to make severe and very painful cuts in our own core, health 
services operation." 
</P>
<P>
Dixon did not specify where such reductions would take place but later said 
they would involve "across-the-board cuts" during the next fiscal year unless 
additional revenue is found. 
</P>
<P>
Health Services Director Robert Gates, who had said on Monday that the county 
could no longer subsidize private hospital emergency rooms under the governor's 
budget, agreed with Dixon that a wide array of programs could be jeopardized 
when the next fiscal year begins in July. 
</P>
<P>
"What you may see is not only private hospitals closing their emergency rooms 
but also the shrinking of health services at county hospitals," Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
Since many of the patients treated at county emergency rooms are indigents, 
Deukmejian's proposed funding reductions threaten the collapse of an 
overloaded, underfinanced emergency health care system, Dixon said. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Gamble, president of the Hospital Council of Southern California, said 
the present crisis among private hospitals is "much, much worse" than in 
previous years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Public Safety Crisis' 
</P>
<P>
"We now have an extremely serious public safety crisis," said Gamble, who added 
that "people from all walks of life are needlessly dying or being permanently 
disabled or suffering irreversible damage due to our inability to adequately 
fund adequate basic emergency services.' 
</P>
<P>
Battalion Chief Jim Sheppard, director of the county's paramedic services, told 
the supervisors that last weekend paramedic crews in East Los Angeles, West 
Hollywood, Carson and Dominguez were turned away from the nearest emergency 
rooms on 39 occasions, forcing paramedics to take patients to other hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
"He's making a big mistake on this question," said Supervisor Kenneth Hahn of 
Deukmejian's plans. "What has happened to the conscience of the Legislature and 
the governor on this situation?" 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to alleviate the crisis, the board voted Tuesday to urge the 
governor and state legislators to spare the county from cuts in health care 
funds. Board Chairman Ed Edelman also suggested that the county explore a 
possible court challenge to force the state to provide the necessary health 
care dollars. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Matter of Priorities 
</P>
<P>
"The governor might cut some other area but we need to let him know what our 
priorities are," said Edelman, who authored the tobacco tax proposal. 
</P>
<P>
But even as he voted to go along with his colleagues, Supervisor Pete 
Schabarum, who like Deukmejian is a conservative Republican, made it clear that 
he thought the supervisors' action was futile. "Big deal," he told his 
colleagues after the vote, "We haven't done diddly."

JAILHOUSE INFORMANTS BENEFIT BY TESTIFYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT W. STEWART and TED ROHRLICH, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jailhouse informants are often rewarded for their testimony in criminal cases, 
even if they are not explicitly promised special treatment, documents released 
Tuesday indicate. 
</P>
<P>
Memoranda written by Los Angeles County prosecutors on their use of jailhouse 
informants appear to support the argument advanced by some defense attorneys 
that informants testify with the implicit understanding that they will receive 
lenient treatment from authorities. 
</P>
<P>
The memos were written in response to concerns that some jailhouse informants 
may have fabricated confessions of fellow inmates. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles defense attorney Gigi Gordon, who is coordinating a defense bar 
effort to gather information on informants, said the danger of false 
confessions is heightened by a system in which jailhouse informants routinely 
expect and get favors from prosecutors, even though none are expressly 
promised. 
</P>
<P>
"I call it the wink and the nod," Gordon said. "The informant feels free to 
testify he has been promised nothing, while he understands that he will get it 
(his reward) later." 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Dist. Atty. Curt Livesay disputed Gordon's assessment, saying: "It's 
worse than hogwash to call it 'a wink and a nod.' The implicit understanding is 
that the witness who testifies fully and truthfully can count on law 
enforcement to reveal fully and truthfully the extent of his cooperation to 
anyone who asks, at any time." 
</P>
<P>
At a sentencing hearing last year, a defense attorney for veteran jailhouse 
informant James Brammer, whose activities are outlined in the memos, described 
the implicit understanding between informants and prosecutors about the rewards 
for testifying. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to insult the court by saying that Mr. Brammer provided . . . 
this information simply as an honest citizen who is trying to destroy crime in 
the neighborhood. Obviously he had some self-interest involved," attorney Ralph 
Peretz told Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Judith M. Ashmann during an 
appearance last April. 
</P>
<P>
"But he (Brammer) was told by all the district attorneys, several of whom I 
have talked to, that they would not make any deals or agreements with Mr. 
Brammer before his testimony, precisely because they wanted him to be able to 
testify without being required to testify that he had a deal, so that he would 
appear more credible to the juries involved." 
</P>
<P>
The judge then reduced Brammer's burglary sentence from six years to two. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
140 Defendants 
</P>
<P>
The memoranda released Tuesday involve 140 defendants in Los Angeles County 
criminal cases in which informants have testified in the last 10 years. They 
were drafted as part of a review by the district attorney's office of its use 
of informants. 
</P>
<P>
The inquiry began last fall after longtime informant Leslie Vernon White 
demonstrated to authorities that, through the use of various ruses, he could 
fabricate the confession of an inmate he had never met. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor's office so far has not uncovered any cases in which it believes 
a defendant was wrongly convicted, office spokesman Al Albergate said. Copies 
of the memoranda released Tuesday have been mailed to the attorneys involved in 
each case. "If they think there is a problem with the conviction," Albergate 
said, "it's up to them to go to court and seek a new trial or a reversal." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Grand Jury Probe Asked 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, several groups representing defense attorneys have asked the Los 
Angeles County Grand Jury to conduct its own review of the use of jailhouse 
informants. The district attorney's office recently joined in the request. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the memoranda written by the prosecutors do not specifically address 
the extent to which promises were made or favors granted. 
</P>
<P>
But in nearly 20 cases described in the memos, informants who helped the 
prosecutors win convictions received some help, ranging from letters to state 
parole authorities to the dismissal of charges. Several show that prosecutors 
have explicitly told juries that promises were made to informants. 
</P>
<P>
But more frequently the understanding appears to have been unstated. In one 
such case, informant Marvin Harper, already sentenced to state prison for 
burglary, testified that accused child-molester and wife-beater Marvin Cahan 
had confessed his role in the crimes in a courthouse holding cell. 
</P>
<P>
"After Cahan's preliminary hearing," wrote Deputy Dist. Atty. Sandra Buttita, 
"I informed Judge Cecil Mills of Harper's participation in my case but did not 
ask for any change in Harper's sentence." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Probation Ordered 
</P>
<P>
However, Buttita continued, "At the request of Harper's public defender, Mills 
recalled the sentence and put Harper on probation." 
</P>
<P>
In another case that may show an implicit understanding, Deputy Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Scott Carbaugh reported that longtime informant Sidney Storch, a forger, 
had provided key testimony about a jailhouse confession in a gang murder case. 
"Mr. Storch was not promised anything for his testimony," Carbaugh said in his 
memo. "However, this writer wrote a letter to the Department of Corrections 
requesting an early parole release for Mr. Storch." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes providing help is costly in unexpected ways. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Andrew Diamond said he prepared an "in-and-out order" that 
allowed informant White, a convicted kidnaper, robber and car thief, to be 
released from custody for five days at a time to help police. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. White never failed to reappear," Diamond wrote. "I did learn after his 
last release that was orchestrated by me that on two of these occasions he had 
perpetrated new crimes. He had beaten his then-wife, he had pulled a knife on 
his landlord and had committed a purse snatch. He was also back to using 
drugs."

 CEMETERY DECLARED AN L.A. LANDMARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Wilmington Cemetery, believed to be the oldest active graveyard in Los 
Angeles County, was declared a city landmark Tuesday by the Los Angeles City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
The cemetery, established 131 years ago near Pacific Coast Highway in 
Wilmington by Phineas Banning, the father of the Port of Los Angeles, is the 
resting place of members of several prominent families of early Southern 
California, including the Bannings, Sepulvedas, Narbonnes and Carsons. 
</P>
<P>
Banning, who established the graveyard to bury his first child, was interred 
there for a short while, but his second wife moved his remains to Rosedale 
Cemetery in Los Angeles. The cemetery has about 300 plots remaining, which are 
generally available only to residents of the cemetery's assessment district, 
which includes most of Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby residents began pushing for the landmark designation about 1 1/2 years 
ago when the graveyard had to close its gates for a month because of financial 
problems. It has since rebounded, thanks to loans from the city and county and 
an annual $8.09 assessment on all taxable parcels in the district.

 NO DIAMOND LANE ON VENTURA FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Caltrans on Tuesday removed what may be the last major barrier to the start 
this summer of widening the Ventura Freeway through the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Officials disclosed that they have decided to stick to their conclusion reached 
two years ago to build the new eastbound fifth lane on the freeway between 
Woodland Hills and Universal City for all vehicles, rather than making it a 
diamond lane for car pools and buses. 
</P>
<P>
The executive director of the California Transportation Commission -- which 
controls Caltrans' budget and in October ordered the agency to take another 
look at the diamond lane proposal -- said he expects the commissioners to go 
along with Caltrans' decision.

Cash-starved Massachusetts sued Mercedes-Benz of North America Inc. Tuesday for 
$6.2 million in unpaid corporate excise taxes for 1982 to 1985, state Revenue 
Commissioner Stephen W. Kidder announced. 
</P>
<P>
The suit filed in Suffolk Superior Court charged that the North American 
affiliate of the German auto manufacturer refused to file returns or neglected 
to pay corporate tax and excise payments while doing business in Massachusetts 
since 1965. 
</P>
<P>
"Mercedes-Benz of North America pays its fair share of taxes in those states in 
which we do business," said A. B. Shuman, public relations manager at the 
firm's Montvale, N. J., headquarters.

Transparent campaign stunt or serious gesture to rid Los Angeles streets of a 
violent menace? 
</P>
<P>
Serious, says City Councilman Nate Holden, one of 26 possible candidates for 
mayor. From excess campaign funds, Holden said Tuesday, he will pay upward of 
$300 for every Uzi or AK-47 assault rifle surrendered to police by gang members 
or anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
"Better they are in the hands of the Police Department, where they can be 
destroyed," Holden said. 
</P>
<P>
The plan as announced was not without flaws. Holden at first urged that people 
bring the rifles to his office, but changed his mind when police advised 
against anyone carrying weapons into City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
But, though details need to be worked out, Los Angeles police plan to treat the 
offer as legitimate. 
</P>
<P>
Cmdr. William Booth, chief spokesman for Chief Daryl F. Gates, said police 
don't know if the cash offer will work. But plans are being made in case 
weapons are turned in. 
</P>
<P>
More than likely, police will issue a receipt to anyone who turns in such a 
weapon, Booth said. What happens next will be a private transaction between 
Holden and the former weapon owner, Booth said. Any changes will be explained 
today at another Holden news conference. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to work with him," Booth said. 
</P>
<P>
Aides to Mayor Tom Bradley, however, said the idea is a campaign ploy and 
criticized the manner in which the plan was unveiled. 
</P>
<P>
"The plan is poorly thought out," spokeswoman Dee Dee Meyers said. "Where's the 
incentive for turning them in?" 
</P>
<P>
Holden made the offer, seemingly off the cuff, at a news conference called to 
urge Bradley to agree to debate him before the April 11 mayoral primary.

U.S. PLANS TO DIG DITCH AT BORDER; 
</P>
<P>
OTAY MESA BARRIER TARGETED AT ILLEGAL VEHICLE CROSSINGS 
</P>

<P>
The federal government, concerned about illegal immigrants and drugs smuggled 
across the border in trucks from Mexico, is planning to dig a ditch 4 miles 
long, 14 feet wide and 5 feet deep at the border near San Diego to stop 
vehicles from crossing into California, according to knowledgeable sources. 
</P>
<P>
The ditch, to be constructed of soil and concrete and projected to be completed 
by fall, will be next to the port of entry at Otay Mesa, the sources said, a 
flat area where vehicles currently may cross practically at will. 
</P>
<P>
Told about the plan, advocates for immigrants expressed outrage, but a Bush 
Administration official defended the plan as necessary to prevent illegal 
crossings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opposition Expressed 
</P>
<P>
"The foolishness of this proposal doesn't surprise me. . . . About the only 
thing they haven't suggested is mining the area," said Roberto Martinez, head 
of the San Diego office of the American Friends Service Committee, a group of 
social activists. "Instead of trying to mend fences and relations with Mexico, 
they're looking for ways to tear them down. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Ditches are not the solution. It's going to take a bilateral approach to find 
solutions for the socio-economic problems in Mexico and the deteriorating 
relations between Mexico and the United States to stop illegal immigration." 
</P>
<P>
The ditch "should be extremely effective in preventing vehicle traffic," said 
one Administration official, noting that in addition to apprehending illegal 
immigrants, border agents expect to catch more drug smugglers as well. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Similar to Farmer's Idea 
</P>
<P>
Luis Cacho, whose family has farmed Otay Mesa for generations, thinks that 
federal officials may have gotten the idea for the ditch from a scheme he 
devised a few years ago to stop Border Patrol vehicles from running over his 
fields, trampling crops. 
</P>
<P>
Cacho, 56, dug a ditch on his property and watched with amusement as several 
Border Patrol vehicles were abruptly stopped by the ditch while in pursuit of 
aliens before agents got the message. After six months, the Border Patrol sent 
out an agent with a pick and shovel to try to fill it in, Cacho said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities estimate that 300 to 400 vehicles, many of them driven by 
smugglers, cross the border illegally in the San Diego area every month. 
However, many tens of thousands of immigrants also cross illegally on foot, 
both through the flat abea in Otay Mesa and the rougher terrain to the west. 
The ditch plan is not aimed at pedestrian crossers. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't get all of them," said an official at the Justice Department, parent 
agency of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
But Arnoldo Torres, national political director for the League of United Latin 
American Citizens in Washington, called the ditch plan "shocking, for it takes 
on desperate proportions and will have negative consequences, symbolically as 
well as substantively. Once again, we appear to be obsessed with dealing with 
symptoms instead of trying to find solutions" to the problems. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fall Completion Date 
</P>
<P>
The Immigration and Naturalization Service has commissioned an environmental 
impact study and is expected to announce the plan soon. "Construction on the 
ditch will begin as soon as the study is satisfactorily completed," a Bush 
Administration official said, adding that the project is expected to be 
completed by fall. 
</P>
<P>
All this was somewhat of a surprise to U.S. Border Patrol officials contacted 
Tuesday in San Diego. The ditch, said Armand Olvera, assistant chief patrol 
agent in San Diego, is one of three proposals being considered. The others are 
a new fence or another kind of concrete barrier, said Olvera, who described the 
ditch plan as preliminary. He noted that officials would likely need approval 
from the city of San Diego, as well as a go-ahead from the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency. "It (the ditch plan) is just one of several different things 
being kicked around," Olvera said. 
</P>
<P>
The International Boundary and Water Commission, a committee of U.S. and 
Mexican officials, has been involved in the planning, although it is not clear 
what, if any, role the Mexican government will have, according to an 
Administration source. 
</P>
<P>
The terrain separating Tijuana and San Diego accounts for more than a third of 
the 1.2 million illegal immigrants apprehended along the U.S.-Mexican border 
last year. The area, gateway to the booming illegal alien job market in Los 
Angeles, is considered the single most popular crossing area along the 
1,900-mile border. 
</P>
<P>
The idea behind the ditch is to stop vehicles, and officials believe that few 
vehicles will be able to cross at points beyond the ditch because that hilly 
terrain is less passable than the land near the Otay Mesa port of entry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Inadequate Tools 
</P>
<P>
Immigration experts -- inside and outside the government -- have long asserted 
that INS resources are inadequate to stem the flow of illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
The 1986 immigration reform law provided for an increase in Border Patrol 
officers, and INS officials said that by Sept. 30, the end of the government's 
current fiscal year, the border force will have grown from the current 3,000 to 
4,500. 
</P>
<P>
But that number is not nearly enough to cover the nation's southern border, 
experts say. At many points along the border, fences need mending -- or are 
nonexistent -- and government surveillance equipment is inadequate to keep up 
with illegal crossings. Thus, the government is trying to find new ways to 
fight the crossings. 
</P>
<P>
Some plans have failed. For example, in the late 1970s a chain-link fence, 
known derisively as the "Tortilla Curtain," was placed along several miles of 
the border in El Paso at a cost of more than $1 million. It did not take long 
for illegal immigrants to cut holes in it and make their way into this country. 
</P>
<P>
But a Bush Administration official, noting the distinctions between the fence 
and the ditch, said: "This is going to work to the extent that it will keep 
vehicles out. This is not intended to stop people from crossing on foot. Unlike 
the fence, this is not something that can be easily damaged or destroyed."

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: PURSUIT OF STARSHIP FAILS TO GET OFF GROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beam me up, Scotty, somebody down here is trying to rip me off. 
</P>
<P>
Like a noble Vulcan battling a gang of beetle-browed Klingons, free-lance 
writer Craig Pendergast has a mission. He feels Paramount Pictures Corp. swiped 
his ideas for the movie "Star Trek III: The Search for Spock." 
</P>
<P>
Pendergast, 33, a San Diego resident and marketing manager for a vocational 
school, circulated his script, "Ghost Ship," to several Hollywood agents in the 
early 1980s. He even has a letter from William Shatner's agent saying the actor 
admired the "hook" (the obstacles the hero must overcome). 
</P>
<P>
But when Pendergast asked for a cut of the movie's profits, doors were closed 
and phone calls were not returned. His lawyer wrote to Paramount, outlining 
more than a dozen plot similarities between "Ghost Ship" and "Star Trek III." 
</P>
<P>
Some examples: Both the screenplay and movie involve new propulsion units for 
the "warp" engines of spacecraft. In both, Adm. Kirk is temporarily relieved of 
command. In the screenplay, the 9-year-old son of Spock plays a central role; 
in the movie, the 9-year-old is Spock himself, regenerating by the "Genesis" 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
A Paramount attorney responded that any similarity between screenplay and movie 
is because Pendergast used "elements of our copyrighted works" from previous 
"Star Trek" movies. He said the movie was already in "post-production" when 
"Ghost Ship" arrived. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Pendergast filed suit against Paramount, Shatner, Leonard Nimoy (who 
played Spock and directed "Star Trek III") and several agents and writers. 
Lacking the money for a lengthy legal battle, Pendergast has not pursued the 
court case. 
</P>
<P>
He has, however, begun petitioning Congress to change the federal copyright law 
to make it easier for free-lance writers to pursue claims of literary theft. 
</P>
<P>
"I just can't get it out of my craw," Pendergast said. "And I'm not even a 
Trekkie." 
</P>
<P>
He is also writing a novel. This time, he's not taking any chances. He won't 
discuss even the barest outline before it's completed, copyrighted and 
delivered to an agent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ornament Hoods 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department hopes it has put a stop to the snatching of hood 
ornaments in North County. 
</P>
<P>
For months, the ornaments from Mercedes-Benzes and other upscale cars have been 
disappearing in record numbers -- and reappearing as jewelry and club 
medallions worn by teen-agers. A code of silence among the teens seemed to 
protect the snatchers. 
</P>
<P>
Four high school students have now been arrested for snapping off ornaments, 
smashing windows and taking stereos from cars on a Vista used-car lot. When 
they allegedly ripped off a fellow student's car, somebody called the cops. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Mary Helmen describes the four as first offenders from "good 
families" who turned to vandalism out of boredom. 
</P>
<P>
"I doubt we'll get all the ornaments back," she said. "The whole senior class 
is wearing them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Imbalance of Nature 
</P>
<P>
Rattlesnakes sometimes bite people. Rattlesnakes always scare people. So, when 
the county Department of Parks and Recreation opened Louis A. Stelzer Park on 
Wildcat Canyon Road outside Lakeside six years ago, the indigenous rattlers 
were relocated. 
</P>
<P>
Whenever a red diamondback or a southern Pacific is spotted, county rangers 
slip a noose over its head and gently move it to a brushy ravine several miles 
from the public area. The snake population has dropped sharply, but fewer 
snakes means more mice. 
</P>
<P>
The park's other mouse-eaters, two owls and a family of hawks, have not been 
able to handle the extra workload. As a result, the park has now hit critical 
(mouse) mass. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a mouse explosion," said park ranger Maureen McNeece. "They're 
eating our files, our maps, our books, everything. We put out baited 
mousetraps, but they keep coming. It's extraordinary."

WATER BOARD LIKELY TO FUND SDG&amp;E STUDY; 
</P>
<P>
MOVE WOULD END MONEY RIFT WITH CITY OVER ATTEMPT TO BLOCK MERGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a reversal of their earlier position, County Water Authority officials have 
informally agreed to pay $250,000 for a feasibility study on a public takeover 
of San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co., Mayor Maureen O'Connor announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The decision, if ratified by the Water Authority's 35-member board of directors 
at its Feb. 9 meeting, could end a brief tussle between the Water Authority and 
the city of San Diego over who would pay for the study and set the research in 
motion. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached in a meeting between O'Connor and Water Authority 
Vice Chairman Mike Madigan last Thursday. The session also included Water 
Authority General Manager Lester Snow and San Diego City Atty. John Witt. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Full Board OK Is Expected 
</P>
<P>
"It's legal, and we're going to ask the Water Authority to pick up the tab," 
Madigan said in an interview Tuesday, adding, "I think the board will go along 
with it." 
</P>
<P>
In a related matter, the San Diego City Council instructed Witt to investigate 
allegations of improper contacts between SDG&amp;E and Southern California 
Edison -- whose parent company, SCEcorp., is attempting to buy the local 
utility for $2.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The Utility Consumers Action Network, a San Diego-based consumer group, alleged 
Monday that SDG&amp;E is sharing "proprietary information" on power purchases, 
transmission-related contracts and purchases of goods and services with Edison, 
which remains an SDG&amp;E competitor until a merger is approved. 
</P>
<P>
The accusations came in a request to the state Public Utilities Commission for 
an injunction barring the sharing of information in the belief that Edison 
would gain a competitive advantage over SDG&amp;E during the 18 months before 
the merger either succeeded or fell through, said Michael Shames, UCAN's 
executive director. 
</P>
<P>
A published report also indicated that Edison officials have already 
participated in some decisions made by SDG&amp;E. 
</P>
<P>
"This alarming development raises serious questions about the legality of such 
a decision-making process," said O'Connor, who is leading a high-profile 
campaign against the merger. "It seems to us that such actions may seriously 
violate legal restrictions imposed by the city's franchises" as well as state 
and federal regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant City Atty. Ron Johnson said San Diego has no evidence of impropriety 
but was spurred by rumors and allegations to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Accusations Disputed 
</P>
<P>
SDG&amp;E Vice President Jack Thomas called the claims "baloney." 
</P>
<P>
"We are running San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. and making decisions," he 
said. "We are abiding precisely with the merger agreement we have with Southern 
California Edison Co." 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Public Utilities Commission said she could not comment on 
the allegations, which the commission has not formally received. She said 
SDG&amp;E and Edison would have 15 days to respond before the commission 
decides whether to hold a hearing on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Shames said his allegations stem from telephone calls he is receiving from 
SDG&amp;E employees and the terms of the merger agreement, which he believes 
lacks wording to protect proprietary information. 
</P>
<P>
But Thomas said Shames' claims are "simply not true. We are not exchanging 
information with Southern California Edison of a proprietary nature." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas agreed that other decisions have been made jointly since SDG&amp;E's 
board of directors agreed to Edison's buyout offer Dec. 1, including a change 
in the thrust of an advertising campaign and a switch of articles in a company 
newsletter. But he said the policy shifts were legal. 
</P>
<P>
On some matters, "We are not competing with Edison Co. now," he said. "We are 
engaged to be married. We've got a wedding here in 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
The spat between San Diego and the Water Authority developed last month after a 
preliminary legal opinion from Water Authority attorney Paul Engstrand found 
that the agency could not legally finance the study with its money. 
</P>
<P>
After that opinion, the authority's Snow and City Manager John Lockwood met and 
agreed to propose that the city fund a study conducted by the water board. On 
Dec. 13, the City County voted to lend the Water Authority $250,000 for the 
study. 
</P>
<P>
Water Authority directors voted to accept the payment the next day, but said 
they considered it a grant, to be repaid if the agency actually took over 
SDG&amp;E, which could take years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Water Decision Reversed 
</P>
<P>
The impasse over whether the payment would be a loan or grant remained until 
Engstrand reversed himself Jan. 6, ruling that the Water Authority could spend 
its money on the feasibility study. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the apparent agreement for the Water Authority to finance the study, 
the City Council voted in closed session Tuesday to reaffirm that $225,000 of 
the proposed payment would be a loan not a grant, O'Connor said. Councilman Bob 
Filner, who opposes having the city finance the study, dissented from the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant City Atty. Johnson said, "We are not going to change it from a loan 
to a grant, but we are offering a loan."

TRASH-TO-ENERGY PLANT ON FRONT BURNER AGAIN AFTER SUPERVISORS' VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a 3-2 vote that reflects continued division over the issue, the San Diego 
County Board of Supervisors Tuesday agreed to reopen negotiations with the 
would-be developer of a trash-to-energy plant in San Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
The contract will establish, among other terms, to what degree the county will 
share financial liability with Thermo Electron Corp., the would-be developer 
and operator of the plant, in burning much of North County's trash. 
</P>
<P>
In Tuesday's hourlong discussion, board chairman Susan Golding again voiced her 
longstanding opposition to the project on financial and environmental grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor John MacDonald, whose district includes the county's landfill in San 
Marcos, where the plant would be built, reiterated his concerns about its 
financial feasibility. 
</P>
<P>
But South County Supervisor Brian Bilbray, the board's most vocal 
trash-to-energy cheerleader, campaigned strongly for negotiations to begin and 
for the start-up of the project. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Bottom of the 9th' 
</P>
<P>
He contested MacDonald's statements that Thermo Electron already has two 
strikes against it -- the dropping out of two previous partners who would have 
financially backed the $250-million project -- and that, if Thermo Electron's 
newest ally "strikes out, I think we should call the game. It's the bottom of 
the 9th." 
</P>
<P>
Retorted Bilbray: 
</P>
<P>
"We're stuck in this ballpark. Waste disposal isn't something we can walk away 
from. This project is alive as long as we need to dispose of our waste stream." 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors gave its negotiator, the New York financial consulting firm of 
Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., and Thermo Electron officials until March 31 to 
hammer out a contract proposal for the board's review. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the project had complained that the terms of the proposed contract 
should be made public in order to allow them time to analyze it before it 
returns to the supervisors for a vote. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Thermo Electron officials agreed to allow the county to reveal the 
proposed contract at the start of negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Davis, president of Thermo Electron's Energy Systems Division, said the 
contract is 2 inches thick and contains proprietary information about the 
project that the company had hoped to keep under wraps. 
</P>
<P>
He said he expects critics to find faults with the proposal but, by airing it 
publicly, the company believes it will garner more support than opposition. 
</P>
<P>
At issue on Tuesday was whether supervisors have enough confidence in Thermo 
Electron to even negotiate a contract for the operation of the plant, which is 
designed to recycle about 20% of the incoming trash and burn most of the 
balance as fuel to generate electricity to sell to San Diego Gas &amp; Electric 
Co., as well as to reduce the amount of garbage dumped in the San Marcos 
landfill, which is near capacity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Projects in Europe 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Thermo Electron signed a memorandum of understanding with 
American Recovery Corp., a joint venture of Sorain Cecchini Recovery of Italy 
and Potomac Capital Investment Corp. Potomac Capital is a subsidiary of the 
Potomac Electric Power Co., a publicly held utility that serves the Washington 
area. Among its other investments, Potomac Capital is part owner of five solar 
energy plants in the Mojave Desert, and is bidding on projects elsewhere to 
burn trash for power. 
</P>
<P>
The joint venture company would rely on Sorain's expertise as the designer and 
operator of several mass recycling projects in Europe, and Potomac's financial 
resources, to guarantee to Thermo Electron that it would successfully operate 
the trash recycling operation in San Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
Several speakers opposing the contract complained to supervisors that the 
addition of the joint-venture firm as a subcontractor has resulted only in 
financial guarantees to Thermo Electron, and not to the county itself. 
</P>
<P>
MacDonald addressed that issue, asking American Recovery executive John Nutter: 
"If something happens to Thermo Electron, God forbid, would (American Recovery) 
take over the plant and not place the county in the position of picking up the 
pieces and taking over?" 
</P>
<P>
"We're certainly willing to discuss that possibility," Nutter said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Risk to County Cited 
</P>
<P>
Golding said she is frustrated that other alternatives to disposing trash had 
not been fully studied, and said she is concerned about the county's risk as a 
participant in the project. 
</P>
<P>
"The county has nowhere near the guarantees necessary to move forward on this 
project," Golding said. 
</P>
<P>
The county and Thermo Electron had previously signed a contract for the 
operation of the plant, but that pact was ruled invalid by a San Diego Superior 
Court judge for a variety of reasons, in part unresolved environmental concerns 
and an oversight committed by the city of San Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the judge's ruling, Thermo Electron itself asked for a renegotiated 
contract in 1986, hoping that the county would increase its share of the 
financial risk of operating the plant, especially should changing environmental 
laws require retrofitting the plant with newer technology. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange, the county stands to gain royalty revenue through the sale of 
recyclable material and the sale of electricity to SDG&amp;E, in addition to 
lessening the demand for landfills.

 MENTAL TEST ORDERED IN HIT-RUN CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Arraignment for a man charged with murder in a hit-and-run crash on Pacific 
Coast Highway in Malibu was postponed by a judge Tuesday until psychiatrists 
can determine the man's mental competence. 
</P>

BIAS TOWARD CONFUSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For more than a decade the U.S. Supreme Court has struggled to enunciate a 
clear standard for deciding when affirmative action may be imposed to 
compensate for racial discrimination. In a zigzag series of decisions the court 
has upheld race-based preferences in hiring but not in layoffs, spawned 
treatises on the differences between quotas (bad) and goals (good), and filed 
so many splintered opinions that there seemed to be no consensus among the 
justices. Lawyers and judges were understandably baffled about the state of the 
law. 
</P>
<P>
Now, in voiding a Richmond, Va., plan that guaranteed black and other minority 
subcontractors 30% of that city's construction contracts, the court has struck 
a blow against affirmative action and created more confusion in the process. 
Although the vote against the Richmond "set-aside" plan was 6 to 3, only two 
other justices fully supported the chief opinion by Justice Sandra Day 
O'Connor; three others, nominally in the majority, pointedly dissociated 
themselves from parts of her opinion. A casual reader of the opinion, Richmond 
vs. Croson, would need graph paper and plenty of patience to keep track of who 
supported what. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor, for example, commanded five votes for the proposition that "the sorry 
history of both private and public discrimination in this country cannot 
justify a rigid racial quota" like Richmond's. Instead, these five said, a city 
could impose affirmative action in its construction contracts only if there is 
a "strong basis in evidence" that blacks or other minorities were purposely 
excluded from doing business with the city. 
</P>
<P>
What constitutes "strong basis in evidence?"Ah, that's where Richmond vs. 
Croson falls apart. Five justices agreed that mere statistical 
underrepresentation isn't sufficient, even though minority-owned businesses 
managed to land less than 1% of the $124 million in construction contracts that 
were signed by the city of Richmond over a five-year period. And repeated 
findings by the Richmond City Council, the U.S. Labor Department and the U.S. 
Congress of discrimination against blacks in the construction business would 
not suffice, the same five justices decreed. O'Connor, losing her majority, 
mustered only three other votes for her suggestion that some "narrowly tailored 
racial preference" might be justified if white contractors had systematically 
excluded minority businesses from subcontracting opportunities. Only two other 
justices went along with her idea that affirmative action might be in order if 
the city had become a passive participant in the construction industry's 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor's difficulties in defining just what is needed to justify affirmative 
action, short of a "blacks-need-not-apply" sign, stem from the fact that two of 
her colleagues, Justices Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy, actually oppose 
nearly all forms of affirmative action. Scalia admits this, in a concurring 
opinion extolling the ideal of a racially neutral society; a purist, he would 
offer relief only to individuals who could prove that they had personally 
suffered injustices. Kennedy, though sympathetic to Scalia, declines to go that 
far because it would mean reversing most of the court's previous forays into 
affirmative action. And the court, though putting racial preferences to remedy 
discrimination in the same suspect category as laws that blatantly discriminate 
on the basis of race, does so without overturning any of its own prior holdings 
-- a truly baffling turn of events. 
</P>
<P>
In the states and hundreds of cities that have adopted "set-aside" programs 
like Richmond's, the court's latest pronouncement is likely to engender 
considerable confusion. O'Connor's opinion offers almost no guidance about what 
kind of discrimination warrants affirmative action. It seems to require -- one 
can't be sure -- self-criticism and fault-finding that most city councils and 
legislatures would find politically unpalatable and practically unattainable. 
How likely is it that lawmakers will admit that they or the contractors whom 
they hired discriminated against minority-run businesses, particularly if it 
might make them vulnerable to civil-rights suits? And how are they to document 
why a contractor favored one subcontractor over another? Somewhere in Richmond 
vs. Croson, the court may have articulated a new affirmative-action rule -- but 
an impossible one.

A PARK IN THE BALANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a recent sunny afternoon a young woman sat sketching from a rocky perch in 
the Santa Monica Mountains that overlooked the Pacific Ocean in one direction 
and acres of unspoiled land in another. Like thousands of people in Los Angeles 
who hike or ride or learn about nature in the park every year, she was 
benefiting from the vision and energy of leaders in the fight to create the 
Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. They are still fighting to get 
the park finished, and the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has a key 
role to play in the latest round. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors will have before them on Feb. 2 a land-use decision that will 
determine the price of the former site of the Renaissance Faire. The Santa 
Monica Mountains Conservancy, a state agency that has often been able to buy 
available parkland faster than the federal government can, wants to buy the 
land, known as the Arthur H. Whizin property. The current owner, a developer 
who says that he doesn't want to sell the land, seeks to build 159 homes on the 
property instead of 103 as originally proposed. If the supervisors approve the 
larger number, their decision could make the land far more valuable and 
therefore too expensive for possible park acquisition even if the conservancy 
were able to persuade the owner to change his mind about selling. 
</P>
<P>
Rejecting the plan to build more homes, however, would show congressional 
critics that Los Angeles County cares about the park and is willing to do its 
part to ensure its completion. 
</P>
<P>
The timing is important. Last year, for the first time in several years, 
Congress approved $11 million in land acquisition. With that money the federal 
government is paying back the conservancy for purchasing 779 acres in Zuma 
Canyon and 1,655 acres in the Circle X property that contains the highest point 
in the mountains -- Sandstone Peak, elevation 3,111 feet. In turn, the park 
service has asked the conservancy to pursue the purchase of the Whizin 
property. 
</P>
<P>
Zuma Canyon and Circle X, where the young artist was at work, are invaluable 
additions tothe park. Next on the list is the Whizin property near an area that 
is already being developed.The park needs this land as open space and to 
connect existing parkland to the major north-south trail through the mountains. 
By holding the line on zoning so that the price won't soar, the county can 
demonstrate its commitment to the park both to Washington and to its own 
constituents.

CONSUMERS AS VICTIMS -- AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
American consumers may be in for yet another economic diddling, to the cheers 
of the Big Three U.S. auto companies. On Jan. 4 the Customs Service announced 
that it would stop classifying imported vans and sport-utility vehicles as cars 
and instead call them trucks -- a switch that would work to increase tenfold, 
to 25%, the tariffs on those vehicles. Such an action, reversing more than 20 
years of precedent, would add between $1,500 and $6,000 to the price of each 
affected import. It would also violate a U.S. commitment to define its 
duty-eligible products the same way its major trading partners do. Finally -- 
surprise, surprise -- it would give the U.S. auto companies still another 
profit-boosting competitive break. 
</P>
<P>
And so once again protectionism threatens to dip into the pockets of consumers, 
for no defensible reason. The United States, lest it be forgotten, is about to 
begin its ninth consecutive year of limits on Japanese car imports, during 
which time, according to the Commerce Department, foreign-car prices have 
soared 82% while the average price of a domestic model has risen 61%. If 
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady lets stand the Customs Service ruling, the 
cost to consumers would be an estimated $1 billion or more, figuring about $500 
million in higher prices for foreign minivans and sport-utility vehicles, with 
a similar amount added from opportunistic price increases by domestic 
producers. 
</P>
<P>
Last week the chairmen of the Big Three jointly called on Brady not to 
interfere with the Customs Service ruling, contending that to do otherwise 
could cost the Treasury hundreds of millions in anticipated tariff revenues. Of 
the many hundreds of millions more that consumers would have to pay, the 
chairmen said nothing. Perhaps they felt that it would be unseemly to do so, 
given the imminent announcement by the auto makers of more than $11 billion in 
profits last year. 
</P>
<P>
The Big Three have not claimed harm or unfair competition from imports of 
minivans and sport-utility vehicles, nor is it possible to see how they could: 
Detroit controls 95% of the U.S. market for minivans and 75% for compact sport 
vehicles. The real harm inherent in what's going on would be in America's 
relations with its trading partners and in the larceny that would be committed 
against consumers. President Bush campaigned against protectionism. Very soon, 
when the Treasury decision comes down on the Customs Service's ruling, the 
country will see if he meant it.

WASTING WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The next time you have to ask for a glass of water in a restaurant, or have to 
flush your toilet twice or take a long shower because of the water restricting 
devices we are being required to install, think about this. 
</P>
<P>
Down here in Los Angeles Harbor, on Miner Street, there is a huge pile of coal 
which is continuously replenished as ships load it up and take it to foreign 
buyers for the manufacture of steel. The coal pile is on land belonging to the 
city of Los Angeles. It is leased from the city by the Kaiser Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The coal is brought in by train and piled up. Since the pile is in the windiest 
part of the harbor, coal dust has been a continuing problem, covering boats in 
the nearby marina, sifting down on the surrounding neighborhoods, and fouling 
the harbor waters. To keep the dust down, water cannons mounted on poles and on 
roving trucks spray the pile almost continuously. 
</P>
<P>
I have just received figures which put the amount of water thus used at 105 
million gallons a year. And, because salt has a negative effect on the 
manufacture of steel, those 105 million gallons a year are fresh water! That's 
a lot of showers and a hell of a lot of glasses of water. 
</P>
<P>
And this obscene waste of our precious water is all because they refuse to move 
the operation to a less windy part of the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
By the way, the coal is shipped to Korea to make steel for Hyundais and to 
Taiwan to make steel for, among other things, the low-flow shower heads the DWP 
buys in Taiwan and mails to us.

'BENNETT THE MENACE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your editorial ("Bennett the Menace" Jan. 13) on the newly-appointed drug czar 
concluded correctly that the best approach to the drug problems in our 
communities is to fund education and treatment programs. Apparently, the 
prospects seem remote. We cannot stop the flow of drugs into the U.S., the 
"zero tolerance" program was a massive waste of resources in search of the 
evening news, and the "just say no" approach of the Reagan era was naive and 
simplistic. Working with the drug user is an individual, one-day-at-a-time 
proposition. 
</P>
<P>
The forces that are at work on young people are complex and powerful, yet there 
are many hundreds of teen-agers in Los Angeles who have become and stayed sober 
at impressively early ages. What is less well understood is that the drug 
user's parents are integrally co-dependent with the user and their lives have 
become unmanageable, too. Often the parents deny the problem and/or feel 
isolated, angry, baffled, embarrassed and terrified. Both the young drug users 
and their parents need a better way to deal with their problems and with each 
other. Happily, there are tools by which many families have recovered and grown 
closer as a result. 
</P>
<P>
There are several effective programs in the Los Angeles area. One, the Palmer 
Drug Abuse Program of Los Angeles Inc., offers twice weekly meetings and 
support groups for both youth and their parents, individual and family 
counseling, education, training and sober activities. Unfortunately, it is a 
not-for-profit organization which is meagerly funded by donations and minimal 
fees for counseling and has shrunk in an effort to stay afloat. 
</P>
<P>
Your editorial shows that federal funds will continue to be wasted in burning 
down crops in far-off jungles and in negotiations with foreign countries while 
William Bennett glows in the headlines thinking he has done his job. The 
problem is to address the drug user and his/her family in our communities, but 
the agencies that have a chance of doing that are starving.

'BENNETT THE MENACE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President George Bush has nominated Bennett to head the new White House Office 
of National Drug Control Policy. Bennett, who has been described as tough and 
combative, may have the right temperament for the dictatorial powers implied by 
the term "drug czar." I hope, however, that Bennett will not set up the kind of 
repressive police state that would be needed to succeed in eradicating drug 
use. 
</P>
<P>
We should not replace a great evil with an even greater one. Decriminalizing 
drugs would be a more positive step to reducing the staggering social cost of 
drug addiction and would allow us to focus more attention on eliminating the 
root cause of habitual drug use: low self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
I also hope that the public spotlight cast on Bennett by his new position will 
help him overcome his personal addictions to smoking and to overeating.

SYRIA'S ASSAD, MOSCOW'S STALKING HORSE IN MIDEAST, WON'T EASILY TURN TOWARD 
PEACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRAHAM E. FULLER, Graham E. Fuller, a former vice chairman of the National 
Intelligence Council, is a senior political scientist with RAND Corp. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Syria is in the process of moving from pre-eminent Soviet asset in the Middle 
East to primary liability. This is not because of what Syria is now doing in 
the region, but because of what Moscow is now doing in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Syrian President Hafez Assad, arguably the most brilliant political tactician 
in the Middle East in a generation, has for years been the Soviets' single best 
investment in the region. He has pursued a bold vision of Syria's interests 
that leaves no place for peaceful settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict. This 
de facto rejectionist policy has brought him the leadership of the Arab world 
for nearly two decades. 
</P>
<P>
By his insistence on maintaining the Arab struggle against Israel, Assad has 
served his own interests exceedingly well. His policy has justified a claim to 
major supplies of advanced Soviet weaponry. To pursue the "Arab confrontation," 
he has successfully demanded large sums of oil money from the Persian Gulf 
states that fear Syria's power and feel guilty and politically exposed if they 
do not pay something more concrete than lip service to "the cause." He has 
arrogated to Syria the right, as the leading confrontation state, to direct the 
politics of the Palestinian movement against Israel. He has intimidated most 
Arab states into lending Syria support in a variety of ways simply because they 
have been afraid to cross him; Syria has not shrunk from occasional "reminders" 
-- unattributed acts of violence or even assassination of officials -- against 
hostile or unresponsive regimes. He has for years been able to block broader 
Arab moves toward moderation at Arab summits where consensus has ruled. And 
Assad has seen his praetorian role in Lebanon as an extension of his need to 
control the politics of all states that border on Israel. Jordan has not been 
exempt from such pressures; King Hussein has always understood his own limits 
in directly opposing Syrian interests. 
</P>
<P>
In short, continuous confrontation has bought Assad a great deal of influence, 
authority, money, arms, power and even grudging respect in the Arab world. 
Above all, he has been able to legitimize his minority regime of Alawites who 
constitute less than 15% of the Syrian population in a largely Sunni Muslim 
country. Despite serious economic problems and periodic setbacks and many 
conflicts with Israel, Assad has been able to command virtually unquestioned 
domestic leadership since 1970. 
</P>
<P>
Why should Assad want to change all this? What does peace hold out for him? For 
nearly two decades the answer has been: very little. True peace would require 
Assad to give up most of the advantages that he derives from confrontation. 
Above all, he would slip from the leadership of the Arab nationalist struggle 
down to a modest second place in a peace camp dominated by rival Egypt. But 
only a genuine peace, as distinct from mere non-belligerence, offers the 
prospect of Israel's returning the Golan Heights. 
</P>
<P>
Alliance with a state like Syria has been ideal for the Soviet Union since the 
early '70s. For several decades Moscow has found its interests best served 
through the maintenance of a state of controlled tension in the region: While 
not wanting war, Moscow has found that such tension played to its own strong 
suit as arms purveyor to radical states, and also keptthe United States at a 
disadvantage in the Arab world, where Washington was perceived as 
single-mindedly and exclusively concerned with Israel's security. Assad could 
therefore be counted on to masterfully accomplish what the Soviets also wanted 
in the region: the weakening of moderates and the blocking of U.S. initiatives 
toward a Pax Americana. All that Moscow needed to do was supply the military 
wherewithal to enable Assad to do his thing. This alliance was not, of course, 
free of friction. But on the whole it was a valuable investment. 
</P>
<P>
Today Moscow's agenda has changed. Mikhail Gorbachev's sweeping revolution at 
home, involving a total redefinition of the character of Russian national 
power, has established domestic and international priorities that leave little 
room for regional conflicts of dubious value and considerable risk. The 
"zero-sum quality" of Soviet calculations toward competition with the United 
States in the Third World is sharply diminishing. I believe that Gorbachev has 
turned a sharp strategic corner in which, for the first time, he now views 
Soviet interests as being fulfilled by a peaceful settlement of the 
Arab-Israeli problem. He does see this settlement as involving some kind of 
eventual Palestinian state -- but then so does most of the world, including our 
European allies. 
</P>
<P>
If the Soviet strategic priority has shifted dramatically, then Assad's 
long-brilliant blocking game no longer serves the Soviet purpose; indeed, it 
becomes Moscow's No. 1 headache. 
</P>
<P>
Assad is his own man -- shrewd, pragmatic, careful and clear in his own 
priorities. He does not want a peaceful settlement on any terms remotely 
acceptable to Israel. He does not want an independent Palestinian state, which 
would lie under the shadow of Israel and Jordan. He wants a PLO subservient to 
his interests. He wants to maintain Syria as a formidable military force on 
terms of rough parity with Israel that can never be ignored in Israeli 
calculations. 
</P>
<P>
These goals do not seem to complement Gorbachev's priorities today as he moves 
toward normalization with Israel and places heavy pressure on the PLO to 
moderate and seek accommodation with Israel. He will find Assad's erstwhile 
brilliance now working against broader Soviet interests. 
</P>
<P>
If Syria could ever be compelled to join a peaceful settlement -- always 
questionable -- the time may now be arriving. Syrian isolation, its desperate 
economic situation, the reemergence of its bitter rival Iraq after the gulf 
war, the return of Egypt to the Arab fold after more than a decade of Camp 
David disgrace -- all these elements pose major new problems to traditional 
Syrian policies. But the shift in Soviet policy is likely to be the straw that 
breaks the Syrian camel's back. 
</P>
<P>
Assad, as shrewd as he is, cannot fail to observe these signs in the firmament 
of Middle East politics. We see him displaying more moderation, improving ties 
with key moderates like Egypt and Morocco. But Assad will not easily abandon 
his vision for Syria. No longer able to explicitly block peace from the 
outside, he may well now be playing a subtler game, seeking to move within the 
framework of negotiations where he will set conditions for a comprehensive 
settlement that cannot be met. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the case, Moscow has its work cut out for itself. If Gorbachev can 
ever actually "deliver" Assad, he will have more than earned his way to a 
central position at the peace table.

CITY COUNCIL AGREES TO SEEK CHILD-CARE STUDY GRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taking the first step toward achieving Mayor Maureen O'Connor's promise of 
improved child care for city employees, the San Diego City Council agreed 
Tuesday to apply for a $25,000 state grant to fund a comprehensive study of its 
options. 
</P>
<P>
But the vote did not come without lengthy public questioning from some council 
members who said they are tired of studies and want to see action on the 
pressing concern. 
</P>
<P>
At the urging of Councilman Ron Roberts and others, the council agreed to speed 
O'Connor's call for a city child-care coordinator by referring that proposal to 
a council committee immediately. The child-care study, in contrast, could take 
six to eight months. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm concerned about studying it for another eight months, and the need grows 
on a daily basis," Councilman Wes Pratt said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're ready to go. In fact, the women of this city have been ready to go for 
five years," Councilwoman Abbe Wolfsheimer said. 
</P>
<P>
During her annual State of the City address Jan. 9, O'Connor pledged that the 
city would "take the lead" in providing on-site child care for city employees, 
reading and recreation programs for school-age children and a "children's czar" 
to coordinate child-care opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
The application, due Friday in the state Department of Education, seeks $25,000 
to determine how the city can best promote inexpensive, quality child care, 
said Max Drumheller, an associate analyst in the city's Office of Community 
Services. 
</P>
<P>
At the urging of council members, it will also include references to the city's 
plans for a child-care coordinator, a "public-private partnership" to promote 
child-care opportunities and an advisory board on child-care issues, Drumheller 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Existing child-care opportunities for city employees include the downtown 
Bayside Children's Center, which gives priority to city workers. 
</P>
<P>
With only 10 of the $25,000 grants available, the city faces stiff competition 
for the funds. About 150 other cities and counties are applying, including the 
County Board of Supervisors, O'Connor said.

2 HELD WITHOUT BAIL IN SLAYING CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two men accused in the execution-style slaying of an 82-year-old Vista man 
whose body was found on Camp Pendleton were ordered held without bail Tuesday 
by U. S. Magistrate Irma Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Wayne LaFleur, 22, and Nick Michael Holm, 20, were arrested last week by 
FBI agents on suspicion of murdering Otto Bloomquist, who was last seen alive 
by his wife at Plaza Camino Real shopping center in Carlsbad. 
</P>
<P>
"When you look at the nature of the crime . . . I agree with the government 
there can be no more heinous crime," Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutor Larry Burns said the slaying was predatory. 
</P>
<P>
"The affidavit indicates that both set out to accost an elderly person," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"This was execution," Burns said. "It chills the sensibilities to think about 
killing someone in this manner." Bloomquist was shot five times, according to 
Burns. 
</P>
<P>
The body of Bloomquist was discovered Jan. 15 in a remote area of Camp 
Pendleton, northwest of Fallbrook, five days after he disappeared. Because the 
body was discovered on federal property, the FBI is handling the investigation.

PARENTS CAMPAIGNING FOR A HIGH SCHOOL FOR BRAINY STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM ENRIQUEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Parents of highly gifted students at two San Fernando Valley schools on Tuesday 
started a campaign to persuade Los Angeles school district officials to create 
a high school for students with high IQs. 
</P>
<P>
Such a school would cater to highly gifted students with IQs of least 145 and 
to gifted children with IQs of at least 130 but would also accept minority 
students who demonstrate potential for high achievement, the parents said at a 
Studio City meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The parents said that a "high school for advanced studies" could continue 
programs for highly gifted students begun at elementary and junior high school 
levels. Carpenter Avenue Elementary School in Studio City and Walter Reed 
Junior High School in North Hollywood have such programs. 
</P>
<P>
"These kids are going to be penalized when they get to high school," said 
Robert Claire, a Studio City physician whose daughter attends Carpenter. "When 
they've already done the work, it's boring for them." 
</P>
<P>
Students at Carpenter and Reed must be certified by school psychologists as 
having IQs of at least 145 to be admitted to the program for highly gifted 
students there. About 1% or less of the general population have IQs that high. 
</P>
<P>
Dan M. Isaacs, district superintendent in charge of high schools, said that 
highly intelligent students already can participate in programs at district 
high schools. Through the district's advanced placement program, college credit 
can be earned in such courses as calculus and physics, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Isaacs said that gifted and highly gifted students can take courses at area 
colleges and universities while still in high school. 
</P>
<P>
But Claire said that many highly gifted students have already taken advanced 
placement courses by the time they reach high school. The only option left for 
those students is to earn college credit, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of them are too young for college," Claire said. "We want them to be able 
to be kids, to participate in athletic teams, drama and band." 
</P>
<P>
Claire said the group is seeking corporate donations to help finance the 
school, which would be open to students districtwide. 
</P>
<P>
The district, in cooperation with the Los Angeles County Board of Education, 
studied a similar proposal several years ago, said Lorna Round, the district's 
associate superintendent for instruction. The idea was dropped in 1986 because 
such a school would be too expensive, she said.

TOXICS DRIVE YIELDS BIG BILL FOR BURBANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY LOUISE KAZMIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The disposal cost of household hazardous waste collected in Burbank over the 
weekend is about $46,000 over budget, city officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Battalion Chief M.W. Johnson of the Burbank Fire Department said he learned 
Tuesday that the bill for disposing of the materials collected during the 
city's first toxic roundup is $126,409. The City Council had allocated $80,000 
for the project. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said that more hazardous materials than expected were deposited at the 
Burbank Public Service Yard during Saturday's daylong collection. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a fixed cost on the service, but it was based on the amount of gallons 
and pounds that were collected," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Members of 616 households deposited toxic substances at the site, Johnson said, 
and some brought multiple loads. In addition, toxics were picked up at the 
homes of 159 elderly and handicapped people. 
</P>
<P>
The city amassed 186 55-gallon drums of corrosive liquids and solids, paint 
products, flammable solids and poisons; 13 55-gallon drums of oil-related 
products; 600 pounds of oxidizers; 13 bags of asbestos; 4,872 gallons of paint, 
and 59 car batteries, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a lot more than we anticipated, but we are very glad to see it," 
Johnson said. "We were obviously overwhelmed by the amounts. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of old pesticides and things had been in people's garages for 20 or 30 
years," he said. "We had problems identifying some of the stuff and had to use 
chemical analysis to decide what it was so we could package it properly." 
</P>
<P>
The identifying, packaging and transporting of the waste was handled by 
Disposal Control Services, whose employees worked overnight to clear the 
collection site of the toxic materials by Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
The substances were shipped to five sites, including an incinerator facility in 
Louisiana, special landfills in Santa Barbara County and Palo Alto and a lab in 
Chula Vista, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant City Manager Steve Helvey said he expects the City Council to approve 
the additional money to pay for the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what city governments are for -- to provide these kinds of services to 
the residents," Helvey said. 
</P>
<P>
State law prohibits disposing of household toxics through normal public trash 
collection, so many citizens -- uncertain how to get rid of the materials -- 
store them in their garages, Johnson said. Such storage is hazardous, he said.

LAKERS ARE NO LONGER HOME FREE; 
</P>
<P>
FORUM STREAK ENDS AT 17 AS NEW YORK WINS, 122-117 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM McMANIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pretensions of perfection at the Forum, which seemed a reasonable enough goal 
for the Lakers until now, went down in a hail of turnovers, failed shot 
attempts and defensive lapses in the final frenzied minutes Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Moments after Magic Johnson's final, futile 3-point attempt clanged off the 
back of the rim, the New York Knicks, those long-distance specialists from the 
East, ended the Lakers' 17-game home winning streak with a 122-117 victory 
before a sellout crowd of 17,505. 
</P>
<P>
There was a certain symmetry, it seemed, to this one. In November, the Lakers 
handed the Knicks what has turned out to be their only home loss. Now, the 
Lakers also are no longer invincible at home. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, their only loss at home is to us, and our only loss at home is to them," 
said Johnson, who recorded his ninth triple-double of the season with 26 
points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists. 
</P>
<P>
Knick players talked of revenge after the Lakers beat them at Madison Square 
Garden. And after becoming the first team to beat the Lakers at home this 
season, the Atlantic Division leaders said it might prove important in the 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
"We proved we could stay with them on their home court," said Knick forward 
Gerald Wilkins, who scored 10 of his 14 points in the fourth quarter and had an 
important steal in the final minute. 
</P>
<P>
"That could mean a lot should we face them somewhere down the line in the 
playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
To that, Johnson shrugged and said the Knicks are capable of being in such a 
playoff position. But Johnson also has heard such motivational talk from many 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's after you," Johnson said. "It goes with the territory." 
</P>
<P>
It took a little more than 44 minutes, but the Knicks finally invaded the 
Lakers' inner sanctum and took a 114-113 lead on Patrick Ewing's 2 free throws. 
</P>
<P>
The teams exchanged baskets for the next few possessions before Laker turnovers 
and missed shots were converted by the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
With the Knicks holding a 116-115 lead and the Lakers in possession, guard 
Byron Scott passed where no Laker was near the ball, Mychal Thompson leaving 
the area for a backdoor cut to the basket. 
</P>
<P>
The Knicks took full advantage. Mark Jackson made 2 free throws, giving New 
York a 118-115 lead. But after Johnson's inside basket brought the Lakers 
within 1 again, Wilkins continued his fourth-quarter assault. 
</P>
<P>
With the ball at the top of the key, Wilkins faked Scott to the left, then 
drove right for an easy layup. The basket put the Knicks ahead, 120-117, with 
2:07 to play. The score remained that way until there were 4 seconds left, when 
Charles Oakley made 2 free throws. In the more than 2 minutes between, the 
Lakers looked like the inexperienced team and the Knicks the reliable veterans. 
After handling New York's trapping defense most of the game, getting easy 
layups after breaking the press, the Lakers broke down when it mattered most. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers had the ball with 54 seconds left, when Coach Pat Riley called a 
timeout. When play resumed, the Lakers isolated Johnson, with the ball, and 
James Worthy was posting low with Wilkins draped all over him. Johnson passed 
once to Worthy, who quickly returned it. But when Johnson tried to repeat the 
sequence, Wilkins had slipped around Worthy and intercepted the ball. 
</P>
<P>
It turned out that the Lakers would get another chance to tie, after the 
Knicks' Trent Tucker missed an outside shot with 28 seconds remaining. But 
Johnson missed a 3-point shot, the rebound deflecting off 2 Knick players and 
out of bounds. It was Laker ball with 17 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of trying for a 3-pointer, the Lakers this time went inside to 
Thompson, who missed an uncontested shot. The ball was batted out to Johnson, 
standing alone just beyond the 3-point line. 
</P>
<P>
But Johnson's shot was long, and Worthy fouled Oakley while going for the 
rebound. Oakley made both free throws to close out the Knicks' win. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers lost despite shooting 54.5% (to the Knicks' 53.3%), outrebounding 
the Knicks, 39-35, and outplaying them for most of the game. 
</P>
<P>
But the Lakers' downfall came at the end, when they simply could not handle the 
Knicks' pressure. New York Coach Rick Pitino said the Knicks wore out the 
Lakers, but Riley said fatigue was not a factor. 
</P>
<P>
"We made too many mental mistakes down the stretch," said Riley, whose team 
also got 26 points from Worthy and 21 from A.C. Green. "We made 2 or 3 
turnovers in the last 2 minutes, and you can't expect to win when you do that. 
</P>
<P>
"We were ahead 80% of the time, but we made some defensive mistakes, and Gerald 
Wilkins got off on us. Byron threw one away, and James and Buck (Johnson) 
couldn't get together on that pass in the post. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it was fatigue. I think we played well enough to win most of the 
time. But unless you do it all the time, you can't beat a team like the 
Knicks." 
</P>
<P>
Said Pitino: "The Lakers played as well or better against our press than any 
team has all season. I told our players at the half that fatigue would be the 
key factor in the second half, and the team that had the best legs would win. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew they gave everything in the first half, and we knew our best was yet 
to come." 
</P>
<P>
Ewing scored 25 points, and Oakley got 23 points and 11 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
The Knicks weren't too bad in the first half, either. They never led, but that 
did not mean they played poorly. 
</P>
<P>
Every time the Knicks threatened, the Lakers responded with surges that enabled 
them to take a 69-63 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers' biggest first-half lead was 10 points late in the first quarter, 
when Thompson completed a fast break with a dunk. Thompson hung onto the rim 
for a moment before crashing to the floor. His feet out in front of him, 
Thompson landed squarely on his back and remained there until play could be 
stopped. 
</P>
<P>
He stayed in the lineup, and the Lakers held the lead, although the Knicks cut 
it to 4 by the end of the quarter, mainly on long-range shooting. New York 
outscored the Lakers, 10-4, in the final 2 minutes of the period, led by 
Jackson with 2 3-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
The Knicks pulled within a point of the Lakers five times midway through the 
second quarter. But each time the Knicks threatened, the Lakers responded, 
Green and Worthy leading the offense. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the Knicks' best chance gone awry came after Green made only 1 free 
throw to give the Lakers a 57-55 lead with 3:40 to play in the first half. But 
Jackson missed an open jumper, and then the Knicks were called for their second 
illegal defense violation in the half, resulting in a technical foul. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson made the technical, then Thompson rebounded a missed shot and scored 
inside for a 60-55 Laker lead. Oakley, arguing that a foul should have been 
called, was given a technical foul. Johnson then made another technical for a 
6-point Laker lead. 
</P>
<P>
After a Knick turnover, Johnson scored on a fast-break layup to increase the 
lead to 8. 
</P>
<P>
But with a team saturated with 3-point shooters and strong inside players such 
as Ewing and Oakley, the Knicks could not be counted out, even after the Lakers 
extended the lead to 99-91 entering the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"We should have played better down the stretch," Johnson said. "It was mental 
mistakes. They did a great job. They have the best trap in the league. And in 
the fourth quarter, we just didn't attack it." 
</P>
<P>
So, the Lakers' quest for a 41-0 record at the Forum ended in home game number 
18. Perhaps it had just been wishful thinking all along, because they didn't 
seem crushed to see it end. 
</P>
<P>
"This one's history," Riley said. "I don't want to dismiss it, but it's over."

KINGS LOSE A WIN IN LAST 5 SECONDS, SETTLE FOR 4-4 TIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five seconds away from finishing a torturous trip with a sigh of relief, the 
Kings gagged instead. 
</P>
<P>
A last-gasp goal by Washington's Dave Christian, one of three goals the 
Capitals scored in the final 6:38, sent the Kings home with a 4-4 tie and 
without a win on their four-game sojourn. 
</P>
<P>
What could have been a successful debut for newcomers Jay Miller, the fighter 
who unexpectedly assisted on a goal, and Steve Kasper, the defensive whiz and 
faceoff artist who did exactly what was expected of him without benefit of a 
single practice with his new teammates, disintegrated in appalling fashion with 
just a few ticks left on the Capital Centre clock. 
</P>
<P>
That's when Kings goalie Glenn Healy, needing only to fire the puck around the 
boards to kill off the remaining time, instead left it for unsuspecting 
defenseman Steve Duchesne. 
</P>
<P>
Washington's Bengt Gustafsson got to the puck first, flipped it to ex-King 
Larry Murphy behind the net, and before King defenseman Doug Crossman could 
react, Murphy fed the puck to Christian, who beat Healy from about 10 feet 
away. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very upset," said Duchesne, who could just as well have been speaking for: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Coach Robbie Ftorek, who blamed himself for not calling time out after 
Scott Stevens' power-play goal made it 4-3 with 49 seconds left; 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bernie Nicholls, whose chance to score 50 goals in 50 games is down to 
Thursday night's game with Vancouver after he drew a 10-minute misconduct 
penalty and a game misconduct penalty at 11:39 of the third period; 
</P>
<P>
 -- Wayne Gretzky, who found it inconceivable that referee Paul Stewart would 
toss Nicholls; 
</P>
<P>
 -- And most of all, the disconsolate Healy, who was perfect when the teams 
were at even strength but was victimized 4 times when Washington had the extra 
man: 3 power-play goals and the final one, when goalie Clint Malarchuk was 
pulled for an extra skater. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a good team," Duchesne said, "but it seems like we're panicking. We're 
not doing the same things we did in the first 2 periods tonight. There are a 
lot of things we're going to have to talk about." 
</P>
<P>
With a win, that conversation undoubtedly would have revolved around Tom 
Laidlaw's goal 41 seconds into the game, the 3 goals by Mike Krushelnyski, Luc 
Robitaille and John Tonelli in a span of 2:46 of the second period, when the 
Kings crafted a 4-1 lead, and the sound positional play that marked the Kings' 
effort for 54 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was one of the best defensive games we've played in a long time," 
Laidlaw said. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Kings were forced to dwell on the mix-up at game's end, as well as 
the disparity in whistles that produced 34 penalty minutes for the Kings to 6 
for the Capitals, 2 King power plays to 6 for Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"They cut the boards off," said Healy, who had retreated behind his net to 
retrieve the puck, looked both ways, saw Gustafsson advancing his way in front 
of him, then decided to leave the puck for Duchesne. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to give it away. I should have shot it. I screwed up, and their 
man beat our man to the puck." 
</P>
<P>
Duchesne never expected to be involved in a race at the finish. 
</P>
<P>
"Five seconds left -- get rid of it," he said. "Crossman thought Glenn was 
going to shoot the puck, I thought he was going to shoot the puck, too. Shoot 
the puck and go back to your net. Five seconds left in the game." 
</P>
<P>
The Kings' troubles began building earlier, when Nicholls complained to referee 
Stewart about an interference call on King defenseman Dale DeGray with 8:21 
left. 
</P>
<P>
"I was tired of all the penalties he was calling on us," Nicholls said. "I said 
to him, 'What the . . . are you doing?" 
</P>
<P>
That inquiry only caused Stewart to put his lips to the whistle once more, 
whereupon Nicholls uttered the unmentionable, triggering his departure. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy is going for 50 goals in 50 games, and (Stewart) makes a call like 
that?" said Gretzky, debating the original misconduct call, not the game 
penalty, on Nicholls. 
</P>
<P>
"People are paying 25 bucks a ticket to see the guy go for 50 goals and the 
next thing you know he's out of the hockey game? I don't think Bernie was 
embarrassing anyone by questioning the call." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart obviously felt differently, and soon the Kings were the ones with red 
faces. With DeGray still in the box, Mike Millar deflected a shot by Mike 
Gartner to make it 4-2, Healy arguing futilely that Millar's stick was above 
his waist. 
</P>
<P>
Then wing Phil Sykes, playing one of his infrequent shifts, was called for 
tripping Gartner with 1:56 left. Stevens' slapshot went off Healy's left leg 
and pad but still had enough on it to make the net before the goalie could 
glove it. 
</P>
<P>
"They had a 3-on-1, and I went out and challenged Christian, who shot wide of 
the net," Healy said. "The puck went out to the defenseman, and I was still 
getting back from the 3-on-1. I still wasn't set when he (Stevens) shot. I was 
going one way, he went the other." 
</P>
<P>
That's when Ftorek said he should have called a timeout. Once Nicholls was 
tossed, he said, he went primarily with two lines. By calling a timeout, he 
said, he could have given his players a breather. 
</P>
<P>
Krushelnyski, Tonelli and Ron Duguay were on the ice when the Capitals -- who 
had lost their last three games, all at home, in the last minute -- forced an 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Wasn't Ftorek being a little hard on himself? 
</P>
<P>
"No, not at all -- it's a fact," he said, matter-of-factly. 
</P>
<P>
It's also a fact that the Kings, who started this trip just 6 points behind 
Calgary, have now doubled their deficit. 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
Right wings Dave Taylor and Igor Liba are both expected to be out at least a 
week after being examined in Los Angeles Tuesday. Taylor has inflammation in 
his right knee, according to a team spokesman, and rest has been prescribed. 
Coach Robbie Ftorek said Taylor has been on anti-inflammatory medication for 
some time, and the team doesn't want to take any further chances. Liba, 
meanwhile, has what a spokesman called a "mildly separated" shoulder after 
going into the boards Saturday at Hartford. It will be a week at the earliest 
before he practices. 
</P>
<P>
Center Steve Kasper, acquired in a trade from Boston Monday, arrived during the 
team's mid-day meal Tuesday, after the Kings' skatearound. Nonetheless, Ftorek 
sent Kasper out for 4 critical faceoffs during a scoreless overtime period, and 
Kasper won 3 of them. "In the game, I didn't think about it," Kasper said, "but 
I guess the easiest way to introduce yourself is to be thrown right into it." . 
. . Wayne Gretzky, who will celebrate his 28th birthday Thursday, had 2 
assists, giving him 104 points.

SCHOTTENHEIMER TO CHIEFS; CHARGERS LOOK ELSEWHERE 
</P>

<P>
Once upon a not-too-long-ago, the Chargers wanted to hire Marty Schottenheimer 
as their head coach. Schottenheimer, the winningest head coach in the AFC the 
past 3 seasons, became available last month when he quit his job with the 
Cleveland Browns in a personnel dispute with owner Art Modell. 
</P>
<P>
But, said Charger owner Alex Spanos Tuesday, "he (Schottenheimer) wanted total 
change. His demands were a little bit more than what we wanted." 
</P>
<P>
What Schottenheimer wanted in San Diego was clearance to bring in his own 
staff. The Chargers balked. So Tuesday, Schottenheimer accepted the vacant head 
coaching job in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
"In the course of my discussions with the Chargers, we covered a lot of 
ground," Schottenheimer said. "But no formal offer was forthcoming. Economics 
were not an issue. Alex indicated there were a number of people (current 
Charger assistants) he felt were capable. I didn't disagree with that. I just 
felt after discussions with Alex and Steve (Ortmayer, the Charger director of 
football operations) that the Kansas City situation afforded me more of a 
chance to get things straightened away in the most comfortable manner." 
</P>
<P>
The closest thing to a shot fired by either Spanos or Schottenheimer came when 
Schottenheimer told Kansas City reporters Tuesday: "I'm not interested in a 
rebuilding program." 
</P>
<P>
It's obvious he considered the Chargers to be in that category even though they 
finished with a better record (6-10) in 1988 than the Chiefs (4-11-1). 
Schottenheimer also said he considered Chiefs owner Lamar Hunt and Art Rooney, 
the late Steelers owner, to be the top two owners he has known in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
Schottenheimer's 4-year agreement with Kansas City temporarily moved George 
Seifert, the San Francisco 49ers defensive coordinator, to the head of the 
Chargers' list of potential successors to fired Al Saunders. Spanos and 
Ortmayer were scheduled to meet with Seifert Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
But the Chargers apparently are not at the top of Seifert's list. Modell said 
Tuesday that Seifert called him Monday night and "asked if he could come to 
Cleveland for an interview. We said, 'By all means.' " 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Seifert said he wanted to wait until 49er Coach Bill Walsh decided 
whether he was going to retire after leading San Francisco to its third world 
championship in 8 years. But more than one NFL source has suggested Walsh might 
be delaying his decision in hopes of squeezing 49er owner Eddie DeBartolo Jr. 
into renegotiating his contract and making him the first $2-million-a-year 
coach in the NFL. Seifert's active pursuit of the Browns' job is an indication 
he believes Walsh will return. 
</P>
<P>
That would leave Washington assistant Dan Henning as the leading candidate for 
the Charger job, although there's a school of thought that the chances of Ron 
Lynn, the current Charger defensive coordinator, grow by the day. "He's still 
being considered," Spanos said. 
</P>
<P>
The top longshot is former Illinois Coach Mike White. 
</P>
<P>
All three have strengths and weaknesses in the Chargers' eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Henning is the only one of the three with NFL head coaching experience. Plus, 
he has worked in Washington with Jerry Rhome, the Charger offensive 
coordinator. He has also indicated a willingness to work with the Charger staff 
if he gets the job. 
</P>
<P>
But Henning's 4-year coaching record in Atlanta was an horrendous 22-41-1. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn is seen as an defensive innovator with a reputation for producing great 
results with limited talent. White, a disciple of Walsh, has a similar 
reputation on the offensive side. 
</P>
<P>
White is out of coaching and working for a football scouting service in Newport 
Beach. Lynn remains under the Chargers' employ. But the archrival Raiders are 
pursuing him as a successor to fired defensive coordinator Charlie Sumner. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn is not trying to pressure the Chargers. But he knows he can't hold the 
Raiders off forever. "I'd like to have seen this all cleared up a week ago," he 
said. "But I don't see this (the prolonged search) as critical." 
</P>
<P>
The worst-case scenario for Lynn is the Raiders deciding on someone else to 
replace Sumner, followed by the Chargers' hiring of a head coach who wants to 
bring in his own defensive coordinator. The latter would have been the case 
with Schottenheimer. 
</P>
<P>
But it was a measure of the Chargers' desire to keep Lynn in their organization 
that they wouldn't accept Schottenheimer without requiring him to keep Lynn. 
</P>
<P>
Ortmayer speaks with Lynn frequently. Henning is scheduled to visit Spanos and 
Ortmayer in San Diego later this week. White and Ortmayer reportedly also will 
meet soon. 
</P>
<P>
Spanos said he hopes the Chargers will be able to name their new coach by "the 
end of next week." 
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Many people are still waiting for Charger owner Alex Spanos to comment on the 
firing of Al Saunders last month. But Spanos has been mostly silent on the 
subject. "It's all behind us," Spanos said Tuesday. "I wish him (Saunders) all 
the luck. I'm sure he'll do well." Pressed on the matter, Spanos said, "I'd 
rather go on with the future."

BURKE HOT, DEVILS TIE ISLANDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The New York Islanders, who won the tough Patrick Division last season, have 
been the worst team in the National Hockey League this season, but they had won 
3 games in a row after winning just 12 of their first 43. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for them, there's nothing like good goaltending to slow a team on 
a roll. 
</P>
<P>
Goalie Sean Burke, who still qualifies as a rookie, kept the New Jersey Devils 
from falling apart Tuesday night at Uniondale, N.Y., and when Brendan Shanahan 
scored in the third period, the Devils earned a 2-2 tie with the Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
Burke, not yet 22, played brilliantly in the stretch last season to put the 
Devils into the playoffs. After a slow start this season, he is playing well 
once again. 
</P>
<P>
The youngster stopped 38 shots, many of them spectacular saves. The Islanders 
built a 2-0 lead, but in the last 38 minutes, including overtime, they could 
not beat Burke. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly Hrudey played well in the nets for the Islanders, but it was Burke's 
performance that had everyone talking. 
</P>
<P>
"The way Burke was playing tonight," Hrudey said, "I knew I had to be on my 
toes just to keep us from losing. We had more chances to score, but Burke 
really stood his ground, especially in the second and third periods." 
</P>
<P>
Burke was at his best when the Islanders were working on the power play. Seven 
times they had the manpower advantage, but not once did they score. 
</P>
<P>
The tie continued the Devils' frustration at the Nassau Coliseum. Since the 
team's inception as the Kansas City Scouts in 1974, the franchise is only 
1-36-4 at Uniondale. 
</P>
<P>
Their only victory in the Coliseum was on Dec. 11, 1984. Since then, they are 
0-12-2. 
</P>
<P>
The Devils made good on 1 of 6 power-play opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 4, Vancouver 2 -- Troy Murray broke a 1-1 tie by scoring on a breakaway 
late in the second period, and newly acquired goaltender Alain Chevrier played 
a strong game in the Blackhawks' win at Vancouver, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was only the sixth for Chicago in 27 road games this season, but it 
was the second road win since the acquisition of Chevrier from the Winnipeg 
Jets last week. DAN HAFNER

<P>
IT HAS BECOME A SHOT ON GOALIES

Even before his all-star goalie, Grant Fuhr, was run over by Winnipeg's Andrew 
McBain in a game last Wednesday night and suffered a strained neck, Edmonton's 
Glen Sather said he has been concerned about the growing number of collisions 
involving goaltenders this season. 
</P>
<P>
The matter was discussed at the general managers' meeting in Florida last week, 
said Sather, the coach and general manager of the Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
It's about time, said King goalie Glenn Healy, who was leveled Saturday night 
by Hartford's Kevin Dineen and is rapidly tiring of the number of 
crease-crashers he has encountered this season. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, it's frustrating," Healy said. "I like to play fair -- I don't swing my 
stick at anybody, I don't chop at ankles, because I think that's cheap, so I 
don't think I should be constantly subjected to being bumped or worried about 
someone blind-siding me." 
</P>
<P>
The problem has worsened, Healy said, since Philadelphia goalie Brian Hextall 
was suspended for 10 games after he swung his stick at Edmonton's Kent Nilsson 
in the 1987 playoffs, injuring the Oiler forward. 
</P>
<P>
"Ever since then, it's been a joke," Healy said. "If I try to move a guy (out 
of the crease), the referee says something every time. 
</P>
<P>
"Kevin Dineen doesn't stop, and just runs me right over, he hits the 
goaltender. He figures, 'What's Healy going to do? He's not going to swing his 
stick.' 
</P>
<P>
"And they have this little built-in excuse that a defenseman carried them into 
you. No one was near Dineen when he ran me over." 
</P>
<P>
The worst offenders, according to Healy, are the Calgary Flames. He wouldn't 
name names, but center Joel Otto has been known to drive the net. And in a game 
earlier this season, Tim Hunter cross-checked Healy in the back of the head, 
knocking off his helmet, then rubbed his face into the ice, cutting the 
goaltender above the eye. 
</P>
<P>
The issue would seem to be covered by the National Hockey League rule book. 
Under Sec. 6, Rule 47 (c), a referee is instructed to call a minor or major 
penalty if a player charges the goaltender while he's in the crease. Charging 
is defined as taking more than two steps or strides before contact is made. 
</P>
<P>
It further states that either interference or charging should be called in 
every case an opposing player makes unnecessary contact with a goalkeeper. Even 
when the goalie is out of the crease, the rule states, he is not "fair game" to 
be hit. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, Healy says, is that referees are not making the call. 
</P>
<P>
"If a guy goes to the net and he's not being legitimately pushed by a 
defenseman, that's got to be interference," Healy said. "Referees have to stop 
calling it a push every time. 
</P>
<P>
"That excuse is a bunch of malarkey to me. If it's 2 minutes every time they 
run into a goalie, guys will stop doing it." 
</P>
<P>
Calgary and the Washington Capitals have been selected as the teams to visit 
Moscow and Leningrad for four exhibitions each against Soviet teams next fall. 
Capital defenseman Larry Murphy, a former No. 1 draft choice of the Kings, 
played for a Canadian midget team that went to the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"I was 16 and it's still the most amazing trip I've ever been on," Murphy told 
Robert Fachet of the Washington Post. "I took over a lot of jeans and bubble 
gum and I wound up with so much stuff I had to buy suitcases to bring it home. 
</P>
<P>
"I had so many rubles left at the end, I went out and bought everything I 
could, toys and fur hats and things. We stayed in a big hotel and the waiters 
in the dining room were always trying to make deals for jeans." 
</P>
<P>
Add Soviets: Ex-coach Don Cherry on the recent series against Soviet teams: 
"Every time I turned on the TV, I saw Russians. Are there any left in Russia? 
We used to see them every 4 years. Now we see them every 4 days." 
</P>
<P>
Talking Turkey: Whoever said hockey players aren't sensitive hasn't been to 
Quebec lately. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Nordiques stopped talking to reporters after one had referred to 
the team as turkeys. The term quickly caught on, especially since the French 
word for the bird is dinde, inspiring one radio station to sell "Nordinde" 
sweaters and to make up a song on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
The flap is over, but obviously there were some ruffled feathers. 
</P>
<P>
"Our actions were justified," said Peter Stastny of the Nordiques. "We accept 
criticism, even though sometimes they're cheap shots. But we can't tolerate 
being made fun of and treated poorly." 
</P>
<P>
Hockey Notes 
</P>
<P>
Former New York Islanders player and ex-Minnesota North Stars coach Lorne 
Henning is the front-runner to coach the Islanders after Al Arbour finishes 
this season, but another former Islander, Bobby Nystrom, said he'd like to be 
considered. Nystrom, a one-time Islander assistant who now does some 
broadcasting as well as being the team's director of corporate affairs, said he 
doubts he has a chance for the job, however. 
</P>
<P>
The Winnipeg Jets are retiring Bobby Hull's No. 9 on Feb. 19, a tribute that 
apparently could not happen as long as John Ferguson was general manager. "He 
didn't like Hull and that was that," said Mike Smith, who replaced the fired 
Ferguson Oct. 30. Hull played with the Jets from 1972-79 and helped them win 
two World Hockey Assn. titles before the WHA merged with the NHL in 1979. 
"Without Bobby Hull, I don't think there would be professional hockey in 
Winnipeg," Smith said. Hull's number was retired by the Chicago Blackhawks in 
1984, 12 years after he left. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota's Brian Bellows missed a 2:30 a.m. curfew in Chicago, after he failed 
to accompany the team back to its hotel and thus missed Coach Pierre Page's 
announcement that there would be a bed check. As punishment, Bellows was forced 
to take a cab to Chicago's O'Hare airport, pay for his own flight to St. Louis, 
pay for another cab to the hotel and for his room in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
Why Kevin Dineen isn't Hartford trainer Tom Woodcock's favorite player: 
Woodcock used the uniform numbers of six Whalers in a Connecticut lottery that 
had a jackpot of $9.7 million. He missed by one number, Dineen's No. 11.

<P>
Fishermen casting minijigs off the docks at Lake Henshaw in San Diego County 
are catching crappie by the dozens. 
</P>
<P>
Carl and Lee Stockdale of El Cajon teamed to catch 50 of them, and Dave and Pat 
Gibson, also of El Cajon, quit after reeling in 35. 
</P>
<P>
The fish, according to a lake spokeswoman, are biting on the small jigs "in 
every color," and most are weighing in at just under a pound.

<P>
RECORD-BREAKING FISH ARE STILL BEING CAUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Pete Thomas 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Given the passage of time, fishermen might be led to believe that most of the 
big freshwater fish have already been caught and that to make a record catch is 
becoming increasingly difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not true," said Bob Kutz, founder of the National Fresh Water Fishing 
Hall of Fame, a nonprofit organization and museum that recognizes freshwater 
records. "It's dropping a little bit, probably 10% a year, but we still qualify 
about 250 new records each year." 
</P>
<P>
Kutz said that in addition, his organization, based in Hayward, Wis., and not 
affiliated with the International Game Fish Assn., processes about 200 
outstanding angling awards for catches falling just short of record size. 
</P>
<P>
Most records are in the line-class category, but an average of 12 all-tackle 
records are broken each year, Kutz said. 
</P>
<P>
Notable catches for 1988 include: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Gary Helms' catch last February of a land-locked striped bass that weighed 
60 pounds 8 ounces. Helms' fish, caught at Melton Lake in Tennessee, surpassed 
a 59-pound 12-ounce striper caught on the Colorado River in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Several largemouth bass catches came close to George Perry's 56-year-old 
record 22-pound 4-ounce bass, caught in 1932 in Alabama's Montgomery Lake. 
Black bass line class records from 18 to 21 pounds have been processed by 
Kutz's organization in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Michael Manley's catch of a 38-pound 9-ounce brown trout last August at 
Arkansas' North Fork River. The same week, David Wooten caught a 34-pounder, 
good for a record in the 17-pound-test category. Manley's fish was caught on a 
treble hook and therefore didn't qualify for an IGFA mark. 
</P>
<P>
Said Kutz: "We feel a fish is a fish and a catch is a catch." 
</P>
<P>
On that note, it should be noted that the IGFA still recognizes a 35-pound 
15-ounce brown caught in Argentina in 1952. 
</P>
<P>
"We dropped that record because we determined it had been foul-hooked," Kutz 
said. "And we don't recognize fish that are foul-hooked." 
</P>
<P>
California deer hunters had relatively safe fall hunts in 1988, according to 
preliminary accounts by the DFG, which reported one fatality and four injuries 
directly related to the sport. 
</P>
<P>
A senior citizen, hunting in Lake County, died of a gunshot wound to the head 
from his own firearm. Officials said it appeared that the man had fallen, 
become entangled in fence wires, causing his rifle to discharge. 
</P>
<P>
The injuries: 
</P>
<P>
 -- In Los Angeles County, an archer was shot in the hip by his partner, who 
mistakenly shot into a brushy area where his companion was standing. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In Plumas County, two cousins stalking the same buck with archery equipment 
shot at it simultaneously from opposite sides of the animal. Both missed, but 
one of the arrows hit one of the men in the leg. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Another man, after hunting in Tehema County, climbed into his truck, where 
his gun discharged, blowing the thumb off his left hand. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Finally, a Tulare County hunter shooting across a canyon at what he thought 
was a buck, instead hit someone else's spotting scope, spraying fragments of 
the scope and bullet into the two nearby hunters. 
</P>
<P>
The DFG's California Wildlands Program, which enables the public to view 
wildlife in natural settings, has begun in nine wildlife areas or ecological 
reserves throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
For $2 a day -- proceeds go to state wildlife and habitat programs -- visitors 
can view or photograph various species of wildlife in their natural habitats. 
Tours, lectures, nature trails, displays and photographic blinds will be 
available. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California site, opening next Tuesday, is the Upper Newport Bay 
Ecological Reserve -- noted for bird-watching -- in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Passes and further information may be obtained from licensed DFG agents 
statewide. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Fletcher, chief deputy director of the Department of Fish and Game, will 
resign from his position in early March to become president of the Sportfishing 
Assn. of California, replacing Bill Nott, who is leaving for medical reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Nott had heart bypass surgery last November and remains hospitalized at St. 
Mary Medical Center because of complications stemming from post-polio syndrome. 
He has run the 235-member Long Beach-based organization, which represents the 
sportfishing community in legislative and legal issues, for the last 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
Fletcher, 45, worked as a skipper in the San Diego area for 12 years before 
joining the DFG. 
</P>
<P>
Briefly 
</P>
<P>
The Easter Seal's junior disabled learn-to-fish program has scheduled fishing 
trips for disabled children Jan. 27 and March 17 at the Santa Ana River Lakes 
in Anaheim from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. Volunteers are needed to help teach the 
children how to fish and to donate equipment for use during the event. For more 
information call (714) 545-2033. 
</P>
<P>
The Salt Water Sportsman magazine's national seminar series, which is coming to 
Long Beach City College Saturday, will sell tickets at the door beginning at 
7:30 a.m. the day of the program. The $25 cost for the event, geared to 
California ocean fishing, includes an 80-page textbook and a chance at winning 
a fishing trip to Costa Rica. 
</P>
<P>
Francisco (Chico) Mendes, the Brazilian labor leader and environmentalist who 
was murdered last December, has been awarded the highest honor of the National 
Wildlife Federation for leading the movement to save Brazil's tropical rain 
forests. Mendes will receive the "Connie" award posthumously in March.

Blake Miraglia hit an 18-foot jump shot with 5 seconds left to lift Cal 
Lutheran to a 90-89 Golden State Athletic Conference victory over Point Loma 
Nazarene in men's basketball Tuesday night, snapping the Kingsmen's 8-game 
losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just a real big win for us," said Steve deLaveaga, who led Cal 
Lutheran with 32 points and 7 rebounds. "I am very relieved." 
</P>
<P>
DeLaveaga's 3-point basket put the Kingsmen ahead, 86-85, with 2:56 left. 
Miraglia, who had 18 points, scored Cal Lutheran's last 4 points to complete a 
42-37 second-half rally for the Kingsmen (7-12, 1-4 in conference play). 
</P>
<P>
Mike Demeter added 14 points for the Kingsmen, who will play 3 road games 
before returning home Feb. 7 to play host to Westmont. 
</P>
<P>
The Crusaders dropped to 5-13, 3-2. RALPH NICHOLS

UCLA LANDS 4TH VALLEY RECRUIT IN HART'S ALLEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brian Allen, a senior tight end at Hart High who led Valley-area players with 
62 receptions last season, has made a verbal commitment to attend UCLA in the 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
Allen, a first-team Times All-Valley selection, whittled his choices from 12 
schools to USC and UCLA before making his decision. 
</P>
<P>
"It was real close," Allen said. "The schools were so similar in every phase. I 
don't really know why I chose UCLA. I just liked it better." 
</P>
<P>
Former Hart teammates Jim Bonds, a quarterback who graduated in 1987, and 
tackle Brian Jacobs, who graduated in 1988, both attend UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't let that influence me," Allen said. "I wanted to do what was best for 
me." 
</P>
<P>
Allen becomes the fourth Valley-area player this season to commit to UCLA. 
Agoura linebacker Carrick O'Quinn, Alemany defensive tackle Brian Swanson and 
Newbury Park quarterback Wayne Cook made earlier commitments to UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Crespi running back Russell White has narrowed his list of schools to Cal, 
Washington and USC. He eliminated Notre Dame when it became apparent the 
defending national champion would not make a scholarship offer until White 
meets eligibility requirements by scoring 700 or better on the Scholastic 
Aptitude Test. White has cancelled a planned visit to Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm kind of disappointed, but that's the way it goes," said White, the state's 
all-time leading rusher and scorer. "But there's no guarantee I would have even 
liked it there. I might not have."

LENDL OUSTS MCENROE WITH PINPOINT BACKHAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
MELBOURNE, Australia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If it were possible on a steamy summer afternoon to freeze one moment in time, 
it would look like this: 
</P>
<P>
Ivan Lendl scorching a backhand cross-court winner just out of John McEnroe's 
reach in the far corner, inches inside the baseline. 
</P>
<P>
In a chillingly efficient display of power tennis, Lendl pounded one backhand 
after another at his oldest and once most formidable opponent, who could only 
shake his head in bewilderment. 
</P>
<P>
"It was unbelievable," McEnroe said. 
</P>
<P>
With the temperature reaching 138 degrees on the floor at center court, Lendl 
defeated McEnroe, 7-6, 6-2, 7-6, Wednesday to advance to the Australian Open 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl will play Thomas Muster, who won his quarterfinal match when Stefan 
Edberg had to default because of a back injury. 
</P>
<P>
After defeating McEnroe for the 15th time in 29 meetings, Lendl joked that his 
backhand wasn't really that effective. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I missed one," he said. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe, who lost only two service games even though he was defeated in 
straight sets, simply could not overcome Lendl's amazingly accurate 
groundstrokes. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl had 25 backhand winners, many of them passing shots, all of them hit with 
devastating power. McEnroe, who had 2 backhand winners, threw up his hands 
after Lendl finally sent a backhand passing shot wide in the third set. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept waiting for him to miss, but he just kept hitting winners," said 
McEnroe. "It was surprising. Nine out of 10 guys would make (only) half those 
shots." 
</P>
<P>
Lendl, who thought McEnroe was affected by the heat, said the match may have 
been decided in the first-set tiebreaker, which he won, 7-0, each point coming 
on a winner. 
</P>
<P>
1-0 Lendl -- backhand cross-court winner. 
</P>
<P>
2-0 Lendl -- backhand cross-court winner. 
</P>
<P>
3-0 Lendl -- backhand winner. 
</P>
<P>
4-0 Lendl -- service winner. 
</P>
<P>
5-0 Lendl -- backhand winner down the line. 
</P>
<P>
6-0 Lendl -- forehand cross-court winner. 
</P>
<P>
7-0 Lendl -- backhand volley winner. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl put the first set in his pocket along with the sawdust he carries to keep 
his grip dry. Then, when Lendl broke McEnroe in the first game of the second 
set, the outcome seemed inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a 2-set swing, potentially," McEnroe said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Lendl: "I got hot for about 10 minutes and that won me 2 sets." 
</P>
<P>
Lendl said he noticed McEnroe moving a step slower to the net at that stage, 
which made the passing shots even more effective. 
</P>
<P>
"When he is outplaying you and he gets you in a tiebreaker, then you come out 
and hit 7 cold winners, that doesn't (make McEnroe) feel too good, no," Lendl 
said. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe didn't even have a break-point opportunity in the match. Lendl held 2 
break points with McEnroe serving, 15-40, 5-5 in the third set, but McEnroe 
forced deuce on successive volleys and held on a service winner and an angled 
backhand volley. 
</P>
<P>
But because he could put no pressure on Lendl's serve, there was little chance 
for him. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt I played well, but I wasn't at that great level," McEnroe said. "I did 
the best I could, it just wasn't good enough today. There'll be other days." 
</P>
<P>
Lendl held serve to force a third-set tiebreaker, which was 2-2 on McEnroe's 
serve when Lendl signaled the beginning of the end. 
</P>
<P>
A cross-court forehand winner was followed by a backhand cross-court winner and 
a 4-2 lead. McEnroe dumped Lendl's second serve into the net and hit a volley 
out to set up match point at 6-2. Lendl ended it with a forehand winner. 
</P>
<P>
What else? 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, there was a winner who got a good break because of a bad 
back. 
</P>
<P>
Muster got to the semifinals without hitting a ball. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg was thinking about luck, too, or about not having any. "It's just a 
very, very, very unlucky thing to happen," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The two-time Australian Open champion, who injured his back only 2 points from 
closing out Pat Cash in Tuesday's match, was forced to withdraw from the 
tournament Wednesday morning when his back did not improve. 
</P>
<P>
Muster, who would have played Edberg in the quarterfinals, was told of Edberg's 
decision just after he walked off the practice court. Edberg said there was 
nothing he could do. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so stiff, I can't really move," Edberg said. "I can't even put my socks 
on." 
</P>
<P>
Edberg's back was X-rayed Wednesday morning and the tests were negative, 
although he said he is not sure what the problem may be. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it's strained ligaments, but it could be muscle spasms," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg, who described the sensation at the moment of his injury as "a knife in 
my back," said he will take at least 2 weeks off, possibly longer. He said he 
does not want to take any risks with his career. 
</P>
<P>
Muster, a 21-year-old Austrian, said he felt a little sorry for Edberg . . . 
but not too much. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel bad about it," Muster said. "I can't feel sorry I'm in the 
semifinals." 
</P>
<P>
Jan Gunnarsson, who will play Miloslav Mecir next, is quite happy to be in the 
semifinals. He just can't believe it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very surprised," Gunnarsson said. "It's like a dream. I don't know yet 
what I have done." 
</P>
<P>
Gunnarsson, 26, ranked No. 85 in the world, defeated fellow Swede Jonas 
Svensson, 6-0, 6-3, 4-6, 6-4. After giving Svensson an opening in the third 
set, Gunnarsson broke him in the first game of the fourth set and held serve 
the rest of the way to win. 
</P>
<P>
Mecir had little trouble defeating 17-year-old Goran Ivanisevic of Yugoslavia, 
7-6, 6-0, 6-3.

COLD SPELL FAILS TO STOP CRESPI, 51-31; 
</P>
<P>
CELTICS SURVIVE 11-MINUTE FIELD-GOAL DROUGHT IN VICTORY OVER ST. JOHN BOSCO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
If the St. John Bosco High student cheering section likes to refer to itself as 
"The Pit," then the Braves' boys' basketball players were the pits Tuesday 
night against Crespi. 
</P>
<P>
The Celts, playing down to the Braves for three quarters, pulled away in the 
final period to record a 51-31 Del Rey League victory at Crespi. 
</P>
<P>
"It was pretty ugly for three quarters -- very ugly," Crespi Coach Paul Muff 
said. "But a win is a win. We'll take it." 
</P>
<P>
This was a game in which baskets came about as often as leap year. St. John 
Bosco shot air balls (from the field and the free-throw line), backboard balls, 
and even threw up a "beam ball" -- Marco Castaneda's desperation shot at the 
end of the half that hit a ceiling beam. 
</P>
<P>
The Braves (3-11, 1-4), whose only Del Rey win this season came against Crespi 
(9-9, 4-2), went the entire first period without a field goal and trailed the 
Celts, 14-4, after a quarter. St. John Bosco drew within 19-14 at halftime 
after Crespi went 0 for 13 from the field in the second period. 
</P>
<P>
The Celts' cold streak spilled over into the third quarter before Pat Brady hit 
a jump shot 2:45 into the period, ending an 11-minute field-goal drought. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't hit anything in the first half," Crespi guard Chris McGee said. 
"They've only won one game (in league), but against us, they play tough." 
</P>
<P>
Crespi shot 26% in the first half, St. John Bosco 29%. The Celts were 29% for 
the game, making just 12 baskets. The Braves finished at 29%, making 10 shots. 
</P>
<P>
McGee was 0 for 7 before making a 3-point basket 1:35 into the fourth period 
that gave Crespi a 28-25 lead. He hit another 3-point field goal minutes later 
to put the Celts ahead, 33-27. 
</P>
<P>
"Chris' 3-pointers were real key for us," Muff said. "We've been really going 
dry at the end of the second quarter and start of the third this year. We start 
missing and it mushrooms. Guys start doubting themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Crespi converted 16 of 17 free throws in the final 2:48 to account for the 
lopsided final score. McGee was 8 of 8 from the line in the period, and reserve 
forward Scott Martin was 4 of 4. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Lynch, the only Celt to shoot better than 50% from the field (5 of 8), 
finished with 13 points and 7 rebounds. McGee led Crespi with 14 points -- all 
in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Brady, who fouled out with 7 minutes to play, and Matt Luderer each scored 8 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Metoyer and Radizwell Gangalang each had 8 points for St. John Bosco.

DAVE DISTEL: DESPITE LOST SEASON, BET ON LYNCH TO JUSTIFY THE HYPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dave Distel 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A sheet of paper labeled "MEDIA ALERT" gets attention anywhere in a news room, 
and one came in this week hailing a press conference for a North County 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
Since about the only events that will really put the media on alert are 
coaches' hirings (or firings), trades and Michael Fay slinging mud at the San 
Diego Yacht Club, I knew immediately who had to be involved. 
</P>
<P>
It had to be Dan Fouts, currently the starting quarterback for Rancho Santa Fe 
Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
Was Fouts going to make a comeback? Or maybe switch networks from CBS to NBC? 
</P>
<P>
Aha! The news release was prepared for . . . no, not NBC . . . NBG. Who? You 
know, the Noble Broadcast Group. This is the radio network that brings you 91X, 
690 XTRA and Lee (Hack Facts) Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
However, further examination of the release, which was prepared by a rather 
prominent public relations firm, told me that the hullabaloo was to announce 
that a high school quarterback was about to announce where he would attend 
college. 
</P>
<P>
Frankly, I was no less "alert" than previously, since I had never heard of a 
public relations firm issuing a news release to awaken the media to a press 
conference involving a high school athlete and his choice of colleges. Football 
coaches usually handle this chore with about three telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
Having gotten this far, I was still a bit baffled. The leading quarterback in 
the county was Orange Glen's Cree Morris, and he had already announced his 
intention to go to San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
Did I miss someone? 
</P>
<P>
I missed Torrey Pines High School's John Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
We all did. 
</P>
<P>
It turned out this kid passed for an average of 70 yards a quarter last season. 
Unfortunately for young John, he only played five quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Stupid coach, huh? 
</P>
<P>
Not exactly. Unlucky coach. 
</P>
<P>
And unlucky kid. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch broke his ankle early in the second quarter of the season opener and did 
not return until the last regular-season game. He passed for 143 yards in one 
quarter of the opener, and that was likely a truer measure of what he might 
have done than the 203 yards he put together when he came back for the finale. 
</P>
<P>
"If he hadn't been hurt," said Rik Haines, Torrey Pines coach, "that kid would 
have broken every conceivable record . . . maybe even the state record for 
total offense." 
</P>
<P>
And Torrey Pines might have been a whole lot better than 4-5-1, particularly 
since its offense was designed for Lynch, who passed for 1,292 yards out of an 
option offense his junior year. 
</P>
<P>
"We might have lost a game," Haines said, "but I think it would have been us 
and Orange Glen or us and Morse in the (section) finals." 
</P>
<P>
Injuries are part of the game, however, and the only nice thing about this one 
was that it did not lessen Lynch's allure to college recruiters. He was still 
pursued by Washington State, Stanford, USC, Notre Dame and San Diego State, and 
that's not exactly like having to take your 11-year-old sister to the prom. 
</P>
<P>
And so it came down to this press conference, arranged by John Lynch Sr. 
through the public relations firm that handles the account for Noble 
Broadcasting. Lynch Sr. happens to own Noble Broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
With such a buildup, I didn't really know what to expect. Maybe the kid would 
be driven up in a limo with Brooke Shields. Maybe he would guarantee that he 
would lead the college of his choice to the 1989 national championship. Maybe 
he would even dance a little shuffle. I was not really sure. 
</P>
<P>
I found a kid who looked like he was student body president Monday through 
Friday, Mom's helper around the house on Saturday and an altar boy on Sunday. 
Not only did he look like it, he talked like it. 
</P>
<P>
He even has a hero. 
</P>
<P>
"I admire John Elway the most," he said. "He's my hero . . . but I'm starting 
to admire Joe Montana." 
</P>
<P>
It should be no surprise that he wore No. 7 at Torrey Pines, and it should 
probably be no surprise that he chose to continue his education at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
Will he get No. 7? 
</P>
<P>
"Tony Trousset of Vista has No. 7," he said. "If he wants to give it to me, 
fine, but I don't want to make a big scene." 
</P>
<P>
This press conference turned out to be a nice scene, if not a big scene. There 
seemed to be more family, friends, coaches and teammates than media in the 
small amphitheater, but that was fine. This was a nice moment for a nice kid 
whom fate had deprived of a senior season to remember. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe there would be big moments in the fall of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"They've given me a promise to prepare me to compete for a job," he said, "and 
that's all I can ask. If I have the opportunity to start, I have it . . . but 
redshirting wouldn't be the worst thing in the world." 
</P>
<P>
I came away from the press conference feeling good for the young man. I thought 
the buildup was a bit overblown, but you can't blame a father for being 
enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
In a sense, this was a little coming-out party for a youngster we never got to 
know hereabouts. A bad break took care of that. A bad break kept him down to 
346 passing yards his entire senior year. No one really noticed beyond Torrey 
Pines' district boundaries, except opponents who knew he would have been 
passing for that much per game if he had been healthy. 
</P>
<P>
And so John Lynch gets a good break. 
</P>
<P>
Now let me give you a media alert. You'll hear about this kid at Stanford.

Kearny 62, Clairemont 60 -- Kearny (10-9, 2-2) made 10 of 10 free throws in the 
fourth quarter, including Tom Rawlins' pair with 9 seconds left to give the 
Komets a 62-58 lead, in the come-from-behind victory over visiting Clairemont 
(9-12, 1-3). 
</P>
<P>
Kearny's Andre White scored a game-high 24 points, and Danny Johnson scored 12 
of his 13 points in the fourth quarter. But Kearny Coach Bill Peterson said the 
ball-handling of point guard Harvey Hardwick (seven assists in the second half) 
made the difference against Clairemont's full-court press. 
</P>
<P>
"He has only played in 7 or 8 games this year, and he's been bugging me to give 
him a chance," Peterson said. "Finally in the second half, I said, 'Go get 'em 
Harvey.' And he really came through. He'll play a lot more from now on." 
</P>
<P>
Mission Bay 64, USDHS 57 -- Keith Berkley scored 20 points and had 12 rebounds

Take a football player and a long jumper and throw in an opponent that files 
its intensity away at halftime, and you have a tie for first place in the City 
Western League boys' basketball race. 
</P>
<P>
That's about the way it happened Tuesday when host University City (13-6, 3-1) 
came back from a 13-point halftime deficit to clip La Jolla (11-6, 3-1) in 
overtime, 65-58. 
</P>
<P>
The football player is Darnes Taylor. He's big, strong and, by his own 
admission, not at home on the court. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody knows I'm not a basketball player," he said. "So I just go out there 
and try to get everybody fired up." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor missed most of the first half after taking an elbow to the nose. While 
he was being attended to in the locker room, University City was foundering on 
the court. Taylor came back in the second half and scored all eight of his 
points, giving his team the leadership it needed and providing the means for La 
Jolla to fall flat on its first league loss. 
</P>
<P>
But the day truly belonged to the long jumper, Jerome Price, who stands at 
6-feet 1-inch but plays as if he's 6-7 or 6-8 because of tremendous vertical 
leap. 
</P>
<P>
Price missed Friday's game against USDHS to participate in the Sunkist 
Invitational Track meet in Los Angeles. He won the high school division with a 
long jump of 23-6. University City lost to USDHS, 70-60. 
</P>
<P>
A reporter at the meet told Price the bad news. 
</P>
<P>
"(He) told me that we lost, and I was mad," Price said. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, he made up for it. With University City trailing by nine, Price hit 
two consecutive jump shots in the third quarter to help his team inch closer. 
Minutes later, he hit a 15-footer from the left side to cut it to 42-40, La 
Jolla. He then scored seven points in the fourth quarter to send the game into 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
In overtime, University City took charge and won easily. Price scored five of 
University City's nine overtime points and finished as the game's leading 
scorer with 28. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a whole different world when he's in there," University City Coach Tom 
Medigovich said. 
</P>
<P>
Medigovich thought about that last week when he considered dropping Price from 
the team for missing the basketball game. 
</P>
<P>
"I was not too thrilled at all," Medigovich said. "I made the decision that if 
I kicked him off the team, I was going to do the team harm." 
</P>
<P>
La Jolla Coach Rick Eveleth questioned his team's ability to concentrate after 
taking a lead. Twice while ahead in the final minutes of the game, La Jolla 
missed the front end of a 1-and-1 to give University City its opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was totally a mental letdown," Eveleth said. "We've done it two or 
three games in a row and today it came back to haunt us." DON PATTERSONValley's 
Debbie Duhaney and Sarah Mease scored 18 points apiece. Mt. Miguel improved to 
4-14, 2-4. El Cajon Valley dropped to 7-9, 2-3. City Western League Mission Bay 
44, USDHS 43 -- For USDHS, Amy Seidlinger hit back-to-back 3-pointers to pull 
the Dons' to within one, but Mission Bay (12-7, 4-0) held on for the victory 
and overtook USDHS (9-5, 3-1) for first in the league. Cristina Willis, the 
county's fifth-leading scorer, had a game-high 26 points for Mission Bay. 
University outscored Mission Bay, 18-4, in the fourth quarter. Nonleague 
Santana 63, Monte Vista 35 -- Stephanie Thompson scored a game-high 24 points 
to lead Santana (15-2, 4-0). Rebecca Aase, Tammy Vates and Kim Olson added 10 
apiece.

SAN DIEGO PUTS HURT ON CRAWFORD

<P>
Before Tuesday's boys' basketball game against Crawford High, San Diego Coach 
Dennis Kane assessed his team's injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Junior forward Clark James (6-feet 4-inches) is scheduled for a root canal this 
morning, compliments of an elbow that knocked his front tooth loose Friday in 
San Diego's game against St. Augustine. 
</P>
<P>
Junior forward Raynard Wells (6-3) is recovering from the flu. 
</P>
<P>
Senior center Milton Miller (6-6) has a sore foot. 
</P>
<P>
Against Crawford, James responded with 22 points, including 14 of 14 free 
throws, and grabbed 11 rebounds. Wells added 21 points and 6 rebounds. Miller 
had 15 points and 4 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
They led San Diego to a 77-59 victory over rival Crawford, giving the Cavers 
(12-3, 3-1) sole possession of second place in the City Central League. Lincoln 
(19-1, 4-0) defeated Christian Tuesday to remain in first. Crawford fell to 
12-6, 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter, Crawford scored the first 6 points and the last 6, and 
with the score 15-8, it looked as if Crawford would run away. The Cavers did 
not score until 4 minutes 38 into the game on a Miller layup from a Jerome 
Young assist. Its next two points were James' free throws after a technical 
foul was called on Crawford Coach John King. 
</P>
<P>
But a check of the first-quarter statistics showed a trend that would continue 
throughout the game and ultimately decide it. Crawford made only 5 of 10 free 
throws, and San Diego hit 6 of 6. For the game, San Diego made 24 of 29 (83%), 
Crawford just 12 of 28 (43%). 
</P>
<P>
In the second quarter, the home team took over. San Diego scored the first 17 
points and outscored the Colts, 22-2, going from a 7-point deficit to a 
13-point lead at the half. While San Diego made 6 field goals, including a 
3-pointer by Wells, and 9 of 12 free throws, Crawford managed only 2 free 
throws by Chris Johnson (23 points, 9 rebounds). 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly didn't do anything to resemble an offense in the second quarter," 
King said. "But I didn't think we were out of the game by any means." 
</P>
<P>
The third quarter was basically even (20-18, San Diego) and the Cavers led, 
50-35. But in the fourth quarter, Crawford got hot (making a 13-4 run), things 
got tight and tensions erupted into a scuffle between San Diego's J.R. Greer 
and Crawford's Marc Carter. 
</P>
<P>
Greer and Carter were given technicals and ejected for fighting, and both 
coaches were given technicals because their players left the bench. 
</P>
<P>
After Johnson made 3 of 4 technical shots, Crawford trailed, 54-48. But James, 
who had made his first 10 free throws in the first half, made all 4. San Diego 
then outscored Crawford, 19-11, during the final 4:17.

H.F. Ahmanson &amp; Co., parent of Home Savings of America and Bowery Savings

the year. The Los Angeles-based holding company earned $67.6 million in the 
quarter and $202 million for all of 1988. Chairman and Chief Executive Richard 
H. Diehl attributed the quarterly gain to higher interest income and record 
mortgage loan volume. He said the decline in annual earnings was largely 
because of a 76% reduction in after-tax gains on sales of loans and 
mortgage-backed securities.

ALICE KAHN: WHAT LIVING IN THE HILLS WILL DO TO YOU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Alice Kahn 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I hate to sound like Rosanne Rosanna-Dana or even Gilda Radner. But you know, 
it's always something. 
</P>
<P>
Can we kvetch? Kvetch (ka-'vech): verb intransitive. I kvetch; you kvetch; he, 
she and it just take it. 
</P>
<P>
My car broke down yesterday while I was rushing out to do a few errands. I was 
also suffering from a cold or Shapiro's syndrome or whatever it is that's going 
around. I had with me in the car a copy of a bad novel I started to write in 
1979 and six specimen bottles. 
</P>
<P>
My doctor wanted me to get tested to see if I had picked up an intestinal 
parasite like giardia when I went to Mexico last spring. But I suppose there 
was a bright side to getting stuck out in the world with a lousy novel and six 
specimen bottles: The bottles were empty. 
</P>
<P>
I had been kind of depressed for a week. It was partly due to Shapiro's 
syndrome, the disease that causes columnists to run off at the nose instead of 
the mouth. And it was partly due to my own version of SAD, Seasonal Affective 
Disorder. I had been reading about SAD and how some people were able to cure 
their depression and carbohydrate cravings with stronger light bulbs. I tried 
it, but what happened was that I ate a loaf of bread while I was under the sun 
lamp. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe what was really getting me down was staying indoors and not exercising. 
All that coughing and sneezing from my Shapiro's, you know. Did I tell you it 
was my own fault that I got sick? 
</P>
<P>
Yes, on Saturday night I bragged that I hadn't had a cold all year. Even though 
I knocked wood as I said it -- solid oak -- the Evil Eye still got me. Within 
an hour of committing hubris, my throat tightened up, my sinuses started aching 
and I got that hideous itching down in my ears in the place where Q-tips go to 
die. 
</P>
<P>
On the fritz myself, I stumbled into my gourmet car repair shop, where you get 
a free cappuccino along with an oil change and lube. The garage is pretty far 
from my home now that I live in the hills. In fact, the mechanic pointed out 
that my new home was the reason my brakes had ground to a halt. "That's what 
you get for living in the hills," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe that was my problem. When you move from the flatlands to the hills, 
everyone likes to blame all your troubles on where you live. Your car breaks 
down. That's what you get for living in the hills. You get a cold because the 
Evil Eye sees you brag that you haven't had a cold. That's what you get for 
living in the hills. You pick up a little giardia in Mexico. That's what you 
get for living in the hills. 
</P>
<P>
A nice woman from the garage gave me a lift part of the way home. We got to 
talk about her giardia and her adventures in specimen collection. She dropped 
me off before we could discuss her unpublished novel. 
</P>
<P>
Now my problem was I had to walk. This led me to cross a street I normally 
would be driving by. I said "Hi" to a strange woman who was crossing in the 
opposite direction. I'm still enough of a hippie that I say "Hi" to strangers 
(although around 1980 I dropped the "Have a nice day"). 
</P>
<P>
The woman suddenly realized I was her former high school teacher and began 
praising me profusely, saying what a difference I had made in her life. "I want 
you to know I've never forgotten you." 
</P>
<P>
I mumbled a few polite words and then started walking the remaining two miles 
uphill. 
</P>
<P>
Now I really had a problem. Someone had actually said the words I've always 
wanted to hear. I'll have to live with that for the rest of my life. You have 
no idea how difficult this is. 
</P>
<P>
I tell you, if it's not one thing, it's another.

MARYLOUISE OATES: 'PHANTOM' LINING UP BIG-TICKET PARTYGOERS 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"If someone pays $1,000, we really want them to have a great time." 
</P>
<P>
And, indeed, people are lining up to pay $1,000 for a ticket to "Phantom of the 
Opera," which opens at the Ahmanson this spring. The money, however, goes not 
to scalpers but to the Center Theatre Group, which holds its benefit at the May 
20 preview performance. 
</P>
<P>
Benefit chairs Nancy Vreeland and Terri Childs have sold more than 500 of the 
Gala Patron and Gala Sponsor tickets (priced at $1,000 and $500) and that's 
without an invitation even going into the mail. (For those not so flush but 
fervent to see "Phantom," CTG is also selling $250 and $100 tickets to the 
benefit. These do not include the post-performance gala, but they do include 
the pre-performance "lavish" champagne reception.) 
</P>
<P>
The length of the CTG committee list, Childs said, happened because "everyone 
wanted to be included -- and everyone is working." There are three vice chairs 
-- Robin Parsky, Jane Weintraub (her husband, Jerry, has just joined the CTG 
board) and Debbie Tellefsen. Among those names crowding down the side of the 
benefit stationery: Blue Ribbon president Joanne Kozberg; Terry Stanfill; Mary 
Jane Wick; Lilly Tartikoff; Rosemary Tomich; Barbara Marshall; Giney Milner and 
her daughter-in-law, Mary; Sandy Ausman; Peggy Parker; Beth Pressman and Lynda 
Palevsky (who is doing the invitation, but nobody is sure if an invitation is 
now necessary). 
</P>
<P>
With corporate sponsorship, the benefit could net more than $500,000, 
organizers said. And they're hopeful that even those in the cheap seats will be 
done up in black tie or at least something truly festive. 
</P>
<P>
As far as the post-performance gala is concerned, Vreeland said she is 
"thrilled" that Chasen's will be doing the supper -- "I've long wanted to bring 
them downtown." 
</P>
<P>
And, as far as the decor, it will be "Paris opera of the era," Childs said. One 
idea is that the centerpieces will be Phantom-style masks. 
</P>
<P>
As an added moneymaker, artists and designers Bob Graham, Ken Lane, Nolan 
Miller and Frank Gehry are all designing masks to be auctioned at the party. 
</P>
<P>
Just how desperate is everyone to see "Phantom"? Well, there is the story of 
the man who left a signed blank check with the receptionist for CTG development 
director Mary K Bailey with a message that he was a friend of a CTG board 
member and a note that he was interested in tickets and could she call him with 
details. 
</P>
<P>
BENEFIT BONANZA -- This is a wonderful idea for a fund-raiser: Have celebrities 
like Candice Bergen and her director husband, Louis Malle; Gene Kelly; Joan 
Collins; Shirley MacLaine; George Burns and others take Polaroid pictures of 
what "home" means to each of them (like George's hand holding his cigar). Then 
auction them off for the Spare Change Project of the Family Assistance Program 
of Hollywood. It will all take place at Spago Tuesday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Center for Early Education celebrates its 50th anniversary this year -- and 
it's taking the shape of a major birthday party at the Biltmore Hotel March 11. 
Center parent Lorna Luft headlines the evening. There will be a silent auction, 
and the whole time is seen as a "special opportunity for three generations of 
CEE parents and alumni to celebrate together," according to Susan Franklin, 
president of the Board of Trustees of the West Hollywood-based private school. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
Mark your calendars -- the 13th annual Coro Public Affairs Awards Dinner is set 
for April 27 at the Century Plaza Hotel. Honored this year will be KCBS-TV's 
Bill Stout and Westminster Neighborhood Assn. President E. Grace Payne. 
</P>
<P>
JOURNALISTS ON THE MOVE -- Richard Turner, for several years bureau chief of TV 
Guide here, moves over to the Wall Street Journal in mid-February. There, 
Turner will cover the TV, record and film industries from the West Coast. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Ciji Ware has been telling Los Angeles where it's at healthwise and 
life-style-wise for many years, on TV, in print and on KABC. And, in 1982, she 
published the nonfiction book, "Sharing Parenthood After Divorce." Next month, 
Ware debuts as a novelist, when Bantam prints her "Island of the Swans," a 
historical novel set in 18th-Century Scotland.

SOCIETY: POST-OPERA PLOT TAKES ON A LIGHTER TWIST

It's just as well that life rarely chooses to imitate art. Mayhem, madness, 
murder -- these are just part of a day's work in grand opera, and who knows 
what might have happened had the committee behind Saturday's Season Opening 
Night Celebration for the San Diego Opera had taken the point of view that a 
gala should borrow its mood from the stage. 
</P>
<P>
The season opened with "Lucia di Lammermoor," famed not only for the hottest 
mad scene in all opera, but for a general flow of misery that by evening's end 
makes some viewers wish they'd brought an extra handkerchief. The story line 
makes it something of a "Romeo and Juliet" set in the Scottish Highlands, with 
a few nice twists, such as when Lucia goes bonkers in Act III. The scene is 
riveting. 
</P>
<P>
The scenario sketched out for the benefit gala followed a decidedly more 
cheerful plot. At the beginning of the evening, event chairman Lee Goldberg 
reacted with amusement when a guest asked if the tone of "Lucia" had influenced 
the planned entertainments. 
</P>
<P>
"No!" she said. "No, no. We're going to have nothing but fun and happiness! 
Everyone will dance at least until one. This is a party!" 
</P>
<P>
It was, as things developed, a party with more than a few plot twists of its 
own. The third in a series of major annual fund-raisers, the opening night 
celebration is a night on the town unique among San Diego big deals -- it is a 
genuine all-night affair, at which the guests bounce around a dance floor at 
the Westgate Hotel until 2 a.m. or so, and then stay on for a gala-concluding 
brunch the following morning. It is known as the fanciest slumber party in 
town, and at least at present seems in no danger of losing that reputation. 
</P>
<P>
The gala started with a late-afternoon reception in the Westgate lobby, at 
which guests were encouraged to stoke up on lobster bisque, pate and other 
noshes, since supper would not be served until after the performance. The mood 
took a momentarily formal turn when opera director Ian Campbell marched a squad 
of guests to the landing on the grand staircase, from which elevated spot the 
group was introduced as members of a newly founded support group called the 
Bravissimo Medal Patrons. Members pledge donations of up to $100,000, and among 
those medalists attending were arts patron Muriel Gluck; San Diego Museum of 
Art president Joseph Hibben and his wife, Ingrid; Judson and Rachel Grosvenor; 
Mary Louise and Charles Robins; Frank and Lee Goldberg; Marianne McDonald, and 
opera president Esther Burnham. 
</P>
<P>
When a guest cheerfully suggested to Burnham that there seemed "something 
illicit" to spending a night in a hotel in one's own city, she responded that 
she thought it rather nice to be able to "take the elevator home" after a night 
of partying. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We All Are Escaping' 
</P>
<P>
"An overnight is just a wonderful way for all of us to sneak away from our 
troubles at home," she said. "Here we all are escaping. What better way to 
spend a weekend?" 
</P>
<P>
A total of 259 guests shared Burnham's point of view. The figure stood in some 
danger of being upped to 260; Ann Campbell, the wife of the director, said that 
her second child was expected momentarily and suggested that no one be 
surprised were she to leave rather suddenly. There would have been a name to 
add to the guest list, since the Campbells, with the knowledge that they were 
expecting a boy, long ago chose David Lawrence as his name. (In keeping with 
the times, they spent the morning at what Ann Campbell called "sibling rivalry 
class" with their 20-month old son, Benjamin Colin.) 
</P>
<P>
In deference to the opera's setting in Scotland, Goldberg engaged a band of 
kilted Scots to pipe the guests over to the Civic Theatre. Nature lent a hand 
to make the moment perfect; as the opera-goers marched into Civic Plaza, they 
were halted by the sight of a great, silvery full moon -- a mad, loony moon for 
"Lucia" -- that hung between the double row of skyscrapers on B Street. It was 
a prop that the set designer doubtless would have loved to take inside, and 
Junko Cushman took one look at it and predicted "Something crazy will happen 
tonight!" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Back to Hotel 
</P>
<P>
Pocket handkerchiefs soaked and mascara running, the guests headed back to the 
Westgate after the tearful conclusion of Act III of "Lucia" and settled in for 
for Act III of the opening-night celebration. The committee had commandeered 
both the Versailles and Fontainebleau rooms, had decked them out in brilliant 
floral arrangements that captured the purples and lavenders of the Scottish 
heath and had even slung tartan sashes over the shoulders of the waiters. 
</P>
<P>
The Bill Green Orchestra started the dance music immediately, but given the 
late hour, most guests headed directly to dinner. Designed with a Highlands 
theme by Jeanne Jones, it commenced with Scottish salmon, continued with roast 
quail (which was nothing to grouse about) and finished up with a poached, 
minted pear, although under the circumstances, a nuttier dessert might have 
been in order. The dinner concluded, the dancing began in earnest and continued 
far later than at the great majority of San Diego fund-raisers. 
</P>
<P>
Several committee members prided themselves on their success in competing for 
guests with the other major events of the weekend, the balls given in honor of 
the inauguration of President George Bush, which drew a number of regular opera 
patrons to Washington. Among those who opted to head to the nation's capital 
was Dorene Whitney, who founded the opera's opening night celebration in 1986 
and also chaired the 1987 version. 
</P>
<P>
The gala did, on the other hand, draw a roster of very special guests, the 
principal singers from "Lucia di Lammermoor," who entered the dining rooms to 
choruses of bravo and sustained applause. This group included title soprano 
Gail Dobish and her character's star-crossed lover, tenor Richard Leech, who 
sang the role of Edgardo.

THE ALLEGIANCE TO THE MIDDLE CLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN KIRSCH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Good Life: The Meaning of Success for the American Middle Class by Loren 
Baritz (Alfred A. Knopf: $19.95, 346 pages) 
</P>
<P>
Late in the Depression, social historian Loren Baritz reports in "The Good 
Life: The Meaning of Success for the American Middle Class," about 88% of the 
respondents in a Gallup poll claimed to belong to the middle class, even though 
half of them reported income either higher or lower than middle class. The 
American dream, in other words, is literally a middle-class dream. 
</P>
<P>
Baritz has thought deeply about what "the good life" means to the American 
middle class, and his book is a careful, even meticulous explanation of its 
psychological, cultural and even sexual underpinnings throughout our history. 
The yearning for a new car, a home in the suburbs, a college education for the 
children -- the badges of the middle class, now and forever -- are only the 
most superficial expressions of a philosophy that reflects the enduring values 
of the American people. 
</P>
<P>
"The middle class was buried . . . in its immediate affairs and present 
desires, made itself its standard of value and conduct, partly immunized 
against art and literature, and created a class astigmatism that blurred the 
continuity of life, while obscuring pleasure and solace once available," Baritz 
explains. "It was truly on its own, just where it wanted to be." 
</P>
<P>
Baritz surveys the irresistible thrust of the middle class throughout American 
history and proves -- if anyone still needs proof -- that the genius of America 
is its ability to channel all classes and all kinds into a single current of 
polite middle-class aspiration. 
</P>
<P>
Baritz, a history professor at the Amherst campus of the University of 
Massachusetts, is a scholar with a sharp eye for the telling details of 
American life as reflected (or, perhaps more accurately, as shaped) by the mass 
media, the popular culture, and artificial folkways of fad and fashion. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, for example, Baritz points out that the broad, padded shoulders of men's 
suits during the Depression were "apparently designed to emphasize a male's 
manliness and power at a time when he needed all the help he could get." After 
World War II, when Rosie the Riveter was sent home from the factory, the 
"mothering" role of the middle-class woman was expressed in a new emphasis on 
the bosom: 
</P>
<P>
"Bras were reinforced with strong wire and girdles made sufficiently tight to 
decrease the waist, thereby emphasizing the breasts and hips," he observes. "A 
newly engineered mammillary culture now emerged and swept over the resentfully 
pliant middle-class woman. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, what I found most intriguing about "The Good Life" is the author's 
facility at tracing the linkages between various phenomena of American life. 
Thus, for example, he shows us the common values that help to explain the tract 
homes of suburbia, the ravages of McCarthyism and the emerging religion of pop 
psychology: 
</P>
<P>
"Almost immediately suburbia's informality hardened into a rigid 
conventionality established by the need for like-minded neighbors to like each 
other," he writes. "The compulsion to adjust to community norms filled 
family-room bookcases with self-help, junk psychology, and mindless educational 
literature, all focus on the joys of belonging. . . . Sen. McCarthy exploited 
this desire to become indistinguishable from others." 
</P>
<P>
I detected a subtle change in tone as Baritz confronts the latter days of the 
American middle class -- the so-called Baby Boom, the upheavals of the 1960s, 
and the anguish and anxiety of the 1980s, as we yearn for "a kinder and gentler 
America" amid the physical, psychological and social violence of our times. 
Suddenly, the scholarly detachment of his prose gives way to a more passionate, 
a more judgmental attitude toward his subject. Significantly, Baritz -- a man 
in his 60s -- presents the '80s as an intimate conflict between middle-class 
parents and children who have disappointed each other. 
</P>
<P>
At the very end of "The Good Life," Baritz turns to poetry, perhaps the most 
antique and rarefied of social indicators, to express his own insights and, 
poignantly, his own pain and frustration. The last few words of "The Good Life" 
are not the words of the scholar or the social scientist -- they are, instead, 
the words of a man's heart and soul: 
</P>
<P>
"The fathers knew there was risk and pain in love and life," Baritz concludes. 
"Fleeing this human adventure, the children calculated their progress toward a 
better life -- the contemplation of all that success may produce, life as work, 
the happiness produced by objects, the envy of strangers, and the freedom to 
float above the struggles of others, in warmth and comfort, alone."

A favorite pastime nowadays is speculating on whether the Big Three in TV -- 
NBC, CBS and ABC -- will be extinct by the year 2000, the victims of new 
competition, affiliate preemptions and maybe their own shows. Millions of words 
have been written about that possibility. Life magazine's February issue, a 
special edition titled "The Future and You," takes its turn. After giving great 
thought to the matter, the magazine, in a page headlined "Say Goodby To . . ." 
comes to a one-paragraph conclusion that indicates goodbys can be iffy, even 
for futurists. Says Life, which shares a parent company with pay-TV giant Home 
Box Office: "Competition from cable and entertainment systems catering to 
highly individual tastes may deliver a TKO to television's Big Three." ALEENE

Pianist Van Cliburn will play his first major concert in more than a decade 
when he performs June 19 with the Philadelphia Orchestra. With the appearance, 
Cliburn, 54, will resume an active concert schedule that has been on hold since 
he quietly took a sabbatical in 1978 after two decades of performing. Conductor 
Stanislaw Skrowaczewski, who will conduct his Philadelphia concert, said, "I'm 
very happy that Van is coming back to his career. Everyone has been very sorry 
that he wasn't playing." Cliburn did accept an invitation to play at the White 
House last year during the visit of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. ALEENE

SOPRANO FAITH ESHAM IN LOCAL RECITAL DEBUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, Times Music Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By the time she ended her generous debut recital Monday night in Ambassador 
Auditorium, Faith Esham was beginning to sound like the genuine operatic 
personality she is. 
</P>
<P>
But earlier, the singer from Kentucky, who has stage credits not only at both 
companies of Lincoln Center but from important European centers as well, took a 
long while to warm up. In the meantime, she may have mystified some of her 
listeners. 
</P>
<P>
Esham's soprano is an instrument of weight and flexibility, attractive sound if 
not abundant coloration. Her beginnings as a mezzo may account for the richness 
in the first octave, yet the freedom and beauty of her top notes are clearly 
native to the voice, not add-ons. 
</P>
<P>
Still, and despite the fact that Esham is a veteran operatic performer -- her 
appearance in the Gold Medal series was connected to her winning the Naumburg 
Competition in 1985 -- she is not an easily classifiable singer. Her ease at 
singing Gilda in New York City Opera's "Rigoletto" in Orange County last week 
does not necessarily limit her to a few roles. 
</P>
<P>
Esham's recital, at which she was splendidly and sensitively assisted by 
pianist Armen Guzelimian -- substituting on short notice for a sick colleague 
-- indicated and underlined her clear versatility. 
</P>
<P>
What was best came last. An expansive performer, Esham closed her program 
proper with four heroic Rachmaninoff songs, delivered with a full, lush tone 
and generosity of spirit. 
</P>
<P>
Before that, she gave properly intimate, finely delineated performances of 
Poulenc's late cycle, "La courte paille," a great work of deceptive simplicity. 
A group of Wolf lieder offered outward charms, if no deep insights. But Esham's 
well-projected response to the directness of four songs by Aaron Copland 
resulted in excitement on both sides of the proscenium. 
</P>
<P>
More muffled in sound and less connected in legato passages, Esham began the 
program with Mozart's scena and aria, "Misera! dove son," and a group of five 
Schubert lieder that she had arranged into a faux cycle. The songs survived, 
but didn't need the help. 
</P>
<P>
Two encores were given: "Les chemins de l'amour" by Poulenc and the spiritual, 
"This Li'l Light of Mine."

NBC PUTS THE 'HEAT' TO 'MOONLIGHTING'

After winning the prime-time ratings race for 30 weeks in a row, NBC got an 
unneeded boost from the Super Bowl on Sunday and soared to its best showing in 
three years, A.C. Nielsen figures showed Tuesday. The network's programs had an 
average audience of 18 million homes for the week, compared to about 10.8 
million each for ABC and CBS. 
</P>
<P>
* Even more satisfying for NBC than the strong Super Bowl performance is the 
growth in viewership for "In the Heat of the Night," which was the 13th 
most-watched show of the week and outdrew ABC's "Moonlighting" for the fifth 
consecutive week.

'SPRING AWAKENING' PORTRAYS SEXUAL TERROR OF ADOLESCENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A brief description of the play "Spring Awakening" makes it sound like a teen 
exploitation movie. 
</P>
<P>
"Spring Awakening" examines teen-agers, young teen-agers, as they discover sex. 
The characters masturbate and copulate. They try it with members of the same 
sex and of the opposite sex. 
</P>
<P>
They also experiment with sado-masochism, get pregnant, get expelled from 
school, try to abort, die in the attempt, commit suicide, talk to headless 
ghosts. Not all of their problems are related to sex -- they're also depicted 
as victims of a rigid academic system that will make them slaves and give them 
nervous breakdowns. 
</P>
<P>
But this isn't a previously undiscovered first film of James Dean's -- or Molly 
Ringwald's. It's a century-old play by the German writer Frank Wedekind, and 
director Michael Arabian gives it a lively, imaginative staging at the Odyssey. 
</P>
<P>
Arabian makes the theatrical nature of the event clear from the beginning. 
Before the play begins, the cast goes through warm-up exercises in front of the 
audience. Then they gather in a circle and chant. When they finally break for 
the first scene, the cast members who aren't involved in it remain on stage and 
watch. 
</P>
<P>
Later, in a scene that's a monologue in the text, these extra actors virtually 
serve as a chorus line. They maneuver giant posts (part of a highly mobile set 
by Don Llewelyn and Saeed Hedjazi) in intricately choreographed patterns. This 
is all done to the accompaniment of Nathan Wang's big, brooding score -- which 
outgrows the term incidental music, though technically that's what it is. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the extra-textual trappings are excessive. It's distracting when the 
on-stage onlookers laugh at lines that don't elicit the same response from the 
real audience. And why do the girls in these scenes (but not the boys) wear 
black choir robes? 
</P>
<P>
The length of the production, nearly three hours, is also excessive. Some of 
this is Wedekind's responsibility -- he included two scenes that haven't 
anything to do with the central story. One of these scenes appears to exist 
simply so that homosexuality will be included among the catalogue of sexual 
variations on display, and Wedekind placed this scene at the one point in the 
play -- just before the ending -- where it does the most damage to the momentum 
of the story. 
</P>
<P>
Still, we wouldn't want Arabian to start deleting; this play was censored 
enough, thank you, in its early years. Furthermore, the communal rituals that 
Arabian added do convey a sense of the universality and timelessness of the 
adolescent Angst that we're watching. They take "Spring Awakening" into the 
territory covered by "The Rite of Spring." 
</P>
<P>
Lest the production get carried away by all the artiness, Rick Foster's 
translation -- commissioned for this production -- brings it back into the 
present day, using rough American teen vernacular. And Arabian supplements the 
contemporaneity -- at least for the boys in the story -- by letting them read 
skin magazines, listen to Led Zeppelin on a big portable radio and pass around 
a basketball. 
</P>
<P>
In short, it's a production about 19th-Century Germans and 20th-Century 
Americans at the same time (and therefore an apt choice for inclusion in the 
"Jugendstil Fest: Young Moderns of 1900," of which this production is a part). 
Although Betty Berberian's costumes remain more in the former era than the 
latter, everything else about the play jumps out of the last century and into 
our own. 
</P>
<P>
The cast is generally able. As best friends Melchior and Moritz, Sean Six and 
Jon Mathews connect with each other yet also make it apparent why the boys' 
roads diverged so radically -- one toward death, one toward life. Mathews 
occasionally seems too mature and too mannered, but Lycia Naff is a breath of 
fresh air as the 14-year-old who learns too late of the inadequacy of the stork 
story. 
</P>
<P>
One casting decision breeds some slight confusion: A Masked Man is played by a 
woman (Jillian McWhirter) who, behind her mask, looks too much like the loose 
girl Ilse (Lara Lyon). Generally, though, Lisa Cooperman's masks sharpen the 
play's satirical edge to just the right proportions, and Marianne Schneller's 
lights add a touch of grandeur. 
</P>
<P>
 At 12111 Ohio Ave., Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m., Sundays at 7 p.m., 
Jan. 29 and Feb. 12 matinees at 3 p.m., indefinitely. Tickets: $14.50-$18.50;

JAZZ NOTES : KKGO OPTS FOR MORE CONTEMPORARY SOUND; 'BLACK, BLUE' RE-CREATES 
COTTON CLUB MILIEU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prompted by a 30% drop in his station's ratings, KKGO-FM (105.1), President 
Saul Levine has ordered a change in programming, adding another contemporary 
track to the hourly record rotation in place of what was formerly a traditional 
jazz cut. KKGO, the Los Angeles area's only 24-hour commercial jazz radio 
station, received a 1.0 rating -- the station's lowest in five years -- on the 
recent fall, 1988, Arbitron ratings survey, down from a 1.5 rating for the 
summer of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
An average hour on KKGO consists of three "sweeps" or commercially 
uninterrupted groups of selections. The current format calls for a three or 
four contemporary tracks, then two or three mainstream records, then another 
three to as many as five contemporary cuts. At least two vocals are included in 
a typical hour. 
</P>
<P>
"Through surveys, letters, phone calls, our audience (of 18 to 35-year-olds) is 
saying that they want to keep up with what's happening in music today," Levine 
said, "while our (35 and older) listeners want more mainstream, so we're trying 
to combine the two. Some hours will be 75% contemporary, others 55%. It's going 
to fluctuate, but there will be a more contemporary sound." 
</P>
<P>
Contemporary does not mean "rock-jazz," Levine said. "We have weeded out the 
fusion, as it was known a decade ago, where it had a very strong rock flavor. 
The contemporary we play might be called mainstream if it were recorded on 
acoustic instruments instead of electronic instruments." 
</P>
<P>
Levine predicted KKGO's format will keep changing as jazz continues to evolve. 
"The idea is not to become a dinosaur," he said. "Jazz goes on forever, and I 
am deeply committed to jazz that is melodic and improvisational." 
</P>
<P>
Mainstream die-hards do get their way on KKGO's nightly (Monday-Saturday, 9-10 
p.m.) "Jazz Straight-Ahead," where Chuck Niles or (on Tuesdays) Jim Gosa offers 
swinging, acoustic sounds. But if an hour's not enough, listeners might want to 
tune in noncommerical KLON-FM (88.1), where mainstream is played 24 hours a 
day. 
</P>
<P>
ECHOES OF HARLEM: "Black and Blue," a stage production that re-creates New 
York's black musical revues of the '20s and '30s as seen in rooms like the 
Cotton Club and Connie's Inn, opens Thursday at Manhattan's Minskoff Theater. 
Produced by Claudio Segovia and Hector Orezzoli, the Argentine team that 
presented "Tango Argentina," "Black and Blue" stars singers Ruth Brown, Carrie 
Smith and Linda Hopkins; tap dancers Bunny Briggs and Jimmy Slyde, and jazz 
musicians Sir Roland Hanna, Claude Williams and Grady Tate. 
</P>
<P>
The revue will offer black music written, or made famous by, Duke Ellington, 
Louis Armstrong, Bessie Smith, Ethel Waters and Fats Waller, performed in the 
manner of such black entertainment legends as Waters, Josephine Baker, Alberta 
Hunter, Bill Robinson and the Nicholas brothers. Information: (212) 869-0550. 
</P>
<P>
FROM PARIS TO L.A.: After living in Paris for more than three years, Spanky 
Wilson is back in town. The former Angeleno, known for her powerful singing 
with such eminences of the L.A. jazz scene as Benny Carter and Teddy Edwards, 
makes a brief appearance at Marla's Memory Lane, Friday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, who lived in Southern California from 1968-85, had no plans to move to 
Europe when she traveled there in the summer of 1985 to sing at the Nice Jazz 
Festival with the Woody Herman All-Stars. 
</P>
<P>
"But while I was there, I met the guy that booked the Meridien Hotel in Paris," 
Wilson recalled, "and he hired me for a two-week (engagement), and I was 
extended for two more. Then I met other club owners, I kept getting work, so I 
said, 'Hey, I think I'll stay.' " 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps best known for her 20th Century LP, "Speciality of the House," Wilson 
described the difference between her career in Europe and in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Over here, artists get in line to get a job, instead of people getting in line 
to see the artist," she laughed. "Last December, I had four days off during the 
month. Here, before, if I worked four days a month, I was really with it." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said Parisian audiences are enthusiastic and gracious. "You don't have 
to constantly prove yourself," she said. "With Europeans, jazz is like a 
religion. And since the release of 'Bird,' the audiences keep getting younger." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said she's singing more pure jazz these days. "That's what I always 
wanted to sing, not pop stuff." 
</P>
<P>
CHART TOPPERS: Billboard magazine's top three mainstream jazz LPs this week are 
Diane Schuur's "Talkin' 'Bout You" (GRP), "Bird," sound track to the film (CBS) 
and Charlie Parker's "Bird -- The Original Recordings of Charlie Parker" 
(Verve). The top three contemporary sellers are Al Jarreau's "Heart's Horizon" 
(Reprise), Kenny G's "Silhouette" (Arista) and Lee Ritenour's "Festival" (GRP). 
</P>
<P>
SOLID SOUNDS: "Motion Poet" (Denon CD) finds composer-drummer Peter Erskine 
(Weather Report, Steps Ahead, Aurora) leading small electric groups bolstered 
by horn sections through a broad palette of colors and moods. "Erskoman," with 
its Latin lilt, and "Exit Up Right," with its jubilant reggae-ish jounce, are 
happy, beaming pieces, while "Hero With a Thousand Faces" is edgy and angular. 
Good moments from guitarists John Abercrombie, saxmen Bob Mintzer and Michael 
Brecker and brassman Randy Brecker.

TURNER EXHIBIT AT USC ATELIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE MUCHNIC, Times Art Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's a peculiar art store within an upscale shopping mall. It's a culture 
within a culture. But whatever else an exhibition called "Saigon, California" 
is, the work by Southern California artist Richard Turner and Vietnamese 
refugee Phi Loc is as discordant as conflicts in Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
Turner makes aggressive pastiches of conflicting East/West cultures, and Phi 
Loc shows naive paintings -- scenes of Saigon in glistening lacquers, turned 
out as commercial decor for Vietnamese refugees, as well as expressionistic 
views of human terror. The resulting show, at USC Atelier in the Santa Monica 
Place shopping center (to Feb. 19), is an unsettling collection of questions. 
</P>
<P>
Disruption is apparent everywhere as Turner inserts such American Pop heroes as 
James Dean and Charlie Parker into Saigon settings, places a bust of Caesar on 
a map of Vietnam (spray-painted on an animal hide) and frames paintings in a 
mixture of bamboo and gilded moldings. 
</P>
<P>
Vestiges of classical Western art and architecture mingle uncomfortably with 
kitsch Oriental statuary. And Turner adopts a different style for each artwork: 
dripped white outlines on black cloth for his jazz bar scene called "Charlie 
Parker Plays the Olympic Bar," crude illustration for "James Dean in Saigon." 
</P>
<P>
This stylistic melee lends the display an air of thrift-shop chaos, but the 
castoffs are individual people and whole villages, if not an entire country. 
One longs for a resolution in the art, which seems so conflicted that it's 
difficult to tell whether Turner has willed it this way or simply hasn't 
resolved his feelings on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
If the latter is true, it's understandable. Turner spent his high school years 
in the late '50s in Saigon and saw a shift from French to American domination. 
As a resident of Orange County, he has watched an influx of Vietnamese refugees 
into Westminster, now called Little Saigon. That's where Phi Loc lives, and the 
ambiance of Vietnamese moderne shops served as Turner's model for "Saigon, 
California." 
</P>
<P>
From an art historical point of view, Turner's 15-year involvement with the 
theme of Asian-American interactions is a fascinating addition to a tradition. 
From the Ukiyo-E artists' depictions of foreign barbarians in woodblock prints 
and the influence of Japanese printmakers on French Impressionists to today's 
concern with Pacific Rim cross-fertilization, there has often been a moral 
undertone to the subject of foreign influence. By focusing on a sociopolitical 
catastrophe, Turner brings the theme into the open.

'WEB OF LIFE' PROBES GENETICS, RESPONSIBILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN ZIMMERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Web of Life," a "Smithsonian World" special airing tonight at 8 on Channels 28 
and 15, asks some of the big questions about mankind's fooling around with 
Mother Nature via molecular genetics: 
</P>
<P>
 -- What is man's role as an agent of evolution? 
</P>
<P>
 -- How far can we go in changing our environment, our heredity? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Are we prepared for the responsibility? 
</P>
<P>
And although "Web" -- through interviews with scientists, educators and 
philosophers -- makes a good attempt at explaining these complex ethical 
issues, the show founders on the very complexity it tries to cut through. 
</P>
<P>
Producer-director Sandra Wentworth Bradley relies on too many talking heads to 
make "Web's" points. The interviewees have some very interesting things to say, 
but there is far too much dry, bloodless discussion at the expense of more 
arresting segments -- which becomes all the more evident when the show cuts 
away to focus on the wonders of prenatal testing or on a Texas ranch where 
genetically superior cattle are being cloned. 
</P>
<P>
That caveat aside, "Web" is a valuable show, a worthwhile examination of some 
very thorny concerns. This is a serious show, the kind that lawmakers and 
scientists should be forced to watch. 
</P>
<P>
As "Web" clearly shows, humans have reached a point where we can sculpt our own 
destiny, changing the structure of life itself. The dramatic and rapid strides 
of molecular biologists have opened the door for potential miracles -- or 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
"We now have the ability to, in a week of work, manipulate what took millions 
of generations . . . to create," says Rob Dorit of Harvard Biological 
Laboratories. And, says Everett Mendelsohn, a history of science professor at 
Harvard, "Human beings are seen to move right to the edge of disaster . . . a 
miscalculation could be disastrous. . . . All the wisdom we've had hasn't kept 
us from putting in place the technology to make the disaster." 
</P>
<P>
"Web" challenges scientists -- as well as viewers -- to, as biologist Nina 
Fedoroff puts it, "invent an ethic" for the entire biosphere. As the narrator 
warns us, quoting 19th-Century Suquamish Indian chief Seattle, "Man does not 
weave the web of life; he is merely a strand in it. Whatever he does to the 
web, he does to himself." 
</P>
<P>
For the sake of the web of life, let's hope someone capable rises to the 
challenge.

DOW TOPS LEVEL IT OPENED AT ON DAY OF CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The stock market's comeback carried Wall Street past a major milestone Tuesday, 
as the Dow Jones industrial index closed above where it stood before the 
historic Black Monday collapse and set yet another post-crash high. 
</P>
<P>
As trading ended, the closely watched Dow stood at 2,256.43, a shade higher 
than its opening level of 2,247.39 on Oct. 19, 1987, when the Dow plunged 508 
points. The Dow rose 38.04 points Tuesday, its biggest one-day advance since 
last Oct. 20. 
</P>
<P>
Market analysts say the post-crash recovery is being led by institutional 
investors that are putting money into large blue chip companies, such as IBM. 
The small investors who fled the market after Black Monday, however, appear to 
be staying away from the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow's new post-crash high cheered technical analysts who watch the stock 
market index for clues about where the market is headed. The breaking of the 
Black Monday barrier confirms for some the strength of the market's recovery. 
</P>
<P>
For others on Wall Street, the passing of the Black Monday barrier was little 
more than a historical footnote that contributed only in a small way to the air 
of optimism that seemed to sweep the stock market in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons for the recovery have been unclear to Wall Street professionals, 
and opinions vary widely on how long the rally will continue. Some market 
watchers noted that the rally wasn't likely to strengthen until individual 
investors returned to the market. 
</P>
<P>
Many small investors are still skittish, with the crash of 15 months ago fresh 
in their memories, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Investors Want Proof 
</P>
<P>
One analyst, Eric Miller of Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, said individual 
investors won't return to the market until they are sure the economy is 
healthy. Miller predicted that interest rates would have to decline by 1 1/2 
percentage points to remove inflationary fears and to persuade individuals that 
the economy is in good shape. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a show-me market," said A. Marshall Acuff Jr., a market analyst with 
Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. in New York. "Small investors want proof 
that a recovery is under way." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed the recovery to everything from economic forecasts to Wall 
Street superstition. Michael Metz, an analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co. in New 
York, said some investors were encouraged by remarks made Tuesday by Federal 
Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan. Greenspan told the House Banking 
Committee that he wants to keep a lid on interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan disputed the notion that inflation in the current 4% to 4 1/2% range 
is acceptable to the Fed and said the central bank is aiming for price 
stability. His remarks also helped spark a rally in the bond market. The 
benchmark 30-year Treasury bond gained more than half a point, depressing its 
yield to 8.78% from 8.85%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mystical Explanations 
</P>
<P>
Other news Tuesday also was thought to cheer investors. Market analysts said 
investors were buoyed by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady's comment that 
the Bush Administration might change taxes on dividends in a way that would 
benefit investors. 
</P>
<P>
Other explanations for the market's rally were more mystical. One analyst 
playfully suggested that this is the beginning of the so-called January Effect. 
Wall Street lore has it that if the market gains in January, it will gain for 
the year. "I would say we're having a January Effect right now," said Smith 
Barney's Acuff. 
</P>
<P>
Other analysts suggested that investors might owe the market's rally to 
Sunday's Super Bowl victory by the San Francisco 49ers. That is because yet 
another theory holds that the market rises in years when a team from the 
National Football Conference wins the professional football championship.

"Even if you're from L.A., you have to give some credit to San Francisco," said 
Miller of Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts differed on how high the market's recovery might go. They note that 
the Dow is still far below the all-time high of 2,722.42 that it reached on 
Aug. 25, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Acuff of Smith Barney predicted that the Dow "could surprise most people" and 
hit 2,700 this year if investors who left the market after the crash return. He 
said, however, that "the prevailing sentiment now is still caution." 
</P>
<P>
Other analysts were less optimistic and said certain events could dampen the 
market's rally. Miller, the Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette analyst, said a 
fight over the federal budget in February and the specter of higher interest 
rates or increased taxes could thwart the market's comeback. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cyclical Stocks Rising 
</P>
<P>
Market analysts said certain groups of stocks seemed to be leading the 
comeback. They said investors are putting money into cyclical stocks, the 
shares of companies whose fortunes tend to rise and fall with the business 
cycle. For example, shares in chemical, paper and metal manufacturers have 
gained since the beginning of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Oppenheimer's Metz said cyclical stocks have been selling at prices below their 
true value because of fears about the economy. But now, he said, investors seem 
to be turning to these stocks as worries about inflation and the budget deficit 
have cooled -- at least for now. 
</P>
<P>
Metz said some companies whose shares seem to be leading the rally are Dow 
Chemical Co., International Paper Co., Bethlehem Steel Corp. and Du Pont. He 
said airline stocks have risen, but he said those gains were because of 
takeover speculation. 
</P>
<P>
In Tuesday's trading on the New York Stock Exchange, rising issues outpaced 
declines 1,016 to 466 in heavy trading of 189.6 million shares. The most 
actively traded issue on the NYSE was Los Angeles-based Security Pacific, which 
was up 5/8 to close at 37. 
</P>
<P>
Merck rose 1 1/4 to 61 7/8 after posting an upbeat fourth-quarter earnings 
report. GAF rose 1 1/4 to 50 1/2. The company scheduled a Feb. 22 annual 
meeting at which shareholders will vote on the proposed $53-a-share cash and 
securities buyout led by Samuel J. Heyman, the firm's chairman and chief 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
Among other gainers, IBM rose 1 7/8 to 124 1/4 and General Motors rose 1 1/8 to 
89 1/2. As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000 actively 
traded stocks, the market rose $29.931 billion, or 1.07%, in value. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Foreign Markets Climb 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose 1.86 to 161.99. 
</P>
<P>
Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 4.43 to 333.26; its 500-stock 
composite index was up 3.99 to 288.49. 
</P>
<P>
The NASDAQ composite index rose 2.00 to 391.99; the American Stock Exchange 
market-value index closed at 318.74, up 0.71. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, share prices rose to a record close amid easing fears of inflation 
and higher interest rates because of lower oil prices and a higher yen. 
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei index rose 224.80, or 0.72%, to close at 31,557.68. The previous 
record close -- 31,354.55 -- was set last Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Share prices rallied in late trading on the London Stock Exchange to close at 
the day's best level and to set yet another post-crash record high. The 
Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed up 16.4, or 0.9%, at 
1,941.1.

FBI BROADENS COMMODITIES FRAUD INQUIRY

<P>
The FBI broadened its investigation Tuesday into commodities trading fraud on 
the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange when its agents 
served subpoenas on a wide array of member firms of both exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
Federal investigators refused to comment, but it appeared that as many as 200 
firms in the city's financial district, including virtually every major trading 
house on both exchanges, received federal subpoenas for trading records dating 
back at least to 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at both exchanges confirmed Tuesday that at least some member firms 
had received subpoenas, but they couldn't provide figures on how many had been 
served. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's action was the first time since the government's undercover probe was 
revealed last week that trading houses have been served with subpoenas. Before, 
the government had only served individual traders and the two exchanges 
themselves. The investigation is being led by U.S. Atty. Anton R. Valukas. 
</P>
<P>
One top Chicago attorney whose firm represents commodities companies said the 
subpoenas may signal that the federal probe is expanding beyond individual 
traders to include trading houses as well. 
</P>
<P>
At least some of the subpoenas seemed to be a fairly routine part of the grand 
jury investigation, a sweeping legal precaution against the destruction of back 
records that might be needed in the future. Some traders estimated that the 
subpoenas cover anywhere from 500 million to 1 billion past trades on the two 
exchanges and clearly don't imply guilt on the part of all member firms. 
</P>
<P>
But commodities traders and attorneys involved in the case said some of the 
subpoenas handed out Tuesday sought records for specific trades on specific 
dates. Such requests suggest that the government is seeking to establish a 
"paper trail" behind the fraud uncovered by its undercover agents who posed as 
traders on the floors of both exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said Tuesday that some subpoenas also sought back records of unfilled 
customer orders, indicating that federal investigators are looking into the 
possibility that brokers on the floor have been cheating or shortchanging their 
outside customers. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a federal grand jury is meeting this week to begin to take testimony 
in the case, which may involve as many as 100 traders on both exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
One commodities attorney, a former assistant federal prosecutor, said traders 
and brokers who have been subpoenaed are scheduled to go before the grand jury 
today, initially to give handwriting samples to the panel. Witnesses who have 
agreed to cooperate are scheduled to begin giving testimony next week, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In what may be this week's most dramatic development in the widening 
commodities scandal, traders on the Chicago Board of Trade said Tuesday that 
some individual floor traders sought to boycott trading with the company that 
provided cover to the FBI agents who infiltrated the exchange's pits. 
Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., the world's largest soybean processor, trained two 
FBI agents in commodities trading, and their lengthy undercover sting operation 
has formed the heart of the federal investigation at the exchange. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unusual Move 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, some individual floor traders in the Board of Trade's soybean pit, 
where an FBI agent known as Richard Carlson had spent most of his time while he 
was under cover, refused to do business with ADM Investor Services, 
Archer-Daniels-Midland's Chicago-based commodities trading arm. 
</P>
<P>
"They had difficulty getting independent traders to fill their orders," said 
John Troelstrup, a Chicago commodities lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
In a highly unusual move, ADM's Board of Trade floor manager, or supervisor, 
was forced to step into the soybean pit and personally handle ADM's trading 
because independent traders, especially in the "top step" section of the 
soybean pit where Carlson had worked, were refusing to do so, traders said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Large grain processing companies such as Archer-Daniels-Midland often use both 
in-house and independent traders to execute their trades, industry observers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said the Monday boycott was a protest against ADM's involvement in the 
sting operation and shows the depth of resentment starting to well up among 
traders against the federal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"In the area where Carlson used to stand, the traders decided they didn't want 
to take any ADM business," said one executive of a trading firm. "There is not 
a real good feeling about ADM, that's obvious." 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody wanted to do business with ADM," said Randy Wells, a vice president at 
Balfour Maclaine, a major Chicago trading firm. "Nobody wanted to touch their 
paper (futures contracts). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Refused to Comment 
</P>
<P>
"The feeling is, they put everyone's livelihood in danger," by providing a 
cover for the sting operation, Wells added. "If they had a problem, why didn't 
they go to the Board of Trade itself?" 
</P>
<P>
An ADM spokesman at the firm's Decatur, Ill., headquarters refused to comment 
on possible resentment against ADM among floor traders in Chicago. He said only 
that "trading was normal" Tuesday but refused to comment on whether ADM had 
encountered trouble in the pits on Monday.

S&amp;L BAILOUT PLAN WOULD TAX CUSTOMERS;

TREASURY PROPOSAL TARGETS DEPOSITS AT FEDERALLY INSURED INSTITUTIONS

White House is considering forcing customers of banks and savings and loans to 
pay a large part of the multibillion-dollar cost of rescuing the S&amp;L 
industry, where hundreds of institutions are failing because of widespread 
fraud and mismanagement. 
</P>
<P>
Even as President Bush was promising last week not to raise taxes, Treasury 
Department officials were trying to win support from Congress for a proposal to 
tax depositors who put money in federally insured institutions, congressional 
sources said yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
Treasury officials met secretly with leaders of the House Banking Committee 
last week and Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady met with Senate Republican 
leaders again Tuesday and discussed the proposal, which would impose a tax of 
as much as 30 cents for every $100 deposited at a federally insured 
institution, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the reverse toaster theory," said Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. 
Chairman L. William Seidman, when asked what he thought of such a proposal. 
"Instead of the bank giving you a toaster when you make a deposit, you give 
them one." 
</P>
<P>
The proposal -- one of several options the White House is considering to raise 
the $50 billion to $100 billion that it is expected to cost to clean up the 
S&amp;L industry -- received a very chilly reception in Congress, getting what 
one White House official called "the Bronx cheer." 
</P>
<P>
Brady is expected to give Bush a list of options as early as next week to pay 
for the S&amp;L cleanup. The options will range from issuing bonds backed by 
the S&amp;L industry, to taxes on deposits or other consumer services offered 
by banks and S&amp;Ls, to a direct hit on the U.S. Treasury, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional sources said they did not know if the negative reaction on 
Capital Hill has caused Brady to remove a tax on customer deposits from the 
list of options. But they said one option that Brady still is considering is 
some other sort of "user tax," possibly a special fee that customers of a bank 
or S&amp;L would pay on services other than deposits, such as a home loan. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal presented to lawmakers in recent days, Treasury officials 
envisioned charging what amounts to about one-third of a penny for every dollar 
of the $3 trillion deposited in checking, savings and other accounts at 
federally insured banks and S&amp;Ls nationwide. The tax would raise an 
estimated $9 billion a year, enough to cover the government's annual interest 
payments on the $20 billion to $30 billion it will have to raise annually for 
several years to close hundreds of insolvent S&amp;Ls and pay off depositors. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed tax would apply to deposits at S&amp;Ls and at commercial banks, 
sources said, so there would be no shift from one federally insured type of 
institution to another. But congressional leaders said such a tax would make 
banks and S&amp;Ls less competitive with money-market funds and other savings 
accounts that are not federally insured. 
</P>
<P>
And, the leaders said, such a tax would be a nightmare to administer. Treasury 
officials have not worked out how the fee would be collected, they said. 
</P>
<P>
But no matter what method is used, congressional sources said, customers would 
end up paying the fee under the Treasury proposal to tax deposits. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers in the House promptly objected to the proposal, and senior 
Administration sources said Brady received a similarly cool response from 
senators. 
</P>
<P>
Although Bush will be given the Treasury's list of options soon, the 
Administration is not expected to unveil the proposals to the public until late 
February during hearings before the Senate Banking Committee, aides on the 
committee said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Reagan and Bush administrations have said they want to exhaust 
every source of private funding to pay for the S&amp;L bailout before using 
federal money. 
</P>
<P>
A senior Administration source stressed Tuesday that Administration officials 
have reached no conclusions and have expressed no preference for one option 
over another of the many they will present to Bush. 
</P>
<P>
They would not discuss whether any increase in the premium would be charged 
directly to depositors or added to operating expenses. Bush repeatedly had said 
he will not raise taxes, using the phrase "Read my lips" as a rallying cry 
during his campaign and after his election. In interviews last week, he 
repeated his pledge not to raise taxes, and his newly appointed budget 
director, Richard Darman, reaffirmed that policy in confirmation hearings 
before the Senate last week. 
</P>
<P>
Darman made it clear that any charge that looked like a tax would be considered 
a tax by the new Administration, regardless of whether the charge was called a 
user fee or any other name.

JAMES FLANIGAN: TEXACO STRESSES THE 'SHARE' IN 'SHAREHOLDERS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Texaco -- the big oil company that in the last two years has endured 
bankruptcy, a $3-billion lawsuit settlement and sale of about $5 billion worth 
of its assets -- made really important news the other day. 
</P>
<P>
At the suggestion of the California Public Employees Retirement System, one of 
its major shareholders, Texaco appointed a new director to its board -- John 
Brademas, president of New York University and formerly a powerful member of 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Why is that news? Because it establishes a precedent of pension fund 
shareholders acting directly to influence policy in a major company and thus 
marks an evolutionary step in the development of U.S. corporations. It could 
well be a healthy development, leading to greater stability and long-term 
investment vision among U.S. corporations. 
</P>
<P>
But a bit of background is needed to understand why. For years the stock of 
America's companies has been increasingly owned by the retirement funds of 
other companies, state and local government agencies and nonprofit institutions 
such as universities and hospitals. Employees, in other words, own American 
business. Which was precisely the intent of one of the originators of the 
pension system Charles E. Wilson, a president of General Motors. In 1950 -- 
according to "The Unseen Revolution," by Peter F. Drucker -- Wilson devised a 
plan for an employee pension fund that would invest in the common stock of 
other corporations. 
</P>
<P>
The idea caught on. Within a year after Wilson introduced his plan at GM, 8,000 
similar pension funds were set up. And today, according to Columbia 
University's Center for Law and Economics, the pension funds have almost $1.8 
trillion invested, own more than 20% of all the company stock in the land and 
more than 33% of the 50 largest corporations. They are potentially what Wilson 
saw them as, a great, stable and democratic source of financing for U.S. 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Cooperative Spirit 
</P>
<P>
But only potentially. Unfortunately, as the pension funds grew they acquired a 
reputation as indifferent owners that sold company stock at the first sign of 
faltering profit, and that jumped at buyout offers from corporate raiders. 
Studies showing massive short-term trading by pension funds reinforced that 
reputation, and the irony emerged of an employee ownership system being cursed 
for putting employees out of work. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Texaco's agreement with the California Public Employees Retirement 
System (CALPERS) is being hailed as evidence of a new cooperative spirit. Dale 
Hanson, chief executive of CALPERS which owns 763,200 Texaco shares, had asked 
Texaco President James W. Kinnear last spring for the right to nominate a 
director and otherwise press shareholder concerns. Texaco, of course, had made 
mistakes costly to shareholders, among them its takeover of Getty Oil which had 
resulted ultimately in bankruptcy and a $3 billion payment to Pennzoil. Even as 
Hanson and Kinnear conferred last spring, Texaco faced a proxy fight from 
takeover artist Carl C. Icahn -- so Kinnear agreed to Hanson's request. 
Thereupon, CALPERS and other pension funds backed management in the proxy 
fight, and on Monday, Texaco management kept its part of the bargain by 
nominating Brademas to the board. 
</P>
<P>
The stock market was immediately displeased, seeing management-shareholder 
cooperation as lessening chances of a renewed takeover battle for Texaco, a 
company that according to several analysts is now rich with cash and oil 
properties worth more than the market price of its stock. Texaco's stock fell 
at news of the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Is the market perspective correct? Will cooperation condemn shareholders to 
undervalued stock and eliminate chances for takeover bonanzas? No, of course 
not, says Hanson of CALPERS, which has $47.2 billion in pension assets and 
share ownership in more than 1,300 companies. "We'll consider all offers," he 
says -- while being careful to separate real offers from illusory ones, like 
Icahn's, with more talk than money behind them. 
</P>
<P>
Texaco, for its part, is going to make a distribution to shareholders of $1.7 
billion, or $7 a share, to make up for dividends they lost during its 
bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
The reality is that increased participation by major shareholders could produce 
more intelligent communication between owners and managers and a vast 
improvement on the jumpy, nervous system of today. In any event, we'll see more 
of it. 
</P>
<P>
Having won their point at Texaco, the big pension funds such as CALPERS are 
sure to carry their quest for direct influence to other big companies. 
</P>
<P>
The special irony is that it was the same Texaco, with a 1984 blunder, that 
sparked the new shareholder activism. At that time, with Texaco selling for 
about $35 a share, the wealthy Bass brothers of Ft. Worth started buying the 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
Texaco's management at the time, fearing a takeover move, paid the Bass 
brothers $50 a share to sell their stock and go away. CALPERS and other pension 
funds were enraged at such "greenmail," and thereupon formed the Council of 
Institutional Investors to fight for their interests. 
</P>
<P>
Their first big victory was Brademas' appointment on Monday by Texaco -- 
corporate America's unwitting pacesetter.

A cellular phone industry group announced that a disagreement over transmission 
standards had been settled, helping to clear the way for the next generation of 
cheaper and more secure mobile phones. The Cellular Telecommunications Industry 
Assn. said its board unanimously endorsed a decision reached last week by the 
standard-setting Telecommunications Industry Assn. The agreement covers the 
method by which phone calls will be sent over the air in the form of digital 
signals, the language of computers. The first cellular phones that use digital 
transmission are expected to be introduced in the United States in 1991.

Occidental Petroleum Corp. has had offers to buy its Libyan oil interests, but 
Libya's leader, Col. Moammar Kadafi, has urged the company not to sell out, 
Occidental Chairman Armand Hammer said. "We have had offers to buy our position 
in Libya -- real good offers," Hammer told securities analysts at a meeting in 
New York. But "Kadafi said, 'Please don't leave,' and he offered us better 
terms if we stayed," Hammer said. Together with Du Pont's Conoco Inc., USX 
Corp.'s Marathon Oil Co., W. R. Grace &amp; Co. and Amerada Hess Corp., 
Occidental owns a 49% stake in Libyan National Oil Co. Hammer also said the 
company's 1988 earnings, which are expected to be reported later this week, 
would be up sharply from the $240 million recorded in 1987. Hammer also 
disclosed that relatives of the 167 victims of July's explosion of a company 
oil rig in the North Sea have been offered a total of $187 million in 
compensation payment and added that he believed most of the families would 
accept them.

AST Research Inc. in Irvine, buffeted by increasing competition in the personal 
computer industry, Tuesday reported an $8.9-million loss for the quarter ended 
Dec. 30 and said it is eliminating 120 positions. 
</P>
<P>
AST handed out pink slips Monday night and Tuesday morning to 70 management, 
marketing and assembly employees in Irvine. The layoffs took effect 
immediately. AST said the dismissed employees would receive severance pay. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty Orange County positions that were vacated last month through attrition 
will not be filled, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, AST said it is eliminating 30 positions in other areas of the 
United States and overseas through a combination of layoffs and attrition, 
bringing the total work force reduction to 120. 
</P>
<P>
As of Dec. 30, AST had 1,234 employees in Orange County and 2,025 workers 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
Several workers on Tuesday said they expected the layoffs after AST announced 
earlier this month that it would report a sizable loss for its fiscal 1989 
second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
AST said it lost $8.9 million on revenue of $110.9 million for the three 
months. The company earned $2 million on revenue of $92.6 million in the 
year-ago quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been rumors for the last three weeks to a month about layoffs," 
said Lloyd Allsopp, a worker at AST's manufacturing facility in Irvine. Allsopp 
was not laid off. 
</P>
<P>
AST's announcement did not surprise Wall Street, either. Several high-tech 
firms have announced personnel cutbacks in the past few weeks, including 
Western Digital Corp. in Irvine and Wyse Technology in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
AST President Safi Qureshey was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
About a third of AST's second-quarter loss stems from a writedown of the 
recorded value of assets of the company's Camintonn division, which makes 
products for systems compatible with Digital Equipment Corp. computers. 
</P>
<P>
AST has said it would like to sell Camintonn. The company took the writedown, 
said Finance Vice President Jerry Ulrich, because AST believes that the price 
it eventually receives for Camintonn will be about $3 million below the stated 
value of the division's assets. 
</P>
<P>
Another $2.6-million loss reserve was booked in the second quarter to account 
for the cost of employee severance packages as well as a drop in the value of 
some of AST's inventory. 
</P>
<P>
The remainder of the loss was attributed to costly marketing strategies adopted 
by AST to try to keep its customers.

HIGHER RATES PAID ON SOME OUT-OF-STATE BANK ACCOUNTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
California consumers earn less interest on certain kinds of bank accounts than 
consumers nationally, Federal Reserve economists confirmed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
After a monthlong review of interest rates and other factors, the federal bank 
economists said they found that the lower deposit rates are mainly limited to 
accounts with costly transaction charges, such as money market deposit 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
The lower rates paid on some accounts do not necessarily prove or disprove a 
lack of competition, the economists said in a report issued by the Federal 
Reserve Bank of San Francisco in a weekly newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
But they said the lower rates may stem from the high cost of providing special 
services and maintaining an extensive branch banking system, rather than a lack 
of competition. 
</P>
<P>
After adjusting for loan losses, they also found that California banks' profits 
paralleled the average profits of banks across the country during the past five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"Overhead expenses are substantially higher in California than in other 
populous states and in the U.S. as a whole," the economists said. "This could 
suggest that California banks, operating in a less competitive market, are not 
forced to operate as efficiently as are banks elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, several consumer groups, led by Consumers Union, demanded that Gov. 
George Deukmejian and the state attorney general investigate an apparent lack 
of competition among California banks. The groups also wanted to know why 
interest rates paid by California banks on some deposits are lower than in 
other states. 
</P>
<P>
There are more than 5,000 bank branches in California and the state's five 
largest banks operate about half of them, the report said. In contrast, banks 
in New York and Illinois operate far fewer branches and offer limited retail 
customer services, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very disappointing to say Californians have to pay more (for loans) and 
earn less money because California banks have such a high overhead," said Harry 
Snyder, West Coast regional director of Consumers Union in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder said his organization's demand for an inquiry stemmed from a weekly 
review of interest rates paid by banks across the country. 
</P>
<P>
"I found that California banks on average are charging more than 4.5% more for 
consumer loans and paying a point and a half less on deposits," Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder said he was disappointed at the Federal Reserve Bank economists' 
conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
"We are hoping that John Van de Kamp, state attorney general, will take a 
harder, more critical look at this," Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Neuberger, an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank, said the first 
part of the study dealt with interest rates paid on deposits. Next, the 
economists plan to study the rates charged for bank loans. He cautioned that 
the report only presents preliminary conclusions.

PACTEL'S YEARLY PROFIT A RECORD $1.19 BILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Despite flat fourth-quarter earnings, Pacific Telesis Group said Tuesday that 
its 1988 profit topped the billion-dollar mark for the first time. Net income 
for the year was up 27.1% from a year earlier to $1.19 billion, on revenue that 
rose 3.6% to $9.48 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco-based company noted that its 1987 results were sharply 
reduced by a number of one-time expenses. These included the costs of trimming 
its payroll through an early retirement program and a state-ordered refund to 
customers of the company's main subsidiary, Pacific Bell. Without those 
one-time charges, 1988 earnings were up 6.4% from the year before. 
</P>
<P>
Fourth-quarter net was $249 million, up from $150 million a year earlier. 
Discounting the effect of the special charges in 1987, however, the results for 
the final quarter of 1988 were "essentially flat," the company said. 
</P>
<P>
PacTel Personal Communications, an unregulated subsidiary that provides 
cellular mobile-phone and electronic-paging services, showed continued rapid 
growth and increased profitability. The cellular-paging unit generated $381.1 
million in revenue last year, up from $270.1 million in 1987, and contributed 
$16.6 million to corporate profit, up from $5.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Cellular has experienced explosive growth since we began acquiring properties 
in 1985 and 1986," said Pacific Telesis Chairman and Chief Executive Sam Ginn. 
"This is a critical source of growth for us in the future." 
</P>
<P>
Since Pacific Telesis' formation five years ago after the breakup of the old 
Bell System, Ginn said, the regional holding company's earnings have grown an 
average of 7.3% a year. 
</P>
<P>
Also Tuesday, Southwestern Bell, Pacific Telesis' counterpart in St. Louis, 
said a strong fourth quarter helped increase net income for the fourth straight 
year -- but only barely. The company earned $1.06 billion last year, just 
topping 1987's $1.05 billion.

COFFEE PLUNGES AS MARKET ANTICIPATES BRAZILIAN GLUT

Coffee futures prices fell drastically Tuesday on the Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa 
Exchange in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The March contract dropped 634 points, or 6.34 cents, during the trading 
session. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a blood bath," said Bert Ruiz, a broker in New York with Balfour 
Maclaine Corp. "The decline was due to the anticipation of a greater 
availability of coffee from Brazil. The market will be flooded with Brazilian 
coffee, due to the government's economic austerity plan introduced last week." 
</P>
<P>
Because of new warehouse fees, Brazilian coffee exporters have had to unload 
their coffee onto the world market, Ruiz said. 
</P>
<P>
Futures prices have been rising since early December but have leveled off since 
a March contract high of $1.66.90 on Jan. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Coffee settled 5.70 cents to 6.34 cents lower, with the contract for delivery 
in March at $1.3451. 
</P>
<P>
Futures prices of soybeans and corn climbed higher while wheat prices sank at 
the close on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
Soybeans advanced more than 11 cents for the March spot contract. 
</P>
<P>
"A rumor that the Russians bought 600,000 tons of soy pellets from Brazil or 
the United States supported the beans, and corn went along for the ride," said 
Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wheat Prices Slump 
</P>
<P>
Weighing on wheat prices were a forecast of rain in the Great Plains growing 
area and talk that Agriculture Secretary-designate Clayton K. Yeutter "isn't 
too keen on export bonuses," Lespinasse said. 
</P>
<P>
At the close, wheat was 4.25 cents to 7 cents lower, with the contract for 
delivery in March at $4.37.75 a bushel; corn was 2 cents to 3.25 cents higher, 
with March at $2.72.25 a bushel; oats were 0.75 cent to 2 cents lower, with 
March at $2.3525 a bushel, and soybeans were 5.25 cents to 12 cents higher, 
with March at $7.675 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
Futures prices of livestock and meat finished mixed to mostly lower after 
drifting higher most of the day on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
The market dipped in anticipation of an Agriculture Department cold storage 
report showing record inventories of frozen pork bellies, said Chuck Levitt, 
livestock analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. 
</P>
<P>
While the report -- released after the closing bell -- had 113.3 million pork 
bellies on hand Dec. 31, the largest number ever for that date, it was still 7 
million less than expected, Levitt said. 
</P>
<P>
Live cattle prices, supported by packer demand, were mixed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Live cattle settled 0.27 cent lower to 0.30 cent higher, with the contract for 
delivery in February at 72.82 cents a pound; feeder cattle were 0.17 cent lower 
to 0.30 cent higher, with January at 83.55 cents a pound; live hogs were 0.20 
cent lower to 0.10 cent higher, with February at 43.12 cents a pound, and 
frozen pork bellies were 0.55 cent lower to 0.20 cent higher, with February at 
39.15 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Precious Metals Drop 
</P>
<P>
Gold and silver prices tumbled on the Commodity Exchange in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Gold settled $1.80 to $2.90 lower, with the contract for delivery in January at 
$406.30 an ounce; silver was 6.4 cents to 7.1 cents lower, with January at 
$6.13 an ounce.

WINTER WHEAT PLANTING UP 12% OVER LAST YEAR

<P>
Farmers have planted about 54.5 million acres of winter wheat for harvest this 
year, up 12% from 1988, the Agriculture Department says. 
</P>
<P>
Winter wheat is planted in the fall and harvested the following year. It 
accounts for about three-fourths of the total U.S. wheat output. 
</P>
<P>
Production was reduced last year by drought, and brisk export demand has helped 
reduce stockpiles. With greater demand, prices have risen substantially the 
past year. 
</P>
<P>
Also, farmers are being required to idle only 10% of their wheat base acres for 
1989 to qualify for government price supports, compared to 27.5% previously. 
</P>
<P>
The 54.5 million acres of winter wheat planted for 1989 is the largest acreage 
since 57.8 million acres were planted for the 1985 harvest, according to USDA 
records.

BOND PRICE RISE TIED TO DOLLAR'S STRONG RALLY

Long-term government bond prices rose strongly Tuesday, buoyed by a dollar 
rally inspired by Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan's comments 
about the central bank's inflation-fighting strategy. 
</P>
<P>
Other government issues posted moderate gains. 
</P>
<P>
The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 3/4 point, or $7.50 for every $1,000 
in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, 
fell to 8.78% from 8.85% late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed the credit market's performance to the way the dollar 
behaved after Greenspan expressed the central bank's determination to fight 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Testifying before the House Banking Committee, Greenspan said strains on 
factory capacity and a tight labor market, particularly in the Northeast, 
likely would keep inflation pressures high. The central bank's monetary policy 
therefore should continue on the tight side, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sale of Two-Year Notes 
</P>
<P>
The notion that a tighter monetary policy could drive interest rates higher, 
increasing returns on dollar-denominated investments relative to holdings in 
other currencies, propped up the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
For bond traders, this implied that demand will be brisk at sales of government 
notes and bonds. The Treasury is scheduled to sell about $9.25 billion of 
two-year notes on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term government 
issues rose by between 1/16 point and 1/8 point, intermediate maturities rose 
by 5/16 point, and long-term issues were up about 3/4 point, according to 
Telerate Inc., a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond 
with a $1,000 face value. 
</P>
<P>
The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price 
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or 
longer, went up 2.84 to 1,141.95. 
</P>
<P>
In corporate bond trading, industrials were up. Moody's investment grade 
corporate bond index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with 
maturities of five years or longer, rose 1.51 to 299.87. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
3-Month Yields Decline 
</P>
<P>
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal 
bonds rose 5/32 point to 92 17/32. The average yield to maturity declined to 
7.64% from 7.66% late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Yields on three-month Treasury bills declined to 8.50 as the discount fell to 
8.22%. Yields on six-month bills held steady at 8.72% and the discount remained 
at 8.26%. Yields on one-year bills declined to 8.88% as the discount fell to 
8.23%. 
</P>
<P>
A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the 
annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The discount is the 
percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at 
maturity. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted at 9 1/16%, up from 9% late Monday.

Japan will start developing a high-speed ship that can cruise at speeds much 
faster than conventional transport ships and cross the Pacific in about three 
days, the Transport Ministry said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The ministry said it has obtained a $5.9-million allocation for research and 
development of the project in fiscal 1989, starting on April 1. 
</P>
<P>
The total outlay for research and development of the project is estimated at 
about $71 million. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed ship, named the "Techno-Super Liner," will be powered by one or 
more gas-turbine water-jet engines. The ship will cruise at 50 knots, or 58 
m.p.h. -- about 2 1/2 times the speed of conventional container ships.

FROM BUSINESS TOOL TO HOMEWORK AID TO MONKEY BUSINESS, THE MACHINE'S TAKEN OVER

Why are all those Beverly Hills home fax machines purring away late at night? 
Stockbrokers passing hot tips on to blue-chip customers? Movie execs swapping 
script outlines into the night? Foodies sending finicky take-out orders to 
their favorite delis? 
</P>
<P>
Would you believe homework? 
</P>
<P>
According to fax machine providers, Westsiders who own the devices and have 
teen-agers (who understandably wish to remain anonymous) are likely to have 
their machines tied up at night with school assignments being faxed back and 
forth. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Parental Approval 
</P>
<P>
And even those kids who do their homework unassisted are eager to use faxes to 
create electronic study groups -- with parental approval. "My daughter is just 
waiting for somebody in her class to have a parent bring a fax machine home," 
said Bill McCue, president of Public FAX in Orange. "They always forget stuff . 
. . she'll call up a girlfriend and try to figure out how to do math problems. 
You ever try to do math over the phone?" 
</P>
<P>
It's all part of the growing fax consciousness. Initially introduced as a 
business tool, facsimile machines -- which send and receive documents over 
telephone lines in seconds -- are suddenly being employed for an expanding 
array of personal uses: everything from playing chess to executing practical 
jokes to sending holiday greetings to locating missing children. 
</P>
<P>
Not only has the abbreviation fax made it into Webster's, the number of fax 
machines in the country has grown to 1.7 million, according to estimates of 
analysts at San Jose's Dataquest, a high-tech market research and consulting 
firm. As most of those machines are still in offices, business applications are 
also expanding rapidly and becoming far more creative. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors now routinely fax prescriptions to pharmacies. Fire department 
personnel fax blueprints of buildings to fire fighters at fire sites. And 
high-tech bill collectors now have a lightning-quick retort for deadbeats who 
claim they lost or didn't receive an invoice in the mail: They fax a new one 
immediately and it gets there in less than a minute. 
</P>
<P>
Some observers claim the most innovative business application to date is 
intra-office faxing. "What we're starting to see at a lot of companies is 
people faxing one desk to another," said Ray Jeter of Just the Fax, an 
Irvine-based chain of fax retailers. 
</P>
<P>
At AST Research, also in Irvine, employees frequently fax documents to each 
other rather than using messengers to deliver them. "We have regular mail 
clerks, but facsimile is so much faster," enthused Ron Place, office services 
supervisor. "We're spread out across two or three buildings . . . altogether in 
excess of half a million square feet . . . I don't know how we lived without 
(fax machines) before." 
</P>
<P>
Fax has also enlivened the formats of radio stations eager to court those who 
listen at the office (especially since the Arbitron ratings were recently 
expanded to monitor office listening habits). Numerous stations have invited 
audiences to communicate with deejays via office fax machines. Some, such as 
WMMR in Philadelphia, have even asked listeners to "fax us your body parts." 
</P>
<P>
That sport showed up recently on the sitcom "Murphy Brown," when the TV 
reporter played by Candice Bergen explained her absence from the office 
Christmas party, saying, "The memory of last year's party is still fresh in my 
mind. Perhaps you heard about it. I drank all the punch and faxed my chest to 
the West Coast." 
</P>
<P>
On KABC's "Ken &amp; Bob Co.," a high-rated, morning drive-time show, listeners 
have been instructed to fax in such things as stupid instructions that 
accompany products. The fax format became so popular the duo formed a special 
club for waxing silly with office listeners via fax. 
</P>
<P>
But is this what the fax revolution has come to? Charter membership in Ken and 
Bob's "Nine O'Clock Fax Club"? 
</P>
<P>
"You don't buy a fax machine to phone in trivia to a radio station or to order 
a ham and rye at a deli," contended McCue, who, as an industry consultant and 
publisher of a directory of 5,000 public fax stations, is sometimes called the 
"guru of fax." 
</P>
<P>
"You buy it for a business use, then that expands. People who buy fax machines 
become enlightened -- and addicted. They start using it in ways they never 
imagined." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, faxaholics are multiplying at such a frenetic rate that some experts 
predict the medium is likely to beat out the computer as the next major 
contraption to link up the entire world. 
</P>
<P>
Stephan Schwartz, chairman and research director of the Los Angeles-based 
Mobius Society, has sent fax communication "all over the world" since the 
1970s, when the medium was slow and commercially known by the name Qwip. 
Lately, Schwartz said he's been sending faxes between the United States and the 
Soviet Union to speed up a number of citizen diplomacy projects in which he's 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Even Into Soviet Union 
</P>
<P>
"There aren't many fax machines yet in the Soviet Union but I think the Soviets 
are going to embrace the technology with great gusto. . . . We've sent 
pictures, maps, charts, spread sheets . . . letters," said Schwartz, whose 
organization is best known for such projects as psychic-assisted archeological 
digs. "You can send anything you can photocopy. The fax is like a little space 
bridge." 
</P>
<P>
Not only do fax machines transmit drawings and photographs (minus a few half 
tones), they're notoriously easy to operate. (Basically, you insert a piece of 
paper and punch in a phone number.) What's more, prices have come down; you can 
now purchase a fax machine for as little as $600, up to $2,500. 
</P>
<P>
They're hot, convenient, easy to use and increasingly affordable. Is it any 
wonder that fax machines are now affecting people's lives from the cradle to 
the grave? 
</P>
<P>
McCue observes that a Klamath Falls, Ore., public fax outlet "does a husky 
business with local morticians with a 
</P>
<P>
need to get interment papers signed rapidly." And on New Year's Day, one of his 
Public FAX employees gave birth to a baby at 1:30 p.m. After the baby's 
footprints were recorded, they were faxed to Carbondale, Ill., to the baby's 
great-grandparents, who received the prints within an hour of the birth. 
</P>
<P>
Judi Kaufman, who sometimes advises corporate clients on "fax etiquette" as a 
part of the services of her gift-buying firm, would no doubt approve. 
</P>
<P>
Kaufman, however, generally cautions against sending faxed greetings and 
thank-you notes -- unless the spontaneity of the medium is warranted by the 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
"The only way faxed thank-you notes are effective is if they're sent back 
immediately after receiving a gift delivered by courier," said the owner of 
Beverly Hills-based Judi Kaufman &amp; Co. "It has to work with the nature of 
the gift." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Care Advised 
</P>
<P>
Kaufman also advises users to be careful when punching in fax numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"I got an entire musical score faxed in from New York by mistake," said Maxine 
Weinman, owner of Maxine's Seafood Cafe in Hollywood, where about 20% to 30% of 
take-out orders come through her "Fax It to Max" service. 
</P>
<P>
More than a few of Max's faxes look like mistakes but prove to be orders, 
Weinman added. One order came completely in drawings: a fish and a sword for 
swordfish, a fish in a cage for Cajun fish. Another order (featuring a drawing 
of a large apple, a piece of cheese and a piece of cake) momentarily stumped 
the restaurant crew. "We finally figured out it was for New York cheese cake," 
Weinman said. 
</P>
<P>
Weinman reports she enjoys the communications from her creative faxers and 
doesn't mind the inconvenience of an occasional mix-up, because her take-out 
orders are processed more accurately and efficiently than they would be if 
taken by phone. 
</P>
<P>
But Kaufman warns that wrong numbers on fax deliveries could result in "state 
of the art faux pas." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
IRS Tax Notices Sent 
</P>
<P>
Consider the temporary terror a local shopkeeper experienced when an IRS audit 
form crossed her fax machine and she assumed it was meant for her. (She later 
discovered her husband had told a client to send him a copy of the form on his 
wife's fax machine but neglected to tell her it was coming.) 
</P>
<P>
"Twice this week, people have faxed me confidential information that was 
intended for somebody else," Kaufman said. Another phenomenon she sees more and 
more is the snobbery of fax-haves vs. fax-nots. 
</P>
<P>
"Especially in Los Angeles, there's a group who thinks that if you don't have a 
fax you're out of the loop of business," she observed. "For small, 
entrepreneurial companies in a tight financial market, it's a difficult issue 
to handle." 
</P>
<P>
Public FAX's McCue points out, however, that "the poor man's fax is a $10 
decision to use a public fax station. When people say to (a faxless person), 
'What's your fax number?', the person . . . can give the fax number of a public 
station. And no one's the wiser." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Solved His Embarrassment 
</P>
<P>
Jack Nilles, senior research associate at the USC School of Business 
Administration's Center for Effective Organizations, recently solved his 
embarrassment over faxlessness by getting a machine. "I was getting several 
calls a week where people would say, 'I'll fax you this.' Fortunately they 
couldn't see my face turn red over the phone," Nilles said. 
</P>
<P>
Nilles is one who suspects fax communication will beat out computer networking 
among offices and individuals who've absolutely, positively got to have it 
there faster than overnight. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been watching this for the last 10 years, to see if electronic (computer) 
mail or fax machines are going to win," he said. "In the interim, it looks like 
fax will beat out electronic mail." 
</P>
<P>
Dataquest's Greg Carlsted agrees. "The growth of facsimile is superior to 
E-mail (electronic computer mail) at this point," he said. In Carlsted's 
opinion, that's because people have become more and more aware of faxing, 
prices of the machines have decreased and standardization is allowing different 
types of machines to talk with one another. 
</P>
<P>
Carnegie Mellon University's Sara Kiesler, who for seven years has researched 
the social effects of electronic mail and other electronic exchanges of 
information, expects a swift merger between electronic mail and fax. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they will be so integrated in the near future that you won't be able 
to distinguish one from the other," said Kiesler, who is a professor of social 
sciences and social psychology. "(Asking which medium will dominate) is almost 
like saying 'Will television beat movies?' We have VCRs now. How can you 
distinguish?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Which Are Fakes? 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, with the growth in faxed communications, it's becoming increasingly 
tough to distinguish between genuine documents and fakes. 
</P>
<P>
Rand Corp. researcher Tora Bikson, a consultant to a United Nations task force 
studying electronic transferal of information, points out that the dramatic 
increase in fax use is raising all sorts of questions for organizations. Among 
those being studied at the U.N.: "How do organizations . . . control or 
document the use of fax? How do they distinguish between what's official 
communication and what's not?" 
</P>
<P>
As practical jokers have found, less-than-perfect fax reproduction of documents 
makes the medium appealing for forgeries of all kinds. An Indianapolis car 
salesman tells of what happened when he accidentally left a set of family 
photos behind at one car dealership before moving on to another. One of his 
former colleagues cut the photos apart so that the salesman's head was atop the 
body of his young son, sitting nude in a bathtub. 
</P>
<P>
"It was my second day on the new job when the picture came over the fax," Rick 
Moonshower recalled. "All of a sudden the women upstairs came down the stairs 
laughing. The photo had a note saying, 'Ladies, I'd like you to meet your new 
employee.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Personal Notes 
</P>
<P>
Other personal missives are not so much obscene as they are simply annoying. At 
Berkeley-based Ten Speed Press and Celestial Art publishing houses, publicity 
director Dayna Macy bemoans the fact that the organization receives daily faxes 
from "a set of authors who shall remain nameless." 
</P>
<P>
"We get seven-page faxes from them, 10-page faxes; they faxed their Christmas 
card to us. We pay for all this paper," Macy said. 
</P>
<P>
"This stuff makes people feel efficient, like they're doing something. And you 
can't hide from it anymore. They've got you by phone, by Federal Express and 
the last bastion -- they've got you by fax," she sighed. "You can't even hide 
under your desk anymore. There's a fax on top of it." 
</P>

SKIRT LENGTH: PARIS HEMS AND HAWS; 
</P>
<P>
MOST DESIGNERS BARE THE KNEE; LAGERFELD GOES LONGER

<P>
That troublesome skirt length question is still unresolved in the spring/summer 
couture collections now under way here. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Christian Lacroix, Marc Bohan at Dior and Emanuel Ungaro continue to 
endorse just-above-the-knee lengths, while Karl Lagerfeld for Chanel (who 
caused the whole controversy and confusion a year ago when he showed long mixed 
with short) puts the emphasis on low calf lengths. 
</P>
<P>
Lagerfeld has a handful of top-of-the-knee lengths, but he is obviously happier 
with longer, pleated georgette or chiffon skirts teamed with elongated jackets. 
When the skirts were in motion, the longer proportion looked great. Some of the 
narrow versions looked frankly retrospective. 
</P>
<P>
As if to indicate there was nothing old or aging about this proportion, 
Lagerfeld sent the models hopping and skipping down the runway like so many 
saucy little rich girls. Further emphasizing that jeune fille feeling: white 
stockings, black patent leather flats and big hats wrapped with wide taffeta 
bows. 
</P>
<P>
Pants, the alternative to the length controversy in many ready-to-wear 
collections, have been present but not emphasized at these custom shows. Only 
two pairs showed up at Chanel and both were beauties: black satin, wide-leg 
pants teamed with a black tunic-length wool jacket over a white satin blouse, 
and a long, narrow cardigan jacket in black wool crepe above trousers in 
matching fabric. 
</P>
<P>
The turnout for the Lagerfeld show Tuesday at the Theatre des Champs Elysees, 
home of the Orchestre de Paris, included everyone from the Begum Aga Khan and 
Princess Caroline of Monaco to Americans Susan Gutfreund and Mrs. Charles 
Wrightsman, not to mention Bernadette Chirac, wife of the mayor of Paris, Marie 
Helene de Rothschild and Madame David Weil of the French banking family. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Flash of Color 
</P>
<P>
While everyone else in Paris has collections filled with pretty pastels, 
Lagerfeld put the emphasis on navy and white, with an occasional flash of vivid 
color or a pastiche of delicate pastel. 
</P>
<P>
The luxury in this collection was the hand-pleated chiffon dresses, 
representing weeks of work in the couture studios. Over many of these "Daisy 
Buchanan" wisps of garments were re-embroidered masses of huge "diamonds" with 
the ubiquitous Chanel pearls wrapped around the throat and trailing practically 
to the knees. 
</P>
<P>
Again, as with Bohan's Dior collection shown Monday, there were pieces here 
that would work with Chanels already in one's wardrobe, as well as evening 
beauties that will surely wind up in a costume museum. 
</P>
<P>
Before his show, Emanuel Ungaro said his inspiration was Katharine Hepburn. 
</P>
<P>
"Looked more like Catherine the Great to me," an American observer commented 
after the last of the 74-piece collection had come down the runway. 
</P>
<P>
But couture is synonymous with luxury and luxury is what Ungaro gave his 
customers. While couture houses rarely discuss price, everything here looked 
megabucks: Think $25,000 to $30,000 for an outfit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Back to Louis XVI 
</P>
<P>
In this bicentenary of the French Revolution, the designer looked back to the 
ancien regime of Louis XVI: exquisite brocades reembroidered with gold threads; 
gold sequins and beads outlining necklines, lapels and pockets; hand woven lace 
insets shaping bosoms on flounce-skirted dresses billowing over petticoats, 
everything in the floral print mixes and fauve colors the designer loves. 
</P>
<P>
There was definitely a new silhouette here, with Ungaro dropping his signature 
drapings. Instead, fabrics were smocked or puckered from just below the bust to 
the top of the hips and then flared on those masses of petticoats. New, too, is 
his high, pulled-up and puffed shoulder which he used on all his jackets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Skirt Length 
</P>
<P>
For day, when he wasn't showing pants, he clung to a skirt length that always 
bared the knee, the shorter lengths stressed with shiny-surface tights and 
sling-back high-heel satin pumps. 
</P>
<P>
The background music, a trumpeter and organist playing selections from Purcell 
and Handel somehow seemed more suitable to a society wedding or a Royal 
Occasion than a fashion show but, never mind, it was all part of that unique 
Ungaro ambiance. 
</P>
<P>
Ditto the models' coiffures; hair swirled in a snail-shaped pompadour perched 
on the forehead then caught back into a low chignon. Depending on the fabrics 
and colors of an outfit, the models sometimes looked like Toulouse-Lautrec 
can-can dancers, sometimes like 18th-Century royals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Few Standouts 
</P>
<P>
There were a few simple standouts, however, especially the white satin 
halter-top dresses, the top pleated on the bias and anchored through the 
midriff with masses of silver and rhinestone beading. 
</P>
<P>
The collections continue today with Yves Saint Laurent and, in the evening, 
Gianni Versace's first couture collection at the Musee d'Orsay followed by a 
sit-down dinner and a private visit of the museum.

TOM JONES SENDS 'KISS' TO NEW AUDIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KRISTINE McKENNA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like Chippendale's male strip show for women, the world of Tom Jones is a 
special arena where drooling is not only allowed but encouraged. He of the 
bulging trousers, this harvester of used lingerie is the very embodiment of 
primal lust gone mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
Pulsating with an unthreatening old-fashioned machismo, Jones taught the book 
of love to American television audiences from 1969 to 1971, and his hugely 
popular weekly variety show made him a major star, while neutralizing his 
provocative performing style into an acceptable prime-time catharsis. TV has an 
amazing capacity to take the teeth out of anything, and for all Jones' pelvic 
gyrating and turned-on growling, he came off as a harmless Lothario whom even 
granny could love. 
</P>
<P>
The grannies still love Jones, but now a new young audience is discovering him, 
thanks to his current hit single, a remake of Prince's "Kiss" recorded with the 
British avant-pop group the Art of Noise. "Kiss" shows the 48-year-old Welshman 
to be none the worse for wear after 25 years in the business. 
</P>
<P>
His astonishingly muscular voice sounds as good -- if not better -- than it did 
on the string of hit singles that propelled him to stardom in the '60s. And 
while the "Kiss" video shows Jones -- who'll be at the Celebrity Theatre in 
Anaheim on Feb. 19 -- to be a tad more subdued than in the past, he's still no 
shrinking violet on stage. 
</P>
<P>
"The pants are not as tight as they used to be, because I don't think my age 
allows it," said Jones during an interview at his home in Bel-Air. "That's all 
right when you're young, but when you're middle aged -- well, I don't want to 
shock anybody or look rude. At the same time, as long as I keep myself in 
shape, I don't see any reason why I can't continue doing the kind of show I'm 
known for. 
</P>
<P>
"I often see other performers project sexuality in what I consider a tasteless 
way," he continued, warming to the subject. "I've seen Michael Jackson grab 
hold of his . . . well, I've never done that and people have always said, 'Hey, 
you're going over the bloody line here!' In his 'Sledeghammer' video Peter 
Gabriel moves the bottom part of his body in a way that's supposed to be 
sexual. . . . To me, that is not sexy." 
</P>
<P>
Remarkably free of the cynicism and bitterness that hangs like an acrid fog 
over many show business figures, Jones comes off as a simple, easygoing man, 
devoted to his family and seemingly thrilled with his lot in life. The father 
of a son and twice a grandfather, Jones has been married to Melinda since he 
was 16, and has weathered dozens of musical trends and a few cultural 
revolutions without falling prey to drugs, shady business dealings or his own 
ego swelling to painful proportions. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no reason to be bitter or paranoid because I haven't lost anything 
because of my career," he observes. "I could've done much more business-wise if 
I'd had a mind to, but business doesn't interest me. . . . I've had good people 
around me all along, and though lots of creeps have come around, I've always 
known what I wanted." 
</P>
<P>
Though Jones is often described as a middle-of-the-road balladeer (much to his 
annoyance), he cut his musical teeth in the early '60s playing down-and-dirty 
roots-rock alongside bands like the Rolling Stones. He keeps his stage show 
current with material by contemporary artists like Prince and Billy Idol. 
</P>
<P>
"I started performing in clubs when I was 16, playing on bills with bands like 
the Stones, but I wound up taking a very different road because of the audience 
I attracted," he recalls. "I remember being on a bill with the Stones at a club 
called Beat City, and I'm doing my thing, singing basic rock and these kids 
were looking at me like I frightened them! 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose I looked masculine and they didn't know what to make of that because 
in the '60s fellas were looking a bit effeminate. In fact, I had trouble 
getting a contract because of that. The record companies said I was 
old-fashioned because I looked and sounded like a man." 
</P>
<P>
The record companies might have been slow to catch on to Jones' appeal, but the 
ladies got the point immediately. From the time of his first hit single in 
1965, "It's Not Unusual," women made up the major portion of his audience. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been told that I give off a powerful male thing and I guess women respond 
to that," he modestly asserts. "However, I've never thought of myself as a 
ladies' man and don't design my shows with women in mind -- although I do 
always try to have some kind of sexual dynamic going on. When I say sex, I mean 
feeling -- a song has to make people react, make 'em laugh, cry, get horny, 
whatever." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his consistent performance on the charts in the late '60s and early 
'70s, he was often treated as a novelty act rather than a serious musician. 
</P>
<P>
"My musical abilities have been upstaged by my image and that's always bothered 
me. I never meant it to be that way and wasn't even aware of what was happening 
until I began reading reviews of my shows. Sometimes the reviews didn't even 
mention the voice. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I like the way I sing, and sound is very important to me. If I'm not making a 
powerful sound when I perform, then I don't feel right." 
</P>
<P>
The new fans who enjoyed the powerful sound Jones makes on "Kiss" should 
appreciate his new album, set for an April release on Jive Records. After six 
years of being creatively exiled to the country division of PolyGram Records, 
Jones hopes to reconnect with the pop audience with his 39th LP. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people think I'm no longer recording and I hope this record clears 
that misconception up," says Jones about the album. "I also hope the record 
shows that I'm more than a middle-of-the-road singer. I got that image because 
I played Vegas and was very successful there. I don't regret playing Vegas 
because I've had great times there, but there are other things I'm Capable of 
doing as a singer."

<P>
Perhaps the worst day was the one when Dick Wilson walked in a corporate vice 
president and walked out a warehouse supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the taunts about his age from his bosses at Monarch Paper Co., the 
sign on the wall that said, "Wilson is old," the feeling that all these people 
around him were hellbent on showing him the door. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Dick Wilson was 59. 
</P>
<P>
There were so many bad days back then, when younger men started taking over his 
duties, when he was offered a sales job at half pay. Later came the mental 
collapse, the deep depression diagnosed as potentially suicidal. Finally, there 
were the shock treatments. 
</P>
<P>
Now, it feels good to have a jury ruling that growing older is not a sin. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Millions in Damages 
</P>
<P>
When Dick Wilson had his day in court last December, the jurors believed him 
and not Monarch Paper Co. They awarded him $3.8 million, more than half of it 
punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
But the ordeal has extracted a price. Wilson must take lithium each day to calm 
himself. There were times when he thought the case would drag on forever, 
eating up family savings as it went. Still, it was worth it, he said, just to 
hear that Monarch was guilty of age discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Wilson's story is one that says much about the pitfalls an older 
generation of American workers faces, particularly in this era of mergers, 
takeovers and the trimming of work forces when companies are consolidated. 
Often, it is the older worker who is the first out the door. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's is perhaps an extreme example, but in less dramatic and more subtle 
ways, age discrimination is happening all the time in corporate America, even 
though the pool of younger employees is shrinking. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Few Bother to Sue 
</P>
<P>
In the last nine years, 129,035 charges of discrimination because of age were 
filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. That figure, however, 
reflects only a very small percentage of those who feel they have been shoved 
aside. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Mackaronis, a lawyer with the American Assn. of Retired Persons, said a 
Gallup survey commissioned by his organization found that of the people who 
felt they had been victimized, only 4% took any action. Many of the rest did 
not because such cases are difficult to prove, expensive and sometimes take 
years to resolve. And, Mackaronis said, age discrimination can take subtle 
forms -- such as when a company simply decides not to teach an older worker new 
skills -- that winning in court is far from certain. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fairly staggering," said Mackaronis. "It's commonplace in corporate 
America, but it is the exception, rather than the rule, that someone will 
pursue it." 
</P>
<P>
"It's the 'can't teach an old dog new tricks' mentality of corporate America 
that is responsible for most of these things." he said, "and it's a stupid 
policy." 
</P>
<P>
Burton Fretz, a lawyer with the National Senior Citizens Law Center, said that 
typically, there are two causes of age discrimination. One is the "longstanding 
stereotype that age equates to declining ability." The other is company 
downsizing, when work force cuts are made on the basis of age. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't contend that older people shouldn't be susceptible to layoffs, but it 
should be done on the basis of merit," he said. "When you start making 
age-biased decisions, that's when the trouble starts." 
</P>
<P>
Dick Wilson's life was cruising along nicely in 1981. He was Monarch's 
corporate vice president for physical distribution, as well as assistant to the 
company president, John Blankenship. He was making $35,000 a year and was 
eligible for a yearly $6,000 bonus. He had a company car, a liberal expense 
account and a membership at the downtown Metropolitan Racquet Club. He had been 
in the paper business for more than 30 years, and with Monarch since 1970.

<P>
2 Versions of Events 
</P>
<P>
As Wilson sees it, he was a loyal company man, good at his job, a valuable cog 
in the machine who was pushed hard to quit because of his age. It was the 
younger ones who wanted him out, particularly Hamilton Bisbee, who assumed the 
company presidency from Blankenship. So they demeaned him and called him names 
and ultimately stripped him of everything but his salary. The most important 
duty he had was keeping the warehouse clean. 
</P>
<P>
As management sees it, Wilson's discrimination charges were absurd. 
</P>
<P>
"They were doing more than they had to do," A. Martin Wickliff, Monarch's 
lawyer and the only person authorized to discuss the trial, said. "They didn't 
think they had done anything wrong." 
</P>
<P>
In the management version of events, Wilson was a plodder, a marginal 
performer, a man with a vice president's title but not much of a mind to go 
with it. He was promoted and protected by his friend and boss, Blankenship, who 
died of cancer in 1982. Wilson's duties had to be taken over because he 
couldn't handle them himself. Yes, he was offered a salesman's job in Corpus 
Christi at half pay, but that was standard policy. 
</P>
<P>
"He was treated like anyone else," Wickliff said. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, Wilson was called in on July 15, 1982, and given two choices. One 
was to be a warehouse supervisor. The other was to resign. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of that meeting, Wilson was the oldest person on the corporate 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
"What in God's earth did they think his reaction would be?" Mackaronis asked. 
"What an incredibly demeaning suggestion!" 
</P>
<P>
According to documents introduced at the trial, the actual plan was to 
terminate Wilson. Certainly Bisbee wanted him out. He disliked Wilson so much 
that he had quit talking to him. One confidential memo introduced as evidence 
was from Bisbee to Dick Gozon, president of Unisource, Monarch's parent company 
(which is a subsidiary of the multimillion-dollar Alco Standard Corp.). In it, 
Bisbee wrote that "poor, non-contributing trouble making, hang-ons should be 
terminated with a minimum of expense and effort," and then went on to name 
Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
"I would try to do this as professional as possible, but certainly would 
request that, on the day of our termination conversation, he vacate the 
premises while relinquishing his office keys and credit cards," Bisbee wrote. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not 'Corporate' Type 
</P>
<P>
Dick Wilson is not a man that central casting would have picked to play a 
corporate vice president. Certainly he wasn't Mr. Smooth. More than a few times 
he had gotten himself into hot water at the office with his gruff, bluntly 
stated opinions. His laugh occasionally was just a little too loud. 
</P>
<P>
But he was also nobody's fool. In Wilson's version of the story, he knew that 
Bisbee didn't like him and wanted him out. He began keeping a notebook of 
incidents he viewed as threatening to him. 
</P>
<P>
"Hell, yes, I knew what they were trying to do to me," he said. "They were 
trying to make me walk." 
</P>
<P>
But Wilson wasn't going to quit. The Houston economy was beginning its long 
downward spiral and his old boss, Blankenship, had admonished him never to quit 
Monarch because the severence benefits paid to a fired employee were so 
generous. 
</P>
<P>
"We fire too good," he had told Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
But this being the warehouse supervisor was something of a curve ball. From 
corporate vice president to the loading docks? In the end, Wilson decided to 
take the demotion, heeding Blankenship's advice. In August, 1982, when Wilson 
reported for work, he discovered that he would not be "the supervisor" of the 
entire warehouse, but "a supervisor" with duties that included housekeeping. In 
essence, Wilson saw himself as a man who had been demoted to pushing a broom. 
</P>
<P>
The company version: housekeeping in a paper company warehouse is very 
important work, and there was never any question of what Wilson's job would be. 
</P>
<P>
"It was as clear as day," Wickliff said. 
</P>
<P>
It was not a happy Christmas in the Wilson home in 1982. The demoted Wilson 
began flying into rages at the least provocation. He was, as one of his 
lawyers, Henri-Ann Nortman, put it, "bouncing off walls." He was also suffering 
from sinus attacks at work in the dusty warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Campaign of Taunts 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wilson said he was being demeaned at the warehouse as well, being 
called "the old man " by the people who were now his bosses. He said his 
immediate supervisor, Paul Bradley, went so far as to put up a cardboard sign 
in the warehouse that read: "Wilson is old." Bradley later testified that the 
sign was meant as a joke. Wilson didn't take it that way. 
</P>
<P>
"He was completely demoralized by then," said Nortman. "His family said they 
really started noting a change in personality." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson sought both physical and mental help, and on both counts doctors advised 
him not to return to work. One of those doctors, psychiatrist Laurence Taylor, 
went so far as to write Bradley a letter saying that Wilson's "depression is of 
such a degree at the present time that I seriously feel there is a possibility 
of suicide." 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 12, 1983, Wilson filed his first complaint with the Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission, beginning a series of events that would eventually 
bring the case before a Houston By March, 1983, wide, irrational mood swings 
had taken hold of him, and Wilson's family decided that he must be committed. 
He was handcuffed and taken to a mental hospital. In the course of therapy over 
the years, he was given 10 electroshock treatments. 
</P>
<P>
Later in 1983, Wilson went to see Stan Williams, a Houston lawyer, and told him 
what had happened over the previous two years. Williams wasn't the first lawyer 
Wilson had seen, but he was the first one who believed there was a valid age 
discrimination case to be made against Monarch. Williams eventually enlisted 
Nortman's help in trying the case. Then, last November, the battle finally came 
to the courtroom after years of delays. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides paraded their witnesses before the jury, but Monarch could not 
produce written proof that Wilson was the company's corporate dolt or that 
Blankenship had protected him during his years as a vice president. Wickliff 
acknowledged that it was one of the major weaknesses in Monarch's case. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Youth-Oriented Policy 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wilson's lawyers introduced evidence that a major goal of the 
company under Bisbee was a younger look. A long-range plan, written by Bisbee 
in mid-1982, had the word "young" sprinkled throughout. There were phrases such 
as "new blood to push the oldies," and "good young aggressive manager," and "we 
need to immediately develop a young management team," and "could be part of the 
young group." 
</P>
<P>
When the jurors -- whose ages ranged from 24 to 52 -- returned after a day and 
a half of deliberation, they awarded Wilson his millions, and $2.2 million of 
the total was for punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
The foreman, Debra Stepp, said later: "We wanted to tell other companies that 
you can't discriminate against employees because of age." 
</P>
<P>
Wickliff said Monarch will appeal, but would not say on what grounds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Death Affected Case 
</P>
<P>
Asked why the jury found for Wilson, Wickliff said: "That's a good question. I 
still don't know to this day." He said his case would have been strengthened by 
the testimony of Blankenship, the late president of the company. Many of 
Monarch's witnesses said that before his death, Blankenship had told them 
Wilson eventually would have to be removed from his job. 
</P>
<P>
"They blamed everything on a dead man," Williams scoffed. 
</P>
<P>
As for Wilson, his victory is in proving his point. 
</P>
<P>
"It was all part of the youth drive, that's all there was to it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Funny, though, he said: "I would have settled for a year's salary and my 
company car."

IMMIGRANT TEENS FIND LITTLE REFUGE

<TEXT>
<P>
When a work accident in his Mexican hometown left his father paralyzed last 
year, Cesar Reyes, the eldest of nine children, decided to go to the United 
States. He planned to find a job and send money home. He was 17. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Vicente, 19, came to escape Salvadoran guerrillas who had taken him and 
his mother prisoners. They had come to their home in the middle of the night, 
like they had earlier for his father, he said. Jose Vicente was the only one to 
escape. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last several months in Los Angeles, Cesar and Jose have tried but 
failed most days to find work and have spent most nights on the streets. They 
are among hundreds, perhaps thousands, of young homeless immigrants sleeping in 
parks, under bridges and in abandoned buildings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Numbers Unprecedented 
</P>
<P>
The teen-age immigrants -- some as young as 12 and 14 -- are arriving in 
unprecedented numbers, according to experts who say more of them are arriving 
alone. Some come escaping the draft, others the escalating violence and poverty 
in their home countries. 
</P>
<P>
With no relatives or friends to receive them and confronted by U.S. laws that 
ban their employment, the youngsters often go hungry or depend on the kindness 
of strangers. 
</P>
<P>
The few religious and community groups that help teen-age immigrants say they 
are seeing about twice as many as a year ago. Some estimate that more than half 
the homeless teen-agers downtown are Latino immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
Some end up at Juvenile Hall and in the hands of immigration authorities. 
Otherwise, no government agency claims responsibility for the youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Department of Children's Protective Services used to 
offer assistance to those who asked to be sent home, but even that service has 
been discontinued. The Mexican Consulate says it is trying to pick up the slack 
and assists in the return of as many as 25 youngsters to Mexico each week. 
</P>
<P>
Those trying to help the youngsters who remain face a frustrating task: Not 
only are jobs scarcer than ever for illegal immigrants, but services for them 
are almost non-existent. 
</P>
<P>
"No one cares what happens to these kids," said Father Richard Estrada, 
associate pastor at Our Lady Queen of Angels Catholic Church, also known as La 
Placita. 
</P>
<P>
About a dozen youngsters turn up almost daily at the historic downtown church 
that has declared itself a sanctuary for refugees and immigrants. They are 
offered meals three days a week and are allowed to sleep on the floor of the 
church hall, where about 200 older immigrants bed down each night. 
</P>
<P>
"We counsel the kids to go home, especially the younger ones," Estrada said. 
"And we try to keep them from going bad." But it is a losing battle, he said, 
since "we have little to offer them." 
</P>
<P>
A few months ago Alfonso, 19, hooked up with two other teen-agers who guided 
him across the border. They were on their way back to Los Angeles after having 
been deported, and they led Alfonso to their former home -- MacArthur Park. 
(The young man asked that his real name not be used. To protect other 
youngsters in this story, most last names have been dropped.) 
</P>
<P>
The park scene startled Alfonso -- kids, younger than himself, strung out on 
drugs and selling in broad daylight. At night, they hopped into cars with 
Americanos who paid them up to $30 for sex. 
</P>
<P>
Once he got to know some of the youths at the park, Alfonso felt more at ease. 
"They're really all right," he said. But Alfonso remained sure of one thing: He 
would never use drugs nor end up like them. 
</P>
<P>
After about three weeks of failed attempts at finding a job, of going hungry 
and of sleeping under dirty blankets under a stairway with the others, Alfonso 
relented. 
</P>
<P>
Gathering all the macho moxie he could muster, Alfonso told himself, "A mi me 
vale!" -- a Mexican war cry akin to "The hell with it!" -- and got into one of 
the cars that cruise the park for boys. His bronzed, aquiline good looks made 
him popular on the corner. 
</P>
<P>
The park is in the heart of the predominantly Central American Pico-Union area 
and along with downtown has the highest concentration of young homeless 
immigrants, according to Anne Donahue, director of a Covenant House shelter 
program. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, Covenant House workers have been scouting Los Angeles streets 
at night for homeless teen-agers. The organization is preparing to open a 
100-bed shelter next year, Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been amazed by the high number of Latino kids on the streets," she said. 
"And we've barely scratched the surface." 
</P>
<P>
"There is an absolutely critical need for services for all homeless youngsters" 
-- including the immigrant youths who are generally younger and not always 
welcomed at shelters serving the general homeless teen-age population, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Jaime Flores, a community worker at El Rescate, a group in the Pico-Union 
district that assists Central American refugees, said that nearly half the 
refugees arriving from Guatemala and El Salvador these days are minors 
traveling alone or with other minors. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike previous waves of refugees, many of the youngsters are the first in 
their families to come. UCLA anthropologist James Loucky, who works in the 
Guatemalan community, said this has given rise to homelessness among Central 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something we're seeing for the first time," he said. "Even a year ago I 
didn't know of any Central American homeless." 
</P>
<P>
Loucky said the support network among the refugees has weakened over time as 
the communities have grown. 
</P>
<P>
"People (in the Guatemalan community) say that now there are people coming up 
who they don't know or who are maybe the kids of people they use to know back 
home. . . . Years have gone by, and there's not the same sense of obligation," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
It was nearly noon and Pedro Angel still had not eaten. He had risen at 5 a.m. 
with the other men at La Placita's church hall to go look for work at the 
day-labor pickup spots they frequent. Finding none, he returned to the church. 
He had nowhere else to go. 
</P>
<P>
A slender, sweet-faced, 16-year-old from Guatemala, Pedro Angel began working 
alongside his father on their small piece of land when he was 9 years old. "We 
are very poor," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His dream of making enough money here to send home has vanished over the last 
two months. "I'm sorry I ever came," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the youngsters walk the few blocks from La Placita to Skid Row missions 
for meals. Pedro Angel prefers to go hungry, he said. The place frightens him. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Pedro Angel, the vast majority of youngsters interviewed for this story 
expressed no intention of returning home -- not yet anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be embarrassing," said Alfonso, who still drops by the park to visit 
old friends although he has temporarily been taken in by a man who picked him 
up there. "They'd make fun of me back home." 
</P>
<P>
When the youngsters write or call home, they tell their parents they are doing 
fine. "We don't want to worry them," one teen-ager said, recalling his parent's 
reluctant consent when he left. 
</P>
<P>
"Besides, it's not as if we could ask our parents to send us money," said 
another, eliciting laughter from his friends. 
</P>
<P>
For others, however, the money is secondary. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard not knowing when I'll be able to return to my own country . . . or 
see my brothers and sisters," said Jose Vicente, the young Salvadoran whose 
parents were abducted by guerrillas. "There are times when I feel no joy about 
anything. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Jose, who was taken in by a couple after spending several weeks on the streets, 
said he has found only occasional work. He once got a steady job, he said, but 
the gardener who employed him refused to pay him after three weeks. "I didn't 
want any problems so I let it go," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jose seldom leaves the house these days. The labor pickup corner he used to go 
to was raided recently by immigration agents. The few jobs he finds in the 
newspaper require proof of legal status, and he has none. 
</P>
<P>
Those who work with the youths say that behind their tough and unkempt exterior 
they are "good kids" -- well-mannered and easy to work with. 
</P>
<P>
"They seem to be real tender hearted," said Daniel Loera, who serves as lay 
Catholic chaplain at Central Juvenile Hall. But when it comes to survival, they 
will do whatever it takes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Guerrero, a probation officer who keeps track of illegal immigrant 
youngsters at Juvenile Hall, said that about 25 of them are brought in each 
week -- twice as many as a year ago -- most of them for selling drugs, stealing 
and car burglaries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Return After Deportation 
</P>
<P>
Even after the youngsters are turned over to authorities for deportation, 
Guerrero said he often sees them again. In one case, a teen-age boy who was 
sent back across the border, re-entered the country illegally, was arrested on 
the streets of Los Angeles for selling drugs and was back in Juvenile Hall -- 
all within 24 hours, Guerrero said. 
</P>
<P>
"I see no way to stop them from coming," he said. "We should have some services 
for them while they're here." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the youngsters not only survive, but manage to flourish. 
</P>
<P>
Joaquin was 15 when he came to the United States. He had one goal in mind: 
"They say everything's better in the U.S., so I thought it would be better to 
get an education here." 
</P>
<P>
Over the last two years, Joaquin, a serious-minded young man with big plans, 
has attended three different high schools and worked when he could find a job. 
He has lived in half a dozen shelters, in abandoned buildings, and occasionally 
with friends, but the teen has seldom missed a day of school. He has maintained 
a 3.5 grade point average. He hopes to graduate with honors from Hollywood High 
next summer. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care what I have to go through to get what I want . . ., like an 
education," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Joaquin's determination has already paid off: He speaks English almost like a 
native. And he has been allowed to stay at shelters where he has seen other 
Spanish-speaking youngsters turned away. 
</P>
<P>
Joaquin recently lost an opportunity to attend advanced courses at UCLA because 
he cannot afford to pay for transportation. But a more immediate concern is 
where he will be spending the night. 
</P>
<P>
A few days ago, he was asked to leave the small shelter where he was staying. 
The six-bed shelter run by a Byzantine Rite Catholic priest is one of only a 
few small shelters specifically serving immigrant youth. At this shelter, 
temporary housing is offered to youngsters for a month at a time. Joaquin had 
stayed for two. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know where I will go next," he said. "I just hope that I'll find a 
stable place where I'll be able to study. . . . These are my last six months in 
school." 
</P>
<P>
The young man said he is applying for placement by the county in a foster home, 
but it is unlikely he will qualify. 
</P>
<P>
Spokeswomen for the county Department of Childrens Services said the agency is 
responsible only for "neglected or abused" children. 
</P>
<P>
"A child that just makes up his mind that he wants to leave home and come to 
the big city is not a case within our realm," said Barbara Calhoon, a 
supervisor in the department's international placement unit. She was referring 
to foster care and transportation to a youngster's home country. 
</P>
<P>
Up until last August, an average of 15 youngsters a month were sent home 
through the international unit. Now, only about two a month go, she said. The 
change reflects a stricter interpretation of departmental policy. 
</P>
<P>
Sister Kathy Wood, a Franciscan nun who offers morning meals to homeless 
immigrants on Skid Row, is disappointed by the lack of government help. No 
matter how you look at it, she insisted, "downtown is no place for children to 
be on the street. It doesn't matter what country they were born in." 
</P>
<P>
If there is no alternative and a youngster's well-being is at stake, the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service might send the youngster home, said 
Robert Moschorak, associate INS Western Region commissioner for operations. 
"But we're not interested in providing free trips to home countries," he said, 
adding that in his 24 years with the agency he has yet to see a minor turn 
himself in. 
</P>
<P>
INS officials said they seldom apprehend minors in the interior, where their 
enforcement focus is the workplace. Those caught at the border are sent home 
"voluntarily." Many of the Central Americans, however, refuse to return 
voluntarily. About 2,000 minors are held by the INS each year, and the 
overwhelming majority of them are apprehended in Southern California, according 
to research of INS records by the National Center for Immigrants Rights Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Although overall apprehensions at the border are down from previous years, 
Christine Davis, an INS official responsible for detention and deportation, 
said she has detected "a slight increase in the number of Central American 
unaccompanied minors, primarily young boys." 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles-based National Center for Immigrants Rights, which has 
litigated numerous class action suits on behalf of immigrants, plans to open a 
multi-service center and small shelter for homeless youngsters next spring to 
assist those released from custody. The center has begun recruiting families 
willing to offer temporary shelter to the youngsters, as well as lawyers 
willing to assist with their cases. 
</P>
<P>
Despite such efforts, however, the needs of the young immigrants far outstrip 
available services. 
</P>
<P>
Brother Joseph McLachlan of the Missionaries of Charity -- a Catholic order 
founded by Nobel laureate Mother Teresa of Calcutta -- sees as many as 60 
immigrant teen-agers a day at a small shelter he operates in the Pico-Union 
area. They drop in at the homey, two-story house for a shower, a free meal and 
clean clothes. Some just come to rest from their nights on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Brother Joseph said he never has enough to offer them. And he has nowhere to 
send those who ask for help in kicking a drug habit. He has been told by 
government-funded drug rehabilitation programs that the young men do not 
qualify. 
</P>
<P>
The hardest part for Brother Joseph comes at the end of the day, however, when 
he closes the door behind them. There is room only for eight to spend the 
night. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very difficult to let them out, especially the young ones, knowing the 
difficulties and danger they face sleeping in the streets," he said. "All I can 
say is . . . 'Take care of yourself.' "

BUNDY IS ELECTROCUTED AS CROWD OF 500 CHEERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ted Bundy, the notorious serial killer, died Tuesday in the electric chair, 
just as the sun rose over the north Florida plains. 
</P>
<P>
Gone was the storied cockiness. He was ashen as two guards led him into the 
death chamber. They strapped his chest and arms and legs against the shiny 
wooden chair. 
</P>
<P>
Bundy's blue eyes searched the faces behind the glass. He nodded to some of the 
42 witnesses, including the men who had prosecuted him. His lips bounced with a 
faint mumble. 
</P>
<P>
Then his head bowed. The shaved skull glistened where an ointment had been 
applied. It would facilitate the work of the electrodes. 
</P>
<P>
Prison Supt. Tom Barton asked Bundy if he had any last words. The killer 
hesitated. His voice quavered. "Jim and Fred, I'd like you to give my love to 
my family and friends," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Coleman, one of his lawyers, nodded. So did Fred Lawrence of Gainesville, 
Fla., the Methodist minister who had spent the night with Bundy in a vigil of 
weeping and prayer. 
</P>
<P>
With that, it was time. The last thick strap was pulled across Bundy's mouth 
and chin. The metal skullcap was bolted in place, its heavy black veil falling 
in front of the condemned man's face. 
</P>
<P>
Barton gave the go-ahead. An anonymous executioner pushed the button. Two 
thousand volts surged through the wires. Bundy's body tensed and his hands 
tightened into a clench. 
</P>
<P>
A minute later, the machine was shut down, and the body went limp. A paramedic 
unbuttoned Bundy's blue shirt and listened for a heartbeat. A doctor aimed a 
light into his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
At 7:16 a.m., Theodore Robert Bundy -- one of the worst serial killers of all 
time -- was pronounced dead. 
</P>
<P>
A witnessing newsman raised his hands in a signal as he left the Q Wing of 
Florida State Prison. 
</P>
<P>
Across the street, along the dewy grass of a cow pasture, word spread among the 
500 or so who had come to be near -- and almost all to cheer -- the death work. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crowd Chants, 'Burn' 
</P>
<P>
Some began chanting, "Burn, Bundy, burn!" Others sang or hugged one another or 
banged on frying pans. 
</P>
<P>
Fireworks kicked into the sky. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I could have been the one flipping the switch," said David Hoar, a 
policeman from St. Augustine, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Rands, one of the many college students present, whooped: "Thank God it's 
Fry-Day!" He had been fascinated by the Bundy case since studying it in his 
ninth-grade civics class. 
</P>
<P>
In a few moments, the witnesses began strolling about the field. They were a 
somber bunch, and a few were shocked by the celebration that filled the chilly 
morning air. 
</P>
<P>
"Regardless of what Bundy did, he was still a human being," said Jim Sewell, 
the police chief of Gulfport, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
But even Sewell, leaden from the sight of an electrocution, said he felt a 
great relief that Bundy was dead. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time I ever saw him when he wasn't really in control," said 
Sewell, who had been an investigator in three Bundy murders. "Ted was wily and 
street-smart and understood the system." 
</P>
<P>
Bundy, 42, was convicted only of three Florida murders, although he was long 
blamed for dozens more in Washington state, Oregon, Colorado and Utah. 
</P>
<P>
Technically, he died for the 1978 murder of 12-year-old Kimberly Leach of Lake 
City, whom he left dead under a collapsed hog shed. 
</P>
<P>
George Robert Dekle prosecuted that case -- and Tuesday he witnessed Bundy's 
death: 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that kept going through my mind was the awful crime scene I saw 11 
years ago. I kept saying to myself that is where it started and this is where 
it ends." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Feels No Compassion 
</P>
<P>
Florida State Trooper Ken Robinson, another witness, said: "I felt no 
compassion for Bundy whatsoever. He had an easier death than any of his 
victims." 
</P>
<P>
Bundy was also under sentence of death for what were known here as the Chi 
Omega murders, a gruesome rampage through the bedrooms of a sorority house at 
Florida State University. 
</P>
<P>
Those two bludgeoning deaths -- and the murder of the Leach girl three weeks 
later -- were Bundy's final killings. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after, he was caught by a patrolman in Pensacola, Fla. Bundy tried to run, 
but he slipped and fell in some sand. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since, his notoriety has multiplied. The Chi Omega trial was televised 
nationally. Five books about Bundy were written. A TV movie was made. 
</P>
<P>
He was a mass killer who on the surface seemed among America's finest young 
men: likable, intelligent, patrician-looking. 
</P>
<P>
He had been a Boy Scout and a college graduate and a law student. He was a 
rising Young Republican in Washington state party politics. 
</P>
<P>
That the boy next door yearned to kill the girls next door -- preferably ones 
with long hair parted down the middle -- made him seem both ironic and demonic, 
devilishly handsome and fiendishly clever. 
</P>
<P>
And there was a great mystery. How many had he really murdered? 
</P>
<P>
Investigators could only speculate until the last few days, when Bundy opened 
up with a bloody stream of confessions. He gave the details to as many as 50 
murders in nine states -- information that will take months to sort out. 
</P>
<P>
And one more thing: He said he was sorry. 
</P>
<P>
Five hours before his execution, Bundy was allowed to make two brief phone 
calls to his mother, Louise, in Tacoma, Wash. He told her of his regrets, that 
he was really two people -- the Ted she knew and the mutant Ted she did not. 
</P>
<P>
"He said: 'I'm so sorry I've given you all such grief . . . but a part of me 
was hidden all the time,' " Louise Bundy said. 
</P>
<P>
She told her boy: "You'll always be my precious son." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Had Stuttering Problem 
</P>
<P>
The son was illegitimate, conceived in Philadelphia. Later, Louise Cowell moved 
to Washington and married Johnnie Bundy, a hospital cook. They would never 
suspect that young Ted had problems far beyond his nail-biting and stuttering. 
</P>
<P>
But, for a decade, Ted Bundy was the glib and engaging young fellow who picked 
up women at parks, shopping malls and college campuses -- and then killed them. 
Sometimes, he posed as a fire examiner or a man with a broken arm. He had the 
gifts of a lady's man. 
</P>
<P>
Most often, he drove off for hundreds of miles with his dead or unconscious 
victims. He dumped them in remote forests. Most had been raped and mutilated. 
He left them for the animals or his own return visits. 
</P>
<P>
To the parents of some of the victims -- their daughters' deaths now 
acknowledged by Bundy -- his execution brings pitifully little solace. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not important to me now," said Robert Campbell of Dearborn, Mich., father 
of Caryn. "The thing I'd like to have back, I can't get back." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Vivian Raincourt of La Conner, Wash., sat up all night 
awaiting word that, at last, retribution had been taken for her daughter Susan. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hoping that this will never happen again, this terrible wait (for an 
execution)," she said. "We won't have to hear any more stories of how he played 
the system . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Bundy was on Death Row for nearly 10 years -- and he became a symbol for how 
long it takes to push a capital case to its resolution. Monday night, his 
lawyers were still trying to delay the execution, filing three separate appeals 
with the U.S. Supreme Court. However, by votes of 5 to 4, 7 to 2 and 6 to 3, 
the justices rejected all of the pleas. 
</P>
<P>
"We're tired of feeding that killer with our tax money," said Dorothy Solomons, 
one of the many who came to stand across from the prison. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, execution in this case was far more costly than lifetime 
incarceration. Bundy's lengthy prosecution, including the appeals, cost the 
state an estimated $5 million. Thirty years of jail time would cost about a 
fifth of that. 
</P>
<P>
Once convicted, Bundy seemed to taunt the system. He twice escaped from 
Colorado prisons while awaiting a murder trial there. 
</P>
<P>
He showboated in Florida, reneging on a deal for a life sentence in the Chi 
Omega case and then castigating his lawyers in open court. He often acted as 
his own counsel. Rapt groupies thought he was cute. 
</P>
<P>
In the subsequent Leach trial, he put his girlfriend, Carole Ann Boone, on the 
witness stand. 
</P>
<P>
"Will you marry me?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," she replied. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I do hereby marry you." 
</P>
<P>
Thus, with a notary present in the gallery, they were wed under Florida law. 
</P>
<P>
Bundy boasted that the romance produced a daughter, conceived during a prison 
visit. The couple ultimately became estranged. 
</P>
<P>
"He was such a manipulator," said Sewell, who had worked on the Bundy cases. 
"We'll never have a full understanding of who he was and why he did things." 
</P>
<P>
Many insist he was insane. That he was never ruled so may have to do with his 
steely and cagey exterior, as well as the law's difficulty in discerning 
criminal insanity in compulsive brutality. 
</P>
<P>
Oddly, until his last-gasp appeals, insanity was the one legal argument Bundy 
would never permit. He always feared the issue of his mental competence more 
than that of his crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the murderous urges swelled within him and dominated his life. The bright 
student of psychology grappled with his own dark instincts -- and the torment 
of alternating periods of reform and relapse. 
</P>
<P>
In a remarkable series of prison interviews years ago with journalists Hugh 
Aynesworth and Stephen Michaud, Bundy agreed to "speculate" on what "might" 
have driven the killer in the crimes in which he was a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
"What really fascinated him was the hunt, the adventure of searching out his 
victim," Bundy said. "And, to a degree, possessing them physically as one would 
possess a potted plant, a painting or a Porsche. Owning, as it were, this 
individual." 
</P>
<P>
No matter how hard he tried, this hypothetical killer could never fully 
extinguish his desires to rape and murder. Instead he rationalized. 
</P>
<P>
"He would cling to the belief that there would be virtually no furor over it . 
. . " Bundy said. "I mean, there are so many people. 
</P>
<P>
"It shouldn't be a problem. What's one less person on the face of the earth, 
anyway?" 
</P>

Yisroel Soloveichik, the 12-year-old boy who was the subject of a legal battle 
between his mother and father over his medical care, died of brain cancer at 
Rush-Presbyterian St. Luke's Medical Center in Chicago. Yisroel's death came 
the same day his parents had returned to court to continue their argument over 
treatment of the boy. Cook County Circuit Judge Thomas O'Brien last Thursday 
ruled that the boy's mother, Miriam Soloveichik, would make all decisions 
regarding her son's medical care. She had sought to avoid further surgery on 
the boy in his dying days. Yisroel's father, Moshe Soloveichik, an Orthodox 
Jewish rabbi, wanted to do everything possible to keep his son alive.

DELAY IN SALE OF BONDS DENIED

State Finance Director Jesse R. Huff disputed a published report that the 
Deukmejian Administration has postponed selling more than $4 billion in newly 
approved bond issues, insisting that bond sales are "proceeding on schedule." 
"We are not delaying any bond sales. We are not stopping any projects for which 
voters approved bonds," Huff said. Manuel M. Mateo, chief of the trust services 
division in the treasurer's office, agreed. "We will sell bonds just as fast as 
we legally can," he said. The Sacramento Bee reported that $4 billion in bonds 
approved by voters last year are being delayed because the state would not have 
enough money to make the principal or interest payments.

AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland disclosed that he would run for a sixth term as 
leader of the 14.1-million-member federation at its convention this November. 
In recent weeks, there had been rumors he would step down. But at a press 
briefing at the federation's Washington headquarters, Kirkland stated 
categorically that he would run again. Kirkland, 66, was first elected 
president in 1979. It is unlikely that Kirkland will face any significant 
opposition. During the meeting with reporters, Kirkland, a member of the 
deficit-fighting National Economic Commission, said the prospects of a unified 
report are doubtful. He said the panel was hobbled by a lack of commitment from 
President Bush and, to a lesser degree, from congressional leaders that the 
panel's work would be seriously considered.

The Rev. Jesse Jackson gave his long-awaited endorsement to black Acting Mayor 
Eugene Sawyer in the Feb. 28 Chicago primary and urged voters to defeat a 
challenge from the son of the "Boss" who ran Chicago for two decades. "I choose 
to stand with this rainbow coalition of political and community leaders and 
endorse Mayor Eugene Sawyer for reelection," Jackson said as the South Side 
crowd chanted "Sawyer! Sawyer! Sawyer!" The former Democratic presidential 
candidate said Cook County State's Atty. Richard M. Daley -- son of legendary 
Mayor Richard J. Daley, who became known as the "Boss" of Chicago politics -- 
must be defeated at all cost. Jackson stopped short of saying whether he would 
continue to support Sawyer in the general election on April 4, should Sawyer 
defeat Daley and face another black, Alderman Timothy Evans.

The government of the Netherlands said it is planning to release the last two 
surviving Nazi war criminals imprisoned in the West immediately after World War 
II. Franz Fischer, 87, a sergeant-major in the Nazi SS (elite force), and 
Ferdinand aus der Fuenten, 80, a captain in the SS, were found guilty in 1949 
of rounding up and deporting at least 13,000 Jews from The Hague and Amsterdam 
to concentration camps. The two former Nazis were condemned to death, but their 
sentences were later commuted to life imprisonment. In a letter to Parliament, 
Dutch Justice Minister Frederik Korthals Altes said it makes "no sense" to keep 
the two men in prison any longer.

A stewardess and three skiers aboard a Soviet airliner foiled a hijack attempt 
by a man who threatened to set the plane on fire unless he was flown abroad, 
the newspaper Vozdushny Transport reported. The would-be hijacker approached 
the stewardess holding a cigarette lighter in one hand and in the other a fuse 
wired to a suitcase that police later discovered contained gasoline, the 
newspaper of the Civil Aviation Ministry said. The stewardess gave the man a 
push, then summoned help from the passenger cabin. Three skiers overcame the 
man and tied him up while the pilot aborted the takeoff, the newspaper said.

Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin is reportedly considering new measures 
to stop the 13-month Palestinian uprising, including blocking Arabs suspected 
of taking part in riots from entering Israel to work. Jobs in Israel are the 
main source of income for an estimated 100,000 people in the occupied West Bank 
and Gaza Strip. Rabin called the work a "privilege, not a right." Meanwhile, 
Israeli soldiers killed a Palestinian teen-ager in a pre-dawn raid, and 
security agents arrested dozens of Arabs suspected of belonging to the 
underground Palestinian Popular Army. Israel Radio said the group is led by the 
Fatah faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization.

1988 RUSTLING TALLY IS 2,400

More than 2,400 head of cattle worth more than $1 million were taken by 
rustlers in California during 1988, according to the state Department of Food 
and Agriculture. Stolen or missing cattle were reported by about 250 ranchers, 
but a department investigator said that many thefts go unreported and that the 
actual loss might be double the recorded figure. The rising price of beef may 
trigger an increase in rustling this year, industry officials said. Del 
Fletcher, head investigator for the department's livestock enforcement unit, 
said rural drug addicts are stealing cows and selling the beef to support their 
habits.

ASSEMBLY PANEL DELAYS VOTE ON PREMIUM FREEZE

Under threat of a legal challenge, an Assembly committee on Tuesday delayed a 
vote on legislation intended to freeze insurance premiums until the state 
Supreme Court rules on the constitutionality of Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Patrick Johnston (D-Stockton), who chairs the Finance and Insurance 
Committee, agreed to put off the vote for one week after it became apparent 
that the absence of several Democrats and a strong assault by the insurance 
industry -- including the threat of a lawsuit -- had eroded support for his 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston said the delay would give him time to consider ways of resolving 
concerns expressed by insurance lobbyists that a freeze on premiums would 
unconstitutionally deprive the industry of a reasonable profit. 
</P>
<P>
"A legislative freeze is highly dubious constitutionally," warned former 
Assemblyman Alister McAlister, who once chaired the committee and now lobbies 
on behalf of the insurance industry. "It may make you feel good doing it. But 
it will be challenged, I guarantee it." 
</P>
<P>
The bill was intended to close a loophole created by the state Supreme Court's 
decision to stay portions of the successful November ballot initiative, 
including a provision requiring a 20% rate rollback for most lines of 
insurance. The stay apparently gave insurers the right to not only maintain 
their current rates but to raise them virtually without restriction while the 
battle over Proposition 103 is waged before the high court. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston drafted his bill after several insurance companies sought to take 
advantage of the stay on Proposition 103 by raising premiums. Others, such as 
the California State Automobile Assn., had changed their rate structures before 
voters approved the initiative but held back many of the actual premium 
increases until this year. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the legislation would bar insurance companies from boosting rates 
above what they charged on Election Day, Nov. 8, 1988. Companies that did raise 
rates would be required to refund the excess within 90 days or reduce 
policyholders' future payments. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation also would require insurers that canceled or refused to renew 
policies to offer coverage to their former policyholders. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston told the panel that if it did not act, "we would be victimizing the 
public with significant rate increases." 
</P>
<P>
The lobbyists -- the only witnesses who testified before the committee -- 
countered that it is unfair to keep a lid on premiums when there is a good 
chance that the Supreme Court eventually will rule that the rollbacks and 
restrictions on rates are unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
"You will be locking many companies into the situation where they not only 
don't have a fair return on their investments but they will lose large sums of 
money," said State Farm lobbyist Gene Livingston. 
</P>
<P>
Some critics of Johnston's bill said they believe that Insurance Commissioner 
Roxani Gillespie already has the power to keep rates in check, so there is no 
reason for the Legislature to act before the Supreme Court rules. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie, however, disagreed. "A (rate) freeze cannot be achieved by the 
department," she told reporters. "Unless the rate can be termed to be excessive 
. . . I can do nothing." 
</P>
<P>
The insurance commissioner, who in recent weeks has been accused by lawmakers 
of dragging her feet in acting against insurers that violate the law, struck 
back Tuesday, saying: "Too many cooks spoil the broth. The Legislature is 
better off legislating. If they are going to make comments about the executive 
(branch), they had better do their homework first." 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, a coalition of organizations representing the poor, 
Latinos and consumers met with Gillespie on Tuesday to promote a plan for a 
state-run system of no-fault car insurance. The proposal, according to these 
groups, is aimed at an estimated 6 million California drivers who are uninsured 
and who would be able to purchase coverage under the plan for as little as $200 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
Under the no-fault concept, motorists are compensated for injuries by their own 
insurance companies no matter who is at fault. The plan offered Tuesday would 
provide minimum coverage and allow others desiring higher levels of protection 
to purchase additional insurance. 
</P>
<P>
"Proposition 103 is a good idea; however, it ignores the needs of low- and 
modest-income families," George Dean, president of the California Council of 
Urban Leagues, told reporters after the meeting with Gillespie. "Every 
Californian, not just the affluent, should have affordable basic insurance."

VAN DE KAMP OKS 'GENETIC FINGERPRINT' USE IN TRIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Court trial use by California prosecutors of a new genetic code technique for 
linking suspects to sexual attacks and other crimes was approved Tuesday by 
state Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp because of growing enthusiasm on the part 
of scientists and criminalists. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called "genetic fingerprinting" system uses samples of blood, semen or 
body tissue to establish an individual's genetic code or DNA pattern. 
</P>
<P>
Theoretically, Van de Kamp said, "the odds against two people having the same 
DNA structure are 30 billion to 1." 
</P>
<P>
Although Van de Kamp had insisted that California take a go-slow approach, the 
technique has already been accepted by courts in several other states, where 
many investigators consider it more helpful than actual fingerprints in tracing 
criminals. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp announced his approval of the new tool Tuesday in a speech to the 
California District Attorneys Assn. meeting in Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
Invented in England in 1985, genetic fingerprinting involves extracting the 
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), which serves as a blueprint for all living 
organisms, from a specimen of blood, semen or tissue, then chemically chopping 
the DNA into short fragments. The fragments are separated by a technique called 
electrophoresis to form an identity profile. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp said two California cases involving DNA evidence are "ready to go." 
One is that of a serial rapist in Orange County, and the other is a murder case 
in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
"Once this technology is admitted in court," Van de Kamp said, "we must quickly 
make it available to prosecutors and investigators around the state." 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp said that a year ago, he wanted to wait to make certain that 
genetic code evidence would stand up in court. 
</P>
<P>
He said Tuesday that he and his DNA Advisory Board were at last persuaded by 
the successful use of genetic code evidence in cases around the country, as 
well as by the satisfaction of the California Bureau of Forensic Services, with 
the results shown by private laboratories doing such work in the state. 
</P>
<P>
"From my standpoint," Van de Kamp said, "I am most pleased that our people kept 
their shirts on and waited until we were ready, until our own DNA experts were 
ready to go." 
</P>
<P>
California's use of the technique, the attorney general said, "is going to be 
done carefully and with a lot of thought." 
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Van de Kamp said, "One year ago this month, I stood before a 
room full of police and prosecutors who were eager to use DNA technology to 
convict murderers, rapists and other violent criminals. They were waiting for a 
green light. But I had to give them a stop sign instead." 
</P>
<P>
He told his audience that he knew last January that "if we rushed to trial with 
DNA-typing evidence, only to have it thrown out of court, we could lose this 
revolutionary new tool for years to come. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'New Era' 
</P>
<P>
But now, said Van de Kamp, "a new era of crime fighting will begin in 
California . . . I am ready to announce that DNA is ready to go to court and 
ready to win." 
</P>
<P>
He said DNA analysis "may be the strongest form of evidence there is for 
identifying criminals -- especially in cases of sexual assault." 
</P>
<P>
Genetic fingerprinting already has been used to obtain convictions in several 
cases where no other evidence was available. On the basis of such evidence, 
Alan J. Haynes, 35, was convicted in 1987 of raping a 57-year-old Alzheimer's 
victim in Tacoma, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
Genetic fingerprinting was also the key evidence in the rape conviction of 
Tommy Lee Andrews, 25, in Orlando, Fla., early last year. 
</P>
<P>
Last October, 46-year-old Victor Lopez was convicted of sexual attacks on three 
women after the first New York state trial in which a defendant was linked to 
the crime through an analysis of his own genetic material. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County prosecutors expect to go to trial in March in a murder case 
against Lynda Axel, who was allegedly linked to the crime through DNA analysis 
of 60 human hairs at the death scene. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Harris, charged with 63 counts of rape, faces a June trial in Orange 
County based on DNA matching. 
</P>
<P>
With genetic fingerprinting kits now available commercially, authorities say, 
the odds that such patterns from two individuals will be identical are 
typically about 1 in 10 million -- far shorter than the "theoretic" odds cited 
by Van de Kamp. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, the odds that conventional fingerprints from two individuals 
will be identical are about 1 in 64 billion, but such fingerprints are not 
always clear or available. Van de Kamp said the latter give "a much weaker 
identification." 
</P>
<P>
The attorney general said his office will set up regional laboratories to 
perform genetic tests after he obtains financing from the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that the DNA code for every registered sex offender in the state could 
be kept in data bases and matched against codes found at crime scenes. 
</P>
<P>
The technique, he said, can also be valuable in helping to clear the innocent.

FBI INVESTIGATES KILLING OF 2 MEXICAN CITIZENS BY BORDER UNIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The FBI has launched an inquiry into the deaths of two Mexican citizens who 
were shot earlier this month by members of a special anti-crime squad 
consisting of San Diego policemen and U.S. Border Patrol officers. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Watkins, an FBI spokesman in San Diego, confirmed that the agency had 
begun a preliminary inquiry into possible civil rights violations in connection 
with the shootings, which have focused public scrutiny on the operations of the 
Border Crime Prevention Unit. 
</P>
<P>
The city-federal unit is dedicated to reducing crime against the hundreds of 
thousands of illegal aliens who enter the United States each year from Tijuana, 
often crossing treacherous canyons frequented by bandits. 
</P>
<P>
Some critics have charged that the unit's violent record -- members have shot 
44 people, killing 18, during its five years of existence -- renders the 
protectors more hazardous to border-crossers than the thieves. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego County district attorney's office, which reviews shootings by law 
enforcement officers, has ruled that each shooting by the unit that it has 
investigated to date has been justified. Authorities could recall no other 
recent case in which the FBI investigated a shooting by unit officers. 
</P>
<P>
Marco E. Lopez, a San Diego attorney who represents the families of the two men 
killed in the most recent incident, has charged that witnesses saw both men 
being shot from behind as they were fleeing back to Mexico in handcuffs. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego police reject his version of the shooting, contending that the two 
were gunned down as they attempted to rob members of the anti-crime unit. A 
police official said they were handcuffed as a precaution after they had been 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney said the men were guides, not robbers. 
</P>
<P>
The family of each man has announced its intention to file a $15-million civil 
claim against the U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
The two men were among a group of four armed with a machete and three 
screwdrivers, police said. Unit officers generally carry two weapons each, 
usually including semiautomatic 9-millimeter handguns and at least one shotgun 
per team. A Tijuana pathologist's report indicates that both men were shot from 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
The Mexican Embassy in Washington, citing the apparent "disproportionate (and) 
unnecessary violence," sent a note to the State Department formally requesting 
a thorough investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The border anti-crime unit has been largely inactive since the most recent 
shooting, which occurred Jan. 4, but police officials have said they plan to 
redeploy the officers shortly. Members are volunteers who serve four-month 
shifts, officials say.

DNA TYPING TO DEBUT IN STATE CRIMINAL CASES THIS WINTER

The use of a genetic code technique involving DNA typing that investigators may 
find more helpful than fingerprints in tracing crime suspects was approved 
Tuesday by California Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp. 
</P>
<P>
"I am happy to announce that DNA is ready to go to court, and ready to win," 
Van de Kamp told a meeting here of the California District Attorneys Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Already accepted by courts in 13 other states, the technique will be used for 
the first time in California courts later this winter in Orange and Ventura 
counties, Van de Kamp said. 
</P>
<P>
The new tool is similar to the fingerprint comparison method used for nearly a 
century, in which the prints of suspects are matched with those left by 
criminals at the crime scene. 
</P>
<P>
In the newer technique, Van de Kamp said, laboratory experts can use samples of 
hair, blood, semen or skin left by a criminal to find his genetic code. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists find the code, which looks like the bar code on supermarket 
merchandise, by unraveling the compound of deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, which 
is in every cell of the body. 
</P>
<P>
Once a code is found at a crime scene, investigators can compare it to the 
genetic code of a suspect, he said. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the DNA code for every registered sex offender in California could 
be recorded in a statewide data base, and matched by computer with codes found 
at the scene of any sexual attack. 
</P>
<P>
"DNA analysis may be the strongest form of evidence there is for identifying 
criminals -- especially in cases of sexual assault," Van de Kamp said. "And, 
theoretically, the odds against two people having the same DNA structure are 30 
billion to one. By comparison, fingerprinting gives a much weaker 
identification." 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp also noted that DNA typing would benefit the falsely accused. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney general gave the go-ahead for the technique one year after saying 
that more time was needed to make sure evidence based on genetic codes could 
stand up in court. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, he said, a DNA Advisory Committee with people from the FBI and 
local law enforcement endorsed the technology for court evidence. The panel was 
persuaded, in part, by the accuracy of 150 matches using the genetic code. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County prosecutors expect to go to trial in March in a murder case 
against Lynda Axel, who was allegedly linked to the crime through DNA analysis 
of 60 human hairs at the death scene. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Harris, charged with 63 counts of rape, faces a June trial in Orange 
County based on DNA matching. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, a new era of crime-fighting will begin in California," Van de Kamp told 
the prosecutors. "Once this technology is admitted in court, we must quickly 
make it available to prosecutors and investigators around the state." 
</P>
<P>
The attorney general said his office will set up a system of up to five 
regional laboratories to perform the genetic tests after he obtains financing 
through the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you will be seeing this being used more and more by district attorneys 
throughout the state," Van de Kamp said. 
</P>
<P>
But he told the prosecutors to be cautious and to "take it slow." 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest worry I have . . . is that someone would rush into court 
unprepared and it would be overturned," he said.

3RD CABINET MEMBER QUITS IN JAPANESE STOCK SCANDAL 
</P>

<P>
Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita's Cabinet suffered another shock in Japan's 
widening Recruit stock scandal Tuesday with the resignation of the third 
minister since the beginning of last month. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Harada, director general of the Economic Planning Agency, resigned after 
admitting he had received political donations from Recruit Co., the firm at the 
center of the stock-trading and alleged influence-peddling scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Harada, 69, told reporters in a televised news conference he did not think he 
had done anything wrong in accepting the payments but decided to resign to 
avoid controversy when the government submits its new budget for debate in 
Parliament in early February. The Cabinet approved the fiscal 1989 budget 
Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
Harada's resignation followed that of former Justice Minister Takashi Hasegawa, 
who assumed his post in a Cabinet reshuffle Dec. 27 but resigned three days 
later amid disclosures that he received donations from Recruit. 
</P>
<P>
Kiichi Miyazawa, finance minister and one of the leaders in the ruling Liberal 
Democratic Party, resigned Dec. 9 to take responsibility for his connection to 
questionable trading in the shares of a Recruit subsidiary, Recruit Cosmos Co. 
Miyazawa, Takeshita and scores of other leading politicians, bureaucrats and 
businessmen benefited from privileged trading in unlisted shares of Recruit 
Cosmos, a booming real estate developer. 
</P>
<P>
The scandal has sparked a criminal investigation and seriously eroded public 
confidence in the Takeshita administration. 
</P>
<P>
Takeshita has shown little sign of caving in to pressure, despite his own 
admission that a former aide and one of his relatives made substantial profits 
trading in Recruit Cosmos. 
</P>
<P>
Harada admitted that one of his political support groups had received small 
donations from Recruit for more than 10 years until November. News reports said 
he also accepted an $8,000 payment from the company in September. 
</P>
<P>
He denied granting any favors to Recruit, however, and said the donations were 
all within legal limits and properly reported. 
</P>
<P>
Takeshita moved quickly to replace Harada in the Economic Planning Agency with 
Koichiro Aino, 60, a bus company executive and six-term member of the lower 
house of Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
The budget approved by the Cabinet on Tuesday is approximately the same 
document proposed by the Finance Ministry last Thursday, with minor adjustments 
for foreign aid and defense. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of a 5.9% increase, it would raise foreign aid by 7.8% to $6 billion. 
With other amounts not covered in the general accounts budget, Japan's foreign 
aid is expected to exceed $10 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Defense outlays were raised by 5.9% instead of the 5.2% increase originally 
proposed.

U.S. DECRIES SOVIET AIR ATTACKS IN AFGHANISTAN; 
</P>
<P>
CALLS BOMBING AN 'UNACCEPTABLE' VIOLATION OF PLEDGE OF NO OFFENSIVE MOVES 
DURING PULLOUT

<P>
The U.S. government said Tuesday that the Soviet Union is conducting daily 
bombing attacks in Afghanistan, an "unacceptable" violation of Moscow's promise 
not to engage in offensive military operations during its troop withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Charles Redman said Soviet warplanes, based both in 
Afghanistan and across the border in the Soviet Union, are bombing targets 
"around the cities of Kandahar, Jalalabad and Kunduz." He said there are no 
Soviet troops still garrisoned around any of the three cities, so the attacks 
are not required for the safe evacuation of Soviet armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a clear violation of Soviet assurances to us not to engage in 
offensive operations during the withdrawal," Redman said. "This daily 
bombardment is unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
Under the Geneva accords signed last year, the Soviet Union is required to 
complete the withdrawal of its forces by Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Urges Americans to Leave 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater urged all Americans, 
except employees of the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, to leave Afghanistan because of 
the deteriorating security situation in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow radio said the Islamic guerrillas seeking to topple the Soviet-backed 
government in Kabul have blocked the main road between the Afghan capital and 
the Soviet border, requiring a Soviet airlift to provide food and other needed 
supplies to the city. 
</P>
<P>
Kabul is suffering severe food and fuel shortages, news agencies reported. 
Diplomats in the Afghan capital were quoted as saying people must wait in line 
for hours for bread and cooking fuel. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of fierce fighting with the extremists in the Salang Pass area, the 
country's main highway linking Kabul with . . . the Soviet border is once again 
paralyzed," Moscow Radio reported. "The armed opposition is preventing the 
normal supply of foodstuffs to the city." 
</P>
<P>
Redman said, however, that the rebels, known as the moujahedeen, have stopped 
attacking the withdrawing Soviet forces, apparently to eliminate any excuse for 
Moscow to delay its withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
"The moujahedeen have been exercising restraint in permitting unhampered Soviet 
withdrawal from Afghanistan," Redman said. "We believe that similar restraint 
would be appropriate on the part of the Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government first accused Moscow of conducting air attacks in violation 
of the Geneva accords late last year. At that time, however, the moujahedeen 
were engaged in hit-and-run attacks on the withdrawing Soviet troops. Redman 
raised the issue again Tuesday to underline the American position. 
</P>
<P>
Michael H. Armacost, acting secretary of state, raised the Afghan issue with 
Soviet Ambassador Yuri V. Dubinin during a meeting at the State Department on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union has maintained that its operations are in response to attacks 
by the moujahedeen on the Soviet-backed Kabul regime and, as such, are not 
prohibited by the Geneva accords. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Kabul Combat Reduced 
</P>
<P>
Western diplomats in Islamabad, Pakistan, quoted by United Press International, 
confirmed that the rebels are maintaining a low profile to allow the remainder 
of the Soviet soldiers to leave the country. 
</P>
<P>
The envoys said that combat around Kabul has decreased in recent weeks. 
However, diplomatic missions in the capital are making plans for a speedy 
evacuation in case security breaks down after the departure of the Soviet 
troops. 
</P>
<P>
The West German Embassy closed down last week. A Western diplomat said three 
Eastern European embassies are also preparing to close. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
U.S. Embassy to Stay Open 
</P>
<P>
Redman said the U.S. Embassy will remain open despite the Bush Administration's 
warning to American civilians to leave the country. 
</P>
<P>
"Our people have reason for being there," he said. But he added, "We're 
monitoring the situation closely" and could order an evacuation if conditions 
deteriorate. News agency accounts from Islamabad said Britain and the United 
States were preparing contingency plans for getting their diplomats out. 
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press reported from Kabul that most Americans and other citizens 
of Western nations have said they plan to leave the country as soon as 
possible.

SALVADOR REJECTS REBEL ELECTION PROPOSAL; 
</P>
<P>
GOVERNMENT REFUSES TO DELAY VOTING BUT WILL STUDY PEACE PLAN

<P>
Government officials of El Salvador on Tuesday rejected as "unconstitutional" a 
key demand by the country's Marxist guerrillas for a six-month postponement of 
an upcoming presidential election as a condition for rebel participation in the 
balloting and their acceptance of its results. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, Communications Minister Roberto Viera told reporters 
that a 12-point proposal by the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front 
(FMLN) disclosed Monday contains "positive elements" that will be studied point 
by point and answered in detail. 
</P>
<P>
This view was echoed by Fidel Chavez Mena, the presidential candidate of the 
governing Christian Democratic Party and a close adviser to President Jose 
Napoleon Duarte. 
</P>
<P>
The major elements of the rebel proposal call for the government and the 
military to: 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Cease assassinations, arrests and repression." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Agree to reorganize the electoral process. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Respect the candidacy of the Democratic Convergence, a leftist political 
grouping that is running in the current campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Withdraw the army from any involvement or interference in the voting. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange, the guerrillas offer what represents a major shift of policy: 
their participation in the electoral process without first obtaining a share of 
power. Previous talks between the government and the rebels had collapsed over 
that demand for power sharing. 
</P>
<P>
The rebel proposal included a promise to accept the outcome of the balloting 
and to stop intimidating mayors or the candidates of any party. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Open to Negotiation 
</P>
<P>
Rebel spokesmen, who formally presented the proposal to the media in Mexico 
City on Tuesday, indicated that its terms are open to negotiation. 
</P>
<P>
Viera, in laying out the government's reaction, focused on the guerrillas' 
demand that the voting scheduled for March 19 be delayed six months, until 
Sept. 15. That demand presents "an insurmountable constitutional obstacle," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"President Duarte recognizes that the proposal is positive," Viera said, "but 
the postponement can't be so long." 
</P>
<P>
El Salvador's constitution requires that the first round of presidential 
elections take place no later than two months before the new president is to 
take office. In the current circumstance, Viera said, that means the election 
must be held by March 31. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the talk of finding positive elements in the plan and promising to 
consider all of its points, other senior officials noted that the proposal 
fails to deal with such key questions as whether the guerrillas will continue 
the civil war that is now in its ninth year and whether they will lay down 
their arms if a candidate they oppose wins the election. 
</P>
<P>
Another development that gives a negative cast to the prospects for a 
settlement of the civil war based on the guerrilla proposal was a statement 
from the defense minister, Gen. Carlos Vides Casanova, that the plan "is a ruse 
for power sharing." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opposed by Military 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, a senior government official, who asked not to be identified by 
name, said that all senior military officers recommended that the guerrilla 
plan be rejected, a stance also taken by leaders of the National Republican 
Alliance, or Arena, the nation's major right-wing political party. 
</P>
<P>
Former army Col. Sigifredo Ochoa Perez, vice president of the National Assembly 
and a powerful influence in Arena, said the rebel plan is "a trap and 
unconstitutional. . . . We are willing to talk. But what we cannot do is 
subordinate ourselves to a group of terrorist delinquents." 
</P>
<P>
However, while Viera and the others were tentatively rejecting the demand for 
postponing the election, FMLN leaders were telling reporters in Mexico City 
that all 12 points of their proposal, even the election date, are negotiable. 
</P>
<P>
"We have made a proposal that we do not view as finished," said Ana Guadalupe 
Martinez, an FMLN representative. The rebel leaders are willing to meet with 
government and army officials publicly or privately, in El Salvador or in 
another country, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Another FMLN spokesman, Salvador Samayoa, denied that there is a serious 
constitutional obstacle. 
</P>
<P>
"Those people are not rejecting this proposal because it violates the 
constitution, because they have never respected the constitution," he said. "It 
is a purely formal, legal argument, an irresponsible argument in a situation in 
which peace is the issue." 
</P>
<P>
As to Vides Casanova's charge, Samayoa reiterated that the guerrillas are 
dropping their previous demands for power sharing as a condition for ending the 
war. In so doing, he touched on a crucial missing element in Tuesday's response 
to the rebel proposal: the reaction of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"For eight years (the United States) has been saying that the only obstacle to 
a political solution in El Salvador was our demand for a formula for power 
sharing before elections," Samayoa said. "We are removing that obstacle for the 
United States. It's their move." 
</P>
<P>
But the Bush Administration did not appear to be ready to make a move Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Both the U.S. Embassy here and State Department experts on Central America 
recommended that the Administration issue a statement tentatively welcoming the 
proposal as a positive step -- but one that the Salvadoran government would 
have responsibility for answering. However, in the absence of James A. Baker 
III, the secretary of state-designate who has not yet been confirmed by the 
Senate, career diplomats temporarily in charge of Central American policy 
decided not to say anything of substance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Studying Proposal 
</P>
<P>
"We have seen the proposal and are studying it," State Department spokesman 
Charles Redman said. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats and some Salvadoran officials said that if the United States does not 
form a policy quickly, whatever chance the FMLN plan has of evolving into a 
peace process will be lost. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no chance of the military accepting this unless the Americans put all 
the pressure they can expend," said a Latin American envoy who asked not to be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has given El Salvador more than $3 billion in military and 
economic aid since the war began and continues to provide the country with more 
than half of its annual revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the rebels warned that if the offer is not developed into a 
positive step toward peace, a war that has killed between 40,000 and 65,000 
people -- half of them civilians -- is likely to accelerate.

Operators at the Savannah River Plant in South Carolina mishandled a routine 
pressure test last weekend and damaged pipes and valves on a critical 
nuclear-weapons reactor that the Energy Department had hoped to restart this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the accident Sunday damaged a backup cooling system for the K 
Reactor, one of three Savannah River reactors that have been shut down for 
safety reasons since April. The reactors are the nation's only source of 
tritium, a perishable component of nuclear weapons. And the K Reactor was 
expected to be restarted first. 
</P>
<P>
Energy Department officials said the accident posed no health or safety problem 
and that it is too early to know whether the damage will delay the restart of 
the reactor. 
</P>
<P>
But the accident raised new questions about operating procedures at the aging 
weapons complex, and the department said it has halted testing and maintenance 
work there until after the incident has been investigated.

A poaching ring that involved the slaughter of more than 400 black bears in the 
Northeast was broken Tuesday with the arrests of 11 people, officials said. The 
bears were killed for their gall bladders, which are prized as aphrodisiacs in 
the Far East. The arrests were the culmination of a 2 1/2-year investigation by 
wildlife officials from Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York and the U.S. Fish 
and Wildlife Service.

QUAYLE ABANDONS PLANS TO CONCENTRATE ON CAPITOL 
</P>

<P>
Vice President Dan Quayle, continuing to flesh out what his role in the new 
Administration will be, Tuesday made a round of calls on Capitol Hill but said 
that he has abandoned earlier thoughts of making such visits a dominant part of 
his job. 
</P>
<P>
For weeks before being sworn in, Quayle had toyed with the idea of spending 
most of his time at the Capitol, serving as President Bush's "eyes and ears" in 
Congress and trying to influence deliberations in the Senate by exercising the 
vice president's little-used powers as presiding officer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Will Be 'Downtown' 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, however, he told reporters that "most of my time is going to be spent 
downtown" at the White House. Having met with Senate Majority Leader George J. 
Mitchell (D-Me.), Quayle realizes that "the powers of the presiding officer are 
extremely limited," said his press secretary, David Beckwith. And as for being 
the eyes and ears, Quayle said: "I'm going to be as effective in getting that 
kind of intelligence and information from down there as up here." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Quayle will be fulfilling more traditional vice presidential duties, 
including foreign trips, the first of which will come next week, the White 
House announced Tuesday. The trip, Quayle joked in a meeting with House 
Republican leaders, will be for a happy event rather than a funeral -- the 
swearing-in of Venezuela's new president, Carlos Andres Perez. 
</P>
<P>
After a day in Venezuela, Quayle will stop briefly in El Salvador to deliver a 
message of good wishes from Bush to ailing President Jose Napoleon Duarte. 
</P>
<P>
The trip, Quayle said, "will be a good signal and symbol" of the importance the 
United States places on Venezuela's tradition of democratic elections. In 
addition, he said, he hopes to "have some bilateral discussions with other 
leaders while I'm there." 
</P>
<P>
But he replied with an abrupt "no" when asked if he would meet with 
representatives of Nicaragua's left-wing Sandinista government. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stern Lecture 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, President Ronald Reagan sent Bush on a mission to El Salvador. Bush at 
the time delivered a stern lecture to that country's military and civilian 
leaders about the need to end right-wing "death squad" violence. This time, 
however, Quayle's mission is far less sensitive, simply to deliver a message of 
the "friendship and concern the United States has always had for El Salvador," 
said White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater. 
</P>
<P>
On Capitol Hill, Quayle presided at a brief news conference, then was 
photographed in a series of meetings with House and Senate leaders, including 
Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas, who kept him waiting for half an 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
While the sessions were largely courtesy calls, complete with lighthearted 
chatter about golf games and football tickets, they fit in with the 
Administration strategy of keeping Quayle in the public eye in positive 
settings, an attempt to counteract the negative images with which he was 
barraged during the fall election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle's decision to stay "downtown," meanwhile, appears to be part of his own 
strategy to maximize the access he will have to White House policy-making. The 
idea of spending large amounts of time on Capitol Hill had been advocated by 
several senior Republicans, including Howard H. Baker Jr., the former Senate 
majority leader who served for a time as chief of staff in the Reagan White 
House. So far, Quayle seems to be having considerable access to the President, 
meeting seven times with Bush on Monday and four times on Tuesday, Beckwith 
said.

MOSBACHER WOULD RELAX LAWS TO MEET COMPETITION

<P>
Robert A. Mosbacher, the Bush Administration's nominee for commerce secretary, 
told a Senate committee Tuesday that he would favor relaxing U.S. antitrust 
laws to allow American companies to work together to meet foreign competition 
in high-technology products. 
</P>
<P>
Testifying at a confirmation hearing before the Senate Commerce, Science and 
Transportation Committee, Mosbacher warned that American industry is losing out 
to European and Japanese companies in developing superconductors and 
high-definition video receivers. 
</P>
<P>
He pledged to strictly enforce new provisions in the 1988 trade law for 
retaliation against unfair trade practices by other nations and to take other 
steps to boost U.S. exports. 
</P>
<P>
With the decline in the dollar's value in recent years, "we have an opportunity 
to . . . open up to a greater extent the rest of the world for our goods and 
services and this we must push," he said. If other countries do not open their 
markets, "we would have no recourse but to strongly, fairly, totally enforce . 
. . the trade act." 
</P>
<P>
Mosbacher's get-tough message was exactly the kind that committee members 
wanted to hear after last year's lengthy congressional struggle to set a 
stronger U.S. trade stance. The Texas businessman seems certain to win 
unanimous committee approval in a vote next Tuesday, with action by the full 
Senate expected shortly thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
Replying to a question from Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.), Mosbacher stressed 
that the government should be willing to give the U.S. high-tech industry a 
boost because the nation is "losing the advantage we started out with" in 
superconductors and high-definition videos. 
</P>
<P>
"What we might do is allow more consortia to form, more unified work, so the 
private sector could work together without government interference," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mosbacher suggested that present antitrust exemptions could be expanded to 
"allow companies to work together . . . in actual manufacturing" of products in 
this field. Exemptions currently allow such cooperation only in research and 
development of new products, new materials and new production techniques. 
</P>
<P>
Semiconductor manufacturers have banded together with U.S. blessing in a 
not-for-profit research consortium.

TO FORMER DODGER HOLTON, ORIOLES ARE LOOKING GREAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD JUSTICE, The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

BALTIMORE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Almost two months after he learned his World Series ring would be arriving by 
courier instead of by handshake, Brian Holton formally was welcomed to his new 
team this week. 
</P>
<P>
On the December day he was sent to the Baltimore Orioles in a trade that made 
first baseman Eddie Murray a member of the Los Angeles Dodgers, Holton's wife, 
Wendy, spent the morning looking at homes in some nice Southern California 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
After almost nine seasons in the minors and surgery to piece his right elbow 
back together in 1983, Holton figured two straight splendid seasons in the 
Dodgers' bullpen had earned him that much security. 
</P>
<P>
It had not, and this week while he toured Memorial Stadium, met some of his new 
teammates and spoke of being one of the building blocks for the reconstruction 
of the Orioles, Wendy Holton was house hunting again -- in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
"You learn to adjust," he said, smiling. "I'm excited about being here. I had a 
good time in Los Angeles. When I left, I'd earned a World Series ring, and I'd 
like to have another one." 
</P>
<P>
Holton spoke in the stadium's executive boardroom where he shared a media 
conference with first baseman Randy Milligan, whose career, like Holton's, has 
taken some unexpected turns. 
</P>
<P>
Holton spent the last year establishing himself as a first-rate major-leaguer 
-- a 7-3 record with a 1.70 earned run average -- but Milligan has been traded 
twice and now has a chance at a second new beginning. 
</P>
<P>
Few people would have predicted that 12 months ago, after Baseball America 
named Milligan its "minor-leaguer of the year." He'd just finished a tremendous 
season at Class AAA Tidewater, hitting .326 with 29 home runs and 103 RBI and 
missing an International League triple batting crown by an eyelash. 
</P>
<P>
But in the New York Mets organization, he found himself on an assembly line of 
major-league talent. From the moment his 1987 season ended, the Mets told him 
he'd probably be headed back to Tidewater because Keith Hernandez didn't look 
close to retirement. 
</P>
<P>
"They told me that, then I had some contract problems," Milligan said. "With 
all my good seasons with the Mets, I felt they could have done a little more 
for me. I was in no shape to play baseball." 
</P>
<P>
He got a break late in spring training when the Mets sent him to Pittsburgh for 
catcher Mackey Sasser, a deal that appeared to have opened one last door for 
Milligan. It did not. He finished with just 82 at-bats -- .220, three homers, 
eight RBI -- and spent about half the season at AAA Buffalo. After it was over, 
he was traded to the Orioles for a middling minor leaguer. 
</P>
<P>
"(The Pirates) called it platooning," Milligan said, "but what it was is that 
I'd play against some of the left-handed pitchers (with Sid Bream playing 
against the righties). There are not many left-handed starters in the National 
League, and I ended up sitting all the time. I don't feel 82 at-bats makes you 
a big-league player. . . . You've got to be in there to learn the ropes and 
learn the pitchers. I still have no doubt I can make it." 
</P>
<P>
He'll have the chance now because as the Orioles look for Murray's replacement, 
they've pretty much thrown the door open to Jim Traber, Milligan and perhaps 
others. Milligan, 27, says a chance is all he can ask. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a great opportunity," he said. "It seems like when you go to a 
team that's a winner, you don't get a chance. Hopefully, I'll get the chance 
here. They need right-handed power, and that's me. . . . I don't see myself not 
winning the job." 
</P>
<P>
Holton's situation is less radical. At 29, he has proven himself, having been 
an important part of a bullpen that led the National League in wins, saves and 
ERA in 1988. He had the Dodgers' lowest ERA and a winning percentage second 
only to NL Cy Young winner Orel Hershiser's. 
</P>
<P>
His ERA was the second-lowest in the majors among pitchers with 75 or more 
innings (Cincinnati's John Franco was 1.57). He allow no runs after Aug. 14, 
and one run in six postseason innings. 
</P>
<P>
What the Orioles can offer him that the Dodgers couldn't is a chance to start. 
The Orioles go to spring training in three weeks with rookies Pete Harnisch and 
Bob Milacki penciled in for two of the five starting spots. The other three are 
open, and Holton is a good bet. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm excited about that," Holton said. "My number one goal is try to win a job 
in the rotation. I'd been a starter my whole career (entirely in the Dodgers 
system) before I got to the Dodgers, and I feel my role is to be a starter." 
</P>
<P>
He said it was a huge adjustment going from best team to worst, but added, "I 
found out what it takes to win. You've got to set a goal that's within reach, 
then go for it. I was surprised to be traded, but after it happened, I was 
happy. This is a good opportunity for me."

 -- Orioles Notes: Prospects Jose Mesa and Leo Gomez agreed to 1989 contracts. 
Right-hander Mesa, 22, was 0-3 with an 8.62 ERA last year at Class AAA 
Rochester; he had a bone spur removed from his elbow July 29. Third baseman 
Gomez, 21, went out with a stress fracture in his right leg April 29; he had 
hit .325 in the organization over the last three years.

TRADING IN MEMORIES HAS BECOME BIG BUSINESS

Gather 'round boys and girls and listen to a story. Once upon a time, baseball 
players scribbled their names on bats and balls and programs for free. 
</P>
<P>
They didn't even expect a smile in return. 
</P>
<P>
Honest. 
</P>
<P>
"No way," said Matthew Green, a 12-year-old from Mount Laurel, N.J. "That's 
fantasy, man. You've got to pay for this. It's more interesting this way. Now, 
everyone can't have an autograph. They have to pay for it." 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to nostalgia in the 1980s, where every name has a price and every 
baseball card has market value. 
</P>
<P>
Green, and thousands of other baseball fans ranging from tots to senior 
citizens, paid a $5 admission fee, plus a hefty starcharge, for the privilege 
of receiving autographs from 13 certifiable legends recently. The 11 living 
members of baseball's 500 home-run club, plus Pete Rose and Duke Snider, sat at 
tables and signed thousands of autographs for the mob at the Tropworld casino. 
</P>
<P>
"The players bring their hands and their names," said Kevin Meyers, one of the 
more than 200 sports memorabilia and baseball card dealers who worked the show. 
"I think you could sell anything with a player on it. This is a big business of 
800 (phone) numbers and credit cards." 
</P>
<P>
The collection of home run hitters was breathtaking: Hank Aaron, Willie Mays, 
Mickey Mantle, Reggie Jackson, Mike Schmidt, Eddie Mathews, Harmon Killebrew, 
Ernie Banks, Frank Robinson, Willie McCovey and Ted Williams. 
</P>
<P>
This was a living wing of the Hall of Fame, and no one seemed to mind that two 
active managers (Robinson and Rose), one active player (Schmidt) and one 
prominent club official (Aaron) were being paid a reported $15,000 and up by an 
outside promoter to work a holiday weekend in two ballrooms one flight above a 
gambling hall. 
</P>
<P>
"If I'm on the street and ask a player for his autograph, I'm afraid I'll have 
to pay him money," said Michael Puzzo, a collectible dealer from Allentown, Pa. 
"I kind of feel sorry for these kids waiting on these long lines. But this 
business will only get bigger. This is pop culture. These players are the movie 
stars of the 20th and 21st centuries." 
</P>
<P>
Autograph prices were staggering: from $7 for a Killebrew, Mathews, or Snider 
signature, to $30 for a Mantle or Williams signature, to $150 for the complete 
13-player package. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe I'm here, but to my son, it's worth it," said Nancy Calvitti, 
who was shepherding her 14-year-old son, Anthony, through the crowd. The 
Calvittis, from Chalfont, Pa., bought the Super Ticket. 
</P>
<P>
"What I don't mind about this hobby is that he can do it for the rest of his 
life," she said. "I was actually happy to see these players. They're all 
legends." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the legends were mystified by the autograph process. Williams, with six 
pens and magic markers scattered in front of him on a table, kept his head down 
and mechanically signed baseball cards, pictures and balls. Mantle wandered 
aimlessly around the hall, occassionally smiling. Banks cheerfully thanked each 
youngster. Robinson appeared studious. Mays seemed annoyed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not easy signing your name 400 times," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Aaron: "My first year in the big leagues I made $5,000, and now I'm making 
more than that in one weekend. This is just crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Not really. Check these prices: $5,000 for a Babe Ruth bat, $12 for a 1969 
Brooks Robinson card, $30 for a New York Mets record album that includes such 
standards as "Green Grass of Shea," and $1 million for a 1932 Charles "Lindy" 
Lindstrom card, a one of a kind trinket from a United States Caramel Company 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm amazed how far these bubble gum cards have come," McCovey said. "I didn't 
know there were that many people out there with that big a collection." 
</P>
<P>
Note to McCovey: Baseball card trading is now a $125 million-a-year industry, 
with four major companies and thousands of dealers cashing in on nostalgia. The 
Baseball Card Society recently began selling stock at 4 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten years ago, I brought seven Hank Aaron rookie cards for $15 each and I 
wondered if I was crazy," said Bill Huggins, a partner in House of Cards of 
Wheaton, Md. "Now, the cards are worth $700 apiece. The market for cards has 
fallen slightly twice, once in 1981 and another time last year. But you'd be 
surprised how many little kids pull out $50 and $100 bills from their socks. 
That keeps this going." 
</P>
<P>
The kids were everywhere at this show, waiting patiently on line, thumbing 
through the stacks of cards laid out on tables. Millions of cards, neatly 
arranged, all priced, packaged and ready for sale. 
</P>
<P>
The three McDonnell brothers of Manchester, N.J., ended their day with four 
complete sets of 1988 cards. They tossed out the bubble gum and priced their 
cards with the aid of a booklet. Background noise was supplied by the slot 
machines downstairs. 
</P>
<P>
"A Jose Canseco rookie card goes for $75," said Rob, 15, a high school 
sophomore. "But if he has a bad year, the price of the card can go down. They 
move so easily." 
</P>
<P>
It's called supply and demand. 
</P>
<P>
"The cards are worth a lot," said Mark, 11, a fifth grader. "My dad told me he 
used to have a Mickey Mantle rookie card but he traded it away as a kid. Now, 
that card is worth $6,000. He could have hit the jackpot." 
</P>
<P>
This is commerce. 
</P>
<P>
"In the last 15 years, baseball cards have gone up 200 to 300%," said Fred 
Davies of Big League Promotions Inc., in Deal, N.J. "But that's not a true 
value. The card price guides inflated prices, and some $20 cards became $4,000 
cards. But true collectibles, autographed photographs, books and letters, never 
go out of style. The reason is because more people relate to baseball than any 
other sport. You couldn't do this kind of show with football cards." 
</P>
<P>
Even Reggie Jackson, unable to sign autographs because of an accident that left 
him with a cast on his left hand, was awestruck by the company of stars and the 
corps of kids. 
</P>
<P>
"No other country has a Ted Williams, a Mickey Mantle or a Willie Mays," 
Jackson said. "I mean, look at Ted Williams, that man is Paul Bunyan in real 
life. I'd pay for his autograph. If fans will pay for autographs, then they 
must be worth it." 
</P>
<P>
Once, fathers and sons played catch. Now, they play the card and autograph 
market, buying memories and history. Only a few appear to comprehend that true 
memories can't be bought and sold. 
</P>
<P>
"I know others would sell this autograph, but I won't," John Hynes, a 
12-year-old from Tenafly, N.J., said after emerging from the Robinson line with 
a signed baseball. "The value you have is something your own. I'll always 
remember this, and keep this ball."

WHILE OFFICIALS SCRAMBLE TO RECALL BILLY RIPKEN'S 1989 BASEBALL CARD, 
COLLECTORS ARE HAVING A FIELD DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
There has been Billy Beer. There has been BillyBall. But there never has been 
anything like the Billy card controversy that is raging among baseball card 
collectors. 
</P>
<P>
There have been cards printed with the wrong picture or a misspelled name, or a 
prankster wearing his glove on the wrong hand or holding a shattered bat, 
so-called error cards to hobbyists. But -- at least in the modern era of 
collecting, since Topps and Bowman sets entered the market in the late 1940s 
and early '50s -- there has never been a card recalled until this week. 
</P>
<P>
When collectors and dealers began opening the 1989 Fleer packs they found some 
curious writing on the knob of Billy Ripken's bat. 
</P>
<P>
There is the Baltimore Orioles second baseman in a casual pose, with his bat 
resting on his shoulder. And there, on the knob, readable if you look closely, 
is a 2-word obscenity, " . . . Face," which may or may not be Ripken's 
clubhouse nickname but was certainly not intended for the bubble-gum set. 
</P>
<P>
And there is the red-faced Fleer Corp. in Philadelphia, getting angry calls 
from the Orioles and the baseball commissioner's office, trying to recall 
shipments from its distributors, reportedly with the threat of a shipping 
cutoff if a large percentage of cases aren't returned. 
</P>
<P>
All the parties involved are embarrassed -- through a team spokesman, Ripken 
claims he was the victim of a teammate's prank -- and say that Fleer has done 
everything possible to recall the cards. 
</P>
<P>
The upshot is, the cards that got out before the recall have become the hottest 
collectible on the market, both a dream and a nightmare for card dealers and 
collectors as the supply rapidly dries up. 
</P>
<P>
At a card show in Lomita last weekend, the card was being sold for as much as 
$35, and collectors were snapping up unopened 36-pack Fleer boxes for $50, 
about twice the normal price. Some dealers were refusing to sell packs, 
preferring to sit on the cards as speculators drive up the price. 
</P>
<P>
At a card collectors' auction Saturday in Westchester, a Ripken card sold for 
$30, and a 660-card Fleer set including the card went for $75. 
</P>
<P>
Several Los Angeles area dealers said they were refusing to carry the card and 
wouldn't deal Fleer cards until general printing resumed. All dealers contacted 
said that they were getting dozens of calls inquiring about the card. 
</P>
<P>
One Southland dealer contacted Monday still had Fleer packs available -- at a 
hefty $3 apiece -- but wouldn't sell them to minors. So Billy Ripken has 
finally topped his all-star brother, Cal: He's on the first adults-only 
baseball card. 
</P>
<P>
Fleer executives declined to return phone calls, and it is not known how many 
Ripken cards were distributed and how many Fleer hopes to destroy. Nor is it 
clear how the obscenity got by the photographer and Fleer editors. 
</P>
<P>
If Fleer manages to destroy most of the objectionable cards, the existing 
Ripken cards figure to be subject to rampant price speculation for a while. One 
Los Angeles dealer said an East Coast dealer had offered him $35 a card. 
Another dealer said he has heard of the card selling for more than $100 in the 
Baltimore area. 
</P>
<P>
Fleer, the Orioles and major league baseball, which has a hand in marketing 
baseball cards, wish this one would just go away. A spokesman for Commissioner 
Peter Ueberroth's office said the printing "was a very unfortunate incident. . 
. . Once we found out about it, we made sure Fleer knew about our unhappiness." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Miller, the public relations director for the Orioles, said Ripken has a 
reputation for being a joker among his teammates but didn't find this incident 
humorous. 
</P>
<P>
"Billy said he was not aware that word was on the bat," Miller said. "Fleer 
claims it was unaware. We've got our own opinions, they've got their opinions 
about how it happened. I'm not sure it's worth pointing fingers at anybody. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing is certain -- we want to get as many as possible back and destroyed. 
There are a lot of things Billy Ripken can do to get famous. This wasn't one of 
the ways he wanted. Maybe in 100 years we'll look back and think this was 
funny. But it will take about that long."

DENNY MCLAIN SINGS, LEON SPINKS TENDS BAR AT SAME CLUB

Just last month, Denny McLain, former Detroit Tigers pitcher, faced his second 
prison term. 
</P>
<P>
But McLain, 44, is now playing pop music on a synthesizer at a bar in this 
Detroit suburb after receiving 5 years' probation. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball's last 30-game winner -- sentenced in December to probation after 
pleading guilty to racketeering and cocaine possession charges -- entertains 5 
nights a week at Jovan's, where former heavyweight boxing champion Leon Spinks 
tends bar. 
</P>
<P>
Jovan's owner, Al Balooly, said he thought it might be good for business "to 
have someone with a name playing here." 
</P>
<P>
Balooly also hired Spinks, the 35-year-old former heavyweight boxing champion, 
last week as a combination bartender-greeter. 
</P>
<P>
Monday, the two former big names in Detroit sports met for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
"I told Denny that if anybody gives him any trouble, I'll punch them out," 
Spinks joked. 
</P>
<P>
McLain, who won 31 games with the Tigers in 1968, was convicted in Tampa, Fla., 
of loan-sharking, gambling and cocaine dealing in March 1985, and sentenced to 
23 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
He was released after serving 29 months, when a federal appeals court ruled he 
had been treated unfairly by the judge at his trial. He then pleaded guilty to 
racketeering and cocaine possession charges as part of a plea-bargain agreement 
and began his probation Dec. 15. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's just say I'm glad it's over," McLain said in an interview with the 
Detroit Free Press. "It's tough not knowing what your future is going to be. I 
didn't even buy a 1989 calendar -- that's how unsure I was of what was going to 
happen to me." 
</P>
<P>
McLain and his family now live in Fort Wayne, Ind. He said it hasn't been easy 
readjusting to family life. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . You don't realize how much you miss your family until you can't be with 
them," he said.

Dave Winfield and George Steinbrenner will allow an arbitrator to rule on their 
fight over the Winfield Foundation, rather than proceed with federal lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
At the instigation of Mike Lupica, a columnist for the New York Daily News, 
Steinbrenner and Winfield agreed to let Michael Armstrong, a New York lawyer, 
decide the issues. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Winfield sued Steinbrenner and the Yankees, claiming that 
they had not made $450,000 in payments to the foundation. Three days later, 
Steinbrenner countersued, charging that Winfield had failed to make at least 
$380,000 in payments and alleging that Winfield had used the foundation to pay 
expenses for himself and friends.

NEWSWIRE: KANSAS CITY NAMES SCHOTTENHEIMER AS COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marty Schottenheimer, who had resigned as coach of the Cleveland Browns at the 
end of the season in a dispute with owner Art Modell, was named coach of the 
Kansas City Chiefs Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Schottenheimer, 45, took the Browns to the playoffs in each of his 4 full 
seasons as coach. His 32-15 regular-season record the last 3 years is unmatched 
in the AFC and ranks behind only Mike Ditka of the Chicago Bears and Bill Walsh 
of the San Francisco 49ers among National Football League coaches. 
</P>
<P>
His resignation from the Browns was triggered by his refusal to hire an 
offensive coordinator, a role he was filling. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he would hire an offensive coordinator with the Chiefs, Schottenheimer 
broke into a grin. 
</P>
<P>
"We will have an individual to fill that role," he said. "Rest easy. Marty 
Schottenheimer is not going to call the plays. Someone will have that role, if 
not the title."

DEFENDING CHAMPIONS RETURNING TO L.A. MARATHON

Martin Mondragon and Blanca Jaime of Mexico, the surprise winners of the men's 
and women's divisions of the 1988 Los Angeles Marathon, will return to defend 
their titles, running in the fourth annual race March 5. 
</P>
<P>
Other elite runners will include Orlando Pizzolato of Italy, a 2-time winner in 
New York, and Mark Plaatjes, formerly of South Africa, who was third here last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Marathon officials will announce the elite field, along with the prize money 
structure, in a news conference Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Mondragon, who was overlooked before last year's race, "wants to prove it was 
not a fluke," according to his agent, Rich Castro. 
</P>
<P>
In that race, Mondragon took the lead after 20 miles and continued to duel with 
Plaatjes for the next 6 miles. He finished strongly, setting a course record of 
2 hours 10 minutes 19 seconds. Because Mondragon was not considered a 
contender, he was unaware of the $25,000 bonus for the first person to run a 
sub-2:10 race. 
</P>
<P>
Castro said that Mondragon's life has changed little after winning $25,000 for 
first place and an automobile, which he did not take back to Mexico. Mondragon, 
who lives outside Mexico City, was able to quit his job in a print shop and 
devote more time to running. 
</P>
<P>
Plaatjes has had an eventful year since running in L.A., his first race since 
giving up his South African passport. He and his wife and their two daughters 
live in the Chicago area, where Plaatjes is working as a physical therapist. He 
is currently applying to medical schools. 
</P>
<P>
Plaatjes has one of the best times in the field, 2.08:52. 
</P>
<P>
The depth of the women's field was dealt a blow Wednesday when Grete Waitz, 
9-time winner of the New York Marathon, pulled out because of a stress fracture 
in her foot.

Anna Maria Conrad is 7 years older and a whole lot wiser than she was on March 
31, 1982, when an avalanche buried her at Alpine Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
Seven others died, and Conrad was given up for dead until rescuers found her 5 
days later in a 2 x 5-foot pocket under lockers in the ski lift terminal 
building. She thought the building had exploded. 
</P>
<P>
Because of frostbite, she lost her right leg below the knee and part of her

"I'm skiing at the level I was at before I lost my leg," she said. "But I still 
want to improve -- especially when my husband is an instructor." 
</P>
<P>
Conrad, 28, is now the skier safety coordinator at Mammoth Mountain. She 
married local resident Brent Allen, a welder and ski instructor, a year and a 
half ago. 
</P>
<P>
She wears a prosthesis. Asked if her husband makes allowances for that, she 
said, "I don't make allowances." 
</P>
<P>
She recalled the fateful day in '82 when she and a friend, Frank Yateman, went 
to Alpine Meadows. Because the roads were intermittently closed, they skied 
cross-country. 
</P>
<P>
"I called the ski area and asked them if the road was open again," she said. 
"They said yes, it was. With my education of avalanches at the time, I thought 
that when they reopened an area that meant it was stable." 
</P>
<P>
What she didn't realize, she said, was that "it was stable enough for cars but 
there was difficulty with skiers out in the open." 
</P>
<P>
When she arrived at the ski area, mountain manager Bernie Kingery told her of 
the danger. Kingery and Yateman were among those who perished. Conrad was in 
another part of the building, temporarily unconscious. 
</P>
<P>
Trapped in darkness, she tried to keep track of the days by listening to the 
avalanche-control explosions nearby. 
</P>
<P>
"They did it every morning," she said. "I didn't know where I was at first, and 
when I came to I was able to hear the blasting that I could hear at my house. 
They didn't blast one of the days because the storm was so bad they couldn't 
get up to the ski area. So I was off by a day." RICH ROBERTS

<P>
On the day before Christmas, there was a snowstorm so fierce that Bob Moore 
couldn't see Interstate 80 from his window in the U.S. Forest Service building 
100 yards away. 
</P>
<P>
"It was real spooky out in the mountains," Moore said. "Everything was sliding. 
We had an avalanche situation that was horrible. We had a lot of snow, high 
winds, temperatures rising. The danger went to extreme." 
</P>
<P>
It was time to call in the artillery. 
</P>
<P>
Moore is the special-uses assistant for the Truckee Ranger District, Tahoe 
National Forest, responsible for avalanche control in the northern section of 
the Eastern Sierra between the Yuba Pass (California 49) and the Sonora Pass 
(California 108). 
</P>
<P>
Historically, the area around Lake Tahoe receives one of the heaviest snowfalls 
in the nation -- and, as a result, also has some of the finest skiing at places 
such as Squaw Valley, site of the 1960 Winter Olympics; Sugar Bowl, Donner Ski 
Ranch, Boreal, the Royal Gorge Nordic cross-country area and Alpine Meadows, 
all of which Moore watches over year-round, among his other duties. 
</P>
<P>
"The ski areas are under special-use permits," he said. "I do planning, working 
with the ski areas on their construction projects and proposals, making sure 
they're in compliance with the American National Standards Institute Code, the 
standard code that ski lifts have to follow, (which covers) everything from 
design and construction through the operation and maintenance." 
</P>
<P>
The last 2 years have been light for snow in the Eastern Sierra, but early 
snows indicate the region may have at least an average year again. In his 
office at 7:50 a.m., Moore routinely checks the graph on the thermometer 
outside the wall. 
</P>
<P>
"Warm this morning -- 12 degrees," he says. "It was zero up at my house." 
</P>
<P>
He phones Sugar Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"How much snow you get yesterday? Just a trace? How's your wind now? Perfect." 
</P>
<P>
Moore hangs up and says: "You know when you can expect certain types of 
avalanches. It all depends on the particular slope and whether you've got 
enough snowpack in there to cover up the anchor points -- rocks, trees, stumps, 
shrubbery. Once you get a snowpack above that level, the probability for an 
avalanche is pretty high, even for things below the anchor points. We have what 
we call climax avalanches where they go all the way to the ground . . . take 
everything with 'em." 
</P>
<P>
Moore is at the hub of a network involving the ski area operators, the National 
Weather Service and CalTrans, which may close roads when avalanche danger is 
extreme, as it was Dec. 24. 
</P>
<P>
"There were avalanches occurring," Moore said. "They weren't monster climax 
avalanches but enough that they could have caught somebody and buried 'em." 
</P>
<P>
Moore probably caused some of them himself by firing off the various artillery 
at his disposal, including a pair of 75-millimeter pack howitzers, a recoilless 
rifle and an Avalauncher -- all used to bring building snowpacks down before 
they become dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
"The warnings we put out are all for the back country outside the ski areas, 
(but) we get the majority of our information from the ski areas, (which) have 
their own programs for doing hazard forecast evaluations within the ski area 
boundary," Moore said. "If there is an avalanche problem, the operators are 
very good. They make the proper decisions and go into closure on their own." 
</P>
<P>
Running a ski area is a feast-or-famine business, and it especially hurts an 
operator to turn away revenue by shutting down on a holiday weekend. But Moore 
said it has never been a problem. The conditions of Dec. 24 were too ominous to 
ignore. 
</P>
<P>
"The operators saw what was happening and just shut down the upper mountains," 
Moore said. "It's a tough decision to make, but when the storm hit, the winds 
were so high that most of the areas could not run their lifts, anyway. It's not 
unusual in this area to have storm winds in excess of 100 m.p.h." 
</P>
<P>
Avalanches weren't the Donner party's problem. When those 87 unfortunate 
pioneers reached Truckee on Oct. 31, 1846, they found the pass that would bear 
leader George Donner's name already blocked by snow. Snowbound all winter, they 
became the West's great winter tragedy. Forty survived by eating their animals, 
their shoes and, finally, their dead. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, at 3:45 p.m. on March 31, 1982, an avalanche did claim the lives 
of 7 people at Alpine Meadows. One survived -- Anna Maria Conrad, 22 -- after 5 
days under snow and debris. 
</P>
<P>
Moore remembers the incident well. Leading a reporter down California 89, past 
the traffic backed up for miles trying to get into Squaw Valley, he stops at 
the turnoff into Alpine Meadows to look back at the steep mountain on the 
opposite side of the road. Loaded with snow, it would loom menacing over the 
heavily traveled route. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't shut this (road) for 5 years," Moore said. "Haven't had snows that 
would warrant it." 
</P>
<P>
Farther up the road, he arrives at one of his howitzers, permanently mounted in 
a wood and concrete bunker. Lifting the shutters, Moore reveals the mountain 
just beyond the Alpine Meadows access road. The floors and walls are marked 
with preset coordinates for firing into specific spots as the World War 
II-vintage weapon is wheeled around on its rubber tires. 
</P>
<P>
Alongside is a gas-powered Avalauncher that throws 2-pound explosive 
projectiles onto the mountain, and Moore has a recoilless rifle mounted higher 
on a hill in the area, as well as another howitzer on a trailer that he can tow 
to other trouble spots. 
</P>
<P>
Moore also will go up on the ridges on skis and throw 2-pound sticks of 
dynamite with 60-second fuses over the top. 
</P>
<P>
But the howitzer, built about the time Moore, 42, was born, is his favorite. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a good weapon," he said, touching the barrel. "Extremely accurate, 
extremely consistent." 
</P>
<P>
However, he estimates that in 5 to 10 years he'll run out of ammunition. Nobody 
makes it anymore. 
</P>
<P>
The Alpine Meadows parking lot was crammed with cars and skiers on the recent 
Martin Luther King Jr. 3-day weekend. Moore indicated the ridge across the way, 
from the Poma Rocks on the left to where it falls off into a saddle 1,500 feet 
to the right. 
</P>
<P>
"That whole thing came down," Moore said. "We'd taken all the extraordinary 
measures we could. We'd done more than we normally do." 
</P>
<P>
In '82, he had been on the job 8 years. At his office, he pulled some files on 
snowfall figures. 
</P>
<P>
"You can see that at the end of March it just went straight up," Moore said, 
pointing out a fall of 110 inches in a 10-day period, doubling the total pack. 
</P>
<P>
Moore said that Alpine Meadows is in the most prevalent avalanche terrain and 
that it has a good program. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a good system back then. The ski area was closed. People had been told, 
'Go home, don't come to work.' We had been there that morning . . . shot the 
recoilless rifle, shot the pack howitzer at several different locations. 
</P>
<P>
"As you go back, our records indicate we had extreme avalanche hazard 
(warnings) out through that whole time period -- before, during and afterward. 
Everything that could have been done was done. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't had any sustained snowfalls like that," Moore said. "There was (an 
accident) in Sugar Bowl -- a fatality -- I think in '85. The area was closed. 
They violated the signs: 'Closed area, avalanche danger.' There was a physical 
barrier -- a rope -- across the ski run, and they went under the rope -- 
physically had to stop, duck down and go under the rope. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just providing a service. If people want to pay attention to it, fine."

COLLEGE DIVISION; 
</P>
<P>
HE WELCOMES DIFFERENCES AT SMALL COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
When it comes to college athletics, John Brooks Slaughter doesn't mean to imply 
that smaller is better. 
</P>
<P>
It's just that after 6 years as chancellor of the University of Maryland, the 
first-year president of Occidental College in Eagle Rock thinks that 
small-college athletics is a welcome change. 
</P>
<P>
"I like (small-college athletics) but saying I like it doesn't mean I'm 
throwing arrows at (National Collegiate Athletic Assn.) Division I programs," 
he said. "I'm just very comfortable with the approach we take to athletics at 
Occidental. It's more appropriate to what we are looking for in a college 
environment." 
</P>
<P>
Slaughter was chancellor at Maryland when basketball star Len Bias died of 
cocaine-related causes in June 1986 and Coach Lefty Driesell later resigned. 
</P>
<P>
But Slaughter, who was named president of Occidental last August, said his 
decision to switch jobs had nothing to do with those problems. 
</P>
<P>
"My decision to become president of Occidental was based strictly on the kind 
of academic institution it is," he said. "I wanted to be a part of its fine 
academic tradition." 
</P>
<P>
The selection of Slaughter, who is black, was hailed as a breakthrough by 
prominent black educators because Occidental's student population is 
predominantly white. 
</P>
<P>
Slaughter, 55, who headed the NCAA Presidents Commission from 1986 to 1988, 
said he immediately noticed a difference between the Division I and III 
approaches to athletics when he attended an Occidental football game for the 
first time last season and found the players lining up to shake hands and 
exchanging small talk afterward. 
</P>
<P>
"I had been to small-college football games before but never in the capacity as 
president," Slaughter said. "It was a new experience for me." 
</P>
<P>
Slaughter, who touched upon the differences between the divisions in a recent 
article in the Chronicle of Higher Education, said the reasons for competing at 
the Division III level are not the same as in major-college programs. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps the most important (thing) is that for the most part the athletes are 
participating in intercollegiate athletics as just a part of their college 
experience, rather than the reason for their participation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"All of these athletes are not just looking to go into a professional sports 
career. These are athletes who are maybe not as big or as fast as major-college 
athletes but want to participate just the same." 
</P>
<P>
Slaughter said the difference in financial incentives at major- and 
small-college programs cannot be underplayed. 
</P>
<P>
"There are not the same financial incentives at Division III as there are at 
the Division I level," he said. "(In Division I), you have to fill the field 
house and fill the stadium, and in order to do that you have to win, and in 
order to win you have to attract the players. 
</P>
<P>
"All those things are based on a desire to win. That's something that doesn't 
exist at the Division III level. You don't have to keep winning in order to 
keep the program going." 
</P>
<P>
Not that winning is not emphasized at the Division III level. Particularly at 
Occidental, where the Tigers have consistently fielded successful teams in 
football and cross-country. 
</P>
<P>
"We still want to win at Occidental," Slaughter said. "We believe it's still 
important to improve (athletically) and do your best. We still want to win the 
game, but as the president of our institution I'm not going to worry about it 
if we don't win the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference 
title." 
</P>
<P>
And Slaughter remains a fan of major-college athletics. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoy athletics at all levels," he said. "I'm still very interested in what 
the University of Maryland does. There are still people there who I know and 
admire and I follow them whenever I can." 
</P>
<P>
It's just that Slaughter likes what he has seen from athletics at the 
small-college level. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there is really a place for different approaches," he said. "But I 
think there is a need for places like Division III programs because it's really 
seen as part of an educational program rather than just athletics. . . . It's 
important for all athletes to receive an education that will prepare them for 
life. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't bemoan the fact that there are kinds of institutions where athletes 
are more developed or advanced and can pursue their athletic careers but I 
think more time should be spent on academics." 
</P>
<P>
Slaughter thinks Occidental has struck the perfect balance. 
</P>
<P>
College Division Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Cal Poly Pomona women and UC Riverside men were both ranked high in the 
first regular-season NCAA Division II basketball polls last week. Pomona was 
ranked No. 1 in the women's poll but has dropped to No. 4 despite winning twice 
and Riverside No. 2 behind Virginia Union among the men. Two other California 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. teams are ranked -- Cal State Bakersfield is No. 19 
in the men's division and Cal State Northridge is No. 16 in the women's. 
</P>
<P>
Senior defensive tackle Gary Willison of Azusa Pacific has been selected to the 
National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics' All-American football second team. 
Willison, a 6-foot 4-inch, 255-pound transfer from USC, led the Cougars with 
10.5 sacks in 8 games and added 66 tackles and 2 fumble recoveries. Linebacker 
Jeff Gustin and center Pat Earnest earned honorable mention. . . . Offensive 
lineman Roger Laubengayer of the Occidental football team has been named to the 
NCAA Division III All-American team by Football Gazette. Laubengayer helped the 
Tigers to an 8-1 record and their fifth SCIAC title in the last 6 years. 
Quarterback Tony Werbelow and linebacker Tim Swanson were honorable mentions. 
</P>
<P>
The Biola women's basketball team, off to its best start in recent years at 
15-3, earned its seventh straight victory and ran its NAIA District III record 
to 6-0 with a 75-70 win over defending champion Cal Baptist last Saturday. . . 
. Terry Franson, Azusa Pacific track coach, has been named an assistant for the 
U.S. team that will compete in the 1989 World University Games in August at Sao 
Paulo, Brazil. Franson has guided Azusa Pacific to 6 straight NAIA titles. . . 
. Sophomore defender Arturo Juarequi of Cal State Bakersfield was selected to 
the Division II All-Far West second team in soccer last week, marking the first 
time that the Roadrunners have had a player named to the squad.

LAGUNA ADOPTS STRICT DOWNTOWN PLAN DESPITE CRITICISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM CARLTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Concerned that Laguna's downtown business district is losing its quaint, 
village charm, the Laguna Beach City Council on Tuesday adopted its 
long-awaited Downtown Specific Plan, a sweeping design measure 7 years in the 
making that many merchants believe is too restrictive. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, which council members hope will keep the district from being overrun 
by yogurt stands and T-shirt shops that abound in many California beach cities, 
will require downtown's more than 400 shops and businesses to tow the line 
regarding colors, building size, outdoor displays and even the kind of plants 
they use. 
</P>
<P>
However, many merchants decry the plan as heavy-handed and say that this time 
the city has gone too far. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council has "no damn right to say who goes in and who goes out," local 
pharmacy owner Mack McCalla roared earlier Tuesday. "I think you'll find 
everyone in downtown will call them a bunch of turkeys." And Jack Hansen, owner 
of Axline's Village Shoes, groused: "I think the specific plan is 
anti-business. Let's let free enterprise take its course." 
</P>
<P>
But Councilman Dan Kenney said that free enterprise has run its course and that 
in the process Laguna's unique identity has become diluted by a crush of 
outside, tourist-oriented businesses. At the same time, he said, an alarming 
number of resident-serving businesses have been pulling out. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the questions I was first asked as a councilman was what can we do to 
preserve our small-town atmosphere," said Kenney, who conceived the specific 
plan shortly after being elected to the council in 1982. "Well, this is a real 
major step in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
The plan becomes law in 30 days. According to a Downtown Specific Plan report 
adopted by the council, the city then will have power under its zoning and 
planning authority to: 
</P>
<P>
* Curb the sizes of new businesses to one story and no more than 5,000 square 
feet. Previous city ordinance allowed downtown businesses to have two stories. 
</P>
<P>
* Forbid the use of fluorescent colors, large marquees, simulated materials and 
highly reflective glass. 
</P>
<P>
* Discourage businesses with a mass-market line of products, "since these 
detract from the sense of distinction that is important to the downtown's 
identity." 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the city also plans to spend about $5 million on a number of 
capital improvements, including: paving crosswalks with brick or textured 
material, consolidating parking meters along Forest Avenue to make room for 
pedestrians, paving alleys with cobblestones and putting in street lamps to 
lure more pedestrians and landscaping Broadway at the entrance to downtown to 
"create a boulevard effect." 
</P>
<P>
No timetable has been set for the capital improvements. 
</P>
<P>
The introduction of the specific plan report, which was prepared by the city 
Planning Commission, explained that the new design rules were needed because of 
"considerable concern" in recent years over downtown's changing character. 
</P>
<P>
"In order to maintain Laguna Beach as a community with a unique character, 
efforts must be made to protect the downtown with its eclectic mix of 
architectural styles, small-scale buildings, pedestrian orientation, rich 
variety of shops and services and sense of community," the report states. 
</P>
<P>
Considerable public input went into the preparation of this report. Dozens of 
meetings have been held over the years, first before a citizens' advisory 
committee that was impaneled to draw up a set of recommendations and then 
before the Planning Commission, which voted Dec. 14 to ask the council to carry 
them out. 
</P>
<P>
At its Jan. 10 meeting, the council voted 4 to 0 in favor of the first reading 
of the plan, with Councilwoman Martha Collison abstaining because she owns 
downtown property. The second and final reading of the plan was passed 3 to 0 
Tuesday night, with Collison again abstaining and Councilman Neil G. 
Fitzpatrick absent. 
</P>
<P>
At a Jan. 10 public hearing before the council, local merchants asked the city 
to postpone a vote on the matter until after an economic impact study could be 
conducted to gauge the effect of the downtown plan. Tim Howell, secretary of 
the Laguna Beach Chamber of Commerce and a vocal downtown plan critic, said the 
study was needed to determine what impact the plan would have on taxes and 
property values. 
</P>
<P>
"Our concern is that this plan does not have any economic or marketing basis," 
Howell said. "This is nothing more than a land-use document." 
</P>
<P>
The council members, concerned that such a study would dictate the plan, 
decided to press on without commissioning a study. City Planning Commissioner 
Becky Jones noted, though, that the downtown plan is to be evaluated for 
problems on a regular basis. She also tried to assure merchants that the city 
would not be inflexible in the implementation of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly do not dictate any color or that you will put this type of plant 
there," Jones said. "We're not trying to create any kind of artificial, 
Disneyland-type main street. We're trying to keep what we have." 
</P>
<P>
But many downtown merchants were skeptical about the city being so tolerant, 
charging that it has been inflexible in the enforcement of controversial sign 
and outdoor-display ordinances adopted in recent years. The ordinances restrict 
the size of signs and prohibit outdoor displays unless they are expressly 
approved. 
</P>
<P>
And as far as preserving downtown's ambiance, the merchants insist that they do 
a good job of that without any outside help. 
</P>
<P>
"We've already made it gorgeous," said one shopkeeper who asked not to be 
identified. "And the city has done nothing." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DOWNTOWN LAGUNA'S NEW LOOK 
</P>
<P>
Here are some provisions of Laguna Beach's new Downtown Specific Plan: 
</P>
<P>
New buildings are restricted to one story, unless second floor houses the 
elderly or artists. 
</P>
<P>
An entire street is set aside for the exclusive use of resident-serving 
businesses such as barbershops, hardware stores and food markets. 
</P>
<P>
Natural materials such as stone, brick, tile and wood are appropriate for 
building use. Simulated materials must be "carefully reviewed for quality." 
</P>
<P>
Clear or lightly tinted glass and glass blocks may be used, but highly 
reflective glass is inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
Marquees should be in scale to the door they cover and the building facade. 
They should not run the length of the facade. Large marquees are inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
The number of colors used on a building should be limited. Too many contrasting 
colors can become "garish." Fluorescent colors "are not appropriate to the 
village character." 
</P>
<P>
Trash and storage areas must be screened by landscaping, fencing, berms or 
other devices. Trash will be collected daily to avoid "intense" odors. 
</P>
<P>
A list of recommended trees, shrubs and flowers will be established. 
</P>
<P>
Alleys should be paved with cobblestones and decorated with street lamps to 
encourage pedestrian use. 
</P>
<P>
Parking meters along Forest Avenue, downtown's main pedestrian thoroughfare, 
should be replaced with a less obtrusive meter.

WOMAN PLEADS GUILTY IN SLAYING OF OFFICIAL'S NIECE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A La Habra woman pleaded guilty Tuesday to first-degree murder for being an 
accomplice in the stabbing death of a niece of Los Angeles County Supervisor 
Kenneth Hahn during a residential robbery. 
</P>
<P>
Michele Molina, 22, also pleaded guilty in Norwalk Superior Court to 
premeditated attempted murder for trying to kill a 19-year-old neighbor of 
Hahn's niece during the same robbery in May, 1987, in La Habra Heights. 
</P>
<P>
Molina remains in custody pending sentencing June 2, when she will be sent to 
state prison for 25 years to life, Los Angeles Deputy Dist. Atty. Paul Rugnetta 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Molina was not the actual killer of Hahn's niece, Ramona Gayton, who was in her 
40s. 
</P>
<P>
Rugnetta said Molina's accomplice, Jose E. Ulivarri, was the person who stabbed 
Gayton to death during the robbery of the home she shared with her psychiatrist 
husband. Ulivarri faces a pretrial conference today. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor said Ulivarri, who was armed with a gun, and Molina also tried 
to strangle Juliette Pecorano, 19, a neighbor who was at Gayton's home during 
the robbery. Pecorano survived. 
</P>
<P>
Pecorano told officials she remembers hearing Gayton screaming, "Run Juliette, 
run for your life," before the two suspects tried to strangle her.

PEDESTRIAN HIT BY TRUCK LOSES PART OF HIS LEG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

A Fountain Valley man apparently out for a morning walk was hit by a pickup 
truck Tuesday and doctors later had to amputate a portion of his mangled right 
leg, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd Gage, 60, was near the curb walking in the north lane of Euclid Street at 
Bellflower Avenue about 6:40 a.m. when he was struck by the truck, according to 
Police Sgt. Larry Griswold. 
</P>
<P>
The driver, a 19-year-old Garden Grove man, was not injured. He was not cited 
pending further investigation of the incident, Griswold said.

LAGUNA BEACH;

<P>
EMERALD BAY ZONING PLAN OKD BY PLANNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The County Planning Commission on Tuesday approved a zoning plan for Emerald 
Bay, an unincorporated beach community; the plan has been stalled for years 
because it does not provide public access to the beach. 
</P>
<P>
Emerald Bay in Laguna Beach has about 500 homes that were largely developed in 
the 1930s and '40s, sealing a stretch of beach off to the public. The 
community's beachfront is between two rocky points that also makes it 
inaccessible from adjacent beaches. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the 1976 Coastal Act, the community was forced to prepare a Local 
Coastal Program that was rejected in 1983 by the state Coastal Commission 
because it did not include public access. The community association, joined by 
the county, subsequently filed suit against the Coastal Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The suit expired last year without reaching trial, partly because of a U.S. 
Supreme Court ruling that restricted the Coastal Commission's ability to 
require developments to provide public beach access. 
</P>
<P>
The community association complained that the only public access would be 
through their private roads and that the traffic it would generate could cause 
hazards on North Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
The Local Coastal Program for Emerald Bay still must be approved by both the 
County Board of Supervisors and the Coastal Commission.

PEOPLE /HERBERT J. VIDA: WHO IS TEACHING ART TODAY? VAN GOGH? ROUSSEAU? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Herbert J. Vida 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pat Everett has such a strong feeling about 19th-Century painters Henri 
Rousseau and Vincent van Gogh that she becomes them. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it would be fabulous to be famous like them and be able to produce 
tremendous amounts of artwork," said the Fullerton housewife, painter and 
special contract art instructor. However, she did grumble about the itchy 
mustache she wears to impersonate Rousseau. 
</P>
<P>
Until her own paintings make her well-known and wealthy, Everett said, she 
becomes the famous painters through makeup, clothes that she buys from a 
Salvation Army store, and also by talking in a deeper voice. 
</P>
<P>
Her work with kindergarten through sixth-grade students in the Fullerton School 
District is financed by the parents and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"This gives me a chance to show young people what the artists actually looked 
like in person and how they dressed, acted and painted," Everett said, noting 
that her impersonations are the result of a trip to a Colonial village where 
people dressed in period clothing. "I thought, 'Now why couldn't I do that and 
make artists come alive for children?' " 
</P>
<P>
So last year at Acacia Elementary School in Fullerton, Everett made her first 
appearance as Dutch painter Van Gogh, clad in a vest, painter's smock and hat. 
And she proceeded to show the fourth-graders whom she had been teaching for 6 
weeks the way it was in the famous artist's lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
"I was nervous the day I did it," she said. "I wondered whether the children 
would accept it." 
</P>
<P>
They did. And since then, Everett has taken on the role of others, including 
American impressionistic painter Mary Cassatt. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easier for me to be a woman," said Everett, 36, a graduate of Chapman 
College and the University of Colorado and the mother of two girls. "I don't 
have to lower my voice." 
</P>
<P>
Despite her discomforts, "it's a kind of a high to become those (artists), and 
through them I can get satisfaction that I have exposed these young students to 
the world of art, color and fantasy." 
</P>
<P>
She also discovered that "I didn't have to be perfect for the children for them 
to get something out of it." 
</P>
<P>
Everett said she doesn't like to delve too much into the artists' personal 
life. Instead, "I get more into style and the way they paint," she explained. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Everett said, "I'd like to get on with my own artwork and paint in 
my own style. Lately, I find myself going to the desert to paint landscapes." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton Fire Department engineer and paramedic Rick Riley, 39, has been named 
Firefighter of the Year by the Fullerton Firefighters Assn. But there are some 
who might think he's out of step with his educational background. 
</P>
<P>
He has an associate of arts degree in police administration from Harbor College 
in Wilmington and a bachelor's degree in criminal justice administration from 
Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"I started out thinking I wanted to be a police officer," the Irvine resident 
said. "But after a while, I decided it just wasn't in keeping with my 
personality. It seemed like people only call the police when they are having a 
bad time with someone." 
</P>
<P>
Riley noted: "Everyone loves firemen." 
</P>
<P>

BONE REPORT DISTURBS MISSING CHILD'S FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN R. CHURM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Angered over reports that bone fragments have been identified as belonging to 
long-missing Laura Bradbury, the grandfather of the Huntington Beach child said 
Tuesday that the family will seek an independent test to verify the findings. 
</P>
<P>
San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department investigators telephoned the missing 
girl's father, Mike Bradbury, on Tuesday and told him that they had 
commissioned a sophisticated DNA analysis of skull fragments found in 1986 in 
the desert. Although Bradbury was told that the tests would not be completed 
for several days, preliminary results indicate a "match," Laura's grandfather 
said late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"They told Mike, at this juncture, it looks like it's going to be a match," 
Dana Winters said of his son-in-law's conversation with sheriff's 
investigators. Winters remarked that it was the first time since early 1986 
that the family had spoken directly with detectives. 
</P>
<P>
The family had expressed anger at the investigators after the first report of 
the DNA test was aired by a Los Angeles television station Friday evening. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Bradbury told representatives of the San Bernardino County Sheriff's 
Department that he would seek a second, independent DNA test, Winters said. 
</P>
<P>
Laura was 3 when she disappeared on a family camping trip to Joshua Tree 
National Monument in 1984 and became the focus of a nationwide search. 
</P>
<P>
Winters said the family had heard that a Northern California laboratory 
conducted the DNA tests on the fragments, which were found in March, 1986, 
about 3 miles from where Laura vanished. 
</P>
<P>
But Ed Blake, a nationally recognized forensic expert, would neither confirm or 
deny that his company, Forensic Science Associates in Richmond, had done any 
testing of bone fragments in the Bradbury case. Blake's firm is one of only 
three private companies in the nation that do DNA analysis, which is also known 
as genetic fingerprinting. 
</P>
<P>
San Bernardino County investigators have had custody of the skullcap and other 
bone fragments since June, 1988, when they "checked them out" of the coroner's 
office, according to Coroner Brian McCormick. McCormick said investigators 
wanted the fragments for "further testing and analysis." 
</P>
<P>
"All we keep hearing are reports that those fragments are Laura's," Winters 
said. "But nobody, not a single individual involved with this investigation, 
has called us. Frankly, even if those test results indicate it's her, we're not 
going to be satisfied." 
</P>
<P>
DNA analysis or print testing in criminal cases is a new, highly technical 
procedure based on the fact that each person's DNA, or genetic material, is 
unique, except in the case of identical twins. Experts in the past have relied 
on matching blood types, for example, for identifying bodies or linking a 
suspect with a victim. But it is a process that is far less reliable than DNA 
analysis. 
</P>
<P>
The DNA print identification test provides for comparisons of genetic codes by 
extracting the DNA from a crime scene specimen, such as semen, blood or tissue, 
and chemically dividing it into fragments. 
</P>
<P>
The fragments form a pattern that serves as an identity profile, which can be 
matched against that of a relative. In the case of Laura Bradbury, the match 
was against her parents, Mike and Patty. Winters said the Bradbury couple 
submitted samples of their blood shortly after the fragments were found. 
Investigators also removed samples of hair from Laura's hairbrush, which can be 
examined and compared to test results from the bone fragments.

LITTLE SAIGON FEARS STOKED BY ARSON; GROUP TAKES BLAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID REYES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Travel agencies in Orange County's Little Saigon that have booked tours to 
Vietnam expressed fear Tuesday, a day after a group calling itself "Special 
Group April 30" claimed responsibility for destroying a Vietnamese travel 
agency by arson. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey look, why do I want my name and the name of my travel agency appearing in 
a newspaper?" a Little Saigon travel agent asked. "Of course we're scared here. 
We also have a mail slot." 
</P>
<P>
The owner was referring to how a container of gasoline was slipped through a 
mail slot to start Friday's 3 a.m. blaze that gutted the Travelworld Agency and 
two adjacent businesses at the corner of Magnolia Street and Westminster 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Owners Feel Intimidated 
</P>
<P>
Many travel agency owners said they feel intimidated and worried by the 
apparent emergence of the so-called Special Group April 30, which sent a letter 
to Vietnamese newspapers Monday, saying it had punished Travelworld for booking 
tours to Vietnam "in collaboration with the butchers of Hanoi." 
</P>
<P>
April 30 is the date that Saigon fell to Communist forces in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
While the group claimed responsibility for only the Travelworld arson, there 
has been a series of unsolved arson attacks against businesses in the Little 
Saigon commercial area. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's fire was started with a gasoline container "near the front door" of 
Travelworld, which is owned by Tran Hung Vuong, who is also know as Victor 
Tran, said Capt. Willie Dumas of the Garden Grove Fire Department. He did not 
elaborate, but Vietnamese travel agency owners who were interviewed said they 
were told by firefighters that a container of gasoline had been slipped through 
a mail slot. 
</P>
<P>
Police in Westminster and Garden Grove said they had not heard of the group but 
fear that the group may be tied to the Party to Exterminate Communists and 
Restore the Nation, a terrorist organization believed to have been responsible 
for at least 10 violent U.S. crimes since January, 1980. 
</P>
<P>
"Philosophically, this new group is in the same place as (the Party to 
Exterminate Communists and Restore the Nation) and probably has some crossover 
members," said Lt. Mike Ratliff, with the Westminster Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent violence by the Party to Exterminate Communists was the Aug. 9, 
1987, firebombing of the Garden Grove office of a Vietnamese-language 
entertainment magazine. Its editor, Tap Van Pham, was killed. 
</P>
<P>
Since the government of Vietnam opened travel to tourists 2 years ago, travel 
agencies in Little Saigon have booked hundreds of tours. Business, which was 
brisk at first, slowed after some county Vietnamese leaders protested that such 
travel helps the Hanoi government and also jeopardizes freedom for thousands of 
Vietnamese exiles in refugee camps who seek entry to the United States because 
they would be persecuted if returned to Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
A Vietnamese community leader said: "We have many Vietnamese refugees living in 
Orange County who qualified to come to the U.S. because they proved they would 
be persecuted if they returned home. If we have a large number going back as 
tourists and visiting relatives in Vietnam, how can the United States believe 
our claims of persecution?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Attack Linked With Tet 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement experts said that although they have not reached firm 
conclusions, the timing of the current attack -- just 2 weeks before Tet, the 
Vietnamese New Year's -- adds fuel to a belief that the arson at Travelworld 
was politically inspired. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my experience that this is a good way to rekindle a fear in the 
community, that with Tet so near, that quite possibly the timing was 
intentional," said Westminster Detective Marcus Frank, an expert on Asian 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
However, Frank and other law enforcement sources said that despite protests 
against travel to Vietnam, there had not been a significant reduction in 
business before Friday's fire. 
</P>
<P>
Travelworld was one of two travel agencies in Little Saigon that had booked an 
increasing number of travel requests to Vietnam. The other agency was forced to 
file a lawsuit last year after demonstrators prevented customers from entering 
the office during weekly protests. 
</P>
<P>
Dumas, the Garden Grove Fire Department arson investigator, said his department 
had not received the letter from the group claiming responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Is It 'a Real Group'? 
</P>
<P>
"We don't even know if that's a real group or not," he said. "It could be 
anybody claiming responsibility. It's still too early in the investigation." 
</P>
<P>
Damage to Tran's offices and the adjacent businesses was estimated at $400,000.

LAST CHARGES DISMISSED IN NEWPORT DRUG CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A controversial case involving a confiscated boatload of marijuana in 1985 -- 
the largest drug seizure in Newport Beach history -- ended Tuesday with 
dismissal of charges against the fourth and final defendant. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor Municipal Court Judge Frances Munoz dismissed the case after the 
prosecutor said he could not proceed against defendant Bruce Patrick Malley 
because a witness was missing. 
</P>
<P>
Later, outside the courtroom, Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. Tom Borris said 
his office has given up trying to prosecute anyone in the case. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a shame we were unable to prosecute, but at least $22 million in drugs 
have been kept off the streets," Borris said. 
</P>
<P>
Five tons of marijuana were seized from the Sea Dolphin, a boat that was tied 
up at a Newport Beach municipal slip. Estimates of the street value of the 
marijuana have ranged from $13 million to $22 million. The marijuana smuggling 
cases against the three previous defendants were dismissed after a judge ruled 
that police had no legal authority to search the sailboat. That ruling, later 
upheld by a state appellate court, reportedly sparked a feud between the Harbor 
Court judges and Newport Beach police. 
</P>
<P>
Borris on Tuesday declined to identify or give any details about the missing 
witness. "The witness was not a key witness, but part of a chain of witnesses, 
and when any part of that chain is missing, we could not proceed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Borris said he objected to the dismissal of the case, he added that it 
might as well end in Municipal Court at the preliminary hearing level "because 
we could not have proceeded in Superior Court without this witness." 
</P>
<P>
The affair began on Jan. 21, 1985, when a Newport Beach police officer spotted 
the 45-foot Sea Dolphin tied to a city slip and resting low in the water. There 
is a 20-minute time limit for the use of such slips, and the officer cited 
people aboard the sailboat for staying too long. Police then made a search of 
the vessel and discovered the huge cache of marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
The three original defendants in the case were Richard W. Nelson, Victor Paul 
Lucini and David Paul Choy. Their lawyers successfully argued that the 
20-minute-limit sign at the slip was not clearly posted. Thus, the lawyers 
said, the police never had a basis for searching the boat. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor Municipal Judge Russell A. Bostrom was the first judge to rule that the 
search of the Sea Dolphin was unconstitutional. Bostrom's ruling, later upheld 
by the state Court of Appeal, reportedly triggered a feud between Newport Beach 
police and the Harbor Municipal Court, several sources have told The Times 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Investigation of Judges 
</P>
<P>
The sources also said the feud ultimately led to the investigation of some of 
the Harbor Court judges, including Municipal Judge Brian R. Carter. Carter, who 
has been under investigation by the state Commission on Judicial Performance, 
announced earlier this month that he will resign in February. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth defendant, Malley, 32, a commercial artist from Santa Cruz, was not 
arrested with the original three from the Sea Dolphin. Police had a fugitive 
warrant for him, and Malley turned himself into Harbor Municipal Court on Dec. 
21, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Malley's attorney, Robert Weinberg, on Tuesday sharply criticized the district 
attorney's office for trying to prosecute Malley. "The district attorney said 
there would be new evidence, when in fact there was not," Weinberg said. "Mr. 
Malley went through needless anxiety and legal expense." 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach Police Officer Bob Oakley, a spokesman for the department, on 
Tuesday said the dismissal of the case against the final defendant "was not 
exactly unexpected in view of the (earlier) decisions to disallow the 
evidence." Oakley said the rulings that the boat search was made illegally had 
in effect thrown out the evidence in the case.

Leslie Rathbun scored 5 of her 20 points and played tough defense in the fourth 
quarter as Woodbridge High School scored a 50-46 victory over Trabuco Hills on 
Tuesday in a Pacific Coast League girls' basketball game at Trabuco Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Woodbridge (15-5 overall, 5-0 in league play) trailed Trabuco Hills, 34-30, 
after three quarters. The Mustangs (11-6, 4-1) got their biggest lead of the 
game, 38-31, 22 seconds into the fourth quarter. But the Warriors cut the lead 
to 40-39 in the next 3 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
After Marta Bickert's field goal and DeDe Sampson's free throw extended Trabuco 
Hills' lead to 43-39 with 4 minutes left, Kris Willis scored on an inside drive 
and free throw to cut the lead to 43-42. 
</P>
<P>
With 2:57 left, Rathbun, who had stolen the ball from Sampson, hit an outside 
bank shot to give the Warriors a 44-43 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Woodbridge built its lead to 50-43 and did not allow another Trabuco Hills 
point until Bickert hit a 3-point shot with 13 seconds left.

CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTEBOOK / ROBYN NORWOOD; 
</P>
<P>
JERRY BROWN LEARNS QUICKLY AS ASSISTANT WITH VIKINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robyn Norwood 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After 8 seasons as an assistant to Gene Murphy, Jerry Brown traded football 
Saturdays for football Sundays last year. 
</P>
<P>
After a wait that might have been longer than it should have, he got his chance 
in the pros, landing a job as an assistant with the Minnesota Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
It was a hiring hailed as encouraging because Brown is black. But more telling 
was a comment from the Vikings, who said they were so impressed with Brown that 
color wasn't an issue: They would have hired him if he were green. 
</P>
<P>
Brown was in Fullerton last week, "back to thaw out a bit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He was back to see his old buddies at the Titan football house, who were eager 
to razz him about being a big-time coach in the National Football League. 
</P>
<P>
"They give me a hard time," Brown said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said his first season in the NFL was difficult, particularly at the 
start. 
</P>
<P>
On the first day of practice with Viking veterans, Brown told them they knew 
the playbook better than he did. "I may need your help," he told them. "But it 
won't remain that way." 
</P>
<P>
"It was very tough at first," Brown said. "I had to learn a new system. It's 
almost like going to another country knowing nothing of the language, then 
learning it and trying to teach it at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
Plus, there was the change from coaching college athletes to coaching 
professional athletes -- Viking receivers such as Anthony Carter, Hassan Jones 
and Leo Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
"At first I thought in my mind that (the players) would be very different, that 
these guys would have gigantic egos and say, 'Here comes the college coach,' " 
Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
But he adjusted soon enough. 
</P>
<P>
"As the year was going on, I always found myself comparing pro ball to college 
ball. Do you give these guys a pep talk like you do college players? Do you pat 
them on the butt? Do you pull out little articles? 
</P>
<P>
"Early on, I wouldn't do those things. But I think pro players need to be 
motivated too." 
</P>
<P>
It was a season that Brown enjoyed -- "I love the games, I love them," he said 
-- but it was one that ended disappointingly for the Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
"Early on, the Vikings' people were talking Super-Bowl type team," Brown said. 
"I didn't have anything to compare it to then. But as the year went on, I 
started to see that this was a team capable of being in the Super Bowl. . . . 
Hopefully, we will be next year." 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings' chances began to fall apart. There were two losses to the Green 
Bay Packers, and a regular-season loss to the San Francisco 49ers that Brown 
called "a golden opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
And there was the final playoff game against the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
"That second 49er game was like running into a wall because all of sudden, it's 
done," he said. "You never think you're going to be done until you get to the 
Super Bowl, and then suddenly it's over, and you don't have to worry about 
practicing or preparing for a game or anything the next day." 
</P>
<P>
Brown had been at Fullerton since Murphy came to the school in 1980, and during 
that time had risen from receivers coach to offensive coordinator to associate 
head coach. 
</P>
<P>
His ties with Fullerton remain. 
</P>
<P>
After the college season ended, Brown sent Murphy a plane ticket and a game 
ticket for the Monday game against the Chicago Bears. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't give him a choice," Brown said. "It was one of my ways of repaying 
him for having so much faith in me there at Fullerton. Murphy is one of my best 
friends." 
</P>
<P>
That relationship might soon expand. Brown has a nephew, Michael, who is a 
talented defensive back coming out of Roosevelt High School in Kent, Ohio. He 
is considering Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said he thinks he will continue to coach in the pros, rather than return 
to college coaching. 
</P>
<P>
The hours were longer at Fullerton, Brown remembered, but they were enjoyable. 
</P>
<P>
"(At Fullerton), everybody knows what they've got to do, but it never seems 
like work," Brown said. "Whereas here, it's kind of like you're in the business 
world. The thing that's most important is that you win. If you don't win, you 
don't have a job, and they make no bones about it." 
</P>
<P>
The men's basketball team has been sporting a new look lately -- a matchup zone 
defense, and most recently, a fullcourt zone press and up-tempo game. 
</P>
<P>
So, too, has Coach John Sneed, who for 2 games wore a hair style that was 
alternately called the Pat Riley-look and the Eddie Munster-look. 
</P>
<P>
The team's new look apparently is the more permanent of the two. 
</P>
<P>
"I came up with a new look," Sneed said. "I scrapped the hairdo." 
</P>
<P>
That effectively put an end to a deal struck between Sneed and forward Derek 
Jones. If Sneed could look like Riley, the bargain went, Jones was to play like 
James Worthy. 
</P>
<P>
When Kohn Smith, Utah State's first-year head coach, implied that his team's 
loss against Fullerton might have been caused by a letdown because of playing 
in Titan Gym 2 nights after playing in Nevada Las Vegas' Thomas &amp; Mack 
Center, he didn't endear himself to Sneed. 
</P>
<P>
"To me that was so bush," Sneed said. "If you get your butt beat, you get your 
butt beat. That's all there is to it. We have problems when we play at Utah 
State, not because of the arena but because of the environment and the 
altitude. But if we get beat, we don't say it was because of the altitude."

AST REPORTS BIG LOSS, LAYS OFF 70 WORKERS IN ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGORY CROUCH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AST Research Inc. in Irvine, buffeted by increasing competition in the personal 
computer industry, laid off 70 Orange County workers Tuesday and reported an 
$8.9-million loss for the quarter ended Dec. 30. 
</P>
<P>
The company said it handed out pink slips Monday night and Tuesday morning to 
70 management, marketing and assembly employees in Irvine. The terminations 
took effect immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Another 20 Orange County positions that were vacated last month through 
attrition will not be filled, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, AST said it is eliminating 30 positions in other areas of the 
United States and overseas through a combination of layoffs and attrition, 
bringing the total work force reduction to 120. 
</P>
<P>
As of Dec. 30, AST had 1,234 employees in Orange County and 2,025 workers 
worldwide. The company said the dismissed employees would receive severance 
pay. 
</P>
<P>
Several employees contacted Tuesday said they had expected the layoffs after 
AST announced earlier this month that it would report a sizable loss for its 
fiscal 1989 second quarter, which ended Dec. 30. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been rumors for the last 3 weeks to a month about layoffs," said 
Lloyd Allsopp, a worker at AST's Irvine manufacturing facility. Allsopp was not 
laid off. 
</P>
<P>
AST said it lost $8.9 million on revenue of $110.9 million for the 3 months. 
The company earned $2 million on revenue of $92.6 million in the same quarter a 
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
AST's announcement did not surprise Wall Street. Several high-technology 
companies have announced personnel cutbacks in the last few weeks, including 
Western Digital Corp. in Irvine and Wyse Technology in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
Western Digital, Orange County's largest technology company, said 2 weeks ago 
that it will lay off 200 permanent employees and 90 contract workers in Irvine 
by the end of March. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Company Has Problems' 
</P>
<P>
"AST's action doesn't come as a surprise," said Lawrence Harris, an analyst 
with the Los Angeles brokerage of Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards. "The company 
has some problems." 
</P>
<P>
AST President Safi Qureshey was unavailable for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1980, AST got its start making printed circuit boards that increased 
the memory and other features of IBM-compatible personal computers. Then, in 
1987, AST started selling its own line of personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
About a third of AST's second-quarter loss stems from a write-down of the 
recorded value of assets of the company's Camintonn division, which makes 
products for systems compatible with Digital Equipment Corp. computers. 
</P>
<P>
AST has said it would like to sell Camintonn. The company took the write-down, 
said Finance Vice President Jerry Ulrich because AST believes that the price it 
eventually receives for Camintonn will be about $3 million below the stated 
value of the division's assets. 
</P>
<P>
Another $2.6-million loss reserve was booked in the second quarter to account 
for the cost of employee severance packages and a drop in the value of some of 
AST's inventory. 
</P>
<P>
"Given current market conditions, we believe some of the inventory (will sell) 
at a lower price than originally believed," said Ulrich. 
</P>
<P>
The remainder of the loss was attributed to costly marketing strategies adopted 
by AST to try to keep its customers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Protecting Market Share 
</P>
<P>
For example, the company began offering bulk discounts in the second quarter to 
dealers who carry AST personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
"We are still relatively new in the marketplace, and we are trying to protect 
our market share," said Ulrich. "We believe in the long run that these price 
incentives will pay dividends as we come into the marketplace with new 
products." 
</P>
<P>
Personal computer manufacturers other than the Big 3 -- IBM, Apple and Compaq 
-- have suffered in the last 6 months as new technology has made some of their 
products outdated. IBM recently started selling a type of personal computer 
similar to those marketed by AST and other secondary computer makers, touching 
off a price war. 
</P>
<P>
AST's marketing strategy has been to underprice its bigger competitors. That 
strategy allowed the company to capture a 13.4% of the personal computer 
market, but its bottom line is beginning to be affected, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
"They have a good product, but there is a lot of other good product out there," 
said Jay Vleeschhouwer, an analyst with the New York brokerage of Bear Stearns. 
"So the AST way to win customers was to cut prices, but it's hurt them." 
</P>
<P>
Several analysts said AST should return to profitability in about 6 months as 
some of its newer products infiltrate the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
AST announced the layoffs and second-quarter loss after the end of trading on 
Tuesday. The company's stock closed at $8 a share, up 12.5 cents.

Richard V. Rupp's habit of picking up trade publications and other reference 
materials in the insurance field has led to another new business -- an 
insurance library. 
</P>
<P>
Rupp decided recently to get out of his risk management consulting business in 
Costa Mesa to become a full-time employee of Earthquake Mutual Insurance Co., 
which he formed a year ago to provide low-priced earthquake insurance coverage. 
</P>
<P>
But he had to do something with the 1,200-square-foot library he had built up 
over the years. So he formed Rupp Risk Management Resource Center, which will 
operate under the direction of his wife, Coleen A. Mulhern. 
</P>
<P>
The library contains about 90 trade journals, 900 reference books, 26 principal 
insurance subject categories with more than 2,500 specific subject files, 
special reports and access to a computer information retrieval system. 
</P>
<P>
The library, which Rupp believes is the West Coast's largest library devoted to 
insurance matters, will handle research for insurers, large corporations, 
accountants, lawyers and other risk management consultants. 
</P>
<P>
Rupp hopes to attract professionals to the library with annual subscriber fees 
of $600.

Two Irvine accounting firms that were part of a trade magazine's Top 50 
mid-size firms nationwide were not ranked individually within that group. 
</P>
<P>
Corbin &amp; Wertz said it was eighth on the list compiled by CPA Digest, a 
trade publication that compiles its Top 50 list from such factors as growth, 
client service, personnel management and community service. 
</P>
<P>
But information provided by Yoder, Kushner &amp; Co., the other Irvine firm, 
shows that the publication simply listed the best 50 firms in alphabetical 
order and did not rank them individually. In the listing, the Yoder firm was 
known as Hansen, Kushner &amp; Co.

BERGEN BRUNSWIG TO CLOSE 2 WAREHOUSES IN COUNTY, TRANSFER WORKERS TO CORONA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Bergen Brunswig Corp., a pharmaceutical distribution company based in Orange, 
said Tuesday that it will close its two warehouses in Anaheim and Buena Park 
next year and transfer up to 125 local workers to a new facility in Corona in 
Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
A third distribution center in San Bernardino will also be closed as part of a 
plan to consolidate and modernize operations in Orange, Riverside and San 
Bernardino counties. 
</P>
<P>
Urs Aeberli, who will be manager of the Corona warehouse, said population 
growth in the region has generated a demand for pharmaceutical supplies that is 
straining Bergen Brunswig's facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The Corona warehouse, expected to be completed in April, 1990, will be the 
largest of Bergen Brunswig's 37 distribution centers nationwide at 231,000 
square feet. 
</P>
<P>
Corona was selected as the site for the new facility because it is centrally 
located to serve the three-county region, Aeberli said. 
</P>
<P>
Company spokesman John T. Fay Jr., said the company's strategy is "to increase 
efficiency by having much larger and more automated facilities." He said the 
company's long-term goal is to cut the number of distribution centers to 20 by 
building one or two large, automated centers every year and closing old ones. 
</P>
<P>
The new warehouse will be 20 miles from the existing warehouse in Anaheim and 
25 miles from the one in Buena Park. 
</P>
<P>
Aeberli, who lives in Riverside, said most of the company's Orange County 
warehouse workers do not consider their future transfer to Corona a hardship. 
He noted that many of the people who work at the Orange County facilities 
already live in Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Besst, an inventory coordinator in Bergen Brunswig's Buena Park warehouse, 
lives in Stanton, only 5 miles from work. He said he and some co-workers are 
considering moving closer to Corona to take advantage of lower real estate 
prices outside Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a 30-year-old house now, and for the same price I can get a larger 
house in the Riverside/Corona area that is brand new," he said.

NYCO DOES WELL, BUT CENTER GETS GRANT OF UP TO $750,000 FOR SHORTFALL 
</P>

Officials of the Orange County Performing Arts Center on Tuesday announced a 
grant of up to $750,000 from the Harry and Grace Steele Foundation of Newport 
Beach to subsidize the recent engagement of the New York City Opera. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation had intended to fill a projected gap between ticket sales and 
the costs of mounting the NYCO productions of "Rigoletto," "Die Zauberflote" 
and "The Merry Widow," according to Center President Thomas R. Kendrick. Box 
office revenues "can never meet the costs of presenting grand opera, even when 
performances sell out," Kendrick explained. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the "extraordinary" paid attendance of more than 90%, however, the 
actual shortfall should be much less than the $750,000 provided by the grant, 
Kendrick said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Kendrick said his best estimate of the gap is "more than $500,000." The Center 
will submit bills directly to the Steele Foundation, and the foundation will 
keep the difference, he said. 
</P>
<P>
More than 20,000 Southland residents attended the seven performances of the 
operas, which received mixed reviews. 
</P>
<P>
The Steele Foundation subsidized the first West Coast performance of the New 
York City Opera in 1987 at the Center's inaugural. The foundation also donated 
$1 million to the Center's construction campaign and $2 million more in 1984 in 
the form of a challenge grant that generated more than $7.5 million in cash, 
pledge commitments and deferred gifts to the Center.

MUSIC AND DANCE / CHRIS PASLES: GARDEN GROVE CONDUCTOR FINDS 'UNIVERSAL 
LANGUAGE' WORKS IN BULGARIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It took only a week for Garden Grove Symphony conductor Edward Peterson to 
become close to members of the Pazardzhik Philharmonic of Bulgaria, which he 
recently conducted as part of a conductor-exchange program. 
</P>
<P>
"I was apprehensive about going into an Eastern Bloc country, not quite knowing 
what to expect and me not speaking the same language as the group in front of 
me," Peterson said recently. 
</P>
<P>
"But as the rehearsals went on during the week, it was a growing process of 
communication. What is the old adage: 'Music is universal'? If I didn't believe 
it before, there is no question in my mind how true that is now. . . . I became 
very close to them by the middle of the week." 
</P>
<P>
Peterson flew to Bulgaria around Thanksgiving to lead the Pazardzhik orchestra 
in a program of American music as the first half of an exchange program 
initiated by Barbara Ness, the orchestra's general manager, while she was on 
summer vacation in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Pazardzhik conductor Ivan Spassov will reciprocate by leading the Garden Grove 
Symphony in Orange County in October. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson, who will conduct the Garden Grove Symphony on Saturday for the first 
time since his Bulgarian excursion, had selected a program of music by 
Gershwin, Bernstein, Barber, Copland and Ives for the Bulgarian performances. 
The idea, he said, was to offer "a wide range of music, from serious to light, 
to give them a taste for America." 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, other than Barber's "Adagio for Strings," every piece was a 
premiere for the orchestra. Ironically, the only reason they knew the Barber 
piece, which they had played on one of their own programs, was from its use in 
the movie "Platoon." 
</P>
<P>
Virtually all of the other works on the program called for a full-size 
orchestra, something that is generally taken for granted in the United States. 
In Pazardzhik, however, it meant sending out for reinforcements. 
</P>
<P>
"In Bulgaria, everything is taken care of by the government, but some strings 
are attached," Peterson explained. "Sometimes they step in and set some 
parameters that don't always make sense. The size of the orchestra is set not 
by the conductor deciding how large the group is going to be and building the 
orchestra up, but rather by the size of the city or the town." 
</P>
<P>
Because Pazardzhik has about 70,000 people, Peterson said, the size of the 
orchestra is set at about 60. 
</P>
<P>
"That is what they are allowed to hire," he said. "Basically, they do a lot of 
Mozart, Haydn, maybe early Beethoven symphonies with smaller instrumentation. 
They are not able to perform (works by) a lot of the late Romantics . . . " 
which can require 100 or more players. 
</P>
<P>
"Just to do the things we did on that concert, we had to bring in some extra 
trombones, tuba and saxophones, and those musicians had to drive in 2 hours 
from (the Bulgarian capital of) Sofia to be able to do this. But they were 
willing . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Peterson still could not round up all the musicians he needed and had 
to abandon plans to play Gershwin's "American in Paris" and Copland's 
"Appalachian Spring." 
</P>
<P>
Peterson encountered more than just musician shortages in the country. "You see 
empty shelves in a store . . . people standing in meat lines, waiting for a 
store to open to sell fresh bread or meat, until they run out and then they 
close the doors again," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the hotel he stayed in -- the Novotel Plovdiv -- offered conveniences 
such as a spa and a sauna, meals could prove limited, according to Peterson. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd go into the restaurant and order something off the menu, and the waiter 
would point to an item and say, 'That's what we have today,' or "We're out of 
Coke today.' " 
</P>
<P>
Peterson said he also came across two luxury-item stores that would not even 
accept Bulgarian currency -- only American dollars. But how do the citizens get 
American dollars? 
</P>
<P>
"The black market is incredible," Peterson said. "You are constantly approached 
by Bulgarians on the streets because they want to get American dollars. You get 
very popular if you are tipping with American dollars. But tipping is actually 
looked down upon, so you don't do it in the open." 
</P>
<P>
Peterson said he also was surprised at the political interest the Bulgarians 
showed. "I was asked more times about Michael Dukakis and George Bush than you 
can imagine," he said. "They really keep up with politics more than we think 
they do. Things American interest them very much." 
</P>
<P>
But there were few lacks in the musicianship of the orchestra. "The musicians 
could have been musicians sitting in any place in the world," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And apparently the feeling was reciprocal. One day, Peterson was called over to 
a group of musicians crowded around the concertmaster and his new acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
"They called me over and stepped back. The concertmaster had just picked up a 
brand new car that morning. They informed me that I had a godchild: They had 
named the car the 'Peterson.' " 
</P>
<P>
The public's reaction to the American program was "very positive," he said. 
"But the emotional high for the audience was when we played a special Bulgarian 
tune that we had arranged before going over there. I don't know all the 
significance of that particular tune ('How Beautiful You Are -- My Old 
Forest'). I suppose it would be close to, in America, suddenly pulling up 'God 
Bless America' and inviting the audience to join and sing. 
</P>
<P>
"Turning to the audience halfway through the piece, I saw literally the entire 
auditorium join in. It was a packed auditorium, of, I believe, 750 to 800 
people. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I think that is something I will carry with me through the rest of my life, 
just the emotional highs. I felt as close to that orchestra as to my own group 
over here." 
</P>
<P>
 Edward Peterson will conduct the Garden Grove Symphony in music of Sibelius, 
Prokofiev, Tchaikovsky and others at 8 p.m. on Saturday at the Don Wash 
Auditorium, 11271 Stanford Ave., in Garden Grove. Featured soloist will be 
violinist Mischa Lefkowitz. Tickets: $10-$25; students and seniors, $7. 
Information: (714) 534-1103.

President Bush, distancing himself from perceived "sleazy" official conduct in 
the Reagan era, today set up an eight-member advisory commission to help draft 
proposed ethics legislation for federal employees. 
</P>
<P>
Bush issued an executive order to create the ethics panel, headed by retired 
U.S. Judge Malcolm Wilkey and former Atty. Gen. Griffin B. Bell. Bush, who 
began his first week as chief executive on Monday by lecturing his staff on the 
need for integrity, scheduled a meeting with Wilkey and Bell to discuss what he 
wanted the commission to do.

Walt Disney Co. today said earnings in its first fiscal quarter rose 48% from 
the year-earlier period to a record $148.3 million, boosted by higher profits 
from its theme parks and resorts. 
</P>
<P>
The figures surprised Wall Street analysts, prompting some to revise their 
estimates for what the entertainment company would earn in the full fiscal 
year. Disney shares on the New York Stock Exchange rose 50 cents to $72. "They 
basically knocked the cover off the ball at the theme parks," said Drexel 
Burnham Lambert Inc. analyst Andrew Wallach.

Michael Milken, the head of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s junk bond department, 
is to leave the company as part of an agreement between Drexel and federal 
prosecutors, according to court documents released today. 
</P>
<P>
Milken, who has headed Drexel's high-yield securities department in Beverly 
Hills, is credited with virtually inventing the market in junk bonds, 
securities that offer high returns but higher risk than investment-grade bonds. 
</P>
<P>
The disclosure came in court documents that are part of Drexel's agreement to 
plead guilty to six felonies and pay a record $650 million. The documents were 
unsealed at the U.S. District Court in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the talks between Drexel and the government said Milken's 
ouster from the company was one of the conditions being demanded by the 
government. A source close to the investigation earlier told Reuters that 
Milken will be indicted on criminal charges this week. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the agreement, Milken, 42, will leave without pay, including a 
multimillion-dollar bonus for work done in 1988.

A school bus rolled into a creek today, killing the driver and critically 
injuring an 8-year-old, but a heroic high school sophomore helped lead 10 other 
students to safety through the emergency door, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The Wellsville School District bus had run off a muddy dirt road into Walnut 
Creek, investigators said. They said the front end went into the water and 11 
passengers escaped out the rear before the bus rolled the rest of the way in, 
trapping driver Dale Thomasson, 46, and Loren Newkirk Jr. The boy was pulled 
out by rescue workers and hospitalized in critical condition after spending 
more than 30 minutes underwater. Sheriff's deputies credited teen-ager Bill 
Raley with leading younger children out of the bus.

A Briton was dragged out of Pope John Paul II's general audience today after he 
jumped up, screamed "I am the son of God, I am Christ!" and told the Pope: 
"I'll take your place."

<P>
Security men, papal Swiss Guards and stewards immobilized the man after he 
rushed to an aisle from a seat at the back of the hall and appeared to head 
toward the stage where the Pope was sitting. Witnesses said the man, identified 
as Joseph McGovern, 23, of London, also claimed to have received revelations 
about the end of the world. McGovern was held for questioning but a Vatican

Prosecutors today searched the offices of 14 West German companies suspected of 
helping Libya build a chemical weapons factory, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the prosecutor's office in Offenburg, Hubertus Voegele, said 
one of the firms searched was Imhausen-Chemie in Lahr, which is suspected of 
playing a major role in building and equipping the Libyan plant. 
</P>
<P>
Voegele said the searches were conducted "on suspicion that export laws had 
been violated." He declined to name the other firms whose offices were 
searched, but added they were located throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government says the plant at Rabta, 60 miles south of the Libyan 
capital of Tripoli, was built to make poison gas. Libya says it will 
manufacture medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Bonn officials initially dismissed the U.S. allegations, but have now launched 
a criminal investigation to determine if Imhausen-Chemie and other companies 
illegally shipped arms, hazardous substances or components that can be used to 
produce them. 
</P>
<P>
The affair has deeply embarrassed the West German government.

After 19 years of having homosexual speakers discuss their life styles with 
students in the Newport-Mesa Unified School District, the district's 
superintendent has decided to ban the program because he said it is no longer 
necessary for the school's curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
District Supt. John W. Nicoll reversed his earlier decision on the gay speakers 
last Thursday, after a group of about 70 parents mounted opposition to the 
discussions held in Mike Marino's psychology class with Corona del Mar High 
School students. 
</P>
<P>
"While I firmly believe that Mr. Marino should continue this instruction in his 
classes, I did not think that the invitation of speakers in the subject of 
homosexuality -- people who are not educators or specialists, but people 
representing a point of view -- should continue, " Nicoll said today. 
</P>
<P>
Marino taught the class at Newport Harbor High School for eight years before 
going to Corona del Mar, where he has been teaching the class for 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
"The speakers have altered the students' thinking and misguided notions of the 
situation (of homosexuality), and that's what education is all about," Marino 
said today.

SMITHKLINE BECKMAN PRESIDENT QUITS AS SALES SAG, PROFITS FALL 60%

<P>
SmithKline Beckman Corp. said today its president has resigned amid differences 
over the direction of the giant health-care company at a time when it is faced 
with sagging sales of its blockbuster ulcer drug and takeover rumors. 
</P>
<P>
George W. Ebright's resignation coincided with the release of SmithKline's 
earnings, which showed a 60% drop in the company's 1988 profit. 
</P>
<P>
Ebright's resignation is effective immediately, the company said. His duties 
will be assumed by Henry Wendt, SmithKline's chairman and chief executive 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
"George and I have had differences on matters of corporate policy. 
Nevertheless, I accept his resignation with deep regret," Wendt said in a 
prepared statement. He added that Ebright "has played a major role in the 
diversification of SmithKline Beckman and the building of our businesses." 
</P>
<P>
SmithKline said its fourth-quarter net income rose 12% to $159.4 million, or 
$1.28 a share, from $141.9 million, or $1.14 a share in the year-earlier 
quarter. Revenue rose to $1.3 billion from $1.2 billion in the 1987 period. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth-quarter figures were bolstered by income from the partial spin-off 
of Beckman Instruments, which brought in $46.1 million, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Future Direction 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Ebright's abrupt resignation probably stemmed from differences 
with Wendt over the future direction of the company. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Ebright was probably in favor of retaining control at the top and Mr. 
Wendt was probably in favor of more independence of the units," said Ronald M. 
Nordmann, a stock analyst with PaineWebber. 
</P>
<P>
Ebright, who also was chief operating officer, stood to lose responsibility 
with any independence given to the individual units, Nordmann said. 
</P>
<P>
Ebright, 51, who became president in April, 1987, joined the company in 1963 in 
the accounting department. Wendt, 55, became chairman the same month, 32 years 
after joining SmithKline's international marketing division.

Dissidents within Amerco Inc., the holding company which operates the U-Haul 
rental network, have negotiated the proposed sale of the company to an 
unidentified buyer for about $1 billion, the founder has confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard S. Shoen, 71, who organized U-Haul in 1945 in a Seattle suburb and 
moved the headquarters here in 1968, declined to identify the buyer and said he 
was speaking up because he feels that current management has undervalued stock 
in soliciting for more shares. 
</P>
<P>
Amerco is a Nevada-chartered company based in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Amerco Chairman E. J. (Joe) Shoen, the third of Leonard Shoen's 12 children,

Klinefelter, said today that the board of directors has not been told of any 
purchase offer.

Heritage Entertainment Inc. said today that it has agreed to purchase Seven 
Gables Corp., a Seattle theater exhibition company. 
</P>
<P>
The acquisition of Gables and its 34 screens is the second part of Los 
Angeles-based Heritage's previous expansion into the exhibition industry with 
the purchase of Landmark Theatre Corp., the Los Angeles-based, 43-screen 
theater chain. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the deal involve payment to certain preferred holders of 500,000 
shares of Heritage common stock and additional shares -- estimated at between 
300,000 and 600,000 -- to holders of Renaissance Entertainment Inc. common 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
The final determination of that amount will depend on the proceeds resulting 
from the satisfaction of Gables' $9.6-million antitrust judgment against 
Sterling Recreation Organization.

'88 HOUSING SALES RISE TO 9-YEAR RECORD

Sales of existing houses rose in 1988 to the highest level in nine years, but 
climbing costs caused buyers to choose lower-priced houses, a national real 
estate group said today. 
</P>
<P>
The National Assn. of Realtors said 3.63 million single-family houses were 
resold in 1988 for a 2.9% increase from 1987, the highest level since 3.83 
million in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
It said sales of existing houses rose 11.4% in December from November to 4.09 
million units at an annual rate. 
</P>
<P>
Demand continued strong, but high prices and an increase in mortgage interest 
rates at the end of last year meant that the biggest gains were in lower-priced 
houses, the group said. 
</P>
<P>
During 1988, a buying shift occurred in favor of the Midwest and South over the 
relatively expensive markets in the Northeast, John Tuccillo, the group's chief 
economist, said. 
</P>
<P>
"The demand for home ownership is being fulfilled at the lower end of the 
market," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Demand Is There' 
</P>
<P>
"For the most part, people seem to be buying less expensive homes. The demand 
is there," said Ira Gribin, president of the association. 
</P>
<P>
Interest rates were moderately higher at the end of the year from early 1988 
but did rise significantly from a dip in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. said fixed-rate loans were at 10.77% and 
adjustable-rate loans 8.49% at the end of December, compared to 10.61% and 
7.95% in January 1988. 
</P>
<P>
December rates were up from a drop in early March, however, when fixed-rate 
loans were 9.85% and adjustable-rate loans were 7.53%. 
</P>
<P>
The median price of an existing house nationwide fell last month to $87,700 
from $88,000 in November but was up from $85,400 in December, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The median sales price in 1988 rose 4.1% from the previous year to $89,100. 
</P>
<P>
The December rise in house resales was the biggest month-to-month increase 
since April, 1986, with the biggest increases in the pace occurring in the 
Midwest and South. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
South Rises Again 
</P>
<P>
Last month's increase in sales followed three months in which the level was 
unchanged at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.67 million units. 
</P>
<P>
Sales rose 15.8% in the South, 10.4% in the Midwest, 4.5% in the West and 4.4% 
in the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
Median prices last month rose in the Northeast to $143,300 from $140,700 in 
November and rose to $67,800 from $66,700 in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
Prices fell to $117,800 from $128,900 in the West and fell to $78,500 from 
$80,300 in the South.

Organizers of this year's University Games have asked Seoul, host to the 1988 
Olympics, to replace Sao Paulo as host due to Brazil's financial problems, the 
South Korean sports ministry said today. 
</P>
<P>
The request was made at a meeting of the International University Sports 
Federation in Rome last week, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"One of our delegates to the meeting received the request, but we have not made 
our position known yet," he said, adding that Seoul is likely to reject the 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
"If we host the University Games just one year after the Olympics, the people 
may not accept it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand many countries do not want to host the Universiad for fear that 
the games, with a small television revenue, will be unprofitable." 
</P>
<P>
Sao Paulo was named to stage the 1989 University Games in a general meeting of 
the international federation in Zagreb, Yugoslavia, in August, 1987.

Florence Griffith Joyner, the Queen of Seoul, who orchestrated three golden 
hits and one silver at the Summer Olympics and authored two record-smashing 
performances during 1988, today was named Associated Press Female Athlete of 
the Year. 
</P>
<P>
Griffith Joyner kept the award in the family. Her sister-in-law, Jackie 
Joyner-Kersee, was the 1987 winner. 
</P>
<P>
"FloJo" brought attention to herself not only with sensational accomplishments 
on the track, but also with her dazzling racing attire, her mandarin-like 
fingernails, her flashy rings, her flowing hair and her radiant smile. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it was her track performances that earned Griffith Joyner the award over 
such outstanding candidates as West German Steffi Graf, only the third women's 
tennis player to win the Grand Slam; Joyner-Kersee, a double Olympic gold 
medalist; American Olympic swimming star Janet Evans; East German Katarina 
Witt, the Olympic figure skating gold medalist, and East German Kristin Otto, 
winner of six Olympic swimming gold medals. 
</P>
<P>
Griffith Joyner, who won Olympic gold medals in the 100-meter and 200-meter 
dashes and the 400-meter relay, along with a silver in the 1,600-meter relay 
and set world records in the 100 and 200 during 1988, collected 549 points in 
balloting by a national panel of 155 sports writers and broadcasters. She 
received 78 first-place votes, 48 seconds and 15 thirds. Points were alloted on 
a 5-3-1 basis. 
</P>
<P>
Graf, winner of the U.S., French and Australian opens and Wimbledon, along with 
the Olympic gold medal, completing a "Golden Slam," finished second with 420 
points.

American League owners have rejected Edward Gaylord's attempt to purchase 
majority interest in the Texas Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
Gaylord, of Oklahoma City, owns about one-third of the Rangers' stock and wants 
to buy an additional 58%. Baseball owners reportedly have opposed Gaylord's bid 
because they do not want another team owned by a broadcasting company. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been informed by the major league baseball ownership committee this 
afternoon that they have reached a recommendation that the transaction between 
myself and Mr. Gaylord not be approved in accordance with the guidelines for 
the transfer of controlling interest that were adopted by baseball in 1988," 
Texas owner Eddie Chiles said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Gaylord was out of town today and unavailable for comment, his office said. 
Jerry Reinsdorf, chairman of baseball's joint ownership committee, today 
confirmed the rejection. 
</P>
<P>
A number of other investors, including former Rangers executive Larry 
Schmittou, have expressed interest in buying the franchise. A son of President 
Bush also has expressed interest. 
</P>
<P>
The change in ownership needed 11 votes in the American League and seven votes 
in the National League. 
</P>
<P>
Gaylord is president of Oklahoma Publishing Co., the parent company for Gaylord 
Broadcasting Co., and some owners have been concerned about Gaylord's 
broadcasting interests, which includes Ft. Worth's KTVT-TV, the station that 
televises Rangers games.

Cincinnati Bengals nose tackle Tim Krumrie, who shattered his leg before a 
national television audience during the Super Bowl, may be back with the team 
when it begins practice in July, his surgeons said. 
</P>
<P>
Krumrie, who underwent surgery Tuesday to pin the bones back together, broke 
his left leg in three places in Sunday's game with the San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors inserted a rod into his tibia to stabilize it while it healed, said 
hospital spokeswoman Gail Myers. The rod runs the length of the bone and is 
being held in place with screws. 
</P>
<P>
Krumrie will not need a cast, and team doctor Robert Heidt Jr. said he expects 
to let him move his knee and ankle within a few days. 
</P>
<P>
Krumrie broke his tibia in two places, and the smaller fibula, which runs down 
the outside of the lower leg, in one. 
</P>
<P>
Krumrie broke his leg while tackling 49ers running back Roger Craig. Krumrie 
planted his left foot, and when Craig twisted around, Krumrie's body went with 
him. His foot stayed planted, however, snapping both bones in his lower leg.
