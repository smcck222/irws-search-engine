<P>
Allen Collins, who lost fellow members of the rock group Lynyrd Skynyrd in a 
1977 plane crash and was paralyzed four years ago in a drunk driving accident, 
has died of pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
The guitarist was 37 and died Tuesday at Memorial Medical Center here where he 
had been hospitalized since September. 
</P>
<P>
Collins began his rise to success as the lightning-fingered guitarist for the 
Jacksonville band formed in 1966 by a group of high school students. The band 
enjoyed national fame in the 1970s with such hits as "Free Bird," "Gimme Three 
Steps," "Saturday Night Special" and Ronnie Van Zant's feisty "Sweet Home 
Alabama." 
</P>
<P>
In 1977, lead singer Van Zant, guitarist Stevie Gaines and Gaines' sister, 
Cassie Gaines, were killed in a plane crash. Collins and other members of the 
"blues and booze" image band were severely injured. 
</P>
<P>
Two years later, Collins, Gary Rossington, Bill Powell and Leon Wilkeson, all 
founding members of Lynyrd Skynyrd, joined with Barry Harwood and Dale Krantz 
to form the Rossington-Collins band. The group split in 1982, and Collins 
formed the Allen Collins band. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Collins' car ran off a road and crashed into a culvert, paralyzing him 
from the waist down and killing his girlfriend, Debra Jean Watts.

<TEXT>
<P>
"Briton Hopes U.S. Stops Opposing Forced Return of Boat People" (Part A, Jan. 
17) possibly didn't disturb many of your readers, but I for one am very 
disturbed at the prospects of our government condoning forced repatriation. 
</P>
<P>
Forced repatriation should be opposed on humanitarian and moral grounds as 
neither the welfare nor safety of asylum seekers who return to Vietnam can be 
guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
Legally, forced repatriation should be opposed as it relies on a screening 
policy which fails to adequately determine who is or is not a political 
refugee. (The Hong Kong government made it very clear that at least 90% of the 
Vietnamese who arrived after the cutoff date were not political refugees). 
</P>
<P>
As a former refugee worker and the wife of a Vietnamese man, I beg the 
government here to look closely at the present refugee situation in Southeast 
Asia. We must oppose any mean, futile gestures which result in the suffering of 
people. The Bush Administration should make moves to improve relations with 
Vietnam which will relieve the situation that forces people to flee.

Pity the person who is a victim of high grocery prices, an emergency trauma

We can only hope for a miracle. Maybe the impoverished will become informed,

CIVIL RIGHTS DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the apparent increased racial divisiveness triggered by the establishment 
of the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, perhaps we should substitute a 
celebration of an underlying integrating concept, instead of resorting to the 
traditional practice of exalting personalities over ideas. 
</P>
<P>
My nomination is to re-designate the King holiday as Civil Rights Day, a 
concept deserving of universal support. In this way an opportunity would be 
provided to honor all those who contributed to the advancement of civil rights, 
including Dr. King.

"The Old Gringo," Carlos Fuentes' book about the terminal period in the life of 
Ambrose Bierce, a journalist for William Randolph Hearst some 80 years ago, 
contains a passage which is shocking in the similarity to President Bush's 
statement on the rationale for Operation Just Cause in Panama: 
</P>
<P>
"I did it to save lives." Bierce is reflecting on Mexico: "This land . . . He 
(Bierce) had never seen it before; he had attacked it by orders of his boss 
Hearst, who had enormous investments in ranches and other property and feared 
the Revolution; but he couldn't say, Go protect my property, he had to say, Go 
protect our lives, there are North American citizens in danger, intervene!"

GEORGE, PLEASE LISTEN TO BARBARA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During a recent celebration marking the 25th anniversary of Head Start, the 
exemplary federally funded preschool program for poor children, First Lady 
Barbara Bush lavished praise, and made a heartening promise: "George Bush knows 
our children need more," she said. "He has pledged that every eligible 
4-year-old should have a head start in life." 
</P>
<P>
At present, Head Start serves 37% of the eligible 4-year-olds and 18% of all 
eligible children between 3 and 5. More than 488,500 youngsters benefit at a 
cost of $1.4 billion. It would cost $5 billion to fully fund the comprehensive 
program, according to the Committee on Education Funding. 
</P>
<P>
It's unrealistic to expect President Bush to triple the funding when he 
proposes his budget next week, given the deficits and competing national 
priorities. But he should significantly expand Head Start. It works. 
</P>
<P>
Head Start children learn to think, develop language skills and gain 
confidence. They are far less likely to be held back a grade, according to a 
congressional study, or be assigned to special education classes. Poor children 
who attend high- quality preschool programs are more likely to graduate from 
high school and attend college or obtain job training, according to a 
definitive study by the High/Scope Educational Research Foundation in 
Ypsilanti, Mich., and less likely to get pregnant, go on welfare or get 
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
The program is expensive. It costs to provide education, meals, medical 
attention and dental care. But the investment pays off. According to the 
High/Scope study, every dollar invested saves $6 in future social costs. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven million children have benefited since President Johnson launched Head 
Start in 1965. Today's children need more. Barbara Bush is right.

THE MORE TALKING THE BETTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are conflicting accounts of how a routine traffic stop south of Los 
Angeles erupted into a shootout between sheriff's deputies and members of the 
Nation of Islam that left one Muslim dead and another wounded. But one fact is 
indisputable: In the past, violent incidents like this have been the precursors 
of more serious confrontations. That must not be allowed to happen this time. 
</P>
<P>
What's especially troubling about Tuesday's incident is the fact that it 
followed by only two weeks a remarkably similar, but non-lethal, confrontation 
between Black Muslims and officers of the Los Angeles Police Department. The 
LAPD's handling of that confrontation's aftermath served as a model for what 
the Sheriff's Department did on Wednesday. Like the LAPD, the Sheriff's 
Department arranged meetings with leaders of the Nation of Islam and leaders of 
the black community to defuse tensions. Ironically, the apparently productive 
LAPD meeting with the Muslims took place the day before Tuesday's incident with 
the sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
Enlightened law-enforcement authorities un- derstand that many black Americans 
are inspired by the powerful message of self-respect and self-sufficiency that 
the Nation of Islam offers. But it's also true that the Nation of Islam is a 
controversial organization, to say the least. Its best-known leader, Louis 
Farrakhan, has given some virulently anti-Semitic speeches. And rank-and-file 
Black Muslims tend to have a direct and assertive style some authorities find 
threatening. 
</P>
<P>
Such an attitude may have contributed to the recent incidents involving the 
police. Cops are also trained to be assertive, taught to stand their ground in 
order to maintain command of the often dangerous situations in which they find 
themselves. That's why communication -- the simple act of talking with and 
trying to understand each other -- is necessary. For both the Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Department and the Nation of Islam, the time for that process 
is now. Both sides must start understanding each other better before the 
problem gets even more out of hand.

BAKE A BIGGER PIE, NOT SMALLER PIECES; 
</P>
<P>
FOREIGN AID: THE DOLE PROPOSAL IS APPEALING IN IT SIMPLICITY. BUT IT IGNORES 
THE REALITY OF A LONG DECLINE IN AMERICA'S INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD L. BERMAN, Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) serves on the House 
Foreign Affairs and Budget committees. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sen. Bob Dole's proposal to reduce U.S. foreign aid to Israel, Egypt, Pakistan, 
the Philippines and Turkey in order to meet the needs of the world's "new 
democracies" has appealing simplicity. 
</P>
<P>
Yet in its focus and in its magnitude, the Dole proposal misses the point. 
True, there is an insufficient amount of funds to serve a wide range of avowed 
U.S. foreign-policy interests. But reallocation of existing foreign aid will in 
no way alter this fact. Advancing this chimera will only lull us into a 
complacency that promises to divert us from the task of raising the funds 
necessary to serve our interests abroad. 
</P>
<P>
In the last decade, some members of Congress, Dole included, contended that the 
essential task of funding the national defense should not be compromised by the 
budget deficit. Yet if containing Soviet expansionism was the priority of the 
1980s, the successor in the '90s is the fostering of nascent democracy. Funding 
changes must reflect the shift in our mission. 
</P>
<P>
I have no quarrel with Dole's assessment of the paramount importance of 
assisting the democratic revolutions taking place in Eastern Europe. But these 
are not the only important events transpiring around the world. Other areas 
also deserve our resources. 
</P>
<P>
The fundamental problem with the Dole proposal is that it ignores the reality 
of what has happened to America's international-affairs assistance in recent 
years. Our spending in this critical category has dropped by nearly $7 billion, 
or 25% (not counting inflation), since 1985. Within these dwindling dollar 
amounts, spending on foreign aid (as distinguished from maintenance of 
embassies and so forth) has absorbed the brunt of all cuts, falling from more 
than $19 billion to the current level of less than $15 billion. When inflation 
is taken into account, the reductions are far more severe. 
</P>
<P>
The effects of these reductions have been devastating. Whole regions of the 
world have been wiped off the U.S. foreign-assistance map since 1985. In these 
few short years, Africa has seen its share of economic-support funding fall by 
more than 75%, from more than $400 million to $90 million. Non-military 
assistance to the Caribbean and to the Andes region, crucial to our 
anti-narcotics efforts, is imperiled. Reducing assistance to any "top five" 
countries would not relieve these shortfalls, nor come close to assisting 
Eastern Europe and Panama. 
</P>
<P>
Let's remember, too, how the top recipients of foreign assistance came to be 
such. It was neither arbitrary nor capricious. In each case, funding decisions 
were based on an assessment of the country's contribution to U.S. 
foreign-policy interests. Aid to Israel and Egypt, two critical allies in an 
unstable region, has been unchanged since 1985. This means a 13% reduction when 
inflation is taken into account; Dole's proposed 5% cut plus 4% inflation would 
take another 9%. And certainly the Philippines and Pakistan qualify as 
important developing democracies that deserve our help in their efforts to 
survive their own rocky transitions. The senator's arbitrary application of 
percentage reductions in aid to certain countries ignores the different reasons 
why a country came to receive aid. His is a simplistic approach that lacks 
substantive foundation. 
</P>
<P>
The imperative to increase spending on foreign affairs is obvious and 
incontrovertible. "Reallocation" is an evasion. Once a world leader in 
economic-aid spending, America has embarrassingly fallen behind other developed 
countries in this domain. 
</P>
<P>
None of this is to say that we can't re-examine our allocations of foreign aid. 
Let's cut military assistance to unthreatened countries whose citizens go 
unfed. Let's increase economic and development aid. Perhaps Sen. Dole will join 
us in re-examining whether 10 years of military aid to El Salvador has served 
U.S. interests and the interests of the Salvadoran people. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. foreign-affairs expenditures amount to a minuscule 2% or less of total 
federal spending, yet are absolutely vital to the alleviation of the social, 
economic and political dysfunctions that historically have driven so many 
international conflicts. Even the most drastic foreign-affairs cuts will have a 
negligible effect on the overall federal budget deficit. Still, such cuts would 
seriously endanger U.S. foreign-policy interests and global stability. 
</P>
<P>
It is worth addressing the issue honestly -- in terms of finding resources for 
vital interests -- rather than waiting for the consequences of our neglect to 
require the spending of far greater resources in the future.

MUST IGNORANCE BE A VIRTUE IN OUR SEARCH FOR JUSTICE?; 
</P>
<P>
JURORS: AMERICANS ARE ENTITLED TO A TRIAL BY AN IMPARTIAL PANEL. THAT DOESN'T 
MEAN THOSE SELECTED MUST BE UNINFORMED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NEWTON MINOW and FRED H. CATE, Newton H. Minow is a lawyer in Chicago and 
director of Northwestern University's Annenberg Washington Program in 
communications policy studies. Fred H. Cate is a fellow at the Annenberg 
program.

<TEXT>
<P>
Defense lawyers for Gen. Manuel Noriega are already claiming that it will be 
impossible to find a jury of 12 people who have not been influenced by the 
publicity surrounding his indictment and arrest. "We're going to have a look on 
the dark side of the moon for people who haven't heard bad things about the 
general," said Noriega defense counsel Frank Rubino. 
</P>
<P>
The claim is not original. On the day that almost any newsworthy criminal trial 
begins, if not the day of the indictment or arrest, the defense argues: "My 
client can't get a fair trial because the prospective jurors have been 
prejudiced by press reports about the case." 
</P>
<P>
Noriega's lawyers point to not only news stories saturating the media; they 
contend that the President, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and other high U.S. 
government officials have repeatedly, on national television and on the front 
pages of every major U.S. newspaper, called Noriega a drug dealer and gangster. 
The argument is understandable. 
</P>
<P>
But the justice system's frequent response to the problem of pretrial publicity 
-- banning informed citizens from a jury -- is obsolete in our news-saturated 
society. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Sixth Amendment, every person accused of a crime has the right 
to a trial "by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime 
shall have been committed." The standard for selecting jurors is impartiality, 
not ignorance. As described in the common law that underlies our legal system, 
it must be a jury of "peers." In fact, in 12th-Century England, the earliest 
juries were chosen for their knowledge of the case, not their lack of it. In 
this country, the criterion has long since been reversed. 
</P>
<P>
If a court excludes potential jurors who follow the news, it excludes a vast 
segment of the population -- ironically leaving those who are presumably less 
interested in the civic principles that a jury is expected to uphold. This 
exclusion, intended to prevent prejudice, substitutes a different kind of 
prejudice that undercuts the basic reason we entrust them with crucial 
decisions of freedom, imprisonment, life and death. 
</P>
<P>
For decades, black Americans were often excluded from juries until the U.S. 
Supreme Court recognized that a jury of only one race is not representative of 
the community. A jury from which citizens who seek to be well-informed have 
been systematically excluded is equally unrepresentative. 
</P>
<P>
Such a jury cannot serve the interest of justice. The jurors should represent 
the full community, not only the segment uninterested in what the media report 
in newspapers, magazines, radio and television. A jury representing only that 
segment, a jury ignorant of a story as important and well-publicized as the 
U.S. invasion of Panama, is not a jury of "peers." 
</P>
<P>
Rather than dismiss informed citizens from jury service, thoughtful judges 
today question them closely about their ability to be impartial. To protect the 
innocent from being punished, judges already instruct jurors to consider only 
what they have heard in the courtroom and what the judge has accepted into the 
record. In almost every case, this means jurors are told to disregard something 
they have seen or heard in the courtroom. And we trust them to do so. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the skills of discernment that most citizens exercise and refine daily 
in evaluating the barrage of news, advertising and rhetoric presented by the 
media may help jurors to be both impartial and capable. The jury that excludes 
the informed majority of citizens can be neither. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Manuel Noriega, as with other criminal defendants, if the court 
insists on uninformed jurors, it faces an impossible dilemma: It must either 
set Noriega free, if an adequately uninformed jury cannot be impaneled, or try 
him before a jury that is not representative of the community. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Twain's warning in 1871, describing a jury trial in Virginia City, Nev., 
is even more applicable today: 
</P>
<P>
"A minister, intelligent, esteemed and greatly respected; a merchant of high 
character and known probity; a mining superintendent of intelligence and 
unblemished reputation . . . were all questioned in the same way and all set 
aside. Each said the public talk and the newspaper reports had not biased his 
mind. . . . But of course such men could not be trusted with the case. 
Ignoramuses alone could mete out unsullied justice."

FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: UNEXPLAINED HEADACHE COULD BE TRIGGERED BY MANY 
NUTRITIONAL FACTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JEAN MAYER and JEANNE GOLDBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It might be a dull, diffuse sensation or a brain-splitting migraine, but nearly 
all of us suffer from the occasional headache. 
</P>
<P>
Chronic or severe pain could signal a serious problem and requires medical 
evaluation. Fortunately, most minor headaches disappear spontaneously or 
respond to non-prescription pain relievers. Sometimes, though, neither scenario 
applies: No medical cause can be found, yet the ache recurs. 
</P>
<P>
If you're plagued by unexplained headaches, one place to look for clues is your 
diet. At first glance, the list of possible food factors appears long. In fact, 
however, food holds the answer in very few cases. 
</P>
<P>
That said, it's true that nutritional factors can precipitate either type of 
headache, more commonly the dull, diffuse kind. When such pain occurs regularly 
in late morning or late afternoon, the most likely cause is simple hunger. Some 
people, particularly children and pregnant women, are more sensitive than 
others to the minor drop in blood sugar that is normal between meals. Skipping 
meals can make the headaches worse. 
</P>
<P>
The solution? Eat regularly, and keep meals and snacks balanced. Too many 
refined starches and sugars to the exclusion of lean-protein sources leads to 
rapid release of the hormone insulin. Insulin normally works to move nutrients 
from the blood into the cells. But when it's released too quickly, the brain 
may not receive enough nutrients, and a headache can result. Low-fat cottage 
cheese and fresh fruit or part-skim mozzarella on whole-grain crackers are 
excellent snack choices for people susceptible to this sort of pain. 
</P>
<P>
Another source of headaches is iron-deficiency anemia. Women and children are 
the likeliest victims, since their iron requirements are higher and deficiency 
is more common. In anemia, oxygen-transport by the blood is impaired, and 
insufficient oxygen to the brain translates into headache. If anemia is 
suspected, a blood test can verify the diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
Remember, though, that iron supplements can be dangerous and should not be 
taken without medical supervision. In most cases, anemia can be avoided by 
eating foods naturally rich in iron, such as lean red meats, chicken and dried 
beans. Consuming foods rich in Vitamin C (oranges, peppers or broccoli, for 
example) along with a meat-containing meal improves absorption. 
</P>
<P>
You might have noticed that many over-the-counter pain relievers contain 
caffeine. Migraine headaches are often caused by dilation, or relaxation, of 
blood vessels to the brain. Caffeine causes these vessels to constrict, thus 
relieving many headaches, particularly migraines. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the body can become dependent on caffeine. Any change in 
coffee-drinking habits -- either more or less than usual -- can trigger a 
headache. If you suspect caffeine is the culprit, try weaning yourself away 
from coffee, tea and colas. Decaffeinated teas and coffee provide an 
alternative and are probably safe in reasonable quantities. 
</P>
<P>
For a few people, reactions to certain foods and food additives can start that 
horrible hammer tap-tapping in the skull. Preservations such as sodium nitrite 
and nitrate, commonly used in packaged meats, may affect sensitive individuals. 
Others may react to a food dye called tartrazine, or yellow No. 5, found in 
many yellow and green foods, among them cake mixes, gelatins and candies. Also, 
the flavor-enhancer monosodium glutamate (MSG), best known for use in Chinese 
foods, can produce symptoms nicknamed "Chinese restaurant syndrome," which 
include a dizzy, throbbing headache. 
</P>
<P>
If you consistently notice a headache after eating foods with these additives, 
you can easily avoid them. According to Food and Drug Administration 
regulations, all three must be listed by name on food labels. 
</P>
<P>
Besides food additives, certain foods contain naturally occurring compounds to 
which some people are sensitive. Foods aged or "ripened" through bacterial 
action may contain tyramine, a substance related to the building blocks of 
proteins, which the body converts to a potent blood-vessel constrictor. Like 
caffeine, vasoconstrictors sometimes relieve headaches but can also cause them. 
People taking certain drugs to treat depression are especially vulnerable to 
the effects of tyramine, but it may trigger headache in others who aren't on 
medication. 
</P>
<P>
Foods high in tyramine include aged cheeses such as Cheddar and Brie, wine and 
beer, yeast extracts, breads high in yeast, figs and eggplant. Another 
compound, phenylethylamine, found in chocolate, cheese and alcoholic beverages 
produces vasoconstriction that can lead to headache. 
</P>
<P>
Keeping a record of food intake and headaches can help you and your physician 
determine whether diet plays a role. Bear in mind that dietary factors are not 
a major cause of headaches: Unless you can find a clear link, don't burden 
yourself with needless diet modifications. 
</P>
<P>
All that will do is create more stress -- probably the last thing you need.

Duck Registers With More Calories Because of Saturated Fat Content 
</P>
<P>
Question: Over the holidays I prepared duck for the first time, and everyone 
welcomed the change. But now that the applause has died down, I'm wondering how 
duck compares to chicken in terms of saturated fat. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Duck has more. For example, 3 1/2 ounces of dark-meat chicken without 
the skin contains between 9 and 10 grams of fat, depending on whether it's a 
boiler or a fryer. Of that, about 2 1/2 grams is saturated fat. The same 
portion of duck, by contrast, contains about 11 grams of fat, of which over 
four grams is saturated. In other words, the two types of birds provide roughly 
comparable amounts of fat, but the amount that is saturated is quite different. 
</P>
<P>
Here's another way of looking at it. In the chicken, 43% of the calories come 
from fat, compared to 50% in the duck. And of the total calories, 12% of those 
in the chicken but more than 18% of those in the duck are from saturated fat. 
</P>
<P>
Goose is even fattier than duck, but contains about the same proportion of 
saturated fat. Three-and-a-half ounces have over 12 1/2 grams of fat, of which 
4 1/2 grams -- accounting for 17% of the calories -- are saturated. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Will eating a high-fiber diet prevent diabetes? 
</P>
<P>
A: Scientists are trying to find out, but so far the evidence is unclear. 
Several studies of the relationship between fiber intake and prevalence of 
diabetes have found the disease less frequent in groups on high-fiber diets 
than among those who have consumed little. Examining changes in dietary 
patterns revealed that as fiber intake declined, diabetes became more common. 
However, other studies have found no such effect. 
</P>
<P>
Why the inconsistent results? Perhaps the answer lies in differences -- 
dietary, environmental, genetic and socioeconomic -- among the various groups 
that have been studied. 
</P>
<P>
Some studies have looked at the effects of fiber supplements on those who 
already have diabetes. It is clear that some water-soluble fibers can help 
control blood-sugar levels in diabetics. But how these observations relate to 
preventing the disease in the first place is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
Results of most, but not all, studies in which high-fiber foods rather than 
supplements have been used have demonstrated benefit too. But because these 
diets differed in other aspects, it is difficult to separate the exclusive 
effect of fiber. And once again, it's impossible to determine how the observed 
effect ties in with prevention. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, studies of animals who are genetically susceptible to 
diabetes show that fiber helps delay onset of the disease, giving support to 
several links between diabetes and fiber intake in humans. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line is that even without more proof of the fiber-diabetes 
connection, there are plenty of good reasons to consume whole grains of various 
types, and generous amounts of raw and lightly cooked fruits and vegetables, 
and dried beans. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Recently I entered the hospital for some minor surgery. As I lay in bed 
recuperating, I found myself watching the intravenous fluid drip and wondering 
how the procedure originated. Can you tell me? 
</P>
<P>
A: Intravenous therapy was first used in Great Britain during the cholera 
epidemic of the early 1830s. Physicians of that era generally did not 
understand fluid balance. They treated their already dehydrated patients with 
blood-letting and other methods that only aggravated the problem and hastened 
their demise. 
</P>
<P>
The man thought to be the first to suggest that adding fluids would be a more 
rational treatment was William Brooke O'Shaugnessy. Dr. O'Shaugnessy was a 
native of Limerick and a graduate of the University of Edinburgh. He originally 
reported his ideas on the restoration of fluids to the Westminster Medical 
Society in December, 1831. 
</P>
<P>
A year-and-a-half later, the earliest report of the use of injections of water 
with added salts appeared. Of the 25 cases recorded around that time, eight 
recovered. Today we might not call this a medical breakthrough, but at the time 
it was remarkable, especially since it was used only in patients who were 
dangerously ill. 
</P>
<P>
Yet it took decades before the treatment came into widespread use. One 
stumbling block was that unsterile and chemically impure water caused serious 
problems. In a recent article in Lancet, Dr. J.E. Cosnett observed that while 
intravenous therapy was a rational idea, it appeared before our understanding 
both of the body's chemistry and of microbiology were sufficiently advanced to 
use it well. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, neither the names of Dr. O'Shaugnessy nor of Dr. Thomas Latta and 
Robert Lewins of Leith, who were the first to try the treatment, are found in 
any major work on the general history of medicine.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chinese New Year festivities, which take place this Saturday, are an excellent 
opportunity for people worldwide to experience the flavor of Chinese cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
Triple Mushroom Soup, adapted from a recipe in Martin Yan's popular "A Wok for 
All Seasons" (Doubleday: 1988), blends the rich flavor of chicken broth with 
button, oyster and dried black mushrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Garnish with cilantro leaves and additional mushrooms for eye appeal. 
</P>
<P>
TRIPLE MUSHROOM SOUP

CATERING TO CUSTOMERS' WHIMS CAN LEAVE A SOUR TASTE IN CHEF'S MOUTH; 
</P>
<P>
CAREERS: CAPTURING ESCAPED SNAILS, UNCLOGGING SINKS AND TRYING TO MAKE 
APPETIZING LUNCH SPECIALS OUT OF LEFTOVERS ARE JUST PART OF A PROFESSIONAL 
CHEF'S LIFE. 
</P>

By ILANA SHARLIN, Sharlin is a Los Angeles chef.

<TEXT>
<P>
You finally get that date with the guy of your dreams. You've waited weeks for 
him to call, and now he's finally asked you to join him for a romantic 
candlelight dinner. He stares deeply into your eyes and tells you how beautiful 
they are. Then, he reaches for your hand and raises it to his lips. The 
expression on his face begins to sour. He loosens his grip and your hand 
clumsily drops onto his salad plate, splattering vinaigrette onto the 
tablecloth. Total panic sets in as you realize that not even five rigorous 
scrubbings have removed the permeating smell of grease, fish and garlic from 
your hands. Such is the glamorous, sometimes lonely life of a chef. 
</P>
<P>
Just like our friends in other industries, we chefs have our many perks. We 
have the facility to conveniently indulge every bizarre food craving that 
strikes us on the job. Caesar salad, onion rings and ice cream -- the makings 
of a fine food fest are always on hand. Because Los Angeles chefs cook dinner 
for many Hollywood celebrities, we are privy to the stars' most intimate 
habits: such as the one who takes salad dressing on the side, who is allergic 
to jalapeno peppers, who is on Pritikin and who doesn't eat at all. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike our white collar friends, we never have the morning dilemma of which tie 
to wear with which suit or which blouse with which skirt. Every day I open my 
closet and ask myself, "Shall I wear the white jacket today, or the white 
jacket? Well, the weatherman says it's supposed to be cooler today, so maybe I 
should wear the white jacket. Oh, I think I'll just wear the white jacket." 
This is the closest I get to white collar. The black and white checked pants 
nicely offset the aforementioned white jacket and the black, food-spattered, 
steel-toed workman's shoes really make the outfit (and are also useful for 
negotiating rightful ownership of disputed parking spaces). When I'm feeling 
that mad urge to accessorize, I throw on an apron. And let me tell you, the 
chef's uniform, with its artful draping of the human form, is feminine mystique 
at its purest. It invites others to imagine what's underneath: 115 pounds of 
voluptuous curves or 180 pounds of lard. 
</P>
<P>
My typical day starts long before most of my friends with MBAs have donned 
their Cross Trainers in preparation for the morning workout. By 7:30 a.m., I 
have greeted the dawn, along with a handful of delivery people who look more 
like parolees than anything else. There's nothing like a whiff of fresh 
sardines from the first morning delivery to send you staggering in the 
direction of the espresso machine. 
</P>
<P>
I open the door of the walk-in refrigerator to make my preliminary inspection 
and witness a sight straight out of an Indiana Jones movie. The walk-in is 
crawling with slithering snails, escargot escapees from a crate that arrived 
the day before from France. It seems that one of our rocket scientists had 
forgotten to replace the lid. All hands on deck as the entire morning crew 
recaptures tonight's appetizer special. With that situation under control, I 
make my preliminary inspection of the walk-in, and try to come up with an 
appetizing lunch special that somehow utilizes salmon scraps, hard-cooked eggs 
and Swiss chard. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of my morning is filled with thrilling management challenges, like 
unclogging the pot sink and rescuing a terrified employee from the clutches of 
the Immigration and Naturalization Service. I attempt to back up Juan's claim 
that the green card demanded by the INS agent has been eaten by his dog, but 
the agent looks doubtful. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most satisfying aspects of my profession is the opportunity it 
provides to play a part in improving international relations. I converse with 
Mexican employees in their mother tongue about the important issues of the day. 
For example, I often ask them such deep, probing questions as: "Where are the 
oval plates?" and "Could you please bring me more saute pans?" They respond 
with a well thought-out "Si," in true ambassadorial spirit. 
</P>
<P>
Lunch is a flurry of salads and sandwiches that comes and goes as quickly as it 
takes two producers to say "Let's do lunch." 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, the afternoon is upon us, and we work like busy bees to prepare for 
the evening rush. One of the prep cooks demonstrates his serious commitment to 
the animal rights movement by wresting a Sumo-sized Maine lobster into a pot of 
boiling water. Arms and claws fly in every direction as the lobster tries to 
escape his fate by clinging to any available appendage. 
</P>
<P>
Another prep cook cons a rookie salad person just mastering the technique of 
oyster shucking into believing that a buckshot pellet is actually a black 
pearl. In a fit of excitement, the novice drops the pellet and it explodes -- 
her hopes of making an overnight fortune in the jewelry market go up in smoke. 
</P>
<P>
Just when I'm about to give up hope of ever working with serious, dedicated 
cooks, that bastion of professionalism and talent, the night crew, begins to 
drift in, bleary-eyed from a night of tequila, junk food and late night 
television. 
</P>
<P>
I get a frantic phone call from one of my cooks, who is catering a dinner party 
in a private home. It seems that she has accidentally switched on the oven's 
cleaning cycle, automatically locking the oven door until the one and a half 
hour cycle has been completed. Eighteen baby poussins have been annihilated in 
a domestic gas chamber, while hungry guests begin to clamor for food outside 
the kitchen door. I rush to cook more chickens for her, while fondly 
remembering my most recent catering crisis -- the time I managed to transform 
200 portions of delicately sliced and pounded tuna carpaccio into giant, pink 
snowflakes as a result of some overzealous chilling. 
</P>
<P>
It's 6 p.m. and the first orders begin to come in to the kitchen. It looks like 
it's going to be another Customer-Created Menu night. My waiters look at me 
with pleading eyes as the special orders roll in: 
</P>
<P>
"The woman on table 32 says she would like the beef carpaccio cooked medium 
well." 
</P>
<P>
"Can you grill the sauteed halibut, and serve it with the sauce from the 
chicken? On the side, please. Oh yeah, can you add sauteed mushrooms to that? 
Oh, and light oil please. And no salt. And, extra spicy." 
</P>
<P>
"Could you heat up this diet dinner for table 10?" 
</P>
<P>
"Could you heat up this jar of baby food for table 5?" 
</P>
<P>
"No garlic with that sauteed squid on table 39." 
</P>
<P>
"No squid with that sauteed squid on table 53." 
</P>
<P>
Who am I to create menus that I feel will appeal to customers? After all, I'm 
just the chef, with two years of culinary training in one of the nation's top 
schools and several years of experience in kitchens -- what do I know? I 
suppose it could be worse. I could be a waiter. 
</P>
<P>
It's 1 a.m., and the long day is finally over. Headed for home, I pick up a few 
items at the 24-hour supermarket for my own gourmet exploits: a loaf of bread, 
a quart of milk and a box of cereal. As I plod down the aisles with aching feet 
and stained uniform, I am greeted with looks of curiosity and disbelief. The 
youthful check-out clerk hands me my change, eyes me and says doubtfully: "Are 
you really a chef?" "No", I say sarcastically. "I just enjoy dressing this 
way." He says, "Wow, that's really cool." 
</P>
<P>
If only he knew what life is like on the line.

THE KITCHEN CABINET: CONVERTIBLE COOKTOP SAVES KITCHEN SPACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MINNIE BERNARDINO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No matter how large a kitchen is, there is always a need for more space. One 
big space occupier is the cooktop -- much as we all would like to have every 
cooktop function available, the desire for more counter space prohibits it. 
Answering this need is the convertible cooktop, which enables you to alternate 
various cooking modules with the regular burner, such as a barbecue grill, a 
pancake griddle, or a deep fryer. 
</P>
<P>
One of the latest innovations from Dacor is a Halogen cooktop EM-2 module in 
its line of electric convertible cooktops. Aglow with red neon when operating, 
Halogen allows the instant on and quick response of gas while providing the 
convenience of electric. And no, it doesn't require special cookware as in 
induction cooking. 
</P>
<P>
Fitted flush for a sleek look and for ease in cleaning, the EM-2 module has a 
frame-less top. It is set on a Ceran glass surface and consists of a 2,200 watt 
halogen and a 1200 Quick Star radiant burner consisting of porcelain modules 
with coils or solid elements. One or two halogen modules may be used in Dacor's 
36-inch convertible cooktop or as many as three in the 46-inch model. Available 
in a monochromatic look of white, almond or black, the modules are 
interchangeable with barbecue grill inserts, griddle and rotisserie 
accessories. For ventilation, there is a choice of either the downdraft or 
overhead ventilation system. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dacor Halogen cooktop is available at most independent appliance dealers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Just as there are good reasons for muffins, there are equally good reasons for 
the new insulated muffin pan from Rema Bakeware. Designed with a cushion of air 
insulation in between the top and bottom aluminum layers, the Cushionaire 
Muffin Pans ($15) prevent burned muffins. Aside from minimizing unwanted 
peaking in the center of the muffins, the pans promote even baking for more 
uniform and higher muffins. However, since the pans are thicker than normal, 
for best results increase the baking period slightly following the higher range 
of recommended cooking time. 
</P>
<P>
Made of heavy- gauge nonrusting aluminum, the six-cup (three-inch) regular 
muffin pans are dishwasher safe. (Rema has updated all their insulated bakeware 
assortment such as cookie sheets and cake pans by making them all dishwasher 
safe.) 
</P>
<P>
 Rema Cushionaire Muffin Pans are available at the Broadway, Bullock's, Fedco 
and May Company. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many people find that they are using the mini food choppers for daily kitchen 
tasks more than their larger food processors. If you're one of those who 
haven't yet discovered the convenience of these smaller versions, try checking 
into the latest entry from Black &amp; Decker. Its Super Mincer/Chopper (Model 
SC25: $37.98) has enough power and speed to process onions, garlic, nuts, 
chocolate and herbs efficiently and uniformly. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the space-saver compact unit can "whip up" mayonnaise, salad 
dressings, sauces, whipping cream and eggs. It is wonderful for small amounts 
of egg whites for omelets or soups, but forget it for angel food cakes. What 
makes whipping possible is the small stainless coil attachment that can be 
inserted over the stainless steel blade. 
</P>
<P>
Designed with a white base and see-through work bowl, the machine features a 
special opening in the lid for pouring in extra liquid ingredients. The unit 
also includes a continuous on and pulse switch to prevent overprocessing of 
ingredients and for better power control. 
</P>
<P>
 The Black &amp; Decker Super Mincer/Chopper is available at Fedco, Service 
Merchandise, Virgil's Hardware (Glendale) and Adray's.

NUTRITIONALLY SPEAKING: RETHINKING PERCEPTIONS OF PORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONI TIPTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The nutrient-dense quality of pork is frequently overshadowed by the 
misconception that it, like many other red meats, is fatty. In response to such 
perceptions, the pork industry has reduced the fat content of its pork cuts in 
the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
Today's pork is about 50% leaner than the pork brought to market 20 years ago, 
according to industry experts. Its high nutritive value is an added plus. At 
about 200 calories per three-ounce serving, pork is an excellent source of 
protein -- a three-ounce serving provides about 24 grams, nearly half the 
Recommended Dietary Allowance. 
</P>
<P>
Pork also is a good source of iron, offering between 5% and 10% of the RDA for 
adult women in each three-ounce serving. It also contains zinc and some B 
vitamins. (The recommended amount for both of these minerals was reduced when 
the 10th edition of RDA was released late last year. The RDA for iron for women 
is 15 milligrams, for zinc 12 milligrams. The suggested intake for men is 10 
milligrams of iron, 15 milligrams zinc.) 
</P>
<P>
There's something else that's new about pork in today's marketplace. After 
evaluation of previous handling and preparation techniques, the industry has 
revised the minimum safe cooking temperature for pork cuts from 170 degrees to 
160 degrees. It was previously thought that the higher temperature was 
necessary to prevent trichinosis, an infection caused by a parasite, trichinae. 
But, according to the industry, trichinae infection is rarely seen today 
because of improved feeding practices. Trichinae is killed at 137 degrees, 
which falls well below either of the recommended temperatures, according to the 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
A boneless pork loin roast may now be served at either 160 degrees or 170 
degrees, although cooked to the lower temperature, the meat will be slightly 
pink in color and more juicy. At 170 degrees, the pork has a more developed 
flavor. 
</P>
<P>
A pork cut with the bone may also be cooked to an internal temperature of 160 
degrees, but there will be an intensely pink color near the bone. For a serving 
that is no longer pink, cook to 170 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Because of its muscle content, the recommended cooking time for pork shoulder 
remains 170 degrees. It requires the additional time for even cooking and full 
flavor development. 
</P>
<P>
When roasting large cuts, it is necessary to remove the cut while still 5 
degrees below the preferred end temperature and allow 15 to 20 minutes standing 
time. If, for example, the desired serving temperature is 160 degrees, the 
roast should be removed from the oven at 155 degrees, tented with foil and 
allowed to stand. The roast will continue to cook and the temperature will rise 
about 5 degrees during the rest period. 
</P>
<P>
By following these new cooking times and by trimming cuts of any excess fat, 
health experts agree it is possible for lean pork to fit into sensible eating 
plans where balance and variety are compatible goals. 
</P>
<P>
PORK MEDALLIONS WITH DIJON-DILL SAUCE 
</P>
<P>
1/2 pound pork tenderloin 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon garlic salt 
</P>
<P>
1/8 teaspoon black pepper 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup plain low-fat yogurt 
</P>
<P>
2 teaspoons Dijon mustard 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon dill weed 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon sugar 
</P>
<P>
Cut pork crosswise into 4 pieces. To make medallions, place each piece, cut 
side down, on flat surface. Cover with wax paper and flatten gently with heel 
of hand to 1/4-inch thick. 
</P>
<P>
Pan broil pork in nonstick skillet over medium heat 3 to 4 minutes, per side. 
Remove medallions to warm platter. Season both sides with garlic salt and 
pepper. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, combine yogurt, mustard, dill and sugar. Place in heat-proof measure 
over hot, not boiling, water and heat 2 to 3 minutes. Do not cook or mixture 
will curdle. Serve with medallions. Makes 2 servings.

ABOUT WINE: CAN POUR SERVICE GET WORSE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Around the country, restaurants offering wine with their food seem to have a 
death wish. Most of them evidently think wine service is meaningless and they 
thus don't train their personnel in how to serve wine. 
</P>
<P>
And when you're paying two to three times the retail price for a bottle of 
wine, good service should be part of the price. 
</P>
<P>
Yet from the service I have seen, I get the impression that few restaurant 
people care about service. They also don't seem to care that their poor service 
is likely to make wine lovers so disgusted that they won't ever try to order 
wine in a restaurant again. Or dine there again. 
</P>
<P>
I have more than a dozen stories of "bozo-ness" in wine service; a few will 
suffice. The following story is true, but only a fraction of the problems are 
listed here: 
</P>
<P>
I was dining (I use the term loosely) recently at an inn in New Jersey, not a 
decision I made voluntarily, I might add. I noted on the wine list that one red 
wine by the glass was 1986 J. Lohr Cabernet Sauvignon, a fine wine that sells 
for about $7 a bottle. Despite the fact that at $4.50 a glass it was 
overpriced, I ordered it. 
</P>
<P>
And what came to the table was clearly not Cabernet at all but a Beaujolais. I 
mentioned it to the waiter, who said, "You wanted the red wine, didn't you?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, but I wanted the Cabernet," I replied, "and this is not Cabernet." He 
took the glass away with a diffident shrug. 
</P>
<P>
He returned with another glass (and I won't tell you what the "glass" looked 
like). After taking a sniff and a sip, I determined that the wine inside was 
not J. Lohr Cabernet, but a much less expensive wine. I hailed the waiter and 
said, "This is not the wine on the wine list." 
</P>
<P>
He said, "It's what the bartender poured." 
</P>
<P>
I said, "But I wanted the J. Lohr Cabernet. Could I see the bottle this came 
from?" 
</P>
<P>
Back came the bottle. It was a Cabernet all right, but it was one that sells 
for about $3.50 a bottle and I have seen it for $2.79. I said, "Your list 
showed the '86 J. Lohr. This is not J. Lohr." 
</P>
<P>
He said, "The bartender tells me we're out of the J. Lohr, so he substituted 
this." 
</P>
<P>
"A wine that sells for less than half the price of the J. Lohr, huh? And I 
assume the price of this glass is not going to be $4.50 this evening?" 
</P>
<P>
He took the question to be rhetorical and left. There was no manager around 
that evening to whom I could squawk, so I paid the bill and went to my room, 
fuming. 
</P>
<P>
A similar problem happened to a colleague two years ago. Dining at a San 
Francisco-area restaurant (also in a hotel, coincidentally) he ordered a glass 
of Korbel Natural, a dry sparkling wine. When the wine came, it was sweet. 
</P>
<P>
"Could I see the bottle?" he asked of the waiter. 
</P>
<P>
"Is something the matter, sir?" said the waiter. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think this is Korbel Natural," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The waiter left, to be replaced by "a guy in a black suit," my friend said. 
</P>
<P>
"Is something the matter, sir?" the man in the black suit asked. (This must be 
a phrase they teach you in restaurant school.) 
</P>
<P>
My friend conveyed his concern; the manager said, "We are out of Korbel and we 
have substituted a very comparable wine." He mentioned the name. It sells for 
$22 a case, wholesale. 
</P>
<P>
A discussion ensued. My friend was a little upset (understatement) that a wine 
that could, and does, sell for $2.50 a bottle at retail would be substituted 
for a wine that sells for $12 a bottle with the patron not informed of this 
switch. Things got pretty nasty at that point. (My friend is known to be 
feisty, particularly when he's right about something.) 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the time a decade ago when we were sipping a bottle of Riesling. 
After the glasses at the table had been poured, four ounces remained in the 
bottle, which went back into the ice bucket. 
</P>
<P>
Later our waitress returned, hoisted the bottle, glanced at it and, not seeing 
the wine remaining, turned the bottle upside down in the ice bucket, thereby 
pouring out what wine remained. (And what is this obsession that waiter staffs 
have with turning bottles upside down?) 
</P>
<P>
Just a couple of weeks ago in a new downtown Los Angeles "chic-erie," our water 
poured five glasses and began walking away with what was left, about three 
ounces. Only after we shouted across the restaurant did he return with our last 
one-ninth of the bottle. 
</P>
<P>
And in a fashionable Beverly Hills boite, we ordered three bottles of wine, 
each of which was "out of stock," and we were then offered a bottle that the 
restaurant had -- but which was priced significantly higher than the ones I had 
been ordering. 
</P>
<P>
Outside of price gouging, wine service in restaurants is one of the worst 
things we have to deal with. Ill-informed (or uninformed) servers make dining 
with wine a frustrating experience. And if my Cabernet episode and my 
compatriot's Korbel incident are any indication, some of what's going on is 
downright illegal. 
</P>
<P>
Some time ago, I wrote a column about my pet peeves about wine. One comment 
about restaurant pricing generated loads of letters from people around the 
country who were irate (more than I, surprisingly) over what they considered 
sloppy, inconsiderate, uninformed service. 
</P>
<P>
Some spoke of the outrage of paying $30 for a wine that retails for $12, and 
all high wine pricing in general, but the things that came through most clearly 
were complaints about the lack of proper service and the general malaise in the 
restaurant industry over a product that should truly enhance a meal while 
making the owner of the restaurant a tidy sum. 
</P>
<P>
One letter was particularly vitriolic, evidence it was years in the making: 
</P>
<P>
"Ah, a chance to vent some unspoken anger about restaurants and wait staffs 
when it comes to wine service," she wrote. "Some 'fine' restaurants hire 
truck-stop quality people. They miss the whole idea of a 'dining experience.' 
Many a meal has been soured by poor wine service. 
</P>
<P>
"Please do not fill my glass to the rim. Please do not keep coming back and 
sloshing more wine in my glass to keep it to the rim. Please tell me of the 
wine specials as well as the food specials. I have found an overlooked 
chalkboard special of something I would have ordered and the wait staff never 
let on there was something special. I feel like going back and taking a divot 
out of the tip. 
</P>
<P>
"Consistently poor wait staff, poor wine lists, gouging wine prices, aargh. I 
keep a list of 'Do Not Visit Here Again' restaurants, which I share with 
friends generously." 
</P>
<P>
High restaurant pricing was the most-mentioned complaint of writers. One wrote, 
"These people have their nerve. They pay $8 for a wine that's supposed to sell 
for $12 on the retail shelf, and they expect me to pay $24 or $28 for this? 
Hey, I can get it for $9.50 at my local discount shop, why am I going to pay 
$24 in a restaurant? So it can be served poorly by some clod who can't even 
pronounce the wine?" 
</P>
<P>
Another wrote, "Wine is the only product they (restaurants) sell that they can 
actually sell for more money the longer they have it. It's not perishable like 
butter or cream. So why do they think we should pay a ridiculous sum for young 
wine that we can buy down at the local grocery store?" 
</P>
<P>
Another complaint by two persons: the list that offers no vintage dates. I too 
detest seeing lists that say, "Chateau Haut-Brion, V." The V is supposed to 
designate that they have the vintage-dated Haut-Brion. The fact that there is 
no such thing as a non-vintage Haut-Brion never crossed their mind. 
</P>
<P>
But what vintage is it? Some years ago in a San Diego restaurant I saw this 
very listing on a wine list. The price was $48. So I asked what the vintage 
was. 
</P>
<P>
The young man (a former surfer I'm certain) went away and returned to inform me 
he was sorry, they didn't have anything younger. It was a 1971. 
</P>
<P>
Needless to say, my friends and I dined at that place for months until the 
"old" wine was gone. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, the restaurant deserved what it got. Had the vintage been on the 
wine list, a wine as fine as the '71 Haut-Brion would never have sat there for 
a decade, unbought. And they could have gotten $100 or so for the bottle and 
still not overcharged. 
</P>
<P>
Corkage policies also anger me. Often, I have a rare old wine I'd like to bring 
into the restaurant. So I call and inquire what the corkage policy is. 
Sometimes I'm told, "We don't allow you to bring in your own wine." So I dine 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Or they say, "We'd be happy to let you bring your own wine in. The charge will 
be $12 per bottle." I dine elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
At the enlightened places, corkage is a modest fee (perhaps $4 to $5 a bottle), 
and it's frequently waived if you give the maitre d' a sip of a rare old wine. 
</P>
<P>
(One important point here, though: never bring into a restaurant a wine that's 
already on the wine list, and avoid if at all possible young wines unless they 
are rare and hard to find. Restaurants have to stay in business.) 
</P>
<P>
Wine of the Week: 1986 Graeser Winery Cabernet Sauvignon ($12) -- Not 
particularly deep or dark, but this wine will age nicely, and it has such 
lovely fruit right now that you want to drink it. Except for a fairly tart 
finish, this is a most appealing wine, with cherry/herb components, a 
toastiness from oak and a lower level of tannins than you usually find in 
Cabernet. If this wine is tasted in a sterile setting, it's hard to evaluate 
because of its tartness. But try it with food and watch it transform. Richard 
Graeser and wife, Celeste, run a poverty-stricken winery and young vineyard on 
the western slope of the mountains above Calistoga (not far from Diamond 
Creek). Graeser wines are not yet widely available but may be ordered by mail. 
Drop a note to Richard Graeser, 255 Petrified Forest Road, Calistoga, Calif.

MY BEST RECIPE: COFFEE CAKE FOR BREAKFAST OR TEATIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"My mother's ancestry was a combination of Scotch and German," Ann I. Davis 
writes, "but when it came to cooking, her German side prevailed. This recipe 
for Glazed Coffee Cake, Kaffeekuchen mit Zucker und Nuss, exemplifies her flair 
for a sugar-nut topped coffee cake that is perfect for breakfast, luncheon or 
tea." 
</P>
<P>
GLAZED COFFEE CAKE 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup butter or margarine 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups sugar 
</P>
<P>
1 egg, beaten 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon baking powder 
</P>
<P>
Dash salt 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups flour, sifted 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup milk 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon vanilla 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
</P>
<P>
15 to 20 crushed pecans 
</P>
<P>
Cream 6 tablespoons butter and 1 cup sugar. Add beaten egg, beating until 
smooth. Sift baking powder with salt and flour and add to creamed mixture 
alternately with milk and vanilla. Pour cake mixture in greased square or 
rectangular pan. Sprinkle cake with cinnamon and dot with remaining butter. Top 
with crushed pecans. Bake at 350 degrees 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after removing coffee cake from oven, boil remaining 1/2 cup sugar 
with 3 tablespoons cold water until ribbony but not crystallized. Pour glaze 
over cake. Cool before cutting. Makes about 9 servings.

YOU ASKED ABOUT: THE MYRIAD COOKING OILS DIFFER IN FLAVOR AND QUALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: Please tell me about the many different types of cooking oils I see 
in the markets. Are some more healthy? Can you buy one type of oil and use it 
for everything? What about olive oil -- is it better and how is it best used? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: There are indeed numerous cooking oils available, expressed from seeds, 
legumes, plants, fruits and nuts. Each differs in both flavor and cooking 
qualities, according to "Cooking A to Z" (Ortho Books: $32.95, 1988), edited by 
Jane Horn. 
</P>
<P>
The following information is excerpted from the book's listing of common edible 
oils: 
</P>
<P>
Almond Oil: toasty almond flavor; best used in salads and cold dishes; flavor 
destroyed by heat 
</P>
<P>
Avocado Oil: mild, buttery, delicate flavor; good for salad dressings and baked 
goods; may be used for sauteing, stir-frying and deep-frying 
</P>
<P>
Coconut Oil: coconut flavor; may be used for frying 
</P>
<P>
Corn Oil: bland flavor; excellent for frying 
</P>
<P>
Hazelnut Oil: strong toasted hazelnut flavor; use in combination with other oil 
for cold dishes; flavor destroyed by heat 
</P>
<P>
Olive Oil: available in several different grades; in increasing level of 
acidity, olive oil is classified as extra-virgin, superfine, fine and virgin or 
pure; excellent for salad dressings, marinades, sauces and sauteing; not suited 
for deep-frying 
</P>
<P>
Peanut Oil: subtle peanut flavor; use for salad dressings, sauteing and 
stir-frying 
</P>
<P>
Safflower Oil: flavorless; excellent for deep-frying; less suitable for salad 
dressings 
</P>
<P>
Sesame Oil: toasty, nutty flavor; Chinese is stronger in flavor than Japanese; 
heat alters flavor 
</P>
<P>
Soybean Oil: bland flavor; excellent for salad dressings; may be used for 
frying 
</P>
<P>
Walnut Oil: rich, nutty flavor; use sparingly; heat destroys flavor 
</P>
<P>
Oils are composed of three types of fatty acids: saturated, monounsaturated and 
polyunsaturated. Oils with more than one-third saturated fatty acids are termed 
saturated; those with less are unsaturated. Unsaturated oils are further 
classified into polyunsaturated and monounsaturated. 
</P>
<P>
Oils low in saturated fat are considered more healthful. The American Heart 
Assn. and the American Cancer Society recommend no more than 30% of the 
calories Americans consume come from fat. Of that 30%, less than 10% should be 
saturated fat, with the remaining divided equally between polyunsaturated fat 
and monounsaturated fat. 
</P>
<P>
Coconut oil, palm oil and palm kernel oil are all saturated fats. Safflower, 
sunflower, corn, soybean and cottonseed oils are polyunsaturated. Olive, peanut 
and canola oils are monounsaturated. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I tried your recipe for Rancho Bernardo Inn's walnut bread and it came out 
very well except for a burnt top and really dark crust all around and on the 
bottom. My loaf pans are glass, 8 1/2x4 1/2-inches. I baked the bread on the 
middle rack in my electric oven, set at 350 degrees. Do you have any 
suggestions? 
</P>
<P>
A: When baking in glass reduce the oven temperature by 25 degrees.

TODDLER DIES IN MOBILE HOME FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN and JONATHAN GAW, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An 18-month-old boy died Wednesday after a fire erupted in his family's mobile 
home at a rural San Marcos nursery. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials said the blaze apparently erupted in the single-wide trailer's 
stove, burning a baby-sitter on her arms and face. The woman, identified as 
Thodosea Dominguez, escaped from the trailer, but the child, Jose de los 
Angeles, died in a back bedroom where he had been sleeping. 
</P>
<P>
The child's parents, identified as Juan Garcia and Maria de los Angeles, work 
at the nursery Posie Express in the 3200 block of Twin Oaks Valley Road. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez, 29, was in serious condition at the UCSD Medical Center burn 
facility, suffering from smoke inhalation and second-degree burns over 15% of 
her body, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The boy's mother was in the nursery's office when the fire broke out, and Juan 
Garcia was making deliveries at the time, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Blusius, general manager of the nursery, said he arrived on the scene from 
Los Angeles about 1:15 p.m. and saw the mobile home in flames. 
</P>
<P>
"I ran into the office and told them to call the Fire Department," he said, 
"but the home was already fully engulfed." 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters from the San Marcos Fire Protection District arrived within five 
minutes, Blusius said, but could do little other than to save the adjacent 
greenhouses. The fire was extinguished in 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Blusius said the couple had worked at his company, a wholesale rose grower, for 
more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
American Red Cross officials said the baby-sitter had been working for the 
family for about two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Three other children, boys aged 13, 8, and 6, were in school at the time of the 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
Gloria Kilian of the Carlsbad-based Trauma Intervention Programs said the 
nonprofit agency is soliciting donations of bedding, food, clothing and cash 
for the family. 
</P>
<P>
"They lost everything they had," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Cross will put the family up in a nearby motel for a week. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second residential fire within a week in northern San Diego County 
in which children have died. Last Friday, a 15-year-old boy and a 2-year-old 
girl who were cousins died when a fire caused by an electrical short swept 
through their mothers' home in Encinitas.

SALINAS INJECTS SELF INTO FIELD HAND'S CASE 
</P>

President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico has personally telephoned the 
Mexican consulate in San Diego to express his concern about the case of a 
Mexican field hand allegedly kidnaped and beaten by two Carlsbad brothers 
outside their market earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
Salinas, who has on many occasions referred sympathetically to the plight of 
Mexican laborers in the United States, telephoned the San Diego office Tuesday 
morning and stressed his desire that the matter be pursued vigorously, said 
Armando Beteta, the Mexican consul general. Such a call is highly unusual. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised," Beteta said Wednesday. "He was most interested in how we 
were handling it. . . . He is obviously very concerned about the well-being of 
Mexican citizens in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
The president's action underlines the degree of interest that the case has 
generated in Mexico, where a number of graphic accounts of the crime have been 
published. 
</P>
<P>
The action also illustrates how Salinas is increasingly attempting to portray 
himself as a champion of the rights of Mexican immigrants abroad, a striking 
contrast to recent Mexican presidents, who have condemned abuse of citizens but 
done little else. Some say that Salina, elected by a slim and much-disputed 
majority in 1988, may be attempting to broaden his political base, particularly 
in response to challenges from Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, a political rival who has 
spoken out strongly on behalf of Mexican workers north of the border. 
</P>
<P>
The case at hand involves Candido Salas, a 26-year-old laborer from Mexico, who 
was allegedly kidnaped and beaten Jan. 3 outside the Country Store market along 
El Camino Real in Carlsbad. Police have charged two brothers, Rickey Ryberg, 
the store owner, and his brother, Randy, with a host of violations in 
connection with the matter, including kidnaping and battery. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, the brothers bound Salas' arms and legs with duct tape and 
placed a bag on his head, on which was written No Mas Aqui, or No More Here. 
The area outside the store is a major gathering point for immigrant laborers 
seeking employment from passing motor 
</P>
<P>
ists. 
</P>
<P>
The Rybergs have denied the kidnaping charges, saying instead that they have 
detained migrant workers at their store for police pickup. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation has also entered the case and is 
investigating possible civil rights violations. 
</P>
<P>
Rights activists say the alleged attack illustrates an escalating trend of 
abuse against immigrant laborers in fast-growing northern San Diego County, 
where thousands of poor migrants reside in shabby dwellings in open fields, 
often not far from high-priced homes, and gather in the roadways and at 
intersections each day seeking work. There has been considerable friction 
between the immigrant laborers, who mostly speak Spanish, and English-speaking, 
mostly non-Latino residents. 
</P>
<P>
The Mexican consulate in San Diego has assisted Salas in his legal case. With 
the consulate's help, Salas has retained Marco Lopez, a San Diego attorney who 
is handling several other alleged rights-abuse cases. Salas plans to file a 
civil abuse case seeking damages against the two brothers later this week, said 
Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
Each Mexican consulate has a citizen protection section, but critics have long 
charged that the consulates have done relatively little on behalf of citizens 
complaining of having been victimized in the United States. Rights activists 
have long alleged that U.S. immigration authorities, local police officials and 
U.S. citizens have routinely mistreated Mexican nationals, particularly in 
California and the Southwest, home of the largest concentrations of immigrants 
from south of the border. 
</P>
<P>
Salinas, however, apparently has decided to project himself as an advocate for 
the rights of Mexican emigrants to the United States, and the consulates appear 
to have a key role to play in his policy.

FORMER CONGRESSMAN, WWI MEDAL WINNER DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A former San Diego congressman and the last surviving World War I Medal of 
Honor recipient, retired Navy Lt. Cmdr. Edouard Victor Michel Izac, died in his 
sleep last Thursday in Virginia. He was 100 years old. 
</P>
<P>
Izac was aboard the troop transport President Lincoln on May 31, 1918, when a 
German submarine sank it with three torpedoes. Captured by a German U-boat, he 
was able to glean strategic information about German submarines in the 
Atlantic. Izac tried several times to escape, once by jumping out the window of 
a moving train en route to a prison camp in Villingen, Baden. But, having 
injured his knees and head, he was recaptured. 
</P>
<P>
Izac eventually escaped, trekking through the mountains of southwest Germany 
and swimming across the Rhine River so that he could relay the information. 
</P>
<P>
"Even among Medal of Honor winners, Izac stands out as a particularly heroic 
figure," said retired Rear Adm. Gene La Roque, director of the Center for 
Defense Information in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Then-assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt presented the 
Congressional Medal of Honor to Izac on Nov. 11, 1920, the highest honor that 
can be bestowed on a serviceman. It was an honor, friends and family say, that 
Izac played down. 
</P>
<P>
"He never considered himself a hero; he said he did what anybody would do," 
said his daughter, Suzanne S. Quinlan, who lives in Fairfax, Va. Izac died in 
her home. 
</P>
<P>
He chose a quiet life and dedicated himself to his family. Until two years ago, 
Izac split wood and cultivated an ample garden at his Bethesda, Md., home that 
furnished his neighbors with strawberries and tomatoes. 
</P>
<P>
And his promptness became legendary. Neighbors say they could almost set their 
clocks by Izac, who left his house promptly each week for Saturday evening 
Mass. He was a devout Catholic. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Cresco, Iowa, Izac attended the Naval Academy after fudging about his 
age, making himself two years younger. Izac graduated in 1915 and soon after 
married Agnes Cabell, daughter of Army Gen. De Rosey Carroll Cabell, a San 
Diego resident. 
</P>
<P>
When the war was over, Izac appeared before a claims commission and charged the 
Germans with brutality. As part of his evidence, he produced the court-martial 
records of the German soldier who had been convicted of destroying government 
property after smashing his rifle stock on Izac's head. Izac received $20,000 
and later published an account of his experiences in a book, "Prisoner of the 
U-90." 
</P>
<P>
In 1921, Izac and his family moved to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"Grandfather Cabell ordered his daughter to San Diego," explained Cabell Berge, 
Izac's oldest daughter. And, Cabell also helped the young man get a job, at the 
San Diego Union. But Izac had political aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
Izac became a U.S. congressman, representing San Diego from 1937 to 1947. A 
Democrat and Administration supporter, he voted for New Deal legislation and 
the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and against the 
poll tax. He also voted against permanent status for the House Committee on 
Un-American Activities. 
</P>
<P>
"To be in Congress for 10 years is quite an honor, and everybody thought he did 
a good job," said Olive McAndrews, whose late husband, Joseph Patrick, ran 
Izac's last campaign. 
</P>
<P>
But, in his own San Diego district, Izac was not as well known by today's 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
"Izac was the last of an era of congressmen -- unable to frequently fly back 
and forth, he stayed mostly in Washington," said former Rep. Lionel Van 
Deerlin. "He thought he had been elected to help run the country and didn't pay 
that much attention to running his district." 
</P>
<P>
Still others thought Izac had helped the Navy more than he helped the city, 
which led to his defeat by Republican Charles Fletcher. 
</P>
<P>
"He was very supportive of the military, and, towards the end of his term, he 
had become somewhat complacent. The city wanted more roads, a better way to get 
to Los Angeles, and dams," said former San Diego Councilman Bill Cleator, who 
had worked as a youth on Fletcher's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"And there was this big, tall good-looking guy -- Charlie Fletcher -- 
interested in improving the quality of life." 
</P>
<P>
When Izac lost to Fletcher, his defeat marked one of only two times since the 
Depression that Republicans controlled the House of Representatives, Van 
Deerlin said. After his loss, Izac decided to settle in Louisa County, Va., 
where his wife had inherited a 600-acre Gordonsville farm. There, Izac raised 
cattle and created a 2-mile lake, which still bears the name Lake Izac. The 
couple eventually moved to Bethesda, where his wife died in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
Izac suffered a devastating blow in 1953 when his second-youngest child, 
Forrest, committed suicide at age 19. The note he left said that he could never 
live to be the kind of hero that his father was, said Quinlan. 
</P>
<P>
Izac turned to his family, gardening and writing. In the years after his son's 
death, he wrote a travel book about Israel, "The Holy Land, Then and Now." 
</P>
<P>
Izac is survived by five children, 19 grandchildren and 25 great-grandchildren. 
Funeral services were held Tuesday at Arlington National Cemetery.

ENCINITAS BEACH GOES TO DOGS, WITH CITY'S HELP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Encinitas City Council voted Wednesday night to allow dogs to run unleashed 
along Beacon's Beach for a six-month trial period but limited the hours during 
the summer. 
</P>
<P>
In a unanimous vote, the five-member council decided that dogs would have their 
day during the fall and winter months but that between Memorial Day and Labor 
Day they would be restricted to morning and evening hours. Dogs can run 
unleashed from 5 a.m. to 10 a.m. and from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m., giving working 
owners of dogs ample time to exercise their pets. 
</P>
<P>
The council, with about 100 people in attendance, also decided to change the 
location of the dog beach, deciding to map a three-quarter-mile area from 
Beacon's Beach north to Grandview Beach, an area the council said was 
less-populated by non-dog owners. The city's Parks and Recreation Commission 
had recommended that the dog beach stretch from Beacon's Beach south to the 
Stone Steps access. 
</P>
<P>
The decision becomes effective in March. 
</P>
<P>
City officials had expected the strong turnout for the meeting after proponents 
on both sides of the issue began making phone calls and circulating flyers to 
stir up support for the issue in recent days. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday night, more than 30 residents spoke out on the issue including 
animal advocates, surfers, grade schoolers, construction workers, lifeguards, a 
lawyer and a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
Two-thirds of the speakers were in favor of the dog beach and denied claims 
that the dogs andtheir owners would cause either health hazards or traffic 
tie-ups in the North County city. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Brad Schwartz told the council that, in his years as a practicing 
physician, he had never seen a disease transmitted from a animal to a person 
through dog droppings. He also said he had never seen a case of dog bite from 
any North County beach. Running dogs there reduces their stress. he said. 
</P>
<P>
"By allowing dogs on the beach, you may even reduce the number of dog bites in 
the city." Cita Walsh told the council that dogs on a beach are part of the 
American way. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen poop go unscooped, and never seen a person who hadn't stopped 
to pet my collie and smile," said the La Costa resident, adding that she and 
her pet are regular Beacon's Beach users. "The issue of dogs at Beacon's Beach 
is what's America is all about. I'd be surprised if you didn't see McDonald's 
and Pepsi begin shooting commercials there." 
</P>
<P>
Dog owners said the beach provides the perfect area for people to exercise 
their pets in an area not threatened by automobile traffic. About a dozen dog 
owners cleaned up the beach in weeks before the meeting and fashioned plastic 
pooper-scoopers to be left at the beach for public use. 
</P>
<P>
Other residents, however, claim the animals not only cause a nuisance with 
their constant barking and excrement but are threatening the ecologically 
sensitive bluffs with their constant running. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy began last summer before the county turned over to Encinitas 
operation of several miles of coastal beaches including Beacon's. In June, the 
City Council asked the Parks and Recreation Commission to review the issue and 
make a recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
The county had allowed leashed dogs on the beach and even looked the other way 
when the animals roamed freely, dog owners said. 
</P>
<P>
The parks and recreation board formed an ad hoc committee of proponents of both 
sides of the issue and met for a public hearing in October. In the meantime, 
dogs were allowed unleashed on Beacon's Beach. 
</P>
<P>
At that meeting, the Parks and Recreation Commission, by a 5-2 vote, 
recommended that unleashed dogs be allowed to run on the three-quarter-mile 
stretch of beach between Beacon's Beach and the Stone Steps access. 
</P>
<P>
The group also recommended that owners be required to stay with their pets and 
clean up any excrement. 
</P>
<P>
Detractors of the measure warned that the dogs might pose a danger to coastal 
birds and marine mammals washed ashore, as well as elderly people making the 
somewhat steep descent from the parking lot of Beacon's Beach. 
</P>
<P>
But not all council members were buying such dire forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all fear, and I'm having a hard time buying all of it," Councilwoman 
Marjorie Gaines said of the concerns before Wednesday night's meeting. "The 
beach has traditionally been a place where people have a sense of freedom. 
We've got too many regulations already." 
</P>
<P>
Gaines, who owns four dogs, said she can understand why people might want the 
animals along for protection. She cited two rapes that occurred on the beach in 
the last three years, one in broad daylight.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNTY ORDERS COST STUDY ON TRUCK DELIVERY 
CURBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors this week ordered a cost analysis 
study on a traffic and smog reduction plan that would ban truck deliveries at 
all 1,900 county government sites during peak traffic hours. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Ed Edelman argued that the plan should not be implemented until 
county departments determine whether the necessary changes in scheduling would 
increase the county's payroll costs. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who authored the proposal, and Chief Administrative 
Officer Richard Dixon maintained the plan would not lead to additional costs. 
But Edelman, with the support of Supervisor Pete Schabarum, was successful in 
delaying a vote on the plan for 30 days while a cost analysis is prepared. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich's proposal would also idle the county's fleet of 400 trucks during 
rush hours.

POWAY VOTERS TO DECIDE ON ELECTING MAYOR THEMSELVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Poway City Council members have decided that its time for the city to have a 
mayor chosen by the people and not by council members. In a 4-1 vote Tuesday 
night, the council approved placing the issue before voters June 5. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Don Higginson, the lone negative vote on the measure, said he is 100% for 
popular election of a mayor but disagrees on the timing of the ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
Higginson said he favors placing the issue on the November ballot to give 
everyone a fair try at the mayoral post. 
</P>
<P>
He said that, if the measure is approved in June, talented but relatively 
unrecognized Poway residents will have little chance of winning against 
incumbent council members who might run for the mayor's seat in November. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a fact that 99% of incumbents are reelected," Higginson said, calling it 
an issue of "equality or equity" to delay a vote on the measure until November. 
If a mayoral election did not take effect until 1992, he said, it would give 
newcomers a chance at the office, because "it takes a good year and a half to 
mount a campaign." 
</P>
<P>
Three council members will be up for reelection in November -- Higginson, Carl 
Kruse and Linda Brannon. Two other council members, Jan Goldsmith and Bob 
Emery, with two years remaining in their four-year terms, could run for mayor 
without fear of losing their council seats if they lost a mayoral bid. Kruse 
has said he will not seek reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Poway council members now annually select a council member to serve as mayor 
for one year. The same appointive system is used in Del Mar, Encinitas, Lemon 
Grove and Solana Beach. In the other 18 cities in San Diego County, citizens 
elect a mayor for two- or four-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
Higginson also pointed out that delaying a vote on the mayoral issue until 
November would save the city $7,000 in election expenses.

LATINOS ATTACK FLYERS IN RANCHO BERNARDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Latinos charged Wednesday that Rancho Bernardo residents are heightening racial 
tensions by passing out handbills to citizens urging them to "be safe at home" 
and fight crime by displaying signs aimed at discouraging migrants from 
soliciting day labor. 
</P>
<P>
The controversial flyer was distributed earlier this month as an insert in the 
Bernardo News, a community weekly newspaper with a circulation of 17,000. The 
bottom message is written in Spanish and English and reads: "No Hay Trabajo! No 
work available! Please do not disturb us." Residents are encouraged to display 
the sign "on your front door." 
</P>
<P>
"This should discourage those people seeking employment from disturbing you," 
says the handbill. The flyer's message also says that "recent criminal events 
in Rancho Bernardo have given each of us cause to change our habits. That's why 
we're providing you with this sign." 
</P>
<P>
Real estate agents Jim Abbott and Bill Opie authored and paid for the flyer. 
Abbott, who said he has a degree in Spanish literature and speaks Spanish 
fluently, defended the flyer and denied that it is racist or aimed specifically 
at migrant workers. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see anything racist with the flyer," Abbott said. "I had no idea that 
it was going to raise such controversy. I see this as being no different from 
receiving a ballot written in two languages or signs at the airport written in 
two languages." 
</P>
<P>
However, Bea Estrada, president of the local chapter of the League of United 
Latin American Citizens, and other activists in the Latino community complained 
that the flyer is lumping hundreds of migrant workers who live in camps around 
Rancho Bernardo in with criminals. 
</P>
<P>
"It is racist. We have enough problems between both communities up there 
already without someone stirring up the pot like this," Estrada said. 
</P>
<P>
Al Ducheny, of the Harborview Community Council near Logan Heights, charged 
that the flyer is "stigmatizing all Hispanics as criminals and (intended to) 
run them out of the community." He scoffed at claims by Abbott that the signs 
are meant to reduce crime by discouraging people from applying for work. 
</P>
<P>
"The logic is really sinister. Do they really think that, by putting up a sign 
that says no work available, you're going to keep criminals away," Ducheny 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardo News Publisher Barbara Warden said she saw nothing wrong with the 
flyer. 
</P>
<P>
"That was my best call. It didn't come across to me as racist," Warden said. 
</P>
<P>
Abbott and Warden pointed to three incidents that occurred late last year, when 
residents were allegedly approached by people posing as day laborers and 
robbed. The victims were tied up while their homes were ransacked, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"Crime problems are increasing. We're seeing an emerging MO (method of 
operation) from people posing as day laborers who would knock on the door and 
proceed to go inside the house," Abbott said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Lt. Mike Gillespie of the San Diego Police Department's Northeast 
Division said migrants have not contributed to the crime problem in Rancho 
Bernardo. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot recall any cases where we have arrested a migrant, or have been 
looking for migrants as suspects. . . . Any characterization that migrants are 
involved in crime is untrue, unfair and extremely unfortunate," Gillespie said.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FUMES FROM DRAIN FORCE 50 TO FLEE YMCA 
BUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 50 people were evacuated from the Pomona Valley YMCA building Wednesday 
after drain-cleaning chemicals mixed and filled the building with fumes. 
</P>
<P>
Fourteen people required medical treatment and three were hospitalized, 
including William Hampton, 54, the YMCA's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona Fire Captain Ron Bozarth said YMCA workers had poured a drain cleaner 
containing sulfuric acid down a clogged drinking fountain. When the drain 
remained closed, he said, workers opened the drain pipe and sulfuric acid 
spilled out. A reaction between the acid and solutions that had been poured 
down the drain earlier also produced fumes. 
</P>
<P>
Hampton and Luis Moran, 29, a maintenance worker, received burns and were 
overcome by the fumes. They were hospitalized along with staff member Daisy 
Mergerson, 36, who complained of throat discomfort. A spokeswoman at Pomona 
Valley Hospital Medical Center said all three were in stable condition.

MERCHANT MARINE VETERANS INCH CLOSER TO GETTING FLOATING MUSEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL STOLBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During the course of his long-running battle with the Port of Los Angeles, 
Joseph B. Vernick, a feisty former merchant seaman who is trying to convert a 
mothballed cargo ship into a floating museum, once predicted that he would win 
his fight bit by bit. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just chipping away little by little," said the 76-year-old Vernick, who 
heads a group that is pressing the port for a permanent berth for the vessel. 
</P>
<P>
True to his prediction, Vernick has just carved out another little chip. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the Los Angeles Board of Harbor Commissioners authorized the port 
staff to study possible berthing sites and to spend up to $15,000 to hire a 
marine surveyor to assess the cost of refurbishing the ship, the 45-year-old 
Lane Victory. 
</P>
<P>
"Two or three years ago, they told us there's not an inch of space for us," 
Vernick said in an interview Tuesday night. "Now they say there'll always be a 
place for the Lane Victory in Los Angeles Harbor." 
</P>
<P>
Although port officials don't go that far, they do say they are committed to 
working to find a spot for the ship. Just where that might be, however, remains 
a matter of dispute. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Congress granted the 455-foot, 7,000-ton ship to Vernick's group, the 
U.S. Merchant Marine Veterans World War II. Ever since, the group -- which 
claims 7,000 members nationwide -- has set its sights on obtaining the Port of 
Los Angeles' Berth 87, near the Los Angeles Maritime Museum in San Pedro, as a 
permanent home for their ship. 
</P>
<P>
But port officials have repeatedly said that berth is needed as a cargo 
terminal. In a report to the commissioners Wednesday, the port staff said it 
has identified four alternative sites: Berth 84 in San Pedro, also near the 
Maritime Museum; Berth 93E in San Pedro, north of the World Cruise Center; 
Berths 184-186 in Wilmington, near a proposed recreational waterfront 
development, and Berth 53 in San Pedro, near where the ship is now temporarily 
docked. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Vernick gave various reasons -- lack of parking and inconvenient 
access among them -- as to why those berths are unacceptable. "We're gonna get 
87," he declared. 
</P>
<P>
But Wednesday, he appeared to soften, especially after Wilmington activists 
Gertrude Schwab and Simie Seaman told commissioners they would like to see the 
ship come to their community. 
</P>
<P>
"Long Beach has the Queen Mary," Schwab said. "San Francisco has the Jeremiah 
O'Brien. San Diego has the Star of India and Wilmington could have the Lane 
Victory." 
</P>
<P>
Asked what he thought of that, Vernick replied, "Everything's a possibility." 
</P>
<P>
Ron Kennedy, port director of operations, said the ship's final location will 
depend on how much it will cost to make each site suitable for the Lane Victory 
and also on the marine surveyor's study. 
</P>
<P>
The surveyor will be asked to determine the cost of refurbishing the vessel for 
use as a museum. In addition, because the veterans have said their long-range 
plans include using the vessel for occasional harbor tours, the Harbor 
Department wants the surveyor to estimate the cost of putting the Lane Victory 
into working order. 
</P>
<P>
Port spokeswoman Julia Nagano described the marine survey as "a rather unusual 
move for us," given that the Harbor Department has no plans to pay for the 
refurbishing effort. But she said the department needs a concrete estimate of 
what the project will cost. 
</P>
<P>
Both Nagano and Kennedy said the veterans have failed to provide the port 
estimates of what it will cost to restore the ship and have not said how much 
money they have raised for the effort. Vernick also declined to provide details 
of the group's fund raising to a reporter, although he did estimate his 
organization will need about $500,000 to make the ship into a museum. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said the group recently received federal tax exempt status from 
the Internal Revenue Service, which may make it easier for the veterans to 
obtain corporate funding for their effort. 
</P>
<P>
For Vernick and his fellow World War II veterans, Wednesday's decision by the 
commissioners was yet another step in a long fight to gain recognition for 
their comrades who died at sea. The group has spent countless hours writing 
letters, making phone calls and seeking political support for its project. 
Vernick said that he will see that the Harbor Department finds a suitable spot 
for the Lane Victory, if it's the last thing he does. 
</P>
<P>
"They never ran across a bunch of determined old geezers like us," he said. 
"You know, I'm up in years, and I've gone through a lot in my life. In addition 
to being a prisoner of war for three years, I've had two open heart surgeries, 
and I'm still in there battling. . . . It's because we have a purpose."

JOB OFFER TO OUSTED HAWTHORNE MAYOR BLASTED AS 'CRONYISM' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Hawthorne Mayor Joseph Miller, who along with two councilmen was ousted 
from office after a bitter recall election in 1982, has been offered a job as 
the city's economic development director. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager R. Kenneth Jue said he offered Miller the $52,000-a-year job on 
Monday. In an interview Wednesday, Miller said he was "seriously considering" 
the offer. 
</P>
<P>
The economic development director, a position that has been vacant for about 2 
1/2 years, is responsible for attracting new businesses to Hawthorne Boulevard, 
the city's strongest tax-producing sector. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Ginny Lambert criticized the offer as "cronyism at its best," but 
Mayor Betty J. Ainsworth and two other council members said they support Jue's 
action. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Wednesday, Lambert said that Jue and Miller are longtime 
friends, and she questioned why Jue did not advertise the vacancy and select a 
director from a pool of candidates. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really a slap in the face to the people of this city," Lambert said. 
</P>
<P>
But Ainsworth said she does not question Jue's selection of Miller, although 
she said that perhaps Jue should have advertised the position. "I thought he 
was going to interview several people," Ainsworth said. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews Wednesday, Jue and Miller acknowledged that they are longtime 
friends but adamantly denied the charges of cronyism. 
</P>
<P>
Jue said he offered Miller the position, not out of friendship, but because of 
Miller's knowledge of how City Hall works and his close ties to important 
business interests in the city. 
</P>
<P>
He said he did not advertise the position because he believed Miller would be 
the best-qualified person for the job. He also said he decided to fill the 
vacant post because he wants to upgrade the quality of businesses on Hawthorne 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, 64, a former Hawthorne police officer and 17-year council member who 
now works as a public relations and development director for Hawthorne 
Community Hospital, said he is well qualified for the job and is upset about 
Lambert's accusations. 
</P>
<P>
"I would never pass judgment on her occupation because I don't know what she 
does. . . . I condemn her for condemning me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As for his qualifications, Miller said he played a vital role in securing 
financing for the construction of the Hawthorne Plaza shopping mall in 1977 and 
also played a role in getting funds to build the new City Hall in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Miller left City Hall in 1982 when he and Councilmen Bruce Gies and Larry Guyer 
were recalled by decisive margins. The three had stirred community anger by 
voting to consolidate city and school elections, thus adding about 19 months to 
Miller's and Gies' terms. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said that if Miller is hired he would be able to re-enroll in 
the city's pension program, in which he had been enrolled while a police 
officer. After serving for a minimum of five years, he would be entitled to a 
pension of 10% of the highest salary he earned as a city employee. 
</P>
<P>
Raymon Sulser, a city activist and former planning commissioner, criticized the 
offer, noting that Miller was one of four council members who voted in 1977 to 
promote Jue from city engineer to city manager. He accused Jue, who is retiring 
at the end of the year, of offering the post to Miller as a way of returning 
the favor. 
</P>
<P>
"It's time we get a new city manager," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Councilman Steven Andersen said he supports Jue's decision and believes 
Miller is qualified for the job. He said he does not believe the offer was an 
act of favoritism because Jue has already announced his retirement and does not 
need to return any favors. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a lame duck," Andersen said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Charles (Chuck) Bookhammer said he supports Jue's right to hire 
whoever he thinks is qualified. Bookhammer said he does not think Jue should be 
required to advertise when he wants to fill a vacancy as long as the candidate 
is qualified for the job. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman David M. York could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Don Harris, a real estate broker who unsuccessfully ran for mayor in November, 
criticized Jue for not advertising the position and questioned whether the city 
needs an economic development director. 
</P>
<P>
Harris said that instead of hiring Miller the city could save money by 
organizing a committee of residents and business owners to help attract 
merchants to Hawthorne Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Sulser said he is forming a committee of citizens that will meet Monday night 
to consider recalling members of the council who have voiced support for Jue's 
decision.

STOLEN TRUCK LEADS POLICE ON LOW-SPEED, 12-MILE CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIPP GOLLNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
Police pursued a stolen semitrailer truck loaded with 24 tons of plywood 
through congested San Fernando Valley streets Wednesday after an employee of 
the company that owns the truck sighted it on the freeway and called the 
California Highway Patrol on his car phone, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The pursuit wound its way over 12 miles of surface streets in North Hollywood, 
Van Nuys and Studio City before the driver jumped out on Coldwater Canyon 
Avenue about 3:25 p.m. and hid in thick brush north of Mulholland Drive, said 
Los Angeles Police Sgt. Joe Brazas. About 10 minutes later, a Los Angeles 
police helicopter saw him in a ravine, where he was arrested, Brazas said. 
</P>
<P>
William Epperly, 34, of Whittier was being held on suspicion of grand theft at 
the Police Department's Van Nuys station jail, Brazas said. 
</P>
<P>
Three Los Angeles police patrol cars and a Highway Patrol car pursued the truck 
for about 35 minutes, at speeds that never reached more than 35 m.p.h., Brazas 
said. The truck did not hit other vehicles, despite running several red lights 
at major intersections, and there were no injuries, Brazas said. 
</P>
<P>
Police followed the truck, lights flashing and sirens wailing, but did not try 
to force it to halt. Under department policy, officers do not try to block a 
fleeing vehicle's path or run it off the road "unless there's an immediate, 
clear and present threat to someone's life," Sgt. John Rygh said. 
</P>
<P>
"Especially if he's driving a heavy rig loaded with thousands of pounds of 
merchandise," Rygh said. 
</P>
<P>
Police were guided to the truck by Robert H. Sharpless, a salesman for 
Panel-Tex, a City of Industry firm that manufactures and sells plywood 
paneling. Sharpless said thieves broke into the company's yard Tuesday night 
and loaded the $18,000 worth of plywood onto the truck with a forklift that 
they had hot-wired. 
</P>
<P>
"I had just gotten onto the I-5 northbound from the Harbor and looked over to 
the right, and there's our company truck with a load of plywood on it," 
Sharpless said. 
</P>
<P>
"It blew me away. I couldn't believe it. 
</P>
<P>
"I called my boss on the car phone and asked him if he hired a driver with a 
beard today and shipped any more plywood out today, and he said, 'Hell, no!' 
and said 'Get off the phone right now and call 911.' " 
</P>
<P>
Sharpless said he followed the truck as it continued north on the Golden State, 
Ventura and Hollywood freeways before getting off at Sherman Way. He said he 
stayed on the phone with a Highway Patrol dispatcher, giving the location of 
the truck and arranging to alert waiting patrol cars by turning on his 
emergency flashers when he passed them. 
</P>
<P>
"I turned on my emergency flashers when I saw the CHP on Sherman Way, the 
officer pulled up beside me and I pointed out to him that was the truck," 
Sharpless said. 
</P>
<P>
Sharpless said he lost sight of the truck when he had to stop for a red light 
at Woodman Avenue, but the Highway Patrol continued the pursuit and was joined 
by Los Angeles police cars. 
</P>
<P>
The abandoned truck blocked both lanes of Coldwater Canyon for more than half 
an hour before it could be moved out of traffic. It backed up southbound 
traffic to Ventura Boulevard and brought northbound traffic to a halt at 
Mulholland Drive, Brazas said.

SANTA CLARITA RESIDENTS CRITICIZE ELSMERE DUMP; 
</P>
<P>
LANDFILL: A PUBLIC FORUM ATTRACTS MORE THAN 200 PEOPLE. THE MAYOR VOWS TO FIGHT 
THE LOS ANGELES CITY-COUNTY PLAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
At a public forum attended by more than 200 people Wednesday night, the Santa 
Clarita City Council heard overwhelming opposition to plans to open a garbage 
dump outside the city in Elsmere Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
One after another, residents called on the council to oppose the dump, saying 
they feared the landfill would pollute the city's water supply. "This whole 
area could be contaminated," said Gil Callowhill, a director of the Castaic 
Lake Water Agency. 
</P>
<P>
The council took no vote Wednesday, but Mayor Jo Anne Darcy said, "We will do 
everything we can possible, legally and otherwise, to fight this landfill." 
</P>
<P>
The city and county of Los Angeles last month reached a tentative agreement to 
open a landfill in Elsmere Canyon, possibly as soon as 1995. An environmental 
impact report on the project is expected sometime this spring. 
</P>
<P>
The canyon is about two miles northeast of the interchange of the Antelope 
Valley and Golden State freeways, outside the Santa Clarita city limits. 
</P>
<P>
The city has no authority over the area and cannot directly block the city and 
county decision. But it could create legal obstacles to opening the dump by 
challenging its environmental impact in court. 
</P>
<P>
Resident Karen Pearson-Hall said Santa Clarita could not trust Los Angeles to 
protect the citizens of Santa Clarita. "I don't think we can count on them to 
treat us with the respect we need," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The forum was held to hear public comment on draft resolutions spelling out two 
possible courses of action for the Santa Clarita City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The first resolution says Santa Clarita will oppose a dump in Elsmere Canyon 
under any circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
The second resolution says Santa Clarita would not resist the landfill if it is 
environmentally sound and the city and county of Los Angeles meet a list of 18 
demands, including requests for land, money and extra environmental safeguards 
to protect Santa Clarita's water supply. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the resolution asks that the city of Los Angeles promise to 
supply Santa Clarita with water in case the dump pollutes the new city's wells. 
The resolution also demands that Los Angeles give Santa Clarita the defunct 
Saugus Rehabilitation Center, a 583-acre site owned by Los Angeles but located 
inside Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
Under the resolution Santa Clarita would also request a share of the dump's 
profits, about $1 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said it could take the council several weeks to decide between 
the two approaches. 
</P>
<P>
Before taking public testimony, two city employees detailed the competing 
resolutions, trying to gauge support for each measure. Asst. City Manager Ken 
Pulskamp endorsed the second resolution, saying the city should at least 
receive concessions if it is unable to fight the powerful forces that endorse 
the dump. 
</P>
<P>
"Ladies and gentlemen, no one wants a dump, no one. But let's not be 
foolhardy," Pulskamp said. 
</P>
<P>
The audience was not persuaded, and applauded each speaker who denounced the 
landfill. 
</P>
<P>
Pearson-Hall said Councilwoman Jan Heidt asked her earlier Wednesday whether 
she would be willing to see Santa Clarita spend $1 million of taxpayers' money 
to fight the Elsmere dump. Pearson-Hall turned to the audience and asked the 
same question. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes!" several people said. Others applauded. 
</P>
<P>
"I said the same thing," Pearson-Hall said. "Really, what price cancer?"

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2ND ZONING HEARING SCHEDULED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Manhattan Beach City Council will hold a second public hearing on a 
comprehensive zoning code revision Tuesday at 7:30 p.m. in council chambers. 
</P>
<P>
The initial hearing this week drew a sparse crowd, prompting Mayor Connie 
Sieber to say: "I'm shocked that there's not more community involvement." 
</P>
<P>
Some residents, however, blamed the city for not widely advertising the 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
The code revision, an 18-month project that has involved the Planning 
Commission, the council and a planning consultant, is designed to make zoning 
regulations conform to policies of the general plan adopted in February, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The major issue at Tuesday's hearing was the proposed reduction in the floor 
area ratio in the city's "tree section" south of Rosecrans Avenue. Some 
residents there have complained that trees are being removed to make way for 
oversized homes.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PROPOSAL MAPS OUT SYSTEM OF TRAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rancho Palos Verdes City Council members on Monday approved a plan that maps 
out a comprehensive network of pedestrian, equestrian and bicycle trails for 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, which deals with existing as well as proposed trails, was developed 
over a two-year span by a citizens committee appointed by council members. It 
now goes to city officials, who will determine how to implement it. 
</P>
<P>
The city and the peninsula have lost trails through the years because of 
development, said Barbara Dye, who chaired the committee. "This really protects 
us from losing trails inadvertently."

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BIDS FOR CULTURAL CENTER OPENED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The lowest construction bid for the Torrance Cultural Arts Center is $1.2 
million more than the nearly $11 million the city has budgeted for the project, 
but city officials plan to proceed despite the overrun. 
</P>
<P>
"There goes the contingency (fund)," Councilman Bill Applegate said after 
hearing of the bid opening Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"It won't be a problem." 
</P>
<P>
In an eight-way bidding war, Moran Construction Co. of Alhambra offered to 
erect the four-building complex for $12.23 million. The second-lowest bid was 
$12.37 million by Cates Construction of Lancaster, and the third-lowest was 
$12.47 million by Continental Heller of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
In 20 years of trying to build a cultural arts center, Torrance has run into 
numerous obstacles, mostly financial. In 1988, the City Council fired the 
complex's first architect because his design drew bids nearly 60% over budget. 
</P>
<P>
The center will include a 500-seat theater, a community meeting hall, dance and 
exercise rooms, music and crafts studios and a Japanese garden. Ground breaking 
has been scheduled for Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Philip Tilden, the city's management programs administrator, said city staff 
members will review the three lowest bids and recommend one of the construction 
firms to the council at its Jan. 30 meeting.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JAMES MITSCH NAMED CITY MANAGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Hawthorne City Council has unanimously selected Public Works Director James 
H. Mitsch to replace retiring City Manager R. Kenneth Jue. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsch, who will take over the position when Jue leaves his post Dec. 31, 1990, 
was chosen, as expected, at the council's Monday night meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsch, 51, came to Hawthorne in 1966 as assistant city engineer and has held 
several positions at City Hall, including that of acting city manager for 
almost a year in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
City officials call Mitsch a highly qualified replacement who understands the 
city's inner workings. 
</P>
<P>
Jue, 57, who has been with the city for 24 years, notified the council three 
weeks ago that he wanted to retire while he is young enough to enjoy some of 
his favorite pastimes, such as woodcraft and motorcycle riding. 
</P>
<P>
Jue became city manager in 1977 after being city engineer for 11 years. Before 
that, he served 13 years as assistant engineer with the city of Inglewood.

TORRANCE OKS PLANS FOR 90 TOWNHOUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANET RAE-DUPREE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Watt Industries Inc. has won final approval of plans to build 90 luxury 
townhouses in a private, gated community on the site of the former Torrance 
Drive-In, across Torrance Boulevard from Bishop Montgomery High School. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance City Council members debated the project for nearly two hours 
Wednesday before voting 4-2, with Mayor Katy Geissert and Councilwoman Dee 
Hardison opposed, to approve the project. 
</P>
<P>
City planners had urged the council to reject the project, saying they would 
have preferred a single-family residential development on the 14.87-acre site. 
But they said the townhouse project, reduced from an initial request for 97 
units, will meet city standards for that type of development. 
</P>
<P>
Watt spokesmen told neighbors in 1988 that the developer was considering a 
179-unit project with a small commercial strip, but such plans were never filed 
with the city. 
</P>
<P>
Several residents complained Wednesday that the single access road into the new 
community will create traffic hazards and endanger students from the high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
"Traffic already is so heavy on Torrance Boulevard that it's just outrageous," 
said Sumner Power, who lives just north of the drive-in site. "People come 
tearing around that curve without a thought." 
</P>
<P>
Jeffery Gibson, senior principal planner for the city, said Watt reduced the 
number of townhouses it had originally proposed building on the outside of the 
circular development from 34 to 25 to minimize the impact on surrounding 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
The townhouses, which are expected to cost an average of $525,000, will be 
detached units with two- and three-car garages and private yards either on one 
side or in the back. 
</P>
<P>
"The project is getting closer and closer and closer to a single-family 
project," Gibson said, noting that Watt, to meet planners' concerns, widened 
the streets, increased the average lot size and agreed to put fire sprinklers 
in the homes. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Keslake, president of Watt Land, a subsidiary of Watt Industries, said 
ground breaking will probably take place within six months. Families could 
begin moving into the first of three construction phases nine months after 
that, he said.

HIDDEN HILLS ANNEXATION OKD DESPITE PROTESTS; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: OPPONENTS ARE TOLD TO TAKE THEIR FIGHT TO THE CITY COUNCIL. THE 
CITY PLANS TO USE THE SITE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A Los Angeles County commission approved an annexation Wednesday that the city 
of Hidden Hills sought to provide land for affordable housing, advising 
residents who testified against the proposal to take their fight to the City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Local Agency Formation Commission, which makes annexation 
recommendations to the county Board of Supervisors, said their function was to 
rule only on the land annexation, not on development proposals for the site. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council supports a plan calling for 46 units of lower-cost housing for 
senior citizens. The project would be built on a portion of 25 acres the city 
would annex on the southern edge of its current boundary. 
</P>
<P>
"If the people don't like the annexation and what will happen with the 
annexation, the point is that you have to use your influence with your City 
Council to stop it," said Los Angeles County Supervisor Edmund D. Edelman, a 
member of the panel. 
</P>
<P>
LAFCO member James A. Van Horn Jr., from the Artesia City Council, told four 
residents who spoke against the annexation: "The vast majority of what I've 
heard from you are questions you have to determine at the ballot box." 
</P>
<P>
Two residents, Howard Klein and David Stanley, said they plan to do exactly 
that by running, along with a third candidate, for the council in the April 10 
election. 
</P>
<P>
The council has favored the lower-cost housing plan as a way to comply with 
state law and settle a lawsuit that was brought because the city used a 
redevelopment agency to help finance a flood-control project. State law 
requires 20% of redevelopment funds to be spent on affordable housing and 
requires cities to provide for affordable housing through its planning and 
zoning laws. 
</P>
<P>
Hidden Hills is a gated community of about 2,000 residents in estate-size 
houses. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been the most debated issue . . . in the history of Hidden Hills," 
said City Atty. Wayne K. Lemeiux. In an advisory poll conducted this month by 
the council, about two-thirds of the participants objected to some form of the 
council's affordable housing plan. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the hearing room, Stanley told reporters that residents who oppose the 
plan fear it will change the town's rural character. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't have a bunch of people who are bigots or who hate old people," 
Stanley said. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley and other residents told the commission that traffic and increased 
demand for city services were among their primary concerns. But LAFCO Executive 
Director Ruth Bennell earlier this month found that development of the area, as 
described by the city in its annexation application, would not significantly 
affect traffic or city services. 
</P>
<P>
Annexation still requires approval of the Board of Supervisors, and the Hidden 
Hills City Council still must hold public hearings on the issue of how the land 
will be developed.

2ND DEMOCRAT TO JOIN RACE FOR LA FOLLETTE'S ASSEMBLY SEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Irene Allert, a San Fernando Valley Democratic Party activist making her first 
run for elected office, said Wednesday she plans to campaign for the state 
Assembly seat held by Republican Marian W. La Follette of Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Allert, 45, a member of the executive committee of the Democratic Party of the 
San Fernando Valley, said she expects to have strong party backing in her 
campaign against La Follette, who is running for a sixth term in the 
GOP-dominated 38th Assembly District. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, La Follette easily bested her Democratic opponent, 65% to 35%. 
Registered Republicans outnumber Democrats in the district by nearly 87,000 to 
74,500. 
</P>
<P>
Allert is the second Democrat to announce plans to oppose La Follette. Also 
planning a challenge is Gary Crandall, a Northridge computer manual writer and 
member of the pro-environment "Greens." 
</P>
<P>
Allert said she plans to criticize La Follette for voting against preventive 
social programs involving family planning and health care. She cited La 
Follette's opposition to state funding for family planning clinics and to 
legislation setting up the controversial state task force on self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
"Money saved on these programs will come back to haunt us in terms of increased 
welfare and housing costs," Allert said. "I think Marian La Follette is myopic 
in a lot of her viewpoints." She described La Follette as antiabortion and 
herself as pro-choice. 
</P>
<P>
Allert, a Kagel Canyon resident, spent 13 years as a teacher at Portola Junior 
High School in Tarzana and now co-owns a business that provides science and 
health instructors and materials to schools. She also is a member of the 
Democratic Party state central committee and worked as a precinct organizer in 
Michael Dukakis' 1988 presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"I know the 38th District is considered a Republican stronghold, but I no 
longer feel like the people of the 38th are being properly represented," she 
said.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN GETS 12 YEARS IN PRISON FOR 6 ROBBERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 24-year-old Virginia man was sentenced Wednesday to 12 years in state prison 
for robbing six small businesses in North Hollywood and Toluca Lake last year. 
</P>
<P>
Troy Cheeks pleaded guilty on Jan. 3 to seven counts of armed robbery for 
stealing money from three restaurants, a doughnut shop, a flower shop and a 
yogurt shop between Jan. 12 and April 26 of last year, said Deputy Dist. Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Lori P. Dery. 
</P>
<P>
His plea came just after Dery completed her opening statement in his trial. 
</P>
<P>
Cheeks also pleaded guilty to one count of attempted murder for shooting Louis 
Enrique Torres in the shoulder during the Feb. 11 robbery of Little Caesar's 
Pizza restaurant, at 10600 Magnolia Blvd. in North Hollywood. Dery said Torres, 
a restaurant employee, had thwarted an earlier attempt by Cheeks to rob the 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Dery said Cheeks usually posed as a customer and often ordered something from 
his victims. Then, when the businesses were virtually empty, he returned to the 
checkout counter and demanded money. In some cases, he handed the employees a 
note, saying that he would kill them if they did not cooperate, Dery said. 
</P>
<P>
However, on Jan. 12, Torres refused to give Cheeks money and instead challenged 
Cheeks to show him his gun, Dery said. Cheeks said he was joking and did not 
have a gun, then left the restaurant. He returned a month later and shot Torres 
in the shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Cheeks was arrested on April 26, the day he robbed Melanie Krumm, a Toluca Lake 
florist. Later that evening, Krumm went to work out at a Nautilus Plus in 
Studio City, and she spotted Cheeks in the gym. She notified the health club 
manager, who took down Cheeks' license plate number. 
</P>
<P>
Police arrested him at his home later that evening.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MOTHER, 17, ARRESTED IN DEATH OF INFANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 17-year-old Van Nuys girl has been arrested on suspicion of killing her 
2-month-old son. 
</P>
<P>
The infant died Tuesday while undergoing treatment for head trauma, the Los 
Angeles Police Department reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The mother asked a neighbor to take her and her son, Juan Carlos Zuniga, to the 
hospital about 8 p.m. Monday, said Lt. Robert Iddings of the Police 
Department's child protection section. The mother told investigators that she 
"was giving the child a bath and noticed its head was very soft and the child 
didn't look quite right," Iddings said. 
</P>
<P>
The baby was conscious when it arrived at Valley Presbyterian Hospital, but his 
condition deteriorated, Iddings said. He died about 8:30 a.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives arrested the mother after interviewing witnesses Tuesday morning, 
Iddings said. He would not disclose what the witnesses said. The mother was 
being detained at Sylmar Juvenile Hall on suspicion of murder, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The mother lives with her boyfriend in an apartment on Hazeltine Avenue, he 
said. The boyfriend was not home Monday evening and is not considered a 
suspect, he said.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RESTAURANT OFFERS REWARD IN SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jack-In-The-Box restaurants offered a $5,000 reward Wednesday for information 
leading to the conviction of a man who shot the manager of the chain's outlet 
in San Fernando after robbing him in the restaurant's parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
The robber shot Armando Mendez in the arm after the manager handed over money 
he was planning to deposit at a bank and pleaded with him not to shoot, said 
San Fernando Police Detective David Harvey. 
</P>
<P>
The robbery occurred Jan. 10 in the 300 block of San Fernando Mission 
Boulevard, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman, possibly Latino, was described as between 18 and 25 years old, 
about 5 feet, 9 inches tall and 150 pounds, Long said. He was wearing a black 
shirt, white pants and black-and-white athletic shoes, Long said.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
NEW LEASE NEEDED ON FREE SPEECH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 265 residents of the Treasure Island Mobile Home Park in South Laguna would 
like to reach agreement on a new lease with the park's owners. But they're not 
quite prepared to barter away First Amendment rights of speech. 
</P>
<P>
Park owners propose, at the end of the 10-year lease, to pay tenants for their 
mobile homes before redeveloping the property. Fair enough. But they also 
propose to levy penalties of 25% to 50% of the value of the mobile home on any 
tenant who criticizes at a public forum or writes letters of opposition to the 
company's development plans. This is of course preposterous. 
</P>
<P>
One Treasure Island Mobile Home partner defended the clause as fair, even after 
many tenants publicly denounced the proposal as economic blackmail. He said 
that since the company had made economic concessions, it didn't want to offer 
tenants a lease if "they were going to continue to oppose us." 
</P>
<P>
The company categorically rejects the idea that the proposed lease infringes on 
tenants' rights. If the new owners of the mobile-home park truly believe that, 
what they reallyought to be reading are the clauses covering rights of dissent 
in a document drawn up more than 200 years ago, starting with its First 
Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to decide which is more objectionable: the attempt by Treasure 
Island Associates, the park's owner, to stifle residents' rights of free speech 
or the company's defense of that approach. Both took an overabundance of gall.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: LA JOLLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A transient pleaded guilty Wednesday to trying to kill a worshiper at a La 
Jolla church last year. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Perrellis, 42, admitted shooting Michelle Gallagher, 40, on March 2 as 
she was leaving Mary Star of the Sea Roman Catholic Church. 
</P>
<P>
A second attempted-murder charge was dismissed. It involved another incident 
that day, in which Colette Cholaki, 24, told police that Perrellis pointed a 
gun at her in a parking lot. Cholaki said the weapon misfired and she quickly 
drove away. 
</P>
<P>
Perrellis' sentencing was set for Feb. 21 by San Diego Superior Court Judge 
Jesus Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a mandatory prison case," Deputy Dist. Atty. George Beall said. "She's 
looking at an exposure of 14 years." 
</P>
<P>
Perrellis was deemed mentally incompetent to stand trial three weeks after the 
incidents and spent most of 1989 in a state mental hospital. 
</P>
<P>
However, officials at Patton State Hospital in San Bernardino County deemed she 
had recovered, and she was remanded to San Diego for trial last November. 
</P>
<P>
The motive for the attacks remains unknown. 
</P>
<P>
"She's very unstable, but it didn't amount to a viable defense," Beall said. 
</P>
<P>
Perrellis' attorney, Richard Lepore of Redlands, could not be reached for 
comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Gallagher told police she was in the church foyer when the woman approached her 
and asked where the confessional was. 
</P>
<P>
Upon leaving, Gallagher said, she was shot in the back with the woman's 
Derringer. 
</P>
<P>
Beall said Wednesday that Gallagher has returned to work as a real estate agent 
but still has pain and cannot walk long distances. Part of the bullet remains 
in her back because it is too close to the spine to remove, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Perrellis remains in County Jail at Las Colinas without bail.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: CHULA VISTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police chased two 16-year-old boys in a stolen car Wednesday morning for more 
than half an hour through Chula Vista and National City, ending with their 
arrests in Paradise Hills, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The boys did not halt for a routine traffic stop by a Chula Vista police 
officer about 8:15 a.m. on Palomar Street, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The officer followed the pair onto northbound Interstate 5, where they exited 
on 24th Street and National City police took over the pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
"The chase in National City went on for 32 minutes, and I couldn't begin to 
tell you where they all went," said a National City police spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The car finally stopped at 9:20 a.m. at Morningside and Ablemarle streets in 
Paradise Hills. The boys got out and ran, but were caught by police. 
</P>
<P>
There were no injuries and no damage, police said. The two youths were being 
held on suspicion of auto theft, possession of stolen property and felony 
evading.

TEEN-AGER HELD OVER RASH OF FIRES, BUT 4 MORE ARE SET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Arson investigators arrested a teen-ager this week for setting at least six of 
the more than 25 rubbish and tree fires that have plagued the Reseda-Northridge 
area since last month. 
</P>
<P>
But while the youth was in custody Tuesday night, four similar fires were set 
in the area, authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Fire Department officials said that indicates the fires may be the 
work of several people, who may or may not know each other. 
</P>
<P>
"There are still a lot of unsolved fires," Inspector Ed Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation began Dec. 3 when 13 fires were set in neighborhoods near 
Reseda Boulevard north of Saticoy Street. The next night 12 more fires were 
reported in the same general area. 
</P>
<P>
The fires burned mostly trash and trees, though two cars and part of the roof 
of an apartment complex also were damaged, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 8, a $1.3-million fire damaged the Terry Lumber Co. complex in the 
area, but it was unclear if it was related to the smaller fires, Reed said. In 
any case, the rubbish fires continued sporadically through the Christmas 
holidays, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators arrested a 16-year-old Reseda boy on Tuesday morning after 
witnesses said he set one of the fires, Reed said. He initially became a 
suspect when fire inspectors learned that he lived in the area and had a prior 
history of vandalism and theft, Reed said. After his arrest, the boy admitted 
to having set six of the fires, Reed said. "But those are the only fires he 
set. He adamantly denies responsibility for any others." 
</P>
<P>
Reed said the boy definitely was not responsible for four fires set Tuesday 
night in the area of Reseda Boulevard south of Saticoy Street between 10 p.m. 
and midnight because he was in Sylmar Juvenile Hall at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Reed said investigators have no evidence indicating the fires are the work of a 
group of people acting in unison. "We don't know if it is a gang or a copycat 
situation involving several individuals," said Reed, who noted the boy who was 
arrested is not believed to be a gang member. 
</P>
<P>
In what may be an unrelated outbreak, Reed said, arson experts also are 
investigating a series of eight fires set in grass and rubbish piles and, in 
one instance, a parking garage in a North Hollywood neighborhood since Jan. 5. 
</P>
<P>
The fires -- including one per day on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday -- have 
occurred in the general area of Chandler Boulevard and Bellingham Avenue.

FERNANDEZ REACHES FINAL IN AUSTRALIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
MELBOURNE, Australia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Teen-ager Mary Joe Fernandez, the lone American left in the Australian Open, 
reached her first Grand Slam final Thursday with a 6-2, 6-1 victory over 
Claudia Porwik of West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez, displaying a style reminiscent of Chris Evert -- the last American 
to reach the Australian finals -- prowled the baseline and ripped passing shots 
by the net-charging Porwik. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez, tall and lanky with a braided pony tail and white sweat band around 
her forehead, raced through the match in just over an hour. 
</P>
<P>
She said knew Porwik was nervous and took advantage of it. 
</P>
<P>
"You could tell after the first couple of games, she was shaking her racket and 
hitting the ball up," Fernandez said. "I tried to keep on top of her the whole 
match." 
</P>
<P>
"I was a little bit nervous playing in a semifinal for the first time in my 
life," Porwik admitted. "But really I think I was just too tired. I was 
physically tired and mentally tired and made too many mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
Porwik made 49 unforced errors, 20 more than Fernandez. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez grew up near Evert in Florida and saw her as a role model. Like 
Evert, she fashioned her game with a two-fisted backhand and solid 
groundstrokes. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez, now 18 and a pro since 14, has grown into a strong, 5-foot-8 player 
with an increasingly effective net game -- better than Evert's at the same age. 
</P>
<P>
Though she came forward net against Porwik, Fernandez ended the match at the 
net with a cross-court backhand volley. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez reached the semifinals at the French Open last year and is No. 11 in 
the women's rankings, 52 spots ahead of Porwik. In their only previous meeting, 
Fernandez won in three sets on clay in Berlin last year. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez, who upset No. 3 Zina Garrison in the quarterfinals, will probably 
face two-time defending champion Steffi Graf in the title match.

Graf, who beat Evert in the finals two years ago, faces Helena Sukova in the 
other semifinals Thursday. Graf beat Sukova in the finals a year ago and has a 
14-1 record against her. The only time Sukova beat Graf was in 1983, when Graf 
was 13 and Sukova 17. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez certainly isn't worried about taking on Graf, who has a 46-match 
winning streak and owns eight Grand Slam titles. Graf also has won 20 
consecutive matches at the Australian Open. 
</P>
<P>
"When I go out there, I go out there to win," Fernandez said. "I've just got to 
go for it. She's obviously No. 1 right now and the best player in the world, 
but there's going to come a time when she's going to have to lose. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be difficult. She's been there so many times. She's won so many Slam 
titles. If I do play her, I'll have to take it to her. You have to forget about 
it and pretend you're playing somebody else. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not one to get hyper," she said. "Concentration has been one of the best 
parts of my game since I was a little kid." 
</P>
<P>
Porwik thought Fernandez would have only a slight chance against Graf. "Steffi 
has to wait for her chances in the match," Porwik said. "If Steffi waits for 
the right points to kill, she will have it easy in two sets. If she doesn't 
wait, she can make a few mistakes because Mary Joe hits very deep." 
</P>
<P>
A wild celebration by serene Swede Stefan Edberg -- he raised both fists and 
smiled -- punctuated a victory that could help him vault past Boris Becker in 
the chase for Ivan Lendl's No. 1 spot. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg, ranked No. 3, said he was "pumped" as he reached the men's semifinals 
on Wednesday along with Lendl, the top seed, while No. 2 Becker went bye-bye. 
</P>
<P>
That narrowed the gap between Edberg and Becker in the computer rankings and 
spoiled Becker's chances of catching Lendl at least until the French Open. 
</P>
<P>
If Edberg goes on to beat fellow Swede Mats Wilander, Becker's conqueror, in 
the semifinals and win the Australian for the third time, he could take over 
the No. 2 spot and move within striking distance of Lendl. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg may not have an easy time beating Wilander, who whipped precision 
passing shots through swirling winds against Becker to beat him 6-4, 6-4, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
That kept Wilander on track for a fourth Australian championship and ended 
Becker's bid for a third straight Grand Slam title to go with his Wimbledon and 
U.S. Open titles. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl will have an equally tough semifinal opponent in Yannick Noah, the 
diving, leaping Frenchman who beat him in a tuneup tourney two weeks ago in 
Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
Noah, who will play in his first Grand Slam semifinal since he won the 1983 
French Open, scored a 6-3, 7-5, 6-2 victory over Mikael Pernfors.

PACIFIC 10 CONFERENCE 
</P>
<P>
OREGON (9-7, 4-3) at No. 23 UCLA (12-3, 6-1), 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
TV -- None. Radio -- KMPC (710). 
</P>
<P>
Freshman Tracy Murray will make his first start at Pauley Pavilion after making 
nine of 10 shots and scoring 25 points Sunday against California at Berkeley in 
his debut as UCLA's No. 1 center. Murray is only the third Bruin freshman to 
score as many as 25 points in a game, joining teammate Don MacLean and former 
Bruin Rod Foster. "It gives opposing teams less of an opportunity to 
double-(team) down on MacLean and (Trevor) Wilson," Coach Jim Harrick said of 
his decision to move Murray into the starting lineup. "It opens some outside 
shots for (Gerald) Madkins and it opens the lane for penetration by (Darrick) 
Martin. So, it gives us a completely different look." Also sporting a new look 
is Oregon, which uses three starters who weren't even on the team last season. 
Guard Terrell Brandon, who sat out last season after failing to meet the 
academic guidelines established by Proposition 48, is averaging 17.3 points a 
game to lead the Ducks. The other newcomers in the starting lineup are 
6-foot-11 freshman Bob Fife and junior guard Kevin Mixon, a transfer from El 
Camino College. Oregon has already surpassed its victory total from last 
season, including a 68-63 win over Arizona, but the Ducks are 0-5 on the road. 
</P>
<P>
No. 17 OREGON STATE (14-2, 7-0) at USC (6-8, 1-6), 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
TV -- None. Radio -- KNX (1070). 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans will try to find a way to stop Gary Payton, the Beavers' 
All-American point guard, who is averaging 26.3 points, 8.9 assists and 4.8 
rebounds a game. "In the 15 years I've been in this conference, I don't know of 
any guard who's been able to do what Payton has done," USC Coach George 
Raveling said. "He's a winner and he makes those around him a winner. And he 
does so many things well. You may hold him to 10 points, but then he grabs 10 
rebounds, has 10 assists and gets 10 steals. He's the type of guy if you're 
playing on the playground, whoever picks him is going to win." Oregon State is 
off to its best start since 1984-85, when the Beavers won 15 of their first 16 
games. They have won nine consecutive games, their longest streak since they 
won 10 in a row in 1984-85. Raveling hasn't decided whether to start Robert 
Pack or Rodney Chatman at point guard. Pack started the Trojans' first 13 games 
before he was replaced by Chatman for Saturday's game at Stanford. Chatman had 
eight points, six assists and a rebound in a 74-61 loss to the Cardinal. USC 
center Chris Munk has made 27 consecutive free throws.

WEST COAST CONFERENCE 
</P>
<P>
No. 22 LOYOLA MARYMOUNT (13-3, 4-0) at PORTLAND (5-12, 2-2),

<P>

After beating Portland and Gonzaga last weekend by an average of 34.5 points, 
the Lions take a six-game win streak into the Northwest to play those teams on 
their courts. Loyola has passed Oklahoma in the national scoring race and has 
raised its average to 120.2 points. Bo Kimble continues to lead the nation in 
scoring, averaging 35.5. Loyola beat Portland, 131-106, last Saturday, moving 
Coach Paul Westhead into second place in victories by a Loyola coach with a 
92-45 record in four-plus seasons. Bill Donovan won 107 games in 1953-1961. 
Portland forward William McDowell scored 30 points against Pepperdine and 29 
against Loyola last week to raise his average to 13.3. Guard Josh Lowery leads 
the Pilots in scoring, averaging 14.6. His brother, Terrell, is averaging 14.5 
for Loyola. Portland last beat Loyola in February 1987. 
</P>
<P>
PEPPERDINE (8-9, 2-2) at GONZAGA (5-11, 1-3), 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
TV -- None. Radio -- KWNK (670). 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine trailed Gonzaga, 56-41, with 8:34 remaining last Saturday in Malibu, 
but came back to beat the Bulldogs, 68-67. Doug Christie scored a team-high 19 
points for Pepperdine, 13 in the second half. Tom Lewis returns to the Waves 
after a three-game suspension for missing curfew after a road game. Lewis 
apparently will come in off the bench, but Pepperdine Coach Tom Asbury said he 
plans to give the senior forward "a fair chance to earn his starting job back. 
Tom can really give this team a lift if he is playing up to his abilities at 
both ends of the floor." Gonzaga's Jim McPhee, who scored a career-high 42 
points in last week's 144-100 loss at Loyola Marymount, is averaging 22.8 
points a game.

<P>
BIG WEST CONFERENCE 
</P>
<P>
CS LONG BEACH (11-5, 4-4) at UTAH ST. (11-7, 5-2), 6:30 PST. 
</P>
<P>
TV -- None. Radio -- KORG (1190). 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Long Beach has lost three of its last four games, mainly because of 
erratic shooting. The 49ers shot only 37% Monday night in losing to Nevada Las 
Vegas, 86-77, and have been below 40% in three of their last five games. 
Forward Kenny Jarvis, who broke into the starting lineup five games ago, led 
the 49ers with 18 points against the Rebels. Freshman guard Lucious Harris 
continues to lead the team in scoring, averaging 12.6. Utah State has won eight 
of its last 10 games and has defeated the 49ers two years in a row at Logan. 
The Aggies have four players with double-figure scoring averages -- Kendall 
Youngblood (14.3), Randy Funk (12.7), Rich Jardine (12.3) and Darrel White 
(10.2). 
</P>
<P>
UC IRVINE (2-15, 0-8) at CS FULLERTON (9-7, 3-4), 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
TV -- SportsChannel. Radio -- KMNY (1600), KORG (1190). 
</P>
<P>
With another loss, Irvine will tie the longest losing streak in school history 
-- 11 games. That streak was set under Tim Tift in January and February of 
1980, the season before Bill Mulligan became coach. The closest the Anteaters 
have come to victory since Dec. 16 is a one-point loss to Cal State Long Beach 
on Jan. 11. Mulligan has had only one losing season at the school, last year's 
12-17 mark. But a losing record is already assured this season with 11 games 
remaining. Center Ricky Butler, who scored in double figures in 11 consecutive 
games, scored only two in a loss to UC Santa Barbara last Saturday. Butler did 
not start because he was late for a team meeting. Reserve Elgin Rogers, who 
scored 24 points in the last two games, is doubtful with a sprained ankle 
suffered in practice on Monday. Fullerton, undefeated in six home games but 
only 3-7 on the road, plays seven of its final 11 games in Titan Gym. Leading 
scorer Cedric Ceballos has made 40 of 69 shots (58%) in his last four games, 
and is averaging 22.1 points and 11.8 rebounds. Mark Hill is averaging 20.8.

No. 16 Louisiana State missed the front end of 10 consecutive one-and-one 
free-throw opportunities, and Georgia made the free throws it needed to beat 
the Tigers, 94-92, in overtime Wednesday in a Southeastern Conference game at 
Baton Rouge, La. 
</P>
<P>
Although LSU's Chris Jackson scored 45 points, he couldn't offset the Tigers' 
(12-4, 4-3 in conference play) poor free-throw shooting in the last seven 
minutes of regulation and first three minutes of overtime. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew that free-throw shooting was our Achilles' heel," LSU Coach Dale Brown 
said. "And last year, we were the best free-throw shooting team in the league 
and No. 4 in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe they should get their tails out there a little early and practice 
shooting free throws." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson missed a 48-foot shot at the end of regulation and two three-point 
attempts with 20 seconds left in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia (11-5, 4-3) sent the game into overtime tied at 79-79 when Rod Cole 
made three free throws with four seconds left. Cole was fouled on a three-point 
attempt that missed and, under Southeastern Conference rules, was awarded three 
free throws. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulldogs got 27 points from Alec Kessler. 
</P>
<P>
No. 8 Duke 85, North Carolina State 82 -- Phil Henderson scored 25 points and 
the victorious Blue Devils made their first three shots in overtime in an 
Atlantic Coast Conference game at Durham, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
Christian Laettner of Duke (15-3, 5-1), scored on a tip-in with 17 seconds left 
in regulation to tie it, 74-74. N.C. State (13-5, 2-3), which rallied from an 
11-point deficit in the second half, never led in overtime. The Wolfpack was 
led by Rodney Monroe, who hit only six of 26 attempts but scored 19 points. 
</P>
<P>
No. 9 Oklahoma 107, Iowa State 96 -- Damon Patterson and Skeeter Henry sparked 
a late 10-3 run at Norman, Okla., that helped the Sooners (13-2, 2-1) win a Big 
Eight Conference game over the Cyclones (6-9, 1-2). 
</P>
<P>
Michigan State 75, No. 12 Indiana 57 -- Kirk Manns scored 25 points and the 
Spartans became the winningest visiting team at Assembly Hall in Bloomington, 
Ind. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan State won for the sixth time at Assembly Hall, where Indiana is 229-31 
overall and 134-25 in Big Ten play. 
</P>
<P>
The Spartans (15-3, 4-1) used a 29-11 spurt in the first half to take a 35-27 
lead at halftime. Indiana is 13-3, 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
No. 15 St. John's 83, Providence 75 -- Boo Harvey hit 10 of 12 free throws in 
the final five minutes to help the Redmen hold off the Friars in the Big East 
at Providence, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
St. John's (17-3, 6-1) broke a first-place tie with Georgetown in the 
conference. Providence is 11-5, 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
No. 20 Connecticut 99, Central Connecticut 77 -- The Huskies' Chris Smith 
scored 19 points, including five three-point shots, at Storrs, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
Connecticut is 16-3; Central Connecticut is 3-13. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame 88, Wichita State 78 -- LaPhonso Ellis' 15 points led six Irish 
players in double figures at South Bend, Ind. Notre Dame is 9-6; Wichita State 
is 5-12. 
</P>
<P>
Auburn 74, Kentucky 70 -- Derrick Dennison scored 27 points, including two on 
free throws after a steal with 13 seconds remaining, as the Tigers rallied from 
a 14-point halftime deficit for a Southeastern Conference victory at Auburn, 
Ala. 
</P>
<P>
Auburn (6-11, 3-4) tied the score, 70-70, on two free throws by Chris Brandt 
with 26 seconds to play. Kentucky (8-9, 4-4) set up for a potential 
game-winning shot, but Dennison stole a pass, was fouled and made both shots. 
</P>
<P>
Vanderbilt 71, Florida 64 -- Morgan Wheat's three-point basket with 2:42 left 
broke open a tight contest as the Commodores (11-5, 4-3) won a Southeastern 
Conference game at Gainesville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
The Gators (6-8, 2-5), playing without suspended 7-foot-2 center Dwayne 
Schintzius, lost their third consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
Schintzius got the haircut that Coach Don DeVoe had demanded as a condition of 
his return to the team, but DeVoe has not announced whether Schintzius has been 
reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 64, Southern Methodist 47 -- Houston's Byron Smith scored 19 points and 
Carl Herrera had 19 rebounds and blocked six shots as the Cougars (13-6, 4-3) 
won a Southwest Conference game over the Mustangs (6-9, 1-5). 
</P>
<P>
Virginia 77, Virginia Tech 59 -- Cavalier forward Bryant Stith scored 22 
points, including 10 in a row early in the second half, to lead the Cavaliers 
(11-5) over the Hokies (9-9) at Roanoke, Va.

Qintex Entertainment Inc.: The Beverly Hills firm posted a net loss of $33.2 
million for the year ended July 31, 1989. Revenue totaled $86 million. The 
firm, which filed for bankruptcy protection last Oct. 19, said prior-year 
figures are not comparable because the company was formed in 1988 by the merger 
of Hal Roach Studios Inc. and Robert Halmi Inc.

USAir Group: The air carrier holding company reported a net loss of $63 million 
for 1989, contrasted with profit of $165 million in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue totaled $6.3 billion, up 11%. For the fourth quarter, the firm posted a 
net loss of $102 million, contrasted with a profit of $23 million for the 1988 
period. The Arlington, Va., firm attributed the results to higher fuel costs, 
to recurring and one-time cost increases relating to its merger with Pacific 
Southwest Airlines and Piedmont Airlines and to Hurricane Hugo and the Bay Area 
Quake, which caused major disruptions of service.

CHULA VISTA PUSHING FOR CAR DEALER PARK; 
</P>
<P>
REVENUE: OFFICIALS SAY A 40-ACRE COMPLEX WOULD NET THE CITY MILLIONS IN SALES 
TAX, BUT SOME RESIDENTS AREN'T HAPPY WITH THE IDEA. 
</P>

<P>
Ever since a Chula Vista task force discovered that the majority of its 
residents go outside the city's borders to purchase new cars, city officials 
have been pondering ways to woo car dealerships -- and the sales tax revenue 
they generate. 
</P>
<P>
A proposal for a 40-acre auto-dealership park to be built a mile and a half 
east of Interstate 805 off East H Street in the heart of the Rancho del Rey 
business center now under construction appears to be the answer to their 
prayers. But not everyone in Chula Vista is enthusiastic about the project. 
</P>
<P>
Retired civil servant Vernon Smith, 57, who has lived on nearby Paseo del Rey 
since 1980, is afraid the proposed auto center will increase traffic and 
depress property values in the new, well-to-do neighborhood where houses sell 
in the $200,000 to $300,000 range. 
</P>
<P>
"This has basically been residential all through here, and I kind of like it 
that way," Smith said. "I haven't been involved much in community affairs, but 
I very well may become involved." 
</P>
<P>
Smith and others will have an opportunity to express their concerns at a City 
Council planning committee hearing scheduled for early March. That's when the 
committee will review a zoning change request by the developer, a partnership 
of McMillin Communities and HomeFed Bank's real estate development unit, and a 
consortium of auto dealers who have agreed to buy 20 acres of the proposed 
40-acre auto park. 
</P>
<P>
McMillin Communities, which plans to sell the remaining 20 acres to other car 
dealers, said the development could eventually embrace 11 dealerships. 
</P>
<P>
The consortium consists of Fuller Ford and South Bay Chevrolet, now Chula 
Vista's only resident auto dealers. Although they have not yet settled on a 
price for the 20-acre site they have agreed to buy, property in the business 
center is selling for $8 to $20 a square foot. Based on those prices, the two 
dealers can expect to spend $7 to $17.6 million for the 20-acre site. 
</P>
<P>
Chula Vista Mayor Greg Cox said the auto park would be "tremendously 
beneficial" to the city. The auto center, whose opening is planned for 
mid-1991, "could generate as much or more sales tax as a regional shopping 
center or a Price Club," Cox said. "This is an opportunity to get a number of 
new dealerships to our community, which could provide not only new revenue but 
also jobs." 
</P>
<P>
City officials estimate that the auto park would create 1,200 jobs and could 
generate an additional $2 million in annual city sales taxes, a 20% boost over 
last year's sales tax revenue of $10.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
And residents should be comforted to learn, Cox said, that the city will 
require that the auto park be "aesthetically pleasing, with well-designed 
buildings and a heavy commitment to landscaping without all the glitz, bright 
lights and noises" often associated with auto centers. 
</P>
<P>
The auto park, the single largest component in the 84-acre Rancho del Rey 
business center, will emulate "a campus-like environment with monument-type 
signs as opposed to pole signs," Cox added. 
</P>
<P>
But former Chula Vista Mayor Frank Scott, who is the founder of Crossroads, a 
6-year-old citizen's lobbying and planning group, said, "We don't think (the 
proposed site) is an appropriate place for (an auto park). If we had our 
druthers, we'd like to put it along the freeway on Main Street." 
</P>
<P>
But Scott said his group thus far has opted not to lobby against the 
development because Crossroads is active in other "more important" Chula Vista 
planning issues, such as the Bayfront and EastLake developments. "You can't 
take a stand on everything," Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Fuller, owner of Fuller Ford, said that, although he is aware of the 
residents' concerns, he thinks they may not fully understand the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"I know there is concern we are going to end up with another Mile of Cars," 
Fuller said, referring to a decades-old strip of auto dealerships in National 
City. "My feeling is, if we were doing anything that even remotely approximates 
that . . . I wouldn't want to be involved. Our intention is to be an attractive 
addition to the Rancho del Rey community. We would have a modern, high-tech 
architectural style, something clean and attractive." 
</P>
<P>
And, he added, there will be no banners, flags or balloons. 
</P>
<P>
But dollars, not aesthetics, are the driving force behind the car park 
proposal. City officials point to the fact that in Carlsbad about $2.5 million, 
or more than a quarter of the city's $8.2 million in sales tax revenue was 
generated by the Car Country Carlsbad auto park last year. 
</P>
<P>
And, in National City, the Mile of Cars auto strip and surrounding auto supply 
stores generated some $3.2 million of the city's total $8.8 million in sales 
tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
"Additional revenues like that over the long run are extremely important to 
allow the city to provide the services that we are currently providing and to 
improve those services," Cox said. "Police would certainly get the lion's share 
of improved services, but other departments would also be beneficiaries of 
additional revenues coming." 
</P>
<P>
Sales tax revenues have become the most important new source of revenue for 
city governments throughout California since property taxes were rolled back by 
Proposition 13 in the late 1970s. Auto dealerships are among the largest 
sources of sales tax revenue a city can have. 
</P>
<P>
Chula Vista city officials began seeking proposals for an auto mall after 
discovering two years ago that 83% of the city's residents leave the city to 
buy new cars. "It was obviously a real drain of potential revenue to the city," 
said Chula Vista Redevelopment director Dave Gustafsen. 
</P>
<P>
Fuller Ford and South Bay Chevrolet, both of which are now situated about 3 
miles from their nearest competitors, can expect to double their revenue by 
relocating to the proposed auto park, said Fuller. His dealership recorded $22 
million in sales revenue last year.

THE SOUL OF 'WRITERS ROW' SHINES THROUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was struck by the juxtaposition of two articles on the front page of the Jan. 
10 View section: "Writers Row" about homeless artists and their struggle to 
keep the muse alive despite the agonies of poverty, and "Passions Grounded in 
Shoes" about women who collect large numbers of ultra-expensive designer shoes. 
</P>
<P>
I would not suggest that these women refrain from indulging in their passion. 
But, perhaps, in a spirit of social responsibility, they could find it in their 
hearts to donate the boxes the shoes come in to the less fortunate who may find 
them useful for repairing holes in the ceilings of their cardboard apartments.

I really liked your article about homeless writers on Skid Row. 
</P>
<P>
I'm 14, and usually I only look at the paper long enough to read Dear Abby, the 
comics and the horoscopes. But the article caught my eye. I think it showed 
that not all homeless people have given up on themselves, and lots of people 
out there, such as Dino and Jackie, who are trying to improve life not only for 
themselves, but for others as well. It made me grateful for everything I've 
got.

UNPADDING THE NESTS OF 'PACK RATS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was interested in your story "Pack Rats Unite" (Jan. 18) and pleased to see 
that this is being recognized as a serious problem. 
</P>
<P>
For the past eight years I have worked in a rehabilitation unit as a physical 
therapist. 
</P>
<P>
Most of our patients are older people who have suffered from strokes. Medicare 
and other insurance companies encourage us to visit the patient's house with 
the patient prior to discharge to make sure the patient is safe in his/her own 
environment. This is time and money well spent, since too many of these people 
return within a few years with broken hips or other accidents. 
</P>
<P>
The most astounding aspect of these visits is the high percentage of pack rats 
I find. My patients usually go home using walkers or large canes and many have 
very poor balance. Many of these houses are filled with boxes of newspapers on 
the floor and enough furniture to fill a 3,500-square-foot house compacted into 
1,000 square feet. It is impossible to use a walker without side stepping 
through the spaces. 
</P>
<P>
I would like to see these organized groups catch on. If the problem is 
recognized when people are in middle age, perhaps it can be brought under 
control before they are too old and sick to help themselves.

YOUR WHEELS: BATTERY DIES AFTER THE TWILIGHT HOURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: My 1980 Dodge runs well but has a strange electrical problem that 
causes it to die out suddenly at night. The battery is dead when this happens. 
What could be the cause? -- Y.N. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: If the battery is running down only at night, you have either a fairly 
simple problem or a rather difficult one. It could be as simple as a loose fan 
belt that is unable to operate the alternator at peak electrical demand when 
the headlights are on. 
</P>
<P>
The headlights are the largest single electrically powered device on the car, 
and when they are on, the alternator must work hard to supply an adequate 
current. The voltage regulator detects the electrical load being demanded by 
the various systems on the car and controls the generation of current. It also 
makes sure that the battery is fully charged. 
</P>
<P>
The alternator is powered by a fan belt that runs between a pulley on the 
engine and a pulley in front of the alternator housing. When the alternator 
needs to produce more current, the pulleys become more difficult to drive. If 
the belt slips because it isn't tight enough, then the alternator will not be 
able to generate all the current needed for the headlights and other systems on 
the car. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the battery begins to drain itself until it is so low that the 
engine simply dies. If the belt is loose, the solution is usually to tighten or 
replace the belt. 
</P>
<P>
The more complex possible problem may involve a short in the headlight circuit 
that causes the electrical system to drain but not blow a fuse. That could 
occur almost anywhere in the headlight circuit. A mechanic should be able to 
determine just what the problem is. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I recently filled up my 1972 Ford Mustang with Arco EC-1 fuel. The company 
says the gasoline is designed for older cars. Does that mean it contains a lead 
substitute? -- M.K. 
</P>
<P>
A: You might think because the new Arco EC-1 fuel is intended for use in older 
cars, which were designed to burn leaded fuel, that the fuel contains a lead 
substitute. 
</P>
<P>
The gasoline contains neither lead nor a lead substitute, but the company 
insists that it is safe to use in engines that were designed to burn lead. The 
main difference between EC-1 and plain unleaded regular is that it carries the 
somewhat higher octane rating required by older cars. 
</P>
<P>
Lead was used in the past primarily to boost the octane of gasoline and also to 
perform the function of cushioning engine valves and their valve seats. Under 
heavy usage, such as speeds in excess of 55 m.p.h. or when towing a trailer, 
old engine valves need lead or a lead substitute to cushion the surface between 
valve and valve seat. 
</P>
<P>
But in the past two decades, scientists have discovered that lead was poisoning 
the environment and perhaps causing learning disabilities in children. Under 
federal law, it is being phased out. 
</P>
<P>
Starting in 1974, automobile manufacturers hardened the valves and seats in 
engines so that they did not require lead. Some cars had hardened valves and 
seats starting in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
In cars produced earlier, heavy usage can cause premature valve failure. Under 
heavy usage, motorists can use lead substitutes, which are based on sodium or 
phosphorus compounds and are readily available in auto parts stores. Generally, 
old marine engines, which are typically run under heavy loads, require a lead 
substitute most of the time.

Mrs. Albert Smith of Redlands, who wanted a chrome blouse tree, may feel like 
climbing one. We had only one reply, from a Los Angeles reader who has such a 
tree; the information has been forwarded to Redlands. 
</P>
<P>
However, for Mrs. Jack Shultz of Whittier, who wanted a cast-iron lamb mold for 
cakes, we have a possible substitute, and it's fairly sheep too. Susan Palacios 
of the Graber Olive House Kitchen Shop, 315 E. 4th St., Ontario, (714) 
983-1761, says they stock a heavy-aluminum (not cast-iron) two-piece lamb mold 
for $11.95; it's 10 inches long and 7 inches tall. Perhaps this will staunch 
the bleating in the Shultz household. 
</P>
<P>
For Hazel Fearing of San Clemente, who wanted cotton ribbons for an old 
Underwood portable typewriter, we have some key answers. Marco Thone of San 
Diego, who also uses old typewriters, suggests a nylon ribbon from Sears at 
$2.49 and 20-pound bond paper as a second sheet; he also says to keep the 
typewriter covered when it's not in use, to minimize ribbon dryness. Wayola 
Larson of Altadena reminds us that, amazingly enough, erasable-bond paper is a 
great absorber of ink and that the poorest-quality paper (newsprint) reproduces 
the best letters. 
</P>
<P>
An unidentified reader says to see whether film ribbon spools are available; 
film ribbon is only for single use but it gives a good black image. And a 
letter from Joan Howard of Los Angeles, who has some old, unused Underwood 
ribbons, has been forwarded to Fearing.

YOUR COINS: RARITY, QUALITY ARE CRUCIAL FACTORS IN PAPER 
</P>

Question: My wife and I have been collecting $2 notes (saddlebag notes) because 
of their large size, circa 1880 to 1917. We've tried to buy them in very fine 
or better condition. We've been paying approximately $100 each. Is this a good 
investment in paper money, or should we look for something else to invest in? 
-- E.E. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: You've chosen a very interesting area of numismatics. Many people 
collect paper bills for their intricate engravings and historical significance. 
By narrowing it down to $2 bills, you've become a specialist in one area of the 
paper money field, which, like the coin field, is almost limitless. Also, as 
with coins, condition and rarity are major factors in determining the value of 
a particular bill. 
</P>
<P>
There is nothing wrong in collecting bills the way you have -- except, perhaps, 
as an investment. If your bills are to serve as an investment, then it's 
necessary to apply the same principles that you would to other numismatic 
items: Buy rarity and quality. Bills graded "very fine or better" probably do 
not qualify. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, the paper market is going up in rare and quality material in all 
denominations from 1867 to 1900. Bills graded crisp uncirculated to gem 
uncirculated are particularly desirable. Notes graded very fine to extra fine 
are not good investments unless they are rare. 
</P>
<P>
You may be paying a bit of a premium for your bills, which is OK if they're 
pleasing and have good eye appeal. If you're satisfied collecting at this 
level, then, as they say, enjoy. But if you'd rather go for more 
investment-quality pieces, you may be able to trade up and have more to show 
for it financially in the long run. 
</P>

There are several good basic paper money reference books. These include Paper 
Money of the United States by Robert Friedberg, the Standard Catalogue of 
United States Paper Money by Krause and Lemke, and the handy little Official

DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: SPORTS CAN SLIM OVERWEIGHT KIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JOYCE BROTHERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: I'm overweight and both of my children (ages 9 and 13) are 
also a bit on the plump side. They don't seem to mind and their grandparents 
tell me to ignore it -- that they'll outgrow it. Because no one seems to 
object, it's almost impossible to get them to lose weight. How important is it 
to put them on a diet? -- W.O. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR W.O.: If either child is 20% over what is considered ideal weight for 
height, sex and age, then I believe it's important to put them on some kind of 
exercise-diet health regime that will improve their health. Despite the fact 
that they say they don't mind being heavy, I find that hard to believe. They 
may be denying the truth of the matter. Children are not known for kindness and 
sensitivity when it comes to making fun of fat classmates. If your youngsters 
haven't been the butt of jokes, they will be if they continue to put on pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Also, obese children are more likely to become fat adults and if you and your 
family don't help your youngsters to slim down now, they may curse you for it 
later. If they're only moderately overweight, it may simply be a matter of 
placing less emphasis on candy and desserts and more on exercise. Remember that 
sitting in front of a TV set isn't exercise. Fat increases by 2% for each hour 
of TV viewed daily. 
</P>
<P>
If your kids aren't sports enthusiasts, make it a family project. Get out and 
play with them and initiate family hikes on weekends. It will help you, too. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: It seems to me that drivers are much more aggressive than 
they used to be. My grandson assures me that this isn't true, but I remain 
unconvinced. One reason I discussed this with him is because he and his friends 
are prime offenders in this department. They think nothing of jumping in their 
car when they're angry. -- J.R. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR J.R.: This is unfortunate because studies show that anger or any strong 
emotion can be a cause of serious accidents if the person who is out of control 
happens to be driving. People who take out their aggression with their 
automobiles are hazardous to themselves and everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
Driving teachers point out that one way to minimize aggression on the highway 
is to leave plenty of time for traffic. A mismatch between goals and reality -- 
what you want and what you get -- often triggers rage. It's difficult for young 
drivers to plan ahead, but if they are supposed to be somewhere and have to 
drive through town at rush hour, they'd do well to anticipate road tie-ups. 
</P>
<P>
Another difficulty, especially with male drivers, is that they frequently see 
the car as an extension of themselves, so that they are apt to interpret a 
minor dent as a major attack on their personal dignity.

Andy Rooney Sparks Gay Protest: Andy Rooney was accused Tuesday of homophobia 
by a major gay organization after they said he suggested that homosexual 
relationships caused AIDS. Rooney, whose "A Few Minutes With Andy Rooney," 
often serves as a tag to "60 Minutes," has said that he "feels innocent of any 
negative behavior toward homosexuals," and that he counts gays among some of 
his friends. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the objections raised by the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against 
Defamation (GLAAD) stemmed from Rooney's year-end television special which 
aired on CBS Dec. 28. Rooney said: "There should be some recognition that in 
1989 many of the ills that killed us are self-induced. Too much alcohol, too 
many drugs, homosexual unions and cigarettes quite often led to premature 
deaths." Rooney said he has gotten hundreds of letters about his comments and 
had sent a response to the gay magazine The Advocate in which he apologized and 
promised: "I'll be more careful." GLAAD spokesman Craig Davidson said GLAAD 
wanted Rooney to apologize on the air for his remarks. CBS said it was 
reviewing the situation. BETH KLEID

Portrait of Van Gogh's Doctor to Be Auctioned: Vincent van Gogh's portrait of 
Dr. Paul-Ferdinand Gachet, who treated the troubled artist during the last year 
of his life, will be sold at Christie's New York on May 15. The painting is 
expected to bring between $40 million and $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
That estimate places the expressionistic portrait between two other high-priced 
Van Goghs -- "Irises," which sold for $53.9 million on Nov. 11, 1987, setting a 
world record for an artwork, and "Sunflowers," which brought $39.9 million on 
March 31, 1987. The portrait of Dr. Gachet belongs to a trust established by 
Siegfried Kramarsky, a New York banker and philanthropist who died in 1961. The 
painting has been on loan to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York since 
1984 and has been in major exhibitions there. Van Gogh painted two versions of 
the doctor's portrait. The other one hangs in the Musee d'Orsay in Paris. BETH

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO : BASIE BAND ALUMNI TO PLAY AT FIRST 
'SALUTE TO MASTERS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Count Basie fronted some of the greatest big-band lineups of all time, 
including several jazz men who left their mark on the music. Alto saxophonist 
and Basie alum Marshal Royal was one such key player. Royal, who joins fellow 
Basie band graduate Joseph Wilder on Saturday night for the first of the San 
Diego Jazz Society's "Salute to the Masters" series, is well aware of his 
contribution to Basie's band. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what he learned from the association, Royal replied: 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have to learn anything. I put his new band together in 1951. He 
learned from me. After I left the band, it never sounded the same." 
</P>
<P>
Royal isn't shy about what it was lacking. 
</P>
<P>
"Me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The intent of the jazz society's series is to keep jazz history alive. Royal, 
too, believes this is important. He's always believed in the traditional forms 
of improvisation: solos with a melody even casual listeners can follow. 
</P>
<P>
"Common melodies, simple melodies are sometimes more important than 
structures," he said. Yet he keeps his mind open about music. "I don't dislike 
any music. There are really only two kinds: good and bad." 
</P>
<P>
Royal and trumpeter Wilder actually played together for the first time in 1940 
in Lionel Hampton's band. This Saturday's concert is a tribute to Duke 
Ellington and Ellington band member and composer Billy Strayhorn. 
</P>
<P>
Royal, who has worked with Ellington, Frank Sinatra, Sarah Vaughn, Art Tatum, 
Lena Horne, Tony Bennett, Ray Charles, Benny Carter, Quincy Jones, Joe Williams 
and Linda Ronstadt, prefers a big-band setting. 
</P>
<P>
"With a big band, you have good backgrounds for solos. It showcases you 
better." 
</P>
<P>
Wilder's background is more varied, including extensive radio and television 
work, classical orchestra and Broadway musicals -- last year, he finished an 8 
1/2-year run with "42nd St." 
</P>
<P>
Royal and Wilder will be backed by Mike Wofford on piano, Bob Magnusson on bass 
and Roy McCurdy on drums. 
</P>
<P>
After this kickoff concert at 8 p.m. at the Lyceum Stage theater in Horton 
Plaza, the jazz society will present a tribute to Charlie Parker from 
saxophonist Nick Brignola on March 10 at the new downtown convention center and 
an April 1 tribute to Basie at the Don Powell Theatre on the San Diego State 
University campus. 
</P>
<P>
The shows are being funded with $12,800 in city arts money the society was 
awarded for 1990. This spring, the society plans to present a series of outdoor 
community concerts at various San Diego County locations. 
</P>
<P>
KIFM (98.1) is making changes that could perk up its Sunday night "Mainly 
Mainstream" program, which runs from 10 until midnight. It's been renamed 
"Straight Ahead." Starting this Sunday, host Paul Lavoie is out, replaced by 
local jazz expert Jim Merod and Steve Satkowski, who will also serve as 
executive producer. Satkowski books the talent for Elario's, which is 
underwriting the program. It's a great promotion for Elario's. Each show will 
spotlight the club's headliner through several short interview segments and 
digital audio tape of their performances at the club. The show will also 
include reviews of jazz CDs, 98-second jazz history capsules and a segment 
called "Straight From the Hip," featuring jazz news and trends.

<P>
Tobacco Road has a new self-produced album, available from the group at their 
various gigs, or at Uptown Records in Hillcrest. 
</P>
<P>
Among the cassette's 14 songs, the one getting airplay on KSDS-FM, B100's 
"Morning Zoo" and KFMB-Am's Hudson and Bauer show is "We Got Fish for Supper," 
sung by Preston Coleman, the band's 72-year-old bass player. Coleman has played 
with pianist Mary Lou Williams and drummer Art Blakey in a trio, and with 
singer Joe Williams and trumpeter Walter Fuller. 
</P>
<P>
During the coming weeks, you can hear Tobacco Road during Wednesday happy hours 
at the Belly Up Tavern in Solana Beach and Thursday nights at the new Kansas 
City Steakhouse in the Gaslamp Quarter in downtown San Diego.

'DAVE THOMAS' ON CBS IS SHORT ON LAUGHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If any member of the "SCTV" cast was best equipped to host a weekly 
comedy/variety series, underseen Dave Thomas might be the man; in addition to 
his talents as an impressionist and skit player, Thomas seems perhaps the most 
average, all-American Joe from among that legendary crew, John Candy's friendly 
girth notwithstanding. 
</P>
<P>
It's disappointing to report then that "The Dave Thomas Comedy Show" (tonight 
at 9:30 on Channels 2 and 8), the first of five half-hour episodes to be 
irregularly slotted into the CBS schedule, is at best mildly diverting. At 
worst, it's so, well, square that its sets, transitions, overbearing laugh 
track and even some of the gags seem right out of an "SCTV" parody. 
</P>
<P>
It's difficult to judge a series' potential from only half a dozen skits. But 
when even Thomas' best standby from his "SCTV" days doesn't result in laughs, 
there's trouble brewing. His impersonation of Bob Hope having a chat with 
Ronald Reagan (played by John Rourke of "Fridays") is the least funny thing on 
the show; it's expert mimicry but it's hardly satire. And the Reagan-directed 
punch line is the same joke every comedian has used since the inauguration: 
Seems he thought the presidency was just another movie shoot, ha ha! 
</P>
<P>
Guest-starring are Chevy Chase and Martin Short, who join their host in 
nervously boarding a plane as "the Frightened Brothers." It's the most amusing 
sketch of the lot, but the chuckles come less from the dialogue or their 
comedic skills, alas, than from the special wigs that allow their considerable 
cowlicks to stand up on end each time they're given a start. 
</P>
<P>
A rap parody in which Thomas as a harried father rhythmically lays down the law 
for his startled kids shows some spunk. But the comedy gets exceedingly dumb 
with a bit in which Dave imagines himself on a life raft with six beautiful 
gals, and with a vision of Superman as a middle-aged moving man, which ends the 
show with a low-reaching punch line about X-ray vision and underwear that's 
virtually lifted from the "Superman" movie itself. CHRIS WILLMAN

BROOKLYN RAPPERS 3RD BASS THROWN OUT BY LL COOL J 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the Black Rock Coalition going strong and a hip-hop show the most popular 
program on MTV, 3rd Bass, a new Brooklyn rap group with an album in the Top 10 
of Billboard's black music chart, uses its whiteness the same way Heavy D uses 
his girth: as a cute gimmick. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you see any white boys on stage?" they asked at a Palace showcase on 
Tuesday sponsored by hip-hop radio station KDAY. 
</P>
<P>
Well, yes, one who shuffles like Grant Schumaker on "The Garry Shandling Show," 
another who gesticulates with a cane like Art Carney in "Harry and Tonto." 3rd 
Bass thanked "all the brothers and sisters . . . who can see the soul under the 
skin." 
</P>
<P>
They made hideously offensive AIDS cracks, just like Ice-T. They tentatively 
bellowed their hits into a microphone like rappers on their first tour, which 
they are. And -- big mistake -- they brought out LL Cool J for their last 
couple of numbers -- the effect of which was kind of like Michael Jordan 
stepping into a schoolyard basketball game or Anita Baker sitting in at a piano 
bar. With his clear tenor, polysyllables and astounding machine-gun 
articulation, LL cut through the murky, bottom-heavy mix. "I juice the party 
like jumper cables," he rapped, and he did: The crowd, galvanized, seemed to 
wake up for the first time that night. (De La Soul and Eazy-E also appeared on 
stage.) LL has never been this good; 3rd Bass was all but forgotten. JONATHAN

series this weekend in Melnitz Theater are extraordinary. They compose an 
exceedingly bleak and pessimistic portrait of life in Hungary over the past 40 
years but are redeemed by an impassioned honesty and courage and absolutely 
splendid acting.

Ference Teglasy's impressive feature debut film, "Never, Nowhere, to No One!" 
(Saturday at 5:30 p.m.), begins in Budapest, 1951, and focuses on one of the 
countless families which were evacuated at that time to the countryside on the 
vague charges of being "politically unreliable." Settling in an abandoned 
schoolhouse, the family commences their bitter struggle for survival and 
acceptance by the area's farmers. For the father (Andras Kozak) the great 
concern is that he find the courage to maintain his integrity as an example for 
his children. Theirs is an incredibly hard and unjust existence, relieved only 
by the random act of kindness and by the knowledge that so far they have 
escaped an even worse fate, which are the labor camps. 
</P>
<P>
"Never, Nowhere, to No One!" (1988) is followed at 7:30 by Zsolt Kezdi-Kovacs' 
"Cry and Cry Again" (1987), which is the most relentlessly dark of the five 
films. It is a love story, set in 1958, between a 40ish worker (Jerzy Trela) in 
a highly symbolic slaughterhouse and a beautiful young woman (Maria Varga) who 
works in the slaughterhouse's personnel department. That their relationship is 
doomed from the start is so palpable you can all but taste the fear and 
paranoia enveloping it; both their spouses had managed to flee the country 
after the failure of the 1956 revolution. Unfortunately, the woman is in the 
cruel thrall of very man, now a government official, who stopped her at the 
border. 
</P>
<P>
You might well consider skipping "Cry and Cry Again" for a dinner break and 
return at 9 for "Love, Mother," (1986), the longest (2 hours, 45 minutes) but 
most accessible of the films. Written by Miklos Vamos and directed by Janos 
Rozsa, "Love, Mother" has such immediacy and universality that it could just as 
easily be set in suburban Los Angeles as suburban Budapest without changing a 
single detail. 
</P>
<P>
It is a superbly orchestrated satire on the frantic, self-absorbed nature of 
contemporary life. The Kalmars are reeling out of control without realizing it. 
What little communication they have between each other is by leaving messages 
on a kitchen bulletin board. The father (Robert Koltai), an enterprising 
contractor, is so busy he can't even work infidelity into his schedule 
satisfactorily, and the mother (Dorottya Udvaros) is a tour guide whose work 
takes her away from home for several days at a time. No one realizes that the 
bright adolescent son (Simon G. Gevai) has played hooky for the last three 
weeks. The one person concerned with what is happening to the family is the 
daughter (Kati Lajtai), a high school student, whose despair comes to a head 
when she finds it impossible to get through to her parents that her beloved 
grandmother has died. What is truest about this rich, satisfying film, is that 
it suggests that it's unrealistic to expect that the lessons learned in crisis 
will have a truly lasting effect. 
</P>
<P>
Written by Istvan Kardos and directed by Pal Erdoss, "Tolerance" (1986), which 
screens Sunday at 7:30 p.m., is an another unflinching contemporary drama, in 
which a dreamy young man (Denes Dobrei) and his wife (Erika Ozsda) both wind up 
in jail on petty offenses and discover how nearly impossible it will be for 
them to regain custody of their two young daughters. "Tolerance" suggests the 
state is as intent on destroying the family as it was more than 35 years 
earlier, as depicted in "Never, Nowhere, to No One!" 
</P>
<P>
The major discovery of the series is the last film, Bela Tarr's "Damnation" 
(1988). Working from the slightest of plots devised by himself and Laszlo 
Krasznahorkai, Tarr's fiercely demanding film is a triumph of sound and image 
in the manner of the late Andrei Tarkovsky (with a touch of David Lynch thrown 
in for good measure). Set in a desolate small town, it deals with the highly 
tentative and treacherous relationships of an existentialist outsider (Miklos 
B. Szekely) to the woman he loves, her husband, and a cynical bartender for 
whom the husband, at the outsider's behest, goes on a smuggling mission. 
"Damnation" is one of those films in which nothing seems to happen yet 
everything has changed by the end. With its stark, moody black-and-white images 
it has more style and individuality than all the other films put together.

IT'S ROCK VS. REALITY AT 'WEDDING' BAND'S SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
It was just another Monday night at the Coconut Teaszer, except that the 
big-haired band on stage wasn't real, most of the Gypsies, tramps and shady 
businessmen in the colorful crowd weren't real, the record-company president 
and his lovely assistant unctuously greeting the reviewer weren't real, and 
after a while even said reviewer began to feel not long for this sphere of 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
What this was was the local club debut of Donny Dulce &amp; Fusion, better 
known as the "Tony N' Tina's Wedding" band, as seen in the brilliantly funny 
interactive theater production currently packing 'em in at the Park Plaza 
Hotel. The rockin' quartet used its night off from Madonna medleys to try out a 
batch of original material from a supposedly imminent album debut, with the 
entire wedding party on hand and in character. 
</P>
<P>
Spinal Tap's show at the Music Machine back in '84 is the closest thing in 
memory to the sense of disorientation offered here. If anything, cheerful 
popsters Dulce &amp; Fusion have a much harder job than those dinosaur-rock 
imposters, in that they're reasonably proficient, spookily commercial and 
entirely believable in their unerring sense for the contemporary cliche -- all 
the way down to the requisite cautionary tale about "life on the edge" and a 
romantic power ballad amid their party anthems. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing is too obvious about any of this on-target musical fiction. So you had 
to wonder what any oblivious Teaszer patrons thought when the second set 
finally descended into pandemonium, like the wedding itself. It seems that 
about the time bridesmaid Donna stripped down to her lingerie to warble "Wind 
Beneath My Wings" with the band, her boyfriend Dominick realized that she had 
indeed been carrying on with singer Donny. Much brawling, pipe-wielding and 
Italian profanity ensued, on stage and in the courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the disgruntled male wedding-party members, still in character, headed 
down the street to the Body Shop, while the ersatz record-company head 
drunkenly crawled around the corner of Sunset and Crescent Heights with his 
pants around his ankles. It wasn't any more inconceivable than a night out with 
Thelonious Monster, and at half the actual danger to one's person. CHRIS

POLICE VOLUNTEERS ROLL AGAINST CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE WARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
POMONA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Darwin Tuttle, a retired real estate broker, maneuvers the squad car slowly 
through a tough neighborhood in Pomona's west end. It is dark outside, and all 
around him are rows of houses with barred windows and front yards protected by 
chain-link fences. 
</P>
<P>
"Pomona was beautiful when I came here in 1952," Tuttle said. "You could smell 
the orange blossoms in the morning." 
</P>
<P>
But that was 38 years ago. Now Tuttle, at the age of 70, is behind the wheel of 
a police cruiser driving through a neighborhood where crime is about as common 
as citrus trees were in the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
He is one of nine volunteers who have joined the Police Department's new 
Citizen Volunteer Patrol. The patrol, which made its first rounds last week, is 
a souped-up, higher-tech cousin to Neighborhood Watch. 
</P>
<P>
The department has painted two of its former patrol cars white and reserved 
them for use by volunteers who, unescorted by police officers, cruise the city 
looking for suspicious incidents to report over their car radios. 
</P>
<P>
"We're supposed to be the eyes and the ears of the Police Department," Tuttle 
said. 
</P>
<P>
On four hours of patrol one night last week, Tuttle drove up and down Mission 
Boulevard and Holt Avenue and through high-crime residential neighborhoods but 
found nothing worth relaying to the police. Maybe it's too cold for criminals 
to be out, Tuttle said. 
</P>
<P>
Tuttle said another recent evening of patrol was more productive. He and a 
partner spotted a van weaving along Mission Boulevard. They radioed for a 
regular police unit and followed the van themselves until police caught up. 
</P>
<P>
The van driver "was drunk as a goose," Tuttle said. By getting the driver off 
the road, "I think we may have saved somebody's life." 
</P>
<P>
The volunteers wear tan uniforms, make their rounds unarmed and have no power 
to make arrests. Their patrol vehicles do not have red lights or sirens but are 
equipped with the sort of blinking yellow lights that are mounted on the top of 
road maintenance vehicles. If a major crime occurs while they are on patrol, 
volunteers have been told that their first, and perhaps only, assignment will 
be to stay out of the way. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, police say, they are hoping that the Citizen Volunteer Patrol can 
make a difference in the fight against crime. The department plans to expand 
the program to 100 volunteers or more. 
</P>
<P>
One of the patrol's missions is psychological warfare. Police say that putting 
more cars with police emblems on the street discourages crime even if the cars 
don't contain regular officers. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Joe Romero, who trains the volunteers, said a citizens patrol unit drove 
prostitutes away from one area one day by simply parking there. 
</P>
<P>
One of the program's controversial elements is a plan by Interim Police Chief 
Kelson McDaniel to equip patrol members with video cameras so they can openly 
record street transactions by drug dealers and prostitutes. He said cameras 
could push some of the trade out of town. 
</P>
<P>
"A drug dealer does not want to perform his transaction in the presence of 
witnesses," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He dismissed suggestions that playing cameraman could be risky to a volunteer 
under the circumstances. "There will be two or three (volunteers) there. I 
think there is a great deal of safety in numbers," McDaniel said, adding that 
patrol members are instructed to avoid confrontations. 
</P>
<P>
Romero said volunteers follow the rule that "when a dog is snarling at you, you 
don't try to pet it." 
</P>
<P>
He said that the use of video cameras is being approached cautiously, not only 
because of the risk of confrontations, but also because police are aware that 
the cameras could be seen by some people as unwelcome surveillance by a "Big 
Brother" government. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Trojanowicz, director of the National Center for Community Policing at 
Michigan State University, said residents have discouraged drug dealing in some 
cities by snapping pictures of license plates of customers who drive up to buy 
drugs. Often, he said, there isn't any film in the camera, but the act of 
appearing to take pictures scares away customers. 
</P>
<P>
Such activities must be supervised by police to avoid confrontations and to 
safeguard constitutional rights, Trojanowicz said, but can work to push drug 
dealers out of an area. "Unfortunately, drug dealing has gotten so far out of 
hand that unconventional methods have to be used," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A number of cities have community volunteers who assist the police, but most 
use the volunteers for more routine tasks than the sort of heavy patroling 
envisioned in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
In Claremont, Capt. Russ Brown said the Police Department began a Retired 
Senior Volunteer Patrol five years ago. The program involves 15 people, 60 and 
older, who keep tabs on houses while residents are on vacation, run errands, 
direct traffic, patrol commercial areas, and issue citations to people who 
illegally park in handicapped spaces. Members also have taken part in low-risk 
surveillance operations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said the Claremont project was a finalist in a League of California 
Cities competition for innovative city programs and has been copied by a number 
of police agencies in San Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona Councilman Tomas Ursua, who initiated the program in Pomona, said the 
ultimate plan is to divide the city into 10 districts, each with a patrol car 
available to volunteers. He described the program as a "self-help approach" 
that will enable residents to clean up crime in their own neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have unlimited resources to keep pumping cops into the community," 
Ursua said. By using volunteers, the 160-officer Police Department gains 
manpower. And, he said, the patrols could help solve crimes because residents 
might be willing to confide to community volunteers information that they would 
not tell police officers. 
</P>
<P>
The first volunteers range in age from 24 to 70 and include two homemakers, the 
owner of a computer service, a gas station manager, an accountant and a 
teachers' aide. Only four live in Pomona; the others live in nearby 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
Eighteen other people have applied to join the patrol and are being screened. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers receive 40 hours of training in radio operations, traffic control, 
gang identification and other matters. They also must pass a criminal 
background check and a physical examination. 
</P>
<P>
Romero said that some police officers have been skeptical about the volunteer 
program and that there have been jokes around the police station alluding to a 
1987 movie, "Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol." 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, the first time a volunteer went out to relieve a sworn officer 
directing traffic in the rain, it was clear that police were going to welcome 
the assistance. 
</P>
<P>
Romero said volunteers are asked to donate at least 16 hours a month to the 
city. There is no compensation. "It's a big sacrifice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
David Swift, a 52-year-old security guard, said he joined the patrol because of 
his lifelong interest in police work and his concern about crime. "The gang and 
drug problem seems to be really bad," he said. Pomona had a record 44 homicides 
last year, and there have been six murders in the first few weeks of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Tuttle said he too was motivated to join the program because he thinks it can 
reduce crime. He also thinks it could help clean up the city's spreading 
reputation. He said that when he sat down at a blackjack table in Nevada not 
long ago and revealed that he lived in Pomona, the dealer blurted out: "Oh my 
God, you're lucky to be here." 
</P>
<P>
Tuttle said he has tried to persuade others to join the community patrol but "a 
lot of people said to me that they're afraid of it." Tuttle said he believes 
that residents are going to have to work together to combat crime. "This whole 
business of seeing something, running in the house and hiding under the bed has 
to end," he said.

SCALED-DOWN PROJECT PROPOSED FOR AIRPORT; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: SANTA MONICA MAYOR SAYS THE CITY NEEDS THE REVENUE. HE SUGGESTS A 
PLAN THAT INCLUDES LESS OFFICE SPACE AND 20 ACRES SET ASIDE FOR A PARK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Having lost his fight to save a commercial office project proposed for Santa 
Monica Municipal Airport, Mayor Dennis Zane is scrambling to win public support 
for a smaller project, saying the city needs the revenue the project would 
generate. 
</P>
<P>
In the face of a voter initiative to overturn the project and opposition from 
Los Angeles officials and residents, the City Council, at Zane's request, 
rescinded its approval of the larger 822,000-square-foot development. Zane is 
now proposing a 580,000-square-foot project with 20 acres set aside for a park. 
</P>
<P>
Zane estimates that the smaller project would generate more than $200 million 
over the 75-year life of the development agreement. 
</P>
<P>
He said he would like to see his new proposal placed on the November municipal 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"The community interest is best served by a ballot measure," said Zane. "The 
burden of compromise is to find a place where people who disagreed with me 
agree with me. I am willing to set aside my initial judgment and find a common 
judgment." 
</P>
<P>
Zane said he believes that the strong opposition to the 822,000-square-foot 
office project resulted in part from the council's failure to adequately 
communicate the need for the revenue it would produce. 
</P>
<P>
"I have spent eight, nine years on the council," said Zane, who was elected to 
a third term in 1988. "Through that time I have been committed . . . to quality 
education, a quality park system, providing an environment in which our 
children can grow up healthy, and in public safety. 
</P>
<P>
"The airport project would allow us to address some of those needs. . . . The 
benefits are significantly superior to the burdens on the other side." 
</P>
<P>
Because a referendum drive collected nearly 8,000 valid signatures, the council 
was obligated to rescind its Oct. 10 approval of the project or place the 
matter before the public; on Tuesday, the council rescinded its approval by a 
6-1 vote. Only Councilman William Jenning voted against the repeal, saying he 
believes that the matter should have been placed on the ballot. The city staff 
was also directed to contact community leaders both supportive and opposed to 
the project to develop a process in which a new proposal could be presented and 
discussed. A recommendation is expected in 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
Zane said placing the larger project on the ballot with so much opposition 
would have been like playing a game of chicken, in which two cars race at each 
other, each taking the chance that the other will move out of the way first. 
</P>
<P>
"The appropriate thing is not to play chicken, but to find a negotiated 
compromise," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Zane's council colleagues praised his decision. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to recognize the need to have any project grow out of the will of the 
people . . . and articulated by the people," said Councilman David Finkel, who 
in October voted against the larger project. 
</P>
<P>
"The lesson I hope we all learned is that the people want a say on whatever is 
done with the land," said Councilman Ken Genser, another earlier opponent of 
the larger project. "I don't think it was a matter that (the residents) didn't 
understand (the need for revenue), it was that they didn't like what was being 
proposed." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Herb Katz was the third councilman who voted against the project. 
Council members Judy Abdo, Christine Reed and Jennings joined Zane in voting 
for it. 
</P>
<P>
Former Mayor Jim Conn, who supported the project while in office through 1988 
and then formed a citizens group to support it, said he is disappointed that 
Zane gave up the fight. 
</P>
<P>
"I really regret that it has come to this," Conn said. "The proposal that we 
made originally is the best thing for the future of the city. I don't think 
there is any evidence that (the project) would have lost (in a referendum 
election). What we have is 10% of the people who said they wanted it to go to 
the ballot." 
</P>
<P>
However, he added, "I will support whatever the council feels is appropriate. 
There has to be a viable revenue flow from that property. Of course, it makes 
perfect political sense to find consensus rather than go to the mat." 
</P>
<P>
The development began as a 1.3-million-square-foot office project in 1987, when 
the City Council selected Reliance Development Group to develop 37.5 acres of 
unused airport land on the city's eastern border. But opposition from residents 
in Santa Monica and nearby Mar Vista over potential traffic and pollution 
problems persuaded city staff to recommend early last year that the project be 
reduced to 1 million square feet. 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission recommended that the project be further reduced to 
between 600,000 and 750,000 square feet. In October, the City Council narrowly 
approved the 822,000-square-foot project. 
</P>
<P>
Within a month, a citizens committee had collected nearly 8,000 valid 
signatures, and a homeowner and a pilots group had filed suit challenging the 
city's authority to approve development of the public land without voter 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, a Mar Vista resident filed suit challenging the project's 
environmental impact report. Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley supported the suit 
and denounced the project as environmentally insensitive. Los Angeles City 
Council members Marvin Braude and Ruth Galanter, whose districts abut Santa 
Monica, had already come out against the project. 
</P>
<P>
Although the project would be built entirely within Santa Monica, the only 
access to it would be from Bundy Drive in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles traffic engineers are currently studying the traffic impact of the 
new smaller proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Although some opponents of the rejected project have said privately that they 
would support the smaller proposal because of the recreational facilities, 
others are waiting to see specific plans and financial projections before 
committing to it. 
</P>
<P>
"It does not make sense to approve a project whose revenues would be used 
wholly to support a new park," said Councilwoman Abdo. "If there is agreement 
among the various people that results in a project that brings in enough 
revenues for the city, I would be supportive." 
</P>
<P>
Greg Thomas, the Mar Vista resident who filed suit against Santa Monica, said 
he is still concerned that the project could be enlarged. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a doubting Thomas, so to speak, as to whether this is the project the will 
eventually be presented to the people of Santa Monica," he said. "Whatever is 
presented, we want to make sure that the concerns of Los Angeles are 
addressed." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Henry Lambert, president of Reliance, said his company has been 
unfairly caught in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
"We were asked by the city to build a development, and we were awarded a 
development of 1.3 million square feet," he said in an interview. "Then, after 
spending $3 million, the process is telling us now that we will be lucky to get 
600,000 square feet. Obviously that is not what we bargained for. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an absurd process to get this far down the road and have it fall apart. 
This was a well-thought-out project. Both we and the city have spent a lot of 
time and money to negotiate a complicated agreement. To have a metamorphosis at 
this point is absurd. In a just world, the city would be legally, or at least 
morally, bound to the project." 
</P>
<P>
But he says he will continue negotiations to build something at the site. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like to have as large a project as possible," Lambert said. "But we 
will do what we can to save the project."

UNDERGROUND GAS TANKS TARGET OF CRACKDOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura County Fire Department has violated by more than a year a state 
deadline to clean up the department's leaking underground gasoline storage 
tanks. 
</P>
<P>
The Fire Department, along with the U.S. Post Office and 273 others who own or 
operate underground tanks in the county, recently received letters from the 
county's Environmental Health Department threatening prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
The letters warn the violators that they must comply immediately with the law 
designed to protect the state's underground drinking water, or face fines of up 
to $5,000 per day. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura County district attorney's office, which will prosecute the cases, 
plans to pick several of the violators to use as examples, said Greg Brose, 
deputy district attorney for the consumer and environmental protection 
division. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how many cases we'll begin with," Brose said. "But we're going to 
file enough cases to get other companies to understand that they will be next 
in line." 
</P>
<P>
At stake is the public health and the drinking water of future generations, one 
health department official said. 
</P>
<P>
"Benzene, which is a component of gasoline, is a known carcinogen," said 
Douglas Beach, manager of the county's underground tanks program for 
Environmental Health. "Somewhere down the road if this is not taken care of, 
there is a good possibility that it will be in our drinking water." 
</P>
<P>
John McLaughlin, environmental health specialist for the county, said the 
county has not yet brought legal action against any violators of the law 
because of a staff shortage in the environmental health enforcement area. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been extremely, probably too patient with them," McLaughlin said. 
</P>
<P>
McLaughlin said that as many as 75 of the 275 violators may actually have 
installed new tanks or monitoring systems and simply failed to notify the 
county. But he added that 200 operators out of compliance still represents 
one-third of the 590 operators of underground tanks countywide. 
</P>
<P>
Describing the county's enforcement problems, McLaughlin said that as few as 
one person at times has been assigned to the underground tanks program during 
the past year. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had positions open for as long as six months at a time," McLaughlin 
said. When he was the sole man working on the program, enforcement and 
inspections had to "take a back seat" to other business, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Two men are now assigned full time to enforcing the law; one is in the field 
checking on the operators and the other in the office. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Brose said a poorly written county ordinance was also to 
blame for the delays in forcing compliance. The ordinance had to be rewritten 
last year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
To date, no benzene or other harmful components of gasoline have been found in 
county drinking water, although gasoline from tanks has contaminated drinking 
water in other areas of the state, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
The law, which is part of California's Health and Safety Code, required all 
operators to install by Jan. 1, 1989, systems around existing tanks to detect 
leaks. Operators could also replace the antiquated single-walled tanks with 
tanks that have a second outside wall that would catch any accidental releases 
or leaks. A third option allows them to do monthly testing, but that process 
proves too costly over the long run, McLaughlin said. 
</P>
<P>
The state is in the process of setting up a statewide data base on the program 
but had no current figures or estimates on compliance, the State Water 
Resources Control Board said. 
</P>
<P>
In the city of Ventura, the only area in Ventura County that operates its own 
underground tank program, the compliance rate is 100%, said Brian Clark, who 
runs the program for the city Fire Department. Clark has 344 tanks within his 
jurisdiction and said that all operators are complying with the law. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the owners and operators put off the replacements because they are 
costly, program officials said. A leak detection system can cost between 
$12,000 and $25,000. Cleanup of contaminated soil and water can run from 
$50,000 to $300,000 and more, McLaughlin said. 
</P>
<P>
The County Fire Department, for example, has budgeted $389,000 for work this 
fiscal year, Fire Chief Rand-Scott Coggan said, and the work is far from over. 
He blamed the delay on a shortage of qualified contractors competent to do the 
work. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously we will need to keep budgeting more every year," he said, adding 
that there is no projected completion date. 
</P>
<P>
The county Fire Department had 22 gasoline tanks stored underground, which it 
used to fill fire engines and other equipment. Of those, six tanks have been 
removed, and only two of the projects completed, Coggan said. Three Thousand 
Oaks stations now must borrow gasoline from neighboring stations because their 
tanks have been dug up, but new ones not yet installed, Coggan said. 
</P>
<P>
Coggan said the Fire Department itself has no direct role in hiring the 
contractors to replace its underground tanks. He said the projects are routed 
through the county's Public Works Department, which hires the private 
contractors. 
</P>
<P>
"We're really just a customer in the program," he said. "We can't go out and do 
it ourselves. We are devoted to getting the tanks replaced. We don't want to do 
any environmental damage, but we can only move as fast as the contractors." 
</P>
<P>
The short-term solution for the Fire Department may be to shut down its tanks 
altogether and start buying gasoline from private gas stations, Coggan said. 
The Rincon station near the Santa Barbara County line already does that, 
purchasing gasoline from a station in Carpinteria. 
</P>
<P>
"That will cost the taxpayer more, but it is the most expedient means of 
getting the job done and into compliance," Coggan said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the troubles the Fire Department has run into in trying to 
comply with the law, private operators also complained this week about the high 
cost of compliance. 
</P>
<P>
Shakar Khan, who operates the Mobil station at Oak Street and Thompson 
Boulevard in Ventura, estimated that the ongoing work to clean up the ground 
water his leaking tanks contaminated has cost $250,000. In addition, the 
station's closure for seven months and 10 days has hurt business. 
</P>
<P>
"People are used to go somewhere else now," he said. "But we know the future is 
good here so we stay." 
</P>
<P>
In the Mobil case, in which the owners were four months beyond the deadline 
when the leak was detected, it was less ground water contamination than the 
danger of explosion that motivated the city to force a quick cleanup. Fumes 
from the hundreds of gallons of gasoline that leaked could have created enough 
pressure to blow up, City Inspector Brian Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's happened in other areas of the country where there have been explosions 
in storm drains and basements," he said. 
</P>
<P>
None of the water near the Mobil station is used for drinking water and it ran 
through storm drains where it emptied out at the beach. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria) introduced legislation last week 
that would allow business owners, or whole counties, to form districts that 
would allow them to issue bonds to pay for cleanup costs up front. They would 
pay back the bonds over 30 years through assessment of district members. 
</P>
<P>
That could give more business owners incentive to move ahead, O'Connell said.

MEDICINE: OXNARD DOCTOR DALE HOYT FLIES TO BAJA EVERY MONTH TO TREAT THE SICK 
-- 28 YEARS AFTER HE FOUNDED THE 1,400-MEMBER FLYING SAMARITANS.

<P>
PUNTA PRIETA, Mexico 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ruddy-cheeked man in the brown leather bomber jacket clambered out of the 
Cessna 210 and looked briefly across the forsaken plain, the dusty view broken 
only by occasional clumps of cactus and scrubby underbrush. 
</P>
<P>
Eager to check on a baby he had helped treat for a brain abnormality, Dr. Dale 
Hoyt waited for three gun-toting soldiers in camouflage to finish inspecting 
the plane. Then he hurried across the small military landing strip and hoisted 
himself onto the back of a rusty, orange cattle truck heading toward the 
100-person village of Punta Prieta. 
</P>
<P>
But bad news waited there for the 68-year-old Oxnard doctor who founded the 
Flying Samaritans, an organization that has provided medical services in remote 
areas of Baja for 28 years. 
</P>
<P>
The 15-month-old baby had been dead for a week. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard," Hoyt said, shaking his head slowly back and forth. "It's really 
hard." 
</P>
<P>
Kay Hoyt, 55, the doctor's wife and assistant for 14 years, struggled against 
her tears as did some of the other 20-odd volunteers who had traveled for three 
hours in private planes to host their monthly medical clinic. 
</P>
<P>
But the doctors, nurses, dentists, pilots and errand-runners had little time 
for grief. 
</P>
<P>
It was 1 p.m. and in just a few hours the sun would dip behind the mountains, 
making it impossible for the five private planes transporting the group to fly 
to the next town, Bahia de Los Angeles, where there are no lights to illuminate 
the small landing strip. 
</P>
<P>
The team members -- some along for the first time, others seasoned veterans of 
the expeditions -- hurried into a light-blue building that had been set up for 
medical services. 
</P>
<P>
The outside walls were punctuated by jagged holes. Inside, particle-board 
partitions smudged with dirt and buckling from their frames separated three 
examining rooms and a dental office, where two antique chairs faced each other. 
</P>
<P>
In the pharmacy area, seemingly endless bottles of pills and creams, most 
donated by doctors from the United States, crammed makeshift plywood shelves. A 
cardboard box served as a trash basket. 
</P>
<P>
Outside, townspeople gathered around. The arrival of the Flying "Sams" is about 
the biggest social event in town, drawing people from outlying communities who 
are eager to see the doctor or the dentist. 
</P>
<P>
The clinic is the only means of medical treatment for many of the people in and 
near Punta Prieta, a town about 500 miles south of Ventura County that was 
built as a compound for road workers during construction 15 years ago of the 
two-lane highway that extends the length of Baja's finger-like peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
People still live in the barracks-like structures that include a communal 
eating hall and recreation room. The outlying area is dotted with houses, built 
mostly of cinder blocks, interspersed with abandoned cars rusted to their 
chassis. 
</P>
<P>
To this and other poor communities, the Samaritans provide a scholarship 
program to encourage children to stay in school. On this trip, they also hosted 
a Christmas party, for which kids lined up to choose from hundreds of toys. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a steady stream of people swarmed around the entrance of the medical 
clinic, where Flying Sams sorted records at a card table. 
</P>
<P>
Hoyt waited in an examination room along with his wife and a nurse. 
</P>
<P>
As he mused about his observations -- "Little bit of redness in left ear canal 
. . . OK, they're both red" -- Kay Hoyt took copious notes. 
</P>
<P>
She read them back to him, whereupon he made a diagnosis and called out an 
appropriate prescription. 
</P>
<P>
To most of the people he sees, Hoyt is just another doctor with the group. 
</P>
<P>
Even new Flying Samaritan volunteers ask chatty questions about his background, 
not realizing he is responsible for the international organization that boasts 
about 1,400 members. 
</P>
<P>
The idea for the organization took form in 1961 after two American pilots 
flying from La Paz to San Diego were forced to make an emergency landing on an 
isolated mesa during a dust storm. People from the nearby village of El Rosario 
fed and sheltered the two women before finding more fuel for their plane and 
sending them home. 
</P>
<P>
Impressed with the kindness of the townspeople, the two women, Polly Ross and 
Ailene Mellott, organized an airlift of food and toys to the 1,200 people in 
the fishing village. Hoyt, a pilot with the Civil Air Patrol, joined the 
effort. After the deliveries had been made, the villagers were asked if they 
wanted to see a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
On that first visit, Hoyt held office hours on a kitchen table as another pilot 
held a flashlight for him to see. He examined only 22 people -- some with 
hernias or tonsillitis, one woman with cancer of the uterus -- before he ran 
out of supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Drawn again and again by the needs of the people, Hoyt continued flying back to 
the remote town. 
</P>
<P>
"I was frustrated," Hoyt said. "Walking off and leaving somebody was kind of 
rough." 
</P>
<P>
Within months he had established a monthly clinic that ultimately became the 
Flying Samaritans, a nonprofit organization with nine chapters in California 
and others in Arizona and Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
The largest chapter is called the Foothill Chapter and has about 300 members 
from around Los Angeles and Ventura counties. Hoyt joined this chapter when he 
moved to Oxnard from Orange County two years ago to begin a personal injury 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
The Hoyts were attracted to Oxnard because it is far enough from Los Angeles to 
be rural but close enough for access to different cultural activities. 
</P>
<P>
"Oxnard is a comfortable town, a caring town," Kay Hoyt said. 
</P>
<P>
While he was very active in the Flying Sams in the past, Hoyt has begun to slow 
down in recent years, content to fade into the background and leave the 
leadership of the group to others. 
</P>
<P>
On his trips to Mexico, he concentrates only on treating those who come to see 
him, his ego seemingly uninflated by the kudos given to the welfare service 
that helps people in more than 20 Mexican towns. 
</P>
<P>
"It is of great significance to our lives," said Margarita Cota, 42, Punta 
Prieta's unofficial mayor. "They have done a great many helpful things." 
</P>
<P>
If a medical emergency arises between the periodic visits from Hoyt and his 
colleagues, residents try to borrow a car and head to Ensenada or Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, they wait for the Flying Samaritans. 
</P>
<P>
Maria Sanchez, 38, wanted to see the dentist about a sore tooth that has hurt 
her for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
"I can eat nothing too cold and nothing too hot," Sanchez said. "I am not able 
to eat on the left side of my mouth." 
</P>
<P>
Indolecio de Perez, 72, and his wife, Germana, 60, walked for four days to get 
to the clinic. The old man, wearing a soiled blue dress shirt and black shoes 
scuffed to a dull gray, was told he must have surgery for a hernia. His sight 
also is failing. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to make saddles," Germana de Perez explained. "Now, he cannot see. He 
is not able to cut the leather." 
</P>
<P>
In halting Spanish, a nurse explained that Germana de Perez must also seek 
further tests and treatment at a Baja medical clinic for an abdominal infection 
caused by unsanitary drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
But the Samaritans could do nothing more for the couple that day. They had 
treated about 40 people, and it was time to board their planes and head to 
Bahia de Los Angeles, a coastal fishing village of about 500 people. 
</P>
<P>
Dale and Kay Hoyt stayed near the back of the cattle truck. She exchanged 
pleasantries while Hoyt, a quiet man with a wry sense of humor, studied the 
others on the trip. 
</P>
<P>
Hoyt, with his calm blue eyes and slate-gray hair, spoke in a slow and measured 
manner as he recalled his first visits to Mexico. When Hoyt began the clinics, 
he would bring his family, putting them to work. His brother interpreted for 
him. His wife held a flashlight during surgery. 
</P>
<P>
The villagers were not used to the ways of the Americans, Hoyt said. 
</P>
<P>
Nurses on the trip were warned by the local residents that wearing shorts was 
improper. The modest townspeople were reluctant to submit to exams. 
</P>
<P>
"There were so many gowns and slips that to do a pelvic exam in those days it 
was difficult to get all those clothes off," Hoyt said. 
</P>
<P>
They spent one night in a room with goats, Hoyt recalled. They also slept in 
sleeping bags under the wings of their plane. 
</P>
<P>
As he reminisced, it became apparent how much the organization has meant to 
Hoyt. For Kay Hoyt, also, the group is as important as family. 
</P>
<P>
"We eat together and work together for 24 hours and we are four to six little 
people up in a plane all together," Kay Hoyt said. "You go down with strangers, 
and you leave hugging." 
</P>
<P>
Hoyt disengaged himself from the Samaritans for five years, when he and Kay 
moved to Northern California where they started a farm raising exotic animals 
and he lived the life of a country doctor. 
</P>
<P>
A nostalgic trip back to El Rosario in 1984 illustrated to Hoyt how much he 
missed his work in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
As Hoyt walked through the town where he had held the Samaritans' first 
clinics, people came down from the hills to welcome him, Kay Hoyt said. 
</P>
<P>
"They would say, 'Don't you remember you delivered my baby?' " Kay Hoyt said. " 
'He's 21 now.' " 
</P>
<P>
He rejoined the Flying Samaritans, treating everything from leprosy to cleft 
palate. He has amputated a gangrenous foot and removed part of a cancerous ear. 
He has seen a woman, her cancer metastasized, seemingly cure herself with doses 
of an Indian tea made from local plants. And he has arranged surgery in the 
United States that allowed a girl to regain her sight. 
</P>
<P>
Now, though, the Hoyts and other Flying Samaritans are turning their attention 
to the future. 
</P>
<P>
Dale and Kay Hoyt are anticipating their next trip. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been fun as well as a challenge," Hoyt said.

NEW CONTRACT GIVES 16% PAY RAISE OVER 2 YEARS TO TEACHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORI GRANGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
La Canada Flintridge schoolteachers and administrators agreed Tuesday on a 
contract that will raise teachers' salaries 16% over the next two years, ending 
a months-long dispute that triggered angry demonstrations and forced a state 
mediator to intervene. 
</P>
<P>
The contract was approved unanimously and without discussion Tuesday night by 
the La Canada Unified School District Board of Education. Teachers had voted 
118 to 2 to ratify the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
School district officials and representatives of the La Canada Teachers Assn. 
praised each other's efforts for the first time since last June, when wage 
negotiations began. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone's in a good mood because we're back to working as a family again and 
our real job of educating kids," said Martin Lipofsky, a science teacher at La 
Canada High School and president of the teachers' association. "We weren't 
trying to harm the district. It's a pleasure that we have settled our 
differences." 
</P>
<P>
The agreement calls for a 10% salary increase for the 1989-90 school year that 
will be retroactive to last September. Teachers' wages will then be raised an 
additional 6% this September for 1990-91, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers are in the second year of a three-year contract that requires wages to 
be negotiated each year. The agreement reached Tuesday, however, will keep 
wages off the bargaining table until 1991-92. 
</P>
<P>
The increase will boost the pay of a beginning teacher from $20,270 to $24,660 
in two years. Top salaries for teachers with 25 years of experience will jump 
from $42,970 to $50,760. 
</P>
<P>
The raise will move La Canada teachers -- until now among the lowest paid in 
the state -- to more competitive levels, Lipofsky said. 
</P>
<P>
But it carries a heavy price tag, said Judith Glickman, La Canada district 
superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
Glickman said the 16% increase will cost the district about $1.2 million -- 
$700,000 for the first year and $500,000 for the second. Although the district 
will be able to pay for this year's increase, it will have to cut about 
$725,000 from elsewhere in next year's $16.3-million budget to counter the pay 
hikes and a $300,000 revenue shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have enough in our reserves to support the cost next year," she said. 
"The $725,000 reduction is a significant amount. But we'll work with it. We're 
very pleased we've settled." 
</P>
<P>
Until now, teachers' representatives had demanded a 10% raise, scoffing at a 7% 
offer by the district. They claimed the district had $2 million in reserves to 
use for salary increases. Officials had insisted that only $800,000 was 
available. 
</P>
<P>
But a review earlier this month of the district's interim budget and a $200,000 
windfall from the state for average daily attendance increases allowed the 
district to make the better offer, Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
The difference in cost to the district between the 7% and 10% offers was about 
$200,000, Lipofsky said. 
</P>
<P>
"We think the money has always been there, but that it was a question of 
priorities," he said. "But school districts plan a conservative budget. That's 
their job." 
</P>
<P>
Teachers, citing their students' high test scores and their standing among the 
lowest-paid instructors in the state, had picketed several times at schools and 
at Board of Education meetings. 
</P>
<P>
In November, they declared an impasse in negotiations and asked the state to 
send a mediator to intervene. On Jan. 10, the mediator met separately with both 
sides and had planned to meet again Wednesday. But teachers' representatives 
and district officials were able to resolve their differences on their own in 
sessions late last week, Lipofsky said.

WELFARE OFFICE RELOCATION AGAIN ON HOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA L. WILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A long-awaited plan to move a crowded county welfare office away from downtown 
Glendale hit a snag Tuesday when one City Council member vowed outright to 
oppose public support of the project and two others squabbled briefly over the 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, proposed by a private developer about two months ago, calls for the 
city to obtain a short-term, $1.7-million bank loan to help the developer 
purchase a site for the welfare office. 
</P>
<P>
Similar attempts to purchase other sites have fallen through because an 
agreement with the county was not reached quickly enough to complete the deals, 
said William Holderness of Brand Developers, which has been working for more 
than three years to find a new site for the welfare office. 
</P>
<P>
This time, he has asked the city to help secure the land first and has pledged 
to repay the loan at no cost to the city within a year. Holderness is proposing 
a new welfare office for an industrial 2.5-acre site at 4666 San Fernando Road, 
once site of the Sea and Jungle Import Shop. 
</P>
<P>
Holderness plans to purchase the site with the city's help, build a new county 
welfare office with some adjoining retail shops and lease the facility back to 
the county. He would repay the city loan once he has an agreement with the 
county and can get a construction loan. 
</P>
<P>
Agency Chairman Larry Zarian in December postponed action on the proposal 
because Councilwoman Ginger Bremberg was absent from the agency meeting. 
However, with all members present Tuesday, Zarian again asked for a delay, 
saying he learned this week that the developer has revised plans for a new 
welfare office. 
</P>
<P>
The action brought a sharp retort from Mayor Jerold Milner who asked, "What do 
you think is going to change in the next two weeks? I don't want to see another 
location fall through." 
</P>
<P>
Zarian's voice rose slightly when he told Milner, "I am not comfortable with 
that tone of voice." Milner shot back, "Mr. Zarian, please don't lecture me." 
</P>
<P>
The matter was put over to Feb. 6. 
</P>
<P>
Zarian said in an interview later that he is concerned that City Council 
members, who sit as the agency, be aware of all the details of the transaction 
before they vote. 
</P>
<P>
However, city officials said Holderness' plan could be the key to persuading 
the county Department of Public Social Services to move out of its crowded 
offices at 225 E. Broadway. By using city-backed funding for partial purchase 
of a new site, the interest costs could be kept low and the savings passed onto 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
The architecturally mundane county building on Broadway is in the heart of a 
two-block area called The Exchange, which the redevelopment agency is 
attempting to revitalize with upscale retail shops, offices, restaurants and a 
movie complex. However, Bremberg on Tuesday said she is opposed to using any 
city money for a private development. "I will vote against this," she said.

NEW CITYWIDE OVERNIGHT PARKING PLAN DRAWS UPROAR; 
</P>
<P>
REGULATION: IN SPITE OF AN ANGRY RESPONSE, A CITY COMMISSION WILL MEET FEB. 5 
ON WHETHER TO FORWARD TO CITY COUNCIL A DRAFT ORDINANCE FOR PAID PARKING 
PERMITS IN EVERY NEIGHBORHOOD.

<P>
Residents of South Glendale roared when officials proposed requiring paid 
permits for overnight street parking in their neighborhoods. Officials got the 
message and proposed citywide permits -- and now people from all over are 
angry. 
</P>
<P>
After the original plan was made public, hundreds of south-end residents 
attended Parking Commission hearings and angrily criticized the proposed 
ordinance as a discriminatory and unfair tax. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday night, at a special Parking Commission hearing in Glendale Civic 
Auditorium, city officials unveiled details of the new version, saying it would 
be fair and reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
The new draft would offer free permits for each family's first two cars and 
reduced rates for the rest. Each dwelling unit would get a year's supply of 60 
pre-approved one-time permits for guests. And the overnight-parking program 
would be imposed citywide. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by hundreds of residents, who were notified by city 
flyers last month that there would be a citywide plan. 
</P>
<P>
They jeered, booed and heckled staff and commission members, repeated old 
arguments and brought up some new ones -- for example, that being forced to 
sign guest permits was an invasion of privacy. Many insisted that the ordinance 
does not make sense. 
</P>
<P>
"You say you are doing this to get cars off the streets, but all you're going 
to get is cars on the streets with stickers on them," said Bob Moynahan, one of 
the speakers. The audience of 300 laughed and applauded, as it did throughout 
much of the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Zarian was the only City Council member to show up. He soon left, 
politely refusing to field questions. 
</P>
<P>
The commission plans to reconvene at 3:30 p.m., Feb. 5, at the City Council 
chambers to vote on whether to recommend the ordinance it helped draft. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday commission members sat somber-faced with other city officials looking 
down from a table on the auditorium's elevated stage. Three uniformed police 
officers sat at the back of the room while nine others guarded the doors. 
</P>
<P>
These security measures -- presumably aimed at preventing the shoving incidents 
and shouting matches that marked previous meetings -- appeared to reinforce the 
residents' repeated claims that the officials are isolated and not accessible. 
</P>
<P>
"You are not listening to us!" a resident shouted into the microphone. Then, 
turning his back to the commissioners, he asked the crowd: "How many are 
against the ordinance?" More than 80% of the audience raised their hands. "How 
many are in favor?" he asked. About a dozen hands went up. 
</P>
<P>
"Democracy has spoken!" he said, as he returned to his seat showered with 
applause. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing included criticism from many parts of the city. 
</P>
<P>
"I live in La Crescenta, and I don't have a parking problem," one speaker said. 
"I don't want another tax to be able to park where I've parked for free all my 
life!" 
</P>
<P>
The biggest round of applause went to Carma Liperr, founder of Citizens Against 
Parking Permits. CAPP, she said, has sent the city close to 1,000 petitions 
opposing the proposal. Throughout the hearing, she stood at the back of the 
auditorium, clipboard in hand, with a pile of petitions waiting to be signed. 
</P>
<P>
The previous two nights, she said, she and fellow CAPP members had driven 
around the city between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m., the hours of the proposed 
restriction, placing fliers and petitions on parked cars. 
</P>
<P>
The fliers, decorated with the enlargements of $20 and $50 bills, ask, "How 
much are you willing to pay the city to park at night?" and list arguments 
against the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
As Liperr stepped up to the microphone after hearing her name called, all signs 
of weariness disappeared from her face. 
</P>
<P>
"This is baaad Carma," she began, and then proceeded to lash out at the 
officials. "Shame on you for writing this proposal!" she roared. "You say this 
is a citywide proposal, and you print the mailers announcing the meetings in 
English only? What about the Armenians and Mexicans who live in this city and 
don't speak English? How are they going to find out what's going on? Shame on 
you!" 
</P>
<P>
Claims by Liperr and others at the meeting that ethnic minority groups would be 
the most affected by the proposal appeared to be bolstered by a 
city-commissioned telephone survey made public last week. 
</P>
<P>
The study showed that, compared to "whites," a significantly lower percentage 
of Latino, Asian and Middle Eastern households have as many off-street parking 
spaces as cars. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager David Ramsay and Traffic Engineer Tom Horne said Parking 
Commission members would use parts of the survey -- but not the ethnic 
breakdown -- to fine-tune the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of the widespread opposition, the proposed ordinance has retained its 
support from the Glendale Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
In the January issue of its in-house publication, the chamber board of 
directors said the proposal would help the city "for aesthetic reasons, 
increase safety, by allowing better access to emergency vehicles, provide 
greater access for street sweeping, offer an indirect approach to limiting the 
number of persons living in residential units, and limit the number of 
automobiles." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Ken Doty, a Chamber of Commerce vice president and chamber ad hoc 
overnight parking committee member, was one of a few speakers to defend the 
proposal, although he said he was not representing the chamber. 
</P>
<P>
"Take your time to drive around cities with overnight-parking ordinances, and 
talk to the people that live there," he said. "Panic comments have been proven 
wrong in those cities." 
</P>
<P>
As he returned to the back of the room amid the snarls of the crowd, an 
acquaintance came up to Doty, patted him in the back and spoke quietly into his 
ear: "Congratulations, Ken, it takes a lot of guts to do what you just did."

HEIGHT LIMIT WORDING SET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council on Monday decided on specific language for the 
citizen-sponsored height limit initiative on the April ballot, but the 
initiative's sponsors called the wording confusing. 
</P>
<P>
The measure will read: "Shall a measure setting a maximum height of fifty-six 
(56) feet the heights of some buildings in the C-3 (Commercial), C-3MR (Midrise 
Commercial), S-1 (Studio) and P-D (Planned District) Zones be adopted?" 
</P>
<P>
Initiative co-sponsor Robin Turner, who last week accused the city of trying to 
misinform voters about the measure, said the wording is unclear, especially 
when compared to the ballot question for a competing, city-sponsored 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
That initiative would impose density limits and require traffic mitigation for 
non-residential buildings taller than 43 feet and prohibit them from blocking 
views or causing "significant detriment" with shade, shadows or glare. On the 
ballot, it will read: 
</P>
<P>
"Shall a measure establishing phasing, traffic, height, site coverage, glare, 
air flow, shade, shadow, view and vista standards for all non-residential 
developments in all zones be adopted?" 
</P>
<P>
"If I read both initiative (questions), I'd vote for theirs because it sounds 
better," said Turner, who said she opposes the city's measure because it has no 
built-in height limit and leaves too much to the discretion of the council. 
</P>
<P>
Slow-growth advocates collected nearly 3,000 signatures in 1988 to place the 
Turner-sponsored initiative on April's ballot. The city's initiative was put on 
the ballot by the council earlier this month.

YEAR-ROUND ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS GET SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEN McALPINE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Backed by parent and teacher support, a proposal to convert two Ventura 
elementary schools to year-round education appears to be gathering steam. 
</P>
<P>
In a report presented to the Ventura Unified School District board Tuesday 
night, Sheridan Way Elementary School principal Robert Fraser and E.P. Foster 
Elementary School principal Gregory Kampf urged board members to back a 
proposal that would put both schools on a year-round schedule by July. 
</P>
<P>
Kampf said a year-round schedule would allow the two schools to better meet the 
needs of the Ventura Avenue area, providing children with a wider variety of 
courses and activities. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be able to do things not just in academic terms, but in recreational and 
social terms," Kampf said. "The kids would be active in very positive 
activities that would contribute to their overall education. A lot of the kids 
in our neighborhood don't have that unless the school is able to put it 
together." 
</P>
<P>
Offerings could include mini-soccer camps, intensive remedial reading courses 
and expanded child care, Kampf said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Kampf and Fraser, there appears to be overwhelming support for 
year-round education from parents, teachers and staff at both schools, a 
conclusion drawn in part from a formal survey sent to parents in December. The 
survey did not, however, directly ask parents to make a choice between 
year-round and traditional programs, leading one parent to question the survey 
results. 
</P>
<P>
"We were never directly asked if we were in favor of a year-round or a 
traditional school," said April Martens, who also served as a member of the 
advisory committee that reviewed the year-round concept. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to use the neighborhood school, but I don't like the idea of 
being forced into just one option. I'd like to have a choice." 
</P>
<P>
No decision was made Tuesday night. The board will discuss the plan again Feb. 
13.

HILLSIDE PLAN THWARTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An attempt by the City Council to replace Sierra Madre's recently approved 
strict hillside development ordinance with a less stringent version was 
thwarted Tuesday when attorneys for hillside property owners questioned whether 
city officials had followed state environmental regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Carl West, representing property owner Michael Heflin, said the city 
should have conducted a complete environmental impact report on the proposed 
ordinance instead of the less-detailed environmental study conducted by 
consultant John Bitterly. 
</P>
<P>
The council delayed the matter until Feb. 6 to allow Bitterly time to prepare 
answers to the objections. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance, adopted Jan. 9, limits hillside construction in five vertical 
zones with densities ranging from 5 to 40 acres per house. The council's 
version creates three horizontal zones with building limitations ranging from 
15,000 square feet to 40 acres per house.

CONSTRUCTION BAN EXTENDED

<P>
A one-year building moratorium on Valley Boulevard has been extended again, 
allowing the city to halt new construction along the commercial strip until 
January, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The extension would give city planners and a Valley Boulevard steering 
committee time to complete a specific plan, which will detail what percentage 
of an area should be devoted to certain uses and what types of projects -- 
hotels, restaurants, apartments -- the city wants developed.

CITY MANAGER TO RETIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City Manager Karl Koski has announced he will retire June 30 from a public 
service career that spans three decades. 
</P>
<P>
Koski, 59, joined the city staff as an administrative assistant in 1961, a year 
after incorporation. He said he decided to retire to spend time with his 
family, travel and enjoy the outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council probably will begin with an in-house search for a new city 
manager, Koski said.

GROUPS SPONSOR ART SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A coalition of Westwood merchants, homeowners, UCLA and the Hammer Museum are 
planning a fine arts show to replace the traditional Los Angeles Business 
Council-sponsored show pushed out of the village and into Westwood Park last 
summer amid complaints that it was too big and tacky. 
</P>
<P>
According to Scott Regberg, president of the Westwood Village Merchants Assn., 
the show, set for June 2-3, will be strictly limited to fine artists. 
</P>
<P>
There will be no booths featuring clothing, jewelry or other works generally 
considered crafts, Regberg said. Craft booths were a major component of the 
traditional fair that was held on the streets of Westwood for 20 years but 
moved to Westwood Park last fall. 
</P>
<P>
The merchants' group spearheaded opposition to the traditional semiannual arts 
and crafts fair, complaining that it had grown so large it was hurting business 
by blocking people's entry. 
</P>
<P>
The merchants and homeowner groups were also critical of what they called the 
show's "tacky" quality, which they contended did not attract the upscale crowd 
they sought. 
</P>
<P>
Because property owners have to agree before the city permits a street to be 
closed, the merchants were able to prevail. 
</P>
<P>
When her show was under fire, Los Angeles Business Council President Dori Pye 
said the merchants and homeowners agenda was to mount their own show. 
</P>
<P>
Regberg said in a telephone interview that his group had tried to persuade Pye 
to scale down her event and upgrade the art but that she refused. He said that 
he does not expect profits, but that if there are any they will be used for 
community upgrades.

TASK FORCE MEMBER NAMED

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Guillermina Byrne, an attorney and former city planning commissioner, was 
appointed Tuesday by the Board of Directors to the city's Growth Management 
Task Force. She joins 12 others appointed last week to the 13-member task 
force, which, in cooperation with city planning staff members, will devise 
guidelines for Phase III of the city's growth management initiative. 
</P>
<P>
Those guidelines are expected to be completed in April for approval by the City 
Planning Commission and the Board of Directors. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative, passed by voters last March, will limit construction to 250 
residential units a year over the next 10 years. In addition, the initiative 
says that the combined annual footage of commercial projects larger than 25,000 
square feet may not exceed 250,000 square feet.

AROUND THE FOOTHILLS: IT IS EASIER TO APPRAISE A PIECE OF PROPERTY THAN A 
COMMUNITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tonight at last, the Los Angeles Public Libraries Commission will select a new 
home for the Echo Park Branch Library. 
</P>
<P>
The decision has been 19 years in the making. And still it will leave many 
disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
The original branch building was damaged in the 1971 earthquake and condemned. 
The branch was moved temporarily into a stucco office building on Laveta 
Terrace. It was cramped, ill-suited to be a library and, worst, was tucked 
inconveniently at the dead end of a street cut off by the Hollywood Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
From the beginning the libraries department planned to rebuild. But Echo Park 
was only one of dozens of branches on the capital improvement list. So it 
waited. Proposition 13, passed by the voters in 1978, extended the wait. 
</P>
<P>
In April the voters relented, at least concerning libraries, and approved 
Proposition 1, the library bond issue. About $5 million was set aside for Echo 
Park, enough in theory to buy land and build from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
After so long a wait, it would be nice to report a happy resolution. But, 
instead, tonight's meeting is sure to be a cat fight. 
</P>
<P>
The point of contention is where the new library should to be built. The 
library staff has searched up and down the streets of Echo Park and concluded 
that there is only one suitable site, the southwest corner of Temple and 
Douglas streets. 
</P>
<P>
The Friends of the Echo Park Library -- the volunteer group that helps around 
the library, recruits patrons and raises money -- detests the choice. Many of 
the Friends think the corner isn't in Echo Park at all. 
</P>
<P>
They have chosen their own site. Like the library staff, they believe it is the 
only acceptable one. Their choice is the old Fire Station 6, on Edgeware Road, 
taken out of service in 1987. They think the 1929 historic landmark can be 
expanded and brought up to seismic code for considerably less than it would 
cost to build new. They think it would mean something to the community. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons for the disagreement don't show on the map. The two sites are 
within walking distance of each other. Both are also on the western edge of 
downtown Los Angeles, making them closer to the Central Library, when it 
reopens, than to the next nearest branch library to the north. Both are remote 
from the geographical and social center of the Echo Park community, the busy 
intersection of Sunset Boulevard and Echo Park Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
What divides them is the Hollywood Freeway, which also divides the community. 
</P>
<P>
Temple Street, to its south, is a heavy commuter route, lined by a mix of 
crusty old buildings and newer storefronts. Most of its cross streets lead only 
south, the north being cut off by the freeway. And on many of those streets, 
block after block is now vacant, having been bought by developers and razed in 
preparation for a planned community called Central City West. 
</P>
<P>
The Friends contend that the new branch is being handed to the developers as an 
amenity for new neighborhoods of white-collar downtown workers. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the fire station stands in fairly pleasant surroundings a 
couple of blocks from the famous Victorian houses of Carroll Avenue and just 
around the corner from the lake that gives the community its name. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of years ago, the Friends produced 1,000 signatures on a petition 
promoting its conversion to a library. The politics leading up to tonight's 
meeting have grown quite bitter. Leaders of the Friends have accused the city 
bureaucracy of scheming to promote a private development. Library staff and the 
area's councilwoman, Gloria Molina, have intimated that the Friends are 
meddlesome and unrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
The commission convened last month at the current library, expecting to reach a 
decision. When the meeting exploded into disputes, the commissioners asked the 
library staff for more information. They asked for a re-evaluation of the fire 
station, an examination of other possible sites and a study of where the 
library's patrons live, all in a month. 
</P>
<P>
On re-examination, the fire station failed again, for the same reasons as 
before: The Fire Department wants to keep it for its disaster preparedness 
program and the cost of adaptation is an unknown. The most central of the 14 
sites investigated -- at Echo Park Avenue and Sunset Boulevard -- came back 
with the notation "Cost is prohibitive." 
</P>
<P>
Every site, it turned out, was defective in some similar way except the one at 
Temple and Patton. The main considerations were cost, square footage and access 
to cars. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing was said about tone, beauty or symbolic meaning to the community. Those 
values may simply be too intangible for the libraries department to handle. It 
is easier to appraise a piece of property than a community. As it was, the 
department was unable to determine where the patrons of the Echo Park Branch 
are concentrated. 
</P>
<P>
They tried to count cardholders by ZIP code area, but it turned out that the 
service area is almost all in a single area, said spokesman Robert Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight the commissioners have decided to meet at Plasencia Elementary School, 
which is right beside the site they seem destined to select.

"There is a contractor paid by the city to clean these sidewalks in the early 
morning, but Hollywood Boulevard has such heavy foot traffic, by 5 p.m. it is 
dirty again," said chamber President Larry Kaplan. 
</P>
<P>
Under the one-year pilot program, set to begin Feb. 3, local children and a 
supervising team of Conservation Corps adults will clean up the street after 
school. Besides picking up trash, volunteers will clean grafitti and start a 
recycling program. 
</P>
<P>
The Chamber of Commerce has donated $50,000 to the $135,000 program, with the 
rest coming from the corps. 
</P>
<P>
An inaugural demonstration for the program by Conservation Corps members will 
be held at 1:30 p.m. Friday at 6689 Hollywood Blvd.

$2,000 FOR GRAFFITI CLEANUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Westinghouse Foundation has donated $2,000 to help pay for graffiti cleanup 
along Fairfax Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The money was presented last week in response to an appeal by Vitalize Fairfax, 
a neighborhood group made up of area volunteer groups, developers and elected 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to do something that would benefit not just the merchants but the 
community at large," said Willie D. Hall, who presented the check on behalf of 
the foundation. Hall recently retired as director of community relations for 
the 7 Up-Royal Crown bottling companies, which are owned by Westinghouse.

REPAVING ON FAIRFAX AVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The commercial stretch of Fairfax Avenue between 3rd Street and Melrose Avenue 
is in for at least two months of traffic tie-ups because of street work. 
</P>
<P>
Workers repaving the avenue have cut the flow of traffic to one lane in each 
direction during daylight hours, but parking lanes should be available in the 
evenings and on weekends, a city official said. 
</P>
<P>
The street was last repaved "about 20 or 30 years ago," said Adina Solomon, a 
field deputy for City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky.

OMBUDSMAN STEERS HOMELESS TO SERVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Richard Walton had gotten through a moist, cold night at Venice Beach by 
rolling himself up in a carpet lining the stall of a boardwalk vendor. At 7:30 
a.m., he was awakened by someone shoving a piece of paper in his face. 
</P>
<P>
David Bryant handed Walton one of a stack of flyers that offered help. Bryant, 
42, works for the Mobile Ombudsman Program, a $110,000 project approved 
recently by the Los Angeles City Council to help link homeless people with 
services they may need. 
</P>
<P>
He takes to the streets of Venice at the crack of dawn each morning to talk to 
homeless people about how to get housing, food and employment. If they are 
interested, he drives them to a trailer parked on Venice Boulevard for coffee 
and a hand with wading through the red tape of getting public aid. For Walton, 
35, that meant getting needed medication. 
</P>
<P>
The trailer houses representatives from the Social Security Administration, the 
Veterans Administration, the Department of Mental Health and other agencies. 
Every month, it rolls to an area of the city that the council deems most needy. 
After a month at one site, it moves on to another area designated by the City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
The idea for the program was born two years ago when hundreds of homeless 
people camped out in tents on Venice Beach, prompting the city to set up two 
trailers at the Venice Pavilion to provide social services. The same type of 
program was tried at several sites around Los Angeles, including Van Nuys and 
Wilmington. It proved successful in luring homeless people, who more and more 
tend to be leery of "the system" that involves long lines at crowded offices 
and social workers who are often hard to reach. 
</P>
<P>
The trailer will be parked until Feb. 1 in a lot behind 685 N. Venice Blvd., 
sharing the space with two bright yellow-and-white striped tents for waiting 
clients and the staff's two vans. Most of the clients are homeless men and 
women who go to the beach and sleep in nearby parks. Many are disabled or 
mentally ill veterans, Huff said. 
</P>
<P>
A staff of 14 employees and four volunteers greet the men and women brought in 
by Bryant and his team, guiding them through the tedious process of determining 
what services they need, what they are eligible for, and where to obtain the 
help. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Velasco, 43, is an unemployed mechanic who said he had been living out of 
his van in Venice for 10 years. Velasco said he went to the trailer for help 
after someone gave him a flyer. 
</P>
<P>
He filed for benefits under a Social Security program and was directed to a 
downtown shelter, where he hopes to stay at least until he can make some 
repairs on his van. 
</P>
<P>
Once the paper work for services has been filled out at the Mobile Ombudsman 
trailer, volunteer drivers take clients to agency offices to complete the 
process. The transportation service is especially important to the homeless, 
who often lack the money or motivation to catch a bus or walk, said Chuck 
Sladky, the Mobile Ombudsman's intake coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
"When the homeless person wakes up in the morning, he has three questions in 
his mind: what he's going to eat that day, where he's going to sleep, and where 
to get change for his particular need, be it drugs or transportation," Sladky 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Sladky, 47, knows better than most what he is talking about, having been 
homeless for a time. When he got off the bus in Los Angeles from New Orleans, 
he was mugged and lost everything, Sladky said. After six months of 
homelessness, he became involved with homeless advocacy work. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the job is knowing the problems that the homeless face. For example, 
identification cards are often stolen on the streets. The lack of proper 
identification often keeps homeless people from getting the help they need, 
Sladky said. 
</P>
<P>
Getting a replacement is not all that easy. To get a California ID, one first 
needs the proper documents. A Social Security card is not too difficult; it 
usually means a wait of two or three weeks. But birth certificates are 
trickier. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to know where to write," Sladky said. "For some of the older people, 
records have been moved." It costs $10 to $25 to complete the search, a 
substantial amount for someone who is homeless and unemployed. The wait, the 
cost and complication of the search itself can be discouraging, Sladky said. 
Without help, many just give up. 
</P>
<P>
Lana Barretta was suffering from chronic bronchitis and had been on the streets 
for the last 10 days, but she wasn't eligible for shelter until she got an ID. 
She said she appreciated the help she was getting at the trailer. "A lot of 
these agencies are dehumanizing," she said.

3 TOWN COUNCIL MEMBERS TO SURRENDER SEATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three members of the Crescenta Valley Town Council will give up their seats in 
March after only one year in office, opening the way for new candidates who 
will file for election this week. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Anthony P. Hurtado and two alternates, William C. Bening and Joseph 
Grosch, said they will not seek reelection to the year-old council, a 
quasi-governmental committee that advises the Los Angeles County Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Elections will be held March 15 for six of the council's 12 positions. 
Candidates must file between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Friday or from 9 a.m. to noon 
Saturday at the Crescenta Valley Chamber of Commerce, 3131 Foothill Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
The council is comprised of 12 members: three members and an alternate from 
each of three census tracts in the Montrose and La Crescenta area. One council 
position from each tract plus all three alternate seats are up for reelection 
this year. After the election, all council members will serve two-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
Hurtado said he will step down to focus his attention on a long-term community 
plan that the council is developing. He said he will continue to serve as a 
volunteer on the community planning committee, of which he is chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Lousen, an alternate on the council from Hurtado's district, said he will 
seek election to the vacant post. As an alternate, Lousen now does not have the 
power to vote except when substituting in the absence of a regular member. 
</P>
<P>
Bening and Grosch, the other two alternates, said they will leave the council. 
</P>
<P>
Bening said he is frustrated by his lack of voting power. "I feel like I'm not 
necessary," Bening said. "I've got better things I want to do than sit around 
and wait around." 
</P>
<P>
Grosch said he is quitting because of personal reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Two other voting council members up for reelection, Judy Tejeda and Bill 
Beavers, said they will seek their first full terms in office. Tejeda and 
Beavers were elected to one-year terms in the first council election. 
</P>
<P>
Beavers ran for election last year on a campaign to halt the proliferation of 
billboards along the town's commercial strip. The council persuaded the county 
supervisors to temporarily halt construction of new billboards, but Beavers 
said he wants to continue working for a permanent ordinance that may eventually 
phase out existing billboards. 
</P>
<P>
Tejeda said she wants "to see some of the issues that we have started working 
on come to fruition." 
</P>
<P>
The council serves as the official voice of the isolated mountainside community 
of 21,000. Candidates will be introduced at the Feb. 15 Town Council meeting.

RENT BOARD IS DIVIDED ON FILLING VACANT SEAT; 
</P>
<P>
SANTA MONICA: AN ATTEMPT TO NAME A NEW MEMBER IS SET FOR TONIGHT. A STALEMATE 
MAY HAMPER BOARD BUSINESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Monica Rent Control Board will try again tonight to fill a vacant 
seat after the board members split their votes on all seven candidates 
nominated at a special meeting Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
With the board evenly divided -- Chairwoman Susan Packer Davis and board member 
Wayne Bauer on one side and board members Dolores Press and Eileen Lipson on 
the other -- and neither side apparently willing to budge, a new member may not 
be selected until the November municipal election, when three other seats are 
up for election. 
</P>
<P>
The seat became vacant when Julie Lopez Dad resigned Dec. 31. The City Charter 
requires that the five-member board appoint a replacement within 30 days of a 
resignation. However, the charter is silent on a procedure if the board fails 
to reach agreement on a candidate within the required time. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Trendacosta, the board's general counsel, is expected to present the 
board with a list of options tonight if no candidate receives three votes. 
</P>
<P>
It is unclear what options Trendacosta will present to the board, but one 
possible alternative would be to leave the seat vacant until the November 
election. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, Bauer and Lipson are up for reelection. Dad's seat also would be up for 
election even if the board appoints someone to fill it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's murky," Davis said of the effort to fill the seat vacated by Dad. "I 
don't see any hope for getting three votes for any candidate, frankly. Anyone 
we supported, they wouldn't support." 
</P>
<P>
If the seat is left unfilled until November, board business could be hampered 
until then because of the prospect of 2-2 votes on other major issues. Dad 
often sided with Davis and Bauer, on what were frequently 3-2 votes. 
</P>
<P>
"Policy decisions could be split right down the middle, major regulations could 
be split right down the middle and administrative decisions could be split 
right down the middle," Bauer said. "I think the only thing we may agree on are 
(rent dispute) decisions." 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's a distinct possibility," Press said. "Although I think 
philosophically we are all on the same wavelength and we share the same 
progressive principles." 
</P>
<P>
The deadlock centers around the board's controversial incentive housing 
program, which could also became the central issue in the November election. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the program -- which was adopted on a 3-2 vote in October -- say 
it is the only viable way to stop some landlords from evicting tenants under 
the state Ellis Act and going out of the rental business. The program allows 
landlords to raise the rents significantly on some units if they set aside an 
equal number of units at lower rents for poor people. 
</P>
<P>
Press and Lipson voted against the program. The city's largest landlord group, 
Action, and the city's largest tenant group, Santa Monica for Renters' Rights 
(SMRR), also opposed the program. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said she opposed the three candidates nominated by Press and Lipson 
because she believes none of them strongly supported the board's recently 
approved incentive housing program. 
</P>
<P>
"I stated publicly that I would not support anyone who wouldn't support the 
incentive housing program wholeheartedly," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
The three candidates supported by Press and Lipson were William Bradley (Brad) 
Jones, 34, a high school English teacher and co-chairman of SMRR; Marilyn 
Spivey, a 42-year-old trial attorney, and Lacy D. Goode, 61, a stock clerk with 
the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Press nor Lipson said at Monday's meeting why they opposed the four 
candidates nominated by Davis and Bauer. But in an interview Tuesday, Press 
said she would not support any candidate who blindly supported the program. 
</P>
<P>
"I was not prepared to make a commitment to someone who did not look at it 
objectively," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The four candidates supported by Davis and Bauer were Anthony J. Russo, a 
53-year-old retired scientist; Lisa Monk Borrino, 34, a tenants' rights 
attorney; Ellen Goldin, a 37-year-old consultant and community activist, and 
Fred Silberberg, 29, a family law attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Davis and Bauer charged that SMRR, credited with bringing rent control to Santa 
Monica 10 years ago by getting a slate of its candidate elected to the City 
Council, was behind the deadlock. 
</P>
<P>
"Rather than have an incumbent in the November election who supported the 
program, SMRR would rather we not appoint anyone until the election," Bauer 
said. "SMRR has become more interested in winning office than in getting a 
responsible housing program." 
</P>
<P>
SMRR officials deny the accusation. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it is so much a question of SMRR wanting an incumbent who 
supports the program, but Wayne and Susan attacking SMRR," said Davis, the SMRR 
co-chairman and a candidate for the board. "Unfortunately, Mr. Bauer feels that 
anybody who doesn't agree with him 100% is against low-income and affordable 
housing."

VENTURA TRAFFIC-LIGHT BILL GETS A GREEN LIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A state bill containing $250,000 to synchronize 40 traffic lights in Ventura 
cleared a hurdle this week as it passed through a major legislative committee. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, proposed by Assemblyman Byron Sher (D-Palo Alto), passed through the 
state Assembly Ways and Means Committee on a 12 to 9 vote, clearing the way for 
the measure to be heard next Tuesday on the assembly floor. 
</P>
<P>
If passed, funds would be used to connect the signals to a central computer 
system which monitors and adjusts traffic signal timings to handle rush-hour 
traffic and bottlenecks due to accidents. Most of the other 95 traffic signals 
in Ventura are synchronized through the system. 
</P>
<P>
Money to pay for the project would come from the state Petroleum Violation 
Escrow Account, which includes money collected from oil companies which 
violated federal oil price regulations during the 1970s.

FRED SANDS DROPS PLANS FOR LARCHMONT OFFICE; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: OPPOSITION FROM AREA RESIDENTS PROMPTS REAL ESTATE FIRM TO 
WITHDRAW FROM PROJECT. COUNCILMAN ALSO OPPOSED PLAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAY EVANS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Responding to a flurry of protests from area residents and business owners, 
real estate broker Fred Sands has decided not to participate in a joint project 
to build an office-retail complex in the Larchmont Village business district. 
</P>
<P>
Sands' withdrawal effectively kills the project. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the Larchmont Chronicle newspaper dated Tuesday, Sands wrote 
that he now agrees with area residents that the proposed two-story building 
with underground parking on Larchmont Boulevard is inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
"After reading . . . remarks (of) area residents (I) understand how they feel. 
This area should remain the quaint village that it is," Sands wrote. "Larchmont 
is not Century City, and should not become one." 
</P>
<P>
In a brief press release the same day, Los Angeles City Council President John 
Ferraro, whose district includes Larchmont, said the proposal was "not in the 
best interest of the community." He said he based his decision on a city 
Department of Transportation analysis of parking in the area. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal would have required city approval to go forward. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald A. Simms Commercial Development and a real estate purchasing subsidiary 
of Fred Sands Co. late last year had jointly proposed building the complex on 
the commercial stretch of Larchmont Boulevard just south of Beverly Boulevard. 
The complex would have replaced several existing shops and a city-owned surface 
parking lot. Sands planned to house offices on a second floor, leaving the 
ground level open to retail space. 
</P>
<P>
Sands officials said earlier this month that the project would not be 
economically feasible if it did not include the city-owned parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors and area business owners protested the proposal at a meeting of the 
Larchmont Boulevard Assn. earlier this month. At that meeting, residents 
complained that a recent intrusion of banks and real estate offices on the 
quaint, tree-lined strip was destroying the small-town flavor of the area. 
Larchmont has long been dominated by locally owned retail shops. 
</P>
<P>
Many also said that an existing three-level underground parking lot nearby goes 
largely unused by shoppers who prefer street-level parking. 
</P>
<P>
The residents and shop owners took their objections to Ferraro, presenting his 
office with petitions signed by hundreds of people opposed to the project. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the project were delighted with Sands' withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
"I am thrilled," said Daryl Trainor, owner of Village Catering Company on the 
strip. "This really shows that if we jump in and take action, we can have some 
say." 
</P>
<P>
Some residents were skeptical that Sands based his decision on the will of the 
local community. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe he had any choice," said Michael Cornwell, president of the 
Windsor Square Assn., a homeowners group. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe he saw the handwriting on the wall," Cornwell said, referring to 
Ferraro's opposition to the proposal.

COUNCIL SHUTS OFF WATER RATE INCREASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council, responding to charges of "artificially inflated" rates and 
soaring profits in the city's water division, Monday took the first step toward 
sharply lowering prices for consumers. 
</P>
<P>
The council directed city staff members to draft a resolution imposing sweeping 
changes on the city's water rate structure. The revisions, which require 
council approval, would slash profits of the water division by nearly $200,000 
this fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning March 1, rates of the division's 8,064 customers would be reduced by 
from 3.2% to 32%. 
</P>
<P>
The changes were a victory for the council-appointed citizens committee that 
studied the water system and last week issued a report sharply criticizing 
rate-setting methods. 
</P>
<P>
The committee recommended across-the-board cuts and the elimination of the 
city's four-zone system, in which residents at higher elevations pay more for 
their water. The council unanimously agreed on both points. Residents living at 
higher elevations would get the biggest rate cuts. 
</P>
<P>
"We've cut through a whole bunch of bureaucratic mumbo jumbo," said Councilman 
Gary Coffey, describing Monday's action as a milestone for the city. "The 
pricing structure before was (not understandable)." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Bob Low, who has called the rates "blind price gouging," said the water 
division's profits last year were unreasonable. In 1988-89, the division posted 
profits of $510,090, up from $52,083 the previous year and $8,014 the year 
before that. 
</P>
<P>
The council had approved rate increases in September. But members said Monday 
that they were unaware of the water division's skyrocketing profits until the 
council-appointed committee released its report last week. 
</P>
<P>
"We were told of increases in water and electricity rates," said Mayor Pro Tem 
Tom O'Leary. "If I had been advised of (the profits) I would have had more 
serious thoughts about raising the rates." 
</P>
<P>
Under the revised system, the division's profits this year would be $327,766, 
based on average annual sales of 7,100 acre-feet of water, committee member Don 
Chadwick said. One acre-foot equals about 326,000 gallons of water. 
</P>
<P>
Elimination of the four zones, coupled with reductions in the commodity rate 
charged for water and the cost of pumping it, will result in savings for the 
average consumer of $1.31 to $31.98 per two-month billing, according to the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, water bills are partly based on a commodity rate that varies from 75 
cents to $1.20 per 100 cubic feet of water used. The new flat rate approved by 
the council Monday would be 68 cents per 100 cubic feet. One hundred cubic feet 
equals 750 gallons of water. 
</P>
<P>
Although Councilman Henry Morgan voted for the changes, he later expressed 
reservations. 
</P>
<P>
"To reduce our earning power by that much doesn't make good business sense," he 
said. "We can use all the money we can get legitimately. Some main (water) line 
will blow and we won't have a major reserve" to fix it. 
</P>
<P>
As of June last year the water division had cash reserves of about $736,000, 
city Finance Director Stan McCartney said. 
</P>
<P>
O'Leary countered that because the city's water customers have no choice in 
selecting a utility, the city should not seek huge profits. "I have a problem 
with making money off an essential city service," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The council also said it would assume direct responsibility for all water-rate 
adjustments under a 1987 rate-setting resolution. Such power now rests with the 
city manager, who recommends rate increases or decreases, which then usually 
are routinely approved by the council. 
</P>
<P>
However, the council steered clear of discussing one of the biggest complaints 
in the citizens committee report: that city officials were "artificially 
inflating" water rates by improperly using both the consumer price index and 
water-electricity costs to justify increases. 
</P>
<P>
The 1987 resolution passed by the council said officials could use one or the 
other: "The city manager is authorized to automatically increase the rates 
based on the annual increase in the consumer price index or the periodic 
increase in water or electricity costs." 
</P>
<P>
The city acted "contrary to the resolution's specific language" by considering 
both factors in calculating rate increases in 1988 and 1989, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Low and O'Leary said officials in the future will follow the letter of the law. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though the language could have been misinterpreted, it was not 
intentional," said O'Leary, who joined the council in 1988. "Certainly it will 
be or from now on." 
</P>
<P>
But others, including Morgan and City Atty. Charles Vose, said the council's 
original intent in passing the law was to allow the city manager to use both 
factors. 
</P>
<P>
The council is scheduled to vote on the package of rate changes when the 
resolution is presented Feb. 12.

DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ATWATER MEN TO STAND TRIAL FOR BAR KILLINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two brothers accused of killing two men and wounding a third in a Glendale 
tavern last November have been ordered to stand trial on murder and conspiracy 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
After four days of testimony by a dozen witnesses, including a victim of the 
Nov. 24 incident, Glendale Municipal Judge Charles Horan ruled Monday there was 
sufficient evidence to bring Rodolfo Marquez, 21, and Manuel Marquez, 25, to 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
The two brothers from Atwater are each charged with two counts of murder, one 
count of attempted murder and one count of conspiracy to attempt murder for a 
shooting at the Rustic Inn on San Fernando Road. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, they could be sentenced to death or life in prison without 
parole, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Patty Shrader. The death penalty may be invoked 
for a murder conviction if more than one person is killed. 
</P>
<P>
A third man, Constancio Villagrana, 25, of Bell, faces one count of conspiracy 
to commit murder. He could be sentenced to 25 years to life in prison if 
convicted, Shrader said. The three will be arraigned Feb. 6 in Pasadena 
Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said they believe the men left the tavern after being in a 
fistfight, then returned about 30 minutes later. They say Rodolfo Marquez, 
accompanied by Villagrana and armed with a gun Manuel Marquez had given him, 
entered the bar and began shooting, while Manuel Marquez waited in a getaway 
truck outside. 
</P>
<P>
Oscar Lemus, 34, of Los Angeles and Jose Davila, 33, of Glendale were killed, 
and Javier Maldonado, 48, of Los Angeles, was wounded.

WEST COVINA'S CLYDE JORDAN LETS ACTIONS ON THE COURT SPEAK FOR HIM; 
</P>
<P>
PREP BASKETBALL: THE HEAVILY-RECRUITED POINT GUARD AVERAGES 18 POINTS A GAME 
AND 10 REBOUNDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MITCH POLIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since he arrived in high school as a freshman, West Covina point guard Clyde 
Jordan has never been one to talk a good game. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he is one of the least talkative players on the basketball team. Coach 
Ed Coyle describes him as shy and introverted. 
</P>
<P>
But on the court, the 17-year-old senior does not have to say much to make his 
presence felt. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm more of a leader on the court," Jordan says. "I don't like to talk too 
much except when I really need to -- like when we're losing. Then I might say 
something." 
</P>
<P>
At 6-6 and a lean 175 pounds, Jordan has always let his actions speak louder 
than words. 
</P>
<P>
"He's one of those players who just leads by his ability," Coyle said. "He's 
not a vocal player, but we all know he's there." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, it is difficult to ignore a 6-6 point guard who averages 18 points, 
10 rebounds and five assists a game. 
</P>
<P>
Coyle said it is Jordan's all-around offensive skills that make him such a 
valuable asset to the Bulldogs, who are in first place in the Sierra League 
with a 14-5 overall record and are ranked No. 10 in the CIF Southern Section 
5-A Division. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a player who can do a lot of things for you," Coyle said. "As a guard you 
have to have a lot of versatility, and he has that. He just makes things 
happen. He's very good at getting us into our offense." 
</P>
<P>
In his three years of varsity basketball, Jordan has never led the team in 
scoring. Forward Sherrod Belton leads the Bulldogs this season with a 
21.8-point average and West Covina has two other players who are scoring in 
double figures. 
</P>
<P>
"Talentwise, he stands out quite a bit, but it's not like he's trying to do it 
all by himself," Coyle said. "We have other players who can carry the load, 
too." 
</P>
<P>
For that matter, Jordan says, scoring points has not always been his prime 
objective. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to be more of an all-around player," he said. "It doesn't bother me not 
to score all the time." 
</P>
<P>
It is not Jordan's scoring ability that has made him one of the top college 
prospects in the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a very good perimeter shooter and a good penetrator," Coyle said. "But I 
think what makes him so valuable is his passing. He makes some great passing 
decisions, especially on fast breaks. 
</P>
<P>
"He's getting highly recruited because he's a 6-6 guard and an excellent 
passer. He can throw the long pass as well as anyone I've seen at this level." 
</P>
<P>
Recruiters also like the fact that Jordan is not restricted to playing point 
guard in college. Coyle said Jordan can play any number of positions in 
college. 
</P>
<P>
"It just depends on which system the college runs," Coyle said. "He can fill a 
lot of roles. That's just another thing colleges like. He can play either point 
guard, shooting guard or small forward in college. But he just needs to have 
the ball in his hands to be productive." 
</P>
<P>
Jordan has played every position since he started playing youth basketball in 
the fourth grade, when he was a center. 
</P>
<P>
"Back then I was taller than everybody else," he recalled. "So when I was in 
elementary school I was the center. But that was only because of my size." 
</P>
<P>
When Jordan played at West Covina as a freshman on the junior varsity team, it 
was as a forward. He was a shooting guard on the varsity until he made the move 
to point guard toward the end of last season. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever position he has played in high school, it has always been as a 
starter. 
</P>
<P>
"As a freshman, I knew he was going to be a pretty good player," Coyle said. 
"Then as a sophomore he did a really good job for us. He fit right in at the 
three spot (small forward)." 
</P>
<P>
Jordan averaged 4.9 points and four rebounds as a sophomore and 16 points and 
10 rebounds as a junior, when he earned All-Sierra League honors. 
</P>
<P>
Not that Jordan didn't have doubts about himself when he started playing in 
high school. 
</P>
<P>
"It was mostly my dribbling and ball handling," Jordan said. "I wasn't too hot 
with the ball back then. I think I'm better all-around now. I'm more 
comfortable with myself." 
</P>
<P>
Coyle said Jordan can still stand to make improvements in areas of his game. 
</P>
<P>
"He's going to have to work on his quickness," he said. "He's not real quick on 
his feet but he has such long arms. That makes a big difference. He also needs 
to improve on his defense. That's his biggest weakness. 
</P>
<P>
"But he has excellent offensive skills. Offensively, I'm very pleased with what 
he's done, what he's doing and what he's going to do." 
</P>
<P>
At this point, college recruiters appear to be more than willing to overlook 
any weaknesses that Jordan might have as a player. 
</P>
<P>
He said he has been recruited by numerous NCAA Division I programs but the 
schools that seem most interested at the moment are Oregon, Oregon State, 
Kansas and Cal State Fullerton. He said he has been recruited as both a shooter 
and a point guard. 
</P>
<P>
As a senior, he said, the attention he has received from college recruiters has 
risen considerably, although it has not been as difficult for him lately. 
</P>
<P>
"It's slowed down a lot," Jordan said. "It used to be a lot more but I told 
them (recruiters) to call me only on certain days and not on school days 
because I have schoolwork and other things I have to do." 
</P>
<P>
For the moment, Jordan said he is trying to keep the constant attention of 
recruiters in perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't really bother me," he said. "I just do what I have to do and I'll 
worry about it when the time comes." 
</P>
<P>
Jordan is more concerned about helping the Bulldogs win the Sierra League title 
and reach the Southern Section playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
He has bad memories of post-season play the last two years when his team was 
eliminated in the first round. Two seasons ago, he played at Edgewood -- the 
last season before the school merged with cross-town rival West Covina -- and 
his team suffered a 72-69 loss to Bloomington in the first round of the 2-A 
playoffs. Last season at West Covina, it was a 68-60 setback to Indio in the 
opening round of the 5-A playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the second time in a row that happened to me," Jordan said. "We don't 
want that to happen again this year. We want to win the league title and go 
from there." 
</P>
<P>
That is one subject that Jordan doesn't mind talking about.

CALABASAS DEAL WITH DEVELOPER ENHANCES CITYHOOD BID; 
</P>
<P>
INCORPORATION: A DELICATE COMPROMISE HAS BEEN MADE WITH A CONTROVERSIAL BUILDER 
WHO HAS AGREED TO SUPPORT PLANS TO ESTABLISH A CITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In what was called a "delicate compromise agreement," a Calabasas Park 
homeowners group voted Tuesday to accept a controversial subdivision by a 
developer who was blamed for torpedoing a failed Calabasas cityhood drive 
almost two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
In return, the developer, Jim Baldwin, agreed to support a renewed drive by 
residents to establish a city. 
</P>
<P>
More than 300 members of the Calabasas Park Homeowners Assn. agreed to 
Baldwin's offer to reduce the density of the proposed 1,487-house tract by 
nearly two-thirds to a maximum of 550 homes. 
</P>
<P>
However, leaders of the group said the vote was not an endorsement of the 
project, but merely a device to remove Baldwin's opposition to a new 
incorporation effort. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the best we can get in terms of making a delicate compromise 
agreement," said Bob Ronka, a member of the association's board. "We now have a 
delicate balance, with large portions in our favor." He said the group's 
decision removed a major obstacle in a new drive for cityhood. 
</P>
<P>
Baldwin's property is in the hilly western half of Calabasas Park. 
</P>
<P>
The builder took legal steps to prevent his property from being included in the 
proposed city of Calabasas in the first campaign 23 months ago. Along with 
owners of other undeveloped property in the area, he did not want to be subject 
to the whims of a city council and laws that had yet to be determined, said 
Robert Burns, Baldwin's Calabasas project manager. 
</P>
<P>
Baldwin's sister -- saying she was acting only as an "interested citizen" 
safeguarding county funds -- sued to block county funding of brush-fire 
protection within the proposed city limits if incorporation occurred. Because 
the suit cast doubt on that revenue source for a future city, the Los Angeles 
County Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) rejected the cityhood 
application as financially unfeasible. 
</P>
<P>
After the rejection, angry Calabasas homeowners increased their opposition to a 
change in the county master plan, sought by Baldwin to allow him to construct 
1,487 houses. The master plan called for a maximum of 138 houses on the rugged 
site. 
</P>
<P>
The opponents negotiated an agreement over several months, and reached a 
compromise last month, members of both sides said. In exchange for the 
homeowners' vote and the earlier endorsement of the Calabasas Cityhood 
Committee, Baldwin has agreed to lobby LAFCO in support of the committee's 
drive for incorporation. 
</P>
<P>
The vote comes on the heels of a decision by the Santa Monica Mountains 
Conservancy to purchase almost half of the 1,209 acres Baldwin owns for 
preservation as wildlife habitat. Calabasas residents had been concerned about 
preserving open space, and said they wanted a government agency to ensure that 
open space would not be eliminated from the project.

COUNTY OFFICIAL-CONSULTANT LINK REVEALED;

DEVELOPMENT: VENTURA COUNTY OFFICIALS LEARN ABOUT A POTENTIAL CONFLICT OF 
INTEREST AFTER HIRING A CONSULTANT TO PREPARE ENVIRONMENTAL REPORTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura County Board of Supervisors, which is reviewing two large and 
controversial development proposals, learned of a potential conflict of 
interest involving the projects' environmental studies only after a 
half-million-dollar contract for the studies had been awarded. 
</P>
<P>
County officials ultimately determined that the potential conflict was 
inconsequential, but two of five county supervisors and a lawyer for one of the 
developers said they would have liked to know about it earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors awarded the contract for an environmental impact 
report on the Ahmanson Ranch and Jordan Ranch developments to McClelland 
Consultants (West) on Sept. 5, 1989, at a fee not to exceed $447,582. The 
contract was approved on a 3-2 vote, with Supervisors Susan Lacey and John 
Flynn opposed to the study. 
</P>
<P>
Several county officials and a spokesman for the consultant said the study's 
integrity was not compromised by the relationship of John Crowley, deputy 
director of the county Department of Public Works, and his wife, Julie Bulla, 
McClelland's project manager. They said that Crowley would not review 
McClelland's work and that they saw no conflict because Bulla's firm had been 
hired by the county and not the developers. 
</P>
<P>
A month after the contract was awarded, Bulla's and Crowley's relationship was 
noted in a memo from Robert Braitman, county manager of government 
organizations, to Richard Wittenberg, county chief administrator. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors were subsequently told about the matter in individual memos. A 
majority, including eastern Ventura County representative Madge Schaefer, said 
they were not concerned. They said they considered both Crowley and Bulla, a 
former county employee, to be well-respected professionals. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor James Dougherty said he didn't like the lack of immediate 
disclosure, although he was unconcerned about the spouses themselves. He 
attributed the late disclosure to "bureaucracy," not "mischievousness." 
</P>
<P>
Some community activists criticized the lack of public disclosure. 
</P>
<P>
"In view of the obvious controversy involved in this project, any such action 
not reviewed in public assumes an influence-peddling kind of situation," said 
Margot Feuer of the Save the Mountain Park Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley Cohen, an Oxnard attorney representing the Jordan Ranch developers, 
said the public's perception was precisely what concerned his client, Potomac 
Investment Associates. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Berg, county director of resource management, and Arthur Goulet, public 
works director, said Crowley's staff would review the EIR, not Crowley himself. 
They also said they considered the issue moot because Bulla was recently 
replaced as supervisor of the study, although she is still working on the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Under current plans, the developments would add more than 4,000 homes, two golf 
courses and two commercial centers to the largely undeveloped eastern end of 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
The projects have generated concern in both Ventura and Los Angeles counties 
because of their anticipated effects on traffic, wildlife and municipal 
services. 
</P>
<P>
Because of their size and proximity, the projects' environmental effects are 
being studied together. The environmental impact report is expected to be 
available for public review sometime this spring.

COMPETING BECOMES ITS OWN REWARD; 
</P>
<P>
WOMEN: BASKETBALL PLAYERS AT VENTURA AND OXNARD COLLEGES MAKE UNCOMMON 
SACRIFICES TO BE PART OF A TEAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Ventura College women's basketball Coach George Valenzuela blows the first 
whistle at practice each weekday morning, most of his players quickly wipe the 
sleep out of their eyes. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Valenzuela usually cracks a few yawns himself as he gets his vocal 
cords in yelling-drill form. 
</P>
<P>
It's not easy to start practice at 6 a.m., but playing junior college women's 
basketball requires sacrifices. 
</P>
<P>
At least Ventura gets to practice in its own gymnasium. At Oxnard College, the 
women's team is forced to practice and play all of its home games at Santa 
Clara High because the college has no indoor basketball court. 
</P>
<P>
The Oxnard women, however, have the luxury of practicing at 7 p.m. "But that's 
only when there's no conflict with any of the high school teams," Coach Dan 
Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the ongoing inconveniences, players and coaches of both teams insist 
they wouldn't have it any other way. 
</P>
<P>
"The one factor we all have in common is that we've been part of a winning 
program in the past and want to continue that," said Valenzuela, a former 
girls' basketball coach at Rio Mesa High who still teaches there. "A lot of the 
girls hope this will be a steppingstone to a four-year program." 
</P>
<P>
The road to a university is a difficult jaunt, especially for the players at 
Ventura and Oxnard. Athletes must shuffle odd practice schedules with classes 
and part-time jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Games are held as far as Bakersfield and San Diego, which adds to the time 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
There are no scholarships, and every member of both teams holds down a job to 
help cover expenses. To maintain eligibility, athletes must take at least 12 
hours a semester and maintain a 'C' average. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura players start their days with practice, attend classes in the morning 
and work in the afternoon. Evenings are reserved for studying. With games on 
Wednesdays and Saturdays, free time is at a premium. 
</P>
<P>
The only difference for Oxnard's players is that practice is at night. They 
must use the early morning hours for extra study time. 
</P>
<P>
The coaches' schedules are typical of the hardships experienced on the junior 
college level. Valenzuela, a single parent, has beaten a path between Ventura 
and Rio Mesa High. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard's Campbell starts his days at 7 a.m. at his job with the Ventura County 
Sheriff's Department. He usually gets home at 10 or 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"Now you have to put more effort into fitting everyone into practice," said 
Campbell, a former girls' coach at Camarillo High. "There are a lot of 
schedules to coordinate. I also have to coordinate with Santa Clara's teams, so 
there is a lot to juggle. If there is a conflict, we're always low on the totem 
pole. 
</P>
<P>
"But getting motivated is never a problem. The thrill of playing basketball on 
a higher level is what inspires all of us. Intrinsically, the people on our 
team are competitive. If we weren't going out for basketball, it would be 
another sport. We have to be competing. 
</P>
<P>
"But certainly with the sacrifices that must be made, it takes a special type 
of person." 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line is competing, with the slim hope of landing a scholarship to a 
major college. Neither Valenzuela or Campbell has sent a player beyond the 
junior college ranks since they took over their respective programs three years 
ago. But that may be changing. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura is battling for the Western State Conference championship this season, 
thanks in part to the play of 6-foot-3 center Chris Royers. 
</P>
<P>
Royers, a sophomore, is averaging 16 points and 20 rebounds a game. She set a 
school record of 29 rebounds in a game earlier this season. 
</P>
<P>
Her play and size have attracted interest from the University of Oklahoma, Long 
Beach State and the University of San Francisco, among others. 
</P>
<P>
The attention is amazing, considering Royers played sparingly while she 
attended Buena High. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone in high school said that I was just a big girl who was 
uncoordinated," Royers said. "But I've matured and gotten a lot stronger at 
Ventura. I have a lot more confidence now. I'm no longer a bench warmer." 
</P>
<P>
Royers recently wrecked her car, so she must walk or ride her bicycle to 
practice two miles each morning. 
</P>
<P>
But she said she loves being on the court just after dawn. 
</P>
<P>
Teammate Ytteb Bowls lives in Oxnard, so she must allow extra traveling time to 
make the early morning workouts. 
</P>
<P>
"I love waking up that early," said Bowls, a 5-9 freshman forward from Channel 
Islands High. "It gets you energized for the rest of the day." 
</P>
<P>
Bowls had scholarship offers to the University of Delaware and Southwest Texas, 
but decided to attend a junior college and see if she could attract an offer 
closer to home. 
</P>
<P>
She should attract plenty of offers if she plays like she did in last week's 
82-69 upset win over Moorpark, when she scored a season-high 16 points. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard sophomore Tami Cleaver will probably end her basketball career at the 
end of the season, but she said the two extra years have been well worth the 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
She feels this way despite the fact that the Condors are 0-5 in the conference 
and 5-13 overall. 
</P>
<P>
"It was my own ambition to keep playing and to stay in shape," said Cleaver, 
who attended Oxnard High. "It's been a sacrifice, especially because I have 
really dedicated myself to the team. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's a sacrifice I've enjoyed. I didn't mind it a bit."

AZTECS ARE BULLISH ABOUT DOW; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE BASKETBALL: OK, SO HE'S NOT SO HOT IN A COW PASTURE. THE 7-FOOT-1 
CENTER HAS HAD A BIG IMPACT ON THE COURT FOR SAN DIEGO STATE.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was late at night. They were out in the middle of some field, shrouded in 
darkness and surrounded by mystery. 
</P>
<P>
There was mooing. 
</P>
<P>
Six months later, 7-foot-1 Marty Dow would be playing center for the San Diego 
State University basketball team. On this night last year, though, he was on an 
outing. A few friends had dragged him out to the pastures for a night of 
cow-tipping. 
</P>
<P>
"I just stood there and watched," Dow said. "I was too scared. They had done it 
before." 
</P>
<P>
His friends spied a sleeping cow. They snuck up on it and pushed. Tip, thud, 
chuckle. The cow hit the ground, mooed and got back up. 
</P>
<P>
"They always told me they went cow-tipping," Dow said. "I never believed them." 
</P>
<P>
An easy grin crossed Dow's face. He shifted in his chair. 
</P>
<P>
Ah, memories. 
</P>
<P>
When you're a basketball player, you play basketball. You go wherever you can 
find a team, wherever there is a position open. And when you get there, 
sometimes you find yourself doing zany things with the locals. 
</P>
<P>
The bouncing ball has taken Dow from high school in Aurora, Colo., to the 
University of Cincinnati, Northeastern Oklahoma A&amp;M and, finally, to SDSU. 
Dow has been a pleasant surprise for the Aztecs this season, stepping into the 
starting lineup immediately and improving each week. He has started all 19 
games, averaging 12.1 points and six rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
The interesting thing about those numbers is that they are more impressive than 
his statistics last season at Northeastern Oklahoma A&amp;M. There, for the 
national community college champions, he scored 8.3 points a game and also 
averaged six rebounds. He didn't start. It was a guard-oriented offense, and 
Dow had to be content watching shorter guys toss up rainbows from the outside. 
The Norsemen went 36-4. 
</P>
<P>
When the season ended, Dow went cow-tipping. What else was there to do? Shoot, 
there were about 15,000 people in Miami, Okla. And there were only about 1,500 
students at Northeastern Oklahoma A&amp;M. 
</P>
<P>
"It was different," Dow said. "The school had its own farm. You're an athlete, 
or you're an aggie. That was pretty much it." 
</P>
<P>
He made some friends. They saw a few movies at the local theater; the movies 
had been released three or four months earlier, but they were only a buck. 
</P>
<P>
Dow and his friends also played a lot of cards. 
</P>
<P>
When you're a basketball player, you go where you can find a team. 
</P>
<P>
His first college stop was Cincinnati, but there were problems between Dow and 
Tony Yates, then the team's coach. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think I was really getting along with the coach very well," is all 
Dow will say on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
He got some garbage time during his freshman season there and then was 
red-shirted during his sophomore season. He left midway through his second 
year, after calling an old friend of the family: Jim Brandenburg. 
</P>
<P>
Dow's high school teams had attended some of Brandenburg's basketball camps 
when Brandenburg was the coach at Wyoming. Brandenburg, in fact, recruited Dow 
but lost out when Cincinnati made a late push before the fall early-signing 
date during Dow's senior season. 
</P>
<P>
So when things didn't work out at Cincinnati, Dow called Brandenburg, who by 
this time had accepted the coaching job at SDSU. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he didn't have any scholarships left and that it would be pretty 
expensive to pay my own way," Dow said. "He said he would see what he could do 
about helping me find a junior college for a year." 
</P>
<P>
So Dow packed his bags and took off for Northeastern Oklahoma A&amp;M. A year 
later, faced with the loss of center Mitch McMullen, Brandenburg had a position 
and a scholarship, and Dow moved again. When you're 7-1 with a good work ethic 
and a pair of nice, soft hands to shoot the basketball, you can generally find 
a place to play. 
</P>
<P>
Although his height is one of his attributes, it was about as welcome as an 
outbreak of measles when it first snuck up on him. He started summer vacation 
at the end of his freshman year in high school at 6-feet. By the time he 
stepped through the front door to return for his sophomore year, he was 6-7. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to bother me a lot," he said. "I had a real problem with it in high 
school. They made fun of me, and I was real gangly. I couldn't walk and chew 
gum at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, I love it. I wouldn't change anything." 
</P>
<P>
Dow, a junior, has surprised quite a few people this season. He has outplayed 
Villanova's 7-3 center Tom Greis twice, and he out-rebounded New Mexico's 7-2 
Luc Longley last week. 
</P>
<P>
The first game against Greis was the Aztecs' season-opener in the Maui Classic, 
and that was the real shocker. Dow had 15 points and six rebounds. Greis had 14 
and three. 
</P>
<P>
"He kicked Greis' rear end," Brandenburg said. "From there, I thought, 'Maybe 
this kid is a gamer.' He works hard in practice, but he takes it to another 
level in games." 
</P>
<P>
The second game against Villanova was for the championship of the annual SDSU 
holiday tournament and broadcast nationally on ESPN. It was the first time 
Dow's father, an Episcopalian minister, and mother were able to watch him on 
television. Dow had 11 points and five rebounds, and Greis had five and six. 
</P>
<P>
Last week against New Mexico, Dow out-rebounded Longley, 11-7, but Longley had 
22 points and Dow had 13. 
</P>
<P>
Since Western Athletic Conference play started Jan. 4, Dow has led the Aztecs 
in scoring (15 points a game) and rebounding (6.3). He is shooting 64% from the 
field in WAC games (52.5% overall), which is good for third in the conference. 
He has scored in double figures in each of the past five games. 
</P>
<P>
"He has played a lot of good minutes for us in the last 10 or 12 games," 
Brandenburg said. "I think he's more confident. I've been very pleased with his 
progress. I think he's getting better all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Dow said he would like to improve his defense. That will come with hard work 
and, maybe, a little more weight. Right now, he is a reed-thin 240 pounds. He 
hasn't lifted many weights since a back injury in September, but he has 
promised himself to start as soon as the season has finished. 
</P>
<P>
"He needs to put on some solid muscle this summer and fall," Brandenburg said. 
"I can see where he could be a nice force in this conference next year."

CHARGERS MAKE, PONDER COACHING STAFF CHANGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Charger coaching staff is going through its first shakeup under Coach Dan 
Henning, and at least one move being considered is not his idea. 
</P>
<P>
It was announced Wednesday that Larry Pasquale, special teams coach of the New 
York Jets, will replace Joe Madden in the same position with the Chargers. 
Madden, whose kicking and kick-return teams were plagued by a series of miscues 
last season, will be reassigned as an administrative assistant. 
</P>
<P>
Henning said he agreed with that decision. But the next move would be the work 
of Bobby Beathard, the Chargers' new general manager, Henning said. 
</P>
<P>
Henning said Beathard wants to replace Larry Beightol, offensive line coach. 
Henning said he does not think that is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"Larry Beightol is a fine offensive line coach," Henning said. "Bobby wants to 
start fresh in certain areas. We don't completely agree on all of that. But 
this is an area he wants me to consider making a change, and I am considering 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Henning said it was at Beathard's suggestion that Alex Gibbs, the Raiders' 
offensive line coach, was interviewed Wednesday as a possible replacement for 
Beightol. Gibbs is the last remaining appointee of former Raider Coach Mike 
Shanahan. 
</P>
<P>
Gibbs previously was interviewed by the Atlanta Falcons and might interview 
with one other team, Henning said. No final decision has been made with regard 
to hiring Gibbs or replacing Beightol, Henning said. 
</P>
<P>
Beathard could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Madden and Beightol were two of three assistants who were also with Henning 
when he was coach of the Falcons in 1983-86. When he was named Charger coach in 
February, Henning brought with him four assistants -- Madden, Beightol, Ted 
Tollner (quarterbacks) and Ed White (tight ends). The rest of the staff was 
made up of holdovers from Al Saunders -- including offensive backs coach Bobby 
Jackson, who was also on Henning's Falcon staff -- or promotions within the 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
Henning said that while he might disagree with Beathard, with whom he served in 
Washington when he was an assistant coach and Beathard was general manager, he 
is open to suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
"We have tried to work together to come up with total organizational changes 
that will best befit the team," Henning said. "Everyone is working to try to do 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Henning said he sought out Pasquale earlier this month when Pasquale became 
available after the firing of Jet Coach Joe Walton. 
</P>
<P>
Pasquale, 48, begins his duties with the Chargers Feb. 1. He has 11 seasons of 
NFL experience, the past 10 with the Jets after one season with Detroit. He 
joined the Jets as receivers coach in 1980 and moved to special teams the next 
season. The Jets led the NFL in punt coverage from 1986-88 and in kickoff 
returns in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a first-class guy, and we felt if we wanted to make a change, we wanted 
to get the best," Henning said. 
</P>
<P>
Madden, 54, was hired by the Chargers last February after three years away from 
football. His most recent NFL job had been as administrative assistant to 
Henning in Atlanta in 1985-86. He previously was the special teams coach at 
Detroit from 1980-84, where he succeeded Pasquale. 
</P>
<P>
Henning defended Madden, saying some special teams problems were because of 
personnel. 
</P>
<P>
"During the course of the year, we started out poorly, settled down and then 
had an up-and-down-type performance," Henning said. "I don't think it's all the 
coaching." 
</P>
<P>
The suggested coaching changes are not all Beathard has been doing. He is 
continuing to build a staff with people who were with him in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Daniels, Redskin director of player personnel, was to have arrived in San 
Diego Wednesday night for a meeting today about a job as assistant general 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
Daniels, 45, is in his 12th year with the Redskins and first worked for 
Beathard as a scout when Beathard was director of player personnel in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Marty Hurney, Washington's director of public relations, interviewed 
for a job as an administrative assistant. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers have not made an announcement concerning either because both must 
clear obligations with the Redskins, a Charger spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
They would join Bill Devaney, a college scout with Washington who Tuesday was 
named Charger director of player personnel.

The San Diego Unified Port District has agreed to a request by the America's 
Cup Organizing Committee to identify waterfront sites for 20 syndicates in a 
1992 defense, pending a decision by the New York Court of Appeals on whether or 
not the San Diego Yacht Club will keep the Cup. 
</P>
<P>
The district also allocated $125,000 to start planning an international regatta 
in May 1992. 
</P>
<P>
By locating sites for syndicates from a record 15 countries expected to be 
entered in America's Cup XXVIII, organizers say they'll be ready to meet the 
rush for waterfront space if a New York appellate court ruling expected this 
spring keeps the trophy with the San Diego Yacht Club. 
</P>
<P>
The appeal by New Zealand's Mercury Bay Boating Club contends San Diego's 
unprecedented America's Cup use of a catamaran defender to beat Michael Fay's 
monohulled sloop off San Diego in 1988 was illegal under century-old rules of 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
A Feb. 8 hearing on the matter is scheduled before the New York Court of 
Appeals, that state's highest court. A ruling is expected in March. 
</P>
<P>
The ACOC said it has 14 solid and nine potential entries from challengers -- 
the difference being those that have paid the $25,000 fee. 
</P>
<P>
ACOC officials requested the Port District study partly because of logistical 
problem posed by the new International America's Cup Class yachts that will be 
used in the next regatta. 
</P>
<P>
Hulls of those 75-foot boats extend about 13 feet below the water. Most docks 
in San Diego Bay are too shallow to accommodate IACC yachts, and those where 
the water is deep enough are so far from Pacific Ocean race sites that it would 
put those syndicates at a competitive disadvantage.

CAL LUTHERAN PRESIDENT DISPUTES SHOUP CLAIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRENDAN HEALEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After weeks of public silence on the issue, Cal Lutheran President Jerry Miller 
spoke out Wednesday on Bob Shoup's dismissal as football coach, disputing 
Shoup's claim that he was guaranteed lifetime job security by a former 
president. 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing in the records that indicates tenure was ever given for the 
position of coach," said Miller, who previously had restricted his comments 
because a grievance by Shoup was in progress. Denial of the grievance was 
upheld Monday by the executive committee of the university's Board of Regents. 
</P>
<P>
Shoup has produced notarized documents by former President Maurice Knutson and 
Jack Woudenberg, a former regent, stating that after Cal Lutheran won the NAIA 
football championship in 1971 Knutson offered Shoup lifetime security as 
football coach. 
</P>
<P>
"There also is an indication in the record of the Board of Regents in . . . 
October, 1971, that no additional tenure arrangements would be rendered for any 
employees for a year," Miller said. However, Knutson claims that soon 
thereafter he offered Shoup tenure as football coach, "which would seem to be a 
contradiction," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
In his statement, Knutson said that, because of the university's dire financial 
situation at the time, he was granted powers by Lutheran church officials that 
superseded those of the Board of Regents. Miller said Shoup told him in August 
that former university presidents had promised him tenure as football coach. "I 
talked to two former presidents (Mark Mathews and Raymond Olson), and they knew 
of no such commitment," said Miller, who did not ask Knutson. 
</P>
<P>
Shoup said he disagrees with Miller's interpretation of that conversation. 
"What I told him was that each president at Cal Lutheran had added to what is 
now my current contract," Shoup said. 
</P>
<P>
Miller also said there had been "no deal struck" with members of the Southern 
California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference regarding Shoup's job as coach. 
</P>
<P>
On May 3, Miller announced at a meeting of the conference that the 1989 
football season would be Shoup's last as coach, a declaration that preceded the 
university's Aug. 8 public announcement of Shoup's dismissal. Miller said the 
SCIAC simply was informed about an agreement Shoup had reached with the 
university earlier in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
"The discussions that initially indicated that Shoup would not be returning as 
football coach after the 1989 season occurred in February and March," Miller 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Shoup said he did not know his coaching future when he signed his '89-90 
contract "under duress." 
</P>
<P>
Shoup also had been disgruntled over losing supplemental income for the summer 
of 1989. Miller said that because CLU decided in October, 1988, to stop 
recruiting off campus and offering scholarships in implementing the move to the 
SCIAC, Shoup's duties no longer necessitated a supplemental contract .

CLARK SCORES 37 TO HELP CANYONS ROUT FAVORED MOORPARK, 108-87 
</P>

<P>
Aaron Clark, Canyons' 6-foot-3 off guard-turned-center, displayed a split 
personality Wednesday night at Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
Clark was Mr. Inside and Mr. Outside as he scored 37 points with a combination 
of power moves in the lane and outside sharpshooting, including three 
three-point baskets. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than exorcising this offensive demon, though, Moorpark endured an 
exercise in futility, falling to Canyons, 108-87, in a Western State Conference 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Canyons (10-14, 3-4 in conference play), one of the highest-scoring teams in 
the state, rocketed to a 52-41 halftime lead and rode home on the shoulders of 
Clark, who scored 20 second-half points. 
</P>
<P>
"I was hitting everything from inside to outside," said Clark, who recently was 
moved to center. 
</P>
<P>
"He really played well for an off-guard," Canyons Coach Lee Smelser said of 
Clark. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark point guard Sam Crawford literally drew "aahs" with a spinning reverse 
layup early in the second half, but his 23 points and 10 assists went for 
naught. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't play well tonight, just had a concentration problem," Moorpark Coach 
Al Nordquist said. "As things went on, we began to press individually."

GUARD TANDEM LEADS CLEVELAND TO 66-49 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Because it's the end of a decade and all, it seems that everybody is churning 
out a "best of" list of some sort. A few City Section coaches, after taking a 
look at this year's talent, already have a jump on the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to the area's best guard tandem, most admit, Eddie Hill and Andre 
Chevalier of Cleveland High are at the top of the chart. In fact, it's such a 
moot point that some coaches and players have jockeyed verbally to claim 
runner-up honors. 
</P>
<P>
Even the vanquished concede as much. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't seen a better tandem, no," Kennedy Coach Yutaka Shimizu said after 
watching the pair combine for 30 points in Cleveland's 66-49 victory over the 
Golden Cougars in a North Valley League game Wednesday at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Hill and Chevalier played behind Division I-bound Adonis Jordan 
and Tim Bowen. 
</P>
<P>
"We called it 'J-World' last year because we were both juniors and neither one 
of us started," said Hill, who had 18 points. "It's fun to be starting." 
</P>
<P>
Could the pair still be underrated? Possibly. 
</P>
<P>
"They're asked to do things that others aren't," Cleveland Coach Marc Paez 
said. "They sit a lot. They're on the bench half the game and their statistics 
aren't what they could be if they played all the time." 
</P>
<P>
For Kennedy (10-8, 3-3 in league play), the stats said plenty: Chevalier had 12 
points and nine assists; Brandon Martin, a sophomore forward, had 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
Leading, 15-10, Cleveland (16-4, 6-0) opened the second quarter with an 11-1 
run, hitting its first four field-goal attempts. The lead grew to 31-13 on a 
three-point bomb by Chevalier with 4 minutes 10 seconds left in the half, 
capping a 16-3 surge. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy's Garret Anderson finished with 18 points but missed the front end of 
three one-and-one free throws in the decisive second quarter. Teammate Josh 
Etting scored 20, but it wasn't nearly enough. 
</P>
<P>
"I was out of it from the beginning," Anderson said. "We didn't really do what 
we wanted offensively, but things can get out of hand against them. We haven't 
played anybody like that all year." 
</P>
<P>
Has he seen anybody like Chevalier and Hill? 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say they're the best in the Valley," Anderson said. "Even worse, they're 
on the same team."

KENNEDY PULLS CLOSER TO 1ST PLACE WITH WIN OVER GRANADA HILLS

Kennedy High kept its Mid-Valley League title hopes alive Wednesday, turning 
back first-place Granada Hills, 2-1, at Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
With the victory, Kennedy (10-2-1 overall, 6-2 in league play) avenged a loss 
to Granada Hills (9-4-1, 6-1-1) and moved into second place, a half-game behind 
the Highlanders. 
</P>
<P>
Midfielder Brian Singer broke a scoreless tie early in the second half with a 
head shot off a pass from Ruben Rios. 
</P>
<P>
Rios had his hand in the Golden Cougars' other goal as well, passing to Luis 
Sandoval, who scored from 20 yards with 10 minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy outshot the Highlanders, 14-7, and shut down Granada Hills scoring 
threats with superb defense. "This time we played our game," Singer said. "This 
time we were calm and cool." 
</P>
<P>
No one was more coolheaded than goalkeeper Chris Hines, who recorded four 
saves. 
</P>
<P>
With the Golden Cougars holding a 1-0 lead, Hines found himself standing 
between the goal and Raphael Acosta, who had broken away for what appeared to 
be a clear opportunity to tie the score with 15 minutes to play. But Hines, a 
senior, sprinted to the front of the box and blocked the shot. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly Brockway spoiled Hines' bid for a shutout with a 25-yard goal with eight 
minutes left. DANNY SCHUMACHER

NERVES, NORTH HOLLYWOOD FAIL TO STOP VAN NUYS GIRLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEAN WATERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Van Nuys High girls' basketball team on Wednesday fired more errant 
missiles than are launched from Cape Canaveral, missing its first 15 shots. 
</P>
<P>
Call it nervous tension. 
</P>
<P>
In a game matching undefeated Mid-Valley League teams, the Wolves felt 
uncomfortable playing for a possible championship at North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so nervous because this game meant so much to me," said Van Nuys center 
Stacie Toon, who missed her first six shots. "We're playing for first place and 
I was scared." 
</P>
<P>
Toon settled down to register 26 points and 16 rebounds as the Wolves overcame 
a 12-point deficit to beat North Hollywood, 70-58. 
</P>
<P>
The Wolves (16-3, 6-0 in league play) have not won a league championship since 
1983, the year they lost to Granada Hills in the City Section 3-A Division 
title game. And just last season, North Hollywood (9-6, 5-1) whipped them twice 
by 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
But Van Nuys is a different team with a more mature Toon in the lineup. The 
Wolves, who trailed, 16-4, in the first quarter, got their first break early in 
the second when North Hollywood point guard Suzi Shimoyama picked up her fourth 
foul. 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys outscored North Hollywood, 23-8, in the pivotal second quarter and 
held a 32-24 halftime lead. That margin grew to 18 points as Toon scored 13 
points in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Jacinda Sweet had 36 points to pace North Hollywood.

DIGEST: ANTELOPE VALLEY MOVES ITS GAME FROM UNLV TO APPEASE NCAA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Because of National Collegiate Athletic Assn. concern over the potential 
unauthorized contact between prospective student-athletes and supporters of 
Nevada Las Vegas, Antelope Valley College's Feb. 3 game against College of the 
Desert will not be played at UNLV's Thomas and Mack Arena. 
</P>
<P>
The game originally was scheduled to be played at Antelope Valley, but the 
school's gym was already booked. 
</P>
<P>
Both the men's and women's games will now be played at Paraclete High in 
Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA had expressed its concerns about the potential for recruiting 
violations to Brad Rothermel, UNLV's athletic director. Rothermel passed the 
word to Newton Chelette, the Antelope Valley coach and a former UNLV assistant. 
A decision was reached that the game -- which would have been played after a 
nationally televised game between the fifth-ranked Rebels and North Carolina 
State -- would be moved. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Blackwell, a multitalented tailback for Hart High, has made an oral 
commitment to attend Oregon next fall. 
</P>
<P>
Blackwell rushed for 1,217 yards in 169 carries, caught 44 passes for 777 yards 
and scored 32 touchdowns while leading the Indians to the Foothill League title 
and to the second round of the Southern Section Division III playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Veney, an assistant track and field coach at Cal State Northridge, has 
been named women's sprints and relays coach for the West team at the U. S. 
Olympic Festival, July 20-26 in Minneapolis. Veney, who graduated from UCLA in 
1975, is entering his seventh season as the sprints, hurdles and horizontal 
jumps coach at Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
The Dwarf Athletic Assn. of America will hold regional competition in swimming, 
table tennis, basketball, field events and power lifting Jan. 25-26 at Cal 
State Northridge. The event is open to any eligible athlete who wishes to 
compete.

SEEKING BIGGER ROLE, BROWN LEAVES CRESPI FOR SAN FERNANDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM FARMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leonice Brown, the leading rusher for Crespi High last season, cited tension 
between himself and Coach Tim Lins and dissatisfaction with his role in the 
team's offense as reasons for his decision to transfer to San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, a junior who rushed for 1,097 yards last season, has withdrawn from 
Crespi and will enroll at San Fernando at the start of the spring semester Feb. 
5. 
</P>
<P>
"There was something we didn't see eye to eye on," Brown said. "He's a great 
coach, but there was probably some tension there. I don't want to sound 
conceited, but, in some games, I thought I could have carried the ball more. I 
thought I could have helped the team more. Being young, I guess I wasn't mature 
enough." 
</P>
<P>
Lins said that he harbors no ill will toward Brown. "I respect his feelings," 
Lins said. "I wish him the best of luck at San Fernando." 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando Coach Tom Hernandez said Brown should complement returning backs 
LaKarlos Townsend and William Taylor in the Tigers' wishbone offense. 
</P>
<P>
"He's going to be a great asset to this team," Hernandez said. "If he was here 
last year, it would have made a big difference. We wouldn't be 5-6, I know 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Brown had inherited the tailback job at Crespi from Russell White, the state's 
all-time leading rusher and Brown's nephew. Brown is the half brother of 
Charles White, the Heisman Trophy winner at USC and former San Fernando 
standout. SAM FARMER

The first round of WAC play comes to a close, and the Aztecs are still trying 
to establish some consistency. Case in point: Last Saturday in San Diego, the 
Aztecs led Texas El Paso at halftime, 44-38, but shot a frigid 24% in the 
second half and lost, 71-63. Michael Best made just two of 11 shots and scored 
five points in 33 minutes after scoring 24 points (10 of 13 shooting) Thursday 
against New Mexico. Center Marty Dow has been SDSU's most consistent force in 
WAC play, averaging 15 points and 6.3 rebounds. He will be key against Hawaii's 
strong rebounding team (second in WAC rebounding advantage at an average of 4.9 
more than opponents per game). Terry Houston leads Hawaii with 6.7 rebounds a 
game. Chris Gaines, who missed second half of last season because he was 
academically ineligible, is Hawaii's leading scorer (19.3 points).

INSEPARABLE FRIENDS TORN APART BY DEATH; 
</P>
<P>
TRAGEDY: ROCKY COSTELLO, A POPULAR ATHLETE FROM LA MIRADA, DIED FOUR DAYS AFTER 
A FIERY TRAFFIC CRASH. HIS CLOSE FRIEND AND BUSINESS PARTNER WAS BADLY BURNED 
IN THE CRASH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK WAGNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From beneath long, sun-bleached hair, Rocky Costello stares at the camera with 
the other black-jerseyed football players from Neff High School in La Mirada. 
He is in the third row in this 1979 yearbook photo and, naturally, stands 
beside Craig Gauthier. 
</P>
<P>
They had been inseparable since Little League, and would be for 10 more years, 
up to the moment a month ago when Costello died. They were in the same hospital 
room, both terribly burned from a highway crash. 
</P>
<P>
Gauthier is enduring the pain of burns on 60% of his body. The loss of his best 
friend, one of the most popular athletes La Mirada has ever known, hurts worse. 
</P>
<P>
Costello and Gauthier, both 28, had recently started a masonry business and 
were driving home from a job on Dec. 15 when, just after 5 p.m. their pickup 
truck was struck head-on by a car and burst into flames on Imperial Highway in 
Brea. 
</P>
<P>
Four days later, Costello, who was burned over 85% of his body, died at the UC 
Irvine Medical Center in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Costello, a kicker, was the most valuable player at Fresno State in 1983 and 
was still intent on playing in the National Football League. 
</P>
<P>
He was admired for his kicking and for the way he played golf and surfed. He 
was cherished for the way he touched lives. 
</P>
<P>
"He was like a perfect wave crashing on the beach," said Scott Betty, 26, also 
a longtime friend of Costello. "He made people around him feel good. I never 
heard him say a negative comment about anybody. Since we were 9, he never 
raised his voice at me. The only bad moment he brought to anyone was the day he 
passed away." 
</P>
<P>
The funeral, attended by 450 people who crowded into the 200-seat Chapel of 
Memories in Norwalk, went on for almost two emotional hours. Its heavy tension 
was eased when Kevin Gauthier, Craig's brother, stood and said that there was 
going to be a big football game in heaven and God, needing a kicker, said, 
"Let's draft Rock." 
</P>
<P>
Craig Gauthier lay in the subdued light of the UC Irvine Medical Center burn 
unit last week. His face, under a growth of whiskers, had healed. An arm, 
though, was heavily bandaged. A leg looked raw. 
</P>
<P>
Each time he shifted his body, he grimaced. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing I thank God for is that Rocky doesn't have to go through this pain," 
he said. "I know he would never want to live like this. It's been almost a 
month of pure hell." 
</P>
<P>
The crash is never off his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"I get angry, I know she may never have made a mistake before," he said, 
referring to the driver of the car, Janet Askew, 29, of Costa Mesa. "But my 
best friend was taken. I think she should pay for her mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
Askew, who was treated at a hospital and released, has been charged with 
manslaughter. She will be arraigned today in North Orange County Municipal 
Court in Fullerton. Tom Decker, a traffic officer with the Brea Police 
Department, said her speed was estimated at 90 m.p.h. He said her car first 
struck a median on the heavily traveled road. He said he did not know why she 
was going so fast, but that drugs or alcohol were not involved. 
</P>
<P>
"We were going west on Imperial, she was going east," Gauthier said. "Rocky was 
driving. The sun was just going down. She came right toward us. She hit us so 
hard. The fire happened so quick. The cabin lit up in flames. I couldn't get 
the window open because the right side was caved in. 
</P>
<P>
"The flames grew more intense. I was going to give up but I had one more burst 
of energy and opened the window eight inches. Somebody pulled me through. I was 
all lit on fire. My skin was melting off me. I was yelling bloody murder, 
yelling for someone to get Rocky out of the truck. Then I saw someone grab him. 
He was really on fire." 
</P>
<P>
It was hard for Gauthier to talk about Costello. When he did, it was through 
tears. "The guy was the greatest athlete who ever lived," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A week before the accident, Costello had shot a 66 to win a tournament at the 
La Mirada Golf Course. 
</P>
<P>
"Rocky was the perfect golfer," Gauthier said. "Nobody could hit it farther 
than him. And he was just learning." 
</P>
<P>
They played almost every day: basketball, golf, tennis, table tennis. 
</P>
<P>
"He beat me pretty much, but it was all in fun," Gauthier said. "We never got 
mad at each other. When he beat me he'd tell me to try harder. He was a 
complete motivator." 
</P>
<P>
Gauthier, who was an All-Suburban League defensive back at Neff, recalled how 
he and Costello would arrive for summer football practice sunburned from 
surfing, to the displeasure of the Neff coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"I surfed with him all my life," he said. "I thank God we surfed the day before 
the accident. Down at Huntington. It was perfect. It might have been the best 
day we surfed in 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
Costello died about 5:30 a.m. Dec. 19. 
</P>
<P>
"I could hear everybody rush in (the room)," Gauthier said. "They pulled the 
curtain around his bed." 
</P>
<P>
The attempts to resuscitate Costello were unsuccessful. Dr. Bruce Achauer said 
the damage to his lungs was too extensive. 
</P>
<P>
"I listened to the whole thing," Gauthier said. "I listened to 21 years of a 
beautiful friendship go away." 
</P>
<P>
Costello was a quarterback and kicker for five years on the La Mirada Lords, a 
Pop Warner team that won 83 consecutive games. As a Little Leaguer, he pitched 
a perfect game and once hit a home run against Gauthier to win a 1-0 game. 
</P>
<P>
His older brother, Rick Costello, was a gifted football player at Neff and 
later at the University of Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
"Rick was great, but the little guy just kept coming, just kept working," said 
Bob Costello, the boys' father. "(Rocky) never missed an extra point. All 
through Pop Warner, Neff, Cerritos and Fresno." 
</P>
<P>
Although he eventually grew to just under 6 feet and 165 pounds, Costello was 
too small to play quarterback in high school. As a sophomore, he was 5-foot-2 
and barely 100 pounds, so his father sent him to a ranch to learn to be a 
jockey. But the trainer, noting that the young man's feet were too big for that 
profession, sent him home. 
</P>
<P>
At Neff, which was closed in 1981 because of declining enrollment, Costello 
kicked the Trojans into the CIF playoffs. He made a 49-yard field goal his 
senior year. 
</P>
<P>
After two years at Cerritos College, Costello made Fresno State's team. In his 
MVP season, he scored 80 points and became a hero on a rainy afternoon in Long 
Beach. With Fresno trailing Cal State Long Beach, 3-0, Costello lined up for a 
field goal attempt with five minutes left in the game. But the snap from the 
center was bad. 
</P>
<P>
"The ball rolled back in a sea of mud," Fresno Coach Jim Sweeney recalled. "The 
holder (lateraled) the ball to Rocky and Rocky scrambled to his right and threw 
a 37-yard touchdown pass to a guy who had never caught a pass." Fresno won, 
7-3. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a generous kid," Sweeney said. "He would play quarterback or receiver 
in practice if we needed him to. He was the world's greatest volunteer." 
</P>
<P>
Costello had NFL tryouts with San Diego, Denver and Washington but was never 
signed. Rolf Benirschke of the Chargers and Rich Karlis of the Broncos, who 
were both at the peak of their careers, beat him out. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a step away from making it in pro football," Sweeney said. 
</P>
<P>
Costello, who had been running almost 10 miles a day, had planned to try again 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
The memories rush back for Costello's many friends -- how he was always with a 
pretty girl, how he would continually change a car's radio dial, how he always 
worried about his nose. 
</P>
<P>
"We called him Schnoz," said Mike Janosz, 31. "I remember him looking in the 
mirror once and saying, 'God, my nose.' " 
</P>
<P>
Costello's smile was an even more prominent feature. 
</P>
<P>
"He was like a preacher," his father said. "He always had time to talk to 
people. When you had a problem, Rocky would listen. He was a real good kid. He 
didn't cuss. Oh, he had a beer now and then." 
</P>
<P>
Costello, who lived with his parents in La Mirada, sold cars for a time in 
Huntington Beach, but his father said Rocky was not cut out for it. 
</P>
<P>
"He thought he was cheating people," said Bob Costello, who has a used car 
business in Bellflower. "I don't know how he made any money." 
</P>
<P>
Rudy Alkire, 62, of Hemet, was one of the many people who spoke at the funeral. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd known Rocky since he was a kid," Alkire said over the telephone this week. 
"When he got out of Cerritos in '81 he was working at a gas station. I was 
upset that he wasn't pursuing his college education. I had just had heart 
surgery and I had to have exercise. I told him to bring his bag of balls and 
we'd go up to the La Mirada High School field. He'd kick and I'd go get the 
balls and bring them back. Then we'd sit in the middle of the field and have 
terrific talks. 
</P>
<P>
"He called me one day and said, 'Mr. Alkire, I think I'm going to Fresno.' I 
said, 'Get in your car and hit the road.' 
</P>
<P>
"He was always asking me, 'Mr. Alkire, how do you feel?' He was like my kid . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
Alkire began to cry. 
</P>
<P>
Gauthier has returned to his home in Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
"They tell me I'm going to heal real good," he said. "I'm going to have to wear 
a special wet suit 24 hours a day for the next year to keep my skin smooth and 
flat. And absolutely no sun." 
</P>
<P>
Bent over, he struggles to rehabilitate himself. He walks 20 times up and down 
his driveway two or three times a day. 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday afternoon he watched golf on TV as his fiancee, Pamela Lynas, whom 
he plans to marry in May, held his hand. 
</P>
<P>
It won't be too long, he hopes, before he will be playing again. 
</P>
<P>
But without his best friend, he said, it will never be the same. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BURN TRUST FUND 
</P>
<P>
A trust fund to help pay medical expenses of Rocky Costello and Craig Gauthier 
has been set up through the Orange County Burn Assn., said Julie Byerley, a 
longtime friend of the men. Neither man had health insurance. She said checks, 
payable to the Costello/Gauthier Trust, may be sent to the burn association at 
1985 S. State College Blvd., Anaheim 92806.

SCHOOL OFFICIAL OFFERS PLAN EXTENDING FAST-FOOD SERVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROXANA KOPETMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LONG BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is a teen-ager's culinary dream come true. 
</P>
<P>
A Long Beach school official has come up with a plan that will allow sales of 
fast-food items such as pizza and hamburgers to continue on high school 
campuses. Fast-food sales also may be allowed occasionally at middle schools, 
beginning with the next school year. 
</P>
<P>
Daily fast-food deliveries were started last fall at Lakewood and Millikan high 
schools, and students responded enthusiastically. At Jordan, Poly and Wilson 
high schools, pizza was delivered most Fridays. 
</P>
<P>
Besides questioning the nutritional value of the fast-food items, educators 
pointed out that such sales violated state and local school regulations aimed 
at preventing competition with the schools' food service operations. 
</P>
<P>
But the new director of the school district's food services, Frank Towers, has 
come up with a plan that at least appears to resolve the legal concerns. The 
school food service operations will take charge of purchasing and selling the 
fast-food items, thus eliminating potential competition between fast-food sales 
and school cafeterias. 
</P>
<P>
There had been some concerns that the district's food service division would 
lose money as a result of the fast-food sales, and cafeteria workers had said 
they were concerned that fast-food sales might eliminate some of their jobs. 
Fast-food items have been sold in student stores, with all profits going to 
student activity funds. 
</P>
<P>
State and local regulations limited outside food sales on campus to four days a 
year. The limit mainly is to prevent competition with school cafeterias, which 
must be self-supporting, said Maria Balakshin, director of the state Department 
of Education's division of child nutrition and food distribution services. 
</P>
<P>
The fast-food meals will continue to be sold through the schools' student 
stores rather than in the cafeteria, but the food service operation will split 
the profits with individual schools. 
</P>
<P>
The new plan still has its critics, and even Towers himself said he is not 
completely satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a magical answer to everything," Towers said, adding that he would 
prefer that students eat the balanced meals prepared by cafeteria workers. But 
that is unrealistic, he said, because many teen-agers would rather hop in a car 
and leave campus for lunch than walk through a cafeteria line. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't offer them something (like this), they'll leave campus," Towers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Towers said, he would like to eliminate fast foods by having school 
cafeteria workers prepare the type of meals that students prefer. Towers said 
he wants each school to create a student group to advise him on the types of 
foods and services the teen-agers would like. 
</P>
<P>
School board President Jenny Oropeza said this week she is concerned that 
fast-food sales will contribute to students' poor eating habits, which later 
lead to high cholesterol levels and other problems. 
</P>
<P>
"A McDonald's hamburger, as an example, has so much salt and fat. . . . It's 
terrible that we would be contributing to their health problems," Oropeza said. 
McDonald's representatives have called their food "extremely nutritious." 
</P>
<P>
Oropeza said that she hopes the district will move swiftly to improve the 
cafeterias' food so that students won't be tempted by fast foods. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at Lakewood and Millikan also expressed concern over the decline in 
student-activity revenues that will result from Towers' plan. Once the 
district's food service branch contracts directly with fast-food outlets, the 
district and the schools will split the revenue generated. Until now, the 
schools ran the sales and kept the profits for student activities. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not terribly happy with it. I'd much rather have the full amount go to 
school activities," said Bob Schnebeck, activities director at Millikan High 
School, which has generated about $25,000 in profits from the food sales since 
last September. 
</P>
<P>
James Wickman, activities director at Lakewood High, said: "From what I 
understand in meeting with Mr. Towers, we don't have much of a choice (because 
of local and state regulations.) 
</P>
<P>
"Fifty percent of something is better than nothing," he added. 
</P>
<P>
While disagreeing on some aspects of the issue, school board members, school 
officials and district administrators agree that a primary concern is keeping 
students from leaving campus for lunch, thus reducing tardiness and safety 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I would prefer," Towers said, "to have students stay on campus and buy fast 
food then go off campus and buy fast food." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to keep students on campus during the lunch period, officials at 
Millikan and Lakewood high schools last fall began ordering hamburgers, pizza 
and other food from fast-food outlets. At Lakewood High, more than 1,000 of the 
school's 3,400 students have been buying fast-food items every day. But some 
educators expressed concern that the fast-food sales were violating state and 
local school regulations.

SCOPE: STUDENT PEER COUNSELORS LEARN TO LISTEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE HARRIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is only a one-unit class that cannot be used for college credit, but 
students in peer counseling at Paramount High School say the course is more 
difficult than their academic subjects. 
</P>
<P>
But students say they enjoy the class because they are helping other 
teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
"It is emotionally challenging," said Jill Zuidervaart, 17, a senior peer 
counselor. 
</P>
<P>
Another counselor, 17-year-old junior Tracy Dawson said: "This is harder than 
math." 
</P>
<P>
Shelly Massicotte, 17, an advanced counselor added: "We are dealing with 
real-life stuff." 
</P>
<P>
After completing a 20-week semester of classroom training, students during the 
second semester provide counseling to their peers. Of the 36 students now 
attending peer counseling classes, eight have advanced to the point where they 
can handle any type of problem. 
</P>
<P>
Troubled teen-agers place their request slips for counseling in a locked wooden 
box in the library. Peer counseling teacher Sandy Jacobs is the only one with a 
key to the box. 
</P>
<P>
Problems range from drugs to pregnancy, rape, suicidal thoughts and alcoholic 
and abusive parents. 
</P>
<P>
Other students who might be suspected of taking drugs or are having academic 
problems and are unwilling to talk with adult counselors or teachers are 
referred to the peer counselors. 
</P>
<P>
The peer counselors "help break the ice. They move the student to seek 
resources on campus," said Michael White, who heads the school student 
counseling services. 
</P>
<P>
The youths talk with the peer counselors in empty rooms, during lunch hours or 
after school. Sometimes the youth counselors might be dismissed from one of 
their regular classes to talk with a troubled classmate. 
</P>
<P>
The peer counselors listen, but they do not try to tell troubled students what 
to do. Everything they talk about is kept in strict confidence. However, they 
are required by state law to report cases of abuse or possible suicide or 
potential harm or threats to others. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of a 17-year-old male student who was sleeping with a gun under his 
pillow, peer counselor Olivier Contreras said she listened and was able to get 
the young man to talk about his problems. He was considering killing himself 
because of problems he was having with his girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
"He was nervous. I held his hand," Contreras said. 
</P>
<P>
The young man's parents were told, school authorities were notified and 
professional counseling was recommended for him, Jacobs said. The youth has 
since dropped out of school. 
</P>
<P>
Girls who think they are pregnant are informed about their options, which 
include talking with their parents, seeking professional counseling and 
discussing the situation with the baby's father. They are also encouraged to 
seek a medical examination immediately. 
</P>
<P>
The peer counseling program was started as an after-school pilot project three 
years ago by Jacobs, who was a business teacher at the school. She is also the 
substance abuse coordinator. Jacobs has a BA and MA in business. She also has 
an MA in counseling psychology and is a licensed marriage, family and child 
therapist. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs said she was hearing so many student problems that she thought it might 
be a good idea to start a peer counseling group. 
</P>
<P>
Many public schools have found peer counseling to be successful in dealing with 
student problems, said Michael Donnelly, president of the California Peer 
Counseling Assn. The association is a statewide volunteer organization composed 
of adult professionals counselors and student peer counselors. 
</P>
<P>
According to the most recent data based on a 1986 state Department of Education 
survey, 25% of more than 800 high schools had some type of peer counseling 
program, Donnelly said. 
</P>
<P>
"Good counseling programs work when students (counselors) are properly 
trained," said Donnelly, who runs a peer counseling program at San Gabriel High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
The Paramount Unified School District Board of Education approved the class for 
the one-unit elective credit last year and Jacobs began teaching it full-time. 
</P>
<P>
The students who sign up must have passing grades and be recommended by their 
teachers. The peer counselors are taught basic skills on how to be good 
listeners and how to communicate to troubled youths that they can seek 
alternatives to their problems. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs said of the peer counselors: "While they may never use algebra in their 
adult lives," they will always be able to use their counseling skills. 
</P>

Students in Sandy Jacobs' peer counseling class at Paramount High School are 
being trained to listen and help their troubled classmates come to decisions 
about sex, drugs and family problems. The peer counselors not only care about 
the students they are helping, they care about each other and show it with 
frequent hugs, like Dora Rocha, left, and Tracey Dawson, both 17.

CONSULTANT HIRED TO STUDY YEAR-ROUND SCHOOL PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Paramount Unified School District Board of Education has hired a consultant 
to study the feasibility of a year-round schedule to relieve overcrowded 
classroom conditions. 
</P>
<P>
The firm of Jack Schreder &amp; Associates of Sacramento has been hired for 
$6,250 to conduct the study, which is expected to be completed in 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
The study will include an analysis of projected enrollment, effect on the 
community and the cost of implementation. 
</P>
<P>
There are more than 12,500 students currently enrolled in the district. And the 
district does not have any vacant land for expansion, Supt. Richard B. Caldwell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A second floor is being built on the district's only high school, Paramount 
High, to ease overcrowding. Wirtz Elementary School, which was converted to 
accommodate about 600 high school students, will be reopened as an elementary 
school as soon as the second-story addition is completed in September.

MEMORIAL FUND ESTABLISHED FOR STUDENT KILLED IN CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A memorial fund has been established at Whittier College for a 22-year-old 
student who was killed when the car she was driving collided early Sunday with 
an airport shuttle bus in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Delphi L. Murphy, a junior majoring in art, was killed after the car apparently 
ran a stop light at 96th Street and Sepulveda Boulevard and was broadsided by 
the bus, college spokeswoman Sandy Sarr said. 
</P>
<P>
Two other students in the car, Carol Hooper and Linda Bennett, were treated at 
nearby hospitals and released. 
</P>
<P>
Sarr said Murphy and her twin sister, Desma, were "very popular and visible on 
campus. You would always see them together. It is very unusual that they were 
apart the night of the accident." 
</P>
<P>
Sarr said a funeral service will be held at 7:30 p.m. today at Westminster 
Presbyterian Church of Pasadena, 1757 N. Lake Ave., Pasadena.

FORMER CITY MANAGER'S SUIT SETTLED FOR $225,000

<P>
The city has settled a two-year lawsuit filed by a former Cudahy city manager 
who charged that his employment contract had been unjustly terminated. 
</P>
<P>
John F. Porter, who was fired in September, 1986, after the first year of a 
five-year contract, was given a $225,000 settlement by the city earlier this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
City officials argued that the contract was too long and denied future City 
Councils the right to hire city staff members of their choice. A Superior Court 
judge ruled in the city's favor, but an appeals court recently overturned the 
decision.

WATER CALLED TOP PROBLEM IN LAKEWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELE FUETSCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER

LAKEWOOD

<TEXT>
<P>
Water and trash top the list of issues facing city government in the '90s, 
officials said Tuesday at the annual State of the City breakfast for municipal 
employees, commissioners and elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
"Of all the challenges we face," City Administrator Howard L. Chambers told the 
audience of 200, "the most important is the issue of preserving our adequate 
water supply." 
</P>
<P>
Lakewood, he said, will be among those local governments that in the next 
decade take a more aggressive posture on water quality and conservation. "We 
have to solve our water problems in this state," Chambers said. 
</P>
<P>
Lakewood gets 95% of its water from city-owned wells. The city is "fortunate 
not to have any of the toxins that have been found in other places," said James 
B. Glancy, director of the city Water Department. 
</P>
<P>
Water quality, however, is still a critical issue in Lakewood, public 
information director Donald J. Waldie said later, because pollutants from 
industrial and manufacturing sources in the San Gabriel Valley have seeped into 
the ground water and can migrate toward Lakewood wells. 
</P>
<P>
Water is expected to become such an important issue in the next decade, several 
city officials pointed out, that the city has created a separate Water 
Department out of what had been a division of the Public Works Department. 
</P>
<P>
Glancy said reclamation of sewer water is an important part of the process. The 
city is already using the specially treated water, purchased from the Los 
Angeles County Sanitation Districts, to keep city parks green. The city has 
also begun arranging for other large users, such as schools, to use reclaimed 
water. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Larry Van Nostran touched on the importance of crime and drug prevention 
programs and cultivation of the city's economic base. But he also stressed 
environmental concerns, saying that "1990 is another year of crisis in the 
environment. We must confront the hard issues of air quality, solid waste 
management, safe drinking water and the growing transportation gridlock." 
</P>
<P>
Solutions, the mayor said, would have to be regional. "We must make every level 
of government more accountable for policies which fail to address our 
environmental crisis," Van Nostran said. 
</P>
<P>
William J. (Joe) O'Neil, head of public works, said that "solid waste disposal 
. . . most commonly known to us as trash" will become an increasingly familiar 
term in the decade as landfills reach capacity and cities begin to wrestle with 
state orders to reduce the volume of trash they generate. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the next few years," O'Neil said, "you're going to hear a lot about 
recycling and composting." 
</P>
<P>
Lakewood generates more than 65,000 tons of trash a year, he said. The state 
has ordered a 25% reduction in trash output by 1995 and a 50% reduction by the 
year 2000. Every city is under state order to come up with a proposal for 
reaching those goals. Lakewood has hired a consultant to help develop a plan, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
This was the first year that the city invited all of its approximately 160 
employees to the breakfast. In the past only elected and appointed officials

CAMPUS VICE PRESIDENT CHANGES DUTIES

<P>
Robert Bersi, vice president for university relations and development at Cal 
State Long Beach since 1987, has resigned from that position to concentrate on 
expanding the university's endowment through trust donations and estate 
planning as a special assistant to campus President Curtis L. McCray. 
</P>
<P>
"Bob made his own decision," McCray said. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a talent for working on deferred giving -- grants and trusts and wills 
and so forth -- and we want to put more emphasis on that as part of building 
the institution." 
</P>
<P>
In vacating the vice presidency, in which he was responsible for overseeing the 
university's public relations efforts and overall financial development, Bersi 
will also be giving up his seat on the five-member president's cabinet, the 
university's highest administrative body. 
</P>
<P>
Freedom from administrative duties, McCray said, will allow Bersi to focus on 
encouraging donors to remember the university in their wills and trusts, an 
endeavor he has pursued successfully in the past. McCray said a national 
search, expected to take about four months, will be conducted to find a new 
vice president.

EX-SOUTH GATE PREP STAR OPTS FOR DOMINGUEZ HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL McLEOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Keith Billingslea, a 6-foot-2 guard-forward from South Gate High School, has 
left the basketball team at the University of Northern Arizona and says he will 
enroll at Cal State Dominguez Hills. 
</P>
<P>
A starter at Northern Arizona, Billingslea confirmed last Friday that he has 
asked the university for his outright release so he can begin practicing with 
Dominguez Hills. He would become eligible to play for the Toros next December, 
according to Toros Coach Dave Yanai, if he passes the NCAA-required 24 semester 
units of class work. Billingslea said he will begin classes at Dominguez Hills 
when the spring semester gets under way Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Reached at his home in Los Angeles, Billingslea cited his desire for a better 
educational setting as the major reason for the change. 
</P>
<P>
"It was nothing bad," he said. "I just felt that in this time in my life 
education was more important than anything." 
</P>
<P>
Billingslea said Northern Arizona did not provide enough classroom tutoring for 
his needs. He also criticized Lumberjack Coach Pat Rafferty for a "lack of 
consistency" in coaching style. 
</P>
<P>
Rafferty was unavailable for comment, and university officials said only that 
Billingslea had quit the team for "personal reasons." 
</P>
<P>
Billingslea said he chose to transfer to Dominguez Hills in Carson because it 
is within driving distance of his Los Angeles home, he has heard favorable 
things about Yanai and the university offers better educational services than 
he was receiving in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
The 215-pound power player is considered a pleasant gift for Yanai, who is 
struggling to get the Toros (5-12) back on the winning track after several 
successful years. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a very, very good player," Yanai said. "We're happy to have him." 
</P>
<P>
Once he enrolls, Billingslea can practice with the Toros, but he cannot receive 
any financial aid until he receives a written release from Northern Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
A graduate of South Gate High School, Billingslea was chosen by The Times as 
Southeast area Player of the Year in 1986 and earned a scholarship to Fresno 
State, but after his freshman season he became homesick and quit the team. He 
transferred to Harbor College in Wilmington and last year averaged 18.8 points 
a game, earning first-team all-conference honors. 
</P>
<P>
At Northern Arizona, Billingslea started 11 of his 12 games at off-guard and 
averaged 13.5 points a game.

SECORD GETS PROBATION, CALLS REAGAN COWARDLY; 
</P>
<P>
IRAN-CONTRA: THE FORMER GENERAL ADMITS HE MISLED CONGRESS. THE JUDGE DECIDES 
PRISON WOULD BE TOO HARSH.

<P>
Richard V. Secord, who ran the shadowy enterprise set up to channel money from 
Iran arms sales to the Contras in Nicaragua, was sentenced to two years' 
probation Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The former Air Force major general faced up to five years in jail, but U.S. 
District Judge Aubrey E. Robinson Jr. said that prison would be too harsh a 
punishment. 
</P>
<P>
Secord pleaded guilty to one felony count of misleading Congress as part of a 
plea bargain that resulted in the dismissal of 11 other charges. Also, Robinson 
ordered Secord to pay a fee of $50, the minimum required for all defendants who 
plead guilty in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said it was his judgment that there had already "been punishment in 
this case," an apparent reference to Secord's contention that he had spent a 
great deal of his own funds for his defense and has been unemployed in the two 
years since being charged. 
</P>
<P>
Hours after he left the courtroom, an unrepentant and defiant Secord called a 
press conference to announce a nationwide fund-raising campaign to challenge 
the constitutionality of the independent counsel system that prosecuted him and 
seven others in the Iran-Contra scandal. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he berated former President Ronald Reagan, calling him a coward 
who ducked responsibility for the consequences of a covert program initiated to 
support Reagan's own foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been involved in this witch hunt for too long to stop now," he said. "It 
is not in my nature. I am trying to shift over a little bit . . . from the 
defense to the offense." 
</P>
<P>
Secord's two years of probation was the same as the penalty imposed on 
Iran-Contra defendants sentenced previously. However, former White House 
National Security Adviser Robert C. McFarlane was also fined $20,000 and 
ordered to perform 200 hours of community service. And former Lt. Col. Oliver 
L. North was fined $150,000 and ordered to perform 1,200 hours of service. 
</P>
<P>
North was convicted of three crimes, including aiding and abetting an 
obstruction of Congress, altering and destroying National Security Council 
documents and accepting an illegal gratuity from Secord, a home security 
system. McFarlane pleaded guilty to four counts of withholding information from 
Congress in connection with inquiries about whether secret assistance was going 
to the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
Secord sounded contrite when he addressed Robinson just before the judge 
imposed sentence. "I deeply regret not having been more candid with the 
investigators of the Congress," he told the judge. "If there was any way to 
correct this, I surely would. I'll regret it for the rest of my life." 
</P>
<P>
He pleaded guilty to telling congressional investigators he was unaware that 
any money in the Iran-Contra affair had benefited North personally. Secord paid 
for North's $13,800 home security system and established a fund for the 
education of North's children with proceeds of his Iran-Contra enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
The 11 counts that were dismissed as a result of the plea bargain included 
broad charges of conspiracy, theft of government property, mail fraud and 
perjury. 
</P>
<P>
In imposing sentence, Robinson said: "The necessity for incarceration does not 
exist by virtue of the offense for which he was permitted to enter a plea of 
guilty." 
</P>
<P>
At his press conference, Secord insisted that his answers to investigators had 
been literally true, but misleading. He admitted that he knew what the 
investigators wanted to know and should have leveled with them because, if he 
had, "I would have avoided all of this." 
</P>
<P>
But he expressed no regrets for his part in the covert operation that sent 
overpriced weapons to Iran and diverted the proceeds into a fund for the 
Contras at a time when U.S. law prohibited the expenditure of public funds to 
support the Nicaraguan rebels. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there was anything illegal going on," he said. "I thought at the 
time I was doing the President's bidding in a covert operation." 
</P>
<P>
Reid H. Weingarten, the prosecutor who handled the case for independent counsel 
Lawrence E. Walsh, urged Robinson to sentence Secord more harshly than 
McFarlane or North, who he said had acted out of a sense of "misguided 
patriotism." 
</P>
<P>
He said Secord misled investigators only to save his own skin. "This is the 
stuff of routine felonies," Weingarten said. 
</P>
<P>
The charge of misleading Congress was similar to the one brought against former 
Atty. Gen. Richard G. Kleindienst for his part in the Watergate scandal 15 
years ago. In 1974, Kleindienst was sentenced to a suspended one-month jail 
term and a $100 fine. 
</P>
<P>
Rita Lavelle, a former Environmental Protection Agency official, was sentenced 
in 1984 to six months in prison and fined $10,000 for lying to Congress about 
the Superfund toxic-waste cleanup program. 
</P>
<P>
In a more recent case, Michael K. Deaver, former President Reagan's close 
friend and adviser, was given a suspended three-year sentence in 1988 for three 
counts of lying to Congress and a grand jury about using his influence on 
behalf of high-paying private clients after leaving office. Deaver was also 
ordered to perform 1,500 hours of community service and fined $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
At his press conference, Secord said he intended to raise money to sponsor a 
new test of the constitutionality of the Watergate-era law that calls for the 
appointment of independent counsels to prosecute government corruption cases in 
which the Justice Department might have a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
He conceded that the U.S. Supreme Court has already ruled that the statute is 
constitutional, but he said the issue must be "readdressed and readdressed 
until favorable rulings can be had." 
</P>
<P>
Secord said he believes that the money left from his now-defunct Iran-Contra 
enterprise is "something over $8 million." Although some is in Swiss bank 
accounts, he said that he is uncertain about the exact location of some of the 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
During hearings two years ago, members of Congress suggested that the money be 
reclaimed by the United States, but the government has taken no official 
actions to regain the funds. Secord insisted that he would not claim them 
either and said he has already collected "something over $240,000" in fees for 
his services in running the business side of the Iran-Contra scheme. 
</P>
<P>
Secord said he has no evidence that President Bush played a role in the 
scandal. But he was bitter about Reagan and former Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese III. 
</P>
<P>
"I think President Reagan has been hiding out," he said. "I think it's 
cowardly." 
</P>
<P>
As for Meese, Secord said that the former attorney general disclosed to the 
press the diversion of funds to the Contras and called for an independent 
counsel "in panic and out of ignorance . . . . He had all of his facts wrong." 
</P>
<P>

EXPERTS FAULT MCMARTIN CHILD INTERVIEW METHODS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE C. ROARK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are many things to be learned from the McMartin Pre-School molestation 
case, but perhaps the most important lesson of all is how not to talk to 
children, according to top child-development experts. 
</P>
<P>
Experts across the country say the interview techniques intended to extract the 
truth from youngsters who attended the Manhattan Beach nursery school were so 
misguided as to make the children seem coerced, rehearsed and ultimately 
unbelievable to the jury. And last Thursday, the jury acquitted Ray Buckey and 
his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, of 52 counts of child molestation. 
</P>
<P>
According to both child development and criminal defense experts who have 
closely monitored the case for the last six years, some of the adults -- the 
parents, the prosecutors, the therapists -- who tried hardest to find out what 
happened in the first place may have done the most to confuse the case in the 
end. While the prosecution's approach will surely be subjected to ongoing 
attacks of second-guessing and Monday morning quarterbacking, in the long run 
it will be the conversations with the children that were the most confusing, 
the most damaging. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had to do it over again, I would do some things differently," Kee 
McFarlane, the social worker at the Children's Institute International who 
interviewed many of the children, told The Times on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, according to the experts, was that most of the children were never 
given the chance to simply tell what, if anything, happened to them. 
</P>
<P>
"They were never given the opportunity to tell their stories as they knew them, 
in their own words, until long after their minds had been contaminated with the 
thoughts and fears of the adults around them," said David Raskin, a 
psychologist at the University of Utah who has been studying child abuse cases 
for the last 15 years. By then, he said, it was too late. 
</P>
<P>
Although the questioning process worked differently for each of the 360 
children who eventually claimed to have been sexually molested, in many 
instances it was the parents who first talked to their own children, followed 
by the police. Eventually most of the children were referred to the Children's 
Institute International, an established child-abuse treatment center in Los 
Angeles that had much experience with abused children but little or no 
knowledge of the judicial system. 
</P>
<P>
 McFarlane summed up the institute's approach this way: Because of their fears 
about what their parents would think and what the police would do, because of 
their terror about what their perpetrators had supposedly done already, the 
children had to be helped, they had to be taken by the hand and persuaded that 
it was "all right to tell their yucky secrets." 
</P>
<P>
If she were doing it again, McFarlane said, she would move more slowly, giving 
the chlidren time to say whatever it is they wanted to say in their own words. 
The problem, she said, was that there were so many cases. (The institute 
interviewed 400 children.) And there was much pressure to get through with it, 
to get on with it. 
</P>
<P>
Given the choice, she said, she might not do it at all -- at least she would 
not put herself in the position of being both therapist and investigator. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't do both, not at the same time," McFarlane said in a telephone 
interview from San Francisco, where she said she has gone to rest and reflect 
on what went wrong with the case from the prosecution's -- and the children's 
-- point of view. 
</P>
<P>
"The unfortunate thing about what happened in the McMartin case is that we were 
forced to do both," McFarlane said. "We were gathering information for lawyers 
while at the same time we were just trying to get these children through their 
fears." 
</P>
<P>
A therapist's or social worker's goal is to understand "the subjective reality" 
of the patient, to understand his fears and fantasies, Raskin said. 
</P>
<P>
An investigator's job is to deal only with reality, "the truth as it actually 
happened," not as it was feared or imagined, Raskin said. These two goals are 
completely in conflict, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Just because the interviews were conducted as they were does not mean that the 
crimes did not occur, said Faye Girsh, a San Diego therapist. It simply means 
that "it will be impossible for anyone ever to know for certain exactly what 
did -- and what did not -- happen" at the McMartin school, said Girsh, who has 
worked on numerous child-abuse cases that have been successfully prosecuted, 
including a recent one involving 26 children in a Montessori day school 
baby-sitting service in Reno, Nev. 
</P>
<P>
By comparing cases that have been successfully prosecuted with those that have 
not, social scientists have tried to glean information about how children talk, 
how they think -- and what will hold up in court. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing we agree on across the board is that the way it was done in the 
McMartin case is not the way it should be done. Beyond that, there isn't a lot 
of agreement among experts about what is right and what isn't," said one 
child-abuse specialist, who, like most of the nationally known figures in the 
field, was drawn into the case as a consultant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Questions Remain 
</P>
<P>
Since the McMartin case began, dozens of books have been written and hundreds 
of workshops and seminars have been conducted across the country to try to 
teach mental-health specialists something about how the judicial system 
operates and to teach lawyers and police officers something of how the mind of 
a child works. But many questions remain on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
Although some experts continue to believe that child molestation is 
under-reported, some law-enforcement officers and a growing number of 
child-abuse experts believe that the United States may be suffering from mass 
hysteria about child abuse -- a hysteria that is now infecting the minds of the 
children who are not developmentally equipped to distinguish between truth and 
lie, fact and fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
The other side of the problem is that actual child molesters are extremely hard 
to identify. 
</P>
<P>
In the behavioral sciences unit at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Va., profiles 
of child molesters have been developed. Unlike drug traffickers or other 
high-profile criminals, child molesters are often model citizens, hard-working, 
successful professionals, usually men, who are unusually kind to children and 
have no apparent sign of mental illness, other than their abnormal sexual 
attraction to children. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why they are so scary," said Girsh, who in her practice has treated 
many perpetrators of incest and pedophiles, the medical term for child 
molesters. 
</P>
<P>
But researchers have also been observing parents as well as perpetrators. And 
what they are seeing is nearly as chilling. 
</P>
<P>
Even when parents simply suspect that their child has been abused, they behave 
in ways that can also harm the children. Sometimes parents react with such 
horror and disbelief that they do not give the children any support and they do 
not even allow them the opportunity to say whether anything really happened. 
</P>
<P>
In other cases, parents become so obsessed with their own worries that they 
badger their children to the point they begin to think something untoward or 
awful has happened, even when it really has not. 
</P>
<P>
There are researchers who believe that children, because of their vulnerability 
and their dependency on adults, can in effect be brainwashed by an unending 
barrage of questions, allegations and innuendoes. 
</P>
<P>
But there are other experts who believe that this line of reasoning is 
preposterous. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Equipped to Lie 
</P>
<P>
Children, these researchers insist, cannot tell a lie, at least not about 
something as painful and unfamiliar as sexual abuse. They have neither the 
experience, the incentive nor the language to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Many of these arguments are based on years of study by prominent researchers in 
the field, most notably Gail Goodman, a development psychologist at the State 
University of New York at Buffalo, and Karen Saywitz, director of children's 
psychological outpatient services at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Working under grants from the U.S. Justice Department, the National Center on 
Child Abuse and Neglect and other organizations, these researchers have found 
that while children, especially children the age of those who attended the 
McMartin Pre-School, can and will fabricate a wrong answer to a question, they 
are not able to fabricate details. 
</P>
<P>
One of the unfortunate by-products of the nation's war on child abuse, however, 
is that children at younger and younger ages are learning more and more about 
child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Girsh tells the story of a case in San Diego involving a recently divorced 
couple whose 6-year-old daughter accused the father, a prominent and respected 
lawyer, of sexual abuse. The child insisted that she knew the difference 
between truth and lie, between fact and fantasy. True, she knew the words. But 
she also insisted in court that she had seen the tooth fairy. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the judge and jury learned that her mother had recently read her a 
book on child molestation, which the child, for whatever reasons, had committed 
to memory. What she had told her mother and the prosecutors was not what she 
had actually experienced in real life but what she learned from a book. 
</P>
<P>
If an interview is conducted properly -- meaning that children are given the 
time and the encouragement to talk, but are not told what to say or what others 
have said before them -- they will eventually tell the truth, many researchers 
believe. 
</P>
<P>
The question is how to get it. 
</P>
<P>
Some studies have shown that the more serious the interviewer is, the more 
likely the child will be to tell the truth. But other studies have suggested 
that the colder and more emotionally remote the interviewer, the more likely 
the child will be to say what he or she believes the interviewer wants to hear. 
</P>
<P>
One of the controversial techniques, one used in the McMartin case, involves 
playing on the floor with the children and using dolls and puppets. Critics say 
such practices demean children, compromise the seriousness of the task and lead 
to more fantasy playing than fact telling. Others say it is necessary to put 
the children at ease, although even proponents acknowledge that too much should 
not be read into what children do with dolls. 
</P>
<P>
As one child-abuse expert put it, "The dolls are not lie detectors; they are 
communication tools." 
</P>
<P>
What is most important, according to many experts, is understanding the 
language children speak. 
</P>
<P>
"If you start using works like, 'under' or 'against' or 'on top of' or 
'inside,' you'd better know ahead of time that children actually know what 
those prepositions mean," said Laurie Braga, a psychologist at the University 
of Miami Medical School, who, along with her husband, Joseph, helped 
prosecutors by interviewing dozens of sexually abused children in a day-care 
center in Miami in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
That case -- which was the subject of a book, "Unspeakable Acts" by Jan 
Hollingsworth, and a television docudrama -- resulted in what is said to be the 
first successful prosecution in the nation of a day-care center operator on 
multiple abuse charges. 
</P>
<P>
It is also critical, Laurie Braga said, to understand something about child 
development. What do children know? What can they remember? 
</P>
<P>
You cannot, for example, ask a 3-year-old whether something happened within the 
last 30 days or even within the last 30 minutes. They don't even know how to 
tell time. 
</P>
<P>
A common theme voiced by many child-abuse experts is just how poorly equipped 
the American courtroom is to deal with accusations from children. 
</P>
<P>
"In our judicial system, we are not allowed to ask 'leading' questions," said 
Ann Uherek, a psychologist at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, who has provided 
therapy for 12 McMartin students and 38 other children enrolled in five nearby 
schools who had also claimed to be abused. 
</P>
<P>
Uherek said the typical question in an American court of law is worded this 
way: "Tell us what happened on the morning of April 19, 1989." That is not a 
question a 3-year-old or a 4-year-old or even a 9-year-old can answer, she 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Although California and other states have exceptions in their codes of evidence 
that make some allowances for children, many experts believe that the courts 
have not gone far enough in accommodating children. There have been some 
efforts to reform the system, including an experiment in Denver where judges 
bring children into their private chambers, sit them on their knees and listen 
to what they have to say. 
</P>
<P>
Some states, California included, have also passed laws allowing testimony to 
be taken in private, on closed circuit television, so small children are spared 
the trauma of appearing before their alleged abusers. 
</P>
<P>
The American judicial system insists that the accused be allowed to face his 
accuser. But when dealing with children, Uherek said, that system simply does 
not work. "It may be fine for adults," she said, "but not for children, who are 
susceptible to magical thinking . . . who believe that simply by having to face 
their perpetrator, they will be harmed or even killed." 
</P>
<P>
"In one sense," Joseph Braga said, "there may be a great deal of historical 
significance in these child-abuse cases because we are beginning to define what 
are the needs, what are the capabilities of young children." 
</P>
<P>
The unfortunate thing, according to many experts, is that many people are 
inexperienced in this new field and are operating by the seat of their pants. 
</P>
<P>
As far as many child-abuse experts are concerned, however, there is a bitter 
irony in all the criticism that has been lodged against McFarlane and others 
like her who have tried to help children tell painful stories about what adults 
have done to them. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike rape cases, in which the victim is often blamed for what may or may not 
have happened, it is the therapist in child-abuse cases who gets the brunt of 
the criticism. 
</P>
<P>
We cannot bring ourselves to blame innocent children, the experts say, but we 
certainly can and do blame the adults who helped the children to tell their 
stories. It is, Joseph Braga said, a new form of an ancient practice: Killing 
the messenger because you don't like the message.

GOVERNOR TO OFFER HEALTH CARE PLAN; 
</P>
<P>
INSURANCE: DRAFT PROPOSAL WOULD REQUIRE ALL BUSINESSES TO COVER WORKERS. 
PROGRAM WOULD BE ONE OF THE MOST AMBITIOUS IN THE NATION.

<TEXT>
<P>
In a far-reaching departure from past policy, the Deukmejian Administration is 
circulating a draft proposal that would require every business in California to 
provide health insurance to its workers. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, prepared by Republican Gov. George Deukmejian's Health and 
Welfare Agency, goes far beyond a plan offered last year by Assembly Speaker 
Willie Brown, a liberal Democrat, and would give California one of the most 
ambitious state-mandated health insurance programs in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, a copy of which was obtained by The Times, includes elements to 
subsidize the cost of insurance for low-wage employees and low-profit 
businesses, contain skyrocketing medical costs and curb the expense of medical 
malpractice lawsuits and insurance. 
</P>
<P>
About 4 million of the estimated 5 million Californians currently without 
insurance -- mostly low-wage workers and their dependents -- would be covered 
by the plan. The homeless, the unemployed, retired people, some disabled people 
and students who are not dependents of their parents would be left out. These 
groups would continue to depend on county-run health care programs and "charity 
care" provided by private hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
Politically, the proposal would allow Deukmejian, long criticized for failing 
to tackle some of the state's most vexing problems, to take the lead on a 
dilemma that has confounded the Legislature, county governments, business, 
labor, consumers and the health care industry for years. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of the program, so far unspecified, would be funded mostly out of 
existing tobacco tax revenues, Medi-Cal funds and money now going to the 
counties to care for the working poor. Some new federal money and a new tax, 
payable by employees, on certain health insurance benefits would also be used 
to fund the program. 
</P>
<P>
An outline of the proposal was presented to Deukmejian at a Cabinet meeting 
Wednesday. The draft is to be reviewed by a task force of legislators and 
special-interest representatives for a month before it is released in its final 
form. Then, presumably, it will go to Deukmejian for final approval, be crafted 
as legislation and subjected to hearings in the Assembly and Senate. It may 
require action from Congress before it can be put into place. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on how it would be implemented, the Administration plan could in the 
end provide much of its health coverage by expanding the state's Medi-Cal 
program -- a potential pitfall for the proposal. Medi-Cal is already criticized 
for underpaying physicians to the point that ever fewer doctors will care for 
the poor. 
</P>
<P>
However, the plan would increase Medi-Cal reimbursement rates by an average of 
15%, an action considered necessary to entice more doctors into providing 
service to the poor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Skeptical Reaction 
</P>
<P>
The plan's possible reliance on the Medi-Cal system provoked skepticism from 
Lois Salisbury, chairwoman of Health Access, a statewide coalition of consumer 
and labor groups that supports a much more expansive program to guarantee 
health care to every resident of the state. Even with subsidies included in the 
plan, most families earning less than $30,000 still would not be able to afford 
health insurance, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Administration is to be commended for wanting to achieve such a broad 
goal," Salisbury said. "But this is a massive effort to make a silk purse out 
of a sow's ear." 
</P>
<P>
Others familiar with the proposal suggested that the plan would make a credible 
start on what would probably be months of negotiations in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Coker, a health care expert for the County Supervisors Assn. of 
California, described the proposal as "intellectual." 
</P>
<P>
"They have given enough to everybody but at the same time taken something 
away," she said. "I don't think anybody will embrace it. But anybody who just 
summarily rejects it will be foolish." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Thompson, Speaker Brown's top aide on health care issues, was supportive. 
"In principle, I endorse it," he said. "It is a very major policy step. In many 
ways, it goes beyond what we tried to accomplish a year ago." 
</P>
<P>
The Administration proposal would apply to every business -- extending even to 
the self-employed -- and would cover the dependents of working people. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal does not mandate that companies offer health insurance, but it 
contains a provision designed to compel the same result. Under the plan, any 
business that did not provide insurance for its workers would be liable to pay 
every dollar of medical expenses incurred by its employees and their 
dependents. 
</P>
<P>
The minimum benefit package would include doctors' visits, hospital care for up 
to 30 days per year, drug prescriptions, prenatal and maternity services, 
limited mental health coverage and preventive health and dental care for 
children, including immunizations. 
</P>
<P>
This package is expected to cost an average of about $105 per month for each 
employee served by a health maintenance organization, or HMO, and $128 for 
private, fee-for-service insurance coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Of that amount, employers would have to pay 75%, while workers would provide 
the other 25%. The cost of insurance for dependents of employees would be split 
evenly between the firm and the worker. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing would stop a company from providing more generous coverage or paying 
more than its minimum share of the premium. But employees would have to pay tax 
on a portion of any employer contribution beyond the minimum required package 
of benefits. The new tax might generate as much as $150 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the cost to small businesses would be offset by a tax credit of $15 per 
month per employee for companies with 25 or fewer workers. Further subsidies 
would be provided for companies with profits of less than $2,000 per employee. 
</P>
<P>
For workers earning less than twice the federal poverty rate -- $24,200 for a 
family of four -- the government would subsidize insurance premiums at a rate 
equal to 40% of what it would cost the state to insure the workers under the 
Medi-Cal program. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the proposal would: 
</P>
<P>
* Provide that, if health care costs increase at a rate greater than the 
consumer price index, any employer or employee could voluntarily enroll in the 
state-run Medi-Cal program, now reserved for the poor. Because doctors under 
Medi-Cal are paid significantly less than they charge on the open market, this 
provision is seen as an incentive for physicians to hold down costs, keeping as 
many patients as possible in privately paid health insurance plans. 
</P>
<P>
* Require that all patients treated under Medi-Cal agree to submit claims of 
medical malpractice to binding arbitration rather than going to court. In 
addition, physicians who provide emergency care with no expectation of being 
paid for their services would be immune from legal liability.

BUSH TO PROPOSE $1.1 BILLION IN AID TO PANAMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush today will announce a $1.1-billion package of aid to Panama 
designed to help the country recover from the pre-Christmas U.S. invasion and 
to resuscitate its crippled economy after 21 months under American economic 
sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
Officials cautioned that the proposal, developed in secret by the National 
Security Council, still has not won final approval from the President and could 
well be changed slightly at the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
However, senior officials briefed key members of Congress on the plan late 
Wednesday and said they expect it to remain essentially intact. 
</P>
<P>
A White House official said Wednesday that the Administration will seek 
congressional approval for $500 million in new cash aid in a supplemental 
budget request later this year, rather than including it in the fiscal 1991 
budget that Bush will send to Congress next Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining $600 million would come in the form of trade benefits, loans and 
loan guarantees and incentives to increase private investment by U.S. firms, 
which have little impact on federal spending levels. 
</P>
<P>
The program includes these elements: 
</P>
<P>
 -- $45 million to $50 million in emergency humanitarian aid to help 
Panamanians recover from the looting that followed the invasion, rebuild 
shattered homes and businesses and provide welfare payments to the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 -- $500 million in direct cash assistance, first to inject new cash into 
Panama's once-flourishing banking system, which was strangled by the U.S. 
economic sanctions, and second to finance major public works projects designed 
to restart the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 -- $500 million worth of medium-term help designed to get Panama's economy 
moving again. These range from credits for agricultural goods to loans and 
guarantees for trade and investment and restoration of trade benefits cut when 
the sanctions were imposed. 
</P>
<P>
The latter include duty-free status for Panamanian exports, revival of Panama's 
allocation under the U.S. sugar-import program and renewed participation in the 
Caribbean Basin Initiative, which grants tariff cuts for basic imports here. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the two countries will begin fast-track negotiations on an 
investment treaty that could prompt increased investment in Panama by American 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
The public works projects would have two goals -- to rebuild the country's 
deteriorated infrastructure, including roads, bridges, highways and schools, 
and to create new jobs so as to relieve unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
About $125 million of direct cash assistance would help bring Panama up to date 
in its payments to the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank -- a 
prerequisite to obtaining further loans from those institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Washington also will try to get other industrialized countries to contribute to 
the effort and may provide a temporary bridge loan to tide Panama over until 
International Monetary Fund and World Bank loans actually are disbursed. 
</P>
<P>
Panama is $540 million in arrears on payments to the World Bank and 
Inter-American Development Bank. Its debts to commercial banks, not covered by 
the package that is to be announced today, would be negotiated separately. 
</P>
<P>
The package outlined Wednesday is similar to the $1.5 billion in aid requested 
by the government of newly installed Panamanian President Guillermo Endara. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials said the approach taken in the package -- that is, 
providing so much in trade preferences and other indirect assistance -- was 
based on the belief that Panama already has a viable economic structure. 
</P>
<P>
"They're politically stable, so they're going to be getting this stuff 
automatically," one said. "Look at it as a jump start. That's what they need. 
Then they're off and running on their own. The very presence of the (Panama) 
Canal is a stabilizing factor." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, officials conceded the job may be more difficult 
than some might have expected, partly because Panama's banking sector -- which 
provided a hefty portion of the country's overall earnings -- had made so much 
of its income from drug-related money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
One official said that what has been missing most is the political stability 
and U.S. economic backing needed to restore confidence among international 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope this will go a way toward reviving some of that," one well-placed 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
The official said the Administration had been prepared to present the program 
Wednesday but delayed for a day to review it with congressional leaders. He 
said the leaders appeared "pretty happy with it" and promised prompt action. 
</P>
<P>
Bush was expected to issue proclamations today certifying that Panama is 
respecting human rights and is cooperating in the war against drugs, required 
under U.S. law before Washington can resume aid to Panama. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional leaders declined to speculate late Wednesday how soon the aid 
package would be passed. But officials noted that the notion of aiding Panama 
is popular on Capitol Hill, particularly in the wake of the U.S. success in 
deposing strongman Manuel A. Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
They said they expected that lawmakers would give their approval within a 
couple of weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The Dec. 20 invasion more than doubled the 13,000 U.S. troops based in Panama 
and caused millions of dollars in damage to homes and other buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Endara said last week in an interview with senior editors and correspondents of 
The Times that without sufficient economic aid for his government, the effort 
put into toppling Noriega will have been a waste. 
</P>
<P>
"For us, the United States' reaction is slow, very slow," Endara said. His 
government was seeking $1.5 billion to help it recover not only from the 
invasion but also from the economic wreckage left by the two-year American 
effort to oust Noriega.

13 INITIATIVES ARE QUALIFIED FOR JUNE BALLOT, INCLUDING 8 FROM LEGISLATURE 
</P>

<P>
California voters will be asked to decide at least 13 ballot propositions in 
the June primary election, Secretary of State March Fong Eu announced on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The long list includes eight measures placed there by the Legislature, with 
five others qualified by voter petition signatures. 
</P>
<P>
Although today is the official deadline for measures to qualify for the ballot, 
the deadline is routinely extended for measures initiated by the Legislature. 
Gov. George Deukmejian and members of the Legislature are still negotiating on 
millions of dollars worth of proposed bond issues. 
</P>
<P>
These funds would be spent for such items as school construction, prisons and 
earthquake safety. Eu said she hopes the bond issue bills will be enacted by 
Feb. 1 to be in time to get on the June ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The last of the voter petition measures to qualify on Wednesday is a 
reapportionment reform measure backed by San Mateo County Supervisor Tom 
Heuning and the League of Women Voters. It would create a 12-member commission 
that, though not empowered to draw its own reapportionment plan, would choose 
from among legislative and congressional districts plans submitted to it by 
private citizens. 
</P>
<P>
The commission would be composed of five Democrats, five Republicans and two 
members not registered in either party. They would be chosen by a panel of 
three retired appellate court judges. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative also would establish a list of strict standards by which the 
legislative districts are drawn based on federal 10-year census figures. 
</P>
<P>
That task is now accomplished by the Legislature with the majority party 
drawing the districts, with an eye toward maintaining control from census to 
census. 
</P>
<P>
A second reapportionment initiative will also be on the ballot. Backed by Marin 
County businessman Gary Flynn, it would require a two-thirds vote of the 
Legislature plus voter ratification of any legislative redistricting plan. 
</P>
<P>
The other petition measures would: 
</P>
<P>
* Make state law on the rights of defendants with tougher federal statutes and 
speed up criminal trials. 
</P>
<P>
* Authorize a $1.9-billion rail transportation bond issue. 
</P>
<P>
* Establish a $30-million wildlife fund to protect endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
Among the measures put on the ballot by the Legislature, the biggest-ticket 
item is an $18.5-billion transportation improvement plan. The transportation 
plan, which represents a delicate compromise reached by Deukmejian and 
Democratic and Republican legislative leaders last summer, also would increase 
the state spending limit. If approved, the measure would raise state gas taxes 
-- presently 9 cents a gallon -- by another 5 cents a gallon next August, then 
by another 1 cent a year until 1994. 
</P>
<P>
The seven other measures placed on the ballot by the Legislature would: 
</P>
<P>
* Reform legislative ethics rules. It could also pave the way for a pay raise 
for legislators by creating an independent commission empowered to set 
legislative salaries. 
</P>
<P>
* Issue $150 million in bonds for housing and homeless relief. 
</P>
<P>
* Issue a $1-billion rail bond issue, which is a competing proposal to the rail 
measure put on the ballot through the petition route. 
</P>
<P>
* Extend the time period for the governor to act on bills passed by the 
Legislature at the end of the first year of two-year sessions from 12 to 30 
days. 
</P>
<P>
* Allow severly disabled property owners to maintain the same tax rates when 
changing residences within the same county. 
</P>
<P>
* Increase minimum fines for violations of the state chiropractic law. 
</P>
<P>
* Make a technical change in the law, allowing revision of classes of peace 
officers on a list of special-circumstance murders calling for the death 
penalty.

CAL/OSHA NOT DOING ITS JOB, CRITICS CHARGE; 
</P>
<P>
SAFETY: THEY QUESTION THE GOVERNOR'S COMMITMENT TO RESTORING AN AGENCY THAT HE 
LARGELY DISMANTLED.

<P>
Despite a 1988 ballot initiative that restored funding for Cal/OSHA, the 
state's workplace safety agency is making 24% fewer inspections than it was 
three years ago, before Gov. George Deukmejian dismantled much of the program. 
</P>
<P>
Although Cal/OSHA was supposed to return to its previous level of strength by 
last October, it continues to operate with substantially fewer people than it 
had before the cuts, according to figures released Wednesday by Cal/OSHA 
officials at a legislative hearing. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing, called by two Democratic lawmakers highly critical of the agency, 
drew testimony from numerous labor and workplace safety advocates who accused 
the Deukmejian Administration of sabotaging Cal/OSHA's restoration. 
</P>
<P>
Critics said Cal/OSHA has less experienced personnel than it previously had, 
has failed to draft a formal plan of attacking workplace safety violations and 
is too timid about stepping into new areas of concern such as the 
repetitive-stress injuries caused by improper use of video display terminals. 
</P>
<P>
The complaints mirrored those of disgruntled legislators who last year 
introduced numerous bills to force Cal/OSHA to more aggressively adopt tougher 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
After several years of reducing Cal/OSHA's budget, Deukmejian in 1987 
eliminated the agency's budget for private-industry inspections, forcing the 
federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration to assume responsibility. 
Voters rebuked the governor by passing Proposition 97 the following year. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration's commitment to restoring Cal/OSHA has been questioned 
because the governor gave two key jobs to men who signed the sample ballot 
argument against Proposition 97. One of them, Robert Stranberg, a longtime 
official in the state Department of Industrial Relations, which oversees 
Cal/OSHA, was appointed head of Cal/OSHA in mid-1988. 
</P>
<P>
The other, John T. Hay, a former longtime president of the California Chamber 
of Commerce, was appointed last September to the sole "public representative" 
seat on the seven-member Cal/OSHA board of standards, which can create or amend 
state workplace health and safety regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner, one of the few prosecutors in the 
nation with a separate unit that prosecutes work safety violations, said at 
Wednesday's hearing that the Administration "seems to be trying to accomplish 
indirectly what they could not accomplish directly." 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), who co-chaired the joint legislative 
hearing as chairman of the Assembly Labor and Employment Committee, suggested 
to Stranberg that he could be considered "not even a caretaker (of Cal/OSHA) 
but a mortician." 
</P>
<P>
Stranberg, however, said, "We think we're doing pretty well." 
</P>
<P>
Stranberg said the rebuilding of the agency, which has a $23-million budget, 
has been hindered because hundreds of staff members took other jobs after 
Deukmejian's budget cuts, and the agency had to move many staff members and 
files from its San Francisco headquarters after last October's earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Figures comparing the fourth quarter of 1986 to the fourth quarter of last year 
showed that inspections made in response to public complaints are up about 15%, 
but inspections in response to accidents are down approximately 20% and 
"discretionary" inspections -- visits made to keep tabs on the more dangerous 
workplaces -- have fallen by two-thirds, to 568 from 1,749.

PUC GETS ENERGY-SAVING PLAN WITH BUILT-IN BONUS FOR ALL; 
</P>
<P>
CONSERVATION: APPROVAL EXPECTED IN MARCH ON COALITION'S PROPOSAL TO BENEFIT 
BOTH CONSUMERS AND UTILITY FIRMS.

<P>
A proposal to spend $550 million on energy-efficient products and techniques, 
boosting California back into a lead role in conservation, was unveiled at the 
state Public Utilities Commission on Wednesday by a coalition of utility, 
environmental, consumer and industrial groups. 
</P>
<P>
If approved, the innovative plan would, by 1991, double the amount California's 
four big utility companies spend on conservation and would put rebate money in 
the pockets of homeowners, businesses and industries for installing a wide 
range of futuristic energy-saving devices. Proponents said Californians also 
would save more than $1 billion in lower energy bills, most of it in this 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
The PUC is expected to approve the plan in March. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a win-win situation for consumers, utility companies and for the state 
and the nation," said Southern California Edison Corp. chairman and CEO Howard 
P. Allen, who predicted that the plan will spark a national move toward 
aggressive energy-efficiency programs. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called "blueprint" for energy-efficiency was requested by the PUC last 
July, after a study by an environmental group, the Natural Resources Defense 
Council, revealed that California utilities had slashed conservation programs 
in half since the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Pointing to problems of global warming and pollution and to the competition 
California businesses have with energy-efficient Japan, the PUC ordered 
interested groups to work out a consensus on how to revive lagging conservation 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe we will look back on this as a milepost . . . that significantly 
advances the economy of (California)," said PUC Commissioner Frederick P. Duda 
on hearing the proposal. "We have some countries to catch up with that are 
twice as efficient (in energy use.)" 
</P>
<P>
The environment will be another big winner, said Ralph Cavanagh of the Natural 
Resources Defense Council. "We won't try to assign a dollar value to the 
environmental benefits but they are very, very significant," Cavanagh said, 
pointing to expected reductions in burning of fossil fuels. 
</P>
<P>
Several participants said it required unprecedented cooperation for groups as 
different as utilities and consumer groups to come up with the plan. 
</P>
<P>
"This process has never occurred anywhere," said John Phillips of the 
California Energy Coalition, representing large power consumers. "For the first 
time in my life in this work, I have seen divergent viewpoints dealt with . . . 
around a table rather than in litigation." 
</P>
<P>
The broad-based support produced a host of proposals almost unthinkable a short 
time ago, participants said. They include the following: 
</P>
<P>
* Utilities will be assured a profit when they promote programs that result in 
reduced energy demands. The utilities will return most of the savings created 
by conservation to consumers, but will keep a portion for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
* Utilities will give incentives to commercial and residential builders to 
construct offices, factories and homes that go beyond California's already 
tough energy-efficiency standards. State-of-the art technology, such as 
insulating windows, low-energy lamps and polarized lighting are just some of 
the innovations. 
</P>
<P>
* Rebates to consumers will be offered on a wide range of proven, but long 
ignored devices, such as light bulbs that last 10 times as long as normal, but 
use only one-quarter the energy. Such bulbs currently cost $11.50 each. 
</P>
<P>
* A number of unique test programs will be launched, including one by the 
Southern California Gas Co. to "super-weatherize" a sampling of homes in the 
Los Angeles area to determine how far energy bills can be reduced. Two 
California companies already have documented savings of 30% to 50% when a 
typical, older California home is heavily weatherized and insulated. 
</P>
<P>
But even bigger savings are expected from programs aimed at new construction. 
In trying to construct buildings as inexpensively as possible, builders often 
create energy-guzzling structures that ultimately cost far more, said Edison 
spokesman Ziyad Awad. 
</P>
<P>
"Once a building goes up, without energy-efficient planning, it is essentially 
a lost opportunity," Awad said. 
</P>
<P>
With the various proposals, every dollar spent on energy-efficient materials 
and techniques will save consumers or businesses $1.60 to $4, said John Fox, 
manager of market planning for Pacific Gas &amp; Electric in Northern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
"We're frankly confident that all the new programs will work," said Fox. "If 
the public accepts it, we are on our way."

STATE AUDIT BLASTS OAKLAND SCHOOL DISTRICT; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: REPORT CITES WIDESPREAD FRAUD AND INCOMPETENCE. STUDY DETAILS 'THE 
MOST PERVASIVE SET OF PROBLEMS WE'VE EVER FOUND.'

In an extraordinarily blunt report, the state auditor general charged Wednesday 
that the troubled Oakland Unified School District knowingly hired a convicted 
drug user, paid administrators for days they did not work or degrees they had 
not earned and granted an inflated contract to an underqualified consultant. 
</P>
<P>
The two-volume audit also found that California's sixth-largest school district 
borders on financial collapse, even though administrators failed to apply for 
millions in grants that would have helped them rebuild schools, remove asbestos 
and improve student reading skills. 
</P>
<P>
"They have got to change the status quo," Acting Auditor General Kurt R. 
Sjoberg said as he released the report. He added that in Oakland, auditors 
discovered "the most pervasive set of problems we've ever found" in any of the 
state's school districts. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland School Superintendent Richard P. Mesa, who took over on Jan. 1 with a 
mandate to clean up the district, vowed in written responses to the audit to 
comply with the recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Siegel, general counsel to the school district and part of the new 
administration, said the audit "helps us because it gives us the moral support 
to make the needed changes." Assemblyman Elihu M. Harris, the Oakland Democrat 
who commissioned the audit, held out hope that the lesson for the district's 
53,000 students is that "we are vigilant. We may be a little bit slow, but our 
major priority is their education." 
</P>
<P>
Harris, who is running for mayor of Oakland, said the audit showed that within 
the district, "People started taking. There was no check and balance. Everybody 
felt it was whatever you could get away with. That was the rule." 
</P>
<P>
Prompted by Harris, the Legislature took the unprecedented step last year of 
passing legislation seizing control of the district from the school board. A 
state-appointed trustee is trying to pull the district out of its financial 
straits. 
</P>
<P>
In the face of the district's problems, three of seven school board members 
have said they will step down this year. Elections for the open seats are set 
for June. 
</P>
<P>
The audit mentions no names, but portrays a school system run on the basis of 
political patronage. Amounts of money involved in questionable expenditures 
were small, but many district employees took their cuts, according to the 
audit. 
</P>
<P>
The auditors found one administrator was paid $5,400 for 16 days that he did 
not work. Other administrators received bonuses of up to $2,575 a year by 
claiming they had obtained doctoral degrees they had not earned. 
</P>
<P>
One English teacher received $10,919 in extra pay over a period of years, 
partly because he obtained credit from the district toward a post-graduate 
degree simply for reading books and maps before embarking on a trip to London, 
Paris, Barcelona and elsewhere, according to the audit. The teacher promised to 
bring back pictures and brochures. 
</P>
<P>
School officials paid nearly $250,000 to consultants without knowing whether 
the services were ever received, the audit found. The district hired a firm at 
$652,000 to study asbestos removal, even though the company was the "least 
qualified, most costly contractor," the audit said. 
</P>
<P>
The audit found the district paid $1,000 last year in sick leave to an 
elementary school custodian who, in fact, missed work because he was in jail -- 
on drug possession charges. According to the audit, the district hired the 
janitor despite knowing he had been convicted previously on drug charges, as 
well as on forgery and burglary charges. State education law prohibits people 
with drug convictions from being hired. 
</P>
<P>
Citing such personnel practices, the audit said the district "may have allowed 
its students to be exposed to drugs, has allowed itself to be vulnerable to 
theft and has overpaid $124,000 to six administrators unnecessarily." 
</P>
<P>
The report, noting that the district must reduce spending, said it would have 
had a deficit of $1.8 million in the 1988-89 year but for an unexpected 
windfall in state lottery money and other revenue. The audit also said the 
district could have received $120 million in state aid simply by applying for a 
variety of grants in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
In a continuing investigation unrelated to the audit, 13 district officials and 
employees have been arrested. Three of the 13 have pleaded guilty to receiving 
stolen property or grand theft

PERES OPTIMISTIC ABOUT PALESTINIAN TALKS; 
</P>
<P>
MIDDLE EAST: ISRAELI VICE PREMIER LIKES PROSPECTS FOR PEACE. BUT U.S. SECRETARY 
OF STATE BAKER IS LESS HOPEFUL.

Stepping up the pressure on hard-liners in his government, Israeli Vice Prime 
Minister Shimon Peres said Wednesday that obstacles to a dialogue between 
Israelis and Palestinians "can be solved rather swiftly" and predicted that 
prospects for peace in the region are "more promising than ever before." 
</P>
<P>
After meeting with President Hosni Mubarak and other top Egyptian officials, 
Peres said that a series of new proposals have increased the chances that 
Israel can agree on the composition of a Palestinian delegation and an agenda 
for the talks, two of the most troubling issues stalling agreement on a formal 
dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
Peres, who is also Israel's minister of finance and head of its Labor Party, 
told reporters: "Before too long, there is a real chance that a Palestinian and 
Israeli delegation will meet in Cairo to discuss the issue of elections and the 
beginning of meaningful negotiations between the two parties. We should not 
lose sight that we have an opportunity that should not be missed, and a growing 
feeling in the Middle East . . . that peace is needed for all of us." 
</P>
<P>
However, in Washington, Secretary of State James A. Baker III discounted 
chances for a breakthrough in Middle East peace efforts, wire services 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure that I would have used the characterization that Mr. Peres used," 
Baker told reporters Wednesday after talks with President Ali Abdullah Saleh of 
Yemen. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm encouraged as a result of the meetings we had here in Washington last week 
. . . (but) I'm not sure that I'm that encouraged. I think we still have a 
pretty good ways to go," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
Peres came to Cairo as a senior member of the Israeli government but without 
authorization to speak on behalf of the entire coalition. Indeed, Prime 
Minister Yitzhak Shamir, through a spokesman on Tuesday, rejected similar 
positive predictions from Peres, denying that any agreement is at hand. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the talks said it is likely that Peres will use the Egyptian 
visit to step up pressure on Shamir's hard-line Likud Party, which has resisted 
attempts to include Palestinians from outside the Israeli-occupied West Bank 
and Gaza Strip in the Palestinian delegation as well as attempts by the 
Palestinians to use the dialogue to discuss the future of a possible state. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Peres threatened to pull his Labor Party out of the fragile 
coalition government unless the deadlock were overcome. And sources close to 
Wednesday's talks said Peres emerged convinced that the inclusion of deportees 
from the territories in the Palestinian delegation should not remain a 
stumbling block, even if it means renewing his threat to withdraw from the 
coalition. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Peres nor Egyptian officials elaborated on the new proposals discussed 
during Peres' two-hour meeting with Mubarak. But they likely were linked to 
reports that Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, in meetings last week in the 
United States, proposed participation of one or two Palestinian deportees from 
the territories who are not members of the Palestine Liberation Organization 
and who have no record of guerrilla violence. 
</P>
<P>
PLO officials in Cairo, who asked not to be identified, said the PLO probably 
would not object to such conditions. 
</P>
<P>
However, the PLO has insisted on maintaining control over any Palestinian 
delegation, and Peres emphasized Wednesday that it is still Israel's policy 
that the delegation to Cairo "should be a non-PLO delegation representing 
people who reside in the territories and not people who are active outside the 
territories." 
</P>
<P>
However, he added: "In my judgment, the Palestinian delegation is free, and can 
be free to consult with whomever they want. It's none of our business. . . . "

AMERICAN KILLED BY GUNMAN IN PANAMA; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME WAVE: A SPREE OF ATTACKS AND ROBBERIES IS 'MUCH WORSE' THAN UNDER 
NORIEGA, AN OFFICIAL SAYS.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A senior American employee of the Panama Canal Commission was killed Wednesday 
in the latest in a series of brazen attacks that have pushed the rate of 
violent crime here to levels unknown under the regime of Manuel A. Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said they could detect no political motive behind the murder of the 
commission's acting financial officer, William J. Joyce, who was shot by a 
masked intruder Tuesday night during a theft of guns and jewelry from his home 
near the mouth of the Panama Canal. 
</P>
<P>
The attack came less than two days after a similarly violent assault on another 
U.S. citizen in the same neighborhood. It added to a spree of assaults and 
thievery that has included incidents in which teams of men armed with automatic 
weapons made off with $100,000 during a daylight bank robbery and forced 
terrorized patrons at two posh restaurants to hand over their money and 
jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with The Times, the commander of the new Panamanian Public 
Force, Col. Eduardo Herrera Hassan, blamed the extraordinary wave of violence 
on what he said are hundreds of dangerous criminals who remain at large after 
being freed from Panamanian jails during the U.S. invasion. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. official said an additional 300 former Panamanian soldiers who have not 
yet been accounted for also could represent a serious criminal threat. 
</P>
<P>
While no comparative statistics are available, Herrera declared in an interview 
that the rate of assaults, murders and other crimes in recent weeks has been 
"much worse" than under the Noriega regime. He complained that his troops' 
effectiveness in rounding up fugitives and countering the crime wave has been 
limited by government restrictions that prohibit them from carrying rifles or 
other automatic weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The new indication of a more dangerous Panama contrasts with the image of 
tranquillity painted by U.S. officials. American military police continue to 
patrol the streets in jeeps while shifting much of their authority back to 
their Panamanian counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
The outbreak of violence, in a nation in which the brutality of the old 
Noriega-led Panama Defense Forces deterred much street crime, raises new 
questions about the consequences of the tentatively planned U.S. withdrawal of 
its troops from the capital by next Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The warning by Herrera of the dangers posed by the roaming convicts provided 
the first official accounts of how little success U.S. and Panamanian 
authorities have had in rounding up the inmates who were set free during the 
invasion. 
</P>
<P>
In the city of Colon alone, Herrera said, 389 of the 400 prisoners let go by 
the Panamanian prison warden remain at large. Indicating that the problem is of 
similar gravity across Panama, he declared: "The great majority of the 
prisoners who were freed during the invasion have not been captured." 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. source said that in addition to those who escaped from Colon, at least 
250 more convicts are still on the lam, including 104 of the 160 prisoners who 
fled the notorious Coiba Island penal colony while American troops were taking 
control of the facility. Among the remainder, the source said, are more than 
100 who escaped from the Carcel Modelo jail in Panama City. 
</P>
<P>
Herrera made his comments about the connection between escaped prisoners and 
crime before the shooting of Joyce occurred. Sources close to the investigation 
said Wednesday night there was no indication that an escaped convict was 
responsible for the attack. 
</P>
<P>
The attack made Joyce the first American to be killed in Panama since the 
invasion, which claimed the lives of 23 U.S. soldiers and three civilians, as 
well as 202 Panamanians. A Panama Canal Commission spokeswoman said, however, 
that the close-knit community of about 2,700 American employees has suffered 
from an unusual outbreak of muggings and other crimes against U.S. employees 
since the invasion, and she reported that environmental control officer David 
Baerg had been assaulted and robbed by an intruder in his home at daybreak 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
According to an account provided by the spokeswoman, Willie K. Friar, the 
attack on Joyce occurred Tuesday evening when a young Panamanian man rang the 
doorbell of the American's home in the affluent La Boca neighborhood and asked 
for Joyce's son by name. 
</P>
<P>
When Mildred Joyce, the victim's wife, opened the door, a second man, wearing a 
mask and wielding a revolver, emerged from a hiding place and the two entered 
the home together. As Joyce rose from his living-room chair, the gunman shot 
him in the chest.

HOPES FOR DEMOCRACY DIM IN HAITI; 
</P>
<P>
CARIBBEAN: A STATE OF SIEGE IS IN EFFECT. THIS HAS ALL BUT SPOILED CHANCES OF 
FAIR ELECTIONS THIS YEAR.

PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hope for democracy in Haiti has faded to a dim flicker after a harsh crackdown 
by the country's provisional military government, Haitian and foreign analysts 
say. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, the president, used dictatorial powers last weekend to 
declare a state of siege, impose censorship and persecute political and civic 
leaders. Dozens have been arrested, some have been severely beaten, and at 
least five have been deported. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the government actions have all but destroyed the possibility that 
elections scheduled for this year by Avril could be considered free and fair. 
</P>
<P>
"He's looking like a dictator," said one foreign diplomat. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that things are spoiled," another said. "How can you trust that guy, 
who imposes a state of siege for no real reason except to enforce his power?" 
</P>
<P>
Avril is now under strong international pressure to end the repression and 
guarantee open elections. U.S. Ambassador Alvin P. Adams met with the general 
this week and "made it crystal clear that we deplore and are outraged by what 
has happened here," Adams told foreign reporters Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope that ways can be found . . . to restore and enhance confidence in the 
electoral process," the ambassador said. 
</P>
<P>
But the consensus among other diplomats and Haitian analysts interviewed this 
week was that any future democratic gesture by Avril probably would lack the 
credibility needed for unfettered elections. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that at this stage the best solution would be to get Avril out of 
power," said a Haitian political scientist. Asked how, he said: "Pray to God." 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday afternoon, unconfirmed rumors of an army coup plot against Avril 
circulated in Port-au-Prince. Some downtown stores closed early as fear of 
trouble spread, but nothing happened. 
</P>
<P>
Since the state of siege was declared Saturday, the city has been peaceful, 
with no signs of rebellious military activity. Repression by the army and 
police was severe over the weekend, however. By one diplomatic tally, security 
forces detained nearly 80 people, later releasing most of them. 
</P>
<P>
Presidential hopeful Hubert de Ronceray and Gerard Brun, another politician, 
were among those beaten and deported. Some of the beatings reportedly took 
place in the white-domed presidential palace where Avril lives and works. 
</P>
<P>
Politicians have gone into hiding, and some who are overseas are unsure of 
whether they may return. Avril decreed the suspension of several constitutional 
guarantees, including one ensuring the right of Haitians to return to their 
country without visas. 
</P>
<P>
He also imposed censorship on radio broadcasts, the main vehicle for news in 
Haiti. Independent stations suspended all news programs Tuesday because of an 
official order requiring that news material be submitted to the government for 
prior approval. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't work. We can't say anything," a radio reporter said. "The threats are 
getting stronger and stronger." 
</P>
<P>
The radio news blackout was the most severe since the country was ruled by 
President Jean-Claude (Baby Doc) Duvalier. On Feb. 7, Haiti will mark the 
fourth anniversary of the day that ended 29 years of dictatorship by Duvalier 
and his father, Francois. The son stepped down and fled the country in 1986 
after months of popular rebellion against him. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Elections Pledged 
</P>
<P>
Last September, Avril, who had taken power a year earlier, promised elections 
for 1990. This month, he approved a calendar setting municipal elections for 
late April, two rounds of legislative elections for July and August, and the 
first round of presidential elections for October, with a runoff in November. 
</P>
<P>
But signs of authoritarian excess by Avril already have been clear for months. 
In November, authorities arrested and beat three major political figures, 
refusing them medical and legal aid for several days. 
</P>
<P>
"It showed that the guy was becoming meaner and meaner," one diplomat observed. 
</P>
<P>
In November, gunmen with Uzi assault guns killed three partisans of former 
President Leslie F. Manigat who were posting signs calling for Manigat's return 
to power.

Knowledgeable diplomatic sources say hundreds of civilian security agents have 
been recruited to work with the 1,200-member Presidential Guard, the main 
fighting unit of the army, since last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the agents, called "attaches," are former members of the Tontons 
Macoutes, the brutal political police of the Duvalier regime, the diplomatic 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
While Avril was on an official trip to Taiwan this month, opposition 
politicians issued an unsuccessful call for a general strike and said the 
general need not return. A group called the Civic Society for the Defense of 
the Constitution sent a telex to the government of Taiwan saying that any 
agreements made with the visiting delegation would not be binding on the 
Haitian people. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition maneuvers and the telex, published in the Taiwanese press, 
apparently infuriated Avril. To those who sent the telex, Avril said on his 
return: "You are betraying the Haitian people." 
</P>
<P>
On Friday morning, unidentified gunmen killed Andre Neptune, an obscure colonel 
in the Presidential Guard, along with his wife and a servant. The Saturday 
announcement of the state of siege alluded to that slaying and those of a radio 
announcer, political party members and some foreign residents and businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
"In view of this escalation of violence, the government, aware of its role as 
the guardian of public security and peace, will take all appropriate measures 
to end these destabilizing maneuvers that could compromise the democratic 
process," said a communique from the ministers of interior and information. 
</P>
<P>
Most independent analysts say the government crackdown is unnecessary and 
counterproductive, however. It resulted in a freeze on plans by the United 
States, Canada and France to begin resuming economic aid to Haiti, the poorest 
country in the hemisphere. The United States suspended aid after an aborted 
election in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
No clear reason has emerged for the crackdown, but theories abound. One 
speculates that it resulted from army infighting over graft and payoffs that 
military men are known to receive in return for their loyalty to the 
government. Neptune, the colonel killed Friday, is said to have been in charge 
of distributing cash and privileges to members of the presidential guard. 
</P>
<P>
Another says that Avril simply moved to consolidate his powers.

EL SALVADOR: GUERRILLAS LINK THE SLAYING OF TWO COMRADES TO A SECRET MEETING 
WITH U.S. SEN. DODD.

A secret meeting between U.S. Sen. Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.) and El 
Salvador's leftist guerrillas in Guatemala City earlier this month may have 
provoked the murder of a Salvadoran socialist by an alleged right-wing death 
squad, according to the rebels and civilian leftists. 
</P>
<P>
Dodd, a key liberal senator on Central American issues, met Jan. 10 at 
Guatemala City's Aurora International Airport with Ana Guadalupe Martinez and 
Roberto Canas, representatives of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front 
(FMLN), to discuss prospects for ending El Salvador's 10-year civil war, 
according to three sources. 
</P>
<P>
Two days later, Hector Oqueli Colindres, a leader of a small Salvadoran leftist 
party, was abducted along with a Guatemalan politician as they headed for the 
same airport. They were shot to death and their bodies dumped along the road to 
the Guatemalan border with El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
"We think there is a direct link," said Martinez, who confirmed the meeting 
took place. "We think it was the Salvadoran right (wing) operating with its 
network in Guatemala. . . . It was a warning from the right and the Salvadoran 
army that we were in their rear guard, in forbidden territory." 
</P>
<P>
Oqueli, 45, was deputy secretary general of the National Revolutionary Movement 
and a leader of the Socialist International in Latin America. His party is 
legal in El Salvador, and its secretary general, Guillermo Ungo, ran for 
president last year after returning from exile. 
</P>
<P>
But Ungo, Oqueli and a handful of other returned politicians have never 
formally broken a political alliance they made with the Marxist-led FMLN 
guerrillas while in exile, and many rightists consider them to be rebel fronts. 
The politicians have been pushing for negotiations between the government and 
the guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
Dodd spokesman Jason Isaacson refused to confirm or deny the meeting in 
Guatemala, although he confirmed that Dodd visited Guatemala during a weeklong 
swing through Central America on Jan. 4-11. Isaacson said the senator had met 
several times with Oqueli, but not on that trip. 
</P>
<P>
Three sources said Martinez and Canas arrived in Guatemala City to meet with 
Dodd on the morning of Jan. 10 and were received at the airport by a West 
European diplomat. At the airport, the rebels also ran into a prominent 
Salvadoran businessman who is a known extreme rightist. 
</P>
<P>
The hourlong talks with Dodd took place in a private room at the airport, after 
which Dodd left the country and the rebels were taken to a West European 
embassy, sources said. Martinez confirmed reports that the embassy began 
receiving threatening telephone calls within two hours of her arrival. Embassy 
officials could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez and Canas left Guatemala early Jan. 11; that day, Oqueli arrived from 
Mexico to stay overnight before catching a flight to Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
On the morning of Jan. 12, Gilda Flores, a Guatemalan leftist, was driving 
Oqueli to the airport when they were abducted by armed men in civilian dress. 
Their bodies were discovered that night in Jalpatagua, 60 miles east of 
Guatemala City. 
</P>
<P>
Oqueli's colleague, Guillermo Ungo, said he has information that Oqueli had 
been detained by immigration officials at the Guatemalan airport the day he 
arrived and believed he was followed from the airport. 
</P>
<P>
Some sources close to the rebels suggested the assailants may have been looking 
for Martinez. She declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Other observers said the killing might have been retribution for the November 
slaying of right-wing politician Francisco Jose Guerrero. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez admitted that FMLN guerrillas were responsible for assassinating 
Guerrero but insisted the killing was a mistake.

ANGOLAN GUERRILLAS SAY THEY BLUNTED REGIME'S OFFENSIVE

Pro-Western rebels in Angola have blunted a monthlong offensive by troops of 
the Marxist government, which is supported by Soviet advisers, the deputy chief 
of the insurgent organization said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"At this moment, the fighting continues, but the outcome is quite predictable," 
said Jeremias Chitunda, deputy to Jonas Savimbi, chief of the National Union 
for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA). 
</P>
<P>
He said government forces pushed to within about 20 miles of Mavinga, a town of 
about 13,000 that has long been held by the guerrillas. Chitunda said capture 
of the town would have put government troops within "striking distance" of 
UNITA's headquarters in Jamba, in southeastern Angola. 
</P>
<P>
He said government casualties have totaled 300 troops killed and 651 wounded 
since the offensive began the day before Christmas. He reported UNITA losses at 
62 dead and 300 wounded. 
</P>
<P>
Chitunda said about 100 Soviet advisers and technicians participated in the 
offensive. Earlier this month, the State Department said Soviet participation 
in the fighting marked a "dangerous escalation" in the 14-year Angolan civil 
war. 
</P>
<P>
Chitunda spoke to reporters during a visit to Washington to seek political 
support for the rebels. The Reagan Administration provided covert military aid 
to UNITA, but that aid is believed to have been cut off last year.

BUSH HOPES GORBACHEV, REFORMS SURVIVE; 
</P>
<P>
SUPERPOWERS: THE PRESIDENT CITES 'ENORMOUS DIMENSIONS' OF AZERBAIJANI PROBLEM 
BUT AVOIDS CRITICIZING CRACKDOWN.

<P>
President Bush refused comment Wednesday on whether Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev is in jeopardy because of the violent upheaval in Azerbaijan, but he 
said he firmly wants Gorbachev to survive and continue his reform policies. 
</P>
<P>
Asked at a wide-ranging morning news conference if Gorbachev has "gone too far" 
in cracking down with Soviet troops on Azerbaijani nationalists, Bush said: 
"The answer . . . unfolds every day. We don't really know. And it's serious." 
</P>
<P>
The President did not indicate any new approach toward Moscow in the wake of 
its use of force in the strife-torn region. He has broadly supported Soviet 
efforts to restore order in ethnic conflicts like that between Azerbaijanis and 
Armenians, while cautioning that forcible suppression of demonstrations for 
independence in the Baltic states would bring strong American criticism and 
might chill U.S.-Soviet relations. 
</P>
<P>
In the Azerbaijan insurrection, which began as an ethnic dispute but climaxed 
in pogroms against Armenians, Bush pointed out sympathetically that Gorbachev 
is "faced with . . . an internal problem of enormous dimensions." 
</P>
<P>
"I can't make any predictions," he said, "but I know I hope that he not only 
survives but stays strong, because I think it is in our interest that 
perestroika (Gorbachev's reform program) succeed and go forward." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Bush said the United States supports the Baltic states of 
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in their "independent pursuit of their own 
destiny." He said Gorbachev is "sorting out some very difficult internal 
problems in these three Baltic countries." 
</P>
<P>
The United States recognized the Soviet Union and its territorial integrity in 
1933, when Azerbaijan was already part of that country. The Baltic states were 
forcibly incorporated into it in 1940, after a secret Soviet-Nazi pact, and the 
United States has never recognized their annexation. 
</P>
<P>
In his recent visit to the Baltic region, Gorbachev appeared to hold out 
prospects that the three states could eventually secede -- but at the end of a 
long legal process, including a possible Soviet-wide referendum and the 
negotiated settlement of economic and other ties built up over the past 40 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to explain the differences between U.S. policy regarding the Baltic 
states and areas like Azerbaijan, Bush said: "I don't think it helps facilitate 
things for us to fine-tune all that. They know our position." The issue was 
discussed during the U.S.-Soviet summit in Malta last month, the President 
said. 
</P>
<P>
On another East-West issue, Bush turned a cold shoulder to a proposal by the 
new reform leader of Czechoslovakia, Vaclav Havel, for the next U.S.-Soviet 
summit to be held in his country. Havel's aim presumably is to demonstrate that 
Prague intends to become a neutral nation like Finland, where U.S. and Soviet 
leaders can meet, rather than remain part of the Soviet Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe that it's going to work for this summit," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
The next summit, set for late June in Washington, will deal with finishing work 
on various arms control agreements, including a treaty to reduce offensive 
nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The President, while expressing great respect for Havel, indicated that he did 
not want plans for his next meeting with Gorbachev to be changed in any way 
that might derail a successful outcome. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, State Department officials said that Secretary of State James A. 
Baker III will delay a scheduled visit to Moscow by one day because of an 
emergency meeting of the Soviet Communist Party's Central Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Baker originally was scheduled to visit Moscow Feb. 6 and 7. But the Soviet 
leadership has scheduled a meeting that week on the crisis in Azerbaijan and 
other areas, so Baker agreed to change his visit to Feb. 7 and 8. 
</P>
<P>
Baker's visit is intended to break several logjams in U.S.-Soviet arms control 
negotiations and to prepare for the June summit between Bush and Gorbachev.

IRAN STEPS UP ITS CRITICISM OF SOVIET ACTIONS IN AZERBAIJAN

Hard-line voices in Tehran on Wednesday notched up their criticism of the 
Soviet military crackdown in Azerbaijan, the Muslim-dominated republic on 
Iran's northern border. 
</P>
<P>
The morning after an open letter by members of the Iranian Parliament demanded 
that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev "deal with the Muslims of the Soviet 
Union with compassion," an editorial in the daily Kayhan International 
condemned Moscow's handling of the unrest. 
</P>
<P>
"What the (Soviet) empire is facing now is basically due to the nature by which 
it was created, namely annexations," the newspaper said. "Large parts of Iran 
in the north were separated into the Soviet empire." 
</P>
<P>
By contending that the 7 million Soviet Azerbaijanis were clipped off from 
Iranian Azerbaijan and its 9 million Muslims, the editorial raised border 
questions that Moscow and Tehran have both sought to suppress. 
</P>
<P>
Already stung by statements of the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's Shiite 
spiritual leader, and other Tehran leaders on the religious aspects of the 
turmoil among Soviet Azerbaijanis, Moscow officials were taking a harder tone 
too. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow Radio warned Iranian listeners: "Any unconsidered nationalistic or 
religious appeals would be dangerous. . . . Brutal and illusory nationalistic 
flights of fancy have dragged the people to the brink of the precipice." 
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, First Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander A. Bessmertnykh met 
Wednesday with the Iranian ambassador, Naser Heirany Nobari. The Soviet news 
agency Tass, reporting the meeting, gave no details on what was discussed. It 
said the two took up the border crisis and that Nobari delivered a note from 
Iranian authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Iran's ruling political circle has taken a cautious line on the Azerbaijani 
developments, supporting the religious rights of the Soviet Muslims but 
avoiding outright criticism of the crackdown itself and even expressing 
understanding of the need for control. 
</P>
<P>
The Tehran Times, which generally supports the line taken by President Hashemi 
Rafsanjani, has said that Iran seeks no change in the present borders. 
Rafsanjani himself has so far made no public comment on the situation.

BUSH SUPPORTS MOVE TO ELEVATE EPA TO CABINET; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: BACKERS SAY THAT THE CHANGE WILL ENHANCE THE AGENCY'S INFLUENCE. 
LAWMAKERS HOPE TO HAVE THE BILL TO THE PRESIDENT BY EARTH DAY.

WASHINGTON -- President Bush endorsed legislation Wednesday that would make the 
Environmental Protection Agency the 15th Cabinet-level department, and leaders 
of the drive told him they hope to have a bill ready for his signature by the 
April 22 observance of Earth Day. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference one day after the legislation was introduced in 
both the House and Senate, Bush told reporters he had concluded that 
environmental issues "are so important that they must be addressed at the 
highest level of government." 
</P>
<P>
His endorsement reflected a turnaround from his initial opposition to expanding 
the Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
The move is expected to have overwhelming support within Congress and the 
environmental community. Although the change would be largely symbolic, 
supporters said it would enhance the influence of the environmental agency and 
its administrator. 
</P>
<P>
"The President's endorsement means that the bill will now speed through the 
Congress," said Fred Krupp, executive director of the Environmental Defense 
Fund. "It has symbolic importance, certainly, but it is also substantive. By 
giving the EPA administrator a seat at the Cabinet table, there will be an 
environmental voice that will create a different kind of Cabinet dynamic." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio), a principal sponsor of the Senate bill, had been 
discussing the measure with Bush since last June in an effort to get the 
President's endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
The measure has bipartisan sponsorship in both houses of Congress. Sen. William 
V. Roth Jr. (R-Del.) joined Glenn in introducing the Senate version, and Reps. 
John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.) and Mike Synar (D-Okla.) joined Frank Horton 
(R-N.Y.) and William F. Clinger Jr. (R-Pa.) in offering a similar measure in 
the House. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA was created during a surge of public interest in environmental issues 
in 1970. After languishing during the early years of the Ronald Reagan 
Administration, the agency has come to exercise powerful influence as a 
watchdog and enforcer of clean air and water laws. 
</P>
<P>
EPA Administrator William K. Reilly often has attended meetings of the Bush 
Cabinet and has operated as a de facto member of the Administration's top 
policy councils. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the legislation said official Cabinet membership will mean that 
environmental considerations will be addressed sooner in national policy 
discussions and budget decisions. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, they said, the EPA will be positioned to deal more effectively 
with other government agencies, such as the Department of Energy, with which it 
has significant conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said the elevation probably would not result in a significant expansion 
of the agency or its functions. And while Bush's endorsement was warmly 
received, some lawmakers were quick to note that the step in itself would mean 
little unless the administrative rearrangement is accompanied by vigorous 
environmental policy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not enough to just pull an extra chair to the Cabinet table," said Sen. 
Albert Gore Jr. (D-Tenn). "This Administration has to prove this represents a 
substantive commitment to policy action, not just a new decorator at the White 
House." 
</P>
<P>
The legislation would make the EPA the 15th Cabinet agency, joining the 
departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education, Energy, Health and 
Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Justice, Labor, State, 
Transportation, Treasury and Veteran's Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to making the EPA a Cabinet-level department, the Glenn-Roth bill 
would create a Bureau of Environmental Statistics to collect, coordinate and 
resolve conflicts in environmental data and establish an interagency committee 
on global environmental change.

DYMALLY LINKED TO DIAMOND IMPORTER; 
</P>
<P>

LATER DONATED $34,200 TO CALIFORNIAN'S SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM.

Rep. Mervyn M. Dymally (D-Compton) took a leading role in the fight for stiff 
sanctions against South Africa in February, 1987, when he introduced 
legislation to ban U.S. imports of South African diamonds. 
</P>
<P>
He continued to support strong diamond sanctions as late as March, 1988. But in 
April of that year, Dymally changed course. Accepting arguments that his 
initial bill was unworkable and unfair, he proposed changes to pending 
sanctions legislation to weaken its impact on diamond importers in this 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Dymally's change of heart followed a meeting in his Washington office with New 
York diamond importer Maurice Tempelsman, a buyer of uncut South African 
diamonds whose business could have been crippled by stiff sanctions. The 
lawmaker offered an amendment drafted by Tempelsman's lobbyist, Howard Marlowe, 
according to Marlowe. The amendment, which effectively headed off such 
sanctions, was approved by the House Foreign Affairs Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Two months later, Tempelsman donated $34,200 to support a Dymally scholarship 
program for minority students. Later in 1988, after the donation, Dymally 
agreed to lobby his colleagues to support other changes that Tempelsman wanted 
in the sanctions bill. 
</P>
<P>
A Dymally aide solicited the donation from Tempelsman when his lobbyist first 
sought a meeting with Dymally to discuss diamond sanctions in April, 1988, 
according to an account by Marlowe. 
</P>
<P>
The House later approved a version of the amendment drafted by Marlowe and 
backed by Dymally. It called for a study of the enforceability of diamond 
sanctions and headed off the policy change that Tempelsman opposed: a 
requirement that importers of uncut diamonds certify that they did not come 
from South Africa. In March, Dymally had proposed just such a requirement. 
</P>
<P>
Two months after meeting with Dymally, Tempelsman donated $34,200 to the Ana G. 
Mendez Foundation that was used to fund the 1988 Mervyn M. Dymally Young 
Minority Scholars Program, according to Jose Mendez, foundation president. That 
was the amount suggested to Tempelsman in a prospectus sent to him by Amelia 
Parker, a Dymally aide. 
</P>
<P>
The Mendez foundation set aside part of Tempelsman's $34,200 to pay 
"honoraria," according to a 1988 foundation document. Dymally reported 
receiving a $2,000 honorarium from the Mendez foundation in July, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the gift financed trips by 14 minority students from Dymally's 
California congressional district to Puerto Rico for four weeks of academic 
work.

Dymally declined to be interviewed, and did not respond to repeated queries 
from a reporter this month. In response to a summary of this article delivered 
to him Tuesday, Dymally on Wednesday sent a one-page statement to the 
Washington Post in which he said he did not "solicit contributions from Mr. 
Tempelsman." 
</P>
<P>
Dymally also said that the amendment he backed to soften the sanctions was 
based on the unenforceability of diamond sanctions against South Africa, the 
opposition of other House members and a desire not to hurt Botswana, another 
African country that exports diamonds. 
</P>
<P>
According to House rules, members may not accept from a person with a direct 
interest in legislation "favors or benefits . . . under circumstances which 
might be construed by reasonable persons as influencing the performance of 
governmental duties." 
</P>
<P>
How to distinguish between behavior covered by this rule and ordinary 
cooperation with interest groups or constituents who also make political 
contributions or give honorariums to members is a matter of ongoing debate in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
In a five-page reply to questions about these events, Tempelsman wrote: "I do 
not fault Congressman Dymally for bringing the foundation to my attention or 
for sponsoring the participation of a group of California students in the 
foundation's science program. 
</P>
<P>
"At no time did he so much as hint that a contribution from me to the 
foundation would affect his position on the diamond sanctions or any other 
matter."

Black urban teen-agers who have abortions fare better economically and are more 
apt to stay in school than peers who become young mothers, a new study reports. 
The study, published by the nonprofit Alan Guttmacher Institute in Manhattan, 
researched 334 unmarried black teens aged 17 or younger from similar economic 
backgrounds who visited two Baltimore health clinics for pregnancy tests in 
1985 and 1986. Researchers found that 82% of the women who had abortions 
graduated from high school or remained in school two years after the procedure 
without having fallen behind, while only 63% of the women who gave birth 
completed high school or were still in school two years later.

A federal indictment Wednesday charged three police officers and four other men 
with stealing more than $1 million in cash, 110 pounds of cocaine and a ton of 
marijuana from drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
A separate indictment charged two other officers in a cocaine case. 
</P>
<P>
The cases mark the widest-ranging police corruption indictments since 15 Miami 
police officers were charged in a drug rip-off ring in 1984 and 1985. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Atty. Dexter Lehtinen said at a news conference that the defendants 
arranged for the transfer of honest officers to other assignments as they 
engaged in ripping off drug dealers between 1981 and 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"They would come into the possession of information about where drug dealers 
were, where illegal drugs were, and should have engaged in proper law 
enforcement activities," Lehtinen said.

<P>
The famed Napa Valley wine-producing region has banned tasting rooms and 
souvenir shops in new wineries after years of controversy over "boutique 
wineries" designed more for tourism than wine production. 
</P>
<P>
Napa County supervisors decided that all new vineyards must be designed solely 
for fermenting and processing wine grapes. Vintners must also use at least 
three-quarters Napa County grapes in their wines. The decision allowed the 
valley's existing 70 wineries to continue to lure tourists with souvenirs, 
tastings, restaurants and music festivals. It follows a growing argument over 
the balance of viticulture and tourism as traffic congestion and development 
alter the rural character of the valley.

<P>
Backers of a sweeping environmental protection initiative that includes strong 
safeguards against pesticides in food charged that key sections of a rival 
initiative, advanced by farmers and food producers, were actually proposed by 
pesticide manufacturers. State Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, Assemblyman Tom 
Hayden (D-Santa Monica) and the Natural Resources Defense Council charged that 
the rival "wholesome food" initiative contains far weaker protections against 
pesticide poisoning in foods than their proposed "Environmental Protection Act 
of 1990." 
</P>
<P>
When farmers and others announced their "wholesome food" measure last month 
they said the chemical industry was not a part of their coalition. But, Van de 
Kamp and Hayden said they have obtained internal campaign documents that 
indicate that the agricultural chemical industry is heavily involved. The 
charges were denied by the Western Agricultural Chemicals Assn. and two 
campaign consulting firms involved in the issue. Both initiatives are proposed 
for next November's ballot.

DEPUTIES MEET WITH MUSLIMS AFTER BLOODY CONFRONTATION; 
</P>
<P>
VIOLENCE: THEY AGREE TO A CONTINUING DIALOGUE AIMED AT AVOIDING A REPEAT OF 
TUESDAY'S FATAL ENCOUNTER. BUT THE TWO SIDES DIFFER VASTLY IN EXPLAINING WHAT 
HAPPENED.

Los Angeles County sheriff's officials and Nation of Islam leaders emerged from 
a meeting late Wednesday and announced that they have begun discussions aimed 
at mending strained relations that followed a clash a day earlier in which a 
deputy fatally shot one Muslim and seriously wounded another. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides said the meeting, from which reporters were excluded, was the first 
in a series of dialogues intended to open lines of communication that could 
prevent another violent confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
"We've agreed to further meetings to develop an appreciation of the concerns of 
each side," said Assistant Sheriff Jerry Harper. "We had a productive meeting 
in terms of agreeing that we are going to seek all the facts to see that the 
matter is thoroughly investigated." 
</P>
<P>
The clash occurred after two deputies in a patrol car stopped a motorist at 
12:40 a.m. Tuesday in the Athens District of South Los Angeles and several men 
came out of a nearby apartment complex and fought with the officers. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that basic fact, vastly different accounts of the incident began to 
emerge Wednesday as deputies and Muslims who interviewed witnesses began to 
piece together their stories. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's officials essentially contend that the shootings occurred only after 
one officer was grabbed from behind in a chokehold and had his gun wrested away 
by one of the men who came out the apartment building in the 1100 block of West 
106th Street. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Muslim View 
</P>
<P>
But in a hastily called meeting of 80 community leaders, Wali Shamsuddin, a Los 
Angeles businessman and Muslim, charged that his fellow Muslims were assaulted 
by the deputies, and that the dead man, Oliver Beasley, may have been trying to 
return the deputy's gun when he was shot. 
</P>
<P>
The community meeting Wednesday morning was arranged by activist Danny J. 
Bakewell at the South Los Angeles headquarters of the Brotherhood Crusade. It 
was attended by Nation of Islam leaders as well as by officials of such 
organizations as the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People and 
the Parents of Watts. Representatives of county Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, Los 
Angeles City Councilman Nate Holden and the U.S. Justice Department were also 
there. 
</P>
<P>
"An attack on the Nation of Islam is an attack on the entire community," 
Bakewell said. "Nobody carries themselves with more respect, more dignity than 
a member of the Nation of Islam -- man, woman or child." 
</P>
<P>
Basing his account on interviews with witnesses, Shamsuddin told the group that 
one of the two deputies who pulled the car over repeatedly "body-slammed" the 
27-year-old Beasley. He acknowledged that Beasley managed to disarm the 
officer, but he said the gun was taken away in self-defense. Then Beasley 
apparently tried to return the handgun, Shamsuddin alleged. 
</P>
<P>
"The brother (Beasley) was so meek and so kind, the witnesses said he was 
holding the gun out to (the deputy) as if he was giving it back," Shamsuddin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A sheriff's spokesman labeled Shamsuddin's remarks "preposterous." 
</P>
<P>
Later, the deputies and backup officers began firing at Muslims who had left 
the apartment building after they heard the initial scuffle, Shamsuddin said. 
</P>
<P>
One deputy, Shamsuddin alleged, fired a shot into the already wounded Beasley 
after he had been handcuffed. Beasley's body, held by the heels, was then 
dragged by deputies "up and down the street," Shamsuddin alleged. 
</P>
<P>
"We're monitoring this," said Stephen Thom, a U.S. Justice Department 
representative who attended the meeting. "We are not involved. But we are very 
interested in the case. We will offer assistance, if it's asked for." 
</P>
<P>
The case is also being investigated by the district attorney's Special 
Investigations Division. 
</P>
<P>
The Nation of Islam has yet to issue a formal statement summarizing its own 
investigation of the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff Sherman Block could not be reached for comment Wednesday. But 
Undersheriff Robert Edmonds called Shamsuddin's story a "preposterous, absurd 
and racist statement on his part." 
</P>
<P>
"The facts totally contradict anything of the sort," Edmonds said. "The body 
(of Beasley) was not moved from the moment he was shot until well later that 
day when the coroner arrived." 
</P>
<P>
Edmonds represented Block at Wednesday's meeting at the Brotherhood Crusade 
offices with Nation of Islam leaders. A similar session was held Monday between 
Los Angeles police officials and Muslim leaders to ease tensions following a 
confrontation earlier this month involving LAPD officers. 
</P>
<P>
Among those present at Wednesday's talks with sheriff's officials was Minister 
Leonard Farrakhan Muhammad, chief of staff to Nation of Islam leader Louis 
Farrakhan. 
</P>
<P>
"I would characterize the meeting as one to create an opportunity to determine 
the direction in which the Sheriff's Department wishes to take this issue," 
Muhammad said, "whether they want to take this to justice." 
</P>
<P>
But Edmonds suggested the two sides are far from a resolution. 
</P>
<P>
"We have sets of facts that are significantly different," Edmonds said after 
the private meeting. "We did not get into the details of the incident (on 
Tuesday), but we have agreed to further meetings, although no specific date has 
been set yet." 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's spokesman Lt. Michael Quinn said that taped radio transmissions 
indicate that Tuesday's situation escalated from a somewhat routine traffic 
stop into an emergency within 25 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
The deputies -- identified by sources as trainee David Dolson, 24, and training 
officer William Tackaberry, 39 -- first called for assistance at 12:40 a.m., 
requesting two backup cruisers. The usual call is for one backup unit, Quinn 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"They perceived a possible problem and thought they needed more officers (than 
usual) at the scene," the lieutenant said. 
</P>
<P>
The call was made, Quinn said, after the deputies had placed the driver of the 
vehicle, David Hartley, 18, against an automobile to be searched. A crowd of 
neighbors had already begun to gather and several men were on the apartment 
building steps, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Just 25 seconds later, a deputy placed a call for emergency assistance, Quinn 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The deputy was excited and the (transmission) garbled," Quinn said. "The only 
thing (dispatchers) picked up was 106th Street." 
</P>
<P>
It is not discernable from the transmissions whether the deputy was in a 
struggle when he radioed, Quinn said. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Frank Merriman, who is heading the sheriff's internal investigation into 
the shooting, said the situation deteriorated rapidly when the group of men who 
rushed out of the apartment building twice refused orders to go back inside. 
</P>
<P>
When deputies put their hands on Hartley's arms to walk him back to their radio 
car, "one of the deputies was attacked from behind and placed in a chokehold," 
Merriman said. 
</P>
<P>
"As the other deputy went to his aid, he was also grabbed by three to four 
males," Merriman said. Soon, both deputies were grappling for control of their 
weapons, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dolson lost his gun to one of the assailants, Merriman said. Tackaberry fired a 
round that did not hit anyone, Merriman said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shots Fired 
</P>
<P>
"The crowd of males retreated, one of whom had the trainee's gun," the 
lieutenant said. 
</P>
<P>
Dolson drew his backup weapon and fired four rounds. One shot hit Hartley in 
the shoulder. Seconds later, Dolson fired another round, "striking Beasley in 
the head," Merriman said. 
</P>
<P>
Hartley was in serious condition at County-USC Medical Center, where he was 
held in the jail ward for investigation of attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
Coroner's spokesman Bob Dambacher said an autopsy on Beasley is scheduled for 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Neither deputy has been involved in any previous shootings, a spokesman for the 
district attorney's Special Investigation Division said. Nor has either officer 
ever been sued for use of excessive force, court records show. 
</P>
<P>
While Dolson had been on patrol for only about three months, he had been a 
deputy since October, 1987, according to the department. 
</P>
<P>
Before his assignment to the Lennox Station, Dolson attended the Sheriff's 
Academy for 17 weeks, then apparently was assigned to the Custody Division for 
about 1 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
Quinn would not confirm Dolson's work history or his identity. But he said that 
all young deputies are first assigned to custody duty, working in County Jail 
facilities, usually for about two years. 
</P>
<P>
At the academy all deputies are trained in patrol procedures, including ways to 
defuse confrontations with the public, Quinn said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies must also take a two-week refresher course on new laws, training and 
procedures before being assigned as patrol trainees, he said. The trainee phase 
usually lasts about six months, Quinn said. 
</P>
<P>
"We cover things such as . . . how to defuse situations (by speaking calmly), 
but this went well beyond that," Quinn said of Tuesday's incident. "And what 
these deputies were ultimately involved in, I don't think they could have 
talked their way out of it." 
</P>
<P>
A source close to Dolson said he had taken a few days off work and would be 
temporarily assigned to an office job upon his return. A department spokesman 
said that is the usual procedure in such cases. 
</P>
<P>
Arraignment for the five suspects, four of whom were being held without bail in 
the Los Angeles County Men's Central Jail, has been set for Thursday in 
Inglewood Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
One of the suspects, an unidentified 15-year-old boy, was released to his 
parents on Tuesday.

JUDGE ORDERS PIER REBUILT; 
</P>
<P>
REDONDO BEACH RULED LEGALLY OBLIGATED TO RESTORE BATTERED LANDMARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly two years after two storms and a fire reduced the Redondo Beach pier to 
a battered stump, a judge ruled Wednesday that the city must rebuild the 
once-venerable landmark. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance Superior Court Judge Abraham Gorenfeld, to the delight of the 
shell-jewelry vendors and seaside restaurateurs whose businesses once lined the 
pier, held that reconstruction -- which could cost up to $4.6 million -- is 
required by the pier lease. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm elated!" crowed Jay Robinson, a general partner in Pier Properties Ltd., 
the leaseholder representing the 15 businesses destroyed in the third of three 
1988 pier disasters, a spectacular fire sparked by faulty electrical wiring. 
</P>
<P>
But among the pier's neighbors, the reaction was less jubilant. 
</P>
<P>
"I have nothing against piers, but our pier was a dump," said Greg Diete, who 
chairs the city's General Plan Advisory Committee and who lives in a 
condominium near the pier. 
</P>
<P>
"It brought crime into the community, and gangs, and it cost the taxpayers more 
money than it brought in because of the need for law enforcement and city 
staff," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Once a popular promenade of tourists and fishermen and souvenir shops and 
restaurants with ocean views, the horseshoe-shaped landmark was chopped in half 
by the wave of disasters in 1988. First a January storm with crashing, 20-foot 
waves caused $17 million in damage. Then in April, a second storm swept away 
the popular 155-foot fishing promenade. Fifty-two mile an hour winds and 
12-foot breakers pounded telephone pole-sized pilings against sections of the 
pier. Decking collapsed. A coffee shop kitchen dropped into the ocean. Another 
$1.25 million in losses were toted up. 
</P>
<P>
The following month, a spark from electrical wiring under a pier restaurant 
delivered the coup de grace. About a third of the pier businesses and half of 
the remaining decking were destroyed as the midsection of the horseshoe went up 
in flames. 
</P>
<P>
The loss was a civic blow to Redondo Beach. In the nearly 100 years since the 
city was founded as a logging port, it had never been without a pier. Three 
times in city history, storms had claimed the city's harbor centerpiece. But 
the pier had always risen again, and city officials vowed this loss would also 
end in resurrection. 
</P>
<P>
Within six months, the City Council had voted to restore the pier. But the 
decision soon faltered in the face of vocal opposition from people like Diete 
-- and the election of a new council. 
</P>
<P>
Amid mixed messages from the voters, many of whom loved the old pier and 
disagreed with Diete, a council majority promised to put the question of 
reconstruction to a voter referendum. 
</P>
<P>
But as a cautionary measure, the city asked the courts to determine its legal 
obligations to businesses under the pier lease. City Atty. Gordon Phillips 
argued in court that the document did not address the city's duties if 
irreparable damage occurred, but required the city only to maintain and repair 
the existing structure. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the leaseholders, meanwhile, said the lease clearly indicates the 
city's responsibility for replacing piling and decking. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor and council plan to meet early next month to discuss whether to 
appeal Wednesday's ruling. Initial reaction was mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Ron Cawdrey, who has backed the reconstruction from the start, 
shouted, "All right! I love it!" when told of the ruling. But Councilwoman 
Barbara Doerr noted that "five million dollars is a pretty expensive tag," and 
said she would push for an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed that we don't have the option whether or not to rebuild," 
said Mayor Brad Parton. But he noted that the city may be able to make the new 
pier more palatable to opponents by imposing strict conditions on such things 
as business hours and building design. 
</P>
<P>
The money won't be difficult for the city to come up with, said City Manager 
Tim Casey, since Redondo Beach is already eligible for between $2 million and 
$3 million in state disaster assistance, and property taxes from a nearby 
redevelopment project could alone support a bond issue of nearly $5 million.

D.A., STATE PROBE BRADLEY CAMPAIGN FUNDS; 
</P>
<P>
CITY HALL: RECORDS ARE BEING ANALYZED TO DETERMINE WHETHER FUND-RAISING 
CARNIVALS WERE USED TO MAKE ILLEGAL CONTRIBUTIONS. THE CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE 
TURNED OVER THE RECORDS. 
</P>

<P>
State and local investigators are reviewing about $80,000 in contributions to 
Mayor Tom Bradley's reelection to determine whether fund-raising carnivals were 
used to make illegal campaign donations, The Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
Officials with the Los Angeles County district attorney's office and the state 
Fair Political Practices Commission said Wednesday they are analyzing Bradley 
campaign documents related to the carnivals. The materials had been sent to 
both agencies Monday by the city attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. James K. Hahn, in a letter to City Council President John Ferraro, 
said his office had determined that "possible violations of the law beyond my 
jurisdiction" should be reviewed by the district attorney's office and the 
FPPC. He also suggested that the district attorney's office, which prosecutes 
felonies, should consider taking the matter before the county Grand Jury. 
</P>
<P>
Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner, said the referral from 
the city attorney included copies of checks and numerous other documents. Other 
sources said the documents related to a series of carnivals organized in 1987 
and 1988 by Long Beach businessman Allen Alevy, a Bradley fund-raiser. Gibbons 
said the district attorney had not yet decided whether to open a formal 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The Times reported last month that the carnivals may have violated state and 
local election laws because they may not have been clearly identified as 
political fund-raisers, the true source of the carnival donations may have been 
concealed and a $200 city limit on anonymous donations may have been exceeded. 
</P>
<P>
The material turned over to the district attorney was discovered during an 
ongoing audit of Bradley's 1989 mayoral campaign by the city clerk's office. It 
includes copies of two large batches of $500 money orders and cashier's checks 
apparently delivered directly to Bradley, said sources knowledgeable about the 
records. 
</P>
<P>
Also referred to the district attorney were handwritten notes that the mayor 
sent with the checks to his campaign accountant, Jules Glazer, the sources 
said. The notes indicate that the carnivals should be treated as "small 
donations," meaning the names of the donors did not have to be disclosed, said 
one source who asked not to be named. 
</P>
<P>
The Times reported that some of Alevy's carnivals were held on city-owned land 
without approval, while Bradley was intervening with city officials to help 
Alevy purchase two surplus parcels of city land. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the carnivals were held on city land and later purchased by Alevy -- a 
disclosure that drew criticism from some council members. Use of city land for 
political purposes is prohibited by city policy. 
</P>
<P>
"The council has a valid concern as to the monitoring and supervising of city 
land in respect to the mayor's fund-raising carnivals," Hahn said in his letter 
to Ferraro. 
</P>
<P>
It was previously reported that at least $20,000 was raised through the 
carnivals -- and that perhaps much more was actually raised by Alevy. The 
Bradley campaign had reported receiving $164,000 in 1987 and 1988 in the form 
of small contributions from unidentified donors -- an unusually large amount. 
</P>
<P>
Through a spokesman, Bradley declined to comment, but repeated an earlier 
statement that he relied on his campaign attorneys and accountants to determine 
how the carnival funds should be reported. 
</P>
<P>
Alevy could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The carnivals -- which sources said were coordinated by Westside public 
relations consultant Mary Anne Singer and her one-time client, Alevy -- became 
a major source of funds for Bradley as he was gearing up for a tough reelection 
race against Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky. 
</P>
<P>
Alevy, unlike other Bradley fund raisers, was not subject to the normal checks 
and balances that were part of the mayor's fund-raising operation, Bradley 
campaign officials have told The Times. Alevy brought the donations directly to 
the mayor's office, one official said. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor then wrote notes to his campaign staff describing the source of the 
funds, the campaign official said, and this led the campaign to report the 
carnival contributions as miscellaneous small donations. 
</P>
<P>
A key question for investigators is the role Alevy, Singer or their associates 
played in raising and delivering the carnival money. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Alevy) could have been the actual donor, which must be reported, or an 
intermediary, which must be reported as well," said one source familiar with 
the records and the law. 
</P>
<P>
While Alevy was collecting tens of thousands of dollars for the campaign from 
the carnivals, the Bradley campaign has only reported receiving about $7,000 
from him personally and his companies in recent years.

UCLA LIBRARY OF MAPS A REAL TREASURE TROVE; 
</P>
<P>
REPOSITORY: SPECIAL HENRY BRUMAN COLLECTION SERVES ACADEMICS, ADVENTURERS, 
EXPLORERS, CITY PLANNERS AND THE MERELY CURIOUS ALIKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Sometimes UCLA's Henry Bruman Map Library -- academe's largest -- is a footnote 
in an adventure. 
</P>
<P>
That was the case in 1983 when two men, carrying what they said was a treasure 
map drawn by 17th-Century pirate William Kidd, approached the library's staff. 
The men explained that they hoped to find an island in the real world identical 
to the island on their map. Library staff member Jonnie Hargis helped them sift 
through some of the 750,000 maps in the collection. Finally, Hargis recalled, 
"we found an area off the coast of Vietnam that matched the chart." 
</P>
<P>
Convinced that the pirate's treasure was buried somewhere on Phu Quoc, a 
Vietnamese-held island in the Gulf of Thailand, the men went to Thailand, where 
they rented a speedboat and secretly sailed to Phu Quoc. But before the 
treasure hunters could start shoveling in earnest, they were arrested by 
Vietnamese officials. Held for months in solitary confinement, they were 
finally released after their families bribed authorities. 
</P>
<P>
"We get some real oddballs and a lot of idle browsers," said Hargis, who said 
there is a romance or magic about maps that fascinates many people. Among the 
other treasure hunters Hargis has assisted: a man looking for submerged Nazi 
gold in German lakes and others seeking lost California gold mines. 
</P>
<P>
As map librarian Carlos Hagen-Lautrup explained, the major purpose of the 
library is to serve the university's academic enterprise. But it is open to the 
public as well. As a result, users include everyone from an astrologer who 
regularly calls asking for the precise coordinates of clients' birthplaces for 
use in preparing astrological charts for people who are planning trips and want 
to study street maps of Cracow or Buenos Aires before they go. And, Hargis 
said, "every time there's a quake, you can count on a surge of fault maps being 
pulled." 
</P>
<P>
The makers of the movie "Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes" 
found old maps of Africa in the collection that bore the colonial names in use 
during the period of their film. Environmental consultants come to the library 
to study maps of Los Angeles for evidence of factories or other past use that 
might preclude present-day development of a particular parcel of land. And 
library staff member Portia Chambliss once helped a visitor determine the 
neighborhood where Charles Dickens' lame but game Tiny Tim would have probably 
lived by consulting a descriptive map of London poverty from 1889. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the staff prides itself on being able to find the right map -- or 
nautical chart -- for almost any visitor. The only time Chambliss recalls being 
stumped was when she was asked for a map of Iraq in the 15th Century that 
showed climatic conditions and rainfall. "That was impossible." 
</P>
<P>
The map library was founded in 1961 by the former chairman of the geography 
department for whom it is named. It has been headed since 1962 by 
Hagen-Lautrup, a Chilean-born geographer and engineer who has tried to make it 
a cartographic information center, not just a map room. "It's the information 
that counts, not the medium," said Hagen-Lautrup. As a result, most of the 
truly old maps in the collection, with the exception of a 1600 map of Flanders, 
are reproductions, not originals. 
</P>
<P>
The library is a depository for maps issued by agencies of the U.S. government 
and several other countries, Hagen-Lautrup said. But in the last decade or so, 
collecting has been complicated by the skyrocketing price of maps. "Many 
governments want to use maps as a source of income, especially Third World 
countries," said Hagen-Lautrup, who has seen prices rise from a dollar or two 
per map to $15 or $20. 
</P>
<P>
Some maps are hard to get at any price, he said. Ostensibly because of concerns 
about national security, "Colombia and Bolivia don't sell detailed maps to 
anybody," he said.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PLAN TO BOOST PATROLS NEAR SCHOOLS APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seeking to ensure the safety of schoolchildren, the City Council on Wednesday 
approved a plan to boost police patrols on streets surrounding schools in 
gang-plagued neighborhoods in Watts. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky said the stepped-up patrols, which will cost 
$150,000 through the end of the school year, would help "create an environment 
in which young people who want to get an education can do so without taking 
their lives in their hands." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Police Chief William Rathburn said the department's Southeast Division 
now has six officers patroling "pedestrian corridors." But he said that "has 
not been enough" to ensure the safety of students. 
</P>
<P>
With the new money, the department will be able to deploy 10 officers in five 
cars each school day, Rathburn said. They will patrol streets around Jordan and 
Locke high schools and nearby junior highs and elementary schools.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LONG BEACH WINS ROUND OVER NEW POLICE 
CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Superior Court judge on Wednesday refused to stop Long Beach city officials 
from imposing a new contract with the police union against the union's wishes, 
propelling the matter into the appeals courts. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Hannon, attorney for the Long Beach Police Officers Assn., said he would 
immediately appeal Judge Dzintra Janavs' opinion. Deputy City Atty. Thomas M. 
Reeves said the city would start enforcing provisions of the new contract right 
away, but Hannon said he would request a court order blocking such action 
pending appeal. 
</P>
<P>
The Long Beach City Council declared an impasse in police negotiations last 
November and voted to unilaterally adopt the city's last contract offer.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An environmental engineer who performed extensive tests on the tarry petroleum 
goo that oozed from a Cudahy elementary school playground last summer, forcing 
the school's closure, this week said it is safe for students to return to the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
Angelo Bellomo, director of McLaren Environmental Engineering of Burbank, said 
a study at Park Avenue Elementary School showed that the air was not 
contaminated with hazardous vapors. 
</P>
<P>
He added, however, that students should not be allowed to come in contact with 
the petroleum-based material, which usually oozes to the surface during the 
summer. The school was built in an area were numerous refineries previously 
were located. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the state health department and the Los Angeles Unified School 
District are to meet next week to discuss plans to remove the substance and 
reopen the school.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SECURITY GUARD ACQUITTED IN RAPE OF TRANSIENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Long Beach jury deliberated less than 90 minutes Wednesday before acquitting 
a security guard of raping a homeless woman in the basement of a local 
ministry. 
</P>
<P>
Calvin Farrell, 35, was found not guilty after a monthlong trial in which he 
was accused of luring a 33-year-old woman into a room at the Christian Outreach 
Appeal to "talk Bible." 
</P>
<P>
He has been jailed on a $10,000 bond since Nov. 14. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Public Defender Jerry Berger argued that the woman consented to having 
sex, then conspired to "set up" Farrell, whose security job made him unpopular 
among the homeless. Deputy Dist. Atty. Carol Rose, who spoke with the jurors 
afterward, said the panel did not believe the witnesses on either side -- most 
of whom were homeless. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very difficult for jurors to separate the way of life of the witnesses 
from their testimony," she said. "I guess the homeless are just not considered 
credible."

STATE STILL HOPES TINY WASPS WILL BEST WHITEFLIES; 
</P>
<P>
BIOLOGY: DESPITE MIXED RESULTS SO FAR, EXPERTS HAVE FAITH THAT WASPS IMPORTED 
FROM ISRAEL AND ITALY WILL BE ABLE TO ERADICATE THE PESTS. EXPERIMENTS ARE 
CONTINUING AT UC RIVERSIDE. 
</P>

<P>
Despite an ambiguous showing in an Encino park, state agricultural experts have 
not lost faith in the tiny Israeli wasp they want to use as a weapon in the war 
against the ash whitefly. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last two months, researchers pitted the wasps against whiteflies in 
the Balboa Sports Center in Encino, yielding inconclusive results. But in a 
more closely monitored test in Riverside, researchers said, the wasps 
reproduced and fed on the whiteflies, which damage fruit and shade trees and 
shrubbery. 
</P>
<P>
The whiteflies have spread throughout California, and a state official said 
Wednesday that wide release of the wasps, which are harmless to humans, could 
begin this spring. 
</P>
<P>
Ash whiteflies weaken and eventually defoliate trees by sucking vital juices 
from their leaves. The insects also exude a sticky substance that can damage 
patio furniture and automobile paint. 
</P>
<P>
"We're more than encouraged," said Kathy Brunetti, program supervisor for the 
California Department of Food and Agriculture. "We're convinced that 
bio-control will be our weapon against the whitefly." 
</P>
<P>
Bio-control refers to the use of natural predators to kill an undesirable 
insect, instead of chemical methods. To combat the whitefly, the state has 
begun breeding tiny Encarsia wasps, imported from Israel, in Riverside. "We are 
anticipating right now to have a large-scale release sometime this spring," 
Brunetti said. 
</P>
<P>
Since it was discovered about two years ago in a Van Nuys fruit stand, the ash 
whitefly has invaded trees from the Mexican border to Sacramento. The insect, 
normally found in Europe and the Middle East, has spread quickly because it has 
no natural enemies in California. 
</P>
<P>
"I think of it as the Pilgrim Fathers' Syndrome," Brunetti said. "The Pilgrims 
came here and left their enemies behind in Europe. Now we're going back there 
to bring their enemies over here." 
</P>
<P>
She said a spring release of the wasps in Southern California will probably be 
followed by a late summer release in the northern portion of the state. 
</P>
<P>
With funding and staff help from government agencies and grower associations, 
Tom Bellows, an entomologist at UC Riverside, has been trying to determine 
whether the imported wasps will reproduce in Southern California's climate and 
attack the whitefly. In November, Bellows released about 60 of the parasitic 
wasps in the Balboa Sports Center. 
</P>
<P>
But when he checked the experiment early this month, he could not tell whether 
the wasps had multiplied and fed on whiteflies. He said the trees that might 
have provided such evidence had lost their leaves because of cold weather. 
However, a similar test closer to his laboratory provided more promising 
results. 
</P>
<P>
"We put 123 wasps in Riverside," Bellows said. "Seven or eight weeks later, we 
found evidence that reproduction had occurred, and the wasps were successfully 
established. We found 97 dead whiteflies that had been killed by the wasps. 
That's very encouraging for that size of an experiment." 
</P>
<P>
He said similar experiments are under way in San Bernardino, San Diego and 
Orange counties, and include the use of wasps imported from Italy. Bellows said 
he plans to test still other wasps and a breed of beetle to find the most 
effective whitefly predator. 
</P>
<P>
The imported wasps lay eggs within immature whiteflies, and the developing 
wasps consume their hosts from within, researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 16, state Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Los Angeles) introduced a 
bill that would provide $2 million for control of the whitefly over the next 
five years, using only natural predators. "We don't think there will be any 
opposition at all," said Karin Caves, a spokesman for the legislator.

A GROWING JAPAN EXPORT: NEWS; 
</P>
<P>
MEDIA: THE ENGLISH-LANGUAGE JAPAN TIMES IS EXPANDING AND REVAMPING ITS OVERSEAS 
EDITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY YOSHIHARA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Will Americans buy news and views about Japan from a Japanese paper when the 
country already is the subject of extensive scrutiny in the U.S. press? 
</P>
<P>
The Japan Times is banking on the idea. The largest and oldest English-language 
daily in Japan is revamping its weekly overseas edition, beginning next month. 
</P>
<P>
Gone will be the old black-and-white format on extra-thin paper. In its place 
will be a tabloid-size, full-color weekly that reaches beyond political news 
into business and other general-interest subjects such as art, food, life style 
and books. 
</P>
<P>
The Japan Times is moving aggressively to be the international purveyor and 
interpreter of news about Japan. The expansion comes, perhaps not 
coincidentally, at a time Japanese officials and executives express continued 
frustration at what they call "Japan bashing" in the U.S. media. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping to bridge the perception gap that exists between America and 
Japan, which is particularly evident in the area of the trade issue," Toshiaki 
Ogasawara, chairman and publisher of the Japan Times, said in a telephone 
interview from his Tokyo offices. 
</P>
<P>
"The paper will address issues from a Japanese perspective. The aim is to 
correct the mistaken perceptions Americans have of Japan," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the Japanese government is involved, Ogasawara said: "Some people 
think the Japan Times is the mouthpiece for government. That is absolutely 
nonsense. They do not own a cent" of the company's stock. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper is expanding as other publishing companies, both American and 
Japanese, are moving across the Pacific Ocean to capitalize on the growing 
demand for news about U.S.-Japanese relations. Japanese-language newspapers 
such as Asahi, Yomiuri and the Japan Economic Journal are beamed by satellite 
daily into the United States for distribution to Japanese nationals. Business 
Tokyo, an English-language monthly in Japan, recently opened a New York bureau. 
</P>
<P>
Moving in the opposite direction, USA Today has begun distribution in Japan. 
The New York Times has announced plans for a fax paper in Tokyo, and the Los 
Angeles Times is studying a similar product. The Asian Wall Street Journal and 
the International Herald Tribune have been circulated in Japan for years. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Japan Times dates to 1897 as the first English-language paper in 
Japan, its big growth in circulation -- to 64,835 paid subscriptions -- has 
come only in the past few years with the big influx of foreigners into Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The overseas Japan Times Weekly, started in 1961, has a worldwide circulation 
of "only 4,000 to 5,000," of which half goes to North America, according to 
Ogasawara, who acquired a majority interest in the paper in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The Japan Times is investing $1 million in the expansion, said Ogasawara, who 
also heads the company he founded, Nifco Inc., a manufacturer of industrial 
fasteners, which has annual sales of about $300 million. 
</P>
<P>
Ogasawara said he has been studying an expansion for two years and decided to 
go ahead now because of interest in Japan's emerging role in the world and its 
changing relationship with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"As tensions tighten, our market becomes more important," explained Philip J. 
LaForge, general manager of Japan Times Weekly. 
</P>
<P>
"All people hear about is trade and Japan-bashing on both sides," LaForge said 
at the paper's new Wilshire Boulevard offices. He explained that the weekly 
will be "a culturally unfiltered source of news about Japan. . . . It will be 
completely edited in Tokyo," where it has a staff of 120. 
</P>
<P>
The new, 24-page version of the weekly, which will debut the week of Feb. 5, is 
twice as large as the previous version. It will be printed in Los Angeles from 
pages sent overnight from Tokyo. Previously, the weekly was printed in Japan 
and sent by mail to U.S. subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
The Japan Times, whose current U.S. readership is composed mostly of 
politicians and academics, is seeking to broaden its readership in Los Angeles, 
New York and Washington because of their high concentration of Japan watchers. 
It also is targeting San Francisco, Portland, Seattle and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The revamped Japan Times will have an initial printing of 20,000 and 
subscription rate of $105 a year. Ogasawara would like to see a circulation of 
50,000 to 60,000. La Forge says he has a personal goal of 70,000. To help the 
effort along, the publication has hired circulation manager Michael Fisher, 
formerly circulation manager at the Christian Science Monitor in Boston. The 
Japan Times plans to sell ads in Japan and the United States.

MACHINISTS JOIN NEWEST UNION BID TO TAKE OVER UAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unions representing UAL pilots, flight attendants and machinists, in an unusual 
display of unity, proposed Wednesday to buy 75% of the parent of United 
Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
The three unions said they stood ready to make hefty concessions over five 
years to help finance their plan, but they didn't say how much they are 
prepared to pay for UAL shares. 
</P>
<P>
UAL's shares jumped $6 Wednesday, closing at $161.50, on rumors that the unions 
were set to pay $190 a share for the nation's second-largest airline. Spokesmen 
for the three unions declined to comment on details of the proposal, which was 
announced after the market closed. 
</P>
<P>
The unions were under pressure to come up with a bid by today, when UAL's board 
is scheduled to meet. The board said it would consider a recapitalization plan 
to satisfy a threat from Coniston Partners, a New York money management firm 
that owns 11.8% of UAL shares. Coniston has threatened to oust UAL's board 
unless it takes steps to increase the value of the airline company's stock. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Tierney of Coniston called the unions' proposal "very positive." 
</P>
<P>
"This shows significant progress, but there are still a lot of details to be 
flushed out," Tierney said. "There is still a lot to know about the 
concessions, and the amount of equity the employees plan to invest." 
</P>
<P>
Tierney said Coniston is willing to invest in an employee-controlled UAL but 
added that the firm has not been asked to participate. Participation by the 
machinists, in the past staunch opponents of employee ownership, increased the 
likelihood that the proposal will succeed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The unions said their plan calls for union and non-union employees to invest 
$300 million in the first year and $2 billion over five years. The employee 
investment includes significant reductions in labor costs, they said. 
</P>
<P>
The unions also said they gave the board documents outlining how ownership in 
the company would be divided among employee groups, but a spokesman for the 
unions declined to discuss those details. 
</P>
<P>
"Our objective is to form a unique partnership among the company and all 
employees that will permit the company to immediately return to the position of 
the world's best airline, and to grow and prosper in the future," the unions' 
letter stated. 
</P>
<P>
It was unclear whether the unions intend to offer UAL's managers a stake. UAL 
Chairman Stephen M. Wolf, who joined with the pilots in an effort to buy the 
airline last fall, has actively supported employee ownership in recent weeks 
with a high-profile campaign that included letters and videotaped messages to 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
But it could not be learned if Wolf had won over the machinists, who called for 
his resignation last fall after it was revealed that Wolf stood to receive a 
personal windfall of $76 million on his stock options if the earlier, 
$300-a-share bid had succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
In their letter Wednesday, the unions hinted that a change in the way UAL is 
managed is part of their proposal. "We have delivered to the board's 
representatives . . . proposals on the governance of the new company," the 
letter said. 
</P>
<P>
UAL Executive Vice President Lawrence M. Nagin said the company would have no 
comment on the union proposal "until the board has had an opportunity to review 
it completely." 
</P>
<P>
The union offer provides a surprising twist in UAL's six-month takeover saga, 
because it unites two antagonists, the pilots union and the machinists. 
Opposition from the machinists helped defeat a pilot-led takeover bid for the 
airline in 1987 as well as last fall's joint bid by pilots and management.

JITTERY STOCK MARKET GOES ON A WILD RIDE; DOW CUTS LOSS TO 10 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wall Street went on a roller coaster ride Wednesday as fears of rising interest 
rates and gloomy forecasts about the economy spooked many investors. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial index plunged 62 points in the first 16 minutes of 
trading, recovered partially, then fell and rose again before ending the most 
active trading day of the year with a 10.82-point loss. The closely watched 
index closed at 2,604.50, on New York Stock Exchange volume of 207.83 million 
shares, up from 179.30 million Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The jittery day was spurred by a variety of factors. 
</P>
<P>
First, a $5-billion government bond issue was poorly received after the stock 
markets closed Tuesday, renewing fears that domestic interest rates might rise. 
There was also an imbalance of buy and sell orders in the futures market at the 
end of trading Tuesday, which caused a number of computer-directed program 
traders to sell Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
But more sobering were concerns about the health of the economy itself. 
</P>
<P>
Several economists recently have lowered their forecasts and are becoming more 
widely divided on whether growth will continue and on when -- or if -- interest 
rates may be coming down. 
</P>
<P>
"We are in an environment where people overreact to short-term stimuli because 
very few have any long-term convictions anymore," said Michael Metz, chief 
market analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co. in New York. "This is about as 
nervous a market as I've ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
Interest rates and economic growth figures have a dramatic effect on stock 
prices because they are indicators of future corporate profits. If growth is 
strong, companies are likely to sell more goods and services and post earnings 
increases. When growth is weak, corporate earnings generally suffer as well. 
</P>
<P>
Yet this year is defying the norms. 
</P>
<P>
Growth is slow if not at a standstill, yet interest rates have actually headed 
up in the past few months. The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond, for example, is 
yielding 8.4%, compared to 7.9% in December. 
</P>
<P>
The government will be hard-pressed to lower those rates soon for two reasons, 
many experts believe. Inflation is still high, and a interest rate dip could 
fuel further hikes in consumer prices. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, international interest rates have jumped dramatically, so a drop in 
U.S. rates could make it virtually impossible for the government to borrow 
overseas. 
</P>
<P>
"The market is in search of a solution right now, but it can't find it," said 
Joseph Wahed, economist with Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco. "It needs good 
numbers on inflation or actual cuts in interest rates" but neither seems 
forthcoming in the immediate future, he noted. Wahed anticipates that a 
turnaround will come, possibly as soon as this spring, but the market is likely 
to languish in the meantime. 
</P>
<P>
Still, stocks staged a late rally Wednesday, in part because of program 
trading, market experts said. During the market's final hours, several big 
institutional traders executed "buy" programs for blue chip stocks. 
</P>
<P>
For example, AT&amp;T managed to close the day up 1/2 at 41 1/4, General 
Electric rose 1/2 to 63 1/4 and Merck added 3/4 to close at 72 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
UAL Corp., the parent of United Airlines, also helped spur the buying when 
rumors surfaced that the company may again be targeted for a takeover. The 
company's stock rose 6 to close at 161 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
Other big gainers included Cray Research, up 3 1/2 to 42 3/4, and Mylan Labs, 
up 2 1/2 to 22 1/4. Big losers included Teledyne, which was down 6 1/2 to 342 
1/2, and Tucson Electric, down 3 1/4 to 13 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
Among broader market measures, the New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 
0.96 to 182.64. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-share index closed at 330.26, 
down 1.35. 
</P>
<P>
The composite index for the over-the-counter market fell 4.76 to 425.66. The 
American Stock Exchange market-value index lost 5.06 to 354.67, while the 
Wilshire index of 5,000 equities closed at 3,190.198, down 25.357. 
</P>
<P>
In London, stocks rallied from the day's lows but were still broadly weaker, 
with the Financial Times stock exchange index of 100 issues off 12.5 at 
2,278.6. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, share prices plunged after news that U.S. bond futures were heavily 
sold after the New York close, sparking fears of a sharp reaction on Wall 
Street, brokers said. The 225-share Nikkei average tumbled 599.04, or 1.6%, to 
end the day at 36,778.98.

Seidman Warns Panel: L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corp. and of the Resolution Trust Corp., warned the House Banking 
Committee that President Bush's $50-billion savings and loan bailout likely 
will fall short but assured members of Congress that the crunch probably 
wouldn't come until after this year's election. Panel members reacted with 
dismay at his assessment, the most pessimistic yet from a government official. 
</P>
<P>
He declined to be pinned down on a new estimate of S&amp;L losses, but figures 
in his testimony suggest that losses are in the range of $74 billion to $82 
billion. A day earlier, Deputy Treasury Secretary John E. Robson had conceded 
only that it is possible that $50 billion is inadequate.

World Bank to Provide Mexico With $2 Billion: World Bank President Barber B. 
Conable Jr., said in a speech delivered in Mexico City on Latin American 
economic growth and reforms that the international agency will provide $2 
billion to support the reduction of Mexico's public foreign debt with 
commercial banks. The Mexican government and a 15-member Bank Advisory 
Committee, which represents about 500 commercial banks and has been negotiating 
a reduction of the Latin American nation's commercial debt, are expected to 
sign a landmark debt reduction accord Feb. 4 in Mexico City. The debt reduction 
agreement, assembled under the so-called Brady Plan drawn up by U.S. Treasury 
Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, is expected to cut Mexico's annual debt payments 
by nearly $4 billion.

BAT to Shut U.S. Office: Batus, London-based BAT Industries' U.S. holding 
company, based in Louisville, Ky., will be phased out this year, the company 
said. BAT's Brown &amp; Williamson tobacco unit in Louisville and Farmers Group 
insurance subsidiary in Los Angeles will then operate as independent entities 
reporting directly to London. The move is part of BAT's sale of its paper and 
retailing businesses to focus on tobacco and financial services.

EXXON RAISES VALDEZ CLEANUP COSTS TO $2 BILLION; 
</P>
<P>
EARNINGS: THE OIL GIANT WILL TAKE ANOTHER $500-MILLION CHARGE OVER THE SPILL, 
BRINGING ITS TAB FOR THE YEAR TO $1.38 BILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Exxon Corp. on Wednesday increased its estimate of the total 1989 costs of 
cleaning up the massive Alaskan oil spill to $2 billion and said it would take 
another $500-million charge in the fourth quarter to cover costs from what is 
now the most expensive environmental disaster in history. 
</P>
<P>
In reporting its estimated 1989 earnings, Exxon said it would take a 
$500-million charge in the fourth quarter for costs to clean up the spill of 11 
million gallons of oil that spilled from the grounded tanker Exxon Valdez and 
fouled the shoreline of pristine Prince William Sound last March. 
</P>
<P>
The charges reduced Exxon's 1989 net income to $3.8 billion, compared to $5.26 
billion in 1988. Revenue totaled $96.1 billion in 1989, compared to $88.6 
billion the year before. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Exxon spokesman William Smith upped the company's estimate of the 
spill's total costs so far -- costs to Exxon and others -- to "about $2 
billion." The figure does not include any liability from more than 150 lawsuits 
Exxon faces from the spill, nor does it include additional cleanup costs should 
Exxon resume work in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth-quarter charge comes in addition to $880 million that the company 
already set aside in the first and second quarters, bringing Exxon's total 
cleanup costs for the year to $1.38 billion. Other costs will be covered by 
"more than $400 million" in insurance, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts were not surprised at the additional charge, though "it was a lot 
bigger than I expected," said Joel D. Fischer, an analyst with Drexel Burnham 
Lambert Inc. in New York. Wall Street showed little reaction to the news, with 
Exxon's stock falling only 12.5 cents to close at $47 a share. 
</P>
<P>
"The financial effect of the Exxon Valdez accident was clearly the major reason 
for lower net income in 1989," said Exxon Chairman Lawrence G. Rawl in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
The charges from the Valdez cleanup were partly offset by a one-time gain from 
a change in accounting methods in the first quarter as a result of changes in 
federal tax law. That raised Exxon's income by $535 million for the year. 
</P>
<P>
Without the cleanup charge and accounting gain, Exxon said its net income for 
the year would have been $4.7 billion, down 10.6% from 1988, despite higher oil 
and gas prices. The decline resulted mainly from slimmer refining and marketing 
profit margins and lower earnings from chemical operations. In the fourth 
quarter, earnings before the Valdez charge were $1.28 billion, compared to 
$1.38 billion in the 1988 quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Exxon's size would insulate it from serious long-term financial 
damage from the charges. "I think they did end the year on a strong note, 
largely because of the strength in crude and natural gas pricing," said Eugene 
Nowak, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Exxon's stock, whose performance has lagged behind that of other major 
oil firms, could suffer from continuing negative publicity surrounding the 
Valdez spill and the subsequent spill of 567,000 gallons of heating oil into 
the Arthur Kill waterway between New York and New Jersey on Jan. 2. The bad 
press will undoubtedly be aggravated when the criminal trial begins next week 
of the Exxon Valdez's captain, Joseph Hazelwood. 
</P>
<P>
Smith declined to say what costs the new $500-million charge would cover. The 
previous charges covered everything from wages to boat rentals to boots, as 
well as payments so far of $177 million in claims by fishermen, cannery workers 
and other individuals affected by the spill, said Exxon spokesman James 
Robertson in Anchorage. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the state of Alaska has asked Exxon to reimburse it for about 
$34.5 million in costs; so far, Exxon has paid the state $7.4 million in cash 
and has agreed to pay bills amounting to $23 million more, said the state's Oil 
Spill Coordinating Office. Exxon must also reimburse the U.S. Coast Guard and 
other federal agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Exxon confirmed Wednesday that it would shut down its Denver 
exploration and production office, which employs about 105 people. The office's 
operations will be transferred to Midland, Tex. No decision has been made on 
the future of the workers in Denver, said Exxon spokesman Les Rogers in 
Houston.

As the guard continues changing at California's top banks, the question 
increasingly asked these days is when BankAmerica Chairman A. W. (Tom) Clausen 
will retire. 
</P>
<P>
Speculation about Clausen's retirement plans have been building for a year, 
picking up the past week in published reports in San Francisco. Conventional 
wisdom has Clausen announcing his retirement before the bank's May 24 annual 
meeting, with Vice Chairman Richard M. Rosenberg getting the top job and Chief 
Financial Officer Frank N. Newman moved up to second-in-command. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Clausen leaves it an unanswered question. In an interview this 
week in his office at the San Francisco bank's headquarters, the two-time 
BankAmerica chief executive even hinted that he might choose to stay another 
year if BankAmerica's directors ask. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say the board is kind of unpredictable, and so am I on that. I'm not going 
to be here forever, but no one is counting the days," Clausen said. 
</P>
<P>
Clausen did say that retirement is "a lot closer today than it was a year ago." 
But he also was quick to add that the bank's board will ultimately decide. 
</P>
<P>
No one would be surprised if Clausen retires as chief executive this year, if 
for no other reason than he turns 67 on Feb. 17. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the turnaround he was brought in during 1986 to engineer is 
largely complete. Last week, the once-troubled parent of Bank of America 
disclosed that it earned a record $1.1 billion in 1989. On Monday afternoon, 
Clausen addressed BankAmerica's staff, calling 1989 a "vintage year." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenberg, a former Wells Fargo executive, is 59, an age at which he could take 
over the banking company and run it for a good five years or so. Although he 
lacks much international banking experience, he led BankAmerica's successful 
assault on the lucrative retail banking business, which involves credit cards, 
home equity loans, mortgages and car loans. Many analysts say Rosenberg and 
Newman deserve as much credit as Clausen for engineering BankAmerica's 
turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenberg also has a clause in his BankAmerica contract that would pay him 
close to $1 million should he quit voluntarily before Dec. 1, an additional 
incentive for the bank to act to elevate him now. (Rosenberg's cash 
compensation in 1988 was $975,000, according to BankAmerica's last proxy 
statement; Clausen's was $1.5 million). 
</P>
<P>
But Clausen is coy in answering questions about his plans. He is known to be 
secretive regarding his personal affairs, leaving many inside and outside the 
bank to look for subtle signs about his moves. 
</P>
<P>
Interest in Clausen's future has been especially keen amid changes announced 
last week at two of the four largest California banks. 
</P>
<P>
Security Pacific Corp. Chairman Richard J. Flamson III stepped down as chief 
executive of the Los Angeles banking company last Tuesday to be succeeded by 
Robert H. Smith. A day later, First Interstate Chairman Joseph J. Pinola 
disclosed that he will retire June 1, to be succeeded by Edward M. Carson. 
Wells Fargo Chairman Carl E. Reichardt has no immediate retirement plans. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts are reluctant to declare Clausen gone because he can change his 
mind. He is known to have agonized when tapping his first heir, Samuel H. 
Armacost, over Leland S. Prussia, before retiring the first time in 1981. 
Armacost was later forced out in 1986 amid mounting problems with bad foreign 
loans, a bloated staff and management foul-ups, and Clausen was brought back. 
</P>
<P>
Clausen praises all of the likely candidates, calling Rosenberg a "remarkable 
marketer" and Newman a "world-class chief financial officer." Then he ticks off 
the names of a number of other executives he considers important to the 
turnaround, including Vice Chairman Glenhall Taylor Jr.

The New York Mercantile Exchange and Commodity Exchange Inc. said Wednesday 
that they were exploring a merger of the two markets, a combination that 
analysts said could give the Comex the most immediate rewards. 
</P>
<P>
The two commodities markets announced that they were pursuing merger 
negotiations and would form a joint board that would govern any consolidated 
company resulting from a merger. 
</P>
<P>
The exchanges, which trade precious metals and energy futures, said they agreed 
to form a joint governing board after their executive committees met Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The markets' respective boards instructed their executive committees to 
continue negotiations over the most efficient way to consolidate the 
administration and operations of the exchanges. Analysts said Nymex and Comex, 
which have been housed in the same lower Manhattan building since 1933, have 
discussed merging at various times over the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
Sharing resources would mean greater efficiency and cost savings for both 
exchanges, but particularly for the smaller commodities exchange, they said. 
</P>
<P>
The joint governing body will include a chairman who is a Nymex member, a vice 
chairman who is a Comex member, 16 Nymex member directors, eight Comex member 
directors and six public directors.

ALLERGAN ANNOUNCES LOSS, LAYOFFS

Allergan reported Wednesday a $10.2-million loss for the fourth quarter and 
said it would shut down a manufacturing plant in Irvine and eliminate 210 
positions there over the next year. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which makes eye-care and skin-care products, said it would also 
reduce 300 jobs worldwide as part of an effort to reduce expenses. 
</P>
<P>
To cover the costs of layoffs and the discontinuation of several products, 
Allergan took a one-time charge of $22.8 million in the quarter ended Dec. 31. 
The charge contributed to the quarterly loss, which contrasted with a 
$32.8-million profit in the same quarter a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
For all of 1989, Allergan made $57 million on revenue of $807 million, compared 
to a profit of $72 million on sales of $756 million a year earlier. Allergan -- 
formerly a division of SmithKline Beckman -- has been an independent company 
only since July of last year. 
</P>
<P>
Earnings and sales figures for 1988 are estimates of how Allergan would have 
done if it been a publicly traded company then.

SOCIETY: A 'SIGNIFICANT MILESTONE' FOR THE ARTS IN S.D.

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This town proved Friday that it is bigger than anybody thought. 
</P>
<P>
That evening's "The Gala at the Center," a many-layered extravaganza wrapped 
around the taping of the first America's Dance Awards and a showcase event for 
the San Diego Convention Center, had the potential to be the Exxon Valdez of 
San Diego fund-raisers. 
</P>
<P>
Its failure would not have sunk the five performing arts organizations that 
together benefitted to the tune of an estimated $250,000, but it would have 
done nothing to smooth the increasingly roiled waters of local fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
Among the rocks and shoals in the party's path were the many unknowns of 
staging a monumental event -- in some respects, it was the largest in San Diego 
history -- at the massive new center on Harbor Drive, a building with spaces 
and dimensions that dwarf those of any other in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Of equal significance was the response of many regular gala-goers, who 
chorused, "Not me, Buddy," when invitations were mailed asking for ticket 
purchases at $1,500 or $5,000 a couple. 
</P>
<P>
But the last-minute sale of tickets priced at $125 brought the black-tie 
attendance to more than 2,000, and, somehow, the logistics of feeding, moving 
and entertaining more than 4,000 attendees were solved by 5 p.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a significant milestone, and a sign that the arts and culture are 
really hitting their stride in San Diego," said a very pleased Ernest Hahn, one 
of the evening's honorary co-chairmen and the man acknowledged by insiders as 
godfather of the gala's success. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the terror of a lifetime," said event producer Kit Goldman as the 
first guests began streaming up the outdoor ceremonial staircase that leads to 
the center's bayside reception rooms. "You want everything to work, and it is 
working, but I won't relax until the guests are eating, drinking and being 
merry." 
</P>
<P>
Goldman's Gaslamp Quarter Theatre Company will share the gala's proceeds with 
the Bowery Theatre, the San Diego Repertory Theatre, Sushi, the San Diego 
Foundation for the Performing Arts and the "I Have a Dream" scholarship fund 
jointly founded by the beneficiaries to assist local students pursuing careers 
in the performing arts. 
</P>
<P>
A crush of limousines and buses delivered the crowd into the arms of Marine 
Corps and Navy personnel, who escorted guests down the Hollywood-style red 
carpet and set them loose in Goldman's elaborately contrived fun house, a 
series of reception rooms outfitted with movie studio-like sound stages that 
invited guests to don costumes and be videotaped in scenes from "Gone with the 
Wind," "Destry Rides Again," "Dracula" and other film classics. The tapes were 
played hours later for the general amusement at the post-performance supper, 
and, since supper was a far-off event, elaborate buffets offered witty rehashes 
of the films' motifs. Tables near the "Dracula" set, for example, bore great 
platters of steak tartare and blood sausage. 
</P>
<P>
Dance patron Danah Fayman, who co-chaired the gala with former San Diego 
Charger Kellen Winslow, was among those who assigned the focus of the event 
more to the convention center than to the dance awards program, even though the 
show included appearances by such dance greats as Shirley MacLaine, 
Ann-Margret, Sammy Davis Jr., Harold and Fayard Nicholas (The Nicholas 
Brothers), Cyd Charisse, Chita Rivera, Patrick Swayze and Liza Minnelli. 
</P>
<P>
"Finally, it's really happening, at last," Fayman said. "A few people thought 
tonight would never happen, but I never doubted. Too many people and groups -- 
and the city, for that matter -- wanted to celebrate this terrific building for 
the gala not to happen." 
</P>
<P>
The guest list, if it included a relatively small percentage of those on the 
city's charity ball circuit, was certainly diversified. Among those bobbing and 
weaving through the crowd were Gayle and Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.); 
diminutive sex therapist Dr. Ruth Westheimer; perennial America's Cup skipper 
Dennis Conner with his wife, Judy, and developer Doug Manchester with his wife, 
Betsy. 
</P>
<P>
Fortified with quail legs and guacamole against the two-hour duration of the 
awards taping, guests headed down to the main-floor auditorium and settled into 
cushioned folding chairs whose backs are stamped "San Diego Convention Center," 
possibly to protect them against a fate similar to that suffered by countless 
supermarket shopping carts. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd applauded politely as choreographer Paula Abdul accepted three 
"Gypsies," as the awards granted by the recently organized National Academy of 
Dance are known, sat up straight when former first lady Betty Ford presented 
and accepted the Dance Hall of Fame recognition given choreographer Martha 
Graham, and cheered with a notable degree of enthusiasm when Ann-Margret strode 
on stage to present the "Best Dance in a Television Special " Gypsy to 
Disney/MGM Studios Theme Park Opening, which was accepted by legendary hoofer 
Ann Miller and legendary rodent Mickey Mouse. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the celebrities skipped the post-performance gala, but Betty Ford and 
Liza Minelli joined the 1,400 who sat down to dinner in the cavernous upstairs 
banquet hall. (Other hundreds in yet another ticket category attended a banquet 
before the program, and the arrangements for the overall event were, quite 
simply, staggeringly monumental.) 
</P>
<P>
Servers numbering 150 in white mess jackets and gloves stood at attendance as 
the throng streamed endlessly into the room, the Wayne Foster Orchestra caused 
immediate traffic jams on both immense dance floors and the video monitors 
played to no one, since the eyes of the crowd were turned upon itself. 
</P>
<P>
The dinner, the first formal banquet to be served at the convention center, was 
ambitious and consisted of salmon Charlotte, veal chops in morel mushroom sauce 
and chocolate shells filled with vanilla mousse. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson took a brief turn at the podium and declared the event "a very special 
night for San Diego and a very special night for the arts." 
</P>
<P>
Co-chair Winslow offered a longer and quite optimistic address. 
</P>
<P>
"We have just seen the start of a great tradition in San Diego, and I hope you 
all realize the magnitude of this event," he said. "Next year, there will be 
twice as many people here, and the year after that three times as many, and, 
after the center is expanded, we will use the whole facility." 
</P>
<P>
Among the many others in attendance were steering committee chairman Ed Plant 
with Kathy Hubbard; dinner chairman Sharon Considine; finance chair Stan 
Heyman; Barry McComic; George Saadeh; San Diego Convention and Visitors Bureau 
director Dal Watkins; City Council members Abbe Wolfsheimer and Ron Roberts, 
and Ed Cooperman, president and CEO of American Express Travel Related Services 
Co., the corporate presenter of America's Dance Awards.

ARCHITECTURE: OCEANSIDE CIVIC CENTER BOTH PLEASES, PERPLEXES;

<P>
DESIGN: THE CENTER HAS STRONG TIES TO SURROUNDING STREETS, WHICH SHOULD SPUR

<TEXT>
<P>
This image-conscious, beachfront city is about to become an architectural 
mecca. A new civic center designed by Charles Moore is a pleasing and 
perplexing piece of work, the kind of place that should gain national 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
More importantly, the center's human scale, wit and strong ties to the 
surrounding streets should provide the fabric that the city's threadbare core 
needs so desperately. 
</P>
<P>
Already, several new projects are scheduled to break ground nearby, including 
an apartment/retail complex, the kind of mixed use so effective in downtowns. 
</P>
<P>
Moore, who designed the legendary '60s condominiums at the Sea Ranch in Sonoma 
County, the Piazza d'Italia in New Orleans and a soon-to-be-built theaters 
complex for Escondido, has given Oceanside a late-century homage to early 
20th-Century San Diego architect Irving Gill. 
</P>
<P>
Among the civic center's strong points are its rich detailing, sensitive 
siting, subtle echoes of Irving Gill and a nod to the importance of the 
automobile. Weaknesses include detailing, which at times obscures strong basic 
lines, and colors so whimsical that they sometimes distract from the solid 
architecture. 
</P>
<P>
Also, there's the bare backside of the City Council building, which Moore 
envisioned as cloaked in vine-covered trellises. These were vetoed by the 
current council after being approved by its predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
In 1929, Gill drew his own plans for a civic center on this same site in the 
middle of downtown at North Hill Street and 3rd Avenue, featuring his trademark 
arched arcades. Although most of the complex was never realized, his fire 
station and administrative building still stand on Nevada Street. These will 
eventually be renovated and put to city use. 
</P>
<P>
Moore's design incorporates several Gill-inspired arches. Most often, these are 
used at the edges of covered public walkways that provide key pedestrian 
circulation. 
</P>
<P>
But, where Gill's architecture was spare modernism, Moore, hailed by many as a 
forefather of the postmodern movement, believes in rich ornamentation and a 
more light-hearted approach. 
</P>
<P>
Although the civic center has some of Gill's austerity, it has much more of 
Moore's own playful complexity, nowhere more apparent than in several of the 
public areas, where most of the money for ornamentation was spent on the 
colorful tiles. These flow like a rainbow sherbet river up walls and down a 
mock alluvial fan leading into the fractured geometries of a large fountain. 
</P>
<P>
A powerful perspective on these colors can be had from mid-block on Ditmar 
Street, looking west through the heart of the project. A soaring opening marks 
the center of the project, its ziggurat forms lined with maize, gray, mauve and 
red tiles. Below this pedestrian entry, workers were putting the finishing 
touches on a palm fountain to be bordered by eight tall lights in the form of 
palm trees. 
</P>
<P>
Expanses of tile frame the entrance to the City Council chamber lobby, a 
wonderful space beneath a gigantic rectangular skylight, where a dramatic sky 
bridge crosses overhead to connect this building with the one next door. 
</P>
<P>
Progress on the council chamber was slowed when the city decided to add such 
high-tech features as large-screen television. 
</P>
<P>
A tour of the various offices in the center, the first of which should be 
occupied late in February, shows up a few shortcomings. The partitioned work 
cubicles often clutter the spaces and block valuable light and views. Project 
design consultant Robbin Hayne said the architects wanted lower partition 
walls, and he wishes they had lobbied harder. 
</P>
<P>
Looking out from upper-level offices and hallways, the viewer is often 
confronted with unsightly rooftop mechanical equipment. Hayne said there wasn't 
sufficient budget to hide these appliances. 
</P>
<P>
On a larger scale, though, the project succeeds magnificently with its two 
grandest gestures: a pedestrian space at the southwestern corner and the 
automobile entry along Ditmar Street, which runs through the project beneath an 
enclosed pedestrian bridge between two of the buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Working with Urban Innovations Group of Los Angeles and production architects 
Danielson Design of San Juan Capistrano, Moore was selected from a talented 
field in a 1986 competition. 
</P>
<P>
Edgardo Contini, former president of UIG, had a hand in the design, lending his 
rational site planning to the group of designers who helped Moore work in his 
favorite team fashion. 
</P>
<P>
Hayne remembers the creation of the tiled "alluvial fan" that runs downhill 
through the center of the project, culminating in the large public fountain 
near the corner of Hill and Third streets. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the result of Charles having pencil in hand and drawing it during a 
design session. He is wholly responsible." 
</P>
<P>
Moore's unconventional alluvial fan and fountain, with their jagged angles, are 
screened by a grid of palm trees anchoring the corner in the most orderly 
fashion. Here's the epitome of Moore's left and right brains working in happy 
tandem, as they do, with varying degrees of success, throughout the project. 
</P>
<P>
The library is the only portion of the project now in use. Its witty interior 
is marred only by mundane oak shelving and counters. The entry space has 
amazing energy. It rises to two stories, ringed by huge clerestory windows 
which make artificial lighting unnecessary during daylight hours. Study carrels 
line the second-floor railing behind arches set atop long, thin columns. 
</P>
<P>
Moving through this main space, one gets a sense of awe and respect appropriate 
for the repository of the city's knowledge and history. 
</P>
<P>
The northern side of the project is the least visible, but generates its own 
architectural excitement. A series of concrete buttresses fly toward the street 
from the parking garage, as if to prove that acres of rainbow tiles aren't 
essential to creating dramatic architecture. 
</P>
<P>
The city is considering painting these bold forms. Pray that they don't. 
Architects and citizens should fight tooth and nail to preserve these finely 
crafted, unadorned details. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy pressure is also needed to make the city change its mind regarding the 
trellises Moore designed to soften the stark walls of the council chamber 
building. Of their $320,000 total cost, $160,000 had been spent when the new 
council did their flip-flop last summer. In an homage to Gill, these would have 
warmed the plain, white walls, including two five-sided turrets, with flowering 
vines. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe someday, someone will realize it would be nice to put them up," Hayne 
said.

WHAT'S A 9-LETTER WORD FOR AN UNUSUAL COLLEGE COURSE? CROSSWORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN LOEWENTHAL, Loewenthal is a Westlake Village free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Edward Julius loves to double-cross his college students, who suffer from 
gridlock that isn't caused by their evening commute to class. 
</P>
<P>
Students who take his "Crossword Construction for Fun and Profit" are 
frustrated but intrigued by their latest homework assignment -- to complete a 
symmetrical grid of 11 squares per side using correctly interlocking 
crosswords. 
</P>
<P>
The rare course on strategies of professional puzzle makers is being taught on 
five Wednesdays through the end of this month at California Lutheran University 
by Julius, a business professor who is known among puzzlers for the innovations 
he has brought to the craft. 
</P>
<P>
The Cal Lutheran course is "certainly a novelty whether it's here or on the 
East Coast," says Stan Newman, who edits New York Newsday's Sunday puzzle and 
taught a similar course last year at Hofstra University on Long Island. He 
credits Julius with "making the crossword puzzle appeal to people under age 
40." 
</P>
<P>
Most activity in the puzzle world -- from tournaments to crossword societies -- 
takes place in New York. The editor of the San Francisco Examiner's Sunday 
puzzle, Merl Reagle, adds, "As far as I know, Ed's course is the only one this 
side of the Mississippi." 
</P>
<P>
"His puzzles are fresh and innovative. They bring crosswords into the 1990s, 
using language that people know, but that doesn't make them easy," says Will 
Shortz, editor of Games magazine. He says Julius' "New Wave" puzzles use verbal 
tricks, puns, modern trivia, popular culture, movies, TV shows, and songs, and 
rely less on traditional opera and mythology. 
</P>
<P>
Julius, who began constructing puzzles 30 years ago when he was 7, last offered 
the one-unit course in 1982, and he says he'll probably offer it again next 
January. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody laughed about the class. They respect it now because they realize 
it's difficult and challenging," says Claudine Mullenaux, 21, a junior from 
Pacific Palisades and one of 15 students in the class. An education major, she 
plans to use her new skills to develop a creative third-grade curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
"Theme puzzles would be good to reinforce spelling words or vocabulary in a 
science unit," she says, adding that she believes the puzzles could develop 
"higher-level thinking" that involves evaluation, not just simple recognition. 
</P>
<P>
Barb Smith, 46, a mother of five from Camarillo who is also preparing to be a 
teacher, says, "My 19-year-old helped me with last week's homework." She looks 
forward to the session on writing "dull vs. dynamic clues," and has gained more 
appreciation for the human mind. "Even if a computer could generate a puzzle, 
it would be sterile and unimaginative." 
</P>
<P>
Manual Alvarez, 21, had not worked with crossword puzzles until last semester 
when they were assigned as homework in his beginning public speaking class. 
Alvarez, who speaks Spanish at home, says his English has been enriched by the 
assignments. 
</P>
<P>
Martha and Walter Gutman took the course together eight years ago. The avid 
crossword fans never use dictionaries to solve them. "We only do them in ink. I 
correct my puzzles later in red ink so I keep on learning," says Martha Gutman, 
61, a faculty secretary. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband, also 61, formerly an accountant and vice president of Macmillan 
Publishing, taught his own course a year later at The Learning Tree University 
in Thousand Oaks. He most enjoyed, "seeing people who had been trying for years

Julius' puzzling career began when he was a sophomore at Rutgers College in 
1972, when he devised a puzzle for college papers. He still syndicates weekly 
puzzles today to about 100 colleges. It takes him up to 15 hours to prepare a 
college grid, but he'll spend up to 50 hours concocting a Sunday New York Times 
puzzle, which he sells occasionally -- he says the time spent isn't worth the 
effort. He has written six Bantam crossword books in addition to several 
best-selling study guides in accounting.

Each of the Cal Lutheran sessions lasts three hours. Students begin with 
warm-up mental exercises including anagrams, palindromes, and fill-in letters. 
They become familiar with reference works and tools used by professionals, as 
well as how to market crosswords. 
</P>
<P>
"A knowledge of American English is very important," Reagle says. During his 
guest lecture on "The Puzz Biz," Reagle discussed the history and evolution of 
crosswords and advocated consistency in selecting words to construct a "Theme" 
puzzle. 
</P>
<P>
Students also learn to analyze the best positions and sequence for placing 
vowels and consonants to achieve a successful interlock. "Be fair. If you 
construct an obscure word, be sure to use easy crossing words so that every 
letter can be reasonably solved," warns Julius, who doesn't like to solve 
puzzles -- he says he isn't good at it. 
</P>
<P>
"I solve one puzzle a year if you round up," Julius says.

India-born Roopa Chawla does much of her grocery shopping at the Vons near her 
Granada Hills home. But once a month, she visits Bombay Spiceland in Northridge 
to stock up on Indian foods she can't find in her supermarket -- moong and 
besan flour, mustard oil and vegetables such as sweet green squash. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a delicacy you can't find in the supermarket," Chawla said, picking up 
a leafy bunch of green methi, which she cooks the same way as spinach. 
</P>
<P>
"Indians are very conscious of different tastes in their food," she added, 
pointing out more than two dozen varieties of beans, lentils and whole spices. 
</P>
<P>
Chawla, a bilingual coordinator for the Los Angeles Unified School District, 
said that when she moved to the Valley 10 years ago, there was not much in the 
way of exotic food available in the supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to go every six months or so to an Indian store in Orange County to 
stock up," she said, leaning against a pallet of 25- and 50-pound bags of 
basmati rice. "Now, there must be 10 or 12 Indian stores in the Valley." 
</P>
<P>
Supermarkets aren't the only stores to cash in on the growing demand for ethnic 
foods. The number of small specialty markets in the Valley is growing, 
according to the Southern California Assn. of Grocers, and store owners report 
that their client base is expanding. 
</P>
<P>
"More Americans are trying different foods," said Jane Kanji, the owner of 
Bombay Spiceland. Although a majority of her customers are Indian immigrants or 
of Indian descent, Kanji said, the store has begun to attract Valley residents 
of all backgrounds. Every weekend she sells trays of vegetable samoza, a fried 
triangular hors d'oeuvre, to local party-givers, who, she reports, also like 
the cashew barfi, a dessert made of raw milk, sugar, butter and cashews. 
</P>
<P>
Tomi Ryan, who teaches cooking at the Learning Tree, Everywoman's Village, Los 
Angeles Valley College and Glendale Community College, touts the Valley as an 
ethnic paradise because of its wide selection of specialty markets. 
</P>
<P>
"There are wonderful Persian, Chinese, Japanese and Thai markets," she said. 
"Eastern cuisine is so well-covered. No place else has the luxury that we do in 
Los Angeles, in the availability of food items." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the items that Ryan seeks at ethnic stores are jellyfish, endaui (a 
spicy sausage), or spices such as whole white pepper, mace and summer savory. 
</P>
<P>
Cecelia DeCastro, a food writer who teaches cooking at UCLA Extension in 
Woodland Hills and the Ma Maison cooking school in Newport Beach, looks to 
specialty stores for lemon grass, Oriental eggplant and bitter melon, as well 
as conch, vanilla clams and macatuno coconuts, which she uses in desserts such 
as litchi flan or jelly rolls. 
</P>
<P>
"Luckily, there are a lot of Oriental markets in the Valley," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Gloria Alvarez, executive director of operations for the Mexican American 
Grocers Assn., said smaller neighborhood groceries also continue to flourish in 
ethnic neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"Culturally, new immigrants feel more comfortable shopping first in smaller 
independents," Alvarez said. "As they assimilate, they go to larger chains." 
</P>
<P>
Rosa Sanchez of Pacoima does most of her shopping at Tresierras, a Latino 
market there. "I like the meat and the Mexican products," she said as she stood 
in line at the butcher counter on a busy Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Customers were waiting to buy such items as steak ranchero (beef flank), 
chili-basted pork, chicken gizzards, menudo, beef feet and lips, tripe, marrow 
and guts. There was also a small selection of catfish, shrimp and perch. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez, buying thinly sliced meat for tacos, chicken and six dozen tortillas, 
said she also likes to buy Mexican brands of some products, such as Ariel 
detergent and Embasa chilies. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Salazar, assistant manager, said many Latinos, especially if they don't 
speak much English, like to shop at specialty stores because they feel more 
comfortable. "They feel they can talk to us if they can't find something. We 
carry a lot of Mexican brands; we have signs in Spanish. There are some things 
they can't find in other stores, like queso cotija or requeson (white cheeses 
used in many dishes)."

<P>
Better ribs than Bobby Humphrey's can be found almost anywhere in this city. On 
Sammy Winder. On John Elway. On any plate in any restaurant, blackened or 
barbecued, spare or short. 
</P>
<P>
Humphrey's are broken. Cracked, if you're from Denver, because the sound is 
supposedly softer on Bronco ears. But a crack is an incomplete break and an 
incomplete break doesn't hurt any less than any other classification. 
</P>
<P>
They're broken. 
</P>
<P>
Humphrey and the Broncos have been doing their damnedest to deny it, because 
they're damned if they don't. Doctors have told Humphrey he'd be best waiting 
another five or six weeks before exposing those ribs to Ronnie Lott, but the 
Super Bowl comes only once a year and this year's happens Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
No, Humphrey and the Broncos have no chance. It's a simple play book. Before 
Humphrey, Denver tried Tony Dorsett, Steve Sewell and Winder at running back 
and went 8-8. After Humphrey, and including his 1,153 rookie rushing yards, the 
Broncos are back in the Super Bowl, for better or for worse, whatever it may 
get them against the San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
Humphrey has tried to talk his way into the starting lineup this week, but the 
platform is getting weaker by the day. 
</P>
<P>
Humphrey on Tuesday: "We're gonna wrap it up, patch it up, tape it up, whatever 
it takes for me to play. It'll take 10 bodybuilders to tie me up and hold me 
down to get me out of this game." 
</P>
<P>
Denver Coach Dan Reeves on Wednesday: "In watching Humphrey practice, if he is 
not 100% by the end of the week, he will not play. I don't think you can go 
into a game of this caliber with someone worrying about pain with the ribs 
while running the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Humphrey on Wednesday: "If I can't go my whole, I don't think I should be out 
there. If the ribs won't let me perform the way I want to perform, I feel like 
I should be on the sidelines watching." 
</P>
<P>
Ten bodybuilders were not present when he said it. 
</P>
<P>
That little helmet transplant Cleveland cornerback Hanford Dixon attempted on 
Humphrey two Sundays ago has proven a real pain to Denver. Humphrey was on his 
way down after a second-quarter carry, bracing himself for the fall, when Dixon 
buried his head into Humphrey's side, an orange bullet. 
</P>
<P>
Humphrey was left with two cracked ribs. Soon after, he left the game, not to 
return, and Winder took his place and took the Broncos to the end zone twice. 
</P>
<P>
That makes it easier for Humphrey to say the right thing when questioned about 
the possibility of not playing Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no doubt in mind that if I can't go, Sammy Winder can go in and have a 
great game, like he did against Cleveland," he says. 
</P>
<P>
But who, aside from maybe Winder, and then only maybe, actually believes that? 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos have tried it this way before. In the 1988 Super Bowl against 
Washington, Winder had as many rushes as any Denver back -- eight -- and ended 
up with 30 yards. In the 1987 Super Bowl against the New York Giants, Winder 
carried the ball four times . . . for zero yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos' leading rusher in that 39-20 loss? Elway, with 27 yards. 
</P>
<P>
With no running game, Elway had no way out in either game. So he passed against 
defenses that knew he had to pass -- 38 times against the Redskins, 37 times 
against the Giants. And the Broncos ended up losing those games by margins of 
32 and 19 points. 
</P>
<P>
If Humphrey is out, or ineffective, what's to stop it from happening again? 
</P>
<P>
And consider: Neither Washington nor New York had Joe Montana. 
</P>
<P>
Elway is a realist. 
</P>
<P>
"If Bobby isn't in there, we'll probably have to throw the ball more and change 
things a little offensively," he says. "We're just hoping Bobby will be there." 
</P>
<P>
And if not? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think, consciously, I'll put any more weight on my shoulders," Elway 
says. "There's already enough there." 
</P>
<P>
Rocky Mountain-sized. 
</P>
<P>
Humphrey says: "I'm not going to say I'm the key factor in the ballgame or that 
I'm the guy who's going to win the game for us, but as a group, the guys want 
me in there. They want me to play. I'm one of those missing links that's going 
to hurt." 
</P>
<P>
So Humphrey tapes his rib cage tightly, dons a flak jacket and gives it a go in 
practice. Wednesday marked the first time he had taken a hit since the AFC 
final. More practices and more hits will have to be sampled before Reeves and 
Humphrey determine how much Humphrey, and how much of Humphrey, will fly come 
Sunday.

Humphrey has played in pain before. He broke his left foot twice at the 
University of Alabama in 1988 and still finished third on the team in rushing. 
He has played with a hip pointer. 
</P>
<P>
But never with broken ribs. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Humphrey said it hurt him to breathe. Now, he says it only hurts when 
he makes "a sharp movement" -- like cutting inside or outside or shifting gears 
to avoid a 49er lineman. 
</P>
<P>
Something as basic as cradling the football now becomes a problem. Does 
Humphrey carry it right side only? And how to deal with the extra bulk provided 
by the heavy flak jacket? 
</P>
<P>
"Hanging onto the ball, that's going to be a very important (challenge)," 
Humphrey says. "Wearing something bulky like that, you can't get a real feel 
for the ball. You can't really sense the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Against San Francisco, one Denver fumble could be one too many. 
</P>
<P>
At any rate, the Broncos will play without a fully equipped running attack. 
Either Humphrey plays with an amount of apprehension or he doesn't play at all. 
</P>
<P>
Either way, Denver's chances don't look good. If not broken, at the very least, 
they're cracked.

CLIPPER PLAYERS WON'T ACCEPT COACH'S EXCUSES FOR THEIR LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SAN ANTONIO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maybe Don Casey knows exactly what he's saying. Maybe he is trying to soften 
the blow for his players, trying to find some reason for a stagnant offense, 
other than a stagnant offense. 
</P>
<P>
The injury to Ron Harper is a good explanation. The Clipper players, however, 
don't go for their coach's reasoning. They will take the harsh reality of a 
106-98 loss to the San Antonio Spurs at HemisFair Arena. 
</P>
<P>
"He wants excuses," guard Gary Grant said Wednesday night, when the Clippers 
were held to fewer than 100 points for the second time in the four games that 
Harper has been out. "It's not Harper. How is it Harper? Hit him in the corner 
and let him go one-on-one? We're just not executing plays. . . . We miss his 
scoring, sure, but we don't miss him in terms of executing. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had excuses every year. We know we can play. But we beat Seattle without 
Harper, and they're a tough team. No one said anything about missing Harper 
then." 
</P>
<P>
So, valid opinion or not, Casey shouldn't try to sell it in the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't buy that," Danny Manning said after making 13 of 20 shots for a 
career-high 31 points. "There's no question we miss him, but, in my opinion, 
not to that extent. We've beat good teams without him." 
</P>
<P>
But the Clippers (18-21) have also lost to bad teams without him. San Antonio, 
which moved back into a first-place tie with Utah in the Midwest Division at 
27-11, certainly doesn't fit that description, but Casey had reached his 
conclusion long before this defeat. 
</P>
<P>
"The loss is monumental," Casey said of Harper's absence for the rest of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
In four games without Harper, the Clippers: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Have gone 2-2, beating Seattle by 10 and Minnesota by two (with a layup at 
the buzzer) and losing the two most recent games, Sacramento by 32 and San 
Antonio by eight. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Scored an average of 101 points, about two points below their season 
average. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Shot a respectable 48.6%. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, Manning and Ken Norman, who have combined to take over for Harper at 
shooting guard, also almost made up for his absence in the scorebook. 
</P>
<P>
Norman finished with 24 points. Manning had 22 in the first half alone. That 
was against a team whose coach is Manning's former college coach, Larry Brown, 
and whose assistant is Manning's father, Ed. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers were within 56-53 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
They lost ground in the third quarter, when the Spurs went ahead, 74-63, with 
4:58 left on Willie Anderson's baseline jump shot. Then, San Antonio finished 
the quarter with a 7-0 run, making it 87-73. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers responded by closing the gap to 93-86 with 7:59 to play and then 
cut it to 95-90 on Charles Smith's 10-footer from the left baseline with 4:37 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
But the Spurs, who won by a point when the teams met at the Sports Arena in 
November, made sure there would be no close finishes this time, using an 11-0 
surge for a 106-90 cushion with 2:02 left. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't keep it up," Manning said. "We had the effort for most of the 
game. We just need to be able to do it for 48 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
Added Casey, who was concerned how the Clippers would react after Monday's 
blowout loss at Sacramento: "I thought our effort was tremendous. "But we 
really got annihilated by Robinson inside." 
</P>
<P>
That came as no surprise. David Robinson has done a little of that this season, 
his rookie year by label only. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a rookie experience-wise," Anderson said. "Other than that . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Other than that, Robinson looked the part of a defensive power who should have 
rookie-of-the-year honors wrapped up by the all-star break. To his already 
impressive numbers, add 24 points, 11 rebounds and seven blocked shots in this 
game. 
</P>
<P>
And it was the Spurs' 17th consecutive victory at the HemisFair, tying a 
franchise record. They are 18-1 at HemisFair, the only loss was Nov. 8 against 
Portland. 
</P>
<P>
"It really feels good to tie the home winning record," said Anderson, who had 
21 points. "But it's going to feel a heckuva lot better when we break it." 
</P>
<P>
That's a notion for Charlotte to deal with Jan. 31, not the Clippers. They 
don't return until April 12. Ron Harper won't be part of the team then, either. 
</P>
<P>
Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
With his sore left knee showing little sign of improving, Tom Garrick will 
probably be held out of tonight's game at Houston. The second-year guard, who 
has tendinitis, has been held out of two of the last five games and played a 
total of 18 minutes in the other three, including 11 against the Spurs. "He 
can't function," Coach Don Casey said. "He's just not well enough." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Four steals gave San Antonio's Maurice Cheeks 2,001 for his career, the first 
person in NBA history to surpass 2,000. . . . Gary Grant had 10 points and 15 
assists but also seven turnovers.

RILEY GETS 500TH VICTORY ON THE FAST TRACK AT INDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

INDIANAPOLIS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As he has probably done 499 other times as Laker coach, Pat Riley made sure 
that the final seconds of a victory Wednesday night ticked away without delay 
and then nonchalantly strolled off the court. 
</P>
<P>
Not so fast, Pat. 
</P>
<P>
Before Riley could take a few steps and begin to savor the Lakers' 120-111 
victory over the Indiana Pacers before 16,912 at Market Square Arena, he was 
double-teammed by assistant coaches Bill Bertka and Randy Pfund. Handshakes and 
backslaps were exchanged in acknowledgment of Riley's 500th regular-season 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
He earned those victories in 684 games. It was the quickest any NBA coach has 
done it. Before Riley, Golden State Coach Don Nelson had reached that milestone 
in the fewest games, 817, in 1986. In addition to that milestone, Wednesday's 
victory ensured Riley's spot as coach for the Western Conference in next 
month's All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
Consistent with Riley's controlled personality, he tried to play down the 
achievement. No one would let him, though. Players briefly chanted "500" in 
front of their coach. Later, they gave testimonials to Riley's coaching ability 
and perceived lack of recognition. 
</P>
<P>
All of those 184 losses probably still bother Riley, but he seemed to fully 
embrace this victory. Call this his personal Indianapolis 500. 
</P>
<P>
And, only when asked, Riley talked about what 500 victories means to him. Turns 
out, it means a lot. 
</P>
<P>
"It sure does," Riley said. "I've always said that milestones for coaches and 
players are great. They are the residual rewards for winning. All the things 
that lead up to the winning are what really matters. I just can't believe I've 
already coached about 700 games. It seems like just yesterday I started out on 
Nov. 19, 1981 with a 137-117 win against San Antonio." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, it was a 136-116 victory over San Antonio on Nov. 20, 1981. But that 
is quibbling. Riley has, indeed, made a quantum leap since that first game 
after replacing Paul Westhead. 
</P>
<P>
Carrying on quite efficiently without Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Riley has the Lakers 
at an NBA-best 30-9. They finished this difficult trip with a 3-1 record, 
including victories over Detroit and New York and Wednesday's strong effort 
over the improved Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
Several Lakers had big games. 
</P>
<P>
Magic Johnson had 32 points and eight assists. He sank 11 of 15 shots. A.C. 
Green made 12 of 13 shots, many from the perimeter, for 24 points. Green also 
had 11 rebounds. James Worthy had a career-high 12 assists to go with 17 
points, and Mychal Thompson tied his season high with 19 points. 
</P>
<P>
The taxing trip over, Riley even relaxed enough to joke about all the fuss over 
his 500 victories. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll say the same thing I said after the 100th, 200th, 300th, 400th, 500th 
and, if I'm still around then after my 600th win," Riley said. "That is: If I 
had a little more talent, I would've won 'em quicker." 
</P>
<P>
Only now, it seems, is Riley earning a modicum of credit for at least a few of 
those victories. He has, after all, never won the coach of the year award even 
though he has guided the Lakers to four NBA titles. 
</P>
<P>
Does the 500th validate Riley's coaching prowess? 
</P>
<P>
"That's up to you guys to decide," Riley said. "I feel like I've made it." 
</P>
<P>
When Riley made it to the locker room after Wednesday's game, he was greeted by 
a chorus of chants from Laker players. 
</P>
<P>
"We were counting off all of his victories, from one to 500," Thompson said. 
"We did it the Evelyn Wood speed-reading counting method, the same way we took 
our SATs in college." 
</P>
<P>
In a more serious vein, Laker players from Worthy to Johnson to Byron Scott 
praised Riley, though Worthy admitted the 500th-victory scenario was not an 
issue until after the game. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of great coaches out there," Worthy said. "But, as far as 
winning goes, year-to-year, you have to look at Riley." 
</P>
<P>
Added Scott: "He's done it quicker than anybody, and that's saying something. I 
think now he is getting the (recognition). Now that Kareem's gone, and we still 
got the best record in basketball and (are) playing great, people are starting 
to notice him." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who along with Michael Cooper, is the only holdover from Riley's first 
victory, said he has "matured" as a coach. 
</P>
<P>
"To win 100 or 200 games is a great accomplishment, but 500 is amazing," 
Johnson said. "I'm proud of him. He's been the head of this gang -- I mean 
group of men -- for a long time. And he hasn't always gotten the credit. 
</P>
<P>
"He's matured as everyone else has matured -- as a coach and a person. He's a 
good friend, a guy you can talk to about more than just the X's and O's. He's a 
players' coach. He understands what we go through, (player) No. 1 one through 
12. It's important to know every player." 
</P>
<P>
Knowing the current Lakers as he does, Riley did not expect them to fold 
Wednesday night just because it was the end of a trip that consisted of four 
games in six days, including intense victories over the Pistons and Knicks and 
a last-second loss to Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
Though weary, the Lakers never let the Pacers, off for the previous four days, 
lead by more than five points. Indiana took an 89-88 lead into the fourth 
quarter, but the Lakers scored the first six points of the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana cut the deficit to one point on four occasions, only to have the Lakers 
pull away again. The Pacers made their last stand with 3:52 left, when Mike 
Sanders tipped in Detlef Schrempf's miss to cut the Lakers' lead to 106-105. 
</P>
<P>
After an exchange of possessions and then a timeout, the Lakers pulled away for 
good. Scott sank a three-point shot with 3:01 to play; Johnson sank two free 
throws with 2:23 to play and Johnson made a three-point shot with 1:52 to play 
for a 114-105 lead. The Pacers, scoreless on their three possessions, were 
finished despite making 57.7% of their shots. The Lakers sank 58.4%. 
</P>
<P>
As far as intensity and marquee value, a victory over the Pacers does not rate 
with wins over the Pistons and Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
But Riley, not totally stopping to savor the milestone, talked about how 
important Wednesday's victory was in the context of the Lakers' season. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anybody's going to win the championship unless they have the 
home court for the playoffs," Riley said. "San Antonio, Utah and Portland, I'm 
sure they are waiting and waiting for us to lose on the road. But this team is 
not cracking. They could have settled for a 2-2 trip. But 3-1 is a lot better." 
</P>
<P>
By the same token, 500-184 is not bad for a coach, either. 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Reggie Miller led Indiana with 27 points. Miller made 11 of 13 shots, his only 
two misses coming in the second half. . . . A. C. Green made his first 11 shots 
before missing a layup with 2:32 to play in the third quarter. Green promptly 
grabbed the rebound and converted the miss. It was the only shot he missed all 
game. . . . For the second time in the last three games, center Vlade Divac did 
not play in the second half. In Detroit, Coach Pat Riley said he did not play 
Divac because the play was too physical for him. Wednesday, Riley said Divac 
sat because Indiana went with a smaller lineup that had 6-foot-10 Detlef 
Schrempf at center. "Vlade is not in the doghouse," Riley said. "That's just 
the way it turned out." . . . The Lakers are off today and play the Milwaukee 
Bucks Friday night at the Forum.

<P>
Terry Bradshaw, after a one-day stay in New Orleans, returned to his ranch near 
Dallas on Wednesday, unaware that he had started Super Bowl Week's first major 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
There are more than 2,000 reporters here to cover Sunday's Super Bowl, and all 
are looking for something a little different, possibly a little controversial. 
</P>
<P>
Bradshaw unknowingly supplied that Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference to promote a commercial, in which Bradshaw has a role, a 
few writers, including The Times' Mike Downey, asked Bradshaw to evaluate 
quarterbacks Joe Montana and John Elway. 
</P>
<P>
Bradshaw, the only quarterback to have won four Super Bowls, said Montana was 
great but that Elway was not. "(He's) very good, but he's not great," Bradshaw 
said. "He's inconsistent." 
</P>
<P>
Bradshaw added that Elway needs to get tougher emotionally and that he 
shouldn't complain about his lack of privacy. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, you make $2 million a year, you'd better expect some attention, boy!" 
Bradshaw said. "Wait'll you have to go out there and get a real job!" 
</P>
<P>
Bradshaw also pointed out that Elway has never won any championships and said 
that he had been babied by the city of Denver and his coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Bradshaw flew from New Orleans to San Antonio Tuesday night for a speaking 
engagement before returning home. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got 10,000 messages here," he said when reached by phone. "I can't 
believe it. Well, yes, I can believe it. 
</P>
<P>
"The Super Bowl is big and everyone is looking for something to write. I do 
some writers a favor and give them an honest evaluation, and now this happens. 
</P>
<P>
"So I said John Elway is not a great quarterback. Maybe my definition of great 
is different than most people's. 
</P>
<P>
"Joe Montana is a great quarterback. He's had an historic season. I don't know 
who else is a great quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't a great quarterback. I just happened to have played on four Super 
Bowl championship teams, and in two of those games I played pretty well. In the 
other two, I was just there. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course everything is focused on the quarterback. If San Francisco scores 40 
points against the Broncos, people won't blame the defense. They'll say Elway 
should have scored 41 points. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going sugar-coat my quotes and say something different today. 
</P>
<P>
"But I simply said Elway is not a great quarterback. And I also said that, with 
the money he makes he shouldn't complain if people want to know what kind of 
candy bar he gives out on Halloween and what kind of car he drives. 
</P>
<P>
"That's really about all I said. I really don't think John has anything to be 
upset about." 
</P>
<P>
Well, Elway was upset. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Elway simply said, "I don't care what Terry Bradshaw says." 
</P>
<P>
But later in the day, after getting more details, possibly some a little 
distorted, he said: "He's criticized me throughout my career. He's jealous of 
the money I make. 
</P>
<P>
"He can stick it in his ear." 
</P>
<P>
Said Bradshaw: "I think owners today are crazy to give these young kids the 
kind of money they're giving them. Giving a kid $10 million is simply bad 
investing. No way can you get your return. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm not jealous of how much money John Elway makes. I live a comfortable 
life. I don't want his money." 
</P>
<P>
Elway, about Bradshaw's comment that he's never won a championship, said: "I've 
got to win this game. Not too many guys classified as great quarterbacks 
haven't won the championship." 
</P>
<P>
Bradshaw will be back in New Orleans Friday and will take part in CBS' pregame 
show Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Ronnie Lott, the 49ers' blunt-speaking safety, was asked about Bo Jackson, the 
Raider halfback who doubles as an outfielder for the Kansas City Royals. 
</P>
<P>
Let's just say that Lott doesn't seem amused by the phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
"For what he's getting paid and what's going on in his career, he should have 
taken them to the playoffs," Lott said. "Maybe I'm popping off a little bit 
here, but hey, that's just how I feel about the guy. I'm not trying to start 
any trouble, but when you play six games, you would expect him to play in all 
six games. 
</P>
<P>
(Jackson actually played in all 11 games after he arrived, although his numbers 
went down after suffering nagging injuries as had been the case in his first 
two seasons.) 
</P>
<P>
"When you look at somebody, you look at them for results. You don't have to 
look at somebody because they're a great athlete or how fast they run. Maybe 
it's good stories . . . but the only thing that matters, I hope, is what Mr. 
(Al) Davis always says, 'It's just win, baby.' 
</P>
<P>
"I'm biased because one of my good friends is Marcus Allen. He goes out and 
plays hurt. He has to go through a lot of adversity through the year to make a 
living and to get the respect from his teammates. That's the reason Marcus does 
the things he does, because he wants the respect of his teammates. That's the 
reason, if you ask his teammates, if they'd gone to the playoffs last year, he 
would have been the guy that was going to take them there." 
</P>
<P>
There hasn't been much controversy surrounding Montana, but he did pass on two 
questions asked during a morning press conference. 
</P>
<P>
"John Madden has said you're the greatest quarterback who has ever lived," a 
reporter said. "How do you respond to comments like that." 
</P>
<P>
Montana: "I go on to the next question?" 
</P>
<P>
From San Diego reporter Jerry Magee: "One of your ex-wives is writing a book in 
which she says she'll show another side to Joe Montana. How long a book will it 
be?" 
</P>
<P>
Montana: "About as long as I take to answer your question." 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer Mark Heisler contributed to this story.

49ERS' TAYLOR DOESN'T TALK A GOOD GAME, HE PLAYS IT

<P>
Look who's talking. 
</P>
<P>
John Taylor showed, sat and spoke. 
</P>
<P>
Stop the presses. 
</P>
<P>
At the Super Bowl, this is news. 
</P>
<P>
The sight of San Francisco's Taylor doing an interview is something you don't 
see every day. It's as rare as an out-of-state license plate in Hawaii. It's as 
strange as a movie in which John Wayne drives a car. 
</P>
<P>
Why is Taylor so reluctant? 
</P>
<P>
"I figure the less I say, the less anybody can quote me," he said. "The less 
people hear about me, the less they know. Out of sight, out of mind." 
</P>
<P>
So, why talk now? 
</P>
<P>
"They came and drug me out here," Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
In a survey of Bay Area media people by a Palo Alto paper, a survey that 
determined 49er leaders in categories ranging from Most Intelligent (Spencer 
Tillman) to Most Boring (Mike Cofer) to Funniest (Matt Millen) to Mr. Nice Guy 
(Jamie Williams), the hands-down winner in the voting for Mr. Uncooperative was 
the hands-up wide receiver, Taylor, who would ignore requests from reporters 
without so much as a grunt, walking right past them. 
</P>
<P>
So, on one side of the 49er offense we have Jerry Rice, the wide receiver who 
complained after winning Super Bowl XXIII most-valuable-player honors that he 
doesn't get the publicity he deserves. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side we have Taylor, who wants publicity about as much as he wants 
a toothache. "If it costs me recognition or money, well, then it's money I 
never saw," Taylor said. "I don't care." 
</P>
<P>
A member of the 49er public relations department asked Taylor to do an 
interview as a personal favor to her. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have just stayed in the locker room until the team picture," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He is a widely popular wide receiver in San Francisco's camp, who is gaining 
fame week by week, like it or not. Taylor just signed a two-year contract worth 
$1.4 million, after having earned $200,000 this season. 
</P>
<P>
It may not be the four-year, $15-million monster deal that Will Clark was 
inking with the San Francisco Giants at virtually the same hour, but it's not 
bad, not bad at all for a guy from Delaware State who never caught a pass in 
high school. 
</P>
<P>
It's also not bad for a guy who, in 1988, drew a 30-day suspension for failing 
a drug test. Taylor reportedly is still considering legal action against the 
league for that suspension. All he will say for the time being is, "You get 
dealt a hand, you play it." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor caught only four touchdown passes in 1988 but all went for 65 yards or 
more. That's his specialty. This season, his 10 touchdown catches included the 
back-breakers of 92 and 95 yards against the Rams on Dec. 11 at Anaheim 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
More and more, people started talking less about just "Jerry Rice" and more 
about "Rice and Taylor." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just getting the ball more," Taylor said, shrugging as though to say 
there's no mystery to it. "There's only so much you can do without the ball." 
</P>
<P>
It was suggested, good-naturedly, that it's as if the 49ers had Jerry Rice 
cloned. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a clone of myself," Taylor said indignantly. "I'm no clone of anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, here's a guy who would rather be anyplace but here. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor prefers the peace and quiet. He and his brother, Keith, spent part of 
their childhood outside Philadelphia playing football in a local cemetery, 
where it was nice and quiet. Besides, Taylor said, it was the only place in the 
neighborhood with grass. 
</P>
<P>
Out of Pennsauken (N.J.) High, Taylor enrolled at a predominantly black 
institute in North Carolina called Johnson C. Smith University, where everyone 
knew him as Jake. 
</P>
<P>
He was getting an education, but he was a long way from getting to a 
seven-figure contract playing pro football. 
</P>
<P>
Transferring to Delaware State, he abandoned baseball and went out for football 
for reasons that were obvious to him. Taylor, a man of few words, put it as 
simply as it could be put: "I figured if I can catch a little ball, I can catch 
one four times the size," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Guess so. He was three-time all-conference, snagged 33 touchdown passes and 
broke four punt returns for scores. 
</P>
<P>
Before long, he was making leaping catches as a 49er and doing the sort of 
broken-field running that separates the big-play receivers from the rest. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor's second catch as a Niner was the last of Joe Montana's record-breaking 
22 completions in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Quietly, he went about his business. He didn't even tell anybody last summer 
that he was dedicating the 1989 season to his mother, Alice, who died on the 
Fourth of July of a brain aneurysm. 
</P>
<P>
Just talking about it now chokes him up. 
</P>
<P>
"I was happy the way I played for my mother," Taylor said. "If the spotlight 
comes my way, fine. If it doesn't, I know inside myself what I've done. It will 
make my mother proud of me, and that's all that really matters." 
</P>
<P>
That says a lot -- about her and about him.

RESERVE ON U.S. TEAM DIES OF RARE DISEASE; 
</P>
<P>
VOLLEYBALL: GLENDALE'S BELLOMO, 23, WAS CALLED A RISING STAR BY HER COACHES. 
SHE PLANNED TO RETURN TO THE NATIONAL TEAM IN ABOUT SIX WEEKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Judy Bellomo, a reserve on the U.S. women's volleyball team, was not the kind 
of person who wanted a fuss. 
</P>
<P>
So, only her Glendale family and a few close friends knew she was to undergo 
surgery Monday for thyroid cancer, an operation that was expected to be 
routine. 
</P>
<P>
Friends say Bellomo, 23, was planning to return to the San Diego-based national 
team in about six weeks. She even practiced on Friday and ran at UCLA on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
But Bellomo died early Tuesday at San Diego's Alvarado Hospital Medical Center, 
four years after Flo Hyman, a star for the U.S. women's team in the early 
1980s, collapsed and died of a rare heart condition while playing in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Bellomo died of a rare genetic disease that caused her body to shut down after 
the surgery, said E. Lee Rice, team physician for USA Volleyball. Her body 
temperature reached almost 108 degrees from complications triggered by the 
anesthetic, Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
The surgery also revealed that Bellomo had widespread cancer from the thyroid 
gland, doctors said. 
</P>
<P>
"But she was basically going in for a routine operation," Rice said. "She was 
in excellent physical condition, except for the cancer. She was a better 
candidate than most to make it through an ordeal like this." 
</P>
<P>
Bellomo, called a rising star by her coaches, had surgery three weeks ago to 
remove two cysts in her neck. Tests indicated that she had malignant cancer, 
leading to Monday's surgery. 
</P>
<P>
But nothing in her medical history, or that of her family, hinted that she had 
the genetic trait that led to her death, according to Rice, who said the 
disease occurs in about one in 100,000, and is difficult to combat once 
triggered. 
</P>
<P>
The suddenness of Bellomo's death was heightened by the anniversary of Hyman's 
tragedy. An autopsy revealed that Hyman -- a 6-foot-5 player from Inglewood -- 
died on Jan. 24, 1986, of Marfan's Syndrome, a congenital disorder of 
connective tissue, usually found in tall people. 
</P>
<P>
Emotions spilled over when tragedy occurred again Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Judy was a special person," U.S. women's Coach Terry Liskevych said in a 
statement. "I've never coached someone with that kind of intensity and desire 
to play. 
</P>
<P>
"She was a fighter and dealt with the situation of her illness unbelievably 
well. From the beginning, she felt that she would beat it." 
</P>
<P>
Said Bellomo's boyfriend, Tim Harris, formerly a UCLA soccer All-American: 
"What distinguishes Judy from a lot of other people, what makes this whole 
experience more of a tragedy is that she wasn't the type of person who was just 
going about life. More than anyone I've ever known, she experienced life. She 
was really attacking it. She left no dreams on the table." 
</P>
<P>
During her last practice Friday, Bellomo was not concerned with the impending 
surgery -- just her performance, friends said. She was highly critical of her 
play although her team did not lose its scrimmages. 
</P>
<P>
Such desire was characteristic of her career, which began at Glendale High, 
where she was a good player but not so distinguished that she immediately 
considered a career in volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
As a junior, she thought about quitting to join the drill team, because she 
wanted to be a song-leader, said Glendale girls' volleyball Coach Ninja 
Jorgesen. 
</P>
<P>
Bellomo, however, continued in volleyball, softball and track and field, and 
also was a varsity cheerleader in her senior year. 
</P>
<P>
She was not among the country's top 300 volleyball recruits in 1984, when she 
decided to attend Nevada Las Vegas. During her two years there, college coaches 
began taking notice of her powerful hitting. 
</P>
<P>
When Las Vegas dropped its women's program, Bellomo, a 5-11 middle blocker, 
transferred to UC Santa Barbara, one of the country's top 10 programs. She 
received first-team All-American honors in her senior season. 
</P>
<P>
"She touched my life more than any girl I've ever coached in 14 years," said 
Kathy Gregory, Santa Barbara's coach. 
</P>
<P>
Bellomo seemed to develop under Gregory, considered one of the best female 
beach volleyball players. "She was just an average player on our team in her 
junior year," Gregory said. "By her senior year, she was one of the best ever 
to play at the school." 
</P>
<P>
Bellomo continued to improve after college, earning rookie-of-the-year honors 
in 1988 while playing for the Minnesota Monarchs of Major League Volleyball. 
She met Harris in Minnesota, where he was playing for the Strikers of the Major 
Indoor Soccer League. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, Bellomo and partner Lisa Strand were among the top 10 
money-winners on the professional beach volleyball tour. She also joined the 
U.S. team last June. 
</P>
<P>
"She would have been the best beach player ever to play," Gregory said. "She 
really had a future on the beach." 
</P>
<P>
But Bellomo wanted to focus on the Olympics, Gregory said, adding: "They loved 
her because she raised the whole level of competitiveness down there (in San 
Diego)." 
</P>
<P>
Harris, who said the couple had planned to marry, said the national team staff 
and players went to the intensive care unit Tuesday night when alerted of the 
complications. Although Bellomo was unconscious, Harris said she could feel the 
support. 
</P>
<P>
"I got to talk to her," he said. "I told her I needed her to fight, to be 
strong. I asked her to blink her eyes if she could hear me. She couldn't, but 
there was a tear. I know she knows I was with her." 
</P>
<P>
Bellomo is survived by her parents, Frank and Paula, and older sister, Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
Funeral arrangements have not been completed.

Former Dodger star Steve Garvey, plagued by low ratings as a radio talk-show 
host in San Diego, was fired by station XTRA after six months. 
</P>
<P>
Garvey, 41, who finished his baseball career with the Padres, was told of his 
dismissal after completing his four-hour drive-time show at 9 a.m., according 
to station employees. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Jimenez, vice president and general manager of XTRA, said the station and 
Garvey had reached a settlement to cover the rest of his contract. Jimenez 
declined to reveal the settlement terms and the length of the original 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
"Steve's attitude was totally professional," Jimenez said. "He understands what 
we're doing here. We're good friends. He was a tremendous help and a pleasure 
to work with. He's a true Hall of Famer in my eyes. He's one of my heroes."

BRUCE, CYPRESS EASILY HANDLE RANCHO SANTIAGO

Alan Bruce of Cypress College made a lot of new friends Wednesday night as he 
helped the Chargers to a 75-60 victory over Rancho Santiago in an Orange Empire 
Conference men's basketball game. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce had six points, a team-high eight rebounds, four steals and two blocked 
shots. Cypress Coach Don Johnson called Bruce, a 6-foot-5 sophomore forward, 
the hero of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"That's quite a compliment coming from a man I respect so much," Bruce said. "I 
don't even know half of these people, but I'm happy they're talking to me. This 
was my dream game." 
</P>
<P>
The contest was billed as a matchup of teams with nearly equal talent. Rancho 
Santiago was ranked second in the state and in Southern Califorina; Cypress was 
the fifth-ranked team in the state and third in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The teams were tied for first place in the conference, but Cypress (20-3 
overall, 6-0 in conference) moved a game ahead in the standings with the 
victory. Rancho Santiago fell to 22-2, 5-1. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress led, 33-30, at the half, then outscored Rancho Santiago, 11-1, in the 
first eight minutes of the second half to take a 44-31 lead. The Dons got as 
close as five, 51-46, with 5:21 left, but Cypress dominated the rest of the 
game from the free throw line. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress' Mike Renaud was nine of 11 from the line in the second half, and six 
of six in the final 50 seconds. Cypress was 27-of-36 in the game. Rancho 
Santiago was 19-of-30. 
</P>
<P>
Andre Lamoureux led Cypress with 15 points, scoring 10 of the points in a row 
in the first half. Vince Hizon had 12 points, Renuad had 11 and Brian Kenny 
added 10. 
</P>
<P>
John Guerrero was the only Rancho Santiago player in double figures with 13. 
Gene Altamirano, who is shooting 57% on three-point attempts this season, made 
only two of seven three-point baskets and was held to nine points. 
</P>
<P>
"They (Rancho Santiago) play hard," Cypress Coach Don Johnson said. "But we 
hung in there. I really don't know what else to say." STEVE KRESAL

<P>
Trailing by 10 points entering the fourth quarter, Estancia High School rallied 
to defeat Corona del Mar, 55-49, in a Sea View League boys' basketball game 
Wednesday night at Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
Augustin Heredia and Matt Fuerbringer each had eight points as the Eagles 
outscored the Sea Kings, 20-4, in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The turnaround came after Corona del Mar's 11-2 run to end the third quarter. 
Estancia's Paul McDaniel fouled Mark Flint and then was called for a technical 
in the final seconds of the quarter. After Flint made three of four free throws 
the Sea Kings led, 45-35. 
</P>
<P>
But Estancia (12-7 overall, 3-2 in the league) went on a run of its own, 
outscoring Corona del Mar, 13-2, to take a 48-47 lead with about two minutes 
remaining. CdM is 13-6, 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
Heredia, the county leader in free throw percentage at 91%, finished with 11 of 
15 free throws and had a game-high 23 points. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Jackson scored 17 for Corona del Mar but was limited to one free throw in 
the fourth quarter. MARTIN BECK

ESPERANZA MANAGES TO HOLD OFF EL DORADO

<TEXT>
<P>
Esperanza High School could never quite accomplish what it seemed bent on doing 
in an Empire League game against El Dorado Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs tried, but failed to blow a 14-point lead, hanging on for a 67-58 
victory at Esperanza. 
</P>
<P>
After leading, 32-18, late in the second quarter, Esperanza let El Dorado come 
within, 34-28, early in the third quarter. Then after the Aztecs built the lead 
to 45-32 with 1:25 left in the third quarter, they watched the Golden Hawks 
trim it to 59-58 with 1:18 left to play. 
</P>
<P>
But Esperanza made six of eight free throws in the final minute to pull out the 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the character of this team," Esperanza Coach Mark Hill said. "Last 
year, they would have fallen apart. We've been able to bounce back this year." 
</P>
<P>
For Esperanza (13-9 overall, 5-1 in league), Seth Romans scored a game-high 20 
points, Walter Forcatto had 19 and Joe Foss added 16. 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza's collapsing, two-three zone held El Dorado's Jerome Facione to 13 
points, six below his average. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Bradach had 19 points, 13 in the second half, to lead El Dorado (11-9, 
2-4). ELLIOTT TEAFORD

MISSION VIEJO USES PRESS TO DEFEAT DANA HILLS, 66-47

<P>
By switching defenses, Mission Viejo High rallied for a 66-47 victory over Dana 
Hills in a South Coast League boys' basketball game Wednesday at Dana Hills 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried the half-court trap in the first quarter, but we couldn't score," 
Mission Viejo coach Bob Minier said. 
</P>
<P>
"We changed our defense to a full-court press and our steals got Dana Hills out 
of rhythm. They just didn't handle the pressure well." 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo outscored Dana Hills, 29-10, in the second quarter. Against the 
full-court press, Dana Hills could only make one of four field goals and eight 
of nine free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Hills Coach Tom Riach said the game was "one of our worst efforts." 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't handle their press well and we knew Mission Viejo would press," 
Riach said. "It was no surprise. After the first quarter we fell apart, got 
lethargic and stood around and watched." 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo boosted its record to 15-5 overall, 5-1 in the league and remains 
in first place. Dana Hills fell to 14-7, 2-4. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Cramer, with two three-point baskets, led Mission Viejo with 16 points. 
J.B. Taylor led Dana Hills' effort with two three-point baskets and 13 points.

MAGAZINES: UTNE TAKES THE ANGST OUT OF AGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SIPCHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The generation's anthem was "Hope I die before I get old." So it only figures 
that baby boomers have not hit middle age gracefully. Luckily, the 
January-February Utne Reader has arrived to chronicle the thirty- and 
fortysomething generation's painful moment of reckoning with a package of 13 
articles and accompanying pieces, titled: "What's to Worry About Growing Older 
-- and what's so great about being young?" 
</P>
<P>
Writer Joan Frank summarizes the problem: "Despite the number of boomers 
statistically sharing the event, hitting 40 remains a bewilderingly isolating 
feeling in a ruthlessly youthful culture." 
</P>
<P>
A Reader's Digest for those who reached adolescence in the '60s and '70s, the 
Utne Reader does a good job of pulling together ideas on the subject, making 
growing old seem like a communal activity. Drawing from the alternative press, 
books and original articles, the magazine actually finds cause for optimism in 
the fact that the nation's largest demographic blip is at least halfway to 
being dead. 
</P>
<P>
The lead article, an excerpt from Mark Gerzon's book, "The Mid-Life Quest," 
makes a compelling case for confronting aging head-on. Gerzon's reflective, 
first-person analysis eventually bogs down in reheated psychobabble and fuzzy 
science. But along the way, he offers clear-headed insight: "We turn mid-life 
into a 'mid-life crisis' by pretending that everything is supposed to stay the 
same. But it isn't." 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, Laurence Shames, in an article reprinted from the excellent New York 
weekly, "7 Days," argues that as the baby boom generation matures and grows 
disenchanted with the culture it inhabits, it will again transform that 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
In economic terms, Shames writes, boomers are "facing the daunting prospect of 
peaking at the same moment the country is." But rather than simply resigning 
themselves to relative failure, they will change the definition of success, he 
believes. "One of the most quietly insidious things that has happened since 
last week when we were 30, is that the whole notion of 'success' has been 
deformed, denatured, drained of meaning." 
</P>
<P>
Fine. Swell. Except it seems to have been the boomers who Shames represents who 
did the deforming, whining all the while that the good life to which they feel 
entitled has been slow in arriving. About the second time Shames poses the 
rhetorical question, "Am I complaining?" readers will want to shout: "No! 
You're sniveling!" 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Shames intimates of his generation: "If we've learned anything, 
it's that most things aren't worth getting tired over." His friends never go 
dancing any more, he confides. 
</P>
<P>
But Shames and other ennui-addled middle-agers might be well advised to listen 
to what author Ashley Montagu has to say a few pages later on: "Most adults 
draw back from the unfamiliar, perhaps because they are reluctant to reveal 
ignorance, perhaps because they have become genuinely indifferent to the 
interesting experiences of life and consider that absorbing something new is 
simply too much trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Montagu's antidote to this "psychosclerosis," or "hardening of the mind," is 
for adults to behave more like kids -- to relearn the spontaneity, humor, 
honesty, and natural curiosity of childhood. Those who do, he writes, find that 
their later years are the happiest of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
This juxtaposition of viewpoints is the Utne Reader's greatest strength. When 
these packages work -- as this one does -- readers feel as if they've sat in on 
a rousing, late-night conversation between a group of informed, if somewhat 
unorthodox and cantankerous friends. 
</P>
<P>
Oddly, Utne's aging package makes no mention of what many boomers are finding a 
very significant -- and annoyingly public -- aspect of growing up: having kids. 
That matter is engagingly addressed, however, in three separate articles in the 
same issue. 
</P>
<P>
Taking a feminist approach, the magazine concludes only that this parenthood 
business is problematic. As author Susan Shapiro summarizes, "As feminists we 
have a problem that's not going to go away until we face it: the tension 
between women whose motherhood choices differ." 
</P>
<P>
The articles suggest sound reasons for women to have or not have kids. But the 
underlying message seems to be that procreation is politically uncool -- a 
notion that seems to underlie what some observers see as the political Left's 
subtle anti-family bias. 
</P>
<P>
Without making the point directly, the arguments also point to a connection 
between the anti-family bias of middle-age hipsters and baby boom narcissism. 
Notice, for instance, the telling use of the generation's most important word 
-- me -- in this excerpt from a generally well-wrought piece by Roberta Joseph 
called "Deciding Against Motherhood: One Woman's Story." 
</P>
<P>
"There are times when I feel painfully alienated from even my dearest friends, 
who now as parents inhabit a world I do not want to share. . . . They get up 
early and go to bed early, and of necessity have less time for me (emphasis 
added)." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Lighter Side of Business Analysis 
</P>
<P>
The January-February Harvard Business Review devotes 214 pages to serious 
analysis of the current business climate. But the two pages it gives to a 
less-than-serious look at magazines for the 1990s may be the most sobering 
analysis of all -- at least if you take this sort of humor seriously. Among the 
publications listed: Barren, Misfortune, BusinessWeak, Divestor's Daily, 
Working Child, and The Wall Street Shimbun. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
RIZA Falls Short of Its Ambitions 
</P>
<P>
The premiere issue of Pacific Rim RIZA -- Reportage on Influence, Zest and 
Affluence -- is on the stands, and unfortunately, seems destined to stay there. 
This ambitious bimonthly has tapped into what may become a good market niche, 
what with everyone Ping-Ponging from Asia to California and back. 
</P>
<P>
But the magazine's initial effort suggests that the editors have staked out 
much more turf than they know what to do with. The articles on actor Lou 
Diamond Phillips, Philippine leaders in exile, and other topics relevant to the 
Pacific Rim are passable, but predictable. 
</P>
<P>
Readers can get an idea of how the copy reads by checking out the photo 
credits, which include such unbiased contributors as the Korean National 
Tourism Corp., Hong Kong Tourist Assn., Singapore Tourist Promotion Board, 
Warner Bros. and American Honda Motor Co.

OFFBEAT MEMORIAL FOR A COMEDIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL HIGGINS

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even in death, Monty Python's Graham Chapman was in "for something completely 
different." 
</P>
<P>
The actor-comedian, who died in October of cancer, was the recipient of a 
belated memorial service/media event/cocktail party at the St. James' Club 
Tuesday night that was, in the words of one British guest, "neither here nor 
there -- I can't quite say what it was." 
</P>
<P>
It was cracked up to be a chance for Chapman's Hollywood friends to "raise a 
glass to a departed friend" in the words of Timothy Leary, and perhaps make a 
donation to Chapman's favorite charity, the Kent Leukemia &amp; Cancer Fund 
(envelopes for the charity were handed out with invitations). But most of those 
raising glasses appeared to be the regular suspects on the local PR schmooze 
circuit plus assorted paparazzi and film crews. 
</P>
<P>
Not that there weren't any Chapman friends in attendance -- David Sherlock, 
Chapman's lover for 23 years, was on hand to give a heartfelt 10-minute 
tribute, and songwriter Harry Nilsson knew the comedian "in the old days, when 
we used to drink together," said Nilsson, who now sips on Coca-Cola. 
</P>
<P>
In those days, Chapman's feats of alcoholic excess were legendary. He was 
notorious for drunkenly crawling along the floor and biting his prey on the 
ankles. 
</P>
<P>
"They deserved it," said Nilsson. "He loved to bust pomposity; he hated stuffed 
shirts." 
</P>
<P>
"He was irreverent and revolutionary," said Leary. "Graham helped bring down 
the Berlin Wall. Someone has to get the credit." 
</P>
<P>
Chapman would be pleased to know there was little pomposity at his memorial, 
which was hosted by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts L.A. 
chapter. However, the ankles on such guests as Ed Asner, Elliott Gould, 
songwriter Thomas Dolby, and SCTV veterans Catherine O'Hara and Dave Thomas 
went unbitten.

YOUR COLLECTIBLES: MINIATURE BEER BOTTLES HAVE VALUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD L. SOBLE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I have several dozen different miniature beer bottles. When were 
these bottles distributed by breweries, and do they have much value? -- T.T. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Beer bottle miniatures became popular advertising items for the 
breweries in the years just before Prohibition and probably were reproduced 
through the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
The replicas were popular advertising items with such breweries as Budweiser, 
Miller, Pabst and Schlitz. Some smaller breweries also distributed the 
miniatures; if these are in good condition, they appear to command somewhat 
higher prices than the nationally advertised brands. 
</P>
<P>
Prices seem to range from just a few dollars a miniature to about $30 for 
harder-to-find bottles, according to catalogues. 
</P>
<P>
About 400 miniature beer bottles -- ranging in height from 3 inches to just 
over 4 inches -- have been identified by collectors and dealers. 
</P>
<P>
One use for these miniatures is to convert them to salt and pepper shakers. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have tickets to the Dempsey-Gibbons fight. When was it? -- S.P. 
</P>
<P>
A: The Jack Dempsey-Tom Gibbons world heavyweight championship fight was held 
in Shelby, Mont., on July 4, 1923. Dempsey won in 15 rounds.

Larry Byrd of Los Angeles writes: "Here's an offbeat collectible for you: 
Pirates! I have been searching for, and occasionally finding, pirate-oriented 
items for about six years. They aren't very easy to find, though many such 
items have been made over the years (particularly in the 1920s and 1930s). 
</P>
<P>
"I've found lots of children's items: toys, games, banks and the like. I've 
found Deco-style bookends, statuary and, most precious, books." 
</P>
<P>
Byrd says he's formed a club for collectors of pirate-related items called 
Brethren of the Coast, which, he says, is what pirates called themselves. 
</P>
<P>
For $18, he says, readers will receive a membership certificate, a subscription 
to the Jolly Roger magazine, and a subscription to a newsletter, Night Watch, 
plus unlimited free buy-and-sell advertising in the newsletter. 
</P>

David S. Pedrick of La Mesa writes that his teen-age niece has a fixation with 
frog collectibles. 
</P>
<P>
"My niece, who is 17, has been collecting frog bric-a-brac and stuffed frogs 
for years. Proof of her infatuation is her license plate: FROG N IT. 
</P>
<P>
"Is there a club I could enlist her in? Our family is constantly on the lookout 
for gifts and such, but it's getting challenging. Some amusing and beautiful 
frog items have been collected, probably close to 1,000 pieces." 
</P>
<P>
Collectors of frog items should write him at Box 761, La Mesa, Calif. 92041. 
</P>
<P>
(In a catalogue, we noticed a number of frog collectibles ranging from candy 
molds to toys. Prices ranged from a $4 Christmas tree ornament to $225 for a 
mechanical frog bank.) 
</P>

W.B. Thurston of Avila Beach says he's interested in starting a collection of 
old road maps published by gasoline companies and auto clubs. He can be reached 
at P.O. Box 2217, Avila Beach, Calif. 93424.

ANN CONWAY: LOVE? IT'S MUSIC TO MARK HARMON'S EARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN CONWAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
She loves him. No doubt about it. You could see it in her eyes when she asked 
him: "Would you like me to get you something to eat?" You could see it in her 
smile, the one she kept flashing at him through the exploding flashbulbs, the 
interviews, the handshakes with fellow cast members. 
</P>
<P>
But then, love was the theme when Pam Dawber and her husband, actor Mark 
Harmon, swept into Birraporetti's restaurant on Tuesday, after her 
opening-night performance in "She Loves Me" at the Orange County Performing 
Arts Center in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
In the endearing musical, a lovelorn Dawber meets her beau (Joel Higgins) at 
work. He turns out to be the shop clerk with whom she has been unwittingly 
exchanging love letters. 
</P>
<P>
How did Dawber and her heartthrob-husband meet? "We were fixed up," said the 
actress, dressed in gold slippers and a white chiffon dress sprinkled with gold 
polka dots. "Fixed up by a friend who thought we might hit it off. We did." 
</P>
<P>
Dawber gave straight A's to Segerstrom Hall. "It's beautiful, huge, wonderful," 
she said. "But I was so nervous! The costume changes are tricky and during 
rehearsal today, I missed one of them. So I was praying I wouldn't miss it 
tonight. I didn't. And during the second act, I relaxed." 
</P>
<P>
Harmon, sporting a tan he earned while filming "Till There Was You" in New 
Guinea and Australia, said he loved watching his wife on stage. In fact, the 
first time he saw her in person was when she did "Pirates of Penzance" in Los 
Angeles in the early '80s. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd seen her in 'Mork and Mindy' on television, and then I went to 'Pirates' 
and out walks this wonderful singing talent. I said to myself: 'I didn't know 
Mindy could do that!' " 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Performing Arts Fraternity, a support group of the Center, were 
party hosts. Among guests was the group's president, Reed Royalty, a vice 
president of Pacific Bell. 
</P>
<P>
Horsing around: Reggie would have adored it. The American Horse Shows Assn., 
founded by high-society sportsman Reginald Vanderbilt in 1917, staged a 
highfalutin' hoedown at Joan Irvine Smith's ranch on Friday, attracting about 
400 of the horsey set. Smith was honorary chairwoman of the event, held in a 
huge heated tent on her oak-studded property. 
</P>
<P>
Up for dancing were the down-home sounds of Michael Carney's Denny Leroux Band 
(the musicians, adored by society types all over the country, were flown in 
from New York for the affair). And up for vittles: a chicken 'n' rib barbecue 
that had guests lickin' their fingers and going back for fourths. Also among 
the fare cooked up by Rococo were do-your-own tacos and tostadas and a table 
for whipping up your own ice-cream sundaes. 
</P>
<P>
Chairwoman Judy Fluor Runels dressed to kill for the shebang. She wore a 
magenta suede jacket with boots dyed to match. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Manhattan-based association staged its annual convention at the 
Westin South Coast Plaza last week, equestrians from all over the country were 
able to attend. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all show horses and want to support the association," said Runels, who 
lives in Santa Ana with her husband Dick, an attorney. "It's an honor for us to 
honor them. It's a coup for Orange County to have them here." 
</P>
<P>
"Southern California is bustling with equestrians," said Liz Hoskinson, who 
does public relations for the association. "And Orange County has the perfect 
life style mix: one minute you can be shopping, and the next riding a horse. 
Perfect!" 
</P>
<P>
Gilot on Cocteau: Her French accent was delicious and so were the memories of 
Jean Cocteau shared by Francoise Gilot at the Severin Wunderman Museum in 
Irvine on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
During a one-hour lecture, Gilot -- the artist who was Pablo Picasso's 
companion for 10 years -- recalled the first time she met Cocteau, the French 
poet, novelist and playwright: "He came to Pablo's studio in a hurry because he 
needed a scepter for one of his plays," said Gilot, her soft hazel eyes 
widening in recollection. It was thrilling to see Picasso take a stick and make 
something majestic out of it, she said. 
</P>
<P>
As her friendship with Picasso soured, her friendship with Cocteau sweetened, 
and they began to write each other. This disturbed Picasso. He was jealous of 
Cocteau's fine looks and personality, Gilot said. "Pablo was a first-class 
taker, and Cocteau was a first-class giver." Cocteau remained Gilot's close 
friend until his death in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
"If I were to sum up Cocteau in one sentence," said Gilot, the wife of Dr. 
Jonas Salk, "I would say he was a messenger of Mercury -- with Mercury's wings 
at his heels; he heralded every new era by putting people together to create 
new magic." 
</P>
<P>
Gilot, who lives in La Jolla, delighted guests with such bon mots as: "The 
French all dislike each other because they think they all have talent," and, 
"Here (in the United States), there are so many people, nobody needs to take 
the time to be mean to anyone." 
</P>
<P>
During a champagne reception, Gilot signed autographs of her book, "An Artist's 
Journey." 
</P>
<P>
"She is so relaxed and casual," observed one guest, who thought the mother of 
avant-garde jewelry designer Paloma Picasso would strut into the museum 
"looking very French and drenched with jewelry." 
</P>
<P>
She looked French, all right. She wore the classic French accessory, a scarf, 
over her smart wool pants suit. And she wore her hair pixie-like, in the style 
of an apache dancer. But her jewelry was on the conservative side. She wore no 
earrings, just a cluster of simple beaded necklaces, a wedding ring and a 
pinkie ring set with a pale green stone. 
</P>
<P>
Museum owner Severin Wunderman, who manufactures Gucci timepieces worldwide, 
planned to take Gilot to dinner after the lecture. But the night before, he 
learned that his good friend and mentor, Aldo Gucci, had died in Rome. So 
Wunderman left immediately after Gilot's lecture to fly to the funeral of the 
Gucci family patriarch. 
</P>
<P>
For Claire: She may have won an Academy Award for her role in "Key Largo," and 
she may be the stepmum of Irvine Co. mogul Donald Bren, but lovely Claire 
Trevor "just wants to be one of the girls," said good friend Maria Crutcher. 
</P>
<P>
So Friday, at the Ritz in Newport Beach, one of "the girls" -- good pal Norma 
Meyer -- tossed a dinner party for Trevor, who is visiting from New York. 
</P>
<P>
And on Saturday at Big Canyon Country Club, Meyer and Crutcher staged a 
luncheon attended by several of Trevor's friends, with Marion Knott Montapert, 
June Wian, Patricia Groth, Shirlee Guggenheim and Mary Lou Hornsby among 
guests. 
</P>
<P>
"When Claire lived in Newport Beach, my late husband, Richard, and I, used to 
play bridge with Claire and her husband, Milton," Crutcher said. Milton Bren, 
the late motion picture producer, was Donald Bren's father. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Crutcher was a prominent Orange County banker. "Richard and Milton had 
great rapport," Crutcher said. And so do "the girls." You should have heard the 
giggles.

FAX CUT: Will serve-yourself fax machines in post offices around Orange County 
(D11) touch off a local price war? The Postal Service is planning to charge 
$8.50 to send six pages. . . . Sending the same pages via storefront facsimile 
services costs an average of $16. . . . But local fax managers don't fear the 
competition. "Faxing is all about convenience," said one, "and post offices are 
not always the handiest places in the world." Pinsky and Steve Emmons

ROTHENBERG OUT ON PAROLE AND TIGHT LEASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY WRIDE and TONY MARCANO, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charles David Rothenberg was released from prison Wednesday under the tightest 
parole measures in California history -- nearly seven years after he burned his 
son beyond recognition in a twisted plot to hurt the wife who divorced him. 
</P>
<P>
At 12:40 a.m., Rothenberg was driven from an undisclosed California prison 
under guard by six parole agents, who delivered him to an unnamed parole 
destination sometime before 9 a.m., officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in blue jeans and chambray shirt and toting two boxes of personal 
belongings, a prison spokesman said, Rothenberg's only remark upon release was, 
"I'm afraid and upset." 
</P>
<P>
To prevent him from getting anywhere near his son -- and to calm public 
indignation about his release -- Rothenberg will wear an electronic "leash" and 
have three parole agents who live with him, rotating in daily shifts. 
</P>
<P>
David Rothenberg, sitting atop a phone book to reach all the microphones, told 
a throng of 50 reporters and photographers at an afternoon press conference 
that he is less afraid now of his father's release. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel more comfortable because now I know . . . what kind of parole he's 
going to be put on," said David, 13, who agreed to discuss his father's parole 
at the Buena Park police station, where his stepfather works. "I think I'm in 
good hands." 
</P>
<P>
Although Rothenberg has expressed regret for what he did, David said he doesn't 
believe it. 
</P>
<P>
"He just says stuff. He says he's sorry. He's just saying that so he can try to 
get near me again." He added firmly, "That's not going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
David said he held the press conference "because I want it known nationally 
that I don't want to ever see my father again. And I want to make it clear to 
him." 
</P>
<P>
While authorities have refused to identify where Rothenberg was sent Wednesday 
for fear such a disclosure would result in repeated and costly relocations, 
they said he has a clerical job in private enterprise that will "at least pay 
for his room and board." 
</P>
<P>
Tipton C. Kindel, spokesman for the state Department of Corrections, said 
Rothenberg's living quarters "are essentially some type of an apartment 
setting." 
</P>
<P>
Rothenberg, 49, pleaded guilty to attempted murder, arson and other charges 
stemming from the March 3, 1983, fire in a Buena Park motel room that 
permanently disfigured his son. He was sentenced to 13 years, the maximum 
penalty allowed by state law that has since been toughened. Were he sentenced 
today, he could be sent to prison for life. 
</P>
<P>
State law allows prisoners a day off their sentence for each day they work or 
participate in an education program. Rothenberg held a clerical job in the 
Soledad state prison's public information office and had worked since last fall 
as a groundskeeper at the California Men's Colony in San Luis Obispo. His 
sentence was effectively cut in half. 
</P>
<P>
He twice violated prison rules by arranging for hand delivery of letters to his 
son's stepfather instead of using the mails, offenses which increased his time 
in prison by several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Public outrage over Rothenberg's pending release forced corrections officials 
to keep his parole destination a secret. Members of a family which two years 
ago offered to help Rothenberg upon his release now say they have received 
death threats. Another inmate at the California Men's Colony, enraged at what 
Rothenberg did to his son, punched him in the face Jan. 10. And since a 
Riverside County hamlet rejected his parole there last year, authorities have 
feared a repeat of the Lawrence Singleton debacle. 
</P>
<P>
In that case, the man convicted of raping a teen-age girl and axing off her 
forearms was driven out of several Northern California communities by citizens 
outraged at his prison release. After repeated relocations that cost the state 
$2 million, he finally served out his parole in a trailer at San Quentin. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, it will cost $648,000 over the next three years -- until his 
parole expires -- to monitor Rothenberg, compared to the $2,900 annual cost to 
keep tabs on a less notorious parolee. Kindel said the $18,000 monthly expense 
to keep Rothenberg will go largely toward paying the salaries and benefits of 
the three full-time parole agents who will watch Rothenberg 24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
Kindel added that authorities "may re-evaluate" at a later date the need to 
continue such an extensive watch on Rothenberg. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what kind of employer would tolerate a parole agent accompanying 
Rothenberg to work every day, Kindel said, "A very cooperative one." 
</P>
<P>
As Rothenberg's release approached, media coverage became so extensive that 
prison officials worried someone might spot him leaving the Men's Colony and 
follow him to his parole destination. In an effort to avoid that, corrections 
officials moved Rothenberg Sunday afternoon to one of California's other 18 
prisons, and secreted him from that prison in darkness Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Although technically free, Rothenberg, a former New York waiter who also has 
run a Laundromat, will be under the tightest parole restrictions of any 
released prisoner in the state, Kindel said. Singleton also lived with parole 
agents and other parolees have worn the cigarette pack-size transmitters. But 
no other inmate has been subject to both, Kindel said. 
</P>
<P>
If Rothenberg removes the transmitter he wil have violated his parole, and that 
could return him to prison. 
</P>
<P>
The son he nearly killed and the ex-wife he was trying to hurt will not be told 
where Rothenberg is living, only that it is not in Southern California. 
Rothenberg's parole restrictions also forbid him from any contact with David 
Rothenberg and Marie Hafdahl, who married Buena Park Police Lt. Richard Hafdahl 
in May, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Gray-haired and 40 pounds lighter than he appears in 2-year-old newspaper 
photos, Rothenberg has repeatedly insisted he would never again hurt his son, 
nor would he bother him or the boy's mother, who was the indirect target that 
spring night in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Rothenberg told his ex-wife he was taking their son from the mother's New York 
home to the Catskills for a week but brought him instead to Buena Park, where 
they checked into a Travelodge and planned to visit Disneyland and Knott's 
Berry Farm. It rained the whole week and Rothenberg called Marie requesting 
more time with their son. But he accidentally revealed they were in California, 
and in a phone call both parents say triggered the tragedy, she told him he 
would never see his son again once they returned to New York. 
</P>
<P>
That day, father and son went to a hardware store, where Rothenberg paid $8.47 
for a 2 1/2-gallon jug of kerosene. In the minutes before midnight March 3, he 
poured the flammable liquid around the bed where his son lay sleeping, then lit 
a match and fled. He was arrested a week later in San Francisco, and confessed 
he had tried to kill his son in a jealous rage because, "if I couldn't have 
him, nobody could." 
</P>
<P>
It was not David Rothenberg's first brush with arson. In November, 1981, the 
two-story Brooklyn brownstone where Marie and David lived was deliberately set 
ablaze, John Mulligan, spokesman for the New York City fire marshal's office, 
said in an interview after the boy was burned. 
</P>
<P>
Someone had poured kerosene up the stairwell leading to their apartment and 
ignited it, and mother and son fled down the fire escape. No arrest was ever 
made, and Rothenberg denied any hand in that fire during a 1988 prison 
interview with The Times. 
</P>
<P>
He now professes undying love for the son he has not touched since the night he 
kissed him goodby, then torched him. He has said in numerous letters to The 
Times that he will never forgive himself for permanently disfiguring David. But 
he also says that meeting with his son to "ask his forgiveness" is his only 
reason for living. 
</P>
<P>
That troubles David. And while he told reporters Wednesday that he feels safer 
than he did before, he has learned self-defense, all the best ways out of his 
Orange County home and how to fire the B.B. gun he got for Christmas, should he 
need to protect himself. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he is concerned about what happens when his father is truly free in 
three years, David said: "I know that he'll try (to see me). I won't answer the 
door or anything. If it seems he's gonna hurt me I'll do something for 
protection. We've taken out some precautions." 
</P>
<P>
His wish to put what his father did behind him is so great that he almost 
always refers to him as Charles. But getting over it all, he said, may only 
come "when Charles dies." 
</P>
<P>
DREADED DAY -- David Rothenberg says it loud and clear: He never wants to see 
his father again. A29 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CHARLES ROTHENBERG: ARREST TO PAROLE 
</P>
<P>
Feb. 21, 1983 -- Charles David Rothenberg, 42, picks up his son, David 
Rothenberg, 6, from the Brooklyn, N.Y., home of his estranged wife, Marie, 
telling her that he would bring the boy home on Feb. 27. 
</P>
<P>
Feb. 28 -- Rothenberg phones his ex-wife from Buena Park, assuring her that 
David is safe. Marie Rothenberg reports her son missing to New York City 
police, who are already seeking Rothenberg in the vandalism-burglary of a 
Manhattan restaurant where he had been employed as a waiter. 
</P>
<P>
March 2 -- Rothenberg checks into a Travelodge motel on Beach Boulevard in 
Buena Park, telling the desk clerk he planned to take his son to Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
March 3 -- Shortly after midnight, Room 139 explodes into flames. David is 
found on the melting carpet, third-degree burns over 90% of his body, the 
victim of a kerosene-fueled blaze. A man fitting Rothenberg's description is 
seen fleeing, carrying a fuel can. 
</P>
<P>
March 9 -- After a weeklong nationwide search, Rothenberg is arrested outside a 
YMCA in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
March 13 -- Rothenberg admits to police and reporters that he set fire to his 
son because he feared his ex-wife would prevent him from seeing the boy again. 
"I decided to kill us both. If I couldn't have him, nobody could," he tells The 
Times in a jailhouse interview. 
</P>
<P>
March 21 -- Rothenberg is arraigned in Municipal Court in Fullerton. He pleads 
not guilty to charges of arson, attempted murder, inflicting great bodily 
injury and the use of a deadly weapon -- the kerosene used to start the fire. 
</P>
<P>
June 24 -- Appearing in Orange County Superior Court, Rothenberg reverses his 
plea. "To not plead guilty would be dishonest," he tells Superior Court Judge 
James R. Franks II. 
</P>
<P>
July 29 -- Judge Franks sentences Rothenberg to 13 years in prison -- the 
maximum penalty under the law -- for attempted murder and arson. "That is not 
enough for what you did," Franks tells Rothenberg. 
</P>
<P>
July 9, 1984 -- Marie Rothenberg and David move from Brooklyn to Orange County. 
She later weds Buena Park Police Lt. Richard Hafdahl, one of the first 
investigators assigned to track down her ex-husband. 
</P>
<P>
Nov. 3, 1989 -- Corrections officials postpone Rothenberg's scheduled parole 
date from Dec. 11 to Jan. 9, 1990, after he violates rules by having letters 
personally delivered to his son's stepfather instead of mailing them. The 
release date is further delayed until Jan. 24 for repeating the violation. 
</P>
<P>
Nov. 8 -- Residents of Desert Center, a Riverside County village about 25 miles 
from the Eagle Mountain Return to Custody Center, angrily reject corrections 
officials' plans to relocate Rothenberg there after his parole. 
</P>
<P>
Jan. 19, 1990 -- Corrections officials announce that Rothenberg's parole will 
be the most restrictive in state history, with round-the-clock surveillance, a 
live-in parole officer and an electronic locater device strapped to his ankle. 
</P>
<P>
Jan. 24 -- Rothenberg is released shortly after midnight from an undisclosed 
state corrections facility after being moved from one at San Luis Obispo. His 
destination remains secret. Hours later, at a Buena Park press conference, his 
son reiterates his fears that Rothenberg will try to contact him.

WATER: FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 50 YEARS, WELLS ARE ALL BUT DRY IN THE SAN JUAN

SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fred Voorhees remembers the winter five years ago when rains swelled San Juan 
Creek and gave local kids a place to catch bass and channel catfish. 
</P>
<P>
The cattle he raised on the sprawling Rancho Mission Viejo near here grazed on 
the rolling hills that rise above Ortega Highway. 
</P>
<P>
But today, the creek is a dust bowl of dead willows and cattails. And the 
cattle have been moved to greener pastures. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen it so bad," said Voorhees, a foreman at the ranch just east of 
San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
The continuing Southern California drought has taken a toll on farmers, nursery 
owners and ranchers in the 110,000-acre San Juan Creek basin, officials say. 
For the first time in 50 years, the 14 agricultural wells that feed the region 
have run dry. And unless there is substantial rainfall soon, the dozen or so 
tenant farmers and nursery operators who till the surrounding fields may be 
forced out of business by summer. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the worst it's ever been," Voorhees continued, standing Wednesday in 
the dry creek bed as warm Santa Ana winds blew dust around his boots. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see how we are going to have enough water to keep all the tenants in 
business," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Shigeru Kinoshita, a veteran of 35 years of farming who runs a vegetable and 
strawberry farm eight miles downstream from Rancho Mission Viejo, agreed. He 
said the beautiful Southern California weather, which is so welcomed by the 
tourist industry, could be the demise of local agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had too many Santa Ana wind conditions and high pressure systems, which 
are really unusual this time of year," Kinoshita said. He predicted that if the 
area does not get 75% of the normal seasonal rainfall by the end of the month, 
"we'll be in a lot of trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Local water officials said that the drought has virtually depleted much of the 
113,000-acre aquifer that stretches under San Juan Creek from Cleveland 
National Forest west to the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
The wells tap into the aquifer, a layer of underground, porous rock and sand 
that holds water, at various locations along an eight-mile stretch of land. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the depletion, farmers and nursery owners have had to rely on 
imported water piped from nearby water agencies, according to William W. Knitz, 
general manager of the Santa Margarita Water District. 
</P>
<P>
"This really shows you that we are in a drought," said Knitz, who is also 
president of the San Juan Basin Authority board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
Six months ago, the ranch all but abandoned the wells after spending close to 
$500,000 to hook up a seven-mile-long pipeline to the Santa Margarita Water 
District and a shorter line to the nearby Chiquita Canyon sewage-treatment 
plant, Knitz said. 
</P>
<P>
That imported water so far has replaced the wells, which once provided free 
water to the tenant farmers. 
</P>
<P>
Now the ranch and the farmers pay $350 per acre-foot for the imported water. 
(An acre-foot equals 326,000 gallons, which is enough to supply a family of 
four with drinking water for a year.) 
</P>
<P>
"That is pretty expensive for water," Voorhees said. "You never know how 
valuable water is until the wells run dry." 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert Aguirre, vice president of ranch operations, said that the imported 
water so far has been enough to forestall most negative effects of the drought. 
</P>
<P>
But as summer approaches and the overall demand for water increases, Voorhees 
warned, the two utilities may not be able to supply enough water to keep the 
farm tenants in business. 
</P>
<P>
The water table has now dipped to 50 feet underground, the lowest it has ever 
been in recorded history, water officials said. In seasons with normal or 
near-normal rainfall, the underground water level is between 20 to 30 feet from 
the surface. 
</P>
<P>
Last week's series of winter storms, which dumped more than two inches of rain 
in San Juan Capistrano, have done almost nothing to counter the effects of the 
drought in the basin. 
</P>
<P>
"We would need at least 15 to 17 inches of rain per year over the next two 
years to get the wells back to an operational level," Knitz explained. "I don't 
think much of the rain water got into the ground water basin." 
</P>
<P>
Supporting his statement is the fact that the hillside grasses remain unusually 
brown and the creek bed is still parched. 
</P>
<P>
Voorhees said that the drought has also affected the Rancho Mission Viejo's 
Reata Cattle Co. operation. The company normally raises 800 head of cattle a 
year. But because the hills are so barren, about 600 head were moved to the 
company's spread near Elko, Nev., to avoid starvation. 
</P>
<P>
Other local farmers share the bleak predictions for the agricultural industry 
if the region does not receive substantial rainfall by April. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Bathgate, a lifelong San Juan Capistrano orange grower, said that the 
drought is affecting water quality throughout the Capistrano Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of rainfall, he explained, has caused natural salt in the soil to 
accumulate near the surface rather than be leeched deeper by rain. 
</P>
<P>
"Plants don't like salty water," Bathgate said. 
</P>
<P>
He also said that it costs more money to pump water out of nearly empty wells. 
</P>
<P>
"Not only does it take more power," Bathgate said, "but the efficiency of the 
pump is decreased and you get less water." 
</P>
<P>
T. J. Meadows, general manager of the San Juan Basin Authority, said that the 
agency has been studying a plan to build two dams on San Juan Creek to keep up 
to 60% of runoff water from flowing into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
The dams would provide more than six billion gallons of agricultural and 
drinking water, Meadows said. 
</P>
<P>
"This would really give us a chance to have a major water source that is not 
dependent on what naturally falls into the system" Knitz added. 
</P>
<P>
The authority, which oversees ground water use in the water table under San 
Juan Creek and its two tributaries, Oso and Trabuco creeks, is seeking a 
$42-million federal grant from the Bureau of Water Reclamation. 
</P>
<P>
Early versions of the proposal called for a 90-foot-high dam in a canyon near 
Ronald W. Caspers Wilderness Park, seven miles east of San Juan Capistrano on 
Ortega Highway. 
</P>
<P>
Water officials have estimated that in a normal rainy season, water lost to the 
ocean could serve 18,000 families of four for a year. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Voorhees said, he is counting the days when he will once again 
see water flowing in the creek. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been four years now since any water flowed at all," Voorhees said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dust Bowl 
</P>
<P>
The San Juan Creek Basin has lost almost all of its ground water due to the 
ongoing drought that has stricken Southern California. The creek once swelled 
during rainy seasons but has now been dry for four years.

6 NEW JUDGES APPOINTED IN ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
Restoring the Orange County Superior Court to full strength, Gov. George 
Deukmejian on Wednesday announced the appointment of two new judges, one of 
them the No. 2 prosecutor in the U.S. attorney's office in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Wieben Stock, 38, a seasoned trial court lawyer based in the U.S. 
attorney's office in Orange County, and Francisco F. Firmat, 39, a North Orange 
County Municipal Court judge, were named to the Superior Court bench, filling 
two vacancies created by retirements last year. Wieben Stock and Firmat may be 
sworn into office as early as Friday, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The governor's office also announced the appointment of four new Orange County 
Municipal Court judges: bank attorney David T. McEachen, 47, of Los Alamitos; 
Municipal Court commissioner Richard E. Behn, 49, of Santa Ana; former Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Anthony J. Rackauckas, 46, of Anaheim and private insurance 
attorney Stephen J. Sundvold, 42, of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Rackauckas is the best-known of the four, having championed local efforts to 
help the statewide campaign to unseat former California Chief Justice Rose 
Elizabeth Bird, who was turned out of office by voters in 1986. Rackauckas left 
the district attorney's office in 1988 and launched a private practice with a 
Tustin law firm. 
</P>
<P>
Wieben Stock becomes one of only five women among the county's 59 Superior 
Court jurists. Her appointment was praised as an "excellent choice" by Grace 
Emery, past president of the Orange County Women Lawyers Assn. and an officer 
in a similar statewide organization. But Emery also used Wieben Stock's 
appointment to condemn the governor for failing to appoint more women to the 
bench locally and around the state. 
</P>
<P>
"Sex shouldn't matter, but when you are so underrepresented it does, in a big 
way," Emery said. "Nancy's appointment is one of the few victories we've had. 
Frankly, to get only one appointment is extremely disappointing." 
</P>
<P>
Some judicial observers were surprised by Wieben Stock's appointment, believing 
that her solid track record as an administrator and trial court lawyer in the 
U.S. attorney's office made her a prime candidate to rise even further within 
the Justice Department. However, in recent weeks it became known that she was 
seeking the judicial post, and friends and legal associates say she wanted to 
remain close to her Fullerton home, in part, because of her husband and two 
young children. 
</P>
<P>
Wieben Stock, a 1976 UC Davis law school graduate, was chief of the U.S. 
attorney's Orange County office in Santa Ana and second in command for the 
agency's seven-county Southern California territory. 
</P>
<P>
"I had the highest post available, and it just seemed like the timing was right 
to make a career change," Wieben Stock said. "After commuting to Los Angeles 
for more than 10 years, this is like coming home. I'm very gratified." 
</P>
<P>
Wieben Stock declined to comment on how her appointment may affect the ongoing 
trial of a Newport Beach woman accused of looting more than $16 million from a 
now-defunct Santa Ana thrift, North America Savings &amp; Loan. Wieben Stock is 
the chief prosecutor in the case. When asked about her departure from the case, 
she would only say, "it's a very delicate matter that must be sorted out." 
</P>
<P>
One of the attorneys representing Janet Faye McKinzie, accused of defrauding 
scores of investors in North America, said Wieben Stock's withdrawal should not 
significantly affect the case. 
</P>
<P>
The Cuban-born Firmat is known for his attention to detail and willingness to 
defend and explain decisions. Firmat, a San Juan Capistrano resident, was 
appointed by Deukmejian to the Municipal Court bench in 1985 after practicing 
law in Fullerton for eight years. Firmat, a 1976 graduate of the Western State 
University law school in Fullerton, was en route to San Francisco on Wednesday 
night and not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Wieben Stock replaces former Superior Court Judge Betty L. Lamoreaux, while 
Firmat is taking the judicial seat vacated by Judge John H. Smith. Both 
Lamoreaux and Smith retired last year. 
</P>
<P>
Wieben Stock and Firmat could be sworn into office as early as Friday and take 
the bench Monday, said Patrick Hearn, an assistant administrator for Orange 
County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
The salary for Superior Court judges is $94,344. 
</P>
<P>
Rackauckas' appointment as a Municipal Court judge will bring the former 
prosecutor back into the public eye after two years as a private attorney. He 
worked as a deputy district attorney from 1972 to 1988, but took a year's leave 
to campaign against Bird in 1982. A skilled trial attorney, Rackauckas gained a 
reputation for winning difficult murder cases. 
</P>
<P>
Rackauckas, a Loyola University law school graduate, replaces former Municipal 
Judge Robert Hutson, who was named a Superior Court judge last year. 
</P>
<P>
Behn, a graduate of Western State University law school, was appointed to 
Firmat's post. A Municipal Court commissioner since 1983, Behn said becoming a 
jurist is "something I wanted for a long time. I've worked in this court and 
seen the judges in this court and always wanted to be one." 
</P>
<P>
McEachen, an attorney for Community Bank since 1979, said his appointment is 
more "thrilling" than his long-awaited trip to the Super Bowl game Sunday in 
New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
"Before I got my notice, I was pretty darn excited about the Super Bowl. But 
this certainly beats it," McEachen said of his new post. "This is something 
I've always wanted." 
</P>
<P>
McEachen, a Southwestern University law graduate, took the judge's oath of 
office minutes after learning of his appointment Wednesday. He will replace 
former Municipal Judge Kazuharu Makino, who became a Superior Court judge. 
</P>
<P>
Sundvold graduated from the University of San Diego law school and has been 
chief attorney for Safeco Insurance Co. since 1975. He replaces the late 
Municipal Judge Arthur D. Guy Jr.

CITIES SEEK COURT BAN OF SPRAYING; 
</P>
<P>
MEDFLY: HUNTINGTON BEACH, GARDEN GROVE AND WESTMINSTER ARE RUSHING TO OBTAIN AN 
ORDER HALTING A MALATHION ASSAULT IN THEIR AREA TONIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

GARDEN GROVE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As 400,000 North County residents brace for the biggest malathion assault in 
Orange County history tonight, lawyers are scrambling to stop it in Southern 
California's first legal challenge to the state's controversial campaign 
against the Mediterranean fruit fly. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with what they say is evidence of the danger of the pesticide malathion, 
attorneys for Huntington Beach and Garden Grove are to fly to Sacramento this 
morning to take the state to court. 
</P>
<P>
They will try in Superior Court to obtain a temporary restraining order to 
block the spraying of a 36-square-mile region where Medflies have been found. 
Westminster will join the legal maneuver. 
</P>
<P>
Malathion opposition leaders, who have packed city halls around the area this 
week with concerns about spraying safety, plan a 4:30 p.m. protest at Garden 
Grove and Harbor boulevards in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
But these critics, weighing the tight timing and previous failures to halt 
malathion spraying elsewhere, grudgingly say they expect the spraying to go on 
as scheduled, beginning at 9 p.m. over parts of nine cities. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we have to assume the spraying's going to go on," conceded Garden 
Grove's Mollie Haines, who has helped organize opposition. "But we want to make 
sure we can stop it the next time." 
</P>
<P>
And so the sometimes-feverish preparations for the spraying began Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Residents rushed to local hardware stores in search of protection for their 
cars, gobbling up $3.49 rolls of plastic and more elaborate $80 car covers. 
State officials say that while the malathion mixture can't hurt people, the 
sticky protein bait used to lure flies can tarnish cars. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all sold out -- all 200 rolls (of plastic) gone," said Dennis Anderson, 
manager of Builder's Emporium in Garden Grove. "All the stores in the spray 
area are trying to order more, because we knew it would be a hot item." 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, county agriculture workers on the local Medfly hot line ((714) 
447-7118) were deluged with more than 600 calls Wednesday from residents 
wanting to know where, when and how the spraying would take place. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Ana, where some residents are organizing an anti-malathion group, 
about a dozen people called City Hall with concerns but were told to look to 
state officials for answers. 
</P>
<P>
"At the local level, there's very little we can do," said Jill Arthur, a 
services administrator for the Santa Ana City Council. "We're powerless in this 
issue." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana officials do, however, plan to provide free parking tonight at the 
Fiesta Market Place garage, 300 East 5th St., for residents who do not have car 
covers. 
</P>
<P>
School officials in the spray area, reacting to the concerns of some parents, 
began their own preparations. 
</P>
<P>
At the Garden Grove Unified School District, which is almost entirely within 
the spray area, staff members are not expected to cover most outdoor equipment 
before the spraying, Superintendent Ed Dundon said. However, they will be told 
to hose down and clean them afterward, in keeping with state recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just going to do everything the state has told us to do," Dundon said. 
"We're going to go along with their statements that this stuff is not harmful 
and take some precautions. But we're neophytes in this, so we'll be a lot more 
aware how to deal with this Friday morning." 
</P>
<P>
In Westminster, about half of which is in the spray region, Assistant Supt. 
Ronald H. Fraser of the Westminster Unified School District said: "We have 
alerted all of our people to the spraying and told our night custodians to have 
everything under cover that they possibly can." 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that the spray plans have been "a headache" for school officials, 
Fraser said: "We are concerned and we're taking all the precautions we can." 
</P>
<P>
All the planning may be moot if a judge in Sacramento agrees to block the 
spraying. But history is not on the side of malathion foes. 
</P>
<P>
State officials, pointing to the courts' consistent refusal to block Northern 
California sprayings during the 1981 Medfly infestation, say they have wide 
latitude to take severe measures during emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
State officials assert that the aerial spraying is the only means available to 
halt the Medfly infestation and prevent it from doing widespread damage to 
California's $16-billion agricultural industry. 
</P>
<P>
The spraying poses no health risk, state officials have said repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, officials in the cities that decided this week to take the state 
to court -- Huntington Beach, Garden Grove and Westminster -- said they are 
optimistic about their chances in Sacramento, where they decided to file their 
case to save time. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've got a real good chance," Westminster City Atty. Richard D. Jones 
said. "What we're going to do is to force the state of California to justify 
the intrusion of this spraying and its safety." 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach city attorneys, preparing the case, plan to present written 
declarations from several U.S. health specialists to question malathion's 
safety. They were awaiting a few of those statements late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Our fax machine's going to be working overtime (Wednesday) night," Deputy City 
Atty. Robert C. Sangster said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the safety questions, city attorneys said they may attack the 
procedure used by the state in its spraying policy, including the lack of 
door-to-door notifications in Vietnamese and the inclusion in the spray zone of 
areas where Medflies were not found. 
</P>
<P>
The state has found two fertile Medflies in Garden Grove and Westminster since 
December. Under state protocol, that prompted state officials to decide last 
week to spray a large area around and between those finds and distributed 
notices in Spanish and English to every resident. 
</P>
<P>
While spraying has been more widespread in the Los Angeles area during the 
current infestation, the Garden Grove area is just the second to undergo aerial 
applications in Orange County. Parts of Brea, Fullerton and La Habra have 
already been sprayed four times, most recently Monday night.

U.S. ATTORNEY BACKS GATES' RANCHO PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Justice Department and the County Board of Supervisors are poised for a 
showdown over Rancho del Rio, a sprawling smuggler's haven seized by federal 
drug agents five years ago and given to the county to be used to enhance local 
law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
A terse, two-page letter from U.S. Atty. Robert L. Brosio, warning the county 
that a proposed sale of the property might violate federal drug laws, indicates 
that the federal prosecutor "does not fully understand the situation or the 
county budget process," according to a staff memo prepared Wednesday for the 
supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Further, the board should not concern itself with the U.S. attorney's "implied 
threat" that selling the property might bar the county from receiving proceeds 
from future federal drug seizures, the memo said. 
</P>
<P>
The memorandum was prepared by Assistant County Counsel Arthur C. Wahlstedt and 
forwarded to the board by the county administrative officer, Ernie Schneider. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very much concerned by the tone of the letter (from Brosio) and the 
prohibitions it purported to place on the possible sale of the property," 
Schneider told the board. 
</P>
<P>
Federal agents seized Rancho del Rio in 1985 after the Orange County Sheriff's 
Department found evidence that the 23-acre ranch in South County was the base 
for a drug-smuggling ring. 
</P>
<P>
Acting under a 1984 law allowing the government to donate assets seized during 
drug raids to local law enforcement efforts, federal officials gave the ranch 
to the county in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
But the county could just as easily work through state authorities in future 
drug seizures, Wahlstedt said in his memo. 
</P>
<P>
"With respect to Mr. Brosio's implied threat to keep Orange County from 
receiving forfeitures in the future, you should know that there is a parallel 
program in the state," Wahlstedt wrote. "Future forfeitures could be handled in 
this manner." 
</P>
<P>
The county staff's response to Brosio's letter is the latest development in a 
battle over the future of Rancho del Rio. Sheriff-Coroner Brad Gates has 
proposed converting the ranch into a training center for local law enforcement 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Facing an estimated $5-million budget deficit in the Sheriff's Department this 
year, supervisors are considering a staff proposal to sell the property, which 
could bring in up to $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Gates has said that the proposed sale could violate the intent of federal drug 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
Brosio's letter reminded board members that the ranch was deeded to the county 
"based on the representation that the property would be developed into a 
law-enforcement training center." 
</P>
<P>
Grace Denton, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles, 
explained the letter further: "We're not going to give them (the Board of 
Supervisors) money because they can't balance the budget. If the money (from 
the sale of the ranch) were used to pay for programs already in the budget, it 
would violate federal drug laws." 
</P>
<P>
According to Wahlstedt's memo, however, the county would be using the money to 
pay for programs for which there are currently no funds. 
</P>
<P>
"As we understand the facts, the sheriff's office is substantially over its 
1989-90 budget, and sale is intended to partially alleviate this situation and 
permit that office to continue its operations for the remainder of this fiscal 
year," Wahlstedt said in his memo.

AGENCY URGES STUDY OF CITY PLAN FOR SOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA RIVERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Community Development Council on Wednesday refused to approve a city plan 
under which the CDC would share its building with a charity forced by 
complaining neighbors to move. 
</P>
<P>
Agency directors instead voted 11 to 0, with one abstention, to let a committee 
study the city-initiated plan for Share Our Selves to occupy 4,200 square feet 
in the council's building at 1695 W. MacArthur Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, SOS would move into the 35,000-square-foot facility -- with 
part of its rent being paid by the city -- until the charity can find and 
purchase its own quarters. 
</P>
<P>
However, it is uncertain if any such plan would be implemented because SOS 
directors this week rejected a similar proposal. 
</P>
<P>
CDC officials said Wednesday that they want SOS to be included in any lease 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
The plan provides two options for the charity's relocation. Under a three-year 
option, SOS would sublease space at a monthly rent of $3,780. SOS would 
initially pay $610 of the rent, with the city picking up the $3,170 balance. 
The charity would pay 25% of the rent during the next 12 months and 50% during 
the last year of the arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
Under a short-term option, SOS could enter a six-month lease but would be 
required to pay more rent for the same space. The city would pay only 25% of 
the monthly bill. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council narrowly approved the plan Tuesday night and agreed to 
guarantee the financial terms. 
</P>
<P>
The CDC's lease on the building expires in August, 1992, and SOS directors had 
complained that if they accepted the long-term option they would be forced to 
relocate again if the CDC decided not to remain in the building. 
</P>
<P>
SOS directors also called the six-month option impractical should they find a 
permanent home before the lease term expired. 
</P>
<P>
The charity has made offers on two industrial buildings in Costa Mesa. One is 
known as the Fabric Store, at 18th Street and Placentia Avenue, and the other 
is at 1550 Superior Avenue. Both are on the west side of the city and are 
likely to draw opposition from some of the same residents who opposed the 
charity's presence at the city-managed Rea Community Center, its home for the 
past nine years. 
</P>
<P>
One of the county's largest private charities, SOS is being evicted from the 
Rea center by the City Council. The city had earlier denied a request that the 
charity be allowed to remain at the center while looking for a new home. CARLA

ELECTION CHALLENGE TO GO BEFORE JUDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A trial in the long-awaited lawsuit challenging the right of Cameron Cosgrove 
to hold his City Council seat should begin next Wednesday, according to lawyers 
arguing the case. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, which argues that Cosgrove was seated illegally in July, 1988, 
will be heard by Judge Claude M. Owens in Orange County Superior Court. At that 
hearing, the judge will consider only the legal arguments surrounding the case. 
Based on those arguments, he will determine whether a full trial is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
The case has been hotly debated for more than a year, dividing the council and 
provoking angry reactions in the community. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Larry Agran, a Cosgrove supporter, calls the litigation "purely 
political" and argues that Cosgrove should be allowed to serve out his term. 
Cosgrove is seeking re-election in the city's June 5 election. 
</P>
<P>
However, Sally Anne Sheridan, Agran's chief council rival and opponent in the 
upcoming mayor's race, has consistently supported the lawsuit and vehemently 
denounced the way in which Cosgrove was seated. 
</P>
<P>
Cosgrove ran for the council in June, 1988. At the same time, voters approved 
Measure D, a City Charter amendment stating that if a council member is elected 
mayor, the top unseated vote-getter in the council race will succeed to the 
vacant seat, but also allowing residents to petition for a special election for 
the seat. 
</P>
<P>
Cosgrove placed third in the race for two open council seats but was elevated 
to fill Agran's unexpired term because Agran was elected mayor. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is whether the provisions of Measure D were in effect for 1988 
election. Plaintiffs in the case, two Irvine residents, have argued that the 
measure took effect before Cosgrove was formally seated. 
</P>
<P>
If the measure is found not to have taken effect until after Cosgrove took his 
seat on the council, he would be entitled to keep it without facing a special 
election. 
</P>
<P>
The litigation has dragged on for months, with each side blaming the other for 
a succession of delays. Next week will represent the first time the issue has 
gone to trial, and if the matter cannot be disposed of in a single session, it 
will face yet another setback. 
</P>
<P>
The judge, who is retired, works on assignment and only in odd-numbered months, 
so next week's hearing represents the last chance before March for the case to 
be resolved. JIM NEWTON

E. GERMAN PASTOR SEEKS INSPIRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Standing in the lobby of the Crystal Cathedral, Lutheran Pastor Jenz Heil of 
East Germany marveled at the Rev. Robert H. Schuller's achievement. 
</P>
<P>
Heil, who heads a modest church of 100 active members in the town of Helma, 
dreams of building his own "mega-church" now that communist barriers to 
religious freedom have started to come down. 
</P>
<P>
With assistance from Crystal Cathedral members, Heil traveled to Southern 
California to be among the 2,700 ministers and church leaders Wednesday 
attending a four-day conference to learn how to attract new members and raise 
money for their ministries. 
</P>
<P>
Heil said that he hopes to gain "ideas, inspiration and blessing" from the 
conference, which includes seminars on staffing, fund raising and training, as 
well as music and worship services. 
</P>
<P>
The East German pastor said he already has attracted about 98 new members to 
his church in the last two years by applying the philosophy of Schuller and 
Norman Vincent Peale, both advocates of the power of positive thinking. When 
Heil arrived in Helma two years ago, 1,500 people were registered as members of 
its state-controlled church, but only two were active participants. 
</P>
<P>
Schuller's conference comes at a time of great opportunity for growth in his 
church, Heil said. With the tearing down of the Berlin Wall and more freedom 
for East Germans, Heil said there is a change of feeling toward religion. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, with the wall, there is a very positive attitude," he said. "Before, it 
was a negative theology." 
</P>
<P>
Heil wasn't the only participant at the conference with Soviet and East bloc 
notions of glasnost on his mind. Schuller, in his keynote address, spoke of his 
appearance on Soviet television Dec. 25. 
</P>
<P>
Schuller traveled to Moscow with industrialist Armand Hammer in December to 
negotiate a possible Christmas Eve broadcast of his weekly "Hour of Power" 
program. Instead, a Soviet television official told him that he should tape a 
15-minute sermon while in the country and arrangements would be made to air it. 
The tape was broadcast Christmas Day on state-owned television. 
</P>
<P>
In the video, which was shown during the keynote address, much of his sermon 
addressed improved relations between the United States and the Soviet Union and 
his hopes for a "decade of peace" in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"When so much good is happening, you prove to me that there is no God," he told 
Soviet viewers, questioning skeptics in what has been an officially atheistic 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
His only reference to Scripture in the video, to be aired on the "Hour of 
Power" in February, came when he quoted Jeremiah 29:11: "I have a plan for 
life, says the Lord. It is a plan for good and not evil. It is a plan to give 
you a future with hope."TED JOHNSON

<P>
The City Council has voted unanimously to give Seal Beach lifeguards the power 
to regulate fishing activities on the city's pier and beaches. 
</P>
<P>
Council members decided that their action would help lifeguards provide better 
safety for swimmers and surfers in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Overhead casting is allowed from the beach; only underhand and side-casting 
from the pier. 
</P>
<P>
Lifeguards would be expected to prevent such legal activities as casting only 
when the beaches and waters are crowded and when injuries are deemed likely. At 
that time, fishermen will be asked to move to a less-crowded area of the beach.

TONIGHT'S MEDFLY SPRAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 9 p.m., state helicopters will begin spraying hundreds of gallons of a 
malathion-bait mixture over 36 square miles in nine North County cities, 
including virtually all of Garden Grove, half of Westminster and parts of 
Huntington Beach, Los Alamitos, Cypress, Stanton, Anaheim, Orange and Santa 
Ana. Two Mediterranean fruit flies have been found in the region. 
</P>
<P>
Local residents concerned about the safety of the spraying are planning a 4:30 
p.m. protest today at Garden Grove and Harbor boulevards in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
The next spraying for the area is scheduled Feb. 15. No further dates have been 
set, but state officials say they may spray the area up to a dozen times by 
summer, beginning every three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 State guidelines require door-to-door notification of malathion spraying in 
English and Spanish, but do not provide for other languages. Community leaders 
say that as a result, many Vietnamese residents in Garden Grove and Westminster 
are ill-informed about tonight's spraying. The Times has translated into 
Vietnamese the details of the spraying and what to do before, during and 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Times 
</P>
<P>
BEFORE AND DURING THE SPRAYING: 
</P>
<P>
Stay indoors if possible. Officials say the amount of pesticide used in the 
spray is small enough that contact with it will not cause any long-term health 
effects. It can be an irritant to the eyes, but no other short-term effect is 
likely. The semisweet mixture of malathion and corn syrup is released in 
droplets too large to inhale. Its toxicity is equivalent to that of laundry 
detergent, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Cover cars parked outside. The mixture may cause blemishes or discoloration to 
the finish or paint of some cars. 
</P>
<P>
Keep dogs, cats, or other pets in garages or under cover. 
</P>
<P>
Shallow back-yard fish ponds should be covered. Officials say pool owners 
should not worry because the pesticide will not affect the water quality in a 
standard size pool. 
</P>
<P>
ABOUT THE SPRAYING: 
</P>
<P>
The droplets to be sprayed are from a mixture that is about three-quarters 
protein-corn syrup bait, to lure the fruit flies, and one-quarter malathion, 
the pesticide being used to kill them. About 12 ounces per square mile were 
scheduled to be applied over the target area. 
</P>
<P>
Although the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has ordered new tests of 
malathion, to try to resolve questions about its effect on human health, state 
officials assert that it is "one of the safest insecticides in use today." 
State officials say that the low doses used in aerial spraying pose no health 
threat to anyone, including pregnant women, infants, children, the elderly and 
the chronically ill. They also say that no one should have any reservations 
about going outside after the spraying is completed. Animals with the exception 
of fish, which are considered very susceptible should not be affected either, 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
AFTER THE SPRAYING: 
</P>
<P>
Friday morning, all patio furniture, play equipment, tools and household items 
left outdoors during the spraying should be hosed down. If a car has been 
sprayed, it should be washed with soap and water.

FULLERTON'S LUCZAJ NAMED BUENA PARK FOOTBALL COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM HAMILTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Fullerton High School football coach Martin Luczaj, who turned a 
struggling program into a playoff participant for six consecutive seasons, has 
been named football coach at Buena Park. 
</P>
<P>
Luczaj, 36, compiled a 52-19 record, winning three league titles and leading 
Fullerton into the Central Conference championship game twice (one title) 
before he resigned in March 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Luczaj became Orange County's youngest head coach at 28 in 1981. Fullerton, 1-9 
in 1980, won the Freeway League title in Luczaj's first season with an 8-3 
record. 
</P>
<P>
Luczaj spent the past two years as Fullerton's baseball coach and as an 
assistant football coach at Fullerton College. 
</P>
<P>
Buena Park has struggled in the Freeway League during the past six years, 
losing 28 consecutive league games before defeating Sonora, 21-13, last fall. 
</P>
<P>
"Marty wanted to get back to coaching on the high school level and there are 
some distinct advantages at Buena Park," said Greg Bice, assistant 
superintendent in charge of personnel for the Fullerton Union High School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
"Buena Park has a very successful bingo program (generating funds for 
extracurricular activities) and the school has added a weight room and a 
training room," Bice said. 
</P>

ICN SELLS ITS INTEREST AFTER SYNCOR ADOPTS 'POISON PILL' PLAN 
</P>

<P>
ICN Pharmaceuticals has sold its 8.3% stake in Syncor International, ending 
months of speculation that it might try to take over the tiny San Fernando 
Valley drug company. 
</P>
<P>
The Costa Mesa-based firm said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission that it sold 640,000 shas in Syncor during early January for between 
$7.75 and $8 per share. 
</P>
<P>
Syncor recently adopted a shareholder rights plan, a common takeover defense 
often referred to as a "poison pill." If any party acquired 20% or more of 
Syncor's stock without the consent of the company's directors, shareholders 
would have the option of buying Syncor shares at half price. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it became apparent that the chances of ICN acquiring Syncor were 
becoming increasingly remote," said Stephen Gerber, an analyst with Bateman 
Eichler, Hill Richards in Los Angeles. "I believe they ultimately had wanted to 
acquire the company." 
</P>
<P>
ICN spokesman Jack Sholl refused to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Syncor is a Chatsworth-based operator of 84 pharmacy service centers that 
provide radioactive pharmaceuticals to hospitals and doctors. 
</P>
<P>
ICN originally acquired an interest in Syncor three years ago and said at the 
time that its purchase was for investment purposes only and that it had "no 
present plans to participate in the management or control of the company." 
</P>
<P>
Subsequent purchases, however, fueled speculation that ICN might try to buy the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
ICN has regularly acquired smaller companies. Last September, ICN Biomedicals 
bought the biomedical business of Flow General Inc. of McLean, Va., for 
approximately $41.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Flow Laboratories makes biomedical products for research laboratories, 
universities, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and government 
research laboratories. Compiled by Gregory Crouch / Times staff writer

HOTELS HOPE BUSINESS TAKES OFF WITH AIRPORT TERMINAL OPENING; 
</P>
<P>
ACCOMMODATIONS: WHILE BUSINESS HAS BEEN ON AN UPSWING, ROOMS HAVE GONE UNFILLED 
BECAUSE OF OVERBUILDING IN THE AREA. THE 1989 OCCUPANCY RATE WAS JUST 60%. 
</P>

<P>
The pending foreclosure of the Irvine Marriott comes at a time when major 
hotels near John Wayne Airport have been struggling because of overbuilding and 
resulting room rate wars that reduce profits, analysts said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel operators are pinning their hopes for a turnaround on the scheduled 
completion of the new terminal at the airport and a planned increase in the 
number of flights to 73 a day, up from 55 now, by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough for hotels in the John Wayne (Airport area) market, tougher for 
hotels relative to other parts of the country," said Sandra Louvier, a hotel 
specialist for the accounting firm of Laventhol &amp; Horwath in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
While business at the hotels has been on the upswing, rooms are still going 
unfilled because of overbuilding, Louvier said. Higher land acquisition and 
other costs in the pricey airport area of Orange County compared to other areas 
of the nation require hotels to post strong occupancy rates to stay profitable. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, however, only about 60% of the rooms were filled at airport-area 
hotels on average, said Joanne Sobota of Pannell Kerr Forster, an accounting 
and management firm in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
With construction of about 1,000 new hotel rooms over a three-year period 
ending in 1987, hotels were forced to offer deep discounts. As a result, the 
price of a room dropped from an average of $77 a night in 1984 to an average of 
$74 in 1988, Sobota said. Last year, the price rebounded slightly to an average 
of $78. 
</P>
<P>
"The market has taken some time to recover, but it has," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But not before it took its toll on competitors last year. The 293-room Registry 
Hotel in Irvine went bankrupt and was bought by a group of Orange County 
investors. It reopened as the Radisson Plaza. Also, the 340-room Sheraton 
Newport Beach filed for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
Observers said the Washington-based Marriott Corp. may have created some of its 
own troubles by expanding too rapidly in the airport area, where it has four 
hotels. Besides the Irvine Marriott, there is the Newport Beach Marriott Hotel 
and Tennis Club and the Marriott Suites in Costa Mesa and Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the four Marriott hotels apparently were trying to enhance their 
share of the market by catering to different segments. Instead, the chain may 
have ended up simply dividing its loyal customer base among different 
properties. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't make much sense to me that they would want them together," said 
Gary Wescombe, a partner at the accounting firm of Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co. 
in Newport Beach, about the close grouping of the four Marriotts. 
</P>
<P>
Some hotels are already preparing for what they hope will be a new onslaught of 
business. Le Meridien Hotel in Newport Beach is undergoing a $5-million face 
lift under the new ownership of Hong Kong businessman Stanley Ho. The Westin 
South Coast Plaza hotel has been undergoing a $10.5-million renovation. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Deighton, general manager of Westin South Coast Plaza, said the 
remodeling was done "to stay a step ahead of the competition." Only the strong 
survive, he said. "Unless the owners have deep pockets, it's hard to stay in 
this market." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the years of hard times, Wescombe said his firm is optimistic about the 
airport-area hotel business. 
</P>
<P>
"I would think within the next year we should see increased occupancy. And once 
(the hotels' management) increase the occupancy, they can increase the rates," 
he said.

A USC graduate student was shot and wounded a half-block from his campus-owned 
apartment Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The unidentified graduate student of business administration, who had been 
walking near the Terrace Apartments in the 2900 block of Orchard Avenue, was 
hit in the right calf when an unknown gunman fired several shots, said campus 
Department of Security Services Chief Steven Ward. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman ran away, and no suspects were arrested in the 10:19 p.m. incident, 
Ward said. The student went to his apartment building and sought help from 
campus police stationed there. "At this point, we have no idea what the motive 
may have been," Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
The student was in stable condition at Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital, Ward 
said.

A 22-year-old Fullerton College student was killed instantly when his car 
crashed into a six-foot concrete wall in Placentia, authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Harvey Cook of Brea was ejected about 20 feet from his 1964 Volkswagen 
after it struck a curb before crashing into the wall. 
</P>
<P>
Cook's body was hurled into the wall before landing on the sidewalk, Placentia 
Police Sgt. Jay Fricke said. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred Wednesday on Bastanchury Road as Cook was heading home, 
Fricke said. Eyewitnesses reported that the Fullerton College student was 
driving between 50 and 60 m.p.h. in a 40-m.p.h. zone. He was alone in the car, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Fricke said investigators are awaiting the results of toxicological tests from 
the Orange County Coroner's Department to determine whether Cook was driving 
under the influence of alcohol.

An Israeli businessman linked to mercenaries who trained Medellin drug cartel 
gunmen was found dead at the airport here, stuffed into the trunk of a car, 
police said today. 
</P>
<P>
The body of Arik Afek was discovered after Metro-Dade police received 
complaints of an offensive odor coming from a car in the Miami International 
Airport parking garage, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of death was not immediately announced, but was being investigated as 
a homicide, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli television reported that Afek, who has a home just outside Miami, was 
named in connection with Israeli mercenaries in Colombia who trained drug 
lords. 
</P>
<P>
He also allegedly helped reserve Israeli army Lt. Col. Yair Klein escape 
Colombia after reports emerged he was training the guards of drug lords there. 
Klein later said he thought he was training farmers to fight guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
Afek and Klein were named in a Colombian arrest warrant in September, according 
to the Colombian news agency Colprensa, but Israel refused to extradite Klein. 
</P>
<P>
Israel television also claimed that Afek was being investigated by the CIA, 
which had given him a U.S. passport in return for information on Israeli 
activity in Colombia.

TARZANA WOMAN ARRESTED IN DEATH OF MILLIONAIRE HUSBAND

<TEXT>
<P>
A Tarzana woman who said she shot and killed her millionaire husband because 
she thought he was a burglar was in jail this morning on suspicion of murder, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Carole Evelyn Mellinger, 48, was arrested after the shooting at 8 p.m. 
Wednesday in the 19700 block of Komar Drive, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband, Brainerd Lee Mellinger, 69, was found shot to death in the den of 
the home in the exclusive hillside area of Tarzana, Detective Rick Swanston 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the victim owned Mellinger Co., an import-export business located 
in Woodland Hills, and often appeared on promotional advertisements on 
cable-television that dealt with establishing import-export businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Swanston said Brainerd Mellinger was shot several times in the chest shortly 
after he came home. When police arrived, his wife said she had shot him because 
she "mistook" him for a burglar, Swanston said. 
</P>
<P>
But "inconsistencies in her statements" and other evidence in the house led 
police to arrest Carole Mellinger, Swanston said. She was being held without 
bail at the Van Nuys jail.

Cuba receives an explanation for the incident and is satisfied that UNITA will 
not continue to attack its forces during the withdrawal, part of peace accords 
agreed with South Africa and Angola in December, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Cuba has already brought home more than 31,000 of its 50,000 troops in Angola.

Negotiators today reached an agreement calling for a cease-fire along a border 
separating heavily armed camps of Armenian and Azerbaijani nationalists, Tass 
press agency said. 
</P>
<P>
Tass said the cease-fire was declared by members of the Soviet Parliament, the 
Armenian All-National Movement and the People's Front of Nakhichevan. 
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire was to take effect immediately along the 130-mile border 
separating Armenia and Nakhichevan, an autonomous region within Armenia that 
considers itself part of the neighboring republic of Azerbaijan. 
</P>
<P>
The border region has been among the most tense in the bloody struggle between 
Armenian and Azerbaijani nationalists that erupted throughout the two republics 
on Jan. 13 and has killed at least 171 people. 
</P>
<P>
The violence began with anti-Armenian riots in Azerbaijan, but it grew into a 
drive for secession by some Azerbaijanis. Soviet soldiers on Saturday occupied 
the Azerbaijani capital of Baku, the scene of some of the fiercest fighting. 
</P>
<P>
"According to the agreement . . . along the entire border between Armenia and 
the Nakhichevan Autonomous Region all exchanges of fire between opposing 
informal groups must stop," Tass said in an announcement. 
</P>
<P>
The statement, which also was read over the nightly TV news program "Vremya," 
said the cease-fire was to start at 4 p.m. Moscow time, but the announcement 
did not say whether shooting had actually stopped. 
</P>
<P>
Both republics have been closed to most foreign reporters, and the status of 
the cease-fire could not immediately be confirmed independently. 
</P>
<P>
Tass said the negotiators who reached the cease-fire accord will meet again 
Saturday to agree on disbanding militias in the region and sending them home. 
It said Soviet army soldiers would guarantee the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
In another sign of accommodation, a Baltic nationalist group said earlier today 
that an Armenian organization has accepted an invitation to attend peace talks 
aimed at ending the entire ethnic conflict with Azerbaijanis. 
</P>
<P>
There was no word on whether an Azerbaijani delegation would attend the talks, 
planned for Monday in the Latvian capital, Riga. 
</P>
<P>
Communist leaders in Azerbaijan today blamed their former leader for the crisis 
and expelled him from the party. More Soviet troops were reported killed in 
attacks by militants in Baku. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview today from Riga, Anda Anspoka of the Latvian People's 
Front said the group received a letter of confirmation from the Armenian 
People's Front to attend a peace conference Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Armenian group authorized its representatives to "sign any documents" to 
end the ethnic strife, Anspoka said.

CHINA MODEL IN HONG KONG MIGHT BE SEEKING ASYLUM

One of China's top fashion models has been reported missing from a Hong Kong 
hotel, fueling speculation she is seeking political asylum in the British 
colony, a Hong Kong newspaper said today. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese-language Sing Tao Wen Pao said Zhu Bei, 22, disappeared with all 
her luggage from her hotel room just before she was due to return to China on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The evening paper said Zhu had been seen around town on the arm of a prominent 
Hong Kong television actor during her nine-day visit to the colony to take part 
in a fashion promotion. 
</P>
<P>
It said rumors were circulating that Zhu, who came here with 12 other models 
from China, had defected. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no information about the reports and we do not comment on individual 
applications for asylum," a government spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Sino-Hong Kong relations are only just recovering from a furor caused when Hong 
Kong allowed a Chinese swimmer, Yang Yang, to leave the colony for the United 
States last October. 
</P>
<P>
Yang claimed asylum in Hong Kong on the grounds he had played a part in the 
pro-democracy movement that rocked China in May and June and that he faced 
punishment if he returned.

ACTIVISTS RATE BUSH CHOICE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS CHIEF LOW

President Bush plans to announce his choice for the top civil rights job in the 
Justice Department is a former New York state legislator, John R. Dunne, White 
House sources said today. 
</P>
<P>
Dunne would fill a post left vacant since December, 1988. Bush's first choice, 
William Lucas, failed to win Senate confirmation last year. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has held two meetings this month with civil rights leaders alarmed at the 
recent wave of racial bombings and threats in the South. NAACP leaders on 
Monday urged the President to step up the Justice Department's efforts to 
promote racial understanding through community outreach offices. 
</P>
<P>
Dunne, 59, of Garden City, N.Y., has a sparse background on civil rights and 
consistently received low ratings from the New York Civil Liberties Union for 
votes cast while in the state Senate. 
</P>
<P>
After some reports that Dunne was in line for the civil rights post, he 
resigned from the all-male Garden City Golf Club, which he had belonged to for 
32 years. 
</P>
<P>
During most of his 24 years in the state Legislature, a part-time post, Dunne 
lived in Albany at the Fort Orange Club, which until 1988 barred women as 
members. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, he has the backing of Democratic Rep. Charles Rangel, an old 
friend and the most powerful black member of New York's congressional 
delegation. Dunne is white. 
</P>
<P>
"If the President has to pick a Republican, he couldn't pick a more decent 
person than John Dunne," Rangel said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
Dunne also has the active support of Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh. 
</P>
<P>
A graduate of Georgetown University and Yale Law School, Dunne resigned his 
legislative seat last September after losing a contest for majority leader in 
the Republican-controlled state Senate. He is a partner in a Uniondale, N.Y., 
law firm. 
</P>
<P>
During his state Senate career, Dunne was better known for his role in drafting 
environmental and corrections legislation, although he served on the Judiciary 
Committee, which handles such matters as civil rights.

The announcement, made in the conference hall of the shipyard where Solidarity 
was formed in 1980, followed a news conference with Solidarity leader Lech 
Walesa attended by about 300 workers and a group of reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Zbigniew Lis, Solidarity chief in the shipyard, told the applauding workers the 
government appointed Hans Szyc as manager of the shipyard, which will remain a 
state-owned enterprise but will be open to foreign investment as well as 
investment by workers.

<P>
A spokesman for the auto maker confirmed late Wednesday that it will begin a 
six-city tour Feb. 21 in Washington that will include product displays and news

Called the "Tour of the 90s," it will also include receptions for opinion 
makers in Washington, New York, Dallas, Atlanta, Chicago and Los Angeles before 
ending in May. 
</P>
<P>
"It is an attempt to bring a ray of light into all that gloom and doom that has

</P>
<P>
The tour comes as Chrysler's market share, profits and stock prices are

Contracts settled through collective bargaining last year provided workers 
average annual wage increases of 3.3% over the life of the pacts, the 
government said today. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department said 1989 was the first time since 1981 that negotiated 
settlements provided larger wage adjustments than the contracts they replaced. 
The last time parties to 1989 settlements negotiated, usually in 1986 or 1987, 
average wage rate adjustments were 2.4% over the contract term. 
</P>
<P>
Wage restorations in steel and other industries, as well as wage gains for 
nurses, accounted for the difference, the agency said.

Loomis Sayles &amp; Co., an investment firm based in Boston, on Wednesday sold

Last summer, Loomis Sayles controlled 12.3% of the company.

"I sold every share I owned," said Ken Heebler, Loomis Sayles' portfolio

stocks no longer seem attractive.

About 6.67 million shares -- nearly 17% of the 40 million Texas Air shares

The producers shifted gears, saying that a revival of "Annie," the 1977 musical

Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam, Conn., during the summer for performances 
and revisions.

Playwright Arthur Miller, in London for rehearsals of his play "The Price," 
which opens next month, accused U.S. theater of being superficial. 
</P>
<P>
Contrasting unsubsidized theater in the United States with the state-aided 
British theater, Miller said Wednesday that American theater has often 
degenerated into a search for titillating ways to fill unsubsidized and 
expensive seats. 
</P>
<P>
"Theaters in the States are finding it very difficult to continue because they 
feel they have got to constantly excite audiences in a most superficial way," 
the 74-year-old playwright told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking during a break in rehearsals for "The Price" at the Young Vic theater, 
he said standards in British theater could fall if subsidies were reduced or 
stopped. 
</P>
<P>
The issue is a hot topic in Britain, where Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's 
government is accused by critics of starving state-aided theaters and other 
arts of sufficient public funding. Her Conservative government favors funding 
of the arts by private business sponsorship.

JOHN WATERS' 'HAIRSPRAY' TO BE RESTYLED AS MUSICAL

John Waters on Broadway? 
</P>
<P>
Waters' last project, "Hairspray," may yet squirt into another life form, 
having already logged time as a hit feature film, videocassette and record 
album. 
</P>
<P>
The film has been optioned as a Broadway musical. 
</P>
<P>
For an undisclosed sum, Hollywood producer Scott Rudin has obtained the rights 
to develop the film into a stage show, according to Robert Shaye, the president 
of New Line Cinema, which released the film. Plans are under way to put 
together a writing team. No opening date has been projected. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's great," Waters said from the Los Angeles sound stage where he is 
supervising the mix on his new film "Cry-Baby," readying it for April release. 
"This has been in the works for a long time, and I think it has all the 
elements for a great musical. What we need is a 15-year-old Ethel Merman to 
play the lead." 
</P>
<P>
Waters also said he thinks a woman should play the part originated on screen by 
the late Divine, the immense cross-dressing actor whose presence was a hallmark 
in the director's films over the years. 
</P>
<P>
"There's only one Divine," Waters said. 
</P>
<P>
Released in February, 1988, "Hairspray" earned $7 million at the box office and 
won wide-spread critical acclaim. 
</P>
<P>
The movie, set in the Baltimore of 1962, followed as a plump teen-ager -- 
played by Ricki Lake -- tried to find a place on a TV dance show. From there it 
segued into a meditation on the sometimes sharp differences between attractive 
people and unattractive people and used that as a platform to explore racial 
prejudice.

An attorney for Foxx raised questions about the auction earlier this week and 
will argue the matter in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Las Vegas Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills attorney Paul Whitford said the auction, ordered by the Internal 
Revenue Service, would conflict with the rights of the bankruptcy court. Foxx 
filed for bankruptcy in 1983, and some of his assets have been sold over the 
years to pay creditors. 
</P>
<P>
The IRS moved in on Foxx last November, seizing his Las Vegas home, several 
cars and expensive jewelry. The IRS wants to sell the property at auction 
Saturday to pay nearly $900,000 in back taxes, interest and penalties. 
</P>
<P>
Whitford said the IRS auction would conflict with the rights of creditors in 
the bankruptcy case. Deiro's office said the auction will start at 10 a.m. 
Saturday at the Cashman Field Center.

ASK DR. RUTH: SHE'LL TAKE A MAN WHO DOES THOSE NICE LITTLE THINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Question: Some time ago you asked women to write in and tell you why they need 
men. A woman had written that she could have orgasms alone, simply by 
fantasizing, so who needs men? Well, I do, and for a lot of reasons unrelated 
to sex or orgasms. 
</P>
<P>
I need a man who does all the little caring things like making the bed when I 
have a deadline to make, watering the plants when I forget, having a fire ready 
on the hearth every winter night, buying groceries, helping with dinner, doing 
dishes, taking me out for dinner and dancing, enjoying movies and TV with me -- 
and all this done not because it is expected but just because he wants to, 
expecting nothing in return. 
</P>
<P>
I am a great cook and we do the big number in the king-size bed together, too. 
But all those other unasked-for things are what you get from a real, solid, 
real-life man. Fantasy men never do those little things that mean so much. Why 
do women need men? To love and be loved by. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Thank you for writing, and congratulations. 
</P>
<P>
Let me say, I do know men like that, and they are not just something women 
yearn for. Also, I have known men who learned to act like that and didn't start 
out that way -- and their improved act was really appreciated. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Am I the only living human being who does not feel any need for 
self-gratification? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. I have encountered lots of people who never think of it. You go on in 
your letter to say that you have had 20 lovers and that you have no trouble 
with orgasms. Also that you can go a long time without sex and not feel 
deprived. In the course of my practice as a sex therapist, I have had a number 
of clients with experiences like yours, and I do not consider them to be 
anywhere but in the sexual mainstream. However, in the present era, anyone who 
has had 20 lovers would be wise to be tested for sexually transmitted disease, 
including AIDS. And avoid promiscuity in the future. 
</P>
<P>
I have to tell you this because it obviously is not on your mind. And in this 
era it has to be. 
</P>
<P>
I don't say no one can have sex anymore, or no one can have terrific sex 
anymore. I say you can be wise and have a wonderful life.

LIZ SMITH: DAWN STEEL WALKS AWAY WITH NIFTY $6.4 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LIZ SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How would you feel about $6.4 million -- which is what the first female movie 
tycoon of any real effect -- Dawn Steel -- is said to have walked away with in 
all those recent maneuvers whereby Sony bought Columbia Pictures? (The Japanese 
quickly installed Jon Peters and Peter Guber in Dawn's place.) 
</P>
<P>
Well, I feel darned good about it. Dawn deserved a great settlement and the 
profit on her Columbia stock. She did a wonderful job, taking over in the wake 
of British movie man David Puttnam. And Dawn didn't even get to stay at 
Columbia long enough to prove all she might have been able to accomplish. 
That's OK, she made a good high-water mark. 
</P>
<P>
STEEL REFUSES to confirm or deny the amount quoted above. But she gave an 
interview to the London Daily Mail's reporter with the great name -- Baz 
Bamigboye -- and this is the figure he offers. I think it's right in the 
ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
Baz said Dawn is glad her job as head of Columbia is over. He quotes her: "The 
work became very administrative and not at all about being creative and making 
movies. I wasn't making the movies. I was making the deals, overseeing the 
marketing and the budgets -- and it wasn't what I was about. 
</P>
<P>
"I said to a friend the other day that I couldn't remember the last time I had 
a haircut or sat down and read a book for ME and not for work. More 
importantly, I feel now it's crucial to have time to yourself, time to 
daydream. It made me feel resentful that I didn't have it. I felt I had become 
a drudge. And that's awful. I began to feel like I was selling cars." 
</P>
<P>
Regarding her tough reputation, Dawn remarks, "Look, I'm not Mary Poppins, but 
I think I functioned with integrity. And it's true that I am demanding of 
myself and of the people who work for me. Now I'm going to think about my 
future. I've had offers, but I'm taking time off to dream." 
</P>
<P>
THEY CAN'T keep Jackie Mason down, not even if ABC cancels his TV series 
"Chicken Soup," not even if he is criticized for things he said about Mayor 
David Dinkins of New York when he (Jackie) was working for Rudy Giuliani during 
the recent campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie opens at Joe Papp's distinguished Public Theater in New York Saturday 
night for a week of previews of his new one-man show, to be called "Jackie 
Mason . . . Brand New." 
</P>
<P>
In March, Jackie will be appearing at London's Palladium; in the spring he'll 
tour three or four big U.S. cities and then head back to the Great White Way -- 
again. 
</P>
<P>
FRANK SINATRA'S office confirms that the man will present a hot new talent in 
the coming Sinatra summer concerts in London. The newcomer is Brendan Grace, 
said to be one of Ireland's funniest men but mostly unknown outside his own 
country. 
</P>
<P>
The way it happened: Sinatra was in Dublin for concerts last summer. He asked 
someone to arrange for him to see some Irish artists at a party in a Dublin 
pub. Grace came in with a 20-minute show in which he said at one point, "I 
thought I was entertaining Perry Como." Sinatra laughed like crazy and invited 
Grace to share his stage next July. 
</P>
<P>
THEATER and movie folks are extending love and sympathy to the grand actor Alan 
Bates, who is heartbroken over the death of his son, Tristan. The boy, living 
with his twin brother, Benedick, for modeling assignments in Tokyo, dropped 
dead of a heart attack. He was only 18. Bates and his wife, Victoria, went to 
Japan and took the body back to England.

HALL SAYS NO DEAL TO NEW 'DEAL'

<P>
It's anybody's guess whether game show host Monty Hall is out to beat the clock 
or strike it rich. But apparently the sky's the limit now that he's bowed out 
of a new "Let's Make a Deal." 
</P>
<P>
Hall will not be the host when "Let's Make a Deal," the show he co-created, 
produced and starred in for 4,500 episodes, returns to the NBC daytime schedule 
this summer. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking for new fields to conquer," said Hall, 64. 
</P>
<P>
Hall, who keeps busy doing commercials and making guest appearances, may pop up 
on the show from time to time as a surprise guest. 
</P>
<P>
The new version of the show will originate from the Disney-MGM Studios Theme 
Park in Orlando, Fla. Hall will remain a half-owner of the new version. 
</P>
<P>
A former sportscaster, Hall also has been the host of such shows as "It's 
Anybody's Guess," "Beat the Clock," "Strike It Rich" and "The Sky's the Limit."

Big Ten Commissioner Jim Delany has issued a reprimand and censure order for 
Michigan's basketball player Rumeal Robinson for public statements he made 
about officials after last week's Michigan-Iowa game. 
</P>
<P>
Delany said Robinson broke conference regulations when he criticized referees 
in a postgame news conference after Michigan's 78-76 loss last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman from Delany's office today would not comment on what comments 
Robinson made. 
</P>
<P>
But the Iowa City Press-Citizen on Sunday reported that Robinson complained 
that the game's referees showed preferential treatment to Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone wants to play level basketball, and the referees tilt the game toward 
one team," the Press-Citizen quoted Robinson as saying. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is a sorry league for referees to begin with," Robinson 
continued. "The job they did was poor. They shouldn't even be paid for this." 
</P>
<P>
Michigan interim director of athletics Jack Weidenbach and men's basketball 
coach Steve Fisher reportedly also took disciplinary action against Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Murray, a spokesman at the athletics department in Ann Arbor, Mich., said 
he had no information on the alleged actions.

The University of Illinois basketball program is bracing for a full NCAA 
investigation into its recruiting practices, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe the NCAA has sufficient information to warrant an official 
inquiry," Illinois Athletic Director John Mackovic said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Mackovic said the school has not yet received a letter of official inquiry from 
the NCAA, "but we're preparing for it." 
</P>
<P>
The Chicago Tribune reported in today's editions that the letter is expected to 
arrive at the university next week. 
</P>
<P>
The letter is to include specifics from a preliminary investigation and detail 
alleged violations. 
</P>
<P>
Mackovic said a preliminary university investigation found there were "serious 
matters that are unresolved." 
</P>
<P>
Mackovic also said that freshman center Deon Thomas -- a focus of the NCAA for 
alleged recruiting violations -- will not play this season.

Ramon Ramos, the Portland Trail Blazer who suffered severe head injuries in an

Oregon Health Sciences University hospital said. 
</P>
<P>
"He continues to make progress daily and is doing some things that indicate he 
is making some contact," said spokeswoman Marcia Williams.

Dr. Kim Burchiel, head of neurosurgery for the hospital, said that Ramos is 
progressing as expected and that he thinks Ramos will improve substantially 
over the next month or two.

The rookie forward was injured when his speeding sports car went out of control 
and flipped on an icy portion of Interstate 5 south of Portland on Dec. 16.

Williams said Ramos is not in a full coma, but gives no indication he is aware

Texas-El Paso basketball Coach Don Haskins, still suffering from a severe case 
of laryngitis, said he likely will remain sidelined the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Haskins, nicknamed "The Bear" because of his sideline growl, said his voice has 
improved recently, but he won't return court side because he tends to yell 
during games. 
</P>
<P>
"I even screamed at the TV set," Haskins said, referring to the Miners' road 
loss to Hawaii he watched last week. 
</P>
<P>
Haskins has missed nine games but has attended home practices. Norm Ellenberger 
has been Texas-El Paso's interim coach since Dec. 23. 
</P>
<P>
The Miners are 5-4 during Haskins' absence. 
</P>
<P>
"If something isn't broke, why fix it?" Haskins said. "My presence would change 
things, and that wouldn't be good for our basketball team." 
</P>
<P>
Haskins underwent a biopsy in October, and a doctor determined he had 
laryngitis, which plagued him for a year. 
</P>
<P>
The doctor also said Haskins does not have cancer.

CO-DIRECTORS KEEP KINSHIP ALIVE IN 'PORCH'; 
</P>
<P>
STAGE:RICHARD OLIVIER, SON OF LAURENCE, AND AUTHOR DONALD MACKECHNIE MAKE 
COMMON CAUSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It's OK to ask Richard Olivier about his father, the legendary Laurence 
Olivier. He knows his name evokes curiosity, and he is more than willing to 
talk about "Larry." But at the moment, the 28-year-old Olivier's thoughts are 
fixed on Donald MacKechnie's "Meetin's on the Porch," which he is co-directing 
with the author at the Canon Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
"The characters have literally spent their whole lives in Nebraska," Olivier 
said of the story. "They're sort of extraordinary ordinary people: women 
(played by Susan Clark, Patty Duke and Carrie Snodgress) who have grown and 
lived through the entire century. The play picks them up at four different 
points in their lives -- not in sequential order. First we see them when 
they're 27, just before the Depression. Then in 1917, during the Great War. 
Then in 1985, in the midst of Reaganomics. And finally in 1945 on V-E Day." 
</P>
<P>
The British-born MacKechnie chose American subjects over British women partly 
to distance himself from a too-close subject. "I was trying to write about my 
mother," said the first-time playwright, 51, "but I couldn't get beyond page 
20. So taking it out of Scotland -- where she's from -- was a way of removing 
her. Still, (the character of) Amy is mostly my mother; the other two, Haley 
and Jenny, have bits of her, my two sisters, my former wife . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Acquainted for more than 20 years (through the elder Olivier, for whom 
MacKechnie worked as a director at London's National Theatre), the pair is 
finding this collaboration smooth sailing. 
</P>
<P>
The dual-directorship was originally dictated by logistics: MacKechnie was to 
have been working on a film at the start of rehearsals; Olivier has a job that 
has kept him in Britain since Dec. 28. It has resulted in a mix of styles. 
While MacKechnie believes in letting his players discover for themselves where 
to go and how to say their lines before setting the piece, Olivier doesn't 
believe in setting the blocking and behavior at all. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, the premise is that rather than trying to make theater the same as 
possible every night, and trying to emulate film and television in that way -- 
you should play against that," he said of the technique, used previously in his 
stagings of the Actors Gang's "Out of Sight, Out of Mind" (1983) and Daniel 
Therriault's "Battery" (1986). "Because theater is live, it can be different 
every night. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, the words are always the same, the characters are the same. Much of it 
is set. But the physical moves aren't. The hope is that every night someone 
comes up with a new idea and does something different -- and that changes 
everything. The audience is able to take the play on its own terms. They're not 
having it interpreted for them, having the director say, 'Thou shalt see the 
play this way.' Our job is just to tell the story." 
</P>
<P>
Once something wonderful is found, though, how does it not become set? "We call 
it the shared experience police," he said merrily. "As soon as an actor thinks 
they've found a way, they fight for it, make a space for it, try to get in the 
same position -- and then they're not telling the story anymore. They're trying 
to make a moment, get a laugh. And it's different from everything else going on 
onstage." 
</P>
<P>
The two directors met when Olivier was around 8; MacKechnie has a son the same 
age, and the families vacationed together. Over time, however, they lost touch. 
Olivier followed up UCLA theater productions with a trainee directorship at the 
Northampton Royal Theatre and the Edinburgh Festival, and 2 1/2 years ago 
married a holistic health consultant; their second child is on the way. 
</P>
<P>
MacKechnie, who founded The Little Theater in Norfolk at age 23, went on to 
become artistic director of New York's GeVa Theatre, where he has directed more 
than 50 plays. One night, hearing that Richard was staging "Out of Sight," he 
decided to check it out -- prepared to slip out anonymously if it was awful. 
"But it was a remarkable production," he said. "Rather anarchic, but organized 
anarchy. Shortly after that, Richard read ("Meetin's") and liked it." 
</P>
<P>
MacKechnie believes that Olivier brings a mature theatrical and social savvy to 
the work: "Richard's worked around huge talent since he was a kid. Any other 
28-year old might be intimidated working with (these actresses)." 
</P>
<P>
Or having Lord Laurence Olivier and Joan Plowright as parents? 
</P>
<P>
Olivier believes that choosing directing over acting ("I tried it once, but got 
terrible stage fright") will help stave off comparisons to his father. "Even in 
school, I knew I wanted to direct," he said resolutely. "Then I didn't do it 
for eight years." During the time away, he looked for other interests outside 
the family business, but concluded theater was it for him. "Though one day I'd 
like to direct television, also to write. That's something Larry really wanted 
me to do." 
</P>
<P>
Larry? 
</P>
<P>
He smiled. "When I was 19, going to parties in New York, my mother took me 
aside and said, 'Richard, you're much too big to be calling me Mommy. Would you 
please call me Joan?' So I did -- and started calling Dad, Larry. In 
conversation, they were like deities anyway, not like my parents." Still, the 
"Son-of-Legend" status chafed: "I ran away from England to get away from that, 
went to UCLA. For the first year, everyone called me 'Richard Oliver' -- and I 
was very happy to let them." 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Olivier has come to terms with bearing the name (in a bid for 
anonymity, he once considered changing it, "but I'm proud of who my parents 
are"), including its ability to get him in doors that would otherwise be 
closed. "I've always tried to prepare myself for every job I do. I mean, if 
when I'd come here at 20, somebody had given me a feature film because of my 
name, I'd have fallen on my (rear). But now I'm ready." 
</P>
<P>
And if it takes time, he is willing to hang in there -- on all levels. "I saw a 
magazine that referred to Kirk Douglas as 'Michael Douglas' actor-father. Maybe 
someday I'll read about 'Richard Olivier's actor-father' . . . ."

FOR CONCERT GUITARIST, 'SAMBA RUNS IN YOUR BLOOD'; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: PROPELLED BY THE RHYTHMS OF HIS NATIVE BRAZIL, LAURINDO ALMEIDA 
SUCCESSFULLY COMBINES CLASSICAL AND JAZZ.

<P>
Laurindo Almeida, intent on a memory that seems to be floating just out of 
sight, carefully cradles his guitar while playing the familiar strains of a 
Chopin Etude. 
</P>
<P>
"The first musical sound I heard was my mother playing the piano," the 
72-year-old recalled during a recent interview at his home in the hills above 
Sherman Oaks. "She played little things, like the Chopin, and she played them 
very well. In those days, there was no TV, no radio in Brazil. The piano was 
the only instrument I heard." 
</P>
<P>
Almeida has come a long way from his birthplace in the coastal city of Santos 
near Sao Paulo, Brazil. From his living room, with a commanding view of the San 
Fernando Valley and the San Gabriel Mountains as a backdrop, the longtime 
American citizen explained how the land of his birth has affected his career. 
</P>
<P>
"You come from Brazil, the samba runs in your blood," he said. "You can finish 
playing a bop piece and still feel that rhythm." Successfully combining jazz 
and classical music, Almeida has established himself as one of America's 
principal concert guitarists. His performance last week at Yorba Linda's Forum 
Theater with his wife of almost 20 years, vocal soprano Deltra Eamon, was a 
pleasant combination of classical music, show tunes and jazz numbers -- with 
the rhythms of Brazil serving as an ever-present touchstone. 
</P>
<P>
"What I do is an amalgam. It's a brilliant marriage, like all this has been," 
he said, gesturing toward his wife and around the room. "It doesn't bother me 
at all to be thought of as a jazz guitar player rather than a classical player. 
I'm both, taking from classical and jazz and adding a measure of jazz samba." 
</P>
<P>
Almeida's career has been a long string of successes since his first American 
job with the Stan Kenton Orchestra in 1947. He made landmark, 
Brazilian-influenced recordings with alto saxophonist Bud Shank in the '50s, 
played chamber jazz with the Modern Jazz Quartet and was a founding member of 
the L.A. Four with Shank, Ray Brown and Shelly Manne in the '70s. He was the 
dominant Hollywood studio guitarist during the '50s and '60s, playing for 
hundreds of films ranging from "A Star Is Born" with Judy Garland to "The 
Godfather." 
</P>
<P>
"I just got a list from the union of all the films that I've played in, and 
there were names on that list that I didn't even know that I had done," he 
confessed. "When they bring the music into the studio, they don't always put on 
the titles and sometimes you don't even know what film you are playing for." 
</P>
<P>
The story of how Almeida first picked up the guitar shows the kind of mettle 
that helped carry him out of Brazil and into America. His father had forbidden 
him to play the guitar; maybe that's what made the proposition so attractive to 
the 7-year-old boy. "When my mother turned her back, I grabbed my father's 
guitar and would go into the back yard and see what I could do. Then I would 
bring the guitar back and carefully hang it back on the wall. 
</P>
<P>
"I would play the Chopin that I heard from my mother, other little pieces. It 
wasn't written, I just kept it up here," he said, pointing to his head. 
</P>
<P>
Almeida was playing for radio station orchestras in Sao Paulo by the time he 
was 14. In 1936, he traveled to Europe, playing aboard ship for spending cash. 
In Paris, he met and was duly impressed by Django Reinhardt. He returned to 
Brazil, only to find himself homesick for a place he had never been. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I must have been born in America," he said, "because I missed it and 
had never been there. Isn't that funny?" Actually, it was America's music that 
had stolen Almeida's heart. "I learned about it from jazz charts and 
recordings. I was an avid collector of Fats Waller. I just love his music. Of 
course, I had a lot of things recorded in this country: Mantovani with the big, 
big orchestra, David Rose. . . ." Almeida was enjoying success as a composer 
and soon accumulated enough in royalties to make the move to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
But Brazil continued to figure into his music. 
</P>
<P>
In 1953, he did his series of landmark recordings with sax man Shank (now out 
of print) that preceded Stan Getz and Joao Gilberto's "Jazz Samba" by almost 10 
years. "We were playing bossa nova before the word bossa nova was invented," 
Almeida said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been trying to introduce Brazilian composers to this country ever since 
I've been here," he said, "so (on) every album that I do there's someone you 
haven't heard yet." Supporting this contention, he named a host of Brazilian 
composers such as Radames Gnattali, Pixinguinha and Ernesto Nazareth, whose 
works he has recorded. 
</P>
<P>
His own compositions include an Oscar winner (his score to the short film "The 
Magic Pear Tree"). His "Concerto for Guitar and Orchestra," recorded with the 
Los Angeles Orchestra de Camera, is available on the Concord Concerto label. He 
has arranged untold numbers of classical pieces for guitar -- providing some, 
like Claude Debussy's well-known "Claire de Lune" with a samba beat. 
</P>
<P>
"I love to write and also transcribe," he said. "I do most of my transcriptions 
when I travel on the plane. As soon as the plane takes off, I open my little 
table and start writing. Most of my catalogue was done on the plane." 
</P>
<P>
He still practices four or five hours a day, and does five hundred sets of hand 
exercises before going to bed each night. "Guitar playing is like physical 
work," he said. "You have to practice. You have to keep your hands and muscles 
moving." 
</P>
<P>
 Guitarists Laurindo Almeida, Sharon Isbin and Larry Coryell play Friday at 8 
p.m. at South Coast Community Church, 5120 Bonita Canyon Road, Irvine. Tickets:

INVENTIVE DUO OF TUCK, PATTI EMERGING AS MAJOR PLAYERS OF '90S; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: ALREADY SOLD-OUT DATE AT COACH HOUSE IS INDICATIVE OF THEIR MOMENTUM, 
ALONG WITH NEW RECORDINGS, VIDEO CONCERTS.

<P>
Tuck and Patti, the inventive musical duo from San Francisco, are entering the 
'90s with momentum that seems to be gathering speed almost daily. New 
recordings, a tour to Japan, video concerts and a solo album for Tuck are 
filling their musical plates to overflowing. Friday night and again a week from 
Saturday their busy itinerary calls for stops at the Coach House in San Juan 
Capistrano. Friday's show is already sold out. 
</P>
<P>
It's a nice way to be entering their second decade of work together. Patti 
(whose last name was Catchcart before she married Tuck in 1981) and Tuck 
Andress were stellar performers in San Francisco long before Windham Hill 
released their first album in 1988. In the last two years they have crossed one 
category after another, with Patti's soul-stirring singing and Tuck's 
ambidextrous guitar playing showing up on rock, jazz and easy listening radio 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
"We've experienced a big change in some ways," Tuck said on the phone last 
weekend, "less of a change in others. The biggest, I guess, has been in 
logistics: There's no doubt that your life is much more orderly when you're at 
home and a lot more complicated when you're on the road." 
</P>
<P>
"It all happened so suddenly," he continued, "that it took a little while for 
us to realize what was going on -- to learn how to get by without sleeping, and 
still have enough energy to perform. 
</P>
<P>
"But the way we perform hasn't changed at all. We still work with each other 
with the same enthusiasm and joy that we had when we were a local San Francisco 
act." 
</P>
<P>
Another difference, apart from logistics: The mixed-race couple (Patti is 
black, Tuck is white) now has to deal with the unpredictable hazards of 
visibility outside the familiar environs of the Bay Area. Frequently, they 
encounter listeners who have only heard them on the radio and who are startled 
when they first see them. 
</P>
<P>
"It's never been a problem for us," said Patti. "But since we still live in a 
racist world, there are other people who do have a problem with us as a duo, 
and as a couple." 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't experienced a lot of the overt stuff," added Tuck, "like the hotel 
owner who says he can't book us because of his clients. But it's there, just 
beneath the surface." 
</P>
<P>
"And you don't have to go to the South to experience it," Patti said. 
</P>
<P>
There's an upside to it, though. "In our relationship," Tuck said, "we don't 
think about race. And that's true of our music, too. But the fact that we stand 
up there -- a male and female, black and white, married -- is a kind of 
statement in itself. Hopefully it's the kind of gentle statement that can make 
a quiet but effective point about acceptance and understanding." 
</P>
<P>
But back to those problems of life on the road: In the last year, Tuck and 
Patti have been home an average of only a few days a month. With most touring 
music groups the social dynamics shift and change as they travel from place to 
place. In a duo, there is a single social dynamic -- one on one. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, we've had to get our communications skills together, you can be sure about 
that," said Tuck. "But it can get really crazy, and the only solution is 
absolute honesty about our feelings." 
</P>
<P>
"When people get our contracts," laughed Patti, "they sometimes say, 'There's 
only two of you; why do you have to have two hotel rooms?' They don't realize 
that we sometimes need that space in order to keep ourselves sane. 
</P>
<P>
"We're committed to each other, and we love each other a great deal, but we 
also respect each other's boundaries. Neither of us gets what we want all the 
time and, hey, sometimes the only solution is just to start yelling. And we do 
that, too." 
</P>
<P>
With a Japanese tour looming in the next few months, possible television deals 
in the works and a new recording to plan, the pair are going to be spending a 
lot more time in hotel rooms. 
</P>
<P>
"No problem," said Tuck. "All the time we spend together gives us a chance to 
work on our relationship. One thing's for sure: It's helped us to get real good 
at being Tuck and Patti." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuck and Patti play Friday and Feb. 3 at 9 p.m. at Coach House, 33157 Camino 
Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. Friday's show is sold out; tickets for Feb. 3 
are $15. Information: (714) 496-8930.

ANDERSON IS FINALLY IN CHARGE; 
</P>
<P>
OREGON STATE: AFTER 27 YEARS AS AN ASSISTANT COACH, HE STEPPED ACROSS THE HALL. 
HE HAS THE BEAVERS ATOP THE PAC-10.

<TEXT>
<P>
Jim Anderson had a full head of hair when he arrived at Oregon State in 1956 to 
play basketball for Slats Gill, the Beavers' legendary former coach. 
</P>
<P>
But time flies and so, apparently, does hair. Anderson, 52, was almost as bald 
as a basketball by the time he became head coach this season. 
</P>
<P>
But Anderson said it was worth the wait, which included a 19-year 
apprenticeship as Ralph Miller's assistant and three years working for Gill and 
five for Paul Valenti. 
</P>
<P>
The Beavers have flourished under Anderson, ranking 17th in the Associated 
Press poll after winning 14 of 16 games, one of them a 23-point victory over 
Arizona, then No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Has the transition been easy? 
</P>
<P>
"It's just like going from one room to the next," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Anderson was reluctant to move across the hall and into Miller's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
"He was used to going into the assistant coaches' office, and we couldn't get 
him trained to go into his new office," said Anne Harper, longtime Oregon State 
basketball secretary. "He kept saying it was Ralph's office. We finally have 
him headed in the right direction, like an old horse going into his stall. 
</P>
<P>
"He'd come in and he'd get clear to the doorway before he'd realize that he was 
in the wrong office. He didn't like being in there for a long time. He felt 
like he was out of the mainstream because he couldn't yell at me." 
</P>
<P>
Although the decor -- orange and black, featuring a stuffed beaver -- is 
unchanged from Miller's 19-year tenure, Anderson has hung pictures of Miller, 
Gill and Valenti, his predecessors, behind his desk. But he is most proud of 
the autographed pictures of actresses Jill Clayburgh, Barbra Streisand, Faye 
Dunaway and Dyan Cannon, who wrote, "I'd sit on your bench any time." 
</P>
<P>
The reviews from Anderson's players are just as enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
They say they feel less restricted under Anderson than they did under Miller. 
</P>
<P>
"We just have more freedom to do whatever we want," said Gary Payton, the 
Beavers' All-American guard. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Knox, a former Oregon State guard, said Anderson is more direct with the 
players. 
</P>
<P>
"Playing for Coach Miller, you never knew where you stood with him," Knox said. 
"He was a very demanding coach, and he never gave out many compliments. But you 
always know where you stand with Coach Anderson. If you play good, he's quick 
to compliment you, and if you play bad, he's quick to get on your behind." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson also has won supporters in the OSU family. 
</P>
<P>
"Jimmy's done an outstanding job," said Dee Andros, former athletic director 
and now an assistant director of the booster club. "I couldn't have been more 
pleased (than) when Jimmy was named head coach because he's not only a great 
Beaver, he's a great coach. 
</P>
<P>
"He served his time. I think it would have been a real injustice if he hadn't 
gotten the job. He's taken a bunch of good athletes and molded them into a 
unit." 
</P>
<P>
Although Anderson has retained Miller's system of pressure basketball, he has 
made some cosmetic changes. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson outfitted the Beavers in new road uniforms. A traditionalist, 
Anderson's new uniforms resemble those the Beavers wore in the late 1950s, when 
he played. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike John Wooden, who was an almost constant presence at Pauley Pavilion 
after he retired at UCLA, Miller has kept a low profile, having attended just 
two games this season. Miller spends his time at his home on Black Butte Ranch 
in the Oregon Cascades. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I could be much more of a disservice to Jimmy and the group if I was 
around all the time," Miller told the Eugene Register-Guard. "I have all the 
confidence in the world in Jimmy. He knows what he's trying to do on offense 
and defense. He doesn't need me for anything." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson also has a higher profile than he did in his assistant days. Besides a 
weekly press conference, he has a weekly radio-TV show and is a featured 
speaker at weekly Beaver Huddle meetings, addressing boosters. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Jimmy is great," said Tass Morrison, an Oregon State alumnus and 
booster. "He has wonderful leadership skills and obviously he has excellent 
coaching skills. He's doing a phenomenal job in his first year as a coach. I'm 
not sure any of us are shocked, but we're very proud of his accomplishments for 
a first-year head coach." 
</P>
<P>
Waiting Is the Hard Part 
</P>
<P>
"Are you nervous Jimmy?" Fifi Anderson asked her husband as he got dressed 
before his first game. 
</P>
<P>
"No," he replied. 
</P>
<P>
"Then why are you wearing a tie with no shirt?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
That was one of the few mistakes he has made. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon State leads the Pac-10 with a 7-0 conference record heading into 
tonight's game against USC at the Sports Arena. The Beavers have won nine in a 
row. 
</P>
<P>
"It's thrilling to get off to such a good start," Anderson said. "But when 
you've been around for as long as I have, you know how quickly things can 
change. I want to enjoy it while I can." 
</P>
<P>
Much of the framework was waiting for Anderson, who inherited four starters. 
One of them was Payton, who decided to return for his senior season instead of 
making himself eligible for the NBA draft. Payton, who took out a 
million-dollar insurance policy to protect his basketball future, is projected 
as a lottery pick in draft this spring. 
</P>
<P>
Can the Beavers continue winning after Payton graduates? 
</P>
<P>
Anderson has stockpiled several talented recruits, including forward Mario 
Jackson, a transfer from Northern Idaho Junior College who is red-shirting this 
season. An extraordinary jumper, Jackson can touch the rim with his elbows. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson had an intense bench demeanor as an assistant, but he has been a lot 
calmer as a coach. Unlike Miller, a notorious referee-baiter, Anderson doesn't 
yell at officials. 
</P>
<P>
"Ralph demanded and Jimmy pleads our case," said Michael Sandago, OSU trainer. 
"Ralph assumed that referees saw it the way he saw it but didn't call it. Jimmy 
pleads our case." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson spent most of his life preparing for his new job. 
</P>
<P>
A 5-foot 10-inch, 135-pound guard, he transferred from Grays Harbor Junior 
College in Washington to Oregon State in 1956 and played on the Beavers' 
1957-58 team that won the Pacific Coast Conference co-championship. 
</P>
<P>
After graduating in 1959, Anderson coached the freshman team for three years 
while getting his master's degree in physical education. Anderson's players 
included Mel Counts, who later played for the Lakers; and Terry Baker, who 
later won the Heisman Trophy. 
</P>
<P>
After marrying Fifi, his college sweetheart -- on a basketball court, no less 
-- he left OSU in 1963 and took a high school coaching job. He had made just 
$500 in three years of coaching at OSU. 
</P>
<P>
But when Valenti replaced Gill in 1965, he hired Anderson as an assistant. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson then applied for the head coaching job when Valenti resigned in 1970, 
but OSU hired Miller from Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
Although Anderson had several offers to become a head coach, he remained at OSU 
as Miller's assistant for 19 seasons. He has strong ties to the school. His 
wife attended OSU as did three of his four children. The family house is only a 
block from the campus. 
</P>
<P>
Because of his love for his alma mater, Anderson never considered leaving. 
</P>
<P>
"Jim's not a big ego person," Fifi Anderson said. "Jim doesn't need to be a big 
shot. He loves Oregon State more than anything. He always said that being an 
assistant here is the best job in the country. I think he always hoped he'd be 
the head coach, but he was satisfied being an assistant. He loves Corvallis." 
</P>
<P>
Quipped USC Coach George Raveling: "Jimmy must have seen something in Corvallis 
that the rest of us didn't." 
</P>
<P>
In any event, Anderson's persistence paid off in 1987 when OSU officials 
announced that Anderson would replace Miller in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"He just moved right into this job like it was built for him," said Valenti, 
now an administrative assistant in the athletic department. "He bleeds orange 
and black." 
</P>
<P>
Why did OSU make the announcement two years early? 
</P>
<P>
"First, we didn't want any speculation as to who would follow Ralph," said Lynn 
Snyder, OSU athletic director. "And we felt if we did it early, it would 
enhance recruiting. If we hadn't made the announcement we might have 
struggled." 
</P>
<P>
The Beavers haven't struggled.

The Dawn of the Anderson Era 
</P>
<P>
When Anderson arrived for his first practice on Oct. 15, he did a double take. 
</P>
<P>
Cliff Robinson and C. E. Newton, retirees who attend every OSU basketball 
practice, had a table set up on the sidelines with sparking cider to usher in 
the Anderson era. Robinson and Newton were dressed in formal wear and had the 
table set with fine china. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to do something kind of goofy," Newton said. "We read where the 
University of Kentucky had 15,000 people at midnight for their first practice. 
So we said, 'Why shouldn't we do something for Jimmy?' " 
</P>
<P>
Robinson, 68, and Newton, 81, have orange and black business cards proclaiming 
themselves Senior Executive Assistant Consultant-Adviser-Experts for Oregon 
State basketball. They attend every practice and see the team off on trips and 
meet them when they return. 
</P>
<P>
Newton and Robinson said Anderson is doing a good job. 
</P>
<P>
"Jimmy has got some different drills and we're both kind of pleased," Newton 
said. "We were big fans of Ralph Miller, and we think Jimmy's doing a great 
job." 
</P>
<P>
But where Miller used to talk with Newton and Robinson during practice, 
Anderson is all business. 
</P>
<P>
Miller gave Anderson, his chief assistant, a major role in running practice. 
Anderson and the other assistants conducted practice while Miller watched from 
a seat at midcourt, chain-smoking cigarettes and sipping coffee. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest difference between Coach Miller and Coach Anderson is that's 
there's less smoke in the gym," Payton said.
