DITCH PROPOSAL LATEST OF MANY TO PLUG BORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
First, federal officials said a simple fence would do the job. Then, a San 
Diego congressman suggested National Guard troops were the answer. Now, a 
5-foot-deep ditch is being billed as the antidote for illegal immigration and 
drug smuggling across the U. S.-Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
Andrea Skorepa, for one, wonders what's next. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe they should try deploying 'Star Wars' here and see if that does the 
trick," said Skorepa, a San Ysidro resident and chairwoman of Mayor Maureen 
O'Connor's Latino Advisory Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Skorepa's comments Wednesday typified much of the community reaction that has 
greeted the federal government's proposal to dig a 4 1/2-mile-long ditch along 
the border near the Otay Mesa Port of Entry. Weary of watching federal 
officials propose what they labeled as expensive, impractical solutions to the 
multifaceted problem of illegal immigration, these critics seemed to be sending 
a clear message to boosters of this latest idea: Ditch the ditch. 
</P>
<P>
Still, in other corners, the proposal found favor. San Diego's congressional 
delegation, for example, generally supported the ditch concept, but questioned 
details of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to do something to take control of our own border, and it probably is 
going to take some kind of physical barrier to do that," Rep. Ron Packard 
(R-Carlsbad) said. 
</P>
<P>
Backers of the ditch say it would serve as an effective deterrent to the stream 
of vehicles that smuggle Mexicans and other Latin Americans and drugs across 
the porous Tijuana-San Diego border, which is considered the most popular 
crossing area along the 1,900-mile boundary. 
</P>
<P>
But many of those interviewed Wednesday said that erecting physical obstacles 
will not stem the aliens marching north. Ingenuity and a desire for a better 
life, they predicted, will overcome the highest wall and the deepest ditch. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care if it's a river, a lake, a fence, or a ditch, these people are 
going to get across," said Mirna L. Perez, chairwoman of the San Ysidro 
Planning and Development Group. "Probably in the beginning, this ditch will 
cause a little inconvenience. But, ultimately, they'd put in ladders or bridges 
or whatever it took, and they would conquer it." 
</P>
<P>
"Before long, we'd be seeing all-terrain vehicles in there," said Paul Ganster, 
director of San Diego State University's Institute for Regional Studies of the 
Californias. He was only half-joking. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Local Officials Left Out 
</P>
<P>
Besides the proposal's practical defects, many local critics greeted it coolly 
because they were excluded from the planning and only learned of the idea when 
The Times disclosed it in an article Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the mayor, for example, said O'Connor had been in the dark 
until reading the newspaper account. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody from the federal government has contacted this office about the 
proposal," Paul Downey said. O'Connor "has some questions as to how effective a 
deterrent this could be and whether this is the direction we should be going. 
We're surprised that somebody did not notify us ahead of time or seek our 
input." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Councilman Bob Filner, whose district encompasses the border, voiced 
a stronger opinion. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe they would get this far without talking to people in the city. 
I find that disrespectful to the local political process. I feel insulted by 
that as a city representative." 
</P>
<P>
Skorepa agreed, and noted that it's not the first time federal officials have 
plowed ahead with a project without consulting those most affected by it. 
</P>
<P>
"They have never included local people in their plans," Skorepa said. "It's 
this attitude that the federal government knows best and, therefore, we 
shouldn't have a say." 
</P>
<P>
Others said they sympathize with the desire to reduce smuggling but fear a 
ditch or other divider might damage San Diego's relationship with its southern 
neighbor -- a relationship that local business and political leaders have 
nurtured carefully in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Intelligent Answers Sought 
</P>
<P>
"We're in favor of . . . smart ways to try to curb the flow, providing that 
they do not upset our relationships with Mexico," said attorney David Dolkas, 
president of the Otay Mesa Chamber of Commerce. "A ditch or other soft-scape 
barrier might work. We certainly do not want any sort of Berlin Wall down 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Filner was more outspoken. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds like we're trying to protect ourselves with a moat. We've got 
20th-Century problems, not medieval problems. . . . A moat is not a respectful 
posture toward Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
Despite such reservations, some officials solidly endorsed the proposal. 
Several San Diego congressmen, in particular, argued that any criticism of the 
ditch or other barrier on symbolic grounds overlooks the fact that it would be 
intended primarily to stem illegal border crossings by drug smugglers. 
</P>
<P>
"This is no Berlin Wall with gun turrets, no moat with piranhas and 
crocodiles," said Rep. Bill Lowery (R-San Diego). "We still have the most 
liberal policies on Earth for legally crossing the border. This would be a 
passive barrier to help control this hemorrhage of illegal drugs along the 
border. Remember that a vehicle or plane that flies hundreds of pounds of 
cocaine into this country could just as easily insert a Libyan hit team here." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Charge $1 a Car to Cross 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego), though supporting the concept, described the 
ditch plan as only an "incomplete remedy" for border problems. The long-range 
impact of those problems, he argues, could be better addressed by legislation 
he plans to introduce next month calling for border-crossing user fees of $1 a 
car and 25 cents for people who cross on foot. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue generated by the fees would be split between the federal and local 
governments, with the federal share to be directed at programs to enhance 
border security and to reduce the waiting time at border checkpoints. Cities' 
share, Bates explained, could help fund programs in communities directly 
affected by border affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a way we can address problems with legitimate crossings while also 
getting the money needed to do something about illegal entries," Bates said. 
</P>
<P>
The ditch proposal is only the latest in a long-running series of suggested 
ways to interrupt smuggling into the United States. The ideas, ranging from 
fences to the deployment of high-tech sensing devices, have invariably been 
controversial among local residents and Latino activists. 
</P>
<P>
In June, 1986, Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Coronado) proposed that National Guard 
troops be stationed along the border to deter drug trafficking. Although that 
idea was condemned as extreme and dangerous, a bill later sponsored by Hunter 
led to the use of military planes to help the Border Patrol detect illegal 
border crossings by aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to enhance border security, Hunter has also suggested using the National 
Guard to inspect all cargo containers entering this country for illegal drugs 
-- in particular, cocaine. Because of a lack of manpower, Customs agents now 
typically inspect only about 4% of the packages coming into the United States, 
Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concrete Barriers Rejected 
</P>
<P>
Another interdiction plan surfaced in February, 1987, when U.S. immigration 
officials proposed concrete barricades along the terrain dividing Tijuana and 
San Diego. That idea, criticized by those who say border fortification is a 
hostile gesture toward Mexico and a waste of taxpayer money, was never 
implemented. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, various task forces and committees -- involving immigration 
authorities, business people and politicians -- have searched for years for 
palatable deterrents, but to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
"One idea we talked about was defensive landscaping -- like cactus or 
bougainvillea -- that people wouldn't want to get tangled up in," said Mike 
Stang, a San Diego city planner who served on the Border Corridor Subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
That panel also considered placing boulders and rocks at strategic spots along 
the border and debated the construction of low, freeway median-style barriers 
impassable to cars.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: EL CAJON

<TEXT>
<P>
Police are investigating the circumstance surrounding the death of a 2 
1/2-year-old boy. 
</P>
<P>
The body of Christopher James Swanson was found at 4:45 p.m. Tuesday in a bed 
at the Ha'Penny Inn, 1549 Main St., by someone visiting the child's parents, 
said Lt. Bob Lein of the El Cajon Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the parents, George Christopher Swanson and Marilyn Galloway, both 
34, were living at the motel. 
</P>
<P>
The child was believed to have been dead for at least an hour before 
authorities were called, Lein said. "It was our understanding," he said, "that 
nobody had checked on the baby since 10 a.m." 
</P>
<P>
A desk clerk at the inn said she believed the baby had been taken to a hospital 
the night before and was on medication. 
</P>
<P>
Police questioned the parents but made no arrests. Lein said police will submit 
information regarding possible charges of child neglect to the district 
attorney's office by early next week. 
</P>
<P>
An autopsy is pending, but a spokesman for the coroner's office said the baby 
appeared to have died of respiratory failure.

A 20-year-old man who killed his best friend was sentenced Wednesday to six 
years in the custody of the California Youth Authority. 
</P>
<P>
Simon James Oakes was 19 when he fatally shot Daniel Fripp, 22, on March 6 in 
Oakes' parents' home. Oaks pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Superior Court Judge Bernard Revak said Oakes' sentencing was very 
difficult to decide. The judge could have sentenced him to 11 years in state 
prison or put him on probation. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses called by the defense said Fripp was not welcome in the Oakes home 
and had used methamphetamine with James Oakes before. 
</P>
<P>
The judge said that he does not believe Oakes is a danger to society and that 
the shooting was an isolated event. 
</P>
<P>
Revak allowed Oakes to remain free until Monday because Oakes has a college 
exam to take Friday.

A 25-year-old man who is a suspect in several killings was sentenced Wednesday 
to state prison for the attempted murder of a prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
Blake Taylor, who prosecutors say may be linked to several slayings of 
prostitutes in North County, was sentenced by San Diego Superior Court Judge 
Charles Hayes to nine years to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor was found guilty by a jury Dec. 13 of attempted murder, assault with a 
deadly weapon, and false imprisonment involving Irene (Jade) Quinland, 42. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor testified at his trial that he pulled a gun on Quinland after he picked 
her up on El Cajon Boulevard, but said he only did so to retrieve his $40, 
because he had changed his mind about having sex with her. 
</P>
<P>
"He was going to kill me. I knew he was. I didn't lie about that," Quinland 
testified at the sentencing hearing. 
</P>
<P>
During the trial, Quinland testified that Taylor demanded that she beg for her 
life while he pointed a gun at her in his car.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: RAMONA

<TEXT>
<P>
A 43-year-old man was ordered Wednesday to stand trial on 238 criminal counts 
in connection with the molestation of six girls. It is the most extensive case 
in county history. 
</P>
<P>
After a three-day preliminary hearing in San Diego Municipal Court, Ezra Adams, 
43, was ordered to appear in San Diego Superior Court on Feb. 8 for arraignment 
and trial setting. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Judge Richard Hanscom dismissed one count, saying the prosecution 
failed to present any evidence to support it. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Aaron Katz unsuccessfully tried to get Adams' bail increased 
from $500,000 to $1 million. In declining to grant the increase, Hanscom said 
that Adams is unlikely to make bail even at $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
The last witness during the preliminary hearing was a 17-year-old girl who 
cried often and appeared frightened. She held her hand at the side of her face 
constantly to avoid looking at Adams. 
</P>
<P>
She said the molestation occurred over a period of years. "He told me he would 
hurt me or kill me if I said anything," she testified. 
</P>
<P>
Several recesses were called so the girl could collect her thoughts and regain 
her composure. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing was closed to the press and public Tuesday and most of Monday, on a 
motion by Katz. He said it was too traumatic for four witnesses, all under 14, 
to testify in open court. 
</P>
<P>
Adams, a heavy machinery operator, was arrested Nov. 15.

PART OF SCHOOL PLAYGROUND CLOSED BECAUSE OF LEAKING GAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Part of the playground at Bell Junior High School in Paradise Hills has been 
closed because of leaking methane gas, officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas Adams, safety coordinator for the San Diego Unified School District, 
said the leakage poses no immediate hazard to students or nearby residents but 
that the county will continue to monitor the playground and neighboring areas 
indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
The site of the school, at 620 S. Briarwood in East San Diego, was used for a 
sanitary landfill from 1963-66, Adams said, and, from time to time since the 
school's opening in 1967, "people have noticed a BO smell." 
</P>
<P>
"That's the odor caused by the deterioration of organic matter underneath the 
ground," he said. "As that decomposes, gases are released; that includes 
methane gas. 
</P>
<P>
"Methane can't be smelled, but, as it's being released, it forms in pockets and 
can become an explosive hazard," Adams said. "If the levels become high enough, 
yes, it can explode." 
</P>
<P>
Adams said the explosive limit of methane is considered to be 40,000 parts per 
million. District and county officials became alarmed Friday after a methane 
reading of 65,000 parts per million was recorded on the lower playground. Until 
then, the highest reading recorded in the area was 1,200 ppm, Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
"In a wide-open area where there's constant air movement, there's not much 
chance of an explosion," he said, adding that county air-pollution control 
engineers are now in charge of supervising and patrolling the site. "We're 
concerned that in homes or nearby buildings," pockets of methane might reach 
explosive limits, he said. "But, at the moment, we're not picking up detectable 
levels." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Kotnik, vice principal of 2,400-student Bell, which includes grades seven 
through nine, said coaches and students had complained recently of odors 
emanating from the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Only the lower playground was closed Friday, and all other areas of the school 
remain open, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The county was getting inconsistent results in tests conducted last week," 
Kotnik said. "They should get more information in the next two weeks. It's 
definitely their problem. It's not a city schools problem. We don't feel 
there's any real concern on the part of students or staff." 
</P>
<P>
Asked why the school was built on a landfill site, Adams said, "That's the 
question, but one I can't answer." 
</P>
<P>
He explained that methane forms as heat is generated inside the underground 
landfill. The heat intensifies with the growth of bacteria, and rain 
accelerates that growth, causing the methane to seep up through the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Meters have been in place around the school to alert officials if gas 
concentrations become high enough to trigger an explosion, Adams said. He said 
that the county hopes to hire a consultant to propose a system to extract and 
burn off the methane, and that the system could be in place by summer.

WE NEED A VISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Twenty years ago the United States threw massive amounts of money and manpower 
at Vietnam without having a clear goal of what the nation wanted to achieve in 
Southeast Asia. Today the state of California is in danger of doing the same 
thing with transportation. 
</P>
<P>
Dealing with growth is the state's most complex and perplexing problem. But 
California will forfeit the best opportunity of managing its future if the 
state pours new billions into more freeways without a clear idea of where it 
wants to go. This reality is beginning to strike close to the office of Gov. 
George Deukmejian, and there are hopeful signs that it is penetrating the inner 
sanctum of the governor's office. 
</P>
<P>
In a breakfast interview with The Times' Sacramento bureau the other day, state 
Transportation Director Robert K. Best acknowledged: "We don't have a clear 
vision about how to deal with transportation." 
</P>
<P>
The state now spends about $1.5 billion a year on transportation, without a 
real transportation plan. What passes for a plan now is the state 
Transportation Commission's five-year state Transportation Improvement Program, 
which essentially is a wish list of individual projects stapled together by 
local governments with little assurance that any one project will connect with 
any other. Best is absolutely correct when he says that California must turn 
this process on its ear by asking first this question: "What is it that we 
think we ought to be trying to achieve?" 
</P>
<P>
Last year Assemblywoman Delaine Eastin (D-Union City) sought a modest first 
step in achieving what Best says should be done. She sponsored a bill to create 
a 22-member Blue-Ribbon Transportation Commission to assess California's 
highway and transit needs between now and the year 2010. The commission, on an 
advisory basis only, was to develop a transportation strategy and study ways to 
finance it. The bill passed both the Assembly and the Senate only to be vetoed 
by the governor. As for financing, Deukmejian has indicated a willingness to 
consider a gasoline-tax increase, whereas last year he insisted that additional 
highway funding come from a bond issue. But Deukmejian's bond proposal was 
defeated at the polls. Competing gasoline-tax measures have been introduced in 
both the Senate and the Assembly, and the governor has summoned a 
transportation finance summit meeting in Sacramento on Feb. 8. Deukmejian 
invited 27 representatives of all segments of the transportation industry to 
participate. Presumably, some compromise gasoline-tax plan will emerge this 
summer, either with or without a statewide vote in the June, 1990, primary 
election. 
</P>
<P>
But just as important is that the state begin a process that attempts to 
envision what patterns growth will take in the next 20 or 30 years and how that 
growth can be affected or channeled through development of a transportation 
system. 
</P>
<P>
Someone needs to devise the sort of long-range strategy envisioned by Eastin's 
legislation of last year. Which areas might better be served by light rail 
lines or commuter railroads? In what areas might transportation planning be 
used as a tool to discourage development because of environmental and other 
considerations? Factored into this thinking should be ideas like Deukmejian's 
suggestion that truck traffic be restricted during rush hours, enhanced 
car-pooling, altered work hours, and working at home on some days by means of 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
There are reports that Best is about to take on such an effort in his own 
office in conjunction with the state's regional planning agencies like the 
Southern California Assn. of Governments. If so, and if it has the support of 
the governor, this effort has a potential of being one of the most important 
initiatives to emerge from the Deukmejian Administration. California might yet 
have hopes of salvaging a future in which it is possible to get from here to 
there -- and on time.

Amazing! Baker, a professor of political science from Rutgers University, can 
devote most of two columns to the puzzling contrast between President Reagan's 
great popularity and his meager program accomplishments without once mentioning 
the bias of that prism that largely defines the American people's perception of 
political reality, i.e., our corporate warfare state's own corporate mass media 
of communications.

INAUGURATION

<TEXT>
<P>
It's hard to believe that this is a democracy. Watching the activities and 
ceremonies in Washington it seemed more like a coronation than a mere result of 
a presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, there were shootings and riots in Miami, children shot in a 
California school by a madman who was able to buy a gun without any trouble, 
and the homeless in Washington fed scraps from the presidential feast. 
</P>
<P>
Outgoing President Ronald Reagan says we are celebrating "a successful 
revolution" of "200 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Once again, Reagan has things backward, I think. I doubt whether our Founding 
Fathers, who objected to the ostentatious life style of King George, would have 
fought a revolution in order to emulate his hoopla in every election to a 
four-year term of office. 
</P>
<P>
I doubt whether they would have fought a revolution if "success" meant the 
presidency would bring back the power and trappings of royalty.

THE GREAT BANK ROBBERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush is thinking about having depositors help finance the bailout of 
insolvent savings-and-loan institutions by imposing a special tax on their 
accounts. White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater describes the idea as 
only a trial balloon for now. If so, it's one that public opposition ought 
quickly to puncture. The notion of levying a direct tax on savers to repair the 
damage caused by the mistakes and corruption of certain bankers and the 
regulatory laxity of the federal government makes as much sense as taxing 
members of the armed forces to pay for cost overruns and fraud in the defense 
industry. Savers didn't create the S&amp;L mess; they shouldn't have to pay 
more than others to clean it up. 
</P>
<P>
There's no question, of course, that a lot of money will have to come from 
somewhere to cover the costs of closing down sick S&amp;Ls and paying off their 
federally insured depositors. Over the next three or four years the price tag 
for that could reach $70 billion or more. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady 
says that under consideration is a 25-cent tax on each $100 on deposit in any 
federally insured financial institution -- banks and credit unions as well as 
S&amp;Ls. But why punish savers for the imprudence that pushed hundreds of 
S&amp;Ls into insolvency? Fairness aside, such a tax -- the Administration 
prefers calling it a premium or fee -- could be counted on to launch a flight 
of deposits from these institutions into uninsured money-market mutual funds, 
Treasury bills and other investments. 
</P>
<P>
Three things are clear in the S&amp;L mess: The word of the government -- its 
full faith and credit -- requires protecting depositors against losses of up to 
$100,000 per account. Since there's not enough money in the insurance plan set 
up for that purpose, the rescue effort will realistically have to be financed 
out of general funds, which is another reason why tax increases of some kind 
are rapidly becoming unavoidable. Finally, federal oversight of the S&amp;L 
industry, which has grown sloppy since deregulation came in the late 1970s, 
must be expanded and improved so that problem loans, bad administration and 
crooked managers can be spotted earlier. 
</P>
<P>
These are the things that put the industry into such deep trouble. Savers who 
trustingly put their money into government-insured S&amp;L accounts had nothing 
to do with it.

OUR FAILURE TO VALUE EDUCATION 
</P>

<TEXT>

Thompson's column paints a vivid picture of what he thinks American society is 
like in respect to "intellectual pursuits." Unfortunately, his views are quite 
valid. Having been born and raised in this society and having recently 
graduated from high school, I can reflect upon the times I had a tendency to 
settle for something average when I could have striven for more. This is the 
attitude that limits many people's potential for higher achievement and is, as 
Thompson states, a contributing factor to the "educational depression" in the 
United States. I am in complete accordance with his view that these present 
attitudes of settling for less than what can actually be achieved will 
ultimately affect the United States' position in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Schools today are emphasizing students' grades and SAT scores too much rather 
than students' actual knowledge in particular areas. One place to start in 
solving this problem is in college admissions criteria. Colleges should not 
accept students solely based on grade-point averages, but by their attempts at 
more challenging courses and extracurricular activities. High schools can 
contribute to this solution by giving extra grade points to students who take 
the more rigorous courses. However, it ultimately depends on the student. 
</P>

Stanley Thompson Jr. -- I hear your plea to defeat ignorance! It is one that I 
have also made. I'll spread the word.

TRANSIT ROUTE STUDY HALTED AT LEAST 1 MONTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES QUINN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A study of proposed San Fernando Valley rail routes was halted Wednesday for at 
least a month amid indications that county transit officials might drop a 
controversial proposal for a ground-level rail line between North Hollywood and 
Warner Center. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Transportation Commission, which had been expected to 
re-approve the four route options it selected in September, instead voted 
unanimously to send the question of what type of Valley line to build and where 
to build it back to its Transit Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The action pleased several elected officials who oppose any ground-level line 
in residential neighborhoods, but it did little to mollify homeowner 
representatives who have been fighting to keep any rail line out of their 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Study Authorized 
</P>
<P>
In September, the commission authorized a $2.1-million study that included a 
controversial plan to build a light-rail line in a shallow trench along a 
Southern Pacific railroad right of way that roughly parallels Chandler and 
Victory boulevards from the Metro Rail subway's northern terminus in North 
Hollywood to Warner Center. 
</P>
<P>
Two other alternatives in the study also follow the Chandler-Victory route. 
They are extension of Metro Rail underground all the way to Warner Center and a 
combination of subway and ground-level rail that could either be a heavy-rail 
Metro Rail system or a light-rail trolley. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth option is extension of the downtown-to-North Hollywood subway on 
elevated tracks along the Ventura Freeway from Universal City to Warner Center. 
</P>
<P>
Before the commission Wednesday was a letter from the Los Angeles City 
Council's chief legislative analyst arguing that the commission's vote in 
September misinterpreted the council's wishes on route options. 
</P>
<P>
To the surprise of commissioners, the commission staff endorsed the legislative 
analyst's position on routes that should be studied. 
</P>
<P>
The council wants any line along the Burbank-Chandler route to be completely 
underground to protect residences along the line, said Daniel Beal, who 
represented the chief legislative analyst's office at the session, although the 
trench could be open on top. 
</P>
<P>
"And the council never asked that the Burbank line be all-subway," he added. 
"That would be unrealistically expensive." 
</P>
<P>
Beal said the council also wants a less expensive light-rail system along the 
Ventura Freeway to be studied in addition to the Metro Rail extension the 
commission authorized in September. 
</P>
<P>
While the commission, which is building a countywide network of rail lines, has 
the final say in route selection, it traditionally defers to council members on 
lines within city borders. 
</P>
<P>
Julie Fine, who heads a West Valley group fighting to keep any rail line from 
the segment of the Southern Pacific tracks that parallels Topham Street in 
Tarzana, applauded the move to drop the ground-level rail option but added that 
stations serving an underground system "would still bring noise and congestion 
to our quiet neighborhood."

INGLEWOOD EX-PRINCIPAL'S FATE TO BE DETERMINED IN NEW VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Inglewood school board members reversed themselves this week and voted to 
demote rather than fire a former high school principal accused of embezzling 
school funds. 
</P>
<P>
But that 2-1 vote was illegal because two of the five board members had left 
Monday's school board meeting and three votes are required to approve an 
action, officials said Wednesday. At the recommendation of lawyers for the Los 
Angeles County Counsel, a special meeting has been scheduled for this afternoon 
to consider once again Supt. George McKenna's recommendation to demote rather 
than fire Leonard Matthews, the former principal of Hillcrest High School. 
</P>
<P>
Matthews diverted at least $4,000 from employee paychecks, a school store and 
private donations to his personal use while he was principal of Hillcrest High 
School, according to a sworn statement by police investigators. A yearlong 
investigation found that Matthews used school money for personal expenses, 
including clothes, cosmetics and an outdoor Nativity set, according to the 
affidavit. The case has been turned over to the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
In October, the school board voted to initiate dismissal proceedings against 
Matthews, who had been reassigned to work as a central office administrator 
when investigations by police and the district began late in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Demotion Instead 
</P>
<P>
This week, however, board members voted to rescind the dismissal action. 
Instead, they voted to demote Matthews from his $55,000-a-year administrative 
post to an unspecified teaching position paying $42,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Board members Larry Aubry and Joseph Rouzan voted in favor of rescinding the 
decision to dismiss Matthews. Board members Caroline Coleman and Lois Hill-Hale 
left the meeting early but expressed support for demoting rather than firing 
Matthews. 
</P>
<P>
Zyra McCloud, the only board member who opposed the decision to drop dismissal 
proceedings, complained that other board members were being lenient with 
Matthews because he had worked on their political campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
The district has evidence that about $10,000 was misspent and Matthews has 
agreed to pay that amount in restitution, board members said. 
</P>
<P>
Matthews had no comment Monday evening, when his attorney met with school 
district attorneys before the board meeting. His attorney, Carl Douglas, also 
had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
Consulted by a reporter on the legality of the 2-1 vote, County Atty. Edward 
Pozorski said Wednesday that the state Education Code states that school board 
actions must be approved by a majority of the membership -- or three members of 
the five-member Inglewood board -- not just a majority of those present. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have a five-member board, you need three votes to do anything," 
Pozorski said. "It's immaterial how many board members are present." 
</P>
<P>
A district spokeswoman said Wednesday that county lawyers told district 
officials a new meeting would be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
McCloud, district employees and others said Matthews was treated leniently 
because he has worked on the political campaigns of Aubry, Coleman, Hill-Hale 
and Rouzan. McCloud said the dismissal action should proceed to a hearing 
before the state Commission on Professional Competence. 
</P>
<P>
"My vote would be not to rescind this decision, because of the controversy and 
the political ramifications," McCloud said Monday. "We need to send it on to 
the state." 
</P>
<P>
A district administrator who asked for anonymity said that an employee without 
Matthews' connections would have been fired, not demoted, for a similar 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
Former board member William (Tony) Draper said McKenna's recommendation 
indicates that the new superintendent has caved in to political pressure from 
Aubry, Coleman, Hill-Hale and Rouzan, the city's former police chief who was 
elected to the board in November. 
</P>
<P>
McKenna, a former Los Angeles high school principal with a national reputation 
for toughness and independence, was hired in October and hailed as the man who 
would clean up a district crippled by politics. One of McKenna's first actions 
as superintendent was to recommend the dismissal of Matthews on administrative 
charges of "dishonesty and immoral conduct." 
</P>
<P>
"It's totally crazy," Draper said. "I'm really disappointed in George McKenna." 
</P>
<P>
McKenna and the four board members have denied that their treatment of the 
Matthews case has anything to do with politics. McKenna said Tuesday that the 
reversal of his recommendation resulted from "new information" -- board members 
said it was Matthews' offer to pay restitution -- and a new willingness on the 
board to deal with the matter internally. McKenna said the district would 
receive "100% restitution" and Matthews could still face dismissal if he is 
convicted of a felony. 
</P>
<P>
"My motivation was not political," McKenna said. "I think it was a laudable act 
to take. We did not diminish our authority at all. The board has exercised its 
decision-making authority in a very forthright way. It has shown it is not 
unwilling to make a decision internally. . . . This is very fair to both 
sides." 
</P>
<P>
Rouzan, who is up for re-election in April along with Aubry and Coleman, said 
he did not feel Matthews had committed a "dismissable offense." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Some Very Foolish Things' 
</P>
<P>
"I think you have to take into account a lot of considerations," Rouzan said. 
"I think some very foolish things were done. I think the punishment is 
adequate. It was kind of a nickel-and-dime offense that accumulated to a 
substantial amount." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if his position conflicts with his law-and-order image, Rouzan said: "If 
you look at my track record carefully, it would show that I've always been very 
lenient on the first offense. I've always felt that severe punishment should 
occur once you step over that line again." 
</P>
<P>
Matthews was previously disciplined by the board in 1987 for using school 
district equipment to prepare political flyers for candidates, according to 
Coleman and Draper. Rouzan said he was unaware of that. 
</P>
<P>
Aubry said he does not think the Matthews decision will be an election issue. 
While he said his vote was not politically motivated, he acknowledged that it 
may be perceived that way. He also said that Matthews' adversaries may have 
political motivations in pushing for his dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unauthorized Account 
</P>
<P>
The police affidavit, which was filed in Inglewood Municipal Court to obtain a 
search warrant, says Matthews spent at least $4,000 in school funds on clothes, 
groceries, beauty supplies and an elaborate Christmas Nativity scene for his 
east Inglewood home. Much of that money came from an unauthorized bank account, 
police said, to which Matthews diverted donations that had been made to the 
school: profits from a student store, and money from employee paychecks that 
had been padded with extra hours. 
</P>
<P>
In December, Inglewood detectives searched Matthews' home and his four cars -- 
two Mercedes-Benzes, a Cadillac and a Mercury, according to the affidavit. They 
seized numerous personal and school financial records, as well as parts of the 
Nativity scene. 
</P>
<P>
The police investigation involved an exhaustive review of school and bank 
records and interviews with current and former school employees. It began in 
late 1987 when school district officials discovered Matthews' unauthorized bank 
account and reported it to police.

GIVE DOGS THEIR OWN PARK, WOO URGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles' only official dog park, Laurel Canyon Park, has become so popular 
that a city councilman Wednesday proposed fencing most of it off so dogs could 
run free there all day, not just during selected hours. 
</P>
<P>
"The sheer volume of people taking advantage of the ability to run their dogs 
free during the specified hours has severely taxed the limited parking 
resources at and around Laurel Canyon Park," Councilman Mike Woo said in his 
motion to the council. 
</P>
<P>
"There also have been repeated instances of people not respecting the time 
limitations, often due to the number of dog owners present during the limited 
hours." 
</P>
<P>
The City Council in April decided to allow dogs to run free at the park from 
dawn to 9 a.m. and from 4 p.m. to dusk. At other times, only leashed dogs are 
permitted in the park. 
</P>
<P>
The council's decision had capped a long and often nasty dispute between dog 
owners who let their animals run loose and other park users who complained that 
animals were taking over the place. 
</P>
<P>
On a sunny day, as many as 100 dogs can be found in the small park off 
Mulholland Drive at the crest of the Santa Monica Mountains. It is the children 
who are confined -- in a small playground tucked in a corner. 
</P>
<P>
Woo's proposal calls for a "permanent, fenced-off section of Laurel Canyon 
Park, separate from picnic and other play areas, for exclusive use as an 
off-leash dog run, to be available for use during all hours." 
</P>
<P>
Diana Brueggemann, an aide to Woo, said the councilman proposes to fence off 
the majority of the park, which has about four acres of flatland in addition to 
surrounding hillsides. The exact dimensions, location and size of the 
fenced-off area have not been worked out. 
</P>
<P>
Parking and traffic congestion near the park is especially bad during winter 
evenings when there is only about an hour of daylight after work for dog owners 
to run their pets. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a good compromise," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The council sent Woo's proposal to its Parks Committee for a recommendation. It 
is expected to be approved. The park is in Woo's district, and council members 
customarily defer to a councilman on a matter in his district. 
</P>
<P>
Jane Purse, a leader of a group of dog owners, said Woo's proposal is "probably 
better than what we have at the moment, which is difficult to enforce." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Greenfield, president of Laurel Hills Homeowners Assn., said Woo's 
proposal fails to address the problem: "You have 20 parking spots and hundreds 
of people who want to use the park." A better solution, he said, is to allow 
dogs to run free in other parks.

BERNARDI ASKS REVIEW ON PLACEMENT OF PAROLEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY and RICHARD SIMON, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles city councilman Wednesday called for city officials to determine 
if state policy that allowed a paroled killer to be placed in a North Hollywood 
apartment adequately safeguards the community. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Ernani Bernardi asked the city's chief legislative analyst to enlist 
the aid of the city attorney's office and the Police Department in conducting 
"an immediate review of the laws, policies and procedures that allowed the 
parole of Raymond Louis George to the community of North Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
The City Council routinely referred his motion to its Police, Fire and Public 
Safety Committee for a recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 18, George, convicted in 1985 of carrying a concealed weapon and 
sentenced to four years, was paroled from the California Men's Colony at San 
Luis Obispo and placed in an apartment in the 11800 block of Vanowen Street. 
George -- previously convicted of killing a police officer, shooting another 
officer and attacking a college student with a machete in 1974 -- is on 
medication for a psychiatric condition. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Removed From Apartment 
</P>
<P>
George, 36, was removed from the apartment Tuesday when neighbors became 
alarmed after seeing news reports on his release and receiving copies of an 
internal police memo mailed anonymously to them without departmental 
authorization. The memo described George as a mentally ill man who "believes 
his mission in life is to kill police officers and women." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities have refused to disclose George's new location except to say that 
it is not in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, it is in the public interest to provide those who have paid their 
debt to society with the opportunity to rejoin the community without 
interference," Bernardi said. "However, it appears to be a threat to public 
safety for the state Department of Corrections to place individuals it 
describes as 'dangerous' and in a 'delicate' psychiatric condition in a 
residential community with no word of warning to that community." 
</P>
<P>
However, corrections officials said George's parole and placement were handled 
in compliance with state regulations. They said they had no choice but to 
release him because state law entitles convicts not serving life sentences to 
be paroled under a formula that gives them credit for good behavior and work at 
prison jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"We had no legal right to keep him one day longer," said Jerry DiMaggio, 
regional administrator of the parole division. 
</P>
<P>
State law also required that George be returned to the county where he was 
convicted, DiMaggio said. Once here, George was considered a "cold-turkey" 
case, parole parlance for having no family or residence to return to, DiMaggio 
said. 
</P>
<P>
When George was previously paroled in 1983 after serving nine years in prison 
for the murder and assault convictions, his case was assigned to Hugh Alcott, 
now supervisor of the Van Nuys parole office. Because Alcott has had previous 
experience with George, he was assigned the ex-convict's case when George was 
released last week. Alcott found the North Hollywood apartment for George, 
DiMaggio said. 
</P>
<P>
DiMaggio said the manager of the apartment complex was aware that George was an 
ex-convict on parole when he accepted him as a tenant. The manager could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Rent for the apartment was paid with a check from the parole office, DiMaggio 
said. George's rent will be paid from the office's loan fund until he gets a 
job or qualifies for Social Security payments or other assistance because of 
his diminished mental capacity, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Parole officials also informed the Police Department's North Hollywood Division 
that George was living in the area. There was no other notification and none is 
required by law, DiMaggio said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is becoming very difficult to parole people," he added. "People don't want 
them in their community. But when you are sending people to prison, you have to 
expect them to return." 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi, whose district includes the North Hollywood area where George was 
placed, agreed that state law requires no disclosure of such information other 
than to police. He asked that city staff report their findings on the 
procedures and make recommendations regarding any changes that should be 
sought.

SANTA CLARITA TO CONSIDER ROADS BALLOT MEASURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Clarita City Council has agreed to consider placing on the November 
ballot a measure that would increase annual property tax bills between $75 and 
$200 to build new roads. 
</P>
<P>
The council, however, carefully avoided endorsing the tax increase originally 
proposed last week by the Santa Clarita Valley Transportation Committee, an 
offshoot of the Santa Clarita Valley and Canyon Country chambers of commerce. 
The council also agreed Tuesday night to discuss the proposal with committee 
representatives Feb. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Lou Garasi, a committee spokesman, said Wednesday that the committee is not 
asking the council to endorse the politically delicate measure. The committee 
merely wants the council to put the proposal before the voters and to spare the 
committee the time-consuming task of collecting signatures to win a spot on the 
ballot, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed tax would involve current and future development in the city and 
unincorporated portions of the Santa Clarita Valley, Garasi said. 
</P>
<P>
The committee will also ask the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors to 
place the measure on the ballot, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Jo Anne Darcy, also a field deputy to Supervisor Mike Antonovich, 
said the supervisor and officials in the Department of Public Works are 
receptive to the idea. 
</P>
<P>
The tax increase would last 25 years and raise about $41 million from existing 
homeowners by 2010. Garasi said another $115 million to $200 million would be 
raised from taxes on future development.

TOUGHER PIPELINE-TESTING BILL INTRODUCED IN SENATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prompted by two pipe ruptures that spilled thousands of gallons of crude oil 
into Encino streets and the Los Angeles River last year, a state senator 
Wednesday proposed legislation that would require more rigorous testing of 
underground lines. 
</P>
<P>
The bill by state Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles), who represents 
Encino, would strengthen the California Pipeline Safety Act by requiring more 
frequent testing of the pipelines. It would also require companies to use the 
best available leak prevention technology on new lines or segments of pipelines 
replaced beginning in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal said his proposal is in response to two mishaps in Encino, on Sept. 
10 and 27, involving a Mobil Oil Corp. pipeline that runs from Bakersfield to 
Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Corroded Section 
</P>
<P>
In the first incident, a corroded section of the line ruptured beneath Ventura 
Boulevard and an estimated 70,000 to 90,000 gallons of crude oil leaked to the 
surface. About 8,000 gallons went down a storm drain into the Los Angeles 
River. The spill prompted a massive cleanup operation in the river and in the 
Encino neighborhood, costing Mobil more than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Seventeen days later, while Mobil officials were conducting a hydrostatic test 
on the same pipeline in Encino, the pipe burst again in a neighborhood south of 
Ventura Boulevard and more than 100,000 gallons of oily water spilled into the 
streets, requiring another cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
Hydrostatic testing -- in which a pipeline is filled with water at high 
pressure to test for weak spots normally caused by corrosion -- is a key part 
of Rosenthal's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Under present pipeline safety regulations, hydrostatic testing is required 
every three years on pipelines older than 10 years and not equipped with 
anti-corrosion equipment that provides what is called cathodic protection. 
Rosenthal's bill calls for the testing to be done annually. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Newer Lines 
</P>
<P>
Newer pipelines that do have cathodic protection must be tested every five 
years under present regulations. Rosenthal wants the tests done every two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
During hydrostatic testing, pressure in a pipe segment is raised 25% higher 
than its maximum allowable pressure and held at that level for four hours. 
Under Rosenthal's proposal, the test would last eight hours. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal also proposed that pipelines constructed after 1990 be required to 
have an internal leak detection system. The bill also would increase penalties 
for pipeline operators who violate state regulations on testing the lines, and 
it would require them to provide authorities with descriptions of where 
underground pipelines are located and what is transported through them. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some in the ground that we don't even know are there," Rosenthal 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, which is also being sponsored by state Sens. Art Torres (D-Los 
Angeles) and Alan Robbins (D-Van Nuys), will likely go to the Committee on 
Toxics and Public Safety Management before going to the state Senate floor and 
then to the Assembly, Rosenthal said.

GALANTER BACKS LAKE OVER YAROSLAVSKY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter on Wednesday bucked council 
tradition by reaffirming her support for Laura Lake over fellow Councilman Zev 
Yaroslavsky in the 5th District race. 
</P>
<P>
"I owe Laura personally and politically a great debt," Galanter said. Lake not 
only played a key role in Galanter's successful campaign against Councilwoman 
Pat Russell two years ago but took Galanter's mother into her home after 
Galanter was stabbed by an intruder at her home during the 1987 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky, who supported Russell two years ago, said of Galanter Wednesday, 
"I understand her personal relationship with Laura, and I respect it." 
</P>
<P>
Galanter endorsed Lake, a fellow environmentalist, in September when 
Yaroslavsky was expected to give up his council seat to run for mayor. 
Yaroslavsky decided earlier this month not to challenge Mayor Tom Bradley, 
citing polls showing him to be unbeatable. Instead, he decided to seek 
reelection. 
</P>
<P>
It was not known until Wednesday whether Galanter, who went to Antarctica the 
day after Yaroslavsky's announcement, would continue to back Lake. 
</P>
<P>
It is rare, but not unheard of, for members of the city's small rather 
collegial body to endorse a challenger over an incumbent. Yaroslavsky, along 
with Councilman Marvin Braude, ignored council etiquette by endorsing Mike Woo 
in his successful 1985 campaign against Councilwoman Peggy Stevenson. Braude 
supported Galanter in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a City Hall news conference, Galanter, who was elected to represent 
the Los Angeles International Airport area on a slow-growth platform, avoided 
criticism of Yaroslavsky. A major theme of Lake's campaign is that Yaroslavsky 
has failed to slow development in the 5th District, a charge that Yaroslavsky 
denies. 
</P>
<P>
Also challenging Yaroslavsky in the April election are Jack McGrath, who 
managed Yaroslavsky's first successful campaign in 1975 and served as the 
councilman's chief deputy; urban planner Ryan Snyder and artist Henry Hill. 
Steve Saltzman, a former Bradley aide and co-chairman of Yaroslavsky's 1985 
reelection campaign, dropped out of the race last week.

BUSINESSMAN GUILTY OF ASSAULT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Inglewood businessman, who sat on a city commission and the mayor's 
anti-crime task force, pleaded guilty Wednesday to assault with a deadly weapon 
for firing a shot last spring at an Inglewood policeman. 
</P>
<P>
Francisco Avina, 40, will return to Torrance Superior Court on Feb. 21 for 
sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
Before the guilty plea, Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki dismissed an attempted-murder 
charge stemming from the same incident. Fujisaki said there was not enough 
evidence to try Avina on that charge. 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood police said the assault occurred last April when they went to a coin 
laundry on South Prairie Avenue after a report of a disturbance. Patrolmen said 
they heard loud noises inside the laundry and thought they had cornered a 
burglar. Only later did they learn that the man crouching behind a row of 
dryers was Avina, the owner of the laundry. 
</P>
<P>
Avina ignored orders to surrender and fired a shot that narrowly missed an 
officer, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Ron L. Smalstig said that he will seek a four-year sentence 
in state prison for Avina but that Avina has no criminal record and might be 
sentenced to probation. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the incident, Avina was a member of Inglewood's Parking and 
Traffic Commission and Mayor Edward Vincent's anti-crime task force. 
Investigators said drinking and marital problems may have led Avina to the 
confrontation.

BATHHOUSE RESTORATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks is considering two proposals 
to restore the historic Cabrillo Beach bathhouse in San Pedro and convert it to 
a restaurant and shopping complex. The plans will be the topic of a public 
meeting Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The 60-year-old bathhouse, once the home of the Cabrillo Marine Museum, has 
been vacant since 1981 except for the shower rooms, the office of a club and a 
concession that has since closed. Last year, recreation officials announced 
that they would offer a long-term lease to someone who would renovate and 
maintain the bathhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Fitzgerald, management analyst for the Recreation and Parks Department, 
said one proposal is from the Pilcher Group of Pomona and calls for $1.6 
million in improvements. The other, from the Los Angeles-based Janss Corp. and 
the San Pedro Bay Co., calls for spending $2 million. Department officials hope 
to select one of the proposals within 90 days after the meeting Wednesday, 
which will be at 7 p.m. at the Cabrillo Marine Museum auditorium.

EX-POLICE OFFICER SENTENCED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former Hawthorne policeman, who pleaded no contest last month to a charge of 
assault for hitting a 17-year-old suspect with a flashlight, has been fined 
$1,000, placed on probation and ordered to perform 500 hours of community 
service. 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Raymond Mireles imposed the sentence Monday on 
John Garza, 25, a patrolman who was fired by the Hawthorne Police Department 
about a month after the assault on June 12. 
</P>
<P>
Garza entered his plea Dec. 14 to the felony charge in exchange for the 
district attorney's office dropping a second assault charge stemming from the 
same incident, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher Darden. 
</P>
<P>
Garza faced up to one year in County Jail, but Mireles chose the other 
penalties and suspended a 90-day jail sentence. 
</P>
<P>
The incident that led to the assault began early in the morning, when police 
arrested two teen-agers for allegedly firing a pistol in the Holly Park section 
of Hawthorne. The 17-year-old had already been captured by other officers and 
was lying handcuffed on the ground when Garza arrived and hit the youth on the 
head for no reason, Darden said. 
</P>
<P>
Garza's lawyer could not be reached for comment.

ODOR COMPLAINTS, SMOKE INVESTIGATED; 
</P>
<P>
PARTS PLANT ACCUSED OF POLLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY PYLE, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
A Van Nuys aerospace parts plant has been accused of violating air-pollution 
laws by the South Coast Air Quality Management District because of smoke 
observed wafting out of a chimney. 
</P>
<P>
The Coastcast plant in the 16700 block of Stagg Street, near Balboa Boulevard, 
is also under investigation because of odor complaints, said Bill Kelley, an 
AQMD spokesman. Residents of a nearby trailer park complained to the district 
of noxious odors from the plant, which manufactures aerospace parts using a 
wax-cast process. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe it is related to wax they use," Kelly said of the odor. "When wax 
is not completely burned you can get some other things that form . . . that 
probably are not dangerous but may smell a little different than wax itself." 
</P>
<P>
Kelly said investigators may reach a conclusion about the nature of the odor by 
the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Record 
</P>
<P>
The AQMD has no record of violations by Coastcast or by Rex Precision Products, 
its predecessor. Coastcast took over the plant in November. 
</P>
<P>
The AQMD has not determined what penalties might be leveled against the plant 
for the smoke violation, which was observed during an inspection Tuesday, Kelly 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of Birmingham Trailer Court say they have suffered health problems 
ranging from peeling skin and headaches to irritated eyes and noses. They say 
they fear that the problems are related to the odor. 
</P>
<P>
Last week they said they noticed a marked increase in the pungency of the odor 
-- which some describe as a petroleum odor and others say is more like plastic 
burning. 
</P>
<P>
"You wake up in the morning and you go outside and it's nauseating," said Barry 
Savo, who has lived in the Balboa Boulevard trailer park for seven years. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm popping Tylenol like gum, but my headache still lingers," said Sandy 
Ayola, a trailer park resident since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Week of Calls 
</P>
<P>
Penny Newmark, spokeswoman for Residents Against Pollution, a San Fernando 
Valley environmental group, complained that it took nearly a week of telephone 
calls to various health agencies before the AQMD on Wednesday released the 
names of chemicals used at the plant. 
</P>
<P>
Those records show that Coastcast uses chemicals including silicone, 
hydrochloric acid, isopropyl alcohol and a toxic solvent called 
1,1,1-Trichloroethane. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Rauch, manager of the Coastcast plant, said he has assigned a maintenance 
supervisor to monitor the factory at night. 
</P>
<P>
About the odor, he said: "We've been looking into this since they first started 
complaining. What we're determining is that we had a mild malfunction in one of 
our ovens, which has been corrected. . . . We're very concerned about it, too, 
because we have a good-neighbor policy."

CHARGERS HAVE TALKS WITH WHITE, HENNING

<TEXT>
<P>
The Chargers met with two more candidates Wednesday night in their search for a 
head coach. 
</P>
<P>
They were former Mike White, the former University of Illinois head coach, and 
Washington Redskins assistant Dan Henning. 
</P>
<P>
That brought to three the number of candidates interviewed in two days. Tuesday 
night the Chargers talked with George Seifert, the San Francisco 49ers' 
defensive coordinator, who is also a candidate for the vacant Cleveland head 
coaching position. 
</P>
<P>
All three candidates were interviewed in Monterey, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very impressed with George as a person and even more impressed since 
Sunday with his work," said Steve Ortmayer, the Chargers' director of football 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
Seifert Sunday directed the San Francisco defense that limited the Cincinnati 
offense to no touchdowns in the 49ers' 20-16 victory in Super Bowl XXIII.

Dexter Howard scored 27 points and Tom Lewis 25 as Pepperdine turned the tables 
on the Loyola, winning 104-79 in a West Coast Athletic Conference game 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Waves won their fifth consecutive game to improve to 13-7 and moved into 
the WCAC lead at 5-0, one-half game ahead of St. Mary's. 
</P>
<P>
The loss ended the Lions' 19-game, regular-season WCAC winning streak, which 
began against Pepperdine in the last game of the 1986-87 season. The Lions 
dropped to 10-7 and 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola Marymount had been averaging 112.4 points and Pepperdine 78.2. It was 
the Waves' highest output of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola's Hank Gathers, who led the nation with averages of 33.6 points and 14.5 
rebounds, was held to 25 points and only two rebounds. Jeff Fryer had 22 points 
for the Lions. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine took the lead for good at 28-26 on Craig Davis' 3-point shot with 
8:10 left in the first half, and the Waves increased it to 45-36 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions cut the deficit to 54-46 on a layup by Enoch Simmons with 16:27 left, 
but the Waves went on an 8-0 run, getting five from Howard, to move out to 
62-46. 
</P>
<P>
The Waves shot 63.2% and limited the Lions to 41.5%.

BANNING COUNSELOR GIVES HELPING HAND TO COLLEGE PROSPECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The walls of John Becker's tiny office at Banning High School are covered with 
the mementos of his labor. Posters, schedules, letters and photographs, each 
representing a college football program, give his cubicle the look of a 
cluttered travel agency. 
</P>
<P>
"This is what is known as credibility," he said, a poster from Michigan State 
perched above his head. "I'm not on an ego trip." 
</P>
<P>
But, like any good travel agent, Becker is in the business of trips. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1971, the Banning counselor has helped set up college recruiting trips 
for a talented stream of football players who have passed through the 
Wilmington campus. In turn, Becker has had the pleasure of entertaining many of 
the nation's top college coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Frequent visitors over the years have included Oklahoma's Barry Switzer, who 
successfully recruited running back Stanley Wilson, linebacker John Truitt and 
quarterback Jamelle Holieway from Banning; Tom Osborne of Nebraska, Larry Smith 
of USC, Terry Donahue of UCLA and virtually every other Pac-10 coach. 
</P>
<P>
Before the Feb. 8 signing date for letters of intent, Becker expects to see Lou 
Holtz of national champion Notre Dame, Bo Schembechler of Michigan, Dennis 
Green of Stanford and Donahue, all waging a recruiting war over Banning's prize 
senior -- 6-7, 275-pound offensive tackle Bob Whitfield. 
</P>
<P>
"I do what I can as far as getting scholarships for our players," Becker said. 
"My basic job is PR (public relations)." 
</P>
<P>
As recruiting coordinator, Becker provides a variety of services for Banning's 
players and college coaches. 
</P>
<P>
He promotes players by mailing newspaper clippings and placing phone calls to 
recruiters. When a coach visits, he provides transcripts and game films and 
sets up interviews with Banning coaches and players. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so much easier this way," Becker said. "When a recruiter comes to 
Banning, he knows he can come to me and get just about anything." 
</P>
<P>
Proof of the system's success lies in the high number of Banning players who 
acquire scholarships. This year, Becker said nine Pilots are certain to sign 
with four-year schools. 
</P>
<P>
"We may even have 11 if everything works out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Carlson Leomiti, a 6-4, 340-pound lineman who has made a non-binding verbal 
commitment to San Diego State, says Becker's help is invaluable. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very fortunate to have Mr. Becker," he said. "With him handling all the 
athletic scholarships, it makes it less stressing on the players and coaches." 
</P>
<P>
Becker got his start as a recruiting coordinator in 1971 with one of the 
students he was counseling, Steve Rivera. A talented wide receiver, Rivera 
signed with UC Berkeley. In the following years, Becker continued to assist 
players who happened to be students he was counseling. The list included 
running back Freeman McNeil, who went on to star at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Before long, nearly all of Banning's college football prospects were coming to 
Becker, who had played at Eastern Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
"I created a monster," he said. "What happened is that my students told other 
players, 'Go see Mr. Becker if your want information about colleges and 
recruiters. He knows a lot about it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Becker says he communicates with 50 to 60 colleges every year. 
</P>
<P>
"I wear two hats," he said. "I have my own load of 350 students that I'm 
responsible for, and I try to help the football players as much as I can." 
</P>
<P>
In this, the era of Proposition 48, Becker says one of his main duties is 
making sure Banning's players are academically qualified for college. Players 
must score at least a 700 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) and maintain a 
2.0 grade-point average in core curriculum to be eligible as freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to get my kids to take the SAT in the spring so they can get it out of 
the way and go into football season with no problems," he said. "I've been very 
successful this year. I think everybody on the squad who is a senior is 
eligible for a scholarship except maybe two kids." 
</P>
<P>
And what does Becker get out of his part-time labor of love? 
</P>
<P>
"If I can steer a player in the right direction," he said, "then I'm happy."

DESANTIS' COOL HAND ICES CHATSWORTH WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY McALISTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chatsworth High's Dominic DeSantis beat El Camino Real with the ball in one 
hand and his coach in the other. 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth Coach Gary Shair was arguing with an official who had added a second 
to the clock -- from 1 to 2 to play -- with Chatsworth ahead by a point. 
DeSantis left the free-throw line, wrapped his arms around Shair and led him to 
the bench. The 6-foot forward, who was fouled to stop the clock, said that he 
wanted to ice the game. 
</P>
<P>
Shair sat down and DeSantis sank both shots and El Camino Real, 60-57. 
</P>
<P>
"He had to calm coach down," center Cornelius Edwards said of the coach. "He 
was about to get a technical and we were only winning by one." 
</P>
<P>
Ten seconds remained when El Camino Real guard Russell Reid raced downcourt 
attempting to get the ball to Charles Crow on the wing, but he threw the ball 
out of bounds. That mistake, although the most untimely, was not the first for 
El Camino Real in the last quarter. 
</P>
<P>
With Chatsworth (10-7 overall, 2-0 in West Valley League play) leading, 56-54, 
and fewer than 2 minutes left, Jason Farrell tried to break the Chatsworth 
fullcourt press and looped a pass upcourt that was intercepted. The Chancellors 
called time out. 
</P>
<P>
And what happened at the end of that timeout profited Chatsworth more than any 
strategy discussed during it could have. The Chancellors came back on the court 
and began play while El Camino Real was still shuffling out of its huddle. Rick 
Garrick scored an uncontested layup to extend the lead to 58-54. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a 100 mistakes in those last two minutes, " El Camino Real Coach Mike 
McNulty said.

PREP BASKETBALL ROUNDUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Pedro 59, Banning 52 -- Forward Willie Sanchez, playing what Coach Jack 
Kordich called his "best game," scored 32 points and pulled down 10 rebounds to 
lead the Pirates to a Pacific League victory at home. 
</P>
<P>
San Pedro led by 18 points in the third quarter as it evened its record at 3-3 
in league play and 8-8 overall. Banning, which could get no closer than three 
points late in the game, fell to 1-5 and 8-11. 
</P>
<P>
Redondo 71, South Torrance 52 -- Mike Houck, Dave Dinnel and Kevin O'Brien each 
scored 15 points to lead a balanced attack for the Sea Hawks, who stayed one 
game off the pace in the Ocean League with an easy win at Redondo. 
</P>
<P>
The Sea Hawks (7-1, 14-5) will play at first-place Morningside on Friday night. 
South, which got a game-high 16 points from forward Lance Holmes, slipped to 
0-8 and 3-14. 
</P>
<P>
Dorsey 78, Gardena 72 -- Despite a game-high 24 points from senior guard Darryl 
McMillan, the Mohicans dropped deeper into last place in the Southern League 
with a loss at home. Gardena fell to 2-4 in league play, two games behind 
Dorsey and Washington (both 4-2), and faces an uphill fight to make the L.A. 
City 4-A playoffs. Crenshaw leads the standings with a 6-0 mark. 
</P>
<P>
Dorsey led virtually the entire way, taking a 54-45 lead into the fourth 
quarter. Darnell Hampton paced the Dons with 21 points. 
</P>
<P>
Gardena (11-8 overall) got seven assists from leading scorer McMillan and 17 
points from forward Kevin Sanders. The Mohicans resume league play Friday at 
Crenshaw. 
</P>
<P>
Carson 74, Narbonne 58 -- Suffering from a letdown after an emotional win over 
rival Banning last Friday, the Colts still had more than enough to put away the 
lowly Gauchos in a Pacific League game at Narbonne. 
</P>
<P>
"The one highlight was our free-throw shooting," said Carson Coach Rich Masson, 
whose team made 28 of 33 foul shots. Center Vince Washington had 13 points for 
the first-place Colts, who improved to 4-2 in league play and 10-7 overall. 
</P>
<P>
Narbonne stayed in the Pacific cellar at 0-6 and fell to 2-13 overall. 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills 79, Beverly Hills 68 -- John Hardy's basket with 4:07 remaining 
put the Titans ahead for good and enabled them to hold on to sole possession of 
first place in the Bay League with an 8-0 record. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills (4-4 in league and 10-7 overall) had taken a 64-63 lead with five 
minutes left on center Michael Moore's jumper, but Rolling Hills (17-3) roared 
back with eight unanswered points. Following Hardy's basket, guard Steve Clover 
sank a 3-pointer and was fouled. He made the free throw and the Titans led by 
five. 
</P>
<P>
Hardy, who finished with a game-high 36 points, and Clover, who contributed 19, 
scored all but six of Rolling Hills' points in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Moore paced Beverly Hills with 23. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside 79, North Torrance 52 -- It was business as usual for the Monarchs, 
who parlayed another strong defensive effort and a balanced scoring attack into 
their eighth Ocean League win without a loss at North. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Eddie Scott scored 19 points and swingman Jon Madison added 18 for 
Morningside (14-4 overall), which led by at least 15 points throughout the 
second half. Guard Kenny Jones had six steals. TIM DERMODY

RESEDA GIRLS TURN BACK NORTH HOLLYWOOD RALLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS J. PARKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
History dictates that whenever the girls' basketball teams from Reseda and 
North Hollywood highs meet, they must play a close, 
keep-you-on-the-edge-of-your-seat game. For the past 2 years, the teams have 
met twice for league titles and twice for City Section championships. 
</P>
<P>
But for the first 7 minutes of Wednesday's Mid-Valley League game -- which 
Reseda won, 58-55, at North Hollywood -- Reseda's play dictated a much 
different kind of game. Reseda led, 19-4, with a minute left in the first 
quarter. Forget history. Had they wanted to, the Regents could have been 
excused for thinking about what to do after the game. 
</P>
<P>
"When you play North Hollywood, you never think anything," said forward 
Jennifer Marzahl, who led Reseda (11-3, 6-0) with 22 points. "We can never let 
up against North Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
The Regents, who beat the Huskies in the past 2 City 3-A Division finals, may 
not have let up, but they did let the Huskies back in. North Hollywood closed 
to within 2 late in the second quarter and led briefly during the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew we'd get it together," North Hollywood Coach Rich Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
But the Huskies watched their efforts go for naught in the fourth quarter. With 
the score tied, 55-55, North Hollywood (11-4, 4-1) committed 4 consecutive 
turnovers in the last minute and was unable to control the rebound on 2 missed 
Reseda free throws. 
</P>
<P>
"We have never had an opportunity where we could sit back and relax playing 
them," Reseda Coach Andrea Francola said. "I would like to relax but . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Michelle Cabaldon scored 17 points for North Hollywood; Denisha Jordan scored 
12 for Reseda.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Morningside guard Kenny Jones averaged 5.5 steals a game in the first round of 
Ocean League basketball play, helping the defensive-minded Monarchs get off to 
a 7-0 start and move closer to their fifth league title in six years. 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills beat visiting Torrance, 85-76, last week to maintain sole 
possession of first place in the Bay League basketball race and improve its 
home record to 31-1 in four years under Coach Cliff Warren. 
</P>
<P>
Carson's girls basketball team, 0-10 in league play two years ago, improved to 
13-3 overall by defeating highly rated Washington and Crenshaw. 
</P>
<P>
Serra guard Alex Mendenhall has made 22 of 24 free throws (92%) in the last 
four games, including a stretch of 19 in a row that ended last week. 
</P>
<P>
Who's Not 
</P>
<P>
Banning's basketball team suffered its eighth loss in the last nine games 
Friday night, falling to rival Carson, 75-56, in a Pacific League match-up. 
</P>
<P>
West Torrance, hoping to stay in contention for a playoff spot in the Ocean 
League, fell two games off the pace by committing 26 turnovers in a 62-57 loss 
to Culver City. It dropped the Warriors into a tie for fourth at 3-4. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes, a semifinalist last season in the Southern Section 3-A basketball 
playoffs, lost all three of its Bay League games last week to fall to 1-6 and 
3-12 overall. 
</P>
<P>
Hit hard by academic ineligibility, Marymount College's basketball team fielded 
a squad of five players in 98-83 loss to Harbor, falling to 0-6 in conference 
play.

CS NORTHRIDGE BASKETBALL TEAM RETURNS HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Having earned a split on its toughest trip of the season, Cal State Northridge 
will play 6 of its next 7 California Collegiate Athletic Assn. basketball games 
at home. 
</P>
<P>
But is that good news or bad news for the Matadors? 
</P>
<P>
Northridge (11-5) has lost its past 2 games at home after winning 5 home games 
in a row. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to get the feeling of winning at home again," said CSUN Coach Pete 
Cassidy, whose team beat Cal Poly San Luis Obispo last Saturday after losing at 
Bakersfield. "It's our gym, our crowd, our environment. We practice there every 
day. We should be as tough as hell to beat there." 
</P>
<P>
Northridge will be short-handed as it tries to regain its form tonight at 7:30 
against Chapman College. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Leroy McCullough is academically ineligible and has left the team at 
least temporarily in order to concentrate on his studies. McCullough, the team 
leader in shooting percentage (57.1%) and blocked shots (10), was fourth in 
scoring for the Matadors, averaging 9.1 points a game as a reserve. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman is 8-8 overall and 1-2 in the CCAA, a game behind Northridge, which is 
2-1 and in a 4-way tie for second place behind Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Rog Middleton, a transfer from Utah who became eligible in December, 
leads Chapman with a 15.7 average in conference play. MIKE HISERMAN

OXNARD KEEPS VALLEY AT BAY, 67-64 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Oxnard College took an early lead and held off a tenacious Valley team, 67-64, 
Wednesday night in a Western State Conference men's basketball game at Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout, there was the feeling that behind sharpshooting guards Tory 
Stephens and Joey Manliguis, Valley might snatch victory from the Condors' 
talons. 
</P>
<P>
But Oxnard guard Tony Stark hit both ends of a 1-and-1 with 8 seconds to play 
to put away the Monarchs. 
</P>
<P>
Stark had only 5 points before the clinching free throws. 
</P>
<P>
The meat of Oxnard's offense was provided by Stark's backcourt mate, Mark 
Price, who scored 22 points, mostly from outside. 
</P>
<P>
Outside shooting was in vogue as Stephens and Manliguis combined for 36 points, 
primarily on baskets from the perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
Stephens began his assault late, however, making the Monarchs' first 12 
second-half points. A stop-and-pop jump shot by Stephens with 5:34 to play gave 
Valley its biggest lead, 56-53. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for the Monarchs, the lead was short-lived as Condor center Randy 
Carter went to work inside. 
</P>
<P>
Carter scored 7 of Oxnard's final 9 points, all in the lane. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Paul Nunnery scored 20 points for Oxnard. DAVID SALKIN

USAir Group's 1988 profit was off 15% to $165 million. Operating revenue rose 
to $5.7 billion, up 90%. The Washington-based operator of USAir, Piedmont 
Aviation and four commuter airlines credited the results to one-time expenses 
related to merging Pacific Southwest Airlines with USAir last April and 
establishment of a $33-million reserve to reduce the company's investment in 
its BAC 1-11 aircraft and related spares.

Walt Disney Co. reported record first-quarter earnings of $148 million, up 48% 
from last year. Revenue for the period jumped to $1.043 billion, a 42% 
increase. The results were the highest for any comparable period in the Burbank 
entertainment company's history. The company said its record performance was 
attributable to all three of its business interests: theme parks and resorts, 
film entertainment and consumer products.

Texaco Inc.'s 1988 net income was $1.3 billion, contrasted with a loss of $4.14 
billion in 1987. The White Plains, N.Y. oil giant noted that 1987 results 
included a charge of $2.06 billion relating to a writedown of selected assets 
and a provision for restructuring and a charge of $2.8 billion for the Pennzoil 
settlement. The company said results benefited from lower crude oil acquisition 
costs, capital investments made in refining system in prior years and improved 
operating efficiencies. Results were hurt by depressed level of crude oil 
prices for most of the year, as well as the loss of production in the North Sea 
resulting from the explosion and fire at the Piper Alpha platform in July, 
1988.

LEGAL VIEW: COURTS BACK THESE MARRIAGE PROPOSALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY S. KLEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My Jan. 5 column about the legal requirements of marriage reminded lawyer and 
former law professor Louis M. Brown, a pioneer in the preventive law movement, 
of an article he edited more than 10 years ago as part of a "Counseling 
Newlyweds" project he helped start at the Beverly Hills Bar Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The project provided newlyweds with one hour of free legal counseling on the 
legal ramifications of marriage or living together. Since the project is no 
longer in operation, Brown suggested that I might offer a checklist of items 
that newlyweds might review shortly before or after they walk down the aisle. 
It sounded like a good idea. Besides, my sister, who is about to join the 
married ranks, would be thrilled. So, with thanks to Brown for sharing his 
article with me, here are a few legal issues to consider. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Separate Property 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ownership. Under the community property laws of California, everything that 
you own before marriage is considered "separate property." Thus, all your 
earnings before marriage are yours and yours alone. So if you own your own 
automobile at the time of your marriage, it will remain your separate property. 
However, you may want to share ownership of it with your spouse by either 
making it a part of the community property or by giving your spouse a 
half-interest in it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spouse's Debts 
</P>
<P>
But changing the nature of the property from separate to community will mean 
that it can now be used to satisfy your spouse's debts. In other words, a 
creditor may reach community property for debts incurred by either spouse. (By 
the way, whether or not you do change the ownership of the car, you'll want to 
talk to your insurance agent, to make sure that your new spouse is covered when 
he or she drives it.) 
</P>
<P>
 -- Community property. In general, most property and all earnings acquired 
after a marriage are automatically considered community property. Interest and 
dividends payable on separate property generally remain separate, however. Each 
spouse has a one-half interest in community property and equal rights of 
management and control. 
</P>
<P>
One spouse can't give away community property without the permission of the 
other, but with a will you can leave your heirs one-half share of the community 
property. And even if you happen to get married in some out-of-state location, 
the community property laws of California will apply if you reside here. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Pre-nuptial agreements. Courts will enforce marriage contracts that divide 
a couple's assets in advance, so if and when there is a divorce, there won't be 
a fight. Agreements that cover personal behavior, like who will take out the 
garbage, are less likely to be upheld, but some people like them because they 
help couples discuss and resolve potential problems. (I think they are silly.) 
</P>
<P>
 -- Children. If you have kids, the law will require you to support them. This 
is meant to protect the child and save the government from the burden of 
providing support. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Life insurance. The law does not require you to have a life insurance 
policy, but now that you're married, you might want to consider it. And if you 
already have a policy, you may want to amend it and add your spouse as the 
beneficiary. Life insurance is even more important if you have children, 
because you will want to provide for their security, care and education, if 
anything untoward happens to you. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Savings accounts. Speaking of beneficiaries, you'll want to check any other 
savings device, such as your employer's pension plan or bank accounts, to see 
what name you listed as a beneficiary. You may want to delete Uncle Harry and 
add the name of your new spouse. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Name Change 
</P>
<P>
 -- Names. In many cases, women change their last name to that of their 
husband. In fact, it wasn't until 1975 that the Legislature passed a law giving 
a married woman the right to use her maiden name in all transactions. The 
choice is up to you. However, if you do change your name, you should try to 
advise all the necessary parties, such as the Department of Motor Vehicles, 
Social Security Administration, insurance carriers, registrar of voters and 
your employer. 
</P>
<P>
If you don't do it now, you'll have to do it eventually, like when you renew 
your license, or try to vote. It does sound like a terrible hassle, although 
one letter to each agency, with a copy of your marriage certificate, should 
suffice. (I'll have to tell my wife of four years that; she still hasn't gotten 
around to telling all of officialdom.) 
</P>
<P>
 -- Estate planning. Just because you're getting married doesn't mean you need 
a will -- it will probably be more important if and when you have children -- 
but it's not a bad time to begin some estate planning, especially if you have 
substantial assets. 
</P>
<P>
After you finish picking a wedding dress, planning the wedding party, sending 
out the invitations and choosing the honeymoon site, there probably won't be 
time left to visit a lawyer. But now you should be a bit better prepared to 
discuss some of the legal binds that will tie you together, or at least know 
which questions to start asking.

YOUR COINS: SENTIMENTAL VALUE MAY EXCEED PRICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON ALPERT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: In going over some of my great grandfather's mementos from Civil War 
days, I came up with a penny -- in good condition -- and would like to know its 
worth. It is dated 1858 and has a flying eagle on the face, United States of 
America around the edge. The back has the words "one cent" surrounded by a 
wreath of leaves. -- B.H. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: You've described the Flying Eagle 1-cent piece. It's a short-lived 
series, 1856 to 1858. The 1856 cent was actually a pattern with only about 
1,000 issued. All of these early pieces are quite valuable. The 1857 and 1858 
are actually quite common with millions produced. 
</P>
<P>
The Flying Eagle was used as a transition coin and followed the long run of the 
Large Cent. Since the cent was downsized, it was felt that it would take a 
while for the public to accept something smaller with the same face value. In 
1859 the cent was redesigned once again, this time with the popular Indian head 
design. 
</P>
<P>
At one time Flying Eagles were highly prized by collectors. Some of its 
popularity has faded as silver dollars and gold pieces have gained collector 
attention. But such dips tend to be cyclical and no doubt the Flying Eagle will 
emerge once again as a collector favorite. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, nice specimens are still quite expensive. Your 1858 cent, one of 
24.6 million minted, is probably in the $5-to-$20 range, depending upon 
condition. I suspect it has more sentimental value than that. 
</P>
<P>
Q: In the 1828 census of Hungary, taxes were calculated in "Rfl." and "xr." In 
1828, Hungary was under Austrian rule, and the "x" and "xr." is clearly from 
the cross design after which the Austrian kreutzer and the Hungarian krajcar 
were named, so that the "xr." was one or both of those coins. Clearly, the 
"Rfl." is some kind of florin, and the tax sums of the census imply 60 xr. 
equals 1 Rfl., which was the ratio up to 1858. But what particular coin was the 
"Rfl."? I've checked Krause's catalogue with no luck. -- A.G.F. 
</P>
<P>
A: This is one of those obscure questions that defy an answer, at least as far 
as I'm concerned. I've checked with some authorities but no one seems to know. 
You might want to check with the government of Hungary, or perhaps one of our 
readers can supply an answer.

gold proof medals depicting scenes from the film classic. Judy Garland starred 
as Dorothy (pictured) while Dorothy's slippers (also pictured) serve as the 
common reverse. There are 12 silver proofs and six gold proofs in the series 
with only 10,000 gold and 25,000 silver pieces available for each scene. For

CONSUMER VIEWS: SAYING 'NO' TO MORE LIFE INSURANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON G. CAMPBELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: From reading your columns, I realize that people usually come to you 
when they have exhausted their patience or avenues of appeal. Perhaps you could 
address this issue: Is there any state law or regulation that covers the top 
age at which people will be approached to buy more straight-life insurance? 
</P>
<P>
The enclosed correspondence outlines the situation experienced by my neighbor, 
C.A., who with his late wife were also good friends of mine. In essence, C.A. 
was approached by representatives of Prudential Insurance Co. about his 
"insurance needs." C.A. told the two of them that he had no need for more 
insurance, but because they persisted, he invited them for a visit. 
</P>
<P>
They kept him for an hour and a half and told him that Prudential was unhappy 
with him because they were paying him more in dividends (on three older 
policies) than they were receiving in premiums. Finally, he agreed to a new 
$10,000 policy because he was assured that "it would cost him nothing." A 
medical technician checked out his health, but then he began receiving notices 
asking him to pay $638.10 for the new policy. Yearly premiums are $1,250.50 
until March 12, 2008, when it will increase to $1,661.30. 
</P>
<P>
C.A. is 76 years old, with no children and has no dependents. And he is 
convinced that Prudential is "looting" his three senior policies to pay for the 
new $10,000 one. I feel that this smacks more of intimidation than 
salesmanship. I am retired from the Social Security Administration, and I am 
well aware of seniors being sold multiple insurance policies. Is there no 
self-policing within the industry regarding the top age at which companies will 
stop attempting to sell life insurance? -- L.B. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Everyone should be blessed with someone like you as a neighbor -- 
pursuing this matter with everyone from the California Department of Insurance 
to the local office of Prudential to the chief executive officer of the company 
in Newark, N.J. You've made more waves than the U.S.S. Lexington hitting open 
water. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, according to David Langenbacher, the Los Angeles-based chief of the 
Department of Insurance's underwriting services bureau, the department has 
already begun an investigation of C.A.'s case, and Prudential has already been 
asked for an explanation. 
</P>
<P>
From a purely practical standpoint, however, there isn't any state law or 
regulation that prohibits any insurance company from approaching anyone, of any 
age, and selling him or her a product. 
</P>
<P>
And in certain instances, Langenbacher says, there can be a valid reason for 
selling a 76-year-old man a new life insurance policy: if there's a large 
estate involved, for example, and the need for liquidity in that estate is 
advisable. 
</P>
<P>
But, in C.A.'s case, as you point out in a footnote, what we have is a retired 
painter with anything but a large estate. And, certainly, with no visible need 
for any more life insurance. 
</P>
<P>
In such cases, Langenbacher adds, "we review the case and try to determine if 
there is any value to it for the consumer. More often than not, though, nothing 
can be proved or disproved because documentation doesn't exist -- there's no 
paper trail, and what we end up with is an account of what the company's 
representative said and what the consumer said and they're usually 
contradictory." 
</P>
<P>
If it therefore comes to hardball, he continues, "our choices are limited. We 
can suggest that they see an attorney. But, for a 76-year-old person on a fixed 
income, it isn't very practical, and so the insurance company wins by default." 
</P>
<P>
However, it isn't as bleak as it sounds -- especially with a company of 
Prudential's size and standing in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Someone of Authority 
</P>
<P>
"They've got an awful lot of agents," Langenbacher adds, "and the company 
doesn't have a choke-chain on them. So, after we've investigated, we try to 
conclude whether a well-informed, intelligent person would have made such a 
buying decision. If the answer is 'No,' then we call it into question with 
somebody of authority in the company and make every effort to convince them 
that, in the interest of fairness, they reconsider. 
</P>
<P>
"Can't we restore this person's position with the company to what it was 
before?" 
</P>
<P>
"We take the position that any solution that doesn't leave the policyholder in 
as good or better position than he was in before isn't a good solution." 
</P>
<P>
Prudential, through consumer affairs assistant Laurie Webber, concedes that the 
company has been contacted by the Department of Insurance and that the "matter 
is under review and investigation." 
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, however, Department of Insurance underwriting officer Mike Brison 
assured us that the C.A. matter has gone considerably beyond "review and 
investigation" and that the affair has been "completely resolved. Prudential 
has agreed to a total return of the total premiums paid, either directly to 
C.A. or through complete reinstatement of his old policies -- it's as if the 
new policy had never been written." 
</P>
<P>
So, all's well that ends well.

YOUR COLLECTIBLES: WATCH OUT FOR FAKES WHEN BUYING FOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Question: My grandfather left me an old watch fob that has a company trademark 
on the back. I believe its origins put its age at almost 100 years. Can you 
give me some idea when fobs of this type were popular? -- W.R. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: The heyday for fobs was during the late part of the 19th Century. And, 
according to collectors, the fact that your fob has a company marking on it is 
a strong indication that it is a genuine collectible and not a fake processed 
to look "old." 
</P>
<P>
Fobs became a popular vehicle for union and advertising messages; as a result, 
they can command hefty prices from collectors specializing in a particular time 
period or accumulating fobs identified with a specific company. 
</P>
<P>
Most 19th-Century fobs were made of metal, although some hard-to-find enamel 
fobs have survived. 
</P>
<P>
Prices can range from a few dollars to $100 or more. So, obviously, the 
would-be collector should take time to find out whether the fob is a genuine 
collectible or is a recently produced fake. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

we'll add to it in the coming months. If readers have suggestions, or have 
dealt with a mail auction house that deserves mention, let us know and we'll 
check it out.

AN ARTFUL TURNAROUND; 
</P>
<P>
MUSEUM'S DAVIES HAD OWN AGENDA 
</P>

LA JOLLA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art is going through a renaissance. In five 
years, the tony seaside museum has tripled its attendance, eliminated a 
$500,000 debt, expanded its programs -- especially in sculpture and 
site-specific art -- and opened a satellite gallery in downtown San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
It has also earned a valued accreditation from the American 
</P>
<P>
Assn. of Museums; produced national, award-winning exhibitions, as well as 
scholarly publications, and received the highest rating given arts institutions 
by the California Arts Council. 
</P>
<P>
It's been quite a turnaround. Just 5 1/2 years ago, the museum trustees fired 
their director for reasons that ranged from personality conflicts to 
questionable ethical practices. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the museum stands at the most critical crossroads in its history. It has 
launched an $11-million fund-raising campaign to finance a major renovation 
planned by renowned architect Robert Venturi to double its limited (10,000 
square feet) exhibition space. 
</P>
<P>
The active ingredient behind the museum's unprecedented growth is its director, 
Hugh M. Davies. The Princeton-educated Davies possesses a rare combination of 
casual ease, scholarship and managerial finesse that has captivated the 
museum's staff, trustees and contributing artists alike. 
</P>
<P>
Davies, 40, who became the museum director six months after Sebastian Adler's 
dismissal, praises his predecessor and a previous generation of museum 
supporters and staff for building "an unbelievable collection of minimalist art 
and an international reputation for first-class exhibitions." 
</P>
<P>
"They established a reputation that has given us the freedom to experiment and 
expand the museum's program," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Davies has clearly had his own agenda for the museum, viewing 
it as less of a repository for artifacts than as a lab for the research and 
development of art. Similar to the way the La Jolla Playhouse plumbs the 
theatrical avant-garde, he has positioned his museum on the cutting edge of the 
visual arts. 
</P>
<P>
With his casual style and easy manner, Davies seems to cast an odd shadow for a 
museum director. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got this deceptive . . . front," said Texas artist Vernon Fisher. "He's 
kind of laid-back. He's got a tan. He plays golf. He makes it all look easy. I 
don't know if he's hiding behind that veneer, because he's doing incredibly 
serious stuff." 
</P>
<P>
The Davies style belies a rigorous academic training that includes a Ph.D. in 
art history from Princeton. Under his guidance, the museum's self-generated 
exhibits (80% of the museum's shows are staff-organized) have consistently 
disdained safe themes for provocative ones. 
</P>
<P>
But displaying the avant-garde in conservative San Diego, even when the art is 
screened, filtered and selected by a highly trained staff, is fraught with 
risks. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I worry that I'm so rarefied that I'm out of step with the person on 
the street," Davies said. "But I'm not making a decision to please people on 
the street now. I hope the decisions we make today will be satisfying to the 
person on the street 50 years down the road." 
</P>
<P>
Davies' colleagues around the country say he is definitely on the right track. 
</P>
<P>
"He's one of the bright young people in the new crop of directors," said Martin 
Friedman, director of Minneapolis' Walker Art Institute. Friedman gives Davies 
high marks for "particularly advanced exhibitions" and for taking chances that 
have extended the museum's reputation beyond California. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Consey, the director of the competing Newport Harbor Art Museum, compares 
La Jolla with his own institution. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fair to say the total reputation of the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary 
Art is easily in the top 10 contemporary art museums in the country," Consey 
said. Consey credits that ranking to the excellence of exhibitions, programs, 
quality of staff and the quality of the collection. 
</P>
<P>
The museums have similar rankings, seventh and eighth, despite being in 
conservative communities, Consey said. It's a tossup as to which is in which 
place, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Davies was born in South Africa and lived there until his father, a British 
church historian, moved the family to Oxford, England. They moved again when 
Davies was 8, this time to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
He entered Princeton planning to study architecture, but shifted to art history 
and European civilization when he discovered that the architecture department's 
focus in the late 1960s was urban planning. It was while Davies and other 
students were helping organize art exhibits that he discovered his aptitude and 
inclination for working with art, rather than studying it. 
</P>
<P>
"He's very talented, full of innovation," said Sam Hunter, the Princeton art 
history professor who first exposed Davies to the business of exhibition. "I 
think he probably would have gone on and been an academic . . . but he turned 
into the direction of museum work. I think he picked the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
Davies says one of the most satisfying parts of his job is being able to help 
with the physical installation of shows. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever I can, I love to muck around with the artworks," he said. "You never 
look at them the same as when you do that. There's an intensity and 
concentration you don't get. I would do more of it, but I don't want to 
interfere with the curators. Installing a show is a personal thing." 
</P>
<P>
Like his predecessor, Davies seems to have won over most of the artists he's 
worked with. Raul Guerrero, one of a growing number of San Diego artists whose 
works have been purchased by the museum, recalls an incident in which Davies 
looked at a series of four of his paintings, one of which was inspired by a Los 
Angeles bar frequented by artists. 
</P>
<P>
"Hugh went to the bar to check it out, to see if I had captured a sense of the 
place," Guerrero said. "It says a lot to me that he would make the effort, from 
someone who's real busy. I'm sure he does it with other artists as well. It's 
just his temperament." 
</P>
<P>
A key to Davies' success is his interest in the artist's creative process, 
according to artist Al Souza. 
</P>
<P>
"When he presents an artist's work, he really tries to present the work in a 
way the (artist wants) it presented, even if it means difficulties for him," 
Souza said. "A lot of people try to change it. If you say, 'It has to be this 
way,' he'll want to go in that direction." 
</P>
<P>
An example of the extent to which Davies will go to accommodate artists 
occurred during the planning stages for next month's Vernon Fisher 
retrospective. After struggling in vain for years, the museum recently 
succeeded in discouraging the presence of sea gulls, which tended to mess up 
the facility, especially its large picture windows. 
</P>
<P>
But Fisher needed sea gulls to appear in a camera obscura ocean-view 
projection. Out went a new directive to maintenance personnel: Bait the roof a 
month in advance in order to attract the pesky birds. 
</P>
<P>
Museum Trustee Dr. Charles Cochrane said Davies was chosen for the director's 
job because the museum wanted "someone who could manage the museum well and 
could relate well to the public." 
</P>
<P>
"He had the ability to help explain difficult art to people," Cochrane said, 
"and he could certainly get along with people . . . who could eventually help 
in the development of the museum's programs and financial base." 
</P>
<P>
Davies still has detractors. Although generally praising him for his presence 
at gallery openings, and the direction Davies has moved the museum, 
contemporary art collector Dr. Douglas Simay faults him for not promoting its 
satellite space in downtown's emerging visual arts district. 
</P>
<P>
"I think La Jolla is making progress under Hugh," Simay said. "It's just not 
fast enough for me. I never hear about openings downtown. There doesn't seem to 
be an extra effort to say the La Jolla Museum is proud of downtown. There's no 
signage per se. A tremendous number of people don't even know where it is." 
</P>
<P>
Simay, who collects works of a number of Southern California artists, also 
found fault with the museum for not creating "a sense of excitement about its 
programs" and for not following up on its popular 1985 show of works by 42 San 
Diego artists. 
</P>
<P>
Davies agrees with at least one of Simay's criticisms. 
</P>
<P>
"The accusation that the signage is bad (downtown) is absolutely correct," 
Davies said. "We're designing a banner to be put up." However, he said the 
museum purposely adopted a low-key approach downtown. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to come downtown and say we are the final arbiters of everything 
that has to do with art." A number of galleries paved the way, he said. "We are 
very much Johnny-come-latelies downtown and are very much aware of that." 
</P>
<P>
However, Davies bridles at the charge that the museum does not pay attention to 
Southern California artists. 
</P>
<P>
"If anything, I think we may be accused of showing too much of our region last 
year and not taking enough of a national-international view," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He cited 1988 exhibitions in the museum of works by Los Angeles artists Douglas 
Heubler and Jud Fine. 
</P>
<P>
"In terms of local artists, you can never be a prophet in your own land," 
Davies said. "But, over the years, we've done exhibits by Faiya Fredman, Reesy 
Shaw and Italo Scanga. Last year we did the 'Civilians' show (a downtown group 
show featuring locals) and we just closed the (downtown) Tijuana show." 
</P>
<P>
Davies is planning an exchange exhibit of local artists with Boston's Hayden 
Gallery at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for 1990. The museum will 
invite local artists to submit slides of their work, which will be viewed by 
curators from Boston. The curators will then choose 20 or 30 artists, visit 
their galleries and pick six San Diego artists for exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
La Jolla's curators will pick six Boston artists for its exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that kind of show will do more than anything I can conceive of to help 
local artists," Davies said. 
</P>
<P>
The greatest challenge facing Davies and the museum is the need to broaden its 
support to cover the expansion. Artistically, however, the biggest challenge 
may come during the two years of construction, beginning late next year, when 
the museum will be forced to move from the building. 
</P>
<P>
Davies says he has no plans to shut down, and is looking for about 15,000 feet 
of space in downtown San Diego for a "temporary contemporary." 
</P>
<P>
"To me, it's an incredible opportunity to be kicked out of our house and find a 
new way to live . . ." Davies said. "We'll break out of the exhibit schedule. I 
really like the dice being rolled. There will probably be different 
programming. If you wanted to be safe, we would take shows from other 
institutions." 
</P>
<P>
The museum has applied for a special federal grant for a series of exhibitions, 
and there is talk of focusing on the international border. 
</P>
<P>
"What if we rented space in Tijuana for an artist to come and live and create 
art in Tijuana?" Davies said. "Or we may get a Mexican artist to make art in 
San Diego to puncture that border." 
</P>
<P>
He ticked off the possibilities: a portable Bruce Nauman Spanish-English neon 
sculpture that could be exchanged with a Mexican institution. Or perhaps no 
exhibition per se, but instead a space divided into 10 rooms of 1,500 square 
feet each with an artist invited to create a work of art in each one. 
</P>
<P>
The upcoming construction, the fund raising and the move into temporary 
quarters will make a test worthy of Davies' skills, a task his many admirers 
say he's up to.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: DANCE / EILEEN SONDAK: DANCER BRINGS BROADWAY TOUCH TO 
UCSD STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
At the height of his success, San Diego-born dancer Barry Bernal turned his 
back on Broadway and came home. Since the prodigal's return, however, local 
aficionados have seen very little of the former star of "Starlight Express" and 
"Cats." Aside from an appearance with Jazz Unlimited last fall, San Diego's 
favorite son has kept a low profile. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, UC San Diego's recent announcement that Bernal has joined the 
teaching roster for its dance program this year -- albeit on a part-time basis 
-- is cause for celebration among the local dance community. 
</P>
<P>
"We're really excited about him, because of his experience, but even more so 
because he is an excellent teacher," said Margaret Marshall, co-coordinator of 
UC San Diego's dance program and vice chairwoman of the physical education 
department. "We observed him when he taught a master class here, and he was 
wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
"Barry's classes just started this month, and they're already packed, and he's 
really igniting the students. Hopefully, he'll be around next year, but we 
understand he's interested in pursuing his profession as well. He's not ready 
to be strictly an academic." 
</P>
<P>
"Part of the reason I left 'Starlight Express' and came home," said Bernal, "is 
because I wanted to create a stimulus -- to show that San Diego has potential 
as a cultural center. We need to work as a community to nurture programs for 
young people, and we're going to see a turnaround. I have about 50 students in 
my classes, and I see this relationship with the university as a long-term 
association." 
</P>
<P>
Bernal has not abandoned performing, however. He will dance in this year's 
Aademy Awards show and perform with Jazz Unlimited as well. But, as Marshall 
noted, the department is willing to work around Bernal's schedule, because, 
even as a part-timer, Bernal fills an important void at the La Jolla-based 
university. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we have no other men on the dance faculty, and Barry is such a good 
role model for the students," said Marshall. "That helps attract more male 
dancers too." 
</P>
<P>
UC San Diego does not offer a degree in dance, which limits its effectiveness 
as a magnet for attracting quality dancers to San Diego. Nevertheless, Marshall 
believes Bernal's presence on the faculty will act as "a shot in the arm for us 
and for our campus." 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Rincon, artistic director of Jazz Unlimited and a long-time dance 
faculty member at UC San Diego, is just as gung-ho about Bernal's association. 
</P>
<P>
"The students just love working with Barry," she said. "He'll be teaching our 
advanced classes and setting a work on the students for the Spring concert." 
</P>
<P>
Jazz Unlimited is making plans of its own this Spring, as Rincon noted. 
</P>
<P>
"The La Jolla Museum invited us back to do a concert on April 14-15, and we'll 
be getting two new dancers soon. We're still awaiting confirmation on Joey 
Pentileon, but Terry Lindley is all signed. 
</P>
<P>
"Stacy Scardino is back with us, after a year's absence," she said, "so, even 
though the company will remain about the same size as last year, it will look a 
little different." 
</P>
<P>
Local choreographer Tom Vannucci gets his creative juices going when he designs 
dances for old musicals. But his main goal is to maintain the integrity of the 
period, not to show off his own choreographic prowess. 
</P>
<P>
"If we're not careful, people are going to forget about the dances from the 
1870s through the 1920s," Vannucci said during work on USIU's production of 
"Tintypes." "Rhythm, tap, show tap, ragtime. They need to be preserved." 
</P>
<P>
Vannucci had the blessings of director Andrew Barnicle when he tackled the 
project, and between them they beefed up the dancing in the musical revue for 
USIU's all-student cast. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Tintypes' is different than other musicals," Vannucci said. "The director 
and I worked hand in hand to take the production from the 1870s-1920s. I put in 
a lot of dance, but the challenge was not to bore people with it. Historically, 
dance really didn't change that much during those 40 years." 
</P>
<P>
Vannucci was determined to be true to the era, without overworking any 
individual stylistic elements. That involved painstaking research and 
reproduction for a show that ends its brief run at the Old Town Theater on Jan. 
29. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the old standard tap and rhythm routines that pervade most 
stagings of "Tintypes," Vannucci added the one-step, the polka, and a 
Ziegfeld-style chorus line -- all adapted to the confines of the Old Town stage 
-- and to the limitations of his non-dancing cast. To this dedicated dance 
maker, creating the right moves for a college-based musical is serious 
business. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't need to be on stage. I did 'Hello Dolly' in 1986," he said, "but I 
really feel lucky to be able to choreograph as much as I do. I want to keep the 
old dance forms alive." 
</P>
<P>
FOOT NOTES: On Jan. 27-28, New York-based dancer Donald Byrd will share Sushi's 
downtown studio with Mio Morales in "Fast Changers," a multimedia work Byrd 
describes as a "full evening pas de deux." . . . California Ballet members 
Calvin Kitten, Patrick Nollet, Sylvia Poolos and Matthew Bean will appear in 
the San Diego Opera's production of "Lucia di Lammermoor" this weekend. . . . 
Barry Bernal will emcee a movie promotion Tap-A-Thon Saturday at Seaport 
Village in Embarcadero Park. Strap-on taps will be provided for unequipped 
hoofers, and the open session will be followed by national competition under 
way in conjunction with the coming Gregory Hines movie "Tap."

'PSYCHEDELIC' TOUR FAILS TO LIGHT '60S FUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the '60s, the combustible summers invariably were described as long and hot. 
</P>
<P>
The latest repackaging of '60s rock, "The Psychedelic Summer of Love," was long 
indeed (four hours), but seldom searing as it opened Tuesday night at the Coach 
House in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
Performances ranged from punchy and proficient (Big Brother &amp; the Holding 
Company) to nearly parodic (the Seeds) to poignant but pallid (Arthur Lee of 
Love). 
</P>
<P>
(The same bill -- plus the Music Machine and the Strawberry Alarm Clock -- 
appears Friday at the Universal Amphitheatre, and on Saturday, minus the last 
two bands, at the Ventura Theatre.) 
</P>
<P>
In the '60s, the members of Big Brother &amp; the Holding Company were four 
long-haired guys who backed up Janis Joplin for a couple of albums at the start 
of her career. At the Coach House, sans most of the hair, they did a convincing 
job of playing their old blues-rock repertoire with skill and enthusiasm, and 
displayed a continuing knack for finding good women singers. 
</P>
<P>
Michel Bastian brought a big, rangy voice to straightforward renditions of 
songs like "Piece of My Heart" and "Down on Me," carrying them on the strength 
of her singing instead of resorting to Joplin's array of screams, rasps and 
moans. Bastian may not have been braying out her innards as Joplin did, but she 
put across the songs with zest and feeling. 
</P>
<P>
Like the other bands on the bill, Big Brother showed no zest for telling '60s 
war stories between songs. Not only did its no-nonsense approach preclude any 
reminiscing -- it precluded even a single mention of Joplin's name. Some 
memories would have been nice. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Lee, the key member of L.A.'s Love, played with a three-man backup band 
that didn't include any other members of the '60s lineup. His set was short, 
awkward and underrehearsed, and the striking vocal range and flexibility he had 
years ago have diminished. Still, there were affecting moments when Lee's 
signature plaintive tremor kicked in. 
</P>
<P>
The Seeds sounded more capable than ever in the original lineup's first show 
together in 21 years. Then again, the Seeds were one of the least capable bands 
ever to win a spot in rock history. While the players laid down a serviceably 
hypnotic blanket of two- and three-chord garage-psychedelia, singer Sky 
Sunlight Saxon's main contribution was his look: pure Charles Manson wildness. 
</P>
<P>
Saxon's monotonous, nasal bleat, which inspired hope and confidence in a nation 
of musically ungifted garage-rockers 20-odd years ago, lacked the bite to cut 
through the sonic carpet. While the set contained nuggets like "Pushin' Too 
Hard" and "Can't Seem to Make You Mine," the Seeds' hourlong trip eventually 
turned tedious.

Four government censors in Rome have been ordered to stand trial on obscenity 
charges for clearing the way for the TV showing of "9 1/2 Weeks," the steamy 
movie starring Mickey Rourke and Kim Basinger. The censors reduced the 18-year 
age limit for viewing the film in movie houses to 14, thus making it eligible 
to be shown on TV. The commercial Canale 5 network showed the film in prime 
time Dec. 16, 1987. The court stepped in after receiving complaints about the 
TV showing. ALEENE MacMINN

The Old Globe Theatre in San Diego's Balboa Park wants to spend $6.6 million to 
expand its facilities, but various city and private committees must approve the 
plans before construction can start. A gift shop, restaurant, rehearsal 
facility with rooftop parking and a bricked-in plaza with a fountain are 
included. The approval process could take 15 months or longer since a master 
plan for the park must first be approved. While the plan has the support of the 
neighboring San Diego Museum of Art, the Museum of Man and the San Diego Zoo, a 
private planning and lobbying group, Citizens Coordinate for Century III, 
opposes the project as an "ad hoc" expansion that is premature until the entire 
planning process is complete. Globe managing director Tom Hall concedes that 
"we're in the eye of the storm now as far as the Balboa Park Master Plan goes," 
but he added that expansion is critical to the Globe's artistic success and 
financial stability. ALEENE MacMINN

STAGE WATCH : TAPER'S PUZO BIDS FAREWELL TO LOS ANGELES; MEYER TAKES FIRST 
PRIZE IN SCR CONTEST

Wave goodby. Madeline Puzo, associate producer of the Mark Taper Forum and head 
of Taper, Too since 1983, has accepted the position of associate artistic 
director of the Guthrie Theatre in Minneapolis beginning April 3. Taper 
officials have not selected a replacement and declined to speculate on when or 
if a search for a replacement would begin. 
</P>
<P>
At the Guthrie, Puzo will be working with artistic director Garland Wright in a 
variety of capacities, including the supervision of artistic staff, new play 
commissions and the laboratory program. 
</P>
<P>
"They've been talking to me for a long time," Puzo said Wednesday, "since last 
April. It was a hard decision to make. I've lived in Southern California all my 
life and I have a wonderful position at the Taper. Ultimately, it was an 
opportunity to meet new challenges." 
</P>
<P>
Puzo, who has been at the Taper since 1970, said "I have the distinction of 
having had the most titles of anyone at the Taper. I started as a production 
assistant -- a gofer. I had been a production stage manager in San Francisco 
and fell into a temporary job at the Taper. I stage-managed until about 1978." 
</P>
<P>
At that point, Puzo was assigned to work in a producing capacity with Gwen 
Arner, who was in charge of presenting Playworks, the Taper's program of new 
plays for 1978. She segued the following year into supervising the Taper Lab, a 
position she held until 1983, when the Lab was restructured and renamed the 
Taper, Too, with Puzo in charge. She is also largely responsible for the 
development of the Taper's literary cabaret at the Itchey Foot Ristorante in 
downtown Los Angeles (Sundays at the Itchey Foot). 
</P>
<P>
As for her new duties, "Any job description is a kind of blueprint that has to 
be filled out when I get there," she said. "I'm going to be doing the same sort 
of thing that I do here, but with new people and new artists, and in a very 
different cultural climate -- classically-based. To say nothing of the real 
climate. I don't know what happens when I meet the Midwest winter." 
</P>
<P>
Is there a financial advantage in the move? "A slight one," she acknowledged, 
but that wasn't the motivating factor." 
</P>
<P>
LOSE ONE: Playwright Marlane Meyer has asked to have her name removed from 
"Burning Bridges: What to Do When the Egg Won't Stick," a piece she was 
developing with playwright/director Reza Abdoh and which opens at the Los 
Angeles Theatre Center April 14. 
</P>
<P>
Meyer's request reportedly came because other commitments have kept her too far 
away from the project for too long, not over any artistic disagreement, 
according to a spokesperson for LATC. Meyer, who is in New York, could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
WIN ONE: On the other hand, Meyer is the first prize victor in South Coast 
Repertory's first annual California Playwrights Contest in Costa Mesa, winning 
with "The Geography of Luck." 
</P>
<P>
The $5,000 prize was announced Wednesday by SCR, which will stage the premiere 
of Meyer's latest play as part of its California Play Festival this spring. 
</P>
<P>
CalFest, as SCR has dubbed the month-long festival, also will mark the 
premieres of Robert Daseler's "Dragon Lady," the second-prize winner in the 
contest, and Beth Henley's previously announced "Abundance," along with staged 
readings of five unproduced plays by emerging California writers. 
</P>
<P>
"The Geography of Luck" was described by SCR as a play about a former pop 
singer, now an ex-con, who hopes to change his luck by going to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Daseler, 43, had apparently never written a play before. "Dragon Lady" is about 
a 16-year marriage that has reached a crossroads and deals with rootless people 
who cling to the familiar. Daseler is director of public relations for 
Claremont's McKenna College. His second prize brought $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
The third prize -- $2,000 -- went to "Soiled Eyes of a Ghost" by Erin Cressida 
Wilson, who divides her time between Los Angeles and San Francisco. SCR has 
described her work as an unconventional "dreamplay" about the yearnings of an 
adolescent girl. It will receive a staged reading at the festival.

AGED-IN-OAK SOUND OF PHIL WOODS QUINTET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Familiarity in the jazz world breeds contentment. It can produce -- among 
gifted artists long aware of one another's personalities -- a rare level of 
collective invention. So it is with the Phil Woods Quintet, playing for a week 
at Catalina Bar &amp; Grill in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
When the alto saxophonist organized this group in 1975, he had a solid rhythmic 
foundation in the persons of drummer Bill Goodwin and bassist Steve Gilmore, 
both of whom are still with him. Also aged in the Woods are pianist Hal Galper, 
who joined up in 1981, and the visionary trumpet and fluegelhorn soloist Tom 
Harrell, added in 1983 to what had previously been a quartet. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there is more to the story than the group's longevity. Woods and his 
sidemen, particularly Harrell and Galper, are composers whose contributions 
lend the unit much of its character as a latter-day mainstream-modern ensemble. 
Galper's tune "Just Us," which opened the first set Tuesday, was in fact a 
variation on the long familiar chord pattern of "Just Friends." 
</P>
<P>
It was intriguing to hear how the quality of Harrell's contributions varied as 
he switched horns throughout the set. Though his imagination never flags, it 
was on fluegel, which more and more is becoming the horn of choice for jazzmen, 
that he produced his most consistent solos. 
</P>
<P>
Woods by now is the source of inspiration to thousands of alto players, even as 
Charlie Parker was to him. His fire-breathing work on the samba-like 
"Repetition" was balanced by a more reflective approach on "Autumn Nocturn." 
</P>
<P>
Gilmore became a virtual prototype of a new breed of bassists in the late 
1960s, pointing the way to a peak of melodic creativity on this cumbersome 
instrument. As for Goodwin, he has set a standard in sensitive small combo 
drumming that has inspired countless younger players. 
</P>
<P>
All five men pulled their weight in the grand finale, a riotous workout in 
which "Willow Weep for Me," played mainly as a breakneck waltz, was somehow 
intertwined with "All Blues" and even a quote by Woods from "I Feel Pretty." 
This was a head arrangement, and as such a telling example of how delightfully 
these men can stir up what the Spanish called an olla podrida -- a highly 
seasoned soup or stew. With musicians of this caliber, the cooking is easy, and 
the pot will be boiling through Sunday. LEONARD FEATHER

THERE'S MORE THAN ONE WAY TO SKIN A TOMATO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a section about cold stuffed tomatoes in "Joy of Cooking" (Doubleday: 1986), 
authors Irma S. Rombauer and Marion Rombauer Becker write: "A bit of tomato 
skin was once as much out of place at a dinner table as a bowie knife. The 
discovery that tomato skins contain highly valued vitamins makes them 
salon-fahig (acceptable) -- so whether to serve tomatoes skinned or unskinned 
rests with the hostess's sense of delicacy or her nutritional 
single-mindedness." 
</P>
<P>
The choice of whether or not to skin tomatoes may not be yours, however, in 
recipes where tomatoes are cooked. Often they need to be peeled to eliminate 
any pieces of skin ending up in the finished dish or sauce. 
</P>
<P>
After washing, there are two easy ways to remove the skin from tomatoes: 
</P>
<P>
Flame Method: Spear the stem end of the tomato with a long-handled fork. Slowly 
rotate the tomato over an open flame (Photo 1) until the skin chars, blisters 
and splits. Plunge the tomato into ice water for a few seconds (Photo 2). 
Drain, then peel and core using a paring knife (Photo 3). 
</P>
<P>
Boiling Water Method: Immerse the tomato in boiling water (Photo 4) for about 
one minute. Remove and plunge into ice water for a few seconds. Drain, then 
peel and core using a paring knife. 
</P>
<P>

ABOUT WINE: AN UNUSUAL HERITAGE FOR AN EXCEPTIONAL CALIFORNIA CHARDONNAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, Times Wine Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Owning a major and respected chateau in the heart of Bordeaux and making one of 
the most desired red wines in the world might seem like the dream of a 
lifetime, but for Francis and Francoise DeWavrin-Woltner, something was 
missing. 
</P>
<P>
That something was Chardonnay. You can't make Chardonnay in Bordeaux. At least, 
French law says you can't. And Francis, in particular, was fascinated with the 
white grape of Burgundy. 
</P>
<P>
The DeWavrin-Woltners owned Chateau La Mission Haut-Brion and its companion 
white-wine property, Chateau Laville Haut-Brion, both in the Graves district of 
Bordeaux. Both the red and the white wines are acclaimed as among the finest in 
the world. But the white is a blend of Semillon and Sauvignon Blanc. It is not 
Chardonnay. 
</P>
<P>
The greatness of La Mission Haut-Brion was achieved between 1919 and the early 
1980s. First, Frederic Woltner and then his sons, Henri and Fernand, brought 
the property worldwide recognition for wine greatness. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Peak of Excellence 
</P>
<P>
It was while Chateau La Mission Haut-Brion was at its peak of excellence, then 
being run by Fernand's daughter, Francoise, and her husband, that I met Francis 
in San Francisco in early 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Francis was simply gurgling about a plot of land he had just visited. "It's on 
Howell Mountain," he said with a gleam in his eyes. "You know Howell Mountain, 
on the east side of the Napa Valley. You can produce fantastic Chardonnay 
there." 
</P>
<P>
I thought it unusual that a man so renowned for the stature of the red wines, 
and for the marvelous white wine of Graves, would find so fascinating this 
remote region of the Napa Valley, nearer to a town called Angwin than to more 
famous St. Helena. In 1980, Howell Mountain had no reputation whatever for 
white wines. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, Howell Mountain was gaining fame for its hearty red wines, Cabernet 
Sauvignon and Zinfandel. Not for Chardonnay. 
</P>
<P>
Little did I know then that Francis was serious about his love for this 
particular plot of California soil, and for the Napa Valley in general. So 
serious, in fact, that he bought a 181-acre parcel of land in 1980 and began 
planting Chardonnay grapes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sold to Dillon 
</P>
<P>
Then in 1983, the full impact of our little meeting hit me: La Mission 
Haut-Brion and Laville Haut-Brion were being sold. The DeWavrin-Woltners were 
moving to the Napa Valley, but leaving the locks, stock and barrels behind. 
</P>
<P>
And the buyer of the two French properties? None other than an American, C. 
Douglas Dillon, New York banker; ambassador to France, 1953-57; undersecretary 
of state, 1958-61, and secretary of the Treasury, 1961-65. 
</P>
<P>
And, incidentally, also owner of Chateau Haut-Brion, the world famous chateau 
that sits right across the street from the La Mission property. 
</P>
<P>
It is, obviously, ironic that an American would own two such famed French 
wine-producing houses and that a French family would move to California to make 
wine. But what's even more of a curiosity is that the property founded here, 
called Chateau Woltner, now makes the highest-priced Chardonnay yet released in 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
That fact irks Francis, and he wants to keep everything in perspective: "Our 
Titus Vineyard wine is only 7% of our production, and we do make a much less 
expensive wine, too." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Less Is More 
</P>
<P>
A thought well noted, except for the fact that the cheapest of the Chateau 
Woltner Chardonnays is $24, making it merely the fourth or fifth most expensive 
Chardonnay in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Costs to make these wines are, however, very high, DeWavrin points out. He 
notes that the young vines yield only tiny amounts of grapes because they are 
so heavily pruned. The DeWavrin-Woltner team operates on the theory that less 
is more. That is, the fewer grapes you get from an acre of land, the more 
intense the flavors in the wine will be. 
</P>
<P>
The first wines from Chateau Woltner were released in 1985 and they were 
limited in quantity (just 2,151 cases made of all three designations), they 
were controversial in quality, and expensive. The 1986s were of significantly 
better quality, but more expensive still, and now the 1987 wines are ready for 
late spring release and are even more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Since supply and price are linked, prices are high. Just 2,150 cases of the 
Estate Reserve were produced in 1987; only 883 cases of the St. Thomas were 
made, and 309 cases of the Titus were made. 
</P>
<P>
The 1987 wines are, also, exceptional in quality. But they are not, as you 
might expect, typical California-like expressions of fruit. There is no banana, 
apple, pear or peach flavors here. Nor is there the traditional toasty, buttery 
or butterscotch elements of some California Chardonnays that are chewy and 
unctuous. Nor are they flabby. 
</P>
<P>
No, instead these wines remind me more of Burgundy than Napa. The scents are 
distinctly complex and include elements such as juniper and a trace of 
sandalwood. But trying to compare these wines to other fruits or vegetables 
simply can't do justice to the fact that they simply taste like great French 
white Burgundy. 
</P>
<P>
One might make the argument that they come closest to Corton-Charlemagne, and I 
once had a Clos Blanc de Vougeot that I was reminded of when sampling these. 
</P>
<P>
The best of the '87 wines is designated Titus Vineyard and is named after the 
family dog. It is an amazingly deep, intense wine with rich, full flavors on 
the palate and a finishing spiciness. It also has extremely high acidity to 
help it age beautifully for some years. 
</P>
<P>
This is a rare characteristic in California, a Chardonnay that definitely 
should be aged. 
</P>
<P>
Now the prices. Are you sitting down? The Titus wine sells for $54. A bottle. 
This makes it by far California's most expensive Chardonnay, and in fact even 
qualifies it as the most expensive wine in the state, upstaging even the famed 
Opus One, the red wine that is produced by the joint venture between the Robert 
Mondavi Winery and Chateau Mouton-Rothschild. It's only $50. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prices Vary 
</P>
<P>
Not quite as pricey but still heady ($36) is the wine designated St. Thomas 
Vineyard, another wine with delicate, spicy notes and lean, firm aftertaste. 
The mid-palate is very broad, however. The wine designated Estate Reserve ($24) 
is likewise lean and delicate with as much acid as the others. 
</P>
<P>
With prices as high as this, some wine buyers will opt simply to spend their 
dough on French white Burgundies, even though they are very expensive these 
days. (Grand Cru and Premiere Cru Meursault wouldn't set you back more than $30 
or $35 a bottle these days.) 
</P>
<P>
Are these Woltner wines even the best California Chardonnays made today? 
Probably not, but the style of wines certainly is to my liking. The very high 
acidity and underlying structure of the wines is rarely found in California 
Chardonnay today and I'd like to taste them again in two years, to see how they 
develop. 
</P>
<P>
Some may like the broad, very deep, rich style of Chalone Chardonnay; others 
may prefer the fragrant delicacy of Trefethen, or the rich, buttery, spicy 
components in a Chateau Montelena. Chardonnays such as Grgich Hills, Revere, 
Merlion and Vichon come closest to these Woltner wines, but are not exactly in 
the same mode. 
</P>
<P>
The Chateau Woltner wines were made by wine maker Ted Lemon in a style few 
wineries have had the courage to make, in which the acidity is strong and 
matched to the depth of the wine. The DeWavrin-Woltner team has cast its die in 
the mold of Burgundy. With prices to match. 
</P>
<P>
Considering that the style of the wines is not what many Americans expect from 
Chardonnay, and considering that the prices are almost prohibitive, Chateau 
Woltner is clearly a long shot to capture the public's fancy. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, if some years from today the wines have developed into 
classics, with all the panache of a Stony Hill or Hanzell, the price will be 
secondary. 
</P>
<P>
It will be interesting to see what the public makes of this venture. 
</P>
<P>
Wine of the Week: 1987 Konocti Riesling ($6) -- Floral and fragrant with hints 
of carnations, lilacs and jasmine, this wine annually is one of my favorites 
from California. The only problem is its sweetness: it's a bit too sweet for 
serving with foods other than fruit salads. However, it is so well balanced 
that served well chilled, it should be a nice accompaniment to hot Sichuan or 
Mandarin cuisine.

HOMEMADE CANDY IS ALWAYS PERFECT GIFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rich evaporated milk serves as a delicious base for homemade candies -- a 
perfect gift for giving. Its creamy, smooth texture helps the candy remain 
moist and fresh for several days. 
</P>
<P>
But be sure to choose the right cooking pan to allow the candy ingredients to 
boil freely without running over. It should be heavy enough to keep candy from 
burning or sticking to the bottom. In general, the pan should be about four 
times as great in volume as the ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
Using a long wooden spoon that won't get too hot to handle is another plus for 
home candy makers. A candy thermometer is also a good buy since successful 
candy making depends on the temperature and the thermometer takes the guesswork 
out of testing the doneness. Be sure to remove candy from heat as you test for 
doneness so that overcooking does not occur. 
</P>
<P>
Start candy making with Chocolate-Covered Pecans and Caramel, or Turtles as 
they are more commonly called. This simple confection is ideal since it can be 
prepared in a relatively short time. 
</P>
<P>
In small saucepan, heat 1/4 cup butter or margarine and 1 cup evaporated milk 
until butter is melted. In separate 2-quart saucepan, over medium heat, cook 1 
cup sugar, 1 cup dark corn syrup and 1/4 teaspoon salt until it reaches 
firm-ball stage (244 degrees). Stir often. 
</P>
<P>
Slowly pour in hot milk mixture so that sugar mixture does not stop boiling. 
Stir constantly. Cook mixture until candy reaches firm-ball stage again, then 
remove pan from heat. Stir in 1 teaspoon vanilla and cool caramel to room 
temperature. 
</P>
<P>
Arrange 4 pecans per Turtle on wax paper and place heaping teaspoon of cooled 
caramel on each. Let cool until firm. Melt 1 (6-ounce) package semisweet 
chocolate pieces on top of double-boiler and spread over caramel. Let cool 
until hardened. 
</P>
<P>
To give chocolate shiny, hard coating, add 1 to 2 tablespoons melted paraffin 
wax to chocolate, if desired.

YOU ASKED ABOUT . . . : DELICATE HEARTS OF PALM CAN HAVE MORE USES THAN SALADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: What is hearts of palm? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Hearts of palm come from the tender inside of the thick stem of the 
Oreodoxa oleracea palm tree. The plant can grow to more than 100 feet tall, but 
is cut down when about three years old, according to the "Woman's Day 
Encyclopedia of Cookery," (Fawcett Publications: 1966). Canned hearts of palm 
are sold in most supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
Hearts of palm have a bland, delicate taste. They are often used in salads, but 
the above publication also included this recipe for an entree accompaniment: 
</P>
<P>
HEARTS OF PALM WITH BUTTER SAUCE 
</P>
<P>
2 (14-ounce) cans hearts of palm 
</P>
<P>
6 tablespoons butter 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
Chopped parsley 
</P>
<P>
Place hearts of palm and liquid in saucepan. If hearts are very thick, split 
lengthwise. Add 1 tablespoon butter. Simmer 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Melt remaining butter in small saucepan. Continue to heat until butter is 
lightly browned. Add lemon juice and 1/2 teaspoon parsley. 
</P>
<P>
Drain hearts of palm and serve with butter sauce and additional parsley. Makes 
6 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have been holding on to a recipe for a coconut cream cake for several 
years now because it calls for coconut cream pudding, which I have been unable 
to find in the market. Can you tell me where it can be found? 
</P>
<P>
A: We checked with General Foods, which makes Jell-O brand pudding and pie 
filling. Unfortunately, although they still make the coconut cream flavor, it 
is no longer available in Southern California. Have any relatives or friends in 
another part of the country who might send you a couple packages? 
</P>
<P>
Q: A while back you ran a recipe calling for fructose as one of the 
ingredients. Where does one buy it? 
</P>
<P>
A: Fructose is available in the dietary food sections of most supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I eat a lot of raw broccoli but find that peeling and using the stems is a 
bother. Can you tell me whether there is a difference in the nutritional value 
of the florets and stems. Also, what is the proper way to clean broccoli when 
it is going to be used raw? 
</P>
<P>
A: Genieve Ho, Family and Consumer Sciences adviser, UC Cooperative Extension, 
did not have published figures but told us the darker green portions of 
broccoli are higher in nutrition. This means the florets would be more 
nutritious than the stems. 
</P>
<P>
As for cleaning broccoli, "Fresh Produce A to Z" (Lane Publishing, 1987: $6.95) 
advises, "Rinse. Cut off and discard base of stalks, leaving about 3 1/2 inches 
of stalks below florets. Peel bottom few inches of stalks, if desired. Cut 
stalk and florets lengthwise into spears."

WHITTIER DISTRICT SEEKS RELIEF AFTER $1.8-MILLION ERROR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU FULTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WHITTIER 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A $1.8-million accounting error by Los Angeles County is giving the Whittier 
Union High School District a financial headache, and school officials have 
appealed to the state for relief. 
</P>
<P>
The district should have received the $1.8 million last July, at the start of 
the fiscal year. State officials have indicated that the money will be paid 
starting in March, but the nine-month delay may cost the district close to 
$200,000 in revenue from investing the money, said Assistant Supt. Lowell 
Shira. 
</P>
<P>
This month, as required by state law, the district officials notified the 
California Department of Education that the district would be insolvent before 
the end of the school year if the $1.8 million is not received, Shira said. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel reasonably confident they will begin correcting the error," Shira said, 
"but I felt confident we would get our full apportionment last June, also." 
</P>
<P>
If the district is unable to recover the investment revenue, the school board 
will have to cut about $200,000 from next year's already tight budget, Shira 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Revenues Combined 
</P>
<P>
The error occurred when the county auditor-controller's department mistakenly 
combined the property tax revenues of the high school district with those of 
the Whittier City elementary school district, said Pat McMahon, the 
department's accounting division chief. The county's report said the district 
would receive $1.8 million more in property tax revenue than in the last fiscal 
year. The state Department of Education, in turn, cut back its contribution to 
the Whittier district by $1.8 million. The Whittier City district's revenues 
were estimated correctly, McMahon said. 
</P>
<P>
The state noticed that the Whittier district's revenues were unusually high and 
called the county to check on the figure, said Robert Oliphant, manager of 
principal apportionments for the state Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
But county and state officials disagree about what happened next. Oliphant said 
the county maintained that the revenue estimate was correct, while McMahon said 
the county acknowledged the mistake and asked the state to change the figure. 
</P>
<P>
McMahon said the state should pay the district for the $200,000 in interest in 
addition to the $1.8 million. The district estimates that it would have earned 
$100,000 from investing the $1.8 million, and another $100,000 in interest from 
a school fund that was partially depleted to make up for the lost $1.8 million, 
Shira said. 
</P>
<P>
"The state got the benefit of keeping the money," McMahon said. "They earned 
the interest." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
State Doesn't Repay 
</P>
<P>
The state doesn't repay interest when an accounting error affects a district, 
nor does it ask for reimbursement if an error benefits the district, Oliphant 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A mistake of this magnitude by the county is rare, Oliphant and McMahon said. 
Oliphant sympathized with the district's need for the interest money, but said 
the state will not repay the $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys were kind of blind-sided," Oliphant said. "It was just one of those 
things." 
</P>
<P>
Whittier district officials believe the state should make an exception and pay 
the interest. "We're continuing to be shorted," Shira said. "We don't think 
it's fair." 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to recover the interest money, the district has asked Assemblyman 
Frank Hill (R-Whittier) to sponsor legislation to require the state to pay the 
$200,000, Shira said. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the Whittier district's situation, Oliphant said he plans to change 
the way the state handles property tax reports from California counties. 
Starting with the next fiscal year, Oliphant said, his department will contact 
any school district whose property tax revenues are substantially different 
from the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, the department had contacted the county about unusual property tax 
figures, but not the school districts, Oliphant said. "They're sitting out 
there relying on the county and relying on us," Oliphant said of the districts. 
"We want to try and see that this doesn't happen again." 
</P>
<P>
The accounting error is the latest in a series of financial problems that have 
plagued the Whittier district, which serves about 8,800 high school students in 
Whittier and Santa Fe Springs. 
</P>
<P>
The district had to pay for more than $1 million to repair facilities damaged 
in the Oct. 1, 1987 earthquake, and is faced with declining enrollment that 
will force budget cuts in the next fiscal year. Because of an enrollment drop 
of about 300 students, Shira said, the district will have to cut costs by 
$600,000 to $1.2 million. The cuts are necessary because the state funds 
districts based on enrollment. In the Whittier district, which dropped from 
about 9,100 to about 8,800 students this year, the allocation is $3,400 per 
student. 
</P>
<P>
The district was counting on the $200,000 in interest money to reduce the 
extent of the cuts, Shira said. The district's annual budget this year totaled 
$44 million.

SANTA MONICA ADDS TO LIST OF RENTAL PERMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite warnings that the move spells legal disaster, the Santa Monica City 
Council has voted to require apartment owners who want to get out of the rental 
business to obtain an additional permit before they can reoccupy their 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Critics said the measure is an attempt by Santa Monica officials to undermine 
the Ellis Act, a 2-year-old state law that allows landlords to evict tenants 
and remove their buildings from the rental market. 
</P>
<P>
But proponents said the action Tuesday night by the City Council will guard 
against abuses of the Ellis Act and offers an important protection to tenants. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Occupancy Permit 
</P>
<P>
In a 5-2 vote, the council gave preliminary approval to an ordinance that 
requires the owner who has used the Ellis Act to empty his or her building to 
obtain an occupancy permit before reoccupying the property, letting anybody 
else live there or converting it to a commercial use. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say there have been numerous cases of groups of owners buying 
buildings with the purpose of using the Ellis Act to evict the tenants and 
occupy the property. Such a practice amounts to de facto condominium 
conversions executed without city permission, the city said. 
</P>
<P>
By requiring the occupancy permit, the city has some control over subsequent 
use of the building and potential misuse of the Ellis Act, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is where the rubber meets the road," Mayor Dennis Zane said in supporting 
the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
"If we are going to declare (our) allegiance to the security of tenants . . . 
(and to) protecting housing against speculative real estate activity . . . we 
must address these abuses." 
</P>
<P>
The two council members who voted against the ordinance, Christine Reed and 
Herb Katz, said the measure was punitive and oppressive. 
</P>
<P>
Reed said it would ultimately keep buildings empty or encourage demolitions 
because apartment owners will be faced with too many regulations and roadblocks 
stopping them from re-occupying their property. 
</P>
<P>
"We are destroying apartments to save a principle," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're making them (owners) to jump through hoops (so that the city can) get 
around Ellis," Katz said. "We are kidding ourselves. This is going to end up in 
court." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Makes Sense' 
</P>
<P>
But Councilman William H. Jennings, who usually sides with fellow moderates 
Katz and Reed, joined Zane and the council's liberal majority in voting for the 
law. He said that "without getting into the rationale behind rent control," he 
could concur that the ordinance before the council was "enforceable and makes 
sense." 
</P>
<P>
The city has already lost several key court cases involving attempts to 
regulate how the Ellis Act is used. Landlords warned that the new ordinance 
will similarly fail the legal test. 
</P>
<P>
The occupancy permit that the new ordinance requires will be issued by the 
city's planning director. Several restrictions will apply, including a 
requirement that no more than one unit on the property can be occupied by an 
owner. Relatives of the owners may occupy other units only if the relatives do 
not have an ownership interest and do not pay rent. 
</P>
<P>
Katz suggested that such conditions set up city officials to spy into peoples' 
private lives and bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
A handful of tenant activists appeared at Tuesday night's meeting to support 
the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
"This gives us another weapon that tenants can use to prevent evictions," said 
Mallory Pearce, head of the Tenant Aid Project. 
</P>
<P>
Several landlords and attorneys also appeared to argue against the law. 
</P>
<P>
As of last Nov. 28, tenants of 381 units in 65 buildings had been formally 
notified that their landlords planned to use the Ellis Act to withdraw the 
units from the rental market, according to Rent Control Board records.

HOLLYWOOD RENEWAL PANEL HIRES LAW FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In an unprecedented act of defiance, the citizens advisory committee on 
Hollywood redevelopment has hired a law firm to serve as its general counsel, 
giving the controversial committee an independent legal voice for the first 
time in its dealings with the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
The action by the Hollywood Project Area Committee could set off a legal tug of 
war with the Los Angeles City Council, which some committee members say is 
obligated by state law to pay for the attorney. 
</P>
<P>
CRA officials have opposed providing independent counsel and Hollywood-area 
Councilman Michael Woo said in an interview Tuesday, "My inclination is to 
think that it is not justified." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Law Firm May Sue City 
</P>
<P>
Before approving its contract with the Santa Monica firm of Wallin, Kress, 
Reisman, Price &amp; Dilkes, the Project Area Committee was advised Monday 
night that the firm may have to sue the city to collect its fees, which will 
range from $120 to $150 an hour. Orry P. Korb, an associate with the firm, said 
the committee, which has no money of its own, will not have to pay its bills 
until the city makes the money available. 
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that the PAC is entitled to funding," Korb said later in an 
interview. "I am fully confident the City Council will do the right thing." 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, the committee sent a letter to the City Council requesting funding 
to hire its own staff, including an attorney. Committee Secretary Scott Halper 
said the group has never received a reply. 
</P>
<P>
By hiring its own attorney, the Project Area Committee has done more than 
symbolically distance itself from the redevelopment agency. The attorney is 
expected to help meetings run more smoothly by giving legal advice, acting much 
as a city attorney does during City Council sessions. More important, the 
committee gains new leverage in its dealings with the CRA on two crucial 
elements of the redevelopment effort still being formulated: an urban design 
plan for Hollywood Boulevard and a transportation plan for the entire 
1.7-square-mile redevelopment area. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, some redevelopment critics have complained that the committee had 
little influence in shaping the Hollywood Redevelopment Plan adopted by the 
City Council in 1986 because it did not have its own attorneys to question and 
challenge the CRA's crafting of the document. Although the committee now 
functions in a purely advisory role, many members believe their recommendations 
on the design and transportation plans will carry more weight with city 
planning officials and the City Council if they are couched in legal terms. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Attorneys Available 
</P>
<P>
"It was a big day for me to finally get an attorney," said committee member 
Doreet Rotman Hakman, a Hollywood businesswoman who pushed unsuccessfully for 
an attorney shortly after the committee was established in late 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The Hollywood group is the first project area committee to hire its own 
attorney since the city got into the redevelopment business 30 years ago, CRA 
officials said. Traditionally, the CRA has made its lawyers available to the 
committees, although similar groups in other cities have hired their own 
attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
"There are times when PACs don't always agree with us, but we address it very 
openly and publicly," said Donald A. Pelegrino, the CRA's special assistant for 
community affairs. "We have never needed an attorney to mediate this. . . . 
This PAC seems to have its own agenda, and I am not sure what it is." 
</P>
<P>
Critics of Hollywood redevelopment, who gained control of the 25-member 
committee in elections in December, have long complained that agency attorneys 
cannot be trusted to represent both the CRA and the committee. Newly elected 
Committee Chairman Elaine Koenig said it creates a classic case of conflict of 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're getting a divorce, you don't hire the same attorney your spouse 
has," Koenig said. "It just doesn't make sense." 
</P>
<P>
But committee members who support the redevelopment effort said they fear the 
committee now may be tempted to "promiscuously file lawsuits," in the words of 
member Bill Welsh of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce. Welsh said a litigious 
PAC would likely be sued itself, leaving individual members financially 
vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very concerned that as one of the members of the PAC who has assets, my 
assets would be in jeopardy," Welsh said. 
</P>
<P>
Member Michael Dubin, a developer and former PAC chairman, said he would 
consider resigning if the committee instructs the attorney to get involved in 
legal actions. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have to question my own personal liability and the potential liability 
of my firm," Dubin said. 
</P>
<P>
The committee's contract with the law firm specifically states that it 
represents the committee as a whole, not individual members, but Councilman Woo 
said he fears the attorney could become controlled by members affiliated with 
Save Hollywood Our Town, a residents group that sued to block the redevelopment 
project. Last week, a Superior Court judge ruled in favor of the redevelopment 
agency in the case. 
</P>
<P>
"If SHOT decides to appeal the lawsuit, would the PAC be able to vote to enter 
the lawsuit as an entity unto itself represented by this attorney?" Woo asked. 
"This is one of the concerns I would have." 
</P>
<P>
Wallin, Kress, Reisman, Price &amp; Dilkes has a long history of involvement in 
land-use and redevelopment issues. Korb said two of the firm's partners were 
involved in drafting revisions to state redevelopment laws in the 1970s, and he 
said the firm has advised both redevelopment agencies and project area 
committees in other cities. The firm now represents the redevelopment agencies 
of Maywood and Bell Gardens, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In what could be the opening salvo in the firm's dealings with the city of Los 
Angeles, Korb disputed CRA assertions that the Hollywood committee expires in 
May unless the City Council chooses to extend its life. Although state 
redevelopment law states that the committee expires three years after the 
adoption of the redevelopment plan, Korb said in an interview that the plan 
itself "contemplates the continued existence of the PAC" beyond the three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"The redevelopment plan contains language that seems to fairly clearly allow 
for the perpetual life of the PAC, so long as the redevelopment plan continues 
in force," Korb said. 
</P>
<P>
But Kathryn Reimann, an attorney for the CRA, reads the plan differently. 
Reimann said the plan does not "say anything about it one way or the other," 
which means the committee will expire in May under state law "unless the City 
Council takes an affirmative action to extend its life." 
</P>
<P>
Woo, who has said he may recommend against extending the committee's life if 
its "very rowdy" members are not subdued, said Korb's interpretation "is 
different than the legal advice we have been given . . . . I have been 
operating under the assumption that the PAC expires."

SECRECY GIVES WAY TO FEAR;

<P>
PAROLEES FORCED OUT OF MT. WASHINGTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANTIAGO O'DONNELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ex-convicts were supposed to go unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
They had to be nearly invisible for a time, then slowly blend in with the 
economically diverse neighborhood of prewar homes at the foot of Mount 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Such were the plans of Jackie Brown when she started the room and board program 
for prison parolees last August in a bungalow court on the corner of Marmion 
Way and Avenue 43. She did not inform the neighborhood that she was starting a 
program that would house 15 to 20 parolees at a time, and she did not tell the 
city of Los Angeles either. 
</P>
<P>
For some time, the boarders managed to keep a low profile, neighbors said. They 
dressed in simple, clean clothes and avoided loitering. They kept their trash 
out of sight and tended to their front yard. On Sundays, many put on their best 
suits and waited for Brown to drive them to church. 
</P>
<P>
A string of burglaries broke their cover. Police said they found no connection 
to the halfway house. But the neighborhood did. 
</P>
<P>
And while they could produce no evidence linking the parolees to the break-ins, 
their protests to city and state officials produced an even more damaging 
finding. The Los Angeles city attorney's office issued an opinion this week 
that the state-funded program was in violation of city zoning regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Even before the city's investigation concluded, however, the Department of 
Corrections announced that it was pulling out of the program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Transfer Announced 
</P>
<P>
On Monday night, the Mount Washington Assn. brought the news to its members. By 
Feb. 1, all the parolees would be transferred to the Weingart Center, a 600-bed 
facility for the homeless in downtown's Skid Row. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't fare that well in residential areas," said Frank Russell, director of 
the state Department of Corrections' substance abuse revocation diversion 
program (SARD), which funds fewer than 10 community facilities, primarily 
because of the difficulty of overcoming local opposition. The program offers 
help to parolees who have been out of prison for a while but are identified by 
parole officers as being in danger of getting in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not welcome in too many places," Russell said. 
</P>
<P>
As the parolees were being told they would have to leave Mount Washington, 
Brown, the manager of the halfway house, said it would be the last time she 
would try to ease a community care program into a neighborhood without prior 
notice. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No More Surprises 
</P>
<P>
"We can't do it anymore," she said. "From now on, we will have to notify the 
proper authorities." 
</P>
<P>
For SARD, the defeat apparently brought an end to a bold attempt to avoid 
opposition by merely moving in quietly. 
</P>
<P>
Corrections officials were aware from the onset that the Mount Washington 
halfway house might be inconsistent with zoning laws but "decided to test the 
waters" anyway, said Jerome Di Maggio, SARD's administrator for Los Angeles 
County. 
</P>
<P>
The Mount Washington program opened in July under contract to the Transwestern 
Institute, a private social service company. It was to house parolees convicted 
of nonviolent, mostly drug-related crimes. 
</P>
<P>
SARD programs provide housing for parolees up to three months, Di Maggio said. 
They are intended to provide ex-convicts with counseling and job training and 
then return them to independent life styles with permanent jobs. The Mount 
Washington program also offers Bible study. Residents are periodically tested 
for drug use. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drug Problems 
</P>
<P>
During an unannounced visit one recent Sunday, the courtyard between the 
bungalows in Mount Washington was virtually deserted. Most residents were 
inside their modest rooms, gathered around television sets, engaging in quiet 
conversations. Many talked freely about their past drug-related experiences and 
what they were doing to cope with their addictions. 
</P>
<P>
"You can score drugs in jail, but you need money," said Herbert Bonwell, 36. 
"Out here it's much easier to score, so you have to be stronger to stay clean." 
</P>
<P>
As he spoke, he adjusted his tie in front of a mirror. He was getting ready for 
church. 
</P>
<P>
His roommate Steve Herrera, 26, was sipping coffee and watching football on an 
old television set. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a good program," said Herrera, a recovering heroin addict who got 
hooked when he was 12. "I'd be in the streets with no blankets if it weren't 
for this program. Look at what I've got here. It's a beautiful place!" 
</P>
<P>
His small room was tidy and clean, with two beds and a black wooden closet 
taking up most of the space. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, neither Bonwell nor Herrera knew that three months of organized 
community pressure had numbered their days at the home. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
String of Break-Ins 
</P>
<P>
The fight began after a succession of five burglaries and break-ins in the 
first week of October, all within a block or two of the home. 
</P>
<P>
While comparing notes on the burglaries, Mount Washington Assn. members became 
aware of the halfway home at the foot of the hill, among the row of mostly 
multi-unit dwellings along Marmion Way, forming the border between middle-class 
Mount Washington and the lower-income Latino section of Highland Park. 
</P>
<P>
The news about the home, which spread at an association meeting, took most 
neighbors by surprise, and the surprise soon turned into fear. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to run at night, but I can't do that anymore since the ex-convicts 
moved in," said Dea Davis, 30, after jogging past the boarding home the other 
day. "We're trying to build a neighborhood for kids, and we don't feel safe 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Threat' 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's a good idea to have ex-convicts in residential 
neighborhoods," said Chris Gaines, 37, whose house overlooks the boarding home. 
"It represents a threat, because no rehabilitation program has 100% success 
rates and some homes in the area have been burglarized." 
</P>
<P>
Police found no evidence linking the burglaries to any of the parolees. Sam 
Catalfamo, the detective in charge of the investigation, said that such 
burglary sprees are not uncommon in Northeast Los Angeles, where well-to-do 
neighborhoods and economically depressed areas are intermingled. 
</P>
<P>
But the parolees did not get the benefit of the doubt. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after the burglaries, they began feeling the neighbors' scrutiny. First, 
at the association's request, Los Angeles Police Officer Mark Perez visited the 
bungalows. He did not find any violations of law but counted 21 parolees living 
in the house and three bungalows that make up the facility. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with this information, the association asked for their elected officials' 
help. In response, a meeting was set up Dec. 14 with representatives of Los 
Angeles Councilman Richard Alatorre and Assemblyman Richard Polanco (D-Highland 
Park). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sacramento Pressure 
</P>
<P>
Polanco's office contacted state Senator David Roberti (D-Los Angeles). The 
Sacramento staffs of both officials began to pressure the Department of 
Corrections to reexamine its support of the program. 
</P>
<P>
Alatorre's office ordered a city investigation to find out whether the 
program's location violated the Los Angeles zoning code. 
</P>
<P>
Building safety inspector Charles Parsons was sent to the home and cited it for 
five safety violations. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in response to a Dec. 15 letter from Alatorre, Assistant City Atty. 
Patricia Clemens began an investigation of the home's compliance with city law. 
She concluded this week that it was subject to an ordinance limiting to six the 
number of residents in community care facilities. The program needed a variance 
to operate, Clemens said. 
</P>
<P>
Transwestern's on-site supervisor Greg Jasper argued that the Mount Washington 
site comprises four programs, since each of its buildings has a separate 
address. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Defeat Conceded 
</P>
<P>
However, Jackie Brown, the manager of the halfway house, conceded defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Even before Clemens made the opinion public, the Mount Washington Assn. was 
celebrating its victory. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of Alatorre, Polanco and Roberti were on hand Monday night to 
receive a round of applause from about 80 members. 
</P>
<P>
"We are happy that we were to be able to sensitize the Department of 
Corrections about the problem," said David Kim, a spokesman for Roberti. 
</P>
<P>
Di Maggio said he was relieved to learn that the program had secured 30 beds in 
the Weingart Center. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, on the other hand, was disconsolate. Her company will not receive more 
state funds until it finds an adequate program site, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"The state is forcing us to pull everybody out," she said. "The people are 
being sent downtown, which is not a good environment. It doesn't help them."

MONTEREY PARK ENDS SIGN DEBATE WITH COMPROMISE 
</P>

MONTEREY PARK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With compromise being urged from almost every quarter, the City Council has 
ended a months-long controversy by unanimously requiring the use of slightly 
more English on business signs. 
</P>
<P>
The new ordinance mandates that every business sign must include an explanation 
in English of the name or the nature of the establishment. In some cases, city 
officials could require both the name and type of business to be included in 
English on signs. With these restrictions, foreign languages can still be used 
on any sign. 
</P>
<P>
The previous ordinance, enacted in 1986, allowed a business to post a sign in a 
foreign language as long as it included an English-language description of the 
firm's general activity, such as pharmacy, bakery or law office. If the firm 
used several signs, at least one sign would have to state the nature of the 
business in English. 
</P>
<P>
Although some council members were talking last fall about requiring 
three-quarters of any business sign to be in English, that idea never made it 
through a lengthy review process by city officials, the council, the Design 
Review Board and the Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
In taking its vote Monday, the council considered recommendations from both the 
design board and the commission. The new ordinance included suggestions made by 
both agencies, which had concluded last fall that no stricter measures were 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
During the 2 1/2-hour discussion Monday, the consensus of council members and 
those who addressed the council was embodied in a comment by resident Bob 
McCloskey who said: "I'd like to see this issue put to rest, once and for all." 
</P>
<P>
As council members discussed the English-language issue among themselves, a 
compromise emerged with Councilman Christopher F. Houseman and Councilwomen 
Betty Couch and Judy Chu making suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
Houseman, Couch and Chu suggested using either the English language or simply 
letters of the English alphabet on signs. To illustrate what would happen if 
only the English language could be used, Houseman cited El Pollo Loco, the 
fast-food chicken restaurant. Throughout the world, he said, the business is 
known as El Pollo Loco, "but in Monterey Park it would be the Crazy Chicken." 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Chu said, why should the Uno Mas restaurant be forced to be 
translated to One More. Under the proposal as eventually passed, such changes 
are not necessary because the signs can use either English letters or the 
English language. 
</P>
<P>
Even Mayor Barry L. Hatch indicated he would vote for a compromise proposal, 
but not before he forcefully argued that all signs should be in English. 
</P>
<P>
"How are you going to satisfy everybody?" Hatch asked. "If you're going to have 
Chinese (on signs), then you're going to have to have Korean and French and 
German and Vietnamese and Cambodian and Spanish and everything else." 
</P>
<P>
The only foreign language that need appear, he said, might be a small sign in a 
window indicating that, say, Spanish or Chinese is spoken in an establishment. 
To make his point, Hatch, who speaks Cantonese, which he learned as a Mormon 
missionary, spoke in Chinese for a moment. 
</P>
<P>
"You talk about racism," Hatch said. "We are alienating people by dividing them 
with the language they don't understand." 
</P>
<P>
In December, on a 3-2 vote, the council rejected Hatch's request for a study on 
the possibility of holding a referendum on how much English should be required 
on a sign. 
</P>
<P>
The use of English, Hatch said, "is the one strand of fiber that holds us 
together." 
</P>
<P>
Although Chu said she did not entirely agree with the proposal that was passed, 
she said she would support it because "I really do feel strongly that this 
issue has to be brought to a close." 
</P>
<P>
When the council's unanimous vote was displayed at 11:27 p.m. on a tally board 
in the chamber, audience members applauded and Houseman shouted "Hallelujah!" 
</P>
<P>
Before the vote, a dozen speakers addressed the council, voicing a range of 
viewpoints. On occasion, tempers were short. 
</P>
<P>
Resident Harry Kemmerer suggested that signs in a foreign language, such as 
Chinese, contribute to Monterey Park's uniqueness and therefore make the city 
attractive to tourists who can boost the economy. "I see the Asian equivalent 
of Beverly Hills shopping centers here," said Kemmerer, who as a 23-year 
resident has witnessed the ethnic transformation of the city. He added that he 
"never heard of any tourists avoiding San Francisco's famous Chinatown because 
they couldn't read the signs." 
</P>
<P>
"There's enough English now on signs for health and safety reasons," he said. 
"Let's stop harassing the Asian business people with unnecessary sign ordinance 
changes that are designed only to soothe the offended sensibilities of some in 
the Anglo community." 
</P>
<P>
Hatch interrupted him, saying that Kemmerer was deviating. "I think you might 
bring up some emotions we're trying to avoid here this evening," Hatch said. 
</P>
<P>
Kemmerer concluded, saying: "Let's work toward a kinder, gentler, All-American 
city that demonstrates how to live with and enjoy and benefit from our cultural 
diversity." 
</P>
<P>
One businessman, Francis Hong, told the council he opposed any further changes 
that might cost him money to alter the sign for his food import business. When 
the 1986 law went into effect, he said, it cost $2,600, which the city 
provided, to upgrade his sign. 
</P>
<P>
Under the changes approved Monday, the city will take until September to 
determine what businesses are in compliance. Then the businesses will have an 
additional 60 days after that to comply. City Planning Administrator M. Margo 
Wheeler said she will study what, if any, funds may be available to assist 
businesses to comply with the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Momentum for changes in the sign code had been building since last spring, when 
Hatch renewed his 1986 campaign pledge to address the issue. Couch last year 
also advocated that the city follow the lead of other communities, such as 
Arcadia, which requires three-quarters of a sign's lettering to be in English. 
</P>
<P>
Discussions about what percentage of English should be on signs, resident Irv 
Gilman told the council, "would start a war and I'm just sick and tired of 
war." Besides, he said, "there are many, many bigger problems that face 
Monterey Park." 
</P>
<P>
But another resident, Edward Sanchez, complained that too many signs use a 
language he doesn't understand. "I don't want to see a bunch of (Chinese) 
characters. I want to see: 'Hardware Sold Here.' " 
</P>
<P>
That sort of sentiment inspired the English-language requirement in 1986. 
Guidelines to be used by the design review board, which reviews permits for 
signs, were enacted the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
The guidelines, stricter than the 1986 sign ordinance, carried less legal force 
than the ordinance. Still, the board uses the guidelines to help make its 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Design board member Verne Heitman told the council, "Our main concerns are 
communication and aesthetics." This also was one of Couch's motivations in 
pushing for a change in the ordinance, she said. She cited the problems posed 
by signs often using two languages. 
</P>
<P>
Aesthetics were addressed in a number of other changes in the ordinance the 
council enacted. Changes were made to deal with the placement, the color and 
the size of signs.

<P>
Less than six weeks before the March 7 election to decide whether this 
unincorporated community is to become a city, a citizens group has launched a 
vigorous campaign to kill the incorporation movement at the polls.

The Vote No Diamond Bar Incorporation 1989 Committee, formed earlier this month 
by five residents, drew more than 30 people to its first meeting this week. The 
group's founders describe themselves as longtime Diamond Bar residents, who 
fear cityhood would lead to higher taxes and more regulation. 
</P>
<P>
"We just don't need another level of government to tell us what to do and how 
to do it," said Al Rumpilla, co-chairman of the committee. "All the services 
are in place. Everything we need is just a matter of picking up a phone and 
calling the right department (at the county). . . . You don't fix something 
that's not broken, and I don't feel Diamond Bar is broken." 
</P>
<P>
Some advocates of Diamond Bar cityhood have responded to the opposition group 
with derision. 
</P>
<P>
"When they raise an issue that's a valid one, then we can debate," said Gary 
Werner, chairman of the incorporation committee and a City Council candidate. 
"I haven't heard one yet." 
</P>
<P>
After almost two years of planning, petition-gathering and politicking, they 
said the incorporation movement is unstoppable. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say we have about 80% support in the community," said Phyllis Papen, 
president of the Diamond Bar Improvement Assn. and a candidate for the City 
Council that would be formed if incorporation passes. "If (the opposition) had 
had a good showing Monday night, I might think they had some support. With 30 
people, I'd doubt they represent 5% of the population." 
</P>
<P>
Although the anti-cityhood committee lacks the size, momentum and financing of 
Diamond Bar's Incorporation '88 Committee, other cityhood proponents are 
reluctant to dismiss it as a fringe group. Voters rejected cityhood in 1983 by 
a margin of 230 votes out of 6,966 cast after a similar last-minute, low-budget 
opposition campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"I think only a fool would count them out because of (the community's) basic 
inertia," said Paul Horcher, a member of the Diamond Bar Municipal Advisory 
Council and candidate for the City Council. "People don't want change. It 
wouldn't take much money or much of an effort to derail it if they run a fear 
campaign." 
</P>
<P>
A key point of the anti-cityhood argument is uncertainty about how a change in 
government would affect residents. Although county government may be far from 
perfect, incorporation foes said, city government could be less effective and 
more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Cityhood opponents doubt the city would be able to generate enough revenue to 
pay for city services and would look to residents to make up the difference 
through assessment districts or utility taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have a strong enough commercial or industrial base to support a 
city," said incorporation opponent Mike Zullo, a 19-year resident of Diamond 
Bar. "I don't think we can afford to hire the kind of talent the county has. 
I'm not against cityhood. I just don't think we're ready for it yet." 
</P>
<P>
Although the city could not raise property taxes without a vote of the people 
-- as mandated by Proposition 13 -- it could create assessment districts to 
raise money for specific services, such as lighting or landscaping, Rumpilla 
said. He also cited utility taxes, such as the 11% levy charged on gas, 
electric and telephone service in neighboring Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
"What makes our people in Diamond Bar so above-board that they would not use 
the same vehicles to collect fees?" Rumpilla said. 
</P>
<P>
Those favoring cityhood note that 47 cents out of every dollar of revenue 
generated in Diamond Bar is spent for services elsewhere in the county. 
</P>
<P>
"We would be in a better position, because (the city would retain) that lost 47 
cents, not to create assessment districts," Werner said. "We could take that 47 
cents and provide services." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
County Report on Solvency 
</P>
<P>
According to a financial report issued last year by the county Local Agency 
Formation Commission (LAFCO), Diamond Bar should be solvent as a city. In 
fiscal year 1986-87, the report states, revenues generated in Diamond Bar 
exceeded $7.2 million, while expenditures totaled slightly more than $7 
million, of which more than $4 million were spent on public works. 
</P>
<P>
However, the incorporation opponents have cast doubt on LAFCO's figures and 
have produced their own financial projections, which show that the city of 
Diamond Bar would actually have spent slightly more than its 1986-87 revenues. 
</P>
<P>
"The LAFCO budget was inaccurate in a number of ways," Zullo said. "There were 
some things missing in the LAFCO report and some things that were understated." 
</P>
<P>
LAFCO Executive Officer Ruth Bennel said she culled the figures for her report 
from county agencies that provide services in Diamond Bar and League of 
California Cities survey information. Bennel said the criticism of her 
financial report is "typical." 
</P>
<P>
"It's happened in almost every incorporation," Bennel said. "If the figures 
support what they want, great. If they don't, they attack them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$4 Million From Grants 
</P>
<P>
Bennel added that Diamond Bar's solvency does not hinge on a $200,000 
difference in expenditures. The fiscal year used as the basis for the report 
was atypical, she said, because the county spent more than $4 million in 
federal grants for road construction and other public works projects in Diamond 
Bar that year. 
</P>
<P>
The $4 million was listed as an expenditure, but the grants were not considered 
revenue, Bennel said. Looking strictly at general fund items, Diamond Bar took 
in $2.6 million more than it spent, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Rumpilla and Zullo also reject cityhood proponents' contention that 
incorporation is necessary to gain local control over planning and development. 
Too much growth has occurred already, they said, for city government to 
preserve once-bucolic Diamond Bar. 
</P>
<P>
"There isn't much left in Diamond Bar for local control," Rumpilla said. 
"Everything in Diamond Bar's already been sold out." 
</P>
<P>
"That's not true," Papen said, citing 800 rural acres that may be slated for 
development. "What they also don't realize is that Diamond Bar as a community 
is 30 years old. We're experiencing redevelopment in some areas now." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strategy of Opponents 
</P>
<P>
In the weeks before the election, cityhood opponents say they will try to 
gather support by depicting the election as a David-versus-Goliath 
confrontation. They said they will also try to show themselves as average 
citizens taking on a clique of politically ambitious community leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"They're the same people who have pushed for cityhood for the past 10 years," 
Zullo said. "They're people who are seeking entrance to the political arena. 
The people on the other side are politically oriented. The people on our side 
are just residents. We beat them with virtually nothing in 1983. Hopefully, 
we'll be able to defeat them this time, too." 
</P>
<P>
Gary Neely, a leader of the 1983 anti-cityhood campaign who is supporting 
incorporation this time, said support for cityhood is stronger now than it was 
five years ago, while the opposition is not as well organized. 
</P>
<P>
Another key difference, he said, might be the city boundaries. This time, the 
proposed city contains an additional 2,000 voters in an area between Diamond 
Bar and Rowland Heights, which is known as "no man's land" because both 
communities could lay claim to it. Neely said the area's residents would prefer 
to be part of Diamond Bar and strongly support cityhood. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they'll put us over the top," Neely said, though he added he is not 
overly confident. "A lot of people are sitting on the fence right now. I think 
we're going to have a very close election."

COUNTY AGAIN TRIES TO FORM MOSQUITO ABATEMENT DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARYL KELLEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County, in a second effort to get 25 San Gabriel Valley cities or 
their residents to pay for mosquito abatement, took the first step Tuesday 
toward formation of a valleywide mosquito abatement district. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors, advised that a mosquito-borne encephalitis virus 
still exists locally, agreed to file an application to form a new San Gabriel 
Valley Mosquito Abatement District and to lobby valley cities to participate. 
</P>
<P>
San Marino and South El Monte, which are already members of a mosquito 
district, and Pasadena, which has its own eradication program, would not be 
asked to join, county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Participation Voluntary 
</P>
<P>
The district would be established by December, after hearings by the Local 
Agency Formation Commission for comment from the cities. City participation is 
voluntary. 
</P>
<P>
A similar county proposal stalled in 1987 after receiving little support from 
25 San Gabriel Valley cities, which are among 27 countywide that neither 
support an abatement district nor have their own programs, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The cities were reluctant to split the costs -- now about $325,000 annually -- 
because the money would have come from their general funds, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new plan, a property tax of about $2 per parcel per year would pay 
for the abatement district, said Virginia Collins, finance division director in 
the county chief administrator's office. She said no city has yet commented on 
the proposal, but she predicted support for it. 
</P>
<P>
"A $2 assessment is so minor, and the benefit is so great in terms of public 
health, that we don't believe there will be any problem with it," she said. 
"It's cheaper (for property owners) than if they just went out and bought 
themselves some insecticide." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the proposal, officials in Pomona and Temple City, said they would 
probably support the new district. 
</P>
<P>
The county Department of Health Services has paid for mosquito eradication in 
the San Gabriel Valley and other areas without abatement programs since 1984, 
when a surprise outbreak of the St. Louis encephalitis virus infected 16 people 
countywide, killing one and contributing to the deaths of two others. 
</P>
<P>
The virus, which attacks the brain and nervous system, causes symptoms ranging 
from a mild fever to delirium and severe seizures, health officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said many cities throughout the county traditionally refused to join 
mosquito districts because, until the 1984 outbreak, only a handful of 
mosquito-borne encephalitis cases had been reported. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Four Cases Reported 
</P>
<P>
Since the outbreak, four cases have been reported in the county. Though no 
cases were reported in 1987 or 1988, county officials say at least three cases 
were reported in San Bernardino and Orange counties during the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
There has also been evidence that encephalitis still exists in Los Angeles 
County, they said. Last year, the virus was discovered in three of five 
"sentinel chicken flocks" that abatement districts keep in open-air cages and 
test for the disease. It was also detected in four ponds of stagnant water 
where mosquitoes live, county analyst Bonnie Chun said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have the situation back under control, and now we want to keep it 
under control," said Robert Gates, director of the Department of Health 
Services. "But it's still sort of lurking out there." 
</P>
<P>
Gates said a continuing county budget squeeze prompted the new effort to 
"spread the burden" of paying for mosquito abatement. With the new method of 
financing, he expects cities to join the proposed district, Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
In Pomona, officials said they supported the 1987 abatement plan and would 
probably not change their position. 
</P>
<P>
"It's up to the City Council, but I would say the city would certainly support 
that," Dayle Keller, deputy city administrator in Pomona, said. "It's not going 
to be coming out of our budget, and it's a very small amount compared to most 
people's tax bills." 
</P>
<P>
Karl Koski, city manager in Temple City, said that if the health problem is 
substantiated, he will recommend participation in the program.

OXNARD SCRAMBLES FOR DUNES CLEANUP FUNDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MEG SULLIVAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the state Legislature decided more than a year ago to qualify the Oxnard 
Dunes for cleanup money from the state's Superfund, residents of the coastal 
neighborhood were pessimistic. 
</P>
<P>
They predicted that the funds, earmarked for the state's most hazardous toxic 
waste sites, would dry up long before they could be used to determine the 
extent of contamination in the subdivision that was built on an oil sump in the 
1950s and early '60s. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, it turned out they were right. 
</P>
<P>
Officials with the state Department of Health Services, which is overseeing 
testing and any necessary cleanup at the Dunes, acknowledged that the state's 
Superfund is, in the words of the department's deputy director David Willis, 
"broke." He also said his department had long foreseen the shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Be Postponed 
</P>
<P>
With two tests complete, another in the works and at least two more needed, an 
investigation of potentially dangerous subterranean gases detected by previous 
studies could be postponed for as long as 2 1/2 years unless other funding is 
found, department spokesman Jim Marxen said. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria) may have found a way to bridge the 
gap with a bill that would appropriate $300,000 to pay for more studies in the 
area. Oxnard City Council members rushed Tuesday to support the measure, which 
would take effect immediately if passed. 
</P>
<P>
"We're as anxious as everybody else to find out the results" of testing in the 
area, said Ken Hampian, assistant to City Manager David Mora. 
</P>
<P>
But for many Dunes residents, who complain that odors from gases are so strong 
that their neighborhood sometimes smells like the La Brea Tar Pits, the 
assurances of government officials rang hollow. As they approach the third 
anniversary of the discovery of petroleum-based contaminants in the soil 
beneath their homes, their desperation has reached a new pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners have begun abandoning their mortgages and, in some cases, their 
dwellings. Meanwhile, in what some real estate specialists perceive as a first, 
some lenders are declining to foreclose on the properties because they perceive 
them as liabilities. Instead, the lending institutions have begun to pledge 
support for a $3.8-billion lawsuit that 140 residents are bringing against 
anyone even remotely connected with the subdivision. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never heard of lenders joining with residents to sue a developer or to 
sue in a toxic-waste situation," said Phil Nicholson, a partner with the Los 
Angeles law firm of Cox, Castle &amp; Nicholson, which specializes in real 
estate and toxic litigation. "It sounds like a first to me." 
</P>
<P>
Paul Dolan, a leader of the Dunes residents who filed suit, said the move 
illustrates that "the banking and savings and loan industry is just as fed up 
as we are." Another 45 residents of the subdivision who had resisted litigation 
last month filed a separate lawsuit, Dolan said. Their case this week was 
consolidated with the earlier lawsuit by Ventura County Superior Court Judge 
Kenneth R. Yegan. 
</P>
<P>
The suits stemmed from the January 29, 1986, revelation of the discovery of 
DDT, benzene -- a known carcinogen -- and other poisonous chemicals in the 
sandy soil of the neighborhood 1 1/2 miles from the Channel Islands Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Soil Sample 
</P>
<P>
A subsequent soil sample by the state Department of Health Services found no 
benzene or any other chemicals that had showed up in the first test, but it did 
reveal the presence of explosive gases. However, a scattered sampling of the 
neighborhood's 55 dwellings detected no accumulations of gases. 
</P>
<P>
The three companies that the state has said are responsible -- the McGrath 
Trust, Oxnard Shores Development Co. and Chevron USA -- have refused to finance 
contamination tests for fear this might be considered an admission of guilt. 
</P>
<P>
A bill that qualified the subdivision for money from the state Superfund, which 
usually is off-limits to toxic sites tainted by petroleum, was hailed by 
government officials as the answer to the neighborhood's problems when it was 
passed in September, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the state Department of Health has depleted $100 million from a 
1984 bond measure, as well as money from other sources, with all but $10,000 of 
the total going toward sites other than the Dunes, said Arnold Peters, a staff 
member of the legislature's Committee on Environmental Safety and Toxic 
Materials. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Larger Bill Required 
</P>
<P>
State officials said the department cannot expect more funding until either a 
bill of larger scope than O'Connell's is passed or voters approve another bond 
measure. Such a bill could be approved as soon as July, Peters said, but it 
would take two years for a bond issue to come before voters and longer still 
for the funds to become available. 
</P>
<P>
Still, state officials said they are not worried about acquiring the money. 
</P>
<P>
"This is too important to too many communities," said Willis, of the state 
Health Department. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, one more test is expected to be completed in the Dunes 
investigation, state officials said. Dunes residents can expect to learn the 
results at a meeting with state Health Department officials next month. 
</P>
<P>
For some of the residents, however, such measures are too little, too late. 
Rather than continue investing in what they view as a losing proposition, 12 
have stopped paying their mortgages, Dolan said. 
</P>
<P>
Lynda Paxton, a 46-year-old financial planner, is one example. She said that 
sometimes fumes in her Dunes duplex make her so sick that "if I wasn't too old 
and not married, I'd think I was pregnant." 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't until she decided to refinance that Paxton said she decided to 
stop paying off the mortgage on the apartment she bought for $160,000 eight 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Her bank considered her property worth only what was left on the original loan 
-- $97,000 -- and a second mortgage of $12,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stopped Making Payments 
</P>
<P>
In March, 1988, she stopped making mortgage payments, despite fears of ruining 
her credit rating. "I want out of here so bad," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Paxton's bank, First Federal Savings Bank of California in Santa Monica, has 
responded by pledging to join in the Dunes lawsuit, said the bank's counsel, 
James F. Clark. He said six other banks with mortgages in the Dunes agreed last 
week to join the suit. 
</P>
<P>
"We stand pretty much in the same shoes as the homeowners," Clark said. "The 
homeowners have lost their equity and the mortgages are of questionable value 
at best." 
</P>
<P>
In November, 1988, Stephen Blanchard, a 39-year-old electrical engineer, gave 
up altogether. Having stopped mortgage payments in September, he and his 
14-year-old daughter moved out and rented a house elsewhere when he became 
convinced that soil contamination was responsible for symptoms including 
dizziness, shortness of breath and headaches suffered by both. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a responsible person and I didn't want to default on my loan, but I felt 
like I didn't have a choice," he said.

COMPTON OUTLAWS SEMIAUTOMATIC FIREARMS IN CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Declaring that residents are tired of waiting for the Legislature to pass 
stricter gun laws, the City Council unanimously adopted an ordinance this week 
that bans the possession and sale of AK-47s and other semiautomatic weapons. 
</P>
<P>
"We have suffered more because we have had more gang activity from those 
weapons and we've had more murders from those weapons," Councilman Maxcy Filer 
said after the Tuesday vote. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are saying," Filer continued, "is that this has been going on in our 
community for years and we told you (state lawmakers) about it and we asked you 
to outlaw these and you did nothing, so, now we're saying that we will do it 
from within." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Takes Effect in 30 Days 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance, which takes effect in 30 days, does not have any provision for 
people to turn in weapons that they already own. But Filer, the measure's 
author, said that issue can be addressed later. "They know they can turn them 
in at the police station," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone caught with a weapon, including any retail or wholesale business, any 
corporation or club, the ordinance says, is subject to a fine of up to $1,000 
or a jail term of up to six months. 
</P>
<P>
Compton is home to 36 gangs and last year had 84 murders within its municipal 
boundaries, one of the highest murder rates in Los Angeles County and the 
state, officials have said. Over the last three years, 60 people have been 
murdered by semiautomatic weapons. At one point last year, police said they had 
confiscated seven semiautomatic weapons over a 30-day period. 
</P>
<P>
"The state Legislature would have gotten on this 10 years ago if it was 
happening in Beverly Hills, Torrance, Westwood or Pacific Palisades," Filer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the vote, Mayor Walter R. Tucker pointed out that Compton 
officials have "been in the vanguard a long time about banning guns." The mayor 
said he has been a vocal advocate of gun control within the League of 
California Cities and last fall was among the convention delegates who voted to 
have the league lobby for gun legislation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
National Attention 
</P>
<P>
Compton is also home to Boulevard Auto, a gun store that attracted national 
attention last fall when Presidential candidate Jesse Jackson indirectly 
referred to it in a speech and called for the outlawing of semiautomatic 
weapons like the AK-47 used last week in the killing of five Stockton 
elementary school children. 
</P>
<P>
City officials have long been seeking a way to curb the gun store's business. 
The ordinance could help do that if it holds up under the legal scrutiny it is 
bound to draw from gun advocates and the National Rifle Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Owner Mike Virgilio was not present for the council vote. But in a subsequent 
interview, he insisted that he is not selling semiautomatic weapons 
indiscriminately. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't sell AKs to people under 21 as it is," Virgilio said. "And we don't 
even keep Uzis (a similar type of assault rifle) in the store. The city manager 
and the chief of police (and I) we had a meeting down (at City Hall) and they 
conveyed their concerns and I did my best to comply with them." 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, there is a 15-day waiting period for the purchase of a 
handgun. But a semiautomatic weapon such as the AK-47 can be bought by anyone 
who is 18 years or older and no background check is required to see whether the 
purchaser has a criminal record or a history of mental illness. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Figures Disclosed 
</P>
<P>
The sale of AK-47s, said Virgilio, is "no big part of our business. That 
particular model of gun is not any particular share of our volume," he said, 
refusing to disclose how many AK-47s he sells in a month. 
</P>
<P>
The new city ordinance, said Virgilio, is going to encounter legal problems 
because it is difficult to define a semiautomatic weapon. Under the terms of 
the ordinance, he said, many hunting rifles can be classified as semiautomatic. 
The ordinance defines semiautomatics as any firearm that "shoots or is designed 
to shoot, automatically more than four shots, without manual reloading, by a 
single function of the trigger and includes any frame or receiver which can 
only be used with such a weapon." 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever the law is," said Virgilio, "we will comply with it and if it's 
something that we think is unfair, we'll address the matter in the courts." He 
insisted, though, that the city cannot adopt gun restrictions and that gun 
control is the prerogative of the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
An earlier attempt by the City Council to adopt gun control restrictions 
faltered on the same legal argument. In the summer of 1987 the council voted to 
ban handguns. But within two weeks, members reversed themselves after hearing 
appeals from the NRA and several residents as well as the city attorney, who 
had said that only the Legislature had the power to regulate the sale and 
possession of guns. 
</P>
<P>
Filer said, however, that the latest ordinance includes two provisions designed 
to thwart legal attempts to scuttle it. First, the ordinance specifically 
excludes handguns from the ban. And second, the wording contains what Filer 
calls a reference to the "federal question," which he says gives local 
governments the right to adopt gun control measures.

DIGEST: COUNCIL OKS INCREASE IN AMBULANCE FEE TO $151; 
</P>
<P>
LONG BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The cost of city ambulance service is going up in Long Beach. The City Council 
has approved an increase in the Fire Department's ambulance charges that will 
raise the basic fee from $110 to $151 per call, while also increasing mileage 
rates and oxygen service charges. 
</P>
<P>
City officials have said the rate increase is necessary to keep up with 
increased demand for ambulance services brought about by Long Beach's growing 
population. The new rates will add about $750,000 a year to the city's 
paramedic budget.

POLICE GET HELICOPTER FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Pasadena Police Department received $100,000 this week to help pay for 
helicopter surveillance by the San Gabriel Valley Narcotics Enforcement Team. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich presented the check Monday to 
Pasadena Police Chief Jim Robenson, recalling that the city was home to Gen. 
George S. Patton, who successfully led Allied troops to victory in World War 
II. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we are involved in another deadly war," Antonovich said. "This war is 
against an enemy which also threatens our democracy: the international drug 
cartel, dealing with drugs that kill and drug pushers who kill. 
</P>
<P>
"This $100,000 check will help provide our needed resources by helping to pay 
for the operation of a helicopter." 
</P>
<P>
The money is part of the supervisors' gang intervention funds and will be used 
to provide air support for the team.

TRAILERS FOR THE HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Monica may receive 10 trailers to serve as shelters for homeless people 
-- if officials can find a place to park them. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman David Finkel said the trailers will be supplied by Los Angeles, 
which acquired several of the portable shelters last year but ran into 
neighborhood opposition when trying to place them. 
</P>
<P>
Finkel said he anticipated similar resistance once Santa Monica pinpoints a 
place for the trailers. Nevertheless, he said the plan represents a "wonderful 
opportunity" for the city to help the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Chamber of Commerce are helping Finkel in his search for a site 
where the trailers can be parked. One goal is to relocate to the trailers some 
of the transients who live in Palisades Park.

RECONSIDER SALE OF PASADENA YMCA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am writing to you as an outraged member of the Pasadena YMCA. I cannot 
believe that the members were not allowed to be included in the decision to 
sell the building. Consideration for the members was obviously not a factor in 
the board's decision to sell the building. 
</P>
<P>
I, along with many other members, do not have an alternative fitness center 
that is within a reasonable distance and price. I work out primarily on my 
lunch hour, so I cannot drive to other YMCAs in other cities within my time 
constraints. 
</P>
<P>
It is my opinion that the board should represent the wishes of its members and 
be accountable to them. I truly feel that the present board is not reflecting 
the best interest of its membership and should be replaced, and the decision to 
sell abandoned so that other alternatives and arrangements can be made.

CITY MANAGER APPOINTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Art Cook, who has served as interim city manager since the Aug. 31 resignation 
of James Evans, has been appointed to the post permanently, Mayor Lois Shade 
has announced. 
</P>
<P>
Cook was chosen last week from among 56 applicants who responded to a 
nationwide search for a successor to Evans, City Clerk Culver Heaton said. 
Applications were screened by a committee of three area city managers, and the 
City Council interviewed four applicants from among those rated highly by the 
committee, Heaton said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Cook's appointment was not unanimous. Councilman David S. Bodley said 
he and Shade voted for the hiring of another applicant, whom he refused to 
name. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe there were other individuals whom we interviewed who had better 
qualifications for the position than Mr. Cook, and that's why I cast my vote 
for another applicant," Bodley said. "But both Lois and I have made it clear 
that we are going to work with the new city manager. It is our intent to 
provide support on the council." 
</P>
<P>
Cook is a career Glendora city employee, beginning as an engineering aide in 
1956. He became the city's director of public works in 1969, holding that 
position until he replaced Evans as city manager.

GAHR HIGH WILL GET FREE SATELLITE TV PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ABC Unified School District board has unanimously approved a proposal by a 
Tennessee publishing company to conduct a test of a satellite television 
program at Gahr High School in Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a gift that we're blessed to participate in. We are very excited about 
the possibilities," said Nadine Barreto, Gahr principal speaking on behalf of 
the school. 
</P>
<P>
Whittle Communications, a publishing company that is branching into 
telecommunications, selected Gahr as one of six high school participants from a 
cross-country search. 
</P>
<P>
As a participant, Gahr will broadcast a daily 12-minute current events program 
for 25 days with a format similar to nationally televised morning talk shows. 
The goal is to increase students' awareness of world events and geography. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a way to bring the world into the classroom," Barreto said. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning March 6, teen-age anchors will present the combination news and 
features show, that contains four 30-second commercials from Ford and Levi 
Strauss, to all classrooms at Gahr. The commercials are the source of funding 
for the equipment and "are being done in good taste," said Barreto, who also 
has the right to preview them. 
</P>
<P>
A satellite dish, master VCR and 25-inch television monitors in 85 classrooms 
are being installed at Gahr at no expense to the district. Whittle officials 
say the company will donate the equipment to the school at the conclusion of 
the test period that is scheduled to end April 28.

The City Council reached a preliminary decision to move City Hall offices to a 
site at Culver Boulevard and Overland Avenue while demolition and construction 
proceeds at the current City Hall site. 
</P>
<P>
A final decision on the interim site will not be made until next month's 
council meeting, after owners of property next to the Culver-Overland and other 
possible downtown sites have been notified of the move. 
</P>
<P>
The city plans to raze its 71-year-old City Hall and a build a new 
3,000-square-foot L-shape building on the grounds of the present building at 
Duquesne Street and Culver Boulevard.

A Long Beach teacher is among 10 teachers who are in contention for the seventh 
annual Bravo awards, to be presented March 6 by the education division of the 
Music Center. 
</P>
<P>
Judith G. Bohlen is a music specialist in the Long Beach Unified School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
Music Center spokeswoman Connie A. Rivera said the awards were created "to 
recognize educators who have demonstrated outstanding achievement in arts 
education." Two awards will be presented, one to an arts specialist and one to 
a classroom teacher "who has demonstrated outstanding leadership and creativity 
in incorporating the arts into a traditional curriculum," Rivera said. 
</P>
<P>
The finalists were chosen from 97 candidates nominated by their principals. 
</P>
<P>
The others, in addition to Bohlen, are: Barrie Becker, a dance and drama 
specialist, Dorothy Kirby Center School, Los Angeles County Juvenile Court and 
Community Schools; Gabriel Bernstein, third-grade teacher, Vista San Gabriel 
Elementary School, Palmdale, Wilsona School District; Amelia Crawford, 
kindergarten teacher, Eugene Field Elementary School, Pasadena Unified School 
District; Gale Gomez Shafer, art specialist, Bell High School, Los Angeles 
Unified School District; Phila McDaniel, art specialist, Gardena High School, 
Los Angeles Unified School District; Jo Ness, dance specialist, Glendale High 
School, Glendale Unified School District; Taffy Patton, sixth-grade teacher, 
Vena Avenue Elementary Magnet School, Pacoima, Los Angeles Unified School 
District; Stephen Sarinana-Lampson, art specialist, Abraham Lincoln High 
School, Los Angeles Unified School District; and Robin Share, drama specialist, 
Van Nuys High School, Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
The finalists will be visited in their classrooms by a panel of judges that 
includes both educators and artists. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's winners were Shanon Fitzpatrick, a fourth-grade teacher at Morse 
Elementary School in Placentia, and Herb Holland, drama teacher and chairman of 
the performing arts department at Audubon Junior High School in Los Angeles.

COUNTY TO BUY APARTMENTS AT SLIDE SITE; 
</P>
<P>
EVICTION NOTICES STUN RESIDENTS OF 6 CANYON UNITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
County officials agreed Tuesday to buy six luxury apartments in Malibu so they 
can tear them down. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors, in another landslide-related pay-out, approved a 
$750,000 price tag for the apartment complex in rustic Las Flores Canyon, about 
a third of a mile from Pacific Coast Highway. The vote follows by three weeks 
the supervisors' $35-million landslide settlement with 240 homeowners on nearby 
Big Rock Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
The razing of the three A-frame apartment structures would allow Las Flores 
Creek to widen, reducing the chance of flooding throughout the canyon during 
storms, county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The creek is narrowest, about three feet wide, at a bend where the apartments 
are located. It has lost about 35 feet in width there and 95% of its volume 
since March, 1985, as a Rambla Pacifico hillside has slid into it, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Eviction Notice 
</P>
<P>
The purchase of the apartments leaves temporarily unresolved, however, the 
future of residents of five of them. The sixth apartment is vacant. 
</P>
<P>
Residents say they were stunned by a county eviction notice served last Tuesday 
that declared their homes unsafe and gave them 10 days to move out. They have 
begun negotiations for more time and relocation benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors on Tuesday approved payments of up to $10,000 per dwelling, and 
county negotiators said they intended to offer each household a $4,000 lump-sum 
payment plus moving costs and reimbursement for any temporary shelter and 
storage that may be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
But residents said Wednesday morning that no agreement had been reached, and 
they were planning to plead their case for more time to the county Building 
Appeals Board on Friday, the day on which the county first said it intended to 
raze their homes. 
</P>
<P>
"It may be that the appeals board will grant them additional time on Friday, 
subject to (the arrival of) a big storm," said Richard Hoff, assistant deputy 
Public Works director in charge of property management. "In that case, we would 
require them to move immediately." 
</P>
<P>
Even if the dispute is eventually resolved satisfactorily, several residents 
said they were angry over the county's sudden insistence that they move 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew we were going to have to move eventually," said Andrew McCartney, an 
attorney's assistant who has lived with his actress wife, Franny, in one of the 
condemned apartments for 10 years. "But giving us 10 days to move is totally 
outrageous." 
</P>
<P>
Neighbor Leni Corwin, a free-lance writer, said: "We know there's the risk of a 
possible slide and a possible flood . . . but to be ordered out in 10 days is 
vicious, like Simon Legree. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
County officials said they made the decision to buy the apartments and evict 
the residents quickly because of a flood scare two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a situation before that last storm," Hoff said, "where the ground was 
50% saturated and it was still raining. 
</P>
<P>
"We got very concerned. Once the ground gets 100% saturated and you get a 
certain size storm, (flood waters) can build up within a minute. That's when we 
sent out the notices to vacate. We did weigh it very carefully." 
</P>
<P>
The decision came after five years of monitoring the situation, Hoff said. 
</P>
<P>
Each winter since the massive 1983 Rambla Pacifico landslide -- which destroyed 
eight homes, an electrical substation and undercut a busy street -- the county 
has notified about three dozen Las Flores Canyon residents that landslide 
encroachment into the creek has increased the danger of flooding, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Though Hoff could not estimate how much the slide has moved into the creek this 
winter, he said: "A year ago, there was more of a safety factor than there is 
today." 
</P>
<P>
Under current conditions, during a major storm, the apartments would block 
rushing waters at a tight turn in the creek, Hoff said. Debris could then dam 
the channel, flooding homes upstream, he said. In addition, a major flood could 
wash away the apartments, threatening the lives of residents and possibly 
damaging downstream property.

FREEDOM FROM RELIGION OR BULLYING THE PUBLIC? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am greatly concerned about "Freedom From Religion" groups twisting the truth 
and bullying their way into communities such as ours. How dare they claim, with 
arrogance, that certain traditions in this great country of ours are abuses of 
the laws. 
</P>
<P>
Thanksgiving is a longstanding tradition in our country and, like it or not, so 
is religion. The entire foundation of this country is based on freedom to 
develop as the general consensus sees fit, not as a few disgruntled people 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
The use of churches as polling places does not offend the general public. What 
do they think we do, corrupt the minds of the voters? 
</P>
<P>
Separation of church and state refers to protecting us from a prescribed state 
religion, or any religious beliefs, not the forcing of religion from society, 
as they would insist.

THRIVING MARKET FOR STOLEN PARTS BLAMED FOR 22% RISE IN AUTO THEFTS

Auto thefts reported in Glendale increased by 22.7% in 1988, while burglaries 
dropped by 11%, according to police statistics released last week. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale police attribute the jump from 1,328 auto thefts in 1987 to 1,630 in 
1988 to a burgeoning underground market for stolen car parts and car stereo 
equipment. The overall rate of major crimes in Glendale did not change 
significantly from the 1987 rate, police said.

Car break-ins also increased, raising the city's overall theft rate by 2% over 
the previous year. The increase occurred even as other types of burglaries 
dropped by 11%, according to the statistics. 
</P>
<P>
The figures are compiled and released annually by the Glendale Police 
Department's crime analyst. 
</P>
<P>
"There is really a market for stolen auto parts, which we believe accounts for 
the increased number of thefts," Glendale Police Sgt. Dean Duran said. "There 
is also a low risk of being caught." 
</P>
<P>
The rise in auto thefts reported in Glendale has contributed to Assemblyman 
Patrick Nolan's introduction this week of a package of bills to strengthen 
penalties for stealing cars. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Working With Assemblyman 
</P>
<P>
The head of the department's auto theft detail, Officer Don Meredith, has been 
working with Nolan (R-Glendale) to develop the legislation in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
Violent crimes were down 24% in 1988, with reports of aggravated assaults 
decreasing by 40.5%, according to the statistics. Aggravated assaults are 
generally defined as assaults with deadly weapons and those causing great 
bodily injury. 
</P>
<P>
Police handled six murders in 1988, the same number as in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Rapes and attempted rapes increased by 14.3% from 1987, statistics show, from 
28 to 32. Duran said more women reported rapes by their husbands or live-in 
boyfriends last year. 
</P>
<P>
Arson decreased from 104 reported cases in 1987 to 44 in 1988, a drop of 57.7%. 
Duran said Fire Department officials attributed the change to new reporting 
procedures. Officials no longer classify fires set by children under the age of 
13 as arson fires. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, crimes against people and property in Glendale were down 0.1% in 1988, 
according to the police statistics.

FOES, BACKERS SEEK TO PROTECT INVESTMENTS; 
</P>
<P>
HEARING ON APARTMENT PLAN DRAWS 150 
</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Advocates and opponents of a plan to limit apartment construction expressed the 
same goal this week at a three-hour public hearing -- preserving their 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
Those who favor the plan testified that they wanted to preserve their 
investment in a single-family home and keep Whittier's charming residential 
neighborhoods from being overrun by apartments. 
</P>
<P>
"What about those of us who have taken a good deal of money to invest in 
single-family homes?" asked homeowner Leonard Smith. "Our property values are 
going to go down if we are surrounded by two, four, six apartments." 
</P>
<P>
Those who want to retain existing higher-density zoning said the plan 
threatened financial investments made on the basis of the zoning, which has 
been in place since 1955. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Change in Capacity 
</P>
<P>
For Betty Perlman, who planned on building an apartment in back of her house 
for retirement income, the proposed zoning would change the capacity of her lot 
from two living units to one. 
</P>
<P>
"People on fixed incomes have a hard enough row to hoe without having their 
plans for the future blown," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing before the Planning Commission drew more than 150 people. The 77 
people who testified split about 2 to 1 in favor of limiting growth, the issue 
that has galvanized the city since the Oct. 1, 1987, earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing was called to receive testimony on a proposal from a city-hired 
consultant to limit the number of apartments to be built in Whittier's oldest 
neighborhoods north of the Uptown business district. The study by consultant 
Laura Hudson of Michael Brandman Associates said Whittier's aging sewer and 
water systems and narrow streets cannot support the number of apartments 
permitted under current zoning. 
</P>
<P>
Hudson has recommended that the city change the zoning, which limits how many 
apartments can be built on a lot, to conform with the city's General Plan, the 
overall blueprint for development. The General Plan calls for lower density 
than the zoning laws in most areas north of Hadley Street. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Large Crowd 
</P>
<P>
The crowd was the largest since development of the Puente Hills was debated 
about six years ago, said Planning Director Elvin Porter. The Planning 
Commission listened to nearly three hours of testimony Monday night and is 
scheduled to vote on the proposal Feb. 6. Any zoning change must also be 
approved by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Several residents said they feared that a proliferation of apartments would 
turn the Uptown district, already the city's highest crime area, into a slum. 
Joe Holliday, who bought his Uptown area home several years ago because of its 
quiet neighborhood, complained that nearby apartment residents have started 
parking in front of his house. 
</P>
<P>
"Recently, an ill wind has been blowing," he said. "The traffic problem is very 
severe." 
</P>
<P>
There were also emotional appeals from residents who said Whittier's charming 
older neighborhoods -- the city's most distinctive trait -- are being 
threatened by city officials who give in to the demands of developers. 
</P>
<P>
"The community is what we're fighting for, not the individual," said Jeanette 
McKenna. "We're fighting what short-term decisions mean to the long-term value 
of our community." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Absentee Landlords 
</P>
<P>
Residents who had purchased their lots planning to convert houses to apartments 
complained they are being blamed for the sins of absentee landlords. 
</P>
<P>
Yvonne Sanchez said her mother's home on Painter Avenue was demolished after 
sustaining severe damage in the earthquake, and plans for replacing the home 
with apartments have been stalled for nearly a year while city officials 
debated zoning issues. 
</P>
<P>
"Not everyone that comes before you is a big, bad investor," she said.

ATTEMPT TO INTERVENE IN EPA SUIT REJECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A U.S. District Court judge has rejected an attempt by two business groups to 
intervene in a lawsuit by local environmentalists to require the Environmental 
Protection Agency to enforce federal clean-air standards in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura County Economic Development Assn. and the Building Industry Council 
of Southern California asked the court last month to add their voices to the 
lawsuit as a way of considering the "concerns of all of the citizens of Ventura 
County, and not simply those of one special interest group." 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for Citizens to Preserve the Ojai, which filed its suit against the 
EPA on Feb. 24, 1988, said the request was inappropriate and would interfere 
with an impending settlement between the group and the federal agency. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Harry L. Hupp, who agreed that the request for intervention 
was not timely, said the two business groups could review and comment to the 
court on any proposed settlement.

A WALKING FOLK HERO; 
</P>
<P>
HE'S READY WITH A 'BUNCH OF GUTS' FOR 2ND CROSS-COUNTRY TREK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Less than two years after he walked across the country to alert people to the 
importance of cancer checkups, William Croker of Hawaiian Gardens will try to 
do it again. 
</P>
<P>
Known as Walkin' Willie, he has become something of a folk hero. A book and a 
song have been written about him. Governors send him their autographs. 
Tennessee has designated a day in his honor. 
</P>
<P>
"What I do seems to capture people's imaginations," said Croker, who plans to 
leave Feb. 6 from the Rossmoor Shopping Center in Seal Beach on a 76-day trip 
to Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
"You do it with a dream and a bunch of guts. I can't describe it, but there's 
something in me that drives the heck out of me." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Presidential Meeting 
</P>
<P>
Croker, whose mother, father and sister died of cancer, is repeating the walk 
because when he reached Washington in the summer of 1987, President Reagan was 
unable to meet with him. Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) has promised Croker that 
he will try to arrange a visit with President Bush when Croker arrives in the 
capital April 22. 
</P>
<P>
"It will not be over for me till I can meet the President," Croker said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Croker's efforts have hardly been in vain. "I believe these walks have 
literally saved thousands of lives through communications I've had with the 
media on the way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson plans to introduce a resolution next month in the U.S. Senate declaring 
April as National Cancer Awareness Month. Last spring, the third week in April 
was established as Cancer Awareness Week in California after Croker made a 
27-day walk to Sacramento and addressed the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
"Twice in two years, a transcontinental walk . . . and I'm 41 years old," 
Croker said, as if even he can't believe it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Videotapes Are Proof 
</P>
<P>
But he has proof: videotapes taken on his 1987 trip. One shows him walking 
along steamy interstates at 7 m.p.h., with traffic rushing by precariously 
close. 
</P>
<P>
"Pretty courageous isn't it?" Croker said while showing the tapes recently. 
"Out in the rain on the interstate. That's how we got popular across the 
country. Truckers would get on the CB and say, 'There he is again.' " 
</P>
<P>
He has tapes of him jumping in a swimming pool after reaching Sacramento, and 
tapes of him being interviewed by TV crews across the nation. There is one of a 
bearded Croker ("I didn't have money for razor blades") meeting in Washington 
with Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.). 
</P>
<P>
He also has state proclamations and letters from politicians. "Look at the 
proclamations, how they mention Walkin' Willie," Croker went on as he spread 
them on a table. "They're making me an honorary citizen all across the country 
. . . Illinois . . . the great state of Indiana . . . Rhode Island. I've been 
made a citizen in 18 states. Autographed pictures from governors, letters from 
every major U.S. senator. Here's a letter from Michael Dukakis." 
</P>
<P>
And now there is a song that Croker says Larry Gatlin of the Gatlin Brothers 
wrote. It starts: 
</P>
<P>
 "Walkin' Willie, he's a hell of a man, he's gonna show the world where we 
stand." 
</P>
<P>
"They sent me a demo tape," Croker said. "Wait till they get that thing in 
stereo." 
</P>
<P>
Croker, who claims that no one can beat him walking, is also trying to promote 
his sport. 
</P>
<P>
"Everywhere I go now they want to get into this health kick of walking," he 
said. "People have invited me back to start walkin' seminars." 
</P>
<P>
A tall, bulky man with a receding hairline, Croker does not look as if he is on 
a health kick. His stomach stands out like it did before he started his '87 
walk. "That's why I'm beefed up," he said. "I lost 39 pounds the last time. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in the greatest shape of any human being in this world right now. I'm so 
solid, I could leave right now and not have any pain or blisters. I walk every 
day (about 20 miles). My legs are so strong. My feet are completely healed." 
</P>
<P>
His feet were so blistered in 1987 that there were times when he took off his 
shoes and blood poured from them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arrival in April 
</P>
<P>
He believes it will be tougher this time. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be facing windchill factors," he said. "I will have to face mountain 
ranges you have never dreamed about. Inclines that are almost straight up. And 
deserts. What I got to do ain't easy." He has timed the trip to arrive in 
Washington in April, Cancer Awareness Month. 
</P>
<P>
But he will attempt it because he believes there is not enough education about 
early detection of cancer. When his mother died in 1970, Croker said the doctor 
told him that if she had come to him a year earlier, she would have still been 
alive. Croker remembers saying, "Doctor, as long as I live I'm going to do 
something about it." 
</P>
<P>
Croker will walk through Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, 
Tennessee, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and West Virginia. Among the 
cities and towns he will stop in will be San Diego, Phoenix, Dallas, Pecos, 
Tex., Arkadelphia, Ark., Nashville, St. Louis, Chicago, Indianapolis, 
Cincinnati, and Cumberland, Md. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trip Coordinator 
</P>
<P>
He will be accompanied by a friend, Bob Dill, who will drive a motor home. 
Hawaiian Gardens Councilman Don Schultze, coordinator of the trip, plans to 
arrange the publicity in towns before Croker arrives. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen a man that has the determination he has for a cause that he 
gets absolutely nothing from monetarily," Schultze said of Croker. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never made a penny from this," Croker said. "I've never asked for money, 
but this time I'm gonna ask. 
</P>
<P>
Schultze said it would take about $25,000 to cover the expenses of the walk. He 
said that although he has received commitments of about $10,000 in donations, 
"I think we'll end up with enough." 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, despite fund-raisers in Hawaiian Gardens and donations from people 
along the way, Croker still entered some towns with just $5. 
</P>
<P>
Croker, who is married and has a 4-month-old daughter, works at a service 
station in Lakewood for $5 an hour. He talked about his crusade one morning 
last week while he was wiping down cars after they had gone through the 
station's car wash. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't look at it as incredible, 'cause I've been walking all my life," he 
said. "Never had a car, never had a driver's license. People say, 'How do you 
do it?' They can't believe good old hard work and dedication will get it done." 
</P>
<P>
He knows what to expect: bleeding feet, numb legs and hands, incredible 
exhaustion, and, unlike before, winter. 
</P>
<P>
"This time around I'm scared," he said. "But I'm not going to quit."

EARNING A MEASURE OF RESPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM FARMER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tom Parada's basketball warm-ups drape over his 5-foot, 2-inch, 110-pound frame 
like a kimono. A basketball seems disproportionately large in his hands. At 
first glance, the St. Francis High student looks less like a varsity starter 
and more like a dribbling-drill pylon -- a mere speed bump between a 6-2 guard 
and a field goal. 
</P>
<P>
However, Parada's most valuable commodity on the court might be the tool he 
lacks: size. 
</P>
<P>
St. Francis Coach John Jordan says Parada has become a lure of sorts -- 
enticing prey for opportunistic teams. But their plans usually falter. 
</P>
<P>
"Opposing coaches tell me that one of the dumbest things they've done is try to 
attack his height," Jordan said. "It just takes them right out of the flow of 
the game." 
</P>
<P>
Parada, a senior, is the Golden Knights' starting point guard and averages 8 
points and 8 assists a game. He says he has yet to have a shot blocked this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Because of a wealth of talent at the guard position last season, Parada was 
used sparingly. And at 4-10, he might have been the shortest varsity player in 
the Southern Section. 
</P>
<P>
Parada has since grown 4 inches and he worked on improving his game to the tune 
of 5 hours of basketball a day during the summer. Still, some of Parada's 
teammates thought it unlikely that he would make a sizable impact this season. 
</P>
<P>
Even close friends on the team, such as Allen Freemon, were skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
"To be honest I was one of the guys who said it's not going to work but he made 
a believer of me," Freemon said. "He's remarkable." 
</P>
<P>
Parada, 17, has learned to accept doubters. He adheres to the maxim: You don't 
command respect, you earn it. However, Parada's first task was bolstering his 
self image. During his sophomore season, when he was demoted from the junior 
varsity to the sophomore team, his confidence took a pounding akin to being 
dribbled on an asphalt court. 
</P>
<P>
And an episode in practice last season didn't help his bruised confidence any. 
After each practice the team was divided into small groups. Each group would 
compete in a free-throw contest and the losing teams would run sprints. 
</P>
<P>
In one such drill, Parada had to make a free throw to seal his group's victory. 
He stepped up to the line, set and released a shot that fell 5 feet short of 
the rim. 
</P>
<P>
Parada's group groaned. The rest of the team roared. 
</P>
<P>
"I was concentrating and my hands were slippery," Parada reasoned. Though he 
says he laughed along, teammates say Parada was sensitive about the incident 
long after it happened. 
</P>
<P>
Playing pickup games in Westwood helped Parada's confidence. His brother Robert 
attends UCLA and hangs out with Bruin basketball players. And unlike his St. 
Francis teammates, Tom has gotten the opportunity to play full-court games with 
Division I talents such as UCLA point guard Pooh Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson admits he was startled by Parada's deft ball handling and shooting. 
"He can play, man," said Richardson, adding he has no qualms about choosing 
Parada for his pickup team. "The first time we played together he passed the 
ball behind his back. I was laughing, but he's real good." 
</P>
<P>
Players less discriminating than Richardson are impressed by Parada's ability 
to thread a no-look pass through a group of defenders. 
</P>
<P>
"He's gotten me the ball when there are five guys between us," Freemon said. 
"Anybody can shoot, but the way he gets the people the ball is amazing." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Parada recently had his best game against Loyola, the tallest team 
in the Del Rey League. The Cubs (16-2) are in first place and are ranked fourth 
in the Southern Section 5-AA Division. 
</P>
<P>
At one point during the game, Parada made a defensive switch and wound up 
guarding 6-10 Ryan Jamison, the tallest player in league. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody in the stands was laughing," Parada said. "He was laughing, too. If 
he would have put it on the ground I would have ripped him." 
</P>
<P>
Later, Parada lined up along the key next to Jamison on a free-throw attempt. 
"I looked up at him and said, 'My board,' " Parada mused. Jamison's 20-inch 
height advantage won out, however. 
</P>
<P>
Though St. Francis lost, Parada scored 17 points. Afterwards, Loyola Coach Bill 
Thomason read the Knights' statistics to his players. Hearing of Parada's 
offensive output didn't faze the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
"I said he got 17 and nobody said, 'That guy? He scored 17?' " Thomason said. 
"They just shook their heads and said, 'Hey, he can really score.' He 
definitely won our respect." 
</P>
<P>
Other league coaches have been equally impressed by Parada. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of teams think they can get all over this guy and tear him up," Crespi 
Coach Paul Muff said. "We put people right up on him but he handles that size 
situation so well. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time I saw him he was on the sophomore team and I don't think 
anybody at the time could see this guy playing varsity ball and starting for 
them. It's refreshing to see a guy that size do as well as he has against good 
competition." 
</P>
<P>
Parada says he would like to play college ball at Loyola Marymount because, 
"the game is so up tempo that there would be no time to get in a halfcourt 
offense." 
</P>
<P>
And though the chances of Parada playing at that level are, at best, remote, he 
is unswayed. 
</P>
<P>
He has learned to deal with doubters.

ILLNESS KEEPS BATEMAN, LEWIS OUT OF SUNKIST TRACK MEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Morgan Bateman and Brent Lewis of Crescenta Valley High were forced to withdraw 
from last Friday's Sunkist Invitational at the Sports Arena because of illness, 
according to Falcon track Coach Keith Gilliland. 
</P>
<P>
Bateman, the defending Southern Section 4-A Division champion in the 800 
meters, contracted the flu 2 days before the meet and Lewis, who tied for 
second in the pole vault in last spring's Southern Section finals, was 
sidelined with mononucleosis. 
</P>
<P>
"The doctor advised us to keep Brent out of the meet," Gilliland said. "He said 
if he jumped, there was a chance of rupturing his spleen." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, who cleared 14 feet, 6 inches as a junior, is expected to be sidelined 
for another 3 to 4 weeks. Bateman could resume training later this week. 
</P>
<P>
Bateman, who has a personal best of 1:52.66 in the 800 and ran faster than 1:54 
in 5 races last season, may concentrate on the 1,500 this season. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, Morgan always said he was strictly an 800 runner," Gilliland 
said. "But this year, he's talking about possibly moving up to the 1,500. 
That's the event that he's best suited for." 
</P>
<P>
Bateman finished eighth in last year's state championships at 800 meters and is 
the state's fourth-fastest returning runner in that event. He ran a best of 
3:59.58 in the 1,500 as a junior.

LOPEZ TRANSFERS TO GLENDALE FOR SPRING SEMESTER 
</P>

Ronnie Lopez, who started at quarterback for Pierce College last season, 
enrolled for the spring semester at Glendale on Tuesday and said he expects to 
play football next season for the Vaqueros. 
</P>
<P>
His body may say otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez underwent surgery Dec. 28 to repair torn ligaments in his right shoulder 
sustained in a game against Santa Monica. Lopez is in rehabilitation therapy 
and said he will not be able to throw a football until June. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Lopez led Franklin High to the City Section 3-A Division title and was 
named 3-A player of the year. He did not receive a scholarship offer from a 
4-year school because, in part, of low Scholastic Aptitude Test scores. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez said his decision to transfer was based on the long daily commute from 
Eagle Rock to Woodland Hills and that former Franklin teammates Anthony Navarro 
and Juan Cardona play for Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
At Pierce, Lopez completed 66 of 163 passes for 921 yards and 6 touchdowns and 
threw 9 interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez will face an uphill battle to start at Glendale. "Darren Fitzgerald is 
definitely our No. 1 guy right now," said Sid Stark, the Glendale quarterbacks 
coach.

NEARLY THREE YEARS BETWEEN BASKETS; 
</P>
<P>
PREP STAR HAD BUMPY ROAD TO SUCCESS AT CAL STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
When Trisha Maly of Cal State Los Angeles scored her first basket in the 
opening half of a game against Cal Lutheran on Jan. 3, it ended a long scoring 
drought for the junior forward. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly three years, to be more specific. 
</P>
<P>
That was in February of 1986 -- the last time Maly had appeared in a college 
basketball game -- and she was playing for Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
But by the time the game against Cal Lutheran was over, Maly had scored 20 
points and hardly seemed to have lost a step. 
</P>
<P>
In her first five games since joining the Golden Eagles, the 22-year-old Maly 
has averaged a team-high 15.8 points and has made 66% of her field goals and 
92.9% of free throws. 
</P>
<P>
From all appearances, the return of the attractive 6-0 and 145-pound blonde to 
college basketball has been as smooth as silk. 
</P>
<P>
Only Maly was all too familiar with the difficulties in her past that brought 
her to this point. 
</P>
<P>
After an outstanding prep career at Mark Keppel High in Alhambra, where she had 
earned All-CIF Southern Section and All-San Gabriel Valley honors in 1984, Maly 
was recruited by UC Berkeley, Arizona, Arizona State, UC Santa Barbara, Hawaii 
and Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
There was an instant attraction to Pepperdine, though. "I went to Pepperdine on 
a recruiting trip and it was just beautiful," Maly remembers. "So I decided to 
go there, and I thought everything was great." 
</P>
<P>
By the end of her freshman season with the Waves, when she had emerged as a 
starting forward, Maly appeared to have a bright future at the school. 
</P>
<P>
However, shortly into her sophomore season, Maly's basketball career began to 
turn into a nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
"It started after the season started and, little by little, the coach (Ron 
Fortner) and I weren't getting along personality-wise," she said. "We had 
meetings but we couldn't work it out." 
</P>
<P>
It was starting to affect her class work, she said. An excellent student in 
high school and at the start of college, Maly said she received low grades in 
her sophomore year at Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
That's when she decided to leave. 
</P>
<P>
"I even tried to talk to the school president," she said. "But when we couldn't 
work it out I just decided to leave." 
</P>
<P>
After her experience at Pepperdine, Maly kept her distance from school and 
basketball for most of the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
Her basketball playing was limited to occasional pickup games in the park. "I 
played a little at the parks and I worked out at Jack LaLanne's to stay in 
shape," Maly said. 
</P>
<P>
Much of her time was spent as a cocktail waitress, usually earning tips of $100 
or more a night, she said. She was doing so well financially that she bought a 
BMW luxury car, she recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Although she enjoyed her work, she was starting to think about returning to 
college. "The money was great," she said. "But I got to realize that you can't 
make a career out of it." 
</P>
<P>
She also received a friendly push from her parents to return to school. "I have 
two older sisters (Keelie, 27, and Inger, 25) and they graduated from college, 
so my parents were encouraging me to go back to school." 
</P>
<P>
So she decided to inquire in December about attending school and playing 
basketball at Cal State Los Angeles, which was close to her parents' home in 
Monterey Park. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Fran Buckless, whose team was suffering from injuries, was more than 
happy to run an eligibility check with the NCAA for Maly. 
</P>
<P>
"It was right before the second quarter (of classes) began and she had 
approached me about what her eligibility was, so we checked it out," Buckless 
said. "I think we had an opportunity to give her an opportunity and we were 
very glad for that." 
</P>
<P>
When she started practicing with the team Jan. 2, she discovered how much she 
had missed the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I missed the camaraderie most," Maly said. "I missed being a part of the team. 
Plus all my friends were athletes and all the guys I dated were athletes. So I 
was used to hanging around in those circles. 
</P>
<P>
"I also missed just feeling good about my talents, and now I have confidence in 
my play. It's been very good for my ego. When you're part of a team you feel 
special. You feel like you belong somewhere and I like that feeling." 
</P>
<P>
At first, Maly concedes she was concerned that she would have problems similar 
to those at Pepperdine. But she has been quick to establish a good relationship 
with the coaches and teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"They really helped me get started and worked with me," Maly said. "Tina 
(Slatinsky, a teammate) took me under her wing and told me what classes to take 
and she's like my best friend. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been like heaven to me because it was such a bad experience at 
Pepperdine, and now to have such a positive experience here is so wonderful. . 
. . I was thinking that maybe the girls wouldn't accept me because they were 
already together and here was this new girl coming in and taking away their 
playing time. But because of injuries and because we didn't really have a set 
lineup, it has worked out well." 
</P>
<P>
For that matter, Buckless has had nothing short of glowing praise for Maly 
since she joined the squad. 
</P>
<P>
"We needed her type of player to come into our program and it's worked out real 
well," Buckless said. "She's just fit well into our team's philosophy and she's 
just a very unselfish player. She's also a super person all-around and we're 
real pleased to have her." 
</P>
<P>
The coach said she has been surprised at how fast Maly has picked up her team's 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
"She's a very bright person and she picks up things very quickly in terms of 
basketball terminology," Buckless said. "She picks up things and makes changes 
well. I think she's been in a situation where she's tried to come in and learn 
the system, and she's done a good job." 
</P>
<P>
Maly says her experience with the Golden Eagles has been a far cry from the 
despair she was feeling before she left Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
"It was starting to break me down," she said. "I was doubting myself as a 
basketball player and I was wondering, 'Is he right? Maybe he is right.' " 
</P>
<P>
Now she uses her bad memories of Pepperdine as a motivating factor. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of things that motivate me, but one big thing is I want to get 
my confidence back and show him (Fortner) that he was wrong about me. I want to 
show that I'm a pretty good basketball player. I'm not just a pretty girl 
running around in a basketball uniform." 
</P>
<P>
While she doesn't dwell on her appearance, Maly is hardly just another pretty 
face. She was selected Miss Monterey Park in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Since she started her college career, she has heard her share of whistles and 
complimentary calls from fans during games. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't gotten so much here because I've played only five games," she said. 
"But I get used to it. I'd hear things like, 'Don't mess up your hair or don't 
smear your makeup.' " 
</P>
<P>
Maly said she is fortunate to have teammates such as center Lupe Quintana and 
Slatinsky. 
</P>
<P>
"With Tina, Lupe and me, they call us Charlie's Angels," she says. "We all try 
to curl our hair and wear makeup and look good. It's kind of like proving a 
point. You don't have to be all muscular to play basketball. You can still be 
feminine and play basketball well." 
</P>
<P>
Maly says the fact that she wore makeup and wanted to look good for games may 
have been a sore point with her coach at Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
But Buckless doesn't mind at all. If anything, the coach encourages it and says 
that Maly has a bright future with the Golden Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing I really like about Trisha is she's bright enough and wants to live 
up to the challenges in her life," Buckless said. "I think you'll see nothing 
but great things from her. Each day she improves a little, and I think she just 
wants to get better and better." 
</P>
<P>
With a new lease on her basketball life, Maly is also confident that she will 
finish her college career a lot happier than when she started.

GOLDEN EAGLE WOMEN CAGERS BID TO STAY IN TITLE RACE IN GAMES TODAY, SATURDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With its first victory of the conference season, the Cal State Los Angeles 
women's basketball team could stay close to the California Collegiate Athletic 
Assn. leaders in games today and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Eagles, 1-1 in the CCAA and 10-8 overall, play host to Cal State 
Dominguez Hills at 5:45 p.m. today and visit Chapman at 5:45 p.m. Saturday. 
Dominguez Hills is 1-2 in the CCAA and 5-9 overall. Chapman is 2-1 and 7-9. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Poly Pomona is in first place in the conference at 3-0 and Cal State 
Northridge is 2-0. But Cal State L.A. has won four of its last five games, 
including an 89-62 conference victory over Cal Poly San Luis Obispo last week. 
</P>
<P>
Leading the resurgence for the Golden Eagles is the tall front line of center 
Lupe Quintana and forwards Trisha Maly and Tina Slatinsky, all 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
Maly, a junior, has averaged a team-high 15.8 points since joining the team 
five games ago; Quintana is averaging 14.7 points and a team-leading 9.9 
rebounds and Slatinsky 10.1 points and seven rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Quintana needs five rebounds against Dominguez Hills to become the conference's 
career rebounding leader. A four-year starter, she has 461 rebounds and should 
surpass all-time leader Vickie Mitchell of Cal Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Hills, led by forward Khyra Anderson (6-2) and guard Devon Akita 
(5-8), has struggled under first-year Coach Van Girard. Anderson is averaging 
9.5 points and 11.8 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Eagles should receive a strong test from Chapman, a 77-62 loser to 
Pomona last week. Chapman has been paced by guard Corine Sandfry (5-8), who 
averages 14.6 points, and forward Kim Rieff (6-0). 
</P>
<P>
It was a short stay at the top of the NCAA Division II rankings for the Cal 
Poly Pomona women's basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
Despite defeating Chapman, 77-62, and Cal State Dominguez Hills, 83-51, last 
week the Broncos have dropped from first to fourth in the rankings. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona will take a 14-4 record and 3-0 mark in the California Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. into its conference game against Cal Poly San Luis Obispo at 
5:45 p.m. Saturday in Kellogg Gym. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona Coach Darlene May said her team has been making steady progress. 
</P>
<P>
"We had some good efforts against both Chapman and Dominguez Hills last week," 
May said. "Our overall game is most effective when we play well defensively, 
and I think we did that for the most part last week." 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos received outstanding offensive performances from center Niki 
Bracken (6-2) and point guard Cathy Gooden (5-5), all-conference players who 
combined for 50 points against Chapman. 
</P>
<P>
Bracken is averaging a team-leading 18.8 points and 8.4 rebounds while Gooden 
averages 15.3 points and 5.9 assists. The Broncos also start Susan Luckinbill 
(5-9) and Stephanie Coons (5-10) at forward and Carrie Egan (5-8) at guard. 
</P>
<P>
They will face a San Luis Obispo team that has struggled to marks of 8-8 
overall and 0-2 in the conference. The Mustangs have been led by All-CCAA guard 
Jody Hasselfield (5-5), who averages 12.3 points, and forward Deborah Vettel 
(5-9). 
</P>
<P>
The Cal State Los Angeles baseball team will open its season at USC for a 
non-conference game at 2:30 p.m. Friday at Dedeaux Field. 
</P>
<P>
After finishing its last California Collegiate Athletic Assn. season at 16-14 
-- its first winning conference record in eight years -- Coach John Herbold has 
high hopes. "but everything has to go right for us." 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Eagles lost three juniors from last season to the major league 
baseball draft but have five starters returning from a 25-30 team. 
</P>
<P>
Topping the list are third baseman Brad Mengel, who hit .335 as a junior; 
outfielder Rex De La Nuez, who hit .325 as a sophomore and had a team-high 44 
runs batted in, and senior second baseman Ed Pimental, who hit .322. 
</P>
<P>
The pitching staff figures to be led by junior right-hander Steve McGovern and 
sophomore left-hander Abdom Pinon.

BIPARTISANSHIP GOAL IN SENATE FOREIGN AGENDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA FRITZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seized by the spirit of bipartisanship for which President Bush appealed on 
Inauguration Day, Senate Democrats and Republicans on Wednesday laid out 
similar legislative agendas and pledged to end the constant bickering over 
foreign policy that has characterized their relations with the White House over 
the last eight years. 
</P>
<P>
"We are here to make a new start," declared Senate Majority Leader George J. 
Mitchell (D-Me.) in a floor speech. "In his inaugural address, the President 
put his hand out to me and to the Speaker of the House. I now extend mine to 
him." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cabinet Members Confirmed 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell's words opened the first full day of Senate business -- a day devoted 
to long speeches, an avalanche of new legislation and roll call votes 
confirming three Bush Cabinet appointees: Secretary of State James A. Baker 
III, Secretary of Labor Elizabeth Hanford Dole and Budget Director Richard G. 
Darman. 
</P>
<P>
During the 101st Congress, Mitchell said, the Democratic majority is committed 
to enacting legislation that would provide better housing, child care and 
health care; fully fund existing anti-drug legislation; improve air quality; 
increase the minimum wage; reform campaign financing; establish a system of 
national voluntary service and set new ethical standards for people who serve 
in government. 
</P>
<P>
Responding for the GOP, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) listed many of 
the same goals, though he acknowledged that his party has different ideas of 
how these objectives should be achieved. He also noted that Republicans are 
awaiting Bush's legislative plan, which he is expected to outline in a speech 
to Congress Feb. 9. 
</P>
<P>
Barely mentioned in any of these speeches was what most members of Congress 
view as the nation's most pressing problem -- the deficit. Both Democrats and 
Republicans will wait for Bush's long-promised proposal for cutting the deficit 
without raising taxes. 
</P>
<P>
The Democrats introduced their proposal for voluntary service, a sweeping plan 
for a "citizens corps" that would work to combat such national problems as 
illiteracy, homelessness and crime in return for cash vouchers that could be 
used for education expense or a down payment on a home. Described by its 
sponsors as an updated version of the GI Bill of Rights, young Americans who 
volunteered for the program would choose either civilian or military service. 
</P>
<P>
The strongest theme running through the remarks of both Mitchell and Dole was 
their common desire to develop a bipartisan foreign policy with Bush instead of 
constantly battling the White House, as they did during the Ronald Reagan 
presidency. The tension between Congress and the President over foreign policy 
reached a peak with the disclosure of the Iran-Contra scandal, which many 
Reagan Administration officials sought to hide from the lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
War Powers Dispute 
</P>
<P>
Both party leaders expressed a desire to revise the controversial 1973 War 
Powers Resolution, which restricts the President from placing American troops 
in "imminent hostilities" for more than 90 days without the consent of 
Congress. No President has ever willingly complied with the law, which 
inevitably precipitates a battle between Congress and the White House whenever 
U.S. forces come under hostile fire. 
</P>
<P>
"Overcoming this stalemate should be a high priority for both Congress and the 
executive," Mitchell said. "Enacting any change in the law will encounter 
strongly held and conflicting views. But the effort should be made (and) . . . 
I believe a constitutionally sound compromise is possible." 
</P>
<P>
Dole concurred. "The time has come to re-examine the war powers resolution,," 
he said, adding that the Administration already has expressed "considerable 
concern" about it. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Mitchell warned that while the Democratic majority in Congress 
wants to be cooperative with Bush on foreign policy initiatives, it will 
continue to insist on being a full partner with the President in shaping policy 
and deciding where force is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Byrd Reintroduces Bill 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.) reintroduced a Democratic measure first offered 
last year that would require consultation between the President and Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Among the most urgent foreign policy issues facing Congress is the spread of 
chemical warfare throughout the world. Both Sens. Dole and Claiborne Pell 
(D-R.I.) said that they would introduce differing bills designed to curtail the 
manufacture of chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
On social programs, Mitchell -- keying off Bush's pledge to bring about a 
"kinder, gentler America" -- declared that the nation and the government are 
entering a new era. "The New Deal and the Reagan reaction to it are over," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
As Mitchell spoke, Democratic senators reintroduced much of the social 
legislation that was left on the calendar when the 100th Congress adjourned, 
including a bill by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) to raise the minimum wage 
to $4.65 an hour and another measure by Sen. Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.) to 
provide subsidized day care -- two pieces of legislation that the party 
leadership intends to push this year. 
</P>
<P>
Although Dole also mentioned raising the minimum wage, Republicans are expected 
to insist on a sub-minimum wage for teen-agers as well, which Democrats oppose. 
Likewise, two Republicans -- Sens. Pete Wilson of California and Pete V. 
Domenici of New Mexico -- offered alternative legislation to Dodd's child-care 
bill, which they estimated would cost $10 billion.

REAGAN SIGNS REPORTED $5-MILLION DEAL FOR 2 BOOKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE BECKLUND, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In one of his first private transactions in eight years, former President 
Ronald Reagan has signed what is believed to be a multimillion-dollar contract 
with Simon &amp; Schuster to write two books, including a volume of memoirs, 
the New York publishing house announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Reagan's California office, his agent, nor Simon &amp; Schuster would 
divulge the amount of the contract. However, publishing sources reported it to 
be in the neighborhood of $5 million for the two volumes. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many major books, the memoirs were not put up for auction. Simon &amp; 
Schuster held first negotiating rights to the prestigious contract under a 
decade-old option stemming from a book contract it had with Reagan in the 
1970s, according to Richard E. Snyder, the firm's chairman and chief executive 
officer. That book was never written, because Reagan was elected President. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan signed the contract at his Bel-Air home on Sunday afternoon, less than 
48 hours after leaving Washington, said Morton Janklow, the New York attorney 
and literary agent representing him. However, he said, terms of the agreement 
had been under negotiation for the last few months without Reagan's knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Reagan) didn't even know about this (the negotiations) until Saturday," 
Janklow said in an interview Wednesday. "This was something that was done by 
his blind trustee and me." The trustee, attorney George T. Scharffenberger, was 
appointed to handle Reagan's financial affairs while he was in office to avoid 
the appearance of conflicts of interest. 
</P>
<P>
The first of the two books, to be released in 1990, will be the text of his 
speeches placed in what the publisher called their "historical context," with 
personal comments by Reagan on the events leading up to each. 
</P>
<P>
The second, to be published in 1991, will be his memoirs. "I think this will be 
more philosophical and more anecdotal than many presidential memoirs have 
been," Janklow said. "I don't think he plans to rewrite the definitive history 
of the Reagan Administration. He's going to talk about the philosophical ideas 
he represented and their impact on the American people." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if Reagan planned to write his own memoirs with a co-author or ghost 
writer, Janklow said no. "He may have an editorial assistant," he said, "but 
there have been no negotiations with anyone." 
</P>
<P>
Reagan made no personal comment on the contract through his Century City office 
Wednesday. In a Simon &amp; Schuster press release he said: "This will be an 
honest and straightforward look at where we have been with some thoughts on 
where we are going. . . . I've got my pen in hand and I'm ready to get 
started." 
</P>
<P>
Pen in hand? 
</P>
<P>
The phrase, according to Simon &amp; Schuster's vice president of public 
relations, Julia Knickerbocker, was "figurative." Asked if the former President 
could type, she laughed. "We never asked," she said. The answer, according to 
Mark Weinberg, director of public affairs on the Reagan staff here, is "no." He 
is expected to dictate at least part of his memoirs. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan is the author of one previous book, "Where's the Rest of Me?" that was 
published in 1965 in collaboration with the late author-screenwriter Richard G. 
Hubler. That book, named after a famous line in the Reagan movie "Kings Row," 
is a simple, personal history laden with anecdotes describing Reagan's rise and 
subsequent hard times as an actor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
History Project in Works 
</P>
<P>
One authoritative history of the Reagan Administration is already in the works. 
That project, by Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Edmund Morris, reportedly 
brought $3 million after Morris was given unprecedented access to Reagan while 
he was still in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
Until Wednesday, it was not publicly known whether Reagan even was represented 
by a literary agent. At least two other well-known Beverly Hills agents -- 
Norman R. Brokaw, co-chairman of the board of the William Morris Agency, who 
represented former President Gerald R. Ford and his wife, Betty, and Irving 
(Swifty) Lazar -- were believed to be vying for the Reagan memoirs. 
</P>
<P>
However, the nod went to Janklow of New York, who represents Nancy Reagan on 
the book of memoirs she is now finishing. That book, which is scheduled to be 
published by Random House this fall, reportedly brought the former First Lady 
$2 million. Author Bill Novak is collaborating with her on the book. 
</P>
<P>
One curious aspect of Reagan's presidential memoirs is that they are being 
published by the same publisher -- and edited by the same editor -- as the 
highly publicized and unauthorized biography of Nancy Reagan by Washington 
biographer Kitty Kelley. 
</P>
<P>
Kelley, who specializes in writing unglamorous portraits of glamorous people, 
including Frank Sinatra and Jacqueline Onassis, is not expected to produce a 
flattering portrait of the former First Lady. Her contract for the Reagan book 
reportedly brought her more than $3.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Editing both books is Michael Korda, the editor-in-chief of Simon &amp; 
Schuster who is known for his flamboyance, his salesmanship and a handful of 
self-help books, including "Power! How to Get It, How to Use It." He could not 
be reached for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the Reagans had any misgivings about the same publishing house 
handling the two books roughly at the same time, Weinberg said, "We don't 
comment on anybody else's book." He also declined to discuss terms of the 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
Several publishing houses had expressed interest in the memoirs of the popular 
President, and at least one, the Putnam Berkeley Group, made a "very 
substantial offer," a Putnam official said Wednesday. Estimates of the value of 
the memoirs had ranged between $2 million and $10 million before reports 
sweeping New York publishing sources late Wednesday put the price of the two 
books at a reported $5 million. That figure, however, was not confirmed 
officially. 
</P>
<P>
"People are surprised it was only $5 million," said Esther Newberg, vice 
president and co-director of the literary arm of International Creative 
Management, a major Hollywood and literary agency. 
</P>
<P>
"If you get $1 million for an ex-general like Al Haig, $5 million doesn't seem 
like much for someone who left office the most popular President in years." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reagan Keeps Screen Rights 
</P>
<P>
Simon &amp; Schuster will retain world rights to both hardback and paperback 
editions of the books, Snyder said. Screen rights "were retained by the 
President," as is customary for such books, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Books written by the most recent U.S. Presidents, Jimmy Carter and Ford, did 
not prove financial successes. Publishing sources said both books fared less 
well than did books authored by their wives, Rosalynn Carter and Betty Ford. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he was concerned that the same might happen with Reagan's 
memoirs, Snyder responded: "Ronald Reagan is the most popular and important 
President since F.D.R. and we have every right to believe it will do very 
well."

FEE ON SAVINGS IS DEFENDED BY BUSH; 
</P>
<P>
SAYS TREASURY PLAN TO AID S&amp;LS IS NOT A TAX; LAWMAKERS ASSAIL IDEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush on Wednesday defended a controversial Treasury Department 
proposal to charge 25 to 30 cents for every $100 on deposit in banks and 
savings and loan institutions, but members of Congress angrily denounced the 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
Bush insisted that the Treasury plan, designed to raise funds to help bail out 
failing savings institutions, would not violate his pledge against raising 
taxes. "Is it a tax when the person pays the fee to go to Yosemite Park?" he 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Congress, however, insisted that the Treasury proposal is nothing 
less than a tax on bank and S&amp;L deposits -- and an unpalatable one at that. 
</P>
<P>
The suggestion, which would require congressional approval, "only serves to 
scare depositors into withdrawing their federally insured funds and putting 
them into the nearest money market fund," said House Banking, Finance and Urban 
Affairs Committee Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Calls It 'Wrongheaded' 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), a Banking Committee member, added: "Not only 
is it a tax, it is a wrongheaded tax. It makes bad economic sense and bad 
political sense, and that usually means it won't go anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
The fee on savings deposits "hasn't come to me in a formal recommendation," 
Bush told reporters from the New York Times and the Houston Post, who 
interviewed him in the Oval Office Wednesday morning. "I'm receptive to any 
idea that will solve this problem. I'm not receptive to a tax increase." 
</P>
<P>
The fee proposal, which would raise $5 billion to $9 billion a year, is one of 
a series of ideas that Treasury is preparing for President Bush to deal with 
the savings and loan crisis. A fee is attractive to Treasury officials because 
it would lessen the need to tap scarce taxpayer dollars to meet the S&amp;L 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Estimates of the cost of closing or merging insolvent S&amp;Ls and making good 
on federally insured deposits run upwards of $100 billion. The government could 
raise the money by issuing bonds and use the billions of dollars collected from 
the fee on savings deposits toward paying the annual interest on the bonds. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed deposit fee, however, immediately ran afoul of the rule laid down 
last week by Richard G. Darman, who was confirmed by the Senate Wednesday as 
Bush's budget director, that anything that looks like a tax violates Bush's 
campaign pledge not to raise taxes. Darman offered his version of the "duck 
test" -- what looks like a duck and quacks like a duck is in fact a duck. 
</P>
<P>
"If it looks like a tax to ordinary Americans, then it is a tax and the new 
President will oppose it," Darman said. "At the point you get a significant 
dollar amount, it's virtually guaranteed (that) the American people will view 
it as a tax and it will flunk the duck test." 
</P>
<P>
Donald G. Ogilvie, executive vice president of the American Bankers Assn., 
applied Darman's test to the Treasury's proposal and denounced it as "a thinly 
disguised duck -- a tax by any other name." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seen as 'Gross Injustice' 
</P>
<P>
"Taxing bank customers to bail out the savings and loan industry would be a 
gross injustice," he said. "Ford wasn't asked to bail out Chrysler, Newark 
(N.J.) wasn't asked to bail out New York, nor should every American consumer 
with a bank account be asked to bail out the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance 
Corp." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio) added: "In my view, this would violate the duck test. 
It is a major increase in revenues, no matter what the Administration calls 
it." 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's ridiculous," said Rep. David Dreier (R-La Verne), a member of the 
House Banking Committee. "They're desperately looking for any place they can to 
get revenues." 
</P>
<P>
Savings institutions already pay an annual fee -- $2.08 for every $1,000 in 
deposits -- into the federal insurance fund that guarantees S&amp;L deposits of 
up to $100,000. Despite that levy, the insurance fund is woefully short of the 
money it needs to protect deposits in failing institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Banks, by contrast, pay an annual fee of 83 cents for every $1,000 into the 
federal insurance that guarantees bank deposits of up to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
The new fee proposed by the Treasury Department would be levied on top of those 
existing charges. And it would be charged not to the banks and S&amp;Ls but 
directly to individual checking and savings accounts, probably according to the 
average annual size of each account. 
</P>
<P>
White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu insisted Wednesday that the existing 
charges have "never, never, never been referred to as a tax." The money paid 
"is a fee for a service that has been traditional and important in the banking 
industry." 
</P>
<P>
The Administration argues that because the fee is not considered a tax when 
paid by banks and S&amp;Ls, it should not be considered a tax when paid 
directly by individual and corporate depositors on their accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Staff writers William J. Eaton and Tom Redburn also contributed to this story.

GATES TO TEST WATERS FOR GOVERNORSHIP BID IN '90 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEITH LOVE, Times Political Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates will announce today that he will form a 
committee to explore his 1990 gubernatorial prospects, The Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
A source familiar with Gates' plans said he will not step down as police chief 
during the exploratory effort but wants to serve notice that others will be 
raising money for him and promoting his candidacy in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
Recent polling by Gates has persuaded him that his name identification in 
vote-rich Southern California, where the chief of police is often on television 
and in the newspapers, would make him a formidable candidate for the Republican 
gubernatorial nomination. 
</P>
<P>
Gates, 62, has been chief since 1978. He succeeded Ed Davis, whose high profile 
in the job helped him win a state Senate seat in 1980 and made him the favorite 
for a while in the 1986 GOP U.S. Senate primary. 
</P>
<P>
Republican consultant Ron Smith, who does not have a client in the governor's 
race, said Wednesday that "Daryl Gates is one candidate who would have the 
credibility to take on Van de Kamp on the issue of law and order." 
</P>
<P>
Smith was referring to Democratic Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp, considered by 
many to be the front-runner for his party's gubernatorial nomination in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Other Republicans pondering a run for governor are U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson, 
baseball commissioner Peter V. Ueberroth and state Sens. William Campbell of 
Hacienda Heights and John Seymour of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to former Rep. Ed Zschau, who barely lost to Democratic U.S. Sen. 
Alan Cranston in 1986, say that Zschau is also considering the governor's race 
after initially ruling it out. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said, "If Wilson or Ueberroth or Zschau don't do it, Gates could very 
well win the nomination." 
</P>
<P>
"The upside for Gates is the name ID he has (in Southern California) and the 
law and order issue," Smith said. "His problem will be getting known in other 
parts of the state and putting together a solid campaign organization." 
</P>
<P>
That was a reference to the fact that Gates has never run for public office, 
and the lack of expertise can be a problem in a high stakes race for governor. 
</P>
<P>
Also in question is whether a Los Angeles police chief's high visibility can be 
translated into a statewide political candidacy. Former Chief Davis tried to 
run for governor in 1978 and failed, and in the 1986 U.S. Senate primary race, 
he finished far back in the GOP pack.

ALLEGED MOLESTATION CANCELS PRIVATE PROGRAM FOR RETARDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HURST, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An alleged sexual molestation incident has led to cancellation of a 
$1.7-million-per-year training program for 138 retarded clients in Orange 
County run by the operator of a chain of group homes that is on state probation 
because of charges of poor care and supervision. 
</P>
<P>
The clients were removed Jan. 18 from a day program run by Edward T. Dawson's 
Social Vocational Services Inc. after a client reported that a stranger had 
masturbated in his presence and fondled him in a restroom at a Garden Grove 
park. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the state Department of Social Services are investigating the 
incident to see if it will affect the status of Dawon's licenses to operate 
nine group homes that are on probation in Southern California. Dawson also runs 
a company called Developmental Services Assn. that operates four group homes 
for the retarded in San Mateo County, which are on probation for alleged abuse, 
poor care or lack of supervision. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Regional Center of Orange County -- the private, nonprofit 
organization that contracts with the state to provide programs for the 
developmentally disabled -- canceled its training-program agreement with Dawson 
after learning of the alleged molestation. 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove police say there is a suspect in the incident but indicate that -- 
like many criminal cases in which the victims are retarded -- the matter is 
difficult to pursue. 
</P>
<P>
"He (the victim) made very confusing and contradictory statements," Lt. Chuck 
Gibbs said. 
</P>
<P>
Elaine Bamberg, executive director of the Orange County regional center, cut 
off Dawson's day program contracts in a sharply worded letter referring to the 
alleged molestation and to previous charges of poor supervision and training 
methods. 
</P>
<P>
"This action," she wrote, "is based upon the program's prior history of 
problems and failure to remedy them and because of an incident that was 
reported on the afternoon of Jan. 18, 1989, involving an alleged assault of a 
Social Vocational client who was inadequately supervised by their staff. For 
these reasons, the center can no longer assure the health, safety and welfare 
of any client attending a Social Vocational Services day program in Orange 
County." 
</P>
<P>
Dawson's Orange County day programs came under criticism last April in a report 
by a consultant to the Orange County regional center who maintained that some 
of the clients were spending the majority of their time in vans or in parks 
rather than being trained to work or to control their behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Dawson complained in a written statement that it was his staff that reported 
the alleged molestation to the regional center and that the client who was 
allegedly victimized was capable of going to the restroom unattended. He said 
the training group was in the park for a lunch break. 
</P>
<P>
"After the client had been in the bathroom for two to three minutes," Dawson 
wrote, "a community member who knew the group came out of the bathroom and 
approached the nearby (Developmental Vocational Services) supervisor. He 
suggested that the supervisor intervene because a man inside was acting 
strangely." 
</P>
<P>
Dawson also implied that Bamberg was trying to solve her own budgetary problems 
by canceling his day program. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to a Times reporter, Dawson said that the "wholesale termination of 
services for the (138) individuals, of even a short duration, would alleviate 
Elaine Bamberg's budget problems and protect her reportedly healthy salary." 
</P>
<P>
Don Sizemore, information director for the Orange County regional center, 
dismissed Dawson's suggestion of a hidden motive of using funds meant for 
client services to pay administrative salaries, pointing out that such a 
maneuver is prohibited by state law. 
</P>
<P>
Sizemore said the funds saved in canceling Dawson's day program would soon go 
to operators of other programs. He said that 30 to 40 of the clients have been 
placed in other programs and that placing the others is "absolutely the No. 1 
priority for us." 
</P>
<P>
As for Dawson's reference to Bamberg's "healthy salary," Sizemore said she 
makes $74,000 a year as head of the center, which is responsible for services 
for 6,000 clients. 
</P>
<P>
Dawson pays himself $110,000 a year and his wife $60,000 for the operation of 
their 16 group homes that house about six clients each and their training 
programs for about 600 clients. 
</P>
<P>
Dawson's Social Vocational Services had received about $1,000 a month each for 
the majority of the clients in the Orange County day program. 
</P>
<P>
After losing the Orange County program, Dawson said he still has 450 clients in 
day programs elsewhere in the state. 
</P>
<P>
His training programs have no workshop centers, such as those used in more 
traditional approaches, but instead rely heavily on transporting clients by van 
to community locations for such activities as distributing leaflets advertising 
the program's yardwork service. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the so-called higher-functioning clients are provided busing jobs in 
fast-food restaurants or cleanup work in car dealerships under the supervision 
of Dawson staff members.

COURT DECIDES GAY CAN SUE CIA OVER SECURITY CLEARANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM MURPHY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal appeals court said Wednesday that there is evidence that the CIA 
routinely denies security clearances to homosexuals and refused to foreclose a 
legal challenge to the agency's practice of considering such applicants on a 
case-by-case basis. 
</P>
<P>
In one of a series of recent rulings restricting government discrimination 
against homosexuals, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a 
lower-court ruling that had prevented an openly gay woman from suing the CIA 
when she was denied a top-level security clearance. 
</P>
<P>
Although the court declined to rule on the constitutionality of any blanket 
policy of withholding clearances from homosexuals, the judges did say there is 
evidence that the CIA has such a policy and held that the woman should be 
allowed to take her challenge to trial. 
</P>
<P>
"We hold a fair-minded trier of fact could reasonably infer from the evidence 
that the CIA considers all persons who engage in homosexual activity to be 
unacceptable security risks," Judge William A. Norris wrote for a three-member 
panel of the court. 
</P>
<P>
Norris, a liberal member of the court who wrote a major opinion last year 
banning homosexual discrimination in the Army, was joined by one of the court's 
most conservative judges, John T. Noonan Jr., and visiting District Court Judge 
Russell E. Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Julie Dubbs, a senior technical illustrator for a San Francisco Bay Area 
defense contractor, SRI International, had held a top secret security clearance 
from the Department of Defense since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
But the CIA denied her an upgraded security clearance to handle intelligence 
information and sophisticated technical systems for collecting intelligence, 
which Dubbs said she needed to continue her job and to apply for promotions at 
SRI. 
</P>
<P>
Dubbs filed suit in federal court, alleging that the CIA has an 
unconstitutional blanket policy of denying security clearances to people who 
engage in homosexual activity, or at least a policy that considers private, 
consensual homosexual conduct a negative factor, while not taking heterosexual 
conduct into consideration, except where promiscuity or extramarital relations 
reflect an applicant's lack of judgment or discretion. 
</P>
<P>
The CIA, which lost a similar case last spring when the U.S. Supreme Court 
ruled it did not have the right to summarily fire a homosexual employee because 
he is considered a security risk, claims it has no blanket policy against 
homosexual conduct but maintains that such a policy, if it existed, would not 
be unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
Government lawyers argued that foreign operatives could use evidence of 
homosexual activity to blackmail the holder of a security clearance. Even 
though Dubbs is openly gay, the CIA said, it is possible that she could have a 
relationship in the future with someone who was seeking to hide their 
homosexuality, thus exposing Dubbs to the possibility of blackmail. 
</P>
<P>
In Dubbs' case, the CIA also raised concerns that she had not immediately 
disclosed her homosexuality, a fact that the agency said "indicates a 
perception of vulnerability on your part" and "raise(s) serious doubts about 
your reliability and your susceptibility to compromise by a hostile 
intelligence service." 
</P>
<P>
The appeals court recognized the CIA's argument that it regards homosexual 
conduct as only one factor in a "whole-person" approach to evaluating security 
clearances. But the court said the agency's own testimony "gives rise to a 
permissible inference that the CIA, in fact, considers all those who engage in 
homosexual conduct to be unacceptable security risks." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Major Argument 
</P>
<P>
The appeals court also rejected one of the government's major arguments, that 
the courts should not be intervening in complex security determinations. 
</P>
<P>
"People who don't make these decisions day in and day out don't have access to 
the big picture factors and should not be second-guessing those who do," one 
Justice Department attorney argued. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Gayer, Dubbs' lawyer, said he will now seek a ruling from the district 
court that the CIA does, in fact, have a blanket policy against security 
clearances for gays and that the policy is, in fact, unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
"The important thing to note here is that the CIA is the only known agency that 
absolutely will not grant a security clearance to a known gay person under any 
circumstances, unlike the Defense Department or even the National Security 
Agency," Gayer said. 
</P>
<P>
Amy Brown, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said lawyers had not yet seen the 
opinion.

SOVIETS HAND OUT EMERGENCY RATIONS IN KABUL

KABUL, Afghanistan 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Soviet soldiers handed out emergency rations Wednesday to Afghans in Kabul, and 
the capital's mayor said his city has a three-month supply of food and fuel in 
case of a guerrilla siege when the Soviet troops are gone. 
</P>
<P>
U.N. aid officials, less optimistic, said much more must be brought in "if 
disaster is to be averted." They were preparing contingency plans. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union said Wednesday it has begun its final troop withdrawal from 
Afghanistan but that it is continuing to fight guerrilla attempts to clamp an 
economic blockade on Kabul. 
</P>
<P>
"The withdrawal process has started," Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. 
Gerasimov told a news conference in Moscow. "I cannot say when it started. But 
it is under way." 
</P>
<P>
Gerasimov also appeared to dispel any doubts that the pullout of the last of 
the Soviet troops will be completed by Feb. 15, the deadline set by last 
April's U.N.-mediated accords on Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it will not end exactly on the 15th, it could end on the 14th," he said. 
"It is not important." 
</P>
<P>
Muslim guerrillas operating along the Salang Highway are attacking supply 
convoys bound for the city as the withdrawal deadline approaches. Soviet cargo 
planes began flying loads of flour and fuel to the capital Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor, Gen. Mohammed M. Hakim, said government soldiers killed 377 
guerrillas Tuesday on the Salang Highway, which runs 250 miles from Kabul north 
to the Soviet border, and the route is now open for convoys. He put the flour 
reserve at 57,000 tons. 
</P>
<P>
Friction over the supply situation has been evident between the government and 
the Soviet military. Maj. Gen. Lev Serebrov, deputy Soviet commander in 
Afghanistan, complained this week that his army has to feed all 2.3 million 
people in the city. He accused the Afghan regime of inefficiency and failing to 
ask for help in time.

GERMAN CURBS UNLIKELY TO HALT TOXIC WEAPONS

<P>
Although the West German government plans to crack down on companies exporting 
supplies that are used in the production of chemical weapons, most analysts 
here believe that export controls will not halt the spread of such weapons. 
</P>
<P>
And while West Germans were deeply embarrassed to learn that their firms were 
once again involved in the manufacture of poison gas, specialists say that 
materials for chemical weapons are too readily available here and elsewhere to 
prevent proliferation. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think export controls will be effective any longer," said one expert 
in strategic studies. "If a country thinks it needs chemical weapons, it will 
get them. The materials are too easy to obtain through ordinary means -- if the 
price is right." 
</P>
<P>
To many U.S. officials, this view of the efficacy of export controls on 
chemical products is pessimistic at best and cynical at worst. It was U.S. 
intelligence sources who came up with the information that Libya was building a 
plant to produce chemical weapons and the U.S. government that first notified 
the West German government that West German companies were supplying the 
materials and expertise. 
</P>
<P>
But in Europe, some officials believe the U.S. insistence on export controls as 
a way to curb the spread of chemical weapons is either naive or hypocritical. 
Such views might go some way to explaining, even if they do not justify, the 
generally lax approach that West Germany has taken toward export controls, 
experts say. 
</P>
<P>
Partly, this is a reflection of the general European attitude that trade 
sanctions are rarely effective against nations: Other countries simply provide 
outlawed goods. The European Community, for instance, did not go along with the 
U.S. sanctions imposed on Libya in 1986 for that country's alleged support for 
terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
Hans-Juergen Muller, an official with the Assn. of Exporters in Hamburg, 
declared in one typical statement: "A country isn't going to tell us, 'We want 
you to build a chemical weapons factory. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Buying Through Brokers 
</P>
<P>
"Instead, it will buy, through brokers, everything it needs: piping, 
compressors, air conditioning, valves and raw materials -- from 10, 20 or 30 
different suppliers. You can't put all these things on an export blacklist." 
</P>
<P>
Another explanation for West Germany's laissez-faire approach, say observers, 
is the country's reliance on exports to fuel its economic powerhouse: More than 
30% of its gross national product is shipped abroad. 
</P>
<P>
The chemical industry has developed into one of West Germany's biggest and 
best, and competition for overseas sales and export of expertise is intense, 
they say. 
</P>
<P>
But the lack of strong export restrictions, officials say, is also due to the 
postwar constitution, which emphasizes the rights of private concerns and has 
encouraged a certain permissiveness on the part of the government. 
</P>
<P>
Then, too, as a result of the constitution, federal supervision of exports -- 
about 1.5 million items a month -- is diffuse. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Economics Agency of the Economics Ministry is the export-licensing 
agency. Its 75 employees have to process 100,000 special applications a year. 
All but a few dozen are approved. 
</P>
<P>
However, violations of the export laws are monitored by the Customs Office, 
which comes under the Finance Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
"Often there is a lack of coordination between the two bureaucracies," 
commented a senior official. 
</P>
<P>
That is not the extent of the bureaucratic confusion. The reports from the 
secret Federal Intelligence Service on the involvement of West German companies 
in the Libyan chemical complex were never forwarded to the Finance Ministry for 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
West Germany, like other European nations, does have controls on exports in 
certain sensitive areas. Armaments such as tanks and artillery, for instance, 
may not legally be exported to "areas of conflict." 
</P>
<P>
"Britain and France are much more lax in exporting arms than West Germany," 
said Muller of the Export Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Exports of nuclear technology must be licensed, but that law has been abused by 
West German exporters in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Exports of electronic technology, particularly to the East Bloc, are restricted 
by the 16-nation, Paris-based, Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export 
Controls. 
</P>
<P>
And the shipment of some chemical technology, too, requires a license. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Dual-Use' Material 
</P>
<P>
However, in the case of chemical technology, controls are complicated by the 
fact that much chemical material is "dual-use" -- that is, the goods being 
exported may be used for benign purposes such as the manufacture of 
pharmaceuticals and pesticides -- as well as for creating a chemical weapons 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
Further, equipment makers do not necessarily ship to end-users but often to 
international brokers who may buy the catalyzers, retorts, tubing and other 
materials, so that manufacturers do not have a clear idea of how their products 
will eventually be used. 
</P>
<P>
Chemical raw materials are also "dual use." For instance, thiosdisglycol is 
used in the manufacture of a dozen ordinary products, from photography 
solutions to ballpoint pens, but it is also used for making mustard gas. 
</P>
<P>
Certain chemicals are "precursors" of poison gas -- that is, they are the 
source of toxic substances or chemicals to make toxic substances -- and half a 
dozen of these are subject to West German export controls. But unscrupulous 
exporters can declare the end-users of precursors to be reputable. 
</P>
<P>
Under German rules, it is the manufacturers who decide whether a product needs 
an export license, and this discretion is easily abused. 
</P>
<P>
But some industry observers say that plugging loopholes will not solve the 
problem of chemical weapons proliferation. 
</P>
<P>
"Today," one analyst said, "a country can get most everything for toxic weapons 
from a Third World country like Brazil." 
</P>
<P>
To curb West German exports of dangerous chemicals, the Kohl government has 
announced stronger enforcement measures, including fines of up to about 
$600,000 and prison terms of up to five years. It has also strengthened the 
investigating staffs and improved cooperation among ministries. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it will be difficult to control the end-user, and as the Export Assn.'s 
Muller put it: "It is simply impossible to stop all goods with a potential 
military use. Materials can be shipped to third countries which don't require 
end-user certificates." 
</P>
<P>
West German manufacturers are defensive about the German chemical industry's 
role in supplying plants in Iraq and Libya, reinforcing a posture that strikes 
some U.S. officials as either unduly complacent or crassly commercial. 
</P>
<P>
"In some cases, the West German supplier companies probably didn't know what 
the end-use would be," a U.S. official here said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the really big chemical companies would become involved in shady 
weapons deals, because their reputations are at stake. But smaller firms might 
be tempted to supply toxic gas. And, unfortunately, that's all it takes."

HIJACK VICTIM WANTED TO SAVE OTHERS, TRIAL TOLD

U.S. Navy diver Robert Dean Stethem said shortly before he was slain on a 
hijacked TWA jetliner that he was ready to die to save the lives of other 
passengers, a witness testified Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Australian Ruth Henderson told a Frankfurt court how she tried to comfort 
Stethem after he had been badly beaten by the hijackers of Trans World Airlines 
Flight 847 in June, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Stethem was later shot to death and his body thrown onto the runway at Beirut 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson, 20, was testifying at the trial of Mohammed Ali Hamadi, a Lebanese 
Shiite Muslim charged with air piracy and murder in the hijacking of the 
Athens-to-Rome flight. 
</P>
<P>
Hamadi has admitted taking part in the hijacking but denies shooting Stethem. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson said she sat next to Stethem on the plane for several hours after 
Stethem, 23, of Waldorf, Md., had been beaten. 
</P>
<P>
The witness, her voice often shaking, said she tried to lift Stethem's spirits 
by talking about everyday things. 
</P>
<P>
"He was quite badly injured and he was crying," she told the court. "His 
injuries included a bleeding head and back. His wrists had been tied very 
tightly and he had no feeling in his hands. His knees and ribs were very sore." 
</P>
<P>
She said Stethem told her he had been kicked in the ribs and knees. 
</P>
<P>
"We talked about unimportant things, about his diving, about Greece. By talking 
about normal things, he seemed to relax and forget the pain. It helped keep 
both our minds off the ordeal," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was unable to light or hold a cigarette and I had to do it for him," she 
continued. "He said that if he lived, he thought his life would never be the 
same again. 
</P>
<P>
"He said how it may be better that he died. He believed that someone would die 
on the plane, someone from the Navy men, and he said that because he was the 
only one who wasn't married, that he should be the one to die. He spoke with a 
clear mind," Henderson testified. 
</P>
<P>
There were six U.S. Navy divers on the plane. Thirty-nine Americans were held 
hostage 17 days during the ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't believe that all of us could get out alive. He felt it was fair that 
he dies so that the rest of us could live," the witness said. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson said she did not know whether Hamadi or an accomplice, Hassan 
Izzaldin, shot Stethem. The accomplice remains at large.

MITCHELL ENDORSES 50% PAY RAISE FOR CONGRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Despite growing opposition in both the Senate and the House, Senate Majority 
Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) Wednesday endorsed the 50% pay increase for 
members of Congress, federal judges and top executive branch officials. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell's endorsement is viewed as important not only because so few 
congressional leaders have spoken out in favor of the increase but also because 
it puts him at odds with the overwhelming majority of senators, who are 
expected to vote against the pay hike. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wanted Smaller Hike 
</P>
<P>
But even Mitchell was timid about the size of the proposed raise, which was 
recommended by a presidential commission and endorsed by former President 
Ronald Reagan before he left office. The majority leader said he had hoped that 
Reagan would propose "a more modest" hike. 
</P>
<P>
"If the choice is this one (50%) or none, I will support the increase," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, which automatically will take effect at midnight Feb. 7 unless 
both the House and Senate vote against it, calls for an increase in salaries 
for members of Congress from $89,500 to $135,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Senate is expected to vote against the pay hike, House Speaker Jim 
Wright (D-Tex.) has privately promised House members that he will delay any 
vote on the pay hike in that chamber until after the deadline -- just as he did 
two years ago when members of Congress received a $12,500 increase. 
</P>
<P>
Publicly, however, Wright has refused to endorse the pay raise and has 
declared: "I will neither encourage nor prevent a vote." 
</P>
<P>
Wright's reluctance to speak out on the issue is understandable in light of the 
deluge of mail that members of Congress are receiving from Americans opposed to 
the pay increase as well as the growing number of members who are speaking out 
against it. Several bills already have been introduced in the House that would 
prohibit the raise from taking effect. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, a dozen senators of both parties pledged to do everything 
possible to repeal the pay increase if it goes into effect, and Sen. Jesse 
Helms (R-N.C.) called on Bush to rescind the proposal. Although Bush promised 
before becoming President that he would have something to say about the pay 
raise, he has been silent on the issue thus far. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Gordon J. Humphrey (R-N.H.), a leading Senate opponent of the pay hike, 
criticized Congress for establishing a system that allows salaries to be raised 
without a vote. 
</P>
<P>
"The sneaky pay raise of 1989 is more than a matter of money," he said. "A pay 
raise without a vote is stealing. A pay raise without a vote is more than mere 
greed, it is debauchery. A pay raise without a vote is more than mere 
cleverness, it is cowardice." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Responds to Pressure 
</P>
<P>
According to sources, Mitchell endorsed the pay raise in response to pressure 
from House Democrats who were angry that their chamber was going to take all of 
the political heat for it. Mitchell said that he could support it as long as it 
was combined with a number of reforms, including a ban on honorariums from 
special interest groups, new ethics legislation and campaign finance reform. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the most outspoken members of Congress favoring the pay hike are 
Californians -- Assistant Majority Leader Tony Coelho (D-Merced) and Rep. Vic 
Fazio (D-Sacramento). Like Mitchell, they view a 50% hike as justified as long 
as Congress simultaneously votes to abolish honorariums. 
</P>
<P>
House members can collect honorariums from special interests equivalent to 30% 
of their congressional salaries and senators can take honorariums equal to 40% 
of their salaries. Critics argue that members are corrupted when they take 
money directly from special interests, even if the money is ostensibly to 
reimburse them for speeches.

FIREBALL OVER NORTHWEST BELIEVED TO BE A METEOR

<P>
A huge fireball was spotted over northwestern Oregon and southern Washington 
Wednesday afternoon, and one expert said it probably was an unusually large 
meteor. 
</P>
<P>
A motorcyclist traveling on a coastal highway reported the sighting to the U.S. 
Coast Guard about 1:30 p.m. Later, dozens of witnesses called in reports to 
radio stations from the coast to south-central Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Spainhower of the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry said that, 
judging from the various descriptions, the fireball was probably a bolide, a 
brilliant meteor that appears to explode as it falls through the atmosphere. 
Some bolides are large enough that unburned portions of them hit the ground as 
meteorites. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses described the fireball as plainly visible on a bright, sunny 
afternoon, and as moving from west to east. Many also reported hearing a sonic 
boom after they saw it. 
</P>
<P>
Spainhower said that if descriptions of the size and the trajectory were 
accurate, the meteorite may have landed somewhere in eastern Washington. 
</P>
<P>
He said that most meteors -- often called shooting stars -- range in size from 
a pea to a walnut and burn up in the air. 
</P>
<P>
Spainhower said that a bolide of such magnitude is very rare, and that anyone 
who saw it should call in reports to help scientists determine if it landed, 
and where. 
</P>
<P>
Navy Cmdr. Doug Gillies, a spokesman for the U.S. Space Command in Colorado 
Springs, Colo., said his agency did not know what the object was.

PSYCHIATRIC DRUGS OFTEN MISUSED IN REST HOMES, SURVEY CONCLUDES

Powerful tranquilizers that can cause dangerous side effects are being given to 
elderly people in rest homes, often by untrained aides without medical 
supervision, a Massachusetts study found. 
</P>
<P>
Such drugs are available only with a doctor's prescription, but many rest home 
residents continue to be given them months or years after a medical 
examination, the principal author of the report said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"It may well be that when they first started getting the stuff they needed it," 
said Dr. Jerry Avorn of the Beth Israel Hospital and Harvard Medical School in 
Boston. "It may be that some people still need it," he said, but without 
follow-up exams there is no assurance that a drug is being used properly. 
</P>
<P>
Medications such as Thorazine and Haldol, designed for treatment of psychotics, 
can cause tardive dyskinesia, a disfiguring and sometimes irreversible side 
effect of uncontrollable facial twitches, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Avorn said that use of such drugs is not being limited to treatment of 
psychoses. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes they are used as sedatives, and that's not a good idea, because they 
will have side effects that outweigh their advantages," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Too large a dose of a psychiatric drug also can aggravate confusion or 
lethargy, thereby increasing the risk that patients will fall and injure 
themselves, Avorn said. 
</P>
<P>
Avorn, with Stephen B. Soumerai of Harvard and Paul Dreyer and Kathleen 
Connelly of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, surveyed 55 rest 
homes in the state. The institutions care for elderly people who are not sick 
enough to be in nursing homes but are too frail to live on their own, Avorn 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The findings were published today in the New England Journal of Medicine.

MANAGEMENT BLAMED FOR A-PLANT ERRORS 
</P>

<P>
Senior officials at the Department of Energy said Wednesday that operator 
errors that damaged pipes and valves in a nuclear reactor at Savannah River in 
South Carolina last weekend point to a persistent, "fundamental management 
problem" that may further delay restarting this crucial weapons production 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
Officials told a congressional hearing that the incident, which followed a 
routine test of the dormant reactor, appeared to have caused no serious damage. 
</P>
<P>
But they voiced concern that the operator errors that led to the mishap -- and 
the failure of plant managers to report the incident for nearly three days -- 
reflected a stubborn complacency toward safety hazards that months of effort 
have failed to root out. 
</P>
<P>
The incident on Sunday, moreover, raised the specter of further delays in 
restarting the reactors, which are the government's only source of tritium gas, 
a component of nuclear weapons that must be replenished periodically. 
</P>
<P>
The several hundred million dollars the government is spending on modernizing 
the plant's three tritium-production reactors as well as the intensive 
retraining of operators "cannot overcome the fundamental management problem" 
that persists at Savannah River, the energy department's chief safety official, 
Richard Starostecki, told the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., which has operated the Savannah River 
facility under government contract since the 1950s, is turning the plant over 
to the Westinghouse Corp. on April 1. Nearly all of the 6,500 employees will 
retain their jobs, however, with only about 40 top managers to be replaced in 
the transition. 
</P>
<P>
Savannah River's three production reactors were shut down last year, initially 
for safety inspections and hardware improvements. But when it took a closer 
look at the plant's management, the energy department found the quality of 
operator training and safety procedures lagged far behind the standards of 
commercial nuclear power plants. 
</P>
<P>
Troy E. Wade II, the energy department official in charge of weapons 
production, told the committee that an extra shift of reactor operators had 
been added at Savannah River so that one shift was constantly undergoing 
training. But he said: "Clearly, this hasn't helped as we thought it would." 
</P>
<P>
The mishap on Sunday involved a routine pressure test on a secondary cooling 
system of the K-reactor, the one officials hope to restart first, this summer. 
The test, which required locking several valves in an open position, was 
completed successfully, Wade said, but then operators forgot to allow one of 
the valves to close.

When the complex cooling system failed to behave normally, operators pumped 
more water into it, over-pressurizing and cracking at least one valve, rather 
than stopping to analyze the problem. This violated a basic safety dictum, 
officials said, that requires an understanding of "off-normal" reactor behavior 
before trying to correct it.

Law enforcement agencies throughout the state favor sharply restricting the 
easy availability of military assault firearms, from an outright prohibition on 
such guns as the AK-47 to stiffer controls on their purchase, a legislative 
study said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that 34% of the law enforcement agencies that 
participated in the study indicated that assault-style rifles are replacing 
handguns as the "weapon of choice" of street gangs and other criminals. 
</P>
<P>
An additional 32% said the assault guns have "augmented" rather than replaced 
revolvers and semiautomatic pistols, creating an even more formidable "firearm 
arsenal of gang and criminal offenders." 
</P>
<P>
However, the study by the Assembly Office of Research found that for 62% of the 
responding agencies, sawed-off shotguns and rifles remain the most common crime 
weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Cary J. Rudman, the principal consultant, conducted the 2 1/2-month study at 
the request of Assemblyman Robert J. Campbell (D-Richmond). He said 
questionnaires were sent to 496 state and local law enforcement agencies 
throughout California. Of those, 206 (41%) responded. 
</P>
<P>
By coincidence, the report was released one week after a gunman mowed down 34 
children and a teacher in a Stockton schoolyard, killing five of the children, 
with an AK-47. It also comes as battle lines are being drawn in the Legislature 
over outlawing such firearms. 
</P>
<P>
The report's immediate impact was unclear, because it appeared to give both 
sides of the controversy additional ammunition. For example, spokesmen for 
gun-owner organizations have long maintained that while semiautomatic military 
weapons may be gaining popularity among criminals, the most popular guns remain 
illegal sawed-off shotguns and civilian firearms. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, advocates of a ban on the sale and manufacture of military 
semiautomatics could cite a finding that during the last five years 63% of the 
agencies reported a "significant increase" in the use of such weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Rudman noted that the survey covered virtually all of the regions of California 
and all kinds of law enforcement agencies -- urban, suburban and rural, police 
and sheriff's departments, district attorneys and campus police forces. 
</P>
<P>
The law-enforcement officials were asked what controls over assault weapons, if 
any, they would recommend to the Legislature and Gov. George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven percent responded that existing controls were adequate or that the 
problem was not guns but "controlling" criminals who use such weapons. However, 
31% favored outright prohibition of the manufacture, sale or possession of 
assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-nine percent favored applying the same restrictions on handguns to 
assault weapons. A handgun purchaser must wait 15 days for the gun while the 
state conducts a background check.

ASSEMBLY DEMOCRAT REVIVES NO-FAULT INSURANCE LEGISLATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Despite voter rejection in November of a no-fault initiative, the chairman of 
the Assembly Finance and Insurance Committee on Wednesday introduced 
legislation that would enact a California no-fault auto insurance system 
modeled on a successful one operating in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal has strong backing from Consumers Union. But its author, 
Assemblyman Patrick Johnston (D-Stockton), acknowledges that it faces an uphill 
battle in the Legislature where opposition from trial lawyers has stymied 
similar efforts for nearly two decades. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Johnston told reporters Wednesday that there is a new recognition 
among lawmakers of the need to control legal costs that drive up insurance 
premiums, which he contends was not accomplished by voter passage of the Ralph 
Nader-backed Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
"If we do not act in 1989," Johnston warned, "there will be another voter 
revolt in 1990." 
</P>
<P>
Johnston's proposal drew cautious support from the insurance industry, which 
spent tens of millions of dollars promoting Proposition 104, its own, less 
generous no-fault proposal that was overwhelmingly defeated on the November 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
But while one insurance spokesman lauded Johnston's proposal as "on the right 
track," industry lobbyists stopped short of an outright endorsement and 
confided that they believe the bill does not go far enough to restrict lawsuits 
and clamp down on medical claims. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Speaker to Offer Own Bill 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) said he will 
introduce his own insurance bill, and officials of the California Trial 
Lawyers' Assn. are unequivocal in their opposition to Johnston's measure. They 
contend that the legislation would increase costs rather than reduce them and 
is actually "an attempt to undermine Proposition 103." 
</P>
<P>
"We just had an election where the people were given an opportunity to choose, 
and they rejected no-fault by 75%," said Will Glennon, the association's legal 
analyst. "Now Pat Johnston and Consumers Union are saying, 'Let's look at 
no-fault again.' It's ironic, to say the least." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Johnston's proposal offers far more generous benefits to motorists and 
is less restrictive of legal rights than the insurance industry's defeated 
ballot initiative. 
</P>
<P>
Under the traditional "tort liability" system used in California and 24 other 
states, the negligent driver's insurance company must reimburse the innocent 
party in an accident. 
</P>
<P>
With no-fault, motorists are compensated for injuries by their own insurance 
companies no matter who is at fault. Costs are reduced because lawsuits are 
prohibited unless injuries are particularly serious or medical bills exceed a 
certain limit. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston's legislation would provide up to $50,000 in medical benefits, $3,000 
for funeral costs and up to $2,000 per month for three years to compensate for 
lost wages. It also would allow "reasonable and necessary" payments for child 
care and other services up to a maximum of $50 daily for one year. 
</P>
<P>
To cut costs, the legislation would allow lawsuits only when the total loss 
exceeds the $50,000 maximum medical benefit or in the case of a "serious 
injury." 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Proposition 104 would have allowed a maximum of $10,000 in medical 
benefits, $15,000 in lost wages and $5,000 in funeral costs, with no provisions 
for other expenses incurred by an accident victim. The insurance 
industry-sponsored initiative would also have made it much more difficult to 
sue, allowing a case to go to court only when an injury is "both serious and 
permanent." 
</P>
<P>
Voter passage of Proposition 103 does not prohibit the adoption of a no-fault 
system. Moreover, when combined with Proposition 103's stringent regulation of 
the insurance industry, Johnston's proposal would result in a system that 
closely mirrors New York's. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New York Plan 
</P>
<P>
According to New York insurance officials, the adoption of that state's 
no-fault system prompted an 80% reduction in the volume of lawsuits and a 
significant increase in the amount of each premium dollar that goes to accident 
victims. Premiums also rise more slowly than in many other states although New 
York remains the seventh most costly state in which to buy auto insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Harry Snyder, West Coast director of Consumers Union, conceded that Johnston's 
proposal, like New York's system, is unlikely to actually reduce premiums. But 
he contended that it will keep rates from raising as rapidly as they might 
otherwise, "and that is very significant in itself." 
</P>
<P>
Although there are sharp differences between Johnston's proposal and the 
defeated no-fault initiative, the insurance industry's unsuccessful campaign to 
sell its ballot measure as New York-style no-fault may confuse some lawmakers 
and make it more difficult for Johnston to win support for his proposal. The 
trial lawyers, whose fees from lawsuits would be jeopardized by any no-fault 
system, were quick to capitalize on that point. 
</P>
<P>
"The insurance industry spent $70 million, mostly aimed at selling Proposition 
104 as New York no-fault," said the association's Glennon. "(Johnston's) 
proposal will be washed out by that campaign." 
</P>
<P>
Johnston will also not be able to count on support from Speaker Brown, a trial 
lawyer loyalist. The plan Brown said he will introduce would continue the 
present system but would require that injury claims for less than $50,000 be 
submitted to arbitration rather than allowed to go to court. 
</P>
<P>
Another major hurdle faced by Johnston is the vocal opposition of Harvey 
Rosenfield, the primary author of Proposition 103. On Wednesday, Rosenfield 
said the Legislature should take no steps to modify the insurance system until 
Proposition 103 is fully implemented and the insurance industry is forced to 
open its books and justify the need for further cost-cutting measures.

A Thai Airways International jetliner aborted a takeoff Wednesday from Bangkok 
airport, and 16 people were injured during the emergency evacuation, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Airbus 300-600 with 252 people aboard was taking off for Tokyo when the 
pilot noticed a fire-warning indicator and aborted the flight. As the aircraft 
stopped, a smoke-warning indicator came on and the pilot ordered an emergency 
evacuation, airline Vice President Chusak Baachaiyud said. 
</P>
<P>
An investigation showed that a rupture in a high-pressure pneumatic duct caused 
the aircraft's left engine to overheat. The sudden stop overheated the brakes, 
causing the smoke warning.

Five people were charged Wednesday in the killing of more than 40 wild horses 
and burros in north-central Nevada in a continuing federal investigation into 
the deaths of at least 10 times as many animals. 
</P>
<P>
The five, all ranch workers, are charged with violating the Wild and Free 
Roaming Horse and Burro Act, a misdemeanor that could result in one year in 
prison and a fine of $2,000 for each conviction, according to Assistant U.S. 
Atty. Will Mattly. 
</P>
<P>
Federal grand jury indictments named David Morehead and Shannon Brennan of 
Lovelock, Eugene John Thacker of Winnemucca and David Thacker and Ronald Emory 
Hage of Cosgrave, Mattly said. 
</P>
<P>
He said all but Hage were in custody, and Hage was expected to surrender late 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Morehead is charged with seven counts of killing a wild horse or burro between 
May 15 and the end of June, 1988, and one count of selling a mustang and a 
burro to a livestock yard. 
</P>
<P>
He and Brennan are charged in two other counts with killing 28 wild horses and 
two wild colts in November, 1987. Hage and Eugene and David Thacker each face 
five counts of killing five wild horses in August, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Mattly said all of the slayings occurred in Lander and Pershing counties.

<P>
Ten key members of the gang were hanged in Tehran, two smugglers were executed 
in neighboring Varamin and four in western Bakhtaran province, according to the 
broadcast, monitored in Nicosia. 
</P>
<P>
These deaths raised to 89 the number of drug smugglers executed since the 
crackdown started Jan. 16. More than 1,000 people have been arrested in the 
same period in what Iranian newspapers describe as "the biggest crackdown on 
drug smuggling in Iranian history."

ABANDONED PETS ARE ROUSTED FROM LONGTIME HOME

<P>
About 2,000 unwanted pet rabbits, chickens and ducks abandoned in a flood 
control basin at Marina del Rey over the last decade are being evicted from 
their unofficial animal refuge. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Small Craft Harbor Commission voted this week to remove 
the domestic birds and animals from the Oxford Flood Control Basin and allow 
only wild migrating birds to remain in the 10 1/2-acre area of shallow runoff 
water, mud and scattered vegetation. 
</P>
<P>
Department of Animal Care and Control officials said they soon will begin a 
search for new homes for the birds and animals, which began accumulating in the 
basin about 10 years ago when people decided that it was a good place to dump 
baby chicks, ducklings and bunnies that had been given to children for 
Christmas or Easter, but were no longer wanted. 
</P>
<P>
The animals -- particularly the rabbits -- quickly multiplied, and volunteers 
started feeding and caring for them in 1982, providing more than 300 pounds of 
food a day. Last summer, the group also began trying to keep the population 
down by moving some of them and organizing a neutering program for the rabbits. 
</P>
<P>
But some human neighbors of the basin have complained for years of roosters 
crowing in the early morning, offensive odors and the inappropriateness of 
caring for birds and animals near a residential area. And officials said the 
animals' droppings contributed to pollution that forced the closure last year 
of "Mothers' Beach," the only swimming beach in Marina del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not Appropriate' 
</P>
<P>
The five-member Small Craft Harbor Commission, which oversees operation of the 
marina, agreed unanimously that the basin is "not appropriate" for care of 
domestic animals. 
</P>
<P>
"My conclusion is based on the environmental concerns that have been raised, 
particularly the effect on marina water quality, surrounding residents, 
competition with wildfowl and the risk of interference with the primary 
function of flood control," said Commissioner Mark Nathanson, who conducted a 
hearing and then wrote a report on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows for sure how many animals are in the basin, but Bruce Richards, 
assistant director of the county Department of Animal Care and Control, 
estimates that there are up to 1,300 rabbits and a total of about 700 chickens 
and ducks. There may have been as many as 2,500 rabbits and 1,200 chickens and 
ducks before some of them were moved to Los Angeles parks last summer, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The vote to move the animals from the area, located at the northern end of the 
marina between Washington Street and Admiralty Way, drew protests from Marina 
Sanctuary Inc., the nonprofit group of volunteers who care for the animals. 
</P>
<P>
"This is really an extension of the homeless problem," said member Leigh 
Platte. "The animals are victims, and worse, they can't even ask for help. The 
least we can do is be compassionate." 
</P>
<P>
Another volunteer, Susan Hartley, told the commission that not everybody who 
lives nearby dislikes the menagerie, and handed over a petition with 100 
signatures of residents who favor allowing the animals to stay. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm saddened to hear what my neighbors have said," Hartley said, calling the 
sanctuary "a jewel in the neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
Platte said the group may petition the Board of Supervisors to save the refuge. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Need for Vote 
</P>
<P>
But Eric Bourdon, assistant director of the county Department of Beaches and 
Harbors, said the domestic birds and animals are illegally in the basin -- 
which gathers water from several channels before it flows into the ocean -- and 
therefore the supervisors do not need to vote on the commission's decision to 
remove them. 
</P>
<P>
No timetable has yet been established, but Richards said it would take several 
months to humanely relocate the animals to parks throughout the county. People 
may be asked to adopt some of the animals, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Beaches and Harbors has called a meeting for next week with 
animal control officials and the neighborhood volunteers to work out a starting 
date and other details of the eviction. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to try to make it a pleasant end to a program," Richards said.

IRWINDALE TO GIVE CONSULTANT BACK PAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Irwindale City Council has approved the payment of $53,400 to public 
relations consultant Xavier Hermosillo to settle his claim for back wages. 
</P>
<P>
Hermosillo was hired by City Manager Charles Martin in 1987 to primarily handle 
questions from the media concerning the possible move of the Los Angeles 
Raiders to Irwindale. 
</P>
<P>
Although he was paid $8,500 a month as a consultant, Hermosillo said Irwindale 
owed him additional money for nearly 500 hours of public relations work 
unconnected with the Raiders deal. 
</P>
<P>
Hermosillo billed the city for the wages shortly after he resigned from the 
consulting job last June.

William R. Hilbert, 43, also had his driver's license revoked for four years 
and was placed on probation for five years by Municipal Court Commissioner 
Ronald Grey. 
</P>
<P>
Hilbert, an unemployed former firefighter, was sentenced after pleading guilty 
to driving under the influence of alcohol, driving with a blood-alcohol content 
above the legal limit of 0.10% and driving with a revoked license, all 
misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
In December, Hilbert was ordered held in lieu of $250,000 bail after a 
prosecutor said his blood-alcohol level had often been three times the legal 
limit, adding, "I cannot believe this guy hasn't killed someone."

JAIL INFORMANT TO BE SEGREGATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles Superior Court judge on Wednesday ordered informant Leslie White, 
who sparked an unprecedented review of jailhouse "snitches," segregated from 
other County Jail inmates for his own safety. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the information he has divulged, he could be in jeopardy from other 
inmates," Deputy Dist. Atty. Larry Longo said in asking Judge Ernest Hiroshige 
for the "keep-away" order. 
</P>
<P>
White, who failed to appear in Hiroshige's court last week for sentencing in a 
purse-snatching case, told his attorney that he had been beaten up while on the 
street by unidentified gang members who had marked him a "snitch." 
</P>
<P>
White was arrested during a drug raid at a downtown motel over the weekend and 
was brought before Hiroshige for the sentencing Wednesday, but the proceeding 
was postponed until Feb. 23. 
</P>
<P>
White last year demonstrated for authorities how, while in jail, he could 
concoct a murder confession from a defendant he had never met by gathering 
information over the telephone.

PROSECUTOR DROPPED IN MORTICIANS CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Pasadena Superior Court judge has removed a prosecutor in the trial of three 
Pasadena morticians charged with stealing dental gold from corpses, conducting 
mass cremations and illegally selling body parts to scientific laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
Acting on a motion from defense attorneys, Judge Terry Smerling removed Deputy 
Dist. Atty. JoAnn Glidden because of her friendship with a prosecutor whom 
defendant David Sconce allegedly threatened to have killed. That prosecutor, 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Walt Lewis, was the first to handle the Sconce case and was 
replaced by Glidden last year after the alleged threat. 
</P>
<P>
Now handling the case is Deputy Dist. Atty. James E. Rogan. 
</P>
<P>
Sconce and his parents, Jerry and Laurieanne Sconce, face a total of 68 felony 
and misdemeanor counts in connection with their operation of the Lamb Funeral 
Home in Pasadena and Coastal Cremations Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, David Sconce was ordered to stand trial on a new charge of 
conspiracy to murder the owner of a competing cremation operation.

CRITIC AT LARGE: MARTIN LANDAU: RETURN MISSION TO BIG SCREEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, Times Arts Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the actor, a successful television series can become a golden trap. The 
more successful the series, the more golden and the more inescapable the trap 
is apt to be. 
</P>
<P>
One of the rewarding surprises of Francis Coppola's "Tucker" was the presence 
of Martin Landau -- for all those seasons a super-spy on "Mission: Impossible" 
-- playing an emigre financier named Abe Karatz. 
</P>
<P>
Landau's hair had been grayed, he wore a slightly sinister mustache, his height 
and his whole aspect seemed diminished. ("Every day of rehearsal I got older 
and shorter," Landau said not long ago.) By the film's end Abe emerges as a 
warmly sympathetic figure, and Landau's "Mission: Impossible" days felt as 
remote as Prohibition. 
</P>
<P>
"Television is amazing," Landau remarked over lunch. "It's so indeliblizing. 
Telly Savalas is Kojak. I was Super-Spy. The series was in 70 countries, and 
it's the kind of success you dream about. But it was a nightmare too. If a show 
is a hit, it's the kiss of death as far as doing anything else is concerned." 
</P>
<P>
Landau would get scripts, but his agent would report that the producers said 
they couldn't see him in the project. "I couldn't even read for them, and not 
even getting up to bat is really tough." 
</P>
<P>
If being on a hot series tends to disqualify the actor for other work, it also 
has a way of putting out of mind what the actor did before the series. Landau, 
trained at the Actors Studio in New York, had been on Broadway and appeared in 
films as various as "North by Northwest" and "The Greatest Story Ever Told." 
</P>
<P>
"I'd worked for the giants at the beginning -- George Stevens, Hitchcock," 
Landau says. "And then it all stopped because I was a television actor." 
</P>
<P>
Landau's first job was as an illustrator for the New York Daily News. He was 17 
and studying at Pratt Institute in his native Brooklyn. "I did caricatures 
three times a week for Billy Rose's column. I was also an assistant to Gus 
Edson, who was then drawing the cartoon strip, The Gumps. I did backgrounds and 
lettering and sometimes on Sunday I'd do the whole strip." 
</P>
<P>
Landau put his old skill to work on "Tucker," drawing a sketch for makeup man 
Richard Dean of how he thought Abe ought to look. Dean and Coppola agreed. 
</P>
<P>
After five years at the News, Landau suddenly quit to try his hand at acting. 
"I told the picture editor I was going into the theater. I think he thought I 
was going to be an usher." 
</P>
<P>
Landau had no prospects whatever but lived on $5 a week from his savings ("You 
could get quite a decent meal at the Automat for half a buck") and made the 
rounds. He was hired for a summer stock company on an island off Portland, Me., 
did 12 shows -- including musicals -- in 13 weeks and had a swell time. 
</P>
<P>
Back in New York he auditioned for Lee Strasberg and was accepted in the Actors 
Studio. He is now, along with Mark Rydell and Sydney Pollack, a director of 
Actors Studio West. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, he joined the Broadway company and then did the national tour of 
"Middle of the Night," which starred Edward G. Robinson. During the Los Angeles 
run, Alfred Hitchcock saw Landau and cast him as an icy, epicene villain in 
what was first called "The Man in Lincoln's Nose" but became "North by 
Northwest." 
</P>
<P>
"I had tea with Mr. Hitchcock one afternoon and asked him how he could have 
cast me in that part, because what I was playing in 'Middle of the Night' was 
so different." 
</P>
<P>
"My dear Mahtin," Hitchcock said -- Landau catches the famous voice nicely -- 
"you have a circus going on inside you. If you can do that part in the play, 
you can do this little trinket of mine." 
</P>
<P>
Landau taught acting in Hollywood. Among the film people he came to know was 
Fred Roos, a casting director who gave one of Landau's students, Jack 
Nicholson, an early role. 
</P>
<P>
"Fred always said: 'One of these days I'll have something for you.' It was an 
empty promise for 20 years and we kidded each other about it." Then Roos, by 
now the co-producer of "Tucker," sent Landau a copy of the script and 
subsequently asked him what he thought about Abe. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not usually like this, but I told him I thought I could do it better than 
any one else in the world. Fred said: 'I think so too; let's put you together 
with Francis.' " 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, Landau has completed shooting Woody Allen's new and -- as always 
-- untitled film, and is under a veil of silence that makes the gents from 
Price, Waterhouse seem like blabbermouths. His fellow cast members are known to 
include Woody himself and Mia Farrow, Claire Bloom, Anjelica Huston, Sam 
Waterston, Sean Young and Daryl Hannah. There will probably be some reshooting; 
there usually is on Allen's films. 
</P>
<P>
Allen had evidently seen and liked Landau's work in "Tucker" and through his 
agent he was invited to come to New York to chat with Allen. Landau asked if he 
could have a look at the script and was told, in effect, "Are you kidding?" But 
after a first meeting with Allen, a copy of the script was delivered to his 
hotel within the hour, and an intense, demanding and evidently satisfying 
experience began. 
</P>
<P>
"The chasm between film and television is now beginning to disintegrate," 
Landau thinks, "partly because some of the people who ran television are now 
running the studios." 
</P>
<P>
The chasm originally reflected the mortal fear in the studios that audiences 
would not pay to see what they could get for free. It is now clear that 
audiences will pay to see what they want to see, whether it involves actors who 
don't do television or those who, like Judd Hirsch and others, do. The bottom 
line, to no one's surprise, is money. It is also talent: underused or, like 
Martin Landau's, rediscovered.

ONE BIG HAPPY FAMILY?;

<P>
WHY 'ROSEANNE'S' CREATOR LEFT HIT SHOW AFTER DISPUTE WITH ITS STAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NIKKI FINKE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The new TV series was going to be called "Life and Stuff," or so its creator, 
head writer and co-executive producer, Matt Williams, thought. 
</P>
<P>
He even put the title on the cover of the pilot script. "I wanted to establish 
it as an ensemble piece," he recalls. 
</P>
<P>
So when the star, Roseanne Barr, insisted that the sitcom should be named for 
her, Williams balked. The fear, he says, was that by calling the series 
"Roseanne," it was going to be a star vehicle from the outset and put the 
comedian in too powerful a position to influence the show's creative 
development. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Barr got her way. And Williams' fear was borne out -- ultimately at 
his expense. 
</P>
<P>
That flap was just one of many that have plagued "Roseanne" during its first TV 
season, which is unusually early for any show to be so troubled, let alone one 
that jumped into the Top 5 of the Nielsen ratings so quickly. 
</P>
<P>
More importantly, however, the situation at "Roseanne" spotlights what happens 
behind the scenes when producers, writers and actors battle for control over a 
series -- a scenario that seems to be replaying itself more now than ever 
before. 
</P>
<P>
In the last two years alone, Valerie Harper and Lorimar went to court over her 
removal from "Valerie"; creator and executive producer Glenn Gordon Caron was 
forced off "Moonlighting" because of wrangling with star Cybill Shepherd, and 
co-creator Terry Louise Fisher was ousted as a producer and writer on "L.A. 
Law" because of differences with executive producer Steven Bochco. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of "Roseanne," the owners of its production company, Marcy Carsey 
and Tom Werner, resolved the ruckus by bowing to an ultimatum Barr delivered in 
December: that she would walk off the series after only 13 of the 22 episodes 
ordered for this season had been made unless Williams was thrown out. On Jan. 
6, the Carsey-Werner Co. announced that Williams had "elected to move on" 
because of "creative tensions" with the comedian. 
</P>
<P>
Carsey, whose company also produces the megahit "The Cosby Show" and its 
spinoff "A Different World," declined in an interview this week to explain the 
reasons behind the decision. 
</P>
<P>
"Matt is a fabulous talent, and Roseanne is a fabulous talent, and it would be 
wonderful if they got along famously, but it didn't happen that way," she said. 
"But I don't want the subject of anyone's interest in the show to be who is 
staying and who is going, and creative tensions and stuff like that. It's wrong 
for us and it's wrong for the show for that to be the focus of anyone's 
attention." 
</P>
<P>
Williams, however, sees his ouster as "symptomatic of an industry disdain for 
writers in general. The feeling is that writing isn't important, that what's 
important is the star. And to me, that's very, very sad," he said in his only 
interview since his ouster. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem was who was going to have the final say on stories, scripts and 
the overall thrust of the show. As the creator and executive producer, I 
automatically assumed, rightly or wrongly, that I would have the final say. 
And, obviously, Roseanne thought she had the final say. And that, in essence, 
was the central conflict." 
</P>
<P>
Barr, through a spokesman, declined repeated requests to be interviewed for 
this article. 
</P>
<P>
But others associated with "Roseanne" said in interviews that Carsey-Werner 
executives considered dumping her from the show last November because of the 
production problems she was causing, which included throwing temper tantrums, 
screaming at co-workers, locking herself in her dressing room, storming off the 
set and threatening on several occasions to quit. 
</P>
<P>
Carsey denies this. Yet one Carsey-Werner associate explained at the time, "I 
don't know that she's indispensable." 
</P>
<P>
Looking back, one writer said that "the feeling among the writers and producers 
was that we (still) had a show with John Goodman (who plays Barr's husband). 
But ultimately ABC owned the show and had the final say. And to them it was 
keep the star at all costs." 
</P>
<P>
Carsey says that Barr has not been difficult to work with this season. "Of 
course, she's passionate about what she does and she cares very deeply about 
the character that she had created in her stand-up routines. And for whatever 
part of that she's using in this show, she cares very deeply about that. After 
all, she spent years on it." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, ABC Entertainment President Brandon Stoddard acknowledged that he 
was "keeping an eye" on the turmoil at "Roseanne." But he also noted that 
following Williams' departure, "I think the problems have been resolved. . . . 
And I think things seem to be going along very well right now." 
</P>
<P>
Stoddard's comments did not sit well with Williams, especially since ABC wants 
him to do another series. "The impression that's been given by everyone 
involved is that 
</P>
<P>
I just quit. I did not just walk off the show. I reluctantly stepped aside," 
said Williams, whose agent negotiated a sizable financial settlement for him -- 
reportedly seven figures a year for several years -- as well as a substantial 
interest in the series' profits. 
</P>
<P>
It's not, Williams contends, that he didn't want Barr's input. After all, he 
readily admits that "the show truly was a collaboration with me, Marcy, Tom and 
Roseanne, a blending of ideas." 
</P>
<P>
But quickly, he said, the normal give-and-take that exists between the writers 
and the star, or the producers and the star, on prime-time series deteriorated 
into a day-in and day-out struggle for control over the tone, texture and 
content of every script. 
</P>
<P>
"In a bizarre sort of way, it helped the show because you're constantly 
challenging each other to back up your ideas," he explained. "But ultimately it 
depends on how tense the creative tensions get as to whether you can function 
that way year in and year out. And it finally just got to the point where it 
was, 'Are we going to have a series or not?' " 
</P>
<P>
Williams maintains that he didn't want to simply hand Barr the reins to 
"Roseanne," "because I believe that for a TV series to run successfully, you 
need someone at the top who is objective and can stand back and maintain an 
overview of the entire series. And I think it's very difficult, though not 
impossible, for an actor who is in the midst of working within that show to 
maintain that overview." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, before the first airing of the series Barr publicly began to 
claim credit for what was good about the show and to blame everything that was 
bad on Williams. And, by December, at the height of the comedian's power 
struggle with the series' creator, Carsey-Werner was no longer offering 
reporters any interviews with Williams so as "not to upset Roseanne." 
</P>
<P>
"Matt was not to be either in the limelight or to be given credit for 
anything," said one insider. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Leed, vice president of the Agency for the Performing Arts and the talent 
agent for Williams and two of the show's other writers, believe that Barr is 
typical of some stars "who by the nature of their personality don't want to 
trust other people and who see the show only through their vision. And what 
they try to do is make everybody bend to their vision and they destroy the most 
important aspect of TV shows, which is collaboration." 
</P>
<P>
Williams tried to prevent that from happening, Leed said, but found little 
support. "Because, when a production company and a network have a hit show, and 
when the show is named 'Roseanne,' and when the star takes off in the media as 
the darling of this season's television season, it became pretty clear the show 
was hers," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
Carsey, however, maintains that "it's only natural to want Roseanne's input as 
much as possible. Because you have to love the talent you're using, and we do 
with Bill (Cosby) and we do here. You have to have a great admiration and 
respect for it. And therefore you incorporate it." 
</P>
<P>
Barr reportedly went to ABC and to Carsey-Werner even before her series had 
premiered and asked them to choose either her or Williams as boss. But both the 
network and the production company backed Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Then, after eight episodes, Barr went back again, with no success. "And that's 
when there was a major thrust by her to get Matt out at all costs because Matt 
was the one who had the final say," according to one writer. 
</P>
<P>
Then, just after the 13th episode was completed on Dec. 16, Barr reportedly 
told Carsey-Werner that her husband Bill was in the hospital and that she 
"didn't know if she could continue the series because she was feeling a lot of 
stress," said one insider. 
</P>
<P>
At first, she didn't mention Williams directly. "But then she said there would 
be 'less stress' if Williams was no longer with the show," the source related. 
</P>
<P>
And, for the first time, Williams said, hewas not included in the production 
company's talks. By the end of the month, he was out. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Barr has increasingly claimed credit for both the creation and the 
writing of the show. In October she told Newsweek that she wrote much of the 
pilot episode herself. One month later, she told Time magazine that she was 
rewriting scripts. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, however, maintains that while Barr's input has always been "unique" 
and "important," especially in melding the "domestic Goddess" of her stand-up 
comedy routine with the blue-collar working mother she plays on the show, she 
has considerably overstated her writing contributions. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a great staff of writers, the best I have ever worked with, who would 
stay there until 6 a.m. making the scripts right," Williams said. "Roseanne 
obviously helped shape and form the show, but that staff writes the scripts." 
</P>
<P>
Insiders said it wasn't always easy for the writers to know exactly what 
changes Barr wanted to make because she seemed to flip-flop from day to day and 
week to week. For instance, they said, the comedian would tell the writers she 
"didn't want any jokes" in the scripts anymore, and then "complain why there 
weren't any jokes." Or she would accuse the writers of making her character 
"too mean" and then charge them the next day with writing scripts that didn't 
give her "any kind of edge." 
</P>
<P>
For their part, some "Roseanne" employees complained that Barr often wouldn't 
learn lines or memorize blocking. "I think she read somewhere that Jackie 
Gleason never rehearsed for 'The Honeymooners,' and so she didn't want to, 
either," said one staff member. "She had a preconceived notion of what it was 
to be a star but never what it was to be an actor. And there's a big difference 
in terms of hard work and discipline." 
</P>
<P>
Carsey, however, describes Barr as "an amazingly quick study" as an actress. 
"We were amazed at how much she learned and how quickly she learned about what 
she didn't know. And I think she's just going to get more and more comfortable 
with the medium and with the format." 
</P>
<P>
Currently, insiders describe the mood on "Roseanne" as "very calm." 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Harris, whose TV credits include "Diff'rent Strokes," was brought in as 
chief writer, and Williams smoothed over the transition by meeting with his 
hand-picked team of writers and persuading them to stay on the show at least 
until the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
As for Barr, neither her public image nor professional career seems hurt by the 
reports on her show's turmoil. Journalists are still beating down her door for 
interviews, and she finally hired a PR agency last week. When she's done on 
"Roseanne" in April, she begins shooting her first feature film, "She Devil," 
in which she co-stars with Meryl Streep. 
</P>
<P>
Plus, with a season of TV experience already under her belt, she will be in a 
stronger position than ever to call the shots on her series next year. Already, 
since Williams' ouster, she finally has the rewrite power she has sought. "If 
she comes up with something, there's now more inclusion of what she wants," 
said one writer on the show. 
</P>
<P>
Will the American public notice any difference? Even Williams says probably 
not, at least this season. "Maybe not until the second season will they really 
notice the difference, because a lot of the stories and what we had worked on 
are intact for the rest of the year. But people say that if you can keep a show 
in the Top 10 for one year, then it's going to run five years just on that 
alone. Because it becomes a habit." 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Williams is more than ready to put "Roseanne" behind him as 
quickly as possible. "On the one hand, I'm relieved it's over. On the other, 
I've still got that tug. It'll be interesting to see what happens now that I'm 
gone. Right now, there's a honeymoon period because 'Matt's out.' And I know 
that will not last through the back nine." 
</P>
<P>
Already, he is dreaming up ideas for his next TV series because he believes he 
has "at least a couple more TV shows within me. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to be known for my work," he said. "And I don't want to be known 
as the guy that's fighting with Roseanne Barr forever.

inmate has finally been executed in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
"Ted Bundy has died today," Gumbel says. Gumbel is somber. His co-host, Jane 
Pauley, is somber. There are weighty matters to contemplate, the heinous crimes 
Bundy committed, the issue of capital punishment. But suddenly, there is a 
knock on the hotel room door. 
</P>
<P>
It is Winnie the Pooh. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, a small person wearing a Winnie the Pooh costume is at the door delivering 
a press release from Walt Disney Television. He hands it over and waves goodby. 
</P>
<P>
Consider this fleeting moment a microcosm of television industry reality, for 
on the floor of Houston's sprawling George R. Brown Convention Center this 
week, Winnie the Pooh, not Ted Bundy the executed serial murderer, is the real 
world. 
</P>
<P>
Spiderman and Zorro are there, delivering their greetings side by side. Kenny 
Rogers is there shaking hands. So are Yogi Bear, Joan Rivers, Don Cornelius, 
Robin Leach, Lou Rawls, Rex Reed, Dionne Warwick, Sally Jessy Raphael, Roy 
Clark, Steve Garvey, Fawn Hall and Siskel and Ebert. 
</P>
<P>
A huge curious throng -- including one of the crews from the CBS series "48 
Hours" taping here -- envelopes Geraldo Rivera as if he were the Pope. Morton 
Downey is around, taping his show. So is Judge Wapner. 
</P>
<P>
The event is broadcasting's Super Bowl of glitz and gluttony, otherwise known 
as the annual National Assn. of Television Program Executives (NATPE) 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
This is the industry's grand bazaar for syndicated (non-network) programming, 
where 225 production companies and distributors of all sizes are exhibiting 
their programs and stars for the benefit of the nation's station executives. 
</P>
<P>
Gathered under one enormous roof are international buyers, makers and sellers 
of programming ranging from such Hollywood giants as MCA TV and Paramount to a 
New York company selling "The Truth About Communism," a 1962 documentary 
narrated by Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
They're all here, your friends with the trends. You want your trash TV? You got 
your trash TV. You want your crash TV -- the new "RollerGames," "American 
Gladiators" and "Interceptor"? You got your crash TV. And your smash TV, your 
clash TV and your cash TV. 
</P>
<P>
Being here is like being hermetically sealed inside a gargantuan cocktail party 
abounding in food, booze, TV chatter and high-powered salesmanship. 
</P>
<P>
Entering some of the swanky exhibitions is like entering a Mercedes Benz 
showroom teeming with salesmen in expensive dark suits. Only they're selling 
Isuzus. 
</P>
<P>
According to one industry source, the cost of mounting an exhibit here ranges 
from $50,000 for a budget stall to $1 million for a fully equipped, fully 
staffed Rodeo Drive model that merges the skills of Hollywood's finest set 
designers and deal makers. 
</P>
<P>
MCA resembles a posh club. Twentieth Century Fox has its own mezzanine. MTM 
looks like an old hotel. Receptionists in "Star Trek" costumes sit at a 
futuristic control panel outside lushly appointed Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
Surrounded by potted plants, a black pianist in a white dinner jacket sits at 
an old piano playing "As Time Goes By" beneath electric fans at the entrance of 
Casablanca IV, which has become Rick's cafe. Two barely clad Las Vegas 
showgirls stand outside an exhibit where the prospective new game show 
"Hotline" is being played with actual contestants in front of an audience. 
</P>
<P>
And not far from the ring where superstars from the World Wrestling Federation 
perform daily, the star of "Monty's Traveling Reptile Show" poses in front of 
an ABC News crew with an albino Burmese Python around his neck. 
</P>
<P>
There's no escaping the selling atmosphere, even in men's room conversation: 
"He cleared 26% of the U.S., and they paid him a bonus." 
</P>
<P>
Just how much actual business is written here is debatable, however, depending 
on the show and the amount of exposure it has received prior to the conference. 
For most of the new ones, NAPTE is an ending, not a beginning. 
</P>
<P>
"Every year is different," said Ave Butensky, executive vice president of Fries 
Distribution Co., inside his firm's upscale exhibit. "I got a thousand people 
coming in here saying, 'I'll try to come back, I'll see ya.' But who knows how 
many will come back?" 
</P>
<P>
"RollerGames" was virtually a "go" even before NAPTE, said 31-year-old David R. 
Sams, co-creator/executive producer (with Michael J. Miller) of the Quintex 
Entertainment series. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, get ready to r-r-r-r-rumble on Saturday nights, for the target of the 
funky "RollerGames" and "American Gladiator" is that American institution, 
NBC's "Saturday Night Live." 
</P>
<P>
"RollerGames" is scheduled to premiere in September (on KTLA Channel 5 in Los 
Angeles) with a two-hour special followed by 26 hourlong episodes. "They're 
calling us 'crash TV,' a step beyond the current reality shows," said former 
King World sales executive Sams. A giant step. 
</P>
<P>
"RollerGames" is an upgraded, high-tech, tongue-in-checkbook, absolutely 
death-defying version of Roller Derby in which six "concept-driven" teams -- 
Bad Attitude, Hot Flash, the Rockers, the Maniacs, the Violators and the 
T-Birds -- compete on a huge figure-eight track featuring a 14-foot Wall of 
Death and a live alligator pit. 
</P>
<P>
"The stations love the alligator pit," Sams said. "Somebody asked me if we're 
gonna have the alligators at NAPTE. I said, 'No, we have enough roaming the 
floor.' " 
</P>
<P>
"RollerGames" will have cheerleaders, a "sports center" for interviews and 
commentary, a commissioner (William J. Griffiths, operator of the old Roller 
Derby) and rock bands playing at half time. "This is total rock and roll TV," 
Sams said. "We'll even have cameras mounted on the helmets so that you can see 
the crashes at skate level." And there will be crashes. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Roller Derby, Sams insists, however, "RollerGames will be on the level. 
"It is not orchestrated. The players (some of whom are from Roller Derby) will 
develop personalities, but they'll be fighting for world championships. We'll 
even have a league draft in March." And with a straight face he adds: "Will we 
have drug testing? If it's necessary." 
</P>
<P>
Isn't there a strong chance that such a gimmick show will quickly burn out and 
last only one or two seasons? "Two seasons will buy my home in Bel-Air," Sams 
replied. 
</P>
<P>
Like "RollerGames," Samuel Goldwyn Television's "American Gladiators" is 
designed to pick off the principally young, male audience that went in a big 
way for the WWF wrestling spectaculars that occasionally alternated with -- and 
even outdrew -- "Saturday Night Live." 
</P>
<P>
Co-announced by former pro quarterback great Fran Tarkenton and former Chicago 
Bear Tim Wrightman, "American Gladiators" matches ordinary people against six 
inventively costumed "gladiators" -- Cattalus, Lace, Willie, Dominos, Evander 
and Zap -- in such events as power ball, pugel sticks and the always popular 
Velcro joust. In that one, the challenger and gladiator are dressed in Velcro 
body suits and dangled 10 feet above ground. The gladiator tries to throw his 
or her opponent against a Velcro-covered wall. 
</P>
<P>
Says an excited Tarkenton on the promotion tape shown prospective clients: "The 
NFL is nuthin' like this!" 
</P>
<P>
Yet the future of "American Gladiators" is iffy at this point. It would hold 
challenger tryouts throughout the nation, with the top male and female 
challengers ultimately replacing two of the regular gladiators. Not Lace, one 
hopes, for she is billed as "controlling men for her own pleasure and making 
other women grovel at her feet." 
</P>
<P>
"This is a chance for the average man or woman to become a folk hero," said 
Goldwyn Television President Dick Askin, who likens "American Gladiators" to 
"Battle of the Network Stars" and says the contests are not predetermined. "The 
thing we're trying to avoid is the sleaze element," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Interceptor" seems to avoid intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
However, that may be a premature judgment. Fries Entertainment has only a 
paucity of promotional materials on hand -- mainly consisting of a 6-foot-5 man 
dressed up in black leather as the Interceptor himself and an excerpt of the 
defunct British series on which the premise is based -- to illustrate 
"Interceptor." Bearing a resemblance to "The Running Man" movie, the show so 
far is down only for an hour special (on Channel 5 in Los Angeles) that would 
be a test for a possible series. 
</P>
<P>
"Our development people were over in England and said they saw this terrible 
show that wasn't developed properly," said Fries senior Vice President Peter 
Schmid, who characterized the concept as an "adult comic book." 
</P>
<P>
The excerpt of the English series is unintentionally hilarious, showing 
contestants on dirt bikes roaring across an obstacle course while trying to 
avoid an "Interceptor" who carries a zapper. Meanwhile, a sort of 
director/authority figure gives them clues on getting through the course to a 
home base where a key awaits. Using the key, they unlock their backpacks and 
win the game and prizes. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to do away with that English twit you saw," said Schmid, who added 
that the look of the Interceptor may change too. "You'll never know his 
identity. He should be mysterious. He may look like G.I. Joe or a Ninja," 
Schmid said, producing drawings of both. 
</P>
<P>
Or even Winnie the Pooh, for this is NAPTE.

MISS RONA READY FOR ANOTHER RUN AT TV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NIKKI FINKE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rona Barrett can sum up in a word what the year 1988 had been like. 
</P>
<P>
"Lousy." 
</P>
<P>
After all, she wasn't starring on television. She wasn't reporting on radio. 
She wasn't writing a column. And she wasn't editing a newsletter. And there was 
talk, considerable talk, that Miss Rona was not just washed up but left hanging 
out to dry. 
</P>
<P>
Even when she appeared on "The Arsenio Hall Show" earlier this month, the only 
new venture she could plug was an upcoming commercial where she interviews Miss 
Chiquita Banana. Seriously. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't deny it. There were rough times when I thought maybe I'm not meant to 
go back on TV," she admits. "But when you believe in something, you just keep 
going even when there are deep, dark days. The one thing you never know is when 
one phone call can come and change your life." 
</P>
<P>
And when it came, the man on the other end of the line just happened to be the 
president of NBC Entertainment, Brandon Tartikoff, wanting Barrett to host a 
series of 10 half-hour daytime specials starting March 6 as a change from the 
network's usual fare of game shows and soap operas. 
</P>
<P>
Tentatively titled "At Rona's" and scheduled to follow the "Today" show, the 
specials will be set inside Barrett's newly purchased pied-a-terre in Beverly 
Hills. In "my little home," as Miss Rona refers to it, Barrett will invite 
three "very interesting people from different walks of life" to an intimate 
dinner party that will just happen to be recorded by the videotape cameras. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't call it a talk show. I call it a different kind of interview program," 
says Barrett, who had been trying unsuccessfully to sell herself as the star of 
a talk-interview show since 1986. "The interesting thing about these programs 
will be to watch how people share and to find what threads they have in common 
and to hear what conversation they have, ranging from subjects occurring in 
headlines to whatever is on people's minds." 
</P>
<P>
Though no guests have been booked as yet, Barrett says she will try for a 
"surprising" mix of people when taping begins in mid-February. And even though 
she is best known for chatting with Hollywood celebrities, she wants to 
interview "recognizable people" from the worlds of business, sports and 
politics as well. 
</P>
<P>
Barrett isn't concerned that daytime television already is overrun with talk, 
talk, talk -- that there's already Phil, Oprah, Geraldo and Sally, Regis and 
Kathie, Steve and Cristina (in the Los Angeles market alone). Or that, at 
times, Oprah Winfrey has gathered a group of actresses around a table and just 
had a a group of women talking without an audience. Or that a cable show once 
featured Dixie Whatley (now paired with Rex Reed "At the Movies") interviewing 
her guests at a lunch table at a real New York restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
"It turned out Brandon had this in the back of his mind for a long time and was 
just finding the right time to make it happen," says Barrett, whose Rona 
Barrett Enterprises will co-produce the specials with NBC Productions. 
</P>
<P>
So why did this deal with Tartikoff and company come through when so many 
others had fallen flat elsewhere? "Maybe they've got good taste," she says with 
her trademark touch of arrogance. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the former gossip columnist already had deals cooking with Tartikoff, 
with whom she had been talking since 1986 after she left her last TV job as 
senior correspondent for "Entertainment Tonight" ("which I considered to be one 
of the worst experiences of my entire career," she maintains). 
</P>
<P>
Though claiming she never really wanted to be a producer "because the 
development process is one that tears your guts out," she nevertheless tried to 
sell Tartikoff a series called "Untold Stories." But he had bought "Unsolved 
Mysteries" just four days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Then, she said, Tartikoff suggested she create some "original novels for 
television," which he could program against "ABC's Monday Night Football" in 
fall 1988 as "Rona Barrett's Night at the Movies." When the writer's strike 
began, the project was held. 
</P>
<P>
The strike almost killed another Barrett idea for a summer-replacement series. 
But, finally, two months ago, she received an order from NBC for a two-hour 
movie-of-the-week that might lead to a series. As for the series' concept, 
she'll only divulge it's a "spy thriller that's international in scope." 
</P>
<P>
Barrett also is pushing ahead with her novels-for-television and has sold three 
outlines to NBC "about ordinary women who find themselves in extraordinary 
situations," she says. 
</P>
<P>
In short, don't expect any thinly veiled stories about show business 
shenanigans. Says Tony Masucci, NBC's vice president of miniseries and motion 
pictures, "the truth of the matter is we wanted Rona to draw on her experiences 
and take them out of the Hollywood milieu." 
</P>
<P>
And to think that just a year ago, as the joke goes, Barrett couldn't get 
herself arrested in the entertainment business. 
</P>
<P>
When Lee Solters, a veteran celebrity press agent, ran into her one day this 
winter, he was as surprised as if he had seen Greta Garbo. "We nodded in 
acknowledgment. And then I realized that I didn't know what she was doing these 
days." 
</P>
<P>
Neither did she. Ask Miss Rona why she all but disappeared after 30 years of 
covering Hollywood, including two decades as one of the entertainment 
industry's most visible chroniclers, and she sighs theatrically. "I don't mind 
telling you that I've been rejected more times than Carter has liver pills. 
It's been the most discouraging year I have ever had. It's as if I might never 
have been Rona Barrett." 
</P>
<P>
But the fact is she didn't want to be Rona Barrett, gossip columnist, any 
longer. "I made it very clear that I just wouldn't do that work again," she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
But she quickly found out that changing her image within the industry was going 
to be more painful than cosmetic surgery. 
</P>
<P>
"People love putting you in a slot. They said, 'You've only covered Hollywood. 
What makes you think you can do anything more?' Sure, people wanted me to do 
Hollywood. But my blue sky was to do my version of (Larry) King and (Ted) 
Koppel. And if I couldn't do that, I really didn't want to go back on 
television." 
</P>
<P>
Barrett herself admits that she is a TV personality who "must grow on you. 
People say, 'I hate her' or 'I adore her' because I have never been a 
middle-of-the-roader. And so, when you have those extremes, the people in power 
have to believe in you and give you time to start finding and building an 
audience." 
</P>
<P>
She certainly has had plenty of opportunities to do so, especially after the 
former nationally syndicated columnist broke into TV in 1966 by landing a spot 
on KABC's 11 p.m. newscast. 
</P>
<P>
By the mid-1970s, her reputation was well-established. She had come out with a 
novel, a juicy autobiography, and a record album, "Miss Rona Sings Hollywood's 
Greatest Hits." And then there was her how-to tome: "Rona Barrett Tells You How 
You Can Look Rich and Achieve Sexual Ecstasy." 
</P>
<P>
When she joined ABC's "Good Morning America" in 1975, she wielded enormous 
power. "My office alarm was set for the two times she was on each morning," 
recalls press agent Solters. 
</P>
<P>
And still, Barrett complains bitterly, "there were people at the network who 
said, 'Get her off the air. She's terrible.' " 
</P>
<P>
But she made a misstep when she jumped to NBC in 1980 for an embattled stint as 
the West Coast anchor of "Tomorrow" with Tom Snyder, who wasn't at all happy 
about sharing the spotlight. Their fights were legion, culminating when Barrett 
refused to appear with him. 
</P>
<P>
For a time, she was a regular on "The Today Show" and in 1982 even had her own 
weekly prime-time program on NBC, "Television: Inside and Out" which was 
canceled just four weeks later. She then launched the "Barrett Report," a 
$1,200-a-year-subscription-only confidential newsletter intended for executives 
in the entertainment industry and on Wall Street. Soon it became clear that by 
the time she could get the product in hands of subscribers, the items weren't 
that newsworthy. 
</P>
<P>
When "Entertainment Tonight" made her an offer "I almost couldn't refuse" in 
1985, she insisted on following what was happening in Hollywood's board rooms 
as closely as she used to follow what was happening in its bedrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Frank, the former president of Paramount Television and co-creator of 
"Entertainment Tonight" who now is president of Walt Disney Studios, was among 
those who wondered whether her business reporting might be too inside for the 
show's audience. "It was very good stuff, and we all appreciated it," he 
recalls. "But you've got to understand that the people who sit in Springfield, 
Ill., care more about how many shrimps are served at the Emmy Awards than they 
do about David Begelman doing something at a studio." 
</P>
<P>
During her years away from show-business reporting, Barrett acknowledges that 
she's missed it. "As Walter Cronkite once said, 'Now and then there's a 
fabulous story and I go for my fireman's hat and I say, "Where's the fire?" ' 
And that's when I remember that I don't have the forum." 
</P>
<P>
At those times, she reminds herself that "there's another area I belong in." 
</P>
<P>
Whether her new NBC interview show realizes that remains to be seen. For 
instance, will viewers accept her doing interviews with, say, Orel Hershiser or 
Gary Hart? 
</P>
<P>
"I think it always takes a very long time to initiate new things," she 
explains. "It's true. I am synonymous with Hollywood. But can I not break out 
of that mold?" 
</P>

JOSEPH B. RIDDER; EX-PUBLISHER IN SAN JOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joseph B. Ridder, for many years the publisher of the San Jose Mercury News and 
a member of one of the nation's better-known newspaper families, has died in a 
Honolulu hospital at age 68, it was reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Ridder, who died Monday, had been hospitalized with complications from 
emphysema, said his brother, Daniel Ridder, chairman of the Long Beach 
Press-Telegram. 
</P>
<P>
Ridder was publisher of the Mercury News from 1952 to 1977, during which time 
the city's population grew from about 100,000 to more than 600,000 and 
circulation of the Mercury and News, then separate morning and afternoon 
papers, grew from 73,000 to 211,000. 
</P>
<P>
He was succeeded by a nephew, P. Anthony Ridder, now president of Knight-Ridder 
Inc., parent company of the Mercury News and several other newspapers, 
including the Philadelphia Inquirer, the Miami Herald, the Journal of Commerce 
and the Detroit Free Press. 
</P>
<P>
Survivors include two brothers. Funeral services are scheduled today in 
Honolulu.

MERCANTILE EXCHANGE FORMS PANEL TO TIGHTEN TRADING CONTROLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<DATELINE>

CHICAGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange announced creation of a panel Wednesday to 
strengthen control over transactions as a federal grand jury convened to hear 
allegations of fraud in the financial futures industry. 
</P>
<P>
"It matters not whether this investigation involves one member, or many 
members, of the exchanges," said Leo Melamed, chairman of the Merc's executive 
committee and special counsel to the exchange's board of governors. 
</P>
<P>
"What matters is that we use this opportunity to act responsibly and make 
improvements where they are necessary," he said. "There will be no sacred 
cows." 
</P>
<P>
The panel, which will be charged with reviewing trading procedures and 
practices and recommending changes where necessary, is made up of five industry 
officials and five former or current public officials, including former Sen. 
Thomas Eagleton of Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, federal marshals sealed off the 16th floor of the downtown 
Everett Dirksen Federal Building, which in the past has been used for grand 
jury testimony. U.S. Atty. Anton Valukas, in keeping with office policy, would 
not even confirm that an investigation was under way. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
200 Subpoenas 
</P>
<P>
More than 200 subpoenas have been served on prominent brokers, traders and 
firms involved with the Merc and the Chicago Board of Trade, the world's 
largest futures exchanges, according to published reports. 
</P>
<P>
The subpoenaes resulted from a corruption investigation, Operation Sourmash, 
conducted by undercover FBI agents posing as traders. It reportedly centers on 
allegations that up to 100 brokers and traders cheated customers out of 
millions of dollars in deals on the exchange floors. 
</P>
<P>
Several attorneys complained that federal prosecutors, who accompanied FBI 
agents during late-night visits to some traders' homes last week, made veiled 
threats of confiscating property and other assets in hopes of enlisting the 
traders to cooperate, or provide information about others. 
</P>
<P>
The attorneys, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they were advising 
clients to pass up any government deals. 
</P>
<P>
Initial news reports panicked trading circles and spurred quick sales of seats 
on the two exchanges, but by Wednesday some of the clouds cast by the probe 
over the two exchanges had dispersed. 
</P>
<P>
The exchanges reported sales of 32 full and associate seats through midday 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Board of Trade spokesman Mark Prout said a trend that saw the value of full 
seats slip steadily from $410,000 last Thursday to $375,000 Monday had ended 
with a standing bid Wednesday to purchase a seat at $383,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Caution Urged 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be careful to read anything into this, especially at this early juncture," 
Prout said. "There are many more things that can move the markets than a 
pending investigation." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, trading volume in the soybean pits at the Board of Trade and the 
currency futures pits at the Merc, both apparently targeted by federal 
investigators, were consistent with business-as-usual projections.

LOWELL MILKEN IS MUCH MORE THAN OLDER BROTHER'S SHADOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Lowell Milken has been portrayed in the press as subordinate to his older 
brother, Michael, and the plea bargain struck by Drexel Burnham Lambert with 
the government is consistent with that image. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement requires Drexel to fire Michael Milken immediately and withhold 
all of his 1988 bonus. But Lowell Milken is allowed to receive half of his 
bonus from last year and can remain in his job until his anticipated indictment 
on criminal charges, which could come as soon as today. 
</P>
<P>
But people who know both men say that Lowell is more his brother's equal than 
his second-in-command, and that Lowell's grasp of nuance and detail provide a 
perfect complement for the broad strokes his brother painted across the 
financial landscape of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"I've read where Lowell is Michael's right-hand man, but people who say that 
don't understand the relationship," said a friend of both men. "They are 
brothers and they are very close. Lowell is Michael's confidant. But they are 
not twins. Lowell is his own man." 
</P>
<P>
Lowell Jay Milken, 40, grew up in the San Fernando Valley, graduated summa cum 
laude at UC Berkeley and was editor of the law review at UCLA law school. 
</P>
<P>
A decade ago, he left a promising career with the Los Angeles law firm of Irell 
&amp; Manella to join his brother in the fledgling "junk bond" operation that 
Michael had moved to Beverly Hills from Drexel's New York headquarters in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
"Lowell's primary area of practice was tax law, and I remember him as being 
exceptionally smart," said Edmund M. Kaufman, a senior partner at Irell &amp; 
Manella. "He was enjoying being a lawyer. He was very imaginative and creative, 
and he was extremely smart and a very hard worker." 
</P>
<P>
At its upper levels, where Milken appeared to be headed, tax law is 
intellectually challenging in addition to requiring enormous attention to 
detail. This penchant for detail made Lowell a vital adjunct to his brother -- 
and, along with his role as confidant, a target of the government investigators 
who have been on the elder Milken's trail for years. 
</P>
<P>
When he joined Michael at Drexel, Lowell's first job was managing the 
investments that Michael had been making for both of them over the years. In 
addition to administrative duties for the investment firm, Lowell analyzed the 
risks of potential deals and the financial data for the companies for which 
Drexel issued junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Valuable Real Estate 
</P>
<P>
As the junk bond business mushroomed, so did the wealth of the Milken brothers 
and many others who worked in the Beverly Hills office with them. Lowell 
increasingly assumed the job of managing the investments in land, office 
buildings and securities. 
</P>
<P>
Among the holdings of their numerous partnerships is the building at Wilshire 
Boulevard and Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills that houses Drexel's junk bond 
operation and Gump's, the fashionable department store. 
</P>
<P>
Lowell has a title of senior vice president at Drexel, and his office is within 
shouting distance of the big X-shaped trading desk where his brother ruled the 
junk bond business. 
</P>
<P>
Friends say the brothers are similar in many ways. Because they are only two 
years apart, they shared many of the same friends growing up and still do so as 
adults. Both are portrayed by friends and associates as devoted family men, 
while others say both can be abrasive in their relations with colleagues. Both 
wear toupees, and Lowell is shorter than his brother. 
</P>
<P>
Michael lives in an Encino house of modest proportions, at least for a man with 
an estimated personal net worth of close to $1 billion. Although Lowell is 
thought to be worth considerably less, his tastes appear to be a bit richer. 
</P>
<P>
Property records show that he and his wife, Sandra, own a 7,142-square-foot 
house on Mandeville Canyon Road near Topanga State Park in Los Angeles. The 
couple paid $869,500 for the property in 1979, and it is now valued at more 
than $1.3 million. The 37-year-old, stucco house has seven bedrooms, six baths 
and a pool. 
</P>
<P>
Records also show that they own a contemporary two-story beach house in Malibu 
with five bedrooms and four baths. They bought the house in 1984 for $975,000, 
apparently for cash, according to the records. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aids Many Charities 
</P>
<P>
In November, 1986, Lowell and Sandra Milken donated $7.6 million in cash and 
securities to create their own charitable foundation, which shares offices with 
Michael's three foundations. 
</P>
<P>
Lowell and his wife, who have three children, are big-league benefactors in 
their own right, handing out $1.2 million to 29 organizations in 1987. The 
largest grant, $450,000, went to the Jewish Federation Council of Los Angeles, 
and an education project received $323,000. 
</P>
<P>
Lowell has also been active in his brother's foundation, helping direct the 
contributions and serving as president of the biggest family charity. 
</P>
<P>
As their fortunes have become intertwined in recent years, so have their fates. 
Lowell joined his brother as a defendant in the civil suit filed in September 
by the Securities and Exchange Commission that charges them with stock 
manipulation and insider trading. And he seems likely to be indicted with his 
brother. 
</P>
<P>
Lowell's chief attorney, Michael F. Armstrong, reacted angrily to Drexel's 
decision to withhold half of Lowell's 1988 income, issuing a statement that 
called it a "blatant violation of his constitutional rights." 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong said the money was being withheld despite assurances from Drexel's 
chief executive, Frederick H. Joseph, that Joseph had no indication Lowell had 
done anything wrong. Armstrong also said one of Drexel's lawyers assured him 
earlier that the firm would refuse to settle with the government if the deal 
implied any wrongdoing on the part of Lowell Milken.

PIONEER, BILLIONAIRE -- AND, SOON, UNEMPLOYED; 
</P>
<P>
MICHAEL MILKEN MADE DREXEL A LEADER IN 'JUNK BONDS.' NOW IT HAS AGREED TO SACK 
HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
By the time he was a high school student in the San Fernando Valley, it was 
clear that Michael Milken had a bright future. He was voted most likely to 
succeed, head cheerleader, king of the senior prom and president of the men's 
honor organization. Classmates probably wouldn't have been surprised if he 
became a millionaire by the age of 30. 
</P>
<P>
By many estimates, Milken probably achieved that milestone, because by the age 
of 30 he was a fast-rising star at the fast-rising securities firm of Drexel 
Burnham Lambert Inc., managing its high-yield "junk bond" operations and 
reaping huge profits for the firm and himself. Last July, when he hit the age 
of 42, Milken had become one of the nation's richest men, with an estimated net 
worth of close to $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The news Wednesday that Milken will be fired by Drexel and will not paid his 
1988 bonus of $200 million as part of the company's settlement of securities 
fraud charges signals the end to the Milken era at Drexel. But it doesn't close 
the book on his impact on corporate America. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Robert Milken, the center of the nation's biggest securities fraud 
investigation ever, arguably is the most significant and visionary figure in 
American business in the 1980s, the J. P. Morgan of his generation who 
unleashed a revolution in how businesses raise capital to finance growth. 
</P>
<P>
Milken virtually single-handedly pioneered the modern junk bond market, now 
worth $180 billion in total bonds outstanding, and the fuel that has financed 
hundreds of small- and middle-size businesses and wave after wave of corporate 
takeovers. Milken's actions directly or indirectly touched the lives of 
millions of Americans, from ordinary workers to high-powered corporate 
executives. 
</P>
<P>
He also steered Wall Street into a new and far more aggressive role in 
takeovers -- and not just by advising in them or financing them. He actually 
created and built up entire entities and corporate raiders who launched bids, 
partly with the aim of reviving the era of the owner-manager and making giant 
corporations lean and mean again. 
</P>
<P>
"He has indelibly changed the course and face of the investment banking 
business and the economy as a whole," said Fredric Roberts, head of a Los 
Angeles investment banking firm bearing his name and Southern California 
district director for the National Assn. of Securities Dealers. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, for all his contributions, Milken's name is hardly a household word. He 
shunned publicity and did his deal-making in relative secrecy. 
</P>
<P>
He also has been a man of sharp contrasts. He has an unusual recollection of 
detail and could recite the terms on every high-yield bond in America. Yet he 
reportedly forgot who was the best man at his wedding. He is an intense 
workaholic who got to the office by 4:30 every morning and typically worked 
15-hour days. Yet he is described by friends as a devoted family man who, until 
his latest legal troubles mounted, spent long hours with his three children, 
all of whom have suffered from various health problems. 
</P>
<P>
History has yet to render a final verdict on Milken as a saint or a sinner, or 
something in between. His crowning achievement -- the creation and growth of 
the modern junk bond market -- has yet to weather a serious recession. And 
while his junk bond machine transformed Drexel from a second-rate securities 
firm into one of the most powerful on Wall Street, his alleged transgressions 
as its junk bond chief ultimately could be the firm's undoing. 
</P>
<P>
While Milken's junk bonds helped companies create thousands of new jobs, they 
also led to layoffs of workers at firms taken over by raiders financed by junk 
bonds. And while Milken's family foundations donated millions of dollars of his 
profits to various charitable causes, he also is accused of questionable 
practices that netted exorbitant profits for himself and colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
But whatever the future of Drexel and its once-star junk bond chief, it is 
clear that Milken is an exceptional individual who was driven from the very 
beginning with unusual determination. 
</P>
<P>
Born in the San Fernando Valley as the son of an accountant, Milken gained 
business experience as a teen-ager helping his father prepare tax returns. 
Attending Birmingham High School in Van Nuys, he served as head cheerleader on 
a squad that included future actress Sally Field. He was voted the "most 
spirited" and "friendliest" member of his graduating class of 1964. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Managed Investments 
</P>
<P>
"He was very successful in everything he did, whether it was sports or school 
service or debate," recalled Harry Horowitz, a Milken friend since childhood 
who followed him to Drexel and now serves as a senior vice president there. 
"He's always been in a leadership role in anything he's been involved with." 
</P>
<P>
Milken then earned an undergraduate degree in business administration at UC 
Berkeley, avoiding the anti-war campus unrest of the time, serving instead as 
president of his fraternity. As a sidelight, Milken managed investments for a 
small group of clients, eating losses himself in exchange for half the profits. 
</P>
<P>
After marrying his high-school sweetheart, Lori Hackel, Milken moved to the 
Philadelphia area, where he attended the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton 
Graduate School of Business, becoming one of its brightest students and working 
part time in the Philadelphia office of a precursor to Drexel Burnham Lambert. 
</P>
<P>
While at Wharton, Milken began to take an interest in the securities that would 
make him legendary. 
</P>
<P>
Junk bonds at the time were primarily debt issues that were once highly rated 
but had fallen in value and increased in risk when the issuing companies fell 
on hard times. Milken believed that investors were overly pessimistic about 
these bonds -- which often could be bought for as little as 20 cents or 30 
cents on the dollar -- and that their higher yields more than compensated for 
their added risk of default. Investors holding diversified portfolios of many 
junk bonds would earn higher profits, even if some of the bonds defaulted, he 
reasoned. 
</P>
<P>
Milken's shrewd trading of junk bonds soon began making millions of dollars for 
Drexel -- and for himself and his band of hard-working traders and salesmen. 
Finally, in 1978, Milken asked to move the junk bond trading operation from New 
York to the Century City section of Los Angeles. (It moved in 1983 to its 
present home on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills.) Out West, Milken felt he could 
work long hours yet still be home in time for dinner with his family. Milken, 
friends say, also wanted to be close to his father, who was then dying of 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Began Underwriting 
</P>
<P>
Drexel executives were reportedly uncomfortable with the move because it also 
would give Milken more independence. But they granted it because they had no 
choice, given Milken's megabuck success. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, Milken found that trading junk bonds wasn't enough. He and Drexel began 
underwriting new junk bonds, issued by companies that were too small, young or 
risky to get conventional bank loans or issue conventional high-rated corporate 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Milken viewed the issuance of junk bonds by small- and medium-size companies as 
part of a crusade to change the face of corporate America. Milken correctly 
felt that those companies were the economy's true job creators, and allowing 
them access to capital markets would unleash a wave of entrepreneurial 
innovation that would make America more competitive. 
</P>
<P>
To spur this crusade, Milken also created and unleashed a stable of corporate 
raiders whose hostile takeover bids were made possible by junk financing. 
Milken-backed entrepreneurs -- such as T. Boone Pickens Jr., who launched 
unsuccessful bids for Phillips Petroleum, Gulf Oil and Unocal; Ronald O. 
Perelman, who took over Revlon, and Carl C. Icahn, who took over TWA -- would 
displace managements that had grown tired and stale, Milken reasoned. 
</P>
<P>
"Capital is no longer a scarce resource," Milken told a group of high school 
students in a 1986 speech. "(The) scarce resource today is management, 
knowledge, vision, dealing with change, recognizing what people want and need 
in the future and the ability to work together." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Showed Genuine Interest 
</P>
<P>
Businessmen were mesmerized by Milken's broad insight, knowledge and charm. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy was extremely supportive," said Robert Berglass, chairman and 
president of Dep Corp., a Rancho Dominguez-based manufacturer of cosmetics and 
other personal-care products. "I got a feeling that he had a genuine interest 
in our ideas as to how to grow." Since Drexel became its investment banker in 
1986, Dep's sales and employment have more than doubled, Berglass said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd talk to Mike from time to time just to get ideas," said Eli Broad, 
chairman and chief executive of Kaufman &amp; Broad, a Los Angeles home builder 
and occasional Drexel client. "He had a pretty broad window on the world. He 
must have talked to 200 people a day, so he was a good source of information 
and ideas." 
</P>
<P>
Companies ranging from MCI to Metromedia, from Holiday Inns to Levitz 
Furniture, used Drexel-underwritten bonds to finance growth or takeovers. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike's a builder; everything he's touched has been the better for it," 
colleague Horowitz said. "These companies didn't have opportunities to raise 
money in the capital markets. Some were in industries that didn't even exist 
before." Entire industry segments, such as health maintenance organizations, 
home building, entertainment and hotels, derived much of their financing 
through Drexel's junk juggernaut, Horowitz notes. 
</P>
<P>
Milken also is described by colleagues as a supportive, although somewhat 
harried, manager. He typically slept only three or four hours a night at his 
Encino home and was at his desk every morning at 4:30, hours that his staff 
often kept as well. He had no office, instead occupying the middle of an 
X-shaped desk where he was constantly on the phone or monitoring his staff of 
more than 100 traders, whom he saw "as his extended family," as one colleague 
put it. Clients or others seeking appointments with Milken sometimes had to 
meet him at unusual times -- like 5 a.m. on Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Manipulation Claimed 
</P>
<P>
Yet Milken took great pains to be with his family, particularly his daughter, 
who suffers from a form of epilepsy, and his two sons, Horowitz said. This past 
week, pulled away from his family to New York to plan his legal strategies, he 
brought an extra set of his childrens' school books so he could help them with 
their homework, Horowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the image of Milken as a devoted father and charitable giver, 
federal investigators and critics believe that he built his junk bond empire 
partly on deceit and manipulation. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators believe that institutions and individuals may have been pressured 
into buying and selling junk bonds through an incestuous system of favors and 
obligations. Junk bond issuers often were asked to buy junk bonds issued by 
other corporations. Those that did not often found themselves frozen out of 
future Milken deals. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel and Milken defenders say such practices were necessary to maintain 
orderly markets in junk bonds where there were few buyers and sellers anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators might have overlooked such practices were it not also for alleged 
illegal activities related to Milken's involvement in corporate takeovers. 
Although takeovers account for only about a fourth of junk bonds issued, the 
Securities and Exchange Commission and federal prosecutors charge, among other 
things, that Drexel's junk bond operations engaged in an array of securities 
violations, including market manipulation, inadequate disclosure, "parking" of 
securities to hide their true ownership and other infractions. 
</P>
<P>
Milken is expected to be indicted separately on these charges soon, possibly 
this week. And Drexel's expected guilty pleas will not help his defense, a 
situation that Milken supporters at Drexel say amounts to a cold betrayal of 
the man who put the firm on the map. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Repairing His Image 
</P>
<P>
People close to Milken say he is convinced of his innocence and is willing to 
undergo a lengthy trial to prove it. He also feels misunderstood and maligned 
by the public and the news media -- but his reluctance to talk to reporters 
reinforced such an image. 
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, Milken has moved in the past year to try to repair his public 
persona. Once totally inaccessible to the media, Milken recently has granted 
interviews, often discussing one of his newer interests: how to solve the Third 
World debt problems by refinancing underdeveloped nations' bank loans. 
</P>
<P>
He also has taken pains to publicize his charitable activities, which ranged 
from taking underprivileged children to baseball games to donating millions of 
dollars to charities. Among his favorite causes: cancer research, youth 
organizations and Jewish community organizations. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike always had a vision of being successful and wanting to help others from 
behind the scenes," Horowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet although Milken's spirits are high, the legal pressures have taken their 
toll, colleagues and friends say. "Mike's worked for Drexel for 17 years, he 
never worked anywhere else," one friend said. "Now all that is being taken away 
from him."

RUDER URGES CAUTION IN STEMMING LBOS; 
</P>
<P>
CHANGING TAX LAWS COULD CREATE PROBLEMS IN MARKETS, HE SAYS

<P>
The chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission urged Congress Wednesday 
to move cautiously in trying to use tax law changes to stem the current wave of 
leveraged buyouts. 
</P>
<P>
"You should be aware that your committee's activities may influence a stock 
market that is skittish and nervous," SEC Chairman David S. Ruder told the 
Senate Finance Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Ruder said SEC studies after the October, 1987, stock market crash showed that 
one factor contributing to its severity was legislation then being considered 
by the House Ways and Means Committee to curtail some of the deductions on 
interest paid by companies to holders of high-yield junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Ruder admitted that the double taxation of dividends -- first as part of the 
34% income tax on corporations and again when they are distributed to 
shareholders as personal income -- is helping drive the leveraged buyout or LBO 
phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
But he said he opposed taxing the interest that leveraged companies pay on junk 
bonds as a way of equalizing the tax treatment between the two primary means 
for raising capital: issuing debt or stock. 
</P>
<P>
Ruder, like Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, who testified before him on 
Tuesday, said the better alternative would be to allow companies to treat as a 
deductible expense the dividends they pay or to give shareholders a tax credit 
for the corporate income taxes paid by a company. 
</P>
<P>
But like Brady, he added, "I do not believe we can do that, given our enormous 
deficit problem." 
</P>
<P>
In an LBO, an investment group borrows heavily in order to buy out stockholders 
and take over the company. Often LBOs are proposed by managers seeking to 
thwart a hostile takeover. 
</P>
<P>
The company's new owners either cut costs or sell off pieces of the company to 
pay back loans. Critics of the practice fear that the high debt levels, in a 
recession, would endanger both the bought-out company and the banks and 
brokerage firms financing the buyout. 
</P>
<P>
Both the tax-writing Finance and Ways and Means committees are re-examining 
leveraged buyouts in the wake of the pending $25-billion purchase of RJR 
Nabisco by LBO specialist Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. and the $13-billion 
buyout of Kraft by Philip Morris last year. 
</P>
<P>
Those were the two biggest of more than 300 leveraged buyouts totaling nearly 
$100 billion in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.), the Finance Committee's chairman, said the primary 
concern is the possibility that the recent surge of leveraged buyouts "has 
created a mountain of corporate debt that will make our next recession deeper 
and longer than it needs to be." 
</P>
<P>
While Bentsen said the goal is to balance the attractiveness of equity and debt 
financing that is clearly tilted to the debt side under current tax laws, he 
acknowledged that it is going to be difficult to find the right combination of 
"carrots and sticks."

U.S. ECONOMY IS HEATING UP, FED REPORT SAYS

The Federal Reserve Board, which has vowed to keep the economy from overheating 
and risking higher inflation, said Wednesday that the pace of activity picked 
up in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
In a report, the Fed said the economy gained momentum, especially from consumer 
spending and manufacturing output, in December and early January, compared to 
the prior six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"It would appear . . . that the national economy gained momentum in recent 
weeks as consumer spending strengthened, manufacturing activity continued to 
rise and producers scheduled more investment in plant and equipment," the Fed 
said in a periodic report on the economy called the "tan book" by Fed watchers 
on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
In 11 of 12 Federal Reserve districts around the country, retail sales in 
December met or exceeded retailers' expectations, the report said. Three 
districts said the moderate-to-strong pace of sales continued through early 
January. 
</P>
<P>
In manufacturing, "several industries were reported to be operating at high 
capacity utilization rates, but only a few, such as chemicals, claimed capacity 
limits had constrained production," the Fed said.

Weirton Steel Corp. said it would go public to raise money for a $600-million 
modernization project under a plan allowing workers at the nation's largest 
employee-owned company to retain a majority stake. The West Virginia company 
said it will apply for a listing on the New York Stock Exchange when it goes 
public later this year, pending approval of the plan by employees. The 
agreement between the company's management and the Independent Steelworkers 
Union would reduce the 8,000 employees' profit sharing from 50% to 35% of the 
company's after-tax income. The company's pension plan would not change.

The projected sale of Turner Broadcasting System's CNN Building in Atlanta for 
$170 million has encountered a hitch. A letter of intent for an acquisition of 
the office-hotel-shopping complex by 66 Properties Inc., which was announced 
last Nov. 7, "expired without consummation," Turner said. However, Paul D. 
Beckham, senior vice president of finance and administration, said talks with 
66 Properties have been continuing and Turner still intends to sell the 
building "on the appropriate terms."

The SEC has filed suit in Manhattan against two stockbrokers alleging they 
cornered the market and manipulated the stock of Chase Medical Group Inc. in a 
classic short squeeze designed to defraud outside investors. The defendants in 
the suit are Vincent Militano, 36, of Plainview, N.Y., and Milton Sonneberg, 
42, of Woodmere, N.Y. The two work for Moore &amp; Schley, Cameron &amp; Co., a 
New York-based broker-dealer firm that was not charged in the suit. The two 
could not be reached for comment. Miami-based Chase Medical operates medical 
centers in southern Florida. Its shares are traded on the American Stock 
Exchange.

A Supreme Court justice cleared the way for a second trial of GAF Corp. on 
charges of stock manipulation by lifting his order that blocked a new trial on 
possible grounds of "double jeopardy." Justice Thurgood Marshall, who issued a

NEWLY MERGED MOLSON, CARLING TO CLOSE 7 BREWERIES

Molson Cos. and Carling O'Keefe Breweries said Wednesday that they will close 
seven of 16 breweries across Canada over the next three years after completing 
the proposed merger of their North American beer operations. 
</P>
<P>
The companies, which became Canada's No. 1 brewer under the merger announced 
last week, will eliminate 500 full-time jobs and slash their payroll by another 
900 employees through attrition and early retirement incentives. 
</P>
<P>
The merger and consolidation, coming at a time of flat consumer growth in 
Canada, is part of an effort to make greater headway into the competitive U.S. 
market. 
</P>
<P>
"The new efficiencies will allow us to be more cost competitive in the U.S.," 
Molson spokesman Barry Joslin said. 
</P>
<P>
The Toronto-based companies also announced that they will invest $186 million 
(220 Canadian dollars) to improve production efficiency and packaging capacity 
at the remaining nine breweries. 
</P>
<P>
Molson and Carling, a unit of Australian-based conglomerate Elders IXL Ltd., 
announced the merger last week. They employ a total of 7,500 people. 
</P>
<P>
Canada's national beer companies were required to build breweries in all 
regions of the country because of provincial beer regulations which limit the 
distribution of beer to the province where it is made. 
</P>
<P>
The savings "will be substantial," Joslin said. "It will translate into higher 
earnings."

Standard Pacific LP, a Costa Mesa home builder, said its earnings rose to a 
record $75.4 million in 1988, up 72% from $43.7 million the previous year. 
Revenue was up 29% to $492 million, compared to $381 million a year earlier. 
For the fourth quarter, Standard Pacific said its earnings jumped 163% to $32.4 
million from $12.3 million in the same period a year earlier. Revenue for the 
quarter increased to $165 million from $133 million. Spokesman April Morris 
attributed the company's performance to the strength of California's 
residential markets. "Our primary market is Northern California and Ventura, 
Orange and San Diego counties," she said. "Each of those areas have experienced 
tremendous demand." Units of Standard Pacific, a publicly traded limited 
partnership, rose 87.5 cents Tuesday to close at $14.50.

If you're one of those people who would rather do it yourself, Flying Colours 
in Irvine may be for you. 
</P>
<P>
The sportswear shop lets customers create their own painted designs on 
sportswear. Non-toxic paints and glitters are used to create personalized works 
of art on apparel or accessories. 
</P>
<P>
Shoppers apply the paints in one of eight work stations. Then the clothing is 
put through a spinner, to "spin out" the design, said Bobbie Friedlander, the 
store's owner. "So if you put too much or too little paint, it still looks 
good." Heat-setting then makes the clothing wash-and-wearable. 
</P>
<P>
The average cost of a spin-art T-shirt, including paints, is about $14 plus 
tax, according to the store. 
</P>
<P>
Friedlander said she got the idea for the store -- which sells pre-decorated 
and unadorned clothing -- from several similar shops in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The concept seems to work. Since Flying Colours opened last month, Friedlander 
said, the store has been busy with customers of all ages. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a lady in her 70s here now who made two sweat shirts," Friedlander 
said. The other day, some Girl Scouts came in the store and tried their hands 
at painting clothes. "We've had a lot of college students, too," Friedlander 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Flying Colours is on Campus Drive in the Marketplace shopping center.

CUSTOMERS PAY LAST RESPECTS TO STATION RUNNING OUT OF GAS ON BALBOA ISLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TYLER L. CHIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hal Holleman pulled into his favorite service station for the last time 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"How many gas stations can you pull into with your car, and they will clean 
your windshield, and you got a tail light broken, and they will put one in . . 
. and check your tires and check your oil while gassing you up?" Holleman 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
He was quick with the answer: "You won't find it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Holleman was among many customers visiting the only gas station still serving 
affluent Balboa Island, to say goodby and to thank owner James Jennings and his 
employees for the service they have received over the years. 
</P>
<P>
It was not uncommon, for example, for customers to leave their children under 
the watchful eyes of station employees while they went shopping. 
</P>
<P>
"We've operated this (business) on a first-name basis," Jennings said. 
"Everybody knows everybody, and everybody trusts everybody." 
</P>
<P>
A victim of low sales and soaring land values, the tiny, four-pump Unocal 
station at the corner of Marine and Park avenues will close as soon as it sells 
its remaining 1,500 gallons of gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
That's expected to happen sometime Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Jennings, who has owned the station for 30 years, said he saw the writing on 
the wall after Unocal Corp. informed him 3 months ago that his monthly lease 
would not be renewed after it expired this month. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't feel it's an economic station," Unocal spokesman Arthur Bentley said. 
"The property is more valuable if we sell it than the income it generates." 
</P>
<P>
Customers and residents -- at Jennings' urging -- delivered a petition with 
about 2,000 signatures and wrote letters to the oil company in an unsuccessful 
effort to save the business. 
</P>
<P>
Jennings said he eventually came to understand Unocal's position after he "got 
over the initial shock." His station only pumps 25,000 gallons of gas a month, 
and it should be pumping more than 100,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"At first I was upset about it," he said. "But now that I know it's inevitable, 
I'm looking forward to retirement." 
</P>
<P>
Unocal has been fair, he said. The company waived his last month's rent and 
offered to sell him the 60-by-80-foot lot on which the station sits for 
$649,000. He said he didn't have the money to buy it. 
</P>
<P>
According to Rumbold Realty, an average Balboa Island home on a 30-by-85-foot 
lot sells for $445,000 and up. Bay-front homes go for $995,000 and up. 
</P>
<P>
Starting today, the station will drop its gas price from $1.29 to 49 cents per 
gallon. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll lose $500 or $600, but that's our way of leaving," said mechanic Tom 
Castro, who along with two other station employees will open an auto repair 
shop in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"They are more friends than customers."

BRITISH FIRM LOANS $1.75 MILLION IN DEAL WITH GENERAL AUTOMATION

<P>
General Automation Inc. said it has completed a financing arrangement that 
gives a British electronics firm the option to acquire a majority of General 
Automation's stock. 
</P>
<P>
The deal with Sanderson Electronics PLC gives struggling General Automation a 
$1.75-million loan. Sanderson has the option to convert the loan to stock in 
the Anaheim computer maker. The deal also gives Sanderson warrants to acquire 
additional stock. If the firm converts the loan and exercises all the warrants, 
it will control 51% of General Automation's common stock. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard Mackenzie, General Automation's vice chairman and chief executive, said 
Sanderson funded the $1.75-million loan on Tuesday. The money will be used for 
general working capital, he said. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the deal with Sanderson, General Automation also had agreed to a 
management restructuring and said it would lay off 65 of its 390 workers -- 
most of them at its facility in England. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Thompson, chairman and managing director of Sanderson, became General 
Automation's chairman as part of the restructuring. He said the cost-cutting 
measures are expected to reduce sales and general and administrative expenses 
by $2 million a year. JOHN O'DELL

EXISTING HOME SALES RISE 2.9% FOR 1988

Sales of existing single-family homes last year hit their highest level since 
1979 as buyers shopped in lower price ranges rather than leave the market when 
costs rose, a real estate trade group said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The National Assn. of Realtors said 3.63 million homes were sold in 1988, up 
2.9% from 1987 when 3.53 million homes had been sold. It was the highest sales 
volume since 3.83 million homes were sold in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Sales shot up 11.4% in December to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.09 
million units. It was the highest month-to-month increase since an 11.6% rise 
in April, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"For the most part, people seem to be buying less expensive homes," said Ira 
Gribin, president of the realtors group. "The demand is there. People still 
appear to be going for the most they can afford. They just can't afford as 
much." 
</P>
<P>
Home prices slipped slightly to $87,700 in December, compared to a median sales 
price of $88,000 in November. Prices averaged $89,100 for all of 1988, a 4.1% 
increase.

LOBBYING WAR EXPECTED OVER EXTENDING 1984 CURBS ON FOREIGN-PRODUCED STEEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The new session of Congress signals the beginning of a lobbying war over 
whether the United States should extend soon-to-expire steel import curbs that 
have helped the U.S. steel industry become profitable. 
</P>
<P>
The current import ceilings, which were negotiated in the fall of 1984, expire 
Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Already there has been "a lot of rhetoric" on whether they should be renewed, 
William Reinsch, steel trade expert for Sen. John Heinz (R-Pa.), said this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
"In terms of parties coming and sitting down, it's just now beginning to heat 
up," Reinsch said. 
</P>
<P>
Pressured by the steel industry and by Congress, the Reagan administration 
negotiated 5-year steel trade agreements with Japan, South Korea, the European 
Community and other leading steel-exporting nations. 
</P>
<P>
The idea was to give American companies breathing space from subsidized foreign 
competitors by pressuring the competitors to restrict imports on a 
product-by-product basis. 
</P>
<P>
USX Corp., Bethlehem Steel Corp., LTV Steel Co. and other large steel companies 
have begun pushing for an extension of the curbs beyond 1989. 
</P>
<P>
But with the steel industry turning a second consecutive profit last year and 
with some importers complaining of steel product shortages, it is no sure bet 
that the large firms will win renewal of as strong a package of quotas as those 
of 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Three days before winning the November election, President Bush pledged to 
continue the so-called Voluntary Restraint Agreements in some form. But 
opponents of the plan believe that they can make a case for ending or at least 
scaling down the import curbs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Import Reductions 
</P>
<P>
There is little argument that the curbs have aided the steel industry's 
revival. Imports have been reduced from 26.4% of the American market in 1984 to 
about 20.5% last year. Meanwhile, employment and profits of U.S. steel 
companies were up last year over 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The issue is whether the quota agreements are still necessary, and to what 
degree, if any, they have harmed sectors of the American economy other than 
steel companies. 
</P>
<P>
The Precision Metalforming Assn., an industry group, says the availability of 
steel has been reduced because of the import curbs. The association represents 
hundreds of metal product manufacturers of such products as brake pedals and 
computer frames. 
</P>
<P>
"Our position is because of the restrictions on steel supplies -- which cause 
increases in prices and limited availability -- we would rather see the most 
open and competitive steel market possible," spokesman Greg Estell said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The steel trade issue has already spawned some angry language. 
</P>
<P>
After Caterpillar Inc. of Peoria, Ill., issued a September, 1988, paper arguing 
against continued import ceilings, the American Iron and Steel Institute soon 
compiled a 20-page, point-by-point rebuttal. 
</P>
<P>
In the Jan. 1 rebuttal, the trade association accused Caterpillar of "numerous 
distortions and inaccuracies." The paper claimed that the import curbs "do not 
cause steel price increases or otherwise impede the competitiveness of U.S. 
manufacturers."

<P>
If not for the sign out front that says "Orange County Harbor Municipal Court," 
the sprawling, low-slung building at the corner of Jamboree Boulevard and Birch 
Street in Newport Beach could be mistaken for some kind of bargain outlet 
having a big sale. 
</P>
<P>
It's only 8 a.m. Monday morning, and already people are jostling for parking 
spaces, then rushing inside with their credit cards, checkbooks and wallets at 
the ready. Others are lining up at the row of windows outside, also prepared to 
pay up. 
</P>
<P>
But these folks won't be walking away with any merchandise. All they'll take 
home will be little slips of paper, not very different from the ones they hold 
going in. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to traffic court. 
</P>
<P>
With about 500,000 traffic tickets issued in Orange County every year, business 
is always booming for Harbor and the county's four other municipal courts. 
</P>
<P>
The overwhelming majority of those tickets can be handled without an appearance 
in court, says James R. Peterson, court administrator for Harbor. But an 
increasing number of offenders are going in anyway, in hope of getting a break 
or at least a bargain. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, says Commissioner Richard Sullivan, who will be presiding over 
one of two traffic courts here today, even a minor offense can set you back 
plenty these days, not to mention what it can do to your insurance rates. 
</P>
<P>
It can be especially expensive if you just mail in a check for the amount of 
bail indicated on your ticket -- that could well be more than twice what a 
judge would order you to pay. 
</P>
<P>
"As a consequence, more and more people are coming to court to give an 
explanation to the judge," Sullivan says. 
</P>
<P>
So much for that famous line from Alfred Hitchcock's "North by Northwest" in 
1959: "Oh, Roger. Pay the $2!" Now it would have to be, "Pay the $200!" and 
that just doesn't have the same ring to it, somehow. 
</P>
<P>
Here they come, then, stern expressions on their faces, pacing and glancing 
frequently at their watches, giving the impression that they'd rather be just 
about any place else right now -- except jail, and for some, that's the 
alternative. 
</P>
<P>
"You really can't blame the people," Sullivan says. "These are all local 
people. Out-of-towners (who get tickets) can't come to court and tell their 
story; they don't have that convenience. Not that it's a convenience." 
</P>
<P>
Speeding, running red lights or stop signs, expired registrations, no 
insurance, broken windshields, unsafe lane changes -- whatever the specific 
charges, these are all relatively minor infractions. The more serious cases, 
such as drunk driving, are heard in other courtrooms upstairs. 
</P>
<P>
Some defendants come in to proclaim their innocence; their cases are scheduled 
for trial at a later date, which means another trip to court. 
</P>
<P>
Others acknowledge their offense but figure it might help to offer an 
explanation or simply plead for mercy. And often they're right. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Sullivan says, if a driver is caught speeding, an officer might 
"cite the person for going in excess of the speed limit and for unsafe speed. 
That just kicks the bail way the heck up into the clouds. Now the officer 
didn't intend to do that, but maybe he just doesn't understand the court 
system." 
</P>
<P>
So when drivers in such situations show up before him, Sullivan says he throws 
out one of the charges. "Nobody in this court is going to punish the person 
twice for something like that," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Others could have sent in a check and avoided a trip to court, but they forgot 
or just didn't get around to it. Months later, when they discover there's a 
warrant out for their arrest, they remember. But by then they're charged not 
only with a traffic violation but with failure to appear. 
</P>
<P>
The truth be told -- and why not, this is a courtroom, after all -- the 
defendants aren't the only ones who would rather be doing something else. The 
judges feel almost the same way, albeit for a different reason: They would 
prefer dealing with something more interesting. 
</P>
<P>
"I get so tired of listening to myself say the same things over and over," 
Sullivan says. "If the only thing I did, day after day, was traffic, I don't 
know if I could take it." Fortunately, Sullivan does get to deal with other 
kinds of cases as well. 
</P>
<P>
While Sullivan is in his chambers attending to a few details and putting on his 
robe, bailiff Robert D'Alessandro is in the courtroom doing the warm-up. 
</P>
<P>
No, he's not telling jokes to get everybody in a better mood. He's explaining 
how the process works, in the hope that things will go more smoothly for 
everyone involved. 
</P>
<P>
"You can plead not guilty, guilty or guilty with an explanation," D'Alessandro 
says. He explains about traffic school, an option for those whose offenses are 
not too serious and who have not attended one in the last 2 years. 
</P>
<P>
Most of these people, with the possible exception of a few recent Central 
American immigrants, have seen every TV courtroom show from "Perry Mason" to 
"People's Court" to "L.A. Law." They know they're supposed to say "your honor" 
when they address the judge. They've heard phrases such as, "May I approach the 
bench?" but they're not sure in what circumstances it might be appropriate to 
use them. 
</P>
<P>
They'll have to wing it, however, because none of them came with an attorney. 
Hardly anyone does in traffic court. 
</P>
<P>
This is most likely the closest any of them ever will come to feeling like a 
criminal, the only time they will have to stand up in a courtroom, knees 
trembling, and answer the question, "How do you plead?" 
</P>
<P>
D'Alessandro's audience is diverse, although not exactly a cross-section of the 
county's population. There is a preponderance of men here, especially young 
men. There seems to be a large proportion of immigrants too. For those who 
speak Spanish, a translator is standing by. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the defendants are dressed in business suits or nice dresses, in 
deference to the court or possibly to the job for which they will be a few 
hours late this morning. Others make do with clean blue jeans. Some men in 
jackets and ties are also wearing tennies. That's OK; the judge is wearing 
sneakers too. 
</P>
<P>
"Remain seated; come to order; court is now in session," D'Alessandro proclaims 
as Sullivan walks into the room. No "all rise" or "hear ye, hear ye." So much 
for TV. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan calls the first six names. Those defendants walk to the front of the 
room and sit in a row of black vinyl chairs. 
</P>
<P>
"Would you be interested in traffic school?" Sullivan asks the first young man, 
a speeder. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," says the defendant. At $45, traffic school is not only a bargain but a 
way of keeping the offense off your record. But traffic school is an option 
just once every 2 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Have you been to traffic school in the last 2 years?" Sullivan asks the next 
man. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," he says quietly. 
</P>
<P>
"On this charge, then, how do you plead?" 
</P>
<P>
"Guilty." 
</P>
<P>
"Did you see the signs?" Sullivan does not specify what the violation is. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, yes, but I'd just got off work, and I'd had an argument. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
". . . And your mind was over there somewhere," Sullivan says, not without 
sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah." 
</P>
<P>
"See the bailiff." 
</P>
<P>
D'Alessandro directs the offender to the next room, where he can settle up with 
the cashier. 
</P>
<P>
Next is a young man who got caught riding a motorcycle without the proper 
license. That costs him $64, plus another $92 for not showing up when he was 
supposed to. 
</P>
<P>
A young man who was caught driving a lowered vehicle gets a stern lecture. 
</P>
<P>
"I consider a lowered vehicle a serious violation," Sullivan says. "If you come 
in here again, the fine will be horrendous. When a vehicle is too low, if you 
have a flat tire it bottoms out, spins, runs into me, and I get killed. Have 
that vehicle signed off." 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, sir." 
</P>
<P>
After a couple of traffic school candidates, the black chairs are empty and 
Sullivan calls the next group. He goes through the cases quickly, rarely 
stopping to identify the charges. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's start with your driver's license. If you have one, show it to the 
bailiff," Sullivan says to the next young man. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you have insurance?" 
</P>
<P>
"No." 
</P>
<P>
"Why didn't you pay your fine?" 
</P>
<P>
"I did try to pay, your honor. I had my girlfriend come to court with the 
money. But she split and took the money with her. She was on drugs real bad, 
and. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The man has already spent 14 hours in jail because a warrant was issued for his 
arrest when he didn't show in court. 
</P>
<P>
"The (Department of Motor Vehicles) has been notified that you have no 
insurance, and your license will be suspended for 60 days," Sullivan advises 
the man before sending him to the bailiff. 
</P>
<P>
Next is a Spanish-speaking man, charged with driving without a license, and 
without insurance. His total comes to $202. 
</P>
<P>
Another Spanish-speaking man, without insurance and with other problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Have you corrected the front windshield?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," the translator says. 
</P>
<P>
"Show us proof." 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't brought it over to have it checked yet," the translator says. 
</P>
<P>
The next defendant ran a stop sign and wants to go to traffic school. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a $45 school fee. Do you have it with you today?" 
</P>
<P>
"No, your honor," he says. 
</P>
<P>
"Can you bring it in 2 weeks?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes." 
</P>
<P>
"See the bailiff." 
</P>
<P>
"We scheduled a trial on Jan. 3 at your request," Sullivan tells the next 
defendant, a young woman. "You did not show up. Is that correct?" 
</P>
<P>
"I was. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"That doesn't answer my question." He repeats it. 
</P>
<P>
"That is correct," she says, turning pale. "I was ill, and I have a note from 
my doctor. I really appreciate your consideration." 
</P>
<P>
After a thoughtful pause, Sullivan says, "How about Feb. 7? Is that a good 
date?" 
</P>
<P>
"That'll be fine, your honor," the woman says as the color returns to her face. 
</P>
<P>
("We've never had anybody faint," D'Alessandro had said earlier. "But some of 
the women start crying.") 
</P>
<P>
"Fred," says Sullivan to the next person, in a congenial tone. "A couple of 
matters seem to have slipped by you here. But it's only been 3 years. Where've 
you been?" 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't had a job in 4 years, sir," the defendant says. "I couldn't pay it. 
Now I have a job, so I can pay it now." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan doesn't take time to explain that if the man had showed up for his 
scheduled dates, job or no job, he wouldn't have been charged twice with 
failure to appear. 
</P>
<P>
The cases go by quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"Michael, do you have a Class 4 license?" 
</P>
<P>
"No." 
</P>
<P>
"I've asked for an extension," another defendant says. 
</P>
<P>
"Why? You've had plenty of time," Sullivan says. "You just didn't get around to 
it. I could fill this room with people who just didn't get around to it. See 
the bailiff." 
</P>
<P>
A woman who was ticketed for running a red light has brought in photos mounted 
on poster board to use in presenting her case. "You won't need that until your 
trial," Sullivan says, and she packs it all up. 
</P>
<P>
Excuses, excuses: 
</P>
<P>
"The car threw a rod out, your honor, so I can't drive it up to have it 
inspected," a defendant says. 
</P>
<P>
"The person I bought the bike from had to go to Ohio and hasn't come back." 
</P>
<P>
"I've been on disability, and my check hasn't arrived." 
</P>
<P>
"Since October?" Sullivan asks, incredulous. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife kidnaped my children and took them to Wisconsin," says another man who 
failed to appear three times for a speeding violation. "I wasn't thinking too 
clearly." 
</P>
<P>
When Sullivan tells him he'll have to pay a fine, he asks, "Can I do community 
service instead?" Community service means putting on one of those orange vests 
and spending a day or more cleaning up litter along the freeways. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know about that," Sullivan says. "I don't know how your head is. It 
doesn't seem to be screwed on right." 
</P>
<P>
"How do you plead?" he asks a young woman. 
</P>
<P>
"Guilty," she says. "I don't even think I was speeding but I can't come back 
for trial. I was in the slow lane on one of the world's slowest freeways, and I 
was about to get off. I was going 55, maybe." 
</P>
<P>
"The CHP has the speedometers checked on their patrol cars regularly," Sullivan 
says. "See the bailiff." 
</P>
<P>
"Is there any way I can get that reduced?" asks a young woman, obviously 
nervous. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't set any amount yet," Sullivan says. 
</P>
<P>
"It says $266," she says. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, I don't pay any attention to the bonds," he says. "My fines are probably 
about 6 times as high as the bonds." 
</P>
<P>
The young woman looks as if she might faint. But then Sullivan's face breaks 
into an exaggerated smile, and she laughs nervously. 
</P>
<P>
She gets by with a $97 fine. 
</P>
<P>
By about 10:30 a.m., Sullivan has dispensed with the first group, so he 
declares a recess and goes back to his chambers. After about an hour, the room 
fills up again, and the process starts over. 
</P>
<P>
The traffic windows outside the court building open at 7:30 a.m., and some of 
the drivers who check in there either choose to go to court or are required to 
appear. After the initial morning rush, more customers straggle in through the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
In the afternoon, a lawyer comes in, a nattily dressed, brusque contrast to the 
defendants representing themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"OK, you can talk to me about it, but nobody's going to traffic school out of 
this court for doing 85 m.p.h.," Sullivan says. "Looks like we'll be doing some 
business on the 30th, then." 
</P>
<P>
After a few more hours of listening to excuses and asking over and over, "Have 
you been to traffic school in the last 2 years?" Sullivan is done for the day. 
This has been a light day, he says, and it helps that it's Monday, when no 
trials are scheduled for the afternoon because night court begins at 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Sullivan looks as if he could use an aspirin. 
</P>
<P>
"It gets tedious," he says. "I get so tired of hearing people say, 'I forgot,' 
or just not taking it seriously. But I can't think of any other system that 
would work better. What can you do? People have the right to a hearing."

GUYS &amp; GALLEYS: YOU CAN'T PREPARE TOO MUCH

"Always cook too much because even that won't be enough." That's the theory on 
which Israel Paskowitz operates in the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
It was formulated, he says, from being raised in the sprawling and 
internationally known surfing family of Juliet and Dr. Dorian Paskowitz (there 
are nine children in all: eight boys and one girl). 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody was always late, and when they did show up, they'd have someone with 
them," says Israel, 24. "Or the first ones to eat were hungry again, so there 
had to be plenty of food." 
</P>
<P>
The problem is it's a habit he can't seem to get out of, even though he's 
married and cooking for only himself and wife Danielle. 
</P>
<P>
"She's always kidding me about the amount of food I prepare, only sometimes I'm 
not sure she's kidding." 
</P>
<P>
Paskowitz, the surfing world's reigning long-board champion and an aspiring 
actor and model,does all the cooking on the couple's San Juan Capistrano ranch, 
which they share with three horses, two dogs and a cat. 
</P>
<P>
"Danielle never learned to cook," he says, "and we decided when we got married 
about 1 1/2 years ago that it made sense for me to just do it, that neither of 
us wanted to eat lousy food for a couple of years until she learned." 
</P>
<P>
Being the son of a nutrition-conscious doctor has left him a "bit of a fanatic" 
on what he prepares, he says. "Lots of salads, vegetables, fresh fruits, fish, 
chicken, stuff like that." And he likes to bake his own bread. 
</P>
<P>
A favorite chicken dish is the one he shared with Guys &amp; Galleys. "It's a 
bit unorthodox with the boiling and then baking, but it's great -- and there's 
lots of it," he says. 
</P>

DISCOVERY: AN EMPORIUM TO SPOIL YOUR MAD HATTER'S SWEET TOOTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK MOTT, Patrick Mott is a regular contributor to Orange County Life.

<TEXT>
<P>
Anyone with even a minor-league sweet tooth who passes within a mile or so of 
the Rocking Chair Candy Emporium in Orange had better be ready to be drawn 
toward the place by some sort of mysterious, sugary gravitational pull. 
</P>
<P>
Open the door, and you're as good as trapped for at least a half-hour -- or 
however long it takes you to stock up on a sackful of penny candy, pound down a 
sundae and inhale several dozen lungs full of air redolent with the smell of 
sweet edibles. 
</P>
<P>
The emporium looks like an Advent calendar with Milk Duds. It's a kind of Mad 
Hatter's palace where antique Christmas cards exist side by side with Betty 
Boop T-shirts and pineapple-shaped rubber coolers for soft-drink cans. It's an 
almost overwhelming collection of seemingly unrelated items that somehow belong 
together in precisely the surroundings they're in. 
</P>
<P>
Want a Dionne quintuplets cutout paper-doll book to go with your chocolate 
soda? Or a dashboard sun shield with the face of W.C. Fields printed on it to 
go with your turkey on rye? Deena Zachritz or one of her staff can serve it all 
up. 
</P>
<P>
Zachritz, the proprietor, opened the emporium in Orange's antique district 
about 4 years ago, relying for a good part of her trade on the soda fountain 
and the steady sales of restored antique rocking chairs. 
</P>
<P>
"Originally," she said, "we sold about 20 of those rockers a month, no problem, 
mostly to pregnant ladies. Oh, my, they'd line up for them." 
</P>
<P>
But, she said, the rockers are becoming harder to obtain, and restoring them 
properly takes longer. Consequently, the Rocking Chair Candy Emporium is today 
less a rocking-chair shop and much more an emporium (the dictionary definition 
of which is "a large store with a wide variety of things for sale"). 
</P>
<P>
With the installation of the soda fountain -- made of gray-and-white marble, 
with large, pink-paisley stools and a wide wall mirror behind the counter -- 
Zachritz painted the walls in the colors of chocolate, strawberry and vanilla 
ice cream. White-lattice trim and a picket-fence design were installed around 
the edge of the loft room where the rocking chairs are displayed. And, just 
last month, a deli counter was opened in the back of the store. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike some other specialty stores in the Orange Plaza area, "we wanted 
something to be selling here all the time," she said. "It's ice cream in the 
summer, Christmas cards and gifts at that time of year and candy all the time. 
Particularly at the fountain, it's standing room only on summer weekends." 
</P>
<P>
The emporium is particularly known for its animated or pop-up greeting cards, 
its collection of Betty Boop trinkets and its display of antique hat pins for 
sale, Zachritz said. 
</P>
<P>
The deli offers fare with basic names, but at the fountain customers can order 
a Young Republican sundae ("rich, but conservative") or an Old Newspaper Joke 
sundae ("what's black and white and read all over?" -- chocolate ice cream, 
strawberry topping and whipped cream). 
</P>
<P>
The Rocking Chair Candy Emporium is no place to start a diet. But it's also no 
place for the one-dimensional mind. Where else can you pick up a turkey 
croissant sandwich and a plastic gorilla face that growls at the press of a 
button?

L.A.'S BRAND-NAME FAME COMES SOUTH

<P>
As flashy a bunch of Angelenos we're likely to see all year choppered south 
last week for cocktails in a tent staked near MacArthur Boulevard at the San 
Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The occasion was a kickoff party for the as-yet-unbuilt Sports Club/Irvine, 
tossed by club developers Nanette Pattee Francini, Michael Talla and 
mega-millionaire Marvin Davis (who's so rich he has a guy with him who says 
things like, "If you write about Mr. Davis, just call him a 'businessman'! 
Don't write 'tycoon' or 'billionaire' or any of that nonsense!"). 
</P>
<P>
But rich we've got in Orange County -- no big deal. What we don't have in 
excess is brand-name fame -- and that's what separated last Thursday's bash 
from all the other fancy parties for the status-aware. 
</P>
<P>
Mingling with more than 900 invitation-only guests were mountainous Lakers 
heroes Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Earvin (Magic) Johnson; impossibly handsome 
Oscar-winner Sidney Poitier; his bulky Hulkness Lou Ferrigno; Olympic 
gold-medal decathlete Rafer Johnson, and aspiring actress Cornelia Guest. 
</P>
<P>
Along with a pack of television actors, the big names who made the round trip 
south are among Francini and Talla's celestial clientele at their Sports 
Club/LA -- illustrating the business application for the old saw: Make new 
friends, but keep the old. 
</P>
<P>
After an hour-plus of buffet-trolling and trips to the hosted bar, guests 
turned their attention to a raised stage, where the three club owners said 
their bit and the stars sunk their sports-shoe-shod feet into blocks of cement 
for a future walk of fame outside the club. 
</P>
<P>
In the words of boy wonder Stuart Karl, watching shyly from the sidelines: "I 
can't believe these people came to Orange County!"

<P>
The programs are beamed around the clock from a nondescript studio complex in 
an Orange County industrial park. Distributed in the United States through a 
network larger than that controlled by any other Christian evangelist, the 
signals go overseas, too, carrying a stern anti-communist message to Central 
America and encouragement for the government of South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
To finance this massive, virtually debt-free network, the evangelist raises 
millions -- perhaps as much as $44 million during 1988 -- with telethons that 
bring in almost as much as is raised by Billy Graham. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
All But Unknown 
</P>
<P>
But this is not Billy Graham, nor is it Pat Robertson or Jimmy Swaggart or any 
of the other big-name evangelists whose broadcasts have become familiar to the 
American public. This is the work of Paul F. Crouch, the son of an Assemblies 
of God missionary who has risen from an impoverished Midwestern childhood to 
put together a Christian broadcasting empire worth, by his account, an 
estimated $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
And although Crouch and his wife, Jan, are all but unknown to most of the 
American public and are accountable to no denomination or independent governing 
board, their Tustin-based Trinity Broadcasting Network owns more than 100 
television stations, the largest number controlled by a single owner in the 
United States. The network also owns more than 20 stations overseas. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike other major religious broadcasters, TBN maintains no college, cathedral 
or amusement park. What the network owns, and continues to acquire and build at 
an accelerating rate, are television stations and studios, adding at least 40 
new ones in 1988 alone. While TBN is carried on fewer cable systems than 
Robertson's CBN and the PTL network founded by Jim Bakker, it owns most of its 
stations and pays cash for whatever it buys. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Great Institutional Dream 
</P>
<P>
Thanks in large part to Crouch's reputation for fiscal integrity and his 
self-effacing, on-screen personality, TBN reported a 10% increase in donations 
from the network's thousands of small contributors in 1988, a year in which 
most television evangelists saw a decline in contributions, attributed largely 
to scandals involving Bakker and Swaggart. 
</P>
<P>
Crouch maintains that television is his church and mission. The network does 
support various social welfare projects: a homeless shelter in Anaheim; soup 
kitchens in downtown Los Angeles and at some of his stations, and thousands of 
toys and Bibles distributed to children in the Third World. But these projects, 
Crouch acknowledges, account for only a fraction of TBN's budget and play no 
significant part of his great institutional dream. 
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of TBN," Crouch said in an interview, "is to turn every available 
dollar into expanding the hardware and the ministry and the media to reach as 
many people and to fulfill the 'Great Commission.' . . . I keep coming back to 
what Jesus said at the end of the Book of Matthew: 'Go into all the world 
preach the Gospel to every living creature.' " 
</P>
<P>
Crouch said during an October broadcast that his ultimate goal is to 
"dispossess the Devil of the airwaves." 
</P>
<P>
"Every channel, every satellite, every radio, every television ought to belong 
to God's people," he told viewers. "We should have possessed it many years ago. 
But we let the Devil have it. And, oh, he took it, yes he did. He was glad to 
have it. Satan has been using the airwaves with impunity for many years to 
curse and damn the souls of men and women, boys and girls . . . and we let it 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
To orchestral music and enthusiastic applause, an attractive, middle-aged 
couple -- silver-haired and dressed like prosperous Southern Californians -- 
sweep down a staircase into what appears to be a spacious living room, the 
walls lined with paintings. 
</P>
<P>
On one side of the room is a blazing fire in a large fireplace; on the other, a 
large white Bosendorfer piano. As the music and the applause fade, the smiling 
couple move easily, arm-in-arm, to a pair of padded armchairs before a marble 
coffee table. 
</P>
<P>
This is "Praise the Lord," hosted by Paul and Jan Crouch, the centerpiece of 
the Trinity Broadcasting Network. Their talk show is broadcast live, coast to 
coast, every weeknight for two or three hours at 7 o'clock Pacific Standard 
Time, and rebroadcast twice more during the next 24-hour period. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Image Change 
</P>
<P>
In 15 years of polishing his delivery and appearance, Crouch, 54, has developed 
a fondness for double-breasted blazers with elaborate, embroidered crests. The 
clean-shaven face and crew-cut pictured in early newsletters have given way to 
a salt-and-pepper mustache and a full head of hair, held perfectly in place by 
what he calls "my hundred-mile-an-hour hair spray." 
</P>
<P>
Jan Crouch, 50, with her trademark bouffant hairdo, is her husband's constant 
on-screen companion and the bubbly counterpoint to his sometimes staid manner. 
Prone to tears and fits of giggling, Jan is referred to by her husband as "my 
little spark plug." He says she was cured by God of severe depression 15 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
TBN's 24-hour programming features an eclectic mix of upbeat Christian music 
and videos, soap operas, aerobics, game shows and, most recently, John Jacobs 
and the Power Team. This crew of bulky weightlifters and athletes blow up hot 
water bottles until they explode, snap baseball bats over their thighs, break 
out of handcuffs, rip phone books and break concrete blocks with their 
foreheads -- all in order to demonstrate the power Jesus gives them. 
</P>
<P>
The message that emanates from TBN is conservative, Christian and evangelical. 
Like other Pentecostals, the Crouches believe in speaking in tongues and faith 
healing, but evangelical figures who may not share those beliefs remain welcome 
on his "Praise" program. Crouch tries to steer clear of doctrinal disputes with 
other religious figures, including those who do not buy time on TBN, and he is 
occasionally sought after as a peacemaker. 
</P>
<P>
Crouch maintains that he is not political, although on the day Pat Robertson 
announced his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination, Crouch 
voiced his support and asked Robertson what TBN viewers could do to help him 
win. Crouch also often uses his program to attack Marxist and leftist regimes, 
and guests on "Praise" and other TBN shows have vociferously supported U.S. aid 
to the Nicaraguan Contras. 
</P>
<P>
Although he says he opposes apartheid, Crouch and his guests regularly defend 
the regime of South Africa's P. W. Botha, calling on viewers to pray for the 
nation's president and to oppose U.S. economic sanctions against Pretoria. 
</P>
<P>
Today the network is the largest holder of Federal Communication 
Commission-issued television licenses in the country, with 14 full-power, 
commercial UHF stations, including two owned by a subsidiary, National Minority 
Television Inc., three full-power educational non-commercial outlets and 
another 125 low-power outlets -- inexpensive stations that cover a small 
geographic area -- on the air, under construction or in prospect within the 
year, according to the ministry. Scores of other independent stations are 
affiliated with TBN. The ministry would not say exactly how many, but in a 
recent newsletter Crouch claimed that "we could have 170 stations on the air by 
the end of 1988!" 
</P>
<P>
(The major commercial networks, such as NBC, own fewer stations than TBN, but 
because their stations are located in the largest cities and there are scores 
of affiliates, they reach many more potential viewers than any religious 
network.) 
</P>
<P>
The network is carried on about 580 cable systems, whose operators are offered 
an annual incentive of 25 cents per subscriber. A program exchange with Pat 
Robertson's Christian Broadcasting Network puts Crouch's "Praise" show onto 
7,000 more cable systems. In addition, independent ministers such as Swaggart 
and Schuller, along with Oral Roberts' son, Richard, buy regular blocks of time 
on TBN. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Number of Viewers Unclear 
</P>
<P>
Despite its wide reach, it's not clear how many people watch TBN on a regular 
basis. Crouch's only claim is that the network is available to 70% of the homes 
in the United States, a total potential audience TBN estimates at 100 million. 
But because TBN does not subscribe to Arbitron or A. C. Neilson, the two major 
audience monitoring services, there is no accurate way to gauge the number of 
viewers. 
</P>
<P>
In Central America and the Caribbean, Crouch has been building more outposts 
for his broadcasting empire, which already includes a relay tower in Key West, 
Fla., that enables TBN to beam programming from its Miami affiliate directly 
into Cuba. One of his goals in acquiring stations in Central America, Crouch 
told viewers, is to "surround the Sandinistas with pincers, pincers of love." 
</P>
<P>
With the encouragement of the South African government, Crouch has already 
built Southern Africa's first Christian television station, in the nominally 
independent black homeland of Ciskei, and has signed an agreement with a second 
homeland, Bophutatswana, to build a station there that will beam into the 
Johannesburg-Pretoria area. He also has met with Botha to pursue plans to 
establish South Africa's first nationwide Christian broadcasting network. 
</P>
<P>
Crouch's relationship with the South African government is a source of 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Ciskei nor Bophutatswana are recognized by the U.S. government, which 
considers them part of Pretoria's scheme to strip the country's black majority 
of South African citizenship and assign it to barren, poverty-stricken outlying 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
Crouch was sharply criticized by Randall Robinson, the head of TransAfrica, a 
Washington lobbying organization that focuses on isolating the South African 
government. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you can more grievously and more measurably support apartheid 
than he has," Robinson said. "To lend massive television technology to the 
legitimizing of this forceful warehousing on these remote parcels of land 
amounts to the most important, significant support for the apartheid system 
that one can give, particularly in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Paul F. Crouch was born in 1934 on an Iowa farm. His father died in 1941, his 
health broken during service as a missionary in Egypt, where the family, 
including young Paul, lived. In Springfield, Mo., the headquarters of the 
denomination, Crouch's mother worked as a seamstress to support the family. 
</P>
<P>
"We had no real means of support," he recalled. "The church was not really able 
to care for us. For a while we got I think $20 a month from a kind of 
minister's retirement fund or something, for my mother, and there was a little 
period of time where the state of Missouri actually stepped in and paid a small 
stipend of child support and child care for my sister and me. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference between, you know, turning lights off and on in the house was 
the difference between whether we had adequate food to eat sometimes," he said, 
"so I've always been very, very careful with finances. It was just absolutely 
ingrained in me from earliest childhood to be scrupulously honest with 
everything that we were entrusted with." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Introduced to Ham Radio 
</P>
<P>
As a 15-year-old, Crouch's life was changed when a Linotype operator named 
Lawrence Bake-well, the husband of the woman who was giving him free piano 
lessons, introduced him to the wonders of ham radio. 
</P>
<P>
Within a few years, Crouch, by then an Assemblies of God seminary student in 
Springfield, went on to form a ham radio club. He built a small campus radio 
station because "before long it really dawned on me that this electronic tool 
called radio and later television would really be the way to get the Gospel 
that we preach out in a mass way." 
</P>
<P>
After graduating from the seminary and marrying Jan -- the daughter of a 
prominent Assemblies of God minister -- in 1953, Crouch accepted a job as 
associate pastor of a tiny church in Rapid City, S.D. The post paid so little 
that he moonlighted at a local radio station. 
</P>
<P>
"I earned my living being a disc jockey and then working in the church after 
hours and on weekends," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The radio work led to the opportunity to build and help run one of the first 
television stations in the area, an NBC affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
After a few church jobs in the Midwest, Crouch was invited to Burbank to work 
with the Assemblies of God's new motion picture and television division. In 
1973, with $20,000 of his own savings and pledges of support from a few 
supporters, Crouch bought what became KTBN Channel 40, a struggling UHF station 
in Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
It was at this point, Crouch said, that he had the vision that motivated him 
and shaped what became the Trinity Broadcasting Network. It was the nearest 
thing in his life he can recall to a dramatic, born-again experience. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd heard the old-timers talk about dreams and visions and seeing things 'in 
the spirit' so-called, but I'd never really had an experience like that," he 
said. "But I did this afternoon. I was conscious (and) awake. . . . It was as 
though the ceiling of my den completely turned into a giant TV screen and I saw 
. . . the outline of the entire North American continent as though I were out 
in outer space, and as I watched, really transfixed by it all, I saw a great 
light emerge right over the center of the North American continent and from 
that light began to issue bright streams of light and I saw it strike major 
geographic parts of the United States -- New York, Miami, the tip of Texas, 
California, the Seattle area. 
</P>
<P>
"As that stream of light would strike the New York area, for example, a 
secondary light was illuminated and from that secondary light, little thin 
pencil threads of light began to emanate out in little dots of light, until the 
whole map of the North American continent was just covered with this network of 
light. And I said, 'Lord, what does this mean? What am I seeing?' Again in my 
spirit, I don't know if it was an audible voice or not, but I heard one word: 
'Satellite.' " 
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, Crouch said, "I knew I had heard the voice of God, and I 
absolutely obeyed it and had no second thoughts or qualms." 
</P>
<P>
From then on, Crouch replicated the KTBN pattern, buying UHF stations in small 
and medium-size markets -- many of which suddenly became affordable when cable 
appeared to be the wave of television's future -- for as much cash up front as 
he could raise. By the early and mid-1980s, TBN's acquisition began to 
accelerate, until the network reached the ownership limits set by the FCC -- 12 
commercial stations. Crouch then turned his attention to establishing 
subsidiary and affiliated companies that added stations. He also started 
acquiring licenses for low-power stations that are exempted from FCC ownership 
limits. 
</P>
<P>
Although he proudly points to his own organization as a bastion of frugality 
and strict financial accountability, TBN is ineligible for membership in either 
the voluntary Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability or the National 
Religious Broadcasters. The NRB's new membership rules require organizations 
with annual incomes of more than $10,000 to have a majority of board members 
from outside the family. 
</P>
<P>
All of TBN's corporate structures are dominated by Crouch, his wife, his 
brother and TBN employees. Crouch, who voluntarily gave up his Assemblies of 
God preaching credential in 1973 when he began TBN, is not subject to that 
denomination's discipline. 
</P>
<P>
"Accountability is the watch-word for the church, for TV ministries, as well as 
industry and government," Crouch told an Oct. 7, 1987, hearing of the 
subcommittee on oversight of the House Ways and Means Committee, noting that 
TBN reports to its supporters and the IRS that the ministry spends less than 8% 
of its total revenues for fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
TBN's budget for 1987 was about $40 million, Crouch told the committee, with 
just under half the total earmarked for building new stations. The monthly 
satellite bill is $140,000. 
</P>
<P>
According to material provided to The Times and the IRS by TBN, Crouch is 
listed as president and voting director of all 10 boards that make up the 
network's enterprises, and each board is controlled by Crouch family members 
and employees. 
</P>
<P>
Relatives on TBN and related payrolls and their salaries, according to the 
ministry, include: 
</P>
<P>
* Crouch's wife, Jan, ($42,200), who is co-host of "Praise" and is the TBN 
program director, set designer and editor of the 500,000-circulation monthly 
newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
* Their son, Matthew, ($33,800), who serves as producer-director of "Praise" 
and other TBN shows. 
</P>
<P>
* Matthew's wife, Laurie, ($10,400), co-host with Matthew of a TBN show. 
</P>
<P>
* Crouch's brother, Philip A. Crouch, ($36,400), TBN's chief of staff, and 
Philip Crouch's wife, who works in the TBN's public affairs office in Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
* Also, Crouch's sister and brother-in-law manage TBN's Oklahoma City 
affiliate, and Jan Crouch's sister and brother-in-law manage the Miami station. 
</P>
<P>
Crouch himself is paid modestly by religious broadcast standards. He took a 
combined salary and housing allowance of $70,542 in 1987, with no deferred 
income or retirement plan, according to documents filed with the IRS. He writes 
no books, makes no records and accepts no commercial speaking engagements. He 
says he receives no clothing allowance and he lives in the same Corona del Mar 
home he bought in 1971 for $44,000, although it might sell for seven or eight 
times that today. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to a number of trucks, service vehicles, vans and high-tech 
transmitters, TBN's fleet includes two private jets, a 1987 BMW sedan, a 1984 
Cadillac and a 1984 Lincoln, as well as a 1972 Jaguar sedan -- which are made 
ailable to the Crouches for their personal use and for guests on the show. The 
ministry also purchased the home next door to the Crouches for use as an office 
and guest house for more than $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
Only two of the more than 400 non-family employees on TBN's 1987 $4.8-million 
payroll had salaries above $40,000, according to information provided by TBN to 
the IRS. As with Crouch family members, none of the employees receives any 
pension or retirement benefits, and no loans are made to any director, officer 
or employee. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to see that employees' needs are met," Crouch said, "but it is just my 
personal philosophy, born of a zeal and a desire to get the Gospel out as far 
as I can with the least amount of expense possible, to keep salaries lean and 
mean and to keep overhead and expenses down, even in the area of buying 
equipment." 
</P>
<P>
This kind of careful economic management, combined with steadily rising gifts 
from viewers and Crouch's own canny sense of broadcasting, has yielded dramatic 
results. 
</P>
<P>
Although the worth of TBN was listed for Congress at $75 million, its market 
value is thought to be much higher. At one time, Crouch said, TBN was offered 
$150 million for the Tustin, Phoenix and Miami outlets alone by one of the 
home-shopping television networks. In all, Crouch estimates the market value of 
TBN at $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
And who has paid for this? TBN says more than 80% of its budget comes from its 
twice-yearly "Praise-a-Thon" appeals, each of which lasts a week. In 1987, 
about $38 million was raised, $2 million more than was raised in 1986, 
according to TBN figures. The network reports that it will get about $44 
million from the two 1988 telethons, making them among the most lucrative 
fund-raising appeals on U.S. television. 
</P>
<P>
Crouch's long and steady success, says the Rev. Robert Schuller of Garden 
Grove's Crystal Cathedral, can be attributed to the fact that "Paul has avoided 
the temptation to be negative and divisive." 
</P>
<P>
And, unlike other televangelists who have built broadcasting empires, Crouch is 
not on camera at every opportunity. He and Jan host their own show only two 
nights a week (guest hosts appear the other three nights) and Crouch prefers to 
exercise his control in the board rooms and behind the scenes. 
</P>
<P>
But some critics charge that Crouch's control of TBN is iron-fisted and 
tailored to his own beliefs. These critics say that some broadcasters who 
differ with Crouch on the finer points of faith are priced off the network or 
not sold time at all. 
</P>
<P>
"The final court of appeal is Paul's theology," said Walter Martin, author of 
"Kingdom of the Cults" and director of the Christian Research Institute in 
Irvine, a Christian think tank. "One man has the right to keep any program off 
the air if he chooses, and he exercises it regularly," in the process creating 
"a mom-and-pop operation masquerading as a nonprofit corporation." 
</P>
<P>
Others also complain about the lack of accountability. 
</P>
<P>
"They have taken millions of dollars from millions of people out there, and 
have used that to further their own interests . . . to acquire properties over 
which they alone preside, with no accountability," said Dave Hunt, author of 
"The Seduction of Christianity" and who said he has been banished from TBN for 
years. "If you take other people's money you should fairly represent them. They 
are using their stations to present a fanatical, fringe element of 
Christianity." 
</P>
<P>
Crouch responded to Martin's and Hunt's charges in a conciliatory letter to 
them, by saying that "everyone has a 'little heresy' in the opinion of another 
teacher, so why not preach salvation . . . and let the Holy Spirit work it 
out?" 
</P>
<P>

SOVIETS SEEK DEFICIT CURE

A top Soviet economist asserted that the Soviet Union can eliminate its 
$162-billion budget deficit in two or three years by trimming expenditures and 
concentrating on quick-profit ventures. Leonid Abalkin, director of the 
Economics Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, said that erasing the 
red ink is essential to remedy shortages of consumer goods plaguing the nation. 
He said the Soviet state should support businesses that make a quick profit and 
stop financing businesses that won't turn a profit for years. He said $32 
billion could be saved by closing bad businesses and calling off expensive 
construction projects and other huge outlays. A recent government report said 
that one in 10 Soviet enterprises lost money in 1988.

Fontana stonemason Vincent Ronald Monacco said he plans to buy some Italian 
suits, travel to the French Riviera and buy a new BMW -- but he isn't sure 
whether he will continue laying bricks. Monacco, 39, won $5.8 million Saturday, 
sharing the $40.7-million Lotto jackpot pool with six others. Each will collect 
$232,000 a year, after taxes, for 20 years. Monacco said he will continue to 
live in Fontana, where he was born. "Fontana is my home," he said.

Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita said he will not be driven from office 
by a stock-trading scandal that has forced three Cabinet ministers to resign. 
He said he will try to restore public trust in government. Opposition leaders 
have demanded Takeshita's removal in the wake of the resignation of Ken Harada, 
director of the Economic Planning Agency, because of links to Recruit Co., the 
firm at the center of the stock-trading and alleged influence-peddling scandal.

7TH BODY FROM YARD IDENTIFIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Authorities have identified the body of a woman unearthed with six others last 
November from the yard of the Sacramento boardinghouse run by Dorothea Montalvo 
Puente. The Sacramento County coroner's office identified the last of seven 
corpses as that of Betty Mae Palmer, 80, who apparently went to Sacramento from 
the Redding area in 1986. Officers said that they did not know when when was 
last seen alive but that she moved into the Victorian house sometime in 1986. 
Coroner's spokesman Bob Bowers said the body was identified through comparisons 
of medical X-rays. Puente has been charged with murdering another tenant, 
Alvaro (Bert) Montoya.

A woman who was attacked after telling police she could identify the men 
allegedly hired by the Rev. Jesse Jackson's half-brother, Noah Robinson, to 
kill an associate recanted on the witness stand. Denise Rosemond, who testified 
as a defense witness, said she cannot identify the men who gunned down Leroy 
(Hambone) Barber in 1986 in Greenville, S.C. Robinson is charged with hiring a 
Chicago street gang to kill Barber, a longtime acquaintance. Rosemond, who 
witnessed the killing, originally identified the men for police in Greenville, 
and testified about the shooting before a grand jury in Chicago. Rosemond has 
testified that she was later attacked by gang member Freddie Sweeney, who said 
that he was hired by Robinson to kill Rosemond to keep her quiet.

Students conducted a silent protest at ground-breaking ceremonies at Kent State 
University for a scaled-down memorial to students shot by Ohio National 
Guardsmen during 1970 anti-war demonstrations. The students held a banner 
depicting a peace symbol and a dove to protest as inadequate the $100,000 
memorial university trustees unanimously agreed to build. The trustees voted 
Nov. 15 to reduce the cost of the memorial from $1.2 million after a 
fund-raising campaign netted only $40,000. The ground-breaking took place on a 
campus hill near where Guardsmen fired more than 60 shots that hit 13 students 
and killed four.

French doctors reported what may be the first documented case in medical 
literature of infection with the AIDS virus through an acupuncture needle. 
Doctors at the Necker Hospital in Paris described the case of a 17-year-old boy 
who apparently became infected with HIV -- the virus that causes the deadly 
disease -- when he underwent acupuncture for tendinitis. "We believe that the 
incidence of HIV transmission by acupuncture is very low," the doctors wrote in 
reporting the case in a letter to the New England Journal of Medicine. A 
spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta said that there have 
been no documented cases of infection with the AIDS virus in the United States 
from an acupuncture needle.

A district judge in Dunn, N.C., threw the book at a drunken driver with a 
21-page arrest record, sentencing him to seven years in prison and raising his 
bond to $100,000 after his 33rd drunken-driving conviction. Otis Wadford, 52, 
who pleaded guilty to the charge, was also fined $4,000 by Judge Sam 
Stephenson, who said he was appalled by the Raleigh man's record. In addition 
to his 33 drunken-driving convictions, Wadford's 21-page record showed he had 
been convicted 22 times of driving after his license had been revoked.

GIRL TOLD ON TAPE TO WITHHOLD 'WHOLE TRUTH' IN MURDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a conversation secretly recorded by authorities just weeks before he was 
arrested on murder charges last fall, Anaheim computer entrepreneur David A. 
Brown told his imprisoned daughter that she must not tell investigators "the 
whole truth" about the killing of his wife because "we'd all go to jail." 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of just one person being punished for (the murder)," the 36-year-old 
Brown implored, "we'd all be punished for it." 
</P>
<P>
Brown's daughter, 18-year-old Cinnamon Brown, has been imprisoned for more than 
3 years for the murder of her stepmother. She now admits to the killing in the 
family's Garden Grove home but says the plan was masterminded by her 
strong-willed father with the knowledge and participation of several other 
family members. 
</P>
<P>
With her cooperation, authorities secretly recorded two conversations last 
summer between Cinnamon and her father at the California Youth Authority in 
Camarillo in a bid to reveal Brown's role in the alleged plot. 
</P>
<P>
Copies of the tapes were obtained by The Times Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors plan to use the more than 3 hours of taped conversations at Brown's 
murder trial. They called the tapes one of the most incriminating weapons they 
have in their effort to prove that he masterminded the 1985 shooting death of 
his wife months in advance and let his own teen-age daughter take the blame for 
the crime. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, the prosecutors maintain, wanted his wife out of the way for both money 
and love: He collected $835,000 from several of her insurance policies, and he 
later married the victim's sister, Patricia Bailey, 20. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey has also been charged with murder but has agreed to testify against her 
husband. 
</P>
<P>
The secretly taped conversations between Brown and his daughter are 
incriminating but do not offer prosecutors "a smoking gun," Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Jeoffrey Robinson conceded. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Joel Baruch maintained in an interview that the tapes 
"exonerate my client." 
</P>
<P>
In the visits, Brown repeatedly denied under tough questioning from his 
daughter that he had specifically directed anyone to kill 24-year-old Linda 
Brown, who was his wife and Cinnamon's stepmother. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate interview with police after his arrest, Brown maintained that he 
was only joking when, before the killing, he discussed with Cinnamon some 
details of the murder plot -- such as a note that Cinnamon wrote to feign 
suicide on the night of the murder. Brown never thought Cinnamon was serious 
about the plot, he insisted to police. 
</P>
<P>
In an Aug. 13, 1988, tape-recorded conversation at the youth facility, Brown 
disputed his daughter's recollection of his role in the killing. He told her: 
"I didn't want it to happen. You should remember that. I told you guys 
(Cinnamon and her Bailey), 'I don't want any part of this.' " 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Brown did acknowledge substantial knowledge of -- and 
responsibility for -- the events leading up to the killing during several key 
exchanges in the visits. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Cinnamon told her father: "I feel stupid because I was so young 
and I loved you so much that I was gullible enough to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Brown responded that she was not gullible at all. "Grandpa was going to do it 
if you didn't," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors have found no evidence to implicate either of Brown's parents in 
the alleged plot, with the exception of one conversation that his father may 
have heard in which Linda Brown's murder was allegedly discussed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Always Lying to Me' 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere on the tape, Cinnamon accused her father of "always lying to me" and 
said she was frustrated with being kept in custody, with no end in sight. 
</P>
<P>
Brown told her that he would have Bailey -- who, unknown to Cinnamon at the 
time, was by then Brown's wife -- confess to the killing. 
</P>
<P>
"She'll take your place," he told his daughter on the tape. 
</P>
<P>
But he cautioned Cinnamon that she would have to keep telling police that she 
could not remember what happened the night of Linda Brown's death. If she told 
the truth, Brown himself, both his parents and Bailey would all be implicated 
by their knowledge of the plot, he warned on the tape. 
</P>
<P>
He asked Cinnamon: "Do you see any reason for five people's lives to be ruined? 
. . . I can't survive in jail. . . . I would kill myself before I'd let myself 
die a slow and painful death in a cell." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Filled With Memory Lapses 
</P>
<P>
The taped conversations -- filled with lapses of memory by Cinnamon, her father 
and Bailey, who took part in the second tape-recorded visit on Aug. 27, 1988 -- 
still leave significant doubt over what exactly happened in the family's home 
on March 19, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
At some points in the visits, Cinnamon seemed to acknowledge that she had shot 
her stepmother. But at other times, she denied this to her father, as she had 
with police at that time. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of her first visit with her father in August, Cinnamon appeared to 
have convinced her father that it was Bailey -- not Cinnamon -- who shot Linda 
Brown. 
</P>
<P>
At the second meeting just 2 weeks later, however, Bailey also denied having 
killed Linda Brown and the three -- she, Cinnamon and Brown -- all seemed to 
agree that it must have been an outsider who did the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
View of Prosecutors 
</P>
<P>
But prosecutors now assert that it was Cinnamon, despite her claims of 
innocence just months ago, who shot Linda Brown to death -- though only at the 
prodding of her father. 
</P>
<P>
Cinnamon says her father persuaded her to kill her mother because Linda Brown 
had Mafia connections and planned to kill Brown to gain control of his 
lucrative computer data retrieval business. 
</P>
<P>
Cinnamon maintains that Brown told her that she would serve little time in 
prison because of her age. 
</P>
<P>
But Cinnamon said she felt confused and betrayed by her father after spending 3 
years behind bars, so she finally agreed to cooperate with the authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators, suspicious about the incident even at the time of Cinnamon's 
murder conviction, had tried since 1985 to get her to tell all she knows about 
the killing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wired for Recording 
</P>
<P>
And so, wired with a recording device set up by investigators, Cinnamon had her 
father come for an Aug. 13 visit at the youth facility. After exchanging small 
talk, Cinnamon quickly brought up the subject of Linda Brown's killing. 
</P>
<P>
Cinnamon told her father that she was "confused, very confused" about her 
continued imprisonment in the youth facility on a 27-year-to-life sentence. 
"Why did you tell me I'd only be here for a little bit, and then they'd let me 
go home?" she asked on the tape. 
</P>
<P>
Later, without ever saying what did happen the night of the murder, Cinnamon 
asked her father why she could not finally tell police the truth about the 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
Her father's taped answer was firm and immediate: "I'll tell you why. . . . You 
can tell the truth, if you don't tell the whole truth, because if there was 
knowledge -- if me, grandma, grandpa, Patty, everyone -- had knowledge in 
advance of what was going to happen, then we'd all go to jail, everyone." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Defense View of Tape 
</P>
<P>
Baruch, defense attorney for Brown, maintained that Brown's response indicates 
only that he knew about the plot, not that he encouraged it. Explaining Brown's 
reference to imprisonment, Baruch said: "He doesn't know the law. Knowledge 
isn't enough for murder." 
</P>
<P>
Police investigators saw it differently: Five weeks after that conversation was 
surreptitiously recorded, police arrested Brown and Bailey on charges of murder 
and conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, ordered last week to stand trial on murder charges, is to be arraigned 
Feb. 2 in Orange County Superior Court. Bailey's case is pending, but she is 
expected to be helped in court by her cooperation in the prosecution of her 
husband.

Photo, Big Rig Was Just Too Tall Truck driver Tom Inglis is brought up short on 
the San Diego Freeway at a ramp under construction to link John Wayne Airport 
with MacArthur Boulevard. The ramp was just a little too low for Inglis' cargo, 
which was being driven south on the freeway Wednesday morning. The bulldozer he 
was hauling stood 15 feet, 11 inches above the pavement, but the clearance was 
only 15 feet, 7 1/2 inches. The bulldozer had to be unloaded on one side of the 
ramp, then reloaded on the other side after the truck was driven through. The 
incident caused a SigAlert and stopped southbound traffic for nearly 2 hours.

Two little girls sat on a hard wooden bench Wednesday, oblivious to the mood of 
grief within the First Presbyterian Church in Santa Ana, while a minister spoke 
of two untimely deaths. 
</P>
<P>
"The way that they died, so unexpectedly, so unexplainedly, so unnecessarily 
and so tragically has touched us all, whether we knew (them) or not," said the 
Rev. Mike Pulsifer, pastor of the church. "Why this happened, I do not know."

The girls' mother, Helen Lynch, 35, and their 13-month-old sister, Natalie, 
were buried in a private ceremony Wednesday morning, and about 60 friends and 
neighbors gathered at the church just after noon for a memorial service. 
</P>
<P>
Across town, less than a mile away, the girls' father, Joseph Peter Lynch, 43, 
sat in a jail cell on suspicion of fatally bludgeoning the mother and infant 
with a champagne bottle. 
</P>
<P>
In his sermon, Pulsifer spoke to the anguished quest for answers in the 
aftermath of a horrible event. He talked of the virtues of mother and daughter, 
two innocents in a family tragedy. Only near the end did he acknowledge Joseph 
Lynch: 
</P>
<P>
"Grant him peace, oh God, and keep us from passing judgment." 
</P>
<P>
For now, there are questions, raised by Lynch's attorney and psychiatrist, 
about Lynch's history of mental problems and what role they will play in his 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
And there are questions about what will become of the fragments of the family 
left behind. 
</P>
<P>
Like many of Orange County's residents, the Lynches were transplants. He is 
Scottish, and Helen was Australian. They had lived in Santa Ana 4 years. But in 
that short time, say neighbors and friends, they became well-entrenched in the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
Work had brought them here. An engineer for an international company, Joseph 
Lynch had transplanted his family to Canada, Mexico and Italy before 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Helen Lynch devoted herself to her children. Their daughters Holly, 9, and 
Angela, 4, were in Girl Scouts and Brownies. One daughter played on a soccer 
team. 
</P>
<P>
"They were a very loving family," said Stan Taylor, president of the homeowners 
association in the apartment complex where they lived. "A lot of times, we've 
said that we wish other kids in the complex were as well-behaved as the Lynch 
kids were." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor remembers Lynch as the model of stability. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had to pick 100 people who I thought would do something terrible, he 
would not even make the list," Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Very Brutal Attack' 
</P>
<P>
But in the early hours of Jan. 17, Joseph Lynch called Santa Ana police to 
report a homicide. 
</P>
<P>
Police found Helen Lynch battered and lifeless on the floor of the family's 
condominium. Her daughter lay in her arms, suffering from blows to her head. 
</P>
<P>
A police spokeswoman called it a "very brutal attack." 
</P>
<P>
Initially, Lynch said someone else had been responsible, police reported. Then, 
he changed his story and said he had been responsible. 
</P>
<P>
Police found the other two girls in their room, under a cover, apparently 
unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
Friends, family and Lynch's psychiatrist say Joseph Lynch suffered from manic 
depression. Two years ago, said his psychiatrist, Dr. Richard S. Rose, he was 
hospitalized for the condition. 
</P>
<P>
"He had some problems and his wife recognized the problems and suggested to him 
that he seek help, and he did," Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
He had been on the medication lithium since that time, Rose said, and "he had 
done beautifully on the medication." 
</P>
<P>
But Rose said that Lynch apparently had stopped taking his medicine, and his 
wife noticed changes in his behavior. On the day before she died, Helen Lynch 
had called Rose's office to make an appointment for him. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no urgency about the call," Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Lawrence Greene, a psychiatrist who oversees quality assurance for the 
county's mental health system, said about 0.5% to 1.2% of the U.S. population 
suffers from manic depression. 
</P>
<P>
Those who suffer from the illness, he said, experience manic episodes 
characterized by a decreased need for sleep, increased talkativeness, racing 
thoughts and increased irrational activity that may include overspending. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, he said, the manic episodes are short, and other times they can last 
for months. The episodes might also trigger delusions, and in that case, "it is 
possible for the person to become violent." 
</P>
<P>
The episodes can be controlled with medication, namely lithium. Uncontrolled, 
the disease will cause more frequent, and sometimes more intense, episodes, 
Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Ducker, a public defender who is serving as Lynch's attorney, is ordering 
a psychological evaluation for his client and said an insanity plea is a 
possibility. He said Lynch is being monitored closely in a medical unit at a 
county jail ward. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch is scheduled to be arraigned on two charges of murder Friday, but Ducker 
said he will ask for a continuance until Lynch undergoes the testing. 
</P>
<P>
"Given his present mental state, I don't think even his friends ought to talk 
to him about this case," Ducker said. 
</P>
<P>
Those close to Lynch were aware of his condition, but said his behavior never 
frightened them. 
</P>
<P>
Helen Lynch's mother, Joan Stuart, had visited the family several times, and 
stayed with them several weeks last year, when Natalie was born. Nothing about 
Joseph Lynch's behavior worried her, she said. "Not at all, because he was 
treated for that and he was going along well, as far as I knew," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unusual Behavior 
</P>
<P>
Said Pulsifer, pastor of First Presbyterian: "Helen must not have been that 
afraid, or she would not have let the kids stay there, because I know how much 
she cared for those kids." 
</P>
<P>
Rose said it is highly unusual for a person who suffers from manic depression 
to act in a way that is radically different from his behavior during other 
manic episodes. 
</P>
<P>
"Sudden, unpredictable behavior is Hollywood, Class B stuff," he said. "We 
don't see people who are unpredictable that way. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an element of unpredictability about this illness, but what is usual 
is the predictability of the bizarreness of behavior," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The incident has left the family in a tangle of legal questions regarding the 
surviving children and Joseph Lynch's case. 
</P>
<P>
The family had no relatives in the United States, so their guardianship is a 
matter that will have to be determined by a juvenile court. 
</P>
<P>
The two girls were living in the Orangewood Children's Home until late last 
week, when a juvenile court granted Stuart temporary custody. No permanent 
arrangement has been determined. 
</P>
<P>
The British consul in Los Angeles is monitoring Lynch's case to make sure his 
rights as a non-citizen are respected, but consulate spokesman Angus Mackay 
said Lynch will have to go through the system "just as anyone here does." 
</P>
<P>
This weekend, Stuart met her son-in-law's family for the first time. Lynch's 
brother, John, from West Germany, and his sister, Mary, from Scotland, arrived 
in Santa Ana on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We're Just Managing' 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very awkward meeting for all of us," Stuart said. "We really just 
talked in a very general way about the children. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just living one day at a time," Stuart said. "We're just managing." 
</P>
<P>
In the church's library Wednesday afternoon, Stuart accepted condolences from 
many people she had never met. Sitting next to her was Sharon Portman, a 
neighbor who has been close to the Lynch family. Stuart and the two girls are 
staying with Portman and husband Michael Fults. 
</P>
<P>
Holly and Angela ran about with other children, sharing books, secure in the 
company of friends of a few years. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch's brother and sister sat in a corner of the library, apart from the crowd 
of neighbors and friends. They were asked about their brother. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps it's best to wait on this thing," John Lynch said, as his sister 
dabbed at tears.

MEETING SCHEDULED ON 1990 CENSUS BENEFITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Residents and community leaders are invited to attend a special presentation 
Tuesday on the city's 1990 Census Outreach Project to highlight the importance 
and benefits of participating in the 1990 Census. 
</P>
<P>
According to a statement released by the city, a major effort will be made next 
year to reach Latino, Vietnamese, Cambodian, Laotian and other ethnic 
populations within Santa Ana because their numbers have not been accurately 
represented in previous census counts. These groups, the statement said, have 
been difficult to reach because of language and cultural barriers. 
</P>
<P>
Guest speaker at the event, co-hosted by the city and Voces Unidas, a Latino 
organization, will be John E. Reeder Jr., a representative of the U.S. 
Department of Commerce. The presentation will be at 1 p.m. at the Corbin 
Community Center, 2215 W. McFadden Ave. 
</P>
<P>

outreach supervisor, at (714) 647-6557. Admission and parking are free.

DEVELOPMENT DIRECTOR SELECTED BY COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Irvine city officials announced Wednesday that Robert C. Johnson of Arizona has 
been appointed to the position of director of community development. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson resigned as director of planning and development services for Pima 
County, Ariz., to take the Irvine position, which has been vacant since 
February of 1988. Johnson's annual salary will be $70,000. 
</P>
<P>
"It is one of the top planning programs in the country," Johnson said, calling 
it a fantastic opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Larry Agran said the post, which is the third highest city-management 
position, was filled after two national searches. Agran said Johnson was 
selected from a pool of about 70 applicants. 
</P>
<P>
"It was immediately clear to me that he has excellent credentials that match 
our city and its aspirations," Agran said. "I think that the job was especially 
attractive to him because it would afford him the opportunity to work in a 
university community." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who holds a doctorate in watershed management from the University of 
Arizona at Tucson, will be responsible for overseeing some five divisions 
within the department. His main responsibilities will concern the city's 
General Plan, zoning and open space management, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's department has an operating budget of about $7 million. He will 
assume the office Feb. 27.

COUNCIL REJECTS CLAIM IN WOMAN'S CRASH DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has unanimously denied a claim filed against the city and 
Police Department on behalf of the family of Jessica Warren, one of two women 
killed Christmas Day when their car was struck by a Westminster police car. 
</P>
<P>
"Denial was recommended by our risk manager," interim City Manager Jerry Kenney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The claim alleged that the unidentified police officer driving the car was 
traveling at a "dangerously high rate of speed" in excess of 65 m.p.h. through 
the intersection of Newland Street and Westminster Avenue when the vehicle 
struck Warren's car, killing her and her companion, Dawn Hammond, 20. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted to deny the claim Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
John W. Nelson, an attorney for the family, said he filed the wrongful death 
claim Jan. 13. The claim alleges that the officer was negligent, failed to 
adhere to the rules of the road and failed to adhere to the Police Department's 
stated policy. 
</P>
<P>
The claim was filed by Warren's parents, William and Gavonne Warren, and 
brothers, Mark C. Warren and Brenton S. Warren. The amount of damages was not 
specified. 
</P>
<P>
A lawsuit cannot be filed over such incidents until a claim is lodged with a 
governmental body and subsequently denied.

LAGUNA MAYOR SAYS AIDS LED TO COMPANION'S DEATH 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Gary Burdick, the 15-year companion of Laguna Beach Mayor Robert F. Gentry, 
died early Tuesday in a Newport Beach hospital of complications from AIDS, 
Gentry said. 
</P>
<P>
Burdick, 49, died at Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian. While the coroner 
will investigate the cause of death, Gentry said he is certain that it was 
related to acquired immune deficiency syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm angry that he passed away from a disease that should not have killed him," 
Gentry said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Before his death, Burdick had tested positive for human immunodeficiency virus, 
so Gentry said he believes Burdick had AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Gentry expects to receive results of Burdick's blood test in about a week. "I'm 
convinced it will come up positive" for AIDS, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gentry, the only openly gay elected official in Orange County, said that while 
he advocates AIDS testing, he has not himself been tested. 
</P>
<P>
"I did not have the strength to do it," he said. "But now I will." 
</P>
<P>
Gentry said he wanted to avoid sharing any bad news with Burdick: "I tried to 
spare both of us that burden." 
</P>
<P>
A private funeral service will be held at Forest Lawn Memorial-Park in Cypress. 
A public memorial service will be held at 3 p.m. Sunday in the Laguna Room at 
the Hotel Laguna. Gentry requested that donations be made to the Costa 
Mesa-based AIDS Service Foundation of Orange County, the Laguna Shanti Project 
or the AIDS Response Program, in lieu of flowers. 
</P>
<P>
Described as "a great animal lover," Burdick bred dogs and horses for shows, 
and later rabbits as a hobby, Gentry said. 
</P>
<P>
Co-workers at the Images For Hair salon in Corona del Mar, where Burdick worked 
as a stylist, said he will be missed. 
</P>
<P>
"He was probably the most happy and upbeat person I've ever worked with," Paula 
Marralle said. "He didn't seem like a sick person to me. 
</P>
<P>
"He must have been a very strong person to make everything all right every 
day," she said. "We'll really miss him."

L.A. OUTSPENT SAN FRANCISCO IN AID FOR AIDS

<TEXT>
<P>
The state Medi-Cal program spent about twice as much money per AIDS patient in 
Los Angeles last year as in San Francisco, according to a report issued 
Wednesday by the California Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
Shorter hospital stays, made possible by the Northern California city's 
extensive system of hospices and home health care, accounted for most of the 
difference. Daily hospital charges were also 15% less in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
All told, Medi-Cal expenditures per AIDS patient per month were $2,953 in Los 
Angeles, contrasted with $1,514 in San Francisco, and the average hospital stay 
was 13.3 days in Los Angeles and 9.5 days in San Francisco. Comparative figures 
were not available for Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"The message here is that the economic burden of AIDS can be significantly 
reduced by aggressively pursuing alternatives to inpatient hospital care," said 
Dr. Kenneth W. Kizer, director of the Department of Health Services, in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Won't 'Break the Bank' 
</P>
<P>
Medi-Cal paid the health-care costs for 33% of the state's AIDS patients last 
year, up from 27% in 1986 and 19% in 1983. Medi-Cal's AIDS-related expenditures 
have kept pace, rising to $42.8 million in the current fiscal year. They are 
expected to climb to $56.4 million next year. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the hefty tab, the report indicated that AIDS costs won't overwhelm the 
state, as some have feared. "You can't say that AIDS is going to break the 
bank, or bankrupt the (Medi-Cal) system," said Kizer, noting that the state 
will spend a total of $6.5 billion on the program this year. 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged, however, that the epidemic has severely strained certain 
regions and institutions, particularly public hospitals in Los Angeles and San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Two Orange County hospitals were among the top 40 hospitals in the state to 
treat Medi-Cal AIDS patients. UCI Medical Center in Orange was 12th, with 137 
claims totaling $1 million from August, 1982 through March, 1988. Hoag Memorial 
Hospital Presbyterian in Newport Beach was 16th in that period, with 89 claims 
totaling $721,000. 
</P>
<P>
And while the epidemic will continue to take a disproportionate toll on San 
Francisco, that city will probably account for a declining percentage of the 
state's AIDS cases in the future. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
L.A. Caseload to Rise 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco accounted for 43% of the state's new cases in 1982 but will drop 
to 26% in 1990, according to the report. Meanwhile, Los Angeles' share of the 
caseload will rise from 34% to 38%, and all other areas of the state will go 
from 23% of new cases to 36%. 
</P>
<P>
The report listed 110 Medi-Cal AIDS cases from Orange County from 1981 to 1988, 
accounting for 3.2% of the state's Medi-Cal caseload in that time. Last year, 
four cases or 7% of the state's Medi-Cal caseload came from Orange County. 
Overall, Orange County has recorded 923 AIDS cases from 1981 through 1988, with 
539 deaths in that time.

A motorcycle passenger was killed Wednesday evening and the driver was injured

The accident occurred about 5:50 p.m. in the westbound lanes of the Garden 
Grove Freeway, east of Glassell Street in Orange. A 1988 Mitsubishi pickup 
truck, driven by Michael R. Lockhart, 26, of Huntington Beach, was traveling 
about 50 m.p.h. in the fast lane and carrying two 10-by-9-foot rolls of 
carpeting, Lundquist said. 
</P>
<P>
The carpeting fell off into the path of the 1986 Kawasaki Ninja motorcycle 
driven by Carlos Cirado, 19, of Santa Ana, Lundquist said. 
</P>
<P>
The motorcycle struck the carpeting, went out of control and hit the center 
divider, ejecting both the driver and passenger, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The passenger fell head first in the fast lane and was dead on impact, 
Lundquist said. She then rolled into the path of a 1986 Buick, which had slowed 
almost to a stop. "There was only minor impact to the body," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A coroner's spokesman identified the woman as Angela Caballero, 19, of Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Cirado fell into the fast lane and suffered major injuries, including a broken 
clavicle, a broken wrist and possible internal injuries, Lundquist said. He was 
listed in serious condition at UCI Medical Center in Orange, a hospital 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the Buick, Leota Sears, 54, of Garden Grove, was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
Lundquist said the accident is under investigation, adding that the carpeting 
was obviously not properly tied down in accordance with highway safety laws. 
</P>
<P>
"If it comes off, it definitely was not tied down properly," he said.

AFTER MAKING SEVERAL STOPS ALONG THE WAY, BILL REYNOLDS SETTLES DOWN COACHING 
AT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COLLEGE; 
</P>
<P>
HE'S HOME AT LAST

<P>
The twists and turns of life have led Bill Reynolds to some pretty exciting 
places. 
</P>
<P>
West Point. Paris. Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
OK, so not all of them have been exciting. Some, like Southern California 
College, have just been comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
For the past 7 years, Reynolds has been the head basketball coach at Southern 
California, a small (enrollment of less than 900) college in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
It's not exactly the center of the college basketball world -- it's more like 
an outpost. A fringe element of college sports known as the National Assn. of 
Intercollegiate Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
"Being at SCC is probably much different than being in a normal situation," 
Reynolds said. "It's our own little world here." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Reynolds has made his mark at this out-of-the-way school, located across 
the street from where the largest swap meet in Orange County sets up shop every 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The Vanguards have won a Golden State Athletic Conference championship and have 
averaged more than 20 victories per season during the Reynolds regime. This 
season, Southern California is 16-2 overall and 6-0 in conference play. 
</P>
<P>
Success? Sure. More importantly, stability. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it sounds kind of corny, but we really do feel like we've built a family 
atmosphere at SCC," Reynolds said. "There aren't too many places where I can 
maintain the stability I like and the reasonable home life I want." 
</P>
<P>
A reasonable home life was not something Reynolds enjoyed as a youth. It was a 
happy home, to be sure, but reasonable? Well . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I think we moved five times alone when I was in the fourth grade," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The son of a career Army officer, Reynolds spent his formative years packing 
and unpacking. During one 10-year period, the family moved 15 times. 
</P>
<P>
Stability was a reliable suit case. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't say I enjoyed moving," Reynolds said. "I wasn't real outgoing or real 
confident. I would get settled in, start to develop some friendships and then, 
poof, up and away we went." 
</P>
<P>
Joseph and Kay Reynolds were married Jan. 1, 1939 -- just 2 1/2 hours after 
Joseph graduated from West Point. Their wedding picture was featured in Life 
magazine as the first couple married that year. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Reynolds was born in 1942, and a few weeks later his father was shipped 
out to Europe. Reynolds didn't get to know his father's face until until Joseph 
Reynolds returned after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
In 1948, after 3 years of following Army orders around the country, Joseph 
Reynolds was assigned to teach at West Point. For the 6-year old Bill Reynolds, 
it was paradise. 
</P>
<P>
In the fall, he would watch Army's football team while it was still a national 
power. In the winter there was basketball, wrestling, boxing and ice hockey. 
The spring, baseball and track and field. 
</P>
<P>
"You could ride the bus for free, go anywhere on base," Reynolds said. "At 11 
a.m., I would go to the hockey match, then to the basketball game. After that 
was over, they would have boxing at one end of the gymnasium and wrestling at 
the other end. I fell in love with sports during that time." 
</P>
<P>
Orders are orders and, after 3 years of sports bliss, Reynolds' father was 
transferred to France. Reynolds spent 3 confusing years in Paris, where the 
only sport anyone seemed to play was soccer. 
</P>
<P>
After returning to the United States, the Army bounced Joseph Reynolds around 
from Kansas to Washington and finally to El Paso, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
By that time Reynolds had become a pretty good baseball player. He was offered 
a scholarship to Sul Ross State University, an NAIA school in Alpine, Tex. But 
Joseph Reynolds had one last move. 
</P>
<P>
"My dad was retiring and they wanted to move to California," Reynolds said. 
"They were really encouraging me to come with them and discouraging me from 
going to school in Alpine." 
</P>
<P>
Next stop, Alta Loma, Calif., and Chaffey College. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds played baseball and basketball at Chaffey, although he admits his 
usefulness to the basketball team was somewhat limited. 
</P>
<P>
"I was the 11th man on a 10-man team," he said. "I was the designated 
free-throw shooter. When the other team got a technical foul, I would get to 
come in and shoot it." 
</P>
<P>
No 4-year college was interested in a designated free-throw shooter, but UC 
Santa Barbara did want him as a baseball player and offered Reynolds a 
scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds enrolled as a physical education major with hopes of coaching baseball 
some day. 
</P>
<P>
He played second base for the Gauchos from 1960-62. During that time he roomed 
with Gary Davis, a starter on the Santa Barbara basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds became intrigued with basketball and constantly pumped Davis for 
information. The two would stay up late at night talkin' hoops. 
</P>
<P>
"Bill was like a sponge," said Davis, now a rancher in Arroyo Grande, Calif. 
"He was always interested in how our offense worked or what we did in practice. 
He didn't just watch the game, he studied it." 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds began attending basketball practice in his spare time, as well as 
going to all the home games. He even took a basketball theory class from Art 
Gallon, then the Gaucho coach. 
</P>
<P>
The more he learned from Gallon, the more he wanted to coach basketball. 
</P>
<P>
"After being around Gary and taking the class from Dr. Gallon, I came to a 
point where I thought I might like to coach both sports," Reynolds said. "But, 
even then I felt I might prefer basketball." 
</P>
<P>
In June of 1963, Reynolds was hired by La Quinta High School to teach physical 
education and coach the C team in basketball and junior varsity baseball. 
</P>
<P>
But when he got to La Quinta, he was told he was the freshman football coach. 
</P>
<P>
"I spent the first 3 days of my career coaching freshman football and not 
having a clue what I was doing," Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
After 3 days, the administration decided it might be better to have Reynolds 
coach basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds spent one year with the C team and another with the junior varsity. 
Then, in 1966, Bob Wallace resigned as head basketball coach and Reynolds was 
offered the job. 
</P>
<P>
By then, he had given up completely on coaching baseball. 
</P>
<P>
In Reynolds' first varsity game as coach, La Quinta played Marina, coached by 
Lute Olson, in the Marina tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember it was something like 24-3 at the end of the first quarter and they 
had thrown 3 or 4 different presses at us," Reynolds said. "It was very 
humbling." 
</P>
<P>
Two nights later, in the consolation semifinals of the tournament, Reynolds was 
sitting a couple rows behind Olson and another coach. Both were watching 
another team lose badly. Olson turned to the coach next to him and said, 
"They're as bad as La Quinta." 
</P>
<P>
"I vowed then, that no matter what, we would be prepared to play," Reynolds 
said. 
</P>
<P>
If nothing else, Reynolds' teams have been prepared. And that's one of the 
reasons for his success through 13 years of high school coaching (11 at La 
Quinta and 2 at Bolsa Grande). He was 167-139 as a high school coach. 
</P>
<P>
Under Reynolds from 1966-76, La Quinta won 2 Garden Grove League titles and 
went to the playoffs 4 times. 
</P>
<P>
Always, the Aztecs were prepared. 
</P>
<P>
"One year, we were getting ready to play La Quinta and we had just come off a 
victory over Los Amigos, who was really good then," said Clete Adelman, who 
coached Bolsa Grande from 1972-76. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a couple of pretty quick guards and I thought we could press Bill's 
team, no problem. When the game started, he had one of his guards throw a 
baseball pass to midcourt to another guard, who threw it to another player for 
a basket. They did that all night and never dribbled the ball up court. We 
couldn't press them and they beat us." 
</P>
<P>
After 11 years at La Quinta, Reynolds felt burned out. He resigned at the end 
of the 1975-76 season. He spent the summer traveling with his wife and three 
daughters and returned to La Quinta to teach, but not coach. 
</P>
<P>
But, after 2 years, Reynolds was ready to return to coach. He took the Bolsa 
Grande job in 1978 and coached 2 years before resigning, this time because his 
wife, Shirley, was ill. 
</P>
<P>
It took a year and five specialists before the Reynolds discovered the illness 
could be controlled with medication. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds had become a counselor at Bolsa Grande. He was happy with his job, but 
the itch to coach began again. 
</P>
<P>
In the spring of 1980, he visited Southern California College on a whim and met 
Ed Moriarty. 
</P>
<P>
"When Ed found out who I was, he asked if I was interested in helping out," 
Reynolds said. "I discussed it with my wife and she said if I really wanted to 
do it, I should." 
</P>
<P>
After the 1980-81 season, Moriarty resigned and went into real estate. Reynolds 
was hesitant to apply. He didn't think he could devote time to both his job at 
Bolsa Grande and coaching at Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
However, the players and the school's administration both wanted him. 
</P>
<P>
Once he accepted the position, Reynolds went about changing the image of the 
team. He installed a run-and-gun offense, had his players press the entire game 
and put as much pressure on opposing teams as possible. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I think we might be confusing ourselves more than the other team," 
Reynolds said. "But I felt if we needed to be known for something. Not that an 
up-tempo team is all that original, but it's worked." 
</P>
<P>
After 2 years, Reynolds thought about moving on. He applied for a for jobs at 
Cal Poly Pomona and United States International. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't even get interviews, so obviously they were looking for something I 
didn't have," Reynolds said. "I thought about it and realized that those 
schools don't have a whole lot more than SCC does." 
</P>
<P>
So, Southern California College is now his home. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew after moving ump-teen times when my father was in the military that I 
just wasn't going to do that when I finally found a place where I was 
comfortable," Reynolds said. "I guess I'm just not a restless person." 
</P>
<P>
And besides, he'll always have Paris . . . and West Point . . . and El Paso . . 
.

UC IRVINE NOTEBOOK / JOHN WEYLER; 
</P>
<P>
DOKTORCZYK IS THE LATEST HULK TO ENDURE MULLIGAN'S WAY WITH WORDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By John Weyler 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bill Mulligan is not as physically intimidating as San Jose State Coach Bill 
Berry, but the UC Irvine basketball coach can deal out "mental cruelty" with 
the best of them. He's made many a 6-foot 9-inch hulk feel pretty small. 
</P>
<P>
This is not to say that the Anteaters are on the verge of boycotting unless the 
coach is fired, as is the case with 10 of Berry's players at San Jose State. 
Most of his players over the years have perceived Mulligan as a demanding 
guardian who expects a lot and screams a lot. But when he cuts loose with a 
particularly cutting tirade, the reverberations can be felt for quite some 
time. 
</P>
<P>
So, assistant Bob Thate quietly suggested that Mulligan be a bit less 
vociferous in his criticism of a certain player during a recent practice. 
</P>
<P>
Mulligan's response? 
</P>
<P>
"I yelled at (Wayne) Engelstad and (Bob) Thornton and they made it to the NBA . 
. . so why can't I yell at him." 
</P>
<P>
Senior center Mike Doktorczyk, the "him" in question, laughed about it later. 
"I don't know why Coach Thate thinks I can't take it," he said. "I can take 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Obviously. Doktorczyk came out of the coach's doghouse to make 12 of 12 shots 
-- including 4 of 4 3-pointers -- in Irvine's 90-88 victory over University of 
the Pacific Saturday night. He is second in the nation in 3-point field goal 
percentage (61%) after making 25 of 41 this season. 
</P>
<P>
There was a time, however, when he couldn't handle Mulligan's verbal abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Doktorczyk transferred from L.A. Harbor College and started 13 games for the 
Anteaters as a sophomore in the 1986-87 season. He scored 22 points and grabbed 
14 rebounds in the second game of that season, a 121-111 victory over Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
Nine games later, however, Doktorczyk was vividly experiencing the other end of 
the emotional spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
With Irvine holding a 1-point lead in the waning seconds at Fresno State, 
Doktorczyk threw away an inbounds pass and the Bulldogs scored. Then, with 13 
seconds left, he took an ill-advised, off-balance jump shot that didn't go in 
and Irvine lost. 
</P>
<P>
"In the timeout, I told Mike to call a timeout if he had to, but to make sure 
he didn't throw it away," Mulligan recalled. "Then, when we've still got plenty 
of time to get a good shot, he takes this horrible shot while he's falling off 
to his left." 
</P>
<P>
All of which proves that even a guy on his way to an MBA can do some really 
stupid things in the heat of a game. But Mulligan had never won a game at 
Fresno -- he still hasn't -- and he made his displeasure known. 
</P>
<P>
"He came down really hard on me," Doktorczyk said, managing a nervous smile. 
"Wayne (Engelstad) said it was the worst he'd ever seen. I should have called 
timeout. And I guess I forced the shot because I was trying to make amends. 
</P>
<P>
"I really started to lose my confidence after that. I felt like if I missed a 
couple of shots, he'd take me out. I was afraid to do anything. And, the fact 
was, people on the bench were producing more than I was and so I put even more 
pressure on myself." 
</P>
<P>
Doktorczyk buckled under the pressure. He played in all 30 games as a junior, 
but started just twice. His average fell from 8 points a game to 5 and, even 
though he seldom missed in practice, he shot an uncharacteristic 38% from the 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
Doktorczyk worked hard on his game last summer and fancied himself a starter 
when practice began before this season. He was more than a bit surprised to 
discover he had fallen to third string on the depth chart. 
</P>
<P>
His brother, Rob, a redshirt junior, had been penciled in as a starter. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't jealous of Rob, I was just frustrated because I apparently wasn't in 
their plans," Doktorczyk said. "I had gotten in the best shape of my life 
because we were supposed to play run-and-gun. I'd lifted weights and was 
stronger. And I played in a pro summer league against top-notch Division I 
players and was confident I could score." 
</P>
<P>
When the season began, Mulligan saw something in Doktorczyk he hadn't seen 
since the first month of his sophomore year. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike is finally shooting in games like he always has in practice," Mulligan 
said. "Right now, he's almost as valuable to us as Wayne Engelstad was last 
year. The only difference is he doesn't have the foot speed or quick first step 
that Wayne had. But he can play inside or outside and that's a pretty good guy 
to have." 
</P>
<P>
So Doktorczyk -- with a 57% shooting percentage, a 72% free-throw percentage, a 
14-point-per-game average and an 8-rebound-per-game average in hand -- has 
moved into Mulligan's penthouse. For now. 
</P>
<P>
But he probably won't forget what life in the basement was like. So the next 
time he makes a mistake, maybe he'll be able to keep it in perspective . . . 
even if Mulligan can't. 
</P>
<P>
Doktorczyk was held scoreless in the final 15:57 of Saturday's game. He scored 
28 points in the first 24 minutes. Had he maintained the pace, he would have 
been right on Kevin Magee's school record of 46. 
</P>
<P>
But there were a number of factors contributing to the 16-minute drought: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Pacific Coach Bob Thomason put Ron Tabron on Doktorczyk and the junior 
forward did a marvelous job of denying Doktorczyk the ball. "He was never more 
than a foot behind me," Doktorczyk said. "We even ran a couple special plays 
for me, but I couldn't get open enough and I didn't want to force anything." 
</P>
<P>
 -- After viewing the tape, Mulligan said Doktorczyk had posted up and was open 
underneath a number of times late in the game, but his teammates just failed to 
get the ball to him. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Doktorczyk gets a good portion of his 3-pointers after inbounding the ball 
and trailing the fast break. If there's no open route to the basket, the Irvine 
guards pass back to Doktorczyk, who often pulls up and shoots a yard or more 
behind the 19-foot 9-inch 3-point stripe. Pacific employed a full-court press 
much of the second half, negating that shot altogether. 
</P>
<P>
"The second half of the (conference) season, we're not going to get that 
trailing shot too often," Mulligan said. "Especially if people see this tape. 
Mike's going to have to work a little harder to get open 3-pointers from now 
on." 
</P>
<P>
Anteater Notes 
</P>
<P>
Coach Bill Mulligan, on the 10 San Jose State players who are boycotting and 
demanding the dismissal of Coach Bill Berry: "There's a lot of pressure on the 
administration up there. If they let (Berry) go, they're making a big mistake. 
It could happen tomorrow at 100 more schools if they do. I don't think 
(Fullerton Coach George) McQuarn should have quit before the season and I don't 
think kids should quit in the middle of the year." Mulligan is not a Berry fan, 
however. He recently has gained a bizarre form of respect for him, though. "He 
knows I hate him and I know he hates me and he doesn't even pretend to be my 
friend," Mulligan said. . . . Senior middle blocker Kris Roberts was named to 
the American Volleyball Coaches Assn. Southwest Region All-District team. She 
is the first Anteater to be selected to the team. . . . Speaking of firsts, the 
men's swimming team beat Cal State Northridge Saturday, the first victory over 
Northridge in Irvine's 24-year swimming history. 
</P>
<P>
Injury Report: Freshman Etop Udo-Ema, who injured his knee in a pickup game at 
Irvine while the team was in Utah, underwent surgery Monday to repair torn 
cartilage. Udo-Ema, who had 7 points and was 2 for 18 from the field in 3 
games, will be out for the remainder of the season. . . . Baltimore Orioles 
outfielder Brady Anderson headlines the Irvine graduates who will return to 
Anteater Field to face the 1988 varsity squad in the annual alumni game 
Saturday at 1 p.m. . . . The U.S. National soccer team is working out this week 
at Irvine.

GARDEN GROVE LEAGUE; 
</P>
<P>
CAMPBELL'S SHORT STINT DOESN'T SLOW LA QUINTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Is there a better pure shooter in Orange County than Scott Campbell of La 
Quinta High School? 
</P>
<P>
It seems doubtful, after watching Campbell score 27 points in little more than 
21 minutes Wednesday night in La Quinta's 74-58 Garden Grove League victory 
over host Rancho Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell made 12 of 16 shots, with all but one from beyond 15 feet, despite 
seeing limited action after getting his fourth foul with 6:43 remaining in the 
third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
During one stretch, Campbell, a 6-foot 3-inch senior, made 8 consecutive shots 
to help La Quinta (13-4, 8-0) solidify its hold on first place in the 8-team 
league. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's a better shooter around, I haven't seen him," said Jim Perry, La 
Quinta's coach. "Scott has the good height and the great strength to get over 
guys, even when he's covered. 
</P>
<P>
"He has unlimited range and is an excellent leaper. So far, nobody has been 
able to guard him. I think he's the best player in the county." 
</P>
<P>
But with Campbell on the bench, La Quinta got a chance to demonstrate it's not 
a one-dimensional team. The Aztecs picked up the slack and were only outscored 
by a point during his lengthy absence. 
</P>
<P>
"We have one great individual, but we generally play well as a group," Perry 
said. "We got some quality minutes from our substitutes tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Alamitos (6-9, 4-4) was facing a must-win situation to keep its playoff 
aspirations alive, but the Vaqueros managed to make only 17 of 39 free throws 
for a dismal 44%. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to beat one of the big three (La Quinta, Kennedy and Pacifica) if we 
want to go to the playoffs, and so far, we haven't," said Terry Munson, Rancho 
Alamitos coach. "It's been a frustrating year." 
</P>
<P>
Los Amigos 73, Garden Grove 60 -- Carlos Palomino scored 24 points to lead Los

SMITHKLINE PRESIDENT RESIGNS AMID DISCORD OVER FUTURE POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL FLAGG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SmithKline Beckman Corp. surprised Wall Street Wednesday by announcing that 
President George W. Ebright has resigned. 
</P>
<P>
Not so surprising was a separate announcement that profits for the big 
Philadelphia drug manufacturer dropped 60% to $229 million in 1988. Sales rose 
10% to $4.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Fewer people are using the company's major product, the ulcer medicine Tagamet, 
and SmithKline management has no new drugs ready to take up the slack in sales. 
Instead, SmithKline -- the nation's eighth-largest drug company -- is trying to 
decide whether to sell or restructure some of its businesses. 
</P>
<P>
These include two Orange County subsidiaries: Beckman Instruments in Fullerton, 
a manufacturer of instruments for medical laboratories, and Allergan in Irvine, 
a manufacturer of eye-care and skin-care products. 
</P>
<P>
SmithKline recently sold 17% of Beckman's stock to the public as part of the 
company-wide restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
Ebright may have resigned because he disagreed with the pace of the changes, 
some stock analysts said. Another possible source of friction: Chairman Henry 
Wendt, who will assume Ebright's duties, said he would give more autonomy to 
subsidiaries, which meant less responsibility for the president. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Wendt said that Ebright, 50, resigned over "differences on 
matters of corporate policy." 
</P>
<P>
Ebright, president since April, 1987, said in an interview only that his 
resignation was "instigated solely by me, over some policy matters that deeply 
affect this company." 
</P>
<P>
Neither man would elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Two other top SmithKline executives resigned recently, and the company's stock 
price is well below analysts' estimates of its break-up value, touching off 
rumors that another drug company might try a hostile takeover. Those rumors 
weren't allayed by Wednesday's news, stock analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
"This brings everything else out in the open," said Jonathan S. Gelles, an 
analyst at brokers Wertheim Schroeder in New York. "I don't think you can rule 
out a takeover." 
</P>
<P>
Rumored in the past to be interested: British drug manufacturer Beecham Group 
PLC and Swiss drug company Ciba-Geigy AG, both of which have said they aren't 
interested. 
</P>
<P>
While the parent company is struggling, some of SmithKline's businesses are 
doing well enough to be coveted by other companies. Beckman Instruments, for 
instance, said Wednesday that profits rose 9% to $42.5 million last year. Sales 
rose 11% to $770 million. 
</P>
<P>
SmithKline hasn't ruled out selling more Beckman stock to the public or selling 
part of Allergan. Both companies said Wednesday that SmithKline had yet to make 
a decision on whether to spin them off. 
</P>
<P>
The parent company also owns SmithKline Bio-Science, which has a laboratory in 
Van Nuys. Together the three subsidiaries employ nearly 8,000 in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
But even a stock sale may be too little, too late for the company, according to 
stock analysts, who said that management hasn't prepared very well for the 
decline in Tagamet sales. 
</P>
<P>
Investors Wednesday seemed to agree. They greeted news of Ebright's resignation 
by bidding up SmithKline stock $1.375 a share, to $52. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that Wendt, 55, should share the blame for the company's 
declining fortunes. Wendt became chairman at the same time that Ebright assumed 
the presidency. Both are long-term employees. 
</P>
<P>
"To say Ebright did not do a very good job is evident from the company's 
position," said Viren Mehta, an analyst at S.G. Warburg &amp; Co. Inc. in New 
York. "But to single out one person is to suggest nobody else is to blame, 
which is simply not true." 
</P>
<P>
Despite spending hundreds of millions of dollars on research, the company has 
yet to come up with a new drug to replace Tagamet, once the best-selling 
prescription drug in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"They've spent that kind of money and there's very little in the pipeline," 
said Robert Uhl, an analyst for Salomon Bros. "They haven't had anything for 
five years." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to these products, SmithKline also makes Dyazide, a blood pressure 
drug; Ecotrin, a coated aspirin, and Contac, an allergy medication. 
</P>
<P>
But it was Tagamet that showered profits on SmithKline in the heady 1970s. 
SmithKline had the $1.8-billion U.S. market for prescription ulcer medicines 
pretty much to itself until 1983, when British drug manufacturer Glaxo Holdings 
PLC introduced Zantac. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, patients could take Zantac less frequently and it was thought to 
have fewer side effects. And although it was more expensive than Tagamet, it 
stormed into the lead within a few years. Zantac now accounts for 46% of the 
U.S. market, compared with 29% for Tagamet. 
</P>
<P>
Worldwide, where sales of ulcer medicines totaled $5 billion last year, Zantac 
had an estimated 44% market share, compared with 21% for Tagamet. 
</P>
<P>
Although Tagamet still accounted for more than $1 billion in sales last year, 
the company said sales of Tagamet were down "sharply" in the United States. 
That's a problem because Tagamet accounts for a significant portion of 
SmithKline's profits. 
</P>
<P>
Mehta, the analyst, estimates that Tagamet sales fell 10% worldwide last year. 
He predicted that Zantac will become the first drug in history to have $2 
billion in sales this year. 
</P>
<P>
Like other analysts, Mehta said he wouldn't be averse to seeing SmithKline 
radically restructure, either prompted from within or from a new owner. 
</P>
<P>
"At the moment, only Wendt is left from the old guard," Mehta said. "So far he 
appears to have the confidence of the board. But one has to ask whether the 
situation is getting desperate and how long the board can wait?" 
</P>

MORNING REPORT: 'YOUNG GUNS,' 'RED HEAT' BARREL TO BARREL

Who'll win the shootout for the top spot of the Billboard magazine rental chart 
-- "Red Heat" (No. 2) or "Young Guns" (No. 3)? Some of the smart money's on 
"Young Guns" -- which is loaded with crowd-pleasing Brat Packers -- to finally 
blast "Three Men and a Baby" out of No. 1. Renters are finding the racy "The 
Unbearable Lightness of Being" quite bearable. It jumped 13 places to No. 14. 
Teen-oriented "License to Drive" (No. 10) looks like a sleeper hit. 
</P>
<P>
* The quirky horror tale, about a man and his sinister monkey, didn't have a 
shining start in the rental market, but now "Monkey Shines" looks like it has 
jumped from just the horror buffs to the general audience. This week, it's a 
glowing No. 12.

CLIPPER SKID HITS 12 DESPITE COACH'S DEBUT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Don Casey's day in the sun, his first game as a head coach in the National 
Basketball Assn., began in the rain. 
</P>
<P>
His morning jog, used partly to work off some of the anxiety that had been 
building since he was named the Clippers' interim coach for the remainder of 
the season, was dampened by heavy showers. Later Wednesday night, the Dallas 
Mavericks often made his team look as if it were playing in a fog, beating the 
Clippers, 117-98, before 17,007 fans at Reunion Arena. 
</P>
<P>
But Norm Nixon, a basketball player, not a weatherman, said there was some 
break in the dark clouds, despite the Clippers suffering their 12th straight 
loss, 8 of which have been by double figures. Something about a silver lining. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like we have to go through training camp again in the middle of the 
season," Nixon said of the adjustments to the new coach. "These teams are all 
used to playing with each other, and we're not. 
</P>
<P>
"But it felt good, and that's nice. It hadn't felt good like that in weeks." 
</P>
<P>
Meaning the change from Gene Shue to Casey has already done some good, at least 
from the players' point of view. 
</P>
<P>
"He basically left a lot of it up to us to play," Nixon said. "He gave us a 
little freedom to get out and play." 
</P>
<P>
But the Clippers (10-29) surrendered 42 points in the first quarter to tie the 
team's season high, were held to fewer than 100 points for the third time in 4 
games, and shot a dismal 40.2% from the field. 
</P>
<P>
Casey's self-critique went something like this: The offense was "disjointed" 
and "laboring" and didn't have much "up" in the planned up-tempo game. The 
defense, his area of speciality, was better but got bombed in the first 12 
minutes of the game. 
</P>
<P>
But, hey, what did you want from a guy who has only been in charge since last 
Thursday? 
</P>
<P>
Though there was the emotional high that can be expected in the first game with 
any new coach, there are still some problems Casey must sort out. 
</P>
<P>
The offense not only didn't run much, it just plain stood around too often. The 
game was another example of how much the Clippers need another consistent 
scorer to complement Quintin Dailey, who had a team-high 22 points. Take away 
his 9-of-18 shooting, and the Clippers made just 38% of their shots. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing really went well," Casey admitted. 
</P>
<P>
The only real negative for Dallas, which had lost 9 of its previous 11 games, 
came in the third quarter when Rolando Blackman dislocated the little finger on 
his left hand. The Mavericks' No. 2 scorer is expected to be out 2 to 3 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Aguirre led Dallas with 24 points, and Derek Harper had 23. James 
Donaldson added 18 points and 13 rebounds.

RICE SAYS HE WAS SLIGHTED BY MEDIA;

<P>
49ERS' SUPER BOWL MVP SAYS MONTANA GOT THE ATTENTION

<P>
Jerry Rice, the Super Bowl's most valuable player, claimed in a television 
interview Wednesday that he has been relegated to the back pages of the sports 
section while most attention focuses on Joe Montana. 
</P>
<P>
Rice, 26, whose big plays in Sunday's game helped the San Francisco 49ers score 
a 20-16 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals, told KRON-TV in the copyrighted 
interview that the media has not given him his due. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say it's the media, the media's fault, because they're not getting my 
name out there," Rice told sportscaster Pete Liebengood during the interview at 
San Francisco International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if I'll get any recognition in commercials or anything, but right 
now, the way things are looking, I'm not going to get nothing out of being MVP. 
Just the name, the MVP, and that's it." 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco Chronicle sports editor John Curley said he was "taken by 
surprise" by the remark. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's something we haven't said, if there's something he'd like to tell 
us, heck, he could have a byline story in the Chronicle anytime he wants," 
Curley said. 
</P>
<P>
Glenn Schwarz, sports editor of the San Francisco Examiner, said: "I'm sorry he 
feels that way, because there was no conscious decision on our part to slight 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Schwarz called Rice "a fantastic player" who has been featured prominently in 
the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Rice said he is not asking "for all the recognition." But he claimed that if 
the MVP award had gone to Montana, the quarterback would have received more 
prominent coverage. 
</P>
<P>
"If it were Joe Montana, Dwight Clark, it would have been headlines all over," 
Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
"And, no, I'm not saying it's racism or nothing like that; I'm really just 
speaking from my heart. And I think everybody in the Bay Area would feel the 
same way." 
</P>
<P>
Rice is black, Montana white. 
</P>
<P>
When Liebengood asked whether Rice would agree that "there is an implication" 
of racism in his statement, Rice replied, "Yeah, I would say so." 
</P>
<P>
Rice made 3 catches in the final drive of the game for 51 yards and finished 
with 11 catches for 215 yards, both Super Bowl records. He also had 1 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Rice's final catch set up John Taylor's 10-yard winning touchdown that came 
with 34 seconds left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
When Rice accepted the MVP award after Sunday's game, he said he would "rather 
give Joe (Montana) the MVP any day" because Montana had been the team's leader 
throughout the year. Rice told Liebengood that he agrees Montana deserves the 
recognition he receives but that Rice should share more of the limelight. 
</P>
<P>
Rice's wife, Jackie, said her husband appeared depressed after riding in a 
victory parade Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"To him it seems like he hadn't accomplished anything," she said. "And it just 
bothers me to see him that way, knowing that he is the greatest receiver of his 
time."

MORNING BRIEFING: THIS GENIUS IS NOT ALL THAT SMART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Buffalo Bills Coach Marv Levy is a Phi Beta Kappa who earned a master's degree 
in history at Harvard, but he cringes when they call him an intellectual. 
</P>
<P>
Levy told the Sporting News: "I'm intellectual enough to read William F. 
Buckley Jr.'s column, but I'm not intellectual enough to finish it." 
</P>
<P>
Add Sporting News: From its pro football notes: "Oilers General Manager Ladd 
Herzeg apologized to Houston Chronicle columnist Fran Blinebury for hitting the 
writer twice on the side of the head after a 5-hour lunch Jan. 9. A waiter at 
the restaurant said 6 bottles of champagne were consumed during the meal." 
</P>
<P>
4 Years Ago Today: On Jan. 26, 1985, Edmonton's Wayne Gretzky scored his 50th 
goal in the 49th game of the season, a 6-3 win over the Pittsburgh Penguins. 
</P>
<P>
In 49 games for the Kings this year, Gretzky has 33 goals. 
</P>
<P>
For What It's Worth: California teams have won 12 of the 27 titles up for grabs 
in professional baseball, football and basketball during the 1980s. The Dodgers 
have won two, the San Francisco 49ers three, the Oakland-Los Angeles Raiders 
two and the Lakers five. 
</P>
<P>
There have been no hockey titles, but Gov. Deukmejian says, "Can the Great 
Gretzky and the Los Angeles Kings be far behind?" 
</P>
<P>
Trivia Time: What was the name of the movie in which Ronald Reagan portrayed 
George Gipp? (Answer below.) 
</P>
<P>
Have USC students tired of reading about their basketball team? In Tuesday's 
Daily Trojan, there were stories on men's volleyball, women's basketball, men's 
swimming, Pac-10 players of the week and the triumphant return of the 49ers to 
San Francisco, but nary a word on George Raveling's club. 
</P>
<P>
Poor Cincinnati. Even when San Francisco fouls up, the Bengals can't beat the 
49ers. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's snafu by the 49ers (see story at top of page) recalls the memorable 
goal-line stand they made in beating the Bengals, 26-21, in the 1982 Super 
Bowl. On one of the plays, the 49ers had only 10 men on the field. 
</P>
<P>
Missing was linebacker Keena Turner. Explained 49er defensive coordinator Chuck 
Studley: "What happened is that I called for our goal-line defense to go in, 
but Keena thought I said 'giant' defense and didn't go in." 
</P>
<P>
The Times' headline read: "48ers Have Enough to Win It All." 
</P>
<P>
Ben Henkey of the Sporting News, in an obituary on former New York Giants first 
baseman Bill Terry, the last National Leaguer to hit .400, revived this ditty 
by poet-humorist Ogden Nash: 
</P>
<P>
 "T is for Terry 
</P>
<P>
 The Giant from Memphis 
</P>
<P>
 Whose 400 average 
</P>
<P>
 You can't overemphis."

PEBBLE BEACH NATIONAL PRO-AMATEUR; 
</P>
<P>
STEVE JONES MAY BE WITHOUT HIS GOOD-LUCK CHARM 
</P>

<P>
It would be no surprise if Steve Jones has already made arrangements for his 
former golf coach, Mark Simpson, to be with him for the National Pro-Amateur 
tournament starting here today. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson, who coached Jones at the University of Colorado, has been a good-luck 
charm for his protege. 
</P>
<P>
When Jones won here last year in a playoff with Bob Tway for his first PGA Tour 
victory, Simpson was in the gallery. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson also followed Jones around the last 4 holes of the final round of the 
Tournament of Champions in La Costa earlier this month. Jones won. 
</P>
<P>
A week later in Palm Desert, Simpson was with Jones for all 5 rounds of the Bob 
Hope Classic, which Jones won in a sudden death playoff with Paul Azinger and 
Sandy Lyle. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, however, was on his own at the Phoenix Open last week. Simpson stayed 
home and Jones, who lives in Phoenix, didn't make the cut. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, by winning the first 2 tour events, Jones matched the 
accomplishment of Gil Morgan, who started fast in 1983 with victories in the 
Tucson and Los Angeles tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
If Jones doesn't win another tournament the rest of the year, he still won't be 
hurting financially. His victories were worth $315,000, or $73,123 more than he 
earned in 25 tour events in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The sudden emergence of the 30-year-old Jones as a factor on the tour could be 
linked, Simpson said, to his embracing Christianity. 
</P>
<P>
During his rounds and after his wins at La Costa and Palm Desert, Jones opened 
the press conferences with brief statements on his religious beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
"I know a lot of people don't want to hear me talk about my religion," Jones 
said after winning the Hope tournament. "But I'm going to keep talking about it 
every chance I get. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to be a boozer and I didn't care about anyone else 5 years ago. People 
who knew me will tell you that." 
</P>
<P>
Simpson confirmed that Jones was, indeed, difficult to deal with at one time. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a partyer in college and in turmoil with himself," Simpson said. "We 
had a lot of heart-to-heart talks. He wasn't easy to get along with." 
</P>
<P>
Simpson recalled that Jones decided in 1984 to change his life style through 
religion. 
</P>
<P>
"As I remember it, he was at a tournament in South America with a buddy," 
Simpson said. "They got back to their hotel and were drunk and were messing 
around with women. 
</P>
<P>
"Steve said to himself, 'If I'm going to play professional golf, I'm going to 
have to get rid of this stuff.' " 
</P>
<P>
Jones later became acquainted with Paul Westphal, the former USC All-American 
guard and National Basketball Assn. star of the Phoenix Suns. 
</P>
<P>
"He had already become a Christian by the time I met him," said Westphal, now 
an assistant coach with the Suns, who was coaching at Southwestern Bible 
College in Phoenix at the time. 
</P>
<P>
"However, I did introduce him to his future wife, Bonnie. She was a cheerleader 
at the college and used to baby-sit for my kids. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him, 'Steve, I want you to meet your future wife.' I really didn't 
believe it at the time, but it worked out." 
</P>
<P>
Westphal recalls that Jones was enthusiastic about his conversion to 
Christianity. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson added: "After about a month, he was really into it, preaching to 
everybody and trying to get everybody to convert. It was exciting to him 
because he finally had some peace in his life." 
</P>
<P>
Simpson said that he first watched Jones play when Jones tried to qualify for 
the U.S. Open in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
"His fundamentals were bad and he shot an 84 on the first day," Simpson said. 
"But he came back with a 72 on a really tough course." 
</P>
<P>
Jones was Simpson's first recruit at Colorado in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
"I gave him a full ride and, in college golf, that's almost unheard of," 
Simpson said. "In his last 2 years in college, he was a second-team 
All-American. His fundamentals were still bad, but he scored in important 
tournaments." 
</P>
<P>
Jones qualified for the PGA Tour in 1982, but had to quit in June of that year 
because of an injured left thumb that required surgery. 
</P>
<P>
"That had to be the lowest point of his life because of his dream to be on the 
Tour," Simpson said. "He knew his thumb was killing him, but he still got after 
it. He shouldn't have been playing at all." 
</P>
<P>
Simpson said there were other low points for Jones, such as finishing 129th and 
136th on the money lists in 1985 and 1986, barely missing an exemption priority 
of the top 125. 
</P>
<P>
However, he fared better in 1987. He finished 66th in money, earning $154,918. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, he moved up to 45th, earned $241,877, and got his first Tour win 
here. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson said that perseverance is one of Jones' main assets. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll never give up until you beat him on the 18th hole," Simpson said. "That 
was evident at the Hope tournament. He shot a 76 the first day and he wasn't 
feeling good. He told his wife Bonnie that he wanted to win back-to-back 
tournaments very badly. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, on the fourth round, he shoots a 63 at Eldorado. He started out the back 
nine eagle, birdie, birdie. It was the closest I've ever seen anyone come to 
breaking 60." 
</P>
<P>
Jones had another 63 a week ago in the pro-am event preceding the Phoenix Open. 
</P>
<P>
He shot a 68 on the first day of the tournament, but couldn't sustain his drive 
in the second round, slumping to a 79. 
</P>
<P>
"I 3-putted the second, third and fourth holes and the air just went out of 
me," said Jones, who added that he had had to unplug his phone before the 
tournament because of so many requests for interviews. "But I have no excuses," 
Jones said. "I just burned out." 
</P>
<P>
When he was asked if there was a sense of relief that the pressure of his 
2-tournament winning streak is now over, Jones smiled and said: 
</P>
<P>
"I would have liked to win 3, 4, 5 or more (in a row)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
To some degree, Jones is a self-taught player. 
</P>
<P>
"He learned to play by reading magazines and then experimenting," Simpson said. 
"He had no formal instruction at all when he was young. But he knew he wanted 
to play on the tour when he was 12 years old." 
</P>
<P>
Simpson said that he'll most likely miss the tournament here because of his 
coaching responsibilities in Boulder. 
</P>
<P>
Jones said he may persuade Simpson to change his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"If I make the cut here, I'm going to call him." 
</P>
<P>
Golf Notes 
</P>
<P>
Atypical weather is forecast for the 4-day tournament, meaning no rain and 
temperatures in the high 60s, or low 70s. . . . The tournament purse is $1 
million, with first place worth $180,000. Three courses, Pebble Beach, Spyglass 
Hill and Cypress Point, will be used the first 3 days, with the final round 
played at Pebble Beach. . . . Mark Calcavecchia is confident, coming off his 
7-stroke victory in the Phoenix Open. "I'm not changing anything in my game 
this week," he said. "The main thing probably will be keeping my concentration 
because I'm playing so good." Calcavecchia had a 2-stroke lead going into the 
final round of the Bob Hope tournament. However, he shot a 72 for a 344, 
winding up a stroke behind Steve Jones, Paul Azinger and Sandy Lyle, who were 
involved in a playoff. Calcavecchia said he won't play it safe here. "If I'm 
standing on 18th tee at Pebble Beach Sunday with a 1-stroke lead, I'll be 
swinging a driver." In his last 8 rounds, Calcavecchia has been over 68 just 
once. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Nicklaus, who isn't as active on the tour as he once was, is in the field. 
"I haven't forgotten how to win," Nicklaus said. "I just don't get into 
contention much anymore." Nicklaus, who has been bothered by back problems, is 
spurning the option of surgery. "It's like the old joke. If I knew I'd hold up 
so long, I would have taken better care of myself." Nicklaus is taking care of 
himself here with stretching exercises. . . . The format for the tournament is 
for each pro to play with an amateur partner in a foursome through 4 rounds. 
Nicklaus is paired with his amateur son, Steve, a former football player at 
Florida State. . . . Actor Jack Lemmon is paired with Peter Jacobsen in the 
same foursome with his actor son, Chris. Lemmon, who said he has been playing 
in this tournament since 1964, is dedicated to making the cut for the first 
time. "Twenty-five is the magic number," he said, referring to his years in the 
tournament. "The first step is to make the cut, then the next one is to win 
it."

SCOTT OSTLER: THIS MAY BE GAME WITHIN A GAME, BUT THE MIND BOGGLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Scott Ostler

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The big game is over, but the memories linger, like a hangover. 
</P>
<P>
Football fans are still buzzing. 
</P>
<P>
Two days after the big one, a Times co-worker asks me, "Are you, like I was, 
surprised at how easily Bud moved the ball against Bud Light?" 
</P>
<P>
The co-worker, Bill (not his real name; his real name is Jeff Fellenzer), also 
mused, "Do you get the feeling those two teams really don't like each other?" 
</P>
<P>
I set Bill straight, told him that these are two teams headed in opposite 
directions. Bud Light, obviously suffering from too much patented beechwood 
aging, is overdue for a major recycling. They simply have to get off their 
cans. 
</P>
<P>
Bud, meanwhile, hasn't even tapped its potential. 
</P>
<P>
For years, the L.A. Kings were too nice, soft as a goose-down pillow. 
</P>
<P>
This season they added the ultimate nice-guy, Gretzky, but they also toughened 
up with Marty McSorley and Ken Baumgartner, guys who mix it up but also do some 
skating. McSorley skates, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
But have the Kings gone too far? To beef up their defense, they traded for Jay 
Miller, who is closing in on 1,000 penalty minutes in his 4-year career. He 
also averages about a goal every 20 games, so guess what his speciality is? 
</P>
<P>
To call Miller a defensive specialist would be like calling Mike Tyson a dental 
technician. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it's impossible to win in the National Hockey League without playing 
eye-sockey ice hockey, but it would have been nice to see the local club give 
it a try. 
</P>
<P>
My hockey knowledge runs as deep as the L.A. River, so I don't understand why 
Bernie Nicholls got a 10-minute misconduct penalty and a game misconduct 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
For something he said. 
</P>
<P>
In a league in which players casually attack one another with wooden carving 
tools, in which fistfights occur more frequently than goals, a player can be 
penalized for talking? 
</P>
<P>
I guess that's a good policy, though, considering how many kids watch hockey. 
We wouldn't want to give them the idea that it's OK to use bad language. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of finesse, where did the San Francisco 49ers get this reputation as a 
finesse football team? 
</P>
<P>
You don't tiptoe and tap dance your way to 3 Super Bowl titles. 
</P>
<P>
Tough guys? One report is that Ronnie Lott was so storming mad at halftime that 
he accidentally broke the handle off his teacup. 
</P>
<P>
New York Daily News columnist Mike Lupica has brought peace to his city by 
arranging an arbitration settlement between warring parties Dave Winfield and 
George Steinbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
In a similar spirit of public service, I would like to head off the greatest 
menace facing our city -- the threat of the Dodgers losing Orel Hershiser next 
season by alienating him in their current contract talks. Remember Steve Sax? 
</P>
<P>
Here's the solution, Dodgers: Stop negotiations at once. Hand Orel a blank 
contract, signed by Peter O'Malley, and let Hershiser fill it in. 
</P>
<P>
Look at Orel's face. If you can't trust him, who can you trust? 
</P>
<P>
Would he overcharge? Impossible. Let's say he inks himself in for 5 years at $4 
million per. 
</P>
<P>
A steal. A bargain. Trust me. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, you Dodgers should be protected against the ugly eventuality of a 
damaged arm. Thus, a contract clause: If Orel hurts his arm and can't pitch 
anymore, limiting him to pinch-hitting duty, he would take a pay cut of several 
hundred dollars a year. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of steal, here's another suggestion for Fast Freddie Claire, Dodger 
GM: 
</P>
<P>
Remember when Charles O. Finley owned the A's and he hired sprinter Herb 
Washington as a designated baserunner? Washington bombed, because he never 
grasped the concept of the pickoff. 
</P>
<P>
But the idea had merit, and your Dodgers are going to be lacking in overall 
team speed next season. 
</P>
<P>
Solution: Florence Griffith Joyner. 
</P>
<P>
She's a local hero, she's between Olympics, she's smart, tough and fast. 
</P>
<P>
And with those fingernails, she would be unstoppable with a headfirst slide. 
</P>
<P>
We may not have seen the last of football's suddenly-passe dance step. 
</P>
<P>
There is a rumor that the CHP has adopted the Ickey Shuffle as the official 
field sobriety test. 
</P>
<P>
I swear, honest, I'm rooting for Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. We old people have to 
stick together. 
</P>
<P>
I hope Kareem gets fired up and makes all the sportswriters clamoring for his 
retirement eat their words. 
</P>
<P>
If Kareem does bounce back, the Lakers will re-repeat. 
</P>
<P>
He seems to be asserting himself more on offense. He's working on defense, 
muscling up. He fouled out against the Knicks Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
But 1 rebound in 24 minutes against the Knicks? One rebound in 23 minutes 
against the Mavericks? 
</P>
<P>
Looks like an ominous trend, but I could be wrong. If Kareem averages 8 
rebounds over the next 6 games, I'll eat this column at the Forum, midcourt, 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
How do you stop a wave? 
</P>
<P>
At Mickey Thompson's Off-Road Championship Grand Prix Saturday in Anaheim 
Stadium, 65,000 fans were doing the wave, which is as outdated as the Ickey 
Shuffle. Come time to start a race, the public-address announcer barked: 
</P>
<P>
"Knock it off!" 
</P>
<P>
It worked. 
</P>
<P>
Highlight of the night: Danny Thompson screaming through 4 laps of the winding, 
killer course with the hood of his mini-pickup sticking straight up in front of 
his face. 
</P>
<P>
Goes to show that as a driving aid, seeing is vastly overrated.

PUCKETT AGREES TO $2-MILLION PACT PLUS BONUSES; 
</P>
<P>
HOWELL, MILLER ALSO AVOID ARBITRATION BY REACHING AGREEMENTS WITH ANGELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Angels resolved two more of their arbitration cases Wednesday, reaching 
1-year agreements with Jack Howell and Darrell Miller, but their terms paled 
compared to the agreement Kirby Puckett reached with the Minnesota Twins. 
</P>
<P>
Puckett, one of four players who filed for salary arbitration at $2 million or 
more, agreed to a 1989 contract calling for $2 million in salary and $200,000 
in award bonuses. Puckett, who earned $1.21 million in salary and award bonuses 
last season, when he batted .356 with 24 home runs and 121 runs batted in, had 
submitted an arbitration figure of $2,150,000, compared to the Twins' offer of 
$1.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement makes the 27-year-old center fielder reach $2 million in salary 
faster than any player in major league history. Puckett has 4 years 147 days of 
major league service. Don Mattingly of the New York Yankees had 4 years 163 
days last winter when he agreed to a 3-year, $6.7-million deal that paid him $2 
million in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Puckett's 1988 batting average, second in the American League to Wade Boggs' 
.366, was the highest for a right-handed hitter since Joe DiMaggio batted .357 
in 1941, and he won a Gold Glove for the third straight year. His agent, Ron 
Shapiro, said that negotiations involving a multiyear contract are continuing 
with the Twins. 
</P>
<P>
Howell, the Angels' third baseman who made $200,000 while hitting 16 homers and 
driving in 63 runs in his second full season, agreed to an estimated $465,000 
after filing at $495,000. The Angels countered at $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, a reserve catcher who hit .221 in 70 games, got a $50,000 raise to 
$157,500. He filed at $187,500 compared to the Angels' offer of $107,500. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels still face the possibility of four arbitration cases, with hearings 
scheduled for relief pitcher Greg Minton Feb. 1, outfielder Chili Davis Feb. 3, 
first baseman Wally Joyner Feb. 6 and shortstop Dick Schofield Feb. 13. 
</P>
<P>
After some initial bitterness over what he termed a lack of meaningful 
negotiations with the Angels, Joyner's attorney, Barry Axelrod, said Wednesday 
that there has been improvement. 
</P>
<P>
"We seem to be on a better ground," he said. "I think everyone is attempting to 
be more constructive. I'm still assuming that we'll arbitrate, but I'm hopeful 
it might be otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
Six other players reached agreements Wednesday, reducing the number of players 
still headed for arbitration to 90. 
</P>
<P>
Relief pitcher Jeff Robinson, who made $475,000 last year, agreed to a 2-year 
contract with the Pittsburgh Pirates for $1.675 million. Pittsburgh first 
baseman Sid Bream agreed to a 1-year contract at $510,000, a raise of $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
Outfielder Oddibe McDowell and the Cleveland Indians agreed to a 1-year 
contract at $375,000, a $125,000 raise, and catcher Bob Melvin, traded by the 
San Francisco Giants to the Baltimore Orioles Tuesday, agreed to a 1-year 
contract at an estimated $215,000. The Oakland A's reached 1-year agreements 
with pitcher Curt Young and utility infielder Mike Gallego for undisclosed 
terms.

LENDL, MECIR APPEAR TO BE ON A COLLISION COURSE; 
</P>
<P>
THEIR SEMIFINAL OPPONENTS, MUSTER AND GUNNARSSON, NOT EXPECTED TO MATCH UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
MELBOURNE, Australia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What kind of Grand Slam is this? Ivan Lendl is the only one of the top eight 
seeded players left in the men's singles semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
Miloslav Mecir, whose beard gets longer and whose game gets better each day, 
had an explanation: 
</P>
<P>
"It just happened," Mecir said. 
</P>
<P>
So there you have it. By chance -- or by upset -- the Australian Open 
semifinals have taken on an ordinary look. A Lendl-Mecir final seems likely, 
although they both have to win first. 
</P>
<P>
Their opponents? Lendl plays Thomas Muster, the finest player in all of 
Austria. Tennis, Muster said, really isn't emphasized in his country. 
</P>
<P>
"Skiing and soccer are more important," said Muster, who sometimes practices 
with Lendl. 
</P>
<P>
On form, the second-seeded Lendl should have a nice practice while beating 
11th-seeded Muster, who is ranked No. 15 in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Mecir seems headed toward a semifinal mismatch against Jan Gunnarsson, who is 
ranked 10th in Sweden. Mecir is No. 13 in the world. 
</P>
<P>
So it falls to Gunnarsson to carry the recent Swedish tradition of winning this 
event. Either Mats Wilander or Stefan Edberg has won the Open each of the last 
5 years. 
</P>
<P>
Gunnarsson, whose previous best Grand Slam finish was in the 1984 French Open, 
where he gained the quarterfinals, apparently isn't too concerned about playing 
Mecir. 
</P>
<P>
"In the semifinals, anybody can win, I think," he said. "OK, I'm not the 
favorite, but I think I have a chance." 
</P>
<P>
Gunnarsson upset sixth-seeded Henri Leconte in the first round and since then 
the pressure has been off, so he has tried to enjoy himself. With his 
girlfriend and their 5-year-old daughter, Anna, Gunnarsson has busily been 
doing the city, the zoo and the beaches. 
</P>
<P>
"Probably after this week, I'm dead," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Probably after playing Mecir, he's gone, too. But then, one never knows about 
Mecir. The lanky Czech has a reputation for the unusual on the court and 
sometimes it's a question of which Milo will show up. 
</P>
<P>
Although he is regarded as one of the world's most skilled players, Mecir 
sometimes doesn't feel like playing. 
</P>
<P>
John McEnroe was already looking ahead to how Mecir would react in a final 
against Lendl. 
</P>
<P>
"You never know with Mecir," McEnroe said. "He could lose badly, but he could 
give Lendl one hell of a match. It depends on the day, what side of the bed he 
wakes up on." 
</P>
<P>
Mecir presents other problems when he decides to play. He enjoys a reputation 
for driving Mats Wilander crazy because of his penchant for unorthodox shots. 
</P>
<P>
"He is playing a strange game," Gunnarsson said. "He is playing the ball where 
you don't expect it to come -- in the wrong corner -- he is playing inside-out 
like this all the time. He gets a lot of angles. I don't think there's any 
top-ranked player who plays like him." 
</P>
<P>
Outside of Lendl, no one has played better here than Mecir, who has lost only 1 
set in his 5 matches. But if he has been normal on the court, Mecir continues 
to hit something of the odd ball off it. 
</P>
<P>
Mecir's postmatch news conferences have been stunningly unconventional. A 
sample: 
</P>
<P>
Question: How will you prepare for Gunnarsson? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: I just prepare. No problem. 
</P>
<P>
Q: You once said you felt at ease in certain places, like Australia, because 
you felt nearer to nature. Would you expand on that? 
</P>
<P>
A: I like nature more. I think each country has different nature. And the 
buildings, sometimes they're made of different architecture. But nature is 
something different. You cannot change it just like that. It has to be there 
for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How would you describe the secret of your success? 
</P>
<P>
A: To feel good. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is there a question of consistency for you? 
</P>
<P>
A: Sometimes it is, sometimes not. 
</P>
<P>
Mecir stories abound. Once he flew from Europe to play an exhibition in Tokyo 
when he had a bad cold. Mecir was asked why he would travel so far if he was 
sick. 
</P>
<P>
"I was on the plane and I started to sneeze," Mecir said. "It was hard to get 
off." 
</P>
<P>
Another time, after Mecir revealed that he enjoyed fishing, he was continually 
asked about his passion for fishing. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Mecir is only an occasional angler, but he soon regretted being asked 
time and time again about spending so much time fishing. Mecir told friends 
that if he said he'd read a book, he would be called an intellectual. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters at the 1987 French Open were having no luck in getting Mecir to talk 
about himself and he continued to give short answers. 
</P>
<P>
An exasperated reporter suggested to Mecir that instead of being asked more 
silly questions, what single question would he like to be asked? 
</P>
<P>
"That," said Mecir, "is the silliest question of them all."

NEWSWIRE: BENGALS REWARD WYCHE WITH 5-YEAR CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sam Wyche, who coached the Cincinnati Bengals to the Super Bowl in one of the 
most dramatic turnarounds in National Football League history, reaped the 
rewards Wednesday when he agreed to a 5-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals, 4-11 in 1987, went 12-4 and won the American Football Conference 
championship this season before losing to the San Francisco 49ers in last 
Sunday's Super Bowl, 20-16. 
</P>
<P>
Wyche's previous 5-year contract expired at the end of the 1988 season. Wyche, 
44, got $250,000 a year under the old contract, but refused to discuss his new 
salary or other contract terms. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike and Paul and myself have agreed to agree for another 5 years," Wyche 
said, referring to the Bengals' general manager, Paul Brown, and Brown's son, 
Mike, the team's assistant general manager. "I am looking forward to finishing 
some unfinished business."

PINCAY GETS GUM HOME FIRST BY A NOSE IN SAN VICENTE STAKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gum scored his third victory in four starts when he beat Yes I'm Blue by a nose 
in the $81,350 San Vicente Stakes for 3-year-olds Wednesday at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
Gum, a grandson of Gummo, was ridden by Laffit Pincay and covered the 7 
furlongs in 1:22 2/5. Gum and Yes I'm Blue fought the whole way, with Gum 
saving ground along the rail through the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
Roman Avie was another 3 1/2 lengths back in third while the favorite, Sitting 
Appeal, finished fifth in the field of 7. 
</P>
<P>
The first 3 finishers are nominated to the $500,000 Santa Anita Derby April 8. 
</P>
<P>
The California-bred Gum, fourth choice of the crowd of 16,390, paid $20.60, 
$9.40 and $6, and earned $47,600 for the Hat Ranch. Gum is trained by Mel 
Stute. 
</P>
<P>
Yes I'm Blue, with Fernando Valenzuela aboard, paid $5.60 and $3.80. Roman 
Avie, ridden by Gary Stevens, paid $4.80. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Delahoussaye rode 4 winners to tie Valenzuela for third in the riding 
standings with 25 victories apiece. Delahoussaye won with Aranjuez ($34.60) in 
the first race, Teddy Bear Picnic ($3.80) in the fourth, Dance For Lee ($5.80) 
in the fifth and Exodus From Rome ($10.20) in the ninth.

KING GLORIOUS' DERBY CHANCES UNCERTAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The veterinarian for undefeated King Glorious said the 3-year-old colt will not 
be ready to run in the Kentucky Derby, but the horse's trainer is not ruling 
out the possibility. 
</P>
<P>
After examining King Glorious at Golden Gate Fields Wednesday and looking at 
his X-rays, veterinarian Jack Robbins said there is much improvement in the 
colt's strained right knee, which he probably injured while winning the 
Hollywood Futurity last December. However, Robbins said King Glorious should 
not run in the Derby May 6. 
</P>
<P>
"His knee is super and the progress is very encouraging," Robbins said. "But 
the horse should have at least 30 more days of light training, and the Derby 
will come up too quick to get him ready for a mile and a quarter. Go easy with 
him now and he'll be ready for those midsummer races for 3-year- olds." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Hollendorfer, who trains King Glorious, would like to re-evaluate the 
horse's condition after a month of walking and jogging, before deciding the 
horse's chances. Hollendorfer is even hopeful of running King Glorious at the 
Golden Gate Fields meeting, which is highlighted by the California Derby April 
22. 
</P>
<P>
"The X-rays showed a noticeable improvement in the problem area," Hollendorfer 
said. "The horse has been doing great. There's no filling (swelling) in the 
knee and it's been cold every day. Another month of the same thing he's been 
doing should tell us more. We're taking the conservative approach. If he needs 
extra time, we'll give it to him." 
</P>
<P>
King Glorious won all 5 of his races as a 2-year-old and finished second to 
Easy Goer in the voting for the country's top juvenile colt. 
</P>
<P>
King Glorious ran erratically despite winning the Hollywood Futurity, then had 
swelling in the knee after a workout Dec. 24. A fever last summer prevented him 
from running in the Del Mar Futurity, and he didn't return to action until 
mid-November, a week after the Breeders' Cup.

EARLY START IS NOT NECESSARY FOR KENTUCKY DERBY HOPEFULS

<P>
Many of the early bulletins on the candidates for this year's Kentucky Derby 
have been negative. 
</P>
<P>
King Glorious is hurt, and sidelined indefinitely. Is It True underwent knee 
surgery, as did Fast Play. Winners Laugh looks like no more than a sprinter. 
Houston is in exile. Rob an Plunder can beat only second-rate horses. Great 
Genes is dead, even though a future book in Las Vegas keeps taking bets on him. 
</P>
<P>
The best healthy 3-year-old in California is To Be Announced. The second best 
3-year-old in Florida is Could Be Anyone. 
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer, last year's champion 2-year-old, has avoided the ill winds, safely 
stabled at Florida's Gulfstream Park, where his 3-year-old campaign has 
consisted of 2 workouts. Easy Goer is not scheduled to run until March 4, in a 
7-furlong race at Gulfstream. 
</P>
<P>
But what's right for Easy Goer has been right for many of the Kentucky Derby 
winners in the last 20 years. Since 1969, only 6 of the 20 Derby winners made 
their 3-year-old debuts as early as January. Nine of the winners first raced in 
March of their victorious years, and five others didn't get started until 
February. 
</P>
<P>
It's not even necessary for a Kentucky Derby champion to win his first race as 
a 3-year-old. In the 1980s, only 4 Derby winners -- Swale, Sunny's Halo and the 
2 fillies, Winning Colors and Genuine Risk -- started off their years with 
victories. Alysheba and Gato Del Sol were winless as 3-year-olds going into the 
Derby, although Alysheba finished first in the Blue Grass at Keeneland and was 
then disqualified for fouling another horse in the stretch.

</P>
<P>
Majestic Prince -- Jan. 7, Jan. 7 
</P>
<P>
The Kentucky Derby game has changed for trainers since 1974 -- the year 
Cannonade won -- because not only must they have their horses ready to run 1 
1/4 miles on the first Saturday of May, they must also have enough earnings for 
their horses to qualify to start if the field exceeds the 20-horse limit. 
</P>
<P>
"On one hand, you don't want to do too much with a horse, but on the other hand 
you've got to make sure you've got the purse money to get in," says trainer 
Charlie Whittingham, who won the Derby with Ferdinand in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence, whose sire, Halo, was represented in the Churchill Downs 
winner's circle by Sunny's Halo in 1983, is Whittingham's best 3-year-old. 
After running second to Houston at Hollywood Park on Dec. 3, Sunday Silence was 
on the shelf, but he resumed workouts at Santa Anita last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The 7-furlong Hutcheson, the stake that Swale and Spectacular Bid both used to 
launch their Kentucky Derby campaigns as 3-year-olds, will be run Saturday at 
Gulfstream. Tricky Creek, who won the Kentucky Jockey Club at Churchill Downs 
last November, is expected to run. 
</P>
<P>
Western Playboy, who ran second to Tricky Creek, is another probable for 
Saturday. With 129 horses eligible, the Hutcheson should draw a large field. 
</P>
<P>
Rusty Arnold, who trains Tricky Creek, plans to run him in the 1 1/16-mile 
Fountain of Youth Feb. 18 and then in the 1 1/8-mile Florida Derby March 4. 
Arnold has 3 other promising 3-year-olds -- Trapp Mountain, Traskwood and 
Harperstown -- in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
When Awe Inspiring won a 7-furlong allowance at Gulfstream Jan. 14, his jockey, 
Jose Santos, was impressed, or at least his agent was. 
</P>
<P>
"This horse might be something," said Frank Sanabria, the agent for the rider 
who will be at the Century Plaza Hotel to receive his 1988 Eclipse Award a week 
from Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Awe Inspiring won the first race of his life last September at Belmont Park, 
then 3 weeks later led early and faded to fourth on an off track. Coming back 
from a 3 1/2-month layoff at Gulfstream, the son of Slew o' Gold rallied from 7 
lengths off the pace to win by a half-length. 
</P>
<P>
Awe Inspiring is trained by Shug McGaughey, who also has Easy Goer. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Day, who rode Easy Goer to 4 victories and 2 seconds in 6 starts as a 
2-year-old, has won 3 Eclipse Awards in the 1980s, but is 0 for 6 in the 
Kentucky Derby. Day got off Alysheba a race before the Derby in 1987, opening 
the mount for Chris McCarron, and wound up on Demons Begone, the Derby favorite 
who hemorrhaged and didn't finish. 
</P>
<P>
Day said that one of the reasons he abandoned Alysheba was that he thought the 
horse had "second-itis." Alysheba, who will be formally named horse of the year 
for 1988 on Saturday during a ceremony at Santa Anita, had won only once going 
into the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
If Easy Goer makes it to the Derby, he will give Day his second favorite there 
in 3 years. Last year, Day and Forty Niner just missed catching Winning Colors 
at the wire, finishing a neck short. 
</P>
<P>
"Easy Goer was second (to Is It True) in the Breeders' Cup, but I think he'll 
come back and vindicate himself," Day said. "He's right mentally and he's very 
mature for a young horse. My confidence in him hasn't diminished a bit." 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Double Quick, winner of the El Camino Real Derby at Bay Meadows, is headed for 
Oaklawn Park in Arkansas. Trainer Mel Stute is considering 3-year-old stakes in 
Arkansas, Kentucky, Oklahoma and Florida for the colt. . . . Mohamed Abdu is 
among a 5-horse Santa Anita contingent that will run Sunday in the $100,000 
Turf Paradise Handicap. Sandy Hawley will ride Mohamed Abdu, who will carry the 
high weight of 121 pounds in the 1 1/8-mile grass race. . . . Santa Anita, 
which has had only 8 grass races this season because of problems with the turf 
course, has a grass race scheduled for Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Corey Black, who rode Annoconnor to 3 stakes victories last year, has been 
replaced by Chris McCarron, in an owners' decision, for Saturday's $125,000 
Santa Maria Handicap at Santa Anita. Annoconnor will carry top weight of 122 
pounds. . . . Jockey Antonio Castanon, who had 2 victories in 51 mounts at 
Santa Anita going into this week, is moving to Oaklawn Park. . . . Johnny Campo 
is no longer training any of Thomas Mellon Evans' horses in the East. Campo, 
who won the Kentucky Derby in 1981 for Evans, trained Cherokee Colony, Pleasant 
Colony's son, for Evans before the colt was sent to Chris Speckert at Santa 
Anita and now he's the favorite for the Strub Stakes on Feb. 5. Evans' Florida 
trainer is Ross Pearce, who was successful with No Review before she became a 
stakes winner for Speckert.

SPORTS ET CETERA: HAWAII SHOCKS 14TH-RANKED SDSU WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Shooting just 28.2% in the second half, the 14th-ranked San Diego State women's 
basketball team was upset by Hawaii, 73-60, Wednesday night at Peterson Gym. 
</P>
<P>
The loss stopped a 9-game home winning streak for the Aztecs, who fell into a 
third-place tie at 5-2 with Nevada-Las Vegas in the Big West Conference. Hawaii 
(8-4, 4-1) moved into second place behind Long Beach State. 
</P>
<P>
"This is our biggest win ever," Hawaii Coach Vince Goo said. "This is the 
highest-ranking team we've ever beaten. It was a great, great team effort." 
</P>
<P>
Playing its eighth game of a 9-game trip, Hawaii rebounded from a 35-30 
halftime deficit. Tondi Redden made a 3-point shot with 11:50 to play to put 
Hawaii ahead to stay, 46-43. Hawaii then outscored SDSU, 30-14, the rest of the 
way. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State played without its second-leading scorer, Julie Evans, a 
starting guard who has the flu, and starting forward Stefanie Massie, who also 
was ill. 
</P>
<P>
Chana Perry had 27 points and 16 rebounds for SDSU, and Crystal Lee added 11 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Judy Mosley led Hawaii with 24 points, Ayesha Brooks had 21 and Redden 14. 
</P>
<P>
SOCKERS 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers, who are looking for a defender to replace recently retired Gary 
Etherington, may have found one in John Stollmeyer, an All-Star for the 
Cleveland Force last season. 
</P>
<P>
Stollmeyer, 25, is currently playing with the U.S. National Team. He told 
Socker Coach Ron Newman earlier this week that he was interested in joining the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
"He's interested in us, and we're interested in him," Newman said. "If 
something could be worked out with his national team schedule, he'd be a good 
bet to join us." 
</P>
<P>
Another national team player who could take Etherington's spot is former Socker 
forward Hugo Perez. Newman spoke with Perez last week, and the 1988 MISL 
Championship Series MVP told Newman he'd be interested in returning. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing is he was supposed to call me last Sunday, and he hasn't called 
yet," Newman said. CHRIS ELLO

PARIS IN TUNE WITH YSL'S HOT COUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAT McCOLL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
PARIS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The background music was by Marilyn Monroe, the clothes by Yves Saint Laurent. 
It was a sly combination that, for the first time during these spring-summer 
couture collections, had runway photographers ooh-la-la-ing and wolf whistling 
as models moved down the runway. 
</P>
<P>
Often in the past, Saint Laurent has used grand opera as background music for 
his couture shows. But since Pierre Berge -- chairman of Saint Laurent and also 
president of the Association des Theatres de l'Opera de Paris -- is currently 
involved in a war of wills with Daniel Barenboim, musical director of the new 
Bastille Opera, the Monroe music seemed a more neutral choice. 
</P>
<P>
Danielle Mitterrand, first lady of France, whose husband, French President 
Francois Mitterrand, appointed both Berge and Barenboim to their musical posts, 
had the seat of honor at the far end of the runway with Catherine Deneuve on 
one side and the Baroness Marie-Helene de Rothschild on the other. 
</P>
<P>
The first suits came out to the tune of "My Heart Belongs to Daddy," two of 
them classic pantsuit styles that Saint Laurent has made his signature -- but 
with the pants cropped well above the ankle. It's a look he introduced in his 
Rive Gauche ready-to-wear collection for spring. 
</P>
<P>
The third number down the runway couldn't have been more classic YSL: a navy 
wool crepe jacket with an above-the-knee navy skirt. When the model started to 
move, however, the skirt flashed open almost to the waistline, while the blouse 
under the jacket clung precariously to the shoulders before plummeting in a 
wide-open V to the waist. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sexy Trademark 
</P>
<P>
Jackets were tailored to look as if there was no blouse underneath, but there 
was always one of those bosom-baring beauties, often in a flash of red or pink 
to contrast with the more classic white, navy or black of the suits themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Skirt lengths rested firmly above-the-knee for day, with the slit ones more 
revealing than the shortest of minis. Accessories were kept to a minimum: big, 
flat earrings close to the head; perky small straw hats perched on the 
forehead; white kid gloves and linen shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Oversized buttons in mother-of-pearl, silver, rhinestone or gold were used 
almost as jewels to decorate jackets and skirts and to outline the seaming on 
another important day look, the easy chemise dresses. 
</P>
<P>
The chemises had the same new shoulder as Saint Laurent's jackets: less sharply 
defined than in the past but still wide, with fabric folded over in a flange 
for a looser, easier fit. 
</P>
<P>
Another Saint Laurent signature is the tuxedo, and as always, he included a 
group of them in this collection. This time around, tuxedo jackets were usually 
shown with short or long dresses in black or navy silk chiffon. 
</P>
<P>
Paris is chiffon-mad for spring, but Saint Laurent's way with it was the 
freshest and most directional: almost sporty-looking tank tops and skirts in 
sheerest chiffon, under gabardine smoking jackets. The chiffon skirts, like 
their daytime equivalents, were slashed up to sash-wrapped waistlines. For 
evening, jewelry was more in evidence: mother-of-pearl snails curled against 
the ear lobe; armloads of pearl and coral bracelets or oversized jeweled 
crosses balanced on those almost bare bosoms. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the collection, Saint Laurent spliced black, navy and white groups 
with bursts of color: A scoop-neck cardigan jacket was in tomato crepe above 
ruby satin pants, the blouse in aquamarine chiffon and the straw pancake hat in 
tangerine. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rich Decoration 
</P>
<P>
Another Saint Laurent specialty is extravagant embroidery -- some of the pieces 
in these groups sell for over $60,000. And extravagant is the only word for the 
gazar capes in red, violet, tangerine and turquoise, which were re-embroidered 
with bougainvillea vines. The capes were over the simplest chiffon beauties of 
the collection. 
</P>
<P>
Then, almost as the sherbet course in a too-rich banquet -- between these capes 
and a group of beaded matador jackets -- he slipped in two floor-length 
dresses, long-sleeved and completely covered up: one in tea rose pink, the 
other in black crepe. These brought down the house. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at the Hotel Maurice just across the street from the 
Intercontinental Hotel where Saint Laurent showed, Milan's Gianni Versace was 
putting the finishing touches on the small "Atelier" collection he will present 
at the Musee d'Orsay tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"Atelier as in 'workrooms,' " Versace said of the clothes that are hand-made in 
workrooms above his palatial Milan apartment. Each outfit is repeated only 
once, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Versace fans include Jane Fonda, who has just ordered 12, and Cher, who has 
picked out three from a trunk show Versace's sister, Donatella, held recently 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Prices average about $4,000 to $5,000 for a day dress, $20,000 to $30,000 for 
an embroidered evening dress. 
</P>
<P>
The collections conclude today with Givenchy and Rome's Valentino showing 
couture in Paris for the first time.

CROSSING THE LINE;

<P>
WHILE SERVING AS A LOMPOC GUARD, AN ANTHROPOLOGIST RECEIVES A LESSON IN A 
PECULIAR PERIL OF HIS PROFESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, Times Science Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mark Fleisher's epiphany came during an episode of "Hill Street Blues." 
</P>
<P>
A balding, bespectacled anthropologist at Washington State University, Fleisher 
was in his eighth month of field work at the Lompoc Federal Penitentiary, 
serving as a corrections officer or "hack" to study morale among other "hacks." 
That day, he had spent nine hours investigating the stabbing murder of an 
inmate named Juan. 
</P>
<P>
And when he watched a violent street killing on the television cop show, he 
suddenly realized he was growing bored. "Slowly it dawned on me that something 
in me had changed," he said. "When I began my work at Lompoc, I was anxious 
about getting involved in serious violence. Now I was afraid that Juan's death 
would be my only killing. What a shame that would be." 
</P>
<P>
Fleisher, 41, had crossed a line that many anthropologists have approached but 
that few admit having crossed: He had "gone native," adopting the attitudes of 
the people he was studying, to the point that his professional objectivity was 
lost. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Thorny Problem 
</P>
<P>
The possibility of going native has bedeviled anthropologists since the 1920s, 
when workers in the field first began partaking of their subjects' culture. It 
is a particularly thorny problem for anthropology. 
</P>
<P>
"The method that is characteristic of anthropology, and no other science, is 
participant observation," said Roy Rappoport of the University of Michigan, 
president of the American Anthropological Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"You not only observe, but to the extent that it is appropriate, you also 
participate in local activities," Rappoport said. "You try to learn how to do 
it as much as you can yourself. . . . What is involved here always, to some 
extent, is going native. You are attempting to get an inside view of the 
culture as well as an objective outside view. 
</P>
<P>
"That is not to say that this insider's view is more or less valid than the 
outsider's objective view. Both have validity, but they are different. The 
important thing is that you don't get them confused." 
</P>
<P>
"Mark was doing what any anthropologist would consider difficult field work," 
said anthropologist H. Russell Bernard of the University of Florida, who was 
Fleisher's mentor during graduate school. "When you do field work in your own 
culture, even if the people are radically different from anything you grew up 
with, they speak the same language, watch the same television shows, and so 
forth. It's difficult because you can become wrapped up in the local culture, 
very much involved in people's problems. You can lose your objectivity." 
</P>
<P>
Fleisher's flash of insight marked the start of a long, difficult process that 
included three solid days of discussions with his mentor and months of 
introspection. He ultimately recovered his professional demeanor and completed 
his study. But along the way, he gained some unusual insights into hacks and 
the men they watch over, and a fresh perspective on what has often been called 
one of the most violent institutions in the federal penal system. From that, 
and from the whole experience of "going native," has come his book, 
"Warehousing Violence," due out in February from Sage Publications. 
</P>
<P>
Fleisher began the prison project from a very personal approach. He had 
previously done his doctoral dissertation among the Salish Indians of the 
Northwest, "but my passion has always been prison studies. I spent many years 
studying women who married violent men, convicts" -- studies he is continuing 
now that his work at Lompoc is finished. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, he was hired by the U.S. Bureau of Prisons to study morale problems 
among correctional officers at Lompoc. He carried out the regular duties of 
supervising meals, supervising inmate groups and investigating violent acts 
while at the same time he studied the staff. 
</P>
<P>
"I was learning the job and, by being a regular staff member, I had access to 
channels of information that outsiders never have," he said. "For example, in 
the dining hall, you are standing there watching individuals being fed, making 
sure people aren't taking too many hamburgers or packages of sugar, and you 
hear correctional staff talk to prisoners and resolve problems." 
</P>
<P>
At first, only a few staff knew Fleisher's true purpose. "It was part of my 
job, my skill as an anthropologist, to develop rapport. And the way to develop 
rapport was by being there when the men were proving their mettle," such as 
during violent incidents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Did a Good Job 
</P>
<P>
"After I developed rapport, then I told them why I was there," he said. In 
general, he said, other hacks seemed to accept him because he was doing a good 
job and he kept his head in emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
"You're in an intimate relationship with these people where, indeed, what they 
say about violence and danger is true: You've got to trust the people you are 
around. And you begin to trust them, you begin to like them, to rely on them, 
and you begin to identify," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I began to think of myself as a correctional worker. . . . I began to answer 
my own research questions, as if I were a correctional worker. 'I work here. 
I've been trained. I have to deal with thugs, too. Why isn't my opinion as good 
as theirs?' 
</P>
<P>
"I defended the bureau to my neighbors and friends. I found myself becoming 
more aggressive with impolite convicts and, more than once, I caught myself 
giving them etiquette lessons." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Exploded' in Anger 
</P>
<P>
In one incident that particularly sticks in his mind, he "exploded" in anger at 
a convict who had startled him in his office, then subjected him to verbal 
abuse. "I should have paid attention to what he was saying, but instead I took 
it personally. . . . That was really outside my role as a researcher." 
</P>
<P>
And "somewhere along the way," he said, "I had gotten hooked on prison 
violence. That day (the day Juan was killed), March 6, 1986, a human being, a 
real person, was violently stabbed to death. I got to the scene just minutes 
after it happened . . . and I didn't care a bit about him." 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, the killing -- called an "incident" in Bureau of Prisons parlance 
-- "brought on Christmas-like joy in the prison," he said. "Moods were almost 
playful, as if someone had hung out a huge sign, reading: 'OK, everybody can 
take it easy for a while. We've had our killing for this month. No one else 
will die. . . .' This incident was terrific. It was my first killing, after 
all, and that is something that no one easily forgets." 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Juan died, Bernard came to Lompoc for a social visit and Fleisher 
started talking about his work. "He said, 'Hold on, wait, hold it!,' " Fleisher 
said. "'This is not your job. Your job is to play the role, but remain 
separate. . . . Your job is not to believe what people say. Your job is to 
listen to what people say, and then to do the research to see the difference 
between what people say and what they do.' " 
</P>
<P>
Bernard recalled: "When I found Mark, he was so much a sworn correctional 
officer that he was viewing the world from the perspective of a hack. It was 
threatening his ability to do the job." 
</P>
<P>
The pair spent three days talking through what Fleisher had learned. "I kept 
reminding him of his mission, his primary goal -- to understand and report 
accurately. . . . We went over all his notes and extracted places where he had 
gone over the line. By the end of three days, I was confident that we had 
pretty much solved the problem," Bernard said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A 'Clearer' Look 
</P>
<P>
After Bernard left, "I went back into the institution and things started 
looking a little clearer to me," Fleisher said. "But it took a while to 
distance myself." 
</P>
<P>
Fleisher also began writing about his experiences and that helped. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the classic problem (faced by) the field worker in anthropology. You go 
native. You think you are one. But you're not one. On the positive side, 
however, what I saw, what I felt, what I experienced, gives me insight into the 
operation of these places, and how men deal with each other, and how men feel 
about prison life and all these things most researchers don't have. Because no 
anthropologist has done this kind of project before. And damn few sociologists 
and criminologists have this kind of experience." 
</P>
<P>
But his conclusions about prison life and Lompoc can be summarized quickly.

"When I went into Lompoc, I was told (by colleagues and friends) that it was a 
violent, violent place -- one of the most violent penitentiaries in the federal 
prison system. As it turns out, it was the least violent. . . . What you find 
is that, in the world of penitentiaries, people always say that they are more 
violent and vile than they are. It's part of the folklore of the place." 
</P>
<P>
Fleisher's conclusions are confirmed by Lompoc warden Richard Rison, who called 
Fleisher "an extremely perceptive observer." Rison noted that Lompoc had only 
two serious assaults and two murders last year, even though 98% of the inmates 
are there because they committed violent crimes against people. The average 
sentence at Lompoc, Rison noted, is 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Risk Losing Jobs 
</P>
<P>
Lompoc is not violent, Fleisher said, because most of the inmates are working 
in prison industries and making good incomes, averaging $200 per month and 
going as high as $500 with overtime. They risk losing those jobs if they commit 
violent acts. 
</P>
<P>
And the morale problem among the hacks? It turned out, Fleisher said, that the 
bureau thought they had a morale problem because of a high turnover rate among 
the correctional officers, but what they really had, his report to the bureau 
noted, was an error in the way they calculated turnover. 
</P>
<P>
"They really didn't have much of a morale problem," he concluded. "I can assure 
you that guys who drive buses in Los Angeles live with a great deal more stress 
than most guys who work on a correctional staff."

IT'S DECISION TIME FOR PREP FOOTBALL SENIORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
John Morton and Howard McCowan have never met or crossed paths on the football 
field, yet they share the same recruiting story. 
</P>
<P>
Morton, a swift wide receiver from South Torrance High, and McCowan, a 
hard-hitting safety from Carson High, are two of the Southland's blue-chip 
college prospects. Both are gifted athletes, good students and come from 
supportive families. 
</P>
<P>
And both want to play for USC. 
</P>
<P>
Morton and McCowan know that now, but they came to that realization only after 
exploring their options. Both gave USC verbal commitments, then reconsidered 
and visited other colleges. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to see if I had made the right decision," said McCowan, who took an 
additional visit to UCLA. "(USC Coach) Larry Smith didn't want me to, but the 
other (USC) coaches felt it was a good idea." 
</P>
<P>
Morton visited Washington and Stanford after giving USC a non-binding verbal 
commitment. Prep seniors can officially commit to a college beginning Feb. 8, 
the first day of the national letter-of-intent signing period. 
</P>
<P>
"I had second thoughts," Morton said. "I wanted to go (to USC), but I wanted to 
take other trips and see how it went." 
</P>
<P>
After seeing if the grass was greener somewhere else, Morton and McCowan have 
both decided to sign with USC. 
</P>
<P>
But their stories demonstrate the difficult decision many seniors face in 
choosing a college. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always been hard for kids to say no," Carson Coach Gene Vollnogle said. 
</P>
<P>
Several area standouts have told colleges Yes. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
Serra linebacker Erik Simien gave a verbal commitment to Notre Dame, then took 
trips to UCLA, Alabama and Penn State. "I had already decided (on Notre Dame)," 
he said. "No other school compared." 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne quarterback Curtis Conway committed to USC in November, but he plans 
to take a trip to Texas next week. His future is further clouded because he has 
not scored 700 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT), needed to be eligible as 
a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
Carson running back Errol Sapp, the L.A. City 4-A Player of the Year, gave 
Arizona a commitment Tuesday, choosing the Wildcats over Oregon. Like Conway, 
he needs a 700 score on the SAT. 
</P>
<P>
Banning offensive lineman Andy Gonzalez was leaning toward Colorado but did an 
about-face after visiting UC Berkeley last weekend. He will sign with the 
Golden Bears. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes quarterback David Walsh canceled trips to Texas A&amp;M and 
Colorado because he decided on Arizona State after a visit to Tempe. 
</P>
<P>
San Pedro defensive lineman David Samperio, the school's most heavily recruited 
player in several years, picked Colorado over Arizona State and Texas-El Paso. 
</P>
<P>
It should be stressed that verbal commitments are not official. If a player 
changes his mind and signs with another school, he can do so without penalty or 
recourse from a college. 
</P>
<P>
While that's unlikely, the possibility worries recruiters. 
</P>
<P>
"An oral commitment, at least from what a lot of recruiting coordinators have 
told me, is a scary commitment," said Allen Wallace, publisher of Super Prep, a 
Costa Mesa magazine that specializes in football recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't treat a kid just as special as when he walked in the room, you 
run the risk of someone coming along and making a pitch for him." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, high school players can be fickle. 
</P>
<P>
Take Banning's Bob Whitfield, for example. The 6-7, 275-pound offensive tackle, 
rated the No. 1 prospect on the West Coast at any position by Super Prep, has 
kept recruiters guessing by changing his campus visits. 
</P>
<P>
Whitfield recently substituted UCLA and Stanford for planned trips to Alabama 
and Georgia. He will decide among Michigan, Notre Dame, UCLA and Stanford. He 
also visited Miami. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great case of recruiting turnaround," Wallace said of Whitfield. "In 
talking to him over the last three months, never in my wildest dreams did I 
think he'd end up anywhere other than Michigan or Notre Dame." 
</P>
<P>
While UCLA may still be a long shot, Stanford has definitely jumped in the 
running for Whitfield since Dennis Green was named head coach. Green visited 
Whitfield's home last week, and the brainy lineman (1,010 SAT) will reciprocate 
this weekend by making Stanford his final recruiting trip. 
</P>
<P>
John Becker, Banning recruiting coordinator, doesn't expect Whitfield to make a 
decision until the signing period. 
</P>
<P>
Simien, Serra's All-Southern Section linebacker, was just the opposite. He knew 
almost from the minute he walked onto Notre Dame's campus that he wanted to 
become part of the Fighting Irish tradition. 
</P>
<P>
"I like it because it's different," he said. "I like the athletics, the 
academics and the area. I wanted to get out of L.A." 
</P>
<P>
At Notre Dame he met linebacker Arnold Ale, a freshman from Carson who earned a 
starting spot on the national championship team. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked to him while I was there, and he likes it," Simien said. "He said the 
only thing you have to get used to is the cold. Other than that, it's a great 
place." 
</P>
<P>
As usual, Banning and Carson dominate the list of South Bay prospects. 
</P>
<P>
Becker said at least nine Banning players will sign with four-year schools, 
including three with San Diego State -- linemen Carlson Leomiti and Tom 
Siufanua and defensive back Eric Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Carson appears to have eight solid prospects. One is All-City offensive lineman 
Morris Unutoa, who has visited Brigham Young and Arizona and still has trips to 
Hawaii and Nebraska. Unutoa needs to take the SAT again after scoring 690 on 
his first attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Carson defensive back Greg Lindsey, who has visited Colorado, Alabama and Iowa, 
also needs to take the SAT. 
</P>
<P>
USC and UC Berkeley have each garnered three verbal commitments from South Bay 
players. Morton, McCowan and Conway have committed to the Trojans, while 
Berkeley has nabbed Gonzalez, Carson quarterback Perry Klein and St. Bernard 
defensive back Darryl Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona, which landed one of the area's top players in Sapp, is in the running 
for Unutoa and linebackers Terrell Edwards of Morningside and Doug Nelson of 
St. Bernard. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona State beat out Texas for Walsh, a 6-4 left-hander who was one of the 
area's top passers last fall, and is competing with Washington State for 
Banning safety Paul Montgomery. 
</P>

STATWATCH: CALDERON CATCHES FIRE FROM 3-POINT RANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Burroughs junior point guard Marnie Calderon is making a point of shooting from 
3-point territory. 
</P>
<P>
Calderon (5-foot-8, 130 pounds) has made 36 of 73 shots (49.3%) from behind the 
19-foot, 9-inch line, including 16 in 5 league games and 20 in the past 6 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Calderon, who averages 11.9 points a game, twice has made 4 3-point baskets in 
a game. 
</P>
<P>
"He's really come on," Coach Ira Sollod said. "He was only a fair shooter last 
year. This year, he's really confident; 18, 19 feet, he's pretty tough." 
</P>
<P>
Scoring: Hart's Micah Ohlman is shooting 44% (18 of 41) from 3-point territory. 
Ohlman also is Hart's leading free-throw shooter (76%). . . . J. P. Ouellette, 
Royal's leading scorer at 19.1 points a game, broke out of a season-long 
shooting slump Friday in the Highlanders' 59-58 win over Thousand Oaks. After 
making just 37% of his field-goal attempts in the first 17 games, Ouellette 
scored 28 points on 9-of-13 shooting. He made 4 of 5 3-point shots and 6 of 6 
free throws and also had 6 assists. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley has made 45.5% of its field-goal attempts but has improved that 
mark to 48.4% in Marmonte League play. A reason is the accuracy of center Mike 
Wawryk and forward Dennis Cook. Wawryk has made 26 of 37 shots against league 
opponents and Cook has made 15 of 20. Jeff Marciano's game against Camarillo 
last week didn't hurt the percentage. The senior guard made 9 of 11 field-goal 
attempts, including both tries from 3-point land, and 8 of 9 free throws en 
route to 28 points. The Pioneers made 21 of 37 field-goal attempts and 25 of 30 
free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Records: The Brent Lofton countdown continues at El Camino Real. The senior 
forward now has 809 career points, 15 shy of Sean Davis' record of 824. 
Assistant Jeff Davis says that he cannot help looking beyond that mark, too. 
"If we stick around long enough in the playoffs, he could reach 1,000," Jeff 
Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
With victories against Sylmar and Van Nuys last week, Reseda (6-8, 4-1) has won 
more league games this season than in the previous 2 combined. Playing in the 
Valley 4-A League, Reseda had a combined league record of 3-21 the past 2 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Channel Islands has lost 10 consecutive basketball games, including its first 6 
Marmonte games. 
</P>
<P>
Extra points: Reseda's Coley Kyman is averaging 10.2 rebounds a game, but he 
has 58 rebounds in the past 4 games for an average of 14.5. . . . El Camino 
Real senior center Jason Steele blocked 5 shots in the first quarter of 
Friday's game against San Fernando and has 37 this season (3.1 average).

SHOPPING FOR EMERGENCY AIR FARES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SIMROSS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since 1978, when domestic airlines were deregulated, wise consumers have 
learned to shop around for savings on airfares. But -- something most travelers 
don't know -- if you had a sudden medical emergency or death in the family, 
would the airline consider waiving a fare restriction for you? 
</P>
<P>
Some will, some won't. 
</P>
<P>
An informal survey of major carriers reveals that those who will waive 
restrictions in an emergency situation -- so you can get a cheaper ticket -- do 
so on an individual basis. And the emergency must pertain to the immediate 
family: father, mother, son, daughter, husband or wife. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a Los Angeles woman recently needed to fly to the Midwest for her 
mother's funeral, and couldn't wait seven days in order to get a discount 
ticket. The regular fare was $998; the economy one, $418. 
</P>
<P>
A reservations supervisor agreed to waive the seven-day restriction and give 
the passenger the discounted rate. The airline ticket agent verified the death 
by checking with the funeral home in Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have a blanket policy on emergency fares or a death emergency, but a 
reservations supervisor can authorize the waiving of restrictions," said Sara 
Dornacker, media relations manager for United Airlines in Chicago. "Depending 
on the circumstances, exceptions can be made on a case-by-case basis. But it 
has to be a management decision." 
</P>
<P>
Dornacker said that if the airline ticket agent does not inquire about the 
reason for the passenger's emergency, the passenger should tell the agent and 
have him or her check with a supervisor to see if fare restrictions might be 
waived. 
</P>
<P>
"If people have verification that they do have a medical emergency, or death in 
their family, then we will go ahead and accommodate them if we can," said 
American's Al Becker, managing director of external communications in Dallas. 
"We try to be as flexible as we can." 
</P>
<P>
American also offers passengers a 40% discount on a normal coach fare if they 
are traveling with human remains; United offers a discounted fare in that 
situation, too. Called a YRHR fare, it varies depending on where you are 
flying. 
</P>
<P>
All airlines who will waive fare restrictions insist on verification of the 
emergency, just as they do if you have one of their non-refundable tickets and 
cannot use it because of illness or a death in your family. In that case, they 
require a letter from a doctor stating your illness, or a copy of your 
relative's death certificate or a newspaper obituary notice. 
</P>
<P>
Airlines spokesmen note that some people have tried to get lower rate fares by 
lying about a death in their family. 
</P>
<P>
"But the vast majority of people are honest and reputable and want to do the 
right thing, so we try to accommodate them," American's Becker said. 
</P>
<P>
If a person traveling on a death emergency has his or her initial flight 
canceled, both United and American will give that passenger priority standing 
on another flight. 
</P>
<P>
"They just have to let the customer service representative know they're 
traveling on a death emergency," United's Dornacker said. "We do the same for 
unaccompanied minors and disabled people." 
</P>
<P>
TWA's Don Morrison in St. Louis said: "We have no general policy as far as 
waiving restrictions. That would be a difficult policy to manage and to 
administrate. But from time to time, it does occur on a case-by-case basis. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We Help Out' 
</P>
<P>
"We have had situations in the past where we've helped with the transportation 
for a patient who needs a kidney transplant or bone marrow transplant and the 
family is drained of their normal funds. Often a community group assists in 
raising money. And we help out." 
</P>
<P>
Alaska Airlines, on the other hand, waives no fare restrictions for any 
unticketed passengers. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're unticketed, there is nothing that is available from the airline in 
an emergency situation," said Tim Orkins, director of consumer affairs for 
Alaska Airlines in Seattle. "Probably 5% of anyone traveling does so on an 
unforeseen need of a personal nature. And that kind of program would be 
impossible to administer. The airline would have to determine an individual's 
financial need and we wouldn't have the time on such short notification." 
</P>
<P>
However, in the reverse situation -- if you have a non-refundable, discounted 
ticket and can't take the flight because of a medical emergency to yourself, 
traveling companion or immediate family, or a death in your immediate family -- 
Alaska Airlines will refund your money if you provide documentation of the 
illness or death. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Alternative Assistance 
</P>
<P>
And although Alaska Airlines does not waive fare restrictions for passengers 
without tickets, it does, Orkins said, "make contributions -- cash, free 
transportation, waivers of restricted fares -- through various charitable or 
nonprofit organizations. 
</P>
<P>
"That way the different groups can do the screening (of passengers who need 
assistance with fares)," Orkins added. 
</P>
<P>
Among the groups to which Alaska Airlines contributes are Ronald McDonald 
House, Air Lifeline and Travelers Aid. 
</P>
<P>
Travelers Aid, which has offices at major airports and assists travelers in 
dire need, does not assist travelers in negotiating with airlines for fare 
reductions or in getting money in case of a family death emergency, according 
to Susan Edelstein of the Los Angeles International Airport office. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of overseas air carriers and the waiving of fare restrictions in 
medical or death emergencies, the rules cannot be bent so easily, according to 
Joe Zucker, public relations manager for Lufthansa in the Western U. S. region. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Easing of Restrictions Seen 
</P>
<P>
"It's completely different than in the U.S. We're not deregulated and the rules 
are still pretty strict," Zucker explained. He added, however, that increasing 
"liberalization" in the Common Market area of Europe should result in some 
easing of airline restrictions by as early as 1992. 
</P>
<P>
But for now Zucker said that most international carriers are owned by their 
governments, and follow "the common safety standards, fare restrictions, rules 
and regulations of the IATA, International Air Transport Assn," which Zucker 
called "the U.N. of the airline business." 
</P>
<P>
However, Lufthansa might do some waiving of restrictions if a passenger who 
already has a ticket has a medical or death emergency, Zucker said. 
</P>
<P>
"If a person was here and had a death in the family . . . they might waive the 
restrictions without a penalty," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"In such a terrific emergency, we might work with the passenger's travel agent 
and make some agreement," Zucker continued. "We have agents appointed to 
represent us. If the travel agent knows a passenger, in some cases we might 
work with the agent as an intermediary. But we're not likely to do something 
for a stranger just coming in off the street." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Contact Travel Agent 
</P>
<P>
If you have a medical or death emergency and are flying Pan American either 
domestically or internationally, Pan Am's Klaus Hofmeister also suggests that 
you contact a travel agent and let him or her try to make arrangements for you. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many rules and so many fares, we suggest they go through the 
travel agent," said Hofmeister, assistant manager of sales for Pan Am in Los 
Angeles. "If it's a bona-fide death emergency, we try to deal with it. The same 
applies to non-refundables in the case of illness or death. We want a doctor's 
letter or documentation. What's usually involved in these situations is 
ticketing time limits, how long they are and the reason they need to be 
waived."

UCSB PROFESSOR EDGAR BOWERS WINS BOLLINGEN POETRY PRIZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Edgar Bowers, a poet and professor of English at UC Santa Barbara, has been 
awarded the Bollingen Prize in Poetry at Yale University. The prize, 
established at the Yale library by the Bollingen Foundation in 1949, is given 
every two years to one or more living American poets for the best collection 
published during that period or a body of poetry extending over several years. 
The honor includes a cash award of $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
Bowers is the author of books of poetry including "A Form of Loss" (1956), "The 
Astronomers" (1965) and "Living Together: New and Selected Poems" (1973). His 
new collection, "For Louis Pasteur," will be published this fall by Princeton 
University Press.

<P>
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. today reported the first annual loss in 
its 103-year history due to a huge accounting charge to write down the value of 
obsolete equipment. Underlying earnings actually strengthened for the telephone 
giant. 
</P>
<P>
The company reported a net loss of $1.67 billion for last year after a profit 
of $2.04 billion in 1987. Its revenues rose 4.3% to $35.21 billion from $33.77 
billion. In the fourth quarter, its loss was $3.34 billion, compared with a 
profit of $498 million in 1987. Revenues rose 6.4% to $9.21 billion from $8.65 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
Without the net charge of $3.94 billion, AT&amp;T would have earned $2.27 
billion for the year and $593 million in the quarter, a gain of 19% over the 
prior year's final quarter.

Two gunmen opened fire into a crowd of students this afternoon outside a high 
school in an affluent neighborhood of the District of Columbia, wounding four 
people, including a 16-year-old boy who was shot in the face, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred at 2:25 p.m. at Woodrow Wilson High School in the city's 
northwest section just as hundreds of students were leaving the school, police 
said. Students scattered from the site in terror as the two gunmen opened fire. 
</P>
<P>
WUSA-TV reported that between seven and nine shots were fired from an automatic 
weapon in rapid succession into the crowd of students.

A 73-year-old man was found dead in a garbage can on his front porch, where 
police believe he had been stuck for three days while waving for help. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Hamm waved to a mailman and a newspaper carrier while in the trash can 
earlier this week but may have been too weak to alert them that he was stuck, 
police said today. 
</P>
<P>
"I would imagine he was trying to signal something, but his expression or 
whatever wasn't enough to get them to do anything about it," Sgt. R. J. Liepins 
said. "They all feel very bad." 
</P>
<P>
The 11-year-old newspaper carrier, who had waved back to Hamm on Monday, found 
that he was dead on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Hamm, who was of medium height and build, apparently fell backward into the 
standard-size metal trash can on his enclosed porch and couldn't get out, 
Liepins said. He was found in the can up to his armpits, with his legs sticking 
out. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the mail carrier saw Hamm in the can from outside the porch and saw 
his hand move, Liepins said. "He thought something was funny . . . but he just 
let it pass," Liepins said.

MORE MONEY NEEDED TO CLOSE AILING S&amp;LS, CONGRESS PANEL TOLD

<P>
The top federal savings and loan regulator said today that unless Congress and 
the Administration come up with more money to resolve the industry's crisis, 
his agency may have to leave hundreds of insolvent institutions open. 
</P>
<P>
"The legislative failure to provide additional resources in a timely fashion 
would place the (Federal Home Loan) Bank Board in a position where there is no 
other option but to cease case resolutions," M. Danny Wall, chairman of the 
bank board, told the House Budget Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The bank board last year spent $38 billion to close insolvent institutions or 
merge them with healthier partners. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$2.5 Billion a Year Losses 
</P>
<P>
Wall estimated that insolvent savings and loans are losing $2.5 billion a year. 
The bank board has estimated that it will cost $45 billion to $50 billion to 
clean up the industry. Private estimates run to $100 billion or more. 
</P>
<P>
Wall said the bank board will provide an updated cost estimate, possibly next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
He said to "permit weak institutions to continue to deteriorate . . . would 
ultimately increase the cost of resolution." 
</P>
<P>
In separate testimony before the committee, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. 
Chairman L. William Seidman said FDIC funds should not be used to rescue 
insolvent thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be unfair to target banks to pay the cost of rescuing their 
competitors, the S&amp;L industry," Seidman said. 
</P>
<P>
The FDIC, which insures deposits at banks, has estimated the cost of 
recapitalizing the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., the branch of the 
FHLBB that insures thrifts against insolvency, could range between $80 billion 
and $105 billion, Seidman said. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, one way or another, the federal government will have to provide 
some of the funding to resolve the FSLIC problem either through use of its 
credit, revenues or user fees," Seidman said. 
</P>
<P>
Wall said it was unrealistic to expect the thrift industry to shoulder the 
entire burden of bailing out the remaining insolvent thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
He said any decision regarding additional funds for FSLIC should be made by the 
Bush Administration and by Congress. If significant amounts of cash became 
available, regulators could pursue several possible courses, Wall added. 
</P>
<P>
For example, he said it would be cheaper for FSLIC to purchase certain insured 
assets from buyers of insolvent thrifts and recognize the losses quickly rather 
than continue to pay an annual yield on the asset over the life of a rescue 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
In a second course of action, FSLIC could buy back some of its promissory 
notes, Wall said, noting that in some cases the interest that the fund pays is 
substantially higher than the income received on FSLIC investments. 
</P>
<P>
In another approach, additional cash for FSLIC would allow acquired 
institutions that have profit-sharing arrangements with FSLIC to pay off 
high-cost debt, which would improve their earnings and thus benefit FSLIC.

A mother was arraigned today on charges of drugging her 9-year-old son and 
forcing him and his 12-year-old sister into prostitution with as many as 80 
adults. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, police sought the children's grandmother, a 48-year-old Concord 
woman, on a warrant charging her with pandering in connection with the same 
case. 
</P>
<P>
Richmond Police Lt. Ray Howard said authorities believe the 29-year-old El 
Cerrito woman, who wasn't immediately identified by name in order to protect 
the children, used money collected for the sex acts to buy drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The children told police their mother gave them drugs such as marijuana, 
alcohol, sleeping pills, cocaine and methamphetamine in an effort to 
desensitize them to the sex acts, Howard said.

Pinky Lee, the baggy-pants vaudeville comic who starred in a children's TV show 
in the 1950s, was listed in serious condition today after suffering a heart 
attack backstage during a musical. 
</P>
<P>
Lee was resting comfortably and is expected to remain hospitalized for up to 14 
days, a St. Francis Medical Center spokeswoman said. Lee was stricken during a 
performance of "Sugar Babies" at the Peoria Civic Center Theater. The former 
burlesque comic, born Pincus Leff, starred in "The Pinky Lee Show" on NBC in 
1950 and 1954-56. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing a rolled-brim hat and a loud checkered coat, he danced, told stories 
and introduced himself by singing, "Hello, it's me. My name is Pinky Lee." 
Comeback attempts in the late 1950s and mid-'60s were unsuccessful.

The United States has given the go-ahead to the Soviet Union for buying more 
U.S. grain this year, including subsidized wheat, raising the possibility that 
total sales might exceed the record level of four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Department officials said Wednesday that the Soviets have been 
cleared to buy up to 20 million metric tons of grain in 1988-89, up from the 16 
million tons specified earlier. Purchases already total more than 12 million 
tons. 
</P>
<P>
The department also said the Soviets have bought an additional 150,000 tons of 
soybean meal, which has a potential current market value of about $36 million. 
</P>
<P>
Under a long-term grain agreement, the Soviet Union was originally limited to 
12 million tons of U.S. grain a year without further consultations with 
Washington, but that was increased to 16 million tons Dec. 23. The agreement 
had expired last Sept. 30 but was later extended.

Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy called today for a police investigation into 
an insider-trading scandal surrounding the takeover of New York-based Triangle 
Industries Inc. by Pechiney, a French state-owned firm. 
</P>
<P>
Signaling a change of tactics by the Socialist government, he said a legal 
inquiry was necessary whatever the outcome of an investigation by the COB, 
France's stock exchange watchdog. 
</P>
<P>
Beregovoy was answering questions from a parliamentary committee about the 
"Pechiney affair" in which government insiders are accused of exploiting 
confidential information to make large profits on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
"All the truth must be known. This affair, which is causing problems, will not 
be covered up," he told a public session. 
</P>
<P>
The inquiry was launched after a tip-off by the U.S. Securities and Exchange 
Commission over active trading in the shares of Triangle just before news of 
its purchase by Pechiney, an aluminum company.

The U.S. dollar fell against major currencies except the West German mark and 
Swiss franc in European trading today. Gold prices rose. 
</P>
<P>
There was a short-lived rally early in the day after news that U.S. durable 
goods buying surged 6.4% in December, when the expectation had been for a rise 
of 0.3%. 
</P>
<P>
But the dollar slipped again when details showed some of the gains were from 
large defense and transportation orders. 
</P>
<P>
No interventions by central banks selling dollars were reported but the threat 
of dollar sales was enough to restrain the market, dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the dollar fell to 127.52 Japanese yen from 127.65 late Wednesday. In 
London late today the dollar traded lower at 128.15 yen. The British pound rose 
to $1.7730 from $1.7710 late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Other late rates for the dollar today compared with Wednesday's late rates: 
1.8440 West German marks, up from 1.8435; 1.5671 Swiss francs, up from 1.5670; 
6.2705 French francs, down from 6.2715; 2.0815 Dutch guilders, down from 
2.0820; 1,350.25 Italian lire, down from 1,350.50; and 1.1816 Canadian dollars, 
down from 1.1840.

Gold Rises 
</P>
<P>
Gold bullion prices rose by about $1.50 a troy ounce in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The closing price in London and Zurich was a bid $405.75 a troy ounce, up from 
$404.25 in both cities Wednesday. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at $407.70 
bid, up from $406.57.

Silver bullion traded late in London at $6.19 bid a troy ounce, up from $6.12.

WALSH REPORTEDLY QUITS AS COACH OF 49ERS

Bill Walsh will give up the head coaching job of the Super Bowl champion San 
Francisco 49ers, published reports today said, and there were strong 
indications that he will be replaced by defensive coordinator George Seifert. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh, who reportedly will take another job in the organization, has supported 
Seifert as his replacement and Seifert reportedly cut short a trip to Cleveland 
to discuss the Browns coaching job and returned to San Francisco on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
A source told The Associated Press today that Cleveland was now leaning toward 
hiring New York Jets defensive coordinator Bud Carson. Browns owner Art Modell 
said he would meet with Carson tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the New York Daily News reported today that sources close to the 
situation said San Francisco owner Eddie DeBartolo Jr. wanted a high-profile 
coach like Jimmy Johnson of the University of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh, DeBartolo and their attorneys met Wednesday for two hours in the villa 
DeBartolo is occupying this week while playing in the Pebble Beach Pro-Am golf 
tournament, the San Francisco Examiner said today. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Comment 
</P>
<P>
Neither Walsh, DeBartolo nor Johnson, reportedly out of his office Wednesday on 
a recruiting trip, was available for comment. DeBartolo had said Tuesday that 
it may be three weeks before a final determination is made on Walsh's status. 
</P>
<P>
However, Miami Sports Information Director Rich Dalrymple, who said he spoke 
with Johnson today, quoted the coach as saying: "It's just a rumor. I have had 
no contact with the San Francisco 49ers." 
</P>
<P>
The San Jose Mercury News, citing a source close to the 49ers, reported today 
that Walsh has told his assistants that he will not return for an 11th season, 
but will remain with the team in the front office. 
</P>
<P>
The Examiner quoted 49ers Vice President and General Counsel Carmen Policy as 
saying a meeting of team officials would be held today -- after DeBartolo 
finishes his golf commitment. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Walsh definitely is leaving as coach and whether Seifert would be 
elevated to replace him, Policy on Wednesday night responded: "I can't say, but 
all parties are on the same page." 
</P>
<P>
Seifert, a leading candidate for the Cleveland Browns' vacant head coach 
position, was en route to Cleveland on Wednesday and booked a room in a hotel 
there. But after arriving in Dallas to change planes, he canceled the second 
leg of his trip and booked a return flight to San Francisco.

The University of Oklahoma booster who was banned from associating with the 
school's football program in the wake of a three-year NCAA probation is a 
convicted felon, according to a published report. 
</P>
<P>
The Daily Oklahoman reported in today's editions that William E. Lambert, 
president of H.T.S. Oilfield Services Inc. in Lindsay, had served time in 
federal prison for possessing stolen stock certificates. 
</P>
<P>
Lambert was convicted in 1969 for possession of $300,000 worth of stolen stock 
certificates, the Oklahoman reported. The certificates were part of $15 million 
in securities stolen from a New York airport a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Lambert told the newspaper he was not the same person convicted of that crime, 
but a comparison of the Social Security number Lambert has used in his oilfield 
business matched the number of the man sent to prison. 
</P>
<P>
Court files indicate Lambert was in federal prisons at Texarkana, Tex., and 
Springfield, Mo., the newspaper said, at least until 1971. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Gibbens, the school's faculty representative, and Athletic Director Donnie 
Duncan said they were unaware of Lambert's record. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Summer Job Allegations 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA placed Oklahoma on three years' probation last month. Among the 
alleged violations was one that some football players had received money from 
summer jobs without doing the work. 
</P>
<P>
Lambert was ordered to disassociate from Oklahoma's athletic programs for five 
years after the NCAA found he had provided a recruit with free use of a car and 
$6,400 for work the recruit never performed. 
</P>
<P>
Lambert said he employed 10 to 15 Sooner players and assistants per year for 15 
years. 
</P>
<P>
He said Oklahoma officials, on their own volition, asked him to stop hiring 
football players around 1984 or 1985, according to the Oklahoman.
