Real estate financier J. William Oldenburg and three former officers of a 
Utah-based savings and loan were indicted Friday for conspiracy to defraud the 
thrift of $26.5 million in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The federal grand jury indictment names Oldenburg, 50, former chairman and 
owner of State Savings &amp; Loan Assn. in Salt Lake City, as well as former 
thrift officers James Rossetti, 52; Nicholas L. Muccino, 59, and Martin L. 
Mandel, 44. 
</P>
<P>
Oldenburg, who has described himself as a self-made billionaire, owned the 
now-defunct Los Angeles Express of the United States Football League. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Firm Taken Over 
</P>
<P>
The Utah thrift was purchased by Oldenburg for $10.5 million but collapsed in 
1985 and he was sued by federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
The thrift was taken over by New Mexico-based Sandia Federal Savings &amp; 
Loan. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment charges that the men conspired to misapply $26.5 million in 
State's funds. It also charges them with fraud and lying to credit institutions 
in creating a real estate deal in which State Savings would buy a 363-acre 
development in Richmond, Calif., known as Park Glen Estates. 
</P>
<P>
The deal was allegedly to have State Savings, owned by Oldenburg, buy the Glen 
Park development from Oldenburg's solely owned Empire State West Inc., a 
Washington state corporation, by running the money through International 
Mortgage Services Inc., another Oldenburg enterprise in California. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment alleges the appraisals of the Park Glen project were highly 
inflated. 
</P>
<P>
Rossetti, a senior vice president of IMI and former president of State Savings 
between 1983 and 1984, was named in the alleged conspiracy along with Muccino, 
former senior vice president of IMI and on the board of the State Savings &amp; 
Loan, and Mandel, IMI senior vice president and corporate counsel between 1983 
and 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Mandel was also on the board of State Savings. 
</P>
<P>
The Utah thrift also had offices in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted on all counts, Oldenburg faces 42 years in prison and $44,000 in 
fines. The other three each face 40 years in prison, according to U.S. Attorney 
Joseph Russoniello. 
</P>
<P>
All four men are scheduled to surrender to a federal magistrate on Feb. 10. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called Deals Sound 
</P>
<P>
The short, stocky financier gained his success at IMI, which was a brokerage 
firm that found loans for developers. 
</P>
<P>
Oldenburg has been accused in the past of using the IMI firm to lure weak 
thrifts into highly speculative real estate developments while calling them 
sound. 
</P>
<P>
He bought the Utah savings and loan in Oct., 1983 but stepped down as chairman 
less than a year later, in June, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Nine days after he took control of the institution, his brokerage firms were 
paid $17.6 million in procurement fees for six highly speculative development 
projects, according to the suit by federal regulators in Utah. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment maintains that the conspiracy was between 1983 and 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Oldenburg nearly went broke in 1970 after a lender foreclosed on a big 
apartment project in Redmond, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
In 1974, he settled a civil lawsuit in federal court in Seattle in which the 
Securities and Exchange Commission accused him of defrauding limited partner 
investors in the project. 
</P>
<P>
He never admitted wrongdoing in the case.

GNP GROWS 3.8% IN '88, A 4-YEAR HIGH; RISE ONLY 2% IN QUARTER 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lingering effects of the summer drought held the nation's economic growth to an 
annual rate of 2% in the last three months of 1988, the Commerce Department 
said Friday, but growth for all of 1988 came in at 3.8%, the strongest in four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Without the drought, the government's advance estimate of fourth-quarter growth 
would have been 3.1%, and the year's expansion would have been 4.2% -- well 
above the 2.5% growth rate the Federal Reserve has set as an optimal target in 
its long-term fight against inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Without the distorting impact of the drought from economic data, the economy is 
expected to rebound at an artificially high annual rate during the current, 
January-March quarter -- perhaps as high as 5% or 5.5%, normally enough to 
spook the Fed into cracking down hard on short-term interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
But market economists were cheered by several signs in Friday's report that 
suggest that the economy is just as likely to enter a period of stable, gradual 
growth with moderating inflation, rather than the kind of hurry-up boom that 
cheers politicians but throws traders into panic. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street rallied on all fronts, with the Dow Jones industrial index 
advancing 31.79 points by the end of the day, to wind up at 2,322.86, its 
highest level since before the October, 1987, crash. 
</P>
<P>
The gross national product price index rose at an annual rate of 4% for the 
quarter, compared to 5.3% last summer and 5% last spring. This inflation 
measure wound up the year 4.6% higher, compared to a 3.6% advance the year 
before -- suggesting that inflation is indeed accelerating but not so fast as 
had been feared six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Friday's market cheer, perversely enough, derived from the fact that 
two bellwether indicators of industrial health -- net exports and capital 
investment -- turned soft in the quarter. Consumer spending and investment in 
housing were strong, however. 
</P>
<P>
There were indications that consumer spending, which the Fed and some 
government economists would like to dampen to enhance private saving and 
further diminish the trade deficit, is gradually stabilizing at a rate not much 
higher than overall economic growth. Personal savings increased at an annual 
rate of 4.6% in the fourth quarter and 4.2% for the year, after having slumped 
to 3.2% in 1987, the lowest in 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Overall, the economy, leaving out the drought, was expanding solidly but with 
a hint of softness in the business sector," said Allen Sinai, chief economist 
at Boston Co., in a fairly typical assessment. "That hint of softness conjures 
up an image of the soft landing the central bank (the Fed) is aiming for. But 
so far it's only a hint, and the jury is still out." 
</P>
<P>
One problem is that an important "hint of softness" took a form nobody 
welcomes: a worsened international trade picture for the second quarter in a 
row. Exports increased at a 2.8% annual rate, compared to 14.5% in the third 
quarter and 17.7% for all of 1988, clearly a declining trend. Imports increased 
at a 7% rate, not much off the 8.3% increase for the year. 
</P>
<P>
The huge surplus of imports over exports translated into a $6.8-billion decline 
in real net exports for the quarter, detracting from the $29.8-billion 
improvement in the deficit in traded goods and services for all of 1988, 
measured in inflation-adjusted 1982 dollars. In real terms, the trade deficit 
last year declined to $99.1 billion, compared to $128.9 billion in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
There was also a sharp decline in the last quarter in business investment, 
which had been booming since the beginning of the year. From October to 
December, investment fell at an annual rate of 3.7%, after strong increases of 
7.6%, 15% and 4% in the three previous quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Economists cautioned, however, that Friday's growth estimate was based on 
incomplete data for the quarter and almost certainly does not reflect a lasting 
slowdown in capital spending, noted David Wyss of Data Resources, Inc. of 
Lexington, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Wyss noted, the Commerce Department said in a separate report only 
Thursday that factory orders soared 6.4% in December and orders for 
non-military capital goods -- the key category for business investment, jumped 
an even more impressive 7.8%. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, one of the factors in the quarter's reported slowdown in gross 
private investment was a drop-off in accumulation of unsold inventory at the 
rate of $3.8 billion in 1982 dollars. 
</P>
<P>
An inventory slowdown, if modest and unaccompanied by a collapse in domestic 
consumption, is generally welcomed as a sign the economy is growing at a stable 
and sustainable rate. 
</P>
<P>
As for consumption, Wyss suggested, overall consumer spending for goods and 
services increased at an annual rate of 2.8%, compared to 3.9% last summer, 3% 
last spring and 4.5% in the first three months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Since real growth in the quarter was probably closer to the 3.1% it would have 
attained without drought effects, spending growth seems to have settled down to 
about the pace of growth in the economy at large.

AMERICAN AND DELTA MAY BLEND RESERVATION SYSTEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
American Airlines and Delta Airlines said Friday that they are involved in 
discussions to merge their computer reservation systems. The airlines said that 
if a transaction were concluded, they would establish an independent company to 
operate the system. 
</P>
<P>
American's computerized system, called Sabre, is already the largest of five 
U.S. computerized systems with more than 8,000 locations. Delta's system, 
called DATASII, is the smallest, with about 2,000 locations. 
</P>
<P>
Airline observers maintain that a computerized reservation system is one of the 
essential ingredients needed to survive in the deregulated airline environment. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the great disparity in size between American's and Delta's systems, 
"if money changes hands, it will flow from Delta to American," said Edmund S. 
Greenslet, publisher of the Airline Monitor, a monthly review of airline 
financial trends. "American is putting more into the pot than is Delta." 
</P>
<P>
He said a variety of studies have concluded that it was undesirable to have so 
much market power in the hands of just a few companies. The smaller airlines, 
as well as hotels and car rental companies, pay reservation fees ranging from 
$1 to $1.50 to the computer reservation systems. Both American and Delta charge 
$1.50 per transaction, according to a 1988 study by the Transportation 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
In terse, identically worded announcements both airlines said it is 
contemplated that the combined system initially would be owned 50% by American 
and 50% by Delta. The combined system would operate as an "autonomous" company, 
the airlines said. The airlines said they "contemplate" offering interests in 
the new system to others, including domestic and international carriers. 
</P>
<P>
Travel Weekly, a travel industry newspaper, reported on Friday that Lufthansa, 
the West Germany carrier, and Japan Air Lines, would invest in the new company. 
But a spokeswoman for Lufthansa said Friday that "we have not heard from 
Germany about that, so we cannot comment." A JAL spokesman said there was 
nothing to the reports. 
</P>
<P>
American said it had, in the past, spoken to others concerning joint computer 
reservation activities but that none of these discussions had resulted in an 
agreement. "Therefore, there can be no assurance that the proposed transaction 
can be accomplished on mutually agreeable terms." Both carriers said there 
would be no further word until there is an agreement or the discussions are 
broken off. 
</P>
<P>
The computer systems were started in the 1960s by airlines. Thereafter, 
attempts were made to launch some independent systems, but the government 
denied immunity from antitrust laws to allow discussions, and such efforts were 
dropped and the airlines' systems became giants. 
</P>
<P>
There is great value in the reservation systems. Two years ago, United Airlines 
sold half of Covia, the company that owns Apollo, to a group including some 
European carriers and USAir, for $500,000.

WORSHAM WILL RETIRE AS PRESIDENT OF DOUGLAS AIRCRAFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Douglas Aircraft President James E. Worsham, the hard-driving airplane salesman 
who is widely credited with the historic turnaround of McDonnell Douglas' 
commercial aircraft business in the 1980s, will step down May 1. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas named Robert H. Hood Jr. to succeed Worsham, who will turn 65 
in April and leave under the company's mandatory retirement policy. Worsham 
said in an interview Friday that he is considering a new job at McDonnell after 
he leaves Douglas, but declined to say what he might do. 
</P>
<P>
"I clearly do not want to retire," Worsham said. "I am blessed with excellent 
health and lots of energy. Another year (at Douglas) would have been great." 
</P>
<P>
Douglas teetered on the brink of closure in the 1982 when Worsham arrived from 
General Electric. Its sales were stalled and it was financially bleeding from 
efforts to develop several expensive new aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Seven years later, Worsham leaves Douglas with a military and commercial 
aircraft backlog at record levels and its operations solidly profitable. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Leaving as a Winner 
</P>
<P>
Douglas delivered 133 aircraft in 1988, took funded orders for 260 new aircraft 
and signed up options for 295 additional aircraft. Including orders and 
options, the company has potential future business in hand of more than $40 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a heck of a good year," Worsham, a native of Kentucky, said in his 
understated Southern drawl. "It's good to leave a winner." 
</P>
<P>
Worsham's own enthusiasm generates excitement about airplanes, and it is 
Douglas airplanes that give him his greatest sense of satisfaction, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Douglas airplanes are safe and reliable," said Worsham, a mechanical engineer. 
"They are structurally sound." 
</P>
<P>
Boeing is now facing increasing scrutiny of the structural integrity of its 
older aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
"We design ours to last a little longer," Worsham said. "We make them a little 
heavier. We go all out in corrosion resistance. We think that's the way to go. 
DC-3s, we think, will go forever. That's as far as I want to go. I don't want 
to throw any rocks at my competition." 
</P>
<P>
Hood is not well known at Douglas. In his current assignment, he is president 
of McDonnell Douglas Missile Systems Co., but has served there for only several 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Hood, 56, joined McDonnell in 1965 as a government sales representative in 
Washington. He later served as a bureaucrat at the space agency and then as an 
executive at Pullman Inc. He returned to McDonnell in 1982 as vice president at 
the first Astronautics unit. A former Air Force pilot, he has bachelor's 
degrees in engineering and business from the University of Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Hood's short tenure in his most recent job at a newly formed unit of McDonnell 
Douglas led some company managers to question Friday whether executives in St. 
Louis had recently altered their succession plans. 
</P>
<P>
Despite an unusually terse public announcement that Worsham would be stepping 
down as Douglas president, McDonnell Douglas Chairman John F. McDonnell praised 
Worsham to the staff. 
</P>
<P>
"Since 1982, Jim Worsham has been uniquely responsible for Douglas Aircraft 
Corp.'s tremendous turnaround," he said in a management bulletin. "From near 
extinction in 1983, Douglas has grown in sales from $1.9 billion to $4.9 
billion in 1988 and from a loss of $52 million to a profit of $127 million." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Big Jump in Profit 
</P>
<P>
Separately, the company reported Friday a large jump in profit that caught 
securities analysts by surprise. It earned $350 million on sales of $15.1 
billion in 1988, compared to earnings of $313 million on sales of $13.7 billion 
in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The company said earnings increased in all of its business segments, except for 
information systems, which lost more money than the year before. A sharp jump 
in profit at the company's military aircraft unit in St. Louis was primarily 
responsible for the increased profit. 
</P>
<P>
At the Douglas unit, pretax profit increased to $127 million from $108 million 
in 1987. But Douglas recorded $21 million in gains on aircraft lease 
conversions and lease sales in 1988, compared to $78 million in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Aircraft sales at Douglas soared to $4.88 billion in 1988 from $3.97 billion in 
1987.

WICKES TO SELL COLE, 3 MORE APPAREL UNITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Wickes Cos. said Friday it agreed to sell four apparel businesses, including 
Cole of California swimwear, to the New York investment firm Odyssey Partners 
for an undisclosed price. 
</P>
<P>
Wickes sold the businesses as part of a plan by its new owners to shrink the 
company. Wickes was acquired by WCI Holdings, a New York investment 
partnership, last October for $538.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Cole, Odyssey Partners is buying Catalina sportswear and swimwear, Mode 
O'Day women's shops and Colonial Corp. of America, a large maker of private 
label clothing. Cole and Catalina, both big names in swimwear, are based in the 
City of Industry. 
</P>
<P>
Odyssey Partners is a 7-year-old firm with interests in electronics and 
apparel. Last year, it was involved in a bidding war with West Point-Pepperell 
for textile maker J. P. Stevens. West Point-Pepperell eventually acquired 
Stevens for $1.22 billion, but sold Odyssey $530 million of Stevens' assets, 
including its carpet and industrial fabrics plants. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Founded by Actor 
</P>
<P>
Wickes said the proposed sale to Odyssey was subject to regulatory approval. 
Odyssey's owners, Jack Nash and Leon Levy, couldn't be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Cole, Catalina and Mode O'Day, which has headquarters in Burbank, employ 2,800 
workers. Colonial, a manufacturer of men's and women's private label clothing 
for large retail stores, including the Cheryl Tiegs sportswear line for Sears, 
is based in Miami and has all of its operations outside California. 
</P>
<P>
Cole of California was founded by Fred Cole, a B-movie actor, who was forced to 
join his family's underwear manufacturing business in the 1920s. He soon became 
restless and started to design woolen swimsuits with low backs and plunging 
necklines. His daring designs sparked a revolution in swimwear fashion. 
</P>
<P>
His daughter, Anne Cole, continues to design swimsuits for the firm and is best 
known for her classic tank suit designs. Cole of California sells about 4 
million suits a year and has sales of about $65 million. 
</P>
<P>
Wickes acquired Cole, Catalina and Colonial when it bought Kaiser-Roth Apparel 
in 1985. The companies had been for sale since October, 1987, when Wickes' 
previous management said it wanted to sell the businesses to help reduce the 
company's debt. 
</P>
<P>
When Wickes new owners took over the Santa Monica-based conglomerate, they 
decided to continue the search for a buyer for the apparel businesses.

APPEAL COURT RULING CLEARS WAY FOR CLOSING MENTAL HEALTH CLINICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICTOR MERINA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a stunning blow to Los Angeles County mental health advocates, a state Court 
of Appeal has ruled that county officials may proceed with the planned closures 
of eight mental health outpatient clinics and sharp cutbacks in service at five 
others. 
</P>
<P>
The appellate court, in a ruling county lawyers received Friday, sided with 
mental health officials who had argued they had no choice but to act against 
the clinics because of a shortage of money for mental health programs. 
</P>
<P>
The closures alone would affect more than 20,000 patients in clinics from the 
San Fernando Valley to the South Bay. The closures were scheduled to begin last 
summer, but lawyers representing half a dozen mental health patients obtained a 
Superior Court injunction in August blocking the move. But in the ruling, 
issued Thursday, the 2nd District State Court of Appeal dissolved that 
injunction. 
</P>
<P>
"This court appreciates (that) mental health services in many instances can be 
as vital as other forms of health care," the appellate court order said. 
"Unfortunately, there are insufficient funds available to meet all the 
perceived needs, requiring a prioritization of public expenditures." 
</P>
<P>
The court added that state law limits the county's mental health obligations 
and that any changes in that requirement should be enacted by the Legislature, 
not the courts. 
</P>
<P>
Because the decision cannot take effect until 30 days after the Jan. 26 ruling 
date, attorneys for both sides said the earliest the county can begin closing 
clinics will be at least a month plus an additional 10 days during which time 
an appeal can be filed. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the Court of Appeal reasoning is not consistent or logical, 
and we're going to seriously consider a petition of review with the California 
Supreme Court," said Melinda Bird, a staff attorney for the Western Center on 
Law and Poverty, one of the law firms representing indigent mentally ill 
patients in the court case. 
</P>
<P>
"If the clinics finally do close," Bird added, "we want to be sure that the 
procedures are fair and reasonable and that those who need services will 
continue to receive it." 
</P>
<P>
County officials have said that in closing the clinics, only those patients who 
are severely and chronically mentally ill will continue to receive treatment at 
county facilities. As a result, seriously mentally ill patients at clinics that 
are on the cut list would be assigned to other clinics which, in turn, could 
jettison patients who require less psychiatric attention. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the court ruling, mental health advocates said they fear such a 
ripple effect will not only undermine the mental health system but threaten 
patients who rely solely on the county for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Devastating Effect' 
</P>
<P>
"If the cuts go through with the magnitude they talked about last August, it 
will have a tragic and devastating effect on our clients," said Bryan Jones, 
director of public policy for the Mental Health Assn. of Los Angeles County, an 
umbrella organization for mental health patients, their family members and 
professionals. 
</P>
<P>
"I would hope that the supervisors could find some way to continue to provide 
the funding for mental health that would prevent further cuts," said Jones, who 
added that many patients forced to transfer to unfamiliar clinics would face 
long lines or difficult commutes for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
However, Roberto Quiroz, the county's mental health director, said Friday that 
his staff would immediately begin evaluating how to proceed with the clinic 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
"We're waiting for the county counsel to review the wording of the decision," 
Quiroz said. "We will be meeting with county counsel on Monday and then proceed 
with whatever decision we have to make." 
</P>
<P>
Quiroz said he hopes to make the cuts, which would also include layoffs, as 
painless as possible. "I think it's been a time of great uncertainty for staff, 
patients, administrators and board (of supervisors) and somewhere along the 
line we had to get a decision made, and this was a responsible decision," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Other county officials were not so sure. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Schettler, executive director of the San Pedro Mental Health Center, one 
of the threatened clinics, said while everyone was relieved that a decision had 
been made, his patients and staff are still in limbo. 
</P>
<P>
"We still don't know what the extent of the cuts will be, and we don't know how 
much curtailment of staff it will be," he said. (But) it's certainly clear that 
there's still going to be a tremendous impact on loss of services to the 
severely mentally ill and to the homeless mentally ill," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the San Pedro clinic, outpatient programs in Wilmington, 
South-Central Los Angeles, Arcadia, North Hollywood, Canoga Park, Bell Gardens 
and Carson are scheduled to close.

EX-DEA AGENT: IS FUGITIVE TEMPTING FATE IN L.A.? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM OVEREND and KENNETH J. GARCIA, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He is a man on the run -- a black belt karate champion described as "a man who 
could throw his gun away and rip your head off." 
</P>
<P>
But four months into an international manhunt -- with initial reports that he 
might have been headed for Spain or Mexico -- former federal drug agent Darnell 
Garcia has apparently chosen to run only as far as North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday both police and Garcia's former colleagues were asking why? 
</P>
<P>
The questions came as the manhunt -- at least for the moment -- shifted away 
from Europe and Latin America to a shabby neighborhood surrounding the 
intersection of Lankershim and Victory boulevards in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation's focus returned to Los Angeles when a Los Angeles Police 
Department officer said he recognized Garcia pretending to be on a stakeout 
Jan. 6 at the intersection. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia, sitting in a late model blue Ford LTD, reportedly flashed the officer a 
hand sign indicating he was a law enforcement officer and also showed a badge 
that looked like he was with either the DEA or the U.S. Customs Service. 
</P>
<P>
Police officials were baffled Friday at why he would appear to be tempting fate 
so blatantly. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia's friends and some of his former colleagues in the DEA were even more 
amazed. And some were openly skeptical that the man they knew as a street-wise 
and tough narcotics agent would ever make himself so vulnerable to capture. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe it," said Donald Hugh, one former DEA agent who worked with 
Garcia for years and supported him during a lengthy racial discrimination fight 
that preceded the current criminal case against Garcia and two other ex-agents. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, Darnell is not a stupid person," Hugh added. "I frankly can't guess 
where he is. But if he is still in town, he'd be like a U-Boat -- so far 
submerged he'd be off sonar. I can't believe he'd be driving around in cars and 
waving at policemen." 
</P>
<P>
Garcia, 42, was charged Nov. 22 along with two other former DEA agents -- John 
Jackson and Wayne Countryman -- with an alleged money-laundrying scheme. He 
eluded surveillance agents just eight hours before his pending arrest and has 
been a fugitive ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors say that additional charges involving large-scale cocaine 
dealing will also be filed in the case. 
</P>
<P>
The federal prosecutors who charged Garcia declared him a menace to potential 
witnesses in the case long ago, describing him as a world-class karate champion 
with deadly connections among drug dealers in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
They were blocked by a federal judge's gag order from any comment Friday on why 
Garcia, who had resigned from the DEA in August, 1987, may have chosen to 
remain in Los Angeles and what possibly could have lured him to North 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
But there was no restraining order on Los Angeles attorney Mark Borenstein, who 
successfully represented Garcia for years in a discrimination case against the 
DEA and who has argued that federal prosecutors have deliberately exaggerated 
Garcia's potential for violence. 
</P>
<P>
"I have thought that Darnell was here since the case started," Borenstein said. 
"He has his wife and his son here. . . . I just hope that he will come forward. 
This is kind of the last fight for him in a lot of fights against the DEA, and 
I think he can win it." 
</P>
<P>
Borenstein said he was not surprised by reports that Garcia had been spotted in 
Los Angeles, and he predicted that as soon as Garcia "believes he can get a 
fair bail hearing," he will surrender to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyer, now representing Garcia's wife in an effort to prevent the Internal 
Revenue Service from seizing their $581,000 home in Rancho Palos Verdes, added 
that he thinks one reason his former client remains a fugitive is the 
government's effort to seize all his assets as the illegal profit of alleged 
drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
While Borenstein expressed concern about Garcia's ability to raise bail, others 
spoke of the increasing danger he faces from Los Angeles law enforcement 
agencies because of the latest reports that he has been seen armed, possibly in 
search of witnesses who could testify against him. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds to me like they are setting the guy up for problems," said former 
agent Hugh. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Appeals for His Surrender 
</P>
<P>
Agreeing that Garcia faces increasing risks if he truly is running around Los 
Angeles passing himself off as an active DEA agent, former drug agent Tom 
Martin, who once supervised Garcia in Los Angeles, appealed to his ex-colleague 
to surrender. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the thing for Darnell to do is give serious consideration to getting 
with his attorney and turning himself in," said Martin, now a private 
investigator in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not smart enough to know what Darnell is thinking," said Martin. "My 
feeling is he probably is in fear of his life." 
</P>
<P>
Amid the speculation Friday, the intensity of local law enforcement's interest 
in capturing Garcia was revealed with dramatic force near the same intersection 
where Garcia was reportedly seen Jan. 6. 
</P>
<P>
At a bus stop near Lankershim and Victory, Hollywood resident Hugo Monzon 
Gonzales, approached by a Times reporter, identified a color photo of Garcia 
and said he was at that moment inside a nearby dance club called La Zona Rosa. 
</P>
<P>
Within minutes of the report, a dozen LAPD officers were on the scene and two 
police helicopters were hovering overhead. There was no Garcia to be found, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chameleon-Like Nature 
</P>
<P>
While still an area of interest to the agents hunting for him, Garcia's plush 
neighborhood in Rancho Palos Verdes was considerably more quiet, a reminder of 
the former DEA agent's chameleon-like nature. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia, his wife and his son lived in high-style in one of the semi-custom 
houses that adorn the Island View subdivision, high on a bluff overlooking the 
Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Borenstein said Garcia's wife, Adaline, continues to live in the house with 
their son. He said they are rarely seen because they spend much of their time 
with her mother nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Interviews with his neighbors Friday revealed a man occasionally outgoing and 
sometimes secretive. During conversations with neighbors, Garcia would 
sometimes tell them that he worked as a jeweler. Sometimes he wouldn't say 
anything at all. 
</P>
<P>
"He was always very nice to me," said neighbor Karol Plocky. 
</P>
<P>
About the only thing that stood out about Garcia, besides what neighbors called 
his "menacing" appearance, was that he seemed to have a tremendous amount of 
free time. A few neighbors noted that he spent a great deal of time in his 
house and wondered how he could afford to live in the neighborhood without 
working. Several said they were stunned when they found out he had been a DEA 
agent.

WALKOUTS AT SCHOOLS CALLED AT A 'CRISIS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH CONNELL and SAM ENRIQUEZ, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As sit-ins or walkouts hit 15 additional Los Angeles school district campuses 
in the ninth day of a widening student revolt, the political and administrative 
apparatus of the city's huge school district launched a series of new 
initiatives to respond to what the school board president termed a "crisis." 
</P>
<P>
Friday's protests involved an estimated 4,300 students -- the largest 
single-day total yet -- and included a dozen high schools and three junior high 
schools from Carson to Granada Hills and East Los Angeles to Venice. Most of 
the demonstrations continued to be peaceful, and no injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
However, the potential for the student-led protests to get out of hand was 
dramatized at San Fernando High School, where hundreds of students decided to 
march down the center of Laurel Canyon Boulevard. Some threw rocks and bottles 
at police who ordered them to return to school. Other protesting San Fernando 
High students swarmed en masse into a convenience store and stole items off the 
shelves. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Very Serious' 
</P>
<P>
"This is getting very serious. . . . I think we're reaching the crisis point," 
said school board President Roberta Weintraub. 
</P>
<P>
The dual theme of the protests, which are an outgrowth of a bitter labor 
dispute between the Los Angeles Unified School District and its teachers, 
remained the same. Students support teachers' demands for higher pay, but they 
want their official midyear grades filed with the district. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers, as a pressure tactic on the board, have threatened to withhold 
student grades from the district if a contract settlement is not reached by 
next Friday. Students would be able to obtain grades from teachers on 
unofficial, union report cards. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
College Admissions 
</P>
<P>
Despite assurances from teachers that students will not be affected by the 
action, many students, particularly high school seniors, are demanding that the 
grades be filed. They fear that they may be put at a disadvantage in the 
competition for college admissions if preparation of official midyear 
transcripts is delayed. 
</P>
<P>
A flurry of new efforts surfaced Friday to address the protests and the 
slow-moving contract negotiations that have been going on for almost a year. It 
was not clear, however, whether the efforts were producing actual progress 
toward halting the protests or resolving the underlying labor dispute between 
the school district and teachers. But they were clearly the result of the 
spreading student demonstrations and represented some of the most visible 
movement in weeks toward accelerated bar gaining. 
</P>
<P>
Three board members -- Warren Furutani, Julie Korenstein and Jackie Goldberg -- 
held a press conference to declare that it is time for around-the-clock 
bargaining between board members and leaders of United Teachers-Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Things have taken a decided turn for the worse," said Furutani, a Harbor-area 
representative. "We can't stand by while the situation continues to 
deteriorate." 
</P>
<P>
Union officials quickly endorsed the move. 
</P>
<P>
Furutani and Korenstein called for an emergency school board meeting and 
bargaining through the weekend, but late Friday, Weintraub said some board 
members were not available and the matter will not be taken up until the 
board's regular meeting Monday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Widespread Disbelief 
</P>
<P>
In another development, Weintraub, acknowledging widespread disbelief of the 
district's claim that it lacks the money to significantly improve its pay offer 
to teachers, called for an independent audit of the district's books. The 
auditor, she said, should be selected jointly by the school board and the 
teachers' union. The matter is expected to be taken up Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the protests, administration officials also said they plan in the 
coming days to make an unusual mass mailing to all parents in the district. The 
mailing, officials said, is expected to explain the district's position in 
negotiations and assure parents and students that the district will do 
everything possible to fulfill its legal obligations. 
</P>
<P>
But, in an effort to boost its side, district spokeswoman Diana Munatones said 
the letter may also warn that the district does not recognize the union report 
cards and that withholding of grades could harm some students. 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear Friday whether the student protest tactic of skipping homeroom 
period -- during which the official attendance is taken that determines state 
funding for the district -- was having a significant financial effect. The 
district loses $15 for each student not present. Homeroom attendance was down 
at some schools Friday, but officials had no estimate of the impact. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Appeal 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wayne Johnson, president of the teachers' union, issued a new appeal 
for students to stay in class and stop the walkouts, "because they are not 
accomplishing anything." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson also sought to place responsibility for the protests on Supt. Leonard 
Britton, who he accused of being "very irresponsible" earlier this week. 
Britton, in well-publicized remarks, warned that some college-bound students 
could be harmed if grades are not filed with school offices. 
</P>
<P>
The union insists that no harm will result and that grades will be forwarded to 
college admissions officials. Johnson said if the teachers capitulate on the 
grade issue, the only collective-bargaining tactic left would be a strike. 
</P>
<P>
But board member Alan Gershman insisted that the contract and the grades are 
separate issues and the key to ending the protests is release of the grades. 
</P>
<P>
"There would be no more problem if the teachers do what they are supposed to 
do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WHERE THEY STAND 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SALARY INCREASES 
</P>
<P>
BOARD: 6% increase first year at a cost of $69 million, 5.2% in each of the 
second and third years, more if additional state funds are available. Estimated 
total cost is $420 million. 
</P>
<P>
TEACHERS:12% first year. Estimated cost is $138 million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TERM OF CONTRACT 
</P>
<P>
BOARD: Three years. School board says it needs extended period of labor peace 
to work on improving educational quality. 
</P>
<P>
TEACHERS: One year. With passage of guaranteed school funding, teachers believe 
more funds may be available in coming years and do not want to agree to lower 
increases now. 
</P>
<P>
AVAILABLE MONEY 
</P>
<P>
BOARD: To go above the current offer will require cuts in a variety of 
administrative and curriculum-development programs that would eventually hurt 
students. 
</P>
<P>
TEACHERS: The district has plenty of money buried in its $3.5-billion budget to 
meet teacher pay requests. 
</P>
<P>
POWER SHARING 
</P>
<P>
BOARD: More decision-making authority over spending and instruction should be 
pushed down to the neighborhood school level. Teachers, parents and principal 
would share power on new school councils, but principal would have to agree 
with council before any changes are made. 
</P>
<P>
TEACHERS: The district should move ahead now with so-called school-based 
management. Decisions should be made by school councils, with teachers having a 
majority of voting positions and principals having no veto. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PREPARATION TIME AT GRADE SCHOOLS 
</P>
<P>
BOARD: Giving elementary school teachers paid preparation time during the 
school day would cost $82 million in the first year, and appears to be too 
costly. 
</P>
<P>
TEACHERS: Like junior and senior high teachers, elementary teachers need time 
set aside for instruction preparation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DOCKED PAY 
</P>
<P>
BOARD: There is no basis for paying teachers for duties they have not performed 
as part of their boycott of yard duty, parent conferences and other activities. 
</P>
<P>
TEACHERS: District is illegally withholding millions of dollars from teachers 
and every penny will have to be released before a settlement.

JUDGE ASKED TO LET RAIDERS DEAL PROCEED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Irwindale on Friday asked Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Charles 
E. Jones to lift his order blocking completion of final financial and 
contractual arrangements to build the proposed Raiders football stadium in the 
San Gabriel Valley community. 
</P>
<P>
A filing by Irwindale attorneys contended that in preparing and approving an 
environmental impact report on the stadium project, the city has fully complied 
with the terms of a September, 1987, court order. 
</P>
<P>
John Belcher, an attorney for Los Angeles City Councilman Ernani Bernardi, who 
brought the suit that resulted in the court issuing its temporary restraining 
order requiring a satisfactory environmental impact report, said Friday that 
his side has 10 days to contest the Irwindale filing but may decide not to do 
so. 
</P>
<P>
Should the court lift its order, Irwindale authorities will then try to secure 
financing and reach a satisfactory final deal with Los Angeles Raiders owner Al 
Davis for construction of the planned 62,500-seat stadium.

RESTAURANT OWNER SLAIN, WIFE WOUNDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A restaurateur was killed and his wife seriously injured in a shooting early 
Friday morning at the couple's Torrance home, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said they have no suspect and few clues in the shooting of 
William and Rosemary Deardorff, owners of Vince's Spaghetti Restaurant on 
Hawthorne Boulevard in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
The couple had returned Thursday from a vacation in Acapulco and were 
apparently asleep in their Elm Avenue home when an intruder entered their 
bedroom and shot them several times, Torrance Police Sgt. Ron Traber said. 
</P>
<P>
Rosemary Deardorff, 44, was able to call paramedics at 2:43 a.m. despite 
several gunshot wounds, Traber said. Her husband, 49, died at Torrance Memorial 
Hospital Medical Center a short time later. His wife was in fair condition and 
was scheduled to undergo surgery Friday afternoon at county Harbor-UCLA Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
Robbery apparently was not a motive in the attack, police said, noting that 
money and other valuables were found inside the home.

SLUMLORD SENTENCED TO HOUSE ARREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A convicted Los Angeles slumlord whom City Atty. James K. Hahn said has refused 
to repair "inhuman conditions" in his run-down hotel was ordered to spend 45 
days in the building under house arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Municipal Judge Carol Boas-Goodson imposed the sentence on Aaron G. 
Kempe, 63, of Beverly Hills after he admitted violating his probation from his 
conviction last year by failing to upgrade conditions at the Stratford Hotel at 
2629 W. 8th St. 
</P>
<P>
Kempe was fitted with an electronic monitoring device that will allow 
authorities to make sure he does not leave his first-floor room except for two 
hours each day -- one hour to supervise repair work at the hotel, and a second 
hour to attend religious services. 
</P>
<P>
Kempe was charged last March with maintaining slum conditions at the 
four-story, 93-unit brick hotel, including vermin infestation, defective 
bathrooms, broken windows, defective smoke detectors, faulty plumbing and 
damaged walls, floors and ceilings. 
</P>
<P>
Kempe is the third Los Angeles slumlord to be sentenced to house arrest in his 
own building.

POPE, U.S. CATHOLIC HIERARCHY TO TACKLE VATICAN RELATIONS IN MARCH

Pope John Paul II and the U.S. Catholic hierarchy, who sparred over the issue 
of church dissent during the pontiff's visit to Los Angeles in 1987, will 
tackle the volatile issue of U.S.-Vatican relations in a March meeting in Rome. 
</P>
<P>
More than 30 U.S. bishops and two Eastern Rite metropolitans have been invited 
to the March 8-11 meeting, which follows a year of private discussions with 
U.S. bishops, the United States Catholic Conference said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a good start in Los Angeles, and now we hope to make it a little more 
in-depth," said Archbishop John L. May of St. Louis, president of the National 
Conference of Catholic bishops. "He is very strong for the meeting. He wants to 
have it."

JEWISH GROUP BACKS TEACHING OF VALUES IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A leading American Jewish civil rights organization is endorsing the movement 
to teach values in public schools, claiming "moral relativism" represents a 
greater danger than the possibility of church-state abuses. 
</P>
<P>
The American Jewish Committee, overcoming fears that values education could be 
"a smoke screen for teaching religious precepts," has approved a report by a 
task force that encourages schools to define, teach "and put into action" 
values that are at the foundation of a democracy. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what happened over the last 20 years . . . was a certain kind of moral 
relativism did enter in. There was confusion about right and wrong," said 
Irving M. Levine, the committee's director of national affairs. "What you have 
now is a reinsertion of the ethno-cultural-religious traditions and an attempt 
to develop a consensus around those traditional values." 
</P>
<P>
A copy of the report, to be released next month, was obtained by the Associated 
Press. It is considered significant because of the past reluctance of many 
groups representing minority religions to enter into the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"The easiest thing to do is let's not touch it because it's too risky," said 
Arnold Gardner, vice president of the American Jewish Committee and chairman of 
the task force that wrote the report. "I think it's a natural evolution of our 
attitude and the ability to distinguish between matters of religious faith and 
shared values." 
</P>
<P>
The role of the public school in teaching values is coming under increasing 
scrutiny as educators and others debate the effect of "value-free education." 
In a 1986 speech that focused national attention on the issue, New York Gov. 
Mario Cuomo said, "When you get kids for eight years in an elementary school 
and you never say anything to them about values, I suspect what you're saying 
to them is there are no values." 
</P>
<P>
A panel of educators brought together by the Assn. of Supervision and 
Curriculum Development recommended in its final report last year "that schools 
define and teach a morality of justice, altruism, diligence and respect for 
human dignity." 
</P>
<P>
The National Council of Churches, representing mainline Protestant 
denominations, last year launched an experimental program for churches, schools 
and teacher-education colleges to help communities establish a consensus on 
values that should be taught. 
</P>
<P>
Churches and schools have "used the church-state separation principle as a 
reason to hide. That's turning around significantly," said Margaret L. Shafer 
of the council's Division on Church and Society. 
</P>
<P>
The Jewish committee's report said that in many cases, religious and civic 
values are identical. Among these are compassion, regard for human worth and 
dignity, integrity and justice. The report said a nonsectarian consensus can be 
reached on what values should be taught.

U.S., KREMLIN URGED TO UNITE IN TERROR FIGHT 
</P>

<P>
U.S. and Soviet terrorism experts urged Friday that the superpowers set up a 
joint group to promote cooperation in combatting international terrorism and 
that they help each other at the diplomatic, intelligence and technical levels. 
</P>
<P>
Completing their first bilateral talks with a comprehensive plan for concerted 
action, the group of 10 Soviets and 10 Americans also recommended a prohibition 
on the sale or transfer of military explosives and certain classes of weapons 
to non-governmental organizations as well as restrictions or tighter control on 
sales to other nations. 
</P>
<P>
Curbing such sales has long been of concern to the United States because many 
of the weapons used by terrorist groups come from East Bloc countries. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet and American specialists also called for joint efforts to prevent 
terrorists from acquiring chemical, biological, nuclear and other weapons of 
mass destruction and for joint exercises to improve cooperation during 
terrorist incidents. 
</P>
<P>
Nuclear terrorism, either in acquisition of nuclear capabilities or attacking 
nuclear facilities, has long been an important issue for the Soviets, while the 
United States has been concerned about the proliferation of chemical and 
biological weapons capabilities by Third World countries, notably Libya. 
</P>
<P>
The group suggested the "exchange of technology that may be useful in 
preventing or combatting terrorism . . . consistent with the national security 
interests as defined by each nation." 
</P>
<P>
The proposals, in a nine-point statement climaxing a five-day conference here, 
are the most far-reaching ever advanced on Soviet-American cooperation to 
combat terrorism. They particularly reflect the growing concern in Moscow about 
the international threats -- and thus the greater interest in joint efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Although the conference was organized by private Soviet citizens, current and 
former government officials spoke at the session. And the conference in general 
was officially sanctioned "at the highest levels," according to Soviet 
organizers. 
</P>
<P>
Before it was held, both the U.S. and Soviet governments privately expressed 
interest in its outcome as an indication of the potential for official talks. 
</P>
<P>
Although both sides deliberated at length over the wording of the statement, 
the Soviets allowed the Americans to take the lead on every issue -- a further 
indication of the Soviet Union's new interest in cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Real Breakthrough' 
</P>
<P>
"This is a real breakthrough," said John Marks, chairman of the private U.S. 
foundation Search for Common Ground, which organized the meeting on the 
American side. 
</P>
<P>
"A very important basis of cooperation has been set. We now see a possibility 
of how the U.S. and the Soviet Union could work together. The framework is now 
established as are the specifics. It's now up to the two governments to move." 
</P>
<P>
In a broad statement, the Soviet-American group said, "In their bilateral 
relations as well as their respective relations with all other states, the U.S. 
and the Soviet Union should recognize their strong mutual interest in 
preventing acts of violence, especially acts of terrorism, which could have 
catalytic regional consequences, and thereby lead to their involvement in local 
conflicts against their interests. 
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, the U.S. and the Soviet Union should move together to prevent 
terrorism and control its consequences when it occurs. The issue of 
international terrorism -- its causes, manifestations and consequences -- 
should be high on their bilateral agenda." 
</P>
<P>
The wording was aimed particularly at stressing the importance of preventing 
terrorist incidents that might in turn derail superpower relations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ties to Client States 
</P>
<P>
Both the United States and the Soviet Union have strong relations with client 
states, particularly in the Middle East, that the other side has accused of 
terrorist activity. Both sides expressed the greatest interest in establishing 
a formal link at the level of operations and crisis management, to prevent 
terrorism and resolve or investigate attacks. 
</P>
<P>
The group also proposed bilateral talks on requiring chemical or other "tags" 
on commercial and military explosives to aid investigators of terrorist 
bombings. 
</P>
<P>
That issue is particularly sensitive to the United States, which has been the 
target of a series of bombings over the past six years, including the explosion 
aboard Pan Am's Flight 103 over Scotland last month. U.S. investigators have 
still not fully resolved several of the earlier incidents. 
</P>
<P>
On legal issues, the two delegations recommended "drafting an international 
convention that would cover threats and acts of violence that deliberately 
target the civilian population and that have an international dimension." 
</P>
<P>
They also proposed consideration of the feasibility of an international 
tribunal, either ad-hoc or permanent, to try individuals responsible for 
international terrorism. In addition, they called on the United Nations to 
establish a standing committee on international terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
Although the two sides acknowledged that there were inherent limitations to 
cooperation, often related to the status of superpower relations, the general 
tenor of the meeting was considered by both sides to be a big step forward on 
one of the most controversial and sensitive issues dividing the two nations. 
</P>
<P>
Interest in the outcome has been so high here that the Soviet press has been 
leaking reports of the closed sessions all week. In one reflection of the 
interest, a leading political commentator of the Soviet news agency Tass echoed 
Marks' comments by heralding the conclusion as the beginning of a new era in 
peace. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FIGHTING TERRORISM 
</P>
<P>
U.S. and Soviet experts urged these and other steps to fight terrorism: 
</P>
<P>
Restraints on sale of military explosives and certain weapons to non-military 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
Joint efforts to prevent terrorists from acquiring chemical, biological and 
nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Joint efforts to improve cooperation during terrorist incidents. 
</P>
<P>
Bilateral talks on requiring chemical or other "tags" on commercial and 
military explosives to aid inquiries into terrorist bombings. 
</P>
<P>
Drafting an international convention that would cover threats and acts of 
violence against civilians. 
</P>
<P>
An international tribunal to try people responsible for international 
terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
Establishment of a U.N. standing committee on international terrorism.

LAROUCHE GETS 15-YEAR TERM, IS DENIED BAIL

A federal judge, bluntly rejecting claims that the government's prosecution was 
politically motivated, sentenced political extremist Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr. to 
15 years in prison on mail and tax fraud convictions Friday and refused to 
release him on bail while he appeals. 
</P>
<P>
District Judge Albert V. Bryan Jr. imposed prison terms and fines on six 
LaRouche associates and ordered their immediate incarceration also. 
</P>
<P>
In a courtroom exchange before sentencing, Bryan dismissed as "arrant nonsense" 
a charge by LaRouche legal coordinator Edward Spannaus that politically 
motivated prosecutors were seeking to "crush LaRouche's organization." 
</P>
<P>
The notion that LaRouche's organization posed a sufficient threat to warrant 
prosecution "just defies human experience," the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
LaRouche and his aides were convicted by a jury on Dec. 16 of bilking numerous 
supporters out of more than $30 million by deliberately defaulting on loans 
from them. 
</P>
<P>
The four-time independent candidate for President was also found guilty of 
evading federal income taxes since at least 1979. He was accused of 
fraudulently having all of his personal expenses paid by various corporations 
that he controls and then contending that he has no taxable income. 
</P>
<P>
LaRouche, a former Marxist, now embraces a number of causes on the far right 
and is noted for espousing bizarre conspiracy theories, such as one linking 
Queen Elizabeth II and Henry A. Kissinger to drug traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
LaRouche had no visible reaction when the sentence was imposed. He and the 
other defendants were handcuffed and led from the courthouse to a van, which 
took them to the Alexandria city jail, where they will remain until they can be 
assigned to a federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time LaRouche was being sentenced, federal prosecutors dropped all 
charges in a related case against LaRouche, six associates and five political 
organizations in U.S. District Court in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
That case, involving charges that LaRouche's 1984 presidential campaign had 
raised more than $2 million through credit card and loan fraud, ended in a 
mistrial last May. A new trial had been scheduled to begin on Feb. 23. But the 
U.S. attorney's office said that, in view of LaRouche's conviction in Virginia, 
further prosecution was not warranted. 
</P>
<P>
In a rambling statement before he was sentenced, LaRouche declared that he was 
"innocent of any wrongdoing." He said that a high-ranking British intelligence 
official had told him that he could influence the outcome of his trial by 
responding to certain "unknown conditions." However, LaRouche added, he refused 
to bargain for justice. 
</P>
<P>
LaRouche said also that his case "already has done great damage to the United 
States" and that "it is time for this evil and reckless prosecution to be 
brought to a halt before further damage is done." 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Kent Robinson shot back: "This is not a political case. 
This was a case of theft." 
</P>
<P>
LaRouche, 66, could have received 65 years in prison and fines totaling $3.25 
million for his conviction on 13 counts of tax and mail fraud conspiracy. He 
will have to serve about 10 years of his 15-year sentence before he is eligible 
for parole, according to a spokesman for the U.S. Parole Commission. 
</P>
<P>
After the sentencing, about 60 LaRouche supporters gathered outside the federal 
courthouse here and paraded with a bed sheet banner reading "Pardon LaRouche -- 
Kill Satan," the Associated Press reported. 
</P>
<P>
One demonstrator wore a large mask of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and 
carried a Soviet flag, symbolizing LaRouche's belief that he is the victim of a 
Soviet secret police frame-up. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters had sought a pardon for LaRouche from President Ronald Reagan before 
he left office and said that they would continue their efforts with President 
Bush. 
</P>
<P>
LaRouche spokeswoman Dana Scanlon said that supporters planned to hold a 
round-the-clock vigil in Lafayette Park, across Pennsylvania Avenue from the 
White House, until LaRouche is released from prison. 
</P>
<P>
Until a few years ago, it would have been highly unusual for people convicted 
of white-collar crimes, such as LaRouche, to be denied bail while they awaited 
the outcome of their appeals. 
</P>
<P>
However, several defense attorneys said the practice has become relatively 
common of late for two reasons. 
</P>
<P>
One is a 1984 change in federal sentencing law that permits immediate jailing 
unless there is reasonable chance of success on appeal. The other is a growing 
sentiment among judges that white-collar criminals should be treated the same 
as others. 
</P>
<P>
LaRouche asked that his incarceration be postponed for 60 days so that he could 
undergo eye surgery, but Bryan denied the request. 
</P>
<P>
After the jury found him guilty on all counts last month, LaRouche called his 
conviction "a wrong, gross, disgusting, obscene miscarriage of justice" that 
was the result of a long "campaign of hate" by the news media and friends of 
the Soviet Union within the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
He said that he expected to be killed in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Bryan sentenced chief LaRouche fund-raiser William Wertz to five years in 
prison and an $11,000 fine. He gave Spannaus a five-year term and a $10,000 
fine. 
</P>
<P>
Each of four other fund-raisers -- Michael Billington, Dennis Small, Paul 
Greenberg and Joyce Rubinstein -- were sentenced to three years in prison and 
received lesser fines.

TESTIMONY BY HILLS SIGNALS TOUGHER U.S. TRADE POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
President Bush's nominee for U.S. trade representative, Carla A. Hills, 
signaled Friday that she will pursue a visibly more aggressive policy, 
including a greater readiness to retaliate against countries that refuse to 
eliminate their trade barriers. 
</P>
<P>
In testimony before the Senate Finance Committee, Hills asserted that "we must 
use the retaliatory tools that we have" because "they are the levers" that can 
help pry U.S. trading partners into opening their markets to more U.S. goods. 
</P>
<P>
And she pledged that she will "aggressively implement" the recently enacted 
Omnibus Trade Act, which is aimed at pushing the United States into taking a 
tougher stance in combating other countries' "unfair" trade practices. 
</P>
<P>
She also bluntly warned Japan that "we must have results" in opening the way 
for U.S. firms to sell more goods in that country, even though most of the 
obstacles they now face stem from Japanese cultural practices rather than 
government-imposed restraints. 
</P>
<P>
Hills' testimony came at a time when the new Bush Administration has taken 
pains to make conciliatory gestures toward the Democratic-controlled Congress, 
where protectionist sentiment runs high. The Finance Committee plans a series 
of hearings to make sure the Administration is aggressively implementing the 
1988 trade act. 
</P>
<P>
Hills' hard-line stance won the immediate approval of committee members, who 
voted unanimously to send her nomination to the Senate. Final confirmation is 
expected next week. Hills, 54, will replace Clayton K. Yeutter, who will become 
agriculture secretary. 
</P>
<P>
In her testimony, which came a week before the visit here of Japanese Prime 
Minister Noboru Takeshita, she indicated she sees no reason to grant Tokyo's 
request that Washington remove trade sanctions it imposed in 1987 on $165 
million in Japanese imports after Japan violated a pact on semiconductor trade. 
</P>
<P>
If anything, Hills said, she would go along with increasing the sanctions if 
the Japanese did not live up to the agreement. "Absolutely," she said when 
asked whether she would favor more sanctions in such a case. "We have to have 
our agreements enforced." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, Hills hinted that she may be willing to compromise 
on a Reagan Administration demand that other countries agree to eliminate all 
agricultural subsidies and other trade barriers as part of the Uruguay Round of 
global trade negotiations now under way. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than insisting that other countries agree to set a firm date for ending 
such subsidies, she said she would press "to establish a satisfactory 
discipline" in farm trade. The debate, which has snagged the Uruguay Round 
talks, comes up again in talks next April. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sever Business Ties 
</P>
<P>
Hills also resolved concerns by some panel members that she might face possible 
conflicts of interest in the trade representative's job because both she and 
her husband, Roderick M. Hills, have served as lawyers and lobbyists for 
foreign firms in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Hills told the panel that both she and her husband will sever all business ties 
and investments "that could conceivably present a conflict" with the decisions 
she will have to make as trade chief, and said she will recuse herself from 
such issues when they come up. 
</P>
<P>
In an unusual move, she said her husband also had pledged not to become 
involved in any activity that either the Office of Government Ethics or her own 
agency believes might pose a potential conflict. She said he will submit all of 
his proposed business transactions for review. 
</P>
<P>
Later Friday, the Office of Government Ethics made public a file containing 
letters from Hills and her husband in which they outlined these pledges in 
detail. Josh Bolton, Hills' nominee to be the agency's general counsel, 
reiterated those commitments. 
</P>
<P>
Hills, a prominent Washington lawyer before she was named to the trade 
representative's post, and her husband both were registered in 1985 as foreign 
agents for Daewoo Industrial Ltd., the South Korean manufacturing conglomerate, 
and have done work for Canadian firms. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Los Angeles, Hills was secretary of housing and urban development 
during the Ford Administration, and her husband was chairman of the Securities 
and Exchange Commission then. Government files show both have substantial 
amounts of stock in large corporations. 
</P>
<P>
For all of her tough talk Friday, Hills stopped well short of advocating a full 
turn toward further protectionism. She said retaliatory moves should be used 
only to pry foreign markets open. And she blamed the nation's $135-billion 
trade deficit mainly on broad economic factors. 
</P>
<P>
If America wants to reduce its trade imbalance, "the United States must save 
more and consume less," she said. "Retaliation cannot be the goal of our 
policy. . . . Our strategic goal is to open markets, not close them." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Hills asserted that where negotiations fail, "I will not 
hesitate to act" by using retaliatory measures "to fight unfair trade 
practices. . . . The credible threat of retaliation provides essential leverage 
in our market-opening efforts," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Although most major decisions involving trade retaliation require presidential 
approval, the new Trade Act gives the U.S. trade representative's office broad 
new powers to decide many such issues on its own. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Hills told the panel Friday she had firm assurances from President 
Bush "that I will have the lead role in dealing with trade issues." Hills will 
have a seat on the 10-member Economic Policy Council, which sets broad economic 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
On other issues, Hills said she supports Bush's promise to back extension of 
the global steel import-quotas that the United States imposed in 1984, but 
hopes to attempt worldwide talks first seeking to persuade other countries to 
reduce their subsidies to domestic steel industries. 
</P>
<P>
She also rejected suggestions that the United States should pare back its 
restrictions on textile imports. And she said Washington will not be ready to 
explore the possibility of negotiating a broad free-trade agreement with Japan 
until current disputes are settled.

Jesse Jackson, in a situation reminiscent of 1984 when reporters and voters had 
wondered for months whether he would run for President, faces a familiar 
question about a new office: Will he run for mayor of the District of Columbia? 
</P>
<P>
"No comment," Jackson said in an interview here Friday, but he later refused to 
rule out the possibility of a mayoral race. 
</P>
<P>
He may be the only person in the city who does not have a comment. As the 
current mayor, Marion Barry, continues to fight allegations that he used 
illegal drugs, some members of Washington's local political leadership are 
casting about for an alternative candidate in the 1990 election.

Meanwhile, Barry said through a spokesman Friday that there is "a 60% chance 
that I will run." 
</P>
<P>
As for a Jackson candidacy, its pros and cons are hashed and rehashed 
everywhere here -- from bars to offices to newspaper editorial pages and 
talk-radio shows. 
</P>
<P>
If Jackson were to run and win, he would gain the experience of holding a 
public office for the first time. He also would be highly visible, dealing with 
Congress and the White House, winning a world forum for issues he cares about. 
Both those factors would serve Jackson well should he make a third run for the 
presidency in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
On the downside, Jackson would lose much of his freedom to travel. He would be 
shackled with running a city that, like many others, is suffering from drug 
problems, murders and a tight budget. Disgruntled voters might complain that he 
ought to stay home instead of heading off to some world capital. 
</P>
<P>
One small obstacle is that Jackson is a resident of Chicago, not the District 
of Columbia. But he still has some time to make up his mind. Leona Agouridis of 
the District's board of elections office said that, to run in the 1990 race, 
Jackson must be a resident for one year, be registered to vote here and file 
petitions with 2,000 names. 
</P>
<P>
One source close to Jackson called speculation that Jackson will run "wishful 
thinking," asserting that some of his critics view the mayor's job as a way of 
diminishing his impact in national politics. 
</P>
<P>
"It would confine him," one local politician said. "And it would be awkward to 
run against Marion." 
</P>
<P>
Recently, several City Council members urged Barry not to run, however, and an 
opinion poll by a local television station showed that voters preferred Jackson 
to Barry by a huge margin. The mayor called the poll "a snapshot in time," 
noting that the election is more than a year away. 
</P>
<P>
Interviewed Friday in his limousine as he headed for the airport, Jackson 
brushed aside questions about whether he would run, preferring to discuss a 
"fact-finding trip" to Moscow and Armenia "to find out what we can do to 
mobilize support for" earthquake victims.

<P>
POSSIBLE SETTLEMENT OF U.S. RACKETEERING CASE BEING NEGOTIATED

Teamsters Union President William J. McCarthy has summoned members of the 
union's executive board to a special meeting this weekend to vote on proposed 
settlement of the government's anti-racketeering lawsuit against the union, 
sources close to the case said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy, in a Teletype message to union officers across the country, said that 
those who serve with him on the 18-member board may want to bring their 
attorneys, presumably to provide advice on whether to accept the government's 
offer, according to sources who requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
They said that Teamsters general counsel James T. Grady was meeting in New York 
to discuss the terms with outgoing U.S. Atty. Rudolph W. Giuliani, who is 
leaving office next Tuesday, and with Assistant U.S. Atty. Randy M. Mastro. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Election Changes Sought 
</P>
<P>
Details of the proposal could not be determined. However, sources said that 
federal prosecutors are pressing to remove about a half dozen Teamster board 
members and to establish a process that would give members a direct vote in 
Teamster elections. Currently, the leadership is chosen through a delegate 
system that critics have charged prevents fair elections. 
</P>
<P>
Also, one source said, the government is insisting that "a board of monitors" 
be established to oversee Teamster elections, perhaps even at the local level. 
</P>
<P>
In negotiations on a settlement, union leaders have been attempting to limit 
the number of union officers who would be forced to resign and to allow the 
union to remain under the control of McCarthy, who became president after the 
death of Jackie Presser last July. 
</P>
<P>
In its unprecedented civil action, filed last June against the nation's largest 
union, the government sought extraordinary sanctions against the Teamsters and 
its leaders. Charging that the union was heavily influenced by organized crime, 
the lawsuit asked that a federal court oust the Teamsters top management, place 
the union under court trusteeship and bar certain alleged Mafia figures from 
any contact with union officers. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations on a possible settlement have been intensifying in recent weeks as 
the Feb. 27 date for trial of the case in New York approaches. 
</P>
<P>
Sources familiar with the talks said the government's proposal is "a tough one" 
that may not be approved at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The Teamsters executive board, in a demonstration of unity, has secretly 
adopted a strongly worded resolution condemning any effort by individual board 
members to negotiate with the government without approval by the board 
majority, those close to the case said. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution has strengthened the hand of Grady and McCarthy in the talks by 
preventing board factions from compromising their position. 
</P>
<P>
However, the union leadership is eager to resolve the case before the trial 
begins. It is concerned about the mounting legal costs as well as the risk that 
the court might choose to take control of the union and place it under a 
trustee. 
</P>
<P>
Both Teamsters and Justice Department officials have refused to comment 
publicly on the case. The government, although it does not want to risk losing 
the lawsuit in a trial, wants to make sure that all leaders with strong Mafia 
ties are removed, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Teamster board members targeted for resignation by the government are those 
whose names have emerged in organized crime investigations over the years, 
whether or not they were ever charged with crimes themselves, sources said. 
They are suspected of being influenced by the Mafia or of being unwilling to 
take action to eliminate Mafia influence over the Teamsters. 
</P>
<P>
Although no written list of those board members has been prepared by the 
government, sources familiar with the talks said that the principal 
"international vice presidents" mentioned in this group include Joseph 
Trerotola of New York; Joseph W. Morgan of Hallandale, Fla.; Harold Friedman of 
Cleveland; Ted R. Cozza of Pittsburgh, and Donald Peters and Daniel Ligurotis, 
both of Chicago. Two sources have said that another vice president, Robert H. 
Holmes of Detroit, also might be targeted for ouster. 
</P>
<P>
In responding to a Times report earlier this week on the negotiations, 
Trerotola denied that a settlement hinges partly on his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
"That wasn't discussed one bit at the (Teamster) board meeting. No one 
mentioned this guy or that guy has to go," Trerotola told Newsday in an 
interview. " . . . I didn't do anything wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Holmes also denied that he might be forced out. "I've never been asked to 
resign, but maybe sometime in the future I might," Holmes told the Detroit Free 
Press. He also denied having any Mafia ties. 
</P>
<P>
Holmes recently aligned himself with a faction on the board loyal to 
Secretary-Treasurer Weldon L. Mathis of Atlanta, who is considered by most law 
enforcement officials to be free of any organized crime influence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Against 'Unity' Resolution 
</P>
<P>
Sources said that Holmes, Mathis and two other vice presidents -- Don L. West 
of Birmingham, Ala., and Edward Lawson of Vancouver, Canada -- voted against 
the so-called "unity" resolution on grounds that union officers should not be 
barred from talking with the government. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution said in part that "no present member of the executive board 
should enter into any individual settlement agreement with the government which 
will adversely prejudice and affect the right of remaining members . . . or 
which could adversely affect the legal position of the international union in 
the pending litigation."

LEBANESE STAFF LOCKS U.S. AMBASSADOR IN HIS OFFICE FOR 3 HOURS OVER WAGES

The local staff of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut locked Ambassador John McCarthy 
in his office for three hours to press for higher salaries, an embassy source 
disclosed today. 
</P>
<P>
The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Lebanese staff, 
including guards armed with rifles, blocked all entrances to the compound 
Friday afternoon in the suburb of Aukar. 
</P>
<P>
They "prevented anyone from entering" the ambassador's office. "The ambassador 
was there alone all the time," the source said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the protest "lasted for about three hours, after which the Lebanese 
employees decided to call off the move for a week to give the ambassador time 
to follow up their demands with Washington." 
</P>
<P>
He replied "no comment" when asked what the contingent of U.S. Marines 
stationed at the compound did during the protest. 
</P>
<P>
The source said the local staff demanded "increase of salaries, and (were) 
protesting the lack of benefits for their families." He would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the guards fired in the air "in jubilation after the ambassador 
promised to take up their demands with Washington," the source said. 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy, 49, assumed his post on Sept. 24, eight days after his predecessor, 
John Kelly, was flown out of the country with a heart ailment. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, the situation is normal at the embassy. But the relationship (between 
the Lebanese and American employees) will never be the same," the source added. 
</P>
<P>
He estimated the Lebanese staff at the embassy at 500, but said he could not 
tell how many were involved in the incident. Most junior U.S. employees have 
been withdrawn from war-torn Beirut for security considerations the past four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen foreigners, including nine Americans, are missing and presumed 
kidnapped in Lebanon.

TALKS ON LEGALIZATION OF SOLIDARITY, POLAND'S FUTURE TO OPEN ON FEB. 6

Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and Poland's Communist rulers agreed on Friday to 
start formal talks on Feb. 6 on the country's future and legalizing the banned 
union. 
</P>
<P>
A Solidarity spokesman said the date for "round-table" talks in Warsaw was 
worked out at secret discussions Walesa held with Interior Minister Czeslaw 
Kiszczak. 
</P>
<P>
"It was agreed that the first meeting of the round-table will take place on 
Feb. 6 in Warsaw," spokesman Jacek Ambroziak, a legal adviser to the Roman 
Catholic church, told reporters outside the church's headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
"I am happy and very tired," Walesa said after more than 11 hours of talks with 
Kiszczak at a government villa in the village of Magdalenka, about 12 miles 
south of Warsaw. 
</P>
<P>
They met to make the final preparations for the round-table talks that the 
Communist government hopes will forge a national coalition with the opposition 
to pull Poland out of economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The government offered the talks to Walesa, Roman Catholic church officials and 
independent public figures in August during the worst labor unrest since 
Solidarity was banned under martial law in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
But Walesa refused to attend unless authorities promised to consider restoring 
his banned union, which challenged Communist rule during its 16-month legal 
existence.

FOUR MORE NATIONS WILL PULL ENVOYS FROM KABUL

KABUL, Afghanistan

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four nations announced Friday they will follow the U.S. decision to pull its 
diplomats out of Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
France, Italy, Britain and Japan made separate announcements of their 
intentions to leave Kabul. 
</P>
<P>
The Afghan government responded by criticizing the closings. The Soviet news 
agency Tass reported that the decisions reflect an attempt to undermine 
international confidence in the Soviet-backed government, besieged by Muslim 
guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
Italy said it will temporarily close its embassy in Kabul as soon as an Italian 
journalist seriously injured in Afghanistan can leave, a Foreign Ministry 
official said in Rome. 
</P>
<P>
Tass quoted an Afghan Foreign Ministry statement charging that the closure of 
embassies on security grounds in view of the imminent departure of Soviet 
troops is unjustified. 
</P>
<P>
It said the Afghan army "is successfully defending the cities and provinces 
from where Soviet troops have already left." 
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, the decisions of Western states can only be assessed as an attempt 
to sap the trust of international public opinion in the ability of the state 
authorities to defend the city from extremists." 
</P>
<P>
Tass also reported that a child was killed and several buildings damaged in a 
rebel rocket attack on the Afghan capital Friday. It said five rockets hit the 
city, one destroying a school. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov flew in on a previously 
unannounced visit, less than three weeks before the last of his troops are due 
to leave the country. 
</P>
<P>
A Soviet Embassy official said Yazov immediately went into conference with 
President Najibullah, but he could give no further details. 
</P>
<P>
Most embassies and aid agencies cut their staffs last August during a period of 
heavy rebel rocket attacks on Kabul. 
</P>
<P>
Not all diplomats are happy at the prospect of recall. 
</P>
<P>
"People talk rubbish," one French envoy commented. "It's beautiful weather. 
There are no rockets. It's very quiet now."

An Israeli newspaper reported Friday that an aide to Defense Minister Yitzhak 
Rabin met with a Palestinian leader on how to end the uprising in the occupied 
lands. 
</P>
<P>
The Hebrew daily Maariv said Rabin adviser Shmuel Goren visited Faisal 
Husseini, who is imprisoned at the Kfar Yonah prison in central Israel, and 
that the two held a series of secret meetings on political initiatives for 
restoring calm to the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
Reports on the talks were passed to top PLO officials abroad, the newspaper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Ministry spokesman Eitan Haber refused comment on the reported 
meetings, which would mark a shift in the government's policy of not talking 
with the Palestine Liberation Organization. Israel considers the PLO a 
terrorist organization. 
</P>
<P>
Husseini is scheduled to be released from prison Sunday. He has been held 
without trial most of the past 21 months, accused of anti-government activity. 
</P>
<P>
Fuad Aref, an associate of Husseini, said that he visited Husseini on Monday 
and that Husseini denied rumors of exploratory talks with Israeli leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ezer Weizman, the science minister in Israel's Cabinet, told the 
Jerusalem Post that it is time for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to "remove the 
taboo" on speaking with the PLO.

NO BUSH FOR NBC WEST COAST VIEWERS

Although CBS and ABC aired President Bush's Friday news conference live 
nationally, an NBC error gave the network's West Coast viewers only the regular 
"Today" broadcast normally aired there on a tape-delay basis. 
</P>
<P>
It was a mistake that will not happen again, said Marty Ryan, the program's 
executive producer. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan said that the show originally was told by NBC staff members in Washington 
that Bush planned only "a quick, informal get-together" with reporters late 
Friday morning at a time that the taped "Today" broadcast normally airs on 
NBC's West Coast stations, including KNBC-TV in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Ryan was advised that it would be a full-blown press conference, it 
was too late to cut into the show, he said. "It was kind of a lousy call on our 
part, but also theirs," Ryan said, referring to the network's Washington staff, 
which provided the incorrect information.

VIGNETTES FROM BUSH'S FIRST WEEK: WIN ONE, LOSE ONE

<P>
Snapshot: Sitting down at the Cabinet Room table early in his first week as 
President, George Bush skims a set of 3- by 5-inch briefing cards. He drops 
them into his pocket and launches an hourlong conversation with congressional 
leaders about issues ranging from the deficit and the savings and loan crisis 
to relations with the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The result: Fulsome praise from Democrats and Republicans alike. "He commented 
on everybody's statement or question," Rep. Tony Coelho (D-Merced) said with 
enthusiasm. "We had a dialogue. As you spoke to him, he made notes. He knows 
his stuff. That wasn't true before." 
</P>
<P>
Snapshot: Faced with astronomical cost estimates for bailing out the nation's 
insolvent savings and loan insurance fund, the fledgling Administration 
declares it is considering a fee of 25 cents to 30 cents per $100 on the 
checking and savings accounts of every American. 
</P>
<P>
The result: Indignant howls from every corner of the land, with critics 
charging the scheme would penalize America's savers and violate Bush's pledge 
not to raise taxes. Instead of stepping quickly clear, Bush and Chief of Staff 
John H. Sununu become further entangled. 
</P>
<P>
"This was clearly a story we didn't need," said one Administration official, 
asking not to be identified. He termed the plan a "glitch." Said a rueful White 
House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, it was "a lesson for everybody on how things 
can blow up and how fast they can." 
</P>
<P>
Taken together, the two vignettes illuminate the road ahead for the week-old 
Bush Administration. 
</P>
<P>
As the session with congressional leaders suggests, Bush -- like his mentor, 
Ronald Reagan -- appears to be adroit in handling the mood-setting symbols and 
gestures that can ease the path of presidential leadership. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the way the Administration seemed to step blindly into the 
savings and loan flap was a painful reminder that devising and advancing 
workable, politically palatable solutions to major problems is far more 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Bush acknowledged as much Friday at his first presidential news conference. "I 
don't expect it's all going to be sweetness and harmony and light," he said, 
his voice gravelly from a cold. "It's been a good, easy week. I expect it will 
change dramatically in the days ahead." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rougher Times 
</P>
<P>
And the likelihood of rougher times may be increased by the fact that the 
Administration is only now settling to the task of developing specific policy 
proposals and positions on the many problems awaiting action. 
</P>
<P>
For now, however, the real confrontations are still in the future. Asked to sum 
up his week, Bush sounded still a little amazed at having finally achieved the 
office he sought for so long. "There's still the wonder of it all," he said. 
"It still feels different." 
</P>
<P>
Bush seemed to accentuate those differences this week as he set out to signal 
that it is his White House now and not Ronald Reagan's. He did so by 
emphasizing a busy schedule, early morning work hours, a breezy style and the 
upbeat tenor of his meetings. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing George Bush had to do was show he understood the 
office of the presidency and understood the system had to work again," said 
Coelho, who serves as the Democrats' third-ranking official in the House and 
who was one of Reagan's sharpest critics. 
</P>
<P>
"He and his wife, Barbara, have changed the face of the presidency back to 
regular people in charge, as opposed to the actor and actress as monarch. The 
symbolism of that has really gone over well." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most symbolically telling moment came Thursday, when Bush addressed 
nearly 4,000 senior federal managers, exactly the sort of career bureaucrats 
against whom both Reagan and Jimmy Carter had campaigned. 
</P>
<P>
"You are the first group that I am addressing as President outside the White 
House," Bush said. "And you are one of the most important groups I will ever 
speak to." 
</P>
<P>
Where Reagan had declared during his first week in office that "government is 
not the solution to our problem, government is the problem," Bush told his 
first-week audience that the "federal government (is) a powerful force for 
good." 
</P>
<P>
The point has not been to draw overt contrasts with Reagan, one senior White 
House official insisted, speaking on condition of anonymity. "There's just been 
a focus on having George Bush be President." 
</P>
<P>
During Friday's press conference, aides looked on, relaxed, smiling, as Bush 
easily fielded dozens of questions. During the Reagan years, press conferences 
were anxious times for staff members, who stood by worrying about possible 
presidential misstatements. 
</P>
<P>
Then, there is the matter of schedule. It changes frequently -- according to 
the President's dictates, unlike the set-in-concrete, long-range schedule 
arranged for Reagan by his staff. 
</P>
<P>
One day this week, Bush reached for the telephone and on the spur of the 
moment, set up the ultimate Texas power lunch: Democrat Lloyd Bentsen and 
Republican Phil Gramm, the state's two senators; Cabinet nominees James A. 
Baker III of the State Department and Robert A. Mossbacher of Commerce and 
Cabinet secretary David Bates, a longtime Bush aide. 
</P>
<P>
Over soup and sandwiches in the study off the Oval Office, the group discussed 
a host of major policy issues affecting both their home state and the nation. 
The session was casual, candid and relaxed, one of the lunch guests later told 
an aide. 
</P>
<P>
Bush "has established a very collegial atmosphere, where you work with the 
President," said Fitzwater. "He's forcing little changes in the system, which 
are healthy. What the President has done is he's told the White House staff to 
find ways to respond a lot faster than they are used to responding." 
</P>
<P>
Bush has been walking around the West Wing of the White House, visiting aides 
in their offices, rather than allowing himself to be trapped in his own 
quarters. 
</P>
<P>
The little changes, aides say, will be followed by bigger ones -- those that go 
to the heart of the problems Bush faces as he sets out to tackle the budget 
deficit and move ahead on the momentum he inherited in U.S.-Soviet relations. 
</P>
<P>
Conspicuously absent from the first week were the bold policy proposals and 
dramatic gestures that new Presidents traditionally use to rack up early 
triumphs and give momentum to their presidencies. Instead, the emphasis, in 
Bush's own words has been on "continuity, plus." 
</P>
<P>
That approach may squander a moment when public attention is focused on the 
President and opposition to him is low, some political consultants believe, but 
others argue that Bush has made the correct decision. 
</P>
<P>
By "not trying to position himself around a 100-day agenda or a call to arms, 
he avoided a mountaintop of some kind that assures a fall into the valley at 
some point," said Republican consultant Eddie Mahe. 
</P>
<P>
But one pitfall of providing no riveting focus to the initial days could be 
seen at midweek when what Fitzwater optimistically called a "24-hour 
distraction" -- the savings and loan tax plan -- briefly dominated news 
coverage of the White House. 
</P>
<P>
Now that Bush's own aides have floated such proposals, the Administration will 
have a far harder time resisting creative "revenue enhancements" proposed in 
Congress, Sen. Timothy E. Wirth (D-Colo.) suggested. 
</P>
<P>
But Bush seemed unperturbed. "It's been a wonderfully harmonious week," he 
said. The controversies "are just little ripples on the surface of an otherwise 
calm pond."

IT'S BETTER THAN NEW ORLEANS FESTIVAL, ALABAMIANS SAY; 
</P>
<P>
MARDI GRAS IS SERIOUS BUSINESS IN MOBILE

Cries of "Moon Pie! Moon Pie!" ring out as hordes of holiday revelers beg for 
candy and trinkets from gaily costumed characters on colorful papier-mache 
floats parading through downtown's historic streets. 
</P>
<P>
It is Mardi Gras time in Mobile -- a season of genial madness in this otherwise 
sedate and conservative port city. 
</P>
<P>
New Orleans may lay claim to the best-known Mardi Gras in the United States. 
But citizens of this 287-year-old town contend that Mobile's "Fat Tuesday" 
celebration was the first and still offers the most fun. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not as crowded as New Orleans, there's way far less crime and it's more 
family oriented," said Wayne Dean Sr., an amateur Mardi Gras historian and 
chief booster of Mobile's festival. "You can have a good time, and you don't 
have to leave the kids at home." 
</P>
<P>
Dean also argues that Mardi Gras in this city of 210,000 is more authentic, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel it's a purer form of the celebration here," he said. "You won't see 
any advertising on the floats, and the flavor and variety of our events are 
more in keeping with tradition." 
</P>
<P>
Mobile's festivities are attracting larger and larger crowds each year as word 
spreads about its distinctive "home-grown" Mardi Gras style. 
</P>
<P>
This year, more than 250,000 revelers of all ages are expected to take part in 
the two weeks of festivities that began Wednesday with an evening parade by the 
Conde Cavaliers, one of more than a dozen local societies that will stage 
processions between now and Ash Wednesday, the first day of Lent. 
</P>
<P>
Mobile's Mardi Gras dates back in a line broken only by wars to 1703, one year 
after the city's founding by French explorers at Ft. Louis de la Louisiane on a 
bluff 27 miles north of the present-day city. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Letter Depicts Observance 
</P>
<P>
"A letter sent back to France by one of the soldiers stationed at the tiny fort 
tells of the observance of Mardi Gras by the settlement," Dean said. "This was 
15 years before New Orleans was even founded." 
</P>
<P>
The distinctive style of today's Mardi Gras -- with parades, floats and masked 
balls sponsored by "mystic societies" -- is not French, however. It derives, 
oddly enough, from the New Year's Eve escapades in 1830 of Michael Krafft, a 
one-eyed Mobile cotton broker who originally was from Bristol, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
Krafft and his cronies, reluctant to call an end to their New Year's Eve 
partying, raided a downtown hardware store in the wee hours and helped 
themselves to cowbells, gongs, rakes and hoes. They then set back out into the 
night and woke up the town as they rang the bells and gongs and clanged the 
rakes and hoes against iron fences and lampposts. 
</P>
<P>
The following year, they formed the "Cowbellions de Rakin" -- the first mystic 
society in the nation and the progenitor of the exclusive present-day clubs in 
both Mobile and New Orleans that stage Mardi Gras parades and balls. In 1840, 
the Cowbellions also set a new fashion when they presented a New Year's Eve 
parade complete with floats and a theme -- "heathen gods and goddesses." 
</P>
<P>
"If New Orleans styles itself as the home of the Mardi Gras, it's because it 
can lay claim to forming the first of these societies devoted exclusively to 
Mardi Gras celebrations in the 1850s," said Caldwell Delaney, Mobile's official 
historian and director of the City Museum. "In Mobile, the societies restricted 
their celebrating to New Year's Eve until after the War between the States." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Boost to Both Cities 
</P>
<P>
Today, Mardi Gras in New Orleans draws more than 1 million visitors annually 
and pumps an estimated $114 million into New Orleans' economy. Mobile's 
celebration does not rival New Orleans' in tourist revenue, but it is still an 
economic blessing for this hard-pressed city. The Chamber of Commerce estimates 
that the holiday season pumps about $20 million into the local economy, 
including expenditures for costumes, gowns, floats and "throws." 
</P>
<P>
"Throws" are the beads, trinkets, aluminum doubloons, candy and the like that 
are tossed from the floats to scrambling crowds during each parade. The most 
prized catch of all, Mobilians say, are Moon Pies, a traditional Southern 
confection of chocolate and marshmallow. Mardi Gras officials estimate more 
than 2 million of these are thrown each year. 
</P>
<P>
"I caught enough Moon Pies last year to last me and my kid for 2 1/2 months," 
says a transplanted Montanan who came to Mobile 14 years ago and claims not to 
have missed a single Mardi Gras parade since then. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most unusual event in Mobile's calendar of Mardi Gras activities is 
the "Joe Cain Procession," which traditionally takes place on the Sunday before 
Mardi Gras Tuesday. The parade is named after the Confederate veteran and town 
clerk who is credited with reviving Mardi Gras here after the celebration died 
out during the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
On Mardi Gras Tuesday of 1866, Cain dressed up as the Chickasaw Indian Chief 
Slacabamorinico and drove through the Union-occupied streets of Mobile in a 
fancily decorated charcoal wagon, accompanied by half a dozen fellow 
Confederate veterans. 
</P>
<P>
Cain's choice of Slacabamorinico (pronounced SLACK-uh-BAM-uh-REHN-ick-KOH) was 
a subtle gesture of defiance toward Mobile's Yankee conquerors. "The Chickasaws 
had never surrendered nor had they ever been defeated," notes Edward Ladd, 
president of the Mobile Carnival Assn., which coordinates the town's Mardi Gras 
festivities. 
</P>
<P>
Cain died in 1904 in the nearby town of Bayou La Batre. But in the mid-1960s, 
his remains were moved to Mobile and an annual parade in his honor was begun. 
Traditionally led by the 106-year-old Excelsior Band and "Old Slac" himself in 
turkey-feather headdress and bear-fur skirt, the procession is a "people's 
parade" that allows ordinary citizens to don masks, build homemade floats and 
parade through the streets. 
</P>
<P>
The procession also ends up with a wide-open party that is a refreshing 
departure from the white-tie-and-tails, by-invitation-only balls put on by the 
more exclusive Mardi Gras societies.

Twenty-nine suspected members of a Colombian cocaine cartel have been indicted 
on federal drug charges, accused of using three Chicago-area jewelry stores as 
distributors, U.S. Atty. Anton Valukas said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
A 101-count indictment named one U.S. citizen and 28 Colombians from Cali. 
Twenty-four of those indicted were arrested Thursday night and the others were 
being sought, Valukas said. 
</P>
<P>
The local arm of the Cali cartel allegedly distributed 440 pounds of the drug a 
month, much of it through the jewelry stores.

REP. BERMAN INTRODUCES BILL TO OUTLAW SEMIAUTOMATIC FIREARMS

<P>
Aiming to prevent a recurrence of incidents like the Stockton schoolyard 
shooting, Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) introduced legislation Friday 
to outlaw the possession of semiautomatic firearms. 
</P>
<P>
The measure would cover weapons like the AK-47 assault rifle used to kill five 
children and wound 30 other people in the Stockton attack Jan. 17, as well as 
banning all semiautomatic pistols and shotguns. 
</P>
<P>
Berman's bill is much more rigorous than a measure proposed Tuesday by Sen. 
Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio), which would ban the importation or sale of new 
semiautomatic assault weapons like the AK-47. 
</P>
<P>
Berman, in a press statement announcing his proposal, criticized the Metzenbaum 
bill as inadequate because it would leave "thousands upon thousands of these 
weapons available for criminal use." 
</P>
<P>
The Stockton slayings have focused increased attention on gun control 
legislation in this session of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The National Rifle Assn., which plans to mount a strong lobbying campaign 
against the measures, called Berman's plan a "stupid piece of legislation." The 
NRA contends that such measures punish only law-abiding gun owners and that 
semiautomatic weapons have legitimate uses in hunting.

INSURANCE DEALER ACQUITTED IN U.S. FRAUD CASE

A California insurance dealer accused by federal prosecutors in a sweeping 
nationwide health insurance fraud case has been acquitted in the first of as 
many as five trials. 
</P>
<P>
Angelo T. Commito, along with an insurance broker and a union official, was 
found innocent Thursday by a federal jury of charges of embezzlement from the 
union's pension fund and accepting kickbacks on insurance contracts. The jury 
deliberated seven hours before reaching the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
Commito, 43, who owns Labor Health and Benefits Plan, still faces trial in San 
Francisco on fraud charges in connection with his business of supplying union 
insurance coverage. 
</P>
<P>
"The government vendetta against Angelo Commito is shown for what it is: a 
bunch of rumors and gossip that cannot stand up to the test of a jury trial," 
said Deputy Federal Public Defender Harry L. Hellerstein, Commito's lawyer in 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
In separate indictments in San Francisco, San Diego, Atlanta and Baltimore, 
Commito is accused of paying kickbacks to an undercover FBI agent.

TWO BANKS GET LICENSES FOR INSURANCE POLICY SALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taking a major step toward implementation of Proposition 103, State Insurance 
Commissioner Roxani Gillespie announced Friday that she has issued licenses to 
sell insurance to two major banks -- First Interstate and Security Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
While Gillespie said the banks are permitted to immediately begin acting as 
sales agents for insurance companies, representatives of both said their 
start-up date will be at least several weeks away. Both banks indicated that 
the first sales will be rather limited. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the state's largest organization of insurance agents, the 
Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers Assn., announced that it will file 
suit Monday in a Superior Court somewhere in California to block sales of 
insurance by banks. A spokesman for the group said a temporary injunction will 
be sought while the case is adjudicated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Increase Competition 
</P>
<P>
The licenses issued by Gillespie allow Security Pacific to market fire, 
casualty (which includes auto insurance), life and disability policies. By 
contrast, First Interstate is permitted for the time being to market only life 
and disability policies -- until its personnel take exams to qualify for 
selling auto insurance. 
</P>
<P>
During the insurance initiative campaign that led to the passage of Proposition 
103, supporters of the provision allowing banks into the insurance business 
contended that the step will increase competition and lower insurance prices. 
</P>
<P>
But neither bank Friday committed itself to selling at lower prices, and 
neither announced the names of the insurance companies whose policies they will 
sell. 
</P>
<P>
Rex Morlan, chief of Security Pacific's insurance group, said: "We do not have 
contracts with any companies. . . . We're confident we will have several 
companies, but we haven't nailed it down to the final ones yet. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we can be ready for sales in two or three weeks, but not on a broad 
basis," Morlan said. "We're planning to do some test marketing, and our plans 
for the future are to market only through the mail." 
</P>
<P>
So, Security Pacific customers will not be able to walk into a bank branch and 
buy insurance policies, but some will be solicited through promotional material 
sent out with their checks or in other bank mailings. 
</P>
<P>
John Popovich, a spokesman for First Interstate, said that bank is hesitant to 
say when it will start sales, in part because of uncertainties about how the 
courts may react to the agents' lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
"We have people in a constant state of analysis in terms of products we will 
sell, and the delivery system we will use, and while we're not moving slowly, 
we're not moving precipitously either," Popovich said. 
</P>
<P>
Blair Reynolds, senior vice president and general counsel of the California 
Bankers Assn., said that many other banking firms will soon apply for licenses 
to sell insurance and that he is sure eventually bank sales will bring down 
insurance prices. 
</P>
<P>
"Where this has occurred in other states, prices have come down to the public 
because of the increased competition, but you can't make a specific commitment 
until you find out what the market is," Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that about half the states have permitted banks to sell at least some 
insurance beyond credit insurance (to protect mortgages or credit cards) and 
that from 1919 to 1976, state chartered banks in California were authorized to 
sell insurance in towns of 5,000 population or less, although to his knowledge 
none did. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie cautioned Friday that the way Proposition 103 was written left 
ambiguities about bank sales that she said would have to be cleared up by the 
Legislature. For instance, the statute repealed by Proposition 103 banned auto 
insurance sales by the banks but also contained a provision that specifically 
authorized them to sell credit insurance. 
</P>
<P>
In repealing the statute, the matter of credit insurance "is left blank," 
Gillespie said, and she suggested that the Legislature pass a bill 
reauthorizing it.

AL MARTINEZ: A STREET WITH NO NAME

<TEXT>
<P>
The man who came into the office of Acton's Unocal service station was dressed 
in ordinary street clothes, but his face was made up like a clown and he wore a 
punk style fright wig streaked in bright reds and yellows. It was hard not to 
notice him. The others in the office had on denims and plaid shirts and 
sometimes heavy jackets because there was still snow on the peaks that loomed 
over the Antelope Valley and a cold wind was blowing across the high desert. 
</P>
<P>
The clown man was in a stew because he was late for something and wanted to 
know how far east Sand Canyon was. The lady behind the counter, who couldn't 
take her eyes off his wig, said it wasn't east, it was west. He said, "Are you 
sure?" the way people do when they don't get the kind of answer they want. "I'm 
sure," the lady said. "You'll see all the housing tracts on the side of the 
road," a customer offered. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll never get there," the clown man said, hurrying off. Those in the station 
office watched him go and one of them said, "He belongs in Sand Canyon." Then 
they laughed and went on about their business. Someone said later the clown 
probably reminded them of the jarring red-roofed tract houses that trim Sand 
Canyon's "designer hills" about 15 miles away, hills flattened and restructured 
to accommodate new development. The folks in Acton look upon it as a kind of 
residential circus. 
</P>
<P>
I was in Acton not in search of a circus but of serenity. It's a small town 
about 50 miles northeast of L.A., just before you get to Palmdale. Someone told 
me it was one of the last outposts of quiet living, a place where horseback 
riders mosied down the main street and pigs were sold for slaughter, but now 
land speculators are moving in and things are changing. It's understandable if 
not desirable. 
</P>
<P>
We're all searching for what a line in the song "'Midnight Train to Georgia" 
describes as "a better place in time," which is to say a safer and more 
peaceful climate, like the small towns that exist in song and memory. 
Developers understand our longing and seek out places like Acton because 
they're peaceful and the land is gracious. And then they set about destroying 
the beauty with tract houses. 
</P>
<P>
It's obvious just driving into Acton that change is in the wind. A large sign 
on Crown Valley Road announces that 32 luxury homes are coming soon. "That says 
it all," Steve Miller said, standing behind the counter at Acton Auto Parts. 
He's president of the town's Chamber of Commerce. "That's what we're afraid of. 
Big developers built one tract of $300,000 homes on the other side of town and 
they were sold overnight. Now they're going to build $700,000 homes and they'll 
be gone overnight too. It's getting so there's no place to hide." 
</P>
<P>
What Miller meant was that when he was a kid he lived in Torrance, which was 
horse country then, and when the rural nature of Torrance changed, buried under 
a burgeoning population, the family moved to Corona. When Corona changed it was 
off to Chatsworth, always just ahead of the advancing hordes of suburbanites, 
and when Chatsworth boomed Miller came to Acton. He has no idea where he'd go 
from Acton, and neither does anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
I can understand the quest. If you're looking for a quiet life in a rural 
setting, Acton is it. The town was started by miners and ranchers more than a 
hundred years ago and still has a 19th Century feel to it. About 6,000 people 
live in areas that surround an idyllic village setting. I spent the afternoon 
wandering around and ended up on a street with no name looking toward the 
market and the 49er Saloon. 
</P>
<P>
Hills cascade in perfect symmetry to a distance that overlaps into diminishing 
shades of brown and gold. Acton's older homes, shielded by pine and eucalyptus 
trees, blend perfectly into the setting and from where I stood you couldn't see 
the stark new tract houses across the freeway. Nothing violates the land from 
the street with no name. 
</P>
<P>
"We talked about incorporation but we just don't have the tax base," Steve 
Miller said. "Instead, we're working to create a community ordinance that would 
control development. I just hope we're not too late." 
</P>
<P>
As I drove out of town, I passed the sign that said 32 new luxury homes were 
coming soon. I also passed one that said Bingo was played on Friday nights at 
the Acton Community Club. I realized suddenly that they pretty much summarized 
a world in conflict, like the guy with the clown face in a town of muted tones, 
and I wondered how long it would be before the Bingo games were gone too. 
Euripides said all is change, all yields its place and goes. I thought about 
that and about Acton as I drove back into the calamity of the city.

WATER WARFARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state Water Resources Control Board has prudently retreated from a flawed 
staff proposal that would have guided California's most critical 
water-allocation decisions into the 21st Century. In doing so, the board has 
given itself six months in which to revise the plan so that it provides a sound 
technical basis for increased water needs of fish and wildlife while 
accommodating the conflicting demands of all other California interests. 
</P>
<P>
Doing both things at once will be difficult. It will become impossible unless 
the board better substantiates the need for a proposed increase of water for 
fish life in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and provides a more equitable 
allocation of what is left over. 
</P>
<P>
The release of the proposal has re-ignited the north-south water battle with 
special fury, demonstrating that the line between consensus on California water 
issues and trench warfare is a thin one. Southern California interests served 
by the Metropolitan Water District and the state Water Project claimed with 
justification that the new water plan punished them unfairly. Project customers 
would be limited to less than 800,000 acre-feet of water a year from the delta, 
compared with the original promise of more than 2 million acre-feet. One 
acre-foot provides for the residential use of two average families per year, or 
enough to irrigate a third of an acre of cotton. 
</P>
<P>
Northern Californians were delighted by the idea of absolute limits on the 
south's imports at less than current levels. Now that the board has agreed to 
drop its proposed limits, the north is claiming that the door is open to more 
giveaways of the north's water. That is not necessarily so. The environmental 
health of the delta is vital to all of California. There are many ways of 
maintaining the delta's integrity without such wrenching upheaval of the 
Southern California water system. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy involves the board's periodic review of water-quality standards 
for the delta -- the estuary that produces about 40% of California's 
irrigation, municipal and industrial water. In three phases stretching over 
several years, the board is expected to set new water-quality standards that 
will determine how much the state and federal water projects can pump from the 
delta. 
</P>
<P>
The courts have given the board extraordinary powers to protect the 
environment, but also have admonished the agency to balance natural needs 
against other public interests. In its report, the staff dictated unprecedented 
conservation of water in Southern California, more even than in past droughts, 
without suggesting in detail just how that was to be achieved. The south's 
sacrifice in part would benefit salt-sensitive bean crops on delta islands with 
little comparable conservation by farmers along the Sacramento and San Joaquin 
rivers. Upstream farm use would grow to more than 11 million acre-feet by the 
year 2010, compared with 4.1 million acre-feet for what it deemed to be 
"reasonable" urban use in all of Southern California. The report ignored a 
considerable body of opinion that agricultural water needs in fact will decline 
over the years. 
</P>
<P>
The staff's major aim was to provide more water in the delta to reverse the 
decline in salmon and striped-bass populations. The delta has been damaged, but 
the staff failed to provide technical data to support its conclusion that 
pumping was the primary cause. It vaguely said that "something must be done 
now, even if all the reasons for the decline are not known" and that "a safe 
level of exports is not known." 
</P>
<P>
The controversy has resurrected the give-no-quarter mode of the water debate. 
In opposing the staff plan, which it must, the Metropolitan Water District is 
being branded in the north as a greedy monolith. The fact is that MWD has made 
major advances in supplementing its water supplies in innovative ways without 
drawing on further water from the delta. While more can be done, Southern 
California has made considerable progress in saving water. As for delta 
protection, there already are limits on export pumping and a variety of laws to 
safeguard the environment. 
</P>
<P>
The board's credibility will be at stake during coming months. Even if it 
ultimately delivers a Solomon-like decision, the agency will suffer political 
attack and legal challenge. Critics will be able to demagogue the issue because 
it is so complicated and because water issues are decided by such a close-knit 
fraternity in California -- mostly white males who are lawyers and engineers. 
</P>
<P>
The California water world needs to be demystified, and now is the time. The 
outcome of these hearings over the next two years will affect every California 
citizen and community for decades. Gov. George Deukmejian and legislative 
leaders should consider appointing a committee of respected citizens -- not 
water experts -- to monitor the hearings. The group should represent the entire 
state, but be of workable size. It would report to the public from time to time 
as members best see fit. If nothing else, the committee might help to dispel 
the myths that always cloud such water battles. The war-weary water world could 
benefit from a little sunshine and common sense.

PRESIDENT BUSH'S INAUGURAL ADDRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last week I had the unhappy experience of burying my father, a veteran of World 
War II. Sadly, when I first saw my dad's casket covered by the American flag, I 
felt a confused mixture of emotions: On the one hand, my father had earned the 
flag (as I did mine in Vietnam), but on the other hand the flag has in recent 
months been made to symbolize an opportunistic and often empty patriotism for 
which neither my father nor I have anything but contempt. 
</P>
<P>
During the presidential campaign, my dad and I had been able to laugh at Bush 
and Jim Baker's ludicrous efforts to turn our national symbol into a partisan 
emblem; it was only standing in front of that casket that I realized what they 
had stolen from us just making that effort. 
</P>
<P>
George Bush had better be one hell of a President because he now has a long way 
to go just to get back to zero with me.

CONTROVERSY OVER TAPED POLICE 'STING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With all the media attention surrounding the Don Jackson vs. Long Beach Police 
Department incident, I am reluctant to add to the morass of accusations and 
innuendo, but I am compelled to comment. 
</P>
<P>
My observations may not be totally unbiased -- I too am a peace officer. I am 
not employed in Los Angeles County. I will readily admit that law enforcement 
tactics and departmental policies vary from agency to agency. One basic reality 
that runs like a continuous thread through the entire fabric of law enforcement 
is that there are biased/racist/sexist cops just like there are 
biased/racist/sexist civilians. The law enforcement profession has set 
standards and goals for itself and strives to reach those goals. All cops in 
this state are familiar with the "code of ethics" and it really means something 
to most of us. 
</P>
<P>
I feel that Jackson is out of line in his pursuit of "justice." He is abusing 
his status as a peace officer. It is not his job to seek out, incite, exploit, 
"blow the whistle" or "point the finger" at others. 
</P>
<P>
As a female in a predominately male profession, I can attest to the fact that 
there have been and continue to be negative barriers to surmount. The best way 
to effect change is to work from within the structure. Sgt. Jackson has at 
least attained rank which is something that still eludes many women officers. 
As a minority myself, I have been more acutely aware of the plight of other 
minorities. Change is slow, but it does happen. 
</P>
<P>
It is unfair to criticize an entire professional group based on what can be 
safely called a media ploy. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Jackson's motivation is very clear to me. He is avenging himself on the 
profession that he believes has wronged him. It is very sad, indeed, that he 
has duped the media, various watchdog organizations and especially some of the 
public using the race issue as his focal point.

Looking at the millions of dollars spent on himself -- via the inaugural

PRESIDENT BUSH'S INAUGURAL ADDRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The inauguration speech of President Bush was filled with lovely words, 
promising thoughts and spirited allusions to new breezes. Over the years, 
however, I have seen that words are cheap, kept promises rare, and the breezes 
have often been an ill wind. Politicians have distorted the truth for so long 
that citizens now expect less than ethical behavior from them. When compassion, 
justice and truth prevail in our government, I will regain my faith in 
inaugural promises. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, others tell me to give President Bush a chance even if no one 
really expects him to reduce the deficit, feed the hungry, house the homeless 
and eliminate drug abuse in the U.S. It occurs to me, however, that if we have 
the money and will to engage in the Iran-Contra deal and build 132 Stealth 
Bombers at $500 million apiece, then we certainly have the ability and the 
money to feed the hungry, house the homeless and effectively fight drug abuse. 
It is all a matter of what we choose to do. 
</P>
<P>
Saying that the U.S. is the best country when compared to others in the world 
is no excuse for complacency, for we should always strive to improve. There is 
always room for improvement. I pray that President Bush uses his power to 
perpetuate "truth, justice and the American way." If President Bush wants to 
inspire a thousand points of light, he must be a beacon for all Americans, 
revealing a "kinder and gentler nation" through integrity and a renewed respect 
for government institutions.

<P>
Some thoughts on the Long Beach police incident: 
</P>
<P>
* By law one must comply with any order issued by legal authority. 
</P>
<P>
* Control of a situation may entail more than a police request. 
</P>
<P>
* Long Beach police Officer Mark Dickey ought to be fired for being so stupid 
as to slam anyone into a glass window, destroying property, endangering himself 
and the suspect while losing control of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
* Activists like suspect Don Jackson are a pain for the prevailing majority but 
they are revered in this country for being the point men in effecting political 
change. They include personages such as Sam Adams, Paul Revere, Thomas 
Jefferson, the Quaker's Anne Hutchinson, the Minutemen, John Brown, the 
Abolitionists, Eugene V. Debs, Walter Reuther, Clarence Darrow, Amelia Bloomer, 
the Suffragettes, Theodore Roosevelt, Margaret Sanger, Upton Sinclair, Martin 
Luther King, Jackie Robinson, Eleanor Roosevelt -- just a small fraction of the 
troublemakers who now reside in the pantheon of American heroes.

I was saddened but not surprised to read of Jackson's racially motivated 
physical and verbal attack at the hands of the Long Beach Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago I was pulled over, in a very similar manner, in the city of Long 
Beach. When I objected to my arm being painfully twisted behind my back during 
a body search, I was handcuffed and punched. I endured anti-Hispanic racial 
epithets from the two white officers on the way to the station and when my 
blood alcohol level was found to be less than half the legal limit, a bogus 
traffic citation was issued for another offense. 
</P>
<P>
I found that to file a complaint, you must file it with the LBPD which 
consistently finds no wrongdoing by its officers.

But his effort to rationalize the huge budget deficits with the statement "we 
have more will than wallet" was upside down. We have the "wallet" to pay for 
what we're spending, but we don't want to. 
</P>
<P>
We've been brainwashed for eight years to believe we "don't deserve" to pay 
taxes and that government and its activities are the problem, not the solution. 
President Reagan has said these very words while observing we are in the midst 
of prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
He's taught Americans that, yes Virginia, there is a free lunch and your 
grandchildren deserve to pay for it. We don't want to.

COLUMN ON PLAYER'S DEATH TELLS A TOUCHING STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
People touch you in many ways. Mike Downey does it with words. 
</P>
<P>
Had Bobby Satterfield not died, I'd probably never have heard of the substitute 
Notre Dame halfback. I read of his passing in the next morning's paper. It was 
too bad; not much more. 
</P>
<P>
In Sunday morning's paper, Downey put it in perspective. His story brought 
tears. Suddenly I felt the loss of someone . . . and I'm not Irish, Catholic or 
black. 
</P>
<P>
It was great human interest. I, too, hope they can win one for Bobby 
Satterfield someday.

COLUMNIST'S VIEWPOINT IS WAY OFF THE MARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I seem to be one of the few who support John Thompson's walkout. Thompson acted 
on his beliefs. Other coaches were vocal but would not dare leave the fate of 
their teams in the hands of an assistant coach. . . . 
</P>
<P>
But the point everyone seems to be missing is the fact that a football or 
basketball player cannot make it to the NFL or NBA without going to college. Is 
it right to deprive these athletes of a chance at realizing a dream because of 
a test? 
</P>
<P>
I say keep Proposition 48 the way it is. Make the kids study and get their 
grades up to gain eligibility.

I'm no John Thompson fan. He has consistently refused to discipline or bench 
his players for instigating fights. 
</P>
<P>
But his principled stand, boldly demonstrated, on Proposal 42 is an entirely 
different matter. 
</P>
<P>
The protective, nurturing environment of an athletic dormitory, a demanding 
coach and a change in environment can mean the difference in a young athlete's 
life. 
</P>
<P>
To bar a skilled athlete from a scholarship and force the athlete to navigate 
the junior college system, or find means to pay for his/her education to 
improve scholastically is to drastically diminish the athlete's chance for 
improvement.

<P>
Has anyone asked what happens when these unprepared kids get into the 
classroom? I have sat in class with them. Most are so intimidated that they 
dissolve into the floor. Soon it's as if they weren't even there. 
</P>
<P>
But something worse happens when the unprepared student tries to learn. Caught 
between his lack of preparation and the demands of his sport, he can't keep up 
with the class. The harder he tries, the more questions he asks, and the whole 
class bogs down. When that happens, it is not fair to the students who have 
paid and worked to earn the right to be in that class. 
</P>
<P>
Proposal 42 may be unfair, but it is necessary. I am not suggesting that those 
students who are affected by Proposal 42 be sacrificed. However, I believe the 
answer lies in preparing them before they get to college. 
</P>
<P>
What really bothers me about the reaction to the proposal is that its critics 
are implying that these kids are too stupid to meet the requirements. I refuse 
to believe that.

The importance Pete Rozelle put on the Super Bowl and related festivities was

WRITER FAILS TO SEE ALL DIMENSIONS OF SUPER BOWL

In Monday morning's Super Bowl wrap-up, Bob Oates describes Joe Montana as "the 
greatest come-from-behind quarterback the game has known." 
</P>
<P>
Fame is fleeting. 
</P>
<P>
How soon we forget! 
</P>
<P>
Montana is great at performing last-minute heroics, but certainly he is no 
better at beating the clock than Baltimore's Johnny Unitas. Unitas had Raymond 
Berry to throw to, but Berry is no Jerry Rice.

<P>
I thought that I saw an exciting, hard-fought Super Bowl this year between two 
evenly matched teams. After reading Bob Oates' analysis, I guess I stand 
corrected. 
</P>
<P>
First off, Oates states that Cincinnati peaked at midseason and that it 
remained in this game only by virtue of San Francisco "misplays" (which 
amounted to zero turnovers). 
</P>
<P>
Then he pondered the question, "Will Super Bowl XXIII be remembered for the 
49ers' mediocre performance in the first three quarters?" 
</P>
<P>
I managed to pick up a pair of three-dimensional glasses to watch the halftime 
show. 
</P>
<P>
I'd like to know where Oates was able to find a pair of one-dimensional glasses 
to watch the rest of the game.

HALL AND DOUBLE STANDARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After commenting on TV talk show host Arsenio Hall's use of racial dialect, 
Times critic Howard Rosenberg asks: "Isn't it a double standard to criticize as 
racist such dialect when a script writer employs it as black dialogue when at 
the same time someone like Hall is using it on national television?" ("Bedtime 
for Talk? Nothing Special on Sajak, Hall Shows," Jan. 16.) 
</P>
<P>
Hall and some other comedians don't seem to realize black racism is no better 
than white racism; plus they send bad signals to kids who desperately need role 
models (such as the praiseworthy Bill Cosby) who speak well.

<TEXT>
<P>
In reference to Diane Haithman's Jan. 9 article, "NBC's Tartikoff Takes Heat 
for Rivera's Satanism Show": I am leading a grass-roots movement for an annual 
national TV blackout -- a blackout for one day to send a signal to the networks 
that we demand better programming. 
</P>
<P>
I consider watching TV an unhealthy habit, not unlike smoking. There is an 
annual "smoke out" to help smokers -- why not an annual blackout to help TV 
addicts?

FACES. . .: JUST A PHASE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you quickly scan over the career of singer-actress Cleo Laine, you might 
tend to break it down into phases. 
</P>
<P>
There was the jazz band singing phase with the Johnny Dankworth Seven. (Laine 
and Dankworth are still musical and marriage partners.) There was the theater 
phase when Laine became a sudden sensation on London's West End in the '60s. 
Then there was the recording phase when Laine and Dankworth cut such landmark 
discs as "Shakespeare and All That Jazz" and "I Am a Song." Most recently 
there's been the annual U.S. concert tour phase: The Laine-Dankworth combo have 
unfailingly played Los Angeles every year since 1973. 
</P>
<P>
So is her role as The Witch in Stephen Sondheim's musical fairy tale, "Into the 
Woods," at the Ahmanson Theatre -- following on her Princess Puffer in "The 
Mystery of Edwin Drood" -- a return to her theater phase? 
</P>
<P>
"There are no phases," she says, "only phone calls. You don't really plan the 
changes in your life. Offers over the phone have constantly thrown me into 
things. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, I developed my acting and singing equipment. When called upon, I could 
deliver. And doing these many things helps for longevity in a business that 
does everything to make one's life short." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Laine's 38 years of performing before audiences resists any pattern. 
Jazz gigs will alternate with operetta assignments, which will be squeezed in 
between recordings such as her 1988 tribute, "Cleo Sings Sondheim." Her first 
contact with the composer-lyricist was more than 10 years ago, when the 
Michigan 
</P>
<P>
Opera Company staged "A Little Night Music." 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't covet any of the roles in his work," she says, "but what I admired in 
him was the thing I've striven for in my own work, which is an equal respect 
for music and words. And some of my best work, and his, was the least popular. 
But what advances the art is when artists show a love for material that 
audiences don't immediately love." 
</P>
<P>
True to form, Laine next plans to go out of "The Woods" and into the world of 
women songwriters for a record titled "Woman to Woman." 
</P>
<P>
"If I get my way," she says with a sly wink, "the rhythm section" -- which 
includes her husband -- "will pose for the album cover in drag." ROBERT KOEHLER

OPENING OF PACIFIC SERENADES CHAMBER SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGG WAGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pianist Delores Stevens, horn player Richard Todd and violinist Debra Price 
presented four chamber works Thursday evening for the opening concert of 
Pacific Serenades' third season. Taking place in the ornate, at times noisy, 
Crystal Room of the Biltmore Hotel, the concert included the world premiere of 
Roger Bourland's "Recent Dreams," a fantasy for this combination of 
instruments. 
</P>
<P>
"Recent Dreams" makes few bold statements, shying away from any new frontiers 
of music-making. Writing in an immediately accessible tonal language, Bourland 
obviously drew much of his influence from film music -- a field to which he has 
contributed three scores. 
</P>
<P>
Whole-tone scales, a sudden, unannounced waltz and a few mild dissonant chords 
at times create curiosities that attempted to entice the listener. But the 
music rarely reflects a great deal of soul-searching or vision. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens, Todd and Price managed the gentle, dreamy music with expertise. Lush 
melodic fragments and various solo passages were given due attention and care 
even if the overall piece contained few, if any, moments of demanding 
virtuosity. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the centerpiece of the evening, Brahms' Trio in E-flat, gave 
the players a substantial workout. In the opening Andante and Scherzo, 
technical prowess was in abundance, sometimes at the expense of expressiveness. 
But the Finale achieved the right amount of ebullience leading the work to a 
satisfying conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the program was a stunning performance of Debussy's "Pour le Piano" 
suite by Stevens, who took the Toccata at a remarkably rapid clip. Opening the 
program, Stevens and Todd combined forces for a lively performance of 
Beethoven's Horn Sonata. GREGG WAGER

THE STEPS THAT LED TO MAKO'S RESIGNATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, Times Theater Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A concern with nepotism coupled with a desire to broaden the casting 
opportunities and the range, professionalism and horizons of East West Players 
appear to have been at the heart of the dispute between East West's board of 
directors and its founder-artistic producing director, Mako, who stepped down 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
In his letter of resignation, Mako, who founded the theater in 1965 and served 
until recently as its virtually unchallenged leader, outlined the reasons for 
his departure. He singled out three of five resolutions adopted by the board at 
its annual retreat on Oct. 22 that he says he "could not live with." 
</P>
<P>
One was the board's decision to make the position of managing director 
"parallel" to that of the artistic producing director, and both subject to 
supervision by the board. The second was the adoption of a policy limiting the 
participation in the theater of persons "related by blood or marriage" to board 
members or other theater employees. And third was the adoption of a policy 
limiting the artistic producing director to "directing, designing or performing 
in one production per season unless otherwise approved by the board." 
</P>
<P>
Mako's letter stated that he found these resolutions "contradictory in nature 
to the creative process" and "beyond the reality of running a theater on an 
everyday basis." 
</P>
<P>
"Even though they say that (limiting family participation) is a general 
policy," Mako elaborated Thursday, "I'm the only one with a wife who acts and 
directs and daughters who want to act. Perhaps they wanted to get rid of me. 
</P>
<P>
"This season was unique. We had to deal (with the Waiver disputes) with Equity. 
I had to be away on location during the annual retreat and I had instructed our 
administrator to discuss that (issue). Instead (the board) decided to table it 
and talk about nepotism." 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Wong, chairman of East West's board of directors, said Mako's 
resignation was expected. 
</P>
<P>
"We love Mako," he said. "He's held the company together. At no time did we 
want his achievement or his dignity to be diminished. But we had differences of 
opinion about the limits of authority. 
</P>
<P>
"He told us he could not live with any type of restriction from a board of 
directors. We noted some weakness in casting. The same people were being cast 
over and over again. We felt we needed to encourage the participation of more 
young people. Eighty percent of the people in the current production ("Laughter 
and False Teeth") are new. We did go over Mako's head and also selected a 
director (Robert Ito) who is new." 
</P>
<P>
These actions and the board's decision to pull a production of Naori Naho's 
"Potato Flowers Don't Bloom," which Mako had unilaterally decided to do, 
apparently brought matters to a head. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Potato Flowers Don't Bloom' is a play that was thrown on us without 
warning," Wong explained. "Mako informed us his wife (Shizuko Hoshi) was going 
to direct. And we had just told him we wanted more openness. We came 
head-to-head on it. It wasn't just a matter of artistic decision. We felt it 
was important to give more actors out there a break. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the problems were so great until Mako's daughters grew up. It 
was important for this change to occur. I think people on the outside have been 
waiting for it." 
</P>
<P>
Beulah Quo, a co-founder of the group with Mako and a former board member who 
served eight years as board president, was also not surprised by the events. 
</P>
<P>
"I was aware of the discussions," she said Thursday. "I'm deeply fond of Mako. 
We sat in many storefronts together. No one had his dogged perseverance. But 
people do get tired and the theater needs a new direction. It has to keep up 
with the times. 
</P>
<P>
"Our playwrights need to explore more than the (internment) camps. Theater has 
to reflect the community. There is a need to look at other Asians in this town 
and do productions that embrace the experiences of our new immigrants. We 
should have some nontraditional experimentation, regardless of race, color or 
creed, including blacks, Hispanics and Vietnamese. And we should try to develop 
an outreach program." 
</P>
<P>
As for the nepotism issue, "It's been the (focus) of a lot of the complaints," 
Quo said. "You can't use your family too much." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a search is on for a new artistic director. And the board's eye 
seems squarely focused on expansion keyed to East West's projected move to 
larger quarters downtown, as part of the First Street North redevelopment 
project that managing director Michele Garza says should happen in about three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to remain on good terms (with Mako)," Wong said. "I would hope he'd 
sit on the board and help us select a new artistic director. We want the best. 
The person doesn't even have to be Asian. Michele (Garza) is not Asian, but 
she's the best. We have to evolve. We have to grow." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he would participate in the theater, Mako's answer was qualified. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't say no," he said, "but at this point I'm not sure. As you know, boards 
rotate every few years. I'll be perfectly willing to work there again. In any 
capacity." 
</P>
<P>
Does he have allies on the board? 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I did, but 90% of the (board members) are not (allies)." 
</P>
<P>
Can he recommend who his successor should be? 
</P>
<P>
"I have no recommendation. I do not want to make their task (in choosing a 
successor) easier."

FACES. . .: 'MEMORY' TOUCHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS SADOWNICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anyone who heard the wizened outcast Grizabella sing "Memory" in the Los 
Angeles production of "Cats," might be astonished to actually meet the singer 
who immortalized her. With her whiskers off, Kim Criswell comes off more as the 
bouncy antebellum Scarlett O'Hara (she has a touch of her native Chattanooga in 
almost everything she says) than someone who's seen eight of her nine lives 
used up. 
</P>
<P>
Now that Criswell's no longer in "Cats" -- or any other musical for that matter 
-- the New York-based actress is experiencing a certain creative renaissance in 
her life. After a decade of singing lead roles in the original casts of such 
Broadway musicals as "The First," "Nine," "Baby" and "Stardust," the 33 
year-old performer is so seriously considering taking one of the TV and film 
opportunities being offered her now that she's become an Angeleno for good. 
</P>
<P>
But Criswell's not all smiles when it comes to talking about more personal 
reasons for settling down in her Silver Lake cottage. 
</P>
<P>
"New York has lost its vitality in the theater world," she explains, "in large 
part, due to AIDS. We've lost Michael Bennett and Charles Ludlam and I've lost 
so many friends. There's still a bit more life force in L.A." 
</P>
<P>
So Criswell's made a mini-career of appearing in AIDS benefits across the 
country, and a tradition of singing "Memory" in them, including at the AIDS 
Benefit for Being Alive at the Wilshire Ebell Theater on Fridayin Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"The figure I play in 'Cats,' " she says, "is not unlike a person with AIDS. 
Just listen to the lyrics: 'Touch me, it's so easy to leave me alone.' "

RINGO STARR CONDUCTS A NEW PBS SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No program that includes Ringo Starr narrating segments of the exceptional 
English animated series "Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends" can be bad. 
"Thomas" is the high point of the new PBS children's series "Shining Time 
Station," debuting today at 9 a.m. on Channel 28. 
</P>
<P>
There are no low moments, just ordinary ones, and that's surprising. So much 
talent has gone into the series that it reads like a who's who of children's 
programming. 
</P>
<P>
The cast includes Starr as a magical 18-inch-tall railroad conductor, Didi Conn 
("Grease") as the owner of a quaint old railway station, and Leonard Jackson 
("Ma Rainey's Black Bottom") as a stern but nice engineer. It is written by 
Emmy Award winner Brian McConnachie, "Reading Rainbow's" Ellis Weiner and 
"Wonderworks' " Alan Kingsberg, and it gets its charming look from Wayne White 
("Pee-wee's Playhouse"), Rosaria Sinisi ("The Cosby Show") and Michael Landry 
("Crocodile Dundee II"). 
</P>
<P>
Each episode contains two animated "Thomas" stories, the jukebox puppet band 
playing musical Americana, the Picture Machine showing a music video and a 
live-action plot aimed at children's concerns -- making friends, making 
mistakes, self-confidence. (Child actors Jason Woliner and Nicole Leach learn 
the lessons.) 
</P>
<P>
The live action is the problem. It is overly earnest, slightly forced, and Conn 
veers from sweet to cloying. The rest of the show, aimed at ages 4 to 7, is 
engaging; the trains are terrific. LYNNE HEFFLEY

COMIC-BOOK COLLECTING: AN ADDICTION FOR MANY AGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PENELOPE MOFFET 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A bitter wind is blowing through Los Angeles on Saturday morning as I arrive in 
Santa Monica at Hi De Ho Comics and Fantasy. A friend has agreed to be my 
guide, provided I don't name him, on this expedition to sample the mystique of 
comic-book collecting. 
</P>
<P>
Yet I feel a little worried as we start out. It's my friend's 37th birthday, 
and it's also only a few days since he's been paid: a dangerous combination for 
a man who's been collecting comic books for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Older, Collectible 
</P>
<P>
Inside Hi De Ho, rhythm-and-blues music plays loudly. T-shirts decorated with 
sayings such as "You're Mine, Slime!" and "Skate or Die" cover a wall, near 
racks of post cards, baseball cards, comic books under slightly battered tin 
signs that plead "Hey kids! Comics" and "Wholesome Comics." Many more new comic 
books fill wall racks, while high-priced older, collectible comics are 
displayed out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
"They've diversified since I was here last," my guide murmurs, as he gazes 
wistfully upward at Planet Comics 67 ($100) and Journey Into Mystery 
"Introducing . . . The Mighty Thor!" ($240). 
</P>
<P>
Southern California abounds in businesses catering to the dark desires of 
comic-book addicts and casual shoppers alike: stores, auctions, comics 
publishers, mail-order outlets and comics conventions. (For information about 
the Batman-themed Feb. 12 Los Angeles Comic Book and Science Fiction 
Convention, call (818) 954-8432.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
70 Area Stores 
</P>
<P>
But fans are kept most steadily supplied by about 70 comic-book stores in the 
Southland, and Hi De Ho, my guide tells me, offers an unusually wide variety of 
materials: many Golden Age (1930s through early 1950s) and Silver Age 
(post-1956) comic books mixed with underground comics, books of comic-strip 
reprints, new comics and comic-related paraphernalia, like Teenage Mutant Ninja 
Turtles dolls. 
</P>
<P>
This morning, half a dozen young and middle-aged men -- one with a baby in a 
carrier on his back -- are browsing. As the morning wanes, a handful of young 
boys carrying skateboards wanders in. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Hennessey, 39, established the store 12 years ago with his younger brother, 
Mark. 
</P>
<P>
"We were a couple of over-age adolescent boys who didn't give up our hobby," 
Hennessey says. They now have two stores (the other one is in Venice) and a 
warehouse and keep about 750,000 books in stock. 
</P>
<P>
"Adolescent boys are what American comic books have always been aimed at," ever 
since the books' debut in 1933, but today's comic-book publishers also are 
"finally convinced that there's a market other than 12-year-olds," Hennessey 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Today, young adults spend more on comics than teen-agers do, he says. The 
books' story lines aren't getting any more complex ("Story lines in comics are 
good guys and bad guys and morals"), but some characters -- including Swamp 
Thing, Batman and the newer anti-heroes -- are gaining in depth and texture. 
</P>
<P>
"Our best sellers remain the traditional comic books: X-men and Batman," 
Hennessey reports. However, his personal favorites include the contemporary 
books "The Watchmen" and "V For Vendetta," and a very recent comic book called 
"Brought to Light," which is based on the Iran-Contra controversy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reaching for His Wallet 
</P>
<P>
With a sinking heart, I notice my friend is at the cash register and he's 
reaching for his wallet. "What is it that makes comic books so fascinating to 
so many men?" I ask. (Statistics on numbers of comic-book collectors are hard 
to come by, but one comic-book retailer estimates -- perhaps wistfully -- that 
there are "1 or 2 million collectors" as well as many avid, but non-collecting, 
readers nationwide. The majority of comic-book readers are male.) 
</P>
<P>
Hennessey pauses, looking slightly puzzled. Then he says: "It's because they 
can adopt a character as their own and see right to the heart of the matter, 
without ambiguity. Or at least that's why it has an attraction to adolescent 
boys, and to me -- to traditional comics readers." 
</P>
<P>
Outside the store, I check to see how deeply into Hi De Ho's stock my guide has 
delved. He has purchased seven books, one from the 1940s and six contemporary 
comics, for about $30. 
</P>
<P>
Apprehensively, I drive on to the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The American Comic Book Co.'s main store in Studio City is a much smaller store 
than Hi De Ho. The company also has several warehouses and a larger store in 
Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ready for Rummaging 
</P>
<P>
Comic book racks line two long walls, and many long boxes sit in the middle of 
the room, ready to be rummaged through by collectors. Rock 'n' roll music plays 
softly. 
</P>
<P>
Several large glass cases display collectible baseball cards, and behind the 
counter is a wall covered with comics and pulp magazines: The Mod Squad, Doc 
Savage, Donald Duck, Fem Force, Archie's, Zap Comix, etc. Oversized paperback 
cartoon collections fill one bookcase near the door, and some comic-character 
toys and hardback books of old movie-poster reproductions are also for sale. 
</P>
<P>
The store, which is 16 years old, is co-owned by David Alexander and Terry 
Stroud. Many of the older comic books in their collection are shown in a 
catalogue rather than on the shelves. Alexander estimates that he has more than 
1 million older comic books as well as many comic-related materials in stock. 
Much of his business is mail order. 
</P>
<P>
Miraculously, we leave without buying anything. American has "a fairly strong 
old comic-book collection, but, unfortunately, you would have to request many 
of the books from the warehouse," my guide broods. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Memorabilia and Auctions 
</P>
<P>
Next stop is Collectors Showcase, on Vine Street near Hollywood Boulevard. Much 
of this store is devoted to movie memorabilia, but the company also is notable 
for its 10-year-old, 11-times-a-year comic-book auction, conducted through the 
mail and by telephone with 1,500 bidders around the world. Art from animated 
features and movie and comic memorabilia also are sold through the auction. 
</P>
<P>
Collectors is geared more to the serious collector than to the casual browser, 
although there's plenty to look at when you walk through the door. The 
comic-book section of the store is up a flight of stairs at the rear. 
</P>
<P>
The store has nearly 750,000 comic books in stock. My friend, who bids in 
almost every Collectors auction, has come to collect his loot from the last 
round. He pays an unspecified amount ("too much," he grumbles) for four 1940s 
comics and 50 1960s Thor comic books. 
</P>
<P>
We drive on to the Melrose Avenue location of Golden Apple Comics, which also 
has stores in Northridge and West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Golden Apple keeps a wide variety of mainly contemporary comic books, both 
American and foreign, in stock. Store owner Bill Liebowitz, whose business card 
lists him as "President and Big Kahuna," says his 10-year-old business ships in 
about 400 different comics each month. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the store maintains a 24-hour number, (213) 651-0455, with 
recorded information about upcoming special events. (On Sunday, for example, 
the West Los Angeles Golden Apple will host a free afternoon "baseball card 
trade-o-rama.") 
</P>
<P>
"This is an adult store; it's not a children's store. This is for collectors 
and people interested in fantasy and science-fiction entertainment," says 
Liebowitz, 47, who's wearing a yellow sweat shirt that reads "World Class 
Wrestling Championship Title Match 1947." 
</P>
<P>
Many of Golden Apple's customers favor all-black clothes, and several sport 
Mohawk hairdos. Hot items in the store are the slice-of-life comic book "Love 
and Rockets" and the futuristic "Yummy Fur," as well as anything to do with 
Batman. 
</P>
<P>
I try not to look when my guide materializes by the cash register, but I can't 
help myself. He has two 1940s Smilin' Jack comics, $17 and $25. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Average Age 25 
</P>
<P>
Liebowitz says that the average age of his customers is 25 and that the average 
household income is $25,000 per year. "Comic books' appeal no longer is limited 
to collectors of rare, vintage books or to speculators hoping for future 
profit," he says. In addition, Liebowitz says, 15% of his customers are female. 
</P>
<P>
Some say collecting comics is a kind of addiction. Alexander of the American 
Comic Book Co. concurs. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, my friend is hard-pressed to say why he likes comic books so 
much. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sort of like asking, 'Why do you love chocolate?' " he says. "As 
literature, comic books are unique. They can be appreciated for their artwork 
and story lines simultaneously."

WILL ROGERS' LEGACY; 
</P>
<P>
A HISTORIC PARK ON THE SITE OF THE FAMILY RANCH STANDS AS MEMORIAL TO THE 
COWBOY PHILOSOPHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Will Rogers was America's most complete human document. He reflected in many 
ways the heartbeat of America in thought and manner of appearance, and in his 
daily life he was probably our most typical native born, the closest living 
approach to what we like to call the true American. -- Damon Runyon 
</P>
<P>
Will Rogers captured America's heart and tickled its funny bone as a Ziegfeld 
Follies star, radio commentator, movie actor and the author of more than 2 
million words of wry commentary on life and politics, many of them in a daily 
column that appeared in more than 500 newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
But Rogers knew better than to take his fame too seriously. He didn't expect it 
to last forever. He once said: "There are no indispensable men, and there is 
always someone to take our place before our folks get home from the funeral." 
</P>
<P>
So perhaps he would be pleasantly surprised by the success of the park that 
bears his name. 
</P>
<P>
It's been more than 50 years since the "Cowboy Philosopher" died in a plane 
crash with aviator Wiley Post near Barrow, Alaska. Yet, each month more than 
20,000 people turn off Sunset Boulevard in the hills of Pacific Palisades to 
enjoy Will Rogers State Historic Park. 
</P>
<P>
The 186-acre park is a step back to the past, because the grounds and buildings 
have been preserved much as they were on Aug. 15, 1935, when Rogers died. A 
portion of the more than 300-acre ranch -- about 100 acres -- was donated to 
the state of California in 1944, after the death of his widow, Betty. The state 
gradually acquired an additional 86 acres. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Family Wanted to Donate Ranch 
</P>
<P>
"Mother always wanted it to be a memorial," oldest son Bill Rogers said from 
his ranch in Tubac, Ariz., "and it was quite expensive . . . just too much for 
a private person to keep up, and then we were splitting off, you see. When I 
graduated from college, I got married . . . and my brother (James) had his 
ranch out near Bakersfield and my sister (Mary) was gone (to live in Greece)." 
</P>
<P>
Today, this memorial to Rogers offers a variety of relaxing attractions. 
Visitors can enjoy participating in or watching polo or soccer on the grass 
polo field, hold a family picnic or relax on the spacious lawn, which once was 
a miniature golf course. They can explore the stables or hike into the hills -- 
all the way to adjoining 7,000-acre Topanga State Park. 
</P>
<P>
And they can learn about Will Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
A small theater shows a 12-minute film on Rogers' life, and "audio-wands" 
provide a narrated tour of the park, sprinkled with comments from family and 
friends of Rogers. Docents give tours through the family home, and a shop 
offers a number of hard-to-find books by and about Rogers. Other items include 
a lariat, with instructions on rope tricks, and audio tapes of Rogers' radio 
broadcasts and the one-man show in which James Whitmore portrayed Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
The centerpiece of the park is the ranch house, which started out as a small 
weekend cabin in 1924. After Rogers decided to move from his Beverly Hills home 
-- which he called "the house that jokes built" -- the ranch house underwent a 
series of additions and alterations until it grew to 31 rooms to accommodate 
his family and a platoon of friends and visitors. 
</P>
<P>
The living room, an impressive tribute to the Old West, occupies almost all of 
the first floor of one wing. A bronze on the mantel of the massive fireplace is 
the work of Western artist Charles Russell, Rogers' close friend, and the 
andirons, in the shapes of cowboys, were created by artist Edward Borein. Four 
Russell watercolors are in the living room amid horse tack, bolos from 
Argentina, Navajo baskets and blankets, and family photos. 
</P>
<P>
A rustic chandelier made from a pioneer-era neck yoke is above a heavy 
Spanish-style dining table, and recently restored Navajo blankets cover the 
hardwood floor beneath a Victorian red-wicker swing that hangs from the 
ceiling. An old cigar-store Indian sits in a corner, silently observing it all. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ziegfeld's Present 
</P>
<P>
The opposite end of the room has two major focal points: a floor-to-ceiling 
picture window and a staircase. The window was a present from Florenz Ziegfeld, 
a frequent visitor to the ranch. According to Rogers, Ziegfeld "liked the view, 
but he had to go out on the porch"; Ziegfeld had the window installed as a 
surprise for his "Follies" star. There's even a stuffed calf used for roping 
practice. The calf was a gift from artist Borein and the goal was to spare 
Rogers' friends, who were tired of him roping them. 
</P>
<P>
And this is just a sampling of the items in the room, which seems chock-full of 
artifacts, but Rogers' younger son Jim says the decor is "really quite sparse, 
compared to what it was at one time." Many items were moved to the Will Rogers 
Memorial in Claremore, Okla., where Rogers is buried. For instance, instead of 
the one saddle now slung over the stair railing, more than a dozen saddles once 
sat on racks in the living room. 
</P>
<P>
On guided tours, visitors travel through the family wing of the house, 
including a sitting room/music room, bedrooms and Rogers' study. A battered 
typewriter sits on a desk in the study, along with a metal sculpture of a polo 
player and books supported by horse bookends. The chair next to the desk holds 
a well-worn polo hat and polo balls, and a large free-standing globe has air 
routes traced on it in ink, including the fatal August, 1935, flight to Alaska. 
Photos of family and friends -- William S. Hart and W. C. Fields -- line the 
walls. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wrote on the Road 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, less of Rogers' writing was done here than one might think. Many of 
his columns were written with his typewriter perched on his knees, wherever he 
might be -- in an airplane, a car, on a movie set, on a world tour in Russia, 
South America, China or Japan. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, when Rogers was home he spent as much time as possible outside -- 
roping, playing polo, riding the trails or dining on the patio connecting the 
two wings of the ranch house. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a wonderful place to grow up," Jim Rogers recalls from his home in 
Bakersfield. "My great memories of the place are predominantly centered around 
the polo field, around the barn where we used to rope calves up in back." 
</P>
<P>
Both sons played polo with their father, and the Will Rogers Polo Club carries 
on the tradition on Saturdays at 2 p.m. and Sundays at 10 a.m., weather 
permitting. 
</P>
<P>

Cowboy's Sport 
</P>
<P>
It may seem incongruous to some that cowboy Rogers loved polo as much as he 
did, but not to attorney Joel Laden, who operates the stable concession at the 
park. He says polo is a cowboy's game and "the ultimate game" for anyone who 
loves to ride horses. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers also loved to ride trails up into the Santa Monica Mountains. Bill 
Rogers says his father was forever creating new trails. He would get a couple 
of ranch hands, point and say, "Now let's get a trail from here to there." 
Brush would be cleared and he would have a new trail. 
</P>
<P>
This was typical of the Will Rogers style of ranch planning, according to both 
sons. "Dad was very impatient about things," Jim recalls. "(If) he wanted 
something done, he wanted it done yesterday. And when he decided to do 
something, he just went ahead and did it." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Rogers says the tennis court next to the theater and docent shop is a 
perfect example. "It is not an official tennis court. You cannot play tennis on 
it. It's about 10 feet too short, and he didn't care." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plans for Park 
</P>
<P>
Today, careful planning must go into preserving the park and promoting Rogers 
and his ideals without changing the basic character of the historical site. 
</P>
<P>
Parking, for instance, is a problem because there are fewer than 500 parking 
spaces, and Pacific Palisades has prohibited weekend parking on nearby 
residential streets. On a warm, pleasant weekend, it's sometimes difficult to 
find a parking space in the afternoon. More parking spaces would make the park 
accessible to more people, but it also could change the character of the park. 
</P>
<P>
"We are now in the process of developing a general plan for this unit," says 
Terry Brann, supervising ranger for the East Sector of the state parks' Santa 
Monica Mountains District. 
</P>
<P>
He hopes the plan will include ways to draw more park visitors into the house 
and visitors' center. He sees the park as "a piece of American history that's 
unique," but rangers have conducted informal surveys of visitors and discovered 
that the majority of the people are there to enjoy the recreational activities 
and aren't aware of Rogers' life. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Educational Purpose 
</P>
<P>
That is something that Jo Ann Wilkinson, president of the 140-member Will 
Rogers Docents, wants to change. "I think it's a teaching thing more than a 
playground," Wilkinson says. "I think the historical part is much more 
important." 
</P>
<P>
Wilkinson, a Pacific Palisades resident and a self-proclaimed Will Rogers 
"addict," says her docents serve as history teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the fun of being a docent at a historical site, Wilkinson says, is that 
"pretty soon you realize you are helping keep that thing intact. You are an 
important part of history yourself, by being there." 
</P>
<P>
One docent who literally has embraced the Rogers persona is actor Ben Wilson, 
who resembles Rogers. Originally from Alabama, Wilson first visited the park 
about a year ago, purchased one of Rogers' books and began to develop a 
program, including rope tricks. He's developed Rogers' rhythm and mannerisms; 
when conducting tours, he dresses in jeans and denim jacket and wears a 
well-worn hat atop his sandy-blond hair. He performed at the docents' party 
honoring Rogers' birthday on Nov. 4 and hopes to develop a program he can take 
to local schools and eventually perform on stage. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkinson believes the fun part about Rogers is that "he pretends to be the 
humble boy . . . just a poor country fella. The real thing is that he was very 
sophisticated, very deep philosophically. And if you really look at the things 
he said, they're very intellectual." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Current Events 
</P>
<P>
Most of Rogers' humor was based on current events, with many barbs at the press 
and politicians. His stage routines, lectures and columns frequently started 
with: "All I know is what I read in the papers." 
</P>
<P>
Grammar or no grammar, his comments were insightful, and much of what he said 
and wrote about current events more than half a century ago still applies 
today. For instance: 
</P>
<P>
"Any man that thinks civilization has advanced is an egotist. We've got more 
toothpaste on the market and more misery in our courts than at any time in our 
existence." 
</P>
<P>
Or: "You can't say civilization don't advance . . . for in every war they kill 
you in a new way." 
</P>
<P>
Or: "Politics ain't worrying this country one Tenth as much as parking space." 
</P>
<P>
"Never blame a legislative body for not doing something," he said. "When they 
do nothing, that don't hurt anybody. When they do something is when they become 
dangerous . . . Things in our country run in spite of government, not by the 
aid of it . . . We shouldn't elect a President; we should elect a magician." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Rogers says the lasting value of his father's words is based on "truisms, 
like Aesop's fables. Human nature never changes. People still go around making 
the same mistakes they made 10,000 years ago and will make 10,000 years from 
today, if we're still here."

S. AFRICA TALKS TO MANDELA ABOUT HOW TO FREE HIM WITHOUT TRIGGERING RIOTS

<P>
The government is talking to jailed black nationalist leader Nelson R. Mandela 
about ways to effect his release without triggering bloody riots, Information 
Minister Christoffel van der Merwe said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried by the independent South African Press Assn., Van der 
Merwe said, "The situation that could lead to Mr. Mandela's release is being 
discussed with him, and it is being discussed in government circles." 
</P>
<P>
He added that he could not promise that Mandela, leader of South Africa's 
outlawed African National Congress, would be freed this year, however. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela, 70, was jailed for life in 1964 for sabotage and plotting to overthrow 
the country's white-led minority government. 
</P>
<P>
"If we just released him today . . . it would undoubtedly have the result that 
people would get killed. We have to create a situation where that will not be 
the result," Van der Merwe said. 
</P>
<P>
The minister declined to say why he believes Mandela's release would cause 
riots and deaths. 
</P>
<P>
Van der Merwe said Justice Minister Hendrik J. Coetsee, who is known to get on 
well with Mandela, is seeking his cooperation to avoid bloodshed after his 
release. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela's lawyer, Ismail Ayob, said it is absurd to suggest that releasing his 
client would cause deaths and said he was not aware of discussions with the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they are just looking for excuses yet again not to release Mandela. 
There would be a great outpouring of joy at his release after serving two or 
three life sentences, but I cannot imagine why even one person would die," Ayob 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Mandela is not in jail anymore; he is in detention," Van der Merwe said. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela's wife, Winnie, said earlier this year that he was more isolated and 
lonely in the comfortable prison house he now inhabits than he had ever been in 
jail.

KABUL, Afghanistan 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three nations announced Friday they will follow the U.S. decision to pull its 
diplomats out of Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
France, Italy and Britain made separate announcements of their intentions to 
leave Kabul. Japan made a similar announcement earlier Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Afghan government responded by criticizing the closings, with the Soviet 
news agency Tass reporting that the decisions reflect an attempt to undermine 
international confidence in the Soviet-backed government. 
</P>
<P>
Italy said it will temporarily close its embassy in Kabul as soon as an Italian 
journalist seriously injured in Afghanistan can leave, a Foreign Ministry 
official said in Rome. 
</P>
<P>
Tass, in a dispatch from Kabul, quoted an Afghan Foreign Ministry statement 
charging that the closure of embassies on security grounds in view of the 
imminent departure of Soviet troops is unjustified. 
</P>
<P>
It said the Afghan army "is successfully defending the cities and provinces 
from where Soviet troops have already left." 
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, the decisions of Western states can only be assessed as an attempt 
to sap the trust of international public opinion in the ability of the state 
authorities to defend the city from extremists." 
</P>
<P>
Tass also reported that a child was killed and several buildings damaged in a 
rocket attack on the Afghan capital Friday. It said five rockets hit the city, 
one destroying a school. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov flew in on a previously 
unannounced visit, less than three weeks before the last of his troops are due 
to leave the country. 
</P>
<P>
A Soviet Embassy official said Yazov immediately went into conference with 
President Najibullah, but he could give no further details. 
</P>
<P>
Not all diplomats are happy at the prospect of recall. 
</P>
<P>
"People talk rubbish," one French envoy commented. "It's beautiful weather. 
There are no rockets. It's very quiet now. Kabul is like the French Riviera. I 
feel on vacation here."

LUMP OF ICE MAY HAVE CAUSED CRASH OF BRITISH JETLINER

<P>
Aircraft specialists searching for the cause of the Boeing 737 crash in central 
England say a lump of ice may have smashed the main fan of one of the engines, 
the Times of London reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Jan. 8 crash near the village of Kegworth killed 46 people, including a 
woman who died of her injuries Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The paper, however, said detailed analysis of the British Midland Airways 
plane's two engines by engineers from the French company SNECMA have not 
produced any conclusive cause for the break-up of the plane's left engine. 
</P>
<P>
SNECMA builds the CFM-56 engines with General Electric Co. The engines of the 
jet are being examined at the headquarters of SNECMA near Paris. 
</P>
<P>
"Investigators are relying on two theories, that it was damaged after being 
struck by a foreign body, possibly ice from the waste pipe of the forward 
lavatory, or that the blades suffered metal fatigue," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
"The engineers have found nothing wrong with the jet's right engine and no 
evidence to explain why the crew shut it down," it said. 
</P>
<P>
The crew shut down the right engine of the plane while the left engine caught 
fire. News reports have said investigators are examining the possibility of 
faulty electronics.

COMPROMISE ON EXPANSION SOUGHT; 
</P>
<P>
TRI-CITY HOSPITAL HOPES TO AVOID DEVELOPER FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE YASUDA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Administrators at Oceanside's Tri-City Medical Center are trying to reach a 
compromise with city officials to avoid paying as much as $1 million in fees 
for public improvements that the city says will be needed to accommodate the 
facility's $20-million expansion. 
</P>
<P>
In December, when the city planning commission approved Tri-City Hospital 
District's plans to enlarge its main facility by 105,000 square feet, it also 
instructed the district to pay the fees that go into the city's coffers for 
capital improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital administrators immediately balked at the size of the fees and 
questioned the commission's actions because they say the hospital district had 
never before been required to pay such fees. 
</P>
<P>
An appeal to overrule the decision was immediately submitted to the City 
Council by hospital officials. Since then, hospital and city staff members have 
been negotiating to resolve the dispute on their own. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Shocking and Disappointing' 
</P>
<P>
"It was shocking and disappointing. . . . I think those are accurate terms to 
describe our reaction to the fees, especially because we had not had fees 
imposed upon us before," said Richard Hachten, chief executive officer of 
Tri-City Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Since the hospital opened at 4002 W. Vista Way in 1961, it has undergone three 
major renovations that have expanded it to 438 beds from its original 87, said 
Wayne Wilson, the medical center's marketing director. 
</P>
<P>
In each case, the medical center was not charged public improvement fees, 
Wilson said. The new expansion will not increase the number of beds, but 
includes construction of an emergency ward, four additional surgery suites and 
a women's center. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital district hopes to have the new facilities in operation by 1993. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Fees Added by City 
</P>
<P>
To ensure that Oceanside's booming growth is properly managed, and that 
construction of public facilities keep pace with development, city officials 
have added public improvement fees and increased existing fees during the last 
five years, city engineer Ron Beckman said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say both private and public developers must share the burden of 
financing such improvements, and, therefore, planned to have the hospital 
district pay the fees. 
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to deal fairly with those who will impact our infrastructure, 
and certainly the hospital will," City Manager Ron Bradley said. "We are only 
trying to establish a sense of equity between both public and private 
developers." 
</P>
<P>
Both parties said attempts to reach a compromise have been proceeding smoothly 
and that they hope the problem will be resolved next month. If a compromise is 
reached and hospital officials withdraw their appeal, the City Council will not 
have to address the issue, Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
"My staff is looking at the fees and is trying to determine, from the city's 
standpoint, what is fair and reasonable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hachten added: "I think there has been 
</P>
<P>
recognition by the city that a hospital district is different from a developer 
and that it should be handled separately. There is a real commitment to resolve 
this in an amicable way." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, to help reach a compromise, the hospital district has expressed a 
willingness to donate a 17,000-square-foot strip of property along Vista Way 
that the city has targeted for expansion. According to Hachten, the property is 
worth at least $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
City officials have confirmed such an offer and said it would be considered. 
</P>
<P>
"But right now, it's premature to say what the final resolution will be," 
Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, the hospital district opposed the planning commission's actions, 
arguing that it was inappropriate to charge fees against their expansion 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Hachten argues that public improvement fees should be charged against 
development projects that would create additional "physical impact" on the 
city, not against a project that is only trying to serve existing needs. 
</P>
<P>
"For example, a new housing development would attract more people, more sewage, 
more cars," Hachten said. "But our hospital district, unlike the developer, is 
not creating a new demand or impacting the community. We are merely responding 
and accommodating current needs." 
</P>
<P>
City officials justify the fees, saying that the enlarged facility will attract 
more patients. But Hachten says future increases in the number of patient 
visits are unrelated to the facility's expansion. 
</P>
<P>
"Any additional growth will come whether or not we expand," Hachten said. "As 
the community grows, so will the number of our patients. We have no control 
over that." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Hachten said, the hospital district does not plan to draw more 
patients and is only trying to alleviate existing overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just trying to catch up," Hachten said of the expansion plans. Last 
year, the Tri-City Hospital District board of directors issued a $20-million 
bond to finance the project. 
</P>
<P>
"Although we do see some merit in their argument, we're not totally convinced 
that their expansion will not impact our infrastructure," said Bradley, the 
city manager. "Indeed, we believe it will."

BIG BOARD TAKES TO BLACKBOARD FOR ELEMENTARY LESSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wall Street, embodied in the three-piece-suited chief of the New York Stock 
Exchange, came to San Diego's Sherman Elementary School Friday, and 60 
fifth-graders were ready. 
</P>
<P>
They wore their red T-shirts emblazoned with the initials NYSE. And they had 
their questions. 
</P>
<P>
Squirming impatiently in their seats, the children took their best shots at 
John J. Phelan Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of the stock exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Do you think Japan will be the richest country in the world? one bright and 
somewhat apprehensive student asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, no, I think the United States will be," Phelan answered. "Looking at all 
of you, why would I think the Japanese would be better than you are?" 
</P>
<P>
All right, then, asked another, what about the stock market, do you think it 
will crash? 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly hope not," Phelan said. "We do very well, then we do too well 
sometimes . . . (and the market) gets over-extended and then it gets 
under-extended." 
</P>
<P>
OK, so how do you become a stockbroker? Phelan was asked. It's not easy, he 
replied. In fact, it's a lot of work. But above all, he said, you have to 
"understand the fundamentals of being able to read, write and do mathematics, 
and that will help you in any business." 
</P>
<P>
In his way, Phelan was trying to help the students do just that. The children, 
part of a special magnet program at the school that emphasizes business and 
government, are in the midst of a two-month study of the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
They are being taught the concepts of profit and loss, investment, finance, and 
loans and interest. And those in the fourth through sixth grades are even 
making interest on money they have in individual accounts through a special 
agreement between the school and Great American First Savings Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Phelan was inspired to speak at Sherman Elementary after the senior vice 
president of the NYSE, Peter D. Moore, told Phelan that he was impressed by a 
visit to the school he made last year. Phelan was in town for a three-day 
meeting of the Securities Regulation Institute held in Coronado. 
</P>
<P>
Study of the stock market began Jan. 17 and will continue through March, said 
Dennis W. Doyle, the school's vice principal. 
</P>
<P>
"The stock market is even difficult for us as adults to understand," said 
Cecilia Estrada, principal of San Diego's newest magnet school, "but with our 
lesson plan, we bring it down to the children's level so they can understand 
how it works." 
</P>
<P>
Just how much of this economic curriculum will kids remember? Quite a lot, said 
teacher Steve Antti. In just two months, the students may know more about the 
ins and outs of the stock market than the average citizen learns in a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids will be walking away from this unit with the knowledge of how stocks and 
prices go up and down," Antti said. "They can actually read how many stocks 
were traded. The main retention for them is that they'll be able to say, 
'There's something more I can do with my money.' " 
</P>
<P>
Phelan's visit was especially meaningful for the children, said Thomas W. 
Payzant, school district superintendent. "This is an opportunity for children 
in San Diego city schools to have direct access to a person who has a very 
important role in business and dealing with issues in our economy. They are 
able to learn (about) the stock exchange and meet one of the people who makes 
that stock exchange happen." 
</P>
<P>
As part of his visit, Phelan not only fielded questions but also toured the 
elementary school in Golden Hill, which began its magnet program in July to 
attract Anglo students and better integrate the student body, Doyle said. The 
students also learn to speak Spanish, and teachers plan to add Japanese to the 
curriculum next year. 
</P>
<P>
On the tour, Phelan greeted third- and fourth-graders who formed their own 
business during the holidays making wrapping paper and gift bags to sell for 25 
cents. They learned the principle of supply and demand rapidly: Phelan bought a 
dollar's worth of their gift bags at a special "after Christmas sale" price of 
5 cents each. So far, their business has grossed $178. 
</P>
<P>
Phelan said he left Sherman Elementary with an "optimistic feeling" that gave 
him "great hope for the country and for the future." He added that he was 
encouraged by the computer skills the students were learning. 
</P>
<P>
"It's wonderful to see people in kindergartens and first- and second-graders 
learning to become computer literate, because, by the time they grow up, that 
will be a way of life. . . . I have people who work for me who can't do that," 
Phelan said. 
</P>
<P>
Phelan also lauded the school's bilingual program. "What they're learning here 
is not irrelevant to life. They are teaching basic skills to be able to 
survive. (Not knowing other languages) has been a great inhibitor to trade and 
commerce," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the school emphasizes business, Doyle was careful to note that the 
curriculum covers other subjects. "These children are going to be future 
leaders in business and in government," he said. "The government aspect is 
civic consciousness. . . . They're not going to be yuppies."

 BRAWL ERUPTS OVER GIRL'S POPULARITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police said a dispute over a pretty girl's popularity erupted into a brawl 
involving more than a dozen teen-age girls, leaving five injured. 
</P>
<P>
Two girls were in stable condition at San Gabriel Valley Medical Center 
recovering from stabbings with an unknown weapon, said Pat Inbody, director of 
public relations. One was wounded in the abdomen and buttocks, the other in the 
chest. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute began Thursday when one student challenged another to fight because 
of her beauty and popularity with boys at San Gabriel Valley High School, Lt. 
James Gardner said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is probably the result of a cat fight," Gardner said. "Usually it's a 
hair-pulling, name-calling kind of thing and nobody gets hurt." 
</P>
<P>
"This time, some girls got hurt, and that's the sad thing." 
</P>
<P>
The attractive girl brought her friends to Vincent Lugo Park sometime after 
noon Thursday to call a truce but instead the rumble ensued. In all, about 12 
to 15 Asian girls, ages 14 and 15, were involved, Gardner said. 
</P>
<P>
The girls were not identified. Besides the two who were hospitalized, three 
others were treated for minor injuries and then released from the hospital, 
Inbody said.

ACCORD REACHED ON RECYCLING CAR AIR-CONDITIONING REFRIGERANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAUREEN FAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency announced an unprecedented agreement 
Friday among the automobile industry, government and environmental groups on a 
standard of purity for recycled refrigerant used in car air conditioners, the 
single largest source of ozone depletion in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Air-conditioning refrigerant in cars, trucks and other motor vehicles is made 
with chlorofluorocarbons, chemicals that, when released into the upper 
atmosphere, destroy the ozone, a protective layer between the Earth and the 
sun's ultraviolet rays. 
</P>
<P>
About 19% of all CFCs come from vehicle air conditioners, said Stephen 
Andersen, chief of the EPA's engineering and economics branch. 
</P>
<P>
The standard of purity, approved by the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Assn. and 
Saab-Scania of America after extensive testing under EPA supervision, is 15 
parts per million of moisture and 4,000 parts per million of oil. Approval of 
new recycling equipment had been denied by Underwriters Laboratories because of 
the lack of an industry standard. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made at a press conference during a Mobile Air 
Conditioning Society convention held at the Town and Country Hotel in San 
Diego. Industry was credited with putting aside its own interests and moving 
rapidly, and one environmentalist called the announcement a "refreshing blast 
of clean air." 
</P>
<P>
Service stations, motivated by the increasing costs of refrigerant as well as 
concern for the environment, are expected to switch to the new equipment within 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
The new equipment can cost from $3,400 to $6,000, but manufacturers say it is 
not any more expensive than the recharging equipment now used by many stations. 
</P>
<P>
Because the recycling equipment has not been available until now, stations have 
been releasing CFCs directly into the atmosphere when they repair air 
conditioners. 
</P>
<P>
Andersen likened the amount of contamination now allowed to that which would 
come from the air conditioner of a 1-year-old car that had logged 15,000 miles. 
Such a car would be "pretty clean," and the result would be little CFC leakage, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Andersen said service-station owners will also be motivated by the prospect of 
attracting large contract customers, such as rental car companies and 
corporations that own fleets of cars. And, if the voluntary agreement to 
recycle doesn't work, the EPA may make the equipment mandatory by 1992 among 
all who service car air conditioners. 
</P>
<P>
"At least this gives people a choice. This has made available the opportunity 
to choose recycling," Andersen said. 
</P>
<P>
Liz Cook, project director of the ozone campaign at Friends of the Earth, a 
Washington-based environmental group, said she welcomes voluntary efforts to 
recycle the refrigerant, but said the group would "absolutely like to see it be 
required." 
</P>
<P>
Finding service centers that use the new equipment will probably be difficult 
this year, but Simon Oulouhojian, executive director of the Mobile Air 
Conditioning Society, said he expects every such shop in the country to have 
the equipment within three years. 
</P>
<P>
Art Hobbs, project manager at Murray Corp., which makes refrigerant recycling 
equipment, said about 250 units are in the field. Mark Pfleeger, sales manager 
for Robinair, said his company has roughly 400 units in use. 
</P>
<P>
The motor vehicle manufacturers' group represents Chrysler Corp., Ford Motor 
Co., Honda of America, General Motors, Navistar International Transportation 
Corp., Paccar Inc. and Volvo North America Corp.

SUSPECT EXTRADITED IN TASK FORCE CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Coos Bay, Ore., man was extradited to San Diego on Friday in connection with 
the attempted murder of a Chula Vista woman, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
An investigation by the San Diego Metropolitan Homicide Task Force led to the 
arrest Wednesday of Glesty Donald Waters, 35, a mechanic. Waters lived for 
several years in National City before moving two years ago to Coos Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies said Waters allegedly assaulted Helen Ruth Toy on Jan. 6, 
strangling her to the point of unconsciousness. Toy was released from the 
hospital the day of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Waters' bail has been set at $300,000. He was expected to be booked into County 
Jail Friday. Sgt. Liz Foster said Waters is being held on suspicion of 
attempted murder, assault with a deadly weapon, robbery and kidnaping.

TOTAL OF $4,500 TAKEN; 
</P>
<P>
SUSPECT ARRESTED IN 1 OF 3 BANK HEISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
About $4,500 was taken in three unrelated bank robberies Friday, and a North 
Park man was arrested in one of the holdups, San Diego police said. 
</P>
<P>
Gustavo Gonzales, 27, of the 3700 block of Grim Avenue, was held on suspicion 
of robbing the Glendale Federal Bank at 5980 El Cajon Blvd., police said. The 
robbery occurred about 11:30 a.m. when the robber handed a note to a teller, 
who turned over $371 in booby-trapped cash. 
</P>
<P>
As the robber left the bank, carrying the money in a camera bag, a dye pack 
exploded inside the bag and began spewing red smoke. That caught the eye of 
Thomas Schultheis, an off-duty campus police lieutenant from San Diego State 
University, who followed Gonzales a few blocks to the 5900 block of Madison 
Avenue, where he held the man until police arrived. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Bill Robinson said police believe the robbery was the 10th in a 
series committed by Gonzales since November. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales was turned over to FBI officials, who are expected to charge him with 
10 counts of bank robbery. He was being held at the Metropolitan Correctional 
Center downtown. 
</P>
<P>
About an hour and a half after the Glendale robbery, a man walked into the Bank 
of America at 3101 University Ave., fired a shotgun over a teller's head and 
made off with $1,300, police said. No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
The man, described as white, in his late 20s, about 6 feet tall and 185 pounds, 
escaped in a metallic blue Chevrolet Celebrity. He was wearing a blue baseball 
cap and had a female passenger in the getaway car. Police said he robbed the 
same bank Jan. 11. 
</P>
<P>
Another Bank of America, at 645 Beyer Way in San Ysidro, was robbed Friday when 
a man handed a note to a teller and put his hand inside his black leather 
jacket to indicate he had a weapon. He got away with $2,863, which he placed in 
a brown shaving kit, police said. 
</P>
<P>
That robber was described as in his early 20s; 5 feet, 6 inches tall; 130 
pounds; with sandy-brown, shoulder-length hair and hazel eyes.

HART BACKS HOMEOWNERS IN FAIR DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A conflict over a new home for the San Fernando Valley Fair could be looming 
between two state senators who represent the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana) wants the fair to move permanently to Pierce 
College in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
But Sen. Gary Hart (D-Santa Barbara) doesn't. Pierce College is in his Senate 
district -- and he heads the Senate's powerful Education Committee, which helps 
oversee the financing of public schools. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins has urged Los Angeles Community College District officials to allow the 
fair to permanently move to a 30-acre corner of the Pierce College farm. 
</P>
<P>
In a Jan. 5 letter to college administrators, Robbins suggested that the fair 
"would complement the fine agricultural program currently offered" at Pierce 
and could be welcomed without subjecting the campus farmland to other 
development pressures. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby homeowners who are opposed to the move have vowed to fight such a 
relocation plan. They contend that the fair will congest their neighborhoods 
and could add to pressures to develop the 200-acre Pierce farm. 
</P>
<P>
Hart, who met Thursday night with Woodland Hills Homeowners Organization 
members, said he sides with the homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me preservation of open space at Pierce College is an important 
environmental goal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hart suggested that any further development of college land should be 
"consistent with the school's educational mission." Accommodating the fair 
"doesn't seem to be the best way to proceed," Hart said. 
</P>
<P>
"With this valuable piece of property, the pressures on the college district 
are enormous," he said. "Based on conversations I've had with the district, I'd 
be surprised if the college district goes along with the fair. " 
</P>
<P>
That means that "the fair has a problem, because time is growing short," Hart 
said.

THREE FROM SAME FAMILY KEYS TO ORGANIZATION'S FUTURE

SALINAS, Puerto Rico 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Enough about these Alomar men. Enough about this Padre father and his two Padre 
sons who, if they were any tighter or more talented, would cause the average 
San Diego family to injure itself rushing to the therapist. 
</P>
<P>
Spend 10 minutes in this washed-out little city on Caribbean Sea, in the 
middle-class house with the statue of Jesus in the front yard, and you sense 
any story should instead begin with two different, more important people. The 
Alomar women. 
</P>
<P>
Meet household boss Maria and her oldest child, Sandia (age 23), who have spent 
a lifetime doting and worrying over Sandy the Tough One, Sandy Jr. the 
Different One and Roberto the Intense One. 
</P>
<P>
Sandy, a former big-league second baseman, is the Padres' third base coach. 
Oldest son Sandy Jr., 22, a catcher, was last year voted Topps minor league 
player of the year for the Padre triple-A farm team in Las Vegas. Second son 
Roberto, 20, a second baseman, played like a rookie of the year candidate for 
Padres in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Big jobs, big futures. Yet the Alomar women still buy most of the clothes for 
their men. The Alomar women, whenever they are in the same city, still cook 
most of the dinners for their men. Whenever they are apart, they still have 
hour-long phone conversations in the middle of the night with their men, adding 
to a monthly bill that averages $200. 
</P>
<P>
And on bright Saturday mornings such as this, the Alomar women still like to 
sit around and talk about their men. They probably do this better than 
anything. 
</P>
<P>
Sandia: "Did they tell you what happened this summer with Santino (Sandy Jr.)?" 
</P>
<P>
Marie: "We tell you. We get a phone call from Las Vegas." 
</P>
<P>
Sandia: "It's Santino. He calls every day. We think it's nothing. 
</P>
<P>
Marie: "Then he tells us, guess what. He just got married." 
</P>
<P>
Sandia: "We said, this is joke. Then we scream." 
</P>
<P>
Marie: "We scream." 
</P>
<P>
Sandia: "Then we talk to him for a while, and say, OK, if he is happy, we are 
happy." 
</P>
<P>
Maria: "I finally think, really, it is good that my boys go out and be 
independent." 
</P>
<P>
Sandia: "You do? Is that why, when Santino first went to states to play 
baseball, you cried so hard you spent a week with your head in a towel?" 
</P>
<P>
In a story such as this, featuring a middle-class family that rises from a 
forgotten middle-class town to the edge of stardom in the professional baseball 
world, there is a tendency to overemphasize the word family. In the case of the 
Alomars of Salinas and San Diego, that is impossible. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres signed Sandy Jr. in 1983, followed by his father in 1984, followed 
by Roberto in 1985. Since then, no organization in baseball has had three such 
leading figures with the same last name. No other big league park has an 
organist who plays the theme from "All in the Family" seemingly once per foul 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
If this is giving you a Huxtable hangover, just wait. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent drive through this sun-washed fishing community, a town passed over 
by the freeway several years ago and left to age in the obscurity of peeled 
paint and old men on park benches, Roberto Alomar makes three stops. One is to 
admire a mural of his father, Sandy, painted on the side of his childhood 
stadium. Another is to share a handshake and some stories with his Uncle 
Dimitri, who owns four faded walls and a fuzzy television set that pass for a 
bar. A final stop is at a downtown pharmacy, owned by a man he calls his second 
father, Nestor Pabon. 
</P>
<P>
When he finally returns home, he is greeted by two cousins inside the house and 
two friends outside who wish the pleasure of washing his car. Inside and out. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why Robbie would be foolish to ever leave our town," Sandy Jr. says 
later from his new home with wife Christie in Phoenix. "Everybody there want to 
wash his car." 
</P>
<P>
Everyone but Sandy Jr. still lives in this home, the same home in which father 
Sandy lived while spending 15 years as a major league second baseman. It's 
neither big nor ornate, but it has a room full of trophies and the dusty scent 
of memories and just right now, nobody can think of leaving. They gather around 
the telephone almost once a day to talk to Sandy Jr., who is sometimes sad that 
he left for Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
After Sandy Jr. hangs up, they like to talk about the Last Great Year, 1985 in 
Charleston, S.C., when Sandy coached the Padres' Class A team while Roberto and 
Sandy Jr. played there. Maria moved in for the summer, and together they lived 
in an apartment. With the exception of stray dogs and fish pastries and free 
car washes, it was almost like home. 
</P>
<P>
"That was some year," Maria said. 
</P>
<P>
Success will probably never allow it to happen again. Just last season, 
although Sandy and Maria and Roberto were together in San Diego, Roberto lived 
in a separate condo. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm old enough to start living with myself," Roberto said. 
</P>
<P>
"But then why," his mother asked him from across the room, "you still always 
come over for dinner?" 
</P>
<P>
The story of this family's success is only overshadowed by the fingerprint 
success has left. This was once just a family whose father, Sandy, a retired 
baseball hero, owned the corner Mobil gas station. This was it. 
</P>
<P>
"People are always asking me if I think we got lucky," Sandy says. "What is 
luck? We just live like we always live, and these things happen." 
</P>
<P>
The chief and most unfair thing to happen has been a placing of the two boys 
together, in the same sentence and same mindset, almost making them seem like 
twins. 
</P>
<P>
Yeah, and DeVito and Schwarzenegger are twins. 
</P>
<P>
As much as you would like to think the two Alomar boys are alike, they are 
different. 
</P>
<P>
Start with Roberto's small build (6 feet) vs. Sandy Jr.'s large build (6-5). 
Move to Roberto's light skin and Sandy Jr.'s dark skin. Then go deeper. 
</P>
<P>
"They are very, very different," Sandia said. "Two people." 
</P>
<P>
Begin with this: Roberto was always the baseball player. Sandy Jr. was always 
the one who was bored by it. 
</P>
<P>
"They would go to the park at the same time," Maria remembered, "but while 
Robert would stay all night, Santino would leave and go to a movie." 
</P>
<P>
Roberto had to be a second baseman, just like his father. Sandy Jr. had to be 
anything but a second baseman. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to be something somebody in my family is not," Sandy Jr. said. 
</P>
<P>
Roberto had to win. Sandy Jr. just had to have fun. 
</P>
<P>
"We would play Monopoly, and he would have to kick my butt," Sandy Jr. said. 
"We go to the park, and he always has to hit first. He says, 'I don't hit 
first, nobody hits.' " 
</P>
<P>
This is because Roberto had stated early that he wanted to be a baseball 
player, and a winner. Sandy Jr. wanted to be a pilot. And a dirt-bike racer. 
</P>
<P>
"Even as a boy, Roberto have his game face on," Maria said. "Sandy Jr., for a 
while, we didn't think he would ever play. He did different things." 
</P>
<P>
Roberto has never even dreamed of quitting the game. Sandy Jr. actually quit 
for a couple of years, between the ages of 12 and 14, to race his dirt bikes. 
</P>
<P>
"I am into excitement, dangerous things," said Sandy Jr., who only rejoined the 
baseball world when a Juvenile League coach picked him up while he was working 
at his dad's gas station and begged him to replace their injured catcher. "I 
didn't find dangerous things in baseball. I was bored." 
</P>
<P>
So there is jealousy right? Their brotherhood ends where the sharp edges of 
their values begin, right? 
</P>
<P>
"No, that is what is interesting," Sandy said. "The boys are still family." 
</P>
<P>
"We fight," Sandy Jr. said. "But not fight fight." 
</P>
<P>
They rarely fought as boys because their father was always there with the 
ultimate punishment. 
</P>
<P>
"He'd grab our gloves and bats and tell us, no fighting, or I hide these," 
Sandy Jr. said. "We smart enough to stop." 
</P>
<P>
And they have rarely fought as men. The only apparent jealousy between the two 
occurs when Sandy Jr. wonders how things could come so easy for Roberto, a 
wonder shared by many. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes during school, I would not go to the park with my father because I 
have to study for test," Sandy Jr. said. "Roberto bring his books to the park 
and study between taking grounders. We both take test, and while I get an 'A,' 
he still gets a 'B.' I ask him, 'How in the hell do you do that?' " 
</P>
<P>
Similar feelings arose again last season when, according to friends, Sandy Jr. 
became as mad at Roberto as his character would allow. Remember when Roberto 
was the last player cut from the Padres last spring? Remember when he spent an 
hour crying about it? When he returned to the hotel, Sandy Jr. really gave him 
something to cry about. 
</P>
<P>
"I ask him, 'Who do you think you are?' " Sandy Jr. said. "I tell him, 'You are 
given a better chance than most of us young guys. We had no chance to make the 
team.' I tell him, 'You are now a minor leaguer like us, so you should like 
being with us.' " 
</P>
<P>
Once at Las Vegas, even though he was only there a couple of weeks, Roberto 
continued to pout, not doing the dishes when asked by his roommate brother and 
another roommate, Joey Cora. 
</P>
<P>
"I would just step in and wash them, no big deal," Cora said. "It was just the 
little stuff all brothers fight about." 
</P>
<P>
"All I think is big leagues," Roberto said. "I not think of anything else." 
</P>
<P>
Today they are the best of friends again. The minute Roberto made the big 
leagues, Sandy Jr. became his personal cheerleader, often encouraging him over 
the phone. 
</P>
<P>
"He is more than my friend, he is my brother," Sandy Jr. said. "My family." 
</P>
<P>
And when Sandy Jr. said he was getting married, Roberto did not scream. 
</P>
<P>
"Good for him," Roberto said. "I don't know if I do it, but he like it, so he 
do it." 
</P>

CONTROVERSIAL GOAL WINS FOR SOCKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
WICHITA, Kan. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two hours 21 minutes of tension ended in controversy here Friday night when 
Branko Segota scored just 1:17 into sudden-death overtime to give the Sockers a 
2-1 victory over the Wichita Wings. 
</P>
<P>
The closely contested, defensive game ended in screaming and shouting after 
Segota stole the ball from Wichita's Erik Rasmussen at the point of a Wings' 
power play and scored the game-winner with a heroic effort. 
</P>
<P>
Segota ran the length of the field and, just as he was caught by Wichita's 
Chico Borja, got off a shot that was blocked by goalkeeper Ziggy Zigante. But 
the ball went straight up, and when it came down, Segota beat both Wings to the 
ball and headed it in. 
</P>
<P>
The game ended with Borja screaming at referee Kelly Mock that the ball did not 
go into the goal, but the red light came on. 
</P>
<P>
Rasmussen and Wings captain Victor Moreland also claimed the ball was not in 
the goal. And Rasmussen said Segota fouled both Borja and Zigante on the shot. 
</P>
<P>
Borja, who repeatedly refused to comment after the game, was slapped with a 
misconduct fine for his outburst. 
</P>
<P>
Segota and Sockers goalkeeper Victor Nogueira said they were surprised to see 
Wichita play such a controlled, low-scoring game. 
</P>
<P>
"They played great defense," Nogueira said. "I'm surprised. They're an 
offensive team. It was a very defensive game, and I thought my defense was just 
exceptional. 
</P>
<P>
"Ziggy had to make some incredible saves the whole game. Luckily, I only had to 
do it for three or four saves." 
</P>
<P>
Added Segota: "They played very tight and very well against us in the games we 
have played." 
</P>
<P>
Segota looked dangerous all night, but the Sockers were thwarted at nearly 
every turn by Zigante and a Wings game plan of defense and ball control. 
</P>
<P>
It worked until Segota pulled off the big play. 
</P>
<P>
"Both goalkeepers were great," said Ron Newman, the Sockers coach. "It was a 
defensive game, but I thought it was an exciting game. 
</P>
<P>
"The fans shouldn't be turned off because they weren't seeing a lot of (goals). 
It was just that nobody wanted to let them in. Everybody was getting that last 
toe in there." 
</P>
<P>
The Wings had held the league's hottest team to a single goal and had a power 
play and a chance to tie with 45 seconds left in regulation. 
</P>
<P>
But the Wings were facing another red-hot goalkeeper in Nogueira, who is 
undefeated in his last four games. His 2.19 goals-against average is almost two 
goals better than his nearest MISL challenger. 
</P>
<P>
He made two sensational saves during the last two minutes, one on Rasmussen and 
another on Andy Chapman. 
</P>
<P>
"There's one reason why the Sockers have six championship banners hanging in 
their building," Wings Coach Terry Nicholl said. "When it takes precision, they 
have it." 
</P>
<P>
It was the fifth consecutive victory for the Sockers (13-9) and left them just 
1 1/2 games behind league-leading Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
Segota said that on the last sequence, he gave Rasmussen some room, then closed 
it down to steal the ball. He started the run during the Wings' power play, but 
it was technically not a shorthanded goal because the penalty expired 2 seconds 
before the winning shot. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman, who scored Wichita's game-winner in Baltimore Thursday night, got the 
Wings on the scoreboard first in the opening period. 
</P>
<P>
It was a power-play goal, set up when the Sockers committed six fouls. Chapman 
took a pass from Chico Moreira from the corner and whacked home a 15-foot shot. 
</P>
<P>
Zoran Karic got the Sockers even at 1-1 early in the second period with an 
assist from Segota on a set play from the top of the restraining arc. Karic 
scored from 30 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Zigante might have stopped that one, too. He had a bead on it, but it was 
deflected in off Moreland. 
</P>
<P>
It was Segota's 272nd assist and put him at No. 4 on the all-time MISL assist 
list.

NO MORE 'DISCERNIBLE' STOP, SO BALKS WILL BE BALKS AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The balk rules that bogged down baseball last season have come to a discernible 
stop. 
</P>
<P>
The changes that led to a record 924 balks -- up from 356 the previous year -- 
are being dropped, Major League Baseball announced Friday. From now on, balks 
will be called as they were before 1988. 
</P>
<P>
No longer will pitchers be required to make a "discernible" stop in the set 
position. Also, pitchers no longer must have both feet on the ground when they 
set. 
</P>
<P>
"Prior to 1988, the rule stated that a pitcher must come to a stop," said 
Richie Phillips, executive director of the Major League Umpires Assn. "The word 
discernible is being deleted. Also, in 1988, they added change-of-direction 
does not constitute a stop. That is also being deleted, leaving open the 
question of whether change-of-direction constitutes a stop." 
</P>
<P>
The clarifications were adopted in December, 1987, on a 1-year trial basis. The 
Major League Baseball Players Assn., which has the right to approve or veto 
such changes, opposed the newer language. Baseball's rules committee made it 
official Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Along with balk changes, the rules committee agreed to act on a recommendation 
by the scoring rules committee to drop the game-winning RBI as an official 
statistic. The GWRBI was adopted by the committee in 1979 and went into effect 
in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
The rules committee will also establish standards for the type of finish on 
bats and set standards for the size of manufacturers' logos on equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought that the (balk) change, both in enforcement and language, was 
inappropriate and likely to force changes in the game that nobody wanted," Don 
Fehr, executive director of the players' union, said. 
</P>
<P>
"The balk rule is to be enforced in 1989 as it was in 1987 and in earlier 
years," Fehr said. "I expect that to be the case. I expect there will be good 
faith." 
</P>
<P>
But the squawking about balking could continue. 
</P>
<P>
"They took the word discernible out, but you still have to come to a complete 
stop. We're telling umpires that," said Ed Vargo, supervisor of National League 
umpires. "It's going to come down to judgment from the umpires. I guess we 
enforced it before." 
</P>
<P>
Marty Springstead, supervisor of American League umpires, said this week's 
change "doesn't really mean much." 
</P>
<P>
"I think at the end of the season, they were all pretty much coming to a stop. 
That's the way it was meant to be anyway," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Murray, of the commissioner's office and chairman of the rules committee, 
said, "I'm sure the umpires will call what they see. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a noticeable decline in the number of balks during the second half 
or the last third of the season," Murray said. "The pitchers became used to 
what the umpires were calling." 
</P>
<P>
There were 253 balks in April, 190 in May and 142 in June. In September and 
October, a total of 106 were called. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, 558 balks were called in the American League and 366 in the National 
League. 
</P>
<P>
The Oakland Athletics had 3 of the top violators. Dave Stewart set a 
single-season record with 16 balks. Bob Welch was next with 13, and Rick 
Honeycutt tied the American League single-game record with 4. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Martinez and Pascual Perez of the Montreal Expos and David Cone of the 
New York Mets were tied for the National League lead with 10.

MORNING BRIEFING: A BOXING CARD WITH CHARACTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The promoters called it the "Night of the Living Legends." One writer called it 
the "Night of the Living Dead." Another called it the "Night of the Fighting 
Fossils." 
</P>
<P>
It all came apart Thursday night at Rochester, N.Y., where George Foreman 
knocked out a guy named Mark Young, who once lasted all of 50 seconds with Mike 
Tyson, and where Aaron Pryor was a last-minute scratch after failing to pass 
the eye examination. 
</P>
<P>
The card boasted a number of intriguing characters, including Bruce (The Mouse) 
Strauss who was stiffened by Harry Arroyo in two rounds. 
</P>
<P>
Strauss' record is listed at 73-50-5, but Randy Gordon of the New York State 
Athletic Commission said, "He's got more aliases than most guys have fights." 
</P>
<P>
Said Wallace Matthews of Newsday: "Strauss, who will be 37 next month, has 
fought in every weight class from lightweight to heavyweight. He has fought his 
brother and fought as his brother. He has fought his own fighters. He has 
fought three times in 1 week. 
</P>
<P>
"His name appears, with a "KO by" next to it, in the records of former world 
champions Bobby Czyz, Marlon Starling and Mike McCallum, as well as contenders 
Vampire Johnson, David Braxton and Jean-Marie Emebe. The guys who have lost to 
him change their identities under the Federal Witness Protection Program to 
save their families embarrassment." 
</P>
<P>
Add Strauss: "Several times," said Matthews, "he was supposed to work in a 
guy's corner but wound up fighting him because the opponent failed to show. One 
time, he fought in Omaha the night after being stopped by Bobby Czyz on ESPN, 
and was recognized by a fan at ringside. He told the fan, 'That was my brother, 
Mouse Strauss. I'm Moose Strauss.' "

Trivia Time: What do Doc Rivers, Bo Schembechler and Pop Warner have in common? 
(Answer below.) 
</P>
<P>
Just Asking: Wonder if Cincinnati Bengals defensive end Jim Skow cried "foul" 
when he saw Sports Illustrated's featured picture on the Super Bowl, a shot of 
Joe Montana throwing a pass. Skow is being blocked by San Francisco tackle 
Harris Barton, who appears to have a firm grip on Skow's jersey with his left 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
George Seifert, new coach of the San Francisco 49ers, had a 3-15 record in 2 
years as the head coach at Cornell. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Olbermann said on KNX that he covered the 1976 team and said a typical 
Cornell series was three straight running plays, which went nowhere, followed 
by a punt. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the most unimaginative offense I've ever seen," Olbermann said. 
</P>
<P>
Golden State Coach Don Nelson, on the shot 6-foot 1-inch Isiah Thomas made over 
7-7 Manute Bol to give the Detroit Pistons a victory over the Warriors 
Wednesday night: "There are only five players in the NBA that can do that and 
you have one of them right here in Detroit. I don't know who the other four 
are, either, by the way." 
</P>
<P>
Dan Hampton of the Chicago Bears wastes little time in returning home to 
Arkansas once the season ends. 
</P>
<P>
His wife Terry told the Chicago Tribune, "He gives me a half hour to pack. He 
puts a sheet down on the floor and says, 'Put whatever you want in it.' Then he 
slings it over his shoulder like Santa Claus and heads for the car."

RAIDERS WILL BE A CHALLENGE FOR ADOLPH; 
</P>
<P>
NEW DEFENSIVE COACH WILL FIND THINGS DIFFERENT FROM CLEVELAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Dave Adolph's dog days are over. 
</P>
<P>
Or are they? 
</P>
<P>
Adolph, defensive coordinator for the Cleveland Browns the last 3 seasons, was 
hired by the Raiders Friday to perform the same function. 
</P>
<P>
Officially, the 51-year-old Adolph will coach the linebackers along with Sam 
Gruneisen and "organize the defense." The Raiders don't use the term defensive 
coordinator, but Adolph will be calling the defensive signals. 
</P>
<P>
He thus jumps from a team with the third-best defense in the league and those 
wild fans in the Dog Pound to one of the worst defenses in Raider history and 
those wild rumors of a team split by a power struggle. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders finished the 1988 season at 7-9 with their defense in a shambles. 
The team surrendered 369 points, its highest total since 1962 in the old 
free-wheeling days of the American Football League. With a shot at the playoffs 
remaining on the final Sunday of the season, the Raiders gave up 43 points and 
490 yards in total offense in losing to the Seattle Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
And then the real blood bath began. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive coordinator Charlie Sumner: Fired. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive backfield coach Willie Brown, an Al Davis favorite: Fired. 
</P>
<P>
Receiver coach Nick Nicolau, a Mike Shanahan guy: Fired. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive line coach Earl Leggett: Resigned. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive backfield coach Jimmy Warren: Reportedly cleaned out his desk, went 
home to Louisiana and was said to have been fired by one of the news services, 
but remains employed according to the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
Warren's status is relatively stable, however, compared to the off-again, 
on-again position of assistants Tom Walsh and Joe Scannella, pawns in an 
apparent struggle between Davis, the managing general partner, and Shanahan, 
the head coach. Shanahan reportedly fired Walsh and Scannella at season's end 
only to have Davis turn around and reinstate them. 
</P>
<P>
Into this steps Adolph who brings with him 27 years of coaching experience. 
Some skill as a mediator probably wouldn't hurt either. 
</P>
<P>
Adolph was a defensive assistant in his first tour of duty with Cleveland, 
1979-84, went to the San Diego Chargers for a year, then returned to Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
A guard-linebacker at the University of Akron, in his hometown, Adolph began 
his coaching career in Cleveland at the high school level in 1962. After a 
year, he moved into the collegiate ranks, spending time at Akron, Connecticut, 
Kentucky, Illinois and at Ohio State under Woody Hayes. 
</P>
<P>
"The addition of Dave Adolph to our staff couldn't please me more," Shanahan 
said. "Dave is an extremely knowledgeable coach who has the reputation of being 
an excellent teacher as well as a motivator."

COMMENDING THOMPSON FOR TAKING A WALK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding the Murray article of Jan. 26: Murray was not at his best in his 
tirade against Georgetown's John Thompson, a coach who has been relentless in 
maintaining discipline and insisting that his kids apply themselves to their 
studies on or off the road. But before that he had to be confident that his 
recruits were endowed with the gray matter and determination to meet the high 
moral and academic standards of Georgetown. Perhaps Murray can get Jimmy the 
Greek and that Dodger VIP (whose name I have already forgotten) to help him 
extricate his foot from his mouth. Then I suggest that he ask his BUSHel of 
supporters in Washington to get the Pentagon to build him a bullet proof shoe 
(for 20 grand or so) to protect him in case he keeps trying to shoot himself in 
the foot.

FIRING GENE SHUE WAS CLIPPERS' BIGGEST BLUNDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I think the recent firing of Coach Gene Shue was by far the most disgusting 
move the Clippers have ever made. It just shows the lack of class of this 
organization. Gene Shue has proven to be one of the best coaches the NBA has 
ever had. Coaching is not the Clippers' problem. The Clippers need players, 
talented and healthy players, not a new coach!

THIS ATTENDANCE RECORD MAY NEED AN ASTERISK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
If you find it surprising that Louisiana State and Georgetown are likely to set 
a National Collegiate Athletic Assn. attendance record when they play in the 
Louisiana Superdome today, you are not alone. 
</P>
<P>
Granted, it is a game with appeal. Second-ranked Georgetown against LSU and its 
remarkable freshman, Chris Jackson. John Thompson vs. Dale Brown. 
</P>
<P>
But 65,913 people? 
</P>
<P>
That's the number of tickets that had been distributed as of late this week. 
</P>
<P>
The catch: 45,000 of those tickets were bought at a reduced price by a shoe 
store and a bottled water company -- and then given away. The school also gave 
away several thousand to students. 
</P>
<P>
It's all part of a plan by Brown to break NCAA attendance records. 
</P>
<P>
The first goal was to break the regular-season record of 52,693 set in the game 
between UCLA and Houston at the Astrodome in 1968. Elvin Hayes led Houston to a 
71-69 victory over UCLA, which was led, of course, by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, then 
known as Lew Alcindor. 
</P>
<P>
With that mark seemingly assured, Brown's sights have turned toward the mark of 
64,959, set by Indiana and Syracuse in the Superdome in the 1987 NCAA 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
The Superdome usually announces turnstile attendance, which in this case might 
be considerably lower than tickets distributed. 
</P>
<P>
For NCAA purposes, the figure is paid attendance plus media attendance. And 
paid attendance includes every ticket sold -- no matter for how little, and no 
matter if it was ultimately given away. 
</P>
<P>
Kohn Smith, the first-year coach at Utah State, is not making friends with 
other Big West Conference coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Before Nevada Las Vegas' 94-68 victory over Utah State Wednesday night in 
Logan, Utah, several newspapers reported Smith as having said that he was happy 
to see UNLV lose to Louisville. He also questioned the character of the UNLV 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's take a polygraph test and ask every one of our players if they were 
recruited legally, if ever they were given inducements or given anything 
illegally by boosters," the Associated Press reported Smith as having said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard for me to walk out of the tunnel at Las Vegas, stand there as our 
kids get into cabs and see (Stacey) Augmon and (David) Butler come out and get 
into big, fancy cars. . . . It's hard to see them with the alligator shoes, the 
jewelry, the whole business and not wonder about it." 
</P>
<P>
UNLV's Jerry Tarkanian and Smith had a heated exchange after the game, an AP 
story said. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to be your friend," Tarkanian said. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure you did," Smith responded. 
</P>
<P>
"I did, but I don't anymore," Tarkanian said, loud enough to be heard by 
spectators. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Tarkanian vented his anger. 
</P>
<P>
"We always pull for teams in our conference when they play outside the 
conference," Tarkanian said. Tarkanian was highly critical of Smith's 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
"I resent greatly what I thought were comments that had racial overtones and 
were the most classless I have ever heard from a basketball coach," Tarkanian 
said. "It's his first year of coaching, and he ought to win some games before 
he talks." 
</P>
<P>
Smith defended his statements and denied making any racist remarks, but 
Tarkanian indicated he won't be putting the incident aside. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal from here on will be to play our 2 best games of the year against 
Utah State," Tarkanian said. "We will dedicate ourselves to having our best 
games each year against the Aggies." 
</P>
<P>
Smith also drew a response from Coach John Sneed of Cal State Fullerton this 
week after suggesting that the Aggies had lost to Fullerton in 4,000-seat Titan 
Gym last Saturday because of a letdown after playing in front of 18,000 in 
UNLV's Thomas and Mack Center 2 days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, that was really bush," Sneed said. 
</P>

College Basketball Notes 
</P>
<P>
Guard Gary Payton of Oregon State took some publicity away from Arizona's Sean 
Elliott and Stanford's Todd Lichti with his performance last week, scoring 60 
points in 2 victories, adding 15 assists and 5 steals. Going into this week's 
games, Payton was leading the Pacific 10 in scoring, 22.8 points, assists, 7.9, 
and steals, 3.8. . . . The 10 players who walked out on San Jose State Coach 
Bill Berry last week, accusing him of verbal abuse and demanding that he be 
fired, have been holding their own practices at an outdoor court in the 
apartment complex in which senior Anthony Perry lives. Despite learning that 
their scholarships will not be revoked, the players remain in consultation with 
San Francisco attorney Melvin Belli and still hope that Berry will be fired or 
resign, Perry said.

IMPROVED HUSKIES NEXT FOR STRUGGLING BRUINS

UCLA, which needed a last-second shot by Trevor Wilson Thursday night to beat 
Washington State, probably won't find the going much easier today against 
Washington in Hec Edmundson Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
Including an 84-75 victory over USC Thursday night, the Huskies have won 4 of 
their last 6 games, and the 2 losses were by 2 points to Stanford and by 1 to 
Oregon State at Corvallis, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
Considering that they opened play in the Pacific 10 Conference last month with 
a 116-61 loss at Arizona and then lost 2 nights later at Arizona State, 121-90, 
the Huskies may be the most improved team in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
"This might be a crossroads game for us -- to decide if we're going to be a 
contender or an also-ran," UCLA Coach Jim Harrick said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Washington is 7-9 overall and 4-4 in the Pac-10. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA, meanwhile, is 11-5 and 6-2, but continues to struggle. The Bruins, who 
have split their last 6 games, were out-played by a poor Washington State team 
before overcoming a 10-point deficit in the last 5 1/2 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"It was ugly," Harrick said of the 64-63 victory at Pullman, Wash., which was 
not assured until Wilson rebounded his own missed shot and scored on a layup as 
time ran out. 
</P>
<P>
Washington State, which had lost its previous 3 games by 42, 18 and 27 points, 
went into the game ranking last in the Pac-10 in scoring and shooting 
percentage, but the Cougars' slowdown tactics enabled them to build a 13-point 
second-half lead against the uninspired Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
"We only performed for about 5 minutes," Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
That turned out to be enough, though, when Washington State's Brian Quinnett 
failed to screen Wilson off the board after the UCLA forward had lofted an 
8-foot jump shot from the baseline. 
</P>
<P>
"I jumped with him when he took the shot, but as soon as I turned, he knew it 
was short and he stepped around me," Quinnett said. "There's no excuse for not 
boxing him out." 
</P>
<P>
And there's no excuse for UCLA's poor play, Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
"We just haven't executed, offensively or defensively, and it's time to call a 
halt to that," Harrick said. "I know what will happen if we continue to do 
that. You can only get out of the fire so often." 
</P>
<P>
Bruin Notes 
</P>
<P>
Washington, which uses three juniors and two sophomores in its starting lineup, 
will be among the favorites to win the Pacific 10 Conference championship next 
season, UCLA Coach Jim Harrick said this week. . . . Eldridge Recasner, a 
6-foot 2-inch junior guard, had 25 points and 6 assists against USC and leads 
the Huskies in scoring with a 16.8 average. 
</P>
<P>
Washington's Dion Brown, a 6-5 forward from Los Angeles Crenshaw High, had 
career highs of 21 points and 10 rebounds in a 71-70 victory over Oregon last 
week and is averaging 12.4 points a game. . . . UCLA made only 15 of 25 free 
throws against Washington State.

TO KNOW RULES IS NOT TO LOVE THEM; 
</P>
<P>
NANCE, A FORMER NCAA INVESTIGATOR, SEES INEQUITY IN NCAA REGULATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is no shortage of coaches who criticize National Collegiate Athletic 
Assn. rules, but Coach Lynn Nance of St. Mary's has a unique perspective. 
</P>
<P>
He used to work as an investigator for the NCAA 1 year. 
</P>
<P>
During a hiatus from coaching in the early 1970s, Nance was one of a staff of 
four investigators that included David Berst, now the NCAA's director of 
enforcement with a staff of nearly 20. 
</P>
<P>
In his third season at the Moraga, Calif., school, Nance is critical of the 
rules he once helped enforce. 
</P>
<P>
"The rules are preposterous," he said. "They are set up for middle-class WASPs. 
They don't take into consideration that some players' parents don't have money. 
They don't take into consideration that some travel a long way to school, that 
some climates are warm and some are cold. . . . The unfortunate thing is that 
the NCAA rules are a little like the IRS: The more rules you make, the more the 
cheaters cheat." 
</P>
<P>
Nance objects to rules such as those that prohibit a coach from buying meals 
for a player or helping a player with travel expenses in a family emergency. 
</P>
<P>
He also objects to the NCAA's investigative procedures and powers, an issue 
that concerned him when he was working as an investigator -- and an issue that 
was considered by the U.S. Supreme Court when it ruled that because the NCAA is 
a private group, it did not have to adhere to constitutional guidelines when it 
ordered Nevada Las Vegas to suspend Coach Jerry Tarkanian. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'People have legal rights,' " Nance said. "The things we were doing 
were not going to wash in court. 
</P>
<P>
But then, as now, the NCAA's power to investigate and punish as it chooses has 
been upheld. "In the long run, (the NCAA) has been proven right," Nance said. 
"To me, in a free country (you should not have) to give up your rights to 
participate. (The NCAA) really does have a monopoly." 
</P>
<P>
His time with the NCAA was not Nance's only work experience outside of 
coaching. Before going to the NCAA, he completed a 3-year stint with the FBI, 
during which his duties ranged, he said, "from more exotic cases, like bank 
robberies and fugitives, to violation of the Smokey (the) Bear emblem." 
</P>
<P>
Nance said the FBI training taught him organization and attention to detail. 
</P>
<P>
"Tex Winter (former coach at Marquette, Kansas State, Northwestern and other 
schools) always told me everything turns on a trifle," Nance said. "It's the 
little things that beat you. The bureau preached the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
Nance moved to the NCAA with the idea that he could combine his investigative 
skills with sports, but being involved in sports again only served to reinforce 
his desire to coach. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in conflict," Nance said. "Anybody that had coached who went into that 
situation would be. But please understand I was in conflict with the rules, not 
with the people enforcing them. I think highly of the people I worked with." 
</P>
<P>
His expert knowledge of the rules has helped him in coaching, Nance said, 
enabling him to avoid breaking rules -- and to do things legally that other 
coaches might not realize can be done. 
</P>
<P>
But when a school he won't name sought to hire him in the belief that his 
knowledge could help the program cheat without being caught, Nance was deeply 
affronted. 
</P>
<P>
With his knowledge of NCAA enforcement, Nance holds the conviction that there 
is a need for change. 
</P>
<P>
"It's getting a little bit sad," Nance said. "I don't pretend to have all the 
answers. But I'm beginning to get frustrated with running an honest program." 
</P>
<P>
Besides having one of the most intriguing resumes among college coaches, Nance 
also has quite a team. 
</P>
<P>
His Gaels are 16-2. 
</P>
<P>
The Gaels' losses were by 1 point to Stanford and by 3 points to USF. All but 3 
of their victories have been by 20 points or more. 
</P>
<P>
They rank in the top five among Division I teams in five categories: scoring 
defense, 55.5 points allowed; scoring margin, +23.6; won-lost percentage, 
94.1%; field goal percentage, 53.7%, and defensive field goal percentage, 
38.6%.

BELL HELPS USF UPSET ST. MARY'S

James Bell's 3-point play with 54 seconds remaining snapped a tie and lifted 
the University of San Francisco to a 62-55 upset of St. Mary's in a West Coast 
Athletic Conference game Friday night at Moraga. 
</P>
<P>
USF trailed, 55-53, with 2:24 left, but Mark McCathrion scored on a short jump 
hook at 1:43 to tie the score. St. Mary's had a chance to regain the lead, but 
Dan Curry missed the front end of a 1-and-1 to set up Bell's winning play. 
</P>
<P>
St. Mary's saw its 7-game winning streak come to an end and fell to 16-2 
overall and 4-1 in the WCAC. The Gaels, who were 7-0 in road games, fell into a 
second-place tie with Loyola Marymount. Pepperdine leads at 5-0. 
</P>
<P>
McCathrion, the 6-foot 8-inch center who had missed the previous 2 games 
because of a death in his family, led the Dons with 14 points as USF (10-8, 
2-3) shot 65% against a team that was leading the nation in field goal defense. 
</P>
<P>
Al Lewis led St. Mary's with 15 points, including back-to-back 3-point shots 
that took the Gaels from a 53-49 deficit to a 55-53 lead with 2:24 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara 67, San Diego 66 -- The Toreros, trailing by 18 points with 7:32 
left, staged a furious rally, but came up short at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
With Santa Clara (13-5, 2-3) ahead by 1 with 8 seconds left, Bronco guard 
Melvin Chinn missed a free throw. San Diego's Craig Cottrell rebounded, and the 
Toreros (5-12, 0-5) were within seconds of pulling off the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Cottrell passed to freshman forward Kelvin Woods, who had trouble getting the 
ball upcourt. Woods passed it to Danny Means. With 2 seconds left and the ball 
at midcourt, Means tried to get off a shot but couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara had used an 8-0 run to go ahead, 50-32, with 8:09 left before San 
Diego started its comeback. The Toreros pulled to within 65-64 on Wayman 
Strickland's 3-point shot with 23 seconds left.

The University of Oklahoma's interim president said that the university is 
concerned about the school's football program. 
</P>
<P>
"It has become apparent there are very significant problems in the football 
program . . . " said David Swank. 
</P>
<P>
In December, the NCAA put the program on probation for 3 years, prohibiting the 
team from bowl games for 2 years and live television appearances for a year. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, starting cornerback Jerry Parks was suspended from the team and 
the school after a shooting in an athletic dormitory. Parks is accused of 
shooting with intent to injure teammate Zarak Peters. 
</P>
<P>
The university also announced that officials from the school and the Cleveland 
County district attorney's office are investigating allegations of a possible 
sexual assault last weekend at an athletic dormitory.

to win its third game in a row when it plays the University of the Pacific at 5 
p.m. today in the Spanos Center. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific has lost 4 in a row, but forced UC Santa Barbara to overtime last week. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton's Cedric Ceballos is coming off a week in which he scored 84 points 
and had 40 rebounds in 3 games. He is averaging 21 points and 9 rebounds a game 
for the Titans, who are 7-8, 2-4 in conference. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific is coming off a 69-52 loss to Fresno State Thursday. Daryl Wolfe, a 
junior forward, led the Tigers with 14 points in that game. Pacific is 5-11, 
1-7 in conference play. 
</P>

NEWSWIRE: PROBE CONFIRMS SHERRILL PAID FORMER PLAYER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Texas A &amp; M officials said Friday that an investigation into allegations 
that former football Coach Jackie Sherrill made illegal payments confirmed that 
he gave a former player money, but they said that evidence did not support 
"hush money" allegations made by the player. 
</P>
<P>
The results of the internal investigation have been turned over to the National 
Collegiate Athletic Assn., school President William H. Mobley said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Smith, the university's vice president of administration and finance, 
said the investigation confirmed that five overnight letters were sent to 
former player George Smith after he left the university, starting in November 
of 1986 and ending in September of 1988. Sherrill has admitted that three of 
the letters contained $500 each. 
</P>
<P>
But the report concludes that the evidence does not support any of the 
allegations made by George Smith, including the allegations that the payments 
constituted "hush money." The former player since has recanted the claim.

HOT SABRES DEFEAT CANADIENS, 4-2

<TEXT>
<P>
Rick Vaive has always been a high scorer in his 10 seasons in the National 
Hockey League, but always for a team struggling to get out of the second 
division. 
</P>
<P>
A month ago, the lowly Chicago Blackhawkstraded him to the Buffalo Sabres, 
another struggling team. 
</P>
<P>
But with Vaive leading the way, the Sabres are no longer struggling. They are 
the hottest team in hockey. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night at Buffalo, Vaive scored his 12th goal in 14 games since joining 
the Sabres to lead them to a 4-2 victory over the best team in the National 
Hockey League, the Montreal Canadiens. 
</P>
<P>
The Sabres extended their unbeaten string to 9 games (7-0-2) and took over 
second place in the Adams Division. They trail the Canadiens by 20 points and 
will play them at Montreal tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Vaive, who scored more than 50 goals three times for weak Toronto teams, has 15 
points in his last 10 games. On Friday, he assisted on Scott Arniel's goal, 
which gave the Sabres a 2-0 lead before the game was 5 minutes old. 
</P>
<P>
Hartford 8, New Jersey 6 -- Ron Francis had a hat trick and Kevin Dineen scored 
twice at East Rutherford, N.J., as the Whalers extended their unbeaten streak 
to 5 games (4-0-1). 
</P>
<P>
The Whalers overcame a 3-goal deficit to hand the Devils their sixth loss in 
the last 9 games. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 8, Toronto 1 -- Steve Yzerman had a goal and 2 assists at Detroit to 
become the first player in Red Wing history to score 100 points twice in his 
career. Yzerman has 45 goals and 56 assists for 101 points. Last season, he had 
50 goals and 52 assists for 102 points. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Wings, who extended their lead in the Norris Division to 12 points over 
St. Louis and Minnesota, fired 53 shots at Toronto goalie Ken Wregget. DAN

SCOTT DOESN'T HAVE KIDNEY AILMENT, DOCTORS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
Doctors confirmed Friday that Laker guard Byron Scott, who reportedly has 
played for a few weeks while experiencing internal bleeding, is not suffering 
from a kidney ailment. 
</P>
<P>
But Scott, who missed Friday night's game between the Lakers and Charlotte 
Hornets at the Forum, is not expected to accompany the Lakers on a 3-game trip 
beginning Sunday in Dallas. It is possible, according to one of Scott's agents, 
that Scott could be out of the lineup for as long as 2 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers did not disclose the cause of the blood in Scott's urine. Scott 
reportedly underwent further evaluation at Centinela Hospital Medical Center in 
Inglewood on Friday morning and spent the remainder of the day resting at home. 
He apparently is not taking medication. 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement, the Laker internist, Dr. Michael F. Mellman, said: 
"Byron is fine. There are no underlying kidney disorders, and the blood in his 
urine has already begun to clear up. There are no other significant problems, 
and we expect him to return to full participation in the near future." 
</P>
<P>
Mellman added, however, that he did not want Scott to return to action with the 
Lakers until "the problem is completely cleared and did not recur after a few 
days of practices." 
</P>
<P>
Scott, 27, apparently did not tell the Lakers of his condition until Wednesday. 
But Randy Vataha, an associate of Bob Woolf, Scott's agent, said that Scott has 
felt ill and experienced varying degrees of internal bleeding for nearly a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
"It may be a month or even more, as far as I can remember," Vataha said. "He 
tried to play through it for a while, and maybe that ended up hurting him more. 
But it demonstrates the team attitude Byron has. He didn't want to hurt the 
team by missing games." 
</P>
<P>
Scott could not be reached Friday. Vataha, who said he had spoken with Scott, 
said that he was told that the Lakers' third-leading scorer "shouldn't do 
anything for a week or maybe two." 
</P>
<P>
Mellman apparently is still trying to determine the cause of Scott's condition, 
evaluating tests and looking into the medical history of Scott and his family. 
</P>
<P>
"They haven't found anything that is abnormal yet," Laker trainer Gary Vitti 
said. "When (doctors) bring somebody in with blood in the urine, they think it 
could be all of these things. They do tests and rule out all of those things. I 
think that's what they've done. They've eliminated all of them. It might just 
be something like an infection, but they don't know."

DAUGHERTY EJECTED, BUT CLEVELAND WINS BRAWL WITH DETROIT

<P>
There was only one real sharpshooter on the court Friday night at Auburn Hills, 
Mich., in the bitter, rough defensive battle between the Cleveland Cavaliers 
and Detroit Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
When the Pistons figured out a way to get rid of hot-shooting Brad Daugherty, 
they almost rallied to win before losing, 80-79, to the best road team in the 
National Basketball Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Daugherty was 7 of 8 from the field before he was involved in an altercation 
with rival center Bill Laimbeer, who was 1 for 7, late in the third quarter. 
Because both threw punches before they grappled and all players on both benches 
joined the melee, both were ejected. 
</P>
<P>
When order was restored, officials had to separate the Pistons' enforcer, Rick 
Mahorn, from high-scoring Larry Nance of the Cavaliers. Seconds later, Vinnie 
Johnson of Detroit and Ron Harper of Cleveland exchanged words, but no punches. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, the Cavaliers, who had dominated the game, led by 13 points. 
Suddenly they turned cold, scoring only 10 points in the last 13 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"You wouldn't call that a trade-off, would you?" Cleveland Coach Lenny Wilkens 
asked. "I thought we were unsettled (after Daugherty's ejection). He's our best 
passer, and we run a lot of offense around him." 
</P>
<P>
Laimbeer maintained that Daugherty started the fight. Daugherty wasn't 
available after the game. 
</P>
<P>
A 14-0 spurt in the fourth quarter triggered by Isiah Thomas enabled the 
Pistons to tie the score, 73-73, with 4 minutes to play. Thomas had 16 of his 
22 points in the second half, including 5 in the big rally. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Price, the only player besides Daugherty who took as many as 8 shots and 
made more than half of them, sank 2 free throws with 51 seconds left to give 
the Cavaliers an 80-77 lead. Thomas' jumper cut the lead to a point, but when 
he missed a desperation shot at the buzzer, the Cavaliers, who are 13-6 on the 
road, improved the best record in the league to 31-8. 
</P>
<P>
It's surprising that the Pistons were close, since they shot 38% from the field 
and only 65% from the free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 113, Golden State 112 -- The Warriors continue to be the surprise 
team of the NBA, but lately their luck has turned sour on the road. 
</P>
<P>
They lost a heartbreaker to Detroit Wednesday night when Isiah Thomas threw up 
a shot over 7-foot 7-inch Manute Bol and it banked high on the backboard before 
dropping through the net for a 1-point victory with 14 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
This may have been a tougher defeat. With 5 seconds left, the Warriors led the 
76ers, 112-110. But Hersey Hawkins, who was only 7 for 20 (35%) to that point, 
sank a 3-point shot. When Rod Higgins' short jumper at the buzzer bounced off 
the rim, the Warriors had back-to-back 1-point defeats. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors held burly Charles Barkley in check, especially in crunch time. He 
had 17 points and 16 rebounds, but only 2 points in the last quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Don Nelson moaned about the Warriors' missed layups. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unfortunate, but missed layups contributed largely to this loss," Nelson 
said. "We're going to make the easy shots most of the time. Give them credit, 
they (the 76ers) made 3 passes before making the last shot." 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors, who have been winning with a starting lineup of players 6-8 or 
under, will get 7-4 Ralph Sampson back tonight at Indianapolis, but 6-8 Larry 
Smith may remain the starting center. Bol came off the bench to block 11 shots 
in 21 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix 132, New York 130 -- The Knicks, playing their sixth road game in 9 
nights, battled the Suns right down to the wire before losing in the last 5 
seconds on a rebound basket by Tom Chambers. 
</P>
<P>
With the score tied, 130-130, Mark West of the Suns missed 2 free throws. 
Chambers rebounded the second one and finished with a season-high 36. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 119, Atlanta 112 -- The SuperSonics, trailing by 16 at halftime, turned 
it around with a tough defense and the shooting of Derrick McKey to win their 
16th in a row at home. 
</P>
<P>
McKey had 20 of his 28 points in the second half, and the Hawks went almost 9 
minutes without a field goal, ending their 4-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 117, Washington 106 -- Michael Jordan had one big scoring burst in the 
second quarter at Chicago, and it carried the Bulls to victory. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan scored 16 of his 33 points in the last 5:52 of the first half to put his 
club in front to stay. The rest of the night, he concentrated on assists (9) 
and rebounds (11). 
</P>
<P>
Dallas 126, San Antonio 82 -- It became a rout at Dallas when Mark Aguirre 
scored 9 of his 35 points in a 14-4 spurt to open the second half. 
</P>
<P>
The injury-riddled Spurs used Calvin Natt and Jay Vincent, who had been 
obtained in a trade with Denver and who arrived shortly before game time. Natt 
had 16 points in 23 minutes. Vincent had 14 points in 33 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 128, Sacramento 116 -- The shooting of Reggie Lewis kept the Celtics 
from getting blown out in the first half at Boston. Then, with Robert Parish 
leading the way, the Celtics regained their form with a 74-point second half. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings, who won a tough game against New Jersey Thursday night with 
playmaker Kenny Smith playing 48 minutes, led, 62-54, at halftime. DAN HAFNER

EVANS, BIONDI IN RUNNING FOR SULLIVAN AWARD 
</P>

<P>
Janet Evans and Matt Biondi, the Southern California swimmers who starred in 
the Olympics at Seoul, are among 10 finalists for the Sullivan Award, given 
each year to the outstanding amateur athlete in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Swimming was the only sport with two finalists when the list was cut down from 
46 by the Amateur Athletic Union's selection committee. 
</P>
<P>
The winner will be announced March 6 in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Evans, who took only a brief break from swimming after the Olympics, is back 
competing for Placentia's El Dorado High School. On Jan. 16 at Long Beach, she 
set a U.S. record in the 1,650-yard freestyle at 15 minutes 44.98 seconds, 
taking more than a second and a half off the nearly 6-year-old record set by 
Tiffany Cohen, 15:46.54. 
</P>
<P>
Look for more American records to fall now that Evans will be swimming some 
major meets in yards, distances unique to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Since Evans broke her first world record in July, 1987, the major meets have 
been long course (meters) in preparation for the '88 Olympic Games. But the 
U.S. swimmers will be competing in yards in some major meets, including the 
Phillips 66-U.S. Swimming Short Course Nationals at Chapel Hill, N.C., March 
21-25. 
</P>
<P>
At that meet, Evans is expected to swim the 400-yard individual medley, the 
500-yard freestyle, the 200-yard individual medley and the 1,000-yard 
freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
With the 1,650 record already in hand, she will skip that event in North 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
Biondi isn't doing any competitive swimming these days, but he has been staying 
in shape to be ready for the tryouts for the U.S. water polo team, to be held 
at Newport Beach Feb. 4 and 5. 
</P>
<P>
Since most of the water polo team retired after the 1988 Games, Coach Bill 
Barnett has a lot of spaces to fill. 
</P>
<P>
Besides doing speaking engagements and some commercial appearances, Biondi was 
back in the waters off the coast of Florida, swimming with dolphins for an 
ABC-TV special with Curt Gowdy that shows an apparent special communication 
between dolphins and children with Down's syndrome. ABC will televise the 
special April 2. 
</P>
<P>
Biondi also has been kept pretty busy accepting awards and still has a few more 
to pick up. 
</P>
<P>
Biondi already has been named United Press International's sportsman of the 
year and the United States Olympic Committee's sportsman of the year. Not to 
mention being named Italian-American man of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Included in a long list of appointments is his Feb. 3 date at Boca Raton, Fla., 
for a basketball slam dunk contest against the likes of Carl Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
Although he is staying busy, Biondi isn't cashing in on his 7 medals. When he 
passed through New York last month on a tour of 12 cities in 8 days, Biondi 
told John Nelson of the Associated Press that he was in the wrong sport for 
making big bucks. And, he said, 1988 wasn't the best Olympic year for cashing 
in, either. 
</P>
<P>
"No one is going to get rich from these Olympics except maybe Flo Jo, if she 
plays it right," Biondi said, referring to track star Florence Griffith Joyner. 
</P>
<P>
"There were so many controversies -- steroids, television, the boxing -- and 
then there was the time difference. I think people got kind of turned off. 
Advertisers realize that. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard one advertiser's quote. He said, 'Our company would rather sponsor 
events than athletes, because events don't do drugs or beat their wives.' It's 
getting harder for the athlete instead of easier." 
</P>
<P>
Explaining why swimming isn't as potentially lucrative as other Olympic sports 
such as boxing or figure skating, and why swimmers don't draw top endorsements, 
Biondi said: "The Olympics is only once every 4 years, and for that magical 
week, everybody is watching and reading about it. But to stay on top, you have 
to be heard from a little more often than that." 
</P>
<P>
USC and UCLA are undefeated in swimming this season. USC is 6-0 and already has 
10 swimmers qualified for the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. meet. That's 
the most the Trojans have ever qualified before the Pac-10 meet. 
</P>
<P>
Helping build that total are the 1988 Olympians on the USC team, who missed the 
first semester because of the trip to Seoul but are allowed to use Olympic 
times for qualifying times. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans are competing this weekend in the Dallas Classic at Southern 
Methodist, swimming against SMU, Texas, Stanford, California and Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins (7-0) already have Mark Dean qualified for the NCAA meet. Dean 
qualified for the 200-yard butterfly with a time of 1:47.25 in a meet against 
Arizona State Jan. 13. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the Bruin team is breaststroker Andrea Cecci, who was the Italian 
national champion in the 100-meter and 200-meter breaststroke. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans and the Bruins are both 2-0 in the Pac-10. They will not meet until 
Feb. 25. 
</P>
<P>
The USC women's swim team is 5-4 and has four women qualified for the NCAA 
meet. Leslie Daland and Kathy Hettche have qualified in the 1,650 -- Daland at 
16:33.63 and Hettche at 16:37.93 -- as well as Leslie Seward in the 200-yard 
breaststroke and Terri O'Loughlin in the 100-yard butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
The UCLA women are 8-1 after a big victory at Cal last weekend. The Bruin women 
have lost only to Stanford, which is as strong as usual. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Swimming, in keeping with its philosophy of getting international 
experience for a wide range of swimmers, is sending a team of 6 to the 
Coca-Cola International Meet at Paris Feb. 3-5 and the Meetings Arena at Bonn, 
West Germany, Feb. 10-12. 
</P>
<P>
On the team will be Steve Crocker of St. Louis, Matt Rankin of the Click Tucson 
team, Beth Barr of the Greater Pensacola Swim Team, Whitney Hedgepeth of the 
Virginia Assn. for Competitive Aquatics, Ann Mahoney of the Wichita Swim Club 
and Jenny Thompson of the Seacost Swim Team. Jay Fitzgerald of the Santa Clara 
Swim Club is going as the coach.

LA HABRA CLOSING IN ON PLAYOFF BERTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tim Moore scored 25 points as La Habra High School took control of its own 
playoff destiny with a 66-47 victory over Sonora Friday in a Freeway League 
basketball game at La Habra. 
</P>
<P>
The victory gave the third-place Highlanders (10-9, 4-2) a 2-game lead over 
Sonora in the league standings with 4 games remaining. La Habra hasn't 
qualified for the playoffs in 5 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"If you go by percentages, Sonora should not beat Sunny Hills and Fullerton, so 
they will probably have six losses (at the end of the season)," La Habra Coach 
Frank McCarroll said. "If we go 5-5, we're in the playoffs. This was a big, big 
win for us." 
</P>
<P>
Sonora (7-12, 2-4) led, 10-9, at the end of the first quarter, but La Habra 
held the Raiders without a field goal in the second. The Highlanders outscored 
Sonora, 20-7, to take a 29-17 lead. All of the Raiders' points came on free 
throws. 
</P>
<P>
David Stevens scored 13 points and Anthony Ortiz 10 for La Habra. Anthony Choe 
scored 14 points for Sonora. 
</P>
<P>
In other Freeway League games: 
</P>
<P>
Sunny Hills 42, Troy 29 -- Marcus Hopkins scored 17 points as Sunny Hills 
(13-7, 5-1) overcame the Warriors' slow-down tactics at Troy. The Lancers led, 
6-0, at the end of the first quarter and 15-6 at halftime. They put the game 
away by outscoring Troy, 15-7, in the third quarter for a 30-13 lead. Chris 
Inman scored 9 points for Troy (5-13, 1-5). 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton 72, Buena Park 38 -- Pete Bach scored 20 points, all in the first 
half, for host Fullerton (13-5, 6-0). Lee Green added 10 points and 6 rebounds 
for Fullerton. Bach also had 6 rebounds. Prentiss Johnson scored 12 points for 
Buena Park (0-15, 0-6).

CAYA LEADS SERVITE'S THIRD-QUARTER RALLY

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Forward Blaine Caya scored 6 of his team-high 12 points in the third quarter 
Friday to spark a third-quarter rally and lead Servite High School to a 50-45 
victory over Bishop Montgomery in an Angelus League boys' basketball game at 
Servite. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Montgomery had slowed the pace to lead, 17-16, at the half. But Servite 
(12-7, 3-2) outscored Bishop Montgomery, 18-8, in the third quarter. Caya also 
had a team-high 11 rebounds for Servite. Rob Jones added 10 for Servite. 
</P>
<P>
Darrell Daniel scored 16 points for Bishop Montgomery (9-10, 0-5). Daniel was 3 
of 3 on 3-pointers in the final quarter but Bishop Montgomery could not get 
closer than 5 points. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei 68, Bishop Amat 36 -- David Boyle scored 15 points to lead visiting 
Mater Dei. Mike Morris scored 14 points on 7-of-12 shooting from the field and 
also had a team-high 8 rebounds for Mater Dei (21-2, 5-0). Mater Dei led, 
27-17, at the half and, 40-23, after 3 quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Dylan Rigdon, who leads Mater Dei with 19.1 points a game, was bothered by the 
flu. He played only sparingly and scored 4 points. Jason Green scored 14 points 
for Bishop Amat (13-8, 3-3).

CSUN CONFIDENT AFTER VOLLEYBALL SETBACK AT USC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS J. PARKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After dismantling Chapman College at home last week, the Cal State Northridge 
men's volleyball team talked about knocking off USC. 
</P>
<P>
But Tuesday the Matadors lowered their aspirations when they were swept under 
by Pepperdine. They just hoped to escape Friday night's match at USC with their 
limbs intact. 
</P>
<P>
Turns out that CSUN walked out of USC's North gym with a lot more than they 
came in with. 
</P>
<P>
Despite losing their second consecutive Western Intercollegiate Volleyball 
Assn. match -- this time by scores of 15-4, 12-15, 15-6, 16-14 -- the Matadors 
showed a level of confidence thought lost 3 days before at Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel a helluva lot better than I did Tuesday," CSUN Coach John Price said. 
"I feel frustrated because we had an opportunity to win on the road at SC but 
I'm not frustrated with our record." 
</P>
<P>
Price is feeling good after his team dropped to 3-5 overall, 0-2 in conference 
play? Well, part of that optimism stems from the fact that the Matadors' last 2 
losses were to the No. 5 and No. 2 teams in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
And Price was also encouraged by the fact that CSUN led in the past 2 games and 
even served at game point 4 times in the fourth game before falling to the 
defending national champions. 
</P>
<P>
"When those guys come to CSUN, we're going to beat them in three straight," 
setter Tom Ribarich said. "I'm serious." 
</P>
<P>
So was teammate Andrew Greskovics, who will count the days until the rematch at 
CSUN. "Home courts are like a seventh player out there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But before the Matadors can sweep the Trojans at CSUN, they're going to have to 
clean house a bit. They may talk a good game, but the Matadors couldn't figure 
out how to finish one off at USC. 
</P>
<P>
After falling behind, 12-8, in the fourth game, CSUN scored 6 consecutive 
points and was within a point of forcing a fifth game. Outside hitter Neil 
Coffman had 3 of his 16 kills in the Matador run. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to throw a lot of different approaches at them, especially on the 
quick hit," Price said. 
</P>
<P>
But with CSUN leading, 14-12, USC (10-2, 2-0) did the same thing to the 
Matadors to tie the score, 14-14, as 3 Trojans knocked down quick spikes. USC 
took a 1-point lead when the Matadors couldn't return Tom Duke's cross-court 
spike and won the match when Duke nailed a free ball into the center of CSUN's 
court. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we'd win," Ribarich said of the fourth game. "I thought after we won 
the second game the match would go 5 games. Even when we lost the third game we 
were right there with them. 
</P>
<P>
"If we would have won the fourth game we would have taken the momentum into the 
fifth game." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Samuelson had a match-high 29 kills and 6 block assists for CSUN and middle 
hitter Ron Graening added 17 kills. USC, which had 4 players with 19 or more 
kills, was paced by middle hitter Bryan Ivie's 23 kills.

DEEP MUSTANG LINEUP FACES AN EARLY TEST IN OPENER AGAINST CSLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Master's College baseball team made the NAIA District 3 playoffs for the 
first time last season with a lineup that batted .309 and averaged 8 runs a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
An impressive showing, especially when one considers that the Mustangs reached 
the postseason party with a pitching staff that compiled a 7.67 earned-run 
average. 
</P>
<P>
Master's Coach Pat Harrison said that his team will be improved in both 
departments this season, which begins at 2 this afternoon with a game at Cal 
State Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got more depth in our position players and our pitching staff," said 
Harrison, who replaced John Zeller last season. "That makes me think we should 
have a pretty good club." 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs lost 8 seniors from a team that finished 24-26 overall, 13-9 in 
district play and lost to Westmont in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State L. A. is one of 5 NCAA Division II opponents that the Mustangs, a 
member of the National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics, will play as part of 
a 46-game schedule. Master's also will play Division I power Cal State 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's positive for the guys to play against upper-division teams," said 
Harrison, who was an All-American infielder at USC and played 2 seasons in the 
Dodger minor league system. "(Former USC Coach Rod) Dedeaux always took teams 
and threw them in the water to see if they could float. I think that's a good 
philosophy." 
</P>
<P>
Junior left-hander Eric Schumaker, a transfer from Rio Hondo Junior College, is 
expected to anchor the pitching staff and also bat cleanup. Junior left-hander 
Jeff Cole and freshman right-hander John March also will be used as starting 
pitchers, and junior right-hander Ray Cartagena will begin the season as the 
No. 1 reliever. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have anyone who's going to strike out a lot of people," Harrison 
said, "but we have a lot of people with good control." 
</P>
<P>
It might be difficult to control Mustang hitters despite the loss of Todd 
Skinner (.372 and 46 runs batted in) and Jeff Holen (.335, 11 home runs, 48 
RBIs). Peter Wilson, a sophomore transfer from Tennessee Temple, will replace 
Skinner at third base and Jeff Preston, who redshirted last season, will 
replace Holen at first. 
</P>
<P>
Shortstop Mark MacArthur, a junior who batted .325 and had 5 home runs and 47 
RBIs, is the team's top returning player. Sophomore Darren Beck, who batted 
.291 and had 10 RBIs last season, will start in the outfield along with Dan 
Bevins, a transfer from Napa Valley Junior College. Cole will start in the 
outfield when not pitching. 
</P>
<P>
Junior catcher Jeff Lane (.254, 24 RBIs) will split time with sophomore Tony 
Jaime.

HIP BRUISE TO SIDELINE BOWSER FOR KEY GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The hopes of the Cal State Northridge men's basketball team rest largely on the 
performance of the Matadors' largest player, Todd Bowser. 
</P>
<P>
CSUN, therefore, with its 6-foot, 8-inch, 280-pound junior center seated 
squarely on the bench, will be an underdog tonight against Cal State Dominguez 
Hills, a team that likely will contend for 1 of the 4 berths in the California 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Bowser is sidelined because of a deep bruise in his left hip, an injury 
suffered Thursday night in a home game against Chapman. 
</P>
<P>
A chase for a loose ball ended in a collision between Bowser and the bleachers 
behind the Chapman bench. 
</P>
<P>
Score it a TKO for the bleachers. It took several minutes before Bowser, a 
3-year starter, was helped up and led to the training room. X-rays of the hip 
taken Friday afternoon at Encino Hospital were negative, according to Jim 
Bowser, Todd's father. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Bowser and CSUN Coach Pete Cassidy could not be reached for comment Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge was leading Chapman, 30-26, when Bowser left the game with 4:50 
remaining in the first half. Chapman rallied to win, 79-74, dropping CSUN to 
11-6 overall, 2-2 in conference play. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Hills also has an 11-6 record. The Toros are 3-1 in CCAA play, their 
only loss coming to second-ranked UC Riverside, 59-58, on Jan. 19. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Blackmon, a preseason Division II All-American, is Dominguez Hill's top 
player. He leads the CCAA with averages of 19.5 points and 9.6 rebounds a game. 
</P>
<P>
Blackmon, a 6-8 senior, has been a pain in the hip to Northridge because he 
scores a lot of points away from the basket. Blackmon's penchant for the 
perimeter made him a tough man-to-man match-up for the bulkier Bowser.

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now Hank knows how Brian felt. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1988 football season, the University of San Diego lost five games -- 
all decided late -- by an average of 3 points. Coach Brian Fogarty was 
mesmerized. 
</P>
<P>
In five West Coast Athletic Conference games, the USD men's basketball team has 
lost five games -- all late -- by an average of four points. Coach Hank Egan is 
mesmerized. 
</P>
<P>
While Friday night's game against Santa Clara had all the makings of a blowout 
for 32 minutes, it ended up being the closest. Down by 18 with 7:52 remaining, 
USD rallied fiercely but came up short, 67-66. 
</P>
<P>
USD fell to 5-12, 0-5 in the WCAC. Santa Clara is 2-3, 13-5. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't get any easier for the Toreros when they face the University of San 
Francisco tonight at 7:30 in the USD Sports Center. USF (10-8, 2-3) upset No. 
20 St. Mary's Friday. It was only the Gaels' second loss of the season, first 
in the WCAC. 
</P>
<P>
With Santa Clara ahead by one with 8 seconds remaining Friday, Bronco guard 
Melvin Chinn missed his fifth free throw of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
USD's Craig Cottrell rebounded, and the Toreros were within seconds of pulling 
off an incredible comeback. 
</P>
<P>
But Cottrell passed off to freshman forward Kelvin Woods, who had trouble 
getting the ball upcourt; precious seconds were wasted before Woods finally it 
to Danny Means. With 2 seconds left and the ball at midcourt, Means tried to 
break free for a shot but couldn't get one off. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the way it's been going lately," Egan said. 
</P>
<P>
With 7:52 left, things weren't going at all for the Toreros. The Broncos had 
just run off 8 consecutive points and led, 50-32. Then USD's Gylan Dottin, who 
started at guard instead of forward for the first time this season, hit a 
3-pointer, and the game turned. 
</P>
<P>
With 4:25 left, USD still trailed, 56-41. That's when Egan called timeout and 
USD went to a full-court man-to-man defense. They also began fouling liberally, 
hoping for missed free throws. 
</P>
<P>
The strategy worked, Santa Clara missed eight free throws down the stretch and 
USD capitalized. 
</P>
<P>
Behind Cottrell, who had 12 of his 14 points in the second half, and Wayman 
Strickland, who scored all 12 of his points in the final 20 minutes, USD cut it 
to 67-64 with 9 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Strickland made the front end of a 1-and-1, and then the back even though he 
was trying to miss. 
</P>
<P>
Strickland then fouled Chinn with 8 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time this season, USD had five players in double figures. 
Cottrell had 14, Danny Means and Dondi Bell each added 13. Strickland had 12 
and Dottin 10. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara was led by Mitch Burley (24 points), Osei Appiah (17) and Jens 
Gordon (11). In the first half, USD did not shoot a free throw, nor did it 
score on successive possessions, as Santa Clara took a 33-20 lead. 
</P>
<P>
USD's 20 points was just one better than the season low for a half (19 in the 
first half against Santa Barbara). 
</P>
<P>
The lone bright spot was Bell who had 8 points, including a two-handed slam 
with 4:26 left to halt a 7-point Bronco streak with the score 29-18. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara also had an 8-point run, including two 3-pointers by Burley, to 
give the Broncos an 19-11 lead with 12:55 left.

DAVE DISTEL: 'GUS MACKER' SERVES UP BASKETBALL VERSION OF OVER-THE-LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dave Distel 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Let me ask you if this scenario sounds familiar. 
</P>
<P>
You start with a group of guys who have been playing this little 3-on-3 game 
among themselves for a while. 
</P>
<P>
They get a little bored butting heads with each other, so they come up with an 
outlandishly ostentatious name and set up a tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Outsiders soon realize that this little game and this little tournament can be 
a kick. 
</P>
<P>
Astonishingly, the little tournament becomes a very big tournament, drawing 
thousands of players from 42 states and 3 countries. National media adopt it as 
their darling. 
</P>
<P>
There you have it. 
</P>
<P>
What is it? 
</P>
<P>
You probably guessed over-the-line, San Diego being the home of the Old Mission 
Beach Athletic Club Over-The-Line World Championships. It does fit the above 
description. 
</P>
<P>
But it also applies to the Gus Macker Worldwide Tour 3-on-3 Basketball 
Tournament, which comes out of hibernation this weekend for a 2-day fling in 
the San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
You see, Gus Macker 3-on-3 basketball belongs to Michigan driveways in much the 
same way that OTL belongs to the beaches of San Diego. That is where it was 
born . . . and literally outgrew its childhood home. 
</P>
<P>
It began with Gus Macker, who might be described as a real-life fictitious 
character. Scott McNeal has had firsthand experience with the Gus Macker 
mystique. 
</P>
<P>
McNeal has stood near groups of Macker Backers and listened to the arguments. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw Gus Macker over on a porch smoking a cigar," one would say. "Looks just 
like Red Auerbach." 
</P>
<P>
"Naw," another would say, "he looks more like Adolph Rupp." 
</P>
<P>
"He was Adolph Rupp," a third would proclaim. 
</P>
<P>
"You're all wrong," another voice would interrupt. "He's a 6-foot-8 guy who can 
flat out slam dunk." 
</P>
<P>
McNeal would keep his smile to himself, but he would be smiling. After all, 
McNeal, all 5-feet 7-inches of him, is Gus Macker. 
</P>
<P>
"When people finally see me," he said, "there's lots of disappointment." 
</P>
<P>
I went to the stadium parking lot Friday morning in search of Gus Macker and 
found a girl sitting on a folding chair, two people unloading a truck and a 
bearded fellow out in the forest of hoops taping a sign to a backboard. 
</P>
<P>
"That's Scott," said the girl. "Out there." 
</P>
<P>
That's the fabled Gus Macker? 
</P>
<P>
I wasn't expecting Red Auerbach or Adolph Rupp or a 6-foot-8 bad dude, so I 
certainly was not surprised on that account. I just figured that so legendary a 
character would have an army of lackeys to perform such menial chores. What's 
more, he told me later that the couple unloading the truck were his parents. 
</P>
<P>
"This," he explained, "has always been a family-oriented thing." 
</P>
<P>
But why Gus Macker? 
</P>
<P>
It came from a junior high school shop class, where a happy-go-lucky friend 
thought it would be silly to come up with a willy-nilly collection of 
nicknames. McLean had been Mac so Mac became Macker, and Gus sure as heck 
seemed like a silly first name. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those same friends were probably among those in the McNeal driveway in 
Lowell, Mich., 15 years ago when they concocted the first annual Gus Macker 
All-World Invitational 3-on-3 Outdoor Backyard Basketball Tournament. The prize 
was $18, a buck each from the 18 players on 6 teams. 
</P>
<P>
Boy, did this whim grow. 
</P>
<P>
The tournament outgrew Lowell, for example, because it spilled out of the 
driveway and into the city streets and tied up one end of town. The City 
Fathers balked when it threatened to consume all of the town. And so it moved 
up the road to the streets and driveways of Belding, Mich., for the first time 
last summer.

<P>
That July event in Michigan is still The Big One, but Scott McNeal decided Gus 
Macker might play as a road show as well, and away it went in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
And so it has come to pass that the boundaries for 36 courts are taped onto the 
Tarmac at the corner of the stadium parking lot that tucks into the 
intersection of Interstates 8 and 15. The backboards were quiet sentinels 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Today, however, San Diego will have its winter games to go with the summer 
madness of OTL. 
</P>
<P>
"It's quite interesting how we parallel," McNeal said. "We're trying to keep 
the game as close as we can to the way it was played when we started, and I 
think their purists feel the same way." 
</P>
<P>
The parallel ends with team names, however. 
</P>
<P>
"Theirs have a tendency to get dirty," McNeal said. "Maybe it's Midwestern 
conservatism or maybe it's our family involvement, but our names don't get 
quite as wild as theirs." 
</P>
<P>
But, he was reminded, this Gus Macker is on San Diego's home court. 
</P>
<P>
"Well," he laughed, "we're not out to harness home style, but . . . " 
</P>
<P>
. . . He who controls the microphone controls the atmosphere, and the stadium 
parking lot for these 2 days is simply an expanded version of Scott McNeal's 
driveway.

ESCONDIDO-BASED CARVER CLOSED AT COST OF $58 MILLION

<P>
The Federal Home Loan Bank Board on Friday closed insolvent Carver Savings 
&amp; Loan, an Escondido-based institution that reported a negative net worth 
of nearly $10 million Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Federal regulators, who transferred Carver's insured deposits to two other 
California institutions, estimated Friday that the transaction would cost the 
FHLBB about $58 million. Regulators did not known how many deposits exceeded 
limits of the Federal Savings &amp; Loan Insurance Corp., which covers accounts 
of up to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles-based California Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. has acquired 
deposits originated through Carver's Escondido office. The branch will be open 
for business under the California Federal name Monday morning, according to 
Dave Barr, a spokesman for the FSLIC. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine-based New West Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. has acquired deposits 
originated by Carver's San Diego-based money desk operation, which "sold 
brokered jumbo certificates of deposit by telephone," Barr said. 
</P>
<P>
Carver had assets of $276 million and liabilities of $292 million Nov. 30, Barr 
said. The failed institution's regulatory capital fell to a negative $16.2 
million. Carver reported total deposits of $281.2 million Nov. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Carver, formerly Escondido Savings, was purchased by Leroy Carver, a Newport 
Beach businessman, in 1985. However, federal and state regulators pressured him 
to leave the S&amp;L during 1988. He since has filed suit in Orange County 
against two former executives at the S&amp;L. 
</P>
<P>
The S&amp;L's recent losses were in part generated by an imbalance between 
interest rates Carver was paying to depositors and interest rates it charged on 
loans to customers. 
</P>
<P>
"On Sept. 30, 56% of its deposits were paying interest rates of 8.31%, but 
(most of) its adjustable-rate loans carried interest rates of 8.13%," Barr 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Carver is the third troubled thrift to be resolved by the FSLIC this year. Last 
year, regulators handled 205 troubled thrifts through liquidation, merger or 
acquisition, and 18 others were stabilized.

IMPERIAL S&amp;L PARENT ELIMINATES DIVIDEND AS IT REPORTS BIG LOSS

Imperial Corp. of America on Friday eliminated its quarterly dividend and 
reported a $15.6-million net loss for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31. The 
parent company of Imperial Savings &amp; Loan reported a $13.8-million net 
profit during the like quarter the previous year. Imperial reported $14.9 
million in net income for the recently completed year, down from $51.3 million 
in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Imperial linked the fourth-quarter loss to $52.6 million set aside to cover 
expected loan losses and to satisfy minimum capital requirements requested by 
federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the loan loss reserves will cover losses linked to Grand Wilshire 
Finance Corp., a Glendora-based automobile finance company that in August 
entered federal bankruptcy proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
Imperial's decision to eliminate the fourth-quarter dividend "indicates 
Imperial's strong focus on building capital and is not a signal of reduced 
earnings prospects," according to a prepared statement issued by ICA Chairman 
Kenneth Thygerson. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego-based company expects to "return to levels of profitability 
experienced during the first three quarters of 1988," Thygerson said. 
</P>
<P>
Imperial reported $12.2 billion in assets at the end of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, disgruntled Imperial Corp. shareholders Thursday 
filed suit in U. S. District Court in San Diego, claiming that Imperial's 
officers and directors had violated federal security laws by misrepresenting 
"the true financial and operating condition of the company." 
</P>
<P>
The company substituted "Imperial's traditional asset base with high-risk 'junk 
bonds' and questionable higher-yielding loans, which . . . generated high risk 
for the company," according to the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
The suit also alleges that Imperial's "woefully inadequate (loan-loss reserves) 
. . . concealed from the investing public the true extent of the risks 
undertaken by the defendants."

The Hammond Co., a Newport Beach mortgage banker, reported a net loss of 
$529,754 for its fiscal third quarter ended Dec. 31, contrasted with net income 
of $144,227 for the previous year's third quarter. Quarterly revenue fell 20% 
to $4.8 million from $6 million the previous year. For the first 9 months of 
the fiscal year, Hammond had a loss of $219,163, contrasted with $609,925 in 
profits for the same period the previous year. Revenue for the 9-month period 
fell 16% to $16.3 million for the period ended Dec. 31 from $19.4 million for 
the same period ended a year earlier. Thomas T. Hammond, president, blamed the 
net loss on the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which rejected his application to 
buy a Riverside savings and loan. Hammond said the 16-month attempt to buy the 
S&amp;L resulted in a $450,000 charge against operating income in the third 
quarter. He also said that loan originations industrywide were sluggish last 
year, causing reduced revenue.

THEY FULLY ENJOYED SEINFELD SHOW

<TEXT>
<P>
In response to Lawrence Christon's review of Jerry Seinfeld's performance 
("Laughing on Empty," Calendar, Jan. 17), we feel he was very unfair to this 
talented comedian, not just in the review of the show but also in the attack on 
Seinfeld's person -- "the New York face, thin as a chisel." (We are not from 
New York.) 
</P>
<P>
The next time Mr. Seinfeld appears in Orange County, perhaps this critic could 
take a sense of humor instead of pen and relax and enjoy the show.

NO ROLE MODEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am disappointed and repelled by Tracey Ullman's narrow view of women 
presented in the "Taste Makers" article (Calendar, Dec. 25). Her statement, "As 
for women role models, I don't have much respect for other women and much 
prefer men" displays a sexist, prejudiced attitude that, if stated by a man, 
could lose an election or be cause for termination from a public position. 
(Whatever happened to Jimmy the Greek?) 
</P>
<P>
Ullman's remark is biting and condescending, and I know that because of it I 
will not be able to watch "The Tracey Ullman Show" for a long time. I just 
wouldn't be able to enjoy it. After all, I am a woman, a member of the sex for 
which Ullman has not much respect. And I can't continue to support an 
individual who has no respect for me.

STRONG STUDENT CAST PERFORMS 'SOUND OF MUSIC' 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The message is familiar: Climb every mountain, and if you happen to stumble 
along the way, get off your duff and keep going. 
</P>
<P>
It's not only the theme of "The Sound of Music," but the attitude taken by the 
Fullerton Children's Repertory Theatre in a crowd-pleasing performance of the 
Rodgers and Hammerstein musical at the Fullerton Union High School last 
weekend. The play about the singing Von Trapp family can be seen again this 
weekend and next. 
</P>
<P>
The occasional snafu -- a costume's hem trapping a wayward heel, a forgotten 
line here or there -- was handled with good-natured ease by the cast of 41 
fifth- through eighth-graders from the Fullerton area, who seemed to be on 
stage as much to have a good time and to learn about drama as to tell the story 
of Maria's quest to find her dreams. (The eight youngsters portraying the Von 
Trapp children, especially, had a hoot with "The Lonely Goatherd" and "Do Re 
Mi.") 
</P>
<P>
Directed by Vickie Schindele and Alberta Strey, the show is designed to trigger 
howls from the audience: In one scene, "Germans" searching for the Von Trapps 
zero in on a few suspicious characters from the audience. Most of the players 
met the musical challenges fairly well. Megan de Sales, an eighth-grader at 
Parks Junior High, was a charming, sweet-sounding Maria; Joy Friesen as Sister 
Berthe and Tami Griffin as Mother Abbess (both Acacia School sixth-graders) 
also were strong. Bob Wilson's sets are elaborate, and the costumes by Lueraecq 
Roberts and Bev Shirk are gorgeous. 
</P>
<P>
Co-director Schindele says the play was double cast, with one set of players 
performing one night and another set the next night, enabling every member of 
the group to have both a speaking role and a secondary duty, such as work on 
the stage crew. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fullerton Children's Repertory Theatre's production of "The Sound of 
Music" continues at the Fullerton High School Little Theater, Lemon Street and 
Chapman Avenue in Fullerton, tonight and Saturday and next Friday and Saturday 
at 7:30, with Saturday matinees at 1:30. Tickets: $4. Information: (714) 
870-6911.

TELETHONS: LUCRATIVE ENGINE OF TBN EMPIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK I. PINSKY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The worldwide broadcasting empire of Tustin televangelist Paul F. Crouch gets 
its income from weeklong fund-raising appeals, called "Praise-a-Thons," that 
raise tens of millions of dollars and are among the more lucrative such 
programs on U.S. television. 
</P>
<P>
Crouch reported pledges of $55 million from his two 1988 telethons -- pledges 
that he said are honored at a rate of better than 80%, which would give his 
Trinity Broadcasting Network a 1988 income of about $44 million, a 10% increase 
over the reported figure for 1987. 
</P>
<P>
That is more than the $41 million raised during Jerry Lewis' Labor Day weekend 
telethons for victims of muscular dystrophy, on a hookup that included 200 
stations, and more than twice as much as the $21 million raised on the United 
Cerebral Palsy's "Star-athon '88" last January. 
</P>
<P>
It is not quite as much as the $54.5 million reportedly raised by the Billy 
Graham Evangelical Assn., but that total came from appeals made on his 
televised crusades, his regular weekly radio program and direct mail appeals in 
all of 1987, the most recent year for which figures are available. 
</P>
<P>
Donations to Crouch's TBN also continued to climb last year at a time when 
other televangelists, including Garden Grove's Robert Schuller, were reporting 
sharply declining revenue in the wake of scandals involving Jim and Tammy 
Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart. 
</P>
<P>
TBN said it got pledges of more than $25 million during its most recent 
telethon, conducted on a 141-station, nationwide hookup for 5 days in late 
October. Most of the money raised was earmarked for acquiring new television 
and radio stations, as well as for maintaining and replacing the network's 
high-tech equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Crouch's goal is anything but modest. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to make history tonight, as far as Christian broadcasting in 
concerned," Crouch told viewers in late October on the first night of the 
autumn telethon. 
</P>
<P>
"Every channel, every satellite, every radio, every television ought to belong 
to God's people," he said, his fervor rising. "We should have possessed it many 
years ago. But we let the Devil have it. And, oh, he took it, yes he did. He 
was glad to have it. Satan has been using the airwaves with impunity for many 
years to curse and damn the souls of men and women, boys and girls. . . . And 
we let it happen." 
</P>
<P>
Observers of televangelism say they cannot account for TBN's continuing success 
in fund raising. Because he has been untouched by scandal, some suggest, Crouch 
may simply be receiving contributions that once were sent elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"The pie hasn't gotten smaller," said Robert Abelman, professor of 
communications at Cleveland State University. "Giving has just gotten more 
selective." 
</P>
<P>
According to Abelman, who surveyed the pattern of giving to religious 
broadcasters before and after the Bakker scandal, "there is a lot of money out 
there that is still being given to religious broadcasters. . . . With the 
Bakkers, Swaggart and (Oral) Roberts out of the picture, that does open avenues 
for greater income for many more televangelists. . . . Trinity really has come 
on strong. They have a lot of new, young televangelists. They are making their 
presence known." 
</P>
<P>
And, unlike the better-known broadcast ministries, TBN maintains no church, no 
college or amusement park to create a large, unproductive overhead, so 
contributors may think that their money goes a lot further. 
</P>
<P>
Crouch also was unusually frank when he kicked off last April's telethon. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't need a 'Praise-a-Thon,' " he told viewers then. "Every bill is paid. 
For all practical purposes, we have zero debt." 
</P>
<P>
Because TBN was already running in the black and didn't really need any more 
money to maintain its operations, he pointed out, the only real reason to raise 
funds was to expand. But that expansion, Crouch said, "is a fire that burns 
within my spirit." 
</P>
<P>
Like other fund-raisers, the Crouches' telethons feature heartfelt appeals, 
songs, live remotes from around the country, taped segments and drum rolls as 
large gifts are announced. On some nights, there is even a hint of daring 
Christian decolletage among the gospel singers. Behind glass walls, more than 
100 volunteers answer phones on two levels, and on several occasions there were 
so many people calling that the phone system blew a fuse. Viewers were 
regularly invited to jump in their cars and drive to the studio just off the 
Santa Ana Freeway and join the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the tote board keeping track of money raised, there is another 
which keeps track of the number of souls saved, the latter numbering more than 
3 million since TBN went on the air 15 years ago. There are celebrity guests 
too -- televangelists like Oral Roberts and Rex Humbard. 
</P>
<P>
In an adjoining studio, there is a raised map of the United States 20 yards 
long, outlined in lights. Locations of various TBN outlets and affiliates are 
marked with regional symbols, like a beach chair and palm tree in Miami, an oil 
rig in Houston. At various times during the telethons, which go off the air 
each night at 1 a.m. Pacific time, Paul and Jan Crouch will stroll around the 
"country" announcing amounts given by viewers of different stations. 
</P>
<P>
Crouch and his wife, longtime residents of Corona del Mar, usually eschew 
hysterical appeals and don't threaten to go off the air if money is not 
forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't beg and plead and cry," Crouch told viewers the first night of the 
October telethon. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Crouch prefers to compare his telethons to the more tasteful public 
television and radio pledge drives. There are premiums for those who pledge, 
ranging from a paperback book (not written by Crouch, who doesn't write books) 
sent to those making any pledge to a cassette of a gospel group for a $1,000 
contribution. Those pledging at least $25 a month for a year receive a pin 
which spells out "Jesus" in script made of rhinestones. 
</P>
<P>
One viewer who appreciates the relatively soft sell is Vernal Harshberger, an 
81-year-old retired schoolteacher from Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care for a lot of ranting and raving," said Harshberger, who has 
visited the Tustin studio three times. "I love to hear Paul preach. I think he 
is a terrific preacher. Jan's comments are wonderful too." 
</P>
<P>
Harshberger began watching regularly after the death of her first husband and, 
with her second husband now in a nursing home, continues to watch TBN between 2 
and 3 hours a night. She is a viewer of UHF Channel 40, rather than through a 
cable system, and makes a monthly contribution to the ministry. 
</P>
<P>
About 10 years ago, Harshberger, who has no children, decided to establish a 
trust that will give her $75,000 house to TBN after she dies. Harshberger said 
that she once hoped to be a missionary, and that the unsolicited gift was her 
way fulfilling a childhood commitment to spread the Gospel.

UCI MEDICAL CENTER OKD TO USE EXTERNAL HEART PUMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UCI Medical Center has been granted permission to use a new type of temporary 
artificial heart, a plastic pump that would fit outside a heart patient's body, 
hospital officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved use of the Acute Ventricular 
Assist Device (AVAD) at the hospital. The medical center in Orange becomes one 
of 20 hospitals in the country approved to use the pump and the only hospital 
in a five-county region including Orange, Los Angeles, Riverside, San 
Bernardino and Santa Barbara counties, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Cardiologists said the center sought approval to use the artificial heart as 
part of the university hospital's long-term plan to become recognized for major 
research and development of such artificial devices. 
</P>
<P>
The device helps coronary patients by temporarily taking over work for an 
ailing heart. The pump and other working equipment of this artificial heart 
remain outside the body. Plastic tubes are the only intrusion to a person's 
body. Those tubes connect a real heart to the plastic one, which takes over 
most of the work. 
</P>
<P>
"The heart becomes happier (with AVAD support) because it has less work to do," 
said Dr. Richard Ott, director of the Cardiac Transplantation Program at UCI 
Medical Center. He said the device will have many uses, including being a 
temporary heart for patients recovering from open-heart bypass surgery. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . The device also can be used as a 'bridge' to assist the heart (of a 
critically ill coronary patient) until a donor heart is available," Ott said. 
That is an important, life-saving asset, he said, because about 30% of heart 
transplant candidates die while waiting for a donor heart. 
</P>
<P>
Elaine Beno, a spokeswoman for UCI Medical Center, said the pump device is an 
improvement over previous artificial hearts because its action more closely 
resembles that of the human body. 
</P>
<P>
"The AVAD is pneumatically driven -- a major advantage over centrifugal pumps 
now in use because it functions more like the body's own physiology," Beno 
said. "Thus, the AVAD does less damage to the blood and organs like the 
kidneys, allowing it to be used for extended periods." 
</P>
<P>
UCI Medical Center's use of the "interim artificial heart" will be directed by 
Timothy Mills, who has a doctorate in bioengineering. 
</P>
<P>
"The AVAD has the ability to allow the native heart to recover," Mills said. 
"It will allow a heart to have a gradual recovery period, and the patient can 
then be weaned off the AVAD." 
</P>
<P>
Ott said he believes that UCI Medical Center was the first in the five-county 
area 
</P>
<P>
to obtain federal approval for the new device "because this a major research 
university." He also predicted that use of the AVAD will help them save many 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
There are many cases, Ott said, where a person's own heart can be saved if it 
is only given some rest. 
</P>
<P>
"A heart is an amazing organ -- it can resuscitate itself," Ott said. "This 
device can allow a heart to recover function." 
</P>
<P>
It will be an expensive procedure, however. 
</P>
<P>
Ott said the total cost for the machines, training and equipment is $129,000. 
Of that amount, $11,000 is the cost of a single ventricular-assist plastic 
pump. Human hearts have two ventricles, or chambers. If both ventricles need 
support, two of the plastic devices are used, Ott noted, and the cost would be 
$22,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time we would use the equipment, it would cost (the patient) $11,000 per 
ventricle," said Ott. 
</P>
<P>
Ott said UCI Medical Center now plans to do its own experiments and further 
develop the "interim artificial heart" equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"Our long-term goal is to make the university an acknowledged center for the 
application of these devices, and part and parcel to that is the development of 
our designs," Ott said. "We very much have an interest in further development 
of this technology."

body. GLENN KOENIG / Los Angeles Times

CON ARTIST'S 'PROTECTION PLAN' ONLY ENSURED HIS ARREST; 
</P>
<P>
MAN PLEADS GUILTY IN SCAM TO BILK $550,000 FROM SURGEON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Noted plastic surgeon Dr. H. George Brennan of Newport Beach had an irksome 
problem: Someone was passing out literature at office buildings and at South 
Coast Plaza accusing him of being a butcher. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for Brennan, a man from Hollywood named Alan Bates was ready to 
help. He would use friends in Las Vegas to stop the culprit, and it would only 
cost the doctor $550,000. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for Alan Bates, the doctor did not believe him and chose to call 
the police. 
</P>
<P>
Bates, whose real name is Reece L. Crisp, pleaded guilty Friday in Orange 
County Municipal Court to attempted grand theft in the incident. Crisp, 52, a 
part-time musician, is scheduled to return to the Santa Ana courtroom Feb. 9, 
then will be sent to state prison for a diagnostic study before he is 
sentenced. 
</P>
<P>
It was Crisp, of course, who had been passing out the derogatory literature. 
And for many months after the scam began in June, 1987, Crisp must have thought 
he had a gold mine of a plot. 
</P>
<P>
Crisp, unaware that Brennan had called police, made numerous telephone calls 
and even wrote letters describing how he wanted to help the doctor. Many of the 
calls, which authorities monitored, were from a pay phone at a gas station in 
Las Vegas. The ostensible purpose behind all these communications was to 
negotiate a fair price for what Crisp referred to as "the Council." 
</P>
<P>
In one of the first letters, Crisp wrote, "During my career, I have encountered 
many people, some of which are a few Las Vegas friends with the right 
connections to take care of this problem." 
</P>
<P>
On April 24, 1988, Crisp decided to let Brennan know how much money would be 
required and when a meeting could be arranged. But Brennan was in Paris on that 
date, speaking at a medical convention. Crisp called him there from a pay 
telephone in Victorville, which is along the Los Angeles-to-Las Vegas route. 
</P>
<P>
A recording of that conversation shows a glib con artist and a tight-lipped 
intended victim. 
</P>
<P>
Crisp wondered whether maybe the doctor did not trust him because he thought he 
sounded younger than 30 when in fact he was in his 50s. Did that bother the 
doctor? he asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Did you think I was younger? A lot of people do," Crisp said. 
</P>
<P>
Brennan asked him to talk about something "more fruitful." 
</P>
<P>
Crisp pointed out that he had only gotten into this thing to help, "as a decent 
thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
Crisp went on to say that he'd had trouble making arrangements with friends in 
Las Vegas. A senior member of "the Council" had died, and members had decided 
to conduct no business until after his funeral. But they did have a "Los 
Angeles maintenance group" that could help. 
</P>
<P>
Brennan abruptly told Crisp to get to the bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
"You want the bottom line? They will give us a lifetime insurance policy 
against any future trouble, but the cost is $500,000," Crisp said. That may 
sound expensive, Crisp said, but with it you get a 24-hour telephone number you 
can call anytime you have a problem. "That's their first-class deal," Crisp 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Then, of course, he added, Brennan would have to pay another $50,000 for 
Crisp's expenses. 
</P>
<P>
According to Orange County prosecutors, an arrangement was eventually made for 
a meeting May 6, 1988, at a bar in Hollywood. Brennan was to give the money to 
someone who would walk up to him saying, "I'm here to pick up a briefcase for 
Mr. Washington." 
</P>
<P>
The meeting was postponed, however, when police expressed concern about the 
</P>
<P>
setting. 
</P>
<P>
Brennan then suggested that they meet May 11 at the Hilton Hotel in Anaheim. 
Crisp agreed, but specified the conditions: Brennan was to have a 
representative inside the hotel lobby, and Crisp would send his own 
representative in to pick up the money; the same signal would be given, except 
"Mr. Washington" would now be "Mr. Valentine." 
</P>
<P>
Investigators for the Orange County district attorney's office had by this time 
placed Crisp under surveillance, primarily so they would know what he looked 
like when the meeting occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Brennan was in the vicinity but safely under police protection. 
</P>
<P>
On the appointed day, the Hilton lobby was swarming with Anaheim police 
officers and district attorney's investigators. One was dressed in a hotel 
security uniform. Some hid in a lobby closet. Some posed as tourists 
anticipating a day at Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Had to Be Ready' 
</P>
<P>
"We thought the whole thing was a fake," Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher J. 
Evans said, "but what if he really did know some boys in Las Vegas? We had to 
be ready." 
</P>
<P>
It was not Crisp who walked in, however. It was the cab driver who had brought 
him there. Crisp was outside in the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors say the cab driver walked up to someone who resembled a description 
of Brennan's representative. That man, who was a police officer, handed the 
cabbie a note reading: "YOU ARE SURROUNDED BY POLICE. YOU ARE UNDER ARREST. DO 
NOT RESIST. PLACE YOUR HANDS ABOVE YOUR HEAD." 
</P>
<P>
The cab driver, terrified by what he had stumbled into, did as ordered. Crisp 
was arrested in the parking lot. Police explained everything to the cab driver, 
who was let go. 
</P>
<P>
In checking Crisp's background, investigators discovered that he was indeed in 
the music business. He produced his own album, "The L.A. Song," under his stage 
name, Sonny Warmer, in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
They also discovered something else. Crisp, whom Brennan never saw during this 
encounter, is a former patient of the doctor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Praise for Cooperation 
</P>
<P>
"This whole thing came about because of the cooperation of Dr. Brennan," 
prosecutor Evans said. "He gave up a lot of his valuable time to assist us. We 
can't thank him enough." 
</P>
<P>
Brennan, who was not in court Friday, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Crisp, who is now free on $100,000 bail, admitted in court Friday that he had 
tried to steal $550,000 from Brennan. When he walked out of the courtroom after 
the proceedings, he shook hands with Evans and said, "Thanks for everything." 
</P>
<P>
"You're quite welcome," Evans answered, smiling.

2 HURT, 300 EVACUATED IN CHEMICAL EXPLOSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two workmen suffered minor injuries in a chemical explosion at an airplane 
parts manufacturing plant Friday that forced the evacuation of 300 employees, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The explosion occurred at 12:52 p.m. in the rear of Air Industries Corp. in the 
12500 block of Knott Avenue, Garden Grove, Fire Department officials said. 
Employees at the plant and in the surrounding businesses were evacuated 
immediately. Firefighters said it was not necessary to evacuate residents 
living across the street or students at nearby Pacifica High School. 
</P>
<P>
The explosion occurred when two workers added what they believed to be bleach 
to another drum of bleach. However, they were actually adding acid to the 
bleach, and the explosion resulted, Garden Grove Fire Capt. Bill Dumas said. 
</P>
<P>
"The explosion was in a chain-linked area, and the chemical leaked into a diked 
area, where it was contained," Fire Capt. Cameron Phillips said. A 
chlorine-type odor was detected, he said, but the high school was not in the 
affected area." 
</P>
<P>
Investigators were still trying Friday night to determine the exact type of 
chemicals involved in the explosion, Dumas said. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips said the two men who mixed the materials were taken to Humana Hospital 
Westminster after complaining of ear pains. A hospital spokeswoman said both 
were treated for minor injuries and released. 
</P>
<P>
"We heard a large explosion in the rear and we went back there and a couple of 
boys were plugging their ear drums up a little bit," said Pat Shierden, a 
foreman at the plant." 
</P>
<P>
Hazardous materials specialists from both the Anaheim and Orange County fire 
departments were called to the scene. Police barricades were set up for several 
hours to divert traffic from Knott Avenue at Lampson Avenue and Garden Grove 
Boulevard, causing traffic jams throughout the area.

MILITARY PROSECUTOR ASKS DISMISSAL OF MARINE MURDER CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCILLE RENWICK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A military prosecutor Friday requested that murder charges be dismissed against 
El Toro Marine Gunnery Sgt. Murray D. Payne, who is accused of murdering his 
wife and making her death look like a suicide. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Paul McBride, the prosecutor, said autopsy results were not conclusive 
enough to prove that Ella Mae Payne did not commit suicide. However, the 
investigating officer, who functions as a judge in this military version of a 
preliminary hearing, decided against dropping the charges until the 
investigation is completed. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Payne's commanding officer ordered the Marine released Friday 
morning. Payne, 40, has been detained in the brig at Camp Pendleton since Dec. 
1. 
</P>
<P>
The military hearing, which began last Thursday at the El Toro Marine Corps Air 
Station, is held to determine if there is enough evidence to warrant a 
court-martial of Payne. 
</P>
<P>
Payne and the couple's 22-year-old son, Darrell, discovered the body at 4 a.m. 
last May 10, hanging from the garage rafters of their Corona home. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess we're over the hump now," said Kevin McDermott, Payne's attorney. 
McDermott cited the testimony of Dr. Dewitt T. Hunter, the Riverside coroner 
who conducted the initial autopsy on Ella Payne and declared the death a 
suicide, as instrumental in the request that charges be dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter testified Friday that before the autopsy, he "would have placed homicide 
at the top of the list of the possible options," especially because of the 
complexity of the knot used in the hanging. However, the autopsy proved his 
initial belief incorrect, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to unusual efforts to assist in differentiating between these two forms 
of death," Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
The coroner said he was looking for evidence to prove foul play in the death, 
but found none. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Allen Bogan, an investigator with the Riverside County coroner's office 
who was at Payne's home the night the body was found, testified Friday that he 
had several suspicions regarding Ella Payne's death. 
</P>
<P>
Bogan said he not only thought that it was unusual for the 39-year-old woman to 
wear jewelry with her nightgown, but he also questioned the knot in the rope. 
</P>
<P>
"(I was) kind of stunned that someone would go through so much trouble to hang 
themselves," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Bogan testified that forensically nothing he was aware of could be 
linked to homicide. 
</P>
<P>
Two months ago, Bogan and Hunter amended the statements on reports in the 
Riverside coroner's office, listing the death as a suicide. Ella Payne's death 
certificate was also amended to list suicide as the cause of death. 
</P>
<P>
During a break from Friday's hearing Payne said he is not sure where he will 
live permanently but was glad to be free. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I can go out to lunch and have a nice dinner," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be nice to be outside of here." 
</P>
<P>
Both the defense and prosecution are continuing their investigations in Payne's 
case and are uncertain when the hearing will end.

HOUSE FIRE KILLS MAN IN NEWPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE BUNDY SMITH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An elderly Newport Beach man died Friday in a fire that swept through his home 
overlooking Lido Marina Village. 
</P>
<P>
William Womble, 78, was killed in the 2:20 a.m. blaze in the 2900 block of 
Cliff Drive, said Fire Capt. Ray Pendleton. It took firefighters half an hour 
to control the blaze, which probably was started by a cigarette or cigar, 
Pendleton said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire caused an estimated $325,000 damage to the wood frame house and its 
contents, Pendleton said. It also caused minor damage to a house next door. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said Womble spent most of his time alone and apparently lived off his 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a very sweet man," said Corinne Spence, who lived across the street 
from Womble for 17 years. On Halloween, she said, "kids loved trick-or-treating 
there because he always gave big Hershey bars." He also allowed neighborhood 
children to play handball on his garage door, neighbors said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was very kind and gentle," said Rich Demmer, 22, a neighbor who remembers 
eagerly visiting Womble every Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
Spence said Womble's family built the house before World War II. During the 
war, she said, the Wombles kept a telescope in the house to watch for enemy 
submarines. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors also said Womble's house was cluttered because he collected 
newspapers, magazines and antiques. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole house was a fire hazard," Demmer said. 
</P>
<P>
Another neighbor, Betty Glass, 86, said Womble "saved everything from 1900." 
</P>
<P>
"I always wanted to go there and look things over because he had a lot of 
antiques," said Glass, whose house suffered minor damage in the fire. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, neighbors began leaving flowers in front of Womble's home. They plan 
to hold a memorial service at 3:30 p.m. Sunday at Cliff Drive Park, 2900 Cliff 
Drive in Newport Heights. 
</P>
<P>
The county coroner's office Friday evening was still looking for Womble's next 
of kin.

bottle 2 weeks ago, is a victim in a family tragedy, not a murderer, according 
to his brother, who traveled from West Germany to be with him. 
</P>
<P>
John Lynch also said his brother's psychiatrist, who was treating Joseph Lynch 
for manic-depression, is partially to blame for the events of Jan. 17. "My 
brother is the most nonviolent man I know and he's ill and he needs help, not 
punishment," John Lynch said. 
</P>
<P>
Had the psychiatrist been able to see Joseph Lynch when he and his wife called 
for help, Joseph Lynch's wife might still be alive today, John Lynch said. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, police found Helen Lynch bludgeoned to death in the couple's Santa Ana 
home. Their 13-month-old daughter, Natalie, in her mother's arms, was also 
critically injured by blows to the skull with the champagne bottle. The infant 
died at Western Medical Center in Santa Ana 2 days later. 
</P>
<P>
When Joseph Lynch was brought before Municipal Judge James P. Gray on Friday 
morning to enter a plea in connection with two counts of murder, John Lynch and 
Joseph Lynch's sister, Mary Shard, sat in a back row and looked at him through 
moist eyes. But they smiled when he waved, and they waved back. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Brief Hearing in Court 
</P>
<P>
In a brief hearing in the Santa Ana courtroom, Gray gave Joseph Lynch until 
Feb. 24 to enter a plea. Lynch's attorney wanted the time to enable his client 
to undergo a psychological evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Mary Shard and John Lynch said their brother should have received 
help from his psychiatrist as soon as he sought it. 
</P>
<P>
The day before she was killed, Helen Lynch called the office of Dr. Richard S. 
Rose, the psychiatrist, to make an appointment because the symptoms of her 
husband's manic-depression were again apparent, Rose has said. He could not be 
reached for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Lynch was given an appointment for the next day, but his brother and 
sister said they wonder why he wasn't seen right away. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Rose and the family acknowledged that Joseph Lynch was 
hospitalized for mental problems more than 2 years ago, and had been on lithium 
for his illness until recently. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to know why a doctor who's treating a patient for 
manic-depression for 2 years doesn't have time to see him within 24 hours, and 
in those 24 hours, things happened," John Lynch said. "I can't help but think 
that if he had seen him those 24 hours, we wouldn't be here and Helen would 
be." 
</P>
<P>
Rose said on Wednesday that a secretary, who took Helen Lynch's call, did not 
notice any urgency in her voice, and therefore Lynch was given an appointment 
for the next day. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if Helen made it sound urgent, but Helen wasn't a pushy sort of 
person," John Lynch said. 
</P>
<P>
"And when the appointment wasn't kept on Tuesday, why didn't anybody bother to 
find out why?" Mary Shard asked. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a tragedy," John Lynch said. "There are three victims here. My brother 
Joe is not a murderer, he's a victim." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Relatives Life Abroad 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Lynch is from Scotland and his wife was from Australia. The family had 
lived in Santa Ana for 4 years. Most of their relatives live abroad, John Lynch 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Their parents, who are in their 70s, live in a tiny village near Dundee in 
Scotland, and the mother recently suffered a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
"I broke the news to them," Shard said. "They found it very difficult to 
believe, to come to terms with any of this at all." 
</P>
<P>
Two other brothers live in England, but John Lynch said he and his sister were 
chosen to come to Santa Ana because "we may be the strongest in the family, 
though I didn't feel very strong today, I'll tell you." 
</P>
<P>
"Mary's practical. The most important thing is to protect my mom and dad," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
John Lynch, a musician and singer, and Shard, a schoolteacher, arrived in Santa 
Ana on Sunday, and have visited their brother twice in Orange County Jail, 
where he is being held without bail. They said that in their visits, they let 
him do most of the talking. They said he spoke about "everything, mostly about 
the family." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Act of Malice 
</P>
<P>
Shard and John Lynch do not deny that their brother may have struck the blows 
that ended the lives of his wife and child, but they said they will never 
believe it was an act of malice. 
</P>
<P>
"He knows that his body was there the night that it happened, but the entity 
which is my brother, that wasn't there," John Lynch said. "This wasn't a case 
of a man angry with his wife and having a fight. This was a case of two 
intelligent people who loved each other and were calling for help. 
</P>
<P>
"He tried to make an appointment, he and Helen together," John Lynch said. 
</P>
<P>
Shard and John Lynch said they saw their brother and his family every few 
years, when Joseph Lynch had to go to England for his work and could manage to 
bring Helen and the children with him. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a nervous breakdown 2 years ago, which he explained . . . to us as 
exhaustion from overwork, which we are just finding out now was something very 
different," Lynch said. "He called me and said things to me which at the time I 
thought were out of character for him." 
</P>
<P>
John Lynch said his younger brother had the reputation in the family of being 
the hard worker, the one who always did things right. John Lynch was the 
opposite. 
</P>
<P>
"He was always telling me I should change, well, not drink too much," John 
Lynch said. "When he called (at that time), he said, 'You were right after 
all.' He said that maybe the way I lived was not so bad after all. The fact 
that he said I was right in anything was out of character." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Will Return Home 
</P>
<P>
The brother and sister, who have been staying with friends of Joseph and Helen 
Lynch in Santa Ana, say they will return to their homes Feb. 5, but will be 
back for the trial. 
</P>
<P>
As awkward as the situation has been for everyone, they said their brother's 
friends and neighbors have tried to make them feel better. And they say that is 
a sign of their brother's character. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody who knows him would know it was impossible for him to hurt another 
person, not his wife and kids. That's impossible for a man like Joe," John 
Lynch said. 
</P>
<P>
The Lynches' church, First Presbyterian Church of Santa Ana, has set up a fund 
to help the family, especially the couple's two surviving children, Holly, 9, 
and Angela, 5. 
</P>
<P>
So far, said the Rev. Mike Pulsifer, the fund has collected $1,700, and offers 
of help continue to come in. The Tustin division of Crosfield Electronics, 
where Lynch worked, has told Pulsifer that employees are contributing to help 
the children. A spokeswoman for the company said both the Tustin division and 
the home office in Glen Rock, N.J., have organized efforts to help the family. 
</P>
<P>
The brother and sister said nothing has been decided about what will happen to 
the two children, who are now in the temporary custody of their maternal 
grandmother, Joan Stuart, who traveled here from Australia last week. Stuart 
and the Lynches have said there will be no disputes between them over what will 
happen to the girls. 
</P>
<P>
"Joan Stuart loves my brother like a son and still does," John said. "She said 
that to me. And for the mother of the victim, if you want to call her that, to 
tell you that, I think that's a hard thing and that means more than anything in 
this situation. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no skeletons in Joe's closet. The truth is his only and his best 
defense." 
</P>

GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI: TITANS HAVE THEIR MAN RIGHT NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Gene Wojciechowski 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About the only thing more ridiculous than John Sneed's former slick-back look 
is his title, which reads, Cal State Fullerton acting basketball coach. 
Considering the circumstances, Sneed needs the job qualifier the way he needs 
another tube of Brylcreem. 
</P>
<P>
But that's where Sneed finds himself these days, with an extra adjective in his 
title and a whole lot of uncertainty in his future. How unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton Athletic Director Ed Carroll said this week that the school soon will 
begin advertising the basketball opening in at least one NCAA trade 
publication. Meanwhile, applications already have started to trickle in. 
Carroll said Fullerton had "an institutional commitment to affirmative action 
and an open-search process." 
</P>
<P>
Hear, hear! Affirm all you want. Process until you're blue and orange in the 
face. To do otherwise would be wrong. 
</P>
<P>
But when all is said and searched, when every application has been examined, 
Sneed still should be the Titans' choice -- no ifs, ands or interims. After 
all, he was there when Fullerton needed him most. Now it's time to return the 
favor, to say nothing of the loyalty. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-six days before the season was to begin, Sneed was asked (begged?) to 
assume the coaching vacuum left by the sudden and still-not-explained 
resignation of George McQuarn. Sneed, knowing full well that the Titans were 
light on talent and depth, quickly said yes. 
</P>
<P>
He could have declined the offer, leaving the Titan administration with no 
choice but to conduct a hurried and probably ill-fated search process. 
Fullerton would have been left with a transition period as smooth as a 
cobblestone road. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Sneed stayed and took his chances on a basketball program that 
survives on a modest budget, plays in an oversized high school gym and competes 
in a conference ruled by the likes of UNLV. Isn't that worth something, mainly 
a real and legitimate opportunity to recruit and mold a team? 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton appealed to Sneed's sense of loyalty and ambition in November. It 
made him an offer he couldn't refuse: the keys to a Division I basketball 
program, of which there are only so many. It also apparently made it clear that 
the school felt duty bound to open the position for the taking at season's end. 
In essence, all Carroll could promise Sneed was an audition and nothing more. 
</P>
<P>
Sneed may or may not be the greatest coach since Adolph Rupp. Who's to say, 
what with the situation he inherited. The Titans have become an improvisational 
troupe, tinkering with this and that as they go along. Sneed is just now 
becoming comfortable with the idea of coaching power, of media relations, of 
styles and strategies and image. In politics, it's called, being 
"presidential." 
</P>
<P>
And big whoop if the Titans don't win the Big West Conference title. They 
weren't going to win it anyway, even if Bobby Knight himself were on hand to 
hurl a few folding chairs. 
</P>
<P>
This is a team that returned not one starter. Its point guard is a freshman. 
There is no true center. Sneed still doesn't have a second assistant coach. No 
time. He can't even recruit players, what with the uncertainty regarding his 
own status. 
</P>
<P>
Recruit: "Whaddya mean, you don't know if you'll be my coach if I sign with 
Fullerton?" 
</P>
<P>
Sneed: "Well, see, the thing is, I'm just an acting coach right now. I won't 
know anything for sure until, well, maybe mid-March, at the earliest." 
</P>
<P>
Recruit: "Uh, Coach, signing day is in April. What happens if they hire someone 
else? Then what do I do?" 
</P>
<P>
Sneed: "Beautiful weather we're having, isn't it? There's such a freshness in 
the air." 
</P>
<P>
Recruit: "Later, man." 
</P>
<P>
Someone needs to explain to the Fullerton administration that recruits aren't a 
patient sort. Recruits don't understand institutional policy. They do, however, 
understand that Sneed might not be around next season, which tends to undermine 
their interests in becoming Titans. After all, why make a commitment to 
Fullerton when Fullerton won't make a commitment to Sneed? 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, Sneed has managed to remain diplomatic about the school's decision to 
begin, as Carroll puts it, "our regular process." Who cares if the regular 
process was on winter break back in November? 
</P>
<P>
But when asked recently if it was hard to recruit players when the word acting 
preceded your title, Sneed answered, "Is it hard for a married man to go out 
and get a date?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
By late Monday evening, the Titans could be 9-8 overall and 4-4 in the Big 
West, which isn't half bad considering they're still searching for the right 
style. Most recently, a zone press has sparked the beginnings of a running 
team. It also has spawned talk of a respectable season, maybe something in the 
12-14 victory range. We'll see. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sneed develops his own identity as a head coach. He has become more 
assertive on the sidelines. He has slowly reshaped the Titans with a variety of 
strategies and personnel moves. He has displayed a sense of humor, as well as a 
bit of a bark. 
</P>
<P>
This is Sneed's one big chance. So far, he has done himself proud. Now it is 
Fullerton and Carroll's turn to do the same. 
</P>

RELIEVER CLEAR COMES BACK TO ANGELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Right-handed reliever Mark Clear, traded by the Angels 8 years ago and released 
by the Milwaukee Brewers last October, signed a 1-year contract with the Angels 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Clear, 32, was 1-0 with a 2.79 earned-run average in 25 games for Milwaukee 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
Clear, with a career 71-49 record and 83 saves, made his major league debut 
with the Angels in 1979 and was 11-5 with 14 saves. He was 11-11 the next 
season, then was traded to Boston with Carney Lansford and Rick Miller in 
exchange for Rick Burleson and Butch Hobson. 
</P>
<P>
In 5 seasons with the Red Sox, Clear was 35-23 with a 4.26 ERA and 38 saves in 
225 appearances. He was 14-10 with 22 saves in 3 years with Milwaukee.

ELDER-CARE NEEDS OF ORANGE COUNTY WORKERS STUDIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGORY CROUCH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For nearly 2 years, Gayle Thompson spent part of her workday at National 
Education Corp. in Irvine worrying not about business, but about a family 
member who needed constant attention. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson was trying to take care of her frail, elderly mother at home and hold 
on to a full-time job at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes she called her house as many as five times a day. "And if my mother 
didn't come to the phone, I panicked and would drive home to make sure she 
hadn't fallen or become unconscious," said Thompson, 49, an NEC benefits 
administrator. Several months ago, Thompson had to put her 79-year old mother 
in a Lake Forest nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson is one of the millions of working Americans searching for ways to 
balance the demands of the workplace and the responsibilities of caring for the 
elderly. On Friday she joined about 150 Orange County health-care 
professionals, social workers and corporate representatives at a conference to 
discuss potential solutions. 
</P>
<P>
Participants agreed that care for the elderly is a growing problem that 
employers eventually must address. But so far, few companies in Orange County 
have been willing to even consider the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Recent studies indicate that employee concerns about elderly relatives have 
increased absenteeism and turnover and lowered productivity at big and small 
businesses alike. 
</P>
<P>
"The cost to companies is astronomical," said Roy Azarnoff, director of 
Eldercare Management Group, a Dana Point consulting firm. "Only recently have 
some of them begun to realize it." 
</P>
<P>
The Travelers Insurance Cos. has found through surveys that one of every five 
employees older than 30 are trying to care for an elderly relative. 
</P>
<P>
The surveys show that those workers on average spend 10.2 hours a week to care 
for those relatives, with 8% spending 35 hours or more. Often, this goes on for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an issue that must be addressed," state Sen. Marian Bergeson told 
participants at Friday's conference. "It's not just going to go away." 
</P>
<P>
The most common types of assistance being provided by younger family members 
include transportation, shopping and companionship. Sometimes those needs must 
be addressed during working hours. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, employees can't fully concentrate on their work under those 
conditions," said Mike Shore, an IBM spokesman in Armonk Village, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, IBM will celebrate the 1-year anniversary of its elder-care 
program, the first of its kind in the country. 
</P>
<P>
The computer giant put together a national network of 175 community-based 
organizations to assist IBM's 223,000 employees in finding care for their 
elderly relatives. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, IBM could put an Orange County employee in touch with the 
appropriate agency to help him find a home nurse for his mother in Chicago. The 
referral service is free. 
</P>
<P>
IBM won't say what the program has cost, but it claims productivity is up among 
the 8,000 employees who have used it. "There is a bottom-line benefit for us in 
doing this," Shore said. 
</P>
<P>
So far, however, none of Orange County's larger corporations has adopted a 
similar program. And at least one survey says they probably won't anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
Personnel Journal, a Costa Mesa publication, reported in June that nine out of 
10 personnel directors in a national survey said their companies had no plans 
to develop an elder-care program, even though seven out of 10 said it affected 
worker output and morale. 
</P>
<P>
About 8% of those surveyed said care for the elderly as a potential corporate 
benefit should be "ignored because it's not a real issue." 
</P>
<P>
Those who believe that corporations should adopt elder-care programs say the 
situation is only going to worsen as the number of senior citizens increases 
and as more women enter the work force. 
</P>
<P>
Conference participants are calling for companies to survey their work forces 
and set up focus groups to work on the problems they find. Some say businesses 
should set up adult day-care centers or offer employees flexible working hours. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people prefer to work 10 hours a day, 4 days a week so they have an extra 
day to take care of mom," Azarnoff said. 
</P>
<P>
Several organizations provide counseling to people with elderly relatives. They 
include the Orange Regional Resource Center in Fullerton, which sponsored 
Friday's conference, and the Senior Citizens Information and Referral in Santa 
Ana.

CHRISTMAS HIRINGS CREDITED FOR DECEMBER FIGURES; 
</P>
<P>
COUNTY'S JOBLESS RATE DROPS TO 12-MONTH LOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County's jobless rate for December fell to a 12-month low of 2.5%, 
reflecting the traditional Christmas season hiring frenzy by retailers. 
</P>
<P>
In November, the county's unemployment rate was 2.9%. 
</P>
<P>
Because of its dynamic and diverse economy -- and to some extent because 
housing costs are so high that many unemployed people cannot afford to remain 
here for long -- the county's jobless rate has been among the lowest in the 
nation since mid-1986, according to state Employment Development Department 
labor market analysts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tied for Lowest 
</P>
<P>
December's rate tied the 2.5% rate of December, 1987, for the lowest on record 
in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
It also was the third lowest jobless rate in the state last month, trailing San 
Mateo County's 2.2% and Marin County's 2.4%. The statewide unemployment rate 
was 4.3% in December, while the national rate was 5.3%. 
</P>
<P>
Because there always are some people between jobs in any urban area, most 
economists consider a jobless rate of 4% or lower to represent virtual full 
employment. 
</P>
<P>
For the year, according to the EDD's count, almost 64,000 new jobs were created 
in Orange County. That figure, however, includes part-time and temporary 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
In all, the EDD said 1.33 million people were working in December compared to 
1.27 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Most of these jobs were in the business and personal service industries. 
Banking, real estate, financial services and wholesale and retail trade all 
posted gains for the year, as did state and local government employment. 
</P>
<P>
Employers in the retail trades reported 222,600 jobs in December, up 5,500 from 
November and an increase of 10,300 jobs, or 4.9%, from December, 1987, said EDD 
labor analyst Connie Lau. 
</P>
<P>
November and December are the traditional months when retailers and wholesalers 
temporarily increase their work forces to handle the holiday season crunch. The 
county's jobless rate typically increases in the first quarter as most of those 
temporary jobs come to an end. 
</P>
<P>
The total number of unemployed workers in the county last month was set at 
33,600, down from 40,300 in November but up 3% from the 32,600 reported a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The EDD's official jobless tally does not include the so-called hard core 
unemployed who have given up looking for work or have exhausted state and 
federal unemployment benefits.

MANY MORE WORKERS ARE BEING EXPLOITED, COUNTY REPORT SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Worker exploitation has increased dramatically in Orange County, and it will 
end only if government agencies are given the resources to investigate 
complaints against employers and enforce existing labor laws, according to a 
county Human Relations Commission report released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In the past 3 years, the number of workers complaining to the commission about 
abuse at the hands of their bosses has more than quadrupled, the report says. 
Non-payment of wages is the most common labor code violation, and undocumented 
workers are the most common victims. 
</P>

"The Division of Labor is undermanned and is not able to investigate adequately 
the number of complaints," said Dr. Daniel H. Ninburg, chairman of the 
commission. "With the collection of lost wages from the employers, there's 
difficulty in follow-through." The result is a growing class of workers who 
cannot pay for rent, food or medical care but who fear losing their jobs, bad 
as those jobs may be. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, the Human Relations Commission received about three or four worker 
complaints a month; by spring, 1988, the average number was 20. The commission 
convened a forum on Labor Day to find out why there are so many more complaints 
now and how to address them. 
</P>
<P>
What they heard was a litany of complaints from workers, overloaded social 
service groups and law enforcement agencies and from ethical employers who 
argued that they cannot afford to compete with their unscrupulous counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
The commission based its report and recommendations on testimony heard at the 
forum. 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of the matter, the report says, is the so-called underground 
economy, "an extensive black market" that not only affects workers and 
employers but also robs the state and federal governments of tax revenue and 
adds to the burden on social service agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The employers at fault, experts say, pay cash when they pay wages at all, keep 
no records and fail to provide mandated safeguards for their workers. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, the last year the underground economy was studied in depth in 
California, the Commission on California State Government Organization and 
Economy estimated that such activity accounted for as much as $40 billion in 
business transactions annually and defrauded the state of more than $2 billion 
a year in taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Among the major findings in the report: 
</P>
<P>
* There is an "alarming incidence," particularly in the construction and 
landscaping industries, of workers being abandoned without being paid. 
</P>
<P>
* The State Labor Code is unclear regarding the extent of the state Labor 
Commission's ability to collect wages on behalf of defrauded workers. There is, 
therefore, a "low success rate" in collecting from employers who ignore 
commission decisions. 
</P>
<P>
* Labor commission budget cuts, including the 25% reduction in 1983, have 
"severely limited that agency's ability to adequately handle the labor abuse 
that exists." 
</P>
<P>
* Workers' ignorance of their basic rights and their fear of retribution 
compound the problem, as does the fact that many employers are unaware of basic 
labor code provisions. 
</P>
<P>
* Exploitation of domestic workers "goes relatively unchecked." Further, when 
these workers are terminated without pay, "they are not only unemployed but 
also left homeless." 
</P>
<P>
The report makes a score of recommendations for ways to combat the problems and 
to educate the workers. 
</P>
<P>
The report will be sent to the Board of Supervisors, government leaders in each 
of the 28 cities in Orange County and to the Legislature, Ninburg said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think one of the most important recommendations is for the state Legislature 
to pass legislation clarifying the responsibility of the labor commission to 
carry through the collection process," Ninburg said. 
</P>
<P>
"And I think we have to educate employers and laborers as to the rights of the 
laborer and the responsibilities of the employer."

S&amp;L CHIEF HEADS GROUP FIGHTING UTILITY MERGER; 
</P>
<P>
GREAT AMERICAN'S LUCE CHOSEN TO CHAIR MOVE FOR LOCAL TAKEOVER OF SDG&amp;E 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Great American First Savings Bank Chairman Gordon Luce agreed Friday to chair a 
new group of civic and business leaders that will actively oppose Southern 
California Edison's proposed merger with San Diego Gas &amp; Electric. 
</P>
<P>
The committee, announced during a Friday press conference in Mayor Maureen 
O'Connor's office, has won support -- but, as yet, no funding -- from the 
Greater San Diego Chamber of Commerce and the San Diego Economic Development 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the committee will "do everything possible to avoid this takeover by 
an L.A.-based utility," Chamber President Lee Grissom said Friday. "We're in 
this for as long as it takes." 
</P>
<P>
The chamber will spend "whatever it takes" to halt the proposed merger, Grissom 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Will Support Legislation 
</P>
<P>
The members agreed Friday that the San Diego County Water Authority should 
complete a study that will determine if a local government body should take 
over SDG&amp;E. 
</P>
<P>
The committee will also support legislation in Sacramento that would give the 
county's voters the right to vote on taking over SDG&amp;E. 
</P>
<P>
Luce, who did not attend the meeting, was not available for comment Friday. "He 
wants to talk to each member of the committee first before he talks to 
reporters," Great American spokesman Ken Ulrich said. 
</P>
<P>
Luce's decision to chair the committee surprised some longtime San Diego 
business leaders because the Great American executive is known as a steadfast 
Republican who disdains unnecessary government intervention into private 
enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
Luce is best known as the forward-thinking executive who transformed San Diego 
Federal Savings &amp; Loan, a relatively tiny institution, into Great American, 
now one of the state's largest S&amp;Ls. Great American fueled its growth 
partly through the acquisition of S&amp;Ls that operate in Arizona, Washington, 
Montana and Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
The committee, which brought together business and civic leaders, has "raised 
interesting philosophical questions about the role of the free market and 
government's role," according to one local businessman. 
</P>
<P>
Grissom acknowledged that the chamber has rarely opposed business decisions 
made by privately held companies. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the chamber did not oppose Pacific Southwest Airlines' 1988 merger 
with Washington, D.C.-based USAir Group. Interestingly, both Luce and Edison 
Chairman Howard Allen were members of the PSA board that endorsed USAir's 
unsolicited merger offer. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor on Friday applauded Grissom and chamber Chairwoman Gail Stoorza for 
taking "a leadership role" in the effort to keep Rosemead-based Edison from 
taking over SDG&amp;E. 
</P>
<P>
"We face a tough uphill battle," said O'Connor, who quipped that San Diegans 
are "not like Howard Allen or (SDG&amp;E Chairman) Tom Page" who can spend 
shareholder funds to promote the merger. 
</P>
<P>
Besides O'Connor, Luce and Grissom, the committee also includes: EDC President 
Dan Pegg, Copley Press executive Herb Klein, developer Mike Madigan, Stoorza, 
past chamber Chairman Bill Nelson, contractor Warner Lusardi and Hal Gardner, 
an executive with the Ernst &amp; Whinney accounting firm. 
</P>
<P>
More committee members will be named, Grissom said. 
</P>
<P>
The committee was an outgrowth of anti-Edison sentiment at the chamber and the 
EDC, a nonprofit, quasi-government agency that promotes economic growth in San 
Diego. Board members at both organizations had previously voted to oppose the 
merger. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor suggested that Allen has not yet realized that "some cities perhaps 
are not for sale . . . (and) San Diego is a proud city." 
</P>
<P>
Grissom attacked Edison's recent newspaper advertising campaign, which included 
pro-Edison testimonials from civic leaders in cities such as El Segundo, Duarte 
and Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
"San Diego is not a suburb around Los Angeles," Grissom said. "San Diego has 
its own distinct character and personality." 
</P>
<P>
SDG&amp;E and Edison spokesmen on Friday downplayed the committee's 
significance. 
</P>
<P>
SDG&amp;E "does not intend to disassociate itself from either organization," 
SDG&amp;E spokesman Dave Smith said. "We understand that, from time to time, 
we'll have differences with the chamber and EDC." 
</P>
<P>
Edison "continues to believe that the merger of SDG&amp;E and Edison will be in 
the best interests of the people of San Diego," Edison spokesman Lewis Phelps 
said. "If we didn't believe that the merger was very much in the interest of 
San Diego electric customers, we never would have proposed it."

FLEETWOOD PITCHES IN FOR PAL BARDENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Along with a bride of 8 months, Mick Fleetwood of Fleetwood Mac has been 
sharing his Malibu digs with Pete Bardens, one-time leader of a band called 
Camel, and that's just for openers: 
</P>
<P>
Fleetwood also is sharing his manager with Bardens, lent his drumming to tracks 
on the keyboard player's "Speed of Light" album, and now is sandwiching 11 
far-flung Bardens concert appearances (including one at the Coach House in San 
Juan Capistrano tonight) between new Fleetwood Mac recording sessions. 
</P>
<P>
It's only fair, perhaps, since Fleetwood credits Bardens with giving him his 
start in the music business some eons ago, in pre-Beatle Britain. 
</P>
<P>
"We do go back rather a long way," Fleetwood recalled. "When I was 16 I lived 
next door to him in Nottinghill Gate in London, and he had heard me playing 
drums. I'd never played in a band at all, only sat at home and played with the 
radio. He came over and asked if I'd like to play with this band. He wasn't in 
it then; he was playing manager because he was the only one with a suit." 
</P>
<P>
Before long, Bardens was more aptly seated behind the keyboards and the pair 
performed together in a number of early '60s British bands, the last of which, 
Shotgun Express, also sported a young Rod Stewart. Fleetwood sojourned briefly 
with John Mayall's Bluesbreakers and then, with bassist John McVie, founded the 
unkillable Fleetwood Mac in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
Bardens, meanwhile, had played with Van Morrison's Them before becoming the 
principal member of Camel, a '70s progressive rock band that never enjoyed an 
American following to match its success in Europe. Bardens didn't find a 
footing in the popular market until 1986 when his "Seen One Earth" album 
connected with new age radio markets. 
</P>
<P>
Fleetwood and Bardens had remained friends through the years, Fleetwood said, 
"and because I really liked ('Seen One Earth') and started hearing it on the 
radio, I became really anxious to see something happen with him. I'm committed 
to doing all I can to help him out." 
</P>
<P>
The tour dates -- which also include a show at the Roxy in West Hollywood 
Monday night -- mark not only the first time in about 20 years that the two 
have performed on stage together, but also Bardens' first live outing since he 
toured with Van Morrison a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
Reached before the opening show of the tour in San Francisco Wednesday, Bardens 
said, "I've felt there was a big chunk of something missing from my life; 
playing in front of an audience (had been) very much a part of my existence, 
and then to be starved of it for a long period of time, I really felt a loss. 
I'm glad to be having a second crack of the whip, and very glad to have Mick 
helping me." 
</P>
<P>
Bardens, 40, describes his largely instrumental music as "breaking the 
boundaries between new age and new progressive"; he notes that "Speed of 
Light's" instrumental tracks have garnered WAVE play while its rockier vocal 
tracks were picked up by the album-oriented KLOS and KMPC. While Fleetwood 
knows his presence on the tour will draw greater attention to the shows, he's 
also being careful to not let his celebrity draw away from Bardens and his 
four-piece band. Rather than install himself on the drum throne, Fleetwood is 
augmenting the group as percussionist. 
</P>
<P>
"It's Pete's band, and his drummer, Jethro (Foxx), a good friend of mine, is a 
very, very good drummer. So I thought it would be more correct for me to add to 
that, to be one more part of the band, than to come in and kick someone off the 
drum kit." 
</P>
<P>
Fleetwood's hands won't be wanting for work, as he's bringing an array, 
including timbales, tom-toms, bell trees, African talking drums, shakers, 
rattlers, rain sticks and his legendary waistcoat, loaded with synthesizer drum 
pads he triggers by slapping himself moderately silly. 
</P>
<P>
Fleetwood admits that it isn't only altruism that is motivating his 
participation: "I like any chance to play. When I go to a club, if someone asks 
me to sit in -- it doesn't matter who they are or what type of band -- I'll 
invariably get up there and do it." 
</P>
<P>
Despite Fleetwood Mac's stadium-level success, Fleetwood is no stranger to the 
small club stage. During the band's long hauls in dry-dock, he hits the road 
with his own group, Mick Fleetwood's Zoo (which also features current Mac 
member Billy Burnette). 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot more relaxed doing the clubs. You don't have the military aspect 
which is necessary when you have 40 odd people traveling with you on the scale 
Fleetwood Mac does. When the Zoo goes out, we decide we want to do some gigs, 
just get in a bus, help set the equipment up, and do it." 
</P>
<P>
While he plans to still slip some Zoo dates in, he anticipates that Fleetwood 
Mac will occupy most of his year. The group will enter the studio in a few days 
with producer Greg Ladanyi; Fleetwood hopes to emerge in 7 months with a new 
album and plans for a tour late in the year. It's a crucial album for the group 
-- the first since its breakthrough 1975 "Fleetwood Mac" to be made without 
Lindsey Buckingham. Fleetwood doesn't seem worried, though. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone's feeling good about it. We've got a good starting block section of 
songs. . . . I think the band as it is now (with Burnette and Rick Vito 
replacing Buckingham) is going to be more reminiscent of the kind of flavor of 
our early days. That's already started, I think, just from digesting how the 
band was working on the road. I suspect there's going to be a sense of more 
freedom and more involvement. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Lindsey's influence was a very important part and I'm not diminishing 
it in the slightest, but the way Lindsey worked, and increasingly so near the 
end, was a little bit insular, where sometimes you felt like you couldn't 
partake in some of what was going on. I think the band is going to feel very 
much more of a unit than it has felt for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the band's 11 lineups, Fleetwood said, a constant has held the group 
together. "I think it's fair comment that throughout all the incarnations of 
Fleetwood Mac, basically John McVie and I have had a built-in desire and need 
for a band to play with, so it sort of takes care of itself. 
</P>
<P>
"The drummer and the bass player don't want to be sitting there without a band, 
so consequently we've been very intent on never even for one moment allowing 
the thought of giving up. There would always be us two sitting there saying, 
'Well, we ain't going anywhere, so who's next?' That's certainly not negating 
the importance and uniqueness of the people that are in the band, but that is 
the thread that goes through all the years and years." 
</P>
<P>
Fleetwood is still at work on an autobiography ("I like the unhurtful tone of 
David Niven's books; I won't be opening the private Pandora's box of Fleetwood 
Mac") and is anxious to do more acting work, having appeared in "The Running 
Man." But his prime professional commitment, after Fleetwood Mac, is aiding 
Bardens' career, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I like everything he does, the space in his music and the way he plays . . . 
as a friend, I want him to be as successful and accessible as possible. By the 
time we make the next album I think that will be the case." 
</P>
<P>
Both performers claim that the disparity between their fortunes has never 
strained their friendship, and Bardens says he isn't dissatisfied with the 
modest success and the opportunity to play music that he's had. He is, however, 
looking at properties in Malibu, and wouldn't mind if Fleetwood's prediction 
for his next album came true. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't had the kind of success Fleetwood Mac had," Bardens said, "but Camel 
was a pretty successful band for the time in Europe, and that was satisfying, 
as is what's happening for me now. It's not 'Rumours' or anything, but it is 
growing, and I'm really hoping the tour is going to spark a bit of a fire. 
Maybe the next album will be my 'Rumours.' Why not?" 
</P>
