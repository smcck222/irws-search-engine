JOURNEY OF A HEALER BY SARA LAWRENCE LIGHTFOOT (A MERLOYD LAWRENCE

By Phyllis Crockett, Crockett is a Washington correspondent for National Public 
Radio who often covers issues concerning the African-American community.

<TEXT>
<P>
When we look at a person, we tend to see them as they are now. We seldom think 
about how they got that way. "Balm in Gilead" is the story of how Dr. Margaret 
Morgan Lawrence became who she is: a successful retired child psychiatrist, 
widow of the equally successful sociologist Dr. Charles Lawrence, and mother of 
three children who are successful in their careers. The book probes how she 
achieved that success despite the psychological scars of racism and sexism. 
</P>
<P>
The book's author is her daughter, Sara Lawrence Lightfoot, a tenured professor 
of education at Harvard, and a winner of the MacArthur Prize, which enabled her 
to complete the book. Lightfoot takes us on the journey that led to her 
mother's success. 
</P>
<P>
Margaret Morgan was reared in a middle-class black family in the brutally 
segregated Deep South of the 1920s. Her father was one of the few Negro 
Episcopal priests. Her mother was a schoolteacher. Margaret Morgan was 
privileged. But just below the surface there were problems. Mary, her mother, 
suffered regularly from debilitating depressions brought on by her minister 
husband's frequent moves to new towns. 
</P>
<P>
"When the Morgans arrived in Widewater, Mary took to her bed. Each uprooting 
had disastrous effects on her energy and spirit. Mary would go to bed and stay 
there for weeks, unresponsive, unavailable, 'with her face to the wall,' 'as 
though she were dead.' " 
</P>
<P>
We learn of the fears and sadness of the young Margaret. As a little 
brown-skinned girl, she lived in the shadow of her nearly white-skinned, 
golden-haired older brother who died a baby. It was her brother's death, which 
happened before she was born, that inspired 10-year-old Margaret to become a 
doctor. She wanted to save other children from death. 
</P>
<P>
In pursuit of that goal at age 14, she decided to go to New York as a high 
school student to get a better education. Her parents supported her decision. 
In Harlem she lived with her domineering maternal grandmother, her 
overprotective aunts and her psychotic uncle. She got the foundation she needed 
for college and medical school, not just an education but exposure to important 
black women, including a leading physician. 
</P>
<P>
"All these women conveyed their expectations through praise and admonition, but 
mostly by example; by the way they conducted themselves, communicated their 
thoughts, and pursued their goals; by their striking combination of personal 
ambition and community responsibility. Margaret revered them and wanted to 
emulate them in her own life." 
</P>
<P>
In 1932 she arrived at Cornell University on a full-tuition scholarship, the 
only black undergraduate on campus. No blacks were allowed in the dormitory. 
She worked as a live-in maid for a white family to earn room and board. On her 
first summer home from college in Vicksburg, Miss., she meets Charles Lawrence, 
a Morehouse College student. By summer's end they are talking about marriage 
but they continue their studies and wait five years before getting married. 
</P>
<P>
Despite good grades as an undergraduate, Cornell University turned her down for 
medical school. She recalls the dean telling her that ". . . 'I was a very good 
student and a promising physician, but that I would not be admitted. He said he 
was sorry.' . . . Margaret couldn't believe what she heard. Still stunned, she 
heard his explanation for the rejection. 'You know,' he said without a hint of 
emotion in his voice, 'twenty-five years ago there was a Negro man admitted to 
Cornell Medical School and he didn't work out. . . . He got tuberculosis.' " 
Such is the logic of racism. She was admitted to Columbia Medical School, the 
only black during her four years there. 
</P>
<P>
The racism and isolation she encountered in the North differed from the racism 
of the South. It was clear-cut in Mississippi, there was a separate black 
society. A white child called her nigger, but Margaret took it in stride. "I 
was not overwhelmed by these things." But in the North she felt under attack. 
</P>
<P>
"She never knew when racism would appear and in what form. She would begin to 
get comfortable in a setting, begin to trust the people surrounding her, and a 
subtle remark or gesture would make her feel vaguely uneasy. Then the dull pain 
would come . . . so much energy had to be put into fathoming the scene, 
discerning the nuance, and waiting for the surprise attack." 
</P>
<P>
She is able to achieve professionally and personally not only in spite of but 
perhaps because the psychological trauma she experienced pushed her to find 
solutions. She first worked as a pediatrician at Harlem Hospital before 
becoming the first black trainee at the Columbia University Psychoanalytic 
Center and going on to do pioneering work with inner-city families. 
</P>
<P>
Although she was not reared in an emotionally healthy home, she married a man 
who was. Drs. Margaret Morgan Lawrence and Charles Lawrence combined career and 
family in an age before women's liberation and microwave ovens. They were 
committed to serving the black community. Together they lived and worked for 
nearly 50 years until his death. 
</P>
<P>
Their daughter, the book's author, paints a picture of Charles Lawrence as 
Everywoman's dream . . . strong, supportive, affectionate, dependable, 
successful, creative and brilliant. The book quotes many of his letters to his 
wife and children. The portrait is of a truly remarkable couple motivated by 
their love and desire to help the race. Given the times in which the couple 
began their careers in the 1940s, this would be an exceptional story even if 
the couple were white. 
</P>
<P>
This is an important and inspiring book because blacks and non-blacks need to 
know that people like Dr. Margaret Morgan Lawrence and her husband are and have 
been around for years. In certain academic circles, the Lawrence family is 
well-known, but too few of us know of them or people like them. 
</P>
<P>
The rise of the black middle class in this century is overshadowed by the 
continuing problems of what has come to be known as the underclass. While it is 
important for those problems to be examined, it is equally important to examine 
what works. 
</P>
<P>
We need more books on positive African-American role models that can be used in 
school to help inspire a new generation to know that as others achieved, so can 
they. We all need to be reminded or taught the potential of the human spirit 
despite great odds when one's mind is free. We see that potential realized in 
the life of Margaret Lawrence. 
</P>
<P>
The book gives us insight into the problems young Margaret overcomes. We see 
what she's made of. The book's major weakness is that it gives no sense of any 
conflict that may have helped to strengthen her marriage. 
</P>
<P>
When Charles and Margaret were married they were two post-graduate students. 
They reared three children. The book does not discuss common family problems. 
For example, there's no hint that the husband or children resented the wife and 
mother's time away or vice versa. If this high-powered career couple, parents 
of three, managed to avoid all serious marital conflicts in more than four 
decades of marriage, that is worthy of another book and at least an explicit 
mention in this one. 
</P>
<P>
In all likelihood, the loving daughter and author is unwilling or unable to 
give any sense of this aspect of her parents' lives. The book also occasionally 
lapses into a sterile academic writing style. The best writing is in the simple 
retelling of the family's intriguing history. "Balm in Gilead" is part of the 
Radcliffe Biography Series on extraordinary women. The extraordinary life of 
Dr. Margaret Morgan Lawrence is well worth reading and celebrating.

THE AUDEN-ISHERWOOD HIGH JINKS; 
</P>
<P>
PLAYS; 
</P>
<P>
BY W. H. AUDEN AND CHRISTOPHER ISHERWOOD; AND OTHER DRAMATIC WRITINGS BY W. H. 
AUDEN, 1928-1938; VOLUME ONE OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF W. H. AUDEN EDITED BY 
EDWARD MENDELSON (PRINCETON UNIVERSITY PRESS: $39.50; 676 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Thom Gunn, Gunn, a poet and critic, won The Times' 1988 Robert Kirsch Award. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the plays here is "The Ascent of F6," perhaps the most successful of W. 
H. Auden's collaborations with Christopher Isherwood. Years afterwards, 
Isherwood described how the noise of an avalanche, required in the action, was 
suggested in two early productions. In London it was done "by setting up a 
microphone in the backstage lavatory and flushing the toilet. The amplified 
noise was awesome." And in New York, after "a pause of dead silence, . . . 
somewhere in the back of the building, with terrific violence, a door was 
slammed." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, in Auden's early poetry, the familiar is made strange and the 
strange familiar. The "cigarette-end smoldering on a border/At the first garden 
party of the year" is the portent of a dying class. When commonplace detail is 
charged with such significance, the effect is inherently dramatic, as we can 
see in the movies of Hitchcock, who started about the same time as Auden. The 
effect is positively exhilarating: Putting down the book, coming out of the 
movie, we recognize a world ominous with impending change, full of spies and 
conspirators. 
</P>
<P>
For the young Auden, then, it seems almost inevitable that his prodigious 
productivity in the 1930s should have included the verse drama and the 
contributions to documentary movies and radio brought together here, in the 
first of eight volumes, and admirably edited by Edward Mendelson, his 
bibliographer and biographer. Also collected are the fragments of a lost play, 
alternate scenes to others, and two previously unpublished plays. Though three 
of the plays were collaborations, the initiating impulse was essentially 
Auden's, and it appears to be he who defined the type of drama being written. 
</P>
<P>
This drama is the antithesis of Shavian realism, and has much in common with 
German and French experiments of the time. Though Auden admitted to the 
influence of Berlin vaudeville, he was much interested in introducing elements 
from English folk plays, where characters had names like Pickled Herring and 
Blue Britches, or from Mystery Plays like the Towneley Second Shepherd's Play, 
where a thief swaddles a stolen sheep like a baby and hides it in a cradle. He 
valued comic incongruity, and characters break into doggerel with no 
provocation, or start dancing or stab people with hatpins. In "Paid on Both 
Sides," "a charade," he presented feuding Norse heroes in a "Prep School 
atmosphere." In "The Dog Beneath the Skin," the hero goes in search of a 
missing heir accompanied by a dog who is actually the heir himself in disguise; 
audiences must have recalled the popular English pantomime of "Puss in Boots." 
</P>
<P>
I should perhaps say readers rather than audiences, because these plays are 
seldom performed -- in fact I have never had a chance to see any of them on the 
stage. As dramatic writing, the early plays in particular are disorganized and 
difficult; and the last collaboration, "On the Frontier," is badly dated by its 
schematic plot and by the vaguely Marxist cliches of its writing. (" . . . 
Truth shall flower and Error explode/And the people be free then to choose 
their own road!") Beside Auden and Kallman's libretto for "The Rake's Progress" 
and the penetrating and subtle later fictions of Isherwood, these plays seem 
juvenile and amateurish. Eric Bentley called them "sketchy extravaganzas," and 
certainly none of them have the intensity or dramatic force of Bertolt Brecht's 
best work, which they loosely resemble in type. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, this collection is, above all, fun to read, full as it is of 
memorable high jinks. In "On the Frontier," there is a scene between three war 
correspondents written as a parody of the witches' meeting in "Macbeth"; in 
"The Dog Beneath the Skin," we are shown a lunatic asylum in a Fascist state 
called Westland, in which the First Lunatic says in a patriotic speech to his 
fellows: "Let us never forget that we are Westlanders first and madmen second"; 
in both this and an earlier play there are conversations between the hero's 
left foot and right foot, one version by Auden and the other by Isherwood, both 
funny; and best of all is the unforgettable climax to "The Ascent of F6," in 
which the hero discovers that the fabled Demon on the peak of the Himalayan 
mountain, robed and hooded, is his own mother -- a marvelous joke about the 
Oedipus complex. 
</P>
<P>
There is fertility of invention not only in incident but in the writing itself. 
In the earliest poetry, full of gnomic obscurities, the young Auden's meaning 
seems to be trying not always successfully to catch up with his language. But 
in "Dog" there is a long and brilliant survey, broken up into choruses, of 
Britain and Europe during the Depression, "barns falling, fences broken." There 
is elsewhere a handful of Auden's loveliest songs in the tradition of Thomas 
Campion and Tennyson: for example, "O lurcher loving collier black as night" 
from a documentary movie called "Coal Face" (a lurcher was a dog much bred as a 
hobby by British coal miners). And there are "Happy the hare at morning" and 
"Doom is darker, deeper than any sea-dingle," originally choruses from plays, 
later independent poems, which seem to me a valid and effective public poetry 
for the '30s rather as Ginsberg's poetry of oration was for the '50s and '60s. 
</P>
<P>
Auden was always a virtuoso, something of a showoff -- and it is a pleasure to 
watch him showing off.

PLAYFUL INTERSECTIONS OF ART AND LIFE;

<P>
THE LYRE OF ORPHEUS; 
</P>
<P>
ROBERTSON DAVIES (VIKING: $19.95; 472 PP.; 0-670-82416-X) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Paul Skenazy, Skenazy teaches literature at UC Santa Cruz. His critical 
study of James M. Cain will be published this winter.

<TEXT>
<P>
Robertson Davies loves to mock the complacency of his native Canada -- "the 
home of Modified Rapture," he calls it. All his work uses satire to encourage 
sentiment, challenge what passes for decency with the immodesties of passion. 
He writes with a wit inherited from the formalities of the English novel 
tradition, but his heroes are Jung, Rabelais, and the cultural desperadoes who 
would defy civilization to inject it with life. 
</P>
<P>
The lyre of Orpheus of Davies' title is supposed to permit entrance to the 
underworld, and that's where Davies wants to guide us in this third and 
concluding volume of his most recent trilogy. Characters and incidents from 
"The Rebel Angels" and "What's Bred in the Bone" (the two previous volumes on 
the Cornish family and their friends around and about Ploughwright College) 
return in "The Lyre of Orpheus," but brief summaries provide enough background 
to let the action stand on its own. 
</P>
<P>
"The Lyre of Orpheus" is a talky book -- a playful series of conversations and 
arguments about the intersections and contradictions of life and art. Arthur 
Cornish's Foundation, established with his deceased uncle Francis' money, 
proposes to support a disheveled, if talented, graduate student, Hulda 
Schnackenburg, as she attempts to complete the score for, and mount a 
production of, an opera based on the Arthurian legend of the Round Table, 
"Arthur of Britain, or, The Magnificent Cuckold," left unfinished in the 19th 
Century by E. T. A. Hoffman. 
</P>
<P>
The effort enlists the talents of cleric and teacher Simon Darcourt as 
librettist, of young Geraint Powell as director, of composer Dr. Gunilla 
Dahl-Soot as Schnackenburg's mentor, and of Arthur Cornish, his wife Maria, her 
fortuneteller mother, and other assorted deans, professors, musicologists, and 
lovers and critics of the arts. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, Darcourt's work as the biographer of uncle Francis Cornish has led to 
a startling discovery about a famous triptych, "The Marriage of Cana," 
attributed to the so-called "Alchemical Master" and supposedly painted in the 
16th Century. The painting proves to be the work of Cornish himself, with 
significant people from his life providing models for the various figures. 
Patron of the arts Francis, then, turns out to be artist Francis, creator of a 
triptych in a traditional style that mirrors, and masks, his own life and 
times. 
</P>
<P>
And this is also what Davies is doing with his "Cana" and his opera on Arthur 
in this, the third panel of his third trilogy of novels. Near the end of the 
book, Darcourt quotes Keats that "A Man's life of any worth is a continual 
allegory," explaining that each life has "a buried myth" that takes 
"figurative" shapes "few eyes can see." Davies reveals something of his past 
and his years as a teacher and dramatist and fiction writer in this story of 
how art -- painting, poetry, opera, and the stylish life -- bares the face of 
the present in the form of the past. 
</P>
<P>
He throws in literary and cultural asides to everything from Germanic versus 
Latinate roots of words to the Tarot and Lewis Carroll's mock-epic, "The 
Hunting of the Snark," to insist on the parallel paths of culture and life. (He 
even has Hoffman's disembodied ghost, cast off in a limbo reserved for artists 
who leave their work unfinished, comment at the end of each section of the 
novel on events, interpretations, and the similarities and differences between 
then and now.) 
</P>
<P>
What matters about all this arty stuff is the way that seemingly unalterable 
remnants of other times take the shape of, as well as predicting the destinies 
and meaning of, the present. The old tales cross over into modern life, their 
original forms literally and figuratively fleshed out in contemporary ethics. 
As the characters work to aid or discourage the opera production, each comes to 
imitate a figure of Arthur's court. So when Gunilla hits it off with Hulda in 
the bath, Simon discovers himself as both Merlin and the Fool in the Tarot, 
Maria and Geraint get it on like Guinevere and Lancelot, and the kindly and 
lordly Arthur suffers through the mumps and cuckoldry to find himself a father, 
their fates seem both altered by and patterned after the art they adore. 
</P>
<P>
The key to Davies' ambitions is the ideal of alchemy: the transformation of 
dross to gold, of the discarded past to resplendent present, through the secret 
spells of the Gypsies, artists, and others who can realize the magic in the 
seemingly mundane (like the Alchemical Master painter, however disguised his 
identity and intentions). 
</P>
<P>
Such material conversion, however, is just what fails to occur in "The Lyre of 
Orpheus." Davies' comedy -- what he calls (referring to Rabelais) a "cleansing 
humor" -- is engaging, and successful in deriding the myopias of middle-class 
satisfaction. Davies maneuvers his plot with great skill, toys engagingly with 
ideas. But the novel doesn't so much make the surface over as make it charming. 
The book is undermined by the contradictions apparent in Davies' strategies: He 
writes about feeling, but not very feelingly; he honors the truths of the heart 
in the bemused voice of the mind. The wild carnival of life -- the sexuality 
that produces a child, the revelations in great poetry and music, the visionary 
possibilities of the Tarot -- is more alluded to than represented, a matter too 
much of hearsay and not enough of sensations of the world's base and venial 
fumblings. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike his earlier "Fifth Business," where soul and idea merged so 
successfully, Davies has not been able to liberate his prose here, and invest 
his story with the wisdoms of the body, the anarchic willfulness of the spirit, 
and the magnanimity of love that he celebrates.

<TEXT>
<P>
Home Fires Burning (CBS Sunday at 9 p.m.), a new "Hallmark Hall of Fame" 
presentation, depicts the impact of World War II upon a small Southern town. 
Barnard Hughes stars as the editor of the local paper who is the conscience of 
the community. 
</P>
<P>
She Knows Too Much (NBC Sunday at 9 p.m.), another new TV movie, tells of a 
federal agent working with a cat burglar who is the key to the solution of a 
high-level murder in Washington. Meredith Baxter Birney and Robert Urich star. 
</P>
<P>
Ghostbusters (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.) is the 1984 mega-hit comedy starring Bill 
Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis as three whimsical chaps in pursuit of 
things that go bump in the night; their leading lady is Sigourney Weaver. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, God! Book II (Channel 13 Monday at 8 p.m.) is not so much a sequel as an 
alternate version of George Burns trying to set his Earthly house in order with 
a little help from his friends. As before, the script does a clever tap dance 
around the pitfalls of blasphemy and sentimentality, but the novelty has worn 
off. Nonetheless, thanks to Burns, it's a cheerful enough family entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
In Blake Edwards' 1986 That's Life! (CBS Monday at 9 p.m.), one of the masters 
of movie comedy takes on some grim subjects: familial strife, decay and 
mortality -- and turns them into one of the funniest, most-life embracing films 
he has ever made. Edwards imagines a married couple in the throes of an almost 
unbearable weekend, one in which the husband (Jack Lemmon) is feeling sorry for 
himself with the advent of his 60th birthday while his wife (Julie Andrews) is, 
unknown to him, waiting out the results of a biopsy. 
</P>
<P>
Runaway Train (NBC Monday at 9 p.m.), Andrei Konchalovsky's lurid 1985 film 
based on Akira Kurosawa's nightmare tale of imprisonment, sadism, revenge and 
liberation, finds a dark train hurtling through a wintry wasteland with its 
brakes burned off and three passengers aboard: Jon Voight's escaped killer, his 
nervous, adoring pal Eric Roberts and a thin, pigtailed railway employee 
(Rebecca De Mornay). It may be existential, but it's also ultra-violent; too 
bad Kurosawa never got to do the film himself. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most famous movies of all time, Alfred Hitchcock's classic Psycho is 
back (on Channel 5 Tuesday at 8 p.m.), and its 1986 sequel Psycho III airs on 
Channel 5 Wednesday at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The 1983 Going Berserk (Channel 13 Tuesday at 8 p.m.) is episodic, graceless, 
often outrageous and sometimes crassly funny. John Candy stars as a nerdish 
part-time limousine driver and aspiring drummer whose fiancee (Alley Mills) is 
kidnaped by a religious aerobics cult leader (Richard Libertini) for his own 
crazed purposes. 
</P>
<P>
Dream Breakers (CBS Tuesday at 9 p.m.), a new TV movie, takes a look at 
corruption in big business through a Chicago building contractor (Robert 
Loggia) and his two very different sons, one eager to get ahead no matter what 
(D.W. Moffett), the other a dedicated priest (Kyle MacLachlan). 
</P>
<P>
Gene Wilder's 1986 Haunted Honeymoon (Channel 13 Wednesday at 8 p.m.) is an 
amusing, bouncy horror comedy that has fun not only with the old-dark-house 
genre but also those corny but beloved scare shows of the Golden Age of Radio. 
It may be slight but it does put a smile on your face and keep it there. In the 
film, it's 1939 and radio mystery stars Wilder and Gilda Radner are to be 
married in his great-aunt's Charles Addams-style estate. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1986 Poltergeist: The Other Side (Channel 5 Thursday at 8 p.m.) the 
Freeling family (JoBeth Williams, Craig T. Nelson, Heather O'Rourke and Oliver 
Robins) are suffering from something far worse than supernatural terrors: the 
Inevitable Sequel. They're put through pretty much the same scary paces but 
without the hardness or urgency of the original. 
</P>
<P>
Mellow, beautiful, rich and brimming with love, Woody Allen's 1986 Hannah and 
Her Sisters (Channel 13 Thursday at 8 p.m.) is perfection itself. It's Allen's 
best yet, revealing greater emotional complexity, more understanding of the 
foibles of others, and less edgy about his own. Smart, funny and touching, the 
film is set deep in the lives of a vibrant family whom we follow from 
Thanksgiving to Thanksgiving over a two-year period. At its heart are three 
sisters: the sustaining Mia Farrow, the stunning Barbara Hershey and the 
fragile, skittish Dianne Wiest. 
</P>
<P>
Directed by Billy Woodberry and written and photographed by Charles Burnett, 
the 1984 Bless Their Little Hearts (Channel 28 Friday at 11 p.m.) is a deeply 
compassionate yet unrelenting study of a black family man (Nate Hardman) caught 
up in a losing struggle to make ends meet. 
</P>
<P>
The Last Picture Show (Channel 28 Saturday at 10 p.m.) is the fine 1971 film by 
director Peter Bogdanovich about the lives of people in a small town in Texas 
during the 1950s and how they begin to change when the only movie theater in 
town prepares to close. Featured are compelling performances by Cloris 
Leachman, Ellen Burstyn and Ben Johnson.

JACK SMITH ON SUNDAY: ROAD WARS; 
</P>
<P>
REMEMBER WHEN NEW YORKERS MARVELED AT L.A. DRIVERS' COURTESY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
COSMOLOGISTS TELL us that life on our planet will someday be snuffed out either 
by fire or ice, with fire being the most likely. 
</P>
<P>
Neither prospect is more frightening than the end foreseen by Shirley Schieber 
of Corona del Mar: "The world will not end by fire or ice," she writes, "but by 
a giant traffic jam that stretches across the United States from California to 
New York and from Chicago to New Orleans and which will create a gridlock that 
backs up to the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, Canada and the Gulf of 
Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
One day, she foresees, the mass of vehicles will exceed the available 
thoroughfares, and all transportation will come to an end. This geometric 
profusion will escalate worldwide, the country with the most cars succumbing 
first, and so on down the line. 
</P>
<P>
It is true that our streets and freeways are becoming more crowded every day. 
The congestion seems much worse than it was a year ago. Working at home, I am 
not obliged to go forth on the freeways at rush hours. In past years, I 
sometimes felt as if I had the freeways all to myself. Now every hour is a rush 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
There is little gain in taking surface streets. They also seem to be getting 
more and more congested, and the drivers are becoming more reckless and 
arrogant. Today, when I get a green light, I routinely wait to make sure no one 
is going to squeeze through, at high speed, on the red. 
</P>
<P>
But when you fly across the country, looking down at Earth from 30,000 feet, 
you are reassured that the West, at least, is still a wilderness. Few cars can 
be seen even on the long highways. So the nation still has plenty of room; the 
trick is to get people to live in the desert. 
</P>
<P>
Before we subside into terminal gridlock, I suspect, we will begin to desert 
such metropolises as Los Angeles for the backwater towns that are still 
underpopulated. When we settled the West, we built cities on bare land. John 
Wayne or Henry Fonda would stand beside his girl on a rise and say, "Someday, 
Clementine, there's gonna be a city out there." 
</P>
<P>
Why does every immigrant to America have to gravitate to the big city? Probably 
because he seeks the warmth and support of his own kind, those who have already 
established a foothold here. Perhaps, if they were to go to smaller towns 
outside the metropolitan area, they would find more prejudice and less 
opportunity. But at least they wouldn't be contributing to the fatal gridlock, 
finally becoming enmeshed in it themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Fred A. Glienna of South Pasadena offers several ideas for 
ameliorating our traffic mess. He thinks we should have smaller and more 
maneuverable buses that would run more frequently. We should restore and use 
the hundreds of miles of railroad track that still crisscrosses our city. We 
should stagger our work hours. We should insist that drivers improve their 
skills and use courtesy and common sense. 
</P>
<P>
All of which, of course, is easier said than done. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the one proposal that I would most like to see achieved is an 
improvement in our driving skills, courtesy and common sense. 
</P>
<P>
In a society that confers the right to drive on every citizen over the age of 
15, there is no way to guarantee that every driver has skill, courtesy and 
common sense. 
</P>
<P>
But I remember when people from other parts of the country, especially New 
York, used to wonder at the courtesy of Los Angeles drivers. We did not run red 
lights. We did not block intersections after a light change. We did not run 
through crosswalks when pedestrians were in them. We didn't lean on our horns. 
</P>
<P>
That state of grace has vanished. The streets are an obstacle course. We are 
impatient, up-tight, selfish, arrogant. Gunfire is the ultimate symptom of our 
stress. Perhaps overpopulation is the cause. Perhaps the intensity of our 
computerized lives. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, let us pray that some genius comes along to invent us out of our 
quagmire. 
</P>
<P>
Before all of us find ourselves stalled from coast to coast in the ultimate 
traffic jam, I predict that we will discover a whole new means of 
transportation, as revolutionary as the automobile was in its day. 
</P>
<P>
It will come before the year 2001.

"The Dick Van Dyke Show" is currently airing on KDOC Channel 56, and I couldn't 
be happier. A special note of appreciation is due KDOC because the episodes are 
being shown without any editing for additional commercials.

What a sad commentary on our society that "Gary Collins' Hour Magazine" will be 
canceled because he isn't controversial enough. Collins' show was a breath of 
fresh air after Phil and Geraldo's sleaze. I don't see how they can top their 
barrel scrapings in 1989.

CRITIC'S NOTES: STILL IN LOVE WITH ROMANTIC MOVIES; 
</P>
<P>
FILM MAKERS ARE RE-IGNITING THOSE OLD FLAMES OF DESIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Want a quick X-ray of your deepest nature? Inventory what video cassettes you'd 
take for a snow-bound week in the country. My own list made me wince at the 
same time its transparency made me smile: "Notorious" and "Choose Me," "Letter 
From an Unknown Woman" and "Jules and Jim," the shameless selections of a 
card-carrying romantic. 
</P>
<P>
"Children of Paradise" and "McCabe and Mrs. Miller" should have been in there 
too. (Although maybe not the first; the thought of that final, tumultuous crowd 
sequence on a VCR is not a pretty thought.) 
</P>
<P>
It did get me thinking, though, about where our notions of what is or is not 
romantic are formed. Do they have to hit us, like Thomas Wolfe, before we're 
out of our teens? I very much doubt it. We probably need the romantic 
inclination -- but after that, all we need is the proper fuel and then it's 
never-ending: "Beauty and the Beast" gets us at one stage, "Brief Encounter" at 
the next, "Out of the Past" at another and "Days of Heaven" at another. 
</P>
<P>
What are the qualities that make a movie romantic? First you need characters of 
some substance. Not exceptional people, certainly not the high-born ones the 
Greeks required for classic tragedy; simply men or women with a distinct code, 
a clear set of values. 
</P>
<P>
Ordinary as they seemed, Trevor Howard and Celia Johnson's characters in "Brief 
Encounter" were as rooted in their sense of what was possible and what wasn't 
as any Greek oracle. It was her deeply ingrained sense of duty that kept Audrey 
Hepburn's sweet, funny princess and Gregory Peck's resourceful reporter apart 
in "Roman Holiday," not the differences in their stations. 
</P>
<P>
Next, you have to have powerful forces pulling your lovers apart: Romeo and 
Juliet's warring families; the bedrock differences in politics and values that 
tore apart Barbra Streisand and Robert Redford in "The Way We Were"; the 
encroaching Second World War in "Casablanca," combined with the fact that, in 
truth, the Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman characters weren't really right 
for each other. The basic man/woman difference in "Out of Africa": a sense of 
freedom at war with a sense of possessiveness that threatened Meryl Streep's 
Baroness Blixen and Robert Redford's Denys Finch Hatton. 
</P>
<P>
Our lover(s) must brave illogic, the social fabric of their day, fate and even 
life itself to be together. The entire Russian Revolution seemed to conspire 
against Lara and her Zhivago. And death seemed to stand between Dana Andrews' 
detective and Gene Tierney's enigmatic character in "Laura." 
</P>
<P>
So, does romance have to involve sacrifice and separation? Must we have Warren 
Beatty breathing his last in the snow of "McCabe and Mrs. Miller," while Julie 
Christie stares transfixed into the glaze of an opium bottle and the camera 
stares transfixed into the recesses of her sublimely beautiful eye? Or Jeanne 
Moreau's Catherine in "Jules and Jim," forthrightly driving Jim off a bridge to 
both their deaths, leaving (poor? lucky?) Jules behind . . . yet again? Or 
Laurence Olivier holding the dying Merle Oberon for one last look at Pennistone 
Crag in "Wuthering Heights"? 
</P>
<P>
Not necessarily. Writer-producer Charles Brackett once described the secret of 
his films, frequently made with Billy Wilder, as "making the audience want 
something very much . . . and then giving it to them." There doesn't seem to be 
any lasting sin in letting lovers live. "Notorious" is not one whit less 
stirring because Cary Grant gets Ingrid Bergman safely out from under the noses 
of those suspicious South American Nazis. The lovers of "A Man and a Woman" 
lived to face another day . . . and to make a lousy sequel. Humphrey Bogart and 
Katharine Hepburn didn't have to blow up into glorious splinters for "The 
African Queen" to be enduringly romantic. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the less explicit screen lovemaking is made, the more romance seems 
to flourish. We can smile now as the camera goes discreetly behind the 
fireplace flames in "Devil in the Flesh," but we didn't need to be there to 
feel what went on between Gerard Philipe's impassioned schoolboy and Micheline 
Presle's married woman. Vivien Leigh's smile on waking the next morning and 
Clark Gable's tender bravado as he carried her up the stairs the night before 
were quite enough in "Gone With the Wind." We didn't need loosened corset laces 
or groaning bedsprings. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't Look Now," which is a high-water mark in sensuality, isn't exactly 
romance: It's elegant lust, probably the most stirring I can ever remember on a 
screen. It's heightened by our knowledge that Julie Christie and Donald 
Sutherland are in love (married, no less), and its erotic intensity is fueled 
by the fact that it's an act of enormous caring, a bridge back, in fact, after 
the loss of a child, but it's erotic, not romantic. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, "Don't Look Now" is in its own class, distinctly apart from all those 
acres of exposed flesh, those gallons of sprayed-on sweat that seem to have 
engulfed us since the days of Brigitte Bardot and Barbarella. "The Unbearable 
Lightness of Being" is the closest fusion of the erotic and the romantic that 
we've had recently, although its married hero's compulsive philandering cuts 
right against the grain of real romanticism, which prefers the faithfulness of 
the turtledove. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
The late '30s and '40s, years when idealism was at its height, were the ideal 
breeding grounds for this sort of pure romance, but there seem to be little 
stirrings among '80s audiences that romance, not southern exposure, is closer 
to what they're looking for, after almost a decade of celebration of the status 
quo. 
</P>
<P>
The swooning success of "Wings of Desire" was one of the early warning signals; 
the sigh that I've heard as Arthur Clennam comprehends (at last!) that Amy 
Dorrit truly loves him in "Little Dorrit" is another. "Crossing Delancey" is 
made on an almost classic romantic mold and it worked rapturously well, and I 
think "Tequila Sunrise's" success with audiences comes from their yearning for 
the great romantic triangle again. (You might notice that the explicitness of 
its hot-tub love scene is muted enough for the romantics yet explosive enough 
for the sensualists.) So as baby boomers turn nesters and parents; as, one 
decade down, weddings are being celebrated with the sort of frothy fervor of 
the late 1940s, all the signs for a romantic revival seem to be upon us. And 
luckily enough, this swing comes at a time when the core of really romantic 
American directors seem to be flourishing, led by the greatest romantic of them 
all, Woody Allen. (We'll survive "Another Woman" -- there will be more and 
better coming, you can bet on it.) 
</P>
<P>
That impassioned group would include Alan Rudolph ("Choose Me," "Trouble in 
Mind"), Jim Jarmusch ("Stranger Than Paradise," "Down by Law"), Robert Towne 
("Personal Best," "Tequila Sunrise"), Philip Kaufman ("The Right Stuff," "The 
Unbearable Lightness of Being,") Sydney Pollack ("Tootsie," "Out of Africa"), 
Robert Benton ("Places in the Heart," "Nadine"), John Cassavetes (everything), 
and, on an intermittent basis, Robert Altman ("Fool for Love"). 
</P>
<P>
All of which means that when the impressionable youngsters of the '80s get 
misty-eyed, they may have a little more to pick from than "Risky Business" or 
"Flashdance."

DONNY'S COMEBACK BID: MR. CLEAN NO MORE; 
</P>
<P>
AFTER A DECADE-LONG SLUMP, OSMOND HAS A NEW DANCE ALBUM . . . AND A GRITTIER 
IMAGE TO GO WITH IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It's sometimes hard to believe that Donny Osmond was once on top of the music 
world, giving serious competition to fellow child prodigy Michael Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
Through 1978, when he last released a record in this country, Donny had 
accumulated 26 Top 40 singles -- compared to Michael's 23. Osmond's hits 
included records with his brothers ("One Bad Apple," "Yo-Yo"), duets with 
sister Marie ("I'm Leaving It All Up to You," "Morning Side of the Mountain") 
and solo works ("Puppy Love" and "Go Away Little Girl"). 
</P>
<P>
But Michael went on to become possibly the biggest pop star since Elvis. And 
Donny? 
</P>
<P>
Saddled with a cutesy and unhip image that was cemented by his tenure on the 
"Donny and Marie" TV variety show, Osmond, now 31, has been fighting for 10 
years to persuade the music industry that he is a serious artist. During that 
time, he recorded two albums that were never released. 
</P>
<P>
But Osmond hopes that the false starts are behind him. His dance-accented pop 
single "Soldier of Love" reached the Top 30 in England last summer, leading 
Virgin Records to release an album of aggressive dance tunes by Osmond there 
last month. According to the singer, who co-wrote five of the songs, some 
labels are considering picking it up for U.S. release. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not going to expect this kind of music from Donny Osmond," he said 
recently, relaxing between vocal sessions in a Hollywood recording studio. 
"Radio stations are gonna have fun with it. They're gonna say, 'I'm gonna play 
this for ya, and you try to guess who it is, 'cause you'll never believe it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Last week, that prediction came true. 
</P>
<P>
WPLJ-FM, the influential New York City station, began playing "Soldier of Love" 
without revealing who the artist was. According to music director Jessica 
Ettinger, the song was a Top 10 request every night (only three people guessed 
who it was), and when Osmond made an appearance on the air a week later for the 
revelation, said Ettinger, "the phone response was unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
Donald Clark Osmond broke into show business in 1962 at age 4 as a guest in his 
brothers' barbershop quartet act in Lake Tahoe. He later officially joined his 
brothers -- Alan, Wayne, Merrill and Jay -- in the group as regulars on Andy 
Williams' weekly variety TV show. After recording a series of flops for 
different labels, the Osmonds exploded on the music scene in 1971 with "One Bad 
Apple" under the guidance of Mike Curb, who had signed them to MGM Records. 
Donny's pairing with sister Marie as a recording duo in 1974 led to their 
successful TV show from 1976 through '78, followed by "The Osmond Family Show," 
which lasted just 10 weeks in 1979. Osmond, unhappy with the direction of the 
TV show, began looking for a way to break away from the simple pop tone of his 
'70s music in 1979 but couldn't find a record company that would give him the 
necessary freedom. 
</P>
<P>
He says the biggest blow came in 1982 with the patriotic Broadway musical, 
"Little Johnny Jones." Though Osmond was again playing an all-American boy, it 
was a bold attempt to build credibility in a new field. And he says he put his 
"heart and soul" into it. 
</P>
<P>
But the play was ravaged by the critics and closed on opening night. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's anything I'm more proud of, but more (demoralized) by, it's that 
play," he said. "The dancing . . . was absolutely top-notch and the singing was 
brilliant. We had to stop the show twice for standing ovations!" 
</P>
<P>
What irritated Osmond was critics who made jokes about his toothy smile. "They 
started talking about the image rather than the show," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The remarks hit so hard that Osmond grew a beard and withdrew from the 
spotlight for almost two years. Looking back, he says, "I was trying to hide, 
because it was really the first time I had failed at something." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, he pulled himself together for another try at re-establishing his 
career. "I shaved off my beard, and said, 'Come on, get off your duff.' " 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Osmond moved from Utah to Irvine with his wife, Debbie, and their 
three sons (now ages 3, 7 and 9). 
</P>
<P>
That year, he made progress in changing his image when he appeared as an 
out-of-work singer in Jeff Beck's "Ambitious" video. His line in the video, as 
he auditions for a lead-singer gig: "I've sung with my family, and I used to 
sing with a chick named Marie." 
</P>
<P>
After that, Osmond began showing up at Hollywood parties, posing for pictures 
with such unlikely companions as Boy George and Billy Idol. And, in March of 
1986, he surprised many by speaking out against the Parents Music Resource 
Center, which has called for warning labels on albums that might be unsuitable 
for youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole strategy was to let people know I'm a real individual -- a real 
human being," said Osmond. "And not some concocted fad, fly-by-night pretty 
face who was in the right place at the right time." 
</P>
<P>
Frank Rand, a talent executive at Epic Records at the time, was typical of 
industry insiders who didn't take the former teen star seriously. "I had that 
total, unequivocal image of him," he said. "And it scared the (hell) out of me 
-- the thought of his name connected with mine." 
</P>
<P>
But Rand became one of Osmond's biggest supporters. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing one person could have so much musical talent and not be able to 
(release records)," said Rand, who signed Osmond to Epic in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Gabriel, who met Osmond at a U.N. benefit concert in New York where both 
performed, also believed in Osmond and urged him to see producer George 
Acogney, who had arranged Gabriel's "Sledgehammer" hit. Osmond went to England 
to record with Acogney, but he was dropped from Epic -- by Rand's new superior 
-- before the project was finished. 
</P>
<P>
Simon Draper, head of Virgin Records in England, liked the tracks that Osmond 
had done with Acogney and signed Osmond, who completed the project with New 
York-based writer/producers Carl Sturken and Evan Rogers. One of their 
collaborations: the hit single "Soldier of Love." 
</P>
<P>
Despite all the pessimism that he's heard heard about his comeback effort, 
Osmond maintained a stubborn perseverance through it all. 
</P>
<P>
"I get a lot of that from my father," he said. "He had a very difficult life. . 
. . He came from a broken home. He lost his father when he was 3. He had to 
fight for everything he got. It certainly wasn't served to him on a silver 
platter. When I think of all the hardships he had to go through, it's an 
inspiration to me." 
</P>
<P>
Confident with his first new album in 10 years, Osmond says that having a big 
seller is not necessarily his main goal. And he's not deterred by the fact that 
his album has yet to make the British charts. "I always said it's going to take 
two or three albums. I just want it to regain some respect for Donny Osmond and 
the talent that he does have. This album will bring people up to date. 
</P>
<P>
"Virgin's treating me just right, and I want to find the same thing here." But 
he says he's not concerned about which label will pick up his album in the 
States. 
</P>
<P>
"They like my album, they can listen to it," he says. "But I'm not going out 
knocking on doors anymore. That's not my gig anymore, because I'm starting to 
realize that I'm just as good as anyone else out there."

A JERRY-BUILT TALE OF NEW YORK CITY; 
</P>
<P>
THE LOST WORLD ; 
</P>
<P>
EDWIN MCDOWELL (A THOMAS DUNNE BOOK/ST. MARTIN'S PRESS: $15.95; 217 PP.; 
0-312-02301-4)

By Miles Beller, Beller is television critic of the Hollywood Reporter, and a 
painter whose work most recently was featured in a group show at Schwartz 
Cierlak Gallery.

The City Novel, that infinite sprawling literary megalopolis built by Balzac, 
Dickens, Dostoevsky and Dreiser, and most recently annexed by Tom Wolfe's urban 
assault on the rotting boroughs of Nueva York in "The Bonfire of the Vanities," 
challenges and consumes the ablest writers. 
</P>
<P>
Though Edwin McDowell's New York City novel, "The Lost World," holds much 
promise at book's start, a complete measure of its contents reveals jerry-built 
fiction dominated by plasterboard characters, a show of N.Y.C. all surface and 
sheen, metropolis assembled by numbers, the city and its sons and daughters 
recast in the written equivalent of artist Red Grooms' style, only lacking 
Grooms' embracing humor and nimble insights. 
</P>
<P>
The "story" that McDowell, publishing correspondent of the New York Times, 
rests his metro tale on pertains to beat reporter Alex Shaw and his efforts to 
help find a lost boy. Shaw, a 46-year-old journalist who briefly served as 
drama critic for the Free Press but now covers the urban Bermuda Triangle 
called Times Square, connects with a black reverend from Tennessee. And as 
developed by McDowell, the reverend has traveled to the nexus of depravity and 
degradation, T. S., to find his missing grandson, Noah. Others acting out roles 
in this passionless play include a photographer of the streets, nicknamed Black 
Bart, as well as a female reporter in her late-20s whom Alex is seeing, and a 
savvy, street-wise kid nicknamed Dingo. Here, too, convenes a crew of oddballs, 
weirdos, Broadway cruisers, including a sapped prostitute with needle tracks 
and a strapping transvestite answering to Celeste. 
</P>
<P>
This collection of down-and-outers, though a tough bunch, assumes a saintly hue 
under McDowell's direction, by book's end reduced to the sort of miserables de 
la rue dwelling in the flattest of TV movies. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, such criticism is perhaps superfluous, since McDowell's lamentable 
low-lifes are summoned to give "The Lost World" texture and tone, much the same 
way tinted glass and curved concrete is used to suggest color and contour in 
symmetrically astringent high-rises. Thus McDowell's characters are to people 
as faux marble columns are to structural architecture. They are ciphers with 
insignias for souls and tiresome, false argot for thoughts. Indeed, unlike Tom 
Wolfe's New Yorkers (swaggering street punks, smug Wall Street stocks-and-bonds 
traders) whose words are unerringly true, McDowell's minions emit faint bleats 
devoid of life's sting. At one point, McDowell has Shaw launch into a "poetic" 
comparison between city trees surrounded by safe-keeping steel bars and the 
youngsters dwelling in Times Square. "Don't you see, it's a perfect metaphor. 
Here we are, in this relatively safe street, where saplings are well protected 
to give them a chance to grow to maturity. But less than five minutes away, 
hundreds of young kids, like those little girls who were jumping rope, have no 
protection . . . have almost no chance of flourishing." Off McDowell goes, 
proclaiming banalities as if he were Schliemann coming upon the gold of Troy. 
</P>
<P>
Yet every now and again, McDowell does convey a sharp sense of things. 
Describing the careful way the reverend chooses his words, McDowell tells us 
how the preacher was ". . . shunning contractions as if to do otherwise would 
be to debase the language." And to get across the haunted appearance of a lady 
of the streets, McDowell's Shaw incisively speaks of "a look the Mona Lisa 
might have had if it had been painted by Toulouse-Lautrec." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, when writing of subject matter he knows firsthand, McDowell often 
succeeds, as in his observations concerning the journalism trade and its 
practitioners' habits. Shaw, disclosing the way he reads the Free Press, wryly 
gives us the reporter's perspective on the capstone story in each day's account 
of events and personalities. "I settled back to finish the newspaper, reading 
it the way serious journalists do -- turning first not to stories about war, or 
Congress, or malfeasance, but to their own stories, seeing what page they are 
displayed on and at what length." 
</P>
<P>
Would that the rest of "The Lost World" were so keenly perceived, so knowingly 
rendered. 
</P>
<P>
Agreed, McDowell's take on New York is geographically narrower than Wolfe's 
massive reach. Still, he strives to construct in novel form, as did Wolfe, the 
indomitable forces of the city at work -- the public ramming into the private, 
the press, police, clergy and street populace rubbing each other raw. 
</P>
<P>
The problem in "The Lost World" is that McDowell's world is of the superficial 
and not the visceral, a town that topples like Leggo. His New York is a city of 
false observation and indolent reporting, a city fixed at the wrong locus, the 
wrong address. His is not the real place, not New York City, where the dark 
tide advances and the lost dream hovers like a spreading fever.

ENDPAPERS: JOURNALISM TEXAS STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LIZ CARPENTER, Journalist Carpenter is the author of Getting Better All the 
Time (Pocket Books). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dan Jenkins comes by journalism organically: "Part of it was going to movies 
where guys like Clark Gable wore a press pass in their hat." In downtown Ft. 
Worth, he attended Paschal High School, which also brought us writers Bud 
Shrake and Liz Smith, movie star Ginger Rogers, golfer Ben Hogan, Gov. Price 
Daniel and man-on-the-moon Alan Bean. Jenkins and his wife, June, just attended 
the 100th anniversary of the high school this Oct. 28. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't remember when I didn't want to be a writer. As an 8-year-old kid, I 
pulled an old typewriter out of the attic, put it on the kitchen table and 
started copying news stories out of the paper," he recalls. "Later, I started 
writing my own versions." 
</P>
<P>
It was in high school when he wrote a funny satire on a Ft. Worth Star-Telegram 
columnist for his school paper. The sports editor at the Ft. Worth Press, 
Blackie Sherrod, read it and hired Jenkins sight unseen "because he was gutsy 
and a satirist." That was 40 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Dan was the most confident writer I ever knew. Never re-wrote anything, had a 
sense of the ridiculous and the best ear for dialogue I ever read," Sherrod 
recalls. 
</P>
<P>
Thus began the reporting saga of Dan Jenkins, who spent 15 years as an ace 
sportswriter when little Davey O'Brien and Slingin' Sammy Baugh were making 
football history. 
</P>
<P>
Last November, Jenkins published his ninth novel,"Fast Copy" (Simon &amp; 
Schuster: $19.95), his resounding "yes" to the country and Western song, "Does 
Ft. Worth Ever Cross Your Mind?" Crossing Jenkins' mind is not only Ft. Worth 
but the 1930s, "when everything was better -- theater, football games, 
gangsters (of course), Presidents, summer nights, cafes, saloons -- everything 
but air conditioning." 
</P>
<P>
We were having breakfast to talk about the book, the rollicking saga of Betsy 
Throckmorton, a beautiful and feisty newswoman who returns to her hometown of 
Claybelle, Tex., with her Barnard College education, her Time magazine 
experience and her handsome, ever-loving husband. Once home with Daddy, the 
publisher of the Claybelle newspaper, Betsy discovers the hometown banker 
engaged in a get-rich murder scheme. It is Bonnie-and-Clyde time, with every 
banker in Texas scared silly of a hold-up. The Texas Bankers Assn. has littered 
the state with a brochure that reads: "Reward -- $5,000 for every dead 
bankrobber; not one cent for a living one." 
</P>
<P>
Into this story of blood and print and love, Jenkins weaves those 
thigh-slapping cornball descriptions that are so characteristic of his style. 
In "Fast Copy," he doesn't disguise his long romance with news reporting and 
"every ink-stained wretch who knows what it's like to wait for the deadline 
muse." 
</P>
<P>
Jenkins admits to rewriting, researching -- and suffering while writing this 
novel. "I hit the microfilm at the Star-Telegram for nine months when (wife) 
June was establishing Juanita's," a Mexican restaurant chain she owns in New 
York, Florida, and on Ft. Worth's Sundance Square, where you find the flavor of 
Cowtown restored by the Bass Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
Out of it came the headlines and news stories that verified his own memory of 
his favorite era: 
</P>
<P>
"I loved everything about the '30s," which he stretches from the Depression 
(1929) to Pearl Harbor (1941), "the Texas Rangers, Bonnie and Clyde, Al Capone, 
and the glittery Texas Centennial with Amon Carter's billboard invitation: 'Go 
to Dallas for culture; come to Ft. Worth for fun.' " 
</P>
<P>
"Ft. Worth is Texas; Dallas is Atlanta," Jenkins says. 
</P>
<P>
The flavor of Jenkins' prose, like Pace's picante sauce, stretches from 
Claybelle clear to New York City. A "Fast Copy" sampler: 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Texans never let facts interfere with their opinions." 
</P>
<P>
 -- " 'Waco?' Florine said, 'There's nothing in Waco but tornadoes and Baylor. 
If the Baptists don't get you, the funnels will.' " 
</P>
<P>
 -- " 'Why wouldn't she know what she's talking about?' Ben said. 'She's my 
daughter, isn't she? It's a genes deal.' " 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Betsy had spent more time in the newsroom than a moldy sandwich. . . . She 
had grown up on Southwest Conference football, but Ben would have suffered two 
strokes and a hemorrhage if she hadn't gone East to get the thick-book 
education he could well afford at Barnard College for Women." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Time editors: ". . . all dripping with Princeton ivy or speaking in quaint 
Harvard stammers." Time researchers: ". . . headed by a woman whose hair was 
worn in bangs, who wore bulky sweaters, Scottish plaid skirts, ballet shoes and 
could name all of the European capitals." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Ruth was a sob sister for the Daily News, a plump, gaudily dressed woman 
with frosty eyes and dyed-blond hair. Her ambition was to get off the 
tear-stained gossip sidebars about the mothers of dead cops and become a 
three-dot gossip columnist so she could eat free in good restaurants." 
</P>
<P>
During the '30s, Jenkins remembers, hobo towns in Texas were easy prey of 
small-town scams and bigots who would deliver DOA anybody who hadn't shaved, 
just to claim the reward offered by the Texas Bankers Assn. Jenkins based his 
story on a small-town newspaper editor who teamed up with Texas Ranger Frank 
Hammer to stop the human slaughter. 
</P>
<P>
"I work a lot on picking names for my characters, names that should be in 
Texas. The right name in a novel is important," he says. "Ft. Worth had two 
good guys who were rich, Amon Carter and Sid Richardson." 
</P>
<P>
Both appear in the person of his 55-year-old publisher of the Claybelle 
Times-Standard, Ben Throckmorton. The villain is named Lank Allred. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the charm of the book is print folklore, a Texanized version of "Front 
Page." It should be required reading at journalism schools, which are now all 
named Departments of Communications or Media Centers. There, the rollicking 
romance of the trade is lost. Journalism history should never fall into the 
cracks. No -- once there was a bar near every newspaper office where reporters 
gathered after deadlines, drank cheap whiskey and indulged in their favorite 
pastime: quoting leads and guessing whether it was from the by-line of Damon 
Runyon or H. L. Mencken or Herbert Bayard Swope. Matthew Arnold called it 
"literature in a hurry." But it was a time that produced newspaper copy so 
vivid and free-wheeling that readers were lured into the story, however trivial 
or world-shaking, and became part of the human comedy and tragedy going on 
around them. 
</P>
<P>
For his own part, Jenkins' favorite lead was written by St. John in the Bible: 
"Jesus wept." 
</P>
<P>
On second thought, he says, maybe it was Damon Runyon's lead on Al Capone's 
trial: "Al Capone was quietly dressed this morning, except for a hat of pearly 
white, emblematic, no doubt, of purity." 
</P>
<P>
 Jenkins, long acclaimed as the best sports writer Texas ever bred, may be 
more: He may be simply our best writer.

WELL-DRESSED HOST AND THE AMAZING WINNERS ON THE SMART SET'S FAVORITE GAME 
SHOW.

<P>
IT IS MID-MORNING on a tape day, and the atmosphere in the "Jeopardy!" 
contestant room at Hollywood Center Studios is dawn-before-battle tense. 
</P>
<P>
Susanne Thurber, the show's contestant coordinator, skillfully begins talking 
her 14 charges off the ledge. In soothing, maternal tones, she invites the 
prospective players, most of them middle-aged men in business suits, to have a 
muffin or a bagel. The would-be players make nervous jokes. "I hereby promise 
to name my first child Merv," one says with mock solemnity, alluding to 
"Jeopardy!" creator Merv Griffin, who developed the quiz in which players 
provide the questions, not the answers. 
</P>
<P>
The edgy chatter stops and the candidates are as still as jacklighted deer 
while Thurber advises them on how to behave if they are picked to appear on one 
of the five shows -- a week's worth -- that will be taped today. 
</P>
<P>
"No swearing if you can help it. We had a lovely lady the other day who kept 
saying 'Dammit.' We can bloop it out, but people are usually very good 
lip-readers." 
</P>
<P>
Thurber warns the contestants not to think of the dollar amounts they will 
accumulate during the game as money in the bank. "They're really points. They 
call them dollars, but the only person who is going to go home with any money 
is the person who wins." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the people in the contestant room are locals. But a few have come from 
as far away as Atlanta and Baltimore. The out-of-towners have invested their 
own money to fly here (though on rare occasions a local TV station foots the 
bill), and they will pay for their own motel rooms tonight if they are asked to 
return tomorrow. "Jeopardy!" offers would-be contestants no material 
inducements beyond the odd bagel and, of course, the chance to win money. As 
five-time winner Sandra Gore says: "I went on 'Jeopardy!' because I wanted to 
win cash. I didn't want to go home with a ceramic Dalmatian and parting gifts." 
</P>
<P>
Thurber guides the players-to-be through a stack of paper work that has evolved 
in response to the quiz-show scandals of the '50s and the litigiousness of the 
'80s. Candidates swear, among other things, that they are not related to or 
conspiring with anyone connected with the show. If they are members of the 
Screen Actors Guild or other acting guilds, they declare in writing that they 
aren't making more than $5,200 a year at it. They promise not to run for public 
office until after their shows, if any, have aired. They promise not to sue. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the people in this room will lose on "Jeopardy!" They don't realize 
that yet, but Thurber does. Part Mom, part psychiatric nurse, she gives their 
egos a preliminary boost. "We see 15,000 potential contestants a year, and only 
400 get to sit in this room. It's something you should all be proud of. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a game," Thurber says, trying once again to reduce the palpable anxiety 
in the room. "You should play it like a game and not as if it were a 
life-threatening thing. 
</P>
<P>
"Have a good time," she says as she leads her charges downstairs to the studio. 
</P>
<P>
IF GAME SHOWS were universities, "Jeopardy!" would be Harvard. As a video 
commodity, it is the second-most popu lar syndicated series in the country, 
trailing, but gaining on, Griffin's other wildly successful game show, "Wheel 
of Fortune." An estimated 25 million viewers tune in nightly, their numbers 
peaking during the show's annual two-week Teen Tournament, which will air in 
Los Angeles starting tomorrow at 7:30 p.m. on Channel 13. The annual Tournament 
of Champions, during which the year's top money winners compete for $100,000, 
and the Seniors Tournament, for players over 50, also draw big audiences. 
</P>
<P>
As a cultural phenomenon, "Jeopardy!" stands alone. Since the demise of 
"General Electric College Bowl" in 1970, it is the only game show that a person 
with a Phi Beta Kappa key can appear on without a detailed explanation to his 
or her friends. In a nation that mistrusts its grinds and eggheads, it is the 
sole public forum for Americans who can do the intellectual equivalent of a 
slam-dunk. 
</P>
<P>
"Jeopardy!" draws a diverse set of fans. Billy Crystal, Laker forward James 
Worthy, Frank Sinatra and Madonna tune in, along with virtually everyone who 
ever bragged about his or her SAT scores. The original "Jeopardy!" -- hosted by 
Art Fleming, aided by the mellifluous Don Pardo -- ran from 1963 to 1975 and 
was briefly revived in 1978-79. The new "Jeopardy!" premiered in 1984 with 
debonair French-Canadian Alex Trebek as host. 
</P>
<P>
In the current game, three contestants vie to win cash by answering questions 
on subjects ranging from World Geography to Famous Fish. In the first round, 
called Jeopardy, the players are presented with 30 clues in six categories. 
Each clue is worth $100 to $500. The players press high-tech buzzers to 
indicate that they are ready to respond to clues revealed on an enormous 
electronic game board. The first person to buzz may answer, framing his or her 
response in the form of a question. A sample clue and response, in the category 
Four-Letter Words: You can do it to a curfew or a ballerina / What is lift? 
Correct responses add dollars to the player's total, wrong responses reduce it. 
</P>
<P>
In the second round, Double Jeopardy, the 30 clues are somewhat harder and are 
worth more, $200 to $1,000. Both rounds include hidden Daily Doubles, which 
afford players the opportunity to increase their winnings by betting some or 
all of their money on the likelihood that they will answer one clue correctly. 
To win, contestants must wager shrewdly as well as recall facts. "That's why 
it's called 'Jeopardy!' not 'Questions &amp; Answers,' " says David Shear, a 
three-time winner. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the players face Final Jeopardy. They are told the last category, The 
Civil War, say, or Fruits and Vegetables. They then wager all, part or none of 
their winnings on their ability to get the last question right. Occasionally, a 
contestant who is out in front will bungle his or her bet and lose by a single 
miscalculated dollar, giving new meaning to the phrase the agony of defeat. The 
player who ends up with the most money wins -- an average of $10,000 a game -- 
and may appear as often as five times if undefeated. The others go home with 
"parting gifts" and the knowledge that they have lost in front of millions of 
people, including Madonna and Mom. Worst of all, the shows are rerun from time 
to time. As Shear says, "It gets on my nerves. I keep losing." 
</P>
<P>
AT A "Jeopardy!" contestant search in Hollywood, 90 hopefuls showed up on a 
recent Tuesday morning. Three obstacles stood between them and an appearance on 
"Jeopardy!": a written quiz, a practice game and a personal interview. The 
written test consists of 50 questions and is revised every three months. Each 
question is shown on a television monitor while Alex Trebek's voice is heard 
reading it aloud. What building, applicants might be asked, appears on the back 
of an American $20 bill? What's the name of the small blue creatures that star 
on a Saturday morning TV program? They have 10 seconds to respond, and answers 
don't have to be phrased in the form of questions. According to a "Jeopardy!" 
press kit, 70% -- or 35 right -- is a passing grade. A show spokesman says the 
test knocks out 80% of all comers. Today, 14 are left standing. 
</P>
<P>
After the unsuccessful test-takers leave, the survivors play a mock "Jeopardy!" 
game in the empty studio, hitting hotel desk bells instead of buzzers. 
Suddenly, the name of the game has changed from Being Smart to Being Fast, 
Personable and Smart. 
</P>
<P>
"Our show is not the one where you have to dress like ducks or chickens, or 
spin a wheel like some show we know, but we are looking for people with high 
energy," counsels staffer Glenn Kagan, who stands in for Trebek during the 
practice games. "This is no time to be quiet, shy and retiring," Thurber urges. 
"Play as if you were going to get the big bucks today." As they play the game, 
several of the plainer prospects blossom in the simulated spotlight, beating 
their opponents to the bell and answering authoritatively in question form. A 
few others seem to have trouble ringing and thinking at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the practice games, half of those who passed the written test are 
dismissed. Thurber is especially gentle with this group, who have had their 
expectations raised, then dashed. "Come back and try again after three months," 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
The seven victors in the gamesmanship phase of the competition are asked to 
stand and give short speeches about themselves. Attorneys, teachers, actors and 
other people who speak regularly in public are at a distinct advantage. New 
Yorker Bob Verini, a 37-year-old actor /director who won the 1987 Tournament of 
Champions, recalls: "I was able to play the kind of person I thought they were 
looking for. I tried to be upbeat, articulate but not stuffy, pleasant and kind 
of jokey but not a wise guy." 
</P>
<P>
Less than two hours after they arrived, the seven finalists leave the studio 
with vague assurances that "Jeopardy!" may call them in the future. They are 
all smiling. 
</P>
<P>
AT 48, ALEX Trebek, the salt-and-pepper-haired host of "Jeopardy!" could be an 
unusually handsome professor of, say, philosophy, which was his major at the 
University of Ottawa. Elegantly dressed by Mr. Guy of Beverly Hills, Trebek 
adds a well-read-man-in-his-library presence to the throbbing electronic 
"Jeopardy!" set. And Trebek is more than just another pretty suit. He once took 
a version of the show's written test and scored a respectable 43 -- 86%. 
</P>
<P>
Trebek has been a quizmaster in the United States since 1973, when friend and 
fellow Canadian Alan Thicke recommended him as host for the short-lived "The 
Wizard of Odds." Trebek had spent the previous 12 years with the Canadian 
Broadcasting Corp., doing news and special events in both English and French 
(his Canadian shows included a series devoted to figure-skating). As host of 
both "Jeopardy!" and "Classic Concentration," which he also produces, Trebek is 
said to make almost $1 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
Every day that programs are taped -- there are 46 such sessions a season -- 
Trebek studies all the questions and answers that might appear on the five 
shows to be produced that day. He reads the material for accuracy and nuance 
and verifies pronunciations -- occasionally, he needs to perfect the spin on a 
word like ichthyophagous. 
</P>
<P>
During breaks in the taping, he fields questions from the "Jeopardy!" studio 
audience. Women want to know his marital status. No, he is not married now. A 
six-year previous marriage produced no children, although he has an adult 
stepdaughter named Nicky who works as a runner on the show. He lives, with his 
mother, in a house in the Hollywood Hills that he helped design and build. And, 
no, he does not alphabetize his herbs and spices, as one magazine reported, 
although he does hang his light-colored clothes on light hangers and his dark 
clothes on dark ones. 
</P>
<P>
Trebek is easy with his audience. "At birth," he tells a recent group, 
"Canadian babies are taught to say eh at the end of every sentence." But when 
the cameras roll, he is all business ("Let's go to work," he urges players), 
except for the occasional, often self-deprecating quip. 
</P>
<P>
It has to be that way, Trebek says. "On 'Classic Concentration,' you can kid 
around and use up 5 or 10 or 15 seconds, and you are not materially impeding 
the progress of a player toward the solution of a puzzle. Whereas, on 
'Jeopardy!' we're trying to cover 61 clues, and we've got to move it. And there 
are three contestants. If one has $2,000, another one has $2,000 and the third 
one has $100, and I decide I'm going to waste 15 seconds by telling a joke, the 
one who has $100 is gonna say, 'Wait a minute, wait a minute. Butt out, Trebek. 
I want to earn some money to catch up with these others.' So I can't do that. 
You've got to be serious, and you've got be very fair." 
</P>
<P>
Trebek is modest about his role. "The stars of the show are the players -- not 
the host -- and the material. 
</P>
<P>
"JEOPARDY!"gobbles up information. With 61 questions and answers per show, 
hundreds of fresh facts are needed each week to test the mettle of the players 
in the studio and millions who play along at home. The man who feeds the fact 
monster is the show's editorial associate producer, Harry Eisenberg. 
</P>
<P>
Eisenberg, a soft-spoken native of Brooklyn who says he sometimes writes 
"Jeopardy!" clues in his dreams, supervises a research staff of 13. Five days a 
week, staff members are expected to produce a daily quota of three categories 
with six clues and answers (five will appear on the show, one is a backup). 
Although any staffer can create a category, the work tends to be divided, with 
five developing most of the categories and the others doing the requisite 
research and proofreading. 
</P>
<P>
"They are free to write anything they want, but they've got to keep the bases 
covered," Eisenberg says of his staff. The bases, he explains, are five broad 
areas: academic subjects, life style (including religion, fashion and food), 
pop culture, wordplay and people. 
</P>
<P>
Although the staff denies playing favorites and keeps no-no lists of well-worn 
categories, many observers are convinced that there are certain pet subjects 
that frequently pop up on "Jeopardy!" "They love royalty!" says veteran player 
Shear, a 40-year-old former journalist from West Los Angeles, who won $24,402 
on the show in 1986. "Whenever you see Royalty, you know it's bad news. You 
know you're going to put the wrong number after the king or queen. They love 
the Nobel Prize! They love the Caspian Sea! They love Leadville, Colo., 'the 
highest city in the United States!' " 
</P>
<P>
Other former contestants add landlocked nations and Alexander the Great to the 
catalogue of recurring motifs. 
</P>
<P>
Eisenberg, who has been with the show almost five years, has a practiced sense 
of what makes for good "Jeopardy!" material. He once taught American history at 
a community college in Maryland (he also sold photocopiers), and he says 
preparing material for the show is similar to making up a good test. A clue is 
never used on "Jeopardy!" with the hope that no one will get the answer, he 
says. But, he adds, "you want to reach the point where you can separate the men 
from the boys, the women from the girls. Ideally, only one contestant out of 
three knows the answer." 
</P>
<P>
Questions are pretested, "round-tabled," by a group of at least five staff 
members. The staff tries to make sure that each question is "pinned," its term 
for a clue that elicits a single, unambiguous response. Material is also tested 
for obscurity. Eisenberg doesn't mind hard, but he doesn't like esoteric. "If 
nobody knows an answer except the writer, we throw the question out." 
</P>
<P>
Although "Jeopardy!" categories are summed up in a word or two and the 
"answers" posed to the players are never longer than seven short lines, they 
are a major factor in the pleasurable buzz that fans get from the show. Like 
successful sonneteers and good headline writers, "Jeopardy!" staffers exercise 
their creativity within the constraints of an odd little form. Eisenberg 
affectionately cites such classic categories as Kings Named Ed and Famous Pigs. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the show's researchers has areas of special interest and expertise, as 
well as a basic enthusiasm for pop culture. Kathy Easterling comes up with much 
of the material dealing with Shakespeare, royalty, actors and their roles, 
dance and celebrity weddings. Perhaps her finest hour was Those Darn Etruscans, 
a category she created for the third "Jeopardy!" Tournament of Champions in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
One of her questions had the distinction of tripping up the legendary Charles 
(Chuck) Forrest, generally acknowledged to be the Alexander the Great of 
"Jeopardy!" players. Forrest, then a baby-faced law student of 25, won five 
daily games in 1986. He took his $72,800 and moved on to the tournament. During 
that competition, he handily beat his opponents to the buzzer to respond to the 
Easterling clue: " 'Fufluns' was the Etruscan counterpart of this Greco-Roman 
god of grape-guzzling." "Who," responded Forrest, "was Dionysius?" Later, even 
his mother said Chuck should have known better -- the name was Dionysus. 
(Forrest won the tournament anyway, adding $100,000 -- the tournament limit -- 
to his winnings.) 
</P>
<P>
Easterling says she, and most of her colleagues, are fact junkies. "I'm always 
tearing pages out of magazines or marking them up with red pen." She keeps a 
notebook near her TV at home to record after-hours inspirations. Occasionally, 
what looks great in the notebook misses the mark on the screen. Easterling once 
fashioned a category, Heads, around the macabre fact that Sir Walter Raleigh's 
widow carried the decapitated knight's head around in a velvet bag. 
Easterling's clue was: "It's said this man's wife would pull his head out of a 
bag and ask, 'Have you met Sir Walter?' " When the clue appeared on the show, 
the contestants were silent. "All they had to come up with was his last name, 
but they were so stunned they couldn't answer," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Accuracy is a point of honor with the "Jeopardy!" staff. Proofreading of clues 
goes on even during taping, when the research staff keeps a close eye on the 
game board. Although one show featured the category Oops, acknowledging and 
correcting errors that had slipped onto the show, mistakes are rare. "When we 
do make mistakes, usually our sources are wrong," Eisenberg says. Such was the 
case when the staff identified the University of Mexico as the oldest 
university in the Western Hemisphere. Viewers were quick to point out that the 
University of Santo Domingo, founded in 1538, is more than a decade older. "We 
now have questions double-sourced," Eisenberg says. 
</P>
<P>
The best way to check the accuracy of "Jeopardy!" material is to go right to 
the source. Staffer Steve Dorfman once called Buffalo Bob to learn if it was 
true that Howdy Doody had 48 freckles, one for each of the 48 states then in 
the union; it was. Another staffer, Suzanne Stone, asked the wife of Albert 
Sabin to confirm that he had tested his oral polio vaccine on himself and his 
family before general testing was done. That, too, was true. 
</P>
<P>
Just as "Jeopardy!" material is vetted for fairness and accuracy, it is also 
expected to be in good taste. Easterling recalls that a category was once 
changed from Hell to the less offensive Heaven and Hell. On rare occasions, 
material is deemed tasteless and nixed. Researcher Frederik Pohl IV recalls an 
instance involving the answer: "Rocky Mountain goat, sheep, oyster -- the one 
that comes from the other two." Producer George Vosburgh ruled "No way." 
</P>
<P>
ANYBODY WHO ever sat in his recliner shouting answers at the video image of 
Alex Trebek thinks he was born to win on "Jeopardy!" Once the couch cognoscenti 
make it onto a show, however, the vast majority discover the simple truth of 
former contestant Shear's observation: "It's a lot easier to play the game at 
home than in the studio." 
</P>
<P>
There's the buzzer, for one thing. Operating the real thing on the set is 
something contestants get to do for the first time during a brief tape-day 
rehearsal. Learning how to work it is a major stumbling block for some. 
Contestants are not supposed to buzz in, signaling their readiness to answer, 
until Trebek finishes reading the last syllable of the question. At that 
moment, a neon tube that runs around the game board lights up, letting 
contestants know they are free to buzz. If they press before the light goes on, 
their buzzers are automatically incapacitated for two-tenths of a second. As 
Susanne Thurber tells contestants-to-be, "That's not long, but it's long enough 
for someone else to ring in or for your entire life to flash before you." (The 
pens with which the contestants write their answers in Final Jeopardy also shut 
off automatically after the 30-second time limit.) 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Forrest's finesse with the buzzer, said to have been honed on video 
games, awed even the "Jeopardy!" staff. A contestant who lost big and wrote 
about it later described just how crucial getting the right rhythm can be: "The 
beeper! The dreaded beeper! Of the first eight or 10 questions that flashed 
before my eyes, I knew about five or six answers. But not once, not once, was I 
able to buzz at the right time. It was like intellectual drag-racing, but not 
knowing when to gun the engine." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the players who have entered the pantheon of big winners say they spent 
weeks, even months, preparing for their shot. In 1988, Sandra Gore was the 
first woman to make the finals of a Tournament of Champions (women have 
traditionally done better in the Seniors Tournament). Gore, a 36-year-old New 
Yorker, began training for the tournament after she won $53,507 on five shows 
and retired undefeated. Some players stop drinking or start running before 
tournaments. Gore worked on building her stamina. She knew she might play five 
games in one day, a real test of how well a player can budget his or her 
energy. So she taped "Jeopardy!" shows from her TV each evening, then played 
along, five games at a time. "I watched it standing up," she says. She 
practiced buzzing in by pressing on a container of dental floss. 
</P>
<P>
Contestants have gone on the show with talismans ranging from a good-luck 
fingernail paring to a can of sardines. In case luck was what she needed, Gore 
tucked a crystal charm into her purse. She also wore comfortable, flat shoes as 
part of her strategy, and finished third in the tournament, adding $13,000 to 
her previous winnings. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Lowenthal, the 40-year-old State Department official who won the 1988 
tournament, crammed for his appearances. As a safeguard against cheating, 
neither "Jeopardy!" players nor staff know what categories are going to come up 
-- they are chosen the morning of taping by staff of the Department of 
Broadcast Standards at ABC, which provides the service to the syndicated show. 
So Lowenthal took a shotgun approach. He filled a little notebook with facts 
and bought reference books and underlined them. He learned everything he could 
about the presidents, the 50 states, world geography, the Academy Awards, 
sports (the category he dreaded), classical music, popular music and TV 
(another of his scholarly weaknesses). For good measure, he memorized the 
periodic table of elements, the bones of the human body and the site of every 
Olympics since 1896. 
</P>
<P>
He also taped shows and played along, not standing up like Gore but often lying 
in bed. He practiced with a makeshift buzzer not so much to improve his rhythm 
as to teach himself not to ring in unless he knew an answer or could 
confidently guess cor rectly. Home players constantly guess impulsively, but, 
as Lowenthal notes, "wrong answers are not cost-free on the show." 
</P>
<P>
In the weeks before the tournament, he was visited in the flesh by Forrest, who 
had graduated from the University of Michigan after his "Jeopardy!" triumph and 
joined the State Department. A mutual friend there arranged a meeting between 
the two. Forrest, who recently went to the U.S. Embassy in Saudi Arabia as a 
political officer, told Lowenthal that he had studied the show and calculated 
that sports turned up only 5% of the time. Lowenthal sighed gratefully. 
</P>
<P>
Lowenthal, who has a Ph.D. in history from Harvard, says he believes that his 
six weeks or so of preparation were well worth it. "What all the studying did 
was to give me a greater sense of confidence. It struck me as a worthwhile 
investment of time, given the potential payoff." Lowenthal won a total of 
$149,901 on the show. 
</P>
<P>
Most people who win on "Jeopardy!" are happy, for a time. It's fun to win money 
on TV, in front of viewer Frank Sinatra, for an activity that does not require 
heavy lifting. Still, while big winners are embarrassed to say so, many feel 
that $20,000 or $50,000 or $100,000 is nice, but, as one put it, "it's not 
winning the lottery." They are not fixed for life. They might put a "Jeopardy!" 
windfall down on a house (one winner called his Casa "Jeopardy!"). It can pay 
some of a child's college bills or allow a winner to treat himself to things he 
might not otherwise buy. Lowenthal says the only thing he's bought so far is a 
rather expensive kaleidoscope that he found at a craft fair. "That's about as 
frivolous as I get," he says. "I'm not a high frivol." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Verini, who works part time at a Stanley H. Kaplan Educational Center in 
New York City, took the $46,802 he won as an undefeated "Jeopardy!" champion in 
1987 and founded the Manticore Theater, a theater company that produces new 
plays and neglected classics. "The money allowed me to take my destiny in my 
hands," he says. Carlo Panno's life was also changed by "Jeopardy!" Panno was 
on the resurrected Art Fleming version of "Jeopardy!" in 1978, winning $6,850 
in one show, which was briefly a record. More important, he met Deborah Dean in 
the contestant pool. They are married, and Panno now works for "Jeopardy!" as a 
researcher. 
</P>
<P>
Strangers come up and tell "Jeopardy!" winners how smart they are. Lowenthal 
was recognized recently by another passenger on a small boat during a vacation 
in the Coral Sea. 
</P>
<P>
The losers are left with little but their "Jeopardy!" home games and other 
consolation prizes. Sometimes they cry; they always remember what they got 
wrong. Gore still finds it hard to believe that she couldn't recall Jimmy 
Carter when asked in the final Final Jeopardy the names of three of the four 
20th-Century presidents who ran for the office and lost (the others were Taft, 
Hoover and Ford). Losing on "Jeopardy!" probably isn't as bad as satirist 
"Weird Al" Yankovic depicts it in a song that features the voice of Don Pardo 
intoning: "That's right, Al, you lost. . . . But that's not all. You also made 
yourself look like a jerk in front of millions of people and brought shame and 
disgrace on your family name for generations to come." 
</P>
<P>
Thurber treats the losers compassionately, always making it a point to thank 
contestants who have lost before they slip out of the studio. In David Shear's 
view, "A psychologist could make a fortune counseling game-show contestants who 
have lost." 
</P>
<P>
"You have to keep it in perspective," Lowenthal says, unwittingly quoting 
Thurber and the "Jeopardy!" credo. 
</P>
<P>
"It's only a game." 
</P>
<P>
BACK IN THE studio on tape day, the games are about to begin. The contestants 
have played their practice games and are as ready as they will ever be. The 
lights on the game board flash, and the familiar music begins to swell. Thurber 
has chosen the players who will go on first. John Lauderdale, "Jeopardy!" stage 
manager, shows the three contestants -- one returning champion and two 
challengers -- where to wait off-camera for their cues. Lauderdale has put a 
wooden booster box behind the podium of the shortest player. In the wings, Alex 
Trebek smoothes his gray suit jacket and adjusts his maroon tie. Suddenly 
Johnny Gilbert cries, "This is 'JEOPARDY!'. . . "

Shirley MacLaine will be able to tap her enthusiasm for spiritualism --

Written and directed by Welshman Chris Monger, the story's about a mom, two 
pre-teen kids and great-aunt MacLaine, who move to a small Midwest town in 1962 
to run a diner and lead a quiet life. When they move in next door to the 
meanest man in town, the kids decide to scare him to death with the help of 
aunty -- a former carny who dabbled in phony spiritualism. She concocts a 
dazzling illusion, convincing the man he's had a "visitation" and turning the 
town into a latter-day Lourdes.

<P>
"Knot's Landing" is getting rid of Jill Bennett -- Kevin Dobson's pathological 
legal assistant, played by Teri Austin -- but will it be murder or suicide? 
</P>
<P>
That's the question that will tease viewers next month when Jill's body is 
found in former lover Gary Ewing's (Ted Shakelford) car after she "does a 
'fatal attraction' on Gary," according to a producer. 
</P>
<P>
"They've already shot my death scene but they're shooting flashbacks of the 
incident," which will be used in episodes through the end of this season, 
Austin told us. "Lorimar is so cheap, I just can't die and leave, they're 
keeping me around for a while." 
</P>
<P>
Neither the actress nor the producers would discuss why her contract would not 
be renewed after this, her fourth, season.

Jill Bennett's death, to be promoted as a whodunit, could be a murder-setup 
covering a suicide, Austin hinted.

An iconoclastic director like David Lynch -- of "Eraserhead," and "Blue Velvet" 
fame -- working in network TV? Come on! 
</P>
<P>
But sources tell us that Lynch will start a pilot movie for a mystery-thriller 
series, "Northwest Passage," in Seattle, come March, for ABC. Kyle MacLachlin 
stars as an FBI agent investigating the murder of a high school homecoming 
queen. Also cast: Isabella Rossellini and Harry Dean Stanton. 
</P>
<P>
The movie was written by Lynch and Mark Forest and is set in a small Peyton 
Place-type community populated by unusual characters -- such as a deputy 
sheriff who breaks into tears whenever he's faced with an emotional situation. 
</P>
<P>
According to a source close to the production, "Melodrama is too tame a word to 
describe the emotional tone. Every aspect of story and style have been 
heightened."

ADVERTISING executives project that American women are heading into a period of 
"neo-traditionalism," a return to time-honored attitudes, values and styles. 
The trend is giving rise to hairdos that are classic, feminine and 
non-threatening, looks reminiscent of the pre-women's-movement '50s and '60s. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most evocative do is the flip. Yes, the sugar-sweet style with 
turned-up ends is back. The original, usually featuring a back-combed crown, 
clip-on bows and lots of spray, was worn by Sandra Dee in "Gidget," Doris Day 
and Jacqueline Kennedy. The 1989 version is softer, more tailored and worn 
closer to the head than its pouffed predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
Both flips developed because women and their stylists were bored. Thirty years 
ago, women were tired of the rounded, teased bubble. So savvy hairdressers like 
Manhattan's Kenneth, who designed Kennedy's style, urged their clients to let 
their hair grow past chin length so that the ends could be flipped, creating a 
style that was slightly elongated, yet full at the crown, sides and back. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the smooth, turned-under bob -- or "power cut," as it has come to be 
known -- looks tired. Once again, stylists are asking their clients to gain a 
bit of length and to experiment with upturned ends. 
</P>
<P>
But few hairdressers are pulling out rollers and clips for the new version. 
Instead, it is created with a precise cut and a blow dryer. As Alex Doyle of 
the Doyle Wilson salon on Melrose Avenue explains: "A graduated edge -- rather 
than a straight blunt cut -- allows the hair to flip. Then, by holding the 
dryer underneath the ends, the hair naturally turns up." 
</P>
<P>
Hair stylist Blase, who flips hair at the Char Salon in Beverly Hills, 
acknowledges that for some women a flat crown isn't flattering, but he still 
discourages back-combing. Blase cuts height into the style by creating tufts at 
the crown. He finishes the look with eyebrow-length bangs. 
</P>
<P>
The flip started showing up in fashion magazines last month. Susan Dey of "L.A. 
Law" flipped the ends of her bob when she appeared on "Late Night With David 
Letterman" recently, and Candice Bergen was spotted in Beverly Hills with 
turned-up ends. Marilyn Quayle, wife of Vice President Dan Quayle, also wears a 
flip, but she has been criticized for sporting an outdated version. Instead of 
being flat and gently bent upwards, hers is pouffed, reminiscent of the old 
Kennedy style. 
</P>
<P>
Doyle, who created the flip shown in Redken International's latest national ad, 
says that the style is particularly important now because it creates a 
triangular line, a shape that is reflected in spring fashion silhouettes. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very American trend," adds Blase, who represented Redken at a recent 
international hair-styling competition in Dusseldorf, Germany. "European movie 
stars like Gina Lollobrigida and Brigitte Bardot copied Jackie Kennedy's look 
and turned it into an international trend. Now it's new again, but the first 
baby boomers can take out their old high school snapshots and see how they 
looked in bubble-style flips."

appropriate for the executive woman. Most of these women have been wearing 
their hair slick and under for more than a year. It's time for a change."

ORIGAMI

ANYONE WHO HAS ever folded a piece of paper into an airplane knows the pleasure 
of origami: transforming a flat, thin piece of paper into a three-dimensional 
form. 
</P>
<P>
Scholars believe that origami may have originated in China, where paper was 
invented, but the best-known practitioners today are in Japan; using special 
origami papers (white on one side, colored on the other), origami experts can 
make whales (complete with water spouting out the top), dinosaurs, flowers, 
mother duck and ducklings, rabbits, boxes -- anything. The shapes are used to 
decorate gifts for birthdays, weddings, anniversaries and New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
In America, origami's popularity is often limited to elementary school projects 
for children and elaborate napkin folding for adults. These napery contortions 
have been popular since the 16th and 17th centuries, when Europeans who could 
afford it gave huge banquets distinguished by endless, elaborate food and not 
quite endless, but no less complicated, napkins. Pope Gregory XIII held one 
such bash that had a folded-napkin centerpiece in the shape of a castle. 
</P>
<P>
One of origami's most appealing aspects is its simplicity: no tools, no glue, 
no time-consuming finishing. It's just paper and person; a diligent beginner 
with a stack of paper can easily work from books. "The Art of Origami," by 
Samuel Randlett, and "Origami," by Hideaki Sakata are recommended. 
</P>
<P>
 Classes are occasionally offered at Joslyn Center of the Arts in Torrance, 
Point Vicente Interpretive Center in Rancho Palos Verdes and Cabrillo Marine 
Museum in San Pedro. Quick &amp; Easy Origami, a kit with paper and 
instructions, is available at Waldenbooks, B. Dalton and at the gift shop of 
the Japanese Pavilion at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Supplies and 
books are sold also at Kinokuniya Book Store, Bunka-Do Store and Amerasia 
Bookstore, all in Little Tokyo, downtown Los Angeles.

DISNEY AND DALI'S 'DESTINO': A TALE OF TWO VISIONARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JORDAN R. YOUNG, Young is an author whose most recent book is Let Me 
Entertain You, a collection of show business profiles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Of all the strange liaisons produced by Hollywood, the coupling of Salvador 
Dali and Walt Disney was perhaps the strangest. While the brainchild of that 
union was never given the green light, it refuses to die; every two or three 
years, the project is retrieved from oblivion and revived as a possibility. 
</P>
<P>
To Disney, "Destino" was "just a simple love story -- boy meets girl." But to 
Dali -- who died last week at 84 -- it was "a magical exposition on the problem 
of life in the labyrinth of time," in which limp watches fell from heaven, 
monstrous telephones sprouted legs, sculptures sprang to life and a trickle of 
ants became a swarm of bicycle riders. 
</P>
<P>
The project was initiated in 1946 when Disney -- who owned the rights to a 
Mexican love ballad by the same title -- commissioned the famed surrealist 
painter to do a story treatment based on his interpretation of the song. 
Planned as a combination of animation, live action and special effects, the end 
product was to have been one segment (about six minutes long) of a "package" 
film along the lines of "The Three Caballeros" or "Make Mine Music," combining 
disparate elements. 
</P>
<P>
Dali was not the first one assigned to "Destino"; a series of drawings in the 
familiar Disney style were scrapped before he was hired. "The name of the song 
probably appealed more to Salvador Dali than the music," said former studio 
artist John Hench, who assisted him in the preparation of a storyboard. "He had 
a thing for destiny." 
</P>
<P>
Hench, now senior vice president of Walt Disney Imagineering, remembered Dali 
last week as "a kind of renaissance man," who, unlike his public image, was 
perfectly sane. "Dali said, 'The difference between me and a crazy person is: A 
crazy person dwells in a kind of fantasy -- he's in another room from reality. 
When I walk in that room, I know where I am; I leave the door open. A real 
crazy person can't get out -- the door is locked.' " 
</P>
<P>
Hench recalled that Dali was given complete freedom at Disney: "Walt came in 
and looked at the work from time to time; he saw the storyboard in progress and 
decided to let Dali go ahead and see what would happen. Walt was kind of 
entranced by the whole thing. They had a rapport right from the beginning that 
was unusual. They got along remarkably, without much conversation -- there was 
a sympathy there." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to working on the storyboard, Hench had the task of, as he said, 
"trying to keep the project in some kind of shape we could handle. Dali would 
usually do a key position and then I'd fill in the in-betweens, trying to segue 
from one area to another. He had a concept he was going to stick to in a broad 
sense, but he shared a lot with Walt in his inventive ability. Walt always came 
in with a lot more situations than perhaps a story could hold and Dali was a 
great deal the same way. Every morning he had new ideas. I'm sure we could 
never have fit all of them in the original time allotted." 
</P>
<P>
The plot, as complicated as it became, could not accommodate the fruit of 
Dali's unfettered imagination. "He was so prolific with ideas I don't think 
even Luis Bunuel could use them all," said Hench. "We'd go see some really 
mediocre Western at this little theater in Monterey. Dali would be absolutely 
entranced, and then afterward he'd tell me what the picture meant; he'd redo 
the story. The inevitable stampede of the bulls would be somebody's libido, the 
short little man would be the alter ego of the protagonist . . . he built 
fabulous stories out of these really banal pictures." 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
"Destino" borrowed liberally from the proliferation of images seen in Dali's 
canvases. The heroine of the piece, a young girl drawn to resemble the shadow 
of a bell in a church tower, was lifted from a painting he had done a decade 
earlier, "Suburbs of the Paranoiac-Critical Town." The idea of the sculpture 
coming to life was originally conceived for Ingrid Bergman while he was 
designing the dream scenes for Hitchcock's "Spellbound"; it was vetoed by the 
actress, whom Dali wanted to cover with ants. One new idea for the Disney 
scenario involved a group of baseball players, whose actions were choreographed 
to resemble a ballet. 
</P>
<P>
Dali traveled to the studio every day for a period of two months, later going 
to Monterey to finish the art work. "He came in the morning just like a regular 
worker," Hench said. "He didn't punch a clock, of course, but I don't think 
he'd have minded punching in. He liked ritual." Dali was paid a substantial 
sum, though Disney never revealed how much. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
At one point in their labors, Dali and Hench decided that Disney deserved to 
see what they were up to, and made a 15-second test on color film -- the sole 
realization of the project beyond the storyboard stage. The sequence -- which 
was screened at the County Museum of Art a few years ago -- showed two 
grotesquely distorted faces mounted on the backs of turtles, moving toward each 
other on a bleak landscape; as they came together, the space between the 
profiles took on the shape of a ballerina. Her head was a baseball on the 
horizon. 
</P>
<P>
"Destino" was abandoned through no fault of Dali's, simply a change of mind on 
the part of his employer. "Walt thought the market for package films was gone," 
said Hench. "He was an enormously intuitive man; he could look into the future 
and project a trend. He understood the package concept as communicating a 
certain kind of thing and he figured the public needed something else." 
</P>
<P>
Dali, who often said his own destiny was "to save painting from the nihilism of 
modern art," enjoyed little success in his ventures into film. "L 'Age d'Or," 
on which he collaborated with Bunuel, was received with stink-bombs when it 
opened. The dream sequences for "Spellbound" were severely cut; "The Marx 
Brothers on Horseback Salad," a scenario that grew out of a friendship with 
Harpo Marx, was never realized. 
</P>
<P>
Dali and Disney remained friends over the years. On a subsequent trip to 
Hollywood, Dali rode the producer's miniature train but was frightened by its 
realistic precision. Disney visited the painter many times at his home in Port 
Lligat on the Spanish Costa Brava, once with a proposal to team up on an 
animated "Don Quixote." It never reached the drawing board. They also discussed 
"El Cid," for which Dali developed a story concept, but nothing came of it. 
</P>
<P>
A few years after "Destino" was laid to rest, the storyboard sketches 
disappeared in a theft. "The whole portfolio was stolen. I don't know how many 
hands it passed through, but whoever stole them was discriminating -- he kept 
the best ones," said Hench. Eventually they were purchased by an art dealer in 
New York, who tried to get Dali to autograph them. The dealer could not 
distinguish between Dali's work and Hench's, and many of the latter's sketches 
were authenticated as the work of the master. The material that remained was 
returned to the studio, but many of the treasures -- including the art for the 
film test -- were never seen again. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
The art that survived the theft is preserved today in the studio archives. A 
number of paintings, including a portrait of Jupiter that hung in Disney's 
office until his death, are now in storage. The works have never been 
appraised. 
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, studio publicist Bob Moore decided it would be nice to revive 
"Destino" and brought the idea to a marketing meeting; the project was casually 
discussed and tabled once more. But the idea is still resuscitated every few 
years, and may eventually see the light of day -- possibly as a segment in a 
new version of "Fantasia" being contemplated by Roy Disney. 
</P>
<P>
"The film is so short it would have to be incorporated with something else, and 
nobody can make the decision as to what to package it with," said Moore, now 
retired. "Destino" could be reactivated at some point in the future, he added, 
"but the film was so far ahead of its time in 1946 I don't think people would 
have understood it then, and I don't know that they would understand it now."

<TEXT>
<P>
One reason the Reagan presidency was so enjoyable is that Ronald Reagan 
appeared to enjoy being President, and to enjoy one of the important duties of 
that office -- being on television. 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Carter had seemed a whiner for whom the presidency was a burden and TV 
appearances a painful chore. Gerald Ford was stiff and awkward on TV, and of 
course Richard Nixon's political career had been one long wrestling match with 
the camera, Nixon losing most of the falls. 
</P>
<P>
Just because Reagan was so good on TV doesn't mean that only someone who's good 
on TV can be elected President from now on. Could there be better proof of that 
than his immediate successor? George Bush has had a moment here and there, but 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
The Reagan presidency may stand for years and years as the best television 
production ever to originate from the White House. And not just because Reagan 
had brilliant media advisers, though he did, nor because he was so often 
propped up against scenic backdrops, though he was. 
</P>
<P>
All the calculation and planning wouldn't have counted for diddly if Reagan 
weren't Reagan, a nice man who looked into the tube and communicated 
trustworthiness, optimism and a contagious resilience. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan survived an assassination attempt, several operations, major scandals 
like Iran-Contra, palace intrigues and a first-term recession. Yet most of the 
time, when he appeared on TV, he looked spirited and hale, rejuvenated and 
rejuvenating. 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't going to let us see him looking defeated. And that helped keep us 
from feeling defeated too. When Reagan told a joke, it was funny; it got a 
laugh. He was the first President since John F. Kennedy with a sharp sense of 
comic timing, and his humor was often generously self-deprecatory. He had the 
galvanizing charm of F.D.R. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe some people groaned when they heard the President was going to make a 
prime-time visitation, but most people were pleased to see him. Reporters 
clamored for more press conferences; the public did not. Ronald Reagan was 
smart about many things, and one of them was not wearing out his welcome in the 
American living room. 
</P>
<P>
His farewell address to the nation sounded like a commercial. But then, it was, 
even if there was nothing left to sell. Reagan's salesmanship is compulsive. 
He'd really been more successful in his days as a TV pitchman than during his 
years as a movie actor. 
</P>
<P>
And in this speech he was saying, in effect, that the manufacturers' claims for 
its product (his Administration) had been valid. He wanted to know he had left 
the customer satisfied. Most of the customers, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan brought something great to the office. He seemed mythic, and he returned 
mythic status to the presidency, even with his guy-next-door manner. Hollywood 
has been the nation's myth maker for most of this century, and Reagan didn't 
mind exploiting movie imagery to make his points. 
</P>
<P>
His appearance at Normandy for the anniversary of D-day was an unforgettable 
emotional event. Pundits said it was "carefully choreographed." So what? The 
most careful choreography in the world doesn't work unless the leading man can 
bring it off. Reagan's choreographers had as easy a job as Fred Astaire's. 
</P>
<P>
CNN televised, live, Reagan's farewell to the military at Andrews Air Force 
Base. The bands stopped the marches long enough for one chorus of "Auld Lang 
Syne." Reagan looked as though he were fighting back tears. It was a movie 
scene, like John Wayne bidding adieu to the cavalry in John Ford's "She Wore a 
Yellow Ribbon." 
</P>
<P>
There is a reason these scenes work: They touch something deep in the human 
soul. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan also knew that to be a success on TV, you shouldn't over-define 
yourself. You have to let viewers project onto you qualities they admire. When 
some of us looked at Ronald Reagan, we saw our fathers and mothers, our 
grandparents -- people who lived through the Great Depression and World War II 
and knew a lot more about sacrifice and survival than we did. 
</P>
<P>
This may be why Reagan was about as popular with younger voters as with older 
ones. He was a link to times of nobler values, the ideals that heroes in old 
movies fight for. Ronald Reagan let us believe in them again. His video 
presidency was all about the magic of believing. 
</P>
<P>
Many people saw and yet did not believe. But believing, at least a little, made 
it a lot more fun.

What your article on women who are "making it" shows is that the companies for 
which these women work are gender-blind only if their employees are not 
mothers. Maybe this is because you'd have had to devote at least 10 times the 
space to women who, by your standards, are not making it because the men and 
childless and/or affluent women in management can't relate to parental 
responsibilities and refuse to allow parents to successfully combine work and 
parenthood.

STAGE WEEK: AN UNCUT 'RICHARD III' AT ACTORS ALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's "Richard III" uncensored and uncut (1,100 lines of dialogue belong to the 
title character alone) as Shakespeare's tragedy opens Friday at Actors Alley in 
Van Nuys. "The company had never done Shakespeare before -- and it seemed the 
proper thing for a repertory company to attempt to do," said Jordan Charney, 
whose staging of the work marks his final production as artistic director of 
the theater. 
</P>
<P>
"It began in our Sunday workshop, investigating how to do Shakespeare," he 
continued. "We started with sonnets, then went on to scenes. Everyone caught on 
to the needs of Shakespeare -- his poetic language and the antithetical things 
that he's always comparing: Winter to summer, day to night. Once the actors 
understand those images, it makes everything very clear. Then when they say it, 
it doesn't sound like Latin." 
</P>
<P>
The production utilizes 22 actors (in 65 parts), "so it gives a third of the 
company a chance to appear," Charney noted. "And it's lively stuff. That evil 
little guy, all those murders." A body count? "Well, he kills his brother 
Clarence, chops off Hastings' head. He kills the Duke of Buckingham, kills the 
Queen's brother and sons, kills the two children in the Tower. Then there's a 
big battle at the end, when Richmond finally kills him. So it really is a very 
bloody play." 
</P>
<P>
Walter Raymond plays the title role. 
</P>
<P>
BRANCHING OUT: "Just as the twig is bent, the tree's inclined." The Alexander 
Pope line sets the tone for George Furth's family comedy "Twigs," which 
recently opened at Theatre 40. Directing is Barth Benedict, former artistic 
director of the Barn Theatre in Albuquerque, N. M. 
</P>
<P>
"We meet four members of the same family -- three sisters and their mother -- 
but never at the same time," said Benedict, who's opted away from the 
traditional staging (having one actress play all the roles) by assigning four 
different actresses. "The first scene, with the youngest sister, Emily, takes 
place in the morning. The second one, with Celia, takes place noon-ish. 
Dorothy's takes place around supper time. And Ma and Pa (come on) around 7-8 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"All four women are compulsive talkers," added Benedict, "and they all have 
psychological reasons why they talk. Extreme talkativeness can be funny or it 
can be tragic. Furth lets us see it from both points of view. There's a real 
understanding for women's conversations and women as communicators, women's 
need to talk. It's almost used as a tool for health. These are women reaching 
out to live life to the best of their abilities. We see how well they do/do not 
succeed." 
</P>
<P>
CRITICAL CROSSFIRE: A touring production of Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine's 
Tony Award-winning "Into the Woods" -- a musical melange of such fairy tales as 
Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood, Rapunzel, and Jack and the Beanstalk -- 
opened recently at the Ahmanson. 
</P>
<P>
Cheered The Times' Dan Sullivan: "The comings and going are ingeniously linked; 
no clue is planted that doesn't pay off later. But the show can't be watched 
with the mind-set that prevails at ordinary musicals. We have to keep 
constantly on our guard." 
</P>
<P>
In the Herald Examiner, Richard Stayton compared the production to earlier 
incarnations: "This road show version shrinks the elegant Tony Straiges forest 
and cottages into paper cut-outs. Gone are the numerous special effects gracing 
the Broadway version. The magic beans no longer sparkle . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Said Tom Jacobs in the Daily News: "It's hard to say how many people will leave 
this delightful show fully aware of the link the authors are trying to make 
between 'once upon a time' and our times. Probably not many. But as Bruno 
Bettelheim has noted, fairy tales work on the unconscious." 
</P>
<P>
From Sandra Kreiswirth in the Outlook: " 'Into the Woods' covers a lot of 
psychological territory. Perhaps not as biting as some of the composer's other 
work, it remains a show that reveals new things each time it's seen. (It is) 
sophisticated, sarcastic and searing . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Said the Orange County Register's Jeff Rubio: "If the fairy tale theme sounds 
like a cute, simple idea on which to hang a musical, forget it; the show is 
ultimately neither. It works less as a smooth-flowing, organically satisfying 
musical than as a backdrop for the occasional genius that leaps out." 
</P>
<P>
In Daily Variety, Tim Gray found "wit and intelligence to spare, but it lacks 
the one thing it needs above all: Magic. Still, it's definitely worth seeing -- 
even a minor work by Sondheim is still a major theatrical event. It is a 
difficult play to love, but one that's easy to admire." 
</P>
<P>
And from Jeffrey Jolson-Colburn in the Hollywood Reporter: "The play is 
delightful and thought-provoking, even if it doesn't have a terribly happy 
ending. The survivors all grew and became at peace with themselves and the 
others, so at least they lived sagely ever after."

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Standards aren't what they used to be, but tickets cost more than ever. Much 
more. The halls yawn with empty seats. Audiences seem bored. The multitudes who 
dash for the exit at the stroke of the final cadence do so at risk of being 
trampled. A fair number start dashing even before the first stroke. 
</P>
<P>
In matters of music, Fun City just isn't much fun any more. At least it wasn't 
much fun in mid-January. 
</P>
<P>
Even the lavish, hyper-hyped, bigger-than-life, million-dollar "Aida" at the 
arch-conservative Metropolitan Opera is in trouble. The subscribers come 
primarily to applaud the scenery and the horses, and in this regard the 
management gives them much to applaud. However, the standing-room habitues, a 
more sophisticated and more demanding crowd, stay away. It is a bad sign. 
</P>
<P>
If all had gone as planned, the new "Aida" would have been staged by Franco 
Zeffirelli, the over-indulged past master of conspicuous operatic consumption. 
His scheme proved too rich even for the Met's blood, however, and too 
cumbersome for Lincoln Center logistics. 
</P>
<P>
Undaunted, the company turned instead to Sonja Frisell. This much-traveled 
operatic factota was charged to make "Aida" look spectacular without flirting 
with bankruptcy or over-extending the warehouse. Collaborating with the set 
designer Gianni Quaranta -- best known, perhaps, for the plush cinematic decors 
of "A Room With a View" -- she gave New York a terrific, splashy, exotic, 
kitschy, empty show. 
</P>
<P>
If only the scenery could sing. 
</P>
<P>
The enlightened traffic cop assembled a cast of thousands. Well, if one didn't 
look too closely at the same reappearing faces, it looked like a cast of 
thousands. 
</P>
<P>
Frisell and assorted friends cluttered the stage picturesquely, exhumed a lot 
of quaintly ancient rituals, grouped the masses in ever-pretty formations. 
Toying with the fancy machinery at their disposal, they conjured mighty walls 
from nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
On cue, they summoned a huge, self-propelled set from subterranean vaults. They 
embellished the vast stage with portable pillars, towering statues and 
archeological artifacts so authentic they might have been lifted straight from 
the hoary pages of the "Victor Book of the Opera." 
</P>
<P>
This "Aida" certainly was grand. Unfortunately, it seemed grand primarily for 
the sake of being grand. 
</P>
<P>
Not incidentally, despite the vast miracles of modern technology at its 
disposal, the Met chose to observe three lengthy, unnecessary intermissions. 
The evening ended shortly before midnight, and not a moment too soon. Some 
traditions die hard. 
</P>
<P>
Great singing actors -- or even great singers -- might have held their own 
under the extenuating theatrical conditions. Given a few golden throats or 
inspired theatrical personalities, the production-number distortions and 
distracting elevator-orgies could heve been of secondary importance. 
Unfortunately, vocal paragons are scarce in Verdi at the Met these days. 
</P>
<P>
They are scarce everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
On opening night -- by all reports, a distinctly problematic opening night -- 
the principals included Leona Mitchell as the titular slave-princess, Fiorenza 
Cossotto as her tempestuous rival, Placido Domingo as the tormented 
warrior-hero and Sherrill Milnes as his baritonal nemesis. James Levine, the 
beleaguered artistic director, conducted. 
</P>
<P>
By Jan. 18, everyone except Mitchell had moved on to more pressing duties. At 
the 662nd Met "Aida" since 1886, it was Verdi essentially by rote. It was 
operatic business as usual. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, who had introduced her problematic Aida to Southern California in 
Orange County last season, seemed even more problematic, and more egocentric, 
in these potentially lofty surroundings. She looked lovely, struck predictable 
prima-donna poses and faithfully imitated Leontyne Price's chest-tone 
mannerisms. She also managed to float some exquisite pianissimo phrases, a few 
of them in tandem with Verdi's prescribed note values and Ghislanzoni's 
specific text. 
</P>
<P>
Stefania Toczyska, a San Francisco Opera stalwart, abused her lower register in 
Amneris' music in quest of dramatic fire. This took an obvious toll on her top 
voice, leaving her with a desperately threadbare sound for the climactic 
outbursts of the trial scene. 
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Popov, the loud, bleating, ex-Soviet Radames, revealed ringing tenoral 
resources at the mercy of clumsy emission. In such company, Alain Fondary's 
solid Amonasro and Paul Plishka's sonorous Ramfis resembled happy fugitives 
from some distant golden age. 
</P>
<P>
Christian Badea inherited Levine's baton, if not his flexibility in 
accommodating wayward sopranos. Nevertheless, the talented and temperamental 
young Romanian did enforce considerable verve, force and lyrical flow on his 
own terms. He obviously deserves a better production, under better conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Compared to "Aida," the current version of "Il Trovatore" (new last season) is 
a model of simple abstraction. The simplicity here connotes blandness, alas, 
and the abstraction goes no further and no deeper than window-dressing chic. 
</P>
<P>
One cannot help feeling that Ezio Frigerio's unit set -- a network of black 
marble steps, mobile pillars and painterly projections -- and Fabrizio Melano's 
three easy movement-patterns were predicated on practicality, not on artistic 
conviction. The visual milieu is decorative, static and, at best, neutral. 
</P>
<P>
Levine conducted the Jan. 21 matinee crisply yet passionately. The splendid 
orchestra and chorus gave their all for him. On the stage, unfortunately, his 
best efforts -- and Verdi's -- were compromised by the work of undisciplined 
has-beens and well-intentioned would-be's. 
</P>
<P>
Aprile Millo, replacing the originally announced and patently miscast Eva 
Marton, brought the right vocal credentials to the arching phrases of Leonora: 
rich, gleaming spinto tone, a wide dynamic range, respect for the legato 
phrase, a bona-fide sense of style. These rare virtues were offset by 
occasional technical inequities (cautious fioriture, some misjudged pianissimo 
attacks) and by a naive, silent-movie approach to histrionic challenges. 
</P>
<P>
None of this discouraged the competitive brava-screamers in the audience from 
registering conspicuous ecstasy, sometimes at awkward moments. Millo is fast 
becoming a cult figure here, and this, after all, was a broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
As Azucena, Fiorenza Cossotto gave a classic demonstration of old-fashioned 
diva narcissism, with vulgar vocal tricks employed to mask declining vocal 
resources. The rough tone and approximate pitch could not be masked. 
</P>
<P>
Her dauntless fans -- one assumes they are fans and not just employees -- 
registered vociferous ecstasy anyway. Obligingly, she managed to steal an 
unsanctioned curtain call in mid act. 
</P>
<P>
Luciano Pavarotti, nearly everyone's hero, sang and acted with considerable 
finesse and surprising involvement as Manrico until high notes loomed. Then he 
closed his eyes, threw back his head, applied all available pressure, and 
willed us to hope for the best. 
</P>
<P>
The best at the crest of "Di quella pira" turned out to be a B rather than the 
traditional C, thanks to canny transposition. The big note was held -- proudly, 
strenuously and stubbornly -- until the cows came home and left again. 
</P>
<P>
Sherrill Milnes, confronting a late-career crisis, alternated baritonal 
bel-canto with bitonal bluster as Luna. As Ferrando, Paul Plishka once again 
rose nobly to defend minor-basso honor. 
</P>
<P>
The sublime fared badly at the mighty Met. Meanwhile at the modest City Center, 
the ridiculous didn't do so well either. 
</P>
<P>
The vehicle on Jan. 17 was "H.M.S. Pinafore," as presented by the New Sadler's 
Wells Opera of London. This wasn't an elegantly witty production like the model 
introduced a couple of decades ago by Tyrone Guthrie. It wasn't a parody of the 
parody as revamped last year by Brian Macdonald. This certainly wasn't 
revisionist Gilbert-and-Sullivan as concocted by Jonathan Miller or Peter 
Sellars, yet it had little to do with the tried, untrue but sacred rituals of 
D'Oyly Carte. 
</P>
<P>
This was a "Pinafore" that respected the basic tenets of tradition but did so 
clumsily, somnolently and with very broad comic accents. As conducted by David 
White, it was, moreover, a "Pinafore" that slighted Sullivan's music while it 
smudged Gilbert's satire. 
</P>
<P>
The New Sadler's Wells, a vicissitudinous operetta ensemble, was formed to fill 
the London gap when the D'Oyly Cartians rolled up their canvases in 1982. Now 
the original Savoyards are back in business and, ironically, the Wells company 
is encountering some financial woes of its own. 
</P>
<P>
For its American debut, it mustered a polite, ill-focused, 4-year-old gag 
festival about British class distinctions directed by Christopher Renshaw. 
Nickolas Grace, best known here as Anthony Blanche in "Brideshead Revisited," 
incongruously took off Prince Charles while popping his eyes as Sir Joseph 
Porter. Linda Ormiston played Little Buttercup as if she were a plump and 
pleasing Bette Midler gone astray. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon Sandison bumbled reasonably as the Captain. Thomas Lawlor, formerly of 
D'Oyly Carte, quivered seedily and amiably as Dick Deadeye. The romantic leads, 
Rosemary Ashe and Hugh Hetherington, looked fatuous (which is acceptable) and 
sounded dull (which isn't). 
</P>
<P>
At the end, everyone sang "Rule, Brittania." 
</P>
<P>
This "Pinafore" was neither saucy nor a beauty. It offered a few dreamy 
roundelays but little joy and no rapture. 
</P>
<P>
According to unpopular wisdom, no one pays much attention to the New York 
Philharmonic these days. Zubin Mehta, the lame-duck maestro, reportedly 
alienates the press, asks little of his orchestra, favors safe, unimaginative 
programs and lulls the public into complacency. Much of that seemed true Friday 
afternoon, Jan. 20. 
</P>
<P>
Avery Fisher Hall was only about half full. The matronly audience came late, 
applauded perfunctorily in the wrong places (Costa Mesa holds no monopoly on 
mood disruption) and left early. 
</P>
<P>
The promised agenda made odd bill-mates of Mozart, Beethoven and John Knowles 
Paine, the Germanic romantic from Maine who lived from 1839 to 1906. When Julia 
Varady, the scheduled soprano, fell ill, however, Mehta scrapped the 
conventional Mozart and Beethoven arias. With cavalier disregard for those who 
bought tickets to hear the scheduled works -- and with possible disregard for 
stylistic balance -- he substituted the Four Last Songs of Richard Strauss. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the concert turned out to be more interesting than one might have 
expected. Obviously in a subdued mood, Mehta got the orchestra to play with 
welcome richness, breadth and warmth. Paine's overture to "As You Like It," at 
the beginning, and his Symphony No. 1, at the end, revealed little flair or 
originality but much academic skill, not to mention intriguing echoes of Brahms 
and Beethoven. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Dunn, the ersatz soloist, sang Strauss' poignant valedictories with 
Wagnerian opulence. Although the sound per se was always imposing, the impact 
could have been enhanced with with greater verbal point and coloristic variety. 
</P>
<P>
Mehta complemented the generalized emotion with marvelously lush but not 
terribly introspective accompaniment. It was almost like the good old days in 
Los Angeles.

ON THE RECORD: LEGGE'S OPERETTA SERIES ON CD: A DELICIOUS FROTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Walter Legge, the producing genius behind the operatic treasures of the early 
years of the Angel/EMI label, deserves no less credit for overseeing the 
operetta series dating from the same years, 1952-58. The nominal star of those 
performances was Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Mrs. Legge -- but no one dared suggest 
nepotism with a talent of that magnitude. 
</P>
<P>
Schwarzkopf was part of an ensemble that, in the operettas, included the young 
and virtually unknown Nicolai Gedda; a pair of echt-Viennese singing comedians, 
Erich Kunz and Karl Donch, and soubrettes Erika Koth and Emmy Loose, all under 
the lithe baton of Otto Ackermann, presiding over a London Philharmonia 
Orchestra transformed into the world's most stylish waltz band. 
</P>
<P>
The series is at last with us again, sounding better than ever in digital sound 
on Angel compact discs. 
</P>
<P>
For one listener the cream of this frothy crop is "Wiener Blut," top non-vocal 
tunes (waltzes, polkas, gallops) from the pen of Johann Strauss Jr., 
posthumously joined by the book and lyrics of Victor Leon and Leo Stein, who 
would later create the "Die Lustige Witwe" libretto for Franz Lehar. Their 
efforts on behalf of "Wiener Blut" resulted in a musical delight coupled to a 
loopy farce of which Feydeau might not have been ashamed. 
</P>
<P>
The Legge troupe, headed by Schwarzkopf -- the teasing, cooing, vocal 
affectations that can make listening to her a trial in more serious repertory 
are made to order for this material -- Gedda and Kunz is pure joy, and Angel 
accommodates the 70-minute score on a single CD. 
</P>
<P>
Another arrangement, this time involving surgery by Erich Wolfgang Korngold on 
an existing, unsuccessful Strauss operetta, is "Eine Nacht in Venedig." While 
the work is musically cohesive in Korngold's refashioning, the 
confused-identities plot has little of the wit of the "Wiener Blut" libretto. 
The tunes, however, are irresistible and the performance is consistently on the 
mark, with the additional plum of some ravishing singing by the Philharmonia 
Chorus. The single CD (69530) is nearly 80 minutes long. 
</P>
<P>
Strauss' other great operetta, which, like "Fledermaus," can be found on the 
major operatic stages alongside Mozart and Verdi (although with less 
frequency), is "Der Zigeunerbaron" (69526, 2 CDs). It is given what must be the 
performance of its lifetime by the repertory company, augmented by the 
25-year-old Hermann Prey, belting out the great last-act recruiting song with 
spectacular brio. 
</P>
<P>
The best known work of Lehar, ruler of the second generation of Viennese 
operettists, is, of course, "The Merry Widow" (69520 -- another single-disc 
bargain). Schwarzkopf is both merry and in most alluring vocal form, while 
Gedda and Loose exude optimum charm as the young lovers. Casting Kunz as Danilo 
may cheat us of some notes -- Kunz's range was restricted, to say the least -- 
but he does give us some memorable clowning. 
</P>
<P>
A more serious Lehar operetta is "Das Land des Lachelns" (The Land of Smiles). 
Ackermann and his cast made a powerful case for it with their 1953 recording 
(69523, 2 CDs). Hearing its greatest tune (and Richard Tauber's signature), 
"Dein ist mein ganzes Herz" (Yours is my heart alone), in chilling context is a 
revelation: The Chinese prince sings it to his young Viennese wife to indicate 
that of all his wives she is the one who has his heart, which ultimately proves 
insufficient for the lady. 
</P>
<P>
There is more to this operetta than that single tune -- ravishingly sung by 
Gedda, with no attempt at imitating Tauber -- and, again, all of it handsomely 
done by the Legge troupe. But there is something uncomfortable-making about the 
libretto, by Fritz Lohner and Ludwig Herzer, in which the intelligent Asians 
are perhaps unintentionally caricatured as being shifty and barbaric while the 
frivolous, even dimwitted, Europeans are to be loved at pretty-face value. 
</P>
<P>
It should be noted that the two "Smiles" CDs (69523) total only 87 minutes 
playing time -- eight minutes longer than the single-disc "Eine Nacht in 
Venedig." Surely Angel could have included some of the operetta arias recorded 
by Schwarzkopf and Ackermann around the time of these sessions. 
</P>
<P>
"Die Fledermaus" (69531, 2 CDs) is the single fatally flawed production in the 
lot, done in by two pieces of miscasting: a self-effacing Bach tenor, Helmut 
Krebs, chosen to impersonate Alfred, the preening Italian tenor, and Kunz, who 
is is all wrong for Falke, trying to make it on charm alone where a strong, 
secure operatic voice is demanded. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, charm is precisely what is lacking in the conducting of Herbert von 
Karajan, who muscles and hacks his way through the score where Ackermann 
danced. 
</P>
<P>
A final cavil, which applies to the entire series: While trilingual notes (and 
synopses) of minimal worth are provided, the crucial librettos and their 
translations are not. Hardly fair play when one considers that these are 
full-priced CDs.

GIORDANO: "ANDREA CHENIER." Zinka Milanov, Mario del Monaco, Leonard Warren; 
Metropolitan Opera Chorus and Orchestra conducted by Fausto Cleva. MET-15 (two 
compact discs or two cassettes). (Available for a $150 contribution from the 
Metropolitan Opera Fund, Box 930, New York, N.Y. 10023). Nobody suspected it 
was a golden age while they were living through it, but if this is how 
Giordano's fantasy of the French revolutionary poet fared on the afternoon of 
Dec. 4, 1954, then we'd all better look back with regret. Bold, authoritative 
singing like that delivered by Milanov's Maddalena, del Monaco's Chenier and 
Warren's Carlo Gerard is these days a part of contemporary casting fantasies, 
rather than an opera house reality. The performance is stagy, unsubtle (Del 
Monaco would appear to have located the radio microphone and rarely 
relinquishes it) and immensely enjoyable. Cleva's no-nonsense conducting of the 
percussion-heavy orchestra is an additional plus. The digitalized restoration 
is impressive, and like all the Met Historic Broadcasts, the packaging is 
lavish. ALLAN ULRICH

MUSIC NEWS: PERFORMERS AS PATIENTS: NO PAIN, NO GAIN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three out of four performing musicians suffer medical problems serious enough 
to affect their playing, according to the current edition of the New England 
Journal of Medicine, released last week. Two out of three play in pain but 
eight out of 10 willingly accept the pain in order to play better. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Alan H. Lockwood of the Performing Artists Clinic at the University of 
Texas Medical School in Houston acknowledges that "the neuromuscular complexity 
associated with high-level musicianship renders the instrumentalist susceptible 
to a variety of disabling problems." 
</P>
<P>
He goes on to cite some responses to a recent questionnaire sent to 2,122 
members of the 4,025-member International Conference of Symphony and Opera 
Musicians (ICSOM). According to Lockwood, 76% of the 2,122 respondents 
"reported having had at least one medical problem severe enough to affect 
performance," with another 36% reporting up to four severe problems. 
</P>
<P>
In one study, Lockwood says, interviews with 485 members from eight different 
symphony orchestras showed that 64% of those players suffered from "painful 
overuse syndromes." He goes on to say that "similar data have been reported by 
others." 
</P>
<P>
Psychological stress is another, separate, area of study, Dr. Lockwood states, 
adding that "About one-fourth of the respondents to the ICSOM questionnaire had 
performance anxiety, which was a major problem for one in six in that group. 
About 20% were concerned about their alcohol consumption, and similar numbers 
were troubled by the use of prescription and nonprescription drugs. depression 
was present in 17% . . . with 7% indicating that is was a severe problem." 
</P>
<P>
Referring to discussions in the media of these issues in the past decade, after 
well-known performers like pianists Gary Graffman and Leon Fleisher went public 
with their problems, Lockwood said that peformers are seeking treatment sooner: 
</P>
<P>
"In my own practice, it is common for professionals and conservatory students 
to seek help after a week of symptoms or to telephone on the day symptoms 
begin. This change is probably the result of a number of factors, including a 
recognition that pain is not a normal part of making music, an increased 
awareness of the frequency and type of problems that affect musicians, and 
possibly, the publicity accorded to a number of prominent musicians with 
medical problems . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Referring to one of his own studies, Lockwood says, "Among all respondents, 
nearly 80% indicated that pain was acceptable in their attempts to overcome 
technical problems. This high incidence of problems and the prevalence of the 
'no pain, no gain' philosophy strongly suggest that changes are needed in the 
teaching of music. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
He concludes, "It would be irresponsible for a football coach to ignore 
physical conditioning. The same may be true in music pedagogy." 
</P>
<P>
JOB OPENINGS: Just posted, in Overture, the monthly of the Musicians Union, is 
the position of music director/conductor of the Santa Monica Symphony. After 
seven years with the orchestra, Yehuda Gilad, who conducts other orchestras in 
California and New Jersey, and holds teaching posts as well, will step down at 
the end of this season. Interested candidates should contact Santa Monica 
Symphony Assn., P.O. Box 3101, Santa Monica CA 90403. The duties of the job, by 
the way, include more than conducting the five concerts per season the 
orchestra puts on in Santa Monica Civic Auditorium; the music director is 
expected to lead weekly, as well as final, rehearsals, plus concerts. . . . In 
the meantime, the announcement of the next Long Beach Symphony concert, at 
which Jon Robertson, another candidate for the job of music director, will 
conduct, on Feb. 11, has arrived. That informative missile says that Jon is 
"pronounced 'yawn.' " Funny -- we thought it was pronounced "yon." 
</P>
<P>
AT THE KEYBOARD: Contemporary music specialist Alan Feinberg plays a recital 
devoted to piano music by J.S. Bach, Charles Wuorinen, Javanshir Kuliyev, 
Robert Helps and Roger Sessions, Tuesday night at 8 in the Gerald Daniel 
Recital Hall at Cal State Long Beach. . . . Another American pianist, Richard 
Goode, appears here this week. In the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion at the Music 
Center, Monday night, Goode gives a Beethoven recital comprising four sonatas: 
the one in G, Opus 31, No. 1; the E-flat, called "Das Lebewohl," Opus 81a; Opus 
101, in A, and the final Sonata, in C minor, Opus 111. . . . Harpsichordist 
Jennifer Paul plays 15 sonatas by Domenico Scarlatti on the noontime concerts 
of the Dame Myra Hess series, Wednesday at 12:15 p.m. at the Transamerica 
Auditorium, 1150 S. Olive St., downtown. . . . And Richard Grayson, who gives 
annual performances of keyboard improvisation and live electronic music at 
Occidental College, where he teaches, takes his specialties out to ("Little") 
Bridges Hall of Music at the Claremont Colleges, Feb. 10 at 8 p.m. 
</P>

COMPOSERS: Roger Bourland, whose horn trio was given a premiere performance on 
Pacific Serenades last week, has received other recent commissions. For a 
consortium of commissioners, Bourland will write a viola sonata to be given 
first performances by Walter Trampler in New York, James Dunham in Philadelphia 
and Marcus Thompson in Boston. On a matching grant from IBM, the composer is 
writing what he describes as "a multi-media tryptich-opera" about Jacqueline 
Onassis, Andy Warhol and the Dalai Lama. And, on a co-commission from the San 
Francisco Conservatory and the department of music of the University of 
Chicago, Bourland is writing "Rossetti Waltzes" for chorus and piano. . . . 
Called by one musician, "the greatest composer of synagogue music," David 
Nowakowsky (1848-1921) was choirmaster of the Brody Synagogue in Odessa, 
Russia, from 1869 until his death. Some of his music, now being revived through 
the efforts of the foundationbearing his name, will be heard at a concert, 
Tuesday night at 8 at the Stephen S. Wise Temple, 15500 Stephen S. Wise Drive, 
in Bel-Air. Appearing at this event will be Cantor David Lefkowitz of the Park 
Avenue Synagogue in New York City, Cantor Nathan Lam of the Wise Temple, and a

ROY ORBISON 
</P>
<P>
"Mystery Girl." Virgin 
</P>
<P>
*** 1/2 
</P>
<P>
For anyone ever touched by the dramatic sweep and disarming intimacy of Roy 
Orbison's voice, there are moments in this posthumous release as magical as 
anything the late Rock and Roll Hall of Fame member ever recorded. 
</P>
<P>
Working with a variety of producers and musicians (including T Bone Burnett, 
Jeff Lynne, George Harrison and Tom Petty), Orbison doesn't always come up with 
material that matches the haunting poignancy of such '60s high points as 
"Running Scared" or "Only the Lonely." 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, however, the songs are both distinguished and finely 
tailored. In Elvis Costello's dark "The Comedians," Orbison retraces the eerie 
intensity of his most unsettling tales of romantic heartbreak, while the 
soothing "California Blue" (which he wrote with Lynne and Petty) recalls the 
innocence of "Blue Bayou." 
</P>
<P>
"She's a Mystery to Me" -- written by U2's Bono Hewson and the Edge -- 
represents the greatest growth. Rather than the familiar Orbison roles of 
someone defeated by rejection or overjoyed by acceptance, the song deals with 
the confusion of a complex relationship. It's a difficult song, but Orbison's 
delicate rendition is as gripping as any of his more overtly dramatic 
exercises. 
</P>
<P>
The album's most evocative track is "In the Real World," a graceful Will 
Jennings-Richard Kerr composition that enables Orbison to offer some comforting 
reflections about life outside of his trademark dream world: "There are things 
we can't change / And endings come to us / In ways that we can't rearrange." 
</P>
<P>
The gentleness of the vocal on "In the Real World" reminds you that Orbison's 
greatness wasn't tied simply to the power in his voice or the intensity of his 
arrangements. Of all the great rock vocalists, perhaps no one sang with quite 
so much natural soulfulness as Orbison. That's why his tales of loneliness were 
so haunting. They didn't just approximate our feelings. They virtually 
duplicated them. ROBERT HILBURN

NEW ORDER 
</P>
<P>
"Technique." Qwest 
</P>
<P>
*** 
</P>
<P>
"My life ain't no holiday / I've been through the point of no return / I've 
seen what a man can do / I've seen all the hate of a woman too." 
</P>
<P>
Hardly the kind of sentiment to inspire non-sedentary dance-floor maneuvers. 
But this line is from "Vanishing Point," another movement-ready bit of 
moodiness from New Order, the masters of manic-depressive disco, a group that 
defined post-punk electro-dance music with songs like "Blue Monday." 
</P>
<P>
Much of "Technique" suffers from familiarity, but no other modern music "dance" 
band is as idiosyncratic as New Order. Sounding, at turns, like cool, technical 
studio wizards and an emotionally desolate garage band, the English group 
ranges from dance-music sampling and edits on the most innovative piece here, 
"Fine Time," to a guitar-mangling, punkish solo on "Run," which nods its 
melodic head toward crude-master Lou Reed. 
</P>
<P>
Some consider New Order a rather joyless lot, but there are signs of hope and 
even sly humor running through "Technique": "All the Way" is an anthem-like 
call for personal autonomy and creativity, but its arrangement deliberately 
imitates the Cure's "In Between Days" -- which was perceived by Anglophile 
music fans as a New Order steal. 
</P>
<P>
But the bulk of "Technique" centers on the task of maintaining romantic 
relationships. In "Guilty Partner," the track that comes closest to the 
beautiful desperation of the band's earlier incarnation as Joy Division, singer 
Bernard Sumner, wounded at a lover's infidelity, uses the desperate emotional 
gambit of appealing to a renegade paramour's guilt. With the exception of "Fine 
Time," there may be little new ground broken here, but when it comes to the 
sound of a broken psyche, New Order never misses a beat. CRAIG LEE

FACES: TONE LOC: A 'WILD THING' IN THE WORLD OF RAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Gimme one of those," said rapper Tone Loc, pointing to a pack of cigarettes on 
the conference-room table in his manager's West Hollywood office. "I've quit 
smoking, but what the hell. I do everything else I'm not supposed to." 
</P>
<P>
It was early evening. Loc, who has a smash hit single, "Wild Thing," was, as he 
said several times, feeling good. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm taking the rap world by storm," Loc boasted, laughing -- almost howling -- 
in triumph. He pulled a bottle of beer -- his third -- out of a carton, walked 
over to the window and, using the window ledge, popped it open. Raising the 
bottle in a toast, he said: "To 'Wild Thing.' " 
</P>
<P>
You can't blame Loc, 22, for gloating. Three months ago he was just another 
promising local rapper. His two previous singles, "I've Got It Goin' On" and 
'I'm on Fire," had gotten some attention on KDAY, L.A's major rap station, but 
stardom seemed far away. Now, thanks to the racy "Wild Thing" -- which is in 
the pop Top 5 and a debut album, "Loc'd After Dark," on Delicious Vinyl Records 
-- stardom may be just around the corner. 
</P>
<P>
With a fullback's build (6 feet, 1 inch tall, 230 pounds), Loc can be menacing 
-- and he knows it. "Women like the tough approach and I like women," he said. 
"That's what 'Wild Thing' is all about." 
</P>
<P>
"Wild Thing," which boasts an overpowering beat, is downright lewd. Like many 
rap songs, it's full raunch and sexual swagger. According to Loc, that's a 
plus: "Kids like it because it's dirty. Let's face it. They know what it means. 
If it was clean, who'd play it? Who'd listen to it?" 
</P>
<P>
Originally, Loc said, it was even racier: "The first version was real dirty. It 
was going to be an album cut, not a single. But my producers wanted it to be a 
single. They had me rewrite it, clean it up. This guy Marvin Young helped write 
parts of it here and there." 
</P>
<P>
When Loc was signed by Delicious Vinyl, which is now distributed by Island 
Records, he was the first artist on the label. It was the first record contract 
for Loc, who had been writing rap songs since his mid-teens. But until last 
year he never really considered making a career out of it. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in a group for a while, but when it broke up I retired," he said. "I had 
to go to work to earn money to live. But my cousin, who used to be my manager, 
hooked me up with the guys who were starting Delicious Vinyl." 
</P>
<P>
Loc's "Wild Thing" is a totally different song from Sam Kinison's current hit 
of the same name, a remake of the Troggs' 1966 classic. Naturally there's been 
some confusion. "People ask me why I did that remake," Loc said. "They thought 
I was white -- that I was Sam. They thought I was singing his song. 
</P>
<P>
"My single came out first. I didn't know about his song. A few weeks later, 
somebody told me there was this other song called 'Wild Thing.' He (Kinison) 
does all that screaming and hollering. I don't do that. It's an insult for 
people to think I sing his song." 
</P>
<P>
Loc is now starting a national tour, which includes playing clubs. He'd rather 
play big arenas but, he said, if the fee is big enough, he'll play anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
"For the right money," he said, "I'd play a Ku Klux Klan rally." 
</P>
<P>
Like many rappers, Loc got into the genre because it's so popular among young 
ghetto blacks. He, however, isn't from the ghetto. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to take a bus to get there (the ghetto) to hang out with the fellas," 
Loc said. "I was raised with money, on the Westside in a two-story house. My 
father died when I was 5, but my mother runs a business that makes a lot of 
money. My friends didn't have money, but I did." 
</P>
<P>
His real name is Tony Smith. Tone Loc, he explained, is a gang name, with Loc 
being short for loco. "I'm not in a gang anymore, but I kept the name," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
These days it's fashionable for rappers to claim they're former gang members, 
since that instantly projects the kind of tough, street-wise image that lends 
credibility to their lyrics. While some rappers' boasts of gang ties don't ring 
true, Loc's seem legitimate. 
</P>
<P>
"I was serious about it (gang involvement)," he said. "I was in one of the 
major gangs. Being in a gang wasn't really necessary for me like it is for 
other guys. They're in it because they're born poor and don't have much else. I 
had all these other opportunities and I was still into the gang thing." 
</P>
<P>
One big reason for his involvement, he said, was to provide an outlet for his 
violent nature: "I don't know why I'm like that. I always wanted to start 
fights. I always thought I had to be a little tougher than the other kids. I 
still have this violent thing in me. I've learned to control it -- to a large 
degree. But it's still there. I can get crazy at the drop of a hat." 
</P>
<P>
Although gang existence is behind him, Loc emphasized that he still has his 
share of vices. "I drink and I smoke weed (marijuana)," he said. "My mother 
knows it and as long as she knows it I don't care who else does. She doesn't 
approve, but that's life. . . . But I don't do any hard-core drugs." 
</P>
<P>
Loc attributes his exit from gang life largely to the influence of his first 
love. "I was about 17 or 18 and I was so in love with this girl," he recalled. 
"She didn't like me being in a gang. She said it was too dangerous. I'd be in 
fights. I was even shot once. But I didn't want to lose her, so I got out." 
</P>
<P>
Now Loc lectures at high schools on the evils of gang life. "I tell them 
there's a world outside of gangs," he said. "I tell them they don't have to 
hang out with gangs and be fighting and shooting each other. There's honest 
ways to make money -- like rapping. You can make a ton of money and still be 
cool -- like me."

L.A. BEAT: A RENEWED WAVE ON THE CLUB SCENE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You hate to use a word like this too lightly, but it looks like a 
r-e-n-a-i-s-s-a-n-c-e might be starting in the local club scene -- at least the 
local funky, casual alternative music club scene. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how or why, but it seems to be happening," said Jack Marquette, 
who is booking the shows for the newly reopened Al's Bar in downtown L.A., one 
of several new or revived clubs that has a stated commitment to cultivating an 
active local music and art community. 
</P>
<P>
Other clubs include the Gaslight (a self-described "dive" in Hollywood that has 
flowered lately after a year of hosting rock and acoustic acts), King King 
(newly opened at 467 S. La Brea Ave.) and the soon-to-debut China Club (at the 
Argyle and Selma site of the punk-era Cathay De Grande). 
</P>
<P>
Add to the list the always intriguing Lhasaland and the revitalized (i.e., 
enlarged capacity after hassles with the L.A. city fire authorities were 
finally resolved) Club Lingerie, and local club life definitely seems to be on 
the upswing. 
</P>
<P>
Marquette believes this sudden flurry of openings is largely coincidental -- 
Al's only recently corrected the fire law problems that had kept it shut for 
more than a year. But, he said, these clubs wouldn't be in business if the 
climate wasn't right. 
</P>
<P>
"The new talent out there is exploding," he said, comparing the current 
atmosphere to that of the old punk/new wave days, which produced the likes of 
the Germs, X, the Blasters and the Go-Gos. "I don't see any distinct musical 
directions, but I see a lot of people groping for something. . . . It might be 
too soon to say, but I do feel a sense of grass-roots emergence like 10 years 
ago." 
</P>
<P>
Gaslight manager Doug White has noticed the same thing. "Oh yes, definitely," 
he said. "There's much more of a community now than a year ago." 
</P>
<P>
Most encouraging -- and potentially most exciting -- are the informal 
anything-can-happen nights each club is planning. The Gaslight will continue to 
hold Tuesday jam nights and casual Sunday programs, while Al's Bar has 
reinstated its old notorious Thursday "No Talent" nights. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Debbie Patino (one of the Ringling Sisters), who until recently had 
been booking the shows at the Gaslight, plans to continue at other locales the 
kind of shows she'd been doing ay the Gaslight. Her first priority is the 
ultra-casual acoustic "Seventh Day" Sunday events she and Katie Childe had 
established at the Hollywood bar, which for the time being will float from club 
to club. First up is a show tonight at the Music Machine with Sylvia Juncosa, 
Mike Martt, the Nymphs and the Screamin' Sirens, plus a package of underground 
films. IN MEMORIAM: On Tuesday, Coconut Teaszer in Hollywood will host its 
second of three memorials for singer Bobbi Bratt, who died of stomach cancer 
Nov. 30 at age 26. Bratt was considered one of L.A.'s most promising 
rock/blues/rockabilly artists and was reportedly nearing a major-label deal 
before she became ill. 
</P>
<P>
Among the bands scheduled to perform are TSOL, Legal Weapon, Kommunity FK, the 
Shielas and Primal Pet (featuring members of Bratt's old punk band, Red Scare). 
Club music booker Len Fagen said also that there may be a red-hot surprise 
guest band. All proceeds raised that night, including money taken in at the bar 
and the door, will go toward the considerable medical and funeral expenses 
incurred by Bratt and her family. 
</P>
<P>
METALLURGY: Album title of the week: "Dirty Rotten Filthy Stinking Rich," the 
Columbia debut from the locally popular hard rock band Warrant. . . . Junkyard 
is finishing up its Geffen debut with Tom Werman producing. Mixing should be 
done by February and a spring release is projected. . . . Guitar-synth folk 
rockers Human Drama, newly signed to RCA, are heading for Great Britain to 
record its first EP with producer Ian Brody. . . . 
</P>
<P>
More signings: Shark Island to Epic -- the Sunset Strip rockers will start 
recording their first record for the label within a couple of weeks. And CBS 
has reportedly signed Love/Hate to a six-figure deal. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Cathouse proprietor Riki Rachtman has formed Heart of Chrome, a band featuring 
himself as lead vocalist. He's joined in the line-up by Jeff Johnson, former 
bassist of Nashville's Jason and the Scorchers. 
</P>
<P>
BUZZWORDS: The Jeff Dahl Group is releasing an album titled "Vomit Wet Kiss" 
that includes tunes that had been scheduled for its "I Kill Me" album, which 
was supposed to have come out last year on the now-defunct PVC label. Four of 
the songs feature former Dead Boy Cheetah Chrome. The group is releasing it on 
its own Sympathy for the Record Industry label. Dahl, a founder of the 
speed-metal pioneer Powertrip, also reports that the graphically illustrative 
T-shirt promoting the EP has already gotten the group banned from several clubs 
around the country. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Dramarama has regrouped after a brief hiatus and will begin recording a new 
album next month. Among the tracks slated for the third album by the 
transplanted Jersey rockers is a cover of Mott the Hoople's "Wish I Was Your 
Mother." . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Clints, four guys who all go by the name of Clint in honor of a certain 
tough-guy actor and former mayor of Carmel (call them up and they invariably 
say, "Hello, this is Clint"), makes its album debut March 1 with "No Place Like 
Home" on Skyclad records. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Local country mainstays Ronnie Mack and Rosie Flores have teamed up to record a 
single of the old Everly Brothers hit "Brand New Heartache." The record is out 
on the independent Lonesome Town Records. Another new country single is "Too 
Damn Bad" by the Trailer Park Casanovas, produced by "Town South of 
Bakersfield" organizer Dan Fredman.

FIRE SALE: Los Angeles' eager fire marshalls struck again last weekend at the 
Palomino Club, where Joe Ely was barely 30 minutes into his headline set when a 
squadron of fire inspectors shut down the club for the night, citing an 
overcapacity crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Though Ely fans were peeved by the abrupt closure, Palomino owner Billy Thomas 
acknowledged that the marshalls were faithfully executing their duties. 
"Technically, it's my fault," he said. "They claimed the aisles weren't clear, 
which they weren't. The aisle along the bar was jammed. We have a separate 
patio area, which adds to our capacity limit, but we can't keep people out in 
the patio once the show begins. It just gets too ugly. Once Ely went on, the 
crowd just ran inside and charged the stage." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said he had asked that an employee make an announcement from the stage, 
but as his orders were being relayed, the head fire inspector arrived. "He took 
one look and called his people in. I'd prefer to see them give us an 
opportunity to clear the aisles before they close us down, but they just rush 
in and get it over with." Unfortunately, it's the fans who suffer. Thomas 
doesn't give refunds, though he said he does offer disgruntled patrons passes 
to their choice of upcoming shows at the club. The Palomino's official capacity 
is 299, which expands to nearly 500 when patio attendance is included.

POP EYE: SIGNS OF CHANGE AT BILLBOARD MAGAZINE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK GOLDSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For years, Billboard magazine has been the music industry's bible, offering a 
strong, independent voice in its coverage of the record business. Whenever 
industry observers cite the progress of a new album, they draw from the 
Billboard charts. 
</P>
<P>
But is the pop trade magazine in danger of losing some of its editorial 
freedom? In other words, could advertisers influence what Billboard will 
publish? 
</P>
<P>
Some industry insiders have already begun to wonder after reading Xeroxed 
copies of a recent two-page internal commentary sent to Billboard staffers by 
Group Publisher John Babcock Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Largely devoted to encouraging more cooperation between the magazine's 
editorial and advertising staffs, Babcock's vaguely-worded memo suggests: 
</P>
<P>
* That Billboard's editorial staff should be "habitually querying" its ad sales 
people -- "they have info on new products, marketing strategies and people." 
</P>
<P>
* That activities at the largest record companies whould get more play than the 
same activities at smaller companies. But "when there's a difficult choice to 
be made on the same subject, I say the advertiser gets the call." 
</P>
<P>
* That its editorial staff "should react positively to sales requests . . . Ad 
Sales needs to be able to show an advertiser by example that for the right 
story they can help communicate it to Editorial with positive results." 
</P>
<P>
* That with the magazine's ad sales being off over the past year, "we need to 
take care not to assume a we-they attitude. For without Editorial and 
Advertising constantly acknowledging and listening to each other we miss 
opportunities and alienate revenue sources." 
</P>
<P>
Babcock makes it clear he is firmly opposed to any "quid pro quo stance" 
between ad and editorial staffs. And according to several Billboard columnists 
and writers, they are very rarely -- if ever -- under pressure to pull punches 
with their coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Still, some industry observers say the magazine has rarely taken the lead on 
reporting such controversial industry issues as independent promotion 
investigations or MCA's alleged involvement with mob figure Sal Pisello -- 
issues which received far more coverage in trade papers like Daily Variety and 
the Hollywood Reporter. 
</P>
<P>
Others disagreed. "Considering how many times I've had to call and complain 
about the slant of certain stories I wouldn't say Billboard has gotten any 
softer," said MCA Records sr. vice president Larry Solters. "We still in get 
fights over the way they cover stories." 
</P>
<P>
Babcock was in France and could not be reached for comment. However, John 
Babcock Sr., Billboard's vice president of corporate communications, insisted 
there had been "positively no change" in Billboard's editorial policy. 
</P>
<P>
"Billboard doesn't give advertisers any preferential treatment. In fact, we've 
probably bent over backwards too far the other way, with our editorial staff 
having absolutely no contact with the advertising side. I think John's just 
trying to remedy that by encouraging better communications between editorial 
and sales. Billboard has always called it the way we see it. We did a lot of 
hard reporting on (legal problems involving veteran industry exec) Morris Levy 
and the industry came down on us like a ton of bricks." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the memo's recommendation that in certain instances "the advertiser 
gets the call," Babcock Sr. replied: "I can see where that could be 
misinterpreted, but I think John just wants to create better harmony between 
the editorial and ad staffs."

LOOKING FOR A FINE KETTLE OF FISH SOUP; 
</P>
<P>
L.A. MAY NOT OFFER A GREAT BOUILLABAISSE, BUT THE ALTERNATIVES CAN BE VERY GOOD

You can't buy a good bouillabaisse in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
If you've a mind to, you can undoubtedly make a completely satisfactory version 
at home in your own kitchen, but weeks of tasting bouillabaisse in various 
restaurants failed to turn up a single one worthy of the name. 
</P>
<P>
And there are plenty of dishes that go by the name. Some older restaurants have 
served bouillabaisse for years, and many newer restaurants, cashing in on the 
cachet of Mediterranean cuisine, have put it on their menus. But every time 
I've tried the dish in local restaurants, it has not been the supernal soup of 
Marseille. 
</P>
<P>
There, waiters arrive at your table carrying a tray filled with various cooked 
fish that are only hours out of the water. These they bone, surround with a few 
pieces of potato and put in a bowl. Then a broth made of tomatoes, fish stock, 
olive oil and spices -- the high note of saffron singing out over the rest -- 
is added to the bowl. Finally the waiter places a bowl of croutons on the 
table, followed by another heaped with bright red rouille, and a third filled 
with grated cheese. 
</P>
<P>
In Marseille, bouillabaisse in a good restaurant means hours of happy eating; 
in Los Angeles it generally means a rather sad interview with a tired stew 
filled with tough fish. 
</P>
<P>
But although you may not find bouillabaisse worthy of the name in Los Angeles 
restaurants, you will find plenty of wonderful fish soups that do not even 
aspire to the name. Not one of the following soups calls itself a bouillabaisse 
-- but there's not one that wouldn't be cheered in Marseille. 
</P>
<P>
Fish soup at Spago is a wonderful broth the exact color of a good 
bouillabaisse. Perfectly poached pieces of salmon, shrimp and delicate slices 
of scallop give you little bits to bite into. The well-toasted bread (this is 
important if it is not to get too soggy) adds further textural interest. There 
is even a great dollop of garlicky rouille spooned over the soup. It may not be 
bouillabaisse, but if there's one soup I've eaten in a restaurant recently that 
makes you understand why people are so crazy over Provencal fish soup, this is 
it. Not big enough to be more than the introduction to a meal, the soup costs 
$8.50 a bowl; it's worth it. Fish soup at Trattoria Angeli in West Los Angeles 
comes in a great big bowl; it's meant to be an entire meal. And it is. There is 
a fine subtle broth, clear in flavor and texture, amply filled with mussels, 
shrimp, clams, and salmon. This soup also has a hunk of well-toasted bread 
floating about in it. This delicate soup is nothing like bouillabaisse, but 
seafood fans will find it extremely satisfying. It costs $15.50. 
</P>
<P>
Fish soup at Le Dome on the Sunset Strip arrives in a tall, footed bowl. With 
its clear, fresh flavors, I think it's just about the best thing on the menu. 
Like bouillabaisse, the soup comes with rouille, little toasts and grated 
cheese. It is certainly too small to make an entire meal of, but at $6.50 a 
bowl you might consider ordering a couple. 
</P>
<P>
Fish soup at City Restaurant on La Brea is flavorful, but fairly thin. It has a 
definite Provencal zing -- down to the dab of rouille that has been spooned 
into the middle. The last time I had it, the soup was filled with rice, 
vegetables and disconcerting slices of zucchini. One of those thin, crusty 
loaves that the French call ficelle was served on the side, adding to the 
Mediterranean appeal of the soup, which costs $4.50 a bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Fish soup at DC 3 in Santa Monica comes in two styles. There is cioppino, the 
San Francisco version of bouillabaisse. But even better is the Chilean sea bass 
in a stunningly simple broth redolent of saffron. The fish itself -- a big 
buttery chunk -- has all the freshness of flavor that I associate with a true 
bouillabaisse. At $6 a bowl this is not a meal -- but it certainly is a good 
beginning. 
</P>
<P>
Fish soup at Pazzia on La Cienega is a real meal. You get a bowl filled with so 
much fish and so much bread to catch the juice on the bottom that there is 
barely any broth. The flavors are strong, mingling the heady perfume of 
parsley, tomatoes and garlic with that of lots of seafood. In addition to 
little squares of fish there are shrimp and whole fistfuls of Manila clams. The 
soup, not always on the menu, is $15. 
</P>
<P>
Fish soup at Tribeca in Beverly Hills takes its name not from the Mediterranean 
but from the East Coast. They call it Montauk seafood stew -- but with its 
heady broth of tomatoes, garlic, white wine and fennel, it tastes as if its 
origins had more to do with the Mediterranean than the Atlantic. This one, with 
its harvest of fish, clams and mussels, is a major meal. It costs $18. 
</P>
<P>
Fish soup in New Orleans is called seafood gumbo -- and it's got a history as 
rich as that of bouillabaisse. With its base of onion, garlic, herbs and broth, 
the soup even bears a certain similarity to its Provencal cousin. 
</P>
<P>
The seafood gumbo at Orleans in West Los Angeles, a zesty mixture of rice and 
roux with handfuls of shrimp, crawfish and fish thrown in for good measure, is 
among the most satisfying of soups. It costs $8.95 a bowl -- and will prove far 
more satisfying than one of the pallid versions of bouillabaisse you'll find 
around town.

WHEN CHINATOWN JUST ISN'T BIG ENOUGH: EATING ASIAN IN THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It used to be that when you wanted Chinese in Los Angeles you headed to 
Chinatown. Then Monterey Park became the ne plus ultra for those seeking 
authenticity. Lately, some of its surrounding neighbors -- suburbs like 
Alhambra and San Gabriel and Rosemead, which stretch directly east from 
downtown along the edges of Interstate 10 -- have begun to rival the prominence 
of Monterey Park, making the San Gabriel Valley home to a virtual Chinese 
restaurant dynasty. 
</P>
<P>
But there is more than Chinese food in these parts. Talented Asian chefs from 
around the world are flocking to the area. Now it's possible to have good and 
authentic Filipino, Thai, Indonesian, Japanese, Vietnamese, even Taiwanese food 
without once stepping west of the L.A. River. 
</P>
<P>
Valley Boulevard is the equivalent of Restaurant Row in the San Gabriel Valley. 
Many of the best and most interesting Asian restaurants lie on it or in 
proximity to it. Here you will find cuisines from everywhere in Asia: small, 
medium-sized, and large restaurants of every shape and color. There are so many 
Asian restaurants in the San Gabriel Valley, in fact, that it's possible to 
sample a different country's cuisine every day for a week and not make a dent 
in the local restaurant scene. But that didn't stop me from trying. 
</P>
<P>
Day One 
</P>
<P>
We start the week Hong Kong-style with a dim sum lunch -- what else would you 
expect at a restaurant called DS? 
</P>
<P>
What makes this place unique is the health consciousness of the owner, Cindy 
Sun, who is also a doctor. Sun has done away with the traditionally oil- and 
sugar-packed recipes of classic dim sum, and in their place substituted dishes 
that the AMA would positively swoon over. Fun gor are little pockets of pliant 
rice flour dough filled with tiny peas, minced shrimp and spicy pork. The 
restaurant's char siu bao, comforting steamed buns with a saucy stuffing, may 
be the area's best -- not at all sticky, and brimming with lean, cubed pork. 
Har gow, tiny shrimp dumplings in see-through noodle jackets, are totally 
salt-free. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant is also open for dinner when one finds the usual Cantonese and 
other regional specialty dishes prepared with similar moderation. Seafood comes 
straight from a small but well-stocked tank. Peking duck is crisp and unusually 
lean. Shrimp in spicy sauce is a revelation. 
</P>
<P>
 DS Dim Sum House, 5612 N. Rosemead Blvd., San Gabriel; (818) 309-9918. Open 
daily from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Parking in lot. American Express, MasterCard, 
Visa accepted. Lunch for two, food only, $6-$12. 
</P>
<P>
Day Two 
</P>
<P>
We are in the Philippines, by way of a tiny, six-table operation called 
Pabling's Filipino Foods. Everything is amazingly cheap. Adobo, a soy- and 
vinegar-based stew with pork or chicken, has a sauce so good you'll want to lap 
up every bit of it. Fresh noodle dishes, such as pansit bihon (tiny rice 
noodles with minced meats and vegetables) are terrific. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the dishes here taste homemade, not like restaurant food at all. Lumpia 
sariwa, what many Filipinos call "fresh egg rolls" in English, are not deep 
fried at all, but rather lightly steamed egg roll skins with a meatless filling 
of mushroom, egg, cabbage, bean sprout and spinach. Filipinos like to dip the 
rolls in Chinese plum sauce, served on the side. I find them vastly superior to 
their deep-fried counterparts. Chicken mami is a bowl of thick noodles in rich 
broth, with stewed chicken hiding somewhere below. Mami would approve. 
</P>
<P>
Dessert is a must. Try the halo-halo: red date, lichee, grass jelly, young 
coconut and sliced jackfruit topped with vanilla ice cream and raspberry syrup. 
If that sounds too far out, you can always fall back on the excellent flan. 
</P>
<P>
 Pabling's Filipino Foods, 534 E. Valley Blvd., San Gabriel; (818) 280-5533. 
Open Mon.-Sat., 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Parking in lot. Cash only. Dinner for two, 
food only, $10-$15. 
</P>
<P>
 Day Three 
</P>
<P>
On Thursdays, Shinta Garden prepares an assortment of Indonesian munching 
snacks with names like lemper, pastel, and kroket. Lemper is a sticky rice roll 
filled with tender minced chicken that has been slowly cooked in coconut milk; 
it is one of the most intoxicating delights in all Asia. Pastel is similar to 
an empanada, a crusty, Dutch-influenced meat pie with fluted edges and an 
exotically spiced meat filling. Kroket are even more European, little chicken 
and pork croquettes served warm with a spicy sauce. 
</P>
<P>
With appetizers like these, you may never make it to the main courses. But if 
you do, there are several worth trying. Most popular is nasi rames, a rice 
plate with a variety of side dishes like ajam pedas, spicy barbecued chicken, 
rendang, beef stewed in coconut milk, and telur sambal, an egg curry. Gulai 
kambing is goat curry, a fiery hot version of the stuff, with a subtler, gamier 
flavor than its lamb counterpart. Bihun goreng are mouthwatering fried rice 
noodles mixed with pork and shrimp and then spiced with ground laos root, 
coriander and a touch of clove. Don't leave without trying one of those unusual 
iced desserts. Es kelapa muda, shredded young coconut drenched in a raspberry 
syrup, goes down the easiest. 
</P>
<P>
 Shinta Garden, 301 W. Valley Blvd., San Gabriel; (818) 284-7517. Open 
Wed.-Mon. 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Parking in lot. Cash only. Dinner for two, food 
only, $10-$15. 
</P>
<P>
Day Four 
</P>
<P>
Hungry for Japanese? The staff is Chinese at the elaborately designed Pine 
Garden, but never fear, both the chef and the outgoing sushi man are Tokyo 
natives. The restaurant, owned by a Taiwanese businessman, includes a cavernous 
dining room and an upstairs nightclub, but it's best to sit at the sushi bar, 
where the widest range of food is available. 
</P>
<P>
One of the sushi man's specialties is moriawae nigiri, mixed raw fish such as 
yellowtail, tuna and snapper sliced loaf-style on vinegared rice. Another is 
tiger's eye: cooked squid stuffed with salted salmon. His fine uni, sea urchin, 
and tobiko, flying fish roe, are served in little seaweed wrappers. 
</P>
<P>
Besides sushi, there is an enormous menu with huge portions to match. Tempura 
is particularly good. Unlike many tempura bars, Pine Garden chefs don't reuse 
oil in the frying process -- the difference is obvious. Hamazaki mushi (steamed 
clams in sake) is delightful, with a clean, natural taste. The various lunch 
boxes (available at dinnertime, too) are huge and diverse. After dinner you can 
follow the Japanese to the piano bar, or go upstairs with the Taiwanese and 
dance to a live band. 
</P>
<P>
 Pine Garden, 323 W. Valley Blvd., Alhambra; (818) 289-1000. Open daily, 5:30 
p.m. to midnight. All major cards. Parking in lot. Dinner for two, food only, 
$25-$50. 
</P>
<P>
Day Five 
</P>
<P>
Many modest family establishments in the area compete for the Taiwanese market, 
but I know of none better than Lee's Garden. The menu is on the wall, with 
Taiwanese dishes posted in Chinese characters. These dishes aren't translated, 
but you can ask the cashier to describe some of them for you (there is no 
waiter); he is very helpful. What you will find are specialty dishes quite 
unlike anything we know of as generic Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
 O-ah-jen, the oyster omelet with a glutinous rice flour bottom, is pure 
pleasure, blanketed with a sauteed Chinese green called tong au and a spicy red 
sauce. Ba wan is a sticky dumpling with bamboo shoot, black mushroom, and 
minced pork. Joong dze, a Chinese tamale, is sticky rice with a minced meat and 
vegetable filling. Lu danis is anise-flavored preserved egg. Oa gwey, a.k.a. 
bowl cake, has to be seen to be imagined. 
</P>
<P>
There's also a daily lunch special that at $2.95 is a steal. You get a plastic 
tray crammed with rice, pickle, green vegetables and at least two stewed or 
sauteed meats. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee's Garden, in the Alhambra Plaza, corner of Valley Blvd. and Atlantic 
Blvd., Alhambra; (818) 284-0320. Open Mon.-Sat. 11 a.m.-9 p.m. Parking in lot. 
Cash only. Lunch for two, food only, $7-$10. 
</P>
<P>
Day Six 
</P>
<P>
At Pho So 1, an always crowded San Gabriel watering hole, pho, the 
meal-in-a-bowl noodle soup, is done in style. Soulful Indochinese pop and 
excellent filter coffee are big draws here, too -- you can soak up culture 
while slurping your noodles. 
</P>
<P>
A giant sign proclaiming "Happy New Year" in English, Chinese and Vietnamese 
greets you as you enter, as does a tremendous blast of garlic and star anise. 
If understated flavors are one of your requirements for a good meal, this isn't 
your place. There are almost two pages of pho specialties, but I like to be 
adventurous and try some of the more unusual offerings. Lau luon bap chuoi (eel 
with banana buds) is one of the most outrageous dishes in California. It's 
almost sweet, and the eel has a mysteriously spicy aftertaste. De xao lan, 
cooked deer with curry, coconut and stewed onion, is another dish you won't 
find in the Midwest, but it's less exotic than you might think. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant has recently added bo 7 mon, the seven courses of beef which 
require a heifer-sized appetite, and there are the usual Vietnamese favorites 
as well. Cha gio, Vietnamese-style egg rolls with crab and glass noodle, are 
excellent. So is bi cuon, cold rice roll with pork, greens and bean sprout. 
</P>
<P>
 Pho So 1, 120 E. Valley Blvd., San Gabriel. (818) 571-7432. Open daily from 8 
a.m. to 10 p.m. Parking on street. Cash only. Lunch for two, food only, $8-$10. 
</P>
<P>
Day Seven 
</P>
<P>
Our last day, we've saved for Korea, a country with a much wider range of 
dishes than the tableside barbecue most Western diners are aware of. And 
despite its barbecue-dominant name, Manna Korean BBQ restaurant specializes in 
dishes found at all points on the spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
It's a well-appointed, cheerful place, with plush brown leather booths and silk 
floral arrangements just above them. On the tables are gas-powered barbecues 
used to prepare marinated short ribs, oxtail and other meats. But before you go 
for the burner, try the raw, seasoned crab, a wonderful appetizer flavored with 
red pepper and spring onion, which picks up where sashimi leaves off. Other 
appetizers you might try include seng sun jun, morsels of griddled cod in a 
light egg batter, and jap chae, glass noodles sauteed with mushrooms and finely 
minced pork. Hearty soups are wonderful here: Gom tang is a peppery tripe and 
beef soup. Gal bi chim is stewed spare ribs with various condiments. Gom tang 
is a chicken broth with egg and oblong shaped rice cake. And yes, if you must 
have it, the barbecue is great. Bulgogi, flank steak cut into leaf like slices, 
is best when washed down with icy drafts of OB, the house beer from Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Manna Korea BBQ Restaurant, 2101 San Gabriel Blvd., Rosemead; (818) 307-5671. 
Open daily 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Parking in lot. MasterCard and Visa accepted. 
Dinner for two, food only, $25-$40.

NOTEBOOK: SHAIN'S DOESN'T LIKE THE SOUND OF SHANE'S -- AND SUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLMAN ANDREWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gerard Izard and Michael Kurland thought they'd found the perfect name for 
their Beverly Glen hilltop restaurant. "We named it Shane, after the famous 
Alan Ladd movie," Izard said, "partly because we were going to do Southwestern 
food and partly as kind of a joke, because at the end of the movie, the boy 
calls, 'Come back, come back' -- and we thought, well, maybe people will come 
back here." 
</P>
<P>
What they say they didn't know at the time was that there was already another 
Shain's, albeit with a different spelling, not far away in Sherman Oaks. If you 
were to walk into the two restaurants, you could see right away that the two 
are not related: The Bel-Air Shane's, designed by Barbara Lazaroff of Spago and 
Chinois on Main fame, serves Southwestern specialties with an Italian accent 
(or maybe vice versa), and has quickly become famous for its high-powered 
Spago-style celebrity clientele. On the other hand, Shain's in Sherman Oaks, 
run by restaurateur Don Shain, is a Continental restaurant that has been in 
operation for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
These differences in both spelling and concept haven't stopped Don Shain from 
worrying that people in the area are mixed up about the two restaurants. He has 
filed suit against the owners of Shane. (The full name is Shane Hidden on the 
Glen.) According to Jane Harman of Freeman &amp; Sutton, the public relations 
agency that represents Shain's, the suit "claims that Shane chose the 
same-sounding name with the intent and result of creating confusion among the 
Ventura Boulevard restaurant's customers and potential customers as to a 
possible connection between the two eateries." Don Shain, Harman continued, 
"seeks not only an injunction against the continued use of the name Shane, but 
substantial monetary damages as well." 
</P>
<P>
"We were very surprised to hear about the suit," Izard responded. "At the time 
(we named the restaurant), we didn't even know that this other place existed." 
Izard said that he plans to fight the suit, "because we think we're right." 
</P>
<P>
"Besides," Izard added, "we don't even have the same area code." 
</P>
<P>
SERPENTS WITH A SMILE: By the Chinese way of reckoning, Monday, Feb. 6 is New 
Year's Day -- the beginning of the year 4687, or the Year of the Serpent. 
Previous serpent years this century have been 1905, 1917, 1929, 1941, 1953 and 
1965; famous recent Snake people have included Greta Garbo, Princess Grace and 
both John F. Kennedy and Jacqueline Onassis. As usual, a number of local 
Chinese restaurants plan special banquets to celebrate the holiday. Among 
these, Tse Yang in Los Angeles serves a lavish $45 per-person prix-fixe dinner 
Feb. 6-9. . . . King Dragon in Beverly Hills asks $35 a head for its New Year's 
feast served Feb. 5-6 (and with six you get roast suckling pig). . . . Hoy Toy 
in Sherman Oaks starts early and continues late, offering its own New Year's 
banquet, priced at $25 per couple, Feb 3-14. . . . And Madame Wu in Santa 
Monica offers a traditional Peking Snake, er, Duck dinner for $29.95 per person 
Feb. 6-8. 
</P>
<P>
WINING AND DINING: Gilliland's in Santa Monica matches Italian food with the 
wines of Flora Springs at a special dinner at 6 tonight for $55 per person. . . 
. Cafe Pierre in Manhattan Beach features wines from Trefethen and a 
five-course menu tomorrow, at $45 a head. . . . If you want to make it three in 
a row, Floreale in the Ramada Renaissance Hotel in Long Beach pours McDowell 
Valley wines with a six-course dinner on Tuesday. Tariff is $55.

THOSE WILD AND WONDERFUL SPORTSCASTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The point about TV sportcasters in Los Angeles is not whether the new, yuppie 
wiseguys are better or worse than the old-style, straight-news types: It's that 
all the sportscasters are inconceivably bad ("Send In the Clowns" by Steve 
Weinstein, Jan. 22). 
</P>
<P>
The Jim Hill/Stu Nahan types are dull, and they indulge in ex-jock cronyism 
with endless marshmallow interviews with their buddies. Plus they never ask the 
tough questions. 
</P>
<P>
The yuppie wiseguys such as Fred Roggin and Keith Olbermann never ask the tough 
questions either. Instead we get bad jokes and, in Olbermann's case, a snide, 
ugly, superior attitude we all remember from our undergraduate days. 
</P>
<P>
Roggin is basically a Roy Firestone clone with his interminable "humorous" 
video clips. 
</P>
<P>
Yet none of these guys presents a threat to local TV news departments. Their 
clowning is harmless, because nobody takes L.A.'s happy-news, 
personality-driven news teams seriously anyway.

A BROTHER IN SPIRIT

<TEXT>
<P>
I was moved by the story on Christopher Nolan, the young Irish author and 
playwright ("A Body Bound, An Imagination Soaring Free," by Frances Haines, 
Jan. 22). 
</P>
<P>
There are remarkable similarities between Nolan and another author from Dublin, 
Christy Brown. 
</P>
<P>
How could the article omit reference to Brown in light of the fact that Haines 
writes that Nolan "wonders what happened to people like him before now"? 
</P>
<P>
As a result of being born with cerebral palsy, Brown was unable to walk, talk 
or feed himself unaided, and he never went to school. He had the use of only 
his left foot. Using the little toe of that foot he typed his excellent novel 
"Down All the Days." (The New York Times called him a genius.) 
</P>
<P>
What has become of Brown, I do not know; I hope he is well. 
</P>
<P>
As for Mr. Nolan's wonderings, I can only tell you that I came across a copy of 
Brown's novel at a book store recently; it was in a sales bin . . . 99 cents.

 An L.A. Times story last March noted the similarities of Nolan and Brown, one 
of 22 children of a Dublin slum family. "Down All the Days," published in 1970, 
was an international best seller that earned the author $370,000. At age 49, in 
1981, Brown choked to death as he and his wife ate dinner at home in Britain. 
He died on Christopher Nolan's birthday.

According to Hilburn, at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame there is a 60% chance

ART DECO GLASSWARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM BURCHELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ART DECO WAS an international style that flourished in the years between the 
two world wars. The style dominated architecture and interior decor, the design 
of fabrics, porcelain, jewelry, glassware, even haute couture. For the past 
decade, Art Deco has been enjoying an impressive retro-popularity. 
</P>
<P>
Like so much else in the history of art, decor and fashion, the style came to 
light in France. In 1925, the Exposition des Arts Decoratifs et Industriels 
Modernes, originally planned for 1914, opened in Paris. Coming at a time when 
art nouveau dominated ideas of decoration and design, the style, with its 
streamlined and geometric forms, looked to the future. Yet it was firmly based 
in the early 20th Century. Much of its furniture and decorative arts derived 
from the designs of the Wiener Werkstate, founded in 1903, its colors from the 
Ballets Russes of 1909, and its line and architecture from Cubism and the 
geometrics of the Bauhaus of 1919. Art Deco may have emerged during the giddy 
years of the 1920s, but it was a serious attempt (and the last made in Europe) 
to develop a coherent and lasting decorative style that would apply in all 
areas of design. 
</P>
<P>
Glassware is one area of the decorative arts of the period that has never lost 
its popularity. And there is more to its appeal than simple nostalgia, for Art 
Deco glass has a massive opulence and a sophisticated thrust that are 
fashionable today. The finest French work is the pate de verre and other fired 
products by Decorchemont, and the extremely rare blown and sculpted glass by 
Maurice Marinot. More popular, and more readily available, is molded glass 
(vases, glasses, lamps) by Rene Lalique and the Daum Freres of Nancy. Lalique's 
work, in particular, has a strong Art Deco signature -- from the great glass 
fountain he created for the 1925 exposition in Paris and commissions for the 
ocean liner Normandie to the many perfume bottles he made for firms such as 
Coty and the striking hood ornaments he produced for luxury automobiles. Art 
Deco glasswork, of course, was not a French monopoly. There were the Leerdam 
Co. in Holland, among others, Orrefors in Sweden, Steuben and Corning in the 
United States and Stuart &amp; Sons and Thomas Webb in England. 
</P>
<P>
Paradoxically, the Art Deco style seen in the work of masters such as Lalique 
in glass, Clarice Cliff in ceramics and Ruhlmann in furniture is at once modern 
and comfortably old-fashioned -- old-fashioned in the sense that the materials 
used are luxurious and the handcraftsmanship exquisite. The charm lies in a 
combination of the futuristic and the luxurious. It is rather like traveling 
under the ocean in the Nautilus with Captain Nemo. 
</P>

Mano in Brentwood; Beaded Bird in Venice; Sherman Oaks Antique Mall in Sherman

LA CONICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LASKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YES, THERE IS something laconic about La Conica, the copper- bottomed, 
stainless-steel espresso coffee maker with a lid that resembles the Tin Man's 
conical helmet from "The Wizard of Oz." Introduced in 1984, Milanese architect 
Aldo Rossi's design was an instant classic. As an architect, Rossi talks more 
than he builds. But he's become a household name in design-conscious circles 
for his filter and espresso coffeepots and percolators, including La Conica's 
"male" counterpart, a tea kettle named Il Conico (1986). They're all 
manufactured by the Italian firm Alessi, the people who brought you kettles by 
Michael Graves (with the bird whistle) and Richard Sapper (with a musical 
whistle). What distinguishes Rossi's creation from the others is its sense of 
monumentality -- remarkable in such a small object -- deriving from his use of 
simple elements: a cylinder, a cone and the little ball on top. 
</P>
<P>
Those geometric forms also pay homage in a pithy (or, to use Rossi's pun, 
laconic) way to the painter Giorgio de' Chirico, whose surrealist canvases 
painted in the 1920s Rossi acknowledges as a major influence. Very fashionable 
now (they've even motivated advertising-agency art directors), these gloomy 
scenes bear evocative titles such as "The mystery and melancholy of the 
street," and typically depict endless bare arcades, punctuated by a lonely 
tower. 
</P>
<P>
That proverbial de' Chirico tower got under Rossi's skin. It inspired, for 
instance, his famous Teatro del Mondo, a small floating theater for the 1979 
Venice Biennale that became a key building in the postmodern movement. In turn, 
Rossi's tower stimulated similar efforts by other big-name architects such as 
Michael Graves (the light monitors of his San Juan Capistrano Library) and 
Barton Myers (the Cerritos Performing Arts Center, under construction). Now 
Alessi has seemingly taken those de' Chirico-ancestored towers, put them in a 
sci-fi reducing machine and placed them on our breakfast tables. 
</P>
<P>
 La Conica is available at Details, the Museum of Contemporary Art Book Store, 
and Lynne Deutch Limited in Los Angeles; Zero Minus Plus in Santa Monica, and 
Pannikin in San Diego.

GRAFFEO COFFEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH REICHL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GRAFFEO COFFEE HAS been an institution in San Francisco's North Beach for 40 
years, a simple storefront dominated by enormous burlap bags of coffee beans. 
You can smell the coffee roasting for blocks away, and that scent draws you 
inexorably to the door where there is always a line of people waiting to buy 
coffee. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the coffee in fancier emporiums, Graffeo coffee comes in only three 
varieties: dark roast, light roast and decaffeinated. All varieties are 
excellent; Graffeo's location is not the only reason that North Beach's famous 
coffeehouses buy coffee here. 
</P>
<P>
Fans of Graffeo coffee were thrilled when the company decided to open a 
Southern California outpost, although perhaps a little puzzled when it was 
announced that the shop was moving into Beverly Hills. In contrast to the San 
Francisco store, the Beverly Hills Graffeo Coffee Roasting is an incredibly 
classy place: You buy your coffee across a counter far too elegant for the 
original store. But there are still stacks of burlap bags of coffee beans 
waiting to be roasted, and there's still that unmistakeable Graffeo aroma. Best 
of all, it's the same wonderful coffee -- the kind that makes people who think 
they don't like the stuff ask for a second cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Graffeo Coffee Roasting, 315 N. Beverly Drive, Beverly Hills; telephone (213) 
273-0817. Roasted coffee is $7.50 a pound, decaffeinated $8.50.

WALL STREET JOHN CRUDELE: HAAS SCANDAL TAKING TOLL ON INVESTORS BIG AND SMALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By John Crudele, JOHN CRUDELE is a financial columnist for New York magazine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Pauline (as we'll call her) met an executive of Haas Securities at a 
dinner party in 1984, she considered herself well off. Still, she felt that her 
portfolio wasn't getting the necessary attention, and she had recently lost 
money in a Keogh account at Shearson Lehman. So Pauline decided to turn over 
all of her money -- about $185,000 -- to Haas. She even persuaded her elderly 
parents to give Haas $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
The accounts seemed to grow and, at one point, Haas told Pauline her account 
was worth more than $300,000. Her parents' had grown as well. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Pauline not only is broke -- but owes $40,000. She says it is because of 
unauthorized and fraudulent trading in her account by Haas. Her parents are 
$300,000 in debt. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know what was going on. I trusted this guy," Pauline says. "People 
much more sophisticated than I am were involved in this and lost money." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. John Cogan of Houston was contacted over the phone by a Haas representative 
in late 1983. After one face-to-face meeting, Dr. Cogan invested $200,000. 
Cogan says he never heard from the representative again. When he tried to call 
Haas' office in Houston a year later, he found it had been shut down. No one in 
the New York office would return Cogan's calls. 
</P>
<P>
Both Cogan and Pauline are suing Haas, which was a small but seemingly 
legitimate brokerage that was a market maker (whose official role was to keep 
trading orderly) in 73 over-the-counter securities until it went bankrupt after 
the crash. What was really going on at Haas -- and why as many as 3,000 
investors may have lost money -- is now unfolding. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley Aslanian Jr., the firm's 29-year-old former president, recently pleaded 
guilty to stock manipulation. He's also said to be cooperating in the 
prosecution of others. And investigators are now looking into whether Haas 
artificially drove up the price of five securities -- Big O Tires Inc., Cliff 
Engle Ltd., Flores de New Mexico, TS Industries and Fountain Power Boat 
Industries -- by trading illegally and disseminating false information about 
the firm. Sources familiar with the case say Haas may have been manipulating 
other stocks as well. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Aslanian, Frank Shannon, an investor, has been charged with filing 
false information with the government about TS Industries, for which Haas was a 
market maker. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators are moving quickly on the case, sources say, and they also report 
that the U.S. attorney and the FBI are widening the inquiry. Others say the 
Securities and Exchange Commission recently expanded its own probe and is 
issuing subpoenas. A grand jury is said to be looking at evidence now. "A lot 
of people are in trouble," says one source. 
</P>
<P>
That would include people who did business with Haas, as well as the possible 
involvement of a broker at E. F. Hutton &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
John Lang, attorney for Eugene Laff, former chairman of Haas, says that his 
client has answered questions in other investigations of Haas but that he has 
not been called before the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on Aslanian's guilty plea, it is clear to everyone, including Mr. Laff, 
that laws were violated," Lang says, adding that an investigation by the 
National Assn. of Securities Dealers concluded that Aslanian manipulated 
stocks. It also said Laff's only mistake was that he didn't adequately 
supervise Aslanian. 
</P>
<P>
If Laff is asked by the grand jury to appear, "at that point (he) will make up 
his mind whether it would be in his interest or in the interest of justice to 
testify," says Lang. 
</P>
<P>
James Davis, a lawyer for the trustee of Haas, has questioned certain trades by 
members of Laff's family, according to court documents. Davis refused to say 
whether he spoke to investigators about these trades. 
</P>
<P>
Lang says "friends, associates and relatives of Laff's" invested in some of the 
stocks recommended by Haas that they thought were good investments. "And for 
the most part, they had very substantial losses," says Lang. 
</P>
<P>
The possible involvement of Henry Lorin, a major investor in TS Industries, is 
also being looked at. A published report said Lorin was in a transaction with 
Shannon involving TS stock. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators are said to have heard evidence that 387,600 shares of TS 
Industries stock were bought from a broker at Hutton in July, 1987. This was 
before the firm merged with Shearson Lehman and about the same time, sources 
say, as Aslanian admits to manipulating the price of TS Industries stock. 
</P>
<P>
Insiders acknowledge that the Hutton broker -- who wasn't identified -- could 
be in trouble if his trades with Haas were intended to artificially drive up 
the price of TS Industries stock. 
</P>
<P>
Some people have also questioned the role of L. F. Rothschild &amp; Co., which 
handled the paper work for all of Haas' trades. In their bankruptcy filings, 
Haas officials charge that the brokerage was forced into bankruptcy shortly 
after the October, 1987, crash because Rothschild suddenly refused to accept 
its trades. 
</P>
<P>
At least one Haas customer has said she was told that Rothschild would not 
process sell orders from Haas customers after the crash unless they were 
accompanied by a comparably sized order to buy. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney for Rothschild says his client was a victim of Haas' alleged 
misconduct and is out $26 million as a result. 
</P>
<P>
How much did investors lose? Investigators estimate that more than $100 million 
in TS Industries alone was lost when the stock fell from its inflated pre-crash 
price of about $30 a share to its current price of 50 cents. "And that's just 
the one stock," says one person familiar with the case. "It gives you an idea 
of the money involved." 
</P>
<P>
What's going on with the dollar? "Everyone is worried about another October," 
says Peter Rona, head of IBJ Schroder, a subsidiary of the International Bank 
of Japan. "They're afraid of the thing tipping over." 
</P>
<P>
"The thing" is the stock market. "Everyone" is the central banks around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
Rona, who is an authority on world interest rates and is well connected with 
major central banks around the world, says the banks are concerned that a 
further weakening of the dollar will cause U.S. interest rates to go higher. 
</P>
<P>
Interest rates here are already high, thanks to the Fed's fight against 
inflation. Even lowly money-market accounts in the U.S. are paying 7.41% these 
days. While rates may have to go up if inflation gets worse, the authorities 
don't want to boost rates to prop up the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
Rona says that's why central banks, including the Federal Reserve, have been 
buying dollars lately in hopes of boosting their value. (Most recently, they've 
been selling dollars, but only because developments like the rise in oil prices 
appear to have overly strengthened the dollar.) 
</P>
<P>
Intervention can't keep the dollar strong for long, Rona says, though as long 
as the markets are in a good mood over the new Administration, they're likely 
to play along with the central banks. 
</P>
<P>
But once Bush's honeymoon with Congress is over, Rona says, trouble could 
start. 
</P>
<P>
Appearance, attitude and body language are more important in making a good 
first impression than what you say. Motivational Systems, a specialist in 
management development and sales training, says 72% of the 12,000 people 
surveyed said they were most influenced by non-verbal communications . . . 
</P>
<P>
Traders have been carefully watching the recent movement of Digital 
Communications stock, which has had one heck of a January. It's up about $5 a 
share in the past 16 days on four times the normal volume. There have been 
takeover rumors, but nothing specific enough to cause this type of activity . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
What people can't figure out is why the stock market went up last week after 
Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan threatened to raise interest rates to fight 
inflation. A jump in interest rates is always bad for stocks.

TIMES BOARD OF ECONOMISTS / DAVID M. GORDON: A WISH LIST FOR THE NEW CONGRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David M. Gordon, DAVID M. GORDON is a professor of economics at the New 
School for Social Research in New York. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So now we begin another four years of a Republican Administration in 
Washington. And another two years of a Democrat-controlled Congress. Will life 
go on as usual? Or will the Democrats in Congress finally challenge the 
economic policies that, over the past eight years, have produced mountainous 
debt, financial fragility and economic polarization? 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, at the beginning of the 100th Congress, I outlined in this 
column a checklist of eight critical issues the Democrats needed to confront to 
make a difference on the economy. I promised to "keep my ratings as the 100th 
congressional season unfolds." 
</P>
<P>
On a scale from 1 to 10, I would charitably give the Democrats a score of 2. 
They dilly-dallied, hemmed and hawed, shuffled their feet and hid their heads. 
They failed to launch major new initiatives on any of the eight issues I 
listed. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than reevaluate the last two years, however, I thou ght it might make 
more sense to update my list. Here are five issues, in alphabetical order, that 
are rarely discussed but on which we desperately need new initiatives. (This is 
only a partial agenda; some of the most neglected problems on a much longer 
list.) 
</P>
<P>
1. The Fed. I'm beginning to sound like a broken record on this one: Real 
interest rates remain very high by historical standards while debt burdens grow 
heavier and heavier. But the Federal Reserve Board, catering primarily to the 
interests of the financial community, is repeatedly allowed to win at the game 
of chicken, consistently refusing to moderate interest rates until and only 
after something is done about the federal deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Many liberal economists agree that we need a much better balanced mix between 
monetary policy and fiscal policy. But they continually refuse to raise 
questions about the political arrangements under which monetary policy is 
determined. Many European economies feature much closer coordination of fiscal 
and monetary policy than the United States. Here we deny ourselves the 
opportunity to achieve that kind of coordination. 
</P>
<P>
Restraining interest rates requires challenging the political independence of 
the Fed. Congress has the constitutional right to mandate the specific content 
of monetary policy and to establish the conditions of the Fed's relationship to 
the rest of the government. The issue for the new Congress is not whether to 
constrain the political independence of the Fed, but how. 
</P>
<P>
2. Junk speculation. Speculative fever continues to grip the financial 
community. The mania for leveraged buyouts shows little sign of abating. 
Instead of investing to improve the nation's productivity, junk hunters are 
investing to deepen our indebtedness. 
</P>
<P>
Since the freedom to choose your investments is considered one of the most 
sacred rights in capitalist economies, it's not easy to control these kinds of 
speculative epidemics. But there are some direct steps that Congress should 
pursue sooner than later: Lower real interest rates would help tip the scales 
away from speculative investments and back toward real productive investments. 
</P>
<P>
We could impose a sharp tax on gains from short-term transactions on securities 
and other related paper investments -- say on those paper assets held for less 
than six months or a year. And we could begin to limit tax deductibility on 
corporate interest payments incurred from leveraging equity purchases with 
ever-increasing debt. 
</P>
<P>
It's probably too late to undo much of the damage already done in the feverish 
'80s. But we should at least move quickly to prevent even more havoc with our 
corporate balance sheets and productive futures. 
</P>
<P>
3. Labor law reform. Labor unions are in crisis. While there is much to 
criticize about the sluggishness of trade union leadership, a vital labor 
movement remains an urgent priority for working people in this country -- and 
for nearly everyone else. Many studies continue to find, for example, that 
unions contribute to, rather than impede, rapid growth in productivity. 
</P>
<P>
And yet, the obstacles to workers' joining or forming labor unions are 
considerable. Surveys suggest that something like one-third of non-unionized 
workers, representing roughly 25 million to 30 million employees, would prefer 
to be represented by a union. The Labor Law Reform Act of 1978 proposed some 
sensible and reasonable reforms that would have at least partly reduced some of 
the barriers to unionization, but it was defeated as a result of vigorous 
opposition and lobbying by business groups, particularly by the Business 
Roundtable. 
</P>
<P>
Something like the 1978 proposals should be back on the floor of the Congress. 
We need a vigorous labor movement, and that requires labor law reform. 
</P>
<P>
4. The minimum wage. Politicians continue to succumb to the remarkable belief 
that low wages are good for the American economy. Quite to the contrary, we 
need desperately to promote more rapid wage growth. Families are being squeezed 
by declining real wages. And it is reasonable to argue, as I have suggested in 
earlier columns, that wage growth helps promote productivity growth by creating 
demand for products, stimulating more efficient use of available resources and 
providing workers with a real stake in the performance of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most immediate and practicable public policy tools for having at 
least some influence on wages, especially at the lowest tiers, is the statutory 
level of the minimum wage. The minimum wage has not been touched since 1980, 
remaining firmly lodged at $3.35 an hour, with its real purchasing power 
declining by more than one-third over that period. It looked as if the 
Democrats might finally summon enough courage to mandate a significant increase 
in the minimum wage toward the end of the last congressional session, but they 
backed off just before taking the plunge. This should be one of the first 
priorities of the new legislative session. 
</P>
<P>
5. "X" policy. Back in 1982-83, it appeared that the Democrats might be moving 
toward serious proposals for "industrial policy." But the term itself was 
quickly tainted and industrial policy proponents faded into the woodwork. 
</P>
<P>
We should forget about the labels. Let's call it "X" policy. What we need, 
whatever we call it, is a concerted and coherent set of government policies to 
improve the performance of U.S. industry and to smooth the transition of 
workers and firms from one industry to another. Almost all of our major trading 
competitors, which have been collectively slashing our tires in international 
competition, engage in such policies. We must join them. And soon. 
</P>
<P>
That's my checklist for the new Senate and House. I'll keep you posted. Based 
on our luck with the preceding Congress, I'm not going to hold my breath.

<P>
When the nation's governors gather in Washington next month for their annual 
winter meetings, they will be in an unaccustomed spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
The reason is 1990 reapportionment -- the decennial Super Bowl of American 
legislative politics. Following each census, state legislatures (subject to 
gubernatorial veto) draw the congressional and legislative districts that 
govern elections for the next 10 years. Their map-making, which establishes the 
partisan balance of each district, is as influential as any single factor in 
determining how many seats each party holds. Democratic control of state 
legislatures -- and thus reapportionment -- is the foundation of their enduring 
majority in the House of Representatives. When one party controls both the 
statehouse and the governorship, their freedom to gerrymander favorable 
districts can realign state politics overnight: Democratic dominance of the 
map-making process in California expanded the party's margin in the 
congressional delegation from one to 11 seats after the last reapportionment. 
</P>
<P>
The opportunity for creative cartography is greatest in states where 
reapportionment will change the congressional delegation's size; and almost all 
of the states either gaining (including California, Texas and Florida) or 
losing seats (most prominently New York, Pennsylvania and Illinois) will elect 
governors next year. Virginia, which is expected to gain a seat, and New 
Jersey, whose numbers will probably not change, are electing governors this 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
For the GOP in particular, the 36 gubernatorial races next year are crucial, 
because the party brings so few other cards to the reapportionment table. 
Without substantial gains, the Republicans face another Democratic-dominated 
reapportionment that will lock-in the Democrats' House majority through the end 
of the century. That's because the GOP's White House dominance hasn't trickled 
down into statehouse gains: The GOP holds fewer state legislative chambers 
today than in 1979, and less than one-third overall. Republicans must elect 
governors to offset these Democratic advantages. "We are going to get a lot 
more attention than ever before because of reapportionment," says Michele M. 
Davis, executive director of the Republi 
</P>
<P>
can Governors Assn. "We are going to get some heavy resources from the national 
(Republican) committee." 
</P>
<P>
This attention is somewhat new for the governors, whose travails in the 
boondocks have rarely moved Washington. With the exception of a few large-state 
governors, and the occasional rogue with a calling for larceny, state chief 
executives have typically served out their careers with as much fanfare as bank 
tellers. Nonetheless, powerful governors -- from Edmund G. (Pat) Brown in 
California to Nelson A. Rockefeller in New York -- transformed their states. 
It's a rewarding, comfortable job. Most get a state-maintained mansion, a 
police escort wherever they go and power to appoint hundreds of supporters to 
well-paying jobs -- instead of dozens senators and congressmen can satisfy. 
Senators can debate policy; governors make it. What they haven't been able to 
do -- until recently -- is influence national issues, even those that directly 
affect states. 
</P>
<P>
But governors have quietly grown up to a major role in the development of 
domestic policy. When Lyndon B. Johnson launched the War on Poverty 25 years 
ago, the underlying assumption was that Washington needed to fill the gap left 
by inert state governments. Now the reverse is true. With the federal budget 
deficit paralyzing Washington, governors in both parties have been forced to 
develop programs for coping with persistent domestic problems. Their ideas now 
bubble up to influence Congress. The movements to reform the nation's 
educational and welfare systems grew as much out of state initiatives as 
Capitol epiphanies. "It's a complete flip-flop of the imbalance that prevailed 
in the 1960s when nothing was happening at the state level," said former 
Arizona Gov. Bruce E. Babbitt. 
</P>
<P>
What have the states wrought? A politics of striking moderation -- an almost 
nonpartisan agenda that enlists the business Establishment behind traditional 
social programs such as education and assistance to young children by 
repackaging them as investments in economic growth. From Republicans such as 
Thomas H. Kean in New Jersey to Democrats like Arkansas' Bill Clinton, 
governors are now building their administrations on bland but sturdy bipartisan 
pillars: public-private partnerships to cope with social needs, increased 
funding for education and training, leveraging of limited public funds in other 
areas. This isn't the kind of politics that sends pulses racing -- ask Michael 
S. Dukakis -- but at the state level, at least, it is effective at producing 
policy and reelecting office-holders. 
</P>
<P>
The new approach has most dramatically affected Southern and Southwestern 
states where governors were previously judged by their success at narcotizing 
government. Across the Sun Belt, governors devoted themselves to promoting a 
"good business climate" -- a near mystical condition of corporate rapture that 
translates into few government services and low taxes. That worked when the Sun 
Belt's economy was built on brute low-wage manufacturing -- in the South -- and 
bountiful natural-resource industries -- in the Southwest and Rocky Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
But as foreign competition hammered the manufacturing base, and falling energy 
prices undermined the oil states' passive prosperity, innovative governors in 
these traditionally conservative states have redefined the good business 
climate. Even tightfisted business leaders now grudgingly accept the need for 
government to provide the infrastructure for economic growth: strong early 
educational facilities, research universities, roads, airports, ports. 
</P>
<P>
Stretching this new consensus to its limits, several governors in recent years 
have been willing to do what Washington hasn't: raise taxes to maintain 
services. Governors in states ranging from Michigan to Utah have won reelection 
despite major tax increases. In this budget year alone, four states raised 
income taxes, and another seven hiked sales taxes. In his reelection bid next 
year, Florida's Republican Gov. Bob Martinez, hurt badly by an early sales tax 
hike, will provide 1990's tightest test of that connection. 
</P>
<P>
The two most prominent exceptions to this trend toward more activist state 
government are the states that will probably be most fiercely contested next 
year: Texas and California. (Texas is expected to gain four congressional seats 
in 1990, second only to California, where the delegation will swell by at least 
five and maybe six seats.) Though retiring Texas Republican Gov. William P. 
Clements Jr. accepted a substantial tax hike to cover budget shortfalls, he 
hasn't launched aggressive programs to diversify the state's economy. In 
California, retiring Republican Gov. George Deukmejian's Reaganite resistance 
to government expansion has intensified the gridlock over mounting 
transportation, environmental and social needs: He has played the role of a 
traffic light stuck on red. 
</P>
<P>
These open-seat 1990 races may pivot on whether voters believe the next 
governor should expand his vocabulary beyond "no" -- even at the risk of 
raising some taxes. In Texas, the debate is likely to center on education, and 
some GOP strategists worry that Clements has left the party in a weak position. 
In California -- where anxiety about the quality of life is matched by 
skepticism about tax hikes -- the two parties are likely to fence over the 
state's role in funding not only education, but also transportation and 
environmental protection. 
</P>
<P>
Those kinds of personalized local concerns, not the polarizing ideological 
themes that dominate federal races, determine gubernatorial elections. On the 
surface, governor races may look like Senate and presidential races, with the 
same consultants hatching the same expensive -- and negative -- media campaigns 
that force candidates to spend ever more time dialing donors for dollars. 
</P>
<P>
But governor races have remained independent from larger trends in more 
fundamental ways. Despite George Bush's victory in the presidential campaign, 
the Democrats actually gained one governorship in 1988; two years earlier, when 
the Democrats gained eight Senate seats, they lost as many governorships. 
Because of the governors' influence over reapportionment, no races will be more 
important to the national parties in 1990. But no races will be less 
susceptible to their influence.

FUTURES TERRIBLE AND TERRIFIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Donella H. Meadows, Donella H. Meadows, an adjunct professor of 
environmental studies at Dartmouth College, was the principal author of The 
Limits to Growth.

<P>
As environmental problems make headlines again, people who remember "The Limits 
to Growth," a 1972 book, have been asking whether the "predictions" were right 
-- ozone hole, acid rain, greenhouse effect -- are these the limits to growth? 
</P>
<P>
"The Limits to Growth" was a report to the Club of Rome based on a computer 
model of global population and economic growth. It said, in essence, that the 
kinds and rates of physical growth the modern world is accustomed to cannot go 
on forever, or even very much longer. 
</P>
<P>
That message raised a surprising ruckus. My co-authors and I were attacked from 
the left, right and middle. The book was banned in the Soviet Union and 
investigated by President Nixon's staff. The Mobil Corp. ran ads saying "Growth 
Is Not a Four-Letter Word." Disciples of Lyndon LaRouche and the National Labor 
Caucus picketed our public appearances. Mainstream economists competed with one 
another to see who could write the most scathing reviews. 
</P>
<P>
Seventeen years later, the world population has risen from 3.6 billion to more 
than 5 billion. Tropical forest is being cut at a rate of 26 million acres per 
year (an area nearly the size of Pennsylvania). The rate of fossil fuel burning 
is 40% higher than it was 17 years ago, and the carbon dioxide released from 
that burning is deranging the chemical composition of the atmosphere. No one is 
sure how much soil has eroded, how much hazardous waste has been dumped, how 
much ground water has been polluted. 
</P>
<P>
So, are the predictions of "The Limits to Growth" coming true? No, because the 
book contained no predictions. It showed 12 different futures, all possible, we 
think, some terrible, some terrific. As we saw it then and see it now, the 
future is not cast in concrete, to be predicted; it is full of potential, to be 
chosen. "The Limits to Growth" was not about prediction. It was about choice. 
</P>
<P>
Choice is constrained by planetary laws, of course, and the book did say that 
some choices are physically impossible. Eternal expansion of the human economy 
is one of them. Trying to cram more and more people, homes, factories, 
croplands, vehicles, mines and dumps onto this finite planet will certainly run 
us into limits. 
</P>
<P>
There are many limits, environmental, economic, social. There is a limit to the 
amount of oil under the ground and a limit to the amount of carbon dioxide the 
atmosphere can hold before the planet warms, the seas rise and the climate 
changes. There is a limit to the amount of injustice people will tolerate. 
There is a limit to the ability of human beings to manage complex systems. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows precisely where the limits are or which ones come first. But we do 
understand something about how they work. That is what "The Limits to Growth" 
was about. It said: 
</P>
<P>
 -- One limit may be overcome by conservation, substitution, technical advance 
or regulation, but if growth continues, another limit will be encountered -- or 
the same one re-encountered. (Cutting pollution per tailpipe roughly in half 
while doubling the number of tailpipes adds up to no progress on air quality. 
Since 1972 Americans have spent $70 billion on sewage-treatment plants, but are 
emitting nearly the same amount of organic waste to streams, because sewage 
production has grown as fast as sewage treatment.) 
</P>
<P>
 -- If problems induced by limits are solved by sweeping them under the rug, 
into the water or soil or atmosphere, over to the poor or off to the future, 
those problems have not gone "away." They will come up again, somewhere, later, 
harder, often all at once. (High smokestacks transform local pollution into 
distant acid rain. Sludge that is barged farther out to sea just takes longer 
to wash back to shore. DDT banned at home but sold abroad comes back in coffee 
and other imports.) 
</P>
<P>
 -- An economy that depends heavily on non-renewable resources like fossil 
fuels, and that degrades renewable resources like soils and forests, is 
steadily lowering its limits to growth. 
</P>
<P>
 -- There are no clear signals to tell us where we stand relative to global or 
local limits. The signals are complex, noisy and delayed. (Last summer's 
drought could be greenhouse warming; it could also be just a dry year.) 
</P>
<P>
 -- Even if the signals were clear, we could not act on them quickly. (It took 
16 years from the first warning of atmospheric ozone depletion to the first 
international agreement curtailing ozone-depleting pollutants. It will take 10 
years to implement the agreement fully. At that point we will begin to know 
whether we curtailed enough.) 
</P>
<P>
In short, it is as if we were driving our economy toward a set of barriers an 
unknown distance ahead. We can't see clearly, and we can't brake quickly. There 
is nothing about our price system, technology, forecasting ability or political 
wisdom that will guarantee a soft landing. Quite the contrary, they are all 
encouraging us to accelerate. What we need to do instead, said "The Limits to 
Growth," is slow down. 
</P>
<P>
That message offends conventional wisdom, but I think it was valid then and is 
valid now. We wrote it not to predict doom, but to challenge the myth of growth 
as the answer to all problems. We wanted to encourage the search for other 
answers. How can progress be defined in terms other than expansion by a certain 
percent per year? How can human beings find ways of living that are fulfilling, 
equitable and consistent with the laws of the planet? 
</P>
<P>
If I would make any change in the book now, it would be to explore further the 
alternatives to growth -- to say more about what a sustainable society could be 
like. A lot has been learned about that in the past 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of farmers in the United States, Europe and even the tropics 
now get consistent high yields without drenching the countryside in pesticides 
or chemical fertilizers, and with great reductions in soil erosion. Newly 
designed appliances, lights and motors can provide the same services with 
one-half or one-third as much energy (thereby reducing greenhouse emissions, 
acid rain and urban air pollution). In some places, most notably Europe and 
Japan, recycling municipal waste is becoming a fine art. Industries are 
learning to reuse hazardous chemicals they once threw out. 
</P>
<P>
Those are all steps that extend limits. They buy time for the longer-term 
challenge of controlling growth. 
</P>
<P>
There is progress on that front too. Many countries, from Panama to South Korea 
to Mauritius to China, are successfully reducing their population growth rates. 
And many people are finding purposes for life more satisfying and less damaging 
than endless material accumulation. 
</P>
<P>
The most remarkable conclusion of "The Limits to Growth," which was based on a 
computer model made by the System Dynamics Group at the Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology, was that the earth could indefinitely support at least 6 billion 
people, all at a comfortable European standard of living. In 17 subsequent 
years of working with global resource statistics, I feel more sure of that 
conclusion now than I did then. I see no reason why a sustainable world need be 
impoverished, dull, unjust, technically stagnant, tyrannical or offensive to 
the human spirit. Quite the contrary, I think learning to live in harmony with 
one another and with the limits and cycles of the earth is a far more exciting 
and worthy goal than mindless swelling. 
</P>
<P>
I don't know if we are running into the limits to growth, or if they are still 
ahead, or if we have surpassed them and are only now getting the signals that 
we have gone too far. No one knows. The only certainty is that we are closer to 
them than we used to be. The global warming, the dying trees, the polluted 
waters are not a surprise, not bad luck, not minor inconveniences that can be 
quickly fixed. They are powerful lessons about how a finite planet responds to 
a species that refuses to set its own limits. 
</P>
<P>
That is our choice -- to set our own limits rather than have the planet set 
them for us. A good way to start would be by questioning our vague, sacrosanct 
goal of growth. Growth of what? For whom? For how long? At what cost? Paid by 
whom? Paid when? 
</P>
<P>
If we can begin to answer those questions with some specificity and honesty, we 
may discover what actual desires are unaddressed by the myth of growth. We may 
begin to define a future we really want. We may discover -- I think we will -- 
that there is such a thing as enough.

STOCKTON MURDERS AND SACRAMENTO STALEMATES

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The tragic murder of five children on a Stockton schoolyard, by a criminal 
wielding an assault rifle, prompts renewed pleas to the Legislature for the 
rapid outlawing of such weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The competing sides of this issue are personified by two antagonists, State 
Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti and retired state Sen. H.L. 
Richardson, a director of the National Rifle Assn. Roberti has urged that 
citizens "write, talk, call on talk radio, call on legislators, demand, scream, 
pressure, intimidate -- they should do all of that," in support of a ban. 
Richardson, by contrast, has focused on the deceased killer, Patrick Edward 
Purdy: "The real question is how a nut like that, with his record, can walk 
around on the streets?" 
</P>
<P>
In my ninth year as a legislator, I can tell you that argument on the control 
of guns is one of the most shrill and illogical debates to which a legislator 
can listen. It has much of the high emotional content of the debate over 
abortion, frequently fraught with the same feelings, emotionalism and sentiment 
that totally obscure practical and logical aspects of the problem. During all 
of my time as a public official there has been a highly militant pressure group 
that would ban any and all personal possession of firearms. They are offset by 
groups that fight for the right to possess any and all firearms. These two 
polarized factions have thus far been incapable of rational communication. 
</P>
<P>
I have lived on both sides of the fence separating these two camps. As an 
occasional hunter, I have owned weapons designed for effective hunting. As a 
private citizen, I have owned handguns useful in defending my family from 
dangerous predatory human beings. I will not docilely tolerate any person or 
government interfering with my right to engage in lawful hunting or the lawful 
protection of my family. I have, on the other hand, spent 37 years with the Los 
Angeles Police Department watching all of the damage done by irresponsible 
people with guns and all of the carnage done by criminals in possession of 
guns. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of a total ban on firearms or all handguns is abhorrent to me. We have 
too many defenseless citizens and seniors who are robbed at their places of 
business, on the streets and in their own homes. Until we provide our police 
forces and courts with more funds to reform our criminal justice system and 
take these mad dogs out of the community, I'm going to maintain a firearm and I 
think every other law-abiding citizen should have that right. 
</P>
<P>
I find the "all or nothing" approach of opposing advocates on this issue 
personally disgusting. I don't want people screaming at me on this issue or 
attempting to intimidate me; I want cold, logical arguments on the facts. 
Without rushing, but with all deliberate speed, the Legislature should, once 
all the facts are known, confront this problem by evaluating the type of weapon 
in question and the type of individual who commits such murders. 
</P>
<P>
Does an AK-47 have any legitimate hunting or sporting use, or is it so easily 
converted into a full machine gun type of weapon that it should be banned, the 
way we banned the sawed-off shotgun and the machine gun? I don't yet know the 
answer, but I intend to listen, dispassionately, as both sides present their 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
If we decide to restrict or ban such weapons, it should be done not by broad 
language, such as "semiautomatic military weapons," but by a discrete 
identification of the AK-47 or other specific weapons we wish to restrict. 
</P>
<P>
I will intently listen to police professionals on this issue as well as to 
abolitionists and gun lobby spokesmen. My years of Sacramento experience in 
listening has, however, convinced me that all three groups are equally 
uncompromising in their positions. 
</P>
<P>
Most significant legislation comes about when proponents and opponents of 
conflicting ideas resolve enough of their differences to discover a synergistic 
approach that is better for everyone. This happens too infrequently, and we 
have too many logjams where powerful competitive interests stymie any 
constructive legislative action and exacerbate already difficult situations. 
</P>
<P>
All too often the public falls prey to legislative impotence rather than 
reform. A particularly compelling and repugnant example of a special-interest 
stalemate was brought into our living rooms during the recent initiative battle 
between our insurance and legal behemoths. 
</P>
<P>
Another painful example involves the issue of workers' compensation laws. 
Competing special interests assure that injured workers are inadequately 
compensated with increased frequency; employers pay increasingly high costs for 
workers' compensation insurance, and too many medical and legal practitioners 
prosper from the process. 
</P>
<P>
I do not damn the pressure groups, such as lawyers, trade unions, professional 
organizations and business organizations. They are absolutely healthy to good 
government; without them we as individuals would be ineffective in having our 
voices heard in the far-off legislative bodies of Sacramento and Washington. 
The only evil is when these groups abuse their power by sitting like pigs in 
the middle of the road of progress to prevent any solution. 
</P>
<P>
Let us break with this poor tradition so that logical and reasonable 
compromises may be achieved. We must urge the 1989 Legislature to realize that 
if everyone gives a little, solutions can be reached that protect all of our 
basic rights while dealing effectively with these issues. Most important, let 
us do everything in our power to ensure that we minimize the possibility of 
another Stockton schoolyard massacre. Can we afford to do less?

KILLING IN CAMBODIA: A TALE OF TWO DECADES

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cambodian Buddhists believe that dead souls not given a proper burial are 
condemned to wander restlessly in a nether world, unable to enter another body 
for reincarnation. Among the 500,000 dead in the civil war from 1970-75 and the 
1 million killed or worked to death by the Khmer Rouge from 1975-79, few were 
accorded the proper rites. This deeply troubles the Cambodian spirit. 
</P>
<P>
The survivors themselves are in limbo. For 10 years, since January, 1979, they 
have been ruled by Heng Samrin and Hun Sen, two former mid-level Khmer Rouge 
officials who were placed in power when the Vietnamese invasion toppled Pol Pot 
and the Khmer Rouge. 
</P>
<P>
Invasion liberated the country from genocidal tyranny but put state power in 
the hands of leaders who owed their survival to Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
For centuries the more powerful states of Vietnam to the east and Thailand to 
the west have threatened to swallow Cambodia. When the Vietnamese did arrive in 
1979 the situation was ambiguous: Vietnamese military and political support was 
essential to protect the fledgling People's Republic of Kampuchea, as the 
country is known today, from the return of the Khmer Rouge. The Khmer Rouge was 
rebuilt and rearmed with military assistance from China and Thailand, and 
diplomatic support from much of the world including the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The 7 million Cambodians who remain in their country have had to accept 
occupation by their traditional enemy, Vietnam, as the lesser evil compared 
with the return of the Khmer Rouge. For most of the last 10 years the 
international community has been content to condemn Cambodians to this awful 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
For nine of those years I have been traveling back and forth to Cambodia as a 
relief worker, attempting to provide humanitarian assistance in an atmosphere 
of continued anxiety, conflict and polarization. From the beginning of my 
involvement in 1980, the policy of the United States -- diplomatic backing for 
the Chinese and Thai policy of full support to the Khmer Rouge as the strongest 
resistance force to the Vietnamese occupation -- struck me as immoral 
Realpolitik of the most cynical sort. 
</P>
<P>
I have heard many stories of the Pol Pot period -- of a son whose father died 
in his arms, of a young woman whose parents and 12 siblings were killed. In 
1980 such stories poured out of Cambodians, more to each other than to outside 
relief workers. Ten years later, the emotions are not as raw and vivid, but the 
healing has been incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
A decade ago exhausted and malnourished survivors of the Khmer Rouge genocide 
began to trek across Cambodia to return to their villages and search for 
missing relatives. When they reached their villages they often found nothing 
left: homes damaged or destroyed, no trace of family and friends, food stocks 
looted or burned. Fighting between the Vietnamese and Khmer Rouge troops still 
swirled around them. Recapture by the Khmer Rouge meant instant death or, at 
best, a forced march west with the retreating soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
Once the fighting passed, peasants devoted any remaining energy to scavenging 
for food and constructing shelter for their families. Others headed for Phnom 
Penh, the capital that became a ghost town under the Khmer Rouge and was slowly 
being repopulated. 
</P>
<P>
Today Phnom Penh has a population of 800,000. It has the surface feel of a city 
-- bustling markets, restaurants, cinemas, shops and a tame version of rush 
hour. But at night, even before the 10 p.m. curfew, the city seems to suffer 
absence, as quiet as a village. 
</P>
<P>
Recovery from the 1979 famine was at first rapid; it has since slowed. The 
Vietnamese-backed government, unrecognized by all but the Soviet bloc and 
India, has faced an embargo on trade and aid imposed by Asian neighbors and 
Western countries. Cambodia has reached bare self-sufficiency in food 
production but even minor problems with drought or floods puts lives in 
jeopardy. In sectors dependent on outside investment -- industry, transport, 
communications and sanitation -- progress has been minimal. Just to get back to 
where it was in the '60s, much less to develop, Cambodia needs massive outside 
investment. This can only come when the political stalemate is resolved. In the 
meantime, the embargo on humanitarian aid punishes the poor of Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
Politically, the current government has gained in stature following the series 
of meetings between Prime Minister Hun Sen and Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the 
nation's former leader. Sihanouk's name still evokes, after decades of war and 
revolution, what Cambodians remember as the halcyon days when the country was 
whole. Cambodians now welcome government tolerance of the small private sector 
and recent announcements that collectivization of agricultural land will no 
longer be encouraged. 
</P>
<P>
But there is dissatisfaction with the continued dependence on Vietnam. The 
human-rights record of the government has been condemned by Amnesty 
International and other such organizations that deplore the detention of 
political prisoners without trial and the use of civilian labor on military 
works projects near the Thai-Cambodian border, projects that have resulted in 
deaths from land mines and malaria. 
</P>
<P>
The dialogues between Hun Sen and Sihanouk are the most concrete sign of hope 
that a settlement is possible in 1989. The initiatives of Soviet leader Mikhail 
S. Gorbachev, to reduce tensions with the West by cutting Soviet commitments to 
client states in regions of superpower tension, also help. 
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese, feeling Soviet pressure and desperate for capitalist investment 
in their own economy, have begun significant troop withdrawals from Cambodia, 
with a pledge to withdraw fully by 1990. The Soviet dialogue with China, main 
backers of the Khmer Rouge, hold further promise. 
</P>
<P>
At the United Nations, where the Khmer Rouge holds Cambodia's seat, the General 
Assembly, for the first time since 1979, passed a resolution dealing with 
Cambodia that included a veiled condemnation of the genocide when the Khmer 
Rouge were in power. 
</P>
<P>
But these diplomatic efforts, as significant as they are, cannot by themselves 
banish the Khmer Rouge. This monstrous group, revived and sustained since 1979 
as the means to drive the Vietnamese out of Cambodia, refuses to leave the 
scene now that its task is nearly done. So as the Vietnamese troops withdraw, 
Khmer Rouge begins to fill the vacuum, promising revenge on all those who dared 
to collaborate with the Vietnamese to ensure their own survival. 
</P>
<P>
Without an immediate halt to military and political support for the Khmer Rouge 
from China and Thailand -- a policy heretofore aided and abetted by the United 
States -- the talk of peace and U.N.-supervised elections and quadripartite 
governments is irrelevant and even dangerous. A strengthened Khmer Rouge has 
the potential power to disrupt any settlement, even if the group is nominally 
made a part of it. 
</P>
<P>
Now, State Department sources emphasize U.S. distance from the Khmer Rouge. 
During his confirmation hearings, Secretary of State James A. Baker III 
promised, "The United States will continue to work for a new Cambodia, free of 
both Vietnamese occupation and the Khmer Rouge." 
</P>
<P>
To say Cambodia could become another Lebanon, another Mozambique or another 
Nicaragua does not do justice to Cambodia. Cambodia, where the perpetrators 
have changed but violence has been the norm for 20 years, begs no comparison. 
Cambodians, the dead and the living, beg only, finally, for peace.

GUN CONTROL AND TRAGEDY IN A STOCKTON SCHOOLYARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the wake of the Stockton schoolyard tragedy (not to mention the senseless 
massacres before it), where innocent little children were murdered, I would 
like to make at least one thing perfectly clear: Any politician who even 
remotely supports the NRA or does nothing about gun control will not get a vote 
from me -- and I know I do not stand alone. Enough is enough.

SIGNALS ON ARMS CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush may have been conducting a form of arms-control negotiations 
with the Soviet Union during his televised press conference on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Early arms-control theorists worried that formal negotiations between 
Washington and Moscow eventually would get so technical and so bogged down in 
bureaucracy that they would collapse. Writing in 1960, Tom Schelling and Morton 
Halperin of Harvard University suggested that a series of displays of restraint 
on both sides might be the only way to achieve arms-control goals if that 
happened. Instead of written agreements, the superpowers would send signals to 
one another saying, in effect, "We could be building or deploying this weapon 
or that, but you will notice that we are not doing so." 
</P>
<P>
Congress experimented with such a signal of restraint in the mid-1980s, banning 
tests of weapons designed to destroy satellites in space (ASATs) as long as the 
Soviet Union did no testing of its own. The signal of restraint worked. The 
Soviets have not tested an ASAT since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
In his press conference, Bush endorsed something that former Sen. John Tower 
(D-Tex.)said about the Strategic Defense Initiative, also known as "Star Wars," 
during hearings the day before on his nomination to be defense secretary. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe that we can devise an umbrella that can protect the entire 
American population from nuclear incineration," Tower said. Asked about the 
comment, Bush said: "If he's talking about a shield that's so impregnable that 
it probably eliminates the need for other defense, I probably would agree with 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Scientists have been saying for years that building a shield is beyond their 
skills and that it may always be. But Administration officials were mum 
concerning the point while President Reagan was still in office, partly because 
he believed in the shield and partly because Americans will not be nearly as 
willing to pour $4 billion a year into research on an umbrella that would leak 
missiles like a sieve. 
</P>
<P>
Most Soviet scientists seem to be satisfied that Star Wars is out of reach. But 
Soviet soldiers and politicians, starting with Mikhail S. Gorbachev, are 
reluctant just to take their scientists' word for it, and they want to limit 
tests of defense weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Star Wars has enough conservative support to make it tough for Bush to put any 
such limits in writing. But he could signal restraint on Star Wars, leaving 
Congress to back him up with cuts in research funds. It would be a bold 
departure from the traditional White House approach to arms control, but you 
may have seen it happen Friday.

GUN CONTROL AND TRAGEDY IN A STOCKTON SCHOOLYARD

<P>
Let us pray for and work toward building a "kinder and gentler nation." As a 
saddened combat veteran of Vietnam, I am acutely aware that instead of honoring 
our nation's courage, bravery, and humanity we celebrate excitement, wild 
action, and our American sense of unassailable certitude. We glorify 
"Rambo-style" attacks as solutions to our problems. 
</P>
<P>
Now, sadly, we have a man who tried to solve his own problems by using a 
"Rambo-style" attack on our children.

GUN CONTROL AND TRAGEDY IN A STOCKTON SCHOOLYARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have been a gun user for the last 35 years and have seen disturbing changes 
in the "gun world." When I first became interested in firearms in 1951, gun 
shops carried bolt-action hunting and target rifles and a few semiautomatic 
22s. Military rifles from the two world wars were converted for hunting and 
target shooting. The interest was in accuracy, attractive stocks and proper 
caliber for hunting or target shooting. Handguns were for defense or target and 
held between six and nine rounds. 
</P>
<P>
Today the interest is in firepower. Military weapons with magazines that hold 
up to 50 rounds are common. More disturbing is the recent production of 
semiautomatic pistols with a magazine capacity of 100 rounds. As with the 
assault rifles they have no legitimate use other than mass killing or combat. 
They are a tragedy waiting to happen. 
</P>
<P>
The NRA has for years protected us from unwise gun regulations that would have 
taken away the legitimate right to own and use firearms. However, they now 
block needed legislation to keep weapons of mass murder out of the hands of the 
insane, and to a lesser extent, the professional criminal. (I still believe 
that most criminals will find guns in spite of regulation.) 
</P>
<P>
We need a more reasoned approach to the problem from both sides. The NRA should 
back some good laws such as waiting periods and a check for criminal records 
for most arms. The legislators should propose well-written laws that have some 
chance of success and not simply pass a new law in reaction to each crime that 
makes headlines.

GUN CONTROL AND TRAGEDY IN A STOCKTON SCHOOLYARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In your editorial, The Times predictably seized upon the tragedy of Stockton to 
fuel new attempts to ban firearms. This time your target is so-called "assault 
weapons." 
</P>
<P>
The sad fact is that the murderer could have caused as much or more carnage at 
the school by ramming his car across the playground, or burning a couple of 
crowded classrooms with his "crude incendiary devices." Other disturbed people 
in the past have used cars or arson to kill and you didn't issue outraged calls 
to ban cars or gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
A great many people own and use firearms such as the AK-47 in sport shooting or 
as part of collections. The vast majority will never be used in crime. To 
prohibit the legal ownership of something because criminals sometimes use it 
and it has great potential for deadly misuse would logically lead to the 
prohibition of many things. Private airplanes and boats, fast cars, chemistry 
sets, home workshops, and personal computers are a few easy to name ones. I 
don't think most Americans want to live in a society where government regulates 
everything. 
</P>
<P>
I am a member of the NRA. I am a "decent sportsman." I do work to make 
lawmakers understand my views. I vote. I also can't think of a more "coercive 
pressure group" than the anti-gun people you spearhead.

I agree wholeheartedly with The Times position on gun control (editorial, 
"Outrage in Stockton," Jan. 19). It's time that Congress got the drop on the 
NRA and voted to ban the kinds of assault weapons used in the Stockton and 
McDonald's massacres. 
</P>
<P>
Congress also ought to win one for former Reagan press secretary Jim Brady by 
enacting a minimum national waiting period for handgun purchases.

GOING BROKE IN MOSCOW

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

The Soviet Union's new candor has prompted the public admission that the 
government not only runs a budget deficit, but that it's a whopper. Three 
months ago Finance Minister Boris Gostev disclosed that the 1989 deficit would 
reach 35 billion rubles, or $58 billion at the official rate of exchange. 
Western economists who considered that figure too low now find their suspicions 
confirmed. Leonid I. Abalkin, director of the National Institute of the 
Economy, says that this year's real deficit, including borrowing, will exceed 
$160 billion. That's equivalent to 11% of the gross national product, compared 
to a U.S. budget deficit thatis about 4% of GNP. The deficit, Abalkin says, 
"ruins" the economy. For President Mikhail S. Gorbachev it also raises the most 
troubling political questions. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, Abalkin says, trying to reduce the deficit will force deferring 
until at least the mid-1990s the major improvement in living standards that 
Gorbachev has made a priority in his program to restructure the economy. So 
far, whatever has been promised, the Gorbachev era has seen a net decline in 
living standards, with short-ages of food and basic consumer goods deepening 
even as public demands for improvement grow louder. As part of the effort to 
cut the deficit, Abalkin says, about 20% of current capital investment in the 
civilian sector will be slashed. The prospect, then, is for things to get worse 
before they start to get better. 
</P>
<P>
Other savings are expected from previously announced cuts in military spending 
and from a threatened shutdown of inefficient, money-losing factories and 
farms. These steps could cut the deficit by about 20%. But far more drastic 
measures will have to be taken if the hoped-for goal of wiping out the deficit 
within three years is to be reached. 
</P>
<P>
A further casualty of the deficit crisis will be the plan to lift government 
controls on prices. As Abalkin concedes, price deregulation in a time of 
unabated shortages would be sure to produce an inflation that in turn would 
raise demands on the state for higher wages, further aggravating the deficit 
problem. But if moving toward a market system of prices is deferred, then it's 
hard to see how plans to edge toward a market system in the production of goods 
can be carried out. Soviet economic history makes clear that the gap between 
consumer demand and supply can't be closed by fiat or ideological exhortation. 
A market approach would narrow that gap, but now the Soviet Union's most 
prominent economist says that the conditions for this aren't appropriate and 
are not likely to be for some time. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev has staked his political life on making economic restructuring work. 
If the reform effort fails, as he well knows, the Soviet Union can forget about 
its chances to be internationally competitive. So far success has eluded him, 
and the unavoidable question becomes how much more time he may have left to 
shake up a system that has proved to be woefully inadequate for the late 20th 
Century, and hopelessly unsuited for the 21st. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's high standing in opinion polls taken in West Germany or Orange 
County is interesting, but far more significant is how he stands among 285 
million Soviet citizens. The priority that he gave to improving supplies of 
food and consumer goods showed clearly the importance that he put on winning 
public approval, for popular support could give him a claim to political 
legitimacy that his opponents in the higher echelons of leadership would fear 
to challenge. Now, though, the Soviet people are again being told that their 
economy is a mess and that they will have to wait still longer for the promised 
bigger piece of the pie. That message is not likely to boost Gorbachev's 
approval rating at home, or strengthen his hand in the Kremlin.

LIFE DOESN'T BEGIN, IT CONTINUES; 
</P>
<P>
ABORTION FOES ERR IN SETTING CONCEPTION AS THE STARTING POINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIE A. SHNEOUR, Elie A. Shneour is chairman of the Southern California 
Skeptics, a Pacific affiliate of the American Assn. for the Advancement of 
Science, and director of Biosystems Research Institute in La Jolla. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Missouri statute banning state-funded abortions is now before the U.S. 
Supreme Court for review. The preamble to the law declares that " . . . the 
life of each human being begins at conception." In overturning that law, the 
U.S. 8th Circuit Court of Appeals, in St. Louis, called the above statement ". 
. . an impermissible theory of life . . . ." It contradicts not only the Wade 
vs. Roe decision, but the most elementary principles of modern biology as well. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, modern biology has also been under severe and continuing attack 
by creationists, the animal-rights movement, and by the anti-abortion 
fundamentalists. No wonder that there is an appalling illiteracy abroad on what 
should have been self-evident for every high-school graduate in the nation. No 
reasonable person can dismiss the concerns of those who oppose abortion as a 
religious or ethical issue. But to call first-trimester abortion murder, the 
taking of a human life, is more an understandable emotional rather than 
rational response. 
</P>
<P>
Human life begins at conception. This extreme statement, the basis of most of 
the opposition to abortion, is patently false for a very simple and 
self-evident reason: Life never stops. It is a continuum that the great French 
scientist Louis Pasteur in the last century demonstrated in a series of 
classical experiments. These experiments were the death-knell of the concept of 
spontaneous generation of life, something that the creationists of today still 
cling to with such fervor. A woman is born with the full complement of eggs 
that she will shed, one by one, once a month, throughout her reproductive life. 
The unfertilized eggs die and are lost, and that is the fate of most of them. 
By contrast, a man generates spermatozoa by the millions for each ejaculation, 
and these sperm cells die by the billions during a human lifetime. 
Fertilization of an egg by a single sperm cell is only possible with the 
biochemical cooperation of millions of other spermatozoa. 
</P>
<P>
Both the eggs and the spermatozoa are living cells. The main difference between 
these cells and somatic (i.e. body) cells is that sperm and egg each have only 
half of the full complement of chromosomes of a somatic cell. The essential 
point is that life does not begin with a fertilized egg: Life was there all 
along with the egg and the spermatozoa. The pathway of life is a long and 
continuous saga, a kind of relay race where fierce and cruel competition is 
focused on passing the winning chromosomes to the next generation. 
</P>
<P>
A person who burns a house down is an arsonist. But a person who burns only the 
blueprint of that house is certainly not an arsonist. The fertilized egg is 
primarily a blueprint that may, and only may, eventually become a human being. 
Nature destroys fertilized eggs during pregnancy for many reasons: health of 
the mother as well as potentially serious and fatal defects in the conceptus. 
</P>
<P>
The bringing of a human being into the world is perhaps the most compelling of 
all ethical considerations involving procreation. Life is an unforgivingly 
cruel challenge. It should be the responsibility of the procreators to ensure 
that a new human being will have a fair chance to compete. It is murder to kill 
a human being with premeditation. Just as burning a house blueprint is not 
arson, it is reasonable to ask whether the destruction of a fertilized egg can 
be called murder. Most responsible and thinking persons would not think so. 
</P>
<P>
Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny. This is a fundamental tenet of modern biology 
that derives from evolutionary theory, and is thus anathema to creationism as 
well as to those opposed to freedom of choice. Ontogeny is the name for the 
process of development of a fertilized egg into a fully formed and mature 
living organism. Phylogeny, on the other hand, is the history of the evolution 
of a species, in this case the human being. During development, the fertilized 
egg progresses over 38 weeks through what is, in fact, a rapid passage through 
evolutionary history: From a single primordial cell, the conceptus progresses 
through being something of a protozoan, a fish, a reptile, a bird, a primate 
and ultimately a human being. There is a difference of opinion among scientists 
about the time during pregnancy when a human being can be said to emerge. But 
there is general agreement that this does not happen until after the end of the 
first trimester. At that point the fetus is less than four inches long and 
weighs less than two ounces, a long way from being a biologically formed human 
baby. 
</P>
<P>
These modern biological considerations are crucial factors in deciding what 
constitutes a new and viable human being. And judging from the 7-to-2 decision 
of the U.S. Supreme Court on Edward vs. Aguillard, which declared the Louisiana 
statute imposing creationism in the public-school curriculum unconstitutional, 
it seems reasonable to suggest that scientific evidence will be taken into 
consideration by the court in the adjudication of the Missouri statute.

ERMA BOMBECK: IDLE TALK WHEN THE MIND'S SET ON IDLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Erma Bombeck 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For years, while carrying on a conversation with my husband, I have watched him 
shift from reality to automatic pilot. 
</P>
<P>
I can tell the exact moment he switches over. Usually, it's when I am telling 
him something important, such as how Marge always changes the batteries in her 
smoke alarm on her birthday because it makes it easier to remember. That's when 
I see his eyes glaze over and his lips form a thin line. It's a cross between a 
smile and the look he gets when he cuts himself shaving. 
</P>
<P>
The man has paid a big price for not paying attention to me when I talk. He 
didn't hear my story about the Hawkins' dog, which earned the neighborhood 
"Mutt Slut" title by escaping through a mail slot at night. And he was tuned 
out the entire time I was telling him about this woman on "Wheel of Fortune" 
who could have solved the puzzle for $25,000 but she picked the wrong vowel. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of women might be sensitive about being ignored. Actually, I have turned 
it into a cream center in the Whitman Sampler of life. 
</P>
<P>
I can say to him, "Aren't you dressed yet? We're meeting Phebe and Ray at 
7:30." 
</P>
<P>
He will look shocked and say, "You didn't tell me we were going out tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, I didn't tell him, but I shake my head and smile a maniacal little 
smile. "I told you two weeks ago, but you were probably in cruise control 
again." 
</P>
<P>
Please don't try this in your own home if you're an amateur. But if you really 
know your subject, you can drive him crazy by timing him carefully, and when 
you see his mind returning to the planet Earth, say, "Then it's all settled. 
I'll withdraw the money in the morning." 
</P>
<P>
He was alert the other day when I said to him, "Have you seen my checkbook?" 
</P>
<P>
"I destroyed it and closed your account," he said, flipping through the paper. 
</P>
<P>
"You did what?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't you remember?" he said. "A couple of days ago you told me you had lost 
your checkbook five times in one week and were so disgusted with yourself you 
didn't deserve to be treated as a responsible adult. You told me to flat-out 
close your account, and if you needed to write a check you could use one from 
the joint account. So, I did it." 
</P>
<P>
I sat there numb. "Was that the same day I suggested you set a trap for the 
mouse in the woodwork that I knew for a fact was 'with child'?" 
</P>
<P>
He didn't remember.

ZAN THOMPSON: DECORATING BRINGS DOWN THE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Zan Thompson 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As soon as all the Christmas frippery goes back into the attic and the red 
candles have guttered their last and made their last permanent stain on the 
coffee table, our house suddenly looks like the middle of a truck stop. 
</P>
<P>
The same rooms that Patsy and I and our staff, Peaches and Mrs. Goldfarb, 
thought were gracious and charming in early December now look like photographs 
taken to accompany an article headed, "Can This House Be Saved?" 
</P>
<P>
My friend Barbara Treiman says there is hope. She is an interior designer and a 
dandy woman. She came by last week for a cup of tea and sympathy, the latter 
hers for me. 
</P>
<P>
What is great about Barbara, besides being a funny and steady friend, is that 
she doesn't look at my house and just say, "Bulldoze it." 
</P>
<P>
And she tells me funny and heart-warming stories about people for whom she has 
done houses, apartments, condominiums, flats in London and on Repulse Bay and a 
place above the Mandarin Hotel in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
One woman who almost drove Barbara mad is one I can understand. Not condone, 
just understand. Barbara began to worry that her beautiful furnishings and 
fabrics selected with great care months before, furniture made by Black Forest 
elves, tapestry wall coverings from French castles, would go for naught. 
</P>
<P>
Or they would go in six months. That was when the woman was planning a great, 
big, smash-bang shoot-'em-up wedding for her only daughter -- 750 guests 
expected for the reception and sit-down dinner. 
</P>
<P>
The house, however, needed a good cleaning. Every time Marilyn went over to 
show the woman a newly arrived handsome fabric, she saw the same dust on all 
the furniture. There were enough dusty surfaces to transcribe the Articles of 
Confederation. 
</P>
<P>
Days-old newspapers and years-old magazines carpeted the floors. Barbara had 
almost decided to suggest, one day before the wedding, that the reception be in 
the church hall. 
</P>
<P>
The day of the wedding, she drove into the woman's driveway expecting to find 
that the house had been condemned. There was a large cleaning crew there, 
rushing from room to room with vacuum cleaners, polishers, furniture polish, 
silver polish. In the midst of the madness stood the mother of the bride, fully 
gowned in her wedding dress and smiling placidly. The house was gorgeous and 
shining for the reception and so were the guests. 
</P>
<P>
"I really liked that woman although she almost drove me out of my mind," 
Barbara said. "I like all my clients and many of them become close friends. 
Otherwise, it's impossible to work with them. When I find myself in that 
situation, I remove myself as quickly as possible." 
</P>
<P>
"One young yuppie woman who lived with her husband and small baby wanted her 
entire house designed from top to bottom. I worked on it for six months, 
waiting for just the right fabrics and furniture. I went to see her near the 
end of the job and arrived with the last big piece, the couch. I walked in the 
door as she was leaving, holding her baby and kicking a suitcase in front of 
her. She said, 'I can't stand him one more minute. I hate him. I'm leaving.' 
</P>
<P>
Barbara says that she heard later that she came back, but she does not see them 
as a couple for whom she will be doing a freshen-up job for their 25th 
anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
She has one red-haired client who wanted her house done in purple and 
turquoise. Maybe I'll do our house in those colors if Patsy and the rest will 
let me. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara always likes my teddy bears in the bedroom, the mother and daughter 
bears flossed up in lace scarfs and pearls. I can't wait to tell Patsy. She 
thinks I should be beyond teddy bears. I don't know why. Patsy's teddy bear, 
Casey, sits in a small rocking chair in the living room and wears a sombrero.

THOUGHTS ON ABORTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thanks for a fascinating article on "The Psychology of Abortion" (by Garry 
Abrams, Jan. 17). It occurred to me while reading it that the insistence by 
pro-choice groups on using the terms pro-choice and anti-choice is not just a 
ploy to use non-offensive wording, but actually an attempt to keep the debate 
where it should be -- not on abortion, but on the right for a woman to choose 
the direction of her life. 
</P>
<P>
What made me think of this was the story of Jill Lodato, who admits that her 
first abortion occurred almost without thought, though the second caused 
psychological reverberations from which she has only recently recovered. It 
struck me that these reverberations happened not because of the abortion per 
se, but instead because this woman was forced into making a choice that was not 
her own. She did not want the abortion, but allowed family and peer pressure to 
push her into it. 
</P>
<P>
The strange thing is that, after what must be a crushing experience, Lodato 
would force that same experience on others. She would deny other women the 
right to choose, simply because their choice might be one with which she (now) 
disagrees. Actually, it's not so much strange as sad.

IRRELEVANTLY OUTFITTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the midst of the present political and social changes this country is going 
through, I feel (and I would assume the majority of the people not involved in 
the hoopla surrounding the inauguration also feel) that who wears what to which 
function has absolutely no relevance to events and problems in the real world 
and indeed the outfits (and perhaps their wearers) will be forgotten in the 
not-too-distant future. 
</P>
<P>
It is with this idea that I skimmed your article in the View section ("The 
Great Gown Dust-Up," by Bettijane Levine, Jan. 20), and I expended that much 
effort having first seen the inauguration earlier in the day on television and 
feeling that Mrs. Quayle's attire was rather forgettable except for the hat, 
which made the entire package unattractive. Marilyn Quayle, you're no Jackie 
Kennedy.

ON ART MUSEUM FUNDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re: "Architectural Design on a User-Friendly Scale," Jan. 10. 
</P>
<P>
It came as quite a surprise to read in Leon Whiteson's otherwise informative 
review of an exhibition at the Gallery of Functional Art that the Santa Monica 
Museum of Art is a "privately funded" institution. Quite the contrary. 
</P>
<P>
The museum is a nonprofit, tax-exempt organization dependent upon public 
support. We are wholly supported by contributions from our membership and board 
of trustees, and through grants from governmental agencies, corporations and 
charitable foundations. A great many individuals have generously lent their 
time, expertise and money to making the museum a reality. It is this collective 
effort and public good will that supports the Santa Monica Museum of Art.

JACKSON HOLE: ACTION IN WYOMING'S GRAND TETONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<P>
JACKSON, Wyo. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Huddled on the snowy bank of the Snake River at Moose, Dornan's may be the 
world's most scenic bar. Before its picture window, skiers gather to sip Irish 
coffee at sunset and pay homage to the stunning mountain panorama. Peaks and 
jagged pinnacles tower over this valley like a Gothic cathedral. The Grand 
Tetons, a choir of majestic granite spires, trumpet their beauty through the 
high country basin called Jackson Hole. 
</P>
<P>
While Jackson Hole offers an unspoiled paradise for winter recreation, the 
region resounds with a sanctity and power that enrich the spirit. Dramatic 
vistas and wildlife abound. The valley is part of the largest chunk of 
wilderness left in the world's temperate zones. 
</P>
<P>
Named for Davey Jackson, a beaver trapper who claimed this "hole," or valley, 
his territory in the 1800s, Jackson Hole is hemmed in by mountains. The flat, 
mile-high valley reaches south from Yellowstone National Park for 50 miles, 
holding some of the West's most spectacular country, terminating here in the 
town of Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
Snow is powdery from Thanksgiving to Easter, and terrain to ski and explore 
remains virtually unlimited. Wide trails follow the course of the Snake River, 
a fertile habitat for wildlife. Flocks of ducks and teams of trumpeter swans 
honk their greetings as the fish-filled river winds its way along the valley

floor from headwaters deep in Yellowstone. In this primitive environment you're 
more likely to meet a moose than another skier. 
</P>
<P>
Ski beneath the Tetons and experience nature's symphony. Wind whistles in steep 
glacier-carved canyons where streams chime with melting snow. A chain of lakes 
shimmer; chickadees carol in meadows at the foot of misty gabled peaks. The 
refulgent landscape is a balm and benediction. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to some farsighted folks, the region remains a living paradigm of 
primordial Western America. 
</P>
<P>
John D. Rockefeller donated much of the land now included in Grand Teton 
National Park. Local writer Margaret Murie, 87, energetically carries on the 
conservation cause. 
</P>
<P>
Only 3% of Teton County is privately owned, and the rest is protected within 
the national park, Bridger-Teton National Forest and the National Elk Refuge. 
</P>
<P>
Preservation efforts do not keep out modern recreation. The pleasures of high 
mountain helicopter and downhill skiing, snowmobiling, ice skating, snowshoe 
hiking and dude ranching are plentiful. You can take a moonlit sleigh ride, go 
by dog sled to dinner or drive a snowmobile to Granite Hot Springs for a soak 
in nature's own Jacuzzi. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wide-Open Spaces 
</P>
<P>
Downhill skiers have a profusion of wide-open spaces. Three major ski areas 
include more than 5,000 acres of slopes and trails and an aerial tram. Snow 
King Mountain, imposing backdrop for the colorful town of Jackson, is Wyoming's 
oldest ski area. 
</P>
<P>
At family-oriented Grand Targhee Resort on the west side of the Tetons, snow is 
so light and deep that few slopes even need grooming. Targhee averages more 
than 500 inches of annual snowfall and claims the best powder skiing in the 
northern Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson Hole Ski Resort at Teton Village boasts the longest vertical drop in 
the nation. Towering 10,000 feet over the village, the resort's Rendezvous 
Mountain offers a kaleidoscope of trails -- through powder bowls, gladed 
meadows and fragrant forests. 
</P>
<P>
All three resorts stage annual torchlight parades down mountain slopes as part 
of their Christmas and New Year's Eve festivities. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the area's stark, pastoral elegance, Jackson has a lively Wild 
West character. Covered wooden walkways, Western storefronts and a cluster of 
cowboy saloons create a rustic atmosphere. Huge arches of elk antlers mark the 
Jackson town square and serve as the Jackson logo. 
</P>
<P>
Restaurants such as the Silver Sage (on the south side of the square) and the 
Sojourner Stockman, at the Sojourner Inn at Teton Village, specialize in steaks 
and barbecue. Others pride themselves on their au courant atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mangy Moose Saloon 
</P>
<P>
 Off-Broadway (30 S. King St., one block from the square) creates trendy fresh 
seafood and pasta dishes. The Cadillac Grille (on the west side of the square) 
fiddles with nouvelle cuisine in Art Deco interiors. You can sip a cappuccino 
at cozy Cafe Varnet (82 S. King St.) or nurse a beer at the popular Mangy Moose 
saloon at Teton Village. 
</P>
<P>
For country music, check out the bands at the Million Dollar Cowboy Bar on the 
square or the Silver Dollar Bar in the historic Wort Hotel. The bars are 
embedded with silver dollars and the dance floors are swinging night spots. 
</P>
<P>
The largest herd of elk in North America winters on the northern edge of 
Jackson, protected by the National Elk Refuge. Schedule a picturesque sleigh 
ride into their midst at the refuge visitor center for close views. You'll see 
thousands of the animals in their own habitat, stags cracking horns, then 
locked in battle. 
</P>
<P>
Elk is what brought Margaret E. (Mardy) Murie here. Her husband, Olaus Murie, a 
field biologist for the U.S. Biological Survey, came to study the declining elk 
herd in the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Preservation Role 
</P>
<P>
His studies soon became world famous, and the two stayed to raise their family. 
Olaus Murie played an important role in preserving two major wilderness areas: 
Grand Teton National Park and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. 
</P>
<P>
Margaret Murie made her own mark as teacher and author. ("Two in the Far 
North," describing her Alaskan childhood, is still in print.) 
</P>
<P>
With her special warmth and humble eloquence, Mardy is known as the 
conservationists' "grand doyenne." The salons in her log house tucked beneath 
the Tetons, on a bend in the river near the park visitor center in Moose, 
attract well-known political figures and naturalists. 
</P>
<P>
"Our problem now is not the amount of lands that are under state, private or 
federal jurisdiction, but whether we can keep our souls receptive to the 
message of peace this unspoiled landscape offers," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson Hole celebrates the grandeur of nature and the spirit of people acting 
for a noble cause. What's more, it's tops for winter recreation. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- -- 
</P>
<P>
The Jackson Hole area offers a variety of accommodations for winter visitors, 
who can book by the night or buy a package that includes lift tickets. 
</P>
<P>
For lodging in downtown Jackson, try the Wort Hotel (about $70 for a double 
room) or the cozy, antique-filled Parkway Inn (about $40 double), both within 
easy walking distance of shops, restaurants and night life. You can call both 
places toll-free: Wort Hotel, (800) 322-2727, and Parkway Inn, (800) 247-8390. 
</P>
<P>
At the base of the slopes in Teton Village, Alpenhof Lodge offers alpine living 
for $80 to $125 double. Call (800) 732-3244. 
</P>
<P>
Spring Creek Ranch has the most scenic setting in the area. It's on a hill 700 
feet above the valley floor, and the full-service resort offers a spectacular 
vista of the Grand Tetons. High-styled wood bungalows surround a large 
ice-skating pond, and all accommodations (inn rooms, condominiums, studios and 
suites) have fireplaces. Prices from $75. Call (800) 443-6139. 
</P>
<P>
Lodging rates are about 20% higher during summer. For year-round reservations, 
contact Jackson Hole Central Reservations, P.O. Box 510, Teton Village, Wyo. 
83025, toll-free (800) 443-6931. 
</P>
<P>
Excellent literature describing the area's winter activities, lodging, 
restaurants and sightseeing is available from the Jackson Hole Area Chamber of 
Commerce, P.O. Box E, Jackson, Wyo. 83001, (307) 733-3316.

ON A WING AND (WITHOUT) A PRAYER

<TEXT>
<P>
Several weeks ago as we left my parents' house in Washington Crossing, Pa., to 
return to Los Angeles, little did we know that our courage and endurance would 
be sorely tested as we jetted across the continent. 
</P>
<P>
To begin with, we'd already had enough of the cross-country blues. Earlier, in 
July, we had missed our connection in Dallas-Ft. Worth after a thunderstorm 
stranded our early evening flight at the Philadelphia airport for three hours. 
We spent four miserable hours in an airport motel before catching a sunrise 
flight to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
We each arrived at work late, bleary-eyed and cranky following this long 
night's journey into day. A relaxing five-day vacation was a distant memory 
before we had even reached home. 
</P>
<P>
Never again, I resolved. 
</P>
<P>
That's why I booked a direct flight from Newark, N.J., to Los Angeles six 
months in advance of our holiday trip. The inconvenience of getting to the 
airport would be worth the peace of mind. I even made it for 12:30 p.m. to give 
us a safety net of several hours in case something went awry. 
</P>
<P>
It did . . . fully three weeks before our departure. 
</P>
<P>
The airlines called to say we would have to change planes in Chicago. I was 
about to object when the agent pleasantly added that our arrival time in Los 
Angeles still would be 5:15 p.m. I let it go. 
</P>
<P>
Weeks later I would mentally replay this fateful conversation over and over, 
trying to make it come out differently. 
</P>
<P>
The sun was shining on a crisp December day when we reached the check-in 
counter at Newark International Airport. We had already taken a car, train and 
cab during a two-hour trek to the terminal when Katherine inquired about the 
weather in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"Snow," the agent replied so cheerfully that I thought she was kidding. "Three 
to six inches. But it's not expected until this afternoon, so maybe you'll miss 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, this would not be the last misinformation we would receive on 
this, our longest day. 
</P>
<P>
Flight 1155 boarded at 1:30 p.m., one hour late. A flight attendant merrily 
recited the emergency instructions in rhyme, including holiday greetings. The 
rest of the journey would be pure bah humbug. 
</P>
<P>
Moments later the pilot announced that a snowstorm in Chicago would force us to 
wait at least another hour, maybe longer. I felt a sinking feeling in my 
stomach. Soon I would feel something more immediate: hunger pangs. 
</P>
<P>
Katherine said -- a little late, I thought -- that one should never connect 
through Chicago in winter. I burrowed deeper into my novel, "Ransom," escaping 
to suspense in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"It was almost dark. Ransom looked up at the huge gray sky. He could almost see 
the first faint stars. He could feel the planet turning and moving through 
space. He could feel the tug of gravity in his arms and legs, and he could hear 
the roar of darkness sweeping toward him like a fist." 
</P>
<P>
It was 2:30 p.m when the pilot announced another delay. He reassured passengers 
that connecting flights would also be held up in Chicago. He would repeat this 
so often that it sounded like a mantra meant to ward off psychic duress. 
</P>
<P>
The baby across the aisle, a veritable olfactory and auditory time bomb, was 
growing restless. My stomach was growling. 
</P>
<P>
Wasn't "Planes, Trains and Automobiles" last year's big holiday movie? 
</P>
<P>
At 3 p.m. the fasten-seat-belt sign flashed on. "We're cooking," the pilot 
chortled as he began to taxi toward the runway. My sophisticated wife put her 
fingers in her mouth and whistled. 
</P>
<P>
"If we make that connection, all will be forgiven," I told her, not sure who 
there was to forgive. 
</P>
<P>
But moments later the captain was back, sheepishly announcing another delay. 
His credibility was shot; we would not hear from him again. A flight attendant 
would make all further announcements. 
</P>
<P>
The baby across the aisle was pounding the service tray. I thought maybe next 
year we'd have the folks come visit us. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps fearing an uprising, the head flight attendant challenged the restive 
passengers to guess the combined ages of the five flight attendants. The prize 
was a bottle of wine. It would, of course, have plenty of time to age quite 
nicely right there. 
</P>
<P>
I said 133. The answer was 126. I considered protesting; my estimate was based 
on their ages when the flight was completed. 
</P>
<P>
At 4 p.m., after 2 1/2 hours held hostage on the runway, we were finally 
airborne. Halfway to Chicago I finished the novel. Ransom was dead. I tried to 
be fatalistic about what lay ahead for me. 
</P>
<P>
As the snow streamed past the glistening wing of our jet in a dazzling 
fast-motion kaleidoscope, the pilot assured us again about connecting flights. 
Now, however, he had downgraded his assurance to refer to "most" of them. 
</P>
<P>
He might as well have told us he was Kris Kringle. One airline alone would 
cancel more than 400 flights on this fateful day. 
</P>
<P>
We arrived in Chicago at 6 p.m., nearly 10 hours after leaving my parents' home 
in sunny Pennsylvania. Our Los Angeles flight had been canceled. 
</P>
<P>
The airport was pandemonium. The hubbub and milling hordes reminded me of a 
Middle Eastern bazaar. I felt like shish kebab. 
</P>
<P>
We were directed to the connections counter. I got into a long line that didn't 
budge for 45 minutes. Kafka does O'Hare. 
</P>
<P>
Inside I felt an unhappy little boy struggling to get out. He longed to kick 
and scream and throw a temper tantrum right there. But I looked around and no 
one else was kicking and screaming, not even all the little boys clutching 
their Christmas presents. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, I stood silently and sulked. Like a grown-up. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Grim News 
</P>
<P>
Katherine left to work the phones and returned with grim news. Prospects for 
catching anything other than a colossal headache that night appeared dim. 
</P>
<P>
But one option remained. I saw that a flight to Palm Springs was leaving at 
7:30 p.m. We could trade in our ticket and rent a car to make the two-hour 
drive home. I surveyed the airport chaos once more. Decisively, we made our 
move. 
</P>
<P>
"You're on your own in Palm Springs," the ticket agent advised us. "Fine," I 
said. On your own. It sounded like a password to the Magic Kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
We later learned that thousands of fellow travelers were stranded in the 
airport overnight. They awoke to face long delays the next day when snow 
blasted Chicago with a double whammy. I'm sure many of them would have 
preferred to fly by sled and reindeer. 
</P>
<P>
We, on the other hand, had left only our baggage behind. Dire circumstances 
required sacrifice. It was them or us. The luggage would catch up with us the 
next day in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
As we barreled down the runway I felt as if we were on one of the last 
helicopters ascending from the roof of the American Embassy in Saigon in 1975. 
Escape. 
</P>
<P>
Well, almost. Inexplicably, Katherine struck up a conversation with an 
insufferably pompous and self-absorbed young man who was loudly touting the 
virtues of Gabriel Garcia-Marquez, the Christian Science Monitor, Georgetown 
night life, National Public Radio and, mostly, himself. 
</P>
<P>
He was tossing down bourbons and tossing out bon mots at a nauseating pace. 
</P>
<P>
Where, I thought, was John Candy when we needed him? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trivia Champ 
</P>
<P>
When Mr. Spigot got up I asked Katherine to turn him off. But he returned, 
grandiosely announcing that he collected "bits of information that are of no 
use to anyone but myself." I slept fitfully as the Spigot poured over the 
geopolitics of the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
We disembarked in Palm Springs at 10 p.m. The little boy almost broke free when 
the rental-car agent informed me that all the vehicles at the airport were 
reserved. Fortunately, this would prove to be the final erroneous news on a day 
when accuracy took it on the chin. 
</P>
<P>
Katherine, meanwhile, assured me that we were destined to get a car because she 
had found a lucky penny that morning. "It's about time it kicked in," I 
replied. 
</P>
<P>
Like Washington boarding his trusty Durham rowboat, we stepped into the chilled 
desert air, hopped into our rented Delta '88 Oldsmobile and set sail for home. 
</P>
<P>
Having destiny in our hands, however detoured, lifted our spirits. We agreed 
that it not only felt like a long time since we had left Los Angeles for our 
10-day vacation, but that it seemed like eternity since we left Pennsylvania 
this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Then, just when we thought we had seen everything, we spotted two huge 
dinosaurs just off the freeway. There in the darkness, between a food stand and 
a gas station, loomed life-size statues of a Tyrannosaurus and a Brontosaurus. 
</P>
<P>
"You know," I said, "when we began this trip, those things still roamed the 
Earth." 
</P>
<P>
We laughed, relieved survivors who had come a long way. Bring on the Hessians. 
</P>

THE SHOPPER: MILAN: PORTO TICINESE CHARMS BUYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER MERIN, Merin is a New York City free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's ironic that Milan, a businesslike and somewhat grimy industrial city, 
should be the capital of ultra-chic and trendy Italian style. 
</P>
<P>
Consider that historic Rome (with its architecture and monuments) and romantic 
Florence (laden with artistic treasures) are more interesting as tourist 
destinations. Nevertheless, when it comes to trend-setting shopping, Milan 
draws the accolades . . . and the crowds. 
</P>
<P>
Milan boasts the flagship boutiques of Armani, Versace, Krizia, Missoni, 
Biagiotti, Ferre and other alta moda designers that determine silhouette 
shapes, hem lengths, fabrics and colors for trendy dressers worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
These designer shops, offering the very latest styles and more complete 
collections than in U.S. boutiques or department stores, are easy to find in 
the city's well-known and pricey Via Montenapoleone district ("Montenapo," to 
those in the know). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Across Town 
</P>
<P>
However, some of Milan's trendiest clothing and most distinctive personal and 
home accessories are displayed in some very unusual boutiques across town in 
the southwestern Porta Ticinese section. 
</P>
<P>
This old working-class neighborhood was recently gentrified and is now a modish 
gathering place for Milan's upcoming designers and crafts people. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the interesting merchandise, the area has a distinctive ambiance 
and neighborhood charm. 
</P>
<P>
Weathered but attractive buildings line several canals linked by little 
footbridges. Among them are an appealing array of inviting cafes and lively 
wine bars. It's fun to kick back in Porta Ticinese and it's a great place to 
shop. 
</P>
<P>
The kind of unusual merchandise the area displays is at The Kooky Shop (Corso 
di Porta Ticinese 16). This youth-oriented showcase of Italian ultra-chic punk 
features a lot of leather, mostly sleek and form-revealing. There are 
miniskirts (about $50 U.S.) with high-tech zippers and halter tops (about $48) 
to match. Also a lot of clinging, silk, jersey leggings and tops (about $40 
each) in wild tiger, leopard and other animal skin patterns. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Popular Cotton Fabrics 
</P>
<P>
Naj Oleari (No. 58), the chain of faddish fabric, accessories and clothing 
stores, was one of the first retailers to move into the Porta Ticinese area and 
was a key factor in the district's gentrification. 
</P>
<P>
Like the other Naj Oleari outlets throughout Italy, this shop sells book bags 
($50), deck chairs ($125), umbrellas ($60), sneakers ($60), eyeglasses cases 
($20), place mats ($50 per set of four), lamp shades ($60 and up), quilts ($500 
and up), picture frames ($18 and up) and notebooks ($15 and up), all made from 
the company's popular 100% cotton fabrics. 
</P>
<P>
Naj Oleari is a bit like the Italian edition of Laura Ashley, Pierre Deux or 
Marimekko, except that this company's cheerful patterns are all hand-drawn by 
artists rather than stamped with blocks, and aren't floral or geometric designs 
so much as naive-style airplanes, clouds, palm trees and eyeglasses, all on 
very colorful backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
The shop also sells a limited selection of adult and children's clothing, plus 
uncut chintz and quilted and plastic laminated fabrics. Not all of the 
company's 700 fabric patterns are available at this shop. 
</P>
<P>
Lo Gnomo (No. 70) shows and sells a wide variety of handbags, carryalls and 
other personal accessories, made (mostly on the premises) of untanned leather 
and canvas by young artisans. The bags are big, bold and beautifully colored 
with bright, fashion-coordinated dyes. 
</P>
<P>
The unusual multipocketed knapsacks are especially popular with school kids. 
Prices begin at about $40. There are also wide belts with well-done clasps ($40 
and up) and stylish sandals ($70 and up). 
</P>
<P>
Prem Legnodipinto (No. 76) is a young artist who makes and sells her own 
charming and amusing hand-painted wooden jewelry and accessories. Most unusual 
and whimsical are tiny earrings ($35 and up) shaped like flowers, airplanes, 
sea horses, birds, ice cream cones, polka-dot bows, dancing dolls and an 
assortment of other items. 
</P>
<P>
Each pair of these decorative accessories is carefully painted with bright, 
colorful details. Also popular are Prem's hand-painted wooden belt buckles 
attached to broad elasticized waistbands ($50). There are also nonwearables, 
including piggy banks, picture frames and clocks. 
</P>
<P>
High Tech (No. 77), as the name states, has ultra-modern accessories and 
furnishings for home and office. One of the two distinct sections is stocked 
with household goods, with an emphasis on kitchenwares selected for excellence 
by professional chefs. 
</P>
<P>
Included are Alessi's handsome stainless steel pots, Richard-Ginori's wonderful 
porcelains, copper pots and pans from France, plus an assortment of espresso 
makers and cutlery. The other section features gadgets, some of museum-quality 
design. 
</P>
<P>
There are clocks, razors, desk sets and pens, plus some electronic equipment 
and furniture, mostly of Italian design and manufacture. The striking display 
against sleek black walls emphasizes the design quality of these items, many of 
which have been exported to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shoes and Accessories 
</P>
<P>
Panca (No. 103) is a good source for stylish but inexpensive men's and women's 
shoes from $40 up. The seasonal collection includes all the fashionable colors 
in styles that are simple and versatile. There is always a pleasing selection 
of flats and pumps for women, loafers and oxfords for men. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, at Corso Genova 6, is Biffi, one of Milan's great multi-label boutiques 
for trendy men's and women's clothing, known for clever accessorizing and 
wardrobing. The selection of women's labels includes Alaia, Byblos, Yamamoto 
and others. For men, fashions are by C. P. Co., Allegri, Guido Pellegrini and 
others. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Biffi has its own line of ultra-modish garments and accessories 
including hats, scarfs and belts. Outfits from about $220 and up. The shop's 
open display is great for browsing and for trying to fit things together for 
individualized looks. 
</P>
<P>
Zeus, at Via Vegevano 8, is another super-stylish boutique and gallery with 
avant-garde clothing and home accessories, created by a group of young 
designers who work with the shop. A boutique features clothes, most of which 
are casual in mood and minimalist in style, but cut with varied angles in 
darkly dramatic and intriguing colors. Outfits $160 and up. 
</P>
<P>
The Zeus Gallery and Design Studio has gadgets, furniture and some art. Again, 
the style is sleek and minimalist, with an emphasis on the functional elements 
of an item, with great inventiveness and individuality in the design. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Break From Boutiques 
</P>
<P>
Coin, on Piazza Generale Cantore, is a five-story branch of Milan's popular 
department store, and offers a good contrast to the area's boutique 
environments. 
</P>
<P>
Merchandise is more general in style than that in the smaller shops and 
boutiques. But you'll still find some trendy and moderately priced Milan-style 
clothes and accessories mixed in with the more traditional ready-to-wear for 
men, women and children. 
</P>
<P>
There is always a fine selection of nicely detailed men's cotton shirts ($25 
and up) and woolen sweaters ($40 and up) in very modish colors. 
</P>
<P>
Bianca e Blu at Via de Amicis No. 53 shows a distinctly different profile in 
the middle of high-tech Milan. Designer Monica Bolzoni uses antique fabrics and 
silhouettes from the 1940s to create her line of women's clothes, which are 
often featured on the pages of top European fashion magazines. 
</P>
<P>
The look is fun and feminine. Dresses sell for about $180 and up, chic hats, 
belts and scarfs to match. A few doors down the street is another Monica 
Bolzoni boutique featuring the designer's line of jersey knits and sale items 
from the main store. 
</P>
<P>
Next door at Via de Amicis No. 51, Franco Fiorentino sells comfortable casual 
shoes and matching handbags in latest styles and colors. The shoes, from about 
$35 and up, are excellent buys. 
</P>
<P>

THE MATURE TRAVELER: BRITISH AIRWAYS' NEW PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL HUGHES, Hughes is a 30-year veteran travel writer living in Sherman 
Oaks. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
British Airways has announced two new programs for the mature traveler age 60 
and over. One is a comprehensive membership program with discounts and many 
other advantages, the other a basic senior economy-class fare to London. 
</P>
<P>
Both are good and well-intended, but the joint announcement has caused 
confusion that will take some weighing of options and restrictions as to which 
is best. 
</P>
<P>
The airline's "Privileged Traveler Program" offers free membership and provides 
10% savings on all air fares between the United States and Great Britain, from 
advance purchase economy to first-class, even for flights on the Concorde. 
There are other advantages and services (more on those later). 
</P>
<P>
The 10% discount is not applicable to the new low senior fare that is open to 
all mature travelers age 60 and over and does not require membership. 
</P>
<P>
Another major factor to consider is that the membership program includes a 
waiver on all penalties for pre-trip cancellations or changes of reservations 
on any flights except the new senior fares. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Savings and Restrictions 
</P>
<P>
The complications come with the airline's new senior fares, which provide up to 
30% off the normal APEX fare. They provide bigger savings than the 10% 
discount, but have some major restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
To wit: The regular 21-day advance purchase economy round-trip West Coast fare 
to London is $698. Privileged Traveler members would get 10% off, or $629, and 
no restrictions and a waiver on penalties. 
</P>
<P>
BA's new senior fare on the same route is a 14-day advance purchase economy 
round trip of just $549 on the same route, probably even the same plane. That 
rate will be available only through March when it will still be discounted, but 
less so. 
</P>
<P>
The $549 fare has restrictions, the biggest being a $75 charge if the ticket is 
canceled or changed during the 14-day period. (This can be returned upon proof 
of illness from a doctor.) 
</P>
<P>
It is also limited to travel to London Sunday through Wednesday, returning 
Monday through Thursday. Again, the Privileged Traveler discounted $629 fare 
has no such restriction. 
</P>
<P>
One other point: Both the new senior fare and the Privileged Traveler program 
allow the passenger to take along a companion 50 or older at the same price, as 
long as they travel on the same itinerary. This doubles the pleasure but also 
doubles the possibilities of penalties, if one or the other has to cancel or 
change plans using the lower $549 fare. 
</P>
<P>
Your travel agent can explain finer points about taking out cancellation 
insurance and whether the saving from the lower fare could be wiped out by 
requiring an extra day's hotel stay to join a tour. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, the mature traveler would be wise to sign up for the Preferred 
Traveler Program anyway. It is free before April 30. Even then, applications or 
membership renewals of $10 will be waived if the member flies on British 
Airways during the life of the card. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Listing Advantages 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the 10% across-the-board savings on all BA air fares to Great 
Britain for the member and companion, and the waiver on penalties for pre-trip 
cancellations or changes, other advantages include: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A 10% saving on hundreds of land arrangements offered in British Airways' 
130-page "Holidays London Plus" brochure, including evening tours of London, 
theater, sightseeing and hotels, plus two- to four-day excursions through Great 
Britain and longer tours of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Similar 10% discounts on the Venice-Simplon Orient Express, and selected 
sailings on Cunard cruises aboard the Vistafjord and QE 2. 
</P>
<P>
Preferred Travelers will be able to check in at the airline's Club Class 
windows rather than the longer-wait economy class check-in; get a membership 
card and be in BA's computer files for meal preferences, seats and medical 
assistance, and have access to a special phone number for BA reservations and 
information. 
</P>
<P>
Preferred Traveler brochures, applications and more information can be obtained 
through travel agents or by calling British Airways toll-free at (800) AIRWAYS.

HER WORLD: LIVING IN FANTASY STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH MORGAN, Morgan, of La Jolla, is a magazine and newspaper writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Somewhere in the dark of Alaska, George Mason is deep in fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
It happens every February. He sits near a fireplace in Anchorage and dreams of 
the South Pacific. Of being warm. Of being on an island. Of sitting in the sun 
by a lagoon and carving up papayas for lunch. 
</P>
<P>
But George will not leave Alaska, for that state is also his fantasy. He 
fulfilled a boyhood dream by moving there 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I grew up in San Francisco and I remember that in about the third or fourth 
grade there was a reading primer and in it was a story about a boy trapper in 
Alaska and I just became fixated." 
</P>
<P>
George was a teacher in a private school in the Bay Area, and each year he 
filled out applications to teach in Alaska. "Some years I even did interviews, 
but then I got bought off in San Francisco; I got a little more pay and took 
another step up the educational ladder." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Excuses Removed 
</P>
<P>
But finally, George knew the time had come. 
</P>
<P>
"Our ostrich ran away," he recalls. "Our dog got hit by a car and our house 
that we rented on the beach was sold. It seemed like all the signs were saying, 
'Go north, young man. Go north.' " 
</P>
<P>
The fantasy had always been Alaska or northern New Mexico -- two places of 
drama and mystery and adventure where, George thought, the land rules you. His 
wife favored New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"I said to my wife, 'OK, we'll be fair. We'll flip a coin: Anchorage or Santa 
Fe.' Then I cheated and told her it said Alaska. She was not thrilled. She was, 
in fact, in a panic. 
</P>
<P>
"She told me right before we left San Francisco that she would give it exactly 
365 days. She had this vision of Alaska as one large glacier, perhaps with a 
little stunted tree on it. We moved in February, which did not help. You can 
still see her claw marks along the Alcan Highway." 
</P>
<P>
George swears that within six months his wife fell in love with the open space 
and fresh air and the joy of discovering that everybody knows everybody in 
Alaska because the numbers of people are small and the attitude is friendly. 
</P>
<P>
She visited her sister in San Francisco that first summer and was astonished at 
the crowding and noise and city smells to which urban dwellers grow immune. 
</P>
<P>
George and his wife had been commuters in the Bay Area, driving an hour each 
way to work. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing unusual about that, but what happens is that it's a couple of 
hours every day when you could be enjoying life," George said. "And you get 
tired of driving Monday through Friday, so you stay home on weekends. In 
Anchorage I'm just a few minutes from work. Every weekend we are off with the 
kids, fishing or camping or horseback riding. 
</P>
<P>
"We thrive on the out-of-doors. The activities here are much more intense 
because much of the rest of life is so simple. And we have those bonus hours 
that we used to spend in traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"In summertime we play baseball at midnight. In winter it's cross-country 
skiing. Each day seems full of opportunities and choices. You really live up 
here." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fantasies Are Good 
</P>
<P>
George believes that fantasies are good for people. They took him to Alaska. 
They allow him to escape through the snow to the South Pacific in February. And 
then there is his summer fantasy in which he and his wife leave Anchorage and 
homestead in the interior of Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
"But we're in our 40s now and I don't know if we have the kind of energy you 
need to homestead, or the wherewithal to put up with the kind of work you have 
to do to homestead. I have friends who do it. I know what's involved and how 
tough -- and rewarding -- it is. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe if they had some sort of intermediate step, like gentleman homesteader . 
. . wow! I could get into that in a minute." 
</P>
<P>
George's eyes glittered at the thought. He was silent for the first time since 
he sat down beside me on a tour boat called Klondike that was sailing toward 
glaciers in Prince William Sound. 
</P>
<P>
And what had I said to this tall, dark stranger to provoke such an impassioned 
revelation? 
</P>
<P>
I had asked what brought him to Alaska.

CRUISE VIEWS: VIEWING UPPER EGYPT FROM A BOAT ON THE NILE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

writers.

<DATELINE>
<P>
DENDERA, Egypt 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Early morning rituals along the Nile haven't changed much in 4,000 years. From 
our boat we watched a woman carefully pick her way down the muddy bank, 
carrying an earthenware water jug over a shoulder, just like those used in 
2,000 BC in the temple reliefs. 
</P>
<P>
At the first rays of the rising sun a flurry of white egrets flapped out of the 
trees. Fishermen poled their triangular-sailed feluccas out into the river and 
unfurled their nets, then began to shout and beat their hands against the sides 
of the wooden boats, flailing the surface of the water with their oars to 
stampede the fish. 
</P>
<P>
On the bank a man washed in preparation for his prayers, then unfolded a square 
piece of cloth and kneeled facing Mecca. Curious children came down to the 
steps to watch our boat tie up, rubbing the sleep from their eyes. 
</P>
<P>
We arrived at this river landing outside Dendera, near Luxor, on Abercrombie 
&amp; Kent's 44-passenger Sun Boat, one of the smallest, newest and most 
luxurious vessels of the nearly 100 that cruise the Nile. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seeing the Sights 
</P>
<P>
A cruise boat is the most comfortable way, perhaps the only feasible one, to 
visit the great temples and tombs of the Pharaohs in Upper Egypt. A few of 
them, such as the magnificent temple of Horus at Edfu and the two-god temple at 
Kom Ombo, are only a short walk or carriage ride from the river. 
</P>
<P>
Even better, the air-conditioned interior and breezy deck of the Sun Boat 
provide a welcome respite from the dust and flies, heat and traffic that are 
facts of life in modern Egypt. Even in October, considered the best month for 
weather, it is sunny, hot and dry, with a parching wind that blows from the 
desert. 
</P>
<P>
Our group of 18 on this Nile Discoverer itinerary have our own Egyptologist, 
Mona Saleh, a striking and dynamic woman who doubles as guide, shopping 
negotiator and den mother. 
</P>
<P>
"You must drink at least three liters of water a day to keep from getting 
dehydrated," she said. So each of us dutifully clutched a plastic bottle of 
mineral water everywhere we went. 
</P>
<P>
We boarded the Sun Boat in Luxor the day before, after flying down from Cairo, 
then caroming in cabs past camel markets and adobe villages to stand awe-struck 
in the avenue of the sphinxes outside the vast Temple of Karnak. 
</P>
<P>
(Movie fans would recognize it, especially the hypostyle hall with its 134 
columns, from the film of Agatha Christie's "Death on the Nile.") 
</P>
<P>
In town the temple of Luxor, surrounded by urban traffic, is visibly 
deteriorating, according to Mona, who takes a tour through it every month. "It 
will not last another century," she says. 
</P>
<P>
The forecast is even worse for the temple at Edfu, where sewage from the slums 
crowding against it flow into the ground and seep up into the sandstone and 
limestone temple, making it crumble at the touch of a finger . . . and many 
fingers test it. 
</P>
<P>
The day before our visit, we were told, 4,000 Egyptian (about $1,735 U.S.) of 
entrance fees were collected, but none of it seems to be diverted toward 
relocating the squatters and saving the temple. 
</P>
<P>
Other days included a trek to the tomb of Tutankhamen, a bus to the Aswan High 
Dam, a flight to world-famous Abu Simbel, a boat ride to the relocated island 
temple of Philae and a felucca cruise on the Upper Nile. Tour participants 
spend several days in Cairo at the beginning and end of the cruise seeing the 
Pyramids, Sphinx and Egyptian Museum. 
</P>
<P>
Sun Boat I has 22 comfortable, air-conditioned, nicely decorated cabins with 
big windows for watching the river scenery go by and, we felt, better food and 
service than in the leading land hotels. The housekeeping and maintenance is 
also good. 
</P>
<P>
We recommend the deluxe cabins on the two upper decks over the state cabins on 
the lower deck, because noise from the engines seeps into the latter, in 101 
and 102 especially. 
</P>
<P>
The suggested tip for the five-day trip for two is $25, which is pooled and 
divided among the 40-man Egyptian staff. There is a bar, a modest-size swimming 
pool and an upper deck with chairs and loungers in both sun and shade. 
</P>
<P>
Meals are single-sitting, with a fixed menu of soup, first course, main course 
and dessert for lunch and dinner, along with a daily breakfast buffet and 
afternoon tea. Vegetarian cuisine is available by advance request. The chef 
proved especially skillful at cheese and dessert souffles. 
</P>
<P>
Abercrombie &amp; Kent's 12-day Nile Discoverer and the similar 11-day Nile 
Explorer offer small-group year-round departures at seasonal prices from $1,390 
to $1,990 per person, double occupancy, plus $929 to $999 for round-trip air 
fare aboard British Airways' New York City-to-Cairo service via London. Air 
fare in Egypt is an additional $215. 
</P>
<P>
Bear in mind that a Nile cruise should not be compared to a Caribbean or 
Mediterranean cruise. It is much more akin to expedition sailing, where the 
emphasis is on the sightseeing, some of it arduous, rather than relaxation and 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
Some tips for the trip: Take lightweight, launderable cotton clothing, a sun 
hat, strong sunblock, insect repellent and sturdy, practical walking shoes. 
Except when sunbathing or swimming on the boat, dress modestly but comfortably. 
</P>
<P>
Women should not wear shorts or halters ashore. Slacks are quite acceptable. 
You won't need the dressy clothing you would normally carry for a cruise. 
</P>
<P>
While water on the Nile cruise vessels is said to be filtered, it is wise to 
avoid it entirely for drinking, toothbrushing or as ice cubes. (We heard about 
three people in another group who got ill after going to church and taking 
communion.) Sealed bottles of chilled mineral water are available almost 
everywhere and are provided free on the Sun Boat. 
</P>
<P>
Whether on the ship, on shore or in the best hotels, avoid raw vegetables and 
salads and any fresh fruit you cannot peel yourself. Egyptian beer is quite 
good and inexpensive, but we found most of the local wines undrinkable and 
imported ones very costly. 
</P>
<P>
Take care not to overexert yourself, especially in the Valley of the Kings and 
the tomb sites, as heat exhaustion also can lead to illness. 
</P>
<P>
We would not recommend this tour for children younger than 12, for the elderly 
with chronic health problems or anyone who has difficulty walking up or down 
stairs.

The Jerry Payne who wrote that beautiful article in the Travel Section should 
at least do a travel book. I read all of Henry David Thoreau's books, even his 
fiction, and I may be personally prejudiced, but Payne has far more talent and 
a far greater flair for human interest. Such talent should be used.

I just want to let you know how much I enjoyed reading about Jersey and how 
much I enjoyed the aesthetics of the page itself. I particularly liked the 
personal touch Payne gave to his story. How nice it is to begin to get to know 
people as well as the places. With his parting message of good deeds coming 
back many years hence, a tear actually came to my eye.

Who is Payne? I turned to the Travel Section and read about two Irishmen 
gabbing in the middle of the night on the Isle of Jersey, instead of glancing 
at dry facts on the sights and hotel rates. That's what we all dream about when 
traveling -- getting close to the locals. And that seldom happens. So keep 
Payne at work, leading the life we dream of.

My wife and I were pleased to see the beautiful island of Jersey as your 
front-page feature (Jan. 15) until we read the article. We thought travel 
articles were supposed to describe the beauties and amenities of various spots, 
with a view to encouraging people to visit them. Jersey has many beauties and 
amenities, which we have enjoyed more than once, but there's nothing about its 
beauty and amenities in Jerry Payne's article. Perhaps Payne has done us a 
favor. Since no one who read the article would have any reason to consider 
visiting Jersey, it should remain unspoiled for those of us who have already 
enjoyed its many attractions. Thank you, Mr. Payne!

TAX EXCLUSION IN HOME SALES SAID TO BE VULNERABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID W. MYERS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
ATLANTA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The war between housing trade groups and some federal lawmakers over reducing 
tax breaks for home ownership appears to be shifting to a new battleground. 
</P>
<P>
For months, the nation's major realty trade associations -- from realtors to 
lenders -- have been publicly fretting that Congress may try to reduce the 
amount of deductions that homeowners can take for their mortgage-interest 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
Just last week, builders meeting here for their annual convention were saying 
that the deduction -- which costs the Treasury an estimated $35 billion 
annually -- is a tempting target for lawmakers who want to reduce the nation's 
huge budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Now, a growing number of Capitol Hill insiders are saying this sacrosanct 
deduction will emerge unscathed from any budget-reduction efforts. But its 
place on the bargaining table of Washington budget-cutters has been taken by 
another cherished tax write-off: The $125,000, one-time exclusion on resale 
profits for sellers who are 55 or older. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Put Into Play 
</P>
<P>
The exclusion "has definitely been put into play" by lawmakers looking for ways 
to cut the deficit, says a lobbyist from one major trade group. 
</P>
<P>
"We're pretty sure that (Congress) won't mess with the mortgage-interest 
deduction, because they've gotten a lot of negative feedback from the public," 
said the lobbyist, who asked not to be identified. "It helps everybody, and a 
lot of people couldn't afford to buy a house without it. 
</P>
<P>
"But the exclusion doesn't help anybody buy a home -- it just lets them keep 
more of the profits when they sell. It would be hard (for lawmakers) to say, 
'We don't have any money for housing programs, but we're going to keep giving 
equity-rich property owners this huge tax break.' " 
</P>
<P>
The lobbyist's comments essentially echoed remarks made by Congress' top expert 
on tax policy at a little-noticed conference a week earlier in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald A. Pearlman, whose Joint Committee on Taxation advises both the U.S. 
Senate and House, said he was "not aware" of any serious discussion on Capitol 
Hill about reducing mortgage-interest write-offs. 
</P>
<P>
"If anything is vulnerable" to cutbacks this year, Pearlman said, it's the 
$125,000 exclusion. Eliminating the exclusion would pump an estimated $4 
billion a year into the Treasury. 
</P>
<P>
However, Pearlman added, both the mortgage-interest deduction and the $125,000 
exclusion will probably emerge untouched from this year's budget-cutting 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Driesler, top lobbyist for the National Assn. of Realtors, said in a 
telephone interview from his Washington office that he, too, is now "cautiously 
optimistic" that the mortgage-interest deduction would be spared. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Kind of Surprising' 
</P>
<P>
"We're stopping a little bit short of saying that it's been taken off the 
bargaining table, but I must say it's looking good at this time." 
</P>
<P>
Driesler said Pearlman's remarks that the $125,000 exclusion may be vulnerable 
to budget-cutters "was kind of surprising, because it was the first time I 
heard it. But Mr. Pearlman is rather well-connected, so we'll have to keep our 
eyes open to see what happens next." 
</P>
<P>
If federal lawmakers make a serious attempt to eliminate or scale back the 
exclusion, Driesler said, they may have another fight on their hands with 
realtors and other trade groups. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a substantial number of people who are depending on their home equity 
to help them through their retirement years," Driesler said. "If you take a big 
chunk of that away in taxes, a lot of people are going to have a tough time 
making it on just their Social Security payments and maybe a private pension."

NEW PRESIDENT NAMES PANEL ON AFFORDABILITY

Affordability will be the major issue facing the nation's builders this year, 
according to Shirley McVay Wiseman, the new president of the National Assn. of 
Home Builders and the first woman to head the 157,000-member trade group. 
</P>
<P>
Wiseman, a home builder from Lexington, Ky., and Lake Wales, Fla., who worked 
in the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development from 1983 to 1985, said 
the NAHB has adopted as its theme this year: "Where Will Our Children Live?" 
The theme was borrowed -- with permission -- from Merrill Butler, the Irvine, 
Calif., builder who served as NAHB president in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Appointed Task Force 
</P>
<P>
"Moderate- and middle-income families, the best-housed people on Earth, are 
discovering that, for their children, the dream of owning a home is now turning 
into a nightmare," Wiseman said. "Of the nearly 59 million Americans who are 
in, or who will be entering, their prime home buying ages during the next four 
years, fewer than half can expect to become homeowners." 
</P>
<P>
To address the affordability problem, Wiseman, who succeeded Dale Stuard of 
Newport Beach, Calif., has appointed a task force that will come up with short- 
and long-term ways to solve the problem. She emphasized that she doesn't want 
another report or white paper that will gather dust on shelves, but a concise 
list of ways and means to solve the nation's affordability crisis. 
</P>
<P>
In response to a question, Wiseman said the threat to the mortgage-interest 
deduction is real, not a ploy to trade for something else down the line when 
Congress begins tinkering with the tax laws. 
</P>
<P>
Stuard had said at his final press conference during the 45th annual NAHB 
convention at the Georgia World Congress Center here that threats to the 
mortgage-interest deduction are real in the wake of recent tax bills that have 
limited the deduction and have phased out the consumer interest deductions. 
There are many groups that want to eliminate the mortgage interest deduction, 
Stuard said. The deduction costs the U.S. treasury about $35 billion a year, 
Stuard said, making it a tempting target for Congress. 
</P>
<P>
He said he has received a pledge from President George Bush to protect the 
deduction. The first limit on the deduction was enacted in the 1986 tax bill, 
when it was limited to the interest on up to $1 million of combined first-and 
second-home debt. 
</P>
<P>
At another session of the four-day convention, the largest in the association's 
history, Rep. Raymond J. McGrath (R-N.Y.), a member of the House Ways and Means 
Committee, said the threat to the deduction is real. He suggested that the 
association should mount a strong campaign to defend the deduction. 
</P>
<P>
Rising land costs, increases in mortgage-interest rates and the affordability 
issue are among the problems that builders, polled during the convention, 
expect to affect the housing industry in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
In general, builders expect housing activity in 1989 to be slightly below 1988 
levels, when 1,487,200 housing units were produced. The official NAHB 
prediction is for a 7.2% decline this year, to 1,380,000 starts, with 1,010,000 
single-family houses, down 6.5% from 1988, and 370,000 multifamily units, down 
9.1% from 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The poll of the 705 persons during the convention was heavily weighted toward 
the South, with 39%, and the Midwest, with 34%, with only 9% from the West, 
according to Kent Colton, NAHB executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
More than half of those surveyed said they expected mortgage-interest rates to 
increase somewhat during 1989. The association has projected that rates could 
reach as high as 12% by midyear, possibly drifting downward toward the end of 
the year. More than three-fourths of those polled expected housing starts to be 
about the same or somewhat less than in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Housing Industry Problems 
</P>
<P>
Of the many problems facing the nation's economy, 54% of those polled ranked 
the federal deficit as the major problem, followed by 25% who thought interest 
rate increases were the top problem. 
</P>
<P>
Of the problems facing the housing industry, builders were most concerned about 
the cost of land (34%), followed by interest rates (29%) and government 
regulations (16%). Builders reported that housing affordability has become a 
very serious (47%) or somewhat serious (40] problem for first-time buyers. 
</P>
<P>
Remodeling, once the poor relative of the building industry, has become a major 
factor in recent conventions, with this convention showing the most attention 
paid to this $100-billion-a-year industry, Colton said. Of those polled during 
the convention, 71% said that remodeling activity would be "fair or good to 
excellent" in 1989. Colton said that remodeling activity is expected to reach 
$105 billion to $110 billion this year, up sharply from $70 billion in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Today's affluent homeowners are willing to travel farther to work to get the 
larger, more elaborate houses they want when they move up from their current 
ones, according to yet another survey released at the convention. This one is 
based on 1,776 homeowners who have purchased houses insured by the Home Owners 
Warranty (HOW) program since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dream Seems Attainable 
</P>
<P>
These affluent baby-boomers plan to buy a house with about 2,360 square feet -- 
about 30% larger than their current homes -- with a median price of $125,000. 
About 16% plan to spend $200,000 or more for that move-up dream home. With a 
median household income of $53,412 -- 20% of the respondents made $75,000 or 
more -- the dream of moving up seems attainable. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, cited and praised the 
stability of the past six years in the economy in general and the housing 
industry in particular in a speech to the association's board of directors on 
the final day of the convention. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan said the past six years have seen single-family starts at or slightly 
above the 1 million per year mark, consistent with demographic trends, such as 
household formations, which are averaging 1.5 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Greenspan's half-hour address was positive, but he also cited the 
nation's declining home ownership rate -- this decade is the first to see the 
ownership rate decline (currently about 64% contrasted with the peak of 65.4% 
in 1981) -- and the sharp division between the generally affluent homeowners 
and all too often poor renters. 
</P>
<P>
Renters typically earn less than 60% of what homeowners make and the gap is 
widening, he said. Builders must address the problems of affordability, 
including constructing more affordable rental units in the face of tax laws 
that discourage such construction, but Greenspan promised that the Federal 
Reserve Board will do its best to ensure continued financial stability. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed chairman said that major growth areas of the building industry in the 
next few years will be remodeling and construction of move-up houses, along 
with a growing market share (currently about 5%) in the second-home market.

DICK TURPIN: NEW BUILDER CHIEF A 'DOER 
</P>

<P>
For the first time ever, the nation's rough-and-tumble hard-hat housing 
industry will be headed by an assertive woman home builder from Lexington, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
Selected as the 50th president of the influential National Assn. of Home 
Builders at their Atlanta convention last week, Shirley McVay Wiseman has been 
in the building business for two decades, overseeing the construction of 
residential and commercial developments in Kentucky and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, she has served various stints with the Department of Housing and 
Urban Development, the Small Business Administration and a Social Security task 
force. Recently, she was appointed to the Florida Developmental Disabilities 
Council by Florida's Gov. Bob Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
Locally, the brisk, fiftyish builder founded Lexington (Ky.) Housing for the 
Handicapped, served as an adviser to the Urban League and served on the 
Executive Committee to Insure Good Government. She founded the local Home 
Owners Warranty Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Her record is that of a doer and pragmatist but not a bleeding heart. 
</P>
<P>
She spoke rapidly about the many issues confronting her as NAHB president 
during a sneak, one-on-one interview between action on resolutions by the 
group's board of directors. In a corridor of the vast Omni arena adjacent to 
the convention in the Georgia World Congress Center, Wiseman cited these 
principal concerns: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The homeless: So many people are just "one paycheck away from being 
homeless." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Congressional threat to eliminate mortgage-interest deduction: President 
Bush told her it won't happen. (The NAHB, the Mortgage Bankers Assn., and the 
National Assn. of Realtors will all fight the possibility of change, she said.) 
</P>
<P>
 -- Parental aid in home buying: There will have to be more of it. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Affordability: Government agencies can and should do more to help would-be 
home buyers qualify for loans. 
</P>
<P>
 -- No white paper: That's the last thing she wants from a task force she has 
just appointed to focus on affordability of homes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Housing for the handicapped: More availability for them. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Frustration: Knowing that the industry has a product the public wants but 
can't provide affordably because of countless regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Wiseman is not all surprised that she has attained the top spot in the home 
building industry's trade group that has 157,000 members, predominantly male. 
After all, she has built more than 1,500 single-family homes and apartment 
complexes and developed commercial property and a shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
She heads the Wiseman Construction &amp; Development Co. Inc., of Lexington and 
Wiseman Homes of Lake Wales, Fla., During her year in office, a son, Larry, 38, 
will manage the firms. She also has a daughter, Sherri. 
</P>
<P>
She will be traveling extensively but has already traveled far and wide and 
abroad delivering her message of the need to provide decent, affordable homes. 
One of her favorite expressions is "building homes for our families is no 
ordinary profession." 
</P>
<P>
Wiseman has been active in local, state and national home building 
organizations during her 20-year career and has been honored as a local and 
state "Builder of the Year." 
</P>
<P>
In the NAHB, she has served as a national vice president, member of the group's 
executive committee, chaired the membership committee and became a life 
director in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
She was equally active in local and state NAHB affiliates, as a director of the 
Home Builders Assn. of Kentucky, served or chaired a number of its committees 
and was named the "Builder of the Year" by the Lexington affiliate in 1978 and 
given the same honor by the state association in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Sumichrast, a nationally respected housing analyst and former NAHB 
economist, succinctly assessed the elevation of Wiseman to the presidency of 
the powerful organization. 
</P>
<P>
Personally, acquainted with her work, dedication and verve -- and alluding to 
the progressive changes which have taken place in the tumultuous industry -- he 
said: 
</P>
<P>
"Ten years ago, no way she (or any other woman) could have been named 
president. Today, she knows the government people and bureaucrats and how they 
work. She will do well."

HOME IMPROVEMENT: TUB COVER-UP FIRM SEES L.A. AS FERTILE AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID M. KINCHEN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jay Shachter is in the cover-up business in a big way -- and he wants to get a 
whole lot bigger. 
</P>
<P>
He's president of L.A. Bathtub Liners, a Huntington Beach-based firm he founded 
in 1983 with David Mickel, currently the company's vice president for sales and 
marketing. Shachter, a Chicago native who has lived in Michigan and Florida -- 
and has installed bathtub liners in almost every state -- wants to install 
high-impact acrylic liners over the millions of worn-out bathtubs in the 
Southland. 
</P>
<P>
"The housing stock of the greater Los Angeles area is just the right age for a 
firm that specializes in refurbishing bathtubs and our method is the best and 
most economical one," he says, without any false modesty. 
</P>
<P>
At a Westchester house, Shachter and his installer, younger brother Jack, 
showed how quick and painless the installation is. Rather than spending upwards 
of $2,000 ripping out old porcelain tubs that have been scoured clean once too 
often, or spending several hundred dollars refinishing the existing tub, a 
homeowner -- or apartment owner, or motel owner -- can have a new-looking tub 
in less than two hours for an average cost of about $500 for a typical 
5-foot-long tub. 
</P>
<P>
"Our best customers are those who have tried the refinishing route, and found 
that the coating lasts only a few months," Jay Shachter said. "We have hundreds 
of molds available from a factory in Arizona that has tracked down tubs from 
everywhere, so the chances are excellent that we can match virtually any style 
of tub in Southern California, giving every customer an exact fit." 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, most of his firm's business was installing liners over tubs in 
hotels and motels; in an effort to reduce the company's dependence on one type 
of customer and in response to a slump in hospitality industry work, Shachter 
expanded into residential installations. Residential work now accounts for 80% 
of the company's activity. 
</P>
<P>
Why, if a 5-foot tub can be purchased for $100 to $200, is it so expensive to 
just replace the worn tub with a fresh new one? 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult to remove the old tub without damaging the tiles around it," 
Shachter said. "Plumbers don't come cheap and old pipes can be easily damaged 
if a tub is removed." 
</P>
<P>
After measurements are transferred from the bathroom to the liner, the 
installer uses a portable jigsaw to trim it to fit. The old tub is cleaned with 
acetone and a rubber-based solid adhesive is applied around the perimeter of 
the tub and the drain and faucet areas. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the secret of our success -- what we call our gasket system," Shachter 
said. "If we didn't do this, water would seep in between the old tub and the 
liner." 
</P>
<P>
The liner is hoisted into place, pressed down to make it stick to the cement 
and the hardware is replaced. Caulking is applied and the job is done. The tub 
can be used after a few hours.

ARIZONA LAWSUIT COULD AFFECT FATE OF PHOTO RADAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ASHLEY DUNN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An angry Arizona motorist and the American Civil Liberties Union are 
challenging the use of photo radar in a plea to the Arizona Supreme Court that 
could be a harbinger of similar challenges in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
A petition was filed by Phoenix resident Roseanne Cortright, who was 
photographed by the device as she drove through nearby Paradise Valley, Ariz., 
the only other city in the United States to use the machine. 
</P>
<P>
Aided by five attorneys from the Phoenix area who have donated their services, 
Cortright is arguing that use of photo radar is illegal and unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
The court is tentatively scheduled to decide on Feb. 15 whether to hear the 
case. If it does, it would be the first case in the country involving photo 
radar to reach the appellate level. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We're Going to Fight' 
</P>
<P>
"Do we want robocop? Do we want a country where machines decide if we're 
driving reasonably?" asked David D. White, the lead attorney in the case. 
"We're going to fight this to the end." 
</P>
<P>
The resolution of the case in Arizona will probably have a limited effect on 
the legal debate over the use of photo radar in Pasadena because an Arizona 
court decision would have no legal bearing in California, said Thomas D. Hogue, 
an attorney who successfully argued a photo radar case in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
But he said an affirmative decision in Arizona could help by outlining a legal 
strategy that could be used in Pasadena. It could also act to encourage or 
discourage more legal challenges here. 
</P>
<P>
Photo radar is a device that combines a camera, microcomputer and traffic radar 
to monitor the speed of traffic. It automatically snaps a picture of any 
vehicle traveling faster than a pre-set speed limit. 
</P>
<P>
The photograph, which includes the vehicle's license plate number and the 
driver's face, is used to produce a speeding ticket that is later mailed to the 
registered owner of the car. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Used in Europe, Asia 
</P>
<P>
The Swiss-built device has been used for years in Europe and Asia, but it has 
appeared in the United States in the last year and a half. 
</P>
<P>
In that period, it has issued more than 14,300 speeding tickets in Pasadena and 
Paradise Valley, and inspired a steady stream of controversy. 
</P>
<P>
A number of Pasadena motorists have challenged their tickets in court, but the 
only major victory came in a case argued by Hogue. The judge ruled that the 
police car containing the photo radar was painted the wrong color. The ruling 
resulted in the dismissal of more than 900 tickets and the car has since been 
repainted to comply with state requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the controversy, Pasadena officials have been pleased with photo radar 
and began tests last week of a similar photo device to catch motorists who run 
red lights. 
</P>
<P>
Paradise Valley was the first city in the country to use the photo radar to 
catch speeders, beginning in October, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
There have been nearly 100 trials in disputes over photo radar tickets at the 
local court level in Paradise Valley, with most motorists losing their cases. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$60 Speeding Ticket 
</P>
<P>
Cortright, a law firm receptionist, was photographed by the machine last August 
and received a $60 speeding ticket in the mail a few weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike most drivers who simply paid their fines, Cortright decided to 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
She asked White to be her attorney, and he was soon joined by other irate 
lawyers and the ACLU. Efforts to reach ACLU officials in Arizona were 
unsuccessful, but White said the group is involved in the case because of 
concerns over the photo radar's infringement of individual rights. 
</P>
<P>
Cortright is challenging the use of the machine on grounds that it is a 
violation of an individual's constitutional right to due process. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike an ordinary speeding ticket in which drivers are stopped by an officer, 
photo radar citations are mailed to the registered owner of the car days and 
even weeks after the incident has occurred. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Adequate Defense 
</P>
<P>
White said the result is that drivers may not remember the circumstances of the 
incident and would be deprived of the ability to mount an adequate defense. 
</P>
<P>
The circumstances are important because in Arizona, as well as Pasadena, 
drivers can only be convicted of speeding if they exceed what is considered a 
"reasonable and prudent" speed. In both states, drivers are allowed to go above 
or below the posted speed limit, depending on road conditions. 
</P>
<P>
For example, on foggy days with very poor visibility, a driver could be cited 
for speeding even though he did not exceed the posted speed limit. Similarly, a 
driver could exceed the limit if visibility is good and there are no other 
vehicles on the road. 
</P>
<P>
"How can you prepare a defense if you can't remember what happened?" White 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
He said use of the photo radar is also unconstitutional because the registered 
owner of the vehicle is held responsible, even though someone else may have 
been driving the car. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Innocent Until Guilty 
</P>
<P>
Registered owners in both cities can have photo radar tickets dismissed by 
proving they are not the driver in the photograph. 
</P>
<P>
But White said the city has no legal right to cite the registered owner in the 
first place. 
</P>
<P>
"In this country, we're supposed to be innocent until proven guilty," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Charles G. Ollinger, town attorney in Paradise Valley, rejected White's 
arguments as unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
He said mailing tickets after an incident has occurred does not deprive drivers 
of the chance to defend themselves. For example, he said, robbery suspects are 
routinely arrested weeks or even months after a crime has occurred. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Trivial' Infringement 
</P>
<P>
He added that holding the registered owner of a car responsible for a ticket is 
no different than the way parking tickets are handled. 
</P>
<P>
Ollinger said that even if there was some infringement of an individual's 
rights, it would be "so trivial compared to the interests of the people of the 
state in enforcing traffic rules."

ALHAMBRA, S. PASADENA AT ODDS OVER PROPOSALS; 
</P>
<P>
TWO CITIES PONDER LIGHT-RAIL ROUTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE WARD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alhambra and South Pasadena, which have long been at odds over construction of 
the Long Beach Freeway, are now in disagreement over the route of a proposed 
light-rail line from downtown Los Angeles toward Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
The South Pasadena City Council has endorsed a route that would run trolley 
cars to South Pasadena along the Santa Fe railroad tracks through Highland 
Park. Alhambra officials favor a route along Main Street in Los Angeles through 
El Sereno that would tie in with the proposed extension of the Long Beach 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Both routes are under consideration by the Los Angeles County Transportation 
Commission, which will decide later this year whether to build at least part of 
the Los Angeles-Pasadena line in the next decade. But first the commission must 
select the route to Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Alhambra City Manager Kevin Murphy said the proposed route through El Sereno 
would be cheaper to build and better serve his city, which is heavily dependent 
on public transportation. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the better choice," said Murphy. "It's shorter. It's cheaper. What more 
do you want?" 
</P>
<P>
But South Pasadena City Manager John Bernardi said a rail line running through 
El Sereno and then northward along the Long Beach Freeway corridor through the 
heart of his city would be as objectionable as the freeway extension 
itself.South Pasadena has resisted such a rail line for decades to the dismay 
of Alhambra and other neighboring cities who want the freeway built quickly to 
ease traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi said that combining the rail line with the freeway would be acceptable 
only if the state replaces its proposed freeway route through the center of 
South Pasadena with the city's proposed westerly alignment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Assurance Is Sought 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi said the city will ask the county Transportation Commission to look at 
the westerly alignment as an alternative. While the city is on record in 
support of the proposed route along the Santa Fe tracks, Bernardi said, there 
are a number of issues to be resolved, including the placement of stations. He 
said the city also wants assurance that the line will not end in South 
Pasadena, but in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
The Transportation Commission has circulated a draft environmental impact 
report on the alternate routes up to South Pasadena and El Sereno, but the 
choice of a route through Pasadena rests with that city's Board of Directors. 
The commission and the city are jointly funding studies on the Pasadena 
alignment. The city board is expected to adopt a route this summer. 
</P>
<P>
The Pasadena-Los Angeles line is an extension of a trolley line between Los 
Angeles and Long Beach that is scheduled to begin service in the middle of 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trolley Cars in Pasadena 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena officials said they are not taking a position on what route the 
trolley line should take outside Pasadena, but a city task force has 
recommended that the line enter the city limits along the Santa Fe railroad 
tracks, rather than the Long Beach Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Trolley cars would proceed north in Pasadena along the railroad right-of-way 
and then either veer east through the downtown area, or remain in the Santa Fe 
right-of-way and travel east in the middle of the Foothill Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas C. Reilly, city transit and commuter services coordinator, said there 
are advantages to each pathway. Placing the line along the freeway might serve 
commuters well and avoid disrupting downtown, but bringing the line along city 
streets could stimulate business and bring passengers closer to a variety of 
shopping and entertainment destinations. 
</P>
<P>
Two routes have been proposed on Pasadena streets. One plan would turn Green 
Street into a transit mall, with trolley lines in both directions. Another 
plan, called the Green-Colorado Couplet, would put the eastbound line on Green 
Street and the westbound line on Colorado Boulevard from the Santa Fe 
right-of-way to Hill Street. Both routes would go north on Hill to a railroad 
spur near Walnut Street and then eastward to a terminal in the vicinity of 
Rosemead Boulevard and Sierra Madre Villa. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon Bagby, chairman of the city's rail alignment task force, said support is 
developing for both the freeway and downtown alternatives, and he may propose a 
compromise route that would combine elements of the two. His hope, he said, is 
that the task force can reach agreement and recommend a route to the Board of 
Directors this spring. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
As Soon as Possible 
</P>
<P>
After making its decision, the board will urge the Transportation Commission to 
schedule construction as soon as possible. Pasadena officials hope that the Los 
Angeles-Pasadena line will be seen by the Transportation Commission as less 
controversial and easier to build then lines elsewhere in the county, and that 
the commission will push it ahead of other projects. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very important to get the Pasadena-San Gabriel Valley line funded and 
built," said Pasadena Mayor William E. Thomson Jr. "I don't care how many buses 
you put on the street or how often they run, (a bus system) is not nearly as 
efficient in moving people as rail transportation." 
</P>
<P>
Thomson said the city hopes to advance construction of the line by enlisting 
the support of other cities that could be served by it. The Transportation 
Commission is funding trolley lines with revenue from a half-cent sales tax 
approved by county voters in 1980. The proposition enacting the tax called for 
a rail line extending eastward only as far as Pasadena. Thomson said Pasadena 
would back state legislation or other steps necessary to push the line farther 
east. 
</P>
<P>
"Our hope is that we can have this become the San Gabriel Valley line and gain 
the support of Arcadia, Monrovia and cities to the east of us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Transportation Commission expects to have $800 million to spend on new 
light-rail projects through the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Alternate Routes Studied 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the line to Pasadena, the Transportation Commission is studying 
routes in the San Fernando Valley and along the coast, between the Century 
Freeway in El Segundo and Marina del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
The money that will be available through the end of this century is not enough 
to build all the lines. In fact, Susan Rosales, senior rail development 
planner, said it would cost $590 million to $750 million just to build the 
portion of the Pasadena line between downtown Los Angeles and South Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
The first leg of the project would carry the line in a subway through downtown 
Los Angeles, starting at a transit station at 7th and Flower streets where the 
line to Long Beach begins. The line could run northward in a subway under 
Flower and Hope streets or follow Flower to 2nd Street, then run under 2nd and 
turn northward to run under Los Angeles Street. Both proposed routes would go 
under the Santa Ana Freeway and then either to North Broadway or Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
From Broadway, the line would go above ground to travel at grade on the Santa 
Fe Railroad tracks through Highland Park to South Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
The alternative route would take the line above ground along Main Street 
through Lincoln Heights and then down the middle of Huntington Drive in El 
Sereno to the proposed path of the Long Beach Freeway extension. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
50,000 Daily Passengers 
</P>
<P>
Rosales said the Highland Park route is about eight miles long and would cost 
$650 million to $750 million. The El Sereno alignment covers seven miles and 
would cost $590 million to $650 million. 
</P>
<P>
Rosales said ridership studies indicate that the routes would carry from 45,000 
to 50,000 passengers a day. The trip from South Pasadena to downtown Los 
Angeles would take about 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Thomson said Pasadena's preference for the Santa Fe railroad right-of-way 
stems from concern that the project will get bogged down by the controversy, 
now 25 years old, of extending the Long Beach freeway through South Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Using the Santa Fe route "is far more appealing from our perspective than to 
wait for the Long Beach Freeway to have a route chosen and a freeway built," 
Thomson said. 
</P>
<P>
But Alhambra's Murphy said he believes the Long Beach Freeway issue, including 
any legal challenges after the proposed route receives final state and federal 
approval, will be resolved within a few years, well before the rail line is 
built. 
</P>
<P>
"It can't be stalled forever," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Use of Right of Way 
</P>
<P>
Use of the Santa Fe right-of-way also has its uncertainties. Santa Fe has 
declared an interest in selling the right-of-way, but only on condition that 
the buyer purchase the entire length from Los Angeles to San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Pete Schabarum has suggested that the full right-of-way could be 
used for a commuter train. His press deputy, Judy Hammond, said the county is 
establishing criteria for appraising the right-of-way and is beginning to look 
at methods of financing commuter-rail service. She said Schabarum intends to 
contact elected officials of San Bernardino County and cities along the 
right-of-way to determine their interest in the project. 
</P>
<P>
Rosales said it might be possible for commuter trains and trolley cars to share 
the right-of-way, or perhaps the commuter train could run between Pasadena and 
San Bernardino while trolley cars run between Los Angeles and Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
The Transportation Commission is accepting public comment on its environmental 
impact report on the light-rail routes between downtown Los Angeles and South 
Pasadena until Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The commission plans to make a decision by October on which light-rail routes 
to fund. Rosales said the commission could commit funds to all or part of the 
Pasadena line, but extending the line as far as Pasadena is probably at least 
10 years away.

FOR WORD-HERDER LARRY MCMURTRY, A NOVEL IS A TRAIL DRIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMUND NEWTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For a writer whose novels are often set under big Western skies and populated 
with ranchers and gunslingers, Larry McMurtry is strikingly bookish. Here's a 
man who, any day, would rather be nosing through dusty volumes than kicking sod 
on the prairie. 
</P>
<P>
Though he himself is the son of a West Texas rancher, McMurtry, whose Pulitzer 
Prize-winning epic "Lonesome Dove" will be serialized in four parts on CBS-TV 
starting Feb. 5, confessed the other night that he never quite got the hang of 
cowpoking. Early on, he acquired an antipathy to cattle. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Tremendously Indifferent' 
</P>
<P>
"As a child, I was tremendously indifferent to the comings and goings of these 
animals," McMurtry told a standing-room-only audience Wednesday in the Donald 
R. Wright Auditorium of the Pasadena Public Library. "As I got older, this was 
a puzzlement to my father, who could pick any of our cattle out of a herd, day 
or night. If I was ever sent out to fetch a steer, I'd return with the wrong 
animal." 
</P>
<P>
He also acquired, early on, the book-reading habit. When he was 6 years old, he 
said, a cousin, bound for World War II, dropped him off a box of boys' 
literature. "I read those 19 books over and over again," said McMurtry, 52. 
"Essentially, they were my library for the next 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
McMurtry, a big man whose eyes, behind dark-rimmed glasses, sometimes glint 
with flashes of irascibility, talked in a practiced, low-key style with just a 
hint of the Panhandle in his voice. He spoke of the colossal differences 
between novel writing and movie making: "One is private and cheap, and one is 
collaborative and expensive." 
</P>
<P>
He described his current project, a novel about fathers and daughters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Finite Resources 
</P>
<P>
"It's about a woman who doesn't meet her father until she's 22 years old," said 
McMurtry. "By then, she has two children, each by a different criminal." 
</P>
<P>
And he worried openly about his finite resources as a writer. 
</P>
<P>
With 12 novels and two books of essays under his belt, McMurtry has clearly 
established himself as one of America's most popular and compelling 
contemporary authors. His novels include "Horseman, Pass By" (adapted for the 
screen as "Hud"), "Terms of Endearment," "The Last Picture Show," "Texasville" 
and, most recently, "Anything for Billy," based loosely on the last days of 
Billy the Kid. 
</P>
<P>
His stories are often mordant, full of violence, plot switchbacks and an 
uncompromising realism, debunking traditionally overwrought descriptions of the 
Old West. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the narrator in "Anything for Billy," a writer of pulp Westerns, 
sums up a particularly bloody Wild West shoot-out as "just a long hot boring 
day, with a certain amount of fear mixed in. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
McMurtry's books are also full of eccentrically original characters. Three of 
his women characters have provided Academy Award-winning roles for the 
actresses who portrayed them on film: Ruth Popper in "The Last Picture Show," 
played by Cloris Leachman; Alma in "Hud," played by Patricia Neal, and Aurora 
Greenway in "Terms of Endearment," played by Shirley MacLaine. 
</P>
<P>
McMurtry, who said he will open a rare-books store in Orange County in February 
or March, joked that he had decided recently that he wasn't a total failure as 
a trail-driving herdsman, as his father once thought. "In a sense, I herd words 
into little sentences and sentences into paragraphs. Eventually, I herd them 
all into books." 
</P>
<P>
"Lonesome Dove," probably McMurtry's most widely praised novel, is the story of 
a 19th-Century trail drive from the Mexican border to Canada. The television 
version will star Robert Duvall, Anjelica Huston, Tommy Lee Jones, Danny Glover 
and Ricky Schroder. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reading and Writing 
</P>
<P>
The author's comments about the role of books in his life were not just idle 
autobiographical detail. Reading, more than anything else, leads to writing, 
McMurtry contended. 
</P>
<P>
"During the '30s, '40s and '50s," he said, "the dust jackets of novels always 
gave a long list of the professions that the author had practiced -- 
lumberjack, cowboy, merchant seaman, railroad brakeman, etc., etc. The idea was 
that a wide experience could somehow translate into novels." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, fellow novelist Walker Percy ("one of my heroes," said 
McMurtry) spent 15 years just reading while he recovered from tuberculosis. 
"All those years, while his contemporaries were having their experiences, 
Walker Percy read and read," he said. "And out came 'The Moviegoer' (Percy's 
highly acclaimed first novel)." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Advice to Read 
</P>
<P>
McMurtry's advice to would-be novelists: "If you want to be a writer, you 
read." 
</P>
<P>
The author also made these points: 
</P>
<P>
Writing fiction is "truly making up stories," not recording real-life gossip or 
scandals. "There's a kind of Puritan suspicion against fiction," he said. "Many 
people like to believe that writers (of novels) are, in a sense, journalists." 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the life you've lived that excites the fiction writer, it's the life 
you haven't lived." McMurtry said he finds "attempting to project yourself into 
the feelings of a 50-year-old woman" more challenging than writing about 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I write very early in the morning. I lead a very Spartan life. My typewriter 
is about three steps from my bed." 
</P>
<P>
"Lonesome Dove" is full of historical omissions. "I forgot the railroad, for 
one thing. I even wrote in the margin to put it in -- to have the cattle 
crossing the railroad. But I ignored my own note." 
</P>
<P>
McMurtry rarely gives interviews. "Offer readers a choice between a page of 
opinions in a newspaper and an 852-page novel like 'Lonesome Dove,' and a great 
many of them may be satisfied with the newspaper interview." 
</P>
<P>
On the current ascendancy of Texans in the White House: "George Bush isn't a 
Texan, he's a Yankee. . . . (Secretary of State) James Baker, he's a Texas 
Princetonian, a strange species. . . . At a time when Washington is most loaded 
up with professional Texans, I'm glad to be elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
When he talked about writing, McMurtry showed a fretful, vulnerable side. 
There's no guarantee that you can't "lose it" in a flash, he said with a 
self-deprecating smile. 
</P>
<P>
McMurtry admitted thinking, after he completed "Terms of Endearment" in 1975, 
that this had happened to him. He inexplicably lost his conviction as a writer. 
</P>
<P>
Partly, he suggested, it was because of the death in that novel of the 
cancer-stricken Emma Horton, a character who had appeared in his last three 
novels. "I was just as involved with her as I could be with a living person." 
</P>
<P>
Inexorably, he said, his writer's edge began to fuzz over. "My writing began to 
seem leaden. It's like, 'Have I seen this sentence before?' Characters that 
appear in your new book seem strangely similar to characters in your old books. 
. . . I didn't get it back for nine years." 
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough came while he wrote the novel "The Desert Rose," based on a 
Las Vegas showgirl he met while researching a screenplay. "It was a little 
book," said McMurtry. Though his usual way of writing is plodding and 
"metronomic," he said, "I wrote it in three weeks." 
</P>
<P>
Without that rush of pent-up creativity, McMurtry said, "Lonesome Dove," with 
which he had struggled since 1971, "might have remained just a half-written 
manuscript in a drawer." 
</P>
<P>
The experience rebuilt his confidence, but it also chastened him. "You can't 
count on being there forever," he said. "You have to keep struggling with it."

PASADENA CONSIDERS TROLLEYS OF ITS OWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE WARD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It may be a decade or more before commuters can take a trolley from Pasadena to 
Los Angeles, but trolley cars could be running within Pasadena before that. 
</P>
<P>
The Pasadena Board of Directors has authorized studies to find out whether a 
trolley line within the city would have enough appeal to justify the expense. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor William E. Thomson Jr. said there is no doubt that a trolley system would 
attract tourists. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm convinced it would," he said. "The issue is: How much of an attraction 
would it be? Would you bring in enough people on a daily basis to make it pay 
for itself?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Several Options 
</P>
<P>
A trolley line along Colorado Boulevard from the Norton Simon Museum east to 
Rosemead Boulevard and south on Lake Avenue from Colorado to California 
Boulevard is one of several options the city is considering to tie in with the 
construction of a regional trolley system, also known as a light-rail line, 
between Los Angeles and Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
The regional line and the proposed local line would both be electric-powered 
trolley systems, but with large differences. 
</P>
<P>
The regional line will employ trolley cars that are 90 feet long and are 
boarded from platforms three or four feet above ground that are nearly the 
length of a city block. The system is designed for efficiency and speed, 
eliminating steps up or down as passengers board and disembark from the trolley 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed city line would employ small, old-fashioned trolley cars that 
could be boarded from the street, designed for local service rather than 
commuter trips. 
</P>
<P>
The city has invited consultants to submit proposals for a study to estimate 
the economic impact of running the regional rail line, local trolleys, buses 
that look like trolleys or a combination of those systems through the downtown 
area. The city wants to find out how the systems could help retail sales, 
increase hotel occupancy, attract tourists and bolster city revenue. 
</P>
<P>
This study is in addition to other traffic and engineering studies already 
under way to help the city select a regional light-rail route. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Key Decision 
</P>
<P>
Douglas C. Reilly, city transit and commuter services coordinator, said the key 
decision is whether to run the light-rail line on downtown streets or put it in 
the center of the Foothill Freeway. If a downtown alignment is selected, he 
said, the city would be less likely to build a local trolley line. 
</P>
<P>
But Reilly said no matter where the light-rail line is placed, the city will 
need to connect other transportation services with it. 
</P>
<P>
Reilly said the city has good bus service from the Southern California Rapid 
Transit District but needs a downtown shuttle to move people around the 
business districts. He said the city tried an RTD minibus as a downtown shuttle 
in 1984-85, and although the minibus attracted some riders, it was not 
distinctive enough to be a success. 
</P>
<P>
"The way to get people to ride your vehicle is to make it fun and interesting 
to use," Reilly said. 
</P>
<P>
Monterey Park and a number of other cities run buses that look like trolleys. 
Reilly said such buses can be "comfortable, cute and convenient" and attract 
more attention than ordinary minibuses. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Buses Less of a Draw 
</P>
<P>
But drawing tourists, he said, would require a rail system. "There are a lot of 
rail buffs throughout the world," Reilly said. "You don't see as many bus 
buffs. That says something about the interest in rail generally." 
</P>
<P>
Rick Cole, a member of the city Board of Directors and of committees studying 
light rail and the local trolley, said a trolley system "makes sense (only) 
with the assumption that Pasadena wants to do something unique and spectacular 
that will bring people to Pasadena." 
</P>
<P>
Cole added: "Clearly, Colorado Boulevard is very anemic today" and a trolley 
system by itself is not going to make business boom overnight. But, he said, a 
trolley system could draw visitors, spur the creation and expansion of 
businesses and contribute to economic growth as people find more and more 
reasons to visit Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Although the light-rail line and the local trolley are projects that will 
require coordination, Cole said the city could build a local trolley system 
without waiting for construction of the regional line. 
</P>
<P>
Reilly said the cost of installing a trolley system in Pasadena will not be 
known until studies are completed but that a rough estimate is $4 million to $5 
million a mile. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Thomson said that before the city spends millions on a local rail system, 
he would favor running trolley buses to test the demand. 
</P>
<P>
But Cole said he doubts that the potential success of a rail system could be 
predicted from bus ridership. He said rail experiences in other cities and 
marketing studies can provide only rough guidance for Pasadena because so many 
factors can only be speculated about. 
</P>
<P>
The Pasadena Board of Directors has allocated $110,000 to study the economic 
impacts and financial feasibility of trolleys downtown. Reilly said proposals 
are being solicited from consultants, and a contract will be recommended to the 
board in March.

BONELLI PARK DEVELOPMENT SUFFERS SETBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Los Angeles County has suffered a setback in its plans to commercially develop 
part of Frank G. Bonelli Regional County Park. 
</P>
<P>
The county had asked for bids from developers last summer to build golf and 
equestrian centers at the park. But last week a Los Angeles Superior Court 
judge nullified those requests, ruling that the county had ignored the legal 
authority of cities near the park. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Miriam Vogel, ruling on a lawsuit filed last year by a citizens group 
called the Coalition to Preserve Bonelli Park, said the county must consult 
with the park's Joint Powers Authority, which is composed of six nearby cities, 
before soliciting bids from developers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Approval Blocked 
</P>
<P>
The judge's ruling prevents the County Board of Supervisors from approving an 
agreement with a firm that had successfully bid to build a driving range and 
pro shop next to the Mountain Meadows Golf Course in Pomona. The ruling also 
nullified the county's request for bids to develop a 500-horse equestrian 
boarding center, an offer that had been met with no response. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling was hailed by Ronald Vera, the attorney for the citizens coalition 
formed by residents enraged by the county's plans to have a hotel-restaurant 
complex developed in the park. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it gives us everything we asked for going in," Vera said. 
</P>
<P>
San Dimas City Councilman Denis Bertone, co-chairman of the coalition, called 
on Supervisor Pete Schabarum to reconsider his plans for the park in light of 
the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"We want Supervisor Pete Schabarum to heed the will of the people and 
discontinue any efforts to commercially develop the park," Bertone said. 
Schabarum represents the area containing the park and has spearheaded efforts 
for commercial development. The park is in southeastern San Dimas, next to 
Pomona and La Verne. 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum, in a statement read by Judy Hammond, his press deputy, criticized 
Vogel's ruling and said it would have no effect on planned park development. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, I think the judge missed that one," Schabarum said in the statement. 
"But we'll work through it and get the job done. We'll do what the judge 
required, but I fully expect the current park recommendation will still be 
appropriate. I'm frustrated by the additional two- to three-month delay this 
action imposes on the project." 
</P>
<P>
Previously, the county had operated under the assumption that the Joint Powers 
Authority, which is composed of San Dimas, La Verne, Claremont, Pomona, Covina 
and Glendora, had no authority over the operation of the park, Hammond said. 
The authority meets briefly each year to approve the park's annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of Vogel's ruling, neither the county nor opponents of park 
development are sure how much influence the authority will now have over park 
development. 
</P>
<P>
"It raises more questions than it answers," Bertone said. "The advantage for 
the cities is that it gives us more power, but we don't know yet how much." 
</P>
<P>
Vera said the county counsel must, by Feb. 3, provide details of how the county 
will proceed with park development under the judge's ruling. If the coalition 
is not satisfied with the county's response, a hearing will be held by Feb. 17 
at which Vogel will rule on the degree of influence the Joint Powers Authority 
should wield. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the Joint Powers Authority is probably going to get some legal counsel 
and find out if they have any discretion or if they have to follow the county's 
direction," Vera said, adding that the coalition may take action against the 
authority if it does not sufficiently assert its legal powers. 
</P>
<P>
The 1970 joint-powers agreement between the county and seven area cities -- 
Walnut later dropped out of the authority -- gives the authority power to 
construct, maintain and operate facilities at the park. 
</P>
<P>
But at the time the Coalition to Preserve Bonelli Park filed its lawsuit, 
Senior Deputy County Counsel Amanda Susskind said the authority did not have 
regulatory power over the park. The authority, she said, was created as "a 
financing mechanism" to issue bonds to pay for improvements made to the park in 
the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
County Control 
</P>
<P>
The state Constitution limits the amount of debt local governments can accrue, 
but there is no such limit on lease payments, Susskind said. To take advantage 
of the lease payment exception, the county created the authority, which then 
floated the bonds for park improvements and leased the improved park area back 
to the county, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Under such an arrangement, all control over park operation and development 
remains with the county, she said. 
</P>
<P>
In his statement last week, Schabarum said he was bothered by "the larger 
question of whether the representatives of the adjacent cities who have no 
financial interest or obligation now have some say over how that park operates. 
As far as I'm concerned, you either have both (financial interest and 
authority) or none." 
</P>
<P>
Bertone said the coalition will now urge the city councils that have 
representatives on the authority to take a hard line against park development. 
</P>
<P>
"It's conceivable this could backfire for us," Bertone said. "The cities could 
say, 'We want all this development' . . . but I think the sense of the 
community is going to come out and the community does not want commercial 
development in the park." 
</P>
<P>
Opposition to park development depends on the specific project involved, 
Bertone said. Although there is strong opposition to plans to build a 100-room 
hotel, 22 chalets and a 24,000-square-foot restaurant and bar, Bertone said 
objections to the golf center and horse boarding facilities are less intense. 
</P>
<P>
Although he considers the judge's ruling a victory for opponents of park 
development, Bertone said he will caution coalition members to remain active on 
the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"The public should not be lulled into a false sense of security by the 
decision," he said. "The fight over commercial development in the park is far 
from over. . . . The county will do everything possible to skirt the judge's 
decision, and the coalition's going to have to be there every step of the way."

CLARIFYING POINTS ABOUT ART MUSEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On behalf of the staff and trustees of the Santa Monica Museum of Art, I am 
writing to correct several factual errors in Tracy Wilkinson's recent article 
about the Edgemar development in Santa Monica (Times, Jan. 15). 
</P>
<P>
First, and most serious among the misstatements, is the assertion that SMMOA is 
a "private" institution. This simply is not true. While I appreciate all the 
good press that the museum has received in The Los Angeles Times, the repeated 
characterization of SMMOA as a private museum is erroneous. The statement 
misrepresents the museum's legal status, and it is extremely harmful to our 
fund-raising efforts. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Monica Museum of Art is a bona fide, tax-exempt and nonprofit 
organization wholly supported by public dollars. Operating independent of 
municipal support, SMMOA's programs and operations are nonetheless publicly 
funded. 
</P>
<P>
More than 250 individuals have become members of the museum during the past 
four months, grants have been received from charitable foundations, 
corporations and governmental agencies, and a devoted group of 40 volunteers 
and nine trustees have given freely of their time, money and expertise to make 
SMMOA a reality. Any recognition of the museum's considerable accomplishments 
would have to acknowledge the collective effort and public good will of this 
loyal group of friends. 
</P>
<P>
There are two other matters that also need further clarification. First, the 
article asserts that programming at SMMOA has been "staged" by Edgemar's 
developer. In fact, the museum is a separate entity from Edgemar, and an 
independent curatorial committee was responsible for the opening shows at 
SMMOA. In no way did the Edgemar developer have a say in determining the 
exhibition schedule. In all curatorial matters, SMMOA's director has complete 
autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the issue of the Santa Monica Museum of Art's relationship to the 
Edgemar development needs to be set straight. SMMOA is a tenant within the 
development; its rights and obligations are accorded the same importance as any 
other tenant within the development. 
</P>
<P>
There is, however, one essential difference. Because of the Edgemar developer's 
munificence, the museum has been given the privilege of occupying a lovely 
building rent free for five years within Edgemar. As most people know, it is an 
architecturally remarkable building, a building that has become a landmark 
within Santa Monica and the Westside community. SMMOA is proud of its 
relationship with the Edgemar developer. She has provided us with the necessary 
means to build a potentially great cultural resource for the city of Santa 
Monica. Surely, this act of civic charity deserves more than the acrimonious 
and harmful charges, which have been leveled against her. Wake up, Santa 
Monica.

BEVERLY HILLS CHAMBER CHALLENGED; 
</P>
<P>
MERCHANT PETITIONS SEEK MORE POWER FOR SMALL BUSINESSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATHIS CHAZANOV, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Members of two merchant groups have launched a petition campaign to eliminate 
what they see as unfair domination of the Beverly Hills Chamber of Commerce by 
large firms in the central business district. 
</P>
<P>
At stake is control of the chamber, a 67-year-old organization that seeks 
business for the city, promotes the city's image and plays an important role in 
municipal planning. 
</P>
<P>
"If the representatives of the large businesses keep voting themselves and 
their close associates into the chamber directorship, they have no reason to 
help us and we have no recourse for our grievances," said Russ Levi, a liquor 
store owner on South Beverly Drive. 
</P>
<P>
"Streets like Robertson that are not in the center Rodeo Drive-area of Beverly 
Hills have gotten sort of forgotten and gotten sort of second-fiddle 
treatment," said Tracey Lewis Darroll, secretary-treasurer of the Robertson 
Boulevard Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Levi, chairman of the South Beverly Drive Business Assn., said he sent a 
petition to about 1,000 members of the Chamber of Commerce and to 450 civic 
leaders last week. 
</P>
<P>
Darroll said she plans to mail 5,000 copies of the appeal to business 
operators, office tenants and property owners in the Robertson area next week. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Votes 
</P>
<P>
"When it came to light how the chamber is set up, it's not even possible for 
smaller business people to have their concerns really looked after," she said. 
"That's why we as the Robertson Boulevard Assn. joined in this protest." 
</P>
<P>
The chamber is governed by a board of directors chosen at an election in which 
organizations that pay more dues have more votes. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a voting system that is very similar and adopted after the stock-market 
model. If you buy shares of stock you get as many (votes) as you have shares," 
said Max Factor III, past president of the chamber. 
</P>
<P>
The petitions call for limiting the number of votes of any one organization to 
three and allowing votes by people and companies located outside the city that 
belong to the Beverly Hills Chamber. 
</P>
<P>
Factor said members pay dues according to different criteria, depending on 
factors such as the number of employees in businesses such as hotels or 
department stores, or the size of deposits in the case of banks and other 
financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Since the chamber promotes the city extensively across the country and around 
the world, "the larger businesses pay more because they would benefit more from 
that activity," Factor said. "The smaller businesses have lower dues so they 
can participate on local issues." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Independent Voting 
</P>
<P>
In any case, he said, there rarely is any block voting, because companies 
generally assign their mandates to individual employees who cast their ballots 
independently. 
</P>
<P>
Factor said the Beverly Hills Chamber is awaiting responses from chambers of 
commerce elsewhere in California that it has contacted to determine whether its 
system is out of line with general practice. 
</P>
<P>
Karl Schurz, president of the 1,800-member chamber, declined to comment on the 
protest, saying: "I really don't think the story is newsworthy. I'm not going 
to get in a verbal volleyball fight in the newspaper with anybody. I'm not 
going to use the newspaper for an open forum with one or two people who are not 
happy, and that's what it boils down to." 
</P>
<P>
Ivan Elmer, director of small-business programs in the Office of Chamber of 
Commerce Relations at the U. S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington, said fights 
over control are not uncommon. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know that I could name a place where there wouldn't be disagreement, 
because everybody would like a little more," he said. "The question is how you 
deal with it." 
</P>
<P>
The national chamber suggests in its model charter that individual firms get no 
more than 10 votes each, but Elmer said the central business district of any 
town will tend to dominate the Chamber of Commerce regardless of the voting 
system. 
</P>
<P>
"The aggregate voting power in your main retail district is going to be larger 
than the other retail areas because of sheer numbers," he said. "That's what 
you're seeing rather than a matter of big vs. small." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Less Prominence 
</P>
<P>
To buttress their argument, Levi and Darroll said their areas have been 
featured less prominently than the city's main business triangle in 
chamber-sponsored promotions such as shopping maps and Christmas decorations. 
</P>
<P>
The triangle is bounded by Wilshire Boulevard, Santa Monica Boulevard and 
Rexford Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Levi and Darroll also said that the chamber put little effort into winning more 
city parking lots for areas outside the central business district and that it 
disregarded them in its response to the city's recently proposed urban design 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"Every positive benefit that's been given to us has been through our own 
activism, not through the chamber," Levi said. 
</P>
<P>
But Factor said that South Beverly Drive and South Robertson Boulevard were 
eventually included in the plans for the urban design project and that the 
chamber is open to anyone in the city. 
</P>
<P>
As for outside people and enterprises, Factor said "it makes no sense to allow 
them to vote. They have business interests that are different than those of 
Beverly Hills."

GALANTER GIVES SUPPORT TO LAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter has bucked council tradition by 
reaffirming her support for Laura M. Lake over Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky in 
the 5th District race. 
</P>
<P>
"I owe Laura personally and politically a great debt," Galanter said. Lake 
played a key role in Galanter's successful campaign against Councilwoman Pat 
Russell two years ago and took Galanter's mother into her home after Galanter 
was stabbed by an intruder at her home during the 1987 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky, who supported Russell two years ago, said of Galanter last week: 
"I understand her personal relationship with Laura, and I respect it." 
</P>
<P>
Galanter endorsed Lake, a fellow environmentalist, in September when 
Yaroslavsky was expected to give up his council seat to run for mayor. 
Yaroslavsky decided this month not to challenge Mayor Tom Bradley, citing polls 
showing him to be unbeatable. Instead, he decided to seek reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Also challenging Yaroslavsky in the April election are Jack McGrath, who 
managed Yaroslavsky's first successful campaign in 1975 and served as the 
councilman's chief deputy; urban planner Ryan Snyder and artist Henry Hill. 
Steve Saltzman, a former Bradley aide and co-chairman of Yaroslavsky's 1985 
reelection campaign, dropped out of the race.

MAYOR RESPONDS TO DRUG STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is the genuine concern of the Bell City Council to improve our city and 
attack crime in our streets. Your recent article, "Drug Users Frustrate, 
Frighten Merchants in Small Bell Center" (Times, Jan. 22), calls attention to a 
specific problem -- drug-dealing in our city. The merchants interviewed held 
our Police Department up as insensitive and powerless against this menace. 
Indirectly, this is also an indictment against our city, which I take exception 
to. 
</P>
<P>
Crime is everyone's problem. The very merchants who complain about drug pushers 
are the ones who can testify against this activity, yet they refuse to get 
involved. Our city has a merchant watch program; not one of the complaining 
merchants is a member. 
</P>
<P>
It is true that the Bell City Council and our Police Department have received 
complaints regarding this drug . . . criminal activity. We have authorized 
undercover operations. We further asked for a higher profile of patrol in that 
area. We have had small successes which we hope to build on. It is not true 
that no action is being taken! 
</P>
<P>
It is the Bell City Council's commitment to take any and all legal action to 
diffuse and eventually eradicate the drug and gang problems that have 
infiltrated our city. This can include further police action, preventive drug 
education programs such as DARE, and going after the absentee landlords who 
ignore our building and health codes, which lowers the living standards in our 
city. A slum, Bell will never be! 
</P>
<P>
Finally, it will never be our policy to instruct our Police Department to break 
the law in order to enforce the law, as has been suggested by some residents. 
This obviously creates limitations which creates frustration, but if concerned 
citizens would act as the eyes and ears in helping our Police Department, our 
successes would be multiplied. 
</P>
<P>
It is my hope that these merchants will join our commercial watch program to be 
full partners in eradicating these problems from our city.

Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party suffered a setback in 
special parliamentary elections in Punjab province but gained ground in two 
others. About 3 million voters were electing national and provincial lawmakers 
in what was seen as the first test of public opinion on the two-month-old 
government of Bhutto. The results did not alter the balance of power in the 
National Assembly, the lower house of Parliament, where the Pakistan People's 
Party won 124 seats in an election last November. In Punjab, where the rival 
Islamic Democratic Alliance is already in power, Bhutto's party took only two 
of nine seats. But overall it gained 11 of the 20 seats being contested.

A Marine accused of killing his wife and faking her suicide by hanging was 
freed after a military prosecutor recommended that charges be dropped because 
the woman probably had killed herself. Gunnery Sgt. Murray Payne, arrested Dec. 
1, was released from the brig at El Toro Marine Corps Air Station after a 
two-week hearing into the May 10, 1988, death of Ella Mae Payne at the couple's 
Corona home. Maj. R.W.J. Grove, who presided over the hearing, said he would 
evaluate the case for a week before recommending to the commanding general 
whether Payne should or should not face charges.

Jurors in the sixth day of deliberations showed signs of voting to acquit 
accused child killer Joel Steinberg of murder and of considering a lesser 
charge of manslaughter. The jury in Manhattan sent out a note asking Acting 
Justice Harold Rothwax to repeat his instructions for reaching a verdict on 
manslaughter. Earlier last week, Rothwax told the jury it was not permitted to 
"consider" the less serious homicide charges until it reaches a unanimous 
decision to acquit Steinberg of murder. The jury deliberated until 7 p.m. 
without announcing a verdict and was to resume this morning. Steinberg, 47, a 
disbarred lawyer, was accused of fatally beating his illegally adopted 
6-year-old daughter, Lisa. For a first-degree manslaughter conviction, the jury 
must find that Steinberg intended to cause serious physical injury without 
intending to kill Lisa -- but that in the act of causing serious injury he 
caused her death.

More than 350 people were arrested in abortion protests in five states. At 
least six protesters at an abortion clinic in Woodbridge, N.J., had chains 
wound around their necks and chained themselves together neck-to-leg. They 
later were dragged out of the building by a squad of police from New York City 
who brought special equipment, including an electric grinder, to break the 
shackles. At least 17 other protesters were arrested, police said. At Cranston, 
R.I., about 60 protesters blocked the doors of an abortion clinic before police 
carried them away. Thirty-two demonstrators in Bristol, Tenn., were arrested on 
trespassing charges outside an abortion clinic and about 150 were arrested at a 
St. Petersburg, Fla., clinic. In Stanton, Del., 65 anti-abortionists were 
arrested. About 100 abortion supporters held a counterdemonstration.

The price of beer and spirits doubled as the Nicaraguan government prepared 
tough new austerity measures to combat inflation running at over 21,000% a 
year. Manufacturers announced a 120% increase in beer prices, a 100% hike for 
rum and soft drinks and a 75% increase for some brands of cigarettes. The 
latest increases brought the cost of 24 bottles of beer to $12.50 and a case of 
lemonade to $7.50, which is more than many workers earn in a month. President 
Daniel Ortega called a special session of Nicaragua's National Assembly for 
Monday to announce an economic plan for 1989.

The premier of Soviet Azerbaijan has been replaced less than two weeks after 
2,500 officials and party workers in the republic were disciplined over ethnic 
unrest linked with the predominantly Armenian Nagorno-Karabakh enclave. 
"Comrade (Gasan N.) Seidov was relieved of his duties as chairman of the 
Azerbaijan Council of Ministers to retire for health reasons," said a decree 
issued by the Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet. The decree named Ayaz Mutalibov, one 
of several deputy premiers, as Seidov's successor. The statement made no 
explicit link between the departure of Seidov, 56, and the violence in which at 
least 78 people died last year. New Communist Party leaders were appointed in 
Azerbaijan and neighboring Armenia last year.

Nearly 3,000 Soviet children will be tested for AIDS because of the infection 
of at least 27 infants and four mothers while being treated at a Moscow-area 
hospital, the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda said. Authorities suspect poor 
sanitary conditions and the possible reuse of disposable syringes. The paper 
also quoted Vladimir Pokrovsky, head of a special AIDS research laboratory, as 
saying that acquired immune deficiency syndrome is spreading in the Soviet 
Union, where the public is generally indifferent to the deadly disease. "The 
epidemic has entered our country," Pokrovsky said. "It is gathering speed, and 
we now have 146 virus carriers."

Despite attempts by Syria and Iran to stop the violence, two bombs exploded in 
Lebanon, resulting in at least one death. Police said one person was killed and 
11 were injured, including a Syrian soldier, when a car bomb exploded in the 
Bekaa Valley town of Barr Elias. The blast set eight parked cars ablaze and 
damaged 12 stores. In a separate attack, a bomb exploded at a building in 
Muslim West Beirut near a Syrian army checkpoint, wounding six people, police 
said. There were no claims of responsibility for the blasts.

WIT MAKES MINUTES THAT DON'T SEEM TO TAKE HOURS

With Arthur Coladarci wielding his pen as academic secretary, the minutes from 
the 21st Senate of the Academic Council at Stanford University no longer 
consist of coma-inducing verbiage. 
</P>
<P>
Coladarci expunges dull minutes that begin "The meeting was called to order by 
. . . " Rather, he lifts the job of taking minutes to a new literary and 
comical plane. 
</P>
<P>
To wit: "(Chairman John) Kaplan rapped his gavel smartly at approximately 3:20 
p.m., and all but an impish chemist responded appropriately -- but he complied 
cheerfully with Kaplan's personalized invitation to join the otherwise 
respectful assembly." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Decided to Inject Fun 
</P>
<P>
Coladarci, 71, a professor emeritus of psychology and education, said that when 
he began writing the minutes last fall, he set out to inject some fun into the 
official record of a body that decides a variety of academic issues. 
</P>
<P>
"I have never been comfortable with the general assumption that minutes ought 
to be sober things," Coladarci said. "Meetings are not only sober occasions. 
People are people and even the most serious discussions have in them a little 
irony, a little humor." 
</P>
<P>
He said he's heard only compliments about his writing. 
</P>
<P>
He does have detractors, however, who nevertheless insist on remaining 
anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they are flippant," one professor said. "Not that we have to take 
ourselves all that seriously . . . there's a great deal of his own 
editorializing about matters. A person who takes notes should maintain some 
distance." 
</P>
<P>
Coladarci also has supporters, such as university President Donald Kennedy, who 
called the minutes "wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose he tickles somebody the wrong way," Kennedy said. "The literary 
quality is very high, and he keeps high morale in the staff and Senate." 
</P>
<P>
Another longtime Coladarci supporter is Nel Noddings, a professor of education. 
</P>
<P>
"He did minutes for us at the school of education and they were even more fun," 
she said. "He was less restrained. The minutes were always read." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
They Were Always Read 
</P>
<P>
She noted that when Coladarci asks for additions, faculty members usually have 
suggestions, proving that the minutes are being read. 
</P>
<P>
Witness this paragraph from the Dec. 1 minutes: "The Senate tacitly gave its 
secular absolution to the academic secretary for the venial misspelling of 
'tendentious' in the draft version of the Nov. 10 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
When Coladarci was appointed academic secretary, he agreed to serve for two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good arrangement for people in my age bracket," he said. "Otherwise, 
administrators are put in the uncomfortable position of telling someone he's 
decrepit." 
</P>
<P>
Excerpts from Coladarci's minutes: 
</P>
<P>
* "Confessing an ignorance probably held by many, Rebholz inquired about the 
meaning of the acronym 'pro fro' in the C-UAFA report. His intellectual hunger 
was sated by (Dean Jean) Fetter's response: 'prospective freshmen,' but it was 
re-generated and re-satisfied by her comment that the committee employs, but 
mercifully omitted from the report, an even more arcane acronym, 'Pro Fro Ho 
Pro,' which signals 'Prospective Freshman Host Programs.' Rebholz smiled in 
admiration and then retreated. Fetter, however, continued to advance 
mercilessly with an explanation of that operation in which she alchemized the 
acronym noun into an ear-catching and dangerously suggestive verb; e.g., 'We go 
Pro Fro-ing around the country.' " 
</P>
<P>
* "P.S. The reward for those who read to the end is a bit of intelligence about 
our theory-constructing and theory-driven Department of Sociology. The 1895-96 
catalogue includes the following course: Sociology 10. Principles of Household 
Management, 2 Hours, 2d semester. Lectures and assigned readings on domestic 
architecture, house decoration and furnishing, sanitation, food and dietaries, 
domestic labor, and household finance.

SCREENPLAY ON AIDS TUGS AT HEARTSTRINGS, INSPIRES FILM ON SHOESTRING BUDGET

Polly Bergen cried for 20 minutes after reading the script, and then offered to 
pay for a part in it. 
</P>
<P>
John Dye saw it as a chance to provide "a lot of something for nothing" about a 
tragedy he believes has affected almost everyone in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-minute film "Mother, Mother" had its world premiere in Boston's John 
Hancock Hall this month. It was true labor of love for Bergen, Dye and the rest 
of the cast and crew, who worked for free. 
</P>
<P>
The dramatic story focuses on a young man with AIDS and his estranged mother, 
who is trying to cope with his inevitable death. 
</P>
<P>
More than 350 people donated time and technical support to create a film that 
would have cost an estimated $1.5 million. Equipment was either provided free 
or at a fraction of the cost. 
</P>
<P>
All of the proceeds will be going to community AIDS help organizations 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
"They wanted to make a difference," says Micki Dickoff, a Boston film producer 
who conceived, co-produced and directed the drama. "Everybody that came aboard 
was there because they wanted to do something about AIDS. People are very 
frustrated with this illness. 
</P>
<P>
"What we learned in Hollywood in particular was there was nobody . . . who 
didn't have some particular relationship with someone with AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
Dickoff, 41, has taught television and film at Boston's Emerson College for a 
decade and has been producing documentaries and public service announcements 
for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
She wrote the story for "Mother, Mother" last January and took her idea to 
Hollywood, where she landed producer Judy Miller, co-producer and writer Ian 
Praiser, Michael Alden of Cannon Films and the biggest prize -- a $55,000 
donation from John Hancock Financial Services. 
</P>
<P>
The cast -- Bergen, Dye, Bess Armstrong and Piper Laurie -- all worked for 
free. Composer Henry Mancini provided the music and the theme song was written 
by Cris Williamson and performed by Kenny Rankin. 
</P>
<P>
The film tells the story of Jeff (Dye), whose homosexual lover has just died of 
AIDS and who has discovered he also has the deadly virus, and his mother 
(Bergen) who rejects her son after he reveals his homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff, an AIDS hospice worker, dislikes his mother and tries to cope with his 
illness without her. But his co-workers Kate (Armstrong) and Martha (Laurie), 
the mother of his deceased lover -- try to persuade the two to reunite. 
</P>
<P>
"She's a highly unlikable person," Bergen, 58, known for her performances in 
"Winds of War" and "Making Mr. Right," says of her character. "I think that the 
moment she finds out he has AIDS, she already feels that she's lost him. . . 
She shuts herself off from that pain by simply refusing to have anything to do 
with him." 
</P>
<P>
Dickoff first tackled the subject of AIDS in her documentary "Too Little, Too 
Late," about how family and friends react to the deadly virus. The film aired 
on local television in several U.S. cities June 29. 
</P>
<P>
"That film was about families who were there for their children through the 
illness of AIDS," Dickoff said. "What I wanted to do was take 'Too Little, Too 
Late' one step further to show these families who reject their kids with AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
The underlying theme of "Mother, Mother" is unconditional love and forgiveness, 
Dickoff said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've watched a lot of people die without the support of their families. I 
couldn't fathom this," she said. "I felt there was no issue big enough to keep 
a mother and child from each other when the child was dying." 
</P>
<P>
Dickoff met hundreds of AIDS victims while filming "Too Little, Too Late," and 
many were featured in both the documentary and "Mother, Mother." 
</P>
<P>
"It's like no other disease that's known to us in recent history. I've lost 15 
(friends with AIDS). In the past four weeks, I've been to a funeral every 
week," Dickoff said. "It's pretty devastating." 
</P>
<P>
Bergen counts 30 close friends who have died from AIDS -- an illness she says 
"crosses all lines." 
</P>
<P>
"I was very moved by the script," Bergen said. "I thought that it touched on a 
subject that deeply needs to be talked about and dealt with. Having three 
children of my own and knowing what it would be like to actually have that kind 
of a separation from one of your children, imagining what it would be like . . 
. just destroyed me." 
</P>
<P>
The film was shot in eight days in the Los Angeles area, with cast and crew 
working up to 18 hours each day to meet deadlines for returning donated 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from the world premiere in Boston benefited the AIDS Action Committee 
of Massachusetts and fund-raisers are also planned in Los Angeles, Washington 
and New York. 
</P>
<P>
After those showings, the film will be given to nonprofit AIDS organizations 
for their own fund-raisers. Dickoff hopes to eventually sell the drama to 
television, with proceeds donated to AIDS organizations. 
</P>
<P>
She may get another plus in February. The film has been submitted for Academy 
Award consideration in the category of short subjects-live action.

NUCLEAR DUMP REMAINS HOT TAX ISSUE FOR NEVADA 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Bullfrog County, population 0, was born at 3 a.m. on the last day of the 1987 
Nevada Legislature and died last year in court. 
</P>
<P>
The legislators' invention, a new locality levying the state's highest taxes on 
the proposed site of the nation's first high-level nuclear waste dump, proved 
unconstitutional. But the idea of making the federal government pay for 
choosing Nevada lives on. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know of any current proposal out there but I think that if we have to 
take the dump we should be compensated for it," Assembly Taxation Committee 
Chairman Bob Price said as the 1989 session opened Jan. 16. 
</P>
<P>
Some believe that Nevada could begin collecting tax-like fees from the federal 
government as it tests the proposed site, whether the underground repository is 
built there or not, Senate Taxation Committee Chairman Charlie Joerg said. "I 
think we'd be foolish not to look into the possibility of collecting money from 
the government. We should get some benefit from this." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'87 Resolution Resurfaces 
</P>
<P>
A resolution from the 1987 Legislature resurfaced in the Senate on opening day 
this year. It would establish a special tax district around the site to let the 
state collect $5 per $100 of assessed valuation, as if the repository were a 
private project. The rate is the maximum allowed by the Nevada Constitution and 
about three times the local levy around the proposed tax district. 
</P>
<P>
Backers of the assessment plan want money in lieu of taxes to offset the impact 
on local governments, which would have to provide housing, education, law 
enforcement and other services for people working at the $2-billion dump. 
</P>
<P>
Assembly Speaker Joe Dini said lawmakers should move cautiously to avoid 
sending a signal to Washington that Nevadans are willing to accept the nation's 
nuclear garbage. "We've had advice that if we try to get money out of the 
federal government it will weaken our position to fight the dump." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It Implies Consent' 
</P>
<P>
Assemblywoman Myrna Williams introduced a resolution with 35 co-sponsors urging 
Congress to halt the dump. Williams blasted a measure introduced in the state 
Senate to negotiate with the government, saying, "It implies consent." 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Congress passed legislation directing the Department of Energy to 
concentrate on Yucca Mountain as a place to bury spent fuel from nuclear power 
plants. The site 110 miles northwest of Las Vegas could be licensed in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
The Legislature responded by carving 144 square miles out of Nye County as a 
way to let the state collect the maximum property tax rate. That could have 
cost the federal government an estimated $8 million to $25 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
Bullfrog County -- inhabited by rattlesnakes, coyotes, lynx, kangaroo rats and 
lizards, but no humans -- was named after a Nye County mining district that 
failed in a bid to become a separate county nearly 80 years ago. It was given a 
three-member commission and a county seat 250 miles away in Carson City. 
</P>
<P>
Nye County sued the state, challenging Bullfrog's creation on 37 different 
legal grounds in a 92-page brief. Its major claim was that because Bullfrog had 
no residents it had no representative government and was unconstitutional. It 
also contended that it was entitled to any money collected. 
</P>
<P>
"Nye County should be compensated more. We have to recognize mitigating factors 
because they would be closest to the dump," said Joerg. 
</P>
<P>
Retired Nevada Supreme Court Justice David Zenoff ruled Feb. 11, 1988, after 30 
minutes of oral arguments, that Bullfrog County was unconstitutional. He said 
it stretched its legal limits "every which way," and left too many 
constitutional issues "hanging in the air."

FURTHER LAROUCHE CHARGES ARE DROPPED

Federal prosecutors dropped conspiracy and fraud charges against Lyndon H. 
LaRouche Jr. on Friday, moments before a Virginia judge sentenced the political 
extremist to 15 years in prison for related offenses. 
</P>
<P>
All charges against LaRouche and six associates were dropped. The Justice 
Department refused to drop charges against three co-defendants who are 
fugitives. 
</P>
<P>
The Boston case -- in which LaRouche was accused of conspiring to obstruct an 
investigation of an alleged $2-million credit card and loan fraud -- ended in a 
mistrial in May after five months of testimony. A new trial was to begin in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
LaRouche was sentenced in Alexandria, Va., to 15 years in prison for scheming 
to defraud federal tax collectors and deliberately failing to repay more than 
$30 million in loans from political supporters. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. John Markham said the Justice Department felt dismissal 
was warranted because "the major participants in the Boston crimes have now 
received substantial sentences either in Boston or in Alexandria." 
</P>
<P>
"It was the Boston prosecuting effort which led to the evidence which allowed 
the indictment and convictions in Alexandria, and I think justice was served by 
the substantial sentences received," said Markham, who handled both cases. 
</P>
<P>
"Additional effort would be a waste of the court's time and resources. We've 
got nothing more to gain." 
</P>
<P>
LaRouche, who has run for President four times, is known for his extreme views, 
including support for a quarantine of AIDS victims and allegations that 
Britain's Queen Elizabeth is involved in drug trafficking.

NORTHERN INDIA, LAND OF 'HEAT AND DUST,' BUNDLES UP IN AN UNUSUALLY COLD WINTER

The shoeshine boy waited like a hawk, his eyes fixed on a large family eating 
lunch on paper plates in a park. 
</P>
<P>
Jagdish Rajkumar, a scrawny teen-ager, was not interested in the food. 
</P>
<P>
The moment the family finished the food and threw away the paper plates, 
Rajkumar darted over and tucked the plates into a bag and resumed his business, 
calling out "Get your shoes polished for two rupees (13 cents)." 
</P>
<P>
Rajkumar is one the millions of poor people across northern India who are 
collecting rags, scraps of paper, bits of straw and anything else that burns in 
an effort to keep warm during an unusually cold Indian winter. 
</P>
<P>
Especially prized is cow dung, which makes excellent fuel when dried and patted 
into cakes. 
</P>
<P>
In recent days, 24 people in northern India have died because of the cold, 
according to official reports. Newspapers put the death toll at 100. 
</P>
<P>
This winter is mild by international standards but exceptionally chilly in a 
region better known for its torrid summer heat. 
</P>
<P>
"It is cold if you take into consideration a lesser-discussed meteorological 
phenomenon," said G. S. Mondal of the New Delhi's Weather Office. He explained 
that a temperature of 42 degrees Fahrenheit, combined with a 19-m.p.h. wind, 
made it feel like it was just above freezing, and that has "a tremendous 
biological impact on us." 
</P>
<P>
New Delhi's normal winter temperatures range from 46 to 50, but even a few 
degrees make a big difference to people with little or no shelter. 
</P>
<P>
"In between my business I collect as much paper as I can to keep us warm at 
night," said Rajkumar, who earns about $1 a day. He said he gives about 33 
cents to police so they'll look the other way when he scavenges for paper in 
the park at Connaught Place, New Delhi's central shopping district. 
</P>
<P>
"I have old parents and three sisters at home. We all sleep in one room with a 
fire or we will freeze to death," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Wood is too expensive for many. 
</P>
<P>
About two pounds of wood costs 7 cents, and it lasts only for minutes, "so what 
we do is pick up everything and anything that burns" the shoeshine boy said. 
</P>
<P>
Even tourists from other climates are finding the India of "Heat and Dust," the 
book and screenplay by Ruth Prawer Jhabwala, has turned cold. 
</P>
<P>
Richard and Mary Thomson of Mill Valley, Calif., said they dreamed of the 
"golden rays of tropical Indian sun" when they planned their vacation in the 
subcontinent. 
</P>
<P>
"We never thought we would be using this in India," Thomson said, pointing at 
his sweater, his first purchase in an Indian bazaar. 
</P>
<P>
"I had expected India to be much warmer. It is cold, but I am enjoying it," 
said Eric Eubank, 19, of Frederick, Md., a philosophy student at St. Andrews 
Presbyterian College in Laurinburg, N.C. "When you think of India, you think of 
the heat and not cold." 
</P>
<P>
"In our country it is cold, too, but there we have centrally heated homes and 
offices. Here there is none," said Nanna Rosenstock of Copenhagen. "We manage 
here, but we wonder what the poor among the Indians do." 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people succumb to cold weather in India every year because they do 
not have adequate clothing, shelter and food. Some of those fortunate enough to 
have homes die of carbon monoxide from unventilated fires. 
</P>
<P>
Beggars, migrant laborers and other poorest of the poor are the hardest hit 
because they have no shelter. They normally sleep in parks, on sidewalks or 
under bridges. 
</P>
<P>
As nightfall approaches, some head to railway stations and government-run 
shelters. Others bribe guards at government buildings to let them to spend the 
night in the corridors.

THOUSANDS FROM DOMINICAN REPUBLIC BRAVE STORMY SEAS FOR CHANCE AT BETTER LIFE

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jammed into an open boat with other desperate Dominicans, Ramon Diaz Perez 
battled through a tropical storm to get to Puerto Rico, part of a new wave of 
boat people who are risking their lives to have better ones. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a storm of water, where the sea was wild and proud and the waves were 
way above us," Diaz Perez said in a dingy holding cell for aliens on San Juan's 
waterfront. "Right then it was really tough. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a trip that only someone who knows nothing about it would make," said the 
31-year-old mechanic who left behind a wife and four children when he sailed 
from the Dominican Republic to Puerto Rico early in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the dangers, thousands of Dominicans gamble on surviving the 95-mile 
trip across the Mona Passage, the turbulent channel between Puerto Rico and its 
western neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1986, increasing numbers have tried to escape the slumping Dominican 
economy, its 60% inflation and 25% unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an enormous problem," said Capt. William Caster, U.S. Coast Guard 
commander for the Greater Antilles. "It's costing the United States a lot of 
money, and it's costing the Dominicans a lot of people, a lot of dead bodies." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities recovered the bodies of at least 31 Dominicans off western Puerto 
Rico in 1988, including 19 in December alone when their overloaded boats, 
called yolas, capsized. 
</P>
<P>
Because currents sweep bodies back toward the Dominican coast, the exact death 
toll will never be known. 
</P>
<P>
"We know it must be in the hundreds," said James Walker, district director of 
the Immigration and Naturalization Service. "It has to be. We know they come 
over here in 5-foot seas, in boats with 4 inches of freeboard (the gap between 
the waterline and the deck). 
</P>
<P>
"That means they have to be bailing the whole time. Sometimes they just aren't 
going to make it." 
</P>
<P>
The new refugees increasingly are felt in Puerto Rico, where there are at least 
175,000 illegal Dominicans, an estimated 5% of the population, Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
But Puerto Rico is mainly a steppingstone to major U.S. cities, where 
Dominicans are a growing percentage of the Latino population. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Dominicans are the fastest-growing Latino group in the New York 
area, according to a December report by the Latino Commission of Tri-State. 
</P>
<P>
"Combined heavy immigration and rapid natural growth are expected to account 
for an estimated fourfold expansion of the Dominican community," bringing 
Dominicans in the area to 636,000 by the year 2000, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said they knew of five major Dominican smuggling rings. U.S. 
officials want a treaty with the Dominican Republic, Caster said, to let the 
Coast Guard halt vessels on the open sea if it is suspected that they are 
bearing illegal aliens to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
To stem the flood, the Border Patrol opened its first station outside the 
continental United States in October, 1987, at Aguadilla, on Puerto Rico's 
northwest corner. 
</P>
<P>
Agents have detained at least 2,931 aliens since then. They average some 500 
detentions monthly during the winter, when calmer weather means more voyages. 
</P>
<P>
Walker said Dominican deportations have quadrupled from 1985 to a projected 
6,000 in the 1989 fiscal year, which began in October. However, authorities 
estimated that they were only halting up to 20% of the aliens. 
</P>
<P>
Flanked by three other Dominican men, Diaz Perez described his two-day trip in 
a story U.S. officials said was typical. 
</P>
<P>
Diaz Perez said he left on a February night from a beach near Miches, on the 
northeast Dominican coast. He knew none of the 40 people -- almost all men -- 
in the 20-foot yola powered by an outboard motor. 
</P>
<P>
He said he paid about $320 -- equivalent to several months' wages. 
</P>
<P>
The boat pounded through a storm, with many passengers violently seasick and 
bailing most of the time. The vessel halted at Desecheo Island in the Mona 
Passage, then landed in the early morning on an Aguadilla beach. 
</P>
<P>
Diaz Perez clambered up a cliff and fled on foot. Unable to find work, he said 
he stayed with a friend until Border Patrol agents arrested him in September. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm here for my kids, not for me," he said. "I took the yola for them."

ISLAND TOWN LEERY OF A BIG MAC ATTACK

WINSLOW, Wash. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
McDonald's is coming to Bainbridge Island, and some residents of this Puget 
Sound oasis fear that it could be the beginning of the end of a quiet life 
style that revolves around families and ferry schedules to Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Winslow is taking steps to make sure that the fast-food restaurant 
will not shake up the community when it arrives as early as this spring. 
</P>
<P>
What promises to be Washington state's first law banning plastic-foam 
containers, such as the kind Big Macs and other McDonald's hamburgers come in, 
is one way officials hope to limit the environmental impact. 
</P>
<P>
But many officials say McDonald's is just a symbolic target of much deeper 
concern. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the real reason (for concern) is that they're not afraid of deep-fried 
food and the looks of the thing so much as they feel it represents an incursion 
into the isolation that Bainbridge Island has," said Bob Chapel, a Winslow city 
councilman. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Fear of Change' 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's fear of change," agreed Terry Dolan, another councilman. "In my 
opinion, the McDonald's itself is not a significant change. I think the 
McDonald's is a symbol of change that has already taken place and they're 
taking it out on McDonald's." 
</P>
<P>
Bainbridge Island, home to 13,000 people, including many white-collar 
professionals who commute by ferry to Seattle, sits between two of Washington's 
fastest-growing areas. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle, to the east, bristles with new skyscrapers. The Kitsap Peninsula lies 
to the west, and Kitsap County has been booming for several years, thanks 
largely to the arrival of the Navy's Trident submarine base at Bangor. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess we're fortunate that we haven't had this kind of pressure before, and 
maybe we're kind of spoiled," said Vince Mattson, a director of the citizen 
Assn. of Bainbridge Communities, which monitors island development. "But we've 
seen what's happened elsewhere and we certainly don't want it to happen here." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Market Planned 
</P>
<P>
In fact, there really is no organized opposition to McDonald's alone, and the 
fast-food restaurant is just another development planned in a commercially 
zoned area near the ferry terminal. Also planned is a Safeway, which would 
compete with the two locally owned supermarkets on the island. 
</P>
<P>
But a spate of letters in the local weekly newspaper and comments at public 
meetings already have led the City Council to change the town's sign ordinance 
in an effort to restrict the size of McDonald's Golden Arches logo. The ban on 
plastic-foam containers, to be considered by the City Council Feb. 2, also is 
almost sure to pass, council members say. 
</P>
<P>
John Onoda, director of media relations at McDonald's headquarters in Oakbrook, 
Ill., said the company's policy is to comply with all local ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be flexible to be as successful as McDonald's is," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the fear of a unique community slipping away will remain for some, 
Chapel said. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't realize it and you don't even think about it, but living on an 
island creates an island mentality," he said. "It's quiet and peaceful here and 
you want to keep it that way. That's why people moved here -- because there are 
no Golden Arches to drive by on the way home."

FLIGHTS TO ISOLATED TOWNS; 
</P>
<P>
SUBSIDIZED AIR SERVICE MAY BE GROUNDED

MOULTRIE, Ga. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A dozen times a week, Flight 3323's engines crank into a throbbing whine and 
launch an 18-passenger turboprop out of one of the nation's busiest airports 
into one of air travel's loneliest routes. 
</P>
<P>
The federally subsidized flight from Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport 
200 miles south to Moultrie averages about one passenger. Often the plane flies 
empty of passengers. 
</P>
<P>
As the government looks for some wings to clip, Flight 3323's days may be 
numbered. 
</P>
<P>
Moultrie, population 16,000, is one of about 150 rural American towns protected 
since airline deregulation in 1978 by the government's Essential Air Service 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the towns are in isolated areas where bus and train service has 
diminished. While some of the flights are seldom used, they often are the only 
link, short of long car trips, between two cities. 
</P>
<P>
Under EAS provisions, the government pays the airlines to keep flying the 
routes. 
</P>
<P>
It would cost $31.6 million annually in subsidies to maintain current EAS 
flights, but only $25 million has been appropriated this fiscal year, and the 
Department of Transportation says cuts must be made. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern Atlantis Express, the Eastern Airlines affiliate that has operated the 
Atlanta-Moultrie route since 1983, had 1,248 scheduled departures between the 
two cities last year and sold 1,301 one-way tickets, an average of just over 
one a flight. 
</P>
<P>
The one-way fare is $104. Flight 3323's subsidies last year were $379,000, 
which works out to about $291 per passenger. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday morning, a reporter and Rosalind Johnson, a Moultrie native who lives 
in Denver, were the only passengers on the one-hour flight to this southern 
Georgia farm town. The amiable co-pilot walked back from the curtained cockpit, 
squatted in the aisle and explained the many safety features of the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
"Any questions?" he asked. "OK, let's go." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Makes Trip Often 
</P>
<P>
"I've been the only passenger on this flight many times," said Johnson, who has 
been making the trip often recently because of sick relatives. 
</P>
<P>
The town has no college or major industry. There is no Amtrak service within 
130 miles; the bus trip from Atlanta takes 5 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a shame not to have it," Johnson said of the airline route. "I 
don't know what I'll do if they stop -- fly to Albany and drive, I guess." 
Albany, with several daily flights, is a 40-minute drive from Moultrie. 
</P>
<P>
An inaudible message crackled over a loudspeaker. "Usually they just lean back 
into the cabin and shout if they want us to know something," she said over the 
engine. 
</P>
<P>
On the return to Atlanta, the plane held six passengers. One young woman going 
to Atlanta to visit friends said she usually drives. "But it's 3 1/2 hours each 
way and that gets long after a while," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In deciding what subsidies may be cut, the Transportation Department is looking 
at several factors, including whether air service is available elsewhere in the 
area, which routes have high subsidies and which routes have the fewest 
passengers. 
</P>
<P>
"We most likely will be targeted," said David Howard, a vice president of the 
Florence, S.C.-based Atlantis line. "We did refile last July to keep the 
market." He said the subsidy allows a profit of 5%. 
</P>
<P>
The Essential Air Service subsidy program was authorized for 10 years and has 
been extended, with modifications, into 1998. David Smallen, a spokesman for 
the House Public Works and Transportation Committee, said congressmen from 
rural districts are dedicated to keeping it.

LESLIE HALLIWELL; AUTHORED 'FILM GUIDE,' 'COMPANION' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leslie Halliwell, whose anthologies "The Filmgoer's Companion" and "Film Guide" 
have become as necessary as popcorn to motion picture aficionados, is dead of 
abdominal cancer at 59. 
</P>
<P>
Daily Variety, the entertainment trade publication, reported this week that he 
died Jan. 21 in the English town of Esher near London. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike most reference works, both Halliwell's "Companion," with thousands of 
entries about actors, writers, producers, directors and musicians, and his 
"Film Guide," with a list of 14,000 of the approximately 30,000 
English-language titles produced over the decades, are sprinkled with writings 
as heated as those of a Revolutionary War pamphleteer. 
</P>
<P>
Words such as "frothy," "completely unsatisfactory" and "wasted performances," 
vie with "splendid" and "spectacular" in both volumes. 
</P>
<P>
Newer actors compete with the legends for space. Keith Carradine merits nine 
lines. His late father, John, a half page. 
</P>
<P>
And there are the famous Halliwell quizzes -- Who was the Ringo Kid in 
"Stagecoach?" (John Wayne); to whom was Carole Lombard married when she died? 
(Clark Gable). 
</P>
<P>
Over the years the Halliwell who started his first edition of the "Companion" 
in 1965 grew less tolerant of his preferred medium than the Halliwell who 
published his eighth edition in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"I am still slightly too young to be a fuddy-duddy," he said a dozen years ago 
in an interview with The Times. "But I find few films of the '70s to my taste, 
their explicitness being no substitute for the imagination and skill which were 
poured into the studio products of Hollywood's golden age." 
</P>
<P>
Halliwell was a film reviewer and buyer of pictures for British television who 
was standing idly at a London cocktail party in 1964 when a fellow guest asked 
him what a one-volume film encyclopedia should contain. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Halliwell finished elaborating, the guest (who was a book 
publisher) encouraged him to publish it. 
</P>
<P>
"In my innocence," he said in 1980, "I was thinking of 10 or 12 paid volunteers 
to help me, but it turned out to be impossible to corral them." 
</P>
<P>
He began the work himself, pecking away at the entries in his spare time. In 
the introduction to the first edition, which had a foreword by Alfred 
Hitchcock, Halliwell said simply, "This book is for people who like movies." 
</P>
<P>
Compared to later editions (a ninth will be published in March) the original 
was skimpy. But each revision expanded by 20% on what had become two of the 
most popular books on films ever published (150,000 copies to date). The eighth 
edition contains 7,000 new or revised entries spread over 1,150 pages (in 
paperback). 
</P>
<P>
And how did he keep up with the credits, the deaths, the retirements, the new 
films? 
</P>
<P>
Copious notes, of course, he said when on a visit to Los Angeles in 1980. And 
"lots of correspondence." 
</P>
<P>
"Douglas Fairbanks Jr. wrote to argue about something I'd written about his 
father, and Joan Crawford blistered me for having her age wrong, or so she 
said." 
</P>
<P>
Not all were celebrities. Fans, scholars and the idly curious filled his 
mailbox daily. 
</P>
<P>
He catalogued everything in his study and put it all on casters. "File 
cabinets, chair, typewriter stand. When I need something I can wheel over to it 
without having to stand up. 
</P>
<P>
"(I) spend my weekends propelling myself around the study furiously, like Monty 
Woolley in 'The Man Who Came to Dinner.' " 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by a wife and son.

BATTLE OVER MEMORIAL TO WAR; 
</P>
<P>
KOREA VETERANS, RESIDENTS SQUARE OFF IN BITTER CONFLICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
There is a conflict raging in San Pedro about the proposed International Korean 
War Memorial at Angels Gate Park and the battle lines are rapidly being drawn. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past two weeks: 
</P>
<P>
* A meeting to resolve the dispute turned into a shouting match between 
veterans who back the memorial and residents who oppose it. 
</P>
<P>
One resident claimed the veterans -- some of whom live in San Pedro -- "acted 
like bullies." A veteran accused opposing residents of having "a closed mind." 
Said Mario Juravich, an aide to Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores: "We had a war, 
almost." 
</P>
<P>
* A residents' group has formed for the sole purpose of fighting the monument. 
Although some of its members do not want it at Angels Gate, others oppose only 
the design, which depicts a dozen 10-foot-high bronze soldiers in battle. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really violent, it has all these guns in it," said the group's leader, 
Richard Karl. "It's very inappropriate for a peaceful place like Angels Gate 
Park." 
</P>
<P>
* The International Korean War Veterans Memorial Committee, which is proposing 
the monument, last Saturday unveiled a model of the bronze sculpture, and the 
committee's executive director said its design is "not negotiable." He said he 
expects ground breaking to proceed as planned, on June 25. 
</P>
<P>
* Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, who initially offered the five-acre Angels 
Gate site to the veterans, has reaffirmed his backing for the project despite 
the swelling controversy. The mayor "supported the project from the beginning 
and he is still supporting it," an aide said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
* The city Department of Recreation and Parks, realizing there is opposition, 
has extended its comment period on the project, giving citizens until April 5 
to air their views. 
</P>
<P>
At the center of all the controversy is a plan for a $4-million complex that 
will stand on a promontory overlooking the Pacific, adjacent to the Korean 
Friendship Bell. It will honor "silent veterans of the Forgotten War," 
according to the memorial committee, which has raised about $1.6 million so 
far. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal calls for a piazza with the bronze battle sculpture in the center. 
The sculpture would rest atop a base of rock and granite that, according to the 
committee's literature, will be taken "from the very battlefields of Korea that 
they (the soldiers) died defending." 
</P>
<P>
The 24-feet-high centerpiece will be ringed with the flags of 22 nations that 
participated in the conflict. The plan is to light the monument until 10 p.m. 
and light the flags around the clock. That is another point of contention among 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
Although the outcome of the conflict in San Pedro remains unclear, it will no 
doubt depend -- at least in part -- on the recommendation of Flores. 
</P>
<P>
The councilwoman has no formal say in the matter, but her opinion will carry 
weight when the city Recreation and Parks Commission decides whether to approve 
the memorial. Although Mayor Bradley offered the land to the veterans, the 
commissioners -- who are appointed by the mayor -- will make the final 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
Flores has expressed two major reservations about the memorial: She does not 
like the word "war" included in its name, and she does not want it to overpower 
the bell and its large pagoda. She does not object to the sculpture's design, 
however. "It's a fact of life that there was a war," she said, "and this will 
depict that. 
</P>
<P>
"I personally don't have any problem with the monument itself," she said. "I'm 
not so sure about the size, but it seems to me that if the size could be 
adjusted to fit without being obtrusive in the community, then I wouldn't have 
any problem." 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the councilwoman said, her opinion does not really matter because 
she will do what the majority of her constituents want. So far, she said, most 
people she has talked to favor having some sort of memorial at the site. 
</P>
<P>
However, she expects the organizers of the memorial effort to be willing to 
compromise. "If the organizers are saying, 'It's our way or no way,' then it 
will probably end up no way." she said. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Stites, executive director of the International Korean War Veterans 
Memorial Committee, said his group is indeed willing to compromise -- about 
everything except the design of the sculpture. The group has already changed 
the design once. After city officials informed them that their plans for a 
40-foot monument exceeded height limits in the area, they scaled them down. 
</P>
<P>
However, Stites did say he would "welcome the help" of residents who have 
suggestions for the design of the setting for the monument. 
</P>
<P>
Stites' committee is an outgrowth of a group that calls itself the Chosin Few. 
All are survivors of the battle of the Chosin Reservoir, in which 3,000 
American, British and South Korean soldiers died, along with 25,000 Chinese 
troops. 
</P>
<P>
The battle began in the last week of November, 1950, when Chinese troops 
attacked United Nations forces as they approached the Chinese border from North 
Korea. China's entry into the war began a long retreat of United Nations 
forces, which had taken control of North Korea after the North's invasion of 
the South five months before. The scene in the monument is modeled after the 
veterans' remembrances of the reservoir battle. 
</P>
<P>
The Chosin Few initially proposed placing the monument in Washington, and took 
the idea to the American Battle Monuments Commission, an independent federal 
agency that oversees military cemeteries and monuments. 
</P>
<P>
"When they came to talk to me," recalled Army Col. William E. Ryan, the 
commission's director of operations and finance, "it was a Marine Corps 
memorial to the Battle of the Chosin Reservoir. It hadn't gotten to be an 
international Korean War memorial at that time." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
National Memorial Sought 
</P>
<P>
Ryan said he told the group that his agency had been pressing for more than a 
decade -- unsuccessfully -- to get the federal government to authorize a 
national memorial to all veterans of the Korean War. With limited public space 
available in Washington, he said, he thought chances were slim that Congress 
would approve a memorial for the Chosin Few, particularly when a national 
memorial had not yet been approved. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Thursday, Ryan -- who, coincidentally, attended high school in 
San Pedro in the late 1930s and early 1940s while his father was in the Navy -- 
said there was "no way" the Chosin Few memorial could have taken the place of 
the one his agency was proposing. 
</P>
<P>
Stites said his group was discouraged after the Washington meeting, and decided 
to look elsewhere. After embarking on a national site search and considering 
locations in New Orleans, San Diego and elsewhere, it recruited sculptor Felix 
de Weldon, who created the Iwo Jima Monument in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Mayor Bradley offered the group five acres at Angels Gate Park, just 
south of the Korean bell, which was given to the city by South Korea in 1976. 
At the time, the proposed monument was the only one in the country that would 
honor veterans of the Korean War. 
</P>
<P>
The following year, however, Congress approved the national memorial, which 
will be located in Washington, across the Mall from the memorial to Vietnam 
veterans. A national competition is under way to select the design of the 
Washington monument. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Competition for Design 
</P>
<P>
There was no competition for the design of the San Pedro memorial -- another 
point of contention among some residents. At some point, De Weldon -- who 
provided city officials their first glimpse of what the bronze sculpture would 
look like -- was replaced by sculptor Terry Jones, who specializes in battle 
sculpture. Jones' design for the sculpture was unveiled last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, since Bradley first offered the land in 1986, the proposal for the 
San Pedro monument has quietly moved through the city bureaucracy. The city 
Department of Cultural Affairs has approved the monument, and recreation and 
parks officials have issued a "negative declaration" for the project -- a 
document that says the monument, in effect, will not harm the environment. 
</P>
<P>
The Recreation and Parks Commissioners also gave tentative approval Feb. 13, 
1987, to the project, based on conceptual designs. 
</P>
<P>
And a committee of San Pedro citizens -- the Angels Gate Citizens Advisory 
Committee -- included the memorial in its master plan for the park without 
discussing it publicly during several months of deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
According to committee Chairman Jim Hawkins, the committee was informed by 
recreation officials that five acres adjacent to the Korean bell had been set 
aside for a "future historic monument" at the park. Nobody asked what the 
monument was. Some committee members were aware of the Chosin Few's plans. 
Others, including Hawkins, were not. 
</P>
<P>
After the controversy erupted at a recreation and parks public hearing in 
December, Flores asked the committee to reconvene, examine the pros and cons of 
the monument and make a recommendation to her. At last Wednesday's explosive 
meeting, the committee reaffirmed its initial decision to set aside land for 
the monument. 
</P>
<P>
However, the committee has yet to address the major point of dispute within the 
community: what the monument should look like, and in particular, the design of 
the sculpture. It intends to meet again Wednesday to take up that task. 
</P>
<P>
Stites, the Chosin Few executive director, sits on that committee and he 
resists the suggestion of some that the design promotes violence. 
</P>
<P>
"We selected the design that we felt showed what we remember of our experience 
in Korea," he said. "And I know of no other way to try and explain it to these 
people because in most part, I'm trying to explain something to a closed mind." 
</P>
<P>
Stites' opponents accuse him of the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
"They fought for freedom of choice and freedom of expression and they are 
almost trying to deny people that," said Karl, leader of the opposition group, 
Friends of the Friendship Bell. "They don't want to compromise." 
</P>
<P>
Said Greg Smith, another opposition group member: "I don't think we need to 
have uncounted generations of toddlers and grade-school kids looking up at 
machine guns, rifles and hand grenades in the hands of heroic bronze figures." 
</P>
<P>
But the veterans have indicated they will not back down without a fight. 
</P>
<P>
As George Vavrek, a former Marine from Torrance said, "There's more of us than 
there are of them."

CRISIS SHUTS EMERGENCY ROOM DOORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The scramble to provide care for the seriously ill in the San Fernando and 
Santa Clarita valleys has escalated recently as more area hospitals have 
routinely closed their emergency rooms and trauma centers to ambulances. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the Valley's largest hospitals have been shutting their emergency 
rooms to paramedic runs this month. And Wednesday, the Valley's three trauma 
centers shut down -- an almost unheard-of occurrence, health officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The emergency room at Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital in Santa Clarita has 
been closed for most of the past two weeks. The emergency facilities at St. 
Joseph Medical Center in Burbank have been diverting ambulances for at least 24 
days. In December, the availability of the emergency room at AMI Tarzana 
Regional Medical Center was touch-and-go for 19 days, according to county 
records. 
</P>
<P>
"We keep our fingers crossed nobody gets badly hurt when we are in the state of 
maximum stress and overload. That is not an uncommon scenario, unfortunately," 
said Dr. John McConnellogue, emergency department director at Northridge 
Hospital Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No One Has Died Yet 
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials emphasize that even when several emergency rooms are closed, 
patients in the Valley are still reaching hospitals within 10 or 15 minutes. No 
one has died in an ambulance as a result of the extra time it takes to reach a 
hospital, paramedic officials said. In a crunch, helicopters can whisk a 
patient across town when the closest hospitals are full. 
</P>
<P>
And even when an emergency room technically is closed, it is always open to 
walk-in patients. Anyone who passes through an emergency room's sliding glass 
doors, whether for a broken leg, the flu or a heart attack, will not be turned 
away. 
</P>
<P>
Local hospital administrators blame the problem primarily on the flu epidemic, 
a nursing shortage and timing -- January is traditionally a busy time for many 
hospitals. When a hospital's intensive-care beds upstairs are filled, it does 
not want to accept additional critically ill patients down in its emergency 
room. Consequently, an emergency room can sometimes look like a ghost town and 
still be closed to new patients. 
</P>
<P>
One Los Angeles County health official speculated last week that some Valley 
hospitals are closing more frequently to send a tough message to Gov. George 
Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes me wonder whether there is some sort of concerted effort to make a 
point, to raise the level of awareness that the hospitals want more money from 
the governor and to start putting money into the failing system," the official 
said, asking not to be named because he must maintain a good relationship with 
the hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
The crunch in emergency care has frustrated and angered paramedics. On 
occasion, it has also overwhelmed emergency room personnel when the closures 
are overruled by county health officials downtown. There is a built-in 
safeguard to ensure that medical emergency care is always available: When all 
the hospital emergency rooms in an area have declared themselves closed, county 
health officials have the authority to reopen them all. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not the Best of Care' 
</P>
<P>
During those times, "it's not the best of care when you have numerous critical 
patients arriving all at once," said Paul Hensler, president of Holy Cross 
Medical Center in Mission Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Morin, the Los Angeles Fire Department's paramedic supervisor in the 
West Valley, agreed. "I don't think there has been a terrible diminishing of 
patient care," but "the fact they are overburdened at times could have some 
impact," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The situation becomes most serious when the Valley's three trauma centers -- at 
Northridge, Holy Cross and St. Joseph -- are overwhelmed. Trauma centers are 
geared to treat victims of violent crimes and those severely injured in traffic 
and other accidents. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike emergency rooms, trauma centers cannot be ordered reopened once closed. 
Therefore, anyone who needed to be rushed to a Valley trauma center on a day 
like Wednesday -- when all three were shut down -- would have been transported 
to an emergency room unless he or she could have been flown to a trauma center 
outside the area. 
</P>
<P>
At an emergency room, trauma victims might not receive the treatment provided 
by a trauma center's specially trained surgeons and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"People who could have used a trauma center to save their life didn't have 
access to them," said Chief Alan R. Cowen, head of emergency medical services 
for the Los Angeles Fire Department, referring to Wednesday's closures. "Would 
you want a member of your family that needs a surgeon to go to a local 
emergency room?" 
</P>
<P>
According to county health guidelines, trauma patients must reach a hospital 
within 20 minutes. Paramedics try to deliver patients to emergency rooms in 10 
to 15 minutes. With the hospital pool shrinking, helicopters are being used in 
the Valley more frequently to beat the clock. 
</P>
<P>
That's what happened early last week after a truck driver experienced severe 
chest pains in Castaic. His illness touched off a frantic search that stretched 
from Bakersfield to Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Physicians at the closest hospital, Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial, were tied up 
treating three victims of a bad car crash on the Antelope Valley Freeway. Holy 
Cross was also closed to more patients. A quick decision had to be made to 
transport the trucker by helicopter to either Northridge or Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
Hypothetically, this is what would have happened last week if, for example, a 
motorist were severely injured in an accident at Valley Circle and Victory 
boulevards in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Had Northridge's trauma center been closed, Holy Cross would have been the 
second choice. If it too was closed, the paramedic would have driven to St. 
Joseph, provided traffic was light enough to permit an arrival time within 20 
minutes or less. If that had been impossible, paramedics either would have 
flown the victim to UCLA's trauma center or driven to the nearest Valley 
emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Money Troubles 
</P>
<P>
Compounding the uncertainty over when the gridlock will ease are the hospitals' 
funding problems. 
</P>
<P>
The governor aroused panic among county health officials recently when his 
proposed budget indicated that the hospitals would not be receiving added funds 
from Proposition 99, the tobacco-tax initiative passed by voters in November. 
</P>
<P>
The tax, expected to produce $650 million annually, was partly intended to 
subsidize hospitals for treating uninsured patients. But Deukmejian wants to 
reduce the state's funding of hospitals from other sources, thereby deflating 
the financial benefits of Proposition 99. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital administrators said they were disappointed by the governor's decision 
and hope that pressure from the hospital industry will change his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"The state is where a lot of responsibility lies," Hensler said. "We have been 
lobbying the governor for some time, but the governor is pretty adamant on his 
views, especially since he is not running for reelection." 
</P>
<P>
Both Holy Cross and St. Joseph lose $1.5 million a year maintaining their 
trauma centers, according to the hospitals' executives. Without relief from 
Proposition 99, both are examining how costs can be cut. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Fahey, St. Joseph's senior associate administrator, said the hospital hopes 
that the county will relax some of its costly trauma-care standards, such as 
requiring that a surgeon be on staff 24 hours a day. If pressures don't ease, 
St. Joseph might explore pulling out of the trauma-care business, Fahey said. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless, the on-again, off-again bed shortage in the Valley does not begin 
to approach the depth of the crisis in the inner city. There, hospitals have 
been closing or threatening to close their overworked trauma centers for 
financial reasons. The inner-city hospitals handle the majority of the trauma 
cases -- a seemingly endless stream of stabbing and gunshot victims, most of 
whom have no insurance. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Valley has more hospitals than the inner city, and their 
resources are not as taxed by indigent patients. 
</P>
<P>
Olive View Medical Center appears to be the only Valley hospital negatively 
affected by the crisis in the inner city. When beds are filled at County-USC 
Medical Center, overflow patients go to Olive View in Sylmar. Since July, Olive 
View's emergency room has experienced a 34% jump in patients. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say that Olive View will continue to see increases in the emergency 
room, and we'll probably see more days of closures," said Jaron Gammons, the 
hospital's associate administrator.

GAUDY DAYS OF CASTAIC'S GREAT RANGE WAR; 
</P>
<P>
LAND 2 PATRIARCHS FOUGHT OVER SOAKED UP THEIR FEUDING BLOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The "Jenkins-Chormicle Affair" is all but forgotten these days, but, in its 
time, the great range war of Castaic was as bitter and savage as the legendary 
Hatfield-McCoy feud. 
</P>
<P>
The killing started in 1890 when a crusty rancher known as "Old Man" Chormicle 
pierced one man's heart and another's liver with a few well-placed rifle 
blasts. By some accounts, the ensuing feud took 22 lives by the time that the 
last gunshots rang through the Castaic hills 26 years later. 
</P>
<P>
Today, two local historians are working on books that may resurrect interest in 
the colorful but little-known conflict, which started over a boundary dispute. 
And since the Castaic Union School District is celebrating its centennial this 
year with an expanded local-history curriculum, schoolchildren will learn about 
the feud in their studies. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the story of the Jenkins and Chormicle clans will once again 
intrigue and horrify the townspeople of Castaic, perhaps for the first time in 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a sad story," said Pat Clark Callachor, an Ojai resident and 
granddaughter of Robert Emmett Clark, a ranger credited with temporarily 
halting the hostilities in 1905. "There's the romance of the Old West tied to 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Reynolds, a former president of the Santa Clarita Valley Historical 
Society, said most people are unaware that Castaic, now a growing bedroom 
community more commonly known as a truck stop, was the site of barn-burnings, 
ambushes and gun battles on horseback. The Jenkins-Chormicle Affair faded from 
memory, he explained, because old-timers and descendants of the combatants 
simply refused to talk about it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Black Eye' 
</P>
<P>
"It was something they would just as soon forget," Reynolds said. "I think they 
thought it was a black eye on the community." 
</P>
<P>
The result is a story that is part fact and probably part myth. Some newspapers 
of the era said 22 people were slain. Others said 11 died. Callachor's 
grandfather put the death toll at 21. 
</P>
<P>
A full account has never been written, said Callachor, who is publications 
director of the Ventura County Museum of History and Art and one of the two 
historians researching the subject. 
</P>
<P>
"The impression you get is that it was completely lawless," Callachor said. 
</P>
<P>
The scraps of information collected by the authors, the museum and the 
historical society paint a colorful picture, with blood red the dominant color. 
</P>
<P>
The only certainty is that the Jenkins and Chormicle families were headed by 
two ornery, independent and, when necessary, cruel patriarchs. Based on the 
historians' accounts, this is their story: 
</P>
<P>
William C. (Old Man) Chormicle, born in 1840, was a rancher who could swear 
like a sailor. His ranch now lies 100 feet below the waters backed up behind 
Castaic Dam. " 'Old Man' Chormicle was an uncomplicated fellow," Clark, the 
ranger, once told an interviewer. "He wore two six-guns and usually carried a 
rifle in case any argument started at long range." 
</P>
<P>
As a defendant in a 1907 civil suit over grazing rights, Chormicle was asked in 
court if he had threatened to kill a man. "I don't think it was like 
threatening to kill him," he replied. "I told him that if he interfered with 
the girl driving her cattle, I would take some of the boys down with a rope and 
hang him." 
</P>
<P>
Chormicle's rival was William W. Jenkins, a horse breeder, ranger and pioneer 
oil man whose Lazy Z ranch is now the site of a housing development called 
Stonebridge. A crafty poker player, for decades, Jenkins claimed that he had 
purchased the rights to Alcatraz Island, but later said the deed was lost 
during a card game in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"Jenkins was a great knife-thrower, always wore a vest with a throwing knife in 
a holster under it," Clark was quoted as saying. "He generally rode in a buggy 
and let his six-shooter lie on the seat beside him." 
</P>
<P>
In 1895, Jenkins heard that swampland could be purchased cheaply under a 
special government program. Following the letter of the law, Jenkins boarded a 
boat to survey and claim most of the land between his ranch and where Magic 
Mountain sits today. But since Castaic didn't really have a swamp, Jenkins 
mounted a boat on wheels and had it pulled by big black horses. Several 
ranchers, Chormicle included, exposed the scheme, and Jenkins' attempt to buy 
the land as swampland was thwarted. 
</P>
<P>
The feud actually started five years before the failed swamp purchase. Jenkins 
said he owned the land that Chormicle had recently settled and sent two of his 
men, George Walton and Dolores Cook, over to Chormicle's hastily built cabin to 
muscle him out. 
</P>
<P>
The gunfire started a week later. Annie Rose Briggs, daughter of one of 
Chormicle's allies, wrote in a 1959 letter that Walton was "instantly killed 
with two rifle bullets an inch apart through his heart." Cook died four hours 
later in Jenkins' ranch house "with his liver shot to pieces." 
</P>
<P>
Chormicle, accused of murder, pleaded self-defense and was acquitted June 18, 
1890, after the jury deliberated five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fight Over Grazing Rights 
</P>
<P>
The feud continued as the two families fought over road laws, mining laws, 
grazing rights and water rights, Reynolds said. Women and children generally 
were left unharmed, although, once, a girl was accidentally killed during cross 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
In 1905, Ranger Clark intimidated the combatants into laying down their arms -- 
at least temporarily. One of the ranger's 10 children, 82-year-old William P. 
Clark of Camarillo, said his father proved his mettle the first time he met up 
with Jenkins. 
</P>
<P>
The ranger had fenced off a spring, angering Jenkins, Clark recalled. Jenkins 
pulled out a forest manual and, using his pistol as a pointer, showed the 
ranger codes that prohibited fences there. 
</P>
<P>
Ranger Clark then pulled out his own pistol to point out an exception to the 
code, his son said. "After that, they became pretty good friends," Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
Ranger Clark eventually left Castaic, and the shooting resumed in 1913 when a 
man blasted Jenkins in the chest as he stood in the doorway of the Lazy Z ranch 
house. The 80-year-old patriarch survived, but his attacker, believed to be a 
Chormicle, was later killed by shotgun blasts, presumably fired by a Jenkins. 
</P>
<P>
The fighting finally ended three years later when Billy Rose, one of 
Chormicle's allies, shot Jenkins dead in Charlie Canyon as the old man tried to 
drive off Rose's cattle. By that time, Jenkins had amassed quite a collection 
of unretrieved bullets. 
</P>
<P>
"They said when they buried Jenkins, he still had seven bullets in his body," 
Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
Though legend has it that 22 slayings took place, the historians have accounted 
for only eight, a fact sure to disappoint the curious. 
</P>
<P>
"People seem to want to know more about it," Reynolds said. "It's the same 
whether you're talking to a group of senior citizens or kindergartners."

2 ACCIDENTS ON SAME SIMI STREET KILL MOTORCYCLIST, INJURE 7 OTHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Simi Valley street was the scene of two major accidents about 11 hours apart, 
one of which resulted in the death of a teen-age motorcyclist, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Armstrong, 17, of Simi Valley was struck and killed at 12:09 p.m. Friday 
as he was riding his motorcycle on Fitzgerald Road west of Mead Avenue. 
Armstrong, who was not wearing a helmet, hit a car driven by David Schmidt, 19, 
of Simi Valley, who was making a U-turn, Police Lt. Don Austin said. 
</P>
<P>
Schmidt suffered severe cuts to the face and hands, and Armstrong's companion 
on the motorcycle, Robert Molidor, suffered a broken leg and head injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Almost 11 hours later, five Simi Valley teen-agers were injured near the same 
spot on Fitzgerald when their driver lost control of the car, which hit a 
parked motor home and car, Austin said. 
</P>
<P>
Two passengers, Hugo Hernandez, 16, and Lisa Avendano, 15, were in critical 
condition from head injuries Saturday at Simi Valley Adventist Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Another passenger, Lori Duron, 15, was in satisfactory condition. The other two 
occupants, including the 15-year-old unlicensed driver, were treated and 
released from the hospital.

'THE SYSTEM' GETS BLAME FOR PAROLE OF DANGEROUS KILLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T. W. McGARRY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When a woman reporter told Parole Officer Hugh Alcott that she wanted to 
interview convicted murderer Raymond George after his release to a North 
Hollywood neighborhood two weeks ago, Alcott responded in horror: 
</P>
<P>
"I think you're crazy as hell if you do. He likes to chop up women." 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Deputy Dist. Atty. Roger Kelly, who successfully prosecuted 
George for killing a state police officer and permanently crippling a college 
student with a machete, said he wanted to know where George was living on 
parole "because I don't want to be anywhere around there." Kelly described 
George as "one of the most dangerous individuals I've ever encountered, a real 
clear and present danger to society." 
</P>
<P>
From the Los Angeles Police Department, which sent North Hollywood officers a 
circular warning them to use "extreme caution" with George, to George's 
neighbors, who were frightened by the cautionary circular after it was leaked, 
to those in the criminal justice system who have known him for years, George's 
new freedom evokes a common response: Alarm. 
</P>
<P>
It is usually followed by some form of the question: Why isn't he locked up? 
</P>
<P>
The explanation for what happened in the case of George, 36, is both simple and 
complicated. 
</P>
<P>
The simple version, as state corrections authorities have stressed repeatedly, 
is that the law requires that George be turned loose, under certain conditions. 
One of them is that he take a daily dose of a drug that is supposed to control 
what a parole supervisor called "a delicate psychiatric condition" of paranoid 
schizophrenia. 
</P>
<P>
The complicated answer lies in changes in the laws, going back 20 years, 
regarding sentencing of criminals and locking up mental patients against their 
will. It is those changes that enabled George to slide through the system, the 
beneficiary of a series of breaks because of the timing of his case. 
</P>
<P>
The publicity given George's North Hollywood address and protests from 
neighbors prodded parole authorities to move him Tuesday to a new, secret 
location, which they describe only as a "staff-operated facility" where he is 
under 24-hour surveillance, in Los Angeles but outside the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
George was originally convicted of second-degree murder for the Oct. 21, 1974, 
killing of David Jack, 21, a state police officer who was guarding a state 
building in downtown Los Angeles. Paroled after eight years and four months, he 
was rearrested three years later and imprisoned for carrying a concealed knife. 
</P>
<P>
The killing climaxed a series of four assaults in 1974 in Los Angeles County. 
In the first, George attacked a 21-year-old college student with a machete, 
leaving her permanently disabled and disfigured, according to police records. 
</P>
<P>
Five days later, when he was stopped by two police officers, he disarmed one of 
them and shot him four times with his own gun. The officer survived after 
extensive surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Later that year, George was stopped by two sheriff's deputies on suspicion of 
stealing car parts, fought with them and tried to take their guns. He was 
arrested and released on bail. Fifteen days later, he killed Officer Jack. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Indeterminate Sentence 
</P>
<P>
George was sentenced in 1975 to 22 1/2-years-to-life. Under the system then in 
force, George's sentence was for an indeterminate period, leaving his release 
to be determined by a parole board responsible for weighing evidence of 
rehabilitation against a prisoner's danger to society. 
</P>
<P>
But the system was being revised. Between 1971 and 1978, California converted 
from one philosophy of criminal justice, which stressed rehabilitation, to 
another predicated on punishment. The purpose was to give parole boards less 
voice in determining how long prisoners remained behind bars. Only first-degree 
murderers remained subject to parole board discretion, and George's conviction 
was for second-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
Under the transitional system, prisoners such as George were given new, fixed 
terms by a sentencing board, but became eligible for parole before completing 
them. 
</P>
<P>
George received a fixed term of 12 years and 4 months, probably well short of 
what he would have served under the old system, said Pat Kenady, assistant 
director of the state Department of Correction's liaison office to the 
Legislature. That made George eligible to be paroled after eight years and five 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the board had been instructed to give prisoners the benefit of 
lower terms, with allowances for special circumstances such as having previous 
convictions, "sometimes it's hard to understand how they came up with these 
(new) sentences," Kenady said. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people were let out. I don't have an accurate figure but it was 
probably a couple of hundred for second-degree murder." 
</P>
<P>
In the years after the conversion, sentences for virtually all major crimes 
were lengthened and the parole board's discretion over second-degree murderers 
was restored. But in the meantime, George "escaped both systems," Kenady said. 
</P>
<P>
"If he had been sentenced after 1978 for that, he would have gotten 15 years to 
life," Kenady said. "Today he wouldn't be eligible for parole for at least 10 
years, and there would be discretion all the way up. The board could decide 
whether he was a danger to the public, and if they decided to release him, now 
the governor could intervene." 
</P>
<P>
That is because the timing of George's case also eluded the strictures of 
Proposition 89, a constitutional amendment passed in November, which took 
effect this year. The new law empowers the governor to revoke the paroles of 
first- or second-degree murderers within 30 days of the parole board's 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
That law would not have applied to George's latest parole on the weapons law 
conviction, but he would have been subject to it if he were still imprisoned on 
his original murder conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Corrections officials say that because his case was handled during the 
sentencing "gap," George was allowed to go free on parole on his first murder 
conviction, be rearrested, convicted again, sent back to prison and paroled 
again -- all during a period when under current law he might otherwise have 
been behind bars on the first conviction. 
</P>
<P>
George was not alone in benefitting from what some state correctional officials 
now refer to as the "sentence gap" or "interregnum" of the mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"We have some real anomalies coming out of this period," which created an 
entire generation of prisoners who served comparatively short sentences, Kenady 
said, including many who figure in controversies about the system, such as 
Lawrence Singleton, Theodore Streleski and Archie Fain. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Confusing Period' 
</P>
<P>
"The Raymond Georges of this world, the Streleskis, Singleton, the problems 
with them all date from that confusing period," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Singleton, convicted of raping a young woman and chopping off her forearms, was 
paroled in 1986 after serving eight years. Officials had to move him repeatedly 
as his location was revealed, setting off protests in one Northern California 
community after another. 
</P>
<P>
Streleski served seven years for killing his Stanford University mathematics 
professor by hammering his skull in 1978. He left prison saying he felt no 
remorse. Authorities said he had been given the maximum term possible at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Fain was originally sentenced to death for killing a 17-year-old boy and raping 
two high school girls in rural Stanislaus County in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
The sentence was overturned on appeal and converted to life in prison. During 
the changeover in the system, however, Fain obtained parole dates, provoking an 
outpouring of protest, including a 62,500-signature petition. Deukmejian's 
efforts to block the parole led to a showdown between the judicial and 
executive branches that the courts won in 1983, setting the stage for passage 
of Proposition 89. 
</P>
<P>
George was paroled on the murder and assault convictions in 1983. In 1986, he 
was convicted of carrying a concealed knife and was sentenced to four years. 
With credit for working and for good behavior, he served three years and was 
automatically paroled this month. 
</P>
<P>
State law required that George be returned to the county where he was 
convicted, said Jerry DiMaggio, regional administrator of the parole division. 
</P>
<P>
His release this month was subject to psychiatric treatment for mental problems 
diagnosed in prison. There are indications that those problems extended back at 
least to 1985, when shortly after his first parole expired, Los Angeles police 
officers found him wandering in the street, naked, with a steak knife plunged 
into one of his eyes. He had tried to blind himself, police said, but his sight 
survived. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Complex Review System 
</P>
<P>
Again, George may have benefited from timing. At one time, such conduct could 
have gotten him committed to a mental hospital. But experts say it has become 
far more difficult to commit anyone to a mental hospital involuntarily in 
California since the landmark Lanterman-Petris-Short Act went into effect in 
1969 with the aim of eliminating past abuses. 
</P>
<P>
Because the law now provides a complex array of judicial reviews of patients' 
rights and limitations on authority, it is tough today to commit mentally 
disturbed people. In Los Angeles County, judges reject about 20% of commitment 
requests, according to the county Department of Mental Health. The number of 
patients has fallen from 37,500 held in 10 state mental hospitals in 1959 to 
about 5,000 in five hospitals today. 
</P>
<P>
In George's case, a condition of parole is that he take daily doses of drugs 
that are intended to calm the urge to violence. 
</P>
<P>
Alcott, his parole supervisor, said a psychiatric examination in prison, where 
George was undergoing therapy, found him "totally in remission and 
cooperative." He said George "seems calmer today, and he understands he's got 
to keep a low profile and stay on his medication." 
</P>
<P>
Daily supervision by parole agents will ensure that George takes the drugs, 
Alcott said. However, the supervision will stop when his parole expires in 
about a year. 
</P>
<P>
Mental health officials would not discuss George's case specifically. But Dr. 
Paul Grossman, a UCLA psychiatry professor, said the odds are not high that 
someone being treated forcibly with the drugs will continue taking them 
voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
Studies show that at least 25%, and perhaps 50%, of young males stop taking the 
drugs when supervision ends, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The drugs are inherently unpleasant," he said. "They produce a syndrome called 
akathesia, a disturbing restlessness, a compulsion to stay in motion which 
cannot be easily quelled. At the same time, they make you sleepy, sleepy but 
unable to sit still -- a very unpleasant sensation." 
</P>
<P>
He said they also have side effects, such as tremors, muscle rigidity and fixed 
eyes. "The tongue gets stuck and protrudes out of the mouth and you can't get 
it back inside. Your eyes stare upward and you can't make them stop. It 
frightens them." 
</P>
<P>
Also, he said, schizophrenics find it humiliating to admit they have a mental 
problem. "Taking the medication is a daily acknowledgement that you're mentally 
ill, a constant reminder of your humiliation. Patients go off the drugs to deny 
their illness." 
</P>
<P>
When George will be allowed to move into an apartment of his own, and what will 
happen next, are undecided, said DiMaggio, the parole supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
"It depends on what happens once the interest dies down," he said.

MUSIC SOOTHES TEMPERS AS PUPILS AUDITION 
</P>

Los Angeles teachers and school district officials might not agree on much 
these days, but harmony prevailed Saturday when 50 teachers volunteered to work 
on their day off to help young musicians get a start on their careers. 
</P>
<P>
The sounds of flutes, pianos, saxophones and other instruments filled the 
hallways of the Los Angeles City College Music Building as 150 nervous 
elementary school students auditioned for a chance at scholarships offered by 
the Los Angeles City Elementary School Music Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a chance for them to get their foot in the door," said Evelyn Cain, a 
music teacher in Los Angeles schools for 25 years. Cain brought 14 of her 
students from Sheridan Street Elementary School in Boyle Heights to audition 
for the scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
The "E" string on sixth-grader Alia Edwards' violin snapped just before she 
launched into her audition, a rendition of a Bach march. The mishap didn't seem 
to faze her, though. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Just Came Natural' 
</P>
<P>
"I was scared at first, but then it just came natural," the 11-year-old from 
South-Central Los Angeles said as she received an embrace from her mother, 
Rachel Boodram. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a big opportunity for her, an inner-city kid getting a chance," 
Boodram said. 
</P>
<P>
The scholarships are paid for by the music association's members, most of whom 
are elementary school teachers, said Fran Benedict, a music teacher who helped 
coordinate the annual auditions. The 40 students who win $250 scholarships will 
receive private lessons, many for the first time, Benedict said. The program 
began in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel strongly about this, that's why we're here on our day off," said Merv 
Chase, 37, a voice teacher at several schools in the San Fernando Valley. "You 
don't get paid for it, but you do get paid in a different way, by seeing the 
kids excel and do well." 
</P>
<P>
Members of the United Teachers of Los Angeles have been involved in a contract 
dispute with the Los Angeles Unified School District since last year, and say 
they will refuse to turn in grades next month. Last week, thousands of high 
school and junior high school students protested, demanding their grades and 
supporting teachers in the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
But the controversy seemed to be far from the teachers' minds Saturday as they 
helped their students through the sometimes stressful auditions. 
</P>
<P>
Music teacher Cain played a piano accompaniment while one of her students, 
Anthony Zuniga, 10, auditioned on the trombone. 
</P>
<P>
"Give a great big wind, the best that you've got," Cain counseled the 
diminutive trombonist as he launched into a rendition of "900 Miles," an 
American folk song. 
</P>
<P>
The three-judge panel applauded loudly when he finished, remarking with 
astonishment that he had memorized his piece. 
</P>
<P>
"All right, Anthony, nerves of steel," said judge Les Lovitt, a professional 
trumpet player. Anthony and the others will find out if they won early this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how he had done, Anthony merely shrugged his shoulders and smiled.

USC STUDENT WOUNDED BY GUNSHOT AS TWO MEN ATTACK HER NEAR CAMPUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MALNIC, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 21-year-old USC student was in guarded condition at County-USC Medical Center 
late Saturday after she was shot in the back when two men attacked her as she 
entered her apartment house just north of the campus. 
</P>
<P>
Kimberly Warfield, an engineering student and ROTC cadet from Harborcreek, Pa., 
told friends who came to her aid that she had no idea why one of the men shot 
her as she walked into the university-owned two-story complex in the 600 block 
of West 27th St., a block north of Sorority/Fraternity Row, on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the neighborhood south of downtown around USC has become one of 
the highest crime areas in the city, with students becoming the victims of 
robbery, rape and even murder. At least seven attacks occurred on the campus 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concern for Security 
</P>
<P>
The campus has expanded its security force, and much of the student housing -- 
like the Stardust complex where Warfield was shot -- has taken on a 
fortress-like aspect, with locked entry gates and steel bars covering 
first-floor windows. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they had no suspects and knew of no motive in Friday night's 
attack. Campus police were unable to add further information, and university 
officials were not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Roy, 22, an undergraduate who lives in the student housing complex, said 
he was sitting in his first-floor apartment at about 10 p.m. with his 
girlfriend, Michelle Delvaux, 22, when they heard "a sound like a backfire, 
only louder." 
</P>
<P>
"It was quiet for a second," he said. "Then I heard (Warfield) shouting, 'I've 
been shot! I've been shot! My God, I've been shot!' " 
</P>
<P>
Roy said he dashed out of his apartment to find Warfield "staggering forward, 
holding her chest. 
</P>
<P>
"The apartment manager, Danny Wexler, caught her in his arms and guided her 
into his apartment," Roy said. "We put her on the floor, and I covered her up 
-- tried to keep her from going into shock -- while Danny called 911. 
</P>
<P>
"The bullet had hit her in the back and come out her chest. She wasn't bleeding 
much, but you could tell she was in a lot of pain." 
</P>
<P>
While waiting for police, Roy said, he and Delvaux talked with the young woman, 
trying to keep her conscious until medical help arrived. 
</P>
<P>
"She didn't have a parking permit, so she parked on the street," Roy said. "She 
said she was walking from her car to the gate," a massive, steel-mesh structure 
enclosing the entry to the building. Sgt. John Bunch of the Southwest detective 
unit said Warfield told police that someone in a powder-blue car, possibly a 
Chevrolet Impala, called out, "Hey, come here." Bunch said Warfield became 
frightened, unlocked the gate and entered. 
</P>
<P>
A passenger in the car got out, managed to reach the gate before it closed and 
fired one shot at Warfield, hitting her in the right side of her back, the 
victim told police. Bunch said the bullet pierced her lung. 
</P>
<P>
Roy said the men then drove away. He described Warfield as a "very nice, very 
quiet" neighbor who has been living in the complex with two roommates during 
the last academic year. He said the roommates, who both were away Friday, were 
upset when they returned Saturday morning to learn what had happened. 
</P>
<P>
"We're always concerned about the security around here," he said. "This is a 
bad neighborhood. People are always approaching you for money. 
</P>
<P>
"We're an island in the middle of a storm."

ETHNIC POLITICS CALL FOR DEFT HANDLING OF DIVERSE INTERESTS 
</P>

About a month ago, attorney Theodore M. Shaw of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund 
stepped into an elevator outside his Spring Street office and rode upstairs. On 
the 11th floor, he walked a few steps to the office of Richard J. Fajardo, a 
lawyer for the Mexican American Legal Defense Fund. 
</P>
<P>
The subject of the meeting: The suits by the U.S. Justice Department and MALDEF 
to force Los Angeles County to redraw boundaries of the five county 
supervisorial districts to give Latinos a chance to win a seat on the Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Legal Victories 
</P>
<P>
Shaw was informing Fajardo that the county's black leadership, as represented 
by the local chapters of the NAACP, the Urban League and the Southern Christian 
Leadership Conference, had filed suit to intervene in the reapportionment case. 
Their object was to assure that black political representation would not be 
weakened if new district lines are drawn. 
</P>
<P>
MALDEF and the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People have won 
many legal victories throughout the country, cracking the barrier of 
segregation and assuring voting rights for blacks and Latinos. As part of that 
tradition, Shaw and Fajardo were carrying the fight to Los Angeles County, 
where an all-Anglo Board of Supervisors governs a county of more than 8 
million, most of whom are not Anglo. A United Crusade study last year said 33% 
of the county's residents were Latino, 11.6% black and 12.4% Asian. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting was friendly. "We get along fine," Fajardo said. "They use our 
library." But it was more than a simple conference between allies. The 
situation was more complicated. While Latinos, blacks and Asians have a common 
goal of winning more minority political representation, each group has its own 
agenda. As a result, there have been conflicts in a county that has become one 
of the nation's biggest multi-ethnic centers. 
</P>
<P>
Interviews with black and Asian attorneys and leaders show that they support 
the Justice Department lawsuit. But they view the reapportionment issue as a 
test of cooperation and good will among the three groups in the increasingly 
ethnic politics of Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
The voices speaking up on reapportionment also illustrate how politics are 
changing here. "It is reflective of the changed demographics of the town," said 
Mark Ridley-Thomas, who heads the local chapter of the Southern Christian 
Leadership Conference. "There are now Asian-Pacific players, Latino players. 
That is just a function of diversity." 
</P>
<P>
The conference between Shaw and Fajardo thus touched on the deep soul-searching 
and mixed feelings among Latino, black and Asian leaders over the federal 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
The black leaders fear that redistricting might hurt black chances to win a 
supervisorial seat. Asian lawyers are concerned that redistricting will divide 
the Asian population among supervisorial districts in a way that will diminish 
chances for political influence. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how the scenario will play out," said John Mack, head of the 
local chapter of the Urban League. "Maybe this can serve as a positive example 
of how these . . . minority groups can advance their interests without being 
against each other." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drive for Power 
</P>
<P>
Weeks before the meeting between Fajardo and Shaw, black leaders began to 
consider how to deal with the Latino drive for power in county government. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the black concerns were expressed in an interview last week with 
Ridley-Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are witnessing now in rather an unprecedented way is a high degree of 
assertiveness, even call it aggressiveness, on the part of the Latino community 
to assure those things that are important in the way of fulfillment of rights," 
he said. "Some of this (shows) . . . an unfortunate degree of insensitivity to 
other ethnic groups. What is most disconcerting about some of what is going on 
in the Latino community is the extent in which there is a strong implication 
that 'blacks had their day. They got more than they deserve and we are here to 
get what we deserve even if it means we have to take some of that from blacks.' 
Now that is difficult to swallow." 
</P>
<P>
Those feelings, Ridley-Thomas said, were expressed in discussions among the 
black leadership. But on the other hand, he said, black leaders realized that 
they and Latinos had a common goal of "saying to the county Board of 
Supervisors, 'Get off the dime.' On this point, both communities are working 
together because neither community is represented on the Board of Supervisors." 
</P>
<P>
Fajardo's constituency had complex feelings about the black leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilwoman Gloria Molina was one of those. Molina represents 
a central Los Angeles district created by a similar Justice Department lawsuit 
that forced the City Council to redraw its district lines to provide another 
council seat in a Latino area. She has been active in efforts to increase 
Latino representation on the council, the Board of Supervisors and in the 
Legislature since 1971. 
</P>
<P>
"We sat on the sidelines for a very, very long time in Los Angeles and have not 
had a voice," she said in an interview, recalling failed Latino efforts in past 
reapportionment fights. 
</P>
<P>
"We finally have been able to put together a group of Hispanic lawyers who have 
the ability to pursue these kinds of cases. I remember 1971. I remember groups 
of lawyers getting together and talking about it: 'Who is going to do the work, 
where are we going to get the money, how do we do it, who is talented enough to 
be able to intervene?' We didn't have the mechanism. Now we have a group like 
MALDEF, funded by the community, and we have lawyers from the community who 
have those kinds of interests." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Correct and Right Thing' 
</P>
<P>
Molina said: "From the standpoint of black leaders, it is probably the correct 
and right thing for them to do (intervene in the case). Their interests are no 
different than our interests. . . . There is a sizable black population in Los 
Angeles County that deserves to have a voice in what goes on in county politics 
and county policy issues. Hispanics the same way. And Asians are certainly 
emerging as a large group." 
</P>
<P>
Molina, however, said she approaches ethnic coalition politics with caution. 
That is because of her experience as a state assemblywoman. When she opposed 
construction of a state prison in her East Los Angeles Assembly district three 
years ago, she had to buck the Speaker of the Assembly, Willie Brown, who is 
black, and his Los Angeles ally, Democratic Assemblywoman Maxine Waters, one of 
the community's most influential black leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I was going to have Willie Brown, who was going to understand this, 
Maxine Waters, who was going to understand this, and a lot of other natural 
allies," she said. "And that didn't happen. It was real disappointing and I had 
to sit there and say, 'Wait a minute, when it was (something) in their back 
yard, they want Chicanos to go out and rally about it, but when it is something 
that hurt us, why weren't they there with us?' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Be Very Cautious' 
</P>
<P>
What did that teach her about ethnic politics? "To be very cautious and to be 
very careful about building coalitions and to talk about reciprocity because a 
coalition should be built on that, too," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Asian community leaders fear that new district lines could further divide their 
neighborhoods, now generally concentrated in a corridor in the center of Los 
Angeles and in the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Now divided between two supervisorial districts, Asians find it hard to get a 
hearing in the county Hall of Administration on issues important to them, said 
Stewart Kwoh, executive director of the Asian Pacific American Legal Center of 
Southern California. Among these issues are social services and health services 
for the growing Asian immigrant population. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Asian population, while as numerous as blacks, is too scattered in 
the county to advance legal claims for a supervisorial district, Kwoh said, and 
will not intervene in the case. But he said leaders will watch the current 
lawsuit carefully to see if Asian political interests are protected. 
</P>
<P>
"We will remember who was worrying about us when we weren't dominant in the 
population," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The realities of ethnic geography in the county illustrate the reasons for 
concern in arriving at a just balance of political interests. 
</P>
<P>
In order to create a supervisorial district where a Latino would have a chance 
of victory, a major redrawing of lines would be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Latinos now are split between two districts. One is the 3rd District of 
Democrat Ed Edelman, which extends from the heavily Latino East Los Angeles 
area into the city's Westside. The other is the 1st District of Republican Pete 
Schabarum, which includes the San Gabriel Valley, with its large Latino 
population. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department, in its suit, charged that dividing the Latino 
population between the two districts deprived it of a chance for representation 
on the Board of Supervisors and thus violated the Voting Rights Act. 
</P>
<P>
To meet the suit's requirements, sections would have to be carved out of the 
Schabarum and Edelman districts. And some would come from the 2nd District of 
Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, a white liberal Democrat who has become greatly 
beloved in the black community during his many years on the board. Hahn, 
however, has suffered a stroke and, if he retires, black leaders are hoping to 
elect a black to replace him. 
</P>
<P>
There are Latino enclaves in several parts of Hahn's district and a 
Latino-oriented reapportionment plan could change its boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
And such a change could split the bulk of the Asian population into three 
districts, rather than the two districts now.

KINGS BATTLE BACK, LOSE WAR, 7-6; 
</P>
<P>
OILERS BLOW 5-GOAL LEAD, PULL OUT WIN

<P>
Things were going badly for the Kings Saturday night until their new tough guy 
got beaten up. Jay Miller took it on the chin. Again and again. And on the side 
of the head. Again and again. Then he went to his knees on the ice. 
</P>
<P>
As fellow tough guy Marty McSorley explained: "That was a big sacrifice. For a 
big guy like that to stand in there and take it, to turn his cheek like that -- 
that was a big, big play for our hockey club. We have to be tough. We always 
have to be intelligent about it." 
</P>
<P>
Or, as Miller put it: "Obviously I'm a much better fighter than that, but when 
we're down 5-nothing, I'm not about to put us in a bigger hole with a penalty. 
When I went down, I thought, the fans might not like this now, but they'll 
appreciate it later." 
</P>
<P>
The sellout Forum crowd of 16,005 did appreciate it later, when the fight that 
Miller threw so blatantly resulted in a 5-minute power play that brought the 
Kings to life. 
</P>
<P>
The comeback effort came up short, though. The Kings lost to Edmonton, 7-6. But 
they led the Oilers a merry chase after Miller took his beating, 1:27 into the 
second period. 
</P>
<P>
Bernie Nicholls scored 2 quick goals on the power play, his 49th and 50th of 
the season in his 51st game, tying a club record. And by the end of the period, 
which the Kings dominated, they were within a goal, 6-5. 
</P>
<P>
Miller scored the goal that tied the game, 6-6, in the third period. Yes, Jay 
Miller. The guy acquired from the Boston Bruins just a week ago for his muscle. 
The enforcer. The guy with all the penalty minutes and all the bruises on his 
knuckles. The guy who had 2 goals for the Bruins all season had 2 for the Kings 
Saturday night and now has 3 for the Kings in 1 week. 
</P>
<P>
With 9:05 played in the third period, the unlikely hero slid the tying goal 
under the glove of Oiler goalie Grant Fuhr. 
</P>
<P>
In a fit of honesty, Nicholls said: "To tell you the truth, when it was 6-6, I 
thought we'd end up with a tie. I thought that would be the end of our 
comeback. Grant Fuhr is like that. He'll give up some goals when the game is 
far apart, but when it gets close, he's tough. I didn't think he'd give up 
another goal." 
</P>
<P>
Fuhr didn't, but the Kings did. Craig Simpson got the winning goal for the 
Oilers at 11:53, taking a pass from former King Jimmy Carson in front of the 
goal and deflecting it off the pants of King goalie Glenn Healy and into the 
net. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings are 0-5-1 in their last 6 games, their worst slump of the season. But 
the comeback gave them more than a glimmer of hope. 
</P>
<P>
"If the Kings of the past were down, 5-0, it would be all over, but not now," 
said Nicholls, a King of the past who likes the Kings of the present much 
better. "There's a lot of heart here. We're not quitting. We might have played 
(pretty badly) at the start of this game, but we know we're better than that. 
This team is never quitting." 
</P>
<P>
Healy agreed, saying that the Kings picked up confidence as the game wore on. 
</P>
<P>
"The way we came back showed the pride and the character of this team," he 
said. "We were making a lot of mistakes in the first period, but we had them 
running around in the second and third." 
</P>
<P>
Still, though, they came up short. So far this season, the Kings are 1-3 
against Wayne Gretzky's old teammates, the defending Stanley Cup champions and 
the team the Kings are most likely to meet in the first round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"If we meet them in the playoffs, that's fine," Healy said. "We can beat them." 
</P>
<P>
Edmonton Coach Glen Sather liked the way Esa Tikkanen held Gretzky to just 3 
assists. 
</P>
<P>
"It has always surprised me over the years why more people don't do that to 
Wayne and why more people don't run into him and knock him off the puck," he 
said. "He's a great player, but you can rest assured that there's gonna be a 
lot of people that are gonna be banging into him from now on." 
</P>
<P>
While Gretzky was being knocked around, the likes of Miller and McSorley were 
scoring for the Kings. And not by accident. 
</P>
<P>
McSorley said: "The reason we were scoring is because our goal scorers are 
sacrificing. Forechecking, backchecking, taking the hit. They were sacrificing 
to get us the puck." 
</P>
<P>
After the Kings fell behind, 5-0, the game turned around when Oiler Mike Ware 
got a 5-minute penalty for fighting early in the second period. Ware pummeled 
Miller until the officials intervened. After Ware's 2-minute penalty for 
elbowing and Miller's 2-minute penalty for roughing canceled each other out, 
the Kings had a 5-minute power play. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholls' goals got the Kings started. And Luc Robitaille gave the Kings their 
third power play goal in a row, and their third goal in a span of 3:07, after a 
holding call on Carson. Gretzky had assists on all 3 goals, which cut the 
Oilers' lead to 5-3. 
</P>
<P>
Jari Kurri gave the Oilers their only goal of the second period, skating at 
Healy from the left side to make it 6-3. But former Oiler McSorley struck back 
with a couple of big shots from his defensive position at the top of the right 
circle. His first shot, from just inside the blue line at 13:45, made its way 
through traffic and past Fuhr. His second was deflected in by Miller at 17:41. 
</P>
<P>
In the second period, the Kings outshot the Oilers, 24-6. The Kings, who had 
been outshot in 16 of their last 18 games, had not had 24 shots in a period all 
season. For the game, the Kings had a season-high 47 shots to the Oilers' 32. 
Nicholls took 13 shots, breaking Marcel Dionne's club record, set in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings were outshot, outskated, outplayed, outsmarted and outfought in the 
first period as the Oilers took a 3-0 lead on goals by Dave Hunter, Miroslav 
Frycer and Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of McSorley's double minor for roughing at the end of the first 
period -- after McSorley hooked an arm around the neck of Kevin McClelland and 
tried to dump him over the wall in front of the Oiler bench -- the Oilers had 3 
minutes 55 seconds of power play at the start of the second period. 
</P>
<P>
Carson scored 2 power play goals within 16 seconds against his old teammates, 
at 1:03 and 1:19, to give the Oilers their 5-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
With his second goal Saturday night, Bernie Nicholls tied the club record for 
the fastest 50 goals. Charlie Simmer also had 50 goals in 51 games during the 
1980-81 season. . . . Ken Baumgartner, who had not played for more than three 
weeks as he recovered from pneumonia, lasted a little less than one period 
before being tossed for fighting. . . . New King Steve Kasper missed the game 
because of illness. . . . Dave Taylor and Igor Liba are still out, Taylor with 
an inflamed knee and Liba with a mildly separated shoulder. . . . There are 
still tickets available for Tuesday night's game against Calgary, the leader in 
the Smythe Division.

LENDL REGAINS NO. 1 SPOT; 
</P>
<P>
HE'S BACK ON TOP AFTER BEATING MECIR IN AUSTRALIAN FINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
MELBOURNE, Australia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a blazing hot Sunday afternoon in the dead of summer on the continent Down 
Under, Ivan Lendl climbed back on top of the tennis world once again. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl won his first Australian Open in a devastating display, defeating fellow 
Czech Miloslav Mecir, 6-2, 6-2, 6-2, to reclaim the world's No. 1-ranking from 
Mats Wilander. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't come here to try to be No. 1," Lendl said. "It means a lot to be No. 
1, but winning this title means so much more." 
</P>
<P>
Lendl's seventh Grand Slam title, his first since he beat Wilander in the 1987 
U.S. Open, was marked by his continued domination of Mecir, who has won only 1 
of their 6 encounters. 
</P>
<P>
The 2-hour 1-minute final in the first Grand Slam of the year was worth 
$140,000 to Lendl. 
</P>
<P>
As expected, the match was decided at the baseline and the service line, but 
not at the net, which Lendl and Mecir rarely attacked. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl, an advocate of hard groundstrokes and endurance, had to change his game 
for Mecir by taking some pace off the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not pretty, but it worked against Milos," Lendl said. "As a matter of 
fact, it was downright ugly." 
</P>
<P>
Lendl had 14 aces, but Mecir's serve almost totally abandoned him. He had only 
1 ace, committed 10 double faults and lost 9 service games. 
</P>
<P>
"I just couldn't find the rhythm," Mecir said. "I couldn't hit the ball where I 
wanted to." 
</P>
<P>
Lendl said he did not expect to get so many free points on Mecir's serve. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't seen him serve this bad for a long, long time," Lendl said. "I 
couldn't believe my luck." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, the ease in which Lendl dispatched the world's 13th-ranked player made it 
seem unlikely that Mecir would have won even on a good day. 
</P>
<P>
Down 2 sets and 0-3 in the third, Mecir had one last chance. Lendl broke Mecir 
to 3-2, but he lost his serve again. However, Mecir held 2 break points with 
Lendl serving at 4-2 and was unable to take advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl broke Mecir a final time even though Mecir was fighting to stay in the 
match at 2-5. But Mecir double-faulted to 0-30, saved one match point at 15-40, 
then gave in on the second. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl watched Mecir dump a forehand into the net, then raised both arms in 
triumph. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have to tell you how badly I wanted to win this tournament," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The surface temperature of Center Court was 134 degrees. Both Lendl and Mecir 
wore baseball caps backward with the bills shading their necks from the sun. 
</P>
<P>
Mecir turned his cap around to return serve, but that could not protect him 
from Lendl's heat. 
</P>
<P>
Mecir got an early break when Lendl lost his serve at love in the third game, 
but Lendl broke back quickly to 2-2. On break point, Lendl took some pace off 
the ball and Mecir sent a backhand into the net from the baseline. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl held in the fifth game, aided by back-to-back aces, and forced Mecir into 
another error, a forehand into the tape, at game point. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl went up a break to 4-2 when Mecir served his third and fourth 
double-faults of the set and committed a backhand error at the first break 
point. 
</P>
<P>
The first set went to Lendl, 6-2, when he broke Mecir's serve a third time. 
Mecir fought off one set point, but double-faulted to give Lendl another 
chance. Lendl pinned Mecir in the corner with a forehand and forced him to send 
a crosscourt backhand long on the second set point. 
</P>
<P>
In the early going, Lendl seemed to be able to reach back for a big serve when 
he needed it the most. Down 0-40 in the first game of the second set, Lendl 
served an ace to deuce and held with another ace. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl held again in the third game after losing the first 2 points, but he 
bailed himself out with his serve. Mecir had no such luck. 
</P>
<P>
He went down a break in the fourth game of the second set, double-faulting to 
give Lendl a third break point. Lendl cashed in and went ahead, 3-1, when Mecir 
committed an unforced error from the baseline. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl broke Mecir a fifth time to take a 5-1 lead, the key point coming on 
Lendl's forehand winner off a weak second serve that provided a break point. 
But Mecir broke back at love as Lendl was serving for the set. 
</P>
<P>
Mecir didn't stay in the set for long. Again, his serve deserted him, which 
also seemed to affect the rest of his game. Lendl broke Mecir for the sixth 
time to close out the second set, 6-2. Mecir, who served his seventh 
double-fault, committed 3 consecutive unforced errors to fall into an even 
deeper hole. 
</P>
<P>
Mecir reached the second Grand Slam final of his career in smooth, if not 
spectacular fashion, although he seemed to creep into the semifinals before 
anyone noticed. 
</P>
<P>
Mecir lost only one set in 7 matches, that to Australian Mark Kratzmann, 22, in 
the second round, the same round that Mecir got his biggest break when No. 
1-seeded Wilander was upset by Ramesh Krishnan of India. 
</P>
<P>
With Yannick Noah ousted in the first round and Boris Becker out in the fourth 
round, Mecir's half of the draw quickly became less challenging. To reach the 
final against Lendl, Mecir defeated Thierry Champion, Kratzmann, Jason 
Stoltenberg, Christo Van Rensburg, Goran Ivanisevic and Jan Gunnarsson. None 
were seeded. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl, who had a difficult time beating the heat as well as Thomas Muster in a 
4-set semifinal, seemed to be reaching a peak as the tournament progressed. 
</P>
<P>

Cincinnati Reds owner Marge Schott usually is good for some eyebrow-raising 
remarks, and the Sporting News said she came up with a couple in Washington, 
where she was the guest of honor at a Women in Business luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
Of Barbara Bush, she said, "With her in the White House, we can age gracefully 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Noting several people from the Soviet Union at the luncheon, including 
Ambassador Yuri Dubinin, Schott said: "I can't believe we have both the 
Cincinnati Reds and the Soviet Reds here." 
</P>
<P>
Ugh.

</P>
<P>
Add Kurkjian: Pittsburgh Pirates coach Rich Donnelly told him that new Angel 
Manager Doug Rader has mellowed since his days at Texas, where Donnelly coached 
for him. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he'll be walking home from Kansas City anymore," Donnelly said. 
"One year, he walked from the Royals' ballpark to the hotel, about 12 miles, 
without his shoes. He wanted to punish himself. His feet were bleeding. He told 
me, 'Carry these boots or I'll beat you up.' "

Terry Bradshaw, on his election to the Pro Football Hall of Fame: "Anybody 
who's followed my career, that stuff about being too dumb, can't spell cat,

defenses. Who could? Like my pal George Blanda, I just looked for an open guy 
and threw the ball. And when there was nobody open, I still threw the ball."

<P>
From San Francisco 49ers tackle Bubba Paris, who spent 12 days during the

COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
LSU STUNS GEORGETOWN, 82-80, BEFORE A RECORD 54,321 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The largest, wildest Mardi Gras party in New Orleans Saturday was held in the 
Superdome. 
</P>
<P>
Ricky Blanton scored during a scramble at the buzzer and Louisiana State stung 
second-ranked Georgetown, 82-80, before 54,321 fans, the largest crowd to watch 
a regular-season college basketball game. 
</P>
<P>
"If you took our talent and matched it up against Georgetown's, maybe we 
shouldn't have even shown up for the game," LSU Coach Dale Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
The pregame ticket sale was 65,913, the largest for any college game. The 
actual attendance was second to the turnstile count of 57,607 for the 1987 
Final Four, which was also played at the Superdome. 
</P>
<P>
The loss probably prevented Georgetown (15-2) from moving up to No. 1. Earlier 
this week, Illinois, the current No. 1 team, lost to Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
Georgetown had tied it, 80-80, on a free throw by Charles Smith with 20 seconds 
left. Smith missed his first attempt and made the second. 
</P>
<P>
But LSU (14-5) brought it down against the Hoyas' press, and Chris Jackson 
passed to Russell Grant, who put up an air ball. The ball was loose under the 
basket, and Blanton grabbed it and made a layup as time expired. 
</P>
<P>
LSU's Jackson won a battle of outstanding freshmen, scoring 26 points. 
Georgetown freshman Alonzo Mourning had 9 points and 2 blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Sims had 24 points for LSU, Blanton 14 and Vernel Singleton 11. 
</P>
<P>
Smith led Georgetown in scoring with 32 points. Jaren Jackson, a New Orleans 
native, had 28. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois 75, Indiana 65 -- Kenny Battle scored 22 points and led a second-half 
rally as the No. 1 Illini beat the No. 16 Hoosiers in a Big Ten game at 
Champaign, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana (16-5 overall, 6-1 in conference play) led, 35-25, at halftime, but 
Battle scored 13 points during a 26-9 burst to start the second half. Battle 
put Illinois (18-1, 5-1) ahead to stay, 43-42, with a rebound basket with 13:15 
left in the game, and the Illini made 7 of 8 free throws in the last 4 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Nick Anderson scored 21 points and Lowell Hamilton added 16 for Illinois. Jay 
Edwards led Indiana with 18 points and Joe Hillman had 17. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas State 71, Kansas 70 -- Fred McCoy scored 16 of his 22 points in the 
second half and the Wildcats rallied from a 9-point deficit to beat the 
18th-ranked Jayhawks at Lawrence, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas, 16-4 overall and 3-2 in the Big Eight, was favored to win and become 
only the third college program to win 1,400 games. The loss was the first at 
home for Kansas' first-year coach, Roy Williams. 
</P>
<P>
McCoy, a bulky 6-foot 7-inch senior, scored 5 straight points early in the 
second half to give Kansas State (12-5, 3-2) a 53-45 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Baskets by Kevin Pritchard and Mike Maddox cut it to 4 points, but LaKeith 
Humphrey's 2 free throws and Mark Dobbins' follow-up shot put the Wildcats 
ahead by 8 again. The lead reached 65-55 when Humphrey made 2 free throws and 
then scored on a 12-footer. 
</P>
<P>
Maddox made a 3-point shot to cut Kansas State's lead to 67-62 with 55 seconds 
to play, and Milt Newton's 3-pointer with 18 seconds left made it 69-65. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Henson, who scored 18 points, made 2 free throws with 16 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Scooter Barry made a 3-pointer to bring the Jayhawks to within 3 points. Kansas 
then forced a turnover under its basket, and Barry got a layup at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse 100, Providence 96 -- Sherman Douglas tied a National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. record with 22 assists and Stephen Thompson scored a career-high 
29 points as the 14th-ranked Orangemen beat the 20th-ranked Friars at Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse is 19-0 against Providence since the Big East conference was formed. 
</P>
<P>
Billy Owens scored 19 points for Syracuse, including a 3-point play with 1:02 
left for a 95-91 lead. The Orangemen are 17-4 and 3-4 in conference play. 
Providence is 15-3, 5-3. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas' assists matched the mark shared by Avery Johnson of Southern 
University and Tony Fairly of Baptist. 
</P>
<P>
Mississippi 70, Kentucky 65 -- Gerald Glass scored 24 points as the Rebels 
defeated the Wildcats in Oxford, Miss., for their fourth straight Southeastern 
Conference victory. 
</P>
<P>
Derrick Miller, who had 3 personal fouls in the opening 12 minutes, scored 21 
points and Chris Mills had 16 for Kentucky (10-10, 5-3). 
</P>
<P>
Mississippi (11-6, 5-3) took a 32-22 halftime lead and maintained an advantage 
throughout the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Missouri 89, Nebraska 72 -- Reserves helped a second-half scoring spurt that 
turned a close game into the ninth straight victory for the fifth-ranked Tigers 
in a Big Eight Conference game at Lincoln, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
Missouri led, 56-55, with about 12 minutes left but outscored the Cornhuskers, 
33-11, over the next 11 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Byron Irvin scored 15 of his 22 points in the second half to help Missouri 
(18-3) remain unbeaten in the Big Eight at 4-0. 
</P>
<P>
Missouri shot 69% from the field in the second half after making only 37% of 
its shots in the first half. The Tigers had only two second half turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
Seton Hall 103, Boston College 79 -- John Morton scored 19 of his career-high 
30 points in the first half as the ninth-ranked Pirates made 14 of their first 
18 shots and defeated the Eagles at East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fifth straight loss for Boston College (8-9 overall, 1-6 in the Big 
East) as Seton Hall (18-2, 5-2) came back from Wednesday night's loss to 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
In the first half, Seton Hall made 18 of 26 shots, outrebounded the Eagles, 
25-9, and held a 55-29 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles didn't help themselves, either. They failed to score on their first 
five possessions and made 9 of 28 shots from the field in the first 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Boston College never got closer than 20 points in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina 92, Georgia Tech 85 -- Kevin Madden scored 16 points to lead six 
players in double figures as the seventh-ranked Tar Heels beat the Yellow 
Jackets in an Atlantic Coast Conference game at Chapel Hill, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the fourth straight for North Carolina (18-3, 5-1). Scott 
Williams had 15 points, and J.R. Reid and Pete Chilcutt had 12 each. Jeff Lebo, 
returning to action after sitting out three games because of a sprained ankle, 
had 11 points and Steve Bucknall 10. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Tech's Dennis Scott scored 29 points, including 9 3-point baskets. 
</P>
<P>
Florida State 100, Virginia Tech 97 -- George McCloud scored 30 points and hit 
a 3-point jump shot with 19 seconds to play as the No. 11 Seminoles came from 
behind to defeat the Hokies in a Metro Conference game at Blacksburg, Va. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Tech led, 88-85, after George Caesar's layup with 4:23 to play. But 
Florida State took over as Derrick Mitchell and McCloud made jumpers to take an 
89-88 lead with 3:29 left. 
</P>
<P>
The Hokies, led by Bimbo Coles with 32 points, tied the score three more times 
but never regained the lead. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Dawson had 22 points for the Seminoles (16-1, 4-0). 
</P>
<P>
Wally Lancaster of Virginia Tech was 4 of 15 on 3-point shots and extended his 
NCAA record to 63 consecutive games in which he has made at least 1 3-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan State 73, Minnesota 64 -- Steve Smith and Kirk Manns scored 24 points 
each to lead the Spartans to the Big Ten victory at East Lansing, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Gophers, coming off a 69-62 upset of top-ranked Illinois Thursday, 
controlled the tempo early, disrupting a Michigan State offense that scored 106 
points in a victory over Purdue Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Spartans (12-5, 3-4) were held scoreless for a 5:41 span early as Minnesota 
(11-6, 3-4) took a 10-4 lead. But Manns, who was coming off a 40-point 
performance against Purdue, made a 3-point shot to spark a 15-2 run that gave 
Michigan State a 26-14 lead with 4:29 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
Willie Burton scored 28 points to lead the Golden Gophers. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia 88, Wake Forest 69 -- Richard Morgan scored 25 points and John Crotty 
18 as the Cavaliers (11-6, 3-2) pulled away in the second half to beat the 
Demon Deacons in an ACC game at Charlottesville, Va. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan scored 16 of his points in the second half, including 8 during a crucial 
run for Virginia, which has won four straight. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia took a 37-30 halftime lead. The Cavaliers opened the second half with 
a 16-7 run, ending with Morgan's jumper at 15:13 for a 53-37 Virginia lead. It 
was Morgan's eighth point of the run. 
</P>
<P>
Wake Forest (9-6, 2-6) never threatened after that. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis Williams added a career-high 15 points off the bench for Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman point guard Derrick McQueen led Wake Forest with 18 points. 
</P>
<P>
The game marked the return of Virginia Coach Terry Holland, who underwent 
surgery for intestinal blockage Jan. 2. 
</P>
<P>
California 80, Oregon 62 -- Leonard Taylor scored 18 points and Keith Smith 
added 16 to lead the Golden Bears to a Pacific 10 victory at home, and also 
gave Cal Coach Lou Campanelli his 300th career victory. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan Drew's dunk and Smith's 3-pointer ignited a 9-2 Cal run early in the 
second half to give the Bears a 50-43 advantage, a lead they never 
relinquished. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the half, Cal (14-6, 5-4) turned a 7-point lead into a 19-point 
advantage by holding Oregon to 1 field goal during a 9-minute stretch. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Johnson, who had 12 points in the first half, finished with 14 to lead 
Oregon (7-11, 2-6) in scoring for the fifth straight game. 
</P>
<P>
California's Matt Beeuwsaert scored 12 points and Roy Fisher had 11 to give the 
Bears four players in double figures.

Stacey King scored a career-high 48 points and Mookie Blaylock made a steal 
with 2 seconds left Saturday as No. 4 Oklahoma held off No. 13 Nevada Las 
Vegas, 90-88. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV, trailing 90-86 with 42 seconds left, made 2 free throws to pull within 2, 
and then forced a turnover with 10 seconds to play. But Blaylock intercepted a 
pass by Anderson Hunt to preserve Oklahoma's second victory over Las Vegas this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
King scored Oklahoma's final 7 points and 13 of the last 18 as he surpassed his 
previous high of 40 points in a game last season against Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
"We just couldn't guard King at all," said Jerry Tarkanian, UNLV coach. "He is 
by far the best offensive center in the country. 
</P>
<P>
"King and Blaylock were everything they were supposed to be. Every time I 
thought we were making a run at them, he (Blaylock) came back and made a 
3-pointer." 
</P>
<P>
Blaylock had 23 points for Oklahoma (17-2), which had beaten UNLV, 83-81, in 
November in the semifinals of the Maui tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt led UNLV (14-4) with 22 points, and Stacey Augmon had 17, 15 in the second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
King dominated the game from the outset, scoring 28 points in the first half 
against foul-plagued George Ackles and David Butler, who both fouled out in the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
But Las Vegas, after trailing 51-47 at halftime, took the lead early in the 
second half and expanded it to 72-68 on 3 straight 3-point shots midway through 
the half. 
</P>
<P>
Blaylock made 2 jumpers to tie the score, 72-72, however, and King took over 
from there, scoring all but 5 of remaining points for the Sooners. 
</P>
<P>
King's 2 free throws made it 90-86 with 42 seconds left. Hunt made a free throw 
with 33 seconds left, and UNLV retrieved the ball out of bounds under its 
basket with 27 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
After Barry Young missed a 3-point shot, Augmon was fouled on the rebound and 
made the second of 2 free throws to make it 90-88. Hunt forced Oklahoma's Tony 
Martin to throw away the inbounds pass with 10 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
King scored 17 of Oklahoma's first 25 points as the Sooners ran to a 27-19 lead 
midway through the first half.

TROJANS TRY TO GET LOAD OFF THEIR MINDS 
</P>

<P>
George Raveling, USC basketball coach, used new tactics to prepare the Trojans 
for today's game against Washington State. 
</P>
<P>
Rebounding drills? 
</P>
<P>
No. 
</P>
<P>
Free throw drills? 
</P>
<P>
No. 
</P>
<P>
Would you believe wheelbarrow racing? 
</P>
<P>
In a scene that could have been from a company picnic, the Trojans were divided 
into two squads for wheelbarrow and piggyback races at the start of Friday's 
practice. The losers had to do 25 push-ups. 
</P>
<P>
Although it looked bizarre, there was a method to Raveling's apparent madness. 
He was trying to ease the tension that has mounted during USC's 7-game losing 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
"You need to loosen them up a little bit and let them know it's still fun," 
Raveling said. "I'm trying to get them in the right mind set. They're still a 
little shell-shocked." 
</P>
<P>
When the fun ended, the Trojans got down to business, working on more 
conventional basketball skills. 
</P>
<P>
USC's players appreciated the deviation from their normal routine. 
</P>
<P>
"It broke up the monotony of coming out and doing the same drills every day," 
said guard Rich Grande. "Everyone knows that we're losing but I don't think 
anyone has given up." 
</P>
<P>
USC is 7-11 overall, 0-7 in the Pac-10 and has lost 7 straight games. 
Washington State is 6-11 and 1-7 and has lost its last 6. Kelvin Sampson, 
Washington State's coach, has called today's game a battle for the Pac-10 
cellar. 
</P>
<P>
It's an accurate description. USC is 10th in the Pacific-10 and Washington 
State is ninth. After building a 13-point lead in Thursday night's game against 
UCLA, Washington State lost, 64-63, on Trevor Wilson's last-second tip-in. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson followed his own missed shot, going around Brian Quinnett for the 
rebound, which led to the game-winning shot. 
</P>
<P>
Quinnett, a 6-foot 9-inch forward, is Washington State's top player. After 
sitting out last season with a broken foot, he is averaging 18 points and 6 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Trojan Notes 
</P>
<P>
Today's game is a homecoming for George Raveling, who coached at Washington 
State for 11 years. . . . Center Chris Munk has been playing well in the last 4 
games, averaging 11 points and 9 rebounds in that span, compared to his season 
averages of 7.0 and 6.5.

HATTEN SCORES 37 AS LONG BEACH BEATS UC IRVINE, 75-70 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

John Hatten scored a career-high 37 points and led Cal State Long Beach to a 
75-70 victory over UC Irvine Saturday night in a Big West Conference game 
before 1,900 in the 49ers' gym. 
</P>
<P>
"He should have had more," Coach Joe Harrington said. 
</P>
<P>
Hatten, averaging 14 points per game, missed his first 4 shots and had another 
streak of 3 misses in the first half. In all, the senior center made 17 of 31 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
Hatten, who has been told by Harrington to take over and be more of a scorer, 
said he was overanxious at the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach said to relax," Hatten said. "I knew they were easy shots; it just took 
time for them to drop." 
</P>
<P>
And for a while, it seemed as if they all dropped -- baseline jumpers, 
turn-arounds in the lane, inside banks, lay-ins after grabbing rebounds. By 
halftime Hatten had 23 points and his 20 field goal attempts were only 4 fewer 
than Irvine had. 
</P>
<P>
In the second half, after the Anteaters took a 49-48 lead on 6 straight point 
by Jeff Herdman, the 49ers went on a 12-5 run, Hatten getting 10 of those 
points. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought Hatten had a great game," Irvine Coach Bill Mulligan said. "We tried 
to play him different ways." 
</P>
<P>
But if Hatten was the night's hero, reserve Rudy Harvey was a close second. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't realize Rudy Harvey would get 16 points," Mulligan said. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey did that on 6 of 9 shooting from the field and 4 of 4 from the foul 
line. After stealing the ball, he made a driving dunk to extend the lead to 
62-53. When Irvine pulled to within 62-59, he made a 3-point play. And when his 
two free throws with 4:47 to go increased the lead to 69-61, it looked as if 
Long Beach was home free. 
</P>
<P>
But after a 3-point play by Ricky Butler on a power move over Hatten, another 
inside basket by Butler and a baseline jumper by Kevin Floyd, the 49er lead was 
down to 69-68 with 46 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Eastin made both ends of a one-and-one with 36 seconds left for a 71-68 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
The victory enabled the 49ers (8-10 overall, 5-4 in the Big West) to stay in 
fourth place. Irvine (6-11, 3-5) remains in seventh place and is 1-8 on the 
road.

ANGELS AVERT ARBITRATION BY SIGNING MINTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Angels canceled their opening round of arbitration hearings, scheduled for 
Wednesday with Greg Minton, by signing the 37-year-old relief pitcher to a 
1-year contract worth about $650,000 Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Of the club's four remaining arbitration cases, Minton's figured to be the most 
likely to produce an early agreement, as only $90,000 separated the two sides. 
Minton filed for a $690,000 salary in 1989, and the Angels offered $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Minton appeared in 44 games for the Angels, finishing 4-5 with 7 
saves. His 2.85 earned-run average was second only to Bryan Harvey's 2.13 on 
the Angel pitching staff. 
</P>
<P>
Minton's signing leaves first baseman Wally Joyner, outfielder Chili Davis and 
shortstop Dick Schofield on the club's arbitration ledger. Joyner, who is 
asking for $965,000, turned down a reported $2.24-million, 2-year proposal, 
plus incentives, from the Angels on Friday. The Angels' original arbitration 
offer was $750,000. 
</P>
<P>
Davis and Schofield remain separated from the Angels by $300,000 and $255,000, 
respectively. Davis filed at $1.3 million, the Angels at $1 million. Schofield, 
who filed at $910,000, was offered $655,000. MIKE PENNER

ALYSHEBA RUNS AWAY WITH HORSE-OF-YEAR HONORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ten voters couldn't decide between Alysheba and Personal Ensign and split their 
votes, but for the rest of the electorate, there was no doubt. In results 
announced Saturday at Santa Anita, Alysheba won the 1988 horse-of-the-year 
election by a far greater margin than he won most of his races. 
</P>
<P>
Only 1 of Alysheba's 7 victories last year was by more than three-quarters of a 
length, but in the horse-of-the-year voting, he defeated Personal Ensign, 
179-40, with 1 vote going to Risen Star. 
</P>
<P>
To win horse of the year, a horse must get a majority of the votes from at 
least 2 of the 3 sponsoring groups -- turf writers, track racing secretaries 
and the Daily Racing Form -- and Alysheba convincingly carried all 3. 
</P>
<P>
The vote was 87-27 by the turf writers, 25-4 by the racing secretaries and 67-9 
by the Racing Form. Eight turf writers and 2 racing secretaries split their 
votes between Alysheba and Personal Ensign, and the 1 vote for Risen Star came 
from the Daily Racing Form. 
</P>
<P>
Personal Ensign won all 7 of her races last year, retiring with 13 straight and 
becoming the first major horse to go undefeated in 80 years. 
</P>
<P>
But it was the 4-year-old filly's misfortune to come along in the same year as 
Alysheba, who framed his record with wins in the Strub Stakes and the 
$1-million Santa Anita Handicap early in the year and a victory in the 
$3-million Breeders' Cup Classic in November. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Jack Van Berg tried to talk Alysheba's owners -- Clarence and Dorothy 
Scharbauer and their daughter, Pamela -- into running Alysheba this year as a 
5-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
"I know Jack was disappointed that we retired the horse," Clarence Scharbauer 
said Saturday. "But Alysheba was on top of the world, and we figured that we 
had something to lose and nothing to gain." 
</P>
<P>
Before Alysheba was retired, the Scharbauers nominated him for this year's 
Santa Anita Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had decided to run," Scharbauer said, "they probably would have asked 
the horse to carry 132 pounds, and someone with 110 pounds would have outrun 
us. Then we would have kicked ourselves all over California." 
</P>
<P>
Alysheba will begin his stud career at Will Farish's Lane's End Farm in 
Kentucky next month. His stud fee is $75,000, and Scharbauer said that approval 
has been given for 52 of the 55 mares that he'll be bred to. The Scharbauers 
own 2 of the mares, and they also will do some foal sharing -- taking the 
offspring of a mare in alternate years -- with owners of other mares. 
</P>
<P>
One of the mares to be bred to Alysheba is All Rainbows. When she was mated 
with the stallion Caro in 1984, the result was Winning Colors, who, like 
Alysheba, won the Kentucky Derby.

RACING AT SANTA ANITA; 
</P>
<P>
MISS BRIO'S SURGE CAPS BIG DAY FOR FARISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's nice to have a friend in the White House, as Will Farish does. But the 
election of George Bush is unrelated to the good fortune Farish is enjoying 
these days. 
</P>
<P>
Another election, that of Alysheba as horse of the year, has impacted Farish, 
because the Kentucky horseman will be standing the champion at his 1,800-acre 
Lane's End Farm. That sobriquet preceding a stallion's name greatly increases 
the animal's value as a stud. 
</P>
<P>
At Santa Anita Saturday, several hours after the horse-of-the-year 
announcement, Farish had another cause to celebrate. His 5-year-old mare, Miss 
Brio, justified her favorite's role in the $135,250 Santa Maria Handicap and 
overtook Bayakoa in the last sixteenth of a mile for a three-quarter-length 
victory before 33,211 fans. 
</P>
<P>
Farish, 49, entertained Bush at the 1983 Kentucky Derby and hosts Queen 
Elizabeth II whenever she comes to Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
Should they return, Farish can now introduce them to Alysheba and tell them 
tales of how Miss Brio cleaned up at Santa Anita one winter. The Chilean-bred 
mare has already won 2 stakes at the meeting, and she'll be trying to win the 
$300,000 Santa Margarita Handicap on Feb. 19. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Brio, earning $79,000, ran 1 1/16 miles in 1:41, tying the stakes record 
set by Sangue in 1983. Bayakoa finished 1 1/2 lengths ahead of Annoconnor, who 
frequently runs on the lead but was third all the way around Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Brio, ridden by Eddie Delahoussaye for his fourth stakes win of the 
meeting, paid $4.80, $3.20 and $2.20. Bayakoa paid $5 and $3, and Annoconnor, 
under Chris McCarron, returned $2.40. 
</P>
<P>
Bayakoa broke through the gate just before the start and dumped jockey Laffit 
Pincay. The 5-year-old Argentine-bred was 5-2 at the time, but bettors raced to 
the windows to cancel about $18,000 worth of tickets, and her price jumped to 
4-1. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the incident, Bayakoa shot to the lead and had 2 1/2 lengths on Miss 
Brio after three-quarters of a mile. "She was trying to win," Pincay said. 
"Every time I asked her, she gave it to me." 
</P>
<P>
Neil Drysdale, who trains Miss Brio, also saddled the winner of the race 
preceding the Santa Maria and now has 11 wins from 20 starters at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"Things have just been falling into place," Drysdale said. "You have spells 
like this sometime, but there's no reason for it. Things have just come 
together." 
</P>
<P>
Drysdale was happy to see Delahoussaye sit comfortably behind Bayakoa though 
modest early fractions. 
</P>
<P>
"I was afraid of letting Laffit go, but I didn't want to go with him, either," 
Delahoussaye said. "Bayakoa fought back at the end, too. When Chris moved 
inside with Annoconnor, I moved a little bit, but I waited until we 
straightened out before I really asked her." 
</P>
<P>
Miss Brio carried 119 pounds, 3 fewer than Annoconnor and 1 more than Bayakoa. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Julio Canani, whose Malkhatoun ran second to Neil Drysdale's Lyphka in 
Saturday's seventh race, had better luck out of town. At Turf Paradise, 
Canani's Patchy Groundfog, with Frank Olivares aboard, won the $100,000 Turf 
Paradise Handicap, finishing 1 1/4 lengths ahead of Reincarnate. Kadial was 
third and Mohamed Abdu fourth. At Golden Gate Fields, Canani won an overnight 
handicap with Honest John. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Wayne Lukas' 3-year-old fillies, Bright Asset and Solid Eight, ran 1-2 
in the $50,000 Vallejo at Golden Gate. . . . Lukas has the favorite, On the 
Line, in today's San Pasqual Handicap at Santa Anita. . . . At Gulfstream Park 
Saturday, Dixieland Brass, an 11-1 shot, won the Hutcheson, with Western 
Playboy 6 lengths back and Tricky Creek finishing third, another 4 1/4 lengths 
behind. Winners Laugh, the favorite, ran eighth.

Les Erickson, 43, of Thousand Oaks, died Saturday after suffering a massive 
heart attack while driving his car on the California section of the SCORE 
Parker 400, race spokesman Deke Houlgate said. 
</P>
<P>
Erickson pulled to the side of the road and slowed when he began to feel dizzy, 
members of his team told Houlgate. Erickson then slumped in his seat and his 
foot pressed hard against the accelerator. But passenger Andy Mellinger reached 
over and turned off the ignition, avoiding an accident. 
</P>
<P>
Erickson was airlifted to Parker Community Hospital, where he was declared dead 
about 2 1/2 hours later, Houlgate said.

Danny Letner of Orange broke a long off-road racing drought by winning the 
race.

Letner, 61, averaged 56.63 m.p.h. over the 310-mile course in California and

Larry Roeseler and Danny LaPorte, both of Irvine, riding a Kawasaki on a 
slightly different 300-mile course in Arizona, were the overall motorcycle 
winners.

Defending champion Nancy Lopez shot a bogey-free 69 to overcome a 3-stroke 
deficit and tie Beth Daniel for the lead after three rounds of the Ladies 
Professional Golf Assn. Oldsmobile tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez birdied the 17th hole with a 12-foot putt to pull even with Daniel, who 
shot even-par 72 for a 54-hole total of 7-under-par 209 on the 6,333-yard 
Stonebridge Golf and Country Club course. 
</P>
<P>
A hole in one and 4 birdies helped Dottie Mochrie come from 6 strokes off the 
pace to gain a brief share of the lead. But the second-year pro, looking for 
her first tour victory, bogeyed No. 18 for a 67 to fall a shot behind Lopez and 
Daniel. 
</P>
<P>
Jane Geddes (69) and Jody Rosenthal (71) are next at 211. Lopez, with husband 
Ray Knight standing in for her regular caddy, birdied the first hole to move 
within 2 shots of Daniel. She also birdied No. 8 to take a share of the lead 
Daniel built by shooting 69 and 68 in the first 2 rounds. 
</P>
<P>
Mochrie, who earned $137,293 as a rookie last year, got her hole in one on the 
11th hole with a 3-iron that bounced twice and rolled into the cup 169 yards 
away.

SEMINAR ON '62 MISSILE CRISIS REVEALS THAT U.S. CITIES WERE TARGETED; CASTRO 
PLEA FOR ATTACK TOLD

<P>
The world was even closer to the brink of nuclear war during the Cuban Missile 
Crisis of 1962 than has previously been thought, with warheads already on hand 
in Cuba for Soviet missiles targeted at Washington, New York and other major 
U.S. cities, according to fresh details of the crisis that emerged at an 
unprecedented meeting of the participants here Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
One of the potentially most surprising disclosures emerged during a lunch break 
in the formal sessions. During lunch, one Soviet participant, a man described 
as having "definitive" knowledge of the subject, reportedly said that two days 
before the crisis peaked, Cuban leader Fidel Castro sent a desperate message to 
then-Soviet leader Nikita S. Khrushchev urging that the missiles be fired. 
</P>
<P>
According to this account, that cable convinced Khrushchev that the 
confrontation had gone too far, and he decided to agree to U.S. demands that 
the missiles be withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
The existence of such a cabled plea from Castro could not be confirmed among 
available Soviet and Cuban sources attending the meeting here. But three 
conference delegates confirmed that they had heard the knowledgeable Soviet 
participant give the account during a session break, and they said that the 
report clearly took the American side by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters were barred from all but the opening and closing sessions of the 
extraordinary, two-day seminar, which was organized jointly by the Soviets and 
officials of the Nuclear Crisis Project at Harvard University's Center for

While Washington had photographic proof that there were nuclear-capable Soviet 
missiles deployed in Cuba, the American side was never sure whether nuclear 
warheads to arm them were actually on the island, just 90 miles from the 
nearest landfall in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
But Sergei Khrushchev, son of the late leader and one of the conference 
participants, told foreign journalists Saturday that the missiles could have 
been operational in less than a few hours, if his father had given the word. 
</P>
<P>
Khrushchev, however, quoted Gen. Dmitri A. Volkogonov, head of the Moscow 
Military History Archive Institute, as telling conference participants "that 
even in the tensest moments, there was no command given to put the rockets in a 
state of military readiness, and the warheads were never put on the rockets." 
</P>
<P>
The younger Khrushchev, who was an engineer in the Soviet missile program at 
the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis, added that "even in the event of an 
American invasion or air strike, Soviet officers in Cuba had no orders to use 
the missiles." The missiles were always under full Soviet control, he said, and 
Cuban officials said they were not even permitted onto the missile bases. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the reported cable from Castro urging his father to fire the 
weapons at the United States, Khrushchev commented, "I don't know about this." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1st Meeting of Participants 
</P>
<P>
The Moscow seminar, held at an obscure guest house of a Soviet trade union 
organization, marked the first time that top American, Soviet and Cuban 
officials who were actually involved in the 1962 crisis have met to discuss it. 
Among some 50 participants were former Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara and 
former Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko. 
</P>
<P>
Harvard's Nuclear Crisis Project hopes eventually to publish at least an edited 
version of the meeting transcript, but in the meantime, most participants 
refused to provided details of their talks except anonymously. 
</P>
<P>
Based on discussions with several of them, however, the picture that emerged 
from the conference is one of a vastly more complex confrontation than the 
version commonly known to Americans and one in which even the U.S. participants 
now say Washington played a much more equivocal role. 
</P>
<P>
The best-known phase of the crisis began with the U.S. discovery in mid-October 
of 1962 that the Soviets were building nuclear-missile launching sites in Cuba. 
It became public Oct. 22, when then-President John F. Kennedy announced in a 
national television address that he had imposed a naval blockade on the island 
nation and pledged to do whatever was necessary to compel the withdrawal of the 
missiles. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kennedy warned, a Soviet missile launched from Cuba against any 
nation in the Western Hemisphere would be considered as an attack by Moscow on 
the United States and would trigger full nuclear retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No-Invasion Pledge 
</P>
<P>
The public drama continued for six tense days until, on Oct. 28, Khrushchev 
agreed to remove the missiles in return for a pledge by Washington not to 
invade Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, according to information emerging from the conference here, the Soviet 
decision to install the missiles in Cuba was made at least five months before 
the public crisis began and followed the development of a covert U.S. plan to 
try to overthrow the Castro regime. 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Volkogonov reportedly told the conference Saturday that at the time, the 
Soviet Union had only "about 20" intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of 
reaching the United States from its own territory. That was a "shockingly low 
number," according to one surprised American official, and only a fraction of 
the total estimated at the time by the CIA. 
</P>
<P>
It meant that the 42 intermediate-range Soviet missiles either installed or in 
transit to Cuba by October would have represented more than two-thirds of 
Moscow's ability to deliver a nuclear strike on American territory. The 
warheads had arrived on the island by September, 1962, the Soviets were quoted 
as saying. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets also said that because they had so few missiles at the time, it was 
their nuclear policy to target "U.S. population centers and leadership cadres" 
rather than military installations or troop staging areas, according to one 
participant. The Cuban missiles were targeted at Washington, New York and other 
major cities within their range, he added. 
</P>
<P>
In another surprise, the Cuban delegates to the conference disclosed that 
Havana had urged the Kremlin three times to make a public announcement of its 
intention to install nuclear missiles in Cuba, according to one participant. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy, in his public announcement, stressed that the weapons had been moved 
secretly onto the island, and former Kennedy Administration officials have said 
since that Washington would have been hard-pressed to win world support for 
blocking deployment of the missiles if it had been undertaken openly. 
</P>
<P>
Delegates here confirmed that during the formal sessions, Cuban and Soviet 
officials alike underscored their conviction that by October, 1962, a U.S. 
invasion of Cuba was imminent. Cuban delegates reportedly said that they 
expected 400,000 Cuban soldiers and civilians to die in such an attack. 
</P>
<P>
American officials continue to insist that the United States had no such 
intention, although McNamara conceded Saturday that he had told the seminar, "I 
could understand why the Cuban and Soviet leaders at that time believed the 
U.S. was intending to invade Cuba." 
</P>
<P>
Participants quoted Alexander I. Alekseyev, who was ambassador to Cuba at the 
time, as saying that Castro, who had previously been calm throughout the 
crisis, became particularly agitated by Oct. 26. Fearing a U.S. air strike, he 
reportedly spent that night in a bomb shelter, where he and the Soviet envoy 
drafted a cable to Khrushchev warning of intelligence information that a U.S. 
attack would come within days or possibly hours. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Urged Firing of Missiles 
</P>
<P>
The reported account during lunch by the knowledgeable Soviet delegate picks up 
at that point. The account affirms that Castro urged Khrushchev to fire at 
least some of the missiles targeted on the United States. Luncheon witnesses 
said it was unclear from the Soviet delegate's account whether Castro asked 
that the missiles be launched preemptively or at the moment of a U.S. invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Before the Moscow meeting, the Cubans were generally considered by U.S. 
participants in the 1962 crisis to have been almost extraneous to its 
development. They tended to see the crisis as strictly a Soviet-American 
showdown over an issue of strategic advantage. 
</P>
<P>
The Moscow conference appears to have significantly altered that perception. As 
Scott Armstrong, executive director of the National Security Archive, put it 
during the public, closing session of the conference: "Cuba has been put back 
into the Cuban Missile Crisis in a very definite way here." 
</P>
<P>
Jorge Risket Valdes, a member of the Politburo of Cuba's ruling Communist Party 
and a leader of the Havana delegation here, proposed that a sequel to this 
conference be held in Havana. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel this would be just and make a further contribution to our 
understanding," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The participants have scheduled a final news conference for today.

RED BLUFF, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the moment, Harry Earnest is a veteran millwright at a profitable sawmill. 
Soon, however, he will be an unemployed, 59-year-old man trying to find a way 
to support his invalid wife and a daughter in college. 
</P>
<P>
"This could hurt real bad," he mused, sizing up Louisiana-Pacific's plans to 
mothball its mill south of Red Bluff -- and cut Earnest's job -- this spring. 
"It could take my life savings just to get by." 
</P>
<P>
Other people in other towns face the same future. Sawmills are closing 
throughout the Pacific Northwest, from Snoqualmie, Wash., to Sweet Home, Ore., 
to Klamath, Calif. Hundreds of workers have lost their jobs and thousands more 
are estimated by industry officials to be at risk. 
</P>
<P>
The timber industry is known for frequent booms and busts. But this time 
something is very different. This time the sawmills are closing while the 
industry reaps record harvests and enjoys record sales. 
</P>
<P>
This time, there is doubt about the supply of logs available in the most 
densely forested region on Earth. Foresters warn that a "log gap" looms in the 
Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
This scenario concludes that years of intensive harvesting have virtually 
depleted privately owned "old-growth," or virgin, forests -- centuries-old 
Douglas fir and redwood trees that dominate a unique ecosystem including the 
rare spotted owl and other endangered species. The forests load more organic 
material onto an acre of land than even the densest tropical rain forest. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, trees planted in the 1950s -- replacing old-growth groves 
harvested to supply the postwar suburbanization boom -- will not be big enough 
to harvest for several decades. 
</P>
<P>
This gap is particularly ominous to timber-dependent economies. California, 
which is second only to Oregon in timber production, has 11 counties in which 
the timber industry contributes 10% or more of all jobs. In Sierra County, 40% 
of all jobs are in timber; here in Tehama County, the total is 20%. 
</P>
<P>
Loggers contend that the only way to bridge the log shortage is to cut more 
timber in government-owned national forests. Delays in making those trees 
available is creating the "timber supply crisis" that has closed at least 35 
mills in Oregon, California and Washington in a time of unrivaled abundance. 
</P>
<P>
"What you're seeing now is the start of an attrition caused by this timber 
supply crisis bearing down on us," said Rus Fredsall of the Western Wood 
Products Assn. "There are many facets to this, but it's primarily a matter of 
uncertainty of supply, and it's going to be with us for the next 30 years." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conservationists' Arguments 
</P>
<P>
Conservationists counter that log supplies, which have been hurt as much by 
fires as conservation measures, are but one reason for the mill closures. 
Others include a transition to highly automated mills needing fewer workers, 
industry efforts to weaken unions, lower wages and earlier overharvesting 
practices that should not be employed on publicly owned forests. 
</P>
<P>
"These forests are really living cathedrals," said Patricia Schifferle of the 
Wilderness Society, a conservation group actively working to reduce timber 
sales in national forests, "and you don't tear down cathedrals to make picnic 
tables and remodel kitchens." 
</P>
<P>
In the vortex of this controversy, the U.S. Forest Service is attempting to 
finish drafting specially detailed and comprehensive 50-year management plans 
for 123 national forests, including the 14 significant timber producers in the 
Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
Final plans, which were ordered in the 1976 National Forest Management Act, are 
suffocating beneath an avalanche of administrative appeals by loggers and 
conservationists. When completed, the plans face years of lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Simpler Appeals Process 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to unknot the planning process, the Forest Service this month 
simplified its appeals process. But Sen. Robert Packwood (R-Ore.) has already 
warned that Congress may try to forbid any legal challenge to any Forest 
Service management plan. A similar measure was used last year to stifle 
lawsuits over a national forest timber sale in southern Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
The outcome of this fight could have profound effects on housing prices and 
remodeling costs on the Pacific Coast. Also at stake are thousands more jobs -- 
13,000 in 1989 alone, according to the American Forest Council, an industry 
group -- and the small cities and towns dependent on them. 
</P>
<P>
Hardship is plain to see as lumber and plywood mills shut down, taking with 
them thousands of high-paying jobs from remote, resource-dependent communities 
with few other options. The small communities of Burney and Fall River Mills in 
Shasta County already see local businesses preparing to leave after a nearby 
mill shuts down next month. 
</P>
<P>
"This is going to kill us," said Walter Caldwell, editor of the Mountain Echo 
newspaper and president of the Eastern Shasta County Economic Development 
Corp., which is scrambling to attract new employers to the resource-rich area. 
"The 116 jobs we are going to lose represent 14% of the local work force -- and 
we already have 11% unemployment." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Other Skills 
</P>
<P>
With so many mills being lost at once -- three others in California are 
planning to close in February -- Caldwell said millworkers are unlikely to find 
other work in the industry. Most have no other skills. 
</P>
<P>
Earnest, for example, fears that he is too old to be retrained, and said his 
only other skill is computer maintenance -- a trade not in high demand in rural 
areas and one he has not used since leaving National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration's Jet Propulsion Lab near Pasadena two decades ago, before the 
microchip revolutionized computers. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing about a tree is that when you cut it down another one will grow in 
its place," he said. "Jobs don't necessarily do that." 
</P>
<P>
Old growth has become the focus of the current timber fight for several 
reasons. It is valuable to timber companies because of the trees' huge size, 
which makes logging more efficient, and its unique composition, with a tight 
grain that offers great strength, nice finish and few knots. Conservationists, 
meanwhile, revere the rugged and diverse beauty of standing old growth and are 
growing more fond of its unique ecology. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, old-growth forests were seen as silvicultural deserts where 
trees grew slowly, if at all. However, more recent studies show that virgin 
forests are ecological oases that nurture some animals that do not thrive in 
tree farms. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nurtures Animals 
</P>
<P>
For example, the spotted owl makes its home in standing dead trees, of which 
there are many in old-growth forests. A virgin forest's uneven canopy lets 
sunlight in but keeps snow out, assuring deer and other animals of winter 
forage. Fallen trees and other dead matter recycle soil nutrients, feed both 
new plants and insects, and inhibit erosion. 
</P>
<P>
These features, together with such forests' value as a gene bank for breeding 
seedlings, have forged a consensus in support of old-growth forests. But no one 
can agree on how much of the forests should be saved and where. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, there is not even a standard definition of what constitutes old growth. 
</P>
<P>
For many years, the U.S. Forest Service and other federal agencies have not 
even inventoried old growth as a separate class. 
</P>
<P>
Unsatisfied, the Wilderness Society, a Washington-based conservation group, 
hired foresters to develop a scientific old-growth definition. Besides tree 
sizes, it considers the number of standing and fallen dead trees, variety of 
species, the number of living trees of a certain diameter or age and total 
volume of organic material per acre. 
</P>
<P>
A standard definition is important because foresters, such as Dennis E. 
Teeguarden at the University of California, said it is impossible to manage a 
resource if no one knows how much there is, where it is found or for what it 
can be used. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conflicting Definitions 
</P>
<P>
To illustrate the problem caused by conflicting old-growth definitions, the 
Wilderness Society studied government plans for six national forests in Oregon 
and Washington. The conservation group found that the Forest Service estimates 
that 2.5 million acres of old growth are in those forests, but the society 
contends that only 1.1 million acres -- less than half -- fits its more 
stringent definition. 
</P>
<P>
The Wilderness Society says its estimates paint a bleak picture. It asserts 
that there is only a three-year supply in southern Washington's Gifford Pinchot 
National Forest. Schifferle said current harvest levels may claim all of the 
Pacific Northwest's available old growth -- what is not already in parks or 
wilderness areas -- in 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Morrison, a forest ecologist hired by the Wilderness Society to study 
Forest Service management plans in the Pacific Northwest, asserts that the 
planning process has taken so long that many plans are based on outdated 
information. 
</P>
<P>
"In some cases," Morrison said, "forest plans predict there will be more old 
growth in the coming decades than now exists." 
</P>
<P>
Forest Service spokesman Matt Mathes in San Francisco blamed this disparity in 
old-growth estimates on the lack of a universal definition of the resource. 
After the Forest Service develops its new definition, which he said may or may 
not be stricter than existing standards, it will draft a new inventory. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Management Plans 
</P>
<P>
Until then, he added, management plans will be based on the old estimates. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't just simply shut down timber harvesting," he said. "Congress gives 
us money each year to pump timber into the economy. What we're doing is being 
as conservative as we can with the information we have." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, many thousands of acres of old-growth forests are being preserved in 
parks and designated wilderness areas. The Timber Assn. of California notes 
that there are 3.8 million acres of national-forest wilderness in California 
alone. The Forest Service has estimated that 500,000 wilderness acres in the 
state are old growth. 
</P>
<P>
Conservationists, citing old-growth-dependent animals that they assert are 
being driven to extinction, say old-growth logging should be restrained until 
the resource is properly inventoried. After that, they believe foresters will 
find more old growth needs to be preserved, at a wider variety of elevations 
and in different geographic regions. 
</P>
<P>
"Do we really want to sacrifice our nation's heritage for a few more years of 
cutting -- even if it still means, ultimately, that we'll face the very same 
problems we'd face anyway?" Schifferle said. 
</P>
<P>
Loggers contend that enough is already protected and that more is evolving all 
the time within the area's mature forests. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Industry's Stand 
</P>
<P>
"On a strictly timber-growing basis, industry sees no value in maintaining any 
old-growth stands" beyond those already being preserved, said Gil Murray, vice 
president of the Timber Assn. of California. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Forest Service, buffeted by lawsuits, administrative appeals and 
demonstrations, as well as mixed signals from Congress, is working to sort out 
a compromise, balancing the need for jobs and wood products with a growing 
demand for recreation and the mandate to protect endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
It is not easy. Although more is known about old-growth forests now than in the 
past, many questions persist. No one, for example, knows how many breeding 
pairs of spotted owls are left, where they are or how much old growth they need 
to survive. No one knows how big groves must be to keep distinctive old-growth 
characteristics. No one can say what effect a changing global climate may have 
on these forests. 
</P>
<P>
Without answers to these and other questions, and without solid information on 
how much viable old growth remains, there is pressure to cut less and study 
more. The effort is focused on national forests, but some private landowners -- 
notably the Pacific Lumber Co., which owns large tracts of old-growth redwoods 
in Humboldt County -- are also included. 
</P>
<P>
"It (the old-growth issue) worries me politically, because it has become a 
political pawn," said James R. Craine, another vice president with the Timber 
Assn. of California. "But as a forester, it doesn't bother me. Because I have 
seen elsewhere -- back in northern New York and New England -- where the 
forests have been cut and come back, some for the third or fourth time by now." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the pressure to preserve old growth is intensifying. 
Environmentalists use a federal endangered-species law to block harvests. 
Members of Congress are drafting more preservation legislation. New state laws 
already limit harvests. And, when desperate, protesters have blocked logging 
roads, chained themselves to trees, sabotaged heavy equipment -- even 
booby-trapped trees. 
</P>
<P>
Pinched between hardball politicking and bottom-line economics, more than a few 
timber workers, such as sawmill electrician Forest Finck in Red Bluff, are 
seriously reassessing their futures. 
</P>
<P>
"My brother told me 20 years ago to get out of the timber business because he 
said there was no future in it," said Finck, 59, and the father of two 
preteens. "It looks like he was right." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LOSING PRIME FOREST LAND 
</P>
<P>
The Mattole River watershed in south Humboldt County is a case-study in the 
loss of prime forest land in California. These maps plot the "old-growth" 
forest areas from 1947 and from 1987; shaded areas reflect old growth. The open 
areas today are not barren; rather they are planted with "second-growth" 
vegetation. Environmentalists consider second growth inferior: it lacks the 
variety in species, is subject to pest problems and cannot support the full 
range of forest animals.

TALKS TO OPEN 'NEW CHAPTER,' WALESA ASSERTS

<TEXT>
<P>
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa spoke Saturday of opening "a new chapter in 
Polish internal relations" in the coming talks with the government, and said 
that "dismantling the monopoly" of power by the Communist Party and the 
official union organization could ease the country's crisis. 
</P>
<P>
But he warned that there would be "no immediate relief" for Poland's deep 
economic difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
The date for the first of a series of "round-table" discussions between 
Solidarity and the government was set for Feb. 6 in a meeting Friday between 
the banned union's leadership and government representatives. 
</P>
<P>
An ebullient Walesa, at a news conference Saturday, said he is satisfied with 
the Communist Party's declaration that it will consider lifting the seven-year 
ban on the union and that "conditions" imposed by the government are no barrier 
to going forward with the often-stalled talks. 
</P>
<P>
The government agreed to the talks on condition that, among other things, 
Solidarity refrain from undertaking strikes, not disturb the "constitutional 
order" and stop accepting funds from foreign sources. 
</P>
<P>
"The precise and detailed issues of what Solidarity will look like will have to 
be discussed at the round table," Walesa said. "Our goal for now was to win 
this possibility, and we have achieved this. We gained maximum results on this 
goal we set for ourselves, and the rest is to come." 
</P>
<P>
Walesa made it clear that, underlying the issue of the union, the primary goal 
of the talks would be "dismantling the monopoly" of Communist power in Poland. 
In his frequent use of the phrase, Walesa seemed to underscore a perception, 
cautiously held by many Solidarity sympathizers, that the beginning of a 
fundamental change may be under way in Poland. 
</P>
<P>
Flanked by aides and advisers, Walesa came late to the news conference, 
delayed, he said, because he had been giving an interview to representatives of 
a Soviet magazine. It was another indication of change stirring in the Soviet 
Bloc, for, as Walesa noted, such an interview would been unthinkable nine years 
ago when the union was born. 
</P>
<P>
The setting -- a university lecture hall -- was also unusual, as Solidarity 
activities and press conferences have generally been confined to property of 
the Roman Catholic Church in the years since the union was outlawed. Walesa 
said the union intends to hold frequent meetings with the press to discuss 
progress of the talks. 
</P>
<P>
"We have said there is a crisis in the country," Walesa said, "and this is 
caused by the existing monopoly of the party and of the (official) union, 
economic monopoly and many different others. Now that we have determined it is 
the monopoly that caused all of this, we will have to attempt to dismantle the 
monopoly. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We also have to point out that in economic issues there will be no immediate 
relief," he said, adding that "there are very difficult days ahead of us. We 
are all afraid of the days that are coming before us." The eventual solution, 
he said, rests in a system based on pluralism, which, he said, had "passed the 
test in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Walesa acknowledged that there will probably be strikes in coming months as 
workers push for higher wages and protest rapidly rising inflation. 
</P>
<P>
"The situation in the country is terribly difficult," he said. "I have said 
many times that every Pole is justified to protest and say I have had enough of 
this. . . . We, as activists, have to search for solutions. . . . We're going 
to try to seek the just sharing of what little we have . . . but we cannot say 
there will be no problems and no demands." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about rising militancy among young workers, Walesa said he could only 
sympathize with them. 
</P>
<P>
"I have nothing to propose to the young, (who) have to wait 40 years for an 
apartment," he said. "I can only express regret and sorrow. I can appeal to 
patriotism, but I don't have anything positive to say. I am not in the 
government. This is my tragedy and this is our tragedy. But I believe in the 
wisdom and common sense of the Poles because we have shown this wisdom in all 
the most difficult situations." 
</P>
<P>
Walesa said that he does not necessarily trust the authorities, either in 1980 
or today, but that he sees "facts that could produce a solution." 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that we are dismantling the monopoly, this makes me think that our 
chances are great. How far will this monopoly go in defending itself is another 
matter," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Solidarity does not want to be a political party, but "a good trade 
union. In the condition we have now, we cannot be a good trade union . . . but 
it must fight to create the possibilities that this could happen." 
</P>
<P>
Solidarity sources say the round-table discussions will be broken up into broad 
areas -- trade union affairs, social and economic issues and politics. Working 
groups in each category will break down the subjects further. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to coming up with a timetable for making the union legal again and 
setting down guidelines on the right to strike, groups will be assigned to draw 
up an "anti-crisis pact" aimed at winning social support from various 
opposition and pressure groups. Other groups will take up devising a new 
election law, which could result in a new opposition minority in the national 
Parliament, and reform of the legal system and the mass media. 
</P>
<P>
Bronislaw Geremek, a key Walesa adviser, said Saturday that both sides in 
preliminary discussions between Solidarity and the government agreed that "the 
situation in the country is drastic" and that "lack of reform would threaten 
the country with ultimate consequences." 
</P>
<P>
"There is a conviction on both sides," Geremek said, "that this reform should 
be implemented by the society -- this is, with the participation of society -- 
and that dialogue with Solidarity is a starting point for this process."

BUSH DEFENDS LAWMAKERS' PAY RAISE; 
</P>
<P>
CALLS SALARY HIKE 'OVERDUE' IN SURPRISE NEWS CONFERENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush defended a widely criticized pay raise for Congress on Friday as 
unquestionably "overdue." Making his debut in a fast-paced but easygoing news 
conference, Bush also said that "prudence is the order of the day" in dealing 
with the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Rounding out the first week of his presidency, Bush put himself at arms length 
from a controversial Treasury Department plan to rescue the beleaguered savings 
and loan industry by imposing a fee on savings accounts. He called it "an 
option, not a proposal." 
</P>
<P>
As for his promise not to raise taxes, Bush said, "I'd like it to be a 
four-year pledge." Asked if Ronald Reagan was cashing in on the presidency by 
signing a reported $5-million book deal and getting paid more than $40,000 for 
speeches, Bush said, "There is plenty of tradition that goes with presidents 
writing memoirs and being paid for it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
43-Minute Conference 
</P>
<P>
His voice was hoarse from a cold but Bush seemed confident, relaxed and in high 
spirits as he fielded questions in the White House briefing room for 43 minutes 
-- a contrast to the 30-minute time limit fixed for Reagan's infrequent news 
conferences. 
</P>
<P>
Whereas Reagan held most of his news conferences in prime-time hours of 
television, Bush surprised the press with a hurriedly announced session that 
began at 8:02 a.m. PST. It was broadcast live nationally. White House aides 
said Bush decided on the spur of the moment Friday morning to see reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting on a week marred by policy and personnel flaps, Bush said, "I'm just 
getting a preview of coming attractions, and it's been lovely. And it's going 
to change, I know, but no, I think it's been a wonderfully harmonious week and 
these are just little ripples on the surface of an otherwise calm pond." 
</P>
<P>
Several times Bush was asked about the 50% pay raise to take effect Feb. 8 that 
would bring salaries for members of Congress to $135,000 a year. Polls show 
that an overwhelming majority of Americans oppose the increase. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Congressional Vote Unlikely 
</P>
<P>
Taking the opposite side, Bush said, "A raise is overdue, there's no question 
about that." Although saying there are some unspecified aspects of the pay 
formula that disturb him, Bush said, "I still feel that I should not go about 
undoing the Reagan decision" to endorse the pay increase. 
</P>
<P>
Ideally, he said, the Senate and House would vote on the issue, although that 
appears highly unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
On foreign policy, Bush said he was not trying to send any kind of signal by 
visiting China next month ahead of any meeting with Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev. He said the stop in Beijing "just seemed like an appropriate visit" 
since he would be in Asia for the funeral in Tokyo of Emperor Hirohito. 
</P>
<P>
Bush announced that he will make a "relatively brief" stop in South Korea -- 
probably several hours -- on Feb. 26 on the way home from China. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said the Administration was reassessing all aspects of U.S.-Soviet 
relations and "let's take our time now. . . . I don't think the Soviets see 
that as foot-dragging. I'm confident they don't." Bush said he made that point 
clear last week in a telephone call with the Soviet leader. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Avoids the Words 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he believed there still is a "Cold War" between Moscow and Washington 
-- as White House national security adviser Brent Scowcroft said recently -- 
Bush said he wanted to avoid those words because of their implication. 
</P>
<P>
"If someone says 'Cold War' to me, that doesn't properly give credit to the 
advances that have taken place in this relationship," the President said. "So I 
wouldn't use that term. But if it's used in the context of, are we still unsure 
of -- in our predictions on Soviet intentions -- I'd have to say, yes, we 
should be cautious." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Scowcroft's words had merely echoed a sentiment expressed by Bush 
in a speech last June 29, when he declared: "The Cold War is not over." 
</P>
<P>
In his news conference, Bush said he wanted to take the offense on foreign 
policy rather than merely react to moves by the Soviets. "We're going to be out 
front. . . . I don't want to play defense . . . just waiting around to, you 
know, let others set the agenda. But prudence is the order of the day." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Iran's Influence 
</P>
<P>
On other points, Bush: 
</P>
<P>
* Said he believes Iran "can have an influence" in winning the release of the 
American hostages in Lebanon even though it does not actually hold them. On a 
conciliatory note, Bush said, "There was a period of time when we had excellent 
relations with Iran, and I don't want to think that the status quo has to go on 
forever." 
</P>
<P>
* Offered his first reaction to a Supreme Court decision that sharply 
restricted the ability of state and local governments to reserve a fixed 
percentage of contracts for minority businesses without proof of past 
discrimination. Bush said, "I will not read into that a mandate to me to stop 
trying on equal employment and on affirmative action generally," he said. 
</P>
<P>
* Defended his decision not to make former Education Secretary William Bennett 
a full member of the Cabinet even though he has Cabinet-level rank as point man 
in the battle against drugs. Bush said that he wanted to reduce the size of the 
Cabinet and that Bennett's time "is best spent not worrying about agricultural 
subsidies." Bush said he would insist that every member of the Cabinet 
cooperate with Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
* Said that Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan "is more concerned about 
inflationary pressures than I am right now" and said that was "an area of 
difference" between them.

GOVERNOR BID MAY LEAVE DEMOCRATS BROKE AND BLOODY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BALZAR, Times Political Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first breezes of the 1990s are at their backs. History is calling their 
number. California Democrats haven't been this well-positioned for years to 
compete for the governorship. 
</P>
<P>
But, wouldn't you know, they are tossing in their sleep these winter nights. 
</P>
<P>
The worry: Their opportunity to seize the governor's office next year is so 
compelling that the ablest Democrats will empty the bench for a nasty, 
mud-slinging primary election scuffle. Weakened, divided and flat broke, 
Democrats fear they will send the survivor limping into the general election to 
lose against a massively financed and unscarred Republican -- say, an 
entrenched Republican like Sen. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Worry for Van de Kamp 
</P>
<P>
Nobody stews more about this than Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, the 
Democratic Establishment front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
For going on two years, Van de Kamp has labored to create an image of 
invincibility and scare off Democratic challengers. 
</P>
<P>
He has tried to prove that no other Democrat can raise as much money, has such 
a high office, such a familiar name or such a registry of influential 
supporters. Nobody else is a liberal, a manager and a crime fighter. Nobody has 
such a vast and experienced political operation. 
</P>
<P>
These days leading up to the state Democratic party convention in Sacramento 
Feb. 10 will be important in measuring how successful Van de Kamp has been. 
</P>
<P>
As the 52-year-old attorney general stands by, a threesome of potentially 
powerful Democratic opponents now test the waters and their own mettle to see 
which of them -- maybe none, maybe all -- will give chase. 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California, Gray Davis, the state controller, former assemblyman 
and former chief of staff to ex-Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., has set a 
mid-February deadline for deciding whether to mount an all-out candidacy. 
Already, though, he shows himself willing to mix it up with Van de Kamp. 
</P>
<P>
In Northern California, former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein continues 
methodically moving as if she is a candidate -- most recently hiring an old and 
trusted political associate on a long-term contract to manage her fortunes. Her 
decision is forthcoming "the sooner the better," according to an adviser. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sets Deadline 
</P>
<P>
And Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy, a fellow San Franciscan, burns with ambition and 
the desire to come back from his painful 1988 defeat as the Democratic nominee 
for the U.S. Senate. He just established a mid-February deadline for making up 
his mind whether to seek reelection or try for the governor's office. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't bet on John clearing out the field," says Mickey Kantor, a Los 
Angeles attorney and an important Van de Kamp backer. "We're an entrepreneurial 
party. We're a bunch of small businesses, each with its own constituency." 
</P>
<P>
If the three plunge in with Van de Kamp, it will be the wildest Democratic 
gubernatorial primary in 15 years. That goes back to 1974 when Jerry Brown won 
the nomination against a strong field and then went on to win the governorship. 
</P>
<P>
But in those days, there was no restriction on fund-raising. A candidate could 
emerge from a tough primary and count on wealthy supporters to produce large 
sums quickly for the June-to-November general election campaign. This time, 
candidates are under new voter-mandated limits -- $1,000 in contributions per 
donor each fiscal year leading up to the election. Emerging from a costly 
primary with the ability to wage a strong finale will be vastly more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
These June, 1988, ballot proposition "reforms," in fact, are the reason for so 
much political activity this early. The general election won't be held until 
November, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"Money is going to be in short supply for everyone," explains Van de Kamp. "We 
cannot be bloodied (in a primary). We must be unified." 
</P>
<P>
History offers one other benchmark as the 1990 campaign begins. Going back for 
35 years, independent-minded California voters alternated the governor's office 
every two terms between the Democrats and the Republicans. By this reckoning, 
the next governor should be a Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
Trying to keep this streak going into the 1990s, Democrats are testing not only 
each other right now but also some fresh themes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Similar Themes 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Van de Kamp and Davis, who are farthest along in this endeavor, have 
independently given voice what might be called cautious, middle-class populism. 
</P>
<P>
Says Van de Kamp: "My campaign is going to be about returning government to the 
people, for a change. Basically, state government has become quiescent -- 
responsive to special interests and big business, some big business." 
</P>
<P>
Says Davis: "I want to speak out for those many hard-working Californians who 
can't hire a lobbyist to speak for themselves. There are lots of people whose 
interests are not taken into account in Sacramento." 
</P>
<P>
To sell his message, Van de Kamp is assembling one of the most powerful teams 
of political experts in the history of the state. Robert Shrum and David Doak, 
two Washington consultants on strategy and advertising, are among the hottest 
hired guns in the business. Van de Kamp signed them after the pair flirted 
briefly with Feinstein. Pollster Paul Maslin is another hired hand of national 
standing. And Van de Kamp adds to that a home-grown operation under Barbara 
Johnson, his longtime adviser. 
</P>
<P>
As attorney general and before that as Los Angeles County district attorney, 
Van de Kamp's natural strength is his law enforcement record. A couple of 
controversial cases and decisions are likely to be debated down the road. But, 
in general, Van de Kamp is regarded as a more substantial law-and-order man 
than Democrats have been able to field in many years. 
</P>
<P>
After a quiet beginning as attorney general in 1982, Van de Kamp in the last 
couple of years has become more energetic as an environmental and consumer 
advocate. He opposed the mergers of Los Angeles grocery chains and fought 
offshore oil drilling. He battled credit card interest rate increases. His 
press releases tout court appeals on behalf of civil rights cases, 
investigations of telemarketing fraud and support for legislation expanding 
financial liability for polluters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Now Backs Nader Initiative 
</P>
<P>
In the 1988 struggle over automobile insurance initiatives, Van de Kamp backed 
an unsuccessful package pushed by lawyers. But since then, he has 
enthusiastically advanced the legal case for Proposition 103, the successful 
Ralph Nader-backed initiative that calls for a 20% insurance rate rollback. 
</P>
<P>
"He's ideal. He may move a little slower than some people would like. But when 
he does move he has tremendous credibility," said Harry Snyder, West Coast 
director of Consumers Union. "He moves deliberately, with lots of data. He 
doesn't demagogue. And there's no stopping him." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Democrats of past campaigns, Van de Kamp is determined not to straddle 
the fence between business interests and other constituencies, even if it stirs 
open hostility in the business community. And it may. 
</P>
<P>
"John moves very comfortably with a lot of business leaders, but there are 
several issues where he has taken some positions that have caused some fairly 
deep unhappiness," said Ray Remy, president of the Los Angeles Area Chamber of 
Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Against that, Davis potentially brings a political drive and relentlessness of 
breathtaking dimension. It is both his asset and his burden. An opportunist, 
his detractors call him. Flexible, say his supporters. 
</P>
<P>
"Gray is basically an activist -- he looks at politics in its splashiest form. 
It's exciting. There are a million things on the political menu. He has an 
ability to find those that people care about," says Bob Hattoy, Southern 
California director of the Sierra Club. 
</P>
<P>
"Gray is not afraid to be a little out in front. Most politicians are more 
comfortable back in the pack." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Eager for Battle 
</P>
<P>
Davis argues, naturally enough, that primary election competition is not all 
bad for the Democrats. And even at this early date, he shows willingness -- if 
not downright eagerness -- to mix it up freely with any comer. 
</P>
<P>
"One of my concerns is that people are too quick to ally themselves with 
special interests," he said in an interview. His target: Van de Kamp and the 
trial lawyers alliance in the 1988 automobile insurance battle. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, alone among statewide officeholders, threw his support behind the 
successful Nader-sponsored proposition in the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"The trial lawyers and insurance companies are in the top five campaign 
contributors in this state," Davis says. "I stood with Ralph Nader because I 
believed it was the best bargain." 
</P>
<P>
Likewise Davis credits himself with action when Van de Kamp stood on the 
sidelines in the fight against oil drilling on the Pacific Palisades seashore. 
</P>
<P>
"I gave $900,000 to that campaign. I don't just talk a good game, I'm a doer," 
Davis said. For his transfer of money from his own treasury, Davis was featured 
in a television advertising blitz which attacked the oil-drilling plan. 
</P>
<P>
Who among the Democrats enters the race -- and who stays in -- has come to 
hinge, in part, on political developments in the Republican field and on the 
uncertainly about forthcoming public opinion polls. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, when two-term incumbent Gov. George Deukmejian announced he 
wouldn't seek a third term, Democrats were overjoyed. They thought the 
remaining field of GOP contenders was a pushover. "A Democrat was just elected 
governor!" gushed Democrat Conway Collis, a member of the state Board of 
Equalization. That whet the ambitions of anyone who ever looked in the mirror 
and saw a governor. 
</P>
<P>
In the sober days since then, Democrats awakened to the fact that two of the 
GOP contenders might not be such pushovers after all. Commissioner of Baseball 
Peter V. Ueberroth, a Republican celebrity with a can-do reputation, sent out 
teasing signals that he might consider running if things looked good in a 
couple of months. And then, Pete Wilson told friends he has decided to return 
from Washington and run. He is the biggest GOP vote-getter of recent years and 
the man who clobbered McCarthy in the Senate election last November. 
</P>
<P>
Long-shot Democrats suddenly are gripped by second thoughts. How would they 
fare against a strong GOP contender like Wilson? Would a brutal Democratic 
primary fight be worth the trouble? Feinstein, for instance, had previously 
shown a reluctance to take on Wilson, a man who had openly assisted her while 
she was mayor of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, I'm very fond of Pete Wilson," Feinstein says. "But I don't think 
he has a monopoly on this. He chose to run for the Senate. I would hope he 
would stay there." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Signal of Intent 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein adds she is "very, very serious" about running for governor. She 
raided City Hall, hiring her friend, Deputy Mayor Hadley Roff, on a two-year 
contract as chief of staff. Roff is a rough-hewn politician, and his reunion 
with Feinstein is widely considered the most important signal yet of her 
seriousness to proceed as a candidate. Feinstein said she had no timetable for 
making a final decision. But she promised she will produce "a program of new 
solutions" for some of the state's old problems if she stays in the race. 
</P>
<P>
There is also the matter of upcoming public opinion polls on the Democratic 
field. 
</P>
<P>
No major pollster has yet plumbed public feeling about this faraway race. When 
the first polls surface, what if Van de Kamp, the favorite of political 
insiders, shows up No. 2 or 3? Experts believe this is a good possibility, 
depending on how soon such a poll is taken. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're trying to show you are invincible and you don't come in first, it 
strains your credibility," says Kam Kuwata, a California political consultant 
who is advising Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Some experts, like Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, believe that by virtue of 
name recognition from the 1988 campaign McCarthy would emerge at the top of 
such a poll. Moreover, Brown says McCarthy could probably "have the nomination 
for the asking." But Brown, like many associates close to McCarthy, ultimately 
thinks he will choose to run for reelection as lieutenant governor. 
</P>
<P>
"He has not eliminated it as an option. But the notion of turning around and 
raising millions of dollars after just going through the fund-raising mill is 
an enormous disincentive for him, I have to say," a McCarthy adviser said. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Stephen Hopcraft, however, expressed McCarthy's situation this way: 
"Certainly he has ambitions greater than his current office. And we all feel he 
has talents greater than his current office. . . . I think he sees this as a 
time to make some serious decisions."

ERRORS MAR TENURE OF REFORM-MINDED RIVERSIDE CORONER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

RIVERSIDE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ray Carrillo vowed to restore respect and harmony when he was elected two years 
ago to head what was widely considered a badly managed coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
But midway through his four-year term, the Riverside County coroner presides 
over an office that some say suffers from mismanagement, poor working 
conditions, and badly trained investigators. There have been sensational cases 
and blunders, including the handling of Liberace's death and the mistaken 
cremation of a possible homicide victim. 
</P>
<P>
A grand jury investigation is underway to examine these and other allegations 
that have arisen during Carrillo's brief tenure. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not worried about it (the investigation). I've done nothing wrong," said 
Carrillo, 59, who has been touted as a role model for the Latino community in 
the county. "I haven't acted out of my range of control." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Trial by Fire' 
</P>
<P>
Still, Carrillo, a heavy-set man with graying hair and beard who was a deputy 
coroner for 17 years, acknowledges that his time as county coroner has "been a 
trial by fire. Unfortunately, at this particular time, we are the laughing 
stock of the county because of mistakes that have been made." 
</P>
<P>
But Carrillo also has strong support, particularly from Latinos in his hometown 
of Indio and other cities in the Coachella Desert east of here. They say 
Carrillo is a genial and respected community leader who needs more time to turn 
the coroner's office around. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the coroner's office -- which handles more than 4,200 cases a year with 
a $2.3-million budget that has not increased significantly over the last five 
years -- overworked and fatigued employees complain of a lack of leadership and 
morale problems so severe that mistakes are all but inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is spending most of their time trying to cover their rear ends 
instead of devoting it to the job at hand," said one deputy coroner who asked 
to remain anonymous for fear of retribution. "On a scale of 1 to 10, morale is 
about sub-4." 
</P>
<P>
Outside the office, county prosecutors have complained that autopsy reports are 
often late, and Sheriff's Department homicide investigators have begun to keep 
an eye on the work of deputy coroners at crime scenes. 
</P>
<P>
"The fear is that some piece of evidence could become tainted, damaged or 
lost," said Sgt. Dan Borden. "I'm paying close attention to what their people 
are doing at crime scenes now. I've told my investigators to watch what's going 
on." 
</P>
<P>
And some local funeral home directors say they have lost confidence in 
Carrillo's ability to administer his office in a professional manner. 
</P>
<P>
"Cripes, I've never seen such an uproar or discontent in an office before," 
said Ed Campbell, owner of the Preston and Simons Mortuary here since 1958. 
"It's just an unorganized organization." 
</P>
<P>
Now, Carrillo must prove to county administrators, staff members and the nearly 
1 million residents of the county that he can make good on his campaign vow. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Looking for a Comeback 
</P>
<P>
"I have to throw a 93-yard touchdown," said Carrillo, who earns $60,000 a year 
in the post and came to the job without previous experience as a government 
administrator. 
</P>
<P>
Forensic pathologists and medical examiners say mistakes can be expected in an 
office run by a lay coroner without previous experience as an administrator or 
formal training in forensic pathology. 
</P>
<P>
"While a lay coroner can work effectively, in general, I think that (elected) 
coroners are terrible, terrible systems," said Charles Wetli, a physician and 
deputy chief medical examiner for the Dade County Medical Examiner's Office in 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
"An elected coroner can be anybody without formal training," added Wetli, past 
president of the Forensic Council of the American Society of Clinical 
Pathologists. "And (coroner's offices) are usually under funded, which means 
they will be too selective about which cases should be autopsied. Murders may 
be missed as a result, and important evidence may be lost." 
</P>
<P>
A recent survey by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services showed that 
23 states have medical examiners who are physicians, 12 states have coroners, 
and 16 states, including California, have both coroners and medical examiners. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Statewide Pattern 
</P>
<P>
In California, only four of the 58 counties -- Los Angeles, San Francisco, 
Santa Clara and Ventura -- have medical examiners. The remaining counties have 
sheriffs as coroners or appointed or elected coroners such as Carrillo, reports 
the California Coroners Assn. in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Carrillo, who plans to run for a second term, has pointed an accusing finger at 
middle management staffers he said he "inherited from the previous 
administration." 
</P>
<P>
Such accusations have upset union officials charged with protecting the rights 
of county employees, including the 30 who work in the coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think an attempt has been made to establish a rapport between the 
coroner and management," said Clayton L. Neff, spokesman for the Public 
Employees Assn. of Riverside County. "And that has created a gulf that is up to 
him to correct." 
</P>
<P>
In Indio, Carrillo co-owns a Mexican restaurant operated by his wife, Lupe. He 
was reared in the area, where his late father, Joseph, served in the 1950s as 
the first Latino sheriff's deputy in Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
Carrillo, a high school dropout who returned to school in 1972, earned a high 
school diploma and then an Associates of Arts degree in law enforcement from 
the College of the Desert in Palm Desert. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Latino Appeal 
</P>
<P>
In November, a group of 40 mostly Latino residents appeared before the 
Riverside County Board of Supervisors to defend the man they believe has beaten 
the odds in a county that has seen only a handful of Latinos elected to public 
office. 
</P>
<P>
One of those who attended the board meeting was Robert Nava, director of 
Chicano Student Programs at UC Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
"We are saying give the man a chance. . . . This is only his second year in 
office and he inherited an office in disarray," Nava said. "He's a role model 
for high school and college students . . . (and) a proven county official." 
</P>
<P>
Jim O'Brien, president of the California Coroners Assn., said Carrillo's 
troubles are directly related to the unusual cases that have cropped up under 
his reign. 
</P>
<P>
"Liberace, the frozen head -- that would be a nightmare," O'Brien said. "Some 
counties have airplanes crash land in them. His county gets these kinds of 
things." 
</P>
<P>
Just before Carrillo was elected coroner, former chief deputy coroner Carl 
Smith was sentenced to five years probation and fined $8,500 when he pleaded 
guilty to one felony count of perjury and one misdemeanor count of obstruction 
of justice connected with a district attorney's investigation into alleged 
misconduct in office. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Grand Jury Testimony 
</P>
<P>
The charges against Smith resulted from his and others' testimony in grand jury 
hearings "showing a scheme to cover up the deceptive and illegal falsification 
of job applications," a spokesman for the district attorney's office said at 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
In February, 1987, four months after his election, Carrillo was in the national 
spotlight when he announced that he had rejected Liberace's death certificate 
and ordered his body returned from Los Angeles for an autopsy to determine 
whether he died from AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Liberace's personal physician, Dr. Ronald Daniels, initially gave as the cause 
of death heart failure brought on by subacute encephalopathy, a general term 
for degenerative brain disease. 
</P>
<P>
The entertainer's fans and relatives were angry that the inquiry was being 
conducted, and chastised Carrillo for publicizing the fact that Liberace 
possibly died of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Although Carrillo was praised by county officials for following coroner's 
procedures to the letter, some coroner's investigators said they were 
embarrassed by Carrillo's defensive, combative stance in front of the news 
media. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Center of the News 
</P>
<P>
Carrillo recalled that he was under tremendous pressure to explain his position 
publicly. "We had 2,000 calls here from reporters around the world," Carrillo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Less than a year later, Carrillo's office made headlines again. In early 
January, 1988, it began to investigate the death of 83-year-old Dora Kent, 
whose head had been surgically removed and then frozen at a Riverside cryonics 
laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
The Alcor Life Extension Foundation stores frozen heads and bodies in the hope 
that in the future they can be revived and new bodies cloned for them. Most 
scientists dismiss cryonics as fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
Unable to find Kent's head, the coroner's office demanded that Alcor turn it 
over so an autopsy could be completed to determine whether the woman was 
murdered. Alcor members, including Mrs. Kent's son, Saul Kent, 49, a co-founder 
of Alcor, refused, saying an autopsy would eliminate any possibility of the 
head being brought back to life. 
</P>
<P>
The standoff became a public spectacle with Carrillo and Alcor members 
defending their positions at successive news conferences. The fighting ended 
when a Riverside County Superior Court judge barred Carrillo from thawing any 
of the six heads and single body preserved at the cryonics laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Charges and Denial 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the coroner's office ruled Kent's death a homicide caused by 
barbiturates and prosecutors are investigating. So far, no charges have been 
filed. Alcor members deny the woman was murdered. 
</P>
<P>
In July, Carrillo angered union officials when he suspended two employees -- 
supervising deputy coroner Dan Cupido and coroner's assistant Brenda Kandjari 
-- who were involved in the mistaken release of a possible female homicide 
victim from Cathedral City to a mortuary home for cremation. 
</P>
<P>
The body of Julie Ann McGhee, 30, was discovered in Cathedral City on July 17 
by Cathedral City Police Department officers. Carrillo said Cupido ordered 
Kandjari to release the body of a man to the mortuary for cremation. Kandjari, 
Carrillo said, failed to look inside the body bag and instead released a 
woman's body. The dead woman's family has filed a $1.5-million claim against 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
Carrillo suspended Cupido for three days and Kandjari for five days. But a 
state mediator in December ordered that the suspensions be rescinded, saying it 
was an innocent mistake. 
</P>
<P>
Union officials attacked Carrillo's action and defended the employees, saying 
that the remains lacked proper identification and that existing policies in the 
coroner's office lend themselves to mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Union's Viewpoint 
</P>
<P>
"What is called for now is not finger-pointing and attempts to place blame 
elsewhere," union spokesman Neff wrote in a union newsletter published this 
month. "What needs to be done is a self-evaluation of Mr. Carrillo's ability to 
administer the coroner's office. Taking public potshots will not decrease the 
problems in the office." 
</P>
<P>
In October, Carrillo's office was embarrassed again when a young couple moved 
into their new home near downtown Riverside and discovered plastic bags on a 
back yard picnic table containing human body parts. 
</P>
<P>
The previous owners were deputy coroners Brad and Alendra Birdsall, who worked 
part time for a private pathology firm, Reference Laboratory, of Colton. 
Carrillo said the body parts found at the home were related to work the couple 
was doing for the laboratory and not related to their duties at the coroner's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know they were cutting at home," Carrillo said. "Had I known that I 
would have stopped them from doing it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Road to Recovery 
</P>
<P>
Despite these problems, Carrillo insisted, "We are on the road to recovery. . . 
. My intention is to get the office back on its feet and working properly." 
</P>
<P>
In early January, he won county approval to form a new management team, hire up 
to seven new employees and establish a special training program for newly hired 
deputy coroners. 
</P>
<P>
"It hasn't been dull around here since Ray has been coroner," said Riverside 
County Administrator Gary Cottrell. "But I definitely think things will 
improve. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I'm a glutton for punishment, but I'm going to see this thing to the 
end," Carrillo said. "The petty innuendo and back-stabbing don't count for a 
hill of beans. What counts are the friends who back you up."

SOVIETS ACCEPT U.S. POLICY REVIEW, KISSINGER SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush met Saturday for more than an hour with Henry A. Kissinger, who 
told him that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his colleagues "are 
very relaxed about the procedures and purposes" of the new Administration and 
are not concerned about delaying further summit meetings until after Bush has 
completed a review of U.S. foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
Some Bush critics have suggested that the Administration's go-slow approach 
could squander an important opportunity for progress in U.S.-Soviet relations. 
But, speaking to reporters after the Oval Office meeting, Kissinger said he 
told Bush that "nobody in Moscow said that" to him during his recent trip 
there. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Will Gain 'Coherence' 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet leadership "understands that a review has to be undertaken," he 
said. "Whatever time we spend now in studying the problems" facing the two 
superpowers, "we will gain in the coherence with which we can pursue them." But 
Kissinger added that he personally "would be amazed" if Bush and Gorbachev did 
not hold a summit "at some point within the next 12-month period." 
</P>
<P>
Separately, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush hopes to 
make a decision on how to bail out the troubled savings and loan industry in 
time to announce his plans in a Feb. 9 speech to a joint session of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
For the last several days, the Administration has been under fire over a 
proposal to pay for the bailout by levying a tax of 25 cents to 30 cents per 
$100 on all checking and savings accounts. Despite widespread criticism of the 
idea, which critics call a new tax and Administration officials insist is a 
non-tax "fee," Fitzwater insisted that the plan "remains an option" that Bush 
may consider. He also denied reports that Administration policy-makers have 
assured savings and loan officials that the plan has been abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting with Kissinger was only the latest signal of the influence that the 
former secretary of state has with the new Administration. Several longtime 
associates of Kissinger have received senior Administration posts, including 
retired Lt. Gen. Brent Scowcroft, Bush's national security adviser, who sat in 
on the Oval Office meeting then met separately with Kissinger for about an 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, many of former President Ronald Reagan's most conservative 
supporters were suspicious of Kissinger, which limited his role over the last 
eight years. 
</P>
<P>
There have been rumors that the Administration might appoint Kissinger as a 
special envoy to represent Bush in a global trouble spot, such as Central 
America. Asked about those rumors, however, Kissinger declined to comment. 
Prior to Kissinger's trip to Moscow, Bush gave him a letter to present to 
Gorbachev, Kissinger said, adding that the Soviet leader gave him a letter of 
greetings to return to Bush. He declined to tell reporters what the letters 
said, joking that Gorbachev's missive "was in Russian . . . I couldn't read 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater also declined to release the text of the letters, saying only that 
Gorbachev's letter contained "greetings (that) were general in nature." 
</P>
<P>
Bush, Fitzwater said, was "interested in Dr. Kissinger's views" and 
"appreciated his report." 
</P>
<P>
The "basic point" that he made, Kissinger said, was that U.S. officials should 
resist the temptation to try to influence events within the Soviet Union, 
either to assist or hinder Gorbachev's attempts at restructuring the Soviet 
system. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Soviets Face 'Huge Task' 
</P>
<P>
"We should concentrate on our foreign policy and let the Soviets worry about 
their domestic policy," he said. Gorbachev's policy, which the Soviets refer to 
as perestroika, "creates a significant problem for the Soviet Union," Kissinger 
added. "To change a system from a Stalinist kind of planned economy to a market 
economy is a huge task." 
</P>
<P>
But, he added, "Gorbachev is a big boy who can take care of his domestic 
affairs" and "I don't think we know enough about his domestic problems" to try 
influencing them.

ISRAEL TRYING TO DEFINE ARMY'S ROLE IN SUPPRESSING UNREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Israeli officials, responding to growing unease in the army over the military's 
role in suppressing the Arab uprising in the occupied territories, are trying 
to define the purpose of the action and prospects for ending the unrest. 
</P>
<P>
But the effort is proving difficult, leaving the military, increasingly under 
public criticism, to justify its actions on mainly technical grounds. 
</P>
<P>
In the past few days, politicians and army officials have tried to give shape 
to a mission many Israelis are finding strained and pointless. The attempt to 
provide a rationale for Israeli policy comes at a time when no one dares 
predict how long the uprising will last -- and whether, in the end, it will 
force Israel to sit at a negotiating table under unfavorable circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a long and complex struggle," Maj. Gen. Ehud Barak, deputy army chief 
of staff, said last week. "We are determined to fight it -- and as long as it 
will be necessary." 
</P>
<P>
Comparing the conflict to some of Israel's earlier prolonged struggles, Barak 
said the battle should not "take years" to resolve, but he declined to set a 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Barak searched for words to define the conflict. "It's not a war," he mused. 
"It's a problem with far-reaching objectives on the Palestinian side." 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to clarify the army's role began after a recent face-off between Prime 
Minister Yitzhak Shamir and soldiers who expressed reservations about the 
methods used to try to put down the uprising, known in Arabic as the intifada. 
Military officers are reporting some resistance by soldiers to serving in the 
West Bank and Gaza Strip, although only 54 Israelis have refused to serve, 
taking a short jail term instead. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the Shamir government is divided over whether the intifada is 
to be solved politically or strictly through military means. 
</P>
<P>
Ten days ago, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, in response to harsh 
parliamentary attacks on his handling of the intifada, hinted that a political 
solution was called for. But his plan to let Arabs in the occupied lands elect 
their own negotiators for talks with Israeli authorities on ending the conflict 
was rejected not only by Palestinians but by Shamir. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, Rabin's proposal seemed intended as much to shore up the morale of 
Israeli troops as to interest the Arabs in a settlement. In comments to the 
Jerusalem Post, Rabin indicated that his proposal helps Israel claim the moral 
high ground, saying the use of force is justified because now it has been 
"accompanied by a proposal for negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
Lacking a clear government policy and saddled with an open-ended commitment to 
keeping order, high-ranking military officers are trying to buttress the moral 
standing of the troops by emphasizing the "legality" of Israel's response to 
the intifada. 
</P>
<P>
"First of all, the orders given during the uprising are legal. I want to 
emphasize that," Brig. Gen. Amnon Strashnov, the army's advocate general, said 
Saturday on a government radio broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
He said the army constantly checks its orders with civilian representatives of 
the Justice Ministry. The justification for suppressing the intifada is usually 
based on regulations dating from before 1948, when Britain ruled the area. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to remember we are dealing with mass provocation. You can't put on 
the army a mission to quell demonstrations while their hands should be kept 
tied behind their backs," Strashnov continued. 
</P>
<P>
"We are a civilized country, part of the civilized world. We have to find . . . 
the right balance, the delicate balance between the necessity of security and 
the rights and civil liberties of the inhabitants of the area." 
</P>
<P>
Answering charges that children have been among the victims of army fire, 
Strashnov asserted that soldiers are told not to fire at Arabs under a certain 
age, although he declined to specify what age. 
</P>
<P>
"Why are those children in those demonstrations? Why don't those parents or 
guardians keep them at home if they know they endanger their lives by taking 
part in a demonstration?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
Strashnov denied reports that new orders permit soldiers to shoot stone 
throwers as they flee. But he suggested that soldiers would have to know the 
mind of each protester to decide whether he was leaving or just regrouping. 
</P>
<P>
"(Soldiers) are not allowed to shoot against people who are running away, only 
. . . within the framework of the demonstration, when somebody is taking 
another place in order to come back and throw stones," Strashnov said. 
</P>
<P>
He estimated that about 50 Israeli soldiers and officers have been prosecuted 
for "using excess force or misuse of weapons." He did not say how many were 
found guilty. A few hundred others were disciplined by their commanders, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
"The amount of casualties is regrettable, and everyone can be sorry about that. 
But on the other hand, (when) we do those things . . . the rules of engagement 
are within very strict limits," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Israel's military policy in the West Bank and Gaza has gone through several 
phases since the intifada began almost 14 months ago. At first, the army went 
in with regular rifles to handle it as if it were a low-key military problem. 
</P>
<P>
As Arab casualties mounted, Israel turned to punishing rebellious Arabs. 
"Force, power and blows," Rabin called it. 
</P>
<P>
But beatings and a few cases of live burials of Palestinians soon became a 
scandal, and the practice was abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
Numerous Arab arrests and casualties last spring quieted the intifada for a few 
months. The army, meanwhile, searched for a technical means of putting down the 
uprising while maintaining authority over the Arabs. A plastic-and-metal bullet 
was introduced in August. Rabin predicted it would increase the number of 
wounded while decreasing fatalities. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Rabin modified the rules of engagement and permitted soldiers 
to fire on stone throwers even when their own lives were not in danger. 
</P>
<P>
The army also took the fight to the Arabs by entering villages and towns to 
confront even modest displays of nationalist sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
Casualties -- and fatalities -- soon mounted, though they decreased somewhat in 
the late fall. 
</P>
<P>
Israel continued to search for a bullet that would disperse but not kill. In 
January, the army put a spherical, rubber-coated metal bullet into use and 
further relaxed the rules of engagement. Soldiers were authorized to shoot at 
stone throwers fleeing the scene of a confrontation as well as at people who 
set tires aflame on roads, streets and alleys. 
</P>
<P>
A sudden spurt of shooting deaths among teen-agers and children ignited another 
domestic uproar. Last week, in response to the lethal effect of plastic-metal 
bullets, Gen. Dan Shomron, the army chief of staff, tried to modify the orders 
for the use of plastic bullets. 
</P>
<P>
"The plastic bullet is not meant to increase the number of wounded," he told 
troops in the West Bank city of Ramallah. "But when there is no other way, and 
we have to control the situation, we will use this method." 
</P>
<P>
In all, about 350 Arabs have been killed and thousands wounded in the uprising. 
Barak said four soldiers have been killed and about 300 have been wounded. In 
addition, nine Israeli civilians -- eight of them Jews and one an Arab -- have 
lost their lives in the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
Military officials attribute a recent high death toll to Arab excitement over 
the opening of talks between Washington and the Palestine Liberation 
Organization, as well as to recent calls by Palestine Liberation Organization 
chief Yasser Arafat for an "escalation" of the intifada. 
</P>
<P>
Arab sources blame the rising casualty figures on two factors. The first was a 
confrontation in Nablus on Dec. 16 when an emotionally charged funeral ended 
with eight Palestinians shot dead. This incident, known among Palestinians as 
Black Friday, ended a debate over whether to reduce street activities among 
Palestinians, the Arab sources say. 
</P>
<P>
The other factor, the Arabs added, is the insistence of the army, operating 
under relaxed guidelines, to enter and break up any kind of protest in West 
Bank and Gaza towns, villages and refugee camps.

Britain will more than double its recruitment of trainee air traffic 
controllers in the next two years to maintain safety in its increasingly 
crowded skies, the Civil Aviation Authority said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman said last year's intake of 80 trainees would rise to 140 this year 
and 180 in 1990. The drive aims to provide 600 new controllers by 1996 to 
replace those retiring and to operate the new control systems needed to cope 
with a forecast growth in air traffic by the end of the century. 
</P>
<P>
The increase in near-collisions in recent years has raised public concern about 
air safety.

IRANIAN PURCHASES OF CHEMICALS FOR POISON GAS TOLD

Iran stockpiled chemicals used to make poison gas through secret purchases from 
West German, Greek, U.S. and Singapore firms, the New York Times, quoting U.S. 
officials and court records, reported in today's editions. 
</P>
<P>
The illegal purchases began during the last months of the Iran-Iraq War, 
according to the newspaper, and continued despite the cease-fire agreed to last 
August. 
</P>
<P>
Although U.S. officials said Washington is concerned by Iran's production of 
poison gas, the Reagan Administration was more vocal in its criticism of Libya, 
which it said has established a chemical weapons plant with the aid of West 
German companies. 
</P>
<P>
"The Libyan program got attention because it was new and because it involved 
(Libyan leader Moammar) Kadafi," the Times quoted a senior U.S. official as 
saying. 
</P>
<P>
"Iran's program has been going on for quite some time, and we're trying to slow 
it down by putting pressure, behind the scenes, on suppliers of chemicals." 
</P>
<P>
Iran's secret purchases were channeled through its Bonn embassy, the report 
said, and came to light through a U.S. Customs Service investigation of an 
Iranian diplomat in West Germany.

Chicago millionaire Noah Robinson was sentenced to the maximum 10 years in 
prison Saturday after being convicted of a felony in connection with the 
attempted murder of a woman who witnessed a slaying. 
</P>
<P>
The jury convicted Robinson, half brother of the Rev. Jesse Jackson and a 
Greenville native, of accessory after the fact of assault and battery with 
intent to kill, in connection with the attempted murder of Janice Denise 
Rosemond. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson also was charged with murder and conspiracy in the death of Leroy 
(Hambone) Barber, but state Circuit Judge James Moore declared a mistrial on 
those counts when the jury failed to reach a verdict. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Victim Survives 
</P>
<P>
Robinson, 45, was accused of hiring someone to kill Rosemond, who witnessed the 
1986 murder of Barber. Rosemond survived a stabbing attack. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson was led away in handcuffs to the Greenville County Detention Center. 
</P>
<P>
Moore declared a mistrial for the charges of murder and conspiracy to commit 
murder in the Barber slaying and criminal conspiracy and accessory before the 
fact of assault and battery with intent to kill in connection with the Rosemond 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
Solicitor Joe Watson, the prosecutor, said Robinson will face another trial on 
those charges. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson was accused of hiring members of the El Rukn gang of Chicago to come 
to Greenville to kill Barber, a former employee and childhood friend. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson and Jackson have the same father but grew up in separate Greenville 
homes. Jackson has refused to comment on his half brother's legal troubles.

NSA'S ATTEMPT TO BLOCK NORTH TRIAL REJECTED; 
</P>
<P>
SPY AGENCY CONCERNED SECRETS MAY BE REVEALED

<TEXT>
<P>
An 11th-hour attempt by the National Security Agency to block the Iran-Contra 
trial of former White House aide Oliver L. North on grounds that it could 
reveal damaging national secrets was rejected last week by Atty. Gen. Dick 
Thornburgh, The Times learned Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Government sources said the appeal by the super-secret NSA failed to gain the 
support of its fellow members on an inter-agency intelligence panel. That 
panel's earlier objections had led to the dropping of two main charges against 
North two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
But the NSA decided to press the matter with Thornburgh, according to an 
Administration source. Under the Classified Information Procedures Act, the 
attorney general is the top government official with authority to prevent 
disclosure of sensitive information at the trial, which is set to open Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The specific objections raised by the agency, which conducts worldwide 
electronic eavesdropping and code-breaking activities from its Ft. Meade, Md., 
headquarters, could not be learned. But government sources said they involved 
matters raised by some of the 300 documents that his lawyers plan to use to 
defend North, a former National Security Council aide. 
</P>
<P>
The inter-agency intelligence panel has been reviewing defense material and the 
avenues of testimony the documents are expected to open. In addition to the 
NSA, the panel includes representatives of the CIA and the departments of 
state, defense and justice. 
</P>
<P>
An official at the NSA's operations center Saturday declined to discuss the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Trial Delay Seen 
</P>
<P>
David Runkel, Thornburgh's chief spokesman, said that "there is nothing pending 
at the present time" with the attorney general that could delay the trial. "As 
far as we're concerned there's no inhibition" to the trial opening on schedule, 
he said. Runkel would not confirm or deny that the NSA had appealed to 
Thornburgh. 
</P>
<P>
James Wieghart, a spokesman for independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh, said: 
"We are prepared to go to trial and expect to Tuesday." He said he could not 
discuss matters involving the inter-agency committee. 
</P>
<P>
The inter-agency panel's review of North's defense documents appears to be the 
last substantial hurdle to the start of the trial, and the NSA's decision to 
lodge its own appeal with Thornburgh signaled that the panel will raise no 
further objections before the proceedings begin. 
</P>
<P>
North's attorneys are seeking to subpoena former President Ronald Reagan and 
President Bush to testify at the trial. But U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. 
Gesell on Friday postponed a decision on whether to uphold the defense 
subpoenas for their testimony and relevant documents, and the question is not 
expected to delay the trial opening. 
</P>
<P>
North's lawyers would like to prove that North took part in several covert 
operations similar to the Iran arms initiative. They hope that jurors might 
conclude that North believed that selling arms to Iran to win release of U.S. 
hostages was entirely legal, since the other projects had been authorized. 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear whether the NSA objections involved covert operations that 
North took part in as an NSC aide. But the agency traditionally has been the 
most sensitive on the inter-agency panel about disclosing intelligence sources 
and methods. 
</P>
<P>
Acting on objections raised by the inter-agency panel to classified information 
that Walsh's prosecutors sought to disclose at the trial, Gesell on Jan. 13 
dismissed the two main charges of conspiracy and theft against North after 
Thornburgh certified that government secrets would be compromised. 
</P>
<P>
The 12 remaining counts allege that North made false statements to Congress, 
obstructed justice by shredding White House documents, participated in a tax 
fraud conspiracy involving private fund raising for the Nicaraguan Contras and 
illegally accepted installation of a $13,800 security fence outside his home.

The Burundi government freed six people who last year accused the army of 
summarily executing Hutu tribe members during ethnic clashes, a state-owned 
radio reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Radio Burundi, in a broadcast monitored in Nairobi, did not identify the six 
people it said were released Thursday, but did say that they belonged to the 
majority Hutu tribe. 
</P>
<P>
In August, Hutu in two northern communities of this East African nation 
attacked Tutsi neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
The predominantly Tutsi army was sent to restore order but turned against the 
Hutu. At least 5,000 people died and an estimated 50,000 fled to neighboring 
Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
Government opponents say 17 people were arrested for accusing the army of the 
executions in a letter last year to President Pierre Buyoya of Burundi. The 
radio denied that charge.

SCIENTISTS ISSUE CALL FOR ACTION ON WORLD'S ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Increasing environmental problems -- from global climate changes to beaches 
fouled with medical wastes -- demand reinvigorated environmental activism, 
several leading scientists said Saturday at Stanford University. 
</P>
<P>
The call to action came at a student-run conference, coincidentally held on the 
20th anniversary of the Santa Barbara oil spill, at which scientific, political 
and business leaders debated how to jointly contend with the world's worsening 
environmental state. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the first day of the two-day meeting, speakers repeatedly warned 
that established assumptions about consumption and need are pushing the world 
toward environmental crisis, despite many effective environmental programs 
begun over the last 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Addiction to Growth' 
</P>
<P>
"We have a severe addiction to growth without asking what kind we need and what 
kind we can afford," said David Brower, founder and chairman of the Earth 
Island Institute. 
</P>
<P>
"It's time to stop looking at things in terms of (getting) more or less" than 
others, said Joan Martin-Brown of the United Nations Environmental Program. 
"What we need to look at is not what we want, but what we need to live in 
dignity." 
</P>
<P>
Others urged conference members to educate people to problems before they 
become crises, and support politicians who are pro-active on issues. 
</P>
<P>
Washington University, St. Louis, botanist Peter Raven, secretary of the 
prestigious National Academy of Sciences, began the conference by warning that 
ignorance, indifference, poverty and greed are producing interrelated problems 
that threaten to radically alter Earth for the worse over the next 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
"There is evidence all around us that the world is changing in ways that deeply 
disturb us," he said. "Unless we change, the world we leave our children and 
grandchildren will only vaguely resemble the world we know today." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Debt Is a Factor 
</P>
<P>
Crushing Third World foreign debt, for example, encourages peasants to cut and 
burn tropical rain forests as a way to survive, he and others noted. This 
worsens atmospheric changes, hurts global resource supplies and prevents 
research into the possible uses of plants and animals before their extinction 
-- all of which harm the nations benefitting from the debt. 
</P>
<P>
Such problems require global answers because local laws often only displace 
environmental degradation, he said. In particular, he cited efforts by wealthy 
nations to ship toxic and hazardous wastes to underdeveloped countries.

TRAGEDY LURKS IN A SYSTEM MEANT TO HEAL;

SAFETY FOR FOSTER-CARE CHILDREN CAN GO AMISS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An El Cajon man was charged with 26 separate counts of sexually molesting a 
minor. A Carlsbad woman was accused of denying a 15-year-old diabetic child her 
insulin medication. And a Poway man allegedly disciplined a child by angrily 
"swinging him through the air and throwing him" onto the top of a bunk bed. 
</P>
<P>
They all are foster parents, and like the case this past week of Henri Dyson 
and her son, Harold, they all have lost their San Diego County foster-care home 
licenses during the last year. 
</P>
<P>
The Dyson case is brutal in its possible ramifications, in that as many as 17 
foster children were placed by county social workers in the Mira Mesa home 
where torture, abuse and harsh discipline allegedly ruled their lives. The 
Dysons were charged this past week with multiple counts of child abuse and, 
after pleading not guilty, jailed on bail of $200,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
11 Other Cases in 1988 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, 11 other abuse cases surfaced in the county's foster child-care 
program. 
</P>
<P>
In many of the cases, the victims were the foster parents' natural children, or 
the licenses were stripped after authorities learned of past abuse by the 
foster parents. 
</P>
<P>
While most of these cases do not approach the horror of the allegations 
surrounding the Dyson home, each in its own way vividly portrays the potential 
for child abuse in a program that is charged with protecting children but one 
that occasionally places them in an environment where abuse continues. 
</P>
<P>
It is an agency that is understaffed. And agency officials are constantly 
concerned about the safety and welfare of children who are taken from abusive 
homes and placed under their supervision. 
</P>
<P>
The Dyson case also has shocked San Diego police and child-protection service 
officials because the alleged abuse went unchecked for as long as the six years 
Henri Dyson held her foster-care license -- a period in which the county 
Department of Social Services believed she was an ideal foster mother. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Dyson case came to the attention of authorities only after Henri 
Dyson carried a 17-month-old boy who was in her care to a hospital, where 
doctors found him to be in a coma brought on by what appears to have been 
torture with a water enema. 
</P>
<P>
None of the 11 foster-home license revocations and application denials that 
occurred in 1988 in San Diego County garnered the headlines of the Dyson case. 
None of them drew so much as a public whimper about the potential that exists 
for already abused children to suffer again. 
</P>
<P>
That potential can surface in many forms. 
</P>
<P>
Alfred Toomer of San Diego, for instance, was well on his way to being granted 
a foster-care license before authorities realized that he had been twice 
convicted in Georgia, in 1958 for voluntary manslaughter and in 1966 for 
assault with intent to murder. 
</P>
<P>
In a September hearing that resulted in the license application being denied, 
the state said: "Mr. Toomer has failed to demonstrate that he has been 
rehabilitated and is presently of such good character to justify issuance of 
this license because the (crimes are) of a highly serious nature." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. David Chadwick, of the Center for Child Protection at Children's Hospital, 
said no victim is more tragic than the child who is repeatedly abused. 
</P>
<P>
"If you were to devise a method for making kids crazy, making them violent, you 
would abuse them first in their own home and then move them to another home and 
abuse them again," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Learn What They Live' 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost inevitably going to produce serious mental health problems in 
those kids. How can a child live with that and not come away with a learned 
feeling that the world is violent and abusive and, in the case of sexual abuse, 
that this is the way people relate to one another. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very true what the old motto says: 'Children learn what they live.' And 
when that stuff is around them all the time, that's their world. That's what 
they know." 
</P>
<P>
But Sondra Brinkley, chief of licensing for the county's Department of Social 
Services, said it is rarely all that easy to identify and confirm specific 
allegations of abuse. Complaints are often anonymous and dated, and children 
are terribly afraid to admit that they have been abused. There is strong peer 
pressure, and abused children are constantly frightened they will be returned 
to the home. 
</P>
<P>
"It all can be very hard to sort out," she said. "Unless you see bruises on a 
child, it can be very difficult to get to the bottom of some complaints. 
Sometimes, it's just one word against another." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Police Department Detective Rick Carlson, who helped break the Dyson 
case, recalled that the foster children in the Dyson home refused to tell about 
their suffering until they had been out of that environment for more than 24 
hours and had been repeatedly assured that they were not going back. 
</P>
<P>
"They were regimented," he said, in describing how the children looked and 
acted. "They were very well-behaved, almost to the point of standing at 
attention. They were scared and frightened. They were withdrawn." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1,700 Foster-Care Homes 
</P>
<P>
Brinkley said there are roughly 1,700 licensed foster-care homes in San Diego 
County, providing food, clothing and shelter to just under 3,000 foster 
children. These children stay in the foster homes anywhere from one day to 17 
years, with the agency seeking to either return them safely to their natural 
parents, to new adoptive parents, or, lastly, into long-term foster care. 
</P>
<P>
The children come from a battery of broken environments. Often they have been 
physically and sexually abused by their parents or others close to the family. 
Sometimes their parents end up in jail; sometimes dead. And sometimes the 
children are taken to foster homes in the first days of life, often born to 
mothers who are heroin addicts. 
</P>
<P>
"These are what we call medically fragile infants," she said. 
</P>
<P>
To meet this demand for foster care, the county agency conducts weekly seminars 
geared at encouraging new families to open their doors to foster children. If, 
after attending these seminars, a couple decides to apply for a foster-care 
license, a lengthy background review begins. 
</P>
<P>
A criminal background check is conducted, including fingerprinting adults in 
the home. The names are checked with the state child-abuse index to make sure 
none of the applicants or their dependents are past abusers. Health tests are 
made. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are site visits, in which inspectors tour the home to determine if 
it complies with health and safety codes. Applicants are also asked to complete 
a home-study questionnaire that measures their skill in dealing with children. 
And there are 16 hours of formal training, both in a classroom setting and in 
sessions with experienced foster-care parents, focusing on how to handle 
problem children. 
</P>
<P>
Once a home is licensed, foster parents are paid $300 to $400 a month per 
child. License workers monitor the environment through annual home visits. 
</P>
<P>
But Brinkley, complaining of understaffing, said that San Diego County 
foster-care inspectors are carrying about 150 cases at any given time. The 
statewide caseload average is only 89, she said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, every time a complaint is filed, a license worker must show up 
unannounced at the door. 
</P>
<P>
"We do an investigation, and, if it's a serious complaint, it frequently would 
involve discussions with the children and could involve the police," Brinkley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
She said thousands of complaints are received each year, many anonymous, many 
dealing with minor violations, through the Child Abuse Hotline, 560-2191. About 
two-thirds of them are unsubstantiated. 
</P>
<P>
"Say a child was left alone. Well, by the the time you get out there and ask 
the foster parent, she says of course she didn't leave a child alone," Brinkley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"And sometimes we will not know about this kind of thing for years. And 
generally, when we find out about these allegations, it can take months before 
the state is willing to move and revoke the license. And the state is making 
more and more demands on our caseworkers." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aggressive Stance 
</P>
<P>
Kathleen Norris, a spokeswoman for the state Social Services Department in 
Sacramento, said government inspectors have become more aggressive in seeking 
out abuse in the last few years, particularly since the sensational McMartin 
Preschool child-abuse case in Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
She said 329 child- or foster-care licenses were revoked in the state in 1987, 
up from 242 just two years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"The most common thread for all revocations is some sort of abuse, whether it's 
neglect or physical or sexual or mental abuse," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But, even with heightened public awareness of child abuse, more reporting of 
child abuse and more revocations of license holders, some cases still get by 
the system. Every time that happens, the consequences are tragic. 
</P>
<P>
Brinkley said police are notified of all serious allegations, but that criminal 
prosecutions seldom follow. Often, she said, simply removing the children from 
the home solves the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Only one of the 11 cases in 1988 in San Diego County led to criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
George M. Hale of El Cajon was charged with 26 counts of molesting a male under 
age 14 in a series of offenses that began in August, 1982. The victim was a 
youngster that Hale had met through his church. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Hale and his wife, Susan, were licensed as both foster-care and 
day-care providers. But the license was revoked in October of last year, the 
same month he was given five years' probation after plea-bargaining to four 
counts of oral copulation with a minor. 
</P>
<P>
The state foster-care licensing agency, in removing him from its rolls, said 
Hale's conduct was "inimical to the health, morals, welfare and safety of the 
people of California." 
</P>
<P>
Court records show that Hale, in admitting his past conduct, said: "I consider 
it a great tragedy. If there were a button to push to rewind life or erase it, 
I would." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Cases 
</P>
<P>
Some of the 1988 cases involved physical abuse, agency records show. 
</P>
<P>
William and Jacque Burrow of Poway lost the foster-care license they had held 
since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Officials alleged that "William Burrow physically disciplined (a child) by 
swinging him through the air and throwing him onto a top bunk in anger." And 
Jacque Burrow allegedly "physically and verbally abused (a child) after she 
became sick and vomited in (the Burrows') automobile." 
</P>
<P>
Hazel Farmer, who ran a combined foster-care and day-care operation in the 
South Bay, lost her license in June. Authorities contended that she choked a 
3-year-old child so viciously that he suffered bruises and other injuries to 
his neck, and that she also "yelled at and struck a 6-year-old." 
</P>
<P>
Nathaniel and Deidra Brooks of San Diego, licensed foster-care and day-care 
operators since 1984, were dropped from the program in December. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities alleged that a 3-year-old handicapped child was placed in a tub of 
scalding water, causing third-degree burns to the child's right leg and foot; 
that a child was hit "with various objects, including hands, a belt and an 
electrical cord," and that one child was punished "for wetting his bed by 
making him sleep on a plastic mat on the floor." 
</P>
<P>
Other foster-home licenses were terminated, government records show, because 
the parents allegedly did not provide adequate medical care for the children. 
</P>
<P>
Judith Mariner of Carlsbad, licensed for six foster children since 1986, was 
dismissed from the program in November. 
</P>
<P>
She failed to provide insulin shots for a 15-year-old diabetic child, who later 
was admitted to the Hillcrest Receiving Home "with an elevated blood glucose 
level," records show. 
</P>
<P>
She also reportedly canceled a child's appointments for a hearing aid and left 
children unattended at home. 
</P>
<P>
And Lorena May of La Mesa lost her 3-year-old license in December after a girl 
in her care suffered a severe yeast infection and, later, a "severe rash on her 
back, buttocks and genital area," according to the records.

DEBATE OVER RAMONA'S GROUND WATER RUNS AS DEEP AS SOME OF ITS WELLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ahhh, country living. Clean air. Clean water. 
</P>
<P>
So when Luke Greeson moved to Ramona from the Los Angeles suburb of South Gate 
about 20 years ago, he didn't hesitate to drill a well 100 feet into the 
ground, tapping into a ready, steady and cheap supply of water to keep his lawn 
green, his clothes clean and his thirst quenched. 
</P>
<P>
But Luke Greeson is drinking bottled water these days because of concern that 
the ground water beneath his house may no longer be fit for human consumption. 
</P>
<P>
Yet his next-door neighbor, Julene Gyde, has no hesitancy about drinking that 
same water. In fact, she is so satisfied by the water from her well that she 
and her husband disconnected themselves from the community's piped water supply 
and now rely solely on the water 100 feet beneath their horse ranch on the 
south side of town. 
</P>
<P>
And so it goes in Ramona these days, with a brewing and technical debate over 
the quality of Ramona's underground water. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Highest Concentration of Drinking Wells 
</P>
<P>
Though most of Ramona's households are served by the Ramona Municipal Water 
District, some estimates put at 1,000 the number of homes in and around Ramona 
that rely on their own wells, either out of preference or because of the cost 
to tie in to the municipal water lines. County water officials say Ramona has 
the highest concentration of drinking-water wells in the county. 
</P>
<P>
For these residents, the issue is over the presence of nitrates in the ground 
water and what harm -- if any -- is caused to the human body by them. 
</P>
<P>
Nitrates result from decomposing plants, animals and microbes, from the liquid 
and solid waste of humans and animals and in runoff from nitrate-based 
fertilizers. According to the federal Environmental 
</P>
<P>
Protection Agency, the presence of more than 10 milligrams of nitrates (as 
nitrogen) in a liter of water is dangerous to infants up to 6 months old 
because it converts in the body to nitrite and can cause methemoglobinemia in 
those who have difficulty assimilating nitrites. The disease, also known as 
"blue baby disease," essentially transforms hemoglobin -- the blood's 
oxygen-carrying component -- to another form, which cannot transport oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers say the disease is very rare and may be brought on because of other 
complications. Adults are not considered at risk by drinking nitrate-high water 
because they normally consume far more nitrates in their food than they would 
get from water itself. 
</P>
<P>
A San Diego State University student working on her master's degree in public 
health studied the nitrate problem in Ramona's ground water and found that, 
based on her sampling of wells, several of Ramona's various underground water 
aquifers are tainted by levels of nitrates exceeding the safety limits 
established by the EPA. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Turkey Farms and Dairies 
</P>
<P>
The high levels may be of little surprise, given the groves and orchards in the 
Ramona area that are fertilized with nitrate-rich chemicals, and given the 
region's history as home to dairies and turkey and chicken farms -- and the 
mounds of nitrate-generating manure they produced. 
</P>
<P>
But the EPA nitrate limits apply only to public water supplies -- such as the 
water provided through the Ramona Municipal Water District, which, because it 
blends local well water with imported water, has nitrate levels well within the 
federal standards. 
</P>
<P>
Private homeowners using their own wells, however, are not governed by the EPA, 
and, unless they test their wells on their own for chemical analysis, they may 
not even know if or to what degree they have the tasteless nitrates in their 
water. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego County's Department of Health Services approves private wells at the 
time they are dug, checking them both for construction quality and to make sure 
the water has not been contaminated by surface bacteria during the boring. But 
the county is not required to check for the presence of nitrates in private 
water wells. 
</P>
<P>
Enter Carol Close, a Ramona housewife-turned-activist on the matter of water 
quality, who has campaigned for public awareness about the presence of nitrates 
and for more government monitoring of private wells in Ramona. 
</P>
<P>
Close, the mother of three young children, says she is not convinced that 
Ramonans understand the danger of nitrates. It was through her persistence that 
the county hired Marijke Lynne Bekken, the SDSU graduate student, to study the 
nitrate problem in Ramona. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Triple the EPA Standard 
</P>
<P>
In one particular sampling of 24 wells, Bekken found that 15 exceeded the EPA 
limit for nitrates in water, with one well measuring 34.5 milligrams per liter, 
or more than triple the EPA standard. Bekken then solicited well users from 
throughout Ramona to bring her samples of water, and, out of 98, 41 tested over 
the standard. 
</P>
<P>
Though no one is criticizing Bekken's raw findings, there is debate over how 
large a red flag to wave. 
</P>
<P>
Close wants the county to notify all well users in Ramona that their water may 
be dangerous to drink, to conduct a comprehensive study of Ramona's ground 
water that would go beyond Bekken's master's thesis and to make land-use 
decisions that eventually will reduce the number of dairies and other nitrate 
sources in the region. 
</P>
<P>
"When I had my well tested, they gave me a certificate telling me my water was 
OK. I believed them," Close said, noting that the test was for bacteria but not 
for nitrates. "But it's not safe." 
</P>
<P>
Some of Close's frustration is directed at the state Regional Water Quality 
Control Board, which in 1987 approved the expansion of a Ramona dairy herd from 
675 to 1,200 cows. 
</P>
<P>
That decision was appealed by Close and others to the State Water Resources 
Board in Sacramento, which voted unanimously last October to block the 
expansion because it would have had a "significant adverse effect" on Ramona's 
ground-water supply. 
</P>
<P>
Close acknowledges that there can be no quick solution to the nitrate problem. 
Experts say that if every nitrate source were immediately removed, it would 
still take years for the ground water to cleanse itself. 
</P>
<P>
Despite several stories in Ramona's community newspaper about the nitrate 
problem, many people say they are not concerned. 
</P>
<P>
Some, like Mary Turner, who has been drinking Ramona well water for 13 years, 
say that, since there are no infants at home, "it doesn't concern me." 
</P>
<P>
Julene Gyde, a director on the Ramona-Julian Resource Conservation District and 
a resident who lives directly across the street from the dairy that received 
Close's wrath, remarked, "I'm more concerned about the pollution in the air and 
the problems with the greenhouse effect than I am about nitrates in the water." 
</P>
<P>
But Gyde's neighbor, 67-year-old Luke Greeson, said he doesn't want to take any 
chances. "I stopped drinking my well water three or four years ago when I had 
it tested. It was high in nitrates. I'm a cautious man, and I'm not sure it 
might not harm older people. You never know." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Kast, who moved from Poway to Ramona 10 years ago, said he's concerned 
enough by the news to have his well checked regularly. His nitrates are now 
half the EPA limit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Proud of the Purity 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Kelly relies on a combination of bottled and well water, and boasts, "I 
had my water tested, and they said it was cleaner than the city's." 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Meyer, a director of the Ramona Planning Group, said she thinks the 
nitrate issue "has been blown out of proportion by special-interest groups who 
seem to oppose the dairies." 
</P>
<P>
Still, she concedes: "There is definitely a lot of nitrates in the water. When 
we first drilled our well 17 years ago, it was beautiful. But, four or five 
years ago, we had our water retested and came to find it had excessive nitrates 
and sodium." Today, she drinks bottled water, partly out of uncertainty of the 
effect nitrates might have on her elderly parents, who live with her. 
</P>
<P>
Day Hodges, who lives on the north side of Ramona, says he has ground-water 
concerns other than the presence of nitrates. "We live next door to the county 
dump up here," he noted. He is worried about toxins leaching into the ground 
water he draws from. 
</P>
<P>
For their part, county officials acknowledge the problem but say it's not their 
business to meddle -- especially once the private well is dug. 
</P>
<P>
But starting last August, county health officials began requiring that anyone 
building a home in the Ramona basin first have their domestic water wells 
tested not only for bacteria, but for nitrates as well. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Devine, chief of the health department's environmental health services 
division, said that if a new well shows the presence of nitrates-as-nitrogen in 
levels exceeding the EPA limit of 10 milligrams per liter, his department will 
refuse to authorize a building permit for that house. 
</P>
<P>
He said he did not know of any instances since August of new home construction 
being denied because of high nitrate levels. That fact, he said, may indicate 
not that the nitrates have disappeared, but that well diggers are boring deeper 
to penetrate beyond the upper levels of the ground water and tap cleaner water. 
</P>
<P>
Devine said the concern about nitrates serves as a good lesson to people 
relying on their own water wells. "People check their cars to the nth degree to 
make sure they're in good shape. They should have that same concern about the 
water they drink by checking their wells, too. That's the key. People are 
taking their well water for granted." 
</P>
<P>
Jack Conway, the associate director of the School of Public Health at SDSU and 
Bekken's adviser for her thesis, said he welcomes the public discussion over 
the debate. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not cause for hysteria," he said, "but discussion is the better part 
of valor."

AN IMMIGRANT FAMILY'S UPHILL STRUGGLE FOR SURVIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
"This is not a house!" our 14-year-old daughter, Mary, exclaimed as we pulled 
up next to the dilapidated stable our friends had just moved into. "I don't 
want to go inside." 
</P>
<P>
I didn't either. We hated to see this Oaxacan Indian family evicted from a 
decent apartment because they couldn't manage the rent and utilities. This 
stable had been in better condition when it housed animals -- but it was warmer 
than sleeping in the fields as many of their Mexican countrymen were doing. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the children came out to greet us, full of smiles and hugs. A rusty 
tricycle and a faded stroller sat in the dirt. Around the fire pit a circle of 
small shoes was drying after the rain the day before. A hose led to a discarded 
sink, the only sign of plumbing at the stable. The couple who lived in the 
front house had offered the "Conde" family (as I'll call them) shelter in 
exchange for yard work and baby sitting. I steeled myself to go inside. 
</P>
<P>
A light bulb hung from the ceiling in the corner of the stable they were 
occupying. An old refrigerator, table and chairs completed the kitchen, while a 
scrap of avocado-colored sculptured carpet and one mattress made up the 
"parlor." November winds came through the broken boards in the walls. Rita, the 
tiny mother, changing 8-month-old Arturo, gave us a tired smile and asked us to 
sit down. She looked a little fuller around the middle -- but I put the thought 
out of my mind. Serufino was at work at a nearby nursery. 
</P>
<P>
It appeared the only thing that had improved since my husband, Vic, and I met 
them two years ago, before we helped them file amnesty papers, was that now 
Serufino had a work permit and no longer feared being deported. Unable to read 
and write Spanish or English, because he only went as far as third grade in a 
remote mountain village, he still earned close-to-minimum wage. Most important 
to the parents, the new baby is a citizen, as are his brother and two sisters. 
Six-year-old Lucinda had started school and 5-year-old Oscar would soon. Pretty 
4-year-old Teresa looked especially beautiful playing outside the run-down 
stable. 
</P>
<P>
But how could they survive in this primitive place . . . 
</P>
<P>
Amnesty was not enough. 
</P>
<P>
The Condes had tried to better their living conditions. Last year, before 
Arturo was born, the family had moved out of a similar one-room shack with no 
heat or running water, into a real house in Encinitas they shared with several 
other families. The five were willing to live and sleep in a small corner of 
the front room, partitioned-off with plywood and a sheet, in order to have the 
use of a kitchen and bathroom. Rita was happy to be with other women -- until 
drunks came in at all hours of the night, making it impossible, and unsafe, to 
sleep. 
</P>
<P>
Just before Thanksgiving, in 1987, the owner of the house came home drunk one 
night, demanding the following month's rent. When the Condes didn't have it, he 
forced them out onto the street. They called us, asking Vic to drive them to a 
field where they could pitch a tent the Rev. Rafael Martinez had lent them. 
They had all their possessions in five trash bags when we arrived. 
</P>
<P>
Unable to bear the thought of them in a field, we took them to a cheap motel. 
Vic had to persuade the desk clerk to let the family use only one room, even 
though it had two double beds. The clerk claimed it was against the law for 
five people to sleep in one motel room. 
</P>
<P>
Our oldest daughter, Katy, surprised us by inviting them to spend Thanksgiving 
weekend with her family. The Conde children explored the grassy yard filled 
with toys, while Serufino and Rita walked up and down the streets of Leucadia, 
searching for a casita they could afford. 
</P>
<P>
They found a "For Rent" sign on an old house that was in the first stages of 
being remodeled. Since the carpet had been torn out, holes punctuated the 
walls, and the broken stove and refrigerator sat rusting in the courtyard, the 
owner agreed to rent it for just $500 -- the rent would go up when the repairs 
were completed. The five were thrilled to have four rooms to themselves -- and 
hot baths. 
</P>
<P>
The hot water lasted as long as the privacy. Just as the water heater gave out 
the following week, the owner arrived late one night, bringing another family 
to share the place with them. Nothing was said, however, about sharing the 
rent. The others were to pay an additional amount. Serufino and Rita refused 
and insisted that the other family leave. 
</P>
<P>
The antiquated electric wall heater gave off little heat. They plugged up the 
holes in the walls with rags, hung a bedspread at the drapeless sliding glass 
door. Rita cooked on a kerosene camp stove someone lent them, waiting each day 
for the new stove to be delivered. 
</P>
<P>
A few days before Christmas, the owner called me, asking my help to get them 
out. The school nurse had visited them, and, seeing piles of garbage under the 
adjoining building, holes in the walls, and finding the children huddled in bed 
to keep warm, called the woman a "slumlord" and threatened to call authorities. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not a slumlord," she protested. "They moved in before the place was 
ready. I never promised them a stove. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
"And," she spat the words out, "she's pregnant again!" 
</P>
<P>
When the family moved to a decent upstairs apartment in Carlsbad, they were in 
for a shock. 
</P>
<P>
Even though they had rarely used the electric heater, and little other 
electricity in the time they were at the old house, faulty wiring had caused an 
electrical leak somewhere, running up a bill of hundreds of dollars. The 
utility company confirmed the meter reading. The huge bill kept coming, along 
with threats of the electricity being disconnected at their new address. A 
generous couple loaned them the money to pay the utility company. 
</P>
<P>
Thinking that their problems would be solved if they could just get their three 
children baptized in the Catholic Church, Serufino asked us to be the 
godparents. We were delighted to do so, wishing that were the solution. On Feb. 
28, 1988, on the 100th anniversary of the birth of my grandfather on a poor 
farm in Ireland, the Conde children were baptized with our grandchild Katy's 
new son, Billy. We were now compadres. 
</P>
<P>
Since Rita had almost died giving birth to Teresa, the Rev. Martinez checked on 
her often in March. When he found Rita in labor, he rushed her to the hospital 
to give birth by Cesarean. The following week, when the Condes went to visit 
their tiny preemie son, Arturo, they were told to take him home, as he had run 
up thousands of dollars and they had no insurance. 
</P>
<P>
With Serufino's low wages, and Rita unable to work outside the house, it was 
difficult juggling rent, utilities and all the expenses of this growing family. 
The electricity was finally turned off. Needing a way to keep their milk from 
souring, he ran an extension cord from the refrigerator, down a wall and into 
the laundry room of the complex on the floor below. By this time, in order to 
pay the rent, they had "sublet" the bedrooms to two other families and they 
slept in the living room. Serufino should run a hotel, we kidded. 
</P>
<P>
But we were not surprised when the landlord asked them to leave. It was then 
that the couple offered them the use of the former stable -- where they still 
live. 
</P>
<P>
Our church gave the Condes groceries at Thanksgiving and a family adopted them 
at Christmas, providing toys, clothing and food. They were grateful that so 
many people cared about them. 
</P>
<P>
Life was improving until two weeks ago, when Rita wrenched her shoulder while 
cleaning the stable. Serufino called us several nights later when she was still 
in pain. Convinced she must have stepped on someone's grave, the tiny Oaxacan 
Indian tried to treat the muscle spasms by rubbing herself with garlic. 
</P>
<P>
When we took her to the hospital emergency room, the attendants were very kind 
to her. The receptionist said they would not turn anyone away because he had no 
money. They would mail the bill (for several hundred dollars) to the Condes. 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, the nurse came out to the waiting room and asked Serufino in 
front of everyone, "Is she pregnant?" 
</P>
<P>
He nodded and said, "Five months." 
</P>
<P>
I had to leave the room so he wouldn't see me cry. 
</P>
<P>
Back at "home," the painkillers made Rita hallucinate. She thought she was 
possessed or that a witch had put a spell on her. When rain leaked into the 
shack, her spasms grew worse. Vic decided the only way she could get well was 
if we brought her home with us. With pain-killing ointment rubbed onto her 
shoulder and a heating pad, she fell asleep in our Mary's bed. After a hot 
shower the next morning, Rita could move her arm a little. Knowing I would 
understand, since I had seven babies in nine years, she told me this would be 
the last child, making a scissors gesture at the sides of her abdomen. 
</P>
<P>
Rita is now well and has found a Spanish-speaking doctor, who we hope will 
deliver the baby -- and honor her wish that it be her last. Serufino is back at 
work. He has patched the stable walls with plywood, and is building an 
outhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Our neighbors donated blankets, furniture and a crib. Chubby Arturo is 
thriving. Lucinda is learning English -- and teaching it to her parents. The 
Condes still need guidance, a living wage, medical insurance -- and a great 
deal more than amnesty. 
</P>
<P>
But these people are survivors. They give me more than I could ever give them. 
</P>
<P>
Little Oscar has a dream. In good weather, he sees red, green and blue hot air 
balloons launched near the stable. He announced to his family, "When I get big, 
I'm going to buy us our own hot air balloon." 
</P>
<P>
I hope he'll take me up with him.

WHAT FARM WORKERS NEED IS A LONG-TERM HOUSING SOLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA SMITH, Claudia Smith is a regional counsel of California Rural Legal 
Assistance, a federally and state-funded organization that has provided legal 
services to farm workers for 22 years. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Periodically, the plight of farm workers, especially migrants, is brought to 
the public's attention with great force. Such has been the case at Valle Verde, 
a Carlsbad encampment that is being torn down by order of the county Department 
of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
Living there and in other North County camps -- in "spider holes" or shacks 
made of sticks, cardboard boxes, plastic bags and twine -- are farm workers 
whose literally backbreaking labor helps return millions of dollars in 
agricultural profits. 
</P>
<P>
Such pockets of misery can be found throughout California's farmlands, but 
North County -- from North City West up to Rainbow and across to Pauma Valley 
-- is incomparable in terms of sheer numbers of homeless workers and the 
stunning juxtaposition of mansions and hovels. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, nowhere else in the state -- and perhaps even the country -- do the 
living conditions of farm workers so consistently outdo those exposed in Edward 
R. Murrow's classic "Harvest of Shame" broadcast nearly 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Although brutal awareness of this problem alone will not resolve it, publicity 
can help create a political atmosphere in which positive steps can be taken. 
</P>
<P>
Valle Verde cries out for short-term solutions, such as emergency shelter for 
those displaced. It also raises questions about the county's role in 
aggravating an already critical situation by triggering mass evictions from 
relatively isolated encampments unlikely to pose an immediate threat to the 
larger community's health. 
</P>
<P>
However, Valle Verde also underscores the need to build decent and affordable 
farm-worker housing. Two North County realities serve to drive home the 
inescapable need for this long-term solution. 
</P>
<P>
One is that the majority of North County's farm workers now have temporary work 
permits and are on their way to obtaining permanent residency. Increasingly, 
their families are following them here. The U. S. Border Patrol itself 
calculates that documented laborers make up about 65% of the migrant work 
force. Living in encampments can no longer be dismissed as a deliberate choice 
by workers who need to "hide out." The truth is that these minimum-wage (at 
best), seasonal and often underemployed workers simply cannot afford the area's 
high rents -- much less the many deposits that renting entails. 
</P>
<P>
The other fact is that, despite the heavy pressures of urbanization, 
agriculture is here to stay. For the foreseeable future, the year-round demand 
for agricultural laborers will remain fairly stable. It may come as a big 
surprise that San Diego County ranks 12th among California's 58 counties in 
volume of agricultural production -- having recently raised its standing from 
13th. 
</P>
<P>
According to state Department of Food and Agriculture reports, the production 
of highly labor-intensive crops has increased markedly over the past 15 years. 
Only vegetable production experienced a decline, of 20%. Strawberry production 
has doubled. Avocado acreage has nearly tripled and citrus acreage has expanded 
18%. Nursery crop production has grown so much that San Diego County is now the 
state's leading producer of horticultural products. 
</P>
<P>
Data from the San Diego Assn. of Governments suggest that agricultural 
employment will remain essentially unchanged through the year 2010 (the 
farthest date of projection). A study commissioned by my organization, 
California Rural Legal Assistance, examined crop acreage due for development 
and expects only an 8% reduction in agricultural employment for the foreseeable 
future. If forecasts on the growth in demand for horticultural products are 
correct, such employment may actually increase. 
</P>
<P>
To put this into some perspective, the most conservative estimates -- based 
only on wages paid subject to withholding and Social Security taxes -- is that, 
in any given month, San Diego County employs about 11,400 workers in 
agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
What this adds up to is: San Diego County will continue to have many 
agricultural workers, most of whom will not earn enough to secure decent and 
affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
The first concrete step toward providing that housing these workers need has 
been taken by Assemblyman Robert C. Frazee (R-Carlsbad), who is reintroducing a 
bill to provide state seed money for the construction of a 500-unit 
migrant-labor center. Under the Frazee bill, the remaining money must come from 
other sources, such as the federal government (the Farmers Home Administration, 
for example), local government (such as funds from redevelopment and community 
development block grants) and private sources. 
</P>
<P>
The state has built 26 migrant labor centers in 14 counties to house farm 
workers and their families at subsidized rates of $2 to $4 a day. Typically, 
growers or local governments donated the land. 
</P>
<P>
None of the centers is south of Kern County. Such lopsided distribution is 
largely the result of resistance from local governments. For instance, the 
less-than-eager reception given last year by San Diego County to a similar bill 
provided the governor with a "lack-of-local-support" excuse to kill it. A 
couple of years ago, through the efforts of Assemblyman Bill Bradley 
(R-Escondido), $1.4 million was made available for a farm labor center here. 
The funds were lost to Riverside County because of little interest on the part 
of San Diego County's Department of Housing and Community Development. 
</P>
<P>
A migrant labor center only begins to touch the need. There are many other 
efforts that can be launched at the same time -- ranging from the 
rehabilitation of badly substandard houses and trailers in grower-owned farm 
labor camps, to the construction of "self-help" homes for year-round workers 
for whom subsidized homeownership is feasible. These are the subjects of a 
working group of county and city representatives recently convened by Frazee. 
</P>
<P>
To find lasting solutions, it will take a united commitment by the county and 
cities. This is also an opportunity for agribusiness, nonprofit developers and 
local lending institutions to join in. 
</P>
<P>
If there is not a failure of will, solutions are possible.

REFLECTIONS: UNFORTUNATELY, A LOT OF COACHES DON'T KNOW A LEFT HOOK FROM A COAT 
HANGAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Jesse Valdez works the night shift at a local television station as a 
cameraman. His shift lasts until 11:30 p.m., but seven hours later Valdez is 
back at work, teaching "boxercise" to downtown executives and lawyers at an 
exclusive health club. After class, the 41-year-old former Olympic medalist 
goes back to his Lemon Grove home, where he and his wife tutor their two sons 
in "home school." Times staff writer Leslie Wolf interviewed Valdez at the San 
Diego Athletic Club, and Vince Compagnone photographed him. 
</P>
<P>
 Istarted boxing at the age of 11. Before that I was into gangs and stealing 
and just getting into trouble. I came from a family of seven, and grew up in 
the ghettos of Houston. It seemed like I was always beating everybody up. I 
wasn't the smartest kid in the world, but I had common sense. I knew I didn't 
like the situation I was in and it was wrong, so I decided to get out of it. 
</P>
<P>
I used to take the bus to the Boys' Club, and they always had gloves and a mat 
out. Eventually, I got into the Houston Golden Gloves, and I boxed a guy better 
than I was. He literally beat me to a pulp. That was the first and last time my 
mom ever saw me box. 
</P>
<P>
I started getting better, winning the regional Golden Gloves. In 1964, I went 
to the state tournament in Ft. Worth. I won at 15 years old. You had to be 16 
to compete, but I lied about my age. I went on to the Las Vegas national 
tournament at 16. In the final match in Vegas, I fought a medal-winner in the 
1960 Olympics, and not only did I beat him, I was voted the outstanding boxer 
of the whole tournament. It just took off from there. 
</P>
<P>
In 1967, I went on to win a berth at the Pan American Games in Winnipeg, 
Canada, where I won a bronze. In 1968, I tried out for the Olympics in Mexico 
City and won a berth in the trials but lost to a guy from San Diego. I was 
frustrated. I decided 1972 was going to be a do-or-die year, and that year I 
went on to the Olympics and won a bronze. 
</P>
<P>
As I was growing up, people were always saying, "Jesse, you got to go to school 
and get an education." In high school, I had a coach who got his college, 
Howard Payne College in Brownwood, Tex., to start a boxing team. Well, guess 
what? I got a boxing scholarship, and I was the whole boxing team. 
</P>
<P>
I left college there and went to Southwestern in Houston, where I started 
working for a civil courts judge. He was like a father to me. He arranged for 
me to be his bailiff, so I could go to school and study in his courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
After the Olympics, everybody wanted to help me out. The judge knew a news 
director in Texas, and they figured I was a hometown boy and would attract a 
large percentage of the Hispanic population. So they said, "Let's make a 
reporter out of him." 
</P>
<P>
Well, I was a reporter for six weeks. I didn't know a pencil from a pen. They 
gave me two weeks to learn the business, to learn what people have gone to 
college four years to learn. Not only that, I couldn't type. I started 
drinking, I couldn't control it. I started getting pretty bad. After six weeks, 
I said to the boss, "I don't like being a reporter." I was ready to quit, but 
they'd already invested some time and money in me, so they asked if I would try 
being a cameraman. So I got into camera work and learned the business. Channel 
10 picked me up in 1976, and I've been there ever since. 
</P>
<P>
I started teaching the boxercise classes about a year and a half ago. I started 
off with two or three people. As the days and weeks progressed, more people 
started coming in. Now, I have about 15 to 30 people in each class, mostly 
attorneys and corporate people. It's a good cardiovascular workout and a good 
stress reliever. This is a unique program -- it's basically geared for men, but 
I do have one woman in the class, and she hits harder than several of the men 
in the class. 
</P>
<P>
This all started as a whim. When I first started doing it, I didn't realize it 
was going to be as big as it is. The way I teach it, it's a non-contact sport 
-- the thrills and frills without the spills. I don't let anyone box against 
each other. I put on a head and body pad and let them punch on me. 
</P>
<P>
When I teach someone, they're going to learn properly. My executives look 
better than some professionals, as far as style. Unfortunately, a lot of 
coaches don't know a left hook from a coat hanger. They teach these young kids, 
and they get hurt. That's always been my gripe with professional boxing.

RED LIGHTS, FLASHING LIGHTS AND SIRENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since drinking and driving is legal (hot coffee that is!) plus smoking and 
listening to stereo, sirens are often not heard. Assuming that the driver is 
still looking at the road he can see red stop lights. How about mandatory, 
automatic red lights that go on at all nearest intersections when sirens and/or 
flashing red lights go on -- and mandatory use of sirens and/or flashing red 
lights to prevent more carnage in police chases, which should be outlawed (a 
very unlikely event).

MONORAIL IDEA MUST SURVIVE CIVIC MYOPIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When it comes to needed improvements at the county's John Wayne Airport, the 
city of Newport Beach suffers from a chronic case of municipal myopia. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the city gets so hung up with its obsession against airport growth it 
abandons sound and reasonable planning and pursues a hypocritical and 
shortsighted approach. The proposed monorail planned to run between the airport 
and two office buildings in Irvine near the edge of the airfield is a good case 
in point. 
</P>
<P>
The estimated $3.5-million monorail system being planned by the McDonnell 
Douglas Realty Co. proposes monorail service for about a half-mile from the 
office buildings at Douglas Plaza to the airport. But the system is designed so 
it can be expanded to serve other commercial and industrial areas and link them 
to the airport. 
</P>
<P>
It is an exciting proposition that, if built, would be the first privately 
constructed, owned and operated but publicly used monorail system in the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
But Newport Beach has filed an appeal to the initial approval given to the 
project last October by the County Board of Supervisors. City officials, in 
seeking to reopen hearings on the plan, are singing the same song they have 
sung for years every time an airport improvement is proposed: They fear that 
the project will mean additional airport growth. 
</P>
<P>
The city keeps raising that argument despite the fact that the airport growth 
issue was resolved more than 3 years ago -- in August of 1985, in a 20-year 
compromise agreement among city, county and community groups. 
</P>
<P>
That agreement, controlling airport noise and growth, sets a ceiling of 4.75 
million passengers a year at the county airport for the first 5 years and a 
maximum of 8.4 million passengers annually for the next 15 years. Those 
maximums are lower than the county's original plan. The new airport terminal 
now under construction was also scaled back to satisfy Newport Beach's fear of 
unbridled airport expansion. 
</P>
<P>
Why then should Newport Beach keep challenging improvement plans around the 
airport? 
</P>
<P>
The proposed McDonnell Douglas monorail system is designed not to increase the 
passenger load at John Wayne but to decrease the heavy traffic congestion in 
the airport area. The county board should reject Newport Beach's appeal and 
Irvine city officials who must still pass on the project should also reject 
Newport Beach's opposition and give the monorail enthusiastic approval. 
</P>
<P>
It makes good sense to seek ways to get passengers -- who will be using the 
terminal anyhow, within the annual maximums already agreed upon -- to the 
airport with as little traffic congestion as possible. The monorail is an 
innovative alternative, cost-free to the public, that should be pursued.

IDEAS TO UPGRADE RAIL SERVICE FROM LOS ANGELES TO SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The article by Carl H. Schiermeyer on upgrading the train service between Los 
Angeles and San Diego (Jan. 15) is too simplistic to merit serious 
consideration. Of course, if there were more trains probably people would ride 
them, but the observations proposed by the author contain several flaws, 
namely: 
</P>
<P>
* Doubling rail trackage is quite a different exercise than adding a freeway 
lane; the comparison cannot be made without a detailed engineering analysis and 
extensive cost estimates. 
</P>
<P>
* Doubling the track may be very difficult or very costly or virtually 
impossible in some areas, even if this is merely for "trains to cross." 
</P>
<P>
* "Because people like trains" is no reason, per se, to commit a very heavy 
financial investment in a rail-line upgrade. 
</P>
<P>
* Doubling trackage is not the only method of increasing capacity; many other 
equally viable components and systems are readily available in considering what 
best method to use, if it is deemed desirable. 
</P>
<P>
It would appear that Schiermeyer is in favor of more taxes, which he proposes 
should be allocated to rail -- another tax-and-spend advocate! However, the 
already heavily taxed public may not care to tax themselves further to pay for 
an upgraded rail service that only a small fraction of Orange County residents 
could or would use. 
</P>
<P>
Lest it be thought otherwise, I am in favor of rail transportation, provided 
that it is properly thought out on a systems and cost-effectiveness basis, and 
not on dubious superficial statistics. Let us not forget the demise of the 
"Bullet Train," which was so ineptly handled, showing us all how not to run a 
railroad.

THE HOMELESS AND GOVERNMENT SALARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On Jan. 8, nine members of the First Presbyterian Church in Anaheim assembled 
in the kitchen of the First Presbyterian Church in Fullerton at 5 a.m. to 
prepare breakfast for the 72 adults and six children who had taken refuge from 
the cold in the social hall of the church. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the high cost of housing in Orange County, many low-income residents 
are unable to earn enough to pay for the cost of housing, therefore, they have 
had to move to the streets or camp in their automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
In reference to the federal budget I find the federal pay raise and the 
increase in pensions for senior government officials extremely hard to 
understand, much less accept. How can the American people justify the high cost 
of salaries and pensions for our legislators when so many of our nation's 
people cannot afford housing?

IDEAS TO UPGRADE RAIL SERVICE FROM LOS ANGELES TO SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The time has come. The expense enormous. Moscow, Paris, Hong Kong, London, 
Tokyo, all have something Southern California lacks: an underground railroad. 
</P>
<P>
As an independent country, Southern California now ranks as the planet's 
eighth-largest economy, yet its transportation system is a mess. Further growth 
is reined in and choked by its infantile transport system. With 1992 ready to 
impact on the nation's economy, as a united Europe girds up to battle with 
Japan and the U.S.A. for economic supremacy, Orange County is left prostrate 
with a segmented polity unable to cope with the external world's changed 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
The railroads and interstates forged the American boom years; the waterways 
created a united California. If Southern California is to mature into its licit 
role as world economic leader, then a reformation of its transport is 
mandatory. 
</P>
<P>
Underground railroad tubes will be built in the Southland. Timing and finances 
are political decisions. The debate and routing of these corridors needs no 
delay. Southern California awaits the political leadership to steer the next 
economic boom of our privileged abode.

DEUKMEJIAN'S SUMMIT MEETING ON HIGHWAY FINANCING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What Gov. George Deukmejian has done is call a summit meeting of some 26 
persons to discuss a state gas tax and financing highway construction (Times, 
Jan. 23). While it's useful to involve leaders in such matters, the summit 
seems seriously twice flawed: appointees and the agenda itself. 
</P>
<P>
It's all right, I suppose, for Republicans to appoint Republicans, and 
Democrats, Democrats. (Especially when this promises a public good). But 
there's more to this summit than simply picking friends to run it. Or people of 
same politics, bad as that is. Master politicians are usually concerned with 
more than their image. They frequently look at the public good. Not this time, 
it appears. 
</P>
<P>
Here's where the summit fails. The agenda is antediluvian. The inevitable 
Orange County traffic reliever -- built now or later -- is of course mass 
transit, elevated rails. But here comes the governor muddling away. A summit 
with heads turned backwards, women and men muttering about financing highway 
construction. A flapping of tongues of people programmed to look only into the 
past; a wasteful, futile and certainly anachronistic exercise. Some might not 
agree. Like those eyeing profits from "new highway construction" (new freeways 
to serve new tract developments). 
</P>
<P>
The summit is further doomed, it seems. Look who Deukmejian invited to the 
summit from Orange County. Supervisor Thomas F. Riley. Despite his record for 
new freeways and more development, nothing wrong with that appointment. He's a 
county supervisor and chairman of the Orange County Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
But Deukmejian really tells us where he's coming from in the appointment of 
Irvine Co. Vice Chairman and arch-developer Thomas Nielson. Nielson comes 
representing the "Orange County Roundtable business organization." One whose 
legitimate objective, and job description, is to ensure that future residents 
of the Irvine Co.'s projected tract developments have access (roads) to their 
homes. (You can't sell houses if you can't get to them, can you?) Summit 
panelist Nielson a summit man? Yes. But a professional traffic planner? A 
financier? A tax expert? 
</P>
<P>
It's natural for a political party to crony up with fellows who think their 
way. And these summit gentlemen are certainly honorable people. And fit the 
litmus test. All Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
No. The fault lies with a governor of a great state who seemingly fails to rise 
above mean-spirited political counterproductive behavior in order to advance 
his own agenda, not the public good. He arranges an activity that not only 
seems to pander to cronies but ignores the potential values of a balanced 
panel. Where's the environmentalist? Or even, God love us, a Democrat? He 
apparently has structured the committee with those whose principal aim is 
transportation, not for itself but to serve new housing development.

2 CRITICALLY INJURED BY BLAST AT HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An explosion apparently caused by a gas leak destroyed a Pacific Beach 
apartment Saturday morning and critically injured two residents, a Fire 
Department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters responded to the two-story complex in the 900 block of Tourmaline 
Street shortly after 5 a.m. and found two residents lying in the front yard, 
Capt. Bob Landis said. 
</P>
<P>
The victims, Larry Harlin, age not given, and Deborah Arnaudo, 24, were taken 
to UC San Diego Medical Center, Landis said. Harlin suffered burns over 85% of 
his body, and Arnaudo suffered burns over almost 45% of her body. Both were in 
critical condition Saturday afternoon, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Fire investigators suspect that the explosion, which blew out a first floor 
wall, occurred when natural gas leaking in a bedroom closet was ignited by an 
open flame. 
</P>
<P>
The explosion caused $12,500 in damages, Landis said.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During 1988, 22-year-old jockey Chris Antley rode Private Terms to victory in 
the Wood Memorial, rode in his first Kentucky Derby, suffered a severe 
concussion in an accident at Belmont Park, lost a one-punch decision to William 
Fox Jr. in a fight at Aqueduct, rode in the Japan Cup in Tokyo and, on the last 
day of November, was suspended by the New York State Racing and Wagering Board 
for cocaine use. 
</P>
<P>
The highest and lowest points of Antley's boundlessly promising career, a 
career that seemed during most of 1988 to be tethered to a rollercoaster gone 
haywire, were separated only by months. 
</P>
<P>
His mounts won more than $7 million and his career total surpassed $30 million 
by the time Antley was suspended after his second positive test for cocaine. 
"We don't view this as punishment," his agent, Drew Mollica, had said while 
making arrangements for Antley to enter the Smithers Alchoholism and Treatment 
Center here. "This is a blessing." 
</P>
<P>
Having completed the in-patient phase of his treatment to the satisfaction of 
racing board officials, Antley has undertaken a heavy schedule. He rode six 
horses Wednesday at Aqueduct in New York. Mollica had him on nine Thursday, and 
Antley finally broke the ice aboard Slick Jack in the sixth race -- his first 
victory of 1989. He also won the ninth on True Royalty and is named on six 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Antley would not discuss his drug problem Thursday while rushing breathlessly 
from one race to prepare for the next. But his return has gone smoothly. The 
public, which tends to be harsh toward riders at New York tracks, has greeted 
him warmly. His riding services are in demand among trainers. "I'm riding every 
race. It just feels good to be back out there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Staying out there is now his primary objective. To that end, Antley's recovery 
continues in an aftercare program. He will be subject to frequent testing and 
has no margin for error. Another positive test will result in revocation of his 
license. 
</P>
<P>
"From what I've seen," said Dominick Bologna, who heads the racing board's drug 
abuse and testing programs, "Chris Antley will be in aftercare for a long, long 
time." 
</P>
<P>
Bologna is optimistic that Antley will conquer his drug problem now that he 
realizes he has one. "When they say 'cocaine lies,' what they mean is that 
cocaine lies to the user," Bologna said. "And it lies to the user more 
dangerously when he says, 'I don't have a problem. I can handle it myself.' 
That's the most dangerous lie. And the biggest lie of all prevents these 
individuals from seeking help. That's the power of the drug. Chris Antley 
suffered from that lie. He didn't think he had a problem. He thought he could 
handle it. Hopefully, now he realizes otherwise.

HORSE RACING'S MANFUSOS: FROM BACKSTRETCH TO THE FRONT OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINNIE PERRONE, The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Frank De Francis is the focus of most stories concerning Maryland's 
thoroughbred tracks. The president of Laurel and Pimlico is dynamic, innovative 
and his accessibility extends his visibility. 
</P>
<P>
But De Francis' behind-the-scenes associates -- headed by minority partners Bob 
and Tom Manfuso -- have played significant roles in patterning the resurgence 
of Maryland racing. 
</P>
<P>
"Our relationship is one of almost family," De Francis said. "They give me the 
benefit of their opinions and their views. We don't always agree. They don't 
pretend I'm always right, nor do they back away from every issue. But they give 
me the respect to make the decisions for this organization." 
</P>
<P>
John A. "Tom" Manfuso Jr. actually retired in 1979, when Burton Parsons 
Pharmaceutical, the company his father had purchased 31 years before, was sold 
for more than $100 million. Tom, who had served as the company's vice 
president-general manager, headed south to enact major decisions regarding 
golf-club selection on Florida's fairways. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Manfuso, who had been Burton Parsons' marketing and sales director, turned 
his attention to a product that had fascinated him and brother Tom since their 
childhood days in Chevy Chase, Md. -- the Maryland thoroughbred. Bob owned and 
bred them, and late in 1984 he was elected president of the Horsemen's 
Benevolent and Protective Association. 
</P>
<P>
Bob's tenure lasted only 10 days. He resigned in early December to purchase 
Laurel Race Course with De Francis and brother Tom, who had grown weary of 
abundant leisure. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after the purchase of Laurel -- a few days before Christmas 1984 -- the 
doorbell rang at Tom Manfuso's Chevy Chase home at about 2 a.m. Outside stood a 
policeman and a minister who told the Manfusos that their 21-year-old son, 
Thomas Allen Manfuso, had been killed in a car accident. 
</P>
<P>
Tom, still pierced by the loss, spoke little of the incident. "You never 
recover. You just learn to handle it better," he said. "When you have something 
like that happen, the best therapy is to get busy and stay active. The purchase 
of Laurel was a godsend for me, something I could throw myself into." 
</P>
<P>
The Maryland racing industry was in need of such attention. Attendance and 
handle were stagnant and the state's takeout was high, stifling purse growth. 
Horsemen defected and fans lost interest, the esthetics of Bowie, Laurel and 
Pimlico reflecting the industry's paralyzed state. 
</P>
<P>
"I loved horses, I loved the racing, I loved the backstretch," Bob Manfuso 
said. "I knew that Maryland racing was in trouble, and I knew that we were 
rapidly deteriorating to a very mediocre product in terms of the sport. It 
became very clear to me that someone was going to have to buy one of these mile 
race tracks if Maryland were ever to move forward." 
</P>
<P>
Vice president-executive secretary of Laurel and Pimlico, Bob Manfuso is in 
charge of the tracks' racing operations, determining the overall quality of the 
racing stock and structuring stakes programs. The industry's improved health in 
recent years has brought added challenge to Manfuso's job; fattened purses have 
enticed out-of-state horsemen, placing a premium on stall space. 
</P>
<P>
As vice president-secretary, Tom Manfuso is responsible for the physical plant, 
its modifications and maintenance. He is overseeing construction of Pimlico's 
Sports Palace, scheduled for completion before the track reopens in March, and 
has been negotiating with harness-track owner Mark Vogel regarding 
Laurel-Pimlico simulcasts to Delmarva Downs, the harness track near Ocean City, 
Md. 
</P>
<P>
Bob and Tom Manfuso look nothing alike. Tom, eight years older at age 59, is 
taller, broader, darker complexioned. He scarcely moves his lips when he speaks 
in raspy baritone, and he wears conservative business suits and eyeglasses that 
get darker in sunlight. Bob dons tweed and khaki and maybe an argyle sweater. 
His hair is curlier and much lighter than Tom's, his features finer. His voice 
is deep and clear. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Manfuso had gotten to know De Francis by helping him syndicate the stallion 
Hail Emperor, and he approached De Francis about the possible purchase of 
Laurel. De Francis, who had revived the troubled Freestate Raceway, said he 
would be interested, providing he gain controlling interest. The deal was made, 
although De Francis did not actively participate in direct negotiations. He 
resigned as Maryland secretary of economic and community development, and one 
of racing's most daring, imaginative and profitable management teams was 
assembled. 
</P>
<P>
Until then, track ownership had been the only aspect of thoroughbred racing 
untouched by the Manfuso family. John Manfuso Sr. began breeding and racing 
horses in the 1930s, and he would take his sons to the track to watch morning 
workouts and the mechanics of the backstretch. Exposure to afternoon races 
would come much later. 
</P>
<P>
"He was funny that way," Bob said of his father. "The morning was one thing. I 
remember vividly Thanksgiving and Christmas in those days, when he used to buy 
full-dressed hogs and give them to whoever was training for him, the 
backstretch help, and we always went with him as a traditional kind of thing. 
But you never went to the races with him in the afternoon. I think I snuck out 
a couple of times on my own, but you didn't come with him until you were 14 or 
15." 
</P>
<P>
"The tough part about it was that we'd had exposure to the horses he'd bred, 
and the exciting times in the morning when they'd work," said Tom. "Obviously, 
you'd like to see what they could do in the afternoon. It was a natural 
curiosity for a kid to have." 
</P>
<P>
Tom carefully followed the career of Aneroid, a sore-legged yearling his father 
bought at an auction in Upperville, Va., and who later defeated the renowned 
Seabiscuit. 
</P>
<P>
As Tom entered Landon School in Bethesda, Md., his interests shifted toward 
team sports, but young Bob soon began tagging along with his father. "Bobby, as 
far as horses were concerned, had a more acute interest than Tommy," John 
Manfuso Sr. said. "As Tommy got older, suddenly it was football, tennis, 
basketball." 
</P>
<P>
Tom was an all-New England tackle at Bowdoin College, where during his junior 
year he determined his career objective. "We were playing Williams, and my dad 
called and said he'd like to see me in New York after the game," Tom said. "He 
told me he was considering purchasing a pharmaceutical company, and would I be 
interested in participating. I told him that excited me, and I was very anxious 
to go in with him." 
</P>
<P>
He began after serving two years in the Korean War. Bob joined the family 
operation after graduating from Princeton. 
</P>
<P>
The growth of his business did not limit John Manfuso Sr.'s outside interests. 
"Even then," son Tom said, "he devoted a tremendous amount of time to the 
horsemen's association." 
</P>
<P>
John Manfuso Sr. was a longtime national president of the HBPA. Always a 
horsemen's advocate, he remained a backstretch sentry of sorts even after his 
sons and De Francis purchased Laurel, then Bowie and Pimlico. 
</P>
<P>
"I won't hesitate to criticize them on the race track, particularly about the 
backstretch part of things," John, 85, said. "But they haven't given me too 
much to squawk about." 
</P>
<P>
Tom and Bob Manfuso said they consider themselves horsemen first and foremost. 
With George and Jeff Huguely they established Fourbros Stables in 1974. 
Investing $2,500 apiece, they bought a 2-year-old filly named Crackerfax for 
$8,000 and a yearling for $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
"What intrigued me about (Crackerfax) at the time was that my father stood Salt 
Spray, and Crackerfax's dam had produced a couple of very solid runners," Bob 
Manfuso said. "I was prejudiced, but I thought Salt Spray had the touch for 
being a very useful stud." 
</P>
<P>
The stable quickly prospered. Crackerfax went on to win two stakes races and 
$129,019, and two years later Fourbros struck again. They paid $14,500 for a 
yearling son of Tentam at a Timonium sale. 
</P>
<P>
The colt was Shelter Half, a multiple stakes winner who earned $236,337 before 
retiring in 1980. He was syndicated and stands at Glade Valley Farm in 
Frederick, Md., Fourbros retaining 10 stallion shares. 
</P>
<P>
Then emerged Green Book, who rose to prominence as a 3 year old in 1987 and 
became Fourbros' most recent stakes winner. As Green Book was preparing to 
return to the races last spring, he developed a slab fracture and was sidelined 
for the year. He's back in training now and is expected to soon resume his 
career at age 5. 
</P>
<P>
Bob and Tom Manfuso also have racing and breeding interests separate from 
Fourbros. Their partnership with Frank De Francis -- himself a thoroughbred 
owner and breeder -- thus created a management team well versed as to the 
interests and concerns of horsemen.

KNICKS LOOK LIKE TITLE CONTENDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY SULLIVAN, Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All you had to do was look at their faces. Watching the New York Knicks' 
players and coaches as they walked off the Forum floor Tuesday night, you saw 
young faces enlightened by possibility, and by the knowledge that they can win 
anytime, anywhere and under any circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
They had just become the first team to beat the Lakers at the Forum this 
season, and they had done it by coming from behind in the fourth quarter, just 
as they had two nights before in an equally uplifting victory in Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly those were not the faces of players who believe their team is one 
season, or one player, away from being contenders. Coach Rick Pitino can dodge 
the question all he likes, but by winning back-to-back games in two of the 
league's most difficult arenas, the Knicks proved once and for all that they're 
a legitimate contender for an NBA championship. 
</P>
<P>
One distinguishing quality of all of Pitino's teams is that they are stronger 
in the second half -- in the second half of games and seasons. Well-conditioned 
by half a season of running and pressing, his Providence teams improved 
dramatically in the latter days of winter. Last year's Knicks were 14-28 at one 
point, a .600 team thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
There is no reason to believe they can't do better than 27-14 the rest of the 
way. The worst part of the schedule is behind them. When their current trip is 
finished, they don't have to go to the West Coast again. Of their final 39 
games, 23 will be at Madison Square Garden, where they're 17-1. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, they have their shortcomings. Aside from Patrick Ewing, there's no 
reliable post-up scorer. They're overly reliant on the three-point shot. They 
give up too many easy baskets off their press (in five games on the Western 
trip, opponents shot 54.7 percent from the floor). 
</P>
<P>
But the bottom line is, they know how to win. Even more important, they now 
expect to win the big games. 
</P>
<P>
The half-ourt defense is getting better all the time, largely because opponents 
are leg-weary at the end of games. They held Detroit to 16 points in the fourth 
quarter in their Jan. 11 road win. The Lakers scored 18 points in the fourth 
quarter Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
They are a flawed team, but the league has become a collection of flawed 
contenders. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Barry says he isn't a betting man, but if he were, he would be willing to 
wager that his old friend Larry Brown won't make it to the end of his five-year 
contract as head coach of the Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see how he's going to make it through this contract," said Barry, who 
roomed with Brown during their playing days in the American Basketball 
Association. "He really needs to be in college. You get to the pros and you 
can't treat players the same way. You can't have that same kind of control." 
</P>
<P>
Brown's return to the pro game has, to be sure, been a trying one. His Spurs 
finished Wednesday night's game against Utah with an 11-28 record, and he 
almost surely will experience the first losing season of his 17-year coaching 
career. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, there is an uneasy feeling around San Antonio these days. Brown 
hasn't been able to communicate his system to the players. Players are sniping 
at one another. And team management sat down with the coaches recently and 
decided that major changes might be needed. 
</P>
<P>
Observers in San Antonio also are coming to the slow realization that David 
Robinson's arrival next season isn't likely to have an immediate impact, and 
Brown might have to endure several losing seasons before his fortunes turn 
around. 
</P>
<P>
"See, I don't know if Larry can ever be happy," said Barry, who does NBA color 
commentary for TBS. "Anyone who knows him feels the same way. Nothing ever 
seems to be just right. No matter what it is, something's wrong." 
</P>
<P>
During a recent radio call-in show in Philadelphia, Charles Barkley took a few 
long-distance cheap shots at the Atlanta Hawks. 
</P>
<P>
"The Hawks won't win because the NBA will not allow you to play with more than 
one basketball," Barkley said. "They've got five great players who are not 
willing to sacrifice. The Hawks are the most selfish team in the NBA. You can 
have too much talent. That's one of their problems." 
</P>
<P>
After Barkley's remarks appeared in an Atlanta newspaper, Coach Mike Fratello 
brought the paper to practice and stomped on it in front of his players. Even 
the usually taciturn Moses Malone, no doubt one of Barkley's targets, was moved 
to comment. 
</P>
<P>
"(The 76ers) have the five most selfish guys in the league in one guy," Malone 
said. Suffice it to say he was not referring to Scott Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
In case you're wondering, the 76ers and Hawks don't meet again in the regular 
season. Do you suppose Prince Charles was aware of that when he decided to run 
his mouth? 
</P>
<P>
Is Chuck Daly sending a message to Trader Jack McCloskey? Detroit's coach was 
bemoaning his team's lack of inside scoring early this week and suggested it 
might be time for his general manager to find help. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we need another player," said Daly, "an offensive player, a big guard, 
or someone who can post up down there. We're still fighting the problem of no 
post-up guy. We're the only team in the league without one. (Adrian) Dantley is 
not a true post-up player." 
</P>
<P>
Notes 
</P>
<P>
Golden State's Ralph Sampson, who has missed 13 games after undergoing 
arthroscopic surgery on his left knee, is expected to rejoin the Warriors 
Friday in Philadelphia. The Warriors, who were 10-14 when Sampson left, are 
10-4 without him. But anyone who claims the Warriors are better off without him 
is mistaken. ... Amid all the talk about Portland's off-court woes, no one 
bothers to mention one of the team's main on-court problems: One-dimensional 
center Kevin Duckworth might be the most overrated player in the league. All he 
can do is score. ... The 76ers' Mike Gminski will be an unrestricted free agent 
after this season, and he expects to command a salary in the $1.5 million to $2 
million range. The Lakers, who will have $1.5 million to play with when Kareem 
Abdul-Jabbar retires, are said to be interested. 
</P>
<P>
Denver, which won 54 games last season, has lost 13 of 18, dropping to ninth in 
the West at 20-20. After scoring at a record 128.7-point pace in their first 20 
games, the Nuggets have averaged 113.2 since. They've been hampered by minor 
injuries, but assistant coach Allan Bristow says that's not the problem. "We're 
just going through a spell where our confidence is down," he said. "The players 
we're going to win with are suited up. It's just that we're not clicking." ... 
The Celtics, desperate for backup help behind Robert Parish and Kevin McHale, 
are reportedly looking to deal for 6-10 Utah rookie Jose Ortiz. ... The NBA has 
received an application for reinstatement from Mitchell Wiggins, the former 
Rocket who received a lifetime ban for drug use two years ago.

DICK VERSACE; 
</P>
<P>
PACERS HAVE A RENAISSANCE MAN AS THEIR LATEST COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN GOLDSTEIN, The Baltimore Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He majored in American literature, with an emphasis on Poe and Hemingway. 
</P>
<P>
He lived in Paris, London, and Frankfurt, West Germany, and once considered 
becoming an expatriate and arguing philosophy and art in sidewalk cafes. 
</P>
<P>
His mother wrote "The Flying Nun." He talks in pictures and of his team's need 
for a "symbiotic relationship" and using "collective force" against an 
opponent. 
</P>
<P>
He coached championship teams in basketball and football, the latter at 
Strawn-Wing High in Forrest, Wis., the town that bills itself as "The Egg 
Capital of America, and that's no Yoke." He once screamed on a Chicago street 
corner, "I'm going to coach one day in the NBA!" 
</P>
<P>
Who is this man for all seasons? It's Dick Versace, the head coach of the 
Indiana Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago, Versace inherited a team of classic underachievers with a 6-23 
record that had worn out two coaches -- Jack Ramsay and George Irvine. But 
Versace, who served as an assistant to Chuck Daly in Detroit the last three 
seasons, was considered the perfect man to breathe new life into the Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana General Manager Donnie Walsh, who interviewed several candidates, said, 
"They were all very astute and technically knowledgeable, but we need life and 
intensity for this team, and I really believe Versace can turn it around." 
</P>
<P>
But even Walsh had to be stunned when Versace, 48, reeled off victories over 
the Los Angeles Clippers and the Pistons at home and beat the Boston Celtics at 
Boston Garden. 
</P>
<P>
More than anything, Versace has restored a sense of pride and a commitment to 
winning. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very difficult to take over a team in the middle of a season and expect 
positive results. A lot of these guys had severely bruised psyches," Versace 
said from his hotel suite near Market Arena in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
"What it amounts to is my conducting a training camp on the fly. I'm seeing if 
we can get a little wedding of ideas, a little marriage going between me and 
the players." 
</P>
<P>
Versace has stressed transition defense, unselfishness and a willingness to 
play hard even when the scoreboard says the game is hopelessly lost. 
</P>
<P>
"In Detroit, we called it 'taking it out,' meaning playing down to the final 
buzzer no matter what. You run plays, execute and call timeouts just like it's 
a two-point game. It makes you think like a winner. 
</P>
<P>
"It finally got through to them in a game we were losing in Miami, 116-111. The 
Heat started missing free throws and we tied it with a pair of three-point 
shots and wound up playing two overtimes. With a second left, we got a 
wide-open dunk and blew it, but it convinced the guys nothing is impossible." 
</P>
<P>
With a young roster, Versace, who turned a losing program at Bradley University 
into a team that posted a 156-88 record in his eight seasons, says it is not 
unreasonable to expect the Pacers to enjoy the same upward mobility as the 
Cleveland Cavaliers, who, in less than three years, developed from perennial 
losers into legitimate title contenders. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm no fool," he said, "but I believe there are a number of talented players 
on this team. We might need a changing of the guards, but in players like Chuck 
Person, Reggie Miller, Rik Smits, Herb Williams and Wayman Tisdale, there is 
definitely the nucleus for a winning team, given some luck in the draft or 
lottery." 
</P>
<P>
As a guideline for the future, Versace cites the traditional National 
Basketball Association powers. 
</P>
<P>
"The teams thatwin consistently," he said, "are the ones that have players 
you're forced to double-team. 
</P>
<P>
"When Kareem (Abdul-Jabbar) was younger, the Lakers had three guys in him, 
(James) Worthy and Magic Johnson. Boston had Larry Bird, Kevin McHale and 
Robert Parish. Atlanta has a couple of guys in Dominique Wilkins and Moses 
Malone, and the Pistons had Isiah Thomas and Adrian Dantley. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we might have three of those types in Person, Tisdale and Williams. 
They're a solid building block, but it's a matter of accentuating the positive 
and bringing out the best in each of them. But first we have to put away all 
the hidden agendas and selfishness that creeps into every team." 
</P>
<P>
The thrill of victory is what steered Versace into coaching after he had 
considered several other careers. 
</P>
<P>
"I was going to be a research scientist in plant pathology," he said, "but I 
was too much of an extrovert to sequester myself in a greenhouse researching 
corn rust." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he accepted the challenge of coaching the Edgewood (Wis.) High 
football team and posted a 7-0 record. He was then asked to help Dave Brown 
coach the school's basketball team, and his life changed. 
</P>
<P>
"Brown had the most inventive, creative mind I've ever known, way ahead of his 
time," Versace told the Indianapolis News. "The team won 56 games over two 
years, and I was hooked on basketball, winning, the whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
But Versace also has a sense of perspective. "I always looked at coaching as a 
business," he said. "I believe a coaching career is like a businessman's graph. 
It's going to have some highs, lows and even periods. That's the way it's going 
to be and that's the way I'm going to approach it."

Steve Rosenbloom, 44, sits at his home in New Orleans, talking on the phone 
with an old sportswriter friend from his Baltimore days. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Rosenbloom is by no means an unhappy man. 
</P>
<P>
He has a 2-year-old son, Jonathan, by his second wife, a New Orleans woman, 
with whom he is happy. His sons, 10 and 14, from his first marriage live nearby 
with their mother. He sees them "all the time." 
</P>
<P>
A Georgetown University graduate, Rosenbloom has been involved in real estate 
since he was fired by the New Orleans Saints. 
</P>
<P>
"We did some residential things," he says, "but New Orleans has a depressed 
economy because of the energy business. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody has any money right now so nobody's buying anything. We're sort of 
landlords at this point." 
</P>
<P>
As a young man, Steve Rosenbloom did not dream it would be like this when he 
reached middle age. 
</P>
<P>
He thought he'd be the owner and operator of the Baltimore Colts, the team his 
father, Carroll, owned during its glory years. 
</P>
<P>
But Carroll Rosenbloom traded the Colts for the Los Angeles Rams and, a few 
years afterward, he drowned in the surf off his home in the Golden Beach 
section of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Steve's stepmother, Georgia Frontiere, inherited 70 percent of the Rams. Steve 
and his brother and sister sold off their share. Before long, Georgia fired 
Steve from his front office job. 
</P>
<P>
There are people in Baltimore who remember that Carroll Rosenbloom ran a very 
successful franchise for a number of years, and that Steve was being groomed to 
succeed him. Some wonder if Steve would come back to Baltimore as owner of a 
new NFL team, should Baltimore get one. 
</P>
<P>
"Six or seven years ago," Steve says, "I did put a group together that would 
have owned an expansion team in another city. Ironically, it was Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
"We dealt with Mayor Hudnut, who is very progressive the way Mayor Schaefer was 
in Baltimore, and we thought we'd get the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
"As it turned out, Indianapolis didn't have to wait for an expansion team. Bob 
Irsay moved the Colts there." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Rosenbloom is as uneasy with the mere mention of Irsay as most 
Baltimoreans are. 
</P>
<P>
"If Baltimore people are angry about what Irsay did there, they should blame 
Joe Thomas," Steve says. "Joe was out of a job. He went out and found Irsay and 
brought him to Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
"My dad didn't know Irsay. He sure didn't know what a jerk the guy was. 
</P>
<P>
"Things moved so fast at the end when the franchises were traded. Dad got tired 
of being hit over the head in Baltimore by people who were angry because he 
wanted to put the exhibition games on the season-ticket package, by people who 
were always asking what was wrong with the Colts when they were 10-6. Finally 
he said, 'I'm out of here.' 
</P>
<P>
"Irsay has always been an embarrassment to me when I see what the city got 
after we left. Irsay single-handedly made more Oriole fans than anybody thought 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
"Irsay messed up Baltimore and now he's making a toilet out of Indianapolis, 
which is a shame. I like Indianapolis. I like Mayor Hudnut. There are a lot of 
nice people out there." 
</P>
<P>
Since the time when Steve was visiting Indianapolis, advising the people there 
how to get a franchise, his interest in pro football has waned. 
</P>
<P>
"The game has changed so much," he says. "The new breed of owners is greedy. 
The old guard knew something about pro football. At least they cared about the 
game. All the new owners care about is money. 
</P>
<P>
"The time has come to give the teams back to the cities, back to the fans. The 
new owners don't know how these franchises became successful in the first 
place. 
</P>
<P>
"With us in Baltimore, it was a partnership. We related to the fans. We had the 
Colt Corrals. Everybody was involved. Everybody lived it. There was a closeness 
that's gone now. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that made the NFL stable all those years was that while baseball and 
basketball were moving franchises around, no NFL franchise was moved from the 
time the Cardinals moved from Chicago to St. Louis in 1960 until Al Davis took 
the Raiders to Los Angeles. Now it's a this-is-your-team-for-a-week kind of 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
As for Baltimore, Rosenbloom says: "I'm glad I was in it in Baltimore when it 
was fun. It may be better to have the memories than to be in it the way it is 
now."

CHAPMAN CRUSHES HAPLESS CAL STATE LOS ANGELES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the first time in more than a month, the Chapman College men's basketball 
team won consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
But it was not a major accomplishment because the Panthers were playing Cal 
State Los Angeles Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman's 93-68 victory in front of 450 at the Hutton Sports Center came 
against an Eagle team that has won just 2 of its last 36 games. 
</P>
<P>
It was also Los Angeles' 20th consecutive loss in California Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. play. 
</P>
<P>
"There are certain teams in this conference that you have to beat twice," 
Chapman Coach Rich Prospero said. 
</P>
<P>
Needless to say, the Eagles are one of those teams. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman (10-8 overall, 3-2 in conference play) wasted little time showing Los 
Angeles who was boss. 
</P>
<P>
Leading, 11-8, with 11 minutes left in the half, Chapman went on a 25-2 run to 
take a 36-10 lead. During one 7-minute stretch, the Panthers held the Eagles 
scoreless, outscoring them 18-0. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman led at halftime, 44-14. Los Angeles (2-16, 0-5) made just seven field 
goals in the first half and shot just 27%. 
</P>
<P>
And all but one of the Eagles' field goals came on layups. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the guys at halftime that this was not winning ugly," Prospero said. "I 
mean, when we stopped playing, we were ahead by 35 points. Almost everything we 
did up until that point, we did well." 
</P>
<P>
What Chapman did best was rebound, as it held a 27-12 advantage at halftime and 
outrebounded the Eagles, 48-36, for the game. 
</P>
<P>
Leading the way was 6-foot 4-inch bald-headed Rog Middleton and -- surprise -- 
6-0 point guard Dean Balcao, both of whom had 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Middleton, who had 10 points, is the team's leading rebounder, so his 
performance was par for the course. But Balcao, who also had a team-high 18 
points, came into the game averaging only 2.8 rebounds per game. He had 8 in 
the first half. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Rog is having an effect on all of us," Prospero said. "Dean is 
starting to grunt like Rog when he gets a rebound. I guess next he'll be 
shaving his head." 
</P>
<P>
The Panthers consistently got second- and third-shot opportunities with their 
offensive rebounds. Thus, Chapman scored all but 4 of its baskets in the second 
half on the inside. 
</P>
<P>
Russ Ortega scored 14 points and Kevin Stafford 13 for the Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
"I've already told the guys to start thinking about (Cal Poly) San Luis 
Obispo," Propsero said. "This one is over." 
</P>
<P>
Almost from the start.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Devon Koster, a 6-foot 2-inch center, scored 20 points and had 15 rebounds to

League upset of Valley Christian Saturday night at Orange Lutheran. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first Olympic League loss for Valley Christian since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Lutheran was held scoreless in the third quarter, and trailed, 31-21, 
going into the fourth. But the Lancers (10-16 overall, 6-4 in league play) 
outscored Valley Christian, 20-4, in the final quarter for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer Zylstra had 13 points for Valley Christian (9-1 in league play). 
</P>

home. Julie Ann Johnston scored a game-high 22 points, including 5 3-pointers, 
for Westminster (2-15, 0-6). 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley 45, Ocean View 40 -- With the victory, Coach Carol Strausburg

EL CAMINO HOLDS OFF PESKY PASADENA, 74-71 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The last time El Camino played Pasadena, Warrior forward Zlatco Josic had a bad 
foot. Coach Ron McClurkin said shortly before that game that his team wouldn't 
have bothered making the trip for the South Coast Conference opener if Josic 
couldn't play. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Josic, the Warriors' second-leading scorer, missed the first half 
because he had the flu, but the 6-foot-5 sophomore sealed the Warriors' 74-71 
victory over Pasadena with a pair of free throws and ended the night with eight 
points. 
</P>
<P>
The victory secured first place for El Camino (19-6, 4-1) in the SCC and kept 
Pasadena (15-5, 3-2) in second. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the most important win ever," said an emotional Josic after the game. 
"God, we knew we had to win this one." 
</P>
<P>
With 37 seconds left in the game, El Camino trailed 70-71. Then Van Myers stole 
the ball and passed it to Kevin Mixon, who drove the lane for a layup. That 
made the score 72-71 in favor of El Camino. 
</P>
<P>
Then, with eight seconds left, Josic went to the line and sank both free 
throws. 
</P>
<P>
"We're back in first place now," McClurkin said, "and fortunately we don't have 
to see those guys again." 
</P>
<P>
The first time the two clubs met this season, El Camino walked away with a 
12-point vicotry. But this time an eager and determined Pasadena team was not 
about to let that happen. 
</P>
<P>
Neither team dominated the first half. The Warriors scored seven unanswered 
points in less than a minute but couldn't hold on to the lead. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena tied the game with 3:44 left in the half when Jeff Samuel grabbed his 
own rebound and converted it into two points. The Lancers trailed by only one 
at the break, 39-38. 
</P>
<P>
So the Warriors' earlier run, which put them up, 22-16, with 9:26 remaining in 
the half, didn't do much lasting good. The streak started with David Keeter's 
jump shot, followed by Kelvin Harris' breakaway dunk and Keeter's 3-point shot. 
</P>
<P>
Keeter, a 6-foot-4 freshman forward, led the Warriors with 21 points and Myers 
added 13. Mixon, the team's leading scorer, was limited to eight points. 
</P>
<P>
The No. 9 Warriors, who have lost their only SCC game to Long Beach, will 
travel to Mt.San Antonio College on Wednesday.

TOROS CHALLENGE FOR TOP SPOT BY BEATING NORTHRIDGE, 54-51 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL McLEOD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All season long, Cal State Dominguez Hills Coach Dave Yanai has said that the 
key to the Toro offense has been the Toro defense. 
</P>
<P>
At no time that more clear than Saturday night against visiting Cal State 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
For the second straight California Collegiate Athletic Assn. game, Dominguez 
Hills shot less than 36 percent from the field, but thanks to its stifling 
defense, the school no one even considered a contender when the year began is 
now poised to challenge for the top spot in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
Its 54-51 victory Saturday night upped Dominguez Hills' record to 4-1 in the 
conference (12-6 overall). It was the team's seventh win in its last eight 
starts, giving it impetus for next week's road trip to Bakersfield and San Luis 
Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside, which beat the Toros, 59-58, 10 days ago, is 5-0 in the conference, 
but its victory over Bakersfield on Saturday night handed second place solely 
to the Toros. 
</P>
<P>
The victory Saturday night was the fifth consecutive time Dominguez Hills has 
held its opponent shy of 60 points. And the team needed every bit of that 
defense to help its offense get through another major slump. 
</P>
<P>
"We had been shooting so well lately, even our three-point shots, I guess the 
kids are coming back down to earth," Yanai said. 
</P>
<P>
The coach said he sensed that his team was tiring, not getting the elevation on 
shots that he would like, in Thursday's 55-52 double-overtime win at Cal State 
Los Angeles. So he shortened practice Friday, and the team took more shooting 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
That didn't seem to help much Saturday -- a thought Yanai says he will work on. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess we've got to freshen up our legs a bit," he said. "Normally we shoot 
well here." 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Shaw, once a reserve who has worked his way up to a starting role, keyed 
the Toro defense late in the game. His steal and basket with 4:50 left gave 
Dominguez Hills the lead for good, 52-51. Yanai called it the play of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"Some guys have so much talent and they don't do so much with it, and then you 
see Kevin out there surface like that, get the most out of his God-given 
ability, and it is just . . . so great," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the first half, the Toros hit just seven of 22 shots. Anthony Blackmon led 
the way: The 6-foot, 7-inch senior made just two of 10 attempts. 
</P>
<P>
But Northridge fared little better. Without starter Todd Bowser, who is 
injured, the Matadors looked confused offensively. They missed their first 
seven field goal attempts, including a pair of lay-ups. 
</P>
<P>
Derrick Gathers, brother of Loyola Marymount star Hank Gathers, broke the 
drought with a three-point shot, but not before 9 1/2 minutes of the first half 
was gone. 
</P>
<P>
In that time, Dominguez Hills countered by hitting only two of 11 field goals. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Toros marched to a 9-0 lead with 14:53 left in the half on baskets 
by Segaro Bozart, Robert Barksdale and Blackmon. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers followed his three-point shot with a two-point bucket off a steal and 
assist from guard Darren Matsubara that tied the game at 9 with 9:43 left. 
Thirty seconds later, forward Sandy Brown gave the Matadors their first lead, 
11-9, when he two free throws. In fact, Northridge utilized the foul-shot bonus 
to make nine of 10 one-and-one attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Fouls have played a part in Dominguez Hills' recent offensive struggles. 
Thursday night at Cal State Los Angeles, it was Blackmon who got into foul 
trouble early. Saturday night it was Derrick Clark's turn. The senior guard 
from Detroit picked up his third foul with only 4:23 gone in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Another factor seemed to be the Toros' inability read the changing defenses 
used by Northridge. Without Bowser, it figured that Northridge would surrender 
some of the advantage it might have had in the low post. But Dominguez Hills 
found it difficult in the first 10 minutes of the game to get the ball inside. 
</P>
<P>
Yanai realized the problems, however, and shouted to the Toros to "go inside, 
fellows." Moments later, Dominguez Hills did just that: Barksdale made a nice 
pass to Dell'Amico for a lay-in. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to get inside, tried to get something off the break," Yanai said. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Hills grabbed the lead for only the second time on a basket by Clark 
off a pass from Barksdale with a minute gone in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
But back came Northridge. A pair of baskets by Alan Fraser, a three-pointer by 
Gathers and a basket by Jemarl Baker made it 36-31 with under 15 minutes to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
Clark followed with a basket for the Toros, but Gathers retaliated for two at 
13:40. 
</P>
<P>
Blackmon led the Toros back. He scored five points in the next 2 1/2 minutes. A 
basket by Dell'Amico knotted the score at 41, and then Dominguez Hills ran off 
five unanswered points to take a 46-41 advantage with 8:26 to go. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge countered with eight straight points of its own in the next three 
minutes to regain the lead. Matsubara missed a three-point attempt from the top 
with 2:29, Blackmon rebounded and Yanai signaled quickly for a time-out. 
</P>
<P>
The Toros spread the offense out, but Blackmon missed a 6-foot jumper with 2 
minutes left. Clark grabbed the rebound, attempted to force a shot and, 
surrounded by three Matadors, pushed the ball off to Bozart. Barksdale ran the 
shot clock down to six seconds, then misfired from inside the three-point line 
and the Matadors grabbed the rebound. 
</P>
<P>
Seconds later, the Toros had the ball back. As Gathers crossed halfcourt, 
Dell'Amico sneaked up from behind and knocked the ball to Barksdale. Dominguez 
ran the clock down to 44 seconds left in the game and called time out. 
</P>
<P>
Blackmon missed a 17-footer from the right corner, however, with 29 seconds to 
go and Fraser rebounded. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge called time out, but on the ensuing in-bounds Fraser could not get 
the ball in and the Matadors were forced to call a time-out. This time Becker 
tried to in-bound the ball. When he couldn't find someone to get the ball to, 
he attempted to call another time-out, but he ran out of time and Dominguez 
Hills was in control. Barksdale added a driving lay-up with 20 seconds to go to 
make the score 54-51. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers got off a three-point shot with 7 seconds left, but it bounced high off 
the rim and both Blackmon and Fraser came down with the ball with the 
possession arrow in favor of the Toros. 
</P>
<P>
Barksdale added two free throws with three seconds left. 
</P>

OCCIDENTAL ENDS SKID WITH WIN OVER WHITTIER 
</P>

Before the referees arrived at the Occidental College gym Saturday night, the 
Whittier basketball team performed an impromptu -- and illegal -- slam-dunk 
session while Occidental players stretched under their goal. 
</P>
<P>
When the game started, however, it was the Tigers who were impressive. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental (12-5 overall, 2-2 in conference play), riding a 2-game losing 
streak that had dropped it to the basement of the Southern California 
Intercollegiate Athletic Conference standings, regained much of the intensity 
it had lost over the past few weeks and turned back Whitter, 92-76, at 
Occidental. 
</P>
<P>
"We went back to the way we were playing," said center Chris Anderson, who 
scored 21 points, had 3 blocks and a thunderous double-fisted jam in the first 
half. "We had good motion and we didn't try to force it inside." 
</P>
<P>
As for the Poets' pregame theatrics? 
</P>
<P>
"Why show off?" Anderson said. "In the game is where it counts." 
</P>
<P>
The biggest contribution might have been the backcourt pressure of guards Ethan 
Caldwell, Jason Greenstein and Jay Caba. The trio stole the ball from 
Whittier's guards several times for easy layups. 
</P>
<P>
The Poets (8-11, 1-3) committed 17 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
"It really bothered us," Whittier Coach Dave Jacobs said of the pressure. 
"Every mistake we made, Oxy scored on. It was a double crucifixion." 
</P>
<P>
Occidental Coach Brian Newhall said that he enjoyed the game's upbeat tempo. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to start playing 10 people," he said. "We'll keep rotating -- 
pulling them out, putting them in -- those little breaks really help." 
</P>
<P>
Forward John Keister led Occidental with a game-high 25 points. Keister said 
that the Tigers had better luck trying to exploit Whittier's lack of speed. 
</P>
<P>
"When we ran a little bit we'd get some room," he said. "They were all over me 
in the set offense." 
</P>
<P>
The game started evenly and Occidental founded itself trailing by a point, 
16-15, 9 minutes into the first half. But then the Tigers applied backcourt 
pressure and capitalized on 4 Whittier turnovers to put together a 9-2 spurt. 
</P>
<P>
Leading by 8 at the intermission, Occidental opened the second half with an 
11-6 rally paced by Anderson, who scored 6. The Tigers maintained momentum and 
led by 12, 63-48, with 12:40 to play. 
</P>
<P>
Nine minutes in the second half Whittier trailed by 19. But the Poets weren't 
through as they mounted their own rally, putting together an 8-0 run over the 
next 3 minutes to trim the deficit to 74-63. 
</P>
<P>
But the Tigers, who muffed a 13-point second-half lead in an overtime loss to 
Claremont last Wednesday, held on.

HARBOR TOUGH GUY HAS SCORING PUNCH; 
</P>
<P>
MUSCULAR KEITH BILLINGSLEA'S REAL THREAT IS HIS TOUCH FROM OUTSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most people agree on two things when it comes to Harbor College guard Keith 
Billingslea: He likes to shoot and he looks vicious. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I have mean facial expressions," Billingslea said. "My family watches 
me play and they tell me, 'If we saw you for the first time (on the basketball 
court), we'd figure you were some kind of mass murderer.' I guess it's kind of 
good because it intimidates opponents and it gets my teammates pumped." 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-2, 207-pound sophomore doesn't have a basketball player's physique, 
but he plays the game just fine. Compared to his teammates, he's stocky and 
very muscular, and he possesses an extra dose of confidence that often makes 
him appear cocky as well as dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
"He's always been very developed," said Issy Washington, who runs summer 
tournaments for all-star high school basketball players. "He had a man's body 
as a sophomore in high school." 
</P>
<P>
Freshman guard Vernon Middleton said he has heard spectators comment on 
Billingslea's robust appearance several times. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people think he's tough and old," Middleton said. "They just think 
he's real tough because he looks that way, kind of." 
</P>
<P>
If the 20-year-old Billingslea had a gap-toothed smile to go with his physique 
and his scruffy beard, he might be mistaken for heavyweight boxing champion 
Mike Tyson, despite the fact that his specialty is shooting leather through a 
hoop rather than punching flesh with it. 
</P>
<P>
Billingslea leads the 12-9 Seahawks (5-2 in Southern California Athletic 
Conference play) in scoring with a 20-point average. He always has a green 
light to shoot because, though sometimes inconsistent from the field, he's more 
often successful. 
</P>
<P>
His jump shots from the perimeter frequently find nothing but net, and his 
aggressive style allows him to drive the lane if his outside shot happens to be 
off. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a scorer," said Harbor Coach Ken Curry. "He can really score some points 
for you. I think when you get him to play both ends of the court, he's one of 
the best (junior college) players in the state. The problem is that he doesn't 
always play defense." 
</P>
<P>
Billingslea admits that defense isn't his cup of tea, but he's laboring to 
improve that as well as other parts of his game. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm working on consistency," he said. "I need to do that on the defensive end, 
and I just need to play harder and sounder, and I need to work on motivation." 
</P>
<P>
Middleton says Billingslea's intensity inspires others on the young Harbor 
team, which starts only two sophomores, Billingslea and forward Ron Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
"He's really helped the team a lot," Middleton said, "not only because of his 
great shooting and all-around playing, but also because he's got great rhythm. 
He gets us up." 
</P>
<P>
Billingslea is experienced when it comes to motivating teammates with 
exceptional play. At South Gate High, he was a two-time All-City and four-time 
All-Eastern League player. He was the league most valuable player two years in 
a row and was twice selected to the Times All-Southeast team. 
</P>
<P>
Billingslea broke the school record for career scoring (1,970) and averaged 30 
points a game as a senior guard. 
</P>
<P>
"He grew tremendously," said South Gate basketball Coach Paul Hackett, "because 
he really worked hard every day. He had a lot of natural talent, but he also 
had to work at it. He could even shoot well off the screen, which a lot of kids 
can't do very well." 
</P>
<P>
Billingslea's high school career led to numerous offers from Division I 
schools. He visited the University of Hawaii, Wake Forest and Fresno State. He 
opted for Fresno, where he played for one year, because he liked the coaching 
staff and Hackett recommended the program. 
</P>
<P>
"They really made me feel welcome there," said Billingslea, who started in 
seven games for the Bulldogs. "I felt the people there really accepted me. I 
thought Hawaii and Wake Forest were nice, but Fresno was better." 
</P>
<P>
After one season, however, Billingslea was switched from guard to forward. He 
practiced with the team until the first game of what would have been his 
sophomore season, but decided to leave because two experienced players were 
ahead of him in his new position. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess you can say it was a short and sweet career," Billingslea said. Of the 
Fresno coaches, he said: "I guess we just had different ideas." 
</P>
<P>
So Billingslea moved back home in December, 1987, and the minute Curry heard 
the news, he pursued the high-scoring guard. 
</P>
<P>
"I was substituting at South Gate," Curry said, "and I was talking to Paul 
(Hackett), and he mentioned that Keith called him last night and that he left 
Fresno. Before the period was over, I contacted Keith and tried to talk him 
into coming to Harbor. I've known him since he was a ninth-grader, and I knew 
he could help us out." 
</P>
<P>
So far, he has. Even early in the season, Billingslea led Harbor's offense. 
Against Mira Costa, for example, he scored 33 points. More recently, in a SCAC 
game against Compton College, he scored 27. In Wednesday's game against Los 
Angeles City College, he had a team-high 17 points. 
</P>
<P>
Billingslea wants to shoot his way to the junior college playoffs, then find a 
place to finish his shaky college basketball career. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Washington State, Hawaii, St. Mary's and Gonzaga have shown interest. 
Billingslea is considering Washington State because playing in the PAC-10 
sounds appealing. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody is going to get a good guard next year," Washington said. "They're 
going to be very lucky to get the combination of his experience and great 
ability."

The Cal State Northridge women's basketball team suffered through one of its 
worst shooting performances of the season, but even without their best player 
the Lady Matadors defeated Cal State Dominguez Hills, 63-51, Saturday night in 
the Toro gym. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Cavalin, who is averaging a team-leading 16.6 points and 10.1 rebounds a 
game, missed the game because of a pulled groin muscle. She is expected to play 
Thursday when Northridge plays host to second-ranked Cal Poly Pomona.

Northridge (15-4 overall, 3-1 in the California Collegiate Athletic Assn.) is a 
game behind Pomona in the conference standings. 
</P>

Bridgette Ealy had a team-high 22 points and 12 rebounds to lead the Lady 
Matadors, who shot just 33.9% from the field. Vicki Mallett added 13 points for 
CSUN and Julie Arlotto had 11 points.

Kathy Goggin had 16 points to lead Dominguez Hills (5-11, 1-3). MIKE HISERMAN 
In other women's games: Cal Lutheran 82, Christ College 71 -- Christ College 
started the game with only 5 players and played the final minutes with just 3 
after 2 had fouled out of the Golden State Athletic Conference game at Christ 
College. Heidi Griffith led the Regals (5-12, 2-3) with 21 points and Brenda 
Lee had 18 points and 11 rebounds. Cuesta 90, Canyons 72 -- Tressie Millender 
scored 32 points and grabbed 10 rebounds, but it wasn't enough for Canyons in 
the Western State Conference game at Cuesta. Cuesta center Vanessa Hornbuckle, 
a graduate of Newbury Park High, scored a game-high 41 points and pulled down 
12 rebounds. Teammate Karen McConnell added 25 points and 10 rebounds for 
Cuesta (11-11, 3-5). Debbie Barnard had 12 points and a game-high 13 rebounds 
for Canyons (3-17, 2-6).MEN Cal Lutheran 88, Christ College 75 -- Dave Rowlands 
came off the bench to score 12 points and spark a second-half rally that saw 
the visiting Kingsmen outscore Christ College, 49-32, in the GSAC game. Center 
Mike Demeter, who along with Steve deLaveaga led Cal Lutheran with 26 points, 
scored 17 points in the first half. Jeff Logsdon had 12 points for Cal Lutheran 
(8-12, 2-4) and Charles Jackson had 10 points. Canyons 79, Cuesta 73 -- Four 
players scored in double figures as the Cougars held off Cuesta in the WSC game 
at Cuesta. Larry Allbritton led Canyons (12-13, 3-5) with 20 points and Aaron 
Clark added 17 points. Moorpark 76, West Los Angeles 58 -- Bruce Watson scored

CATALINA TRIP TWICE AS NICE FOR OAKWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is unusual for a team to play the same league opponent 2 days in a row. And 
it's even more rare for a team to play both games on the other team's home 
court -- and win both. But that's exactly what Oakwood did Friday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Playing at Avalon High on Santa Catalina Island, Oakwood defeated the Lancers, 
59-52, Saturday in a Liberty League game. The victory followed a 71-53 win 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell Butler led the Gorillas to both victories, scoring 24 points and 
grabbing 14 rebounds Saturday to go along with 37 points, 11 rebounds, 6 
assists and 10 steals Friday. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. Baptist 31, Miraleste 28 -- Brett Craig, the Knights' leading scorer, was 
held to 5 points, but teammate Dave Garcia picked up the slack with 16 points 
in the nonleague game at L. A. Baptist. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia made 6 of 8 field-goal attempts as L. A. Baptist shot 60% (12 of 20) 
from the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Crossroads 56, Campbell Hall 54 (2 OTs) -- Ty Leatherman hit a 3-point shot for 
Campbell Hall to send the game into double overtime. Richard Strayer scored 16 
points for Campbell Hall and teammate Phil Bruno added 15 points and 10 
rebounds.

TOURNAMENTS POSE LOGISTICAL PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Before writing his commentary about the attitude of 2 private golf clubs toward 
hosting a Seniors Tour tournament, Rich Tosches should have done a little 
research. He might have learned that clubs in the Los Angeles metropolitan area 
were obliged long ago to drop major tournaments for some very practical 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Foremost among the barriers is logistics. Tosches pointed the finger at 
Lakeside Golf Club, so let's use that club as an example. The Lakeside parking 
lot accommodates perhaps 200 cars. Other than residential streets, there is no 
available public parking within several miles. How would Mr. Tosches suggest 
that Lakeside handle the "upward of 50,000 spectators" (his figures) who would 
attend a Seniors Tour event? 
</P>
<P>
If that were not a sufficient deterrent, consider the damage to a carefully 
maintained golf course by the trampling of thousands of feet (high heels 
included) for 4 days. Full recovery could be a matter of weeks or months. 
Member-owned golf clubs are operated for the benefit and enjoyment of the 
members and not for profit. To charge outsiders for the use of their facilities 
would be in conflict with their nonprofit status. 
</P>
<P>
How long since you have heard of a tour event at El Caballero, Wilshire, 
Bel-Air, Annandale, Hillcrest or Los Angeles Country Club? Sure, the L. A. Open 
is coming up at Riviera. 
</P>
<P>
Riviera is privately owned and presumably operated for profit. Riviera also is 
uniquely situated to cope with large galleries.

PAYING SOMEONE TO DO THE SHOPPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have just finished reading your article about Select Shopping Services and 
the job that this "operation" is doing ("Shopper Buys Office Supplies for 
Clients Too Busy to Bother," Jan. 18). I couldn't believe the content of the 
article. It is certainly a condemnation of both middle and top management; the 
idea of a corporation being willing to pay $23 for someone to "shop" for them. 
I, for one, ran my own business for 35 years. If we needed anything for our 
office in the way of office supplies, I would note it immediately, then stop at 
any one of half a dozen office supply stores that were on the way home and at 
which I had previously opened charge accounts, and get our needs. These would 
remain in my car until the next day, when I would remove them and deliver them 
to my secretary at 8 a.m. This beats the delivery offered by the local 
stationer, which usually would take another day or two, but still cost nothing. 
</P>
<P>
I just can't see where a sane office manager, acting in the best interests of 
his employer and/or the shareholders, could engage the services of the sort 
described in your article. You specifically mention ITT. How the selection of 
services of this sort ever got the OK in a supposedly well-run company like ITT 
is unfathomable. What a waste of shareholders' money. Now, admittedly, the 
"unheated warehouse" type of operations do price some of their merchandise a 
bit lower, but a bit of shopping will generally show that the lack of 
completeness ultimately forces most office managers into purchasing from houses 
with a more complete line.

PROBLEM PROGRAMS FOR JOB TRAINING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The loss of jobs in Orange County ("Loss of Job in Orange County Often 
Devastating," Jan. 15, Page 1) and the problem of employment training and 
retraining deserves more expansive coverage. What is needed is a joint federal, 
state and local effort to simplify and rationalize needed job services and 
employment training. What we have is the following: 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA), the Reagan Administration's 
answer to training for the disadvantaged, was designed and sponsored by two 
millionaires: Dan Quayle and Ted Kennedy. In operation it has been seriously 
hampered by an inability to pay training stipends to disadvantaged participants 
and by its vagueness concerning the role and powers of the mandated local 
Private Industry Councils. As a consequence, in most service delivery areas 
(and particularly in Orange County) available JTPA funds have been the object 
of jealous contention among the cities and the county, with elaborate planning 
staffs created to administer often redundant, relatively small-scale, 
low-profile training. 
</P>
<P>
The county-operated JTPA consortium, consisting of the county government, 
Anaheim, Garden Grove and a coalition of cities in the northwest county 
operated by the city of La Habra, rule through a governing board that only 
reluctantly shares power or policies with the appointed Private Industry 
Council. The city of Santa Ana recently opted out of the consortium to set up 
its own JTPA "service delivery area." This development has further contributed 
to the complexity and cost of local job services and training. 
</P>
<P>
The state Employment Development Department (EDD) is one of the more 
bureaucratic and inept organizations and contributes little to an effective 
local job training process, apparently preferring to keep the individual with 
obsolete or inadequate skills constantly pounding the pavement seeking often 
non-existent openings. 
</P>
<P>
These agencies, and now the county Department of Social Services with its own 
state-funded GAIN (Greater Avenues of Independence) program for providing job 
training to welfare clients, all contribute to an overlapping, chaotic and 
irrational local offering of job services that would make Kafka proud but only 
confounds disadvantaged and laid-off persons confronted with the urgent problem 
of seeking work or retraining.

SELF-DESCRIPTION BY EDD CHALLENGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Written in response to a story about victims of plant closings who were not 
informed by the state Employment Development Department of the availability of 
government-sponsored retraining programs. ("Jobless Miss Out on Helpful 
Programs," Jan. 15.) 
</P>
<P>
 Your article about Quoc Le quoted a supervisor from EDD as stating EDD's first 
priority is to help people find jobs. I found that their first priority is to 
enforce the EDD rules. Help with finding a job is only an incidental priority, 
if it is a priority at all. 
</P>
<P>
After obtaining an engineering degree from Stanford in 1960, I learned a lot 
about fuel combustion at Garrett Turbine Engines in Phoenix. I came to Orange 
County in 1972, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, to assist in curing air 
pollution. I conducted a lengthly series of research programs, under 
sponsorship by EPA (Environmental Protection Agency), that developed new ways 
to control air pollution. Many industrial plants throughout the South Coast Air 
Basin benefited from my work, which has been helpful in the painfully gradual 
improvement of air quality in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the Reagan Administration, EPA research was basically 
abandoned, at least the part dealing with fuel combustion; efforts were turned 
to hazardous wastes. This eventually resulted in my being laid off for "lack of 
work," a difficult anomaly for an air pollution engineer living in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
I received an immediate job offer through friends but it involved many miles of 
rush-hour travel. So I elected to look for work close by and also gave thought 
to starting my own business. Meanwhile, since I knew that some of the revenue I 
generated for my prior employer was spent for unemployment insurance, I felt I 
deserved to collect some benefits. I applied at the Santa Ana EDD office. 
</P>
<P>
What happened was that I got no help at all in finding a job, no "stack of 
documents" about job seeking, no information about job referrals. I filled out 
a form, was told to record my interviews and was given a booklet full of rules. 
All EDD says is: "You need to find a job." I already knew that. 
</P>
<P>
To make an agonizing story short, I eventually made the mistake of mentioning I 
was trying to start my own company. That not only terminated my benefits, but I 
was forced to repay prior benefits. 
</P>
<P>
I feel very sorry for those who have no other recourse but to depend on EDD. It 
would be interesting to analyze the effectiveness of EDD in actual job 
placement.

METHOD OF RANKING INDEPENDENT BANKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As is your practice each quarter, you reported in your Jan. 14 issue on the 
status of Orange County independent banks as of the end of the third quarter 
("Independent Banks' Profits for 9 Months Top All '87 Income"). The 39 banks 
were ranked in descending order according to the size of their total assets. 
That also is your customary way of ranking banks. However, that is not the way 
that investors would rank banks. 
</P>
<P>
For once, we at United American Bank would like to see you rank the banks 
according to their return on equity. That is what shareholders want to see. 
Obviously, we make this point because the ranking for United American Bank 
would dramatically change. Instead of being considered a small bank, people 
would then look upon us as a well-managed, very profitable bank. Incidentally, 
our profit on beginning equity will exceed 16% for 1988. That would put us near 
the top of your "corrected" list, which is where we believe we rightfully 
belong.

TURNING PAIN INTO CASH IS CREMATION CASE CHALLENGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SPANO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was an unpleasant thought but one that Eileen Heffley just couldn't put out 
of her mind. 
</P>
<P>
Several irregularities had occurred in the cremation and funeral of her late 
brother by the Harbor Lawn Memorial Park in Costa Mesa. Heffley believed the 
corpse had been roughly treated by the man who collected it at her home, where 
her brother died. 
</P>
<P>
Then there were repeated delays in receiving the ashes. 
</P>
<P>
The worry became a nagging doubt. She couldn't help but think the unthinkable: 
that something had gone wrong, and that her brother's remains had not been 
treated with the dignity and respect they deserved. 
</P>
<P>
She telephoned her lawyer with questions. 
</P>
<P>
That call 6 years ago has led to the filing of more than 300 lawsuits against 
Harbor Lawn and firms that used its cremation services alleging the mishandling 
of corpses during 12,000 cremations conducted between 1978 and 1983. The 
alleged misconduct potentially could touch as many as 30,000 relatives and 
friends of the dead. Harbor Lawn and the other defendants have denied the 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
While similar lawsuits in Pasadena and San Francisco have alleged improprieties 
in cremations, the Harbor Lawn cases -- involving plaintiffs from all over the 
country, but mostly from Orange County -- were the first in California to 
allege such extensive mishandling. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Flood of Lawsuits 
</P>
<P>
The flood of lawsuits, all revolving around the same allegations of wrongdoing 
against the defendants but each involving different victims, at one time 
threatened to overwhelm the Orange County Superior Court in a wave of 
litigation. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, on Monday a judge will preside over what could be the last significant 
hearing in the cases. After more than 3 years of effort, most of the parties 
involved have proposed to end the massive case with payments now approaching 
$30 million. 
</P>
<P>
Turning a monumental legal headache into a model of judicial efficiency has 
required demanding negotiations among dozens of warring parties and insurers, 
adjustments in legal tactics as the law itself has changed during the lengthy 
case, and finally the creation of a settlement that has cracked traditional 
legal molds. 
</P>
<P>
The deal is scheduled to move from Superior Court Judge Jerrold S. Oliver, who 
presided over the talks, to his colleague, Judge John L. Flynn Jr., who in 2 
weeks of hearings beginning Monday will determine if the delicate compromise 
warrants approval. 
</P>
<P>
If Flynn endorses the settlement, no trials will be held. The defendants -- 
Harbor Lawn, a group of Orange County funeral homes that used Harbor Lawn's 
crematory services, and the Neptune Society of Orange County, which arranged 
cremations -- have steadfastly denied the charges and, under the agreement, 
will not have to admit any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Back Up Allegations 
</P>
<P>
Betty McMullen, the Tustin lawyer who represents Heffley and the majority of 
those who have come forward so far, said she was ready to back up the gruesome 
allegations with testimony. 
</P>
<P>
A man who worked in the crematorium has already stated under oath that he 
regularly stuffed more than one corpse in a single furnace. Other Harbor Lawn 
employees -- morticians, embalmers, funeral arrangers, delivery workers -- were 
ready to testify about improper practices, according to McMullen. 
</P>
<P>
And perhaps most painful of all for survivors, ashes of loved ones were 
commingled, McMullen alleged. 
</P>
<P>
"These people suffered from intense emotional, and at times physical, distress 
when they learned what happened. And they still don't know what happened to the 
remains, and where they are now. Harbor Lawn can't tell them. They're never 
going to know for sure," McMullen said. 
</P>
<P>
The task of translating that anguish into dollars and cents emerged as the 
challenge of the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Cases involving recovery solely for emotional distress are rare, offering 
little guidance. Lawyers had to consider that, like any case, damages were 
within the limits of insurance of the defendants. But their central concern was 
making sure that all claimants were included. More than 400 people had filed 
lawsuits, but 12,000 cremations had been performed during the period in 
question. Many thousands might come forward with new demands after the 
announcement of a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
If Harbor Lawn was going to agree to pay, it would do so only if it knew for 
certain that claims made later would be covered by the settlement as well those 
already on file. 
</P>
<P>
The solution was to transform the individual cases into a class action for the 
settlement. The current plaintiffs would be represented by their own lawyers; a 
judge would appoint counsel for those yet to come forward. 
</P>
<P>
That approach has been used with success in other cases involving hundreds and 
thousands of victims, such as Vietnam veterans suing over exposure to Agent 
Orange, the nationwide litigation over the use of asbestos to insulate many 
schools, lawsuits over the Dalkon Shield, and so-called "mass torts," such as 
plane crashes and train derailments. 
</P>
<P>
But an unusual and controversial aspect of the Harbor Lawn deal is that, if 
approved by Judge Flynn, no plaintiff will have the option to "go it alone." 
Anyone who claims damages must do so through the class structure, and none will 
be allowed to proceed to trial independently, unlike other class action cases. 
</P>
<P>
Forcing all those who have and will sue into the same class is an unusual 
approach. The settlement would cut off the victims' normal right to a trial by 
jury and has been the target of the most serious challenges to the deal. 
</P>
<P>
"It is unusual," said attorney Nancy Sher Cohen, representing Harbor Lawn. "But 
California law allows for flexibility in its approach to class action law. We 
must rely on the ability of the (judge) to adopt innovative procedures that 
will be fair to litigants and expedient." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
To Its Knees 
</P>
<P>
Said one court employee: "If the settlement isn't approved, it will bring our 
court system to its knees." 
</P>
<P>
With the protection of the proposed mandatory class action, the defendants 
signed on between May, 1986, and last summer. As part of the tentative 
settlement, they have paid a total of $21,183,000 into a fund over the last 2 
years -- $14 million by Harbor Lawn, $2,675,000 by the Neptune Society, and the 
remaining $4,508,000 from five groups of mortuaries that did business with 
Harbor Lawn. 
</P>
<P>
The interest earned to date, earmarked for the victims, is now estimated at $2 
million. In another unusual aspect of the case, the defendants have agreed to 
pay directly for the costs of managing the fund -- keeping track of the money, 
notifying potential claimants, advertising, and administering the machinery for 
making payments. Total costs of administration have been estimated at $3 
million to $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
As the pot grew, conflicts between claimants arose over how to divide it. 
</P>
<P>
The first group of plaintiffs, those who had filed lawsuits by mid-1986, argued 
that they deserved higher damages than those who followed. The original group 
investigated and prepared the case, at great expense, and its members argued 
that victims who show up later do not deserve an equal share. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Demanding Too Much 
</P>
<P>
But counsel named to represent the interests of the estimated 30,000 customers 
of Harbor Lawn who had not yet sued felt the original group was demanding too 
much. 
</P>
<P>
"The original (389) plaintiffs believed that they had been promised 80% of any 
settlement. We in effect have been able to renegotiate it, first down to 25%, 
and now even lower." said Polly Horn, whose firm was appointed to represent the 
class of people who may make claims in the future. 
</P>
<P>
The first plaintiffs have already collected $3.5 million under an earlier phase 
of the settlement, averaging $9,281.36 apiece. They will also collect from the 
remainder of the fund, the amount determined by how many others file claims. 
</P>
<P>
Another $1 million has been set aside for minors, incompetent people and those 
not yet born who may file claims. 
</P>
<P>
To date, all known plaintiffs in the case, except one couple from Fountain 
Valley, have agreed to the settlement. While all defendants have not accepted 
the deal, all their insurers have, and the settlement would legally protect all 
defendants, whether they have supported the deal or not. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Proud of Settlement 
</P>
<P>
"We are very proud of the settlement," said Cohen for Harbor Lawn. "The point 
we've made all along is that it's fair to the plaintiffs, it's fair to the 
defendants who want to get this matter behind them, and obviously it's a relief 
to the court." 
</P>
<P>
"We believe the settlement fund is substantial and should give the class 
members adequate redress," said Horn. 
</P>
<P>
In most cases, getting the damage money to the victim is usually the last and 
easiest step. But nothing has been easy in the cremation cases, and its 
conclusion, if the settlement is accepted, will be no exception. 
</P>
<P>
First there will be a publicity blitz, for which $250,000 has been set aside to 
purchase television time and notices in such publications as Parade magazine, 
TV Guide and the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
Those who think they deserve a share will have a limited amount of time to file 
claims. The number to come forward will determine how much longer the 
litigation will go on, as well as the amount of money individuals will receive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Who Can Make a Claim? 
</P>
<P>
"There were 12,000 cremations between July 1, 1978, and July 31, 1983. The 
question becomes: Who can make a claim?" said Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
Those qualified to make claims, estimated as high as 30,000, are anyone who 
arranged for the cremation, those who had the legal right to dispose of the 
remains, anyone related by blood, marriage or adoption and anyone claiming a 
"special relationship" to the deceased. 
</P>
<P>
"You tell me how many people are going to be able to claim on that basis," said 
Cohen. "We sit around here and say, 'Oh God. How many are there going to be?' " 
</P>
<P>
Damages will be based on objective factors that are designed to measure how 
much a person suffered. Individuals will receive points determined by their 
relation to the deceased. 
</P>
<P>
"If you are a surviving spouse, you get more points than if you are a sibling," 
McMullen said. "You get points if you arranged for the cremation." 
</P>
<P>
"It's taken a lot of time to work out the details. It takes into consideration 
the legal factors in trying to divide the money equitably. You can't put this 
out with cookie cutters. Emotional distress is unique," McMullen said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Complex Point System 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers involved say that while the point system is complex, the claim form 
itself should be easy to understand and complete. There will be a toll-free 
telephone number to help those who have questions. 
</P>
<P>
In a bow to the unique type of damages involved, yet another fund has been set 
up. It is designed to be the last resort for those who have been denied 
recovery or feel they have been shortchanged by the point system. 
</P>
<P>
People will be permitted to make their pitch before a hearing officer, probably 
a retired judge, who will make the final decision. While there will be no 
representatives of the defendants present, the plan calls for an informal trial 
to take place. 
</P>
<P>
"In a case of this size, normally you try to develop a system dealing only with 
objective factors, and have a computer run out the points and cut the checks," 
Cohen said. "We felt that because emotional distress damages are extremely 
subjective, we needed a vehicle for compensating people who were particularly 
distressed and perturbed." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, separate funds for minors and for lawyers and others who worked on the 
case will be created. Legal fees generally will be capped at 25% of the total 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
The entire package, 4 years in the making, will be reviewed by Judge Flynn, who 
is the fifth Superior Court judge to be involved in the case. If he approves, 
the machinery for processing will begin, with Flynn taking a final look at the 
deal at the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
Other cases alleging mishandling of remains are now pending in Southern 
California. A Bay Area lawsuit, in which a burial-at-sea firm was accused of 
mixing the ashes of 5,000 cremations, was settled last year for about $30 
million. 
</P>
<P>
And the operators of the Lamb Funeral Home in Pasadena have been the target of 
bizarre allegations not only of desecration, but sale of organs for 
transplants. The owners face criminal charges in the case. 
</P>
<P>
But the avalanche of cases Eileen Heffley helped trigger 6 years ago remains 
the first, and in the words of Harbor Lawn attorneys, "the most troublesome 
group of cases ever to descend upon the courts in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
After 6 years of uncertainty and delays, Heffley said she believes the lawsuit 
was worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it did some good," she said. "I think we did some good for the funeral 
industry."

Kenneth Beets remembers the day a decade ago when he and his wife scattered the 
ashes of their only child, the victim of a hit-and-run driver who was never 
caught, over the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
"It was beautiful. It was just a beautiful day," said Beets, 69, of Fountain 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"Birds were wheeling around the ship. The sunlight would reflect off those 
ashes 20 feet down. 
</P>
<P>
"We were calm. We knew we had to hold onto each other to get over it." 
</P>
<P>
Beets, a former Army aviator, World War II veteran and Oklahoma native, had at 
first resisted the idea of cremation. But he said he bowed to the wishes his 
son had often expressed. 
</P>
<P>
"When they buried him, I figured exactly where, in terms of latitude and 
longitude," Beets said. "I wrote it down in the family Bible, with our wish 
that upon our death, we would be cremated and our ashes scattered at the same 
spot." 
</P>
<P>
But the vibrant, soothing memory turned to shock and anguish when the Beetses 
heard about the "cremation cases," lawsuits in which Harbor Lawn Memorial Park 
and others were accused of desecrating the remains of the dead and commingling 
their ashes. 
</P>
<P>
Among the emotions that swept over Beets was one that was unfamiliar but with 
which he would become intimately acquainted: a thirst for vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Beetses are the only two victims out of hundreds in a massive group 
of civil lawsuits who refuse to accept a settlement that would provide up to to 
$30 million as compensation for emotional distress to customers of Harbor Lawn 
between July 1, 1978, through July 31, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody has to do what he's got to do," Beets said. "They can settle if they 
want to. But I don't want to. I want justice if there's not a dime in it." 
</P>
<P>
The son, Kenneth Jr., was 38 when he died. He was in the floor-covering 
business with his father and lived at their home. Beets said his son owned a 
motorboat that he kept in Dana Point Harbor and loved the sea. 
</P>
<P>
The grieving father went to some trouble to look into his son's unorthodox 
burial wishes. He called an old military friend, a Navy chaplain who had 
performed burials at sea, to be certain that cremation was religiously 
acceptable. Then he said he checked out the Neptune Society, which offered such 
services, to make sure everything would go as planned. 
</P>
<P>
"Or at least we thought we had investigated it," Beets lamented. "We certainly 
didn't do a very good job." 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for Harbor Lawn have declined to discuss individual cases but has 
denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
Hearing the allegations against Harbor Lawn left Beets uncertain about his 
son's remains. He felt angry and guilty. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's what made my wife's health start failing," Beets said. "I know 
it shattered me. Ever since that time, I haven't been able to function as I 
used to function. Maybe it would have been different had he not been the only 
kid we had. 
</P>
<P>
"I was never a suspicious person. Now I wouldn't believe the sun was shining 
outside till I went out and saw it for myself." 
</P>
<P>
And he has lost faith in himself, he said, as well as trust in others. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the worst thing that had ever happened to us, absolutely. The fact that I 
did not see to it myself, that I trusted the Neptune Society, just flat done me 
in. I failed him," Beets said. "I failed the only kid that I had by not making 
sure. 
</P>
<P>
"Deep down inside there's still the knowledge that I didn't look into it. 
</P>
<P>
"No way (the settlement is) punishment enough." 
</P>
<P>
So today, exorcising his personal demons means pursuing his lawsuit, come what 
may. He knows that all sides feel that unless he is denied his goal and is 
forced to accept the settlement, it could unravel for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
"Succeed? I hope we can. We'll go all the way. We want a jury of our peers; we 
want to go to trial. That's why we filed suit in the first place. I don't know 
what other people think. I only know what I think. It isn't right. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want a jury of lawyers, or of newspaper reporters, just common 
ordinary people like me and Florine." 
</P>
<P>
The task of translating anguish into dollars and cents is the challenge of 
cremation settlement. Part I, Page.1

250,000 EXPECTED FOR LITTLE SAIGON'S 3-DAY TET FESTIVAL

<P>
With only 6 days left before the beginning of the Tet festival celebrating the 
lunar new year, the offices of the Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce in Orange 
County's Little Saigon resemble a war room. 
</P>
<P>
Gone are the sedate pictures of lakes and scenic countryside that adorned the 
walls. In their place, Tet festival coordinator Tony Lam has hung maps, 
bulletin boards, flow charts and the names of an army of volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
A telephone rings, and Lam answers it: "Hello? Hello? Yes, this is Tony Lam. 
Yes, yes, I know the bunting was the wrong color. Yes, I agree, the lettering 
doesn't show up enough. But what am I to do? They're up already! We're doing 
all we can." 
</P>
<P>
"Next year," he mutters to himself, after putting the telephone down. "Next 
year, we're going to start organizing right after Tet. None of this 3-month 
stuff. It's killing me." 
</P>
<P>
More than 250,000 people are expected to visit Little Saigon during a 3-day Tet 
festival that will begin Friday to usher in the Year of the Snake. Although 
Feb. 6 actually is the first day of the lunar new year, the celebrations begin 
days in advance. 
</P>
<P>
After months of bickering about which Vietnamese organization would coordinate 
Tet activities, a tug-of-war ended with the chamber winning because it was 
backed by the Vietnamese business community of Westminster's Little Saigon, 
said Westminster Mayor Charles V. Smith. 
</P>
<P>
For many Westminster officials, it was their first taste of ethnic rivalry. But 
for the most part, Smith said, "we only acted as intermediaries after 
complaints came in from different agencies wanting to take over and control the 
festival." 
</P>
<P>
Now that the plum assignment has gone to the Vietnamese chamber's festival 
committee, it has had to ensure the festival's success by borrowing more than 
$150,000 to help pay for a performance stage, parking shuttles, security, 
lighting and special shows. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Little Nervous' 
</P>
<P>
"We're confident we can pay the bank back, but it has made us a little 
nervous," said Chuoc Vo-Ta, the chamber's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
"After all," Lam added, "it is bad luck if you still owe people money on the 
first day of the new year." 
</P>
<P>
Bolsa Avenue will be cordoned off from Moran Street almost to Magnolia Street 
for the festival. Events will take place within a fenced area, and admission 
will be charged to help reduce costs, Lam said. 
</P>
<P>
Admission is $3 for adults, and $1 for children ages 3 to 10. Children under 3 
are free. 
</P>
<P>
The area is where the chamber's office is located and where Lam and 150 
volunteers have planned what is expected to be the largest Tet celebration 
since the first wave of Southeast Asian refugees arrived in Orange County in 
1975. 
</P>
<P>
In Westminster, Vietnamese businessmen took over an aging commercial strip on 
Bolsa Avenue and revitalized the area with new shopping malls housing grocery 
markets, fabric shops, bookstores and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
"For our city, it's meant an improved tax base," Mayor Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
"What is significant about Little Saigon is that the businessmen built the area 
on their own, independent of the city," he said. 
</P>
<P>
There are more than 320,000 Vietnamese in California, about 120,000 of them in 
Orange County. Vietnamese neighborhoods have started in Central Los Angeles, 
Cerritos and upscale areas of Costa Mesa. But nowhere are they more visible 
than in Orange County's Little Saigon. 
</P>
<P>
In the past 14 years, the commercial area along Bolsa Avenue in Westminster and 
Garden Grove -- designated a tourist zone in 1988 -- has gained a reputation as 
the center of Vietnamese business and culture. 
</P>
<P>
For many Vietnamese residents, the eve of the new year will be traditionally 
spent giving offerings to the God of Prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
The area's Buddhist temples will be open, and many Buddhists have altars at 
home and customarily prepare a bounty of food for their ancestors or deceased 
family members so that they can share in the new year's prosperity, Lam said. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese lunar calender has a 12-year cycle. The 20th Century, according to 
the cycle, opened with the Year of the Rat. The Rat was replaced by the Ox, 
then the Tiger, the Hare, the Dragon, the Snake, the Horse, the Sheep, the 
Monkey, the Rooster, the Dog and the Wild Boar. Each of the 12 animals 
supposedly has both positive and negative qualities. 
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese New Year festival begins at the first new moon after the sun 
enters Aquarius. The day may fall between Jan. 21 and Feb. 19. 
</P>
<P>
"With each new year," Lam said, "we believe that life is a continuing hope. My 
father's hope, for instance, is to see my brother and my sister being able to 
get out of Vietnam next year." 
</P>
<P>
But some families, such as that of Dr. Co Pham, a Fountain Valley surgeon, plan 
a less traditional Tet, one more oriented to the children. 
</P>
<P>
"For us, and other professionals, it's a chance for our children to see where 
our roots began," Pham said. "Although my children are able to speak a little 
Vietnamese, they're growing up in a Western culture. They need to see and hear 
Vietnamese customs like Tet." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Parade With Bands 
</P>
<P>
Bakeries will be busy making such traditional foods as banh chung, a square 
gelatinous cake made of rice, mung beans and pork, wrapped in banana leaves, 
and a type of Vietnamese fruitcake called mut. 
</P>
<P>
New this year, organizers said, is a parade with marching bands, shuttle buses 
to ease parking problems, Vietnamese string bands and several entertainment 
shows directed by Hoang Thi Tho, who was well-known in South Vietnam's 
entertainment industry before the Communists took over the country in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
"In our first year of organizing Tet, we only had one martial arts group. Now 
we have four. And in addition, we will have Buddhist and Catholic folk dances. 
But this year, more than any other, we've made room for many different ethnic 
communities," said Lam, noting that Koreans, Cambodians, Latinos, Chinese and 
Anglos will be represented in the parade or other activities. 
</P>
<P>
"For us, it's a proud time to be Vietnamese," Lam said.

15TH SEA LION FOUND; THIS 1 IS ALIVE, WILL BE EXAMINED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF MITCHELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An ailing, 300-pound sea lion was found at Seal Beach on Saturday, the 15th to 
wash up on Orange County beaches in one week but the first still alive. 
</P>
<P>
Sea World of San Diego late Saturday agreed to dispatch a team of biologists 
and a specialized vehicle to bring the male sea lion back to the aquatic park, 
where veterinarians will examine it today after letting it rest Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Beach-goers saw the animal about 9 a.m. thrashing near the water line. An 
organization called Friends of the Sea Lion sent members to the site, but the 
animal was too large to bring to the group's facilities in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Judi Jones, director of Friends of the Sea Lion, said, "There was no evidence 
of injury or bullet holes that we could find." 
</P>
<P>
Wildlife authorities have speculated that the 14 other animals suffered viral 
infections or were killed by people. For example, commercial fishing operators 
often kill sea lions that become trapped in gill nets, said John Cunningham, 
co-director of Friends of the Sea Lion. "They'll either shoot it or cut off its 
head." That may explain why some of the animals that have washed ashore were 
headless, he said. All have been too decomposed for a necropsy, an examination 
to determine the cause of death. 
</P>
<P>
In all of last year, 18 of the creatures were found dead on area beaches, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the sight of the animal's suffering was distressing to those on 
the beach south of the entrance to Anaheim Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Many did not understand why the sea lion was allowed to suffer for more than 6 
hours before Sea World authorities were called at 2 p.m. Both city animal 
control officers and lifeguards said that they wanted to help but could not 
because beached marine animals are under federal jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
Seal Beach lifeguard Tom Tarpley said local officials could not reach anyone at 
the National Marine Fisheries Service on Saturday. No one answered the phone at 
the agency's Terminal Island offices. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm surprised that they haven't been here. . . . Usually, they move pretty 
quickly, for both the public's and the animal's sake," Tarpley said. But he 
said "our hands are tied by law. We really can't help." 
</P>
<P>
Usually, Tarpley said, sea lions wash ashore "near death or dead. This is the 
longest time that I have seen one stay alive. I hope that he makes it." 
</P>

found alive. The animal was taken to Sea World in San Diego, where it will be 
examined today. RICK PERRY

VIETNAMESE LOVE THE DRAGON BUT YEAR OF SNAKE? 'BAD, VERY BAD' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID REYES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dr. Co Long Pham, a surgeon in obstetrics and gynecology in Fountain Valley, is 
one doctor who is glad to see the Year of the Dragon draw to a close. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never delivered as many babies as I have during the last year. It seems 
that everyone wanted their child to be born during Year of the Dragon." 
</P>
<P>
And why not? 
</P>
<P>
Being born during the Year of the Dragon means a life of wealth, happiness and 
prosperity, according to Vietnamese refugees. Vietnamese businessmen fight to 
have dragon dancers perform near the front door of their store. 
</P>
<P>
It is not the same with the Year of the Snake, which officially arrives Feb. 6. 
</P>
<P>
"Year of Snake -- oh, bad, very bad," said businessman Tony Lam. "In our 
culture, it means you (are) born ugly." 
</P>
<P>
But people born in the Year of the Snake enjoy some positive attributes, 
according to other Asian cultures. They are people who were born in the years 
1905, 1917, 1929, 1941, 1953, 1965 and 1977. And, of course, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Snake people are calm, wise, intense and secretive. According to popular 
belief, snakes are creatures vested with eternity. In the Japanese language, 
the expression "to shed snake's skin" means to start a new life. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese believe that people born in the Year of the Snake will be very 
lucky. Men born that year are believed to be sentimental, while women are 
beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
Snake people love great beauty and passion, and excel in planning and 
organizing things, according to the Chinese and Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
On the negative side, the Chinese consider them a mite stingy but willing to 
help the less fortunate.

$212,000 NETTED IN TAX FRAUD PLAN, U.S. SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SPANO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Judging from appearances, Howard Owen Kieffer was a successful southern Orange 
County businessman. 
</P>
<P>
But law enforcement officials say the 33-year-old Trabuco Canyon resident 
dreamed up fake employers, creating a paper record that garnered him $212,000 
in bogus tax refunds in the process. 
</P>
<P>
Kieffer, who was indicted by a federal grand jury last week on charges of 
defrauding the government and filing fake income tax returns, could face a 
maximum of 75 years in prison and a $500,000 fine if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ample Salaries Claimed 
</P>
<P>
In tax returns for the past 5 years, Kieffer claimed he had received ample 
salaries from ICN Corp. in Los Angeles and Pacific Animal Diets Corp. in 
Anaheim, and that those salaries just grew larger each year. Neither company, 
according to the indictment, exists. 
</P>
<P>
Kieffer allegedly obtained genuine blank W-2 forms, filled them out with the 
bogus salary information and then attached them to his tax returns. He reported 
that portions of the salaries had been withheld for taxes and demanded a 
refund, which he collected without incident. 
</P>
<P>
That is, he did until an informant tipped off the Internal Revenue Service, 
according to prosecutor Maurice A. Leiter, an assistant U.S. attorney. 
Investigators quickly determined that the employers didn't exist and charged 
that the returns and refunds were bogus. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Alternate Member 
</P>
<P>
Kieffer, who has been active in Democratic Party politics and worked in the 
presidential campaign of Michael S. Dukakis last fall, now serves as an 
alternate member of the Democratic Central Committee of Orange County, 
according to Audrey Redfearn, head of the Democratic Foundation of Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Party officials confirmed that Kieffer was an alternate member of the Orange 
County Central Democratic Committee in 1988 and this year. 
</P>
<P>
Kieffer is scheduled to be arraigned Feb. 6 in federal court in Los Angeles.

OFFICER NEARLY RUN DOWN; DRIVER HELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Santa Ana man was arrested after trying to run down a Westminster motorcycle 
patrolman during a chase, authorities said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Westminster Police Sgt. Larry Russell said the incident began around 8:45 p.m. 
Friday when a car driven by Jose Manuel Najarra Herrera, 21, was spotted 
speeding in the area of Bushard Street and McFadden Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Russell said that Herrera failed to stop for police and that a chase began, 
covering a 4-mile area through commercial and residential areas in Westminster 
and Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
Herrera ran at least four stop signs and traffic lights before he entered a 
residential area in Garden Grove, Russell said. 
</P>
<P>
"At that point, the suspect turned his car around and tried to flee again, 
aiming his car at a police motorcycle," he said. The patrolman hopped off his 
motorcycle before Herrera's car slammed into it, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The patrolman fired two shots at the suspect's car. Both hit the car, but 
Herrera was not wounded, Russell said. 
</P>
<P>
Herrera was stopped two blocks away and arrested. He was arrested on suspicion 
of assault with a deadly weapon, evading arrest and driving under the influence 
of alcohol. He was treated and released for minor injuries at Humana Hospital 
in Westminster and later taken to Orange County Jail, where bail was set at 
$25,000.

1 KILLED, 1 INJURED IN TRUCK CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Juan Capistrano man was killed and another person injured early Saturday 
when their pickup crashed on the Santa Ana Freeway at La Paz Road, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County coroner's office identified the dead driver as John Haynes, 
23. A California Highway Patrol dispatcher said that Haynes was heading south 
on the freeway at 2:30 a.m., going 80 to 85 m.p.h., when he lost control as he 
tried to change lanes. 
</P>
<P>
The truck veered across the highway and flipped, throwing Haynes onto the 
pavement, the dispatcher said. Haynes was not wearing his seat belt. The 
passenger, who was belted in, suffered a broken shoulder and was treated at 
Mission Community Hospital in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
The identity of the injured passenger was not released.

DRUG FIRM STOCK UP ON NEWS OF POSSIBLE RECONSIDERATION OF ITS AIDS MEDICINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Newport Pharmaceuticals International, which 2 months ago halted its research 
on a potential AIDS medication called Isoprinosine, said Friday that its 
decision could be reconsidered in light of a new study by an affiliate in 
Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
The Newport Beach drug company warned, however, that the results of clinical 
trials in Scandinavia are "very preliminary" and have yet to be reviewed by the 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
Despite those reservations, Newport stock soared 71% after the preliminary 
findings were disclosed late Thursday. The stock closed Friday at $3 a share, 
up $1.25, on heavy over-the-counter trading of 1.1 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
Newport stock had fallen from $5.75 to $2.25 a share in November when the 
company announced that it would discontinue its research efforts in the wake of 
a disappointing clinical trial in the United States and Britain. 
</P>
<P>
The more recent Scandinavian tests, conducted at 21 hospitals in Denmark and 
Sweden since late 1986, involved patients infected with HIV, the virus that 
causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
Half of the 866 patients were treated with Isoprinosine and half were given 
placebos. The preliminary results, as reported by Newport's licensee in 
Denmark, Leo Pharmaceutical Products, showed a "significantly smaller number of 
patients in the (Isoprinosine) group developed AIDS, as compared with the 
placebo group." 
</P>
<P>
"But this is only the initial result," said Judith Woodward Archbold, Newport's 
vice president and legal counsel. "We haven't seen the data and cannot comment 
on whether it will warrant our filing for approval with the FDA." 
</P>
<P>
She said Newport's research department remains closed but could be reopened if 
the review of the Scandinavian data is positive. 
</P>
<P>
Newport has been trying for several years to gain Food and Drug Administration 
approval to market Isoprinosine in the United States. The drug -- the company's 
only proprietary product -- is marketed in 70 foreign countries for treatment 
of several viral diseases, including herpes. It also has been approved for use 
as an AIDS medication in New Zealand and the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
But clinical trials in this country have not produced results that have 
satisfied the FDA, and the test results announced in mid-November seemed to end 
Newport's domestic efforts. 
</P>
<P>
The tests, conducted over a 6-month period in hospitals in the United States 
and the United Kingdom, failed to show any significant differences between 
patients with AIDS-related complex who were treated with Isoprinosine and those 
treated with a placebo.

CREDIT ISSUERS SEE GOLD IN ORANGE COUNTY CARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
No, they're not just picking on you. 
</P>
<P>
If you live in most areas of Orange County, another credit card application 
really does fall out of your mailbox just about every other time you open it 
up. 
</P>
<P>
With its upscale demographics and affluent life style, Orange County has been 
targeted by many of the nation's financial institutions and dozens of national 
and regional retailers as a key battlefield in America's escalating credit card 
marketing war. 
</P>
<P>
The reason, according to card marketing specialists, is that the county has a 
heavy concentration of households with large incomes and big debt loads -- just 
the kind of households that credit card purveyors lust after. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Kollar knows all about it. 
</P>
<P>
The Costa Mesa resident, director of investment services for Rare Coin 
Investments in Newport Beach, said he receives an average of one bank credit 
card mailer a week, most from out-of-state banks pitching their Visa and 
MasterCard accounts. 
</P>
<P>
"They must really target this area," he said. "When we lived in the Midwest, we 
never got this much junk mail." 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, the median family income was $29,000 last year. In Orange County, 
it was $45,000 and it is expected to hit $49,000 this year. 
</P>
<P>
"And study after study has shown that as income goes up, expectations rise. And 
with increased expectations comes increased use of credit to realize them," 
said Stephen M. Szekely, a vice president of Payment Systems Inc., a Tampa, 
Fla., consumer financial services research firm. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, keeping up with the Joneses is an expensive proposition in 
Orange County, and credit card marketers know that a lot of the life style the 
county is famous for is supported by charge accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Some credit industry observers see danger signs in the intensifying marketing 
efforts, however. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people are succumbing to the temptation of getting additional cards 
and end up in many cases with credit limits that are far beyond their ability 
to handle," said Larry Schwartz, co-director of Credit Card Bureau, a Boynton 
Beach, Fla., firm specializing in prevention of credit card theft and fraud. 
</P>
<P>
The 401 regional Consumer Credit Counselors offices of the nonprofit National 
Foundation for Consumer Credit Inc. last year worked with more than 211,500 
people who needed help in paying off their credit card debts and other 
unsecured consumer loans. 
</P>
<P>
The average consumer credit debt load of those coming into the regional centers 
was $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, however, it was about $17,500, a clear indication that county 
residents are not only more affluent but also that they have a greater affinity 
for credit. 
</P>
<P>
American Banker, the banking industry's daily journal, estimates that 
nationwide, more than 1 billion solicitations for bank credit card applications 
were mailed to consumers in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Direct mail pitches for credit cards usually result in about one new account 
for every 100 letters sent, which means that those 1 billion mailings probably 
brought 10 million new customers to the various banks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Age, Income Groups 
</P>
<P>
And from all available evidence, a disproportionate number of the solicitations 
were sent to people with Orange County addresses. 
</P>
<P>
Payment Systems, the consumer research firm, has found that credit card 
marketing efforts tend to target households where the annual income is $15,000 
or more and the potential card customer is between 25 and 44. 
</P>
<P>
"That's because the 25 to 44 age group generally borrow the most and keep 
outstanding balances on their credit cards longer," Szekely said. 
</P>
<P>
A segment of the 45-and-over age group -- those with annual household incomes 
above $35,000 -- is also frequently targeted, mainly for the so-called premium, 
or "gold," cards, he said. 
</P>
<P>
And the number of addresses that fit into one of those two target groups 
represents a big slice of the approximately 830,000 households in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
A composite of Orange County statistics drawn from Census Bureau data and 
information from credit card marketing specialists shows that about 60% of 
county households are within the target age groups, compared to about 51% for 
the nation as a whole. And about 80% of the county's households are believed to 
earn more than $15,000 a year, compared to about 70% nationally. 
</P>
<P>
More important to credit card marketers, the county, as its high median income 
indicates, has far more households earning $35,000 or more than just about any 
other place in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"The high income and the high incidence of home ownership increases the chances 
that when a national data bank is tapped for a direct mailing campaign, Orange 
County will come out with a higher hit rate than most other areas," said Greg 
Landenburg, vice president of bank card products for Security Pacific National 
Bank in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County residents also tend to apply for more new cards than consumers 
elsewhere, said Gregory Bjorndahl, managing partner of the West Coast Group, an 
Irvine marketing firm specializing in credit card use patterns. 
</P>
<P>
"From conversations with large credit card issuers, I know this is an appealing 
area for them, for reasons that are very much the trends in the industry," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The card marketing blitz began with the advent of annual fees and the loosening 
of banking and interest restrictions in the late 1970s by states such as 
Delaware and South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the solicitations arrive in the mail, sent from the dozen or so 
out-of-state banks that have made mass marketing of credit cards a 
multibillion-dollar business. 
</P>
<P>
"The out-of-state banks are targeting California much more than the in-state 
banks," Bjorndahl said. 
</P>
<P>
MNC Financial Inc. of Baltimore, parent of Maryland Bank, runs one of the most 
aggressive credit card marketing programs in the country through a separate 
division based in Delaware. Over the past 5 years, MNC has become the nation's 
fifth-largest credit card issuer, with about 3.4 million accounts with $4 
billion in outstanding debt. 
</P>
<P>
And California -- particularly Orange and Los Angeles counties and the San 
Francisco Bay Area -- has become the bank's biggest market. 
</P>
<P>
"We have more card customers in California -- 527,000 of them -- than even in 
our own back yard here in Maryland," said David Spilman, vice president and 
treasurer of MNC. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High Net Earnings 
</P>
<P>
The reason banking companies such as MNC have plunged so heavily into credit 
card marketing is simple: It can be extremely profitable if done on a big 
enough scale with enough controls to keep losses down. 
</P>
<P>
MNC's credit card operation, which involves only about 17% of the company's 
9,000 workers, accounted for nearly 33% of the company's $50-million profit in 
1987, Spilman said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the latest year for which industrywide figures are available, the bank 
card issuing and servicing industry had net earnings of $3.9 billion, according 
to Payment Systems, the Florida research firm. 
</P>
<P>
Cardholders that year paid more than $13 billion in interest on about $84.5 
billion in total bank card debt. They also paid $3.2 billion in annual fees, 
which many card issuers began charging about a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
It is those annual fees -- which can run from $6 to $65 or more -- that bring 
in the profits, said Elgie Holstein, director of Bankcard Holders of America, a 
Washington-based lobbying and consumer education group for people with bank 
credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Citibank, the New York banking giant, had about 20 million 
accounts at the end of 1988; 3.5 million of those were opened last year. Most 
were the result of Citibank's massive direct mail campaigns, said William 
Ahearn, vice president of the Citibank individual banking division. 
</P>
<P>
With the annual fee on the basic Citibank Visa or MasterCard running about $20, 
those new accounts added $70 million to the bank's revenue even before 
cardholders incurred interest charges on any unpaid balances. 
</P>
<P>
When the credit card marketing competition began nearly a decade ago, issuers 
worked hard to sell consumers on the idea that if one major credit card was 
good, three or four were even better. 
</P>
<P>
That no longer is the message behind credit card solicitations. Many issuers 
now seem to want you to carry and use only their products. 
</P>
<P>
But many Americans find that credit cards, like potato chips, are more 
satisfying by the handful. 
</P>
<P>
In a study done in the middle of last year, West Coast Group found that 
Californians who own credit cards carry an average of 9 -- the national average 
is 8 -- and that 43% of the card-carrying Californians wanted more. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, about 71% of all households possess at least one bank credit card. 
The figure for California is 87%, according to Payment Systems. 
</P>
<P>
A Santa Ana restaurateur who asked not to be identified said he has a total of 
60 credit cards that give him the ability to draw as much as $180,000 in cash 
advances should he use all the available credit at one time. 
</P>
<P>
He said he uses the credit to raise smaller sums to help cover short-term cash 
needs for his outside investments. 
</P>
<P>
A more typical user is Kollar, the investment director for the rare-coin 
dealer. He carries MasterCards from four banks, Visa cards from two banks and 
an American Express card. 
</P>
<P>
Kollar said the reason for his getting most of the cards was that he used to 
travel on business nearly every weekend and needed the extensive credit to 
cover his travel costs until he was reimbursed. 
</P>
<P>
Credit card marketers argue that the marketing push is generally harmless, that 
consumers are not forced to apply for the cards and that they can just toss the 
mailers out. The credo seems to be that people, not credit cards, cause debt. 
</P>
<P>
But critics argue that the constant barrage of direct-mail solicitations 
provides a temptation that some may find too powerful to resist. 
</P>
<P>
"These mailings by banks are totally uncontrolled," said Schwartz, the Florida 
credit card theft and fraud prevention expert. 
</P>
<P>
"They have all this access to demographics and names of people across the 
nation, and they mail out hundreds of millions of applications and the average 
number of cards has gone up to about eight per person," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That means there are about 880 million credit cards out there, Schwartz said, 
with total purchasing power of $2.75 trillion or about 2 1/2 times the amount 
of currency in circulation. 
</P>

It's nice to know you are wanted. 
</P>
<P>
And credit card issuers definitely want you if you live in most parts of Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Marketing specialists estimate that the 80% of Orange County households with 
incomes of more than $15,000 a year receive an average of four credit card 
solicitations in the mail each month, or about three times the national 
average. 
</P>
<P>
To test that theory, four members of The Times' editorial staff in Orange 
County saved credit card applications they received during a 1 month period. 
</P>
<P>
The total was 16 -- an average of four per address -- although one staff member 
who had recently purchased a home got a few more than the others. 
</P>
<P>
Those four households also received 11 applications for pre-approved, unsecured 
personal loans as well as credit card solicitations from five retail stores. 
</P>
<P>
The total credit offered exceeded $100,000. Several of the cards had no stated 
credit limit, so it was hard to judge exactly how much more could have been 
borrowed had there been a concerted effort to milk the maximum amount of money. 
</P>
<P>
As it was, no one applied for any of the cards or credit lines: existing debts, 
plus the county's sky-high housing expenses, kept all of them insolvent enough 
without adding to the load. 
</P>
<P>
But if they had tried: 
</P>
<P>
* They could have bought new cars (ranging from about 15 Hyundais to 1 
stripped-down Ferrari). 
</P>
<P>
* They could have used the various cash advances to raise funds for the down 
payment on a house or a small business. 
</P>
<P>
* They could have spruced up their wardrobes until their designer labels had 
designer labels of their own. 
</P>
<P>
* They could have financed a group trip to Europe or tossed one heck of a party 
in Tahiti. 
</P>
<P>
* And then they could have joined the estimated 6,000 people in Orange County 
who will seek professional help this year to break the credit habit and climb 
out from under the pile of debt that has buried them.
