Cold Harbour By Jack Higgins (Simon &amp; Schuster: $19.95; 318 pages. 
</P>
<P>
Open the pages of "Cold Harbour" and you're a goner for the next five hours. 
Jack Higgins takes you back to World War II, Europe before D-Day, when all the 
women wore red lipstick and silk stockings, when every uniform on every side 
was utterly becoming. 
</P>
<P>
It was a time, when, as a matter of course, everybody thought to be dressed up 
like somebody else, so that, for instance, Craig Osborne, our American 
intelligence hero, gets to dress up for a daring rescue, "immaculate in the 
black dress uniform of a lieutenant colonel in the French Charlemagne Brigade 
of the Waffen SS." 
</P>
<P>
And who's Craig rescuing costumed like that (a damsel locked up in the Chateau 
de Voincourt, in occupied France, at a shindig for Gen. Rommel himself)? Who's 
in big trouble in her clinging gown? Genevieve Trauvance, who, up until a week 
ago, was drably doing good deeds in England, but, due to the overriding 
necessity for the English to win the war, has been shipped over to France to 
impersonate her hard-hearted, ruthless, double-agent twin sister, Anne-Marie 
Trauvance, putative heir to the Chateau, and the title of Countess, and 
whatever else there is around in the way of woods and livestock, and all 
because Anne-Marie was born 11 minutes earlier than Genevieve. 
</P>
<P>
But Anne-Marie has been put out of commission by either a band of marauding 
Nazi sex-fiends, or a double-agent, mad-scientist, allegedly working for our 
side, who may have overdosed her on a brand-new truth serum they hadn't quite 
got the kinks out of yet. . . . 
</P>
<P>
How do Genevieve Trauvance and Craig Osborne get from England over to the 
French Coast so that they can socialize with Gen. Rommel at the chateau? Well, 
a very nice man called Martin Hare, (who's already been through hell in the 
Solomon Islands), is recruited by a ruthless, English sociopath to run a 
captured German "Fast Boat" in which the whole English crew wears German 
uniforms, and speaks fluent German, including Martin Hare who also speaks 
fluent German, because his mother was German, and every character in this book 
is fluent in two and usually three languages, so fluent, that no one ever says, 
"Isn't that an American accent you've got there (or German, English, French)?" 
</P>
<P>
Add to all this a pretty little village in Cornwall where every English man and 
woman is dressed up like a German, and the food is magnificent because of a 
wonderful little trooper named Julie who makes steak and kidney pie for the 
English officers, and pate and rack of lamb for the French, and every room in 
this lovely coastal town is "very pleasant," with floor-to-ceiling book 
shelves, and expensive Chinese rugs, and molded plaster ceilings, and pianos 
where Genevieve Trauvance can sit down and belt out "Claire de Lune" with 
feeling, and you've got a pretty special setup. 
</P>
<P>
It's World War II. And everybody actually does go around saying, "I know you! 
Class of Harvard, '39!" Who wouldn't want to live in that world? Where can we 
sign up? It doesn't even matter what side we're on, because we'll be dressing 
up like the other side anyway! 
</P>
<P>
Now, Jack Higgins is sure to remind us every 10 pages or so that war is hell. 
There's Anne-Marie Trauvance, for instance, totally twigged and out of her 
gourd, locked up in the nursing home basement. And our hero's fingernails have 
grown in all crooked because the Huns pulled them out with pliers the last time 
he was in prison. But, listen! Anne-Marie broke Genevieve's thumb in two places 
with a nutcracker when they were both 13 and that was peacetime, and they were 
both girls, so the main thing to do is find yourself some friends and stay away 
from sociopaths of any strike, like the odious Hans Reichslinger, that Nazi 
scum, but also Lt. Joe Edge, allegedly on our side, but a homicidal 
rapist-maniac with a bad personality, so that people are always saying to him: 
"You're an unpleasant little swine, aren't you, Joe?" and "You really are a 
rather unpleasant little rat at heart, aren't you, Joe?" But Joe gets his own 
back, and by the end, people are sorry they talked trash about him. 
</P>
<P>
It would be uncool and Philistine to admit liking this book, and I wouldn't 
want to do that. I will say I only got up off the couch twice during the five 
hours I read it, to get some tangerines, to keep body and soul together.

Subway Sultan: Adnan Khashoggi, the Saudi wheeler-dealer once considered the 
richest man in the world, was just another subway straphanger in New York last 
week. Khashoggi took the subway home after making one of his twice-a-week 
visits to federal authorities, fulfilling a requirement of his bail while 
awaiting trial for fraud with Imelda Marcos. A reporter asked him if he was 
interested in buying New York, and Khashoggi responded: "Is it for sale?"

On Friars' Menu: As if there haven't been enough jokes about her, Zsa Zsa Gabor 
has agreed to be roasted by the Friars Club at the Beverly Hilton in May. 
Actually, Milton Berle, who will be master of ceremonies, says the occasion 
will be more like "the modern version of Joan of Arc burning at the stake" than 
a roast. "We plan to send a limousine for her so she doesn't have to drive in 
Beverly Hills," Berle said. Gabor, who was convicted last year of slapping a 
Beverly Hills policeman, says she hopes her Friars friends won't be "too rough" 
on her. 
</P>
<P>
Book Bound: There is speculation in Washington that there will soon be a Marion 
Barry book. Just three days after the mayor was arrested at the Vista Hotel, 
his lawyer-agents Ron Goldfarb and Carol Randolph were up early making calls to 
see if there was any interest in a book. Stephen Rubin, president of Doubleday, 
said Thursday that he had talked with Goldfarb, but he has to talk to the mayor 
first. "I'm not buying air. . . . It's simply an idea," said Marie Arana-Ward, 
a Simon &amp; Schuster vice president and senior editor, who also talked with 
Goldfarb. "The question is whether he will write it, or even wants to write 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Almost Legal: John F. Kennedy Jr. is getting his first taste of crime-busting. 
Kennedy, 29, an assistant district attorney in New York City, helped with the 
investigation that led to the arrests of five travel agency workers accused of 
laundering money for drug dealers. The son of President John F. Kennedy won't 
be able to prosecute the suspects in court because he failed the bar exam in 
his first try last year. He's scheduled to take the test again next month.

DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: BANKROLL, SEX STYLE RELATED? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JOYCE BROTHERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: Both my husband and I are very generous with money so we're 
surprised that our 17-year-old son is so cautious with his spending. His father 
says that he saves almost everything and has built up quite a bank account. For 
the past year, he's had only one girlfriend and he seems as cautious about 
women as he is about his money. What does this mean? -- V.R. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR V.R.: What you're describing isn't necessarily bad. There does seem to be 
some relationship between fidelity and closeness with money. Psychotherapist 
Rosemarie Schultz, who wrote the book "Sex and Money: Strange Bedfellows," says 
that the way a person handles his bankroll is frequently the way he handles his 
sex life. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, careful spenders are equally cautious about the selection of their 
sex partners, while big spenders may use less discretion and are more likely to 
be unfaithful. 
</P>
<P>
There are just two points, however, that I'd like to make. One, it's generally 
a good idea for young people to date a number of different people before going 
steady, because this is one of the ways in which they learn about themselves. 
And two, it would be a good idea to teach your son to be compassionate and 
generous toward those who have less than he. Empathy and generosity toward the 
less fortunate needs to be taught. Too much thrift can soon become greed. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: I guess because my wife was left alone a lot as a child, she 
won't leave our baby's side for a moment. But I would like my wife to attend 
social functions with me related to my work. Is it necessary to be with an 
infant every moment? -- G.B. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR G.B.: No. It's healthier to have some separation. Of course, babies need 
round-the-clock care and nurturing, but this doesn't mean that the mother or 
father have no time to themselves. The child's legitimate needs should be 
filled as soon as possible, but there are also times when the baby should be 
left alone to sleep in her own crib or to play by herself. 
</P>
<P>
During the first three or four months, it's a good idea for the baby to sleep 
in the parents' room, but after that it's fine for him to sleep in a room 
nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Little children need to get used to the idea that when mother leaves the room 
or the house she'll return later. If the baby cries, that's fine. This is a 
part of growing up and the fact that mother does return is one of the ways the 
child builds a sense of faith and trust. 
</P>
<P>
Parents need time off for their health, as well as their child's. Encourage 
your wife to go with you. Find a responsible substitute to care for your baby.

PROTEST ERUPTS INTO SHOUTING MATCH; 
</P>
<P>
MIGRANTS: NORTH COUNTY RESIDENTS CLASH WITH LATINO DEMONSTRATORS AT SITE OF 
ALLEGED KIDNAPING OF MIGRANT WORKER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Escalating tensions between Latin American immigrant laborers and the mostly 
non-Latino population of northern San Diego County were bared in public Sunday 
when demonstrators shouting anti-racist slogans faced off with area residents 
at a Carlsbad store where a migrant worker was allegedly kidnaped and beaten 
early this month. 
</P>
<P>
The long-planned event, held under the watchful eyes of Carlsbad police, went 
off peacefully under clear skies and a searing sun. 
</P>
<P>
However, a dramatic and ugly shouting match erupted between the mostly Latino 
marchers and about a dozen non-Latino residents who staged a 
counterdemonstration at the Country Grocery Store on El Camino Real. The 
establishment, which has a huge plastic chicken on its roof, is the site where 
Candido Galloso Salas, a Mexican worker, was allegedly handcuffed, detained and 
and beaten by the store's proprietor and his brother. 
</P>
<P>
That widely publicized incident -- now the subject of local police and FBI 
inquiries, along with a civil suit -- appears to have galvanized the mostly 
unorganized migrant laborers and their supporters, both Latino and non-Latino. 
Sponsors expressed hope that Sunday's demonstration would catalyze better 
organization among North County's huge number of immigrant workers, most of 
whom are from Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
As the chanting marchers, numbering about 200, filed by the store, some of the 
waiting residents shouted anti-immigrant comments; several non-Latinos 
accompanying the marchers were derided as "wetback lovers." 
</P>
<P>
"Go home!" one counterdemonstrator shouted continuously at the marchers. 
</P>
<P>
The pro-migrant demonstrators retorted in English and Spanish, deriding the 
residents as racistas -- racists. 
</P>
<P>
"These workers make the food you eat," one man screamed at the residents 
gathered in the front entrance of the store. "You should thank God that they 
are here." 
</P>
<P>
The confrontation, which lasted about 15 minutes, offered insight into the deep 
divisions prevalent in North County, where thousands of migrant laborers live 
in crude dwellings amid the brush, often in the shadow of luxurious suburban 
homes worth $250,000 or more. Pro-immigrant groups have long accused local 
governments and residents of malevolent apathy or hostility toward the workers. 
They say violence against immigrants is on the rise, as evidenced by the recent 
Carlsbad incident. 
</P>
<P>
"They want the people to work and then disappear like a disposable cup," said 
the Rev. Rafael Martinez, a Protestant minister who heads a chaplaincy in the 
fields. 
</P>
<P>
The pro-immigrant demonstrators said they were seeking basic human rights -- 
decent housing, freedom from physical and verbal abuse, and an end to racism 
directed at workers. "We're just asking for justice," said Algimiro Morales, 
one of the leaders of the Mixtec People's Civic Committee, one of the event's 
organizers. 
</P>
<P>
"It is our dark hands and sore backs that plant and cultivate these fields," 
said a written statement from the group, whose name derives from the many 
laborers who are Mixtec Indians, from Mexico's Oaxaca state. "We ask for your 
help for better housing." 
</P>
<P>
But non-Latino residents who staged the counterprotest said they were fed up 
with the immigrant laborers, whom they blame for a wide range of problems, from 
trash on their lawns to trespassing on their properties to more violent crimes. 
</P>
<P>
"I've watched this get worse and worse," Reinette Thurman shouted excitedly as 
she traded verbal volleys with the demonstrators. "Where are our rights? They 
come into my home and steal from me. I've seen them walk into this store and 
steal. Once I saw four of them open cans of Coke and just start drinking it 
without paying. . . . Where's the Border Patrol?" 
</P>
<P>
Michael Haggerty, a Carlsbad electrician, stood beneath a U.S. flag at the 
entrance to the market carrying a sign urging employers not to hire foreign 
labor. He wore a hand-made button indicating his disfavor for "illegals." 
</P>
<P>
"If nobody hired 'em, they wouldn't get any jobs and they'd just go home," 
Haggerty explained after a heated exchange with the demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce Stiffler, a 23-year area resident, spoke of what she characterized as a 
growing crime problem that she blamed on the immigrant work force. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very menacing," Stiffler said as she rocked her infant grandchild in a 
carriage. "They (the laborers) used to be very low key. Now we're getting the 
stabbings, the theft. . . . One of them chased me around my driveway a few 
years ago. They were just squatting in my yard . . . three of them very drunk. 
After I ran away from them, they ran into my neighbor's driveway and broke a 
bottle. . . . My daughter walks to the store and she's subject to these 
catcalls." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently not present at the march was Candido Galloso Salas, the migrant 
worker who was allegedly kidnaped and attacked early this month by Rickey 
Ryberg, proprietor of the Country Grocery Store, and his brother, Randy. An 
investigator for Marco E. Lopez, the San Diego lawyer who represents Galloso 
Salas, said he served Rickey Ryberg Sunday with a civil suit that was filed 
last week in U.S. District Court in San Diego. The Rybergs have denied any 
wrongdoing in the case.

EARTH DAY IS BACK TO FACE GROWING CHALLENGES, DANGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the first Earth Day in 1970, Jeanne Davies remembers, students at Monte 
Vista High School in Spring Valley set out to save the world. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of holding classes on that sunny April day, Davies and her fellow Monte 
Vista teachers organized an environmental symposium. Teen-agers wearing green 
armbands sat outside on the lawn, listening to speakers talk about air 
pollution, energy conservation and the dangers of urban sprawl. 
</P>
<P>
By day's end, Davies recalls, "The students pointed fingers and said, 'You've 
ruined the world for us.' And they decided they would take over Spring Valley. 
We drew up traffic patterns, parks, a whole plan for the future. Everyone was 
going to go out and save the wilderness, plan cities as they should be planned, 
cut down on fuel use." 
</P>
<P>
Two decades later, as San Diego prepares to celebrate the 20th anniversary of 
Earth Day, Davies looks back fondly on that idealistic afternoon. But in the 
face of today's pressing problems -- a troublesome list that includes ozone 
depletion, deforestation and global warming -- her nostalgia is tempered by 
what she describes as an urgent need for action. 
</P>
<P>
"Had we gone on from 1970 in our thinking, we wouldn't be in the mess that we 
are in today," said Davies, who has retired from teaching and now chairs the 
San Diego Sierra Club's recycling committee. "The problems have changed, but 
we're fighting the same battle. Where are my students today?" 
</P>
<P>
Beginning this week, a consortium of local environmental groups, colleges and 
businesses will kick off a series of environmentally minded events intended to 
inspire San Diegans to make a new commitment to protect the planet. The 12 
weeks of events, which include a speakers series, concerts and a San Diego Bay 
cleanup, will culminate on the 20th anniversary, April 22, in a daylong Earth 
Fair in Balboa Park. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers and sponsors of the events say they are taking advantage of what one 
political aide calls "a mainstreaming of the environmental movement." 
</P>
<P>
"The environment is not just something for the '60s radicals anymore. It's for 
everyone," said Cynthia Vicknair, executive assistant to San Diego City 
Councilwoman Judy McCarty, who is seeking to set aside a portion of the April 
16 council docket for environmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
Today, in an attempt to build local interest, a private reception and media 
conference will be held aboard the schooner Invader. During a tour of the San 
Diego Bay, invited guests will sail past the damaged oil tanker Exxon Valdez 
and will hear from Norman L. Dean, the National Wildlife Federation's legal 
director, who is preparing to sue Exxon for the damage wrought by the tanker's 
1989 oil spill off Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
Later, at a reception at Reidy O'Neil's Irish Bar and American Grill in 
downtown San Diego, Dean will speak on what many say is the most important 
thrust of this year's celebration: "Individual Responsibility: Creating 
Environmental Change." (Those interested in attending the reception from 6-8 
p.m. should make a reservation by Monday morning by calling Carolyn Chase at 
488-6116). 
</P>
<P>
Gaye Soroka, executive director of I Love a Clean San Diego County Inc. and one 
of San Diego Earth Day 1990's organizers, believes one of the flaws of the 1970 
demonstration was that it emphasized legislative action without stressing how 
individuals can make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
The legislative victories that followed that first Earth Day were great: a 
tough new Clean Air Act was passed with only a handful of dissenting votes in 
both houses of Congress; the Clean Water Act was passed. That same year, the 
federal Environmental Protection Agency was established. 
</P>
<P>
But Soroka, who marched in an Earth Day demonstration in Philadelphia in 1970, 
said she believes that many of the 20-million Americans who participated across 
the country went home with the mistaken impression that protecting the 
environment was solely the government's responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a giant rally, we marched and listened to political speakers and bands, 
lay in the sun and drank a lot of beer," said Soroka, who was a college 
sophomore at the time. "We signed petitions and then went home. It didn't get 
anywhere because it wasn't personalized." 
</P>
<P>
The challenge for Soroka and other Earth Day 1990 organizers, she believes, is 
to make this year's celebration a practical "call to action." 
</P>
<P>
"What has to happen is that people say, 'I have to fix it.' That's the critical 
thing. If we allow ourselves to be ignorant of where our elected officials 
stand, if we don't sort our trash, if we don't pay attention to the products 
and packages we buy or . . . if we pour our used oil down a storm drain -- then 
we're just as guilty" as industrial polluters that are regulated by the 
government, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Soroka says she realizes part of the key is to educate San Diegans not only 
about global problems but about local solutions. 
</P>
<P>
"To hear the words 'ozone depletion' doesn't tell me what I can do to help," 
she said, adding that this year's events, many of which are still being 
planned, will attempt to give San Diegans concrete suggestions -- from beach 
cleanups to recycling to tree-planting to environmentally conscious grocery 
shopping -- about what can be done to solve environmental problems. 
</P>
<P>
To provide an incentive for local businesses to get involved, the local Sierra 
Club chapter has commissioned a poster that promotes the 1990s as the "Decade 
of the Environment." The limited edition commemorative poster, which features 
endangered species like the California brown pelican and the San Diego horned 
lizard, is available for use by local businesses that create pro-environment 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
Greentree Grocers on Mount Acadia Blvd., for example, will sell the $12 poster 
at half price with the purchase of a reusable, canvas grocery bag -- an 
ecological substitute for paper or plastic sacks. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Ben &amp; Jerry's Hillcrest Scoop Shop has joined with the Sierra 
Club to promote the Environmental Protection Initiative, which would require 
oil spill prevention plans, reduced emissions of gases and regulation of 
pesticide use, among other things. The shop, which will display and sell the 
commemorative poster, is offering free ice cream cones to customers who bring 
in five registered voters' signatures on the initiative ballot. 
</P>
<P>
A broad-based campaign is also under way to get at least 100,000 San Diegans to 
sign the Earth Day Pledge, which reads in part, "I pledge to do my share for 
the planet by letting my concern for the environment shape how I: educate, 
join, purchase, work, vote (and) act." The signed pledges will be distributed 
to local politicians and tabulated nationally in an attempt to measure popular 
support for the environment. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, at the daylong Earth Fair in Balboa Park on April 22, educational 
booths, museum exhibits, art and entertainment will aim to increase San 
Diegans' environmental awareness. Included in the events will be a 5K/1-mile 
"Run for the Rain Forest" and an Earth Art Show sponsored by the San Diego Art 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Pre-Earth Day events that are open to the public include:

DISCOUNT REAL ESTATE AGENT SUES, ALLEGING SHE'S BEEN BLACKLISTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For years, real estate broker Jeannette Sharar was a team player and model 
member of her industry. The Santa Clarita Valley businesswoman was, and still 
is, a hospital fund-raiser, city planning commissioner and vice president of 
the valley's Chamber of Commerce. She even served on the local Board of 
Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
But today, this broker's broker finds herself in the unlikely role of consumer 
advocate. 
</P>
<P>
Sharar claims in an antitrust case pending in Los Angeles Superior Court that 
she and her agents are being blacklisted by two Realty World franchises for 
charging 2% commissions instead of the 6% rate considered customary. 
</P>
<P>
Her lawsuit, scheduled for trial March 5, focuses on the franchises' offers to 
pay her what the industry calls "punitive splits," or a lower commission than 
that which is offered to other brokers who might participate in a sale. 
</P>
<P>
By offering her only 1% of the total commission instead of the standard 3%, 
Sharar argues, her competitors are not only discriminating against her for her 
low rates but trying to discourage other brokers from following her example. 
Another effect of the lower commissions she is offered, Sharar said, is to 
discourage her agents from trying to sell her competitors' properties, 
lessening their opportunities to make sales. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not a multimillionaire, not by a long shot," Sharar said recently as she 
gestured toward the comfortable but modest home in Newhall she shares with four 
daughters. "I'm doing this because I believe in the principle." 
</P>
<P>
Sharar said her practice has been to charge market-rate commissions when a 
client chooses to use the conventional, multiple-listing service and its broad 
exposure, and to charge the lower 2% rate to customers willing to rely on the 
work of her staff alone. 
</P>
<P>
She said that since employing "the 2% solution," as she advertises the lower 
commission, her 17-agent firm has been the victim of harassing phone calls, a 
campaign of false and discrediting rumors and stolen signs. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit has already cost her $24,000 and could rack up another $30,000 in 
lawyer's fees if the case goes to an appeal, Sharar said. Complicating the 
legal fight has been a battle against inoperable cancer. Doctors have told her 
the prognosis is grim. 
</P>
<P>
Industry representatives dismiss Sharar's case as an isolated example of 
friction between two competitors. In today's high-priced real estate market, 
they contend, discount brokers are well accepted and fees are readily 
negotiable. Even if Sharar proves her allegations, they said, she will only 
affirm existing laws that prohibit group boycotts and price-fixing. 
</P>
<P>
"A 6% commission rate is no longer that prevalent. All kinds of rates are in 
effect, and the market dictates what they will be," said William M. Pfeiffer, 
vice president and general counsel for the California Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
"If her case can be proven, we are on record as condemning such behavior. I 
think it would be an aberrational case. I don't think it's something that would 
happen with any frequency," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But consumer advocates said Sharar's case is important because -- despite what 
Pfeiffer and other industry spokesmen said -- discount brokers remain industry 
pariahs. Even if the case breaks no new legal ground, they said, a victory 
would encourage other brokers to lower rates and would ultimately help 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
"The real estate community will do anything it can to prevent that sort of 
break-away-from-the-pack kind of behavior," said Carlyle Hall, an attorney for 
the Center for Law in the Public Interest in West Los Angeles. "You have to 
have a great deal of courage to be a discount broker and offer substantial 
discounts." 
</P>
<P>
Gail Hillebrand, an attorney for the San Francisco-based Consumers Union, the 
publisher of Consumer Reports, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"If you talk to homeowners and ask them how much they paid, 99.5% paid 6%," 
Hillebrand said. "Discount brokerage has been legal a long time in California, 
but it hasn't really taken off. . . . There has been continued resistance in 
the industry to negotiated fees." 
</P>
<P>
Sharar said she began charging her controversial commission in 1986 when she 
was hired to help relocate 150 managers of a pharmaceutical company and found 
few homes available. She thought potential sellers might be prodded to put 
their homes on the market if assured that less of their profit would end up in 
agents' pockets. 
</P>
<P>
Sharar and her family said the "2% solution" was not just a clever gimmick. 
They said it is an understandable outgrowth of the family's strict, privileged 
upbringing by a father they described as a nonconformist, highly ethical oil 
driller. 
</P>
<P>
"My father was a great man, a man of principle," said Sharar, who said she 
thinks it is immoral to charge 6% commissions on homes that often cost more 
than $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
The M'Closkeys lived in a Beverly Hills mansion, and Sharar and her sisters 
attended exclusive, Catholic girls schools. But Sharar's rebelliousness was 
demonstrated early when she managed to get herself expelled from two academies 
picked by her parents so she could attend a more progressive school of her own 
choice. She later scandalized her family by holding a variety of jobs until she 
married at the then-late age of 27. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Sharar's struggle against convention is competing with her struggle 
against cancer. Although she recently sold her real estate company, Sharar 
Associates, she remains its director and head broker and works out of her home. 
</P>
<P>
News of Sharar's illness drew nearly 400 people to a dinner in her honor 
earlier this month, and a series of tributes fleshed out a portrait of a moral 
maverick. Ruth Newhall, the well-known former local newspaper editor, recalled 
that when Sharar won $10,000 in a charity raffle, she gave half back to the 
charity and half to Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital, where she is a board 
member. 
</P>
<P>
Newhall said Sharar's antitrust case has caused a stir in the rapidly growing 
community, where land development and real estate are the chief industry, but 
that many are privately rooting for her. 
</P>
<P>
"In this time when so many real estate people are making, if not million-dollar 
commissions then million-dollar incomes, it naturally did win a few hearts to 
see someone who was going to say, 'In this great boom time, let us not be so 
greedy. Let us . . . make it easier for the buyer.' That was the message she 
communicated," Newhall said. 
</P>
<P>
Under state and federal laws, real estate commissions are supposed to be 
negotiated deal by deal and local boards of realtors -- the groups that publish 
and control multiple-listing services -- are prohibited from telling brokers 
what to charge. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, said Hillebrand and Hall, those laws remain academic when a majority of 
brokers won't substantially lower their fees. 
</P>
<P>
The chief defendant in Sharar's lawsuit -- broker Marcia Gaskill and two Realty 
World franchises she owns in the Santa Clarita Valley -- indicated within the 
multiple-listing service that Sharar Associates, Help-U-Sell and another 
discount firm would receive split commissions of 1% if they helped sell homes 
she listed. Higher splits were offered to "all others." Gaskill also wrote 
Sharar a letter in September, 1988, with a blanket offer of 1% splits on all 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
Although brokers are permitted to negotiate how commissions will be split and 
to deal with individual competitors as they please, industry rules prohibit 
blanket punitive splits or the publishing of punitive splits in the 
multiple-listing service. 
</P>
<P>
After Sharar sued Gaskill and the Santa Clarita Valley Board of Realtors for 
publishing Gaskill's footnotes, the board quickly agreed to correct the 
practice and was dropped from the case. 
</P>
<P>
Sharar claims Gaskill has continued to send her letters informing her that she 
would be offered split commissions of only 1% on specified properties. That 
practice is permitted under industry rules -- unless Sharar can prove it is 
being done to discriminate against her. 
</P>
<P>
Gaskill referred questions to her attorney, David L. Candaux of Encino, and 
Candaux declined to discuss the case. 
</P>
<P>
In documents filed with the court, Candaux wrote: "This is, in essence, the 
story of how a predatory pricer . . . got 'hoisted on her own petard.' " 
</P>
<P>
He wrote that Sharar expected to "enjoy the best of both worlds" by charging 
only 2% commissions on sales made exclusively by her office, while also 
participating in the multiple-listing service and benefiting from market-rate 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
Hall said Sharar deserves credit for her effort, regardless of its outcome. 
</P>
<P>
"This industry is the same old dinosaur trying to protect its turf and its high 
commissions," he said. "Here's one more person who was trying to buck the 
system and had to go to court. It's ridiculous."

KEEPING OUR EYES ON THE ERADICATION GOAL; 
</P>
<P>
MEDFLY: REASONABLE PEOPLE CAN QUESTION SPRAYING. BUT RATHER THAN GIVE IN TO THE 
BUG, WE MUST PERSUADE THESE OBJECTORS THAT THE RISK IS VERY LOW.

At the height of the Santa Clara County Medfly War in the early 1980s, an 
entomologist stirred up a storm by questioning whether the pest could be 
eradicated. Now another entomologist has expressed those same doubts about the 
current effort in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Make no doubt about it, a UC Berkeley entomologist knows a thousand times more 
about the science of entomology than most of us. So did the entomologist who 
questioned the Santa Clara eradication effort. But history shows that the Santa 
Clara infestation was eradicated and the entomologist was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
There are many differences and similarities between the current Medfly battle 
and the one in Northern California nearly a decade ago. Scientists can be found 
on both sides of the issue. Some contend that you can win; others aren't so 
sure. This is the nature of science, and it has become one of the most 
frustrating parts of the ongoing food safety debate. Science is inexact and 
ever changing. 
</P>
<P>
But there is a consensus on one thing -- that rhetoric and fear have no place 
in determining public policy regarding pesticides. The Natural Resources 
Defense Council was irresponsible in scaring and confusing the public about the 
pesticide Alar and apples. A person would have to eat more than 28,000 pounds 
of Alar-treated apples every day for 70 years to approach the exposure levels 
that produce ill effects in the laboratory. We need to be aware that our 
interpretation of facts, based on our own experience and biases, will be 
different from the interpretation of someone who has decided to make a living 
exploiting the public's concern for the environment. Somewhere in the middle is 
the public, not sure which scientist or which special-interest group to 
believe. 
</P>
<P>
Critics are correct when they note that what is regarded as safe now may turn 
out to be dangerous later. What they don't say is that some risk is necessary, 
or more correctly, inevitable and we should try our hardest to deal with it. 
</P>
<P>
Many people don't agree with the UC Berkeley entomologist and others whose 
"doubts are growing" over the potential success of the current eradication 
efforts. These same people might listen to Roy Cunningham, who chairs the 
state's Medfly scientific advisory panel and is a veteran of infestation 
battles in California and elsewhere. He is "confident" the Medfly can be 
eradicated. Cunningham is not alone in his optimism. A UC Davis entomologist 
agrees with him. 
</P>
<P>
Aerial application of the malathion syrup over populated areas has been 
accepted as as a necessary means of eradication since the Santa Clara 
situation. The big loser there was not the public but former Gov. Edmund G. 
Brown Jr., who originally opposed the spraying. 
</P>
<P>
Still, one cannot blame some residents for expressing concern when the 
helicopter flies over, not once, but several times. They are confused and 
rightly concerned. Then you have the opportunists and others who move in to 
grab headlines and notoriety by feeding on those fears. They choose not to 
accept the latest studies, also from the Santa Clara experience, which 
disclosed no increase in health problems or birth defects after the Medfly 
battle there. 
</P>
<P>
Learning to live with the Medfly is not an acceptable alternative to 
agriculture or the rest of California. Those who believe such cohabitation is 
possible miss the real environmental concern -- the increase in pesticide use 
that would have to be made in the back yards of Southern Californians to allow 
them to grow their avocados and tomatoes and all the other myriad fruits and 
vegetables that are favored by home gardeners. Add to that the increased 
application that would be required in commercial agriculture, and you have a 
good reason to resolve to fight the Medfly, not learn to live with it. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly there are people in Southern California vehemently opposed to the 
current Medfly eradication effort. Many of them are reasonable people. We must 
persuade them that the risks, real or imagined, are so low, so remote that 
eradication is the only logical course.

A SOLITARY SYMBOL IN A DEADLY TUG OF WAR; 
</P>
<P>
EXECUTION: FOR POLITICIANS AND LAWYERS ON BOTH SIDES, ROBERT ALTON HARRIS' FATE 
IS OF CRITICAL SIGNIFICANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANKLIN E. ZIMRING, Franklin E. Zimring is a professor of law and director 
of the Earl Warren Legal Institute at UC Berkeley. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robert Alton Harris moved a step closer to the California history books this 
month when the U.S. Supreme Court rejected the fourth appeal of his death 
sentence. If Harris' further appeals fail to win him a significant delay, he 
could be executed by this summer for killing two teen-agers in San Diego 12 
years ago. His would be the first execution in California in 23 years. It would 
also probably be the last in the state through the first term of its next 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
That Harris is likely to be the first person executed in California in more 
than two decades is more widely known than the fact that his execution will be 
an isolated event. Yet it is Harris' distance from our next execution as well 
as from our last one that makes this case statistically and politically 
special. 
</P>
<P>
Harris' lonely path to the threshold of the gas chamber is a mix of 
misadventure and chance. He was convicted of a double murder committed soon 
after a new death-penalty law came into effect. The killing of more than one 
victim is considered an aggravating circumstance that generates eligibility for 
a death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Yet these facts hardly guarantee either a death sentence or an execution. More 
than 2,500 Californians were victims of criminal homicide during the year of 
Harris' crime, and hundreds of these killings qualified for the death sentence. 
But nine out of 10 killers who could be tried on a capital charge do not stand 
trial for their lives. Instead, they plead guilty to lesser charges, as Robert 
Harris' co-defendant -- his brother -- did in this case. Prosecutors who 
strongly support the death penalty engage in, rather than disapprove of, this 
kind of bargain justice. So perhaps one out of every 100 California killers 
receives a death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Next, a death sentence and an execution are two different things. More than 350 
Californians have spent time under death sentences since 1979, yet only Harris 
stands any immediate risk of execution. 
</P>
<P>
Why? His murder trial was more carefully conducted than the error-filled 
extravaganzas that occur in many death cases, and an appeal was promptly heard 
and decided by the California Supreme Court before a glut of death cases 
inundated that court. The Harris case left the state courts to begin its 
labyrinthine progress through the federal appeals process nine years ago. Later 
convictions, caught in the glut of death-penalty appeals, are years behind 
Harris'. 
</P>
<P>
That is why the Harris case is of critical significance to politicians and to 
lawyers on both sides. If Harris is reprieved, it may be four or five years 
before another execution is at hand. 
</P>
<P>
For many of the death penalty's staunchest supporters, including Gov. George 
Deukmejian, Harris must die soon if the death penalty is to make a comeback on 
their political watch. 
</P>
<P>
For the next round of gubernatorial hopefuls, Harris may be less trouble if he 
is dead than if he is alive, because his execution this year could provide a 
full term without execution pressure. More delay in the Harris case might put 
terrible pressure on the next governor. It might not qualify as a chapter in 
"Profiles in Courage," but candidates Pete Wilson, Dianne Feinstein and John 
Van de Kamp may be wishing Deukmejian speedy success in this matter for rather 
selfish reasons. 
</P>
<P>
The Harris case is also of special significance to a group of lawyers that has 
grown middle-aged together in the tug-of-war surrounding capital punishment in 
California. Death-penalty cases are the Super Bowl of criminal litigation, so 
it is no surprise that many of the lawyers who have spent years in the district 
attorney's and state attorney general's offices view an actual execution as the 
only victory that can compensate their efforts. There really is a "death 
penalty team" at work in California, as well as a "no-executions team." Each 
side takes the outcome in the Harris case very seriously. It is, oddly, as much 
their war as the defendants'. 
</P>
<P>
So if an execution comes to California in People vs. Robert Harris, at center 
stage will be issues of the symbolism of capital punishment and of lawyerly 
competition far removed from the moral turpitude of this defendant. There is a 
curious sense in which one could say that if the execution comes to pass, Mr. 
Harris should not take it personally.

THERE'S NO 'BREED FROM HELL'; 
</P>
<P>
DOGS: PIT BULLS ARE THE CURRENT VILLAINS, BUT THE BREEDERS, NOT THE ANIMALS, 
ARE THE PROBLEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANE CALKINS, Diane Calkins is a reserve animal-control officer with San 
Diego County. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fatal maulings by pit bulls have occurred often enough in recent years to seem 
almost commonplace. Equally common and predictable are the reactions of 
everyone concerned. 
</P>
<P>
Politicians, such as Los Angeles County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn and Gov. George 
Deukmejian, talk of an outright ban on pit bulls, and the dog lobby reacts with 
an immediate campaign against such legislation. 
</P>
<P>
The news media slavishly recount the gruesome details of the latest attack, and 
the public clamors for something, anything, to prevent such atrocities. 
</P>
<P>
I am a reserve animal-control officer, a dog owner and a writer about dogs 
(including pit bulls), and this latest killing leaves me with an eerie sense of 
deja vu. 
</P>
<P>
Marjee Lilly, a 70-year-old San Diego woman visiting her grandson's home in Los 
Angeles, was killed by his two dogs, young pit bull mixes. We'll probably never 
know why Vic and Chomper attacked her. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, Marjee Lilly's death calls for solutions beyond the usual lip 
service to good laws and platitudes about responsible pet ownership. 
</P>
<P>
First, though, we need a common understanding of the nature of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
The term "pit bull" has been used to identify a large population of registered 
and unregistered, purebred and mixed-breed dogs. Their ancestors were bred and 
raised to fight other animals. As such, most share a remarkably uncanine 
characteristic: They will fight to the bloody end and rarely warn of an 
impending attack. 
</P>
<P>
Just because they are genetically selected to fight other animals does not mean 
they present a danger to people. On the contrary, the old-time dogfighters bred 
their animals to be docile with humans. 
</P>
<P>
Those dogfighters may not be everyone's idea of the perfect gentlemen -- except 
when compared to the owners who emerged in the 1980s: the street-corner 
fighters, the drug dealers and the macho guys who want the meanest dog on the 
block. Backyard breeders, looking to make a quick buck, started mass-producing 
the dogs with no regard to temperament. 
</P>
<P>
No one can dispute the fact that pit bulls are over-represented in fatal 
attacks. From 1979 through 1988, at least 157 people were killed by dogs in the 
United States, and pit-bull breeds were involved in 41.6% of those fatal 
attacks, according to a study in the Journal of the American Medical Assn. 
Although there are no reliable statistics on the number of pit bulls, we know 
that those breeds do not account for anywhere near 40% of our canine 
population. 
</P>
<P>
In reality, though, the pit bull is just the latest breed to reap the spoils of 
over-popularity. In the 1960s and 1970s, guard and attack dogs became popular, 
and the wrong people wanted Doberman pinschers and German shepherds. Soon, 
German shepherds headed the list of dogs that killed. In this decade, there's a 
strong likelihood the Rottweiler will replace the pit bull as the media's dog 
from hell. 
</P>
<P>
One of the obvious solutions is to pass laws, but not those outlawing a new 
dangerous dog each decade. Both San Diego and Los Angeles recently passed model 
laws. In those cities, a dog can be impounded by animal control officers if it 
attacks or even shows a propensity to cause injury to humans (and in Los 
Angeles, other animals.) Enforcing the laws against dogfighting also helps. 
</P>
<P>
But laws and enforcement can do only so much. Dog owners must be held liable 
for the actions of their canine charges. In that regard, we have made strides. 
At least two people, including a California man, have been convicted of 
manslaughter after their pit bulls killed. 
</P>
<P>
But why stop there? Why not hold dog sellers, including pet stores, responsible 
as well? 
</P>
<P>
Dog-fanciers in other countries are ahead of Americans in recognizing the 
importance of canine temperament. For instance, in Mexico, a German shepherd 
must have proof of a sound temperament in order to have its championship 
recognized. Tests of temperament are available and are already used by 
law-enforcement agencies and other specialty trainers. 
</P>
<P>
Strong steps should at least be thoughtfully studied before we forget Marjee 
Lilly: 
</P>
<P>
* Demand that all breeding dogs have proof of sound temperament as well as 
proof that they are free of the ever-growing numbers of genetic defects showing 
up in purebred dogs. Concurrently, set up free clinics to encourage spaying and 
neutering of companion pets. 
</P>
<P>
* License dog breeders. Anyone wanting to produce puppies would have to prove 
knowledge of canine behavior, genetics and the importance of socializing young 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
* Establish minimum standards to help consumers identify first-class, 
well-socialized puppies, whose parents are sound in health and temperament. 
</P>
<P>
Well-bred, well-socialized dogs do not kill. We must take strong, creative 
action to avoid future pit bull (or Doberman or Rottweiler) incidents.

MAN KILLED ON FREEWAY AFTER VAN STALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORI GRANGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Van Nuys man was killed Sunday on the Antelope Valley Freeway moments after 
he got out of his stalled van and tried to repair it amid traffic, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The accident, in the northbound lanes about a mile south of San Fernando Road, 
backed up traffic for about two hours, said California Highway Patrol Officer 
Jim Kerr. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Acosta, 31, was crushed to death about 12:40 p.m. between his 1971 
rear-engine Volkswagen bus and a 1990 Mitsubishi pickup truck that slammed into 
it in the fifth lane of the six-lane freeway, Officer Joseph Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses told the CHP that after the van's engine began to smoke, Acosta, 
driving two lanes from the right shoulder, coasted about 100 feet before 
stopping, Kerr said. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like he had plenty of time to pull over to the shoulder, but failed 
to," Kerr said. 
</P>
<P>
Acosta opened his door, went to the back of the van and was trying to restart 
the engine when the truck crashed into the van at about 65 m.p.h., crushing 
Acosta and knocking his van about 40 feet, witnesses told CHP officers. 
</P>
<P>
The driver, 17-year-old Timothy Strother of Newhall, told authorities he had 
been driving in the fifth lane when a car in front of him swerved suddenly to 
avoid the van, leaving him no time to change lanes, Kerr said. 
</P>
<P>
Strother, who had been wearing his seat belt, was treated at Henry Mayo Newhall 
Hospital in Valencia for a fractured left arm and was later released, 
authorities said. He was not cited, authorities said.

JAPANESE CAR MAKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
James Risen's article "Why Can't America Catch Up?" (Part A, Jan. 14) strikes a 
familiar note. I know of a U.S. auto maker whose products lack "reliability and 
overall quality." 
</P>
<P>
I got royally stung. I was sold a vehicle by Ford whose paint began to fall off 
one year after purchase. It had been applied incorrectly at the factory, 
according to written testimony by numerous auto body technicians. Yet Ford 
refuses to correct the error. The board room executives of this company are 
more interested in profit margins and in buying up defunct savings and loans to 
gain huge tax advantages than in turning out quality products. Ford's slogan 
"quality is job one" is a sham and an insult to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
I was formerly a staunch buy-American advocate; now my dollar vote will go to 
Japanese auto makers. Wake up and catch up, American auto makers! Your 
existence depends on us, the consumers.

I'm sick and tired of reading so much about the superiority of the Japanese 
automobiles and that American cars have not caught up on quality. 
</P>
<P>
I for one feel the design and quality of the big three are as good as any 
foreign make. I've come back to buying American cars; I bought an '89 Mustang 
convertible last year and recently traded my Nissan for a Ford Ranger truck. 
I've come back -- I wish everyone would.

ANOTHER NIGHTMARE FOR HAITI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Haiti's military president, Gen. Prosper Avril, seems to be getting the message 
that other nations won't stand for his government's crackdown against political 
opponents. He's already promised to lift a 30-day state of siege just a week 
after imposing it. 
</P>
<P>
But it'll take more than that to persuade Haitians that Avril's not just 
another dictator on the make. 
</P>
<P>
Avril says that he acted to maintain order after a powerful military officer 
was assassinated, but the reaction was out of proportion. Dozens of moderate 
political leaders were arrested, some held in prison without charges and others 
exiled from the country. They include the man who wrote Haiti's new 
constitution after former dictator Jean Claude (Baby Doc) Duvalier was ousted 
in February, 1986. Others Avril exiled included two potential presidential 
candidates in the Haitian election slated for October -- which could be the 
first legitimate vote since Duvalier fled. 
</P>
<P>
Avril insists that the election will go on, but his crackdown looks 
suspiciously like an attempt to disrupt pre-electoral activities just as the 
opposition is getting itself organized. It has also fed a growing fear that 
Avril, who loyally served Duvalier, either wants the old regime to return or 
would like to install himself as a new dictator. 
</P>
<P>
That's why the United States is warning Avril that aid will be cut off unless 
civil liberties are restored -- and why France, Haiti's other major aid 
provider, has cut off aid. This is the tough but correct stance to take, and it 
should be maintained until every opposition leader is either out of detention 
or allowed back into the country to resume the work of turning Haiti into a 
real democracy.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: $150,000 FIRE HITS LODGE NEAR SAUGUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Authorities are investigating the cause of a fire that swept through the Big 
Oaks Lodge, causing $150,000 in damage to the century-old restaurant northeast 
of Saugus, authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The fire began about 4 a.m. Saturday and burned the restaurant, bar and kitchen 
of the two-story lodge at 33100 Bouquet Canyon Road in an isolated, woodsy area 
monitored by the U.S. Forest Service, Los Angeles County Fire Department 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
No one was in the dining areas, and the lodge's cabins and a training facility 
for boxers escaped the flames, Capt. Terry Holden said.

WE OIL ADDICTS ARE AT IT AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sadly, the United States now depends more on imported oil than at any time 
since 1977, with a rising share of it coming from the volatile Middle East. 
Fully 46% of the oil Americans consumed last year came from abroad, second only 
to the 47.7% level reached shortly before the Iranian revolution. That 
percentage will certainly increase as U.S. oil production continues to fall. 
Since 1987 domestic oil output has fallen by 1 million barrels a day; last year 
alone saw a 500,000-barrel decline. At this rate we'll be right back where we 
were: in a cycle of an ever more hopeless dependency on foreign sources for our 
energy needs. 
</P>
<P>
For a change, if only temporarily, rising demand isn't the problem. U.S. oil 
consumption last year was pretty flat, reports the American Petroleum 
Institute. The real supply problem is that domestic oil fields are running dry, 
while oil's relatively low price of recent years has discouraged the search for 
new sources. Proved U.S. oil reserves -- oil that can be profitably taken out 
of the ground using today's technology -- are now below 26 billion barrels. 
Contrast that with the 767 billion barrels held by the 13 members of OPEC. 
</P>
<P>
Oil at today's $22 a barrel or so is a bargain compared to the $35 and more of 
the early 1980s, but even bargains bought in excess can be an economic drain. 
Last year's imported oil bill, the Commerce Department reports, came to about 
$49 billion, accounting for about 44% of the trade deficit. This year it could 
be higher. Unrest in Azerbaijan, for example, is already disrupting Soviet oil 
exports, affecting world supplies and threatening to push up prices. 
</P>
<P>
Is there more domestic oil to be found? The most likely sources have long since 
been explored. What largely remains, or so say the oil industry and the Bush 
Administration, are fragile and expensive-to-develop areas off the coasts of 
California and Florida and Alaska's far-north Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. 
For now, though, Congress has barred drilling in these areas because of 
profound environmental concerns. At best, the prospect of significant new 
domestic oil finds is a distant one. What then? The government's Energy 
Information Administration projects that within 20 years imports will account 
for between 54% and 67% of U.S. consumption. To avoid costly over-reliance on 
foreign oil, demand simply must be restrained even more. 
</P>
<P>
That means, as everyone has known since the Arab oil embargo of 1973, that oil 
has to be used more efficiently and more sparingly. For all the progress made 
in the last 15 years, the United States still trails Japan and Western Europe 
in fuel efficiency, meaning that it still uses more energy than other developed 
countries to produce each new unit of economic growth. There's also room for 
improved conservation. For example, the technology exists to boost auto 
mileage; its use ought to be required. Each gallon of gasoline not burned eases 
air pollution, lessens the trade deficit and keeps money in drivers' pockets. 
</P>
<P>
There are a lot of ways to encourage greater energy efficiency and 
conservation, among them taxes and investment incentives. Why wait any longer 
to do so? The grim figures don't lie: The United States is already in the 
danger zone of oil imports, posing economic and political perils that can't be 
wished away.

COLISEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I'm sorry, but I just can't understand all the sentimental crying about 
remodeling the Los Angeles Coliseum (letters, Jan. 13). I suspect that those 
who are crying the loudest are people who never go there. 
</P>
<P>
The Coliseum is a 60-year-old stadium that needs more than the face lift it 
received prior to the 1984 Olympics, it needs major reconstructive surgery. The 
proposed remodeling, which would be done at no expense to the taxpayers, would 
transform the Coliseum from an outdated facility to a modern facility and would 
retain the east end peristyle that distinguishes the Coliseum from other 
stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
Remodeling the Coliseum would not only allow us to keep a valuable NFL 
franchise in Los Angeles (the Raiders), but it would enhance the South-Central 
area of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Please don't let sentiment stand in the way of progress or the Coliseum could 
become a seldom used monument to stupidity.

HELPING THE HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How pleased I was to read Norman Cousin's Op-Ed article ("The City That Would 
Give Shelter," Jan. 10). As one who has devoted the past 15 years with the 
homeless on Skid Row, I too have been troubled by the lack of imagination, 
ingenuity and initiative our community has demonstrated in its efforts to help 
those of our citizens who are forced to call the street their home. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, tangible support for the men, women and children of the streets from 
key executives and professionals within several of Los Angeles' most prominent 
corporations has renewed my faith in our community. Joining forces with John 
Singleton of Security Pacific Corp., these "movers and shakers" have set out to 
raise millions of dollars to build a state-of-the-art facility here in Los 
Angeles to stand as a national model in the treatment and restoration of the 
chronically homeless. 
</P>
<P>
These men and women, volunteer members of the URM Second Century Campaign, are 
generating "the collective will" to begin solving what has been regarded as a 
seemingly unsolvable problem. Together, they are out to establish Los Angeles 
as a passionate, prideful and national leader in addressing what President Bush 
has called "our national shame." 
</P>
<P>
Cousins and other concerned leaders like him will certainly be pleased, but 
more importantly should know that they, too, can join with us in this great 
endeavor.

MILLER AT ROYCE HALL: A PERSONAL VISION OF POSTMODERNISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES DANCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bebe Miller's best dances are at once physically engulfing and layered with 
insights: social portraits defined through the relationships between dancers. 
</P>
<P>
Her style proves distinctly contemporary in its incorporation of everything 
from gymnastically daring contact improvisation to pedestrian motion to the 
disarmingly elegant pointed toe. The attack remains propulsive and nonstop -- 
but the issues in question emerge in high relief. 
</P>
<P>
In "Allies," introduced locally on Friday at Royce Hall, UCLA, Miller suggests 
a more hopeful view of human contact than in "The Hell Dances," her 
full-evening study of incompatibility. Here, all the shifting linkups between 
individuals, the confrontations and manipulations, result in bonding. 
</P>
<P>
There are trios exploring contrasting male and female energies (and don't 
assume that the women come off looking lyrical). There's a romantic duet 
between Renee Lemiux and Jeremy Weichsel that begins in secret -- behind one of 
Robert Flynt's three billboard-size paintings on gauze -- but grows strong 
enough to survive inspection by the others. And there's a final statement of 
solidarity in which group acceptance becomes total, unthinking and a kind of 
armor. 
</P>
<P>
A throbbing score by Fred Frith helps sustain the pressure, but the investment 
of Miller's six-member cast makes her meanings explicit. As they ricochet from 
one intense, intimate encounter to another, these artists show how all 
relationships -- between friends, family, workers no less than between lovers 
-- reflect the same needs and strategies. 
</P>
<P>
In its antic standoffs and cozy images of togetherness (including, midway 
through, a company dress code), the familiar "Thick Sleep" offers a 
dream-reflection/reduction of the themes shaping "Allies." This time, however, 
the vocabulary stays gestural, the phrases brief and blunt, the emphasis upon 
playful discontinuity: body-squiggles of great difficulty (sometimes) but 
limited long-term satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
Lenny Pickett's blaring score and the costumes of Amy Downs (patches of color 
over black) brighten this scherzo to near-florescence but the cast's dynamism 
looks impersonal. Indeed, with its focus upon spatial/movement/costume design, 
"Thick Sleep" doesn't really need people; its bold, flat imagery and clever 
switcheroos would lose nothing in an animated cartoon. 
</P>
<P>
Completing the program, Miller's solo "Rain" finds her on or near a central 
platform of green turf, expressing her connection to the earth as an act of 
discovery. The isolation of the patch of green in an otherwise empty, dark 
space heightens the strangeness of the solo -- as does the lush, crimson gown 
that Miller wears. We are seeing someone coming to terms with realities 
understood but never experienced: an encounter full of tension and longing. 
</P>
<P>
Although arguably too small in scale for Royce Hall, "Rain" potently reaffirms 
several primal tenets in modern dance: the floor as the cradle of movement, 
personal growth as the essential subject of choreography.

Peace Painting Continues: More than 100 Greek and Turkish Cypriot artists in 
Nicosia, Cyprus, resumed work Sunday on two halves of a giant painting calling 
for peace that they plan to stretch 500 yards across the buffer zone dividing 
the island. The two groups continued to work on their respective sides of the 
dividing line after Turkish Cypriot authorities refused to allow the Turkish 
Cypriot painters to join their Greek Cypriot colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
The canvases include pictures of doves and olive branches and multicolored 
slogans declaring: "No More Violence," "Cyprus a Common Future," "Make Love Not 
War," and "Yes to Peace." The project began Jan. 21. The U.N.-patrolled zone 
has divided Nicosia and the rest of the island since a 1974 Turkish invasion 
resulted in partition. SHAUNA SNOW

Friars Club to Fry Zsa Zsa: Zsa Zsa Gabor will be roasted by the Friars Club in 
what organizers have promised will be a "no-holds barred" ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Milton Berle, president of the California Friars Club, said Gabor's roast, 
scheduled for May 14 at the Beverly Hilton, would be "the modern version of 
Joan of Arc burning at the stake." Berle, who will serve as master for the 
roast, said: "For all she has done for our community, it's time the community 
finally does something to her." His punch line: "We plan to send a limousine 
for her so she doesn't have to drive in Beverly Hills." SHAUNA SNOW

WAITING FOR SMOKE TO CLEAR IN MANEUVERING FOR KJOY

KJQY-FM(103.7) is a pawn in a complicated corporate chess game that probably 
won't be completed for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Although the deal that would have made Westwood One the station's new owner is 
off, New York financier Bob Sillerman's Command Communications has until Feb. 
15 to exercise its option to buy the station from Group W. 
</P>
<P>
The original plan was for Sillerman to turn around and sell his rights to 
"KJOY," a traditional ratings power with its elevator music format, to Westwood 
One for a total of $19 million, including $4 million in Westwood stock. In 
return, Command would buy Westwood One's 50% stake in WNEW-AM in New York. 
</P>
<P>
But Westwood One's stock has been spiraling downward, and both Sillerman and 
Westwood now say they really aren't that interested in making a deal. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile KJOY general manager Bert Whalen has already made it clear that he 
would like to buy the station, and he's putting together a team of investors. 
He tried to buy the station before the Westwood deal was announced but couldn't 
swing it. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a possibility that I might work with Sillerman," Whalen said. "But I'd 
much rather get together San Diego investors." 
</P>
<P>
One name that continually pops up is former Noble Broadcasting and Viacom 
executive Norman Feuer, an old friend of Whalen's. 
</P>
<P>
Feuer, who left Noble a few weeks ago to "rearrange his sock drawer," said 
Thursday that "at this moment" he's not interested in the station. Among other 
reasons, he said, the oft-quoted $19-million figure is too high. 
</P>
<P>
The situation is "too complicated at this point," Feuer said. 
</P>
<P>
Whalen looks at the situation this way: "There are a lot bullets flying, and 
there is so much smoke that when it all clears the one person still standing 
will get the station." 
</P>
<P>
Although Jeff Prescott talks about the desire for change and a sense of timing, 
a two-year guaranteed contract for a reported annual salary of $160,000 each 
certainly had a lot to do with Prescott and partner Mike Berger's recent 
"defection" from KGB-FM (101.5) to XTRA-FM (91X). 
</P>
<P>
Their old station, KGB-FM (101.5), where Prescott worked for 14 years, doesn't 
offer employees contracts. 
</P>
<P>
KGB general manager Tom Baker was "disappointed" that Berger and Prescott 
didn't give him an opportunity to make a counteroffer. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, when KSDO-FM (Classic 103) had tried to hire the team for its new 
classic rock format, KGB countered by giving each a raise. 
</P>
<P>
"They asked what it would take to keep us," Prescott said. "Mike and I blew it. 
We asked for too little." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the year, KGB had given each an unsolicited $10,000 bonus. 
</P>
<P>
But KGB owner Brown Broadcasting has always been known for being tight with the 
purse strings. 
</P>
<P>
"They throw nickels around like manhole covers," said one industry source. 
</P>
<P>
Baker counters that the station signed the other member of the Berger and 
Prescott team, Cookie "Chainsaw" Randolph, who was wooed by several stations, 
to a big new contract after Berger and Prescott left. Randolph may be the 
highest paid radio personality in the county, Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
Prescott said they never took the 91X offer back to Baker because 91X had made 
it clear they didn't want to get into a bidding war. Besides, they had already 
made up their minds to leave. 
</P>
<P>
"We just liked the sound of it (switching stations)," Prescott said. "Maybe we 
were ready for a change." 
</P>
<P>
But he doesn't deny that money was a factor. 
</P>
<P>
"We just wanted to get our share," Prescott said. "We make a lot of money for a 
radio station." 
</P>
<P>
An impressive number of movie buffs noticed a mistake in last week's media 
column. Yes, indeed, it was Peter Finch, not Albert Finney, who starred in 
"Network." "So much for your holier than thou attitude," said one caller. And 
that came from a friend. . . . 
</P>
<P>
KKYY (Y95) program director Pat Finn has resigned to pursue "personal goals." . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
KGTV (Channel 10) general manager Ed Quinn reportedly wrote a letter to Helen 
Copley apologizing for certain aspects of a recent Michael Tuck "Perspective" 
piece, which blasted the Union-Tribune publisher's anti-union activities. "No 
comment," Quinn said. . . . 
</P>
<P>
KNSD-TV's (Channel 39) "Images of the Eighties" special was well-produced, an 
excellent blend of music and video. However, it wallowed in self-promotion, 
coming across as a commercial for its on-air staff. The video segments were 
separated by "interviews" with the station's news "personalities," as if people 
were dying to find out what anchorwoman Denise Yamada was doing when Mt. St. 
Helens erupted. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Former Channel 10 anchorman Paul Majors, who left to anchor the news for the 
NBC affiliate in Minneapolis, KARE-TV, is among those being mentioned as a 
possible anchor replacement for Channel 10's Michael Tuck. . . . 
</P>
<P>
A study by the accounting firm of Miller, Kaplan, Arase and Co. says San Diego 
radio revenue jumped 10% in 1989, up to about $90 million. The gain is 
respectable, but it indicates a change in the industry's growth curve. A 20% 
increase was reported in 1988, a year that will be forever worshipped by local 
radio station owners. . . . 
</P>
<P>
This is a big week for local fans of ABC News. Correspondent Morton Dean will 
be imparting wisdom at Point Loma College tonight. On Friday, ABC media analyst 
Jeff Greenfield will play UCSD's Mandeville Auditorium. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Beginning Friday at 5:30 a.m., KSON AM (1240) and FM (97.3) will dedicate 36 
hours of its programming to "Kids Get Cancer 2," a radiothon to benefit St. 
Jude Children's Research Hospital.

ART'MAN IN MIRROR' MYSTIFYING EXHIBIT

<P>
For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in 
part; but then shall I know even as I am known. 
</P>
<P>
 -- I Corinthians, 13:12 
</P>
<P>
Elusive figures ghost-walk through the misty spaces of John Paul Jones' 
paintings and prints from the late 1950s and early '60s. Other blurred figures 
appear in his recent sculpture. They are images of the viewer, reflected in dim 
outlines that strip away the personality and leave only a shadow of the self. 
</P>
<P>
Phyllis Lutjeans of the UC Irvine Fine Arts Gallery had a hunch that both 
bodies of work were intimately connected, despite the decades that separate 
them and the different media Jones used to make them. So she guest-curated what 
she modestly calls a "side glance" at the work of this UCI faculty member for 
the Art Institute of Southern California, where it is on view through Feb. 20. 
</P>
<P>
"Sideglance" is the title of one of Jones' mirror pieces, and it aptly 
describes the way the sheet of stainless steel or aluminum set into a bass wood 
frame glancingly reflects the viewer's image. Personal details are blurred; the 
eye registers only the moody bulk of a silhouette. 
</P>
<P>
In other works, a sheet of copper yields a different kind of image: warm and 
glowing, with sharper focus. "Suncatcher I" perks up in light the way a starlet 
shines on camera: the gleaming copper beams back romantically softened 
reflections of everything it faces. 
</P>
<P>
The frames of these simple-looking pieces are crafted with small, shy snatches 
of ornament: tiny slits between the strips of wood, miniature dowels, small 
groupings of nails or holes, painted triangular shapes. Most of these works 
have an utterly neutral, self-effacing quality, but a few have distinctive 
personalities. Perched atop "The Rose Queen's Mirror," a "crown" of black and 
copper triangles adds a special piquancy to the slender vertical swath of 
copper. 
</P>
<P>
The luminosity of the mirror pieces seems directly connected to "Blonde," the 
most striking image in the show. In this painting from 1960, the woman's upper 
body is suffused in a yellow glow that rises to a crescendo in her astonishing 
cloud of hair, so intensely hued it almost creates a palpable vapor, like a 
scattering of pollen. 
</P>
<P>
Suave handling of line and color gives a few other early images a vivid 
presence. The profiled woman in "Red Lady," an etching and aquatint, exudes a 
sexy inquisitiveness that stems from the impudent curve in her neck, the 
unusual shape of her nose and her wide-eyed gaze. Is this a portrait of Jones' 
former wife Chadlyn? 
</P>
<P>
But most of the early figures are wispy, aloof creatures. In "Walking Woman," 
an etching on zinc, an elongated, armless figure with a pronounced arch in her 
back strides through a vague environment with traces of scaffolding. A small, 
unbeautiful nude couple standing rigidly at attention are the Adam-and-Eve-like 
figures in "Walk in the Sun," a charcoal drawing on clay-coated paper (the clay 
gives the sheet a yellowish cast). An intense corona of light in the darkness 
follows a mysterious tall figure with cascading hair and a long, trailing gown 
in "Night Lady," a brushy lithograph. 
</P>
<P>
"Ivory Lovers, French Lieutenants' Woman" apparently based on the movie and 
book titled "The French Lieutentant's Woman," is a drawing of a lovers' 
trysting scene. Faces are unreadable, however, and even the sex of each figure 
seems unclear, although both are half-dressed. Rather than show the viewer what 
the scene would have looked like to a voyeur, Jones seems to be taking us 
inside the act of passion, the feverishly intense moments when things are 
moving too fast for logic or thought. 
</P>
<P>
Observers have noted Jones' debt to the late 19th-Century Symbolists. In poet 
Jean Moreas' Symbolist manifesto, he said the aim of the movement was "to 
clothe the idea in a sensitive form." The painters transformed their subjects 
with stylistic distortions and wove them into mythological and religious 
themes. The dreamy female figures of Gustave Moreau and the blurry wax 
sculptures of Medardo Rosso seem particularly related to some of Jones' images. 
</P>
<P>
A private man in both his life and his art, Jones has tended to steer clear of 
contemporary artistic movements -- his work was figurative at the height of the 
Minimalist movement and abstract in the heyday of figurative painting. Yet he 
is also, inevitably, a man of his time. The blurred, mystical look of his 
imagery from the '60s seems related to aspects of the hippie era, when many 
sought otherworldly perceptions through meditation or drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Work from the mid-'70s shows Jones in the process of figuring out how to let go 
of the figure. Inchoate forms that look like zigzagging mountains and rushing 
water emerge from the brown-and-ivory blur of a drawing called "Ivory Winds." 
This moody, indistinct look at the natural world gets a more definitive 
treatment in "Ming Wings," with its scattering of gray ridges of paint scuffing 
up a big expanse of gray. That "damaged" quality -- the ridges look like traces 
of an object ripped from the canvas -- and the aura of emptiness and negation 
associated with the color gray give the painting its quiet power. 
</P>
<P>
Exactly why Lutjeans calls the exhibit "The Mirror in the Man: The Constant 
Image," remains somewhat unclear. She writes in her statement that the title 
"is significant . . . because it is this mirror in each of us that John Paul 
Jones' work forces us to recognize." What mirror in each of us? Perhaps she 
refers to our inability to perceive the psyches of other people except as 
tantalizing, dim outlines. 
</P>
<P>
The elusiveness of Jones' figures is such a paradoxical thing: Often they seem 
at once intimate and far away. And then again, that's frequently the way we 
feel about people we know very well. There are always things about them that 
can't be fathomed, can't be possessed. 
</P>
<P>
This exhibit inevitably brings to mind the Art Institute's 1989 show of 
drawings and paintings by Jones' late daughter Megan. Although stylistically 
very different, her essential approach to art was related to the delicacy and 
dreaminess of her father's work. The tiny ceramic sculptures of women that 
Megan made in the months before she succumbed to cancer suddenly seemed to me 
to be a loving homage to the tiny bronze reliefs her father made a few years 
before she was born. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Man in the Mirror: The Constant Image" continues through Feb. 20 at the 
Art Institute of Southern California, 2222 Laguna Canyon Road, Laguna Beach. 
The gallery is open Mondays through Thursdays from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays 
from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., and Saturdays from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Admission: free.

2 CONCERTOS, 1 SOLOIST AT MOZART BIRTHDAY PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thriving, extending its influence and still looking for a permanent home, the 
Orange County-based Mozart Camerata has entered the 1990s in an aura of 
promise. Some of that promise was delivered on at the ensemble's latest Mozart 
birthday concert Friday night (the birthday was Saturday) in the squarish but 
acoustically pleasing sanctuary at St. Andrews' Presbyterian Church in Newport 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Ami Porat, founder of the Classical-size orchestra -- on this occasion between 
30 and 33 players -- led a cumulatively engrossing program devoted to the Piano 
Concerto in E-flat, K. 271, the G-major Violin Concerto and the G-minor 
Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
The conductor's solid and unself-conscious readings again showed off the strong 
accomplishments of his ensemble, a group of first-rate instrumentalists who 
play as a unit and deliver stylish and energetic performances. Overall grace 
and intense detailing marked the playing of the Symphony No. 40, an unforgiving 
masterpiece here benignly and engagingly presented. 
</P>
<P>
Corey Cerovsek, a 17-year-old Canadian musician currently completing his 
musical training at Indiana University, was the soloist in both concertos, a 
feat he produced easily and without gimmickry. 
</P>
<P>
Cerovsek, who has said he considers himself more a fiddler than a pianist, did 
make the bigger impression in the violin concerto, wherein his fluent technique 
and handsome tone served the familiar work well. Yet his pianism also proved 
extraordinary in achievement and musicality. The young performer's sense of 
style is neither impeccable nor particularly pointed, but he made a convincing 
case in his advocacy of both works. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps tellingly, Cerovsek's best moments came in the cadenzas of the 
concertos, where his strong personality and thorough artistry shone through, 
even in the most anachronistic passages. 
</P>
<P>
Porat and the orchestra provided transparent and firm collaborations in both 
works. A sizable audience, which seemed to overflow the large church, responded 
with appropriate enthusiasm. DANIEL CARIAGA

GUITARIST STEPAN RAK IN PYROTECHNIC LOCAL DEBUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stepan Rak is a nonpareil. The Czech guitarist is an artist and entertainer, a 
master of coffee-house schmaltz and acerbic fantasies, and possessor of an 
advanced, utterly idiosyncratic technical apparatus that redefines virtuosity 
on the instrument. 
</P>
<P>
He made his West Coast recital debut Saturday night at Freeman Chapel of 
Pasadena Presbyterian Church, courtesy of the enterprising California Harp, 
Lute and Guitar Assn. He brought an almost unimaginably difficult program of 
his own compositions and arrangements, and might be playing still, seemingly 
fresher than ever, if the management hadn't raised the house lights on him 
nearly 2 1/2 hours after he began. 
</P>
<P>
Rak began with the anonymous Romanza dear to all intermediate students, which 
he quickly turned on its head, recomposed and sent fluttering on its way in 
double tremolo. That set the tone for the evening, which was filled with all 
manner of sentimental musical portraits and stories, given the most imaginative 
technical expression. 
</P>
<P>
Trills and tremolos on two strings, lightning runs in all registers, explosive 
rasqueado and percussion effects, and the widest timbral variety of harmonics 
filled Rak's bag of tricks, which he emptied out in almost every piece. All 
dazzled, but the strongest musically were the vehement, pseudo-folkloric 
"Sonata Mongoliana" and "Twighlight," a nicely shaped and relatively 
understated nocturne given its world premiere. 
</P>
<P>
Rak plays to his audience unabashedly. He introduced the numbers, telling 
stories in a soft, accented voice. He crooned along on one chorus of his 
"Balalaika," and stomped through "The Era of Rock'N Roll," a witty, 
free-wheeling, knowledgeable and affectionate parody complete with percussion 
solo. 
</P>
<P>
Six other numbers completed the printed agenda, from the long musical soap 
opera "The Last Disco" to the Five Early Dances, Renaissance redux at warp 
speed. The basic language is thoroughly tonal, spiked with wild tremolo 
glissandos and angular chromatic punctuation -- Villa-Lobos squared. 
</P>
<P>
Two encores -- a Rumanian dance that began as a left-hand stunt and ended in 
whirling blur, and an exuberantly kitschy improvisation on "My Bonnie Lies Over 
the Ocean" -- ended the evening.JOHN HENKEN

POP CAPSULES : GRACES REGISTER ON STAGE BUT NEED MORE GIGS, RISKS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In performance, as on paper, the Graces should be a heroine experience. 
Saturday at Bogart's, ex-Go-Go Charlotte Caffey, local sing-sations Gia 
Ciambotti and Meredith Brooks and their three-man rhythm section displayed much 
more energy and a tad more personality than in the 
set-the-controls-for-the-heart-of-the-main-stream pop sounds of their album 
debut, "Perfect View." 
</P>
<P>
The tunes, however, might as well have been painted in air. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, your group's Muse-ical focus is on love'n'stuff, but you've gotta put 
some blood on the tracks -- or have some kind of wonderful melody -- to really 
make it all the way, as evidenced by your sparkling, toss-away version of Nick 
Lowe's "What's So Funny (About Peace, Love and Understanding)," which, of 
course, has both. 
</P>
<P>
It's not hard to see that the Graces have tremendous potential. It's also not 
hard to hear that more gigs, more songs, more risks, in musical range and in 
vocal arrangements, are needed. DON WALLER

POP CAPSULES : BAD ENGLISH IN CONCERT PROVES WORTH THE WAITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just when the rock world seemed safe from the cloying pretensions of such 
former mainstream heroes as Journey, the new Bad English band -- boasting 
ex-Journeymen Neal Schon and Jonathan Cain -- shows up. 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, this group, which performed Friday at the Hollywood Palladium, is 
Journey reincarnated with its slick, safe, romantic pop-rock. 
</P>
<P>
Based on the album "Bad English," which has only a few quality songs and not 
much energy, you'd expect a snoozer of a concert. But surprise: Bad English 
wasn't bad live, infusing much of the material -- including "When I See You 
Smile" and other songs that seem lame on record -- with a metal-like energy. 
</P>
<P>
This robust, pounding edge helped offset some of the group's tiresome solos and 
general aloofness. 
</P>
<P>
Lead singer John Waite, from the Babys, deserves much of the credit. Normally a 
wimpy vocalist, he sang with unexpected power and convincing emotion. DENNIS

SPECIAL SCREENINGS: VITAPHONE TRIBUTE DUE AT THE MELNITZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Dawn of Sound: A Tribute to Vitaphone" is a remarkable 
preservation/restoration collaborative effort on the part of AT&amp;T, the 
Museum of Modern Art, the UCLA Film Archive and other institutions. 
</P>
<P>
The series begins series Saturday (7:30 p.m.) at UCLA's Melnitz Theater with a 
re-creation of the sound system's introduction to the public on Aug. 6, 1926, 
in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
Vitaphone was a sound-on-disc system designed to provide orchestral 
accompaniment to silent films shown in small-town theaters where the cost of a 
live orchestra would be prohibitive. However, when Al Jolson ad-libbed "You 
ain't heard nothin' yet" in "The Jazz Singer," there was no turning back: The 
talkie revolution was under way, and Vitaphone would soon be supplanted by the 
more sophisticated direct-on-film sound. 
</P>
<P>
Preceding Alan Crosland's "Don Juan," the first feature-length silent to be 
accompanied by a synchronized music score (by William Axt) and sound effects, 
are very self-conscious opening remarks by Will H. Hays, who was head of the 
Motion Pictures Producers and Distributors Assn. during the industry's 
transition from silent to sound, and a selection of shorts featuring eminent 
classical musicians in performance. 
</P>
<P>
A DeMille-like swashbuckler, Warners' "Don Juan" has in the title role a 
perfectly cast, still-slim but world-weary John Barrymore pursuing the 
ravishingly beautiful and chaste Mary Astor. Axt's score is appropriate 
stirring, and the rich and elegant sets are by the master pioneer art director 
Ben Carre. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most famous trouble-plagued silents, MGM's "White Shadows in the 
South Seas" (1928), which screens Sunday at 2 p.m., was started by 
documentarian Robert Flaherty, who was replaced early on by the efficient W.S. 
Van Dyke. The result is a choppy mix of muckraking melodrama and ethnographic 
footage that nevertheless builds to a surprisingly powerful and tragic ending. 
The film, whose synchronized score -- Metro's first -- features typical 
Polynesian themes, is a timeless indictment of the white man's scabrous 
exploitation of Third World peoples and a touching love story between a 
compassionate doctor (Monte Blue) and the beautiful native princess (Raquel 
Torres) who redeems him. 
</P>
<P>
"White Shadows in the South Seas" will be followed by "A Woman of Affairs," a 
1929 silent adaptation of Michael Arlen's "The Green Hat" starring Greta Garbo 
as a rich, gallant star-crossed Englishwoman who inspires the love of many but 
never finds happiness. The combination of the transcendently beautiful and 
subtle Garbo, her most frequent director Clarence Brown, her favorite cameraman 
William Daniels, her leading man and offscreen lover, John Gilbert -- plus 
Adrian's soft-edged timeless gowns and elegant Cedric Gibbons sets -- results 
in romantic screen magic so mesmerizing it overcomes a dated and laundered 
plot. The film does suggest the dark undertow of the Roaring '20s in which the 
clash between free spirits and lingering Victorian mores could indeed be 
tragic; its fine uncredited synchronized score is alternately tempestuous and 
melancholy. 
</P>
<P>
It's back to Warner Bros. for the Sunday evening silent double feature, Alan 
Crosland's "Old San Francisco" (1927) and Roy Del Ruth's "The First Auto" 
(1927). In the first, Darryl F. Zanuck, then a 25-year-old screenwriter, would 
have us believe that the San Francisco earthquake of 1906 occurred because 
Dolores Costello, the virginal daughter of a decayed Spanish land grant family, 
invoked the wrath of God to protect her from the fate worse than death in an 
underground Chinatown harem. 
</P>
<P>
The strongest element in the film is Ben Carre's splendid re-creation of 
Chinatown and the Barbary Coast, which he then reduced to shambles; the 
synchronized score is by Hugo Riesenfeld. A rural comedy subtitled "A Romance 
of the Last Horse and the First Horseless Carriage," it was also written by 
Zanuck. It stars Russell Simpson (best remembered as Pa Joad in "The Grapes of 
Wrath") and features elaborate sound effects and a nostalgic Herman Heller 
synchronized score. 
</P>
<P>
The series -- which will include "The Jazz Singer" and the first "100% All 
Talking Picture," "Lights of New York" -- runs through Feb. 18. Information: 
(213) 206-FILM, 206-8013.

'WHERE PIGEONS GO' TOO SCHMALTZY BY HALF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Art Carney turns up a few kernels of truth among the tears and schmaltz of 
tonight's NBC movie, "Where Pigeons Go to Die" (at 9 on Channels 4, 36 and 39). 
</P>
<P>
T Michael Landon directs, wrote the teleplay (based on the book by R. Wright 
Campbell) and stars. He plays 50-year-old Hugh, returning to his hometown after 
40 years to sell his dead grandfather's house. But memories of the time he 
spent there as a boy with his "Da" (Carney), who gave him lessons in pigeon 
training and in life, engulf him in mournful reminiscence. 
</P>
<P>
Landon, the king of TV's heart-warming genre ("Little House on the Prairie," 
"Highway to Heaven"), narrates: "I'm 10 years old again, the cardinal year of 
my life, and it's a day that marks the end of my childhood." 
</P>
<P>
The boy Hugh, played by Robert Hy Gorman, is the constant companion of his 
beloved "Da," who mixes philosophy with pigeon lore. Da says birds should be 
held "firmly but gently, the way you should hold love or life," and "a creature 
returns home for the good in it." 
</P>
<P>
When Da is hospitalized with a stroke, Hugh knows he must somehow help Da back 
to the home he loves before he dies. Meanwhile, Hugh's prize pigeon is missing 
after an 800-mile race. Will he, like Da, make it home? 
</P>
<P>
The script -- and Landon's tragedian narration -- cloy, but less so when 
Carney's on screen. 
</P>
<P>
Gorman, a fragile, serious-faced boy, acquits himself creditably. Ronne Troup 
and Cliff De Young, as Hugh's mom and dad, don't have much to do, although De 
Young shares one moving moment of reality with Carney. 
</P>
<P>
But it's Carney, immobile and speechless in his hospital scenes, using only his 
eyes and the lift of his chin, who briefly gives the film the poignancy for 
which it strives.

OPEC Earnings Jump: The oil revenue of the OPEC nations soared last year to 
their highest level since 1985, an industry analyst said. Pierre Terzian, 
editor of the Paris-based newsletter Petrostrategies, estimated that the 
13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries earned a combined total 
of $110.6 billion last year from export sales of their crude, up more than a 
third from his 1988 calculation of $80.1 billion.

Harness-Racing Drivers Lose Against Los Alamitos: A U.S. District Court judge 
in Los Angeles rejected a request by licensed harness-racing drivers to block 
Los Alamitos race track from limiting the number of drivers it will allow to 
race during its five-month meet. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the drivers argue that the Los Alamitos Racing Assn. is 
effectively revoking their licenses by only allowing "popular" drivers with 
winning records to work at the track. Attorneys for Los Alamitos could not be 
reached for comment. (Filed Jan. 24, 1990. Case No. CV9000357JGD)

Shareholder Suit Filed Against First Executive: A class-action shareholder suit 
was filed Thursday in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles accusing First 
Executive Corp. of artificially maintaining the company's stock price by 
concealing losses in its junk bond portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
The suit was filed on the same day First Executive announced that it was 
allowing its largest shareholder to make a bid for the insurance firm and less 
than a week after the firm announced a major fourth-quarter loss. First 
Executive officials could not be reached for comment. (Filed Jan. 25, 1990.

INDUSTRY PINS HEAVY HOPES ON LIGHT MILK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA L. LA GANGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If nonfat milk reminds you of the blue coloring in a cheap set of watercolors, 
and if low-fat milk has too much fat for your diet, then the folks at the 
California Milk Advisory Board have a product for you: "Extra Light Milk." 
</P>
<P>
It has 1% butterfat, which puts it halfway between low-fat milk, with 2%, and 
skim with none. But the price is fatter than either. Retailing at about $1.25 
for half a gallon, the new product is closer to the price of whole milk. 
</P>
<P>
Not only is it better for you, board spokesman Adri Boudewyn maintains, but it 
offers what dairy folks call better "mouth-feel" -- feeling more like milk and 
less like water as it crosses the tongue. 
</P>
<P>
"So far, it looks like a winner," Boudewyn says. "It's a milk for the '90s." 
</P>
<P>
The milk advisory board hopes that it does better than a similar product 
introduced in the late 1980s. It, too, was a 1% butterfat product, but it was 
highly fortified with vitamins and minerals and was aimed at a very limited 
market: women concerned about calcium intake and osteoporosis. It was called, 
variously, Nice n' Light from Knudsen, Lightlymaid from Jerseymaid and Slim 'n 
Trim, from Slim 'n Trim Inc. 
</P>
<P>
"That product was minimal in sales and only available in Southern California," 
said Gary Frank, another spokesman for the milk board. "It has 140 calories per 
serving as opposed to extra-light milk, which is 120." 
</P>
<P>
Extra-light milk took two years and $300,000 to create, and the dairy industry 
is backing its debut this month with a $3-million marketing budget through 
March. And so far, Boudewyn said, consumers don't seem to be using it merely to 
replace other milk products, which had been an industry concern. 
</P>
<P>
"In October and November we tested this milk in Orange County, in 12 Lucky 
Stores," he said. "We wanted to make sure as an industry that this new milk did 
not cannibalize from other milks. What we found out after eight weeks was we 
had 6.5% of the market with this new milk." 
</P>
<P>
More important, he said, total milk consumption in the test stores went up 9.6% 
-- an increase Boudewyn called "phenomenal." MARIA L. LA GANGA

GE MAY JOIN BID FOR ARISTECH

Utah chemical magnate Jon Huntsman and a General Electric Co. division said 
Friday that they are attempting to form a 50-50 joint venture that could 
acquire Aristech Chemical Corp. for more than $899 million. 
</P>
<P>
Huntsman Holdings Corp. and GE Plastics of Pittsfield, Mass., said the proposal 
could enable Huntsman to boost his offer for Aristech to at least $26 a share 
from $25, according to a letter that the Salt Lake City businessman mailed to 
Aristech board member R. S. Evans. 
</P>
<P>
Aristech spokesman David Higie declined to comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Huntsman is in a bidding war for Aristech with Mitsubishi Corp. of Japan and 
Aristech's senior management, which last week offered $26 a share. The senior 
management group is led by Aristech Chairman Thomas Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
Aristech has about 32 million shares outstanding, or 34.6 million when fully 
diluted. Aristech stock dropped 12.5 cents to $25.125 in New York Stock 
Exchange trading on Friday 
</P>
<P>
Huntsman's $25-a-share offer, worth about $865 million, was rejected in 
November.

MACHINE TOOL ORDERS DOWN 33.7% OVER YEAR

U.S. machine tool orders fell 33.7% in December to $209.75 million from a year 
earlier but rose 13.7% from November's $184.40 million, the National Machine 
Tool Builders' Assn. said. 
</P>
<P>
In its monthly statistical report, the trade association said total machine 
tool shipments were $384.45 million, up 31.4% from a year ago and up 22.6% from 
the $313.70 million posted the previous month. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign orders totaled $30.4 million in December, compared to $36.2 million for 
November. 
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased with the rise in shipments in 1989," Albert Moore, association 
president, said. Exports rose 47%, with foreign metal-cutting shipments up 72%, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"More exports are absolutely essential if U.S. manufacturers are to regain the 
strength they've lost in recent years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Total orders for metal-forming tools fell 8.2% last month to $50.95 million 
from November's $55.5 million. In 1988, December tool orders totaled $70.1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Metal-forming shipments totaled $71.2 million in December, a 16.3% drop from 
November's $85.1 million total, and off 14.4% from the December, 1988, total of 
$83.20 million. 
</P>
<P>
Metal-cutting tool orders rose 23.2% last month to $158.8 million and dipped 
35.6% from a year ago, when orders totaled $246.40 million. 
</P>
<P>
Metal-cutting shipments rose 37.0% to $313.25 million in December and up 49.6% 
from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
The association said the backlog of orders in December was $1.802 billion, down 
from the backlog of $1.977 billion in November.

Joe Montana and his teammates staked their bids for greatness Sunday as the 
quarterback led the San Francisco 49ers to a 55-10 rout of the Denver Broncos 
in Super Bowl XXIV. 
</P>
<P>
Montana threw five touchdown passes, a Super Bowl record. He now has a career 
total of 11, another record. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers became the first National Football League team to win back-to-back 
championships in 10 years, since the Pittsburgh Steelers did it. 
</P>
<P>
"He's probably the greatest quarterback ever to play this game," said 49er 
Coach George Seifert. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers also tied the Steelers with their fourth Super Bowl victory. Like the 
Steelers, the 49ers have never lost. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos tied the Minnesota Vikings with their fourth Super Bowl loss. Like 
the Vikings, the Broncos have never won. 
</P>
<P>
Montana threw touchdown passes of 20, 38 and 28 yards to Jerry Rice; a 7-yarder 
to Brent Jones, and one for 35 to John Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
Montana, 33, completed 78.3% of his passes in his three postseason games. He 
threw 11 touchdown passes and no interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
In the three first halves, when the games were marginally more competitive, 
Montana was even better: 79.3% with nine touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's game was a mismatch. The Broncos came in 12-point underdogs, the 
largest spread in 20 years, and promptly fell behind, 7-0, when Montana drove 
the 49ers 66 yards on their first possession, finishing the drive with a 
20-yard pass to Rice. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos closed to 7-3 on David Treadwell's 42-yard field goal, then forced 
a San Francisco punt and took over in good field position, at their 49. 
</P>
<P>
However, halfback Bobby Humphrey fumbled and the 49ers' Kevin Fagan recovered. 
Montana drove the 49ers in again, throwing a 7-yard scoring pass to his tight 
end, Jones. 
</P>
<P>
Montana then drove the 49ers 69 yards for a 20-3 lead. Then, with 1:38 left in 
the second quarter, he took them 59 yards to score again, requiring 64 seconds 
to run five plays, the last a 38-yard pass to Rice behind Bronco safety Dennis 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Denver's John Elway threw interceptions on the first two Bronco possessions of 
the second half. The 49ers converted both into touchdowns and led, 41-3. 
</P>
<P>
Elway went 10 for 26, was sacked four times and held to 8 yards in his four 
rushes. Coach Dan Reeves let backup Gary Kubiak finish the last 9:28. 
</P>
<P>
Records fell throughout the second half. The 49ers' 55 points eclipsed the 
record 46, set by the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XX. Rice's three touchdowns 
and Roger Craig's two gave each a career total of four in Super Bowls, tying 
them with the Steelers' Franco Harris. 
</P>
<P>
Seifert became the second rookie coach to win a Super Bowl, joining Baltimore's 
Don McCafferty. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers have won Super Bowls in 1982, '85, '89 and '90. The National 
Conference has won the last six Super Bowls, since the AFC Raiders' victory in 
1984.

PLAYA VISTA BACK ON TRACK AS PRAISE REPLACES HOSTILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY L. RABIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the heart of Westside anti-growth territory, the developer of the enormous 
proposed city within a city called Playa Vista held a public meeting late last 
year to unveil plans for a new marina on the edge of Marina del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
The audience of several hundred community activists, boat owners, 
environmentalists and others listened for 2 1/2 hours as Nelson C. Rising, 
managing partner for the project, described a "Mediterranean village" of 
Spanish-style buildings, swaying palm trees, waterways and pedestrian paths. 
</P>
<P>
As Rising wrapped up his presentation, a remarkable thing happened: The 
audience applauded. 
</P>
<P>
The reaction that night, in a part of Los Angeles where hostility to further 
development has coalesced into a potent political force, was clear evidence of 
a shift in attitude toward one of the biggest building projects in the city's 
history. The selling of Playa Vista was working. 
</P>
<P>
It was a big change. For years, intense community opposition had stymied Summa 
Corp.'s effort to develop the vast stretch of open land between the Westchester 
Bluffs and the Marina. But in February, 1989, Maguire Thomas Partners of Santa 
Monica took over as the lead developer. The firm, noted for its political 
connections and well-cultivated good-guy image, was determined to avoid the 
previous pitfalls. 
</P>
<P>
So far, it has succeeded. A year later, Playa Vista -- envisioned as a city of 
about 24,000 residents, complete with shops, offices, hotels -- is back on 
track. The developer's willingness to heed local concerns and, where necessary, 
offer significant concessions, has won it praise from environmental 
organizations, community groups and neighborhood activists who rarely have 
anything good to say about a developer. 
</P>
<P>
While conducting this energetic community outreach campaign, Maguire Thomas 
also has pursued the more conventional strategy of negotiating with and wooing 
city, county and state officials, often behind closed doors. This, too, has 
been fruitful. Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, for example, no longer blasts the 
project as a symbol of overdevelopment, but cites it as a model of 
environmental and community sensitivity. 
</P>
<P>
Maguire Thomas' most impressive accomplishment, though, is that it has built 
all this good will without sacrificing the overall size of the project. It has 
drastically altered the design of Playa Vista and changed the proposed mix of 
residential, office and commercial development, but it has not made Playa Vista 
smaller. In fact, Maguire Thomas has increased the number of proposed 
residential units more than 30% over what Summa had planned -- to 11,750 from 
8,800. 
</P>
<P>
From the outset, the firm's strategy was one of identifying all the people, 
agencies and organizations whose approval was needed or who were in a position 
to make trouble for the project, then making a concerted effort to address 
their questions and concerns. The first name on this list, Maguire Thomas 
executives decided, was Galanter's. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, almost a year before it took over the project, Maguire Thomas' top 
officers sought a meeting with Galanter, who had been elected to the City 
Council in 1987 on a wave of Westside anti-development sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Galanter Consulted 
</P>
<P>
Before they invested in the project, the Maguire Thomas executives and their 
financial partners wanted to hear at first hand of Galanter's concerns about 
the plan, and to get a feeling for the kind of political and community 
opposition they might be facing. 
</P>
<P>
In a sense, that March, 1988, meeting in Galanter's City Hall office marked the 
start of the firm's ambitious and aggressive campaign to win over a hostile 
public. 
</P>
<P>
"She had run against the project, and it was our concern to find out the depth 
of her opposition," Rising said. "Obviously, the way the city works, having the 
support of the elected councilperson in the district is important . . . but we 
were also concerned about what it was that she objected to." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rip-Snorting Meeting' 
</P>
<P>
Accompanying Rising and his colleagues were representatives of JMB Realty Corp. 
of Chicago, a prospective financial partner in the project, and Summa Corp., 
founded by eccentric billionaire Howard Hughes and now owned by his estate. In 
a recent interview, Galanter recalled it as "one rip-snorting meeting" attended 
by the developers and "the money boys from Chicago with their briefcases." 
</P>
<P>
Galanter told them that Playa Vista threatened the fragile Ballona Wetlands at 
the property's western edge. Moreover, she said, it would greatly aggravate 
already-serious traffic congestion in the area. The proposed high-rise office 
buildings would be overwhelming and out of place. And the project, as proposed 
by Summa Corp., did nothing to address the city's growing need for affordable 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
Maguire Thomas and JMB officials evidently heard nothing in the meeting to 
scare them off, because in February, 1989, the two companies, both among the 
nation's largest commercial developers, had joined forces and taken over Playa 
Vista. Maguire Thomas, in its lead role, would design, build and market the 
project. JMB would arrange much of the financing. The Hughes interests took a 
back seat as a limited partner. 
</P>
<P>
The new development team set out to create a dramatically different vision of 
Playa Vista, to recast it as a collection of "urban villages" with offices, 
restaurants, shops and homes within walking distance of each other. 
</P>
<P>
Maguire Thomas principals Robert F. Maguire III and James A. Thomas pledged to 
work closely with Galanter, other officials, agencies and neighborhood groups 
to "create a plan that will improve the quality of life for people in both 
Playa Vista and the neighboring communities." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opening a Dialogue 
</P>
<P>
Maguire Thomas' first order of business was to open a dialogue with the 
community. Rising developed a polished pitch for Playa Vista, consisting of a 
talk, slide show and question-and-answer session, which he has presented more 
than 200 times in the past year -- sometimes to as few as half a dozen people. 
</P>
<P>
A few critics have noted that the presentation is long on ambience and short on 
specifics, but even the skeptics acknowledge that Rising and his team of 
architects, planners and consultants do listen to their audiences. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Summa Plan 
</P>
<P>
What they heard at first at these public forums was often a cacophony of 
complaints about the old Summa plan. 
</P>
<P>
The Summa project called for 6 million square feet of office space concentrated 
in high-rise towers, over 1 million square feet of retail space including a 
regional shopping center, 8,800 apartments and condominiums, 2,400 hotel rooms 
and a marina. 
</P>
<P>
Maguire Thomas immediately indicated a willingness to scrap wholesale elements 
of the Summa plan. Over the past year, the amount of office space has been 
reduced. The high-rise buildings and the shopping center have been eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, by any measure, Playa Vista is still huge. 
</P>
<P>
Maguire Thomas wants to build a multibillion-dollar complex of: 
</P>
<P>
* 5 million square feet of office space (more than twice that of Century City's 
trademark 44-story twin towers). 
</P>
<P>
* 11,750 residential units, more than in all of Hermosa Beach. 
</P>
<P>
* 720,000 square feet of retail space, slightly more than that in the Westside 
Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
* 2,400 hotel rooms, more than twice the number at the Century Plaza Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
* A marina of more than 40 acres, with 750 slips and buildings up to eight 
stories tall. 
</P>
<P>
In response to suggestions from the community, Maguire Thomas has offered major 
concessions: 
</P>
<P>
The tallest buildings will be 10 stories. A greenbelt will be developed at the 
base of the Westchester Bluffs. To protect the wetlands, most of the office 
space will be at the eastern edge of the property, near the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
To reduce traffic, Maguire Thomas plans an internal transit system and an 
express bus link to major Los Angeles-area business centers. 
</P>
<P>
Recycling, sewage treatment and waste water reclamation are to be built into 
the project. Parks, open space and walkways are incorporated into the new plan. 
</P>
<P>
To satisfy the demands of Galanter and others, Maguire Thomas agreed that 1,760 
apartments, or 15% of the housing units, will be affordable for people of 
average incomes. 
</P>
<P>
One major obstacle to the project was a long-standing lawsuit over the Ballona 
Wetlands. Where Summa had seemed intent on developing as much of the acreage as 
possible, Maguire Thomas entered negotiations with the Friends of Ballona 
Wetlands on preserving more of the marsh. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations in the lawsuit are continuing, but both sides now believe that a 
resolution is in sight. Maguire Thomas has offered to protect and restore 270 
acres of the wetlands, an area that represents about 30% of Playa Vista's 887 
acres. 
</P>
<P>
Overall plans are in the design stage, with environmental impact studies and 
government approvals pending, but so far, they have drawn generally favorable 
reviews from community groups long hostile to the Summa plan. Maguire Thomas 
hopes to begin construction in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Howard Hughes' Land 
</P>
<P>
Howard Hughes bought the farmland and fields of Playa Vista for a pittance in 
the 1940s. He built an airfield and aircraft plant on the eastern edge, but 
left vacant the wetlands that lies 2 miles to the west. 
</P>
<P>
As the years passed, the Hughes property increasingly resembled an island in a 
sea of urban development. About two years after Hughes died in 1976, executives 
at Summa decided it was time to build on the land. They drafted plans for a 
$1-billion city of high-rise offices, residences, stores, hotels and a marina. 
</P>
<P>
Summa won city, county and California Coastal Commission approval for its Playa 
Vista master plan in 1984, but fierce opposition -- particularly the Friends of 
Ballona Wetlands lawsuit -- stopped the project before subdivision approvals 
were obtained. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to being distressed over the colossal scale of the project, area 
residents were angered by Summa's strategy for gaining approval, which 
consisted primarily of cultivating key political figures while ignoring the 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Summa was "just a disaster, as far as dealing with the public," said Carlyle 
Hall, attorney for the Ballona Wetlands group. He described the Las Vegas-based 
company as "a bunker-mentality developer . . . that makes campaign 
contributions and steam-rolls a project over the community." 
</P>
<P>
Public anger over the Summa plan became a central element of Galanter's 
grass-roots campaign to unseat Councilwoman Pat Russell in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Galanter's basic theme -- that Russell was too close to developers and had 
become their ally at City Hall -- struck a nerve with voters. 
</P>
<P>
The day after her election, Galanter pledged to scale back Playa Vista, save 
more of the wetlands, reduce the commercial space and add more housing for 
low-income and moderate-income people. From the outset, she also insisted that 
the planning of Playa Vista be more of a public process and less of a back-room 
one. 
</P>
<P>
But Galanter, whose own background was in urban planning, also recognized it 
was inevitable that the property would be developed someday. So did most other 
community activists. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Lansford, chairwoman of Friends of Ballona Wetlands, said her group is 
"working well" with Maguire Thomas, particularly in contrast to its dealings 
with Summa. Of Rising, she said: "You can ask him a direct question and can get 
a direct answer." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Activists Consulted 
</P>
<P>
Julie Inouye, a founder of Playa del Rey Network, a coalition of neighborhood 
groups, said she was pleased to have been consulted about the plan. "From the 
very beginning, they called all of us," Inouye said. 
</P>
<P>
"Summa's basic position seemed to be 'Take it or leave it -- this is what we 
are going to do' " added Moe Stavnezer, a Venice community activist. "Maguire 
Thomas has done a really superb job of taking the edge off." 
</P>
<P>
John L. Goolsby, Summa president, said company officials now recognize that 
they should have done "a number of things differently. If we learned a lesson, 
it is to be more sensitive to the concerns of the community." 
</P>
<P>
Although Galanter has not yet given her endorsement to the project, she said 
she is pleased with the way things are going. 
</P>
<P>
"My sense is they are making a serious effort to do everything I asked them to 
do," she said. "Nothing is real until they submit something to the city. That 
is why you don't see me on a soapbox claiming victory yet." 
</P>
<P>
Jane Blumenfeld, planning deputy to Mayor Tom Bradley, called Playa Vista "so 
compatible with the environment and so positive," compared with Porter Ranch, a 
similarly huge development taking shape in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Bradley sharply criticized Porter Ranch for its lack of affordable 
housing, an automobile-dependent design that failed to place homes near shops 
and offices and failure to promote recycling and water reclamation. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the glowing reviews for Playa Vista so far, Stavnezer and other 
activists say they want to see an environmental impact report -- still probably 
six months away -- before they decide whether to support the project. 
</P>
<P>
"What they want to build is pretty enormous, there is no getting around that," 
Stavnezer said. 
</P>
<P>
Salvatore Grammatico, president of the Coalition of Concerned Communities, a 
group of neighborhood associations, is similarly skeptical. "We are dealing 
with pros, the best I've ever seen," he said. 
</P>
<P>
So far, he said, Maguire Thomas has simply presented drawings of a project with 
a "very nice ambience." By concentrating on the advantages rather than the 
"nuts and bolts of the impacts," he said, Maguire Thomas is "selling the skin 
without the skeleton." 
</P>
<P>
Grammatico said there are many unanswered questions about how the project will 
affect surrounding areas, particularly questions about traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Rising said that Maguire Thomas is planning a series of workshops in coming 
months on elements of the environmental impact report. Letters went out late 
last week, inviting hundreds of neighborhood residents to participate in its 
preparation. "It is our view that if we find out their concerns in advance, 
many of them can be addressed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Heading Off Delays 
</P>
<P>
The public sessions serve another purpose for the developer: They serve to 
minimize delays. 
</P>
<P>
Rising acknowledges that "delay can be expensive," but he flatly refused talk 
about any financial aspect of Playa Vista, including the overall cost. "We're a 
private company and it's a private transaction," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a variety of reasons other than the financial obligations of the 
(carrying) costs that led us to pursue our strategy," Rising explained. "That's 
the way we think we can make the most viable project and, coincidentally, 
that's the way you get a plan that is approvable earlier." 
</P>
<P>
But Maguire Thomas is not relying solely on its dialogue with the community. 
Its top executives are seasoned veterans of Los Angeles politics. Rising was 
chairman of Bradley's first campaign for governor, for example. Founders 
Maguire and Thomas are both personal friends of the mayor. All the executives 
have been active contributors to the campaigns of numerous officeholders. 
</P>
<P>
The company, furthermore, is no stranger to big projects. 
</P>
<P>
The 73-story First Interstate World Center in downtown Los Angeles, the tallest 
building on the West Coast, is a Maguire Thomas project. 
</P>
<P>
Maguire Thomas also built Plaza Las Fuentes, a shopping, hotel and office 
complex in the Pasadena Civic Center, and is developing both Colorado Place, a 
major office complex, and a controversial oceanfront hotel in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Playa Vista, private discussions are continuing with Galanter's 
office and city transportation engineers. Negotiations on the plan for the new 
marina are under way behind closed doors with county officials. And extensive 
talks have taken place with state Controller Gray Davis over a land swap that 
would allow Maguire Thomas to build on 70 acres next to Playa Vista that the 
state acquired in lieu of taxes from the Hughes estate. 
</P>
<P>
The negotiations toward settling the Friends of Ballona Wetlands lawsuit 
provide a good example of Maguire Thomas' thoroughness. Because the city, 
county and state are all co-defendants in the suit, the developer sees the 
potential for a package settlement. In exchange for its commitment to 
protecting additional wetlands, Maguire Thomas wants a promise that government 
agencies will expeditiously process all applications for zoning approvals and 
building permits. 
</P>
<P>
Galanter says that is a fair request. 
</P>
<P>
"What they are basically asking from the city and all these other agencies is, 
if we do all these things for you -- change the whole plan, hire all these 
consultants, get out of the wetlands and so on and so on -- what we are 
entitled to in return is a fair break in getting this new, reduced, more 
expensive plan implemented so we can make money instead of carrying the thing 
forever. 
</P>
<P>
"And if they do all these things," Galanter said, "I think they have a 
reasonable argument." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Revised Playa Vista Plan 
</P>
<P>
The overall development plan for Playa Vista has been completely recast by its 
developer, Maguire Thomas Partners. 
</P>
<P>
THE PLAYA VISTA PROJECT 
</P>
<P>
 Facts and figures on the Playa Vista development project: 
</P>
<P>
 HISTORY: Howard Hughes bought the land in the 1940s and the land was part of 
his estate when he died in 1976. Hughes' company, Summa Corp., was the 
principal developer until last year, when it sold controlling interest to 
Maguire Thomas Partners of Santa Monica. Summa has retained a minority 
investment in the project. 
</P>
<P>
SIZE: 887 acres in an irregularly shaped, three-mile-long parcel at the base of 
the Westchester bluffs. About 270 acres of wetlands are to be preserved as bird 
and wildlife habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 As currently envisioned by the developer, Playa Vista will include: 
</P>
<P>
5 million square feet of office space, more than twice the amount in the 
44-story twin towers of Century City. 
</P>
<P>
11,750 residential units. 
</P>
<P>
720,000 square feet of retail space, slightly more than that in the Westside 
Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
2,400 hotel rooms, more than twice the Century Plaza Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
A marina of more than 40 acres, with 750 boat slips and residential buildings 
up to eight stories tall. 
</P>
<P>
PLAYA VISTA vs. PORTER RANCH: A COMPARISON 
</P>
<P>
 Only one other development in the works in Los Angeles is even close in size 
to Playa Vista. The Porter Ranch project in the northwest San Fernando Valley 
occupies a larger area, but more development is envisioned at Playa Vista. Here 
is a comparison of the two projects: 
</P>
<P>
SIZE 
</P>
<P>
* Playa Vista: 887 acres. 
</P>
<P>
* Porter Ranch: 1,300 acres. 
</P>
<P>
HOUSING 
</P>
<P>
* Playa Vista: 11,750 condominiums and apartments (no single-family homes). 
</P>
<P>
* Porter Ranch: 3,395 single-family houses and townhouses. 
</P>
<P>
STATUS 
</P>
<P>
* Playa Vista: Developers are preparing environmental impact studies, the last 
step before seeking final city, county and state Coastal Commission approval; 
construction not expected until 1992. 
</P>
<P>
* Porter Ranch: Environmental reviews completed; awaiting final City Council 
action; start of construction possible later this year.

"My Son Was Not Born to Die in Azerbaijan!" 
</P>
<P>
The hand-lettered sign, held up by a Russian mother at a weekend rally in

Misha is in Azerbaijan. Who sent him there, and why? 
</P>
<P>
"Enough Russian blood has been spilled by this government in places like 
Afghanistan. None need be spilled in Azerbaijan or Armenia." 
</P>
<P>
Even as the Soviet army tightens its control on Azerbaijan after fighting its 
way into the republic's capital of Baku a week ago, strong sentiments are 
developing, particularly among ethnic Russians, for pulling the troops out 
before they are trapped in a lengthy peacekeeping operation that already is 
threatened with guerrilla warfare. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a job for police officers, perhaps, not soldiers," a young army 
officer from an anti-establishment military group called Shield told the rally. 
"We will defend the motherland to the death -- that is our oath. But why are we 
fighting our own countrymen? How great was the danger that the army had to be 
deployed?" 
</P>
<P>
Troops were sent into Baku after a week of anti-Armenian violence, 
characterized as pogroms by the government, in which 72 people were killed. 
According to military commanders, 125 more people, including 27 soldiers and 
police officers, died in the week of fighting that followed. A number of other 
deaths, including those of two soldiers, were reported over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
When the government dispatched more than 100,000 troops to Afghanistan a decade 
ago for what became the Soviet Union's longest war, only a few dissidents 
protested, and they were promptly punished. 
</P>
<P>
But the bitterness left from that 10-year war, the 15,000 Soviet lives that it 
claimed and the billions of dollars that it cost have made it difficult to use 
the army, even inside the Soviet Union, in an unpopular cause. That development 
reflects the many fundamental political changes that are taking place here. 
</P>
<P>
"Why should Russian lads die for these (no-goods)?" a speaker from Pamyat, an 
ultra-nationalistic group, asked at the rally. The speaker employed a vulgar 
and highly chauvinistic term that many Russians use for people from Armenia and 
Azerbaijan, the neighboring southern republic of Georgia and Soviet Central 
Asia. 
</P>
<P>
"These places are not worth Russian lives. Let them fight each other, let them 
kill, let them die, but get our lads out of it." 
</P>
<P>
Although Pamyat is regarded by most Soviet observers as extremist in many of 
its positions, it draws on an upsurge of Russian nationalism. That trend has 
been stimulated, in part, by the strongly anti-Soviet, anti-Russian movements 
in many of the Soviet Union's constituent republics -- and by the visceral but 
growing feeling that Russia might be better off without those rebellious 
regions. 
</P>
<P>
The government's assertion that militant Azerbaijani nationalists, led by the 
Azerbaijani Popular Front, were about to take over Baku and end Soviet rule 
there is widely dismissed, even in the Soviet news media. 
</P>
<P>
"Sons and parents ask themselves: What kind of mission do the soldiers fulfill, 
and for whose miscalculations and irresponsibility will they have to pay with 
their own blood?" the liberal news magazine New Times commented Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"Who issued the order?" the newspaper Workers' Tribune asked in a highly 
critical account, also published Sunday, of how army reservists were mobilized 
in three military districts in southern Russia two weeks ago. Russia is the 
largest republic in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that the military ordered only Slavs -- Russians, Ukrainians and 
Byelorussians -- to be called up, apparently to ensure reliability in the 
politically volatile situation in Armenia and Azerbaijan, the paper said this 
provoked days of protest demonstrations, mostly by mothers and wives, in the 
cities of Krasnodar and Stavropol. 
</P>
<P>
Why, the women demanded, were their sons and husbands called upon and not those 
from other nationalities? Why were any reservists needed? Were there not enough 
regular troops and internal security forces in the country? And why were they 
rounded up in the dead of the night and put on planes for Azerbaijan without 
any explanation, not even the disclosure of their destination? The number of 
those called up is still undisclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Military authorities began the mobilization secretly, "practically taking away 
people by force," according to the independent news bulletin Glasnost. But 
angry mothers and wives ran after the mobilization units, throwing themselves 
in front of their trucks and then laying siege to local military headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Women's committees were quickly established to organize more protests, 
including mass demonstrations and warning strikes, and this brought 
cancellation of the call-up, but only after thousands of the reservists were 
already deployed in Azerbaijan. 
</P>
<P>
Even local Communist Party officials, few of whom were informed of the move, 
are expressing their opposition to the mobilization of reservists and their 
deployment in Armenia and Azerbaijan. 
</P>
<P>
Igor K. Polozkov, the party first secretary in Krasnodar, told the newspaper 
Komsomolskaya Pravda that the local reaction was so negative, a virtual revolt, 
that it has threatened the traditionally strong support that the party and 
government have there. 
</P>
<P>
"The reaction could not have been different," Polozkov said, criticizing the 
order's implementation, particularly the selective call-up of only Slavs and 
the suddenness with which it was carried out. "Times have changed, and people 
are totally different now." 
</P>
<P>
In its defense, the military has explained that, to enforce a state of 
emergency in Baku, a city of nearly 2 million people, at least 40,000 troops 
would be needed initially and that more would be required to separate the 
heavily armed Armenian and Azerbaijani militias elsewhere in the region. 
</P>
<P>
Only 22,000 internal security troops were immediately available, however, and 
officials have contended that regular soldiers could not be quickly deployed 
without pulling them out of front-line positions. 
</P>
<P>
But officers belonging to Shield, which seeks democratization of the Soviet 
armed forces and the application of "new political thinking" there, said the 
real reason appeared to be the desire of top commanders for all-Slavic units to 
go into Baku. Reserve units, which are constituted on a territorial basis, are 
often homogenous while regular units are made up of soldiers from dozens of 
different ethnic backgrounds.

SOUTHLAND WINDS TAKE A BREATHER; L.A. HIGH HITS 78

Diminishing winds greeted the Southland on Sunday, compared to the fierce gusts 
that swept some areas the previous 36 hours. 
</P>
<P>
A wind advisory was still in effect Sunday morning for the Cajon Pass area of 
Interstate 15 between Devore and Ontario, where a sandstorm, whipped by gusts 
up to 80 m.p.h., created zero visibility early Saturday and led to a 
chain-reaction collision involving 17 cars. 
</P>
<P>
Several motorists sustained injuries ranging from minor cuts and bruises to a 
heart attack and a broken hip, and four remained hospitalized Sunday, the 
California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
By Sunday morning, the winds were calm and skies were clear in the Inland 
Empire and similar conditions were expected to prevail through today, according 
to the National Weather Service. 
</P>
<P>
The violent, 15-foot coastal swells in the Channel Islands -- which claimed the 
life of a Northern California man who was swept off his sailboat late Friday -- 
had also diminished substantially by Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
"We probably aren't going to see anything worse for a while," said Coast Guard 
Lt. John Williams. 
</P>
<P>
The victim was identified Sunday as Stewart Kett, 63, of Watsonville. His body 
was found Saturday off the Santa Barbara coast after an all-night search by the 
Coast Guard and Navy. 
</P>
<P>
Four others, including Kett's son-in-law, were aboard the 50-foot Octavia, 
which was bound for San Diego for a race to Manzanillo, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
The son-in-law, Fred Sampson, 37, also of Watsonville, said the yacht had been 
sailing at a "very fast" speed when, suddenly, "it lurched forward" after being 
struck by a large wave. 
</P>
<P>
Kett was sitting in the cockpit seat. 
</P>
<P>
"He ducked to avoid the spray from the wave and went straight over the side," 
Sampson said. 
</P>
<P>
Kett -- who is survived by his wife, Alice, 62, and four children -- was an 
avid yachtsman who had been honored by the Coast Guard for rescuing two sailors 
from stormy seas during a 1982 race in San Francisco, Sampson said. 
</P>
<P>
Above-average temperatures in the beach cities Sunday attracted a large crowd 
to Santa Monica, said Bill Powers, a Los Angeles County senior lifeguard. 
</P>
<P>
The mercury reached 71 degrees there. The Los Angeles Civic Center high topped 
out at 78, 11 degrees above normal, but well below the 90-degree record for the 
date set in 1971, the NWS said. 
</P>
<P>
The high-pressure area over the Western states that spawned the high winds and 
warm temperatures was expected to slowly weaken today bringing 10 to 12 m.p.h. 
gusts and slightly cooler temperatures, forecasters said.

MAN AWAITS DEATH SENTENCE FOR MURDERS OF 3; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: DEAN PHILIP CARTER IS ACCUSED OF STRANGLING FIVE WOMEN IN 18 DAYS. HE 
STILL FACES TRIAL IN TWO OF THE CASES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
"I intend to be at the execution," the gentle, gray-haired woman said quietly. 
"I want to see him die." 
</P>
<P>
The tall, handsome, often charming man Sue Mills was talking about is Dean 
Philip Carter, 34, adopted son of a police chief, doting father of twins and 
skilled television cameraman who did commended work on a documentary about the 
heritage of Eskimos. 
</P>
<P>
He is also the man accused of strangling five California women -- one of them 
Sue Mills' daughter -- after raping at least two of them and two other women, 
all in the space of 18 days. Authorities say that in addition, he is a suspect 
in several other rapes. 
</P>
<P>
Convicted last year in three of those 1984 murders -- the slayings of Jillette 
Leonora Mills and Susan Knoll in Culver City and Bonnie Ann Guthrie in West Los 
Angeles -- Carter is scheduled to be formally sentenced to death Tuesday. He 
still faces trial in the murders of Tok Chum Kim in Oakland and Janette Ann 
Cullins in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
During the complex legal proceedings that have dragged on for more than five 
years, Carter has never shown the slightest remorse, according to Marsh 
Goldstein, the Los Angeles deputy district attorney who won the three murder 
convictions. 
</P>
<P>
"He never said that he was sorry. He never said anything," Goldstein said. 
"He's one of the most evil people I've ever seen -- an absolutely awful, 
non-human being. 
</P>
<P>
"If you believe society has the right to impose the death penalty . . . then 
this is the case where it should be applied." 
</P>
<P>
Helen Cullins, the mother of victim Janette Cullins, put it more succinctly: 
</P>
<P>
"I think he should be strangled," she said. "That's the way he killed my 
daughter." 
</P>
<P>
Police say Carter knew all his victims, most of whom he had met in bars and 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a very smooth-talking individual," said Richard Haas, an investigator in 
one of the rape cases. "He could meet somebody and sell himself in a very brief 
time." 
</P>
<P>
Searching for what may have prompted the brutal crimes for which Carter is 
blamed and convicted, prosecutors and probation officials can point only to his 
troubled childhood in Alaska and a marriage that ended in estrangement from the 
sons he loved. 
</P>
<P>
Born the illegitimate son of a half-Eskimo woman in Nome, Alaska, on Aug. 30, 
1955, Carter was later adopted by the man who married his mother and served as 
police chief, fire chief and justice of the peace in the remote community on 
the bleak, wind-swept shores of the Bering Sea. 
</P>
<P>
Probation reports and testimony elicited by defense attorneys indicate the boy 
defied his strict and alcoholic parents at an early age. At one point, before 
he had reached the age of 10, his stepfather reportedly shackled him to his bed 
to keep him from wandering Nome's streets at night. 
</P>
<P>
When he was 12, Carter was declared a delinquent child and committed to a youth 
camp, from which he attempted to run away at least three times. He later was 
placed in a foster home. According to Goldstein, Carter's crimes continued and 
"by the time he was 14 or 15, he was a fairly confirmed burglar." He later 
served adult prison terms in Oregon for auto theft and in Alaska for burglary. 
</P>
<P>
While in prison in Alaska, Carter was trained as a television cameraman and 
video technician. And for a while, it looked as though things might turn out 
all right for Dean Philip Carter. 
</P>
<P>
After he was released in 1979, Carter landed a series of jobs with television 
stations in Alaska. While working as a cameraman in Nome, he was part of a team 
that won an award for a documentary on the Eskimo heritage. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Johnson, one of Carter's bosses on the project, remembered Carter as 
"just a normal guy, very attractive, very handsome." 
</P>
<P>
"He was holding steady employment, getting involved in the community," said 
Nome Police Sgt. Mike Murphy. "He spent quite a bit of time down in the bars, 
but everybody here spends time in the bars, especially in the winter." 
</P>
<P>
It was about that time that Carter met and married a woman -- previously 
married, with a daughter -- who lived in that area. Not long afterward, 
Carter's wife gave birth to twin sons. 
</P>
<P>
"He doted on those sons, but he was never around, moving all the time from job 
to job," Goldstein said. "He romanticized his position as a husband and a 
father, but it was make-believe -- all of the desire but none of the 
performance." 
</P>
<P>
After about three years, Carter's wife divorced him. 
</P>
<P>
"She got custody of the children and would not let him see them," Goldstein 
said. "He told friends he was very angry, very bitter." 
</P>
<P>
Carter got more jobs as a cameraman, working briefly in Seattle before 
returning to Alaska. There, in the latter part of 1983, he met friends who 
offered to let him stay with them in Honolulu. In December, 1983, Carter flew 
to Hawaii, signing on about a month later as a deckhand on a yacht that was 
headed for San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, he got a job as a deckhand on another boat and began dating Susan 
Loyland, a bartender at a cocktail lounge near the waterfront. Loyland said he 
visited her at her home in the Clairemont area several times in the days that 
followed. During those visits, Carter met and talked with the 45-year-old woman 
who shared Loyland's apartment, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators say Carter was frequently out of town during that period, often 
visiting friends in the Los Angeles and Ventura areas. Loyland said she had a 
date to go with him to Mexico on March 25, 1984, but due to a mix-up, she 
missed picking him up at a San Diego bus station that afternoon and left on the 
trip without him. 
</P>
<P>
Later that night, police say, Carter -- armed with a knife -- entered Loyland's 
home through an unlocked window. 
</P>
<P>
"The bartender was out, so he raped the roommate," Goldstein said. 
</P>
<P>
Police say that after the sexual attack, Carter tied the woman hand and foot, 
stole some of her money and left. 
</P>
<P>
About a day later, investigators say, Carter turned up in Ventura, where he had 
visited some friends a few weeks earlier. During those visits, Carter met and 
dated a 22-year-old waitress who lived in the same building as Carter's 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted to make love to her," said Jim Grunert, a deputy district attorney 
in Ventura. "She said no." 
</P>
<P>
The woman testified later that shortly after midnight March 29, she awoke to 
the sound of someone crawling through her kitchen window. Sitting up, she saw a 
man, masked with a bandanna and carrying a butcher knife, standing in her 
bedroom doorway. She said that despite the mask, she recognized the intruder 
immediately as Dean Philip Carter. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next 5 1/2 hours, the woman said, Carter forced her to orally copulate 
him three times and raped her once. Twice, she said, Carter choked her into 
unconsciousness -- the first time when she made a vain attempt to escape and 
the second time when she tried to scream for help. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, she said, Carter took her car keys and led her to the front door. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt he would carry me away and kill me," the young woman testified. 
</P>
<P>
Concluding that an escape attempt was futile, the woman resorted instead to 
conversation, hoping to save her life by persuading Carter that she wanted to 
help him, Grunert said. 
</P>
<P>
"I took hold of his face and I talked to him," the woman testified. "I told him 
to try to remember what he was doing and who he was and who I was and that he 
didn't have to do this. . . . I was trying to reason with him." 
</P>
<P>
The woman said Carter didn't respond -- "he just had a blank look on his face." 
</P>
<P>
"But she kept his mind going," said Haas, one of Grunert's investigators. "She 
kept talking the whole time. That's what saved her life." 
</P>
<P>
After the final sexual attack, "she hugged him, told him he was 'beautiful,' 
and said that she had to go to work," Grunert said. "She got up, dressed very 
matter-of-factly, as though nothing was wrong, and told him how to get to the 
bus station. And he left." 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, the woman rushed to the apartment of a friend and telephoned 
police. But it was too late. Carter was nowhere to be found. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Offered Help 
</P>
<P>
Three days later, on April 1, Carter turned up at a singles bar called the 
Rocking Horse in Lafayette, a residential community 10 miles northeast of 
Oakland, according to police. There, they say, he met a 36-year-old Korean 
woman, Tok Chum Kim, who was working as a hairdresser in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Kim, who was divorced from the American serviceman she had met and married in 
her native land, left the bar but returned moments later, complaining of car 
trouble. Police say Carter offered to help, and the pair ended up at her 
apartment in Oakland, where they were seen together several times during the 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
On April 12, after the woman's supervisor became worried because Kim had failed 
to show up for work, police broke into her apartment to find her body, sprawled 
on the bedroom floor. 
</P>
<P>
"She had been strangled with a curtain tie," said Sgt. Bob Conner, an Oakland 
police detective. "Her body was too decomposed to determine whether she had 
been raped." 
</P>
<P>
Police say Carter, driving Kim's car, next turned up in the Los Angeles area, 
where he had gotten to know Jillette Mills, Susan Knoll and Bonnie Guthrie 
during his frequent trips north while living in the San Diego area. 
</P>
<P>
Guthrie, 24, and Knoll, 33, who had known each other in Wisconsin, had renewed 
their friendship when they both ended up in the Los Angeles area. Guthrie 
operated a sweater-knitting business out of her West Los Angeles home and Knoll 
worked in a bank. Guthrie lived alone, while Knoll roomed with Mills, a 
25-year-old computer programmer, in an apartment in Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Carter apparently had met the three women at a bar in Santa Monica. 
According to police and friends, Carter probably dated Knoll for a while, but 
later, apparently at Knoll's instigation, their relationship cooled. Guthrie 
told friends she found Carter "strange." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bodies in Closet 
</P>
<P>
From the evidence they were able to piece together, police believe Carter drove 
up to the apartment in Culver City on April 10. Knoll apparently was alone in 
the apartment at the time. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it started out sort of friendly," Goldstein said. "There were glasses 
of wine. I assume he made advances that were rejected. I believe he raped 
(Knoll) and killed her; then Mills walked in and he raped and strangled her 
too." 
</P>
<P>
The next day, concerned that they had not heard from her, Mills' brother and a 
friend entered the apartment to find the bodies of Mills and Knoll crammed -- 
one atop the other -- in a bedroom closet. Kim's car was parked in front of the 
building. 
</P>
<P>
The same day, police say, Carter went to West Los Angeles, where he had an 
appointment to see Guthrie about having her make him a sweater. 
</P>
<P>
Later that day, the manager of Guthrie's apartment house entered her unit to 
make some repairs. Seeing his tenant apparently asleep on the bedroom floor, 
the manager left quietly. The next day, the manager re-entered the apartment 
and realized that Guthrie was dead. Police say she was raped before she was 
strangled. 
</P>
<P>
On April 12, police say, Carter, driving a white Nissan 280-Z sports car with a 
license plate reading "PHNTM Z" that he had stolen from Mills, showed up in San 
Diego. There he reportedly stopped that afternoon at the apartment of 
24-year-old Janette Cullins, who worked as a receptionist for a San Diego firm. 
</P>
<P>
According to her friends and family, Carter had meet Cullins two months earlier 
at a bar in the Pacific Beach area. "Carter had kept trying to contact Janette, 
but she rejected him," Cullins' mother, Helen Cullins, said. 
</P>
<P>
On the night of April 12, Janette Cullins attended a San Diego Symphony concert 
with a former roommate, Nancy Schick, who dropped Cullins off at her apartment 
about 11 p.m. Later that night, neighbors heard loud voices coming from the 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
The next morning, Schick returned to the apartment, didn't see Cullins and was 
about to leave when a man drove up in a white 280-Z, according to Schick's 
testimony. She said she told the man she hadn't seen Cullins, and he asked, 
"Are you sure?" 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Schick said, she returned to the apartment and found her friend's 
body on the floor of a bedroom closet. Cullins had been strangled. 
</P>
<P>
On April 13, police say, a security camera photographed Carter as he used 
Cullins' bank card at an automatic teller machine to clean out her account. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators say Carter then drove to Las Vegas, where he spent a couple of 
days before heading east through Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
On April 17, about 10:50 p.m., Arizona Highway Patrolman Bob Dapster heard a 
trucker complain over a citizens band radio about an erratic driver in a white 
280-Z. Moments later, Dapster said, Carter drove by. 
</P>
<P>
"I had seen a black cat earlier in the night and sometimes you just get a 
feeling," Dapster said. "Something told me things weren't right with that car." 
</P>
<P>
Dapster said he pulled Carter over without incident. Moments later, the officer 
realized he had a serial murder suspect. 
</P>
<P>
In the car, police said, were items belonging to Kim, Knoll, Mills, Guthrie and 
the rape victims in San Diego and Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Convicted of Rape 
</P>
<P>
Carter's trial for the rape in Ventura began in the fall of 1984. He declined 
to testify, with his defense built on an attempt to persuade a jury that the 
woman had consented to the sexual relations. In November, 1984, Carter was 
convicted of the rape and sentenced to 54 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
The other legal proceedings against him moved more slowly. Prosecutors say that 
was largely because of delays caused by the death of a judge, the appointment 
of one defense attorney to the bench and Carter's decision to change attorneys 
twice. 
</P>
<P>
The combined trials for the murders of Mills, Knoll and Guthrie dragged on for 
weeks. This time, attorneys presented no defense. Relying instead on an attempt 
to save him from the death penalty, defense attorney Howard Gillingham called 
21 witnesses to testify about Carter's troubled childhood. 
</P>
<P>
On July 16, 1989, a jury convicted Carter of the three murders and two rapes 
(no evidence was presented as to whether Knoll was sexually assaulted). Three 
weeks later, the same jury recommended a death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Carter still faces trials for the murder of Cullins and the rape of the woman 
in San Diego. Prosecution in the Kim murder is still pending. 
</P>
<P>
Once identified as a possible suspect in the so-called "Green River" murders of 
24 women in Washington, Carter is said to have been out of the state when many 
of those crimes were committed and he has never been charged in connection with 
those cases. 
</P>
<P>
However, officials say he has been identified as a "strong" suspect in some 
rapes in the Seattle area, and police say they plan to question him in 
connection with some sexual attacks in Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Santa Monica Superior Court Judge Robert W. Thomas is scheduled to 
formally impose the death penalty for the murders of Mills, Knoll and Guthrie. 
</P>
<P>
"He murdered five people by strangulation," Goldstein told the jury that 
recommended the gas chamber. "For someone who did what he did for the reasons 
that he did it, there is no other sentence possible but death. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"This is not the conduct of a person who should be allowed to live."

FOUR ETHNIC ALBANIANS SLAIN IN YUGOSLAVIA AS 10,000 DEMONSTRATE

Police on Sunday shot and killed four ethnic Albanians, bringing to at least 14 
the number killed in weekend political protests in Yugoslavia's troubled 
southern province of Kosovo, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
The four were killed as police battled about 10,000 demonstrators in Suva Reka, 
30 miles southwest of Pristina, the regional capital, residents said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said police killed at least 10 ethnic Albanians in Kosovo in rioting 
on Saturday, including four in Orahovac, 190 miles south of Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
The weekend unrest was the worst violence to hit Kosovo since 28 people died 
last year when ethnic Albanians rioted against restrictions on the province's 
self-rule. The restrictions were seen as biased in favor of Yugoslavia's 
biggest republic, Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
At Orahovac, witnesses said four men were killed Saturday when police opened 
fire on up to 2,000 Albanians demonstrating for free elections, the resignation 
of local leaders and freeing of political prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
Villagers said at least two other men were killed nearby, and witnesses said 
three were shot in Djakovica, six miles from the Albanian border, and one in 
Pec. 
</P>
<P>
Local journalists said there were new protests Sunday in Orahovac, but no 
details were available.

Centrists in Poland's dying Communist Party were locked in a daylong struggle 
Sunday to rid themselves of hard-liners in the hope of demonstrating to a 
skeptical public that their new party is something more than the old one with a 
paint job. 
</P>
<P>
It was proving to be a hard fight because the hard-liners in the old Communist 
Party, known as the United Workers Party, have nowhere else to go but with 
their comrades, now looking for new political life as Social Democrats in the 
Western European mold. 
</P>
<P>
A group of reformers is also threatening a split, complaining, their leader 
said, that a "hybrid party, a bag containing everything, will not do." 
</P>
<P>
The centrist -- and largest -- group in the party's three-day congress is led 
by 35-year-old Alexander Kwasniewski, who has emerged as the likely leader of 
the Social Democracy Party of the Republic of Poland, as the new party was 
named in a vote Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
A protege of the outgoing party general secretary, Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski, 
Kwasniewski has been a swiftly rising party liberal who is seen as offering a 
sharp generational break with the past. 
</P>
<P>
Although giving some lip service to the idea of unity for the party, he told 
the congress -- early in its 15-hour meeting Sunday -- that he is not for 
"unity at any price." 
</P>
<P>
Many hours later, in the corridors of the Palace of Culture where the congress 
was going on, he told a reporter that he hopes the hard-liners will "go off and 
make their own party." 
</P>
<P>
"We have to make a pressure so that those people who would kill our credibility 
will not leave this meeting in our company," said Ludwig Krasucki, the liberal 
editor of the party's theoretical journal and a longtime advocate of party 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
To apply the pressure, the Kwasniewski group forced through a platform billed 
as strictly "social democratic," avoiding any reference to socialism in the 
platform. 
</P>
<P>
The party's hard-liners complained ("We are being pushed to the wall!" said 
one), but the platform passed overwhelmingly. At one point, the presiding 
officer of the congress turned off the microphone of Jerzy Micah, the 
conservative editor of the party's newspaper, Trybuna Ludu. Micah, enraged, 
continued to shout. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not the office of Trybuna Ludu," the chairman said. "Stop shouting at 
me." 
</P>
<P>
Unhappy as they were, however, the hard-liners went along with the votes as 
dictated by the new generation in obvious control. 
</P>
<P>
The reformist wing, led by Tadeusz Fiszbach, a member of Parliament from 
Gdansk, claimed to have taken away about 100 delegates, including, its 
spokesmen said, about 30 members of the United Workers Party caucus in the 
Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Fiszbach walked out of Saturday's opening session of the congress. However, he 
returned Sunday to present his arguments to the assembly, asserting that "if we 
don't make accounts for the past 45 years, we will be openly committing suicide 
together." 
</P>
<P>
The reception was decidedly cool for Fiszbach, who was accused of "personal 
ambitions." 
</P>
<P>
"It is not true that we are trying to split the party," said one of the 
centrist group, Janusz Bryk of Warsaw. "The party has been split for decades. 
Successive leaders of the party tried to ignore this." 
</P>
<P>
Hard-liners fought back with their own speeches, which drew surprisingly lusty 
rounds of applause, indicating that, whatever the new political realities, old 
sympathies remain strong. 
</P>
<P>
Jan Ryzhlewski, one of the hard-liners, warned of what he called a "right-wing 
totalitarianism" emerging in Poland and urged that the new party not surrender 
its former toughness. "We need a party with teeth," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kwasniewski and other party figures have admitted that the party -- under 
whatever name -- will have a difficult time winning public credibility. Its 
first challenge will be local elections, now set for April. The Communists were 
trounced by Solidarity candidates in elections last June. 
</P>
<P>
The United Workers Party has claimed 1.9 million members, but the new party's 
leaders expect a sharp drop in membership.

MANAGUA FREES U.S. FUNDS FOR POLL MONITORS

<TEXT>
<P>
The Sandinista government agreed Sunday to an immediate transfer of $1.5 
million in U.S. funds tied up in Nicaragua's central bank to an institute that 
will train opposition poll watchers for the upcoming Nicaraguan elections, 
former U.S. President Jimmy Carter announced. 
</P>
<P>
Carter, who mediated and co-signed the agreement after three days of talks 
here, also announced that President Daniel Ortega has promised to issue 
"private instructions and public declarations" against intimidation of 
opposition poll watchers and to allow a dozen U.S. lawmakers to monitor the 
Feb. 25 vote. 
</P>
<P>
Carter's visit came amid assertions by the Bush Administration and the National 
Opposition Union (UNO), the U.S.-backed anti-Sandinista coalition, that 
intimidation and harassment of the opposition are systematic and raise 
questions about the fairness of the election. 
</P>
<P>
Carter said he sees "no evidence" that the revolutionary government is 
preparing vote fraud to reelect Ortega. But he said any obstacles to opposition 
monitors could cloud the validity of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
"If, on election night, we find that a substantial number of poll watchers have 
been intimidated so they can't come to these remote polling places, then I 
think the returns from those places will be seriously in doubt," Carter said. 
"And if the vote is very close and you have a substantial number of those 
(places) that could have cast the election to the (Sandinistas), I would 
declare that the results of the election were not certifiable." 
</P>
<P>
Carter said he used that argument in telling Sandinista leaders that full 
coverage by the opposition of all 4,394 polling stations was in their interest. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement releases money appropriated Oct. 21 by Congress for the Institute 
for Electoral Promotion and Training. In return, the Sandinistas were assured 
that the money will not be used for the campaign of UNO presidential candidate 
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro. 
</P>
<P>
The Sandinistas had blocked the funds for more than a month on grounds that the 
institute had failed to undergo the required, lengthy process of registering as 
a nonprofit organization. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega's decision to admit U.S. congressional observers was a step back from 
his insistence that the Bush Administration first stop all funding of the 
Nicaraguan rebels.

QUAYLE TOURS PANAMA, GETS WARM RECEPTION; 
</P>

DIPLOMACY: BUT HE VISITS TRADITIONALLY PRO-AMERICAN NEIGHBORHOODS. COUNTRY IS 
STILL FIRMLY UNDER MILITARY OCCUPATION.

PANAMA CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vice President Dan Quayle toured Panama on Sunday in a series of photo 
opportunities designed, aides said, to demonstrate to the world that the 
country has returned to normal. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly cheered by a series of warm receptions at an open air market, a church 
and a restaurant overlooking the Pacific, Quayle praised Panamanian support for 
the U.S. invasion last month that overthrew dictator Manuel A. Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
Having "walked out with the people," he said in a television interview, he can 
see "they're glad for what we did." 
</P>
<P>
The expressions of public support appeared to be widespread, although most of 
Quayle's visits were to neighborhoods of upper-class, traditionally 
pro-American section of the populace -- not the lower-class population that 
once provided Noriega's power base. 
</P>
<P>
But while the support may be genuine, the picture of normality clearly is not. 
As Quayle spoke Sunday morning, dozens of American troops, their faces daubed 
with camouflage paint, ringed the hotel where the interview was taking place, 
establishing positions on nearby rooftops. As he moved through the city, 
military vehicles with machine guns made up nearly one-fourth of Quayle's 
21-car motorcade. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the city, the U.S. Army continues to maintain fortified positions on 
main roads. And as Quayle's interview, on ABC's "This Week with David 
Brinkley," was broadcast over the Southcom Network -- the U.S. armed forces 
television here -- a message scrolled across the bottom of the screen. It 
reminded American servicemen that a nighttime curfew remains in effect, 
off-base trips are restricted and visits to "public areas" are to be avoided. 
</P>
<P>
Five weeks after the U.S. invasion, the number of U.S. troops here is being 
reduced and life has largely returned to normal, at least in the city, but 
Panama is still firmly under American military occupation. 
</P>
<P>
The duration of that occupation was the chief topic as Quayle met Sunday 
morning with President Guillermo Endara and his two vice presidents, Ricardo 
Arias Calderon and Guillermo (Billy) Ford. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration would like to reduce troop strength here to 
pre-invasion levels as rapidly as possible because of "the international 
relations aspects," an Administration official traveling with Quayle noted. 
Latin American leaders with whom Quayle met Saturday in Honduras emphasized 
their desire to see the troops withdrawn quickly. 
</P>
<P>
But Endara and his government -- although they also would like to see troop 
numbers reduced eventually -- are more concerned about having Americans 
available "to preserve public safety," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
The new government has been working to create a new police force out of the 
remnants of Noriega's Panama Defense Forces, but so far, U.S. officials admit, 
progress has been slow. Street crime levels are substantially higher than 
before the invasion, and sporadic shooting has continued in parts of the 
country's interior. 
</P>
<P>
While many Panamanians would like to keep the U.S. Army, the country is much 
less enthusiastic about an army of its own. "Panama doesn't need an army," 
Endara said on the Brinkley program. "Panama needs a police force." 
</P>
<P>
If Panama follows that rule, it will join Costa Rica, which abolished its army 
in 1948, as a notable exception to the region's tradition of strong, highly 
politicized armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government during the 1960s encouraged Panama to build up its army to 
protect the Panama Canal, and earlier this month Administration officials 
expressed uneasiness about the prospect of the nation following the Costa Rican 
model. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle, however, said the Administration now regards it as a "good idea." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials now feel that if any truly serious military threat to the canal 
emerged, the U.S. would have to intervene -- as it has the right to do under 
the Panama Canal Treaties -- whether or not Panama had an army, a senior 
official said.

FREELOADING SEA LIONS WEAR OUT WELCOME, FACE EVICTION 
</P>

BALLARD, Wash. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A "gang of marauding sea lions" has discovered that there is such a thing as a 
free lunch 1,500 miles from their California home, touching off a political 
battle that could spell slaughter for dozens of the animals under the very law 
designed to protect them. 
</P>
<P>
Washington state officials have spent five years and hundreds of thousands of 
dollars trying to keep the flippered freeloaders from decimating a prized run 
of wild steelhead trout in a shipping channel between Puget Sound and Lake 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Rock music, killer whale recordings, tainted fish and 6,000 rounds of M-80 
firecrackers so far have failed to discourage the 40 to 60 sea lions who 
consider the man-made fish ladder at Ballard Locks their private smorgasbord. 
</P>
<P>
"We're at the bottom of our bag of tricks relative to non-lethal measures," 
admitted Joe Scordino, deputy director of the northwest regional offices of the 
National Marine Fisheries Service, which has jurisdiction over the animals. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Washington is hoping to get $170,000 in federal funding to capture 
the sea lions and truck them home to the Channel Islands off Santa Barbara, but 
California is balking at the plan, even suggesting at one point that shooting 
the sea lions would be a preferable solution. 
</P>
<P>
Washington fish and wildlife officials are now combing the National Marine 
Mammals Protection Act for legal loopholes that would allow them to do just 
that as a last resort -- a precedent that could dramatically alter 
interpretation of the 1972 law. 
</P>
<P>
The fight over the fate of the creatures Seattle fans generically nicknamed 
"Herschel" is considered unique because it makes man both the instigator and 
the mediator in a conflict between two wild species. 
</P>
<P>
Some say the dwindling steelhead run represents far more than a convenient 
recreational opportunity for local anglers, or a modest income for the two 
Indian tribes whose treaty rights permit commercial trout fishing. 
</P>
<P>
"The greatest value of that run is as an environmental barometer," said Bob 
Byrne, spokesman for the Washington Department of Wildlife, which oversees the 
steelhead. "It serves as a miner's canary on how we treat our environment. As 
long as the fish live, it must be relatively clean. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, there are other steelhead runs in other places. But there's a danger in 
that argument . . . . Then you can say 'let me cut this tree or pollute this 
stream -- there's always more,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
But some environmentalists disagree that sea lions are the culprit in the Case 
of the Disappearing Fish. 
</P>
<P>
"Different things are adding to the steelhead decline," said local Greenpeace 
spokeswoman Cynthia Rust. "Habitat destruction, for example. In Seattle, you 
can go to a couple of places where you used to see a spawning stream and find a 
parking lot or mall. 
</P>
<P>
"There's also pollution, and interception of the run by high sea drift-net 
fleets from Japan, Taiwan and Korea," she said. "One Taiwanese vessel was 
apprehended and 4,000 tons of illegal salmon were found in the hold." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, over the years, the sea lions have grown in both number and girth 
at Ballard Locks, devouring up to 64% of a year's steelhead run -- as many as 
2,000 of the large fish. The run peaks from mid-February to mid-March. 
</P>
<P>
The locks and dam were built nearly 80 years ago to control the water level in 
Lake Washington and provide ship and barge traffic between Lake Washington, 
Lake Union and Puget Sound. Part of the channel floor is concrete, and the rest 
is scoured clean for ship traffic. There are no kelp beds or other natural 
hiding places for the migrating fish. 
</P>
<P>
One theory for the sea lions' sudden appearance at Ballard Locks is that they 
began following large schools of fish moving northward with the warming waters 
of El Nino several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Because the locks mark the convergence of fresh and salt water, the fish mill 
downstream while undergoing physiological changes for their freshwater 
migration over the man-made "ladder" of ascending pools which will take them 
around the dam to their spawning streams. 
</P>
<P>
"The fish are sort of in a trance," explained Rust, the spokeswoman for 
Greenpeace, which advocates a physical barrier such as old tires to give the 
fish cover on their way to the ladder. 
</P>
<P>
"The steelhead are maybe slower than usual, and they are single-minded about 
getting upstream despite a predator in the area," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The sea lions are equally determined. 
</P>
<P>
Byrne said he has seen one sea lion alone gobble 16 steelhead in a single day. 
</P>
<P>
"Those sea lions run 900 pounds. They're the size of three Brian Bosworths -- 
three middle linebackers. They need to eat 5% of their body weight a day. They 
want the easy life and they've found it at Ballard Locks." 
</P>
<P>
Although most of the sea lions hunt at the mouth of the locks, about a dozen 
swim right past the ships to take up position at the entrance to the fish 
ladder, where the confused fish wait for the water flow to pull them into the 
system of pools. On a recent day, three of the sea lions frolicked in the water 
spilling from the dam. "The fish are running a sea lion gauntlet," Byrne said. 
</P>
<P>
Passions run so high here that wildlife officials received serious death 
threats last year when they suggested firing rubber bullets at the sea lions to 
drive them off; they are bracing for another outcry this year if an experiment 
with rubber arrows is carried out. On the other hand, fishermen have been known 
to paint "Kill Herschel" signs on their boats. 
</P>
<P>
The Marine Mammals Protection Act allows fishermen to kill the animals if 
necessary to protect their catch and gear, but there is no clear-cut provision 
for state officials to do the same to protect a fish run. 
</P>
<P>
The possible loophole is a provision for destroying marine mammals that 
threaten public resources and welfare. Washington officials are hoping that the 
steelhead run at Ballard Locks might be considered a public resource, even 
though steelhead themselves are not considered an endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
Public hearings on the controversy usually degenerate into shouting matches 
between angry fishermen and environmentalists, and hundreds of solutions -- 
most of them unfeasible -- have poured in from concerned citizens. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had some doozies," Scordino said. 
</P>
<P>
There were people who suggested introducing polar bears to the Locks, which are 
in a park flanking a residential neighborhood about five minutes from downtown 
Seattle. Others wanted to use helicopters to help the steelhead trout escape by 
airlifting them over the small dam. Some firm tried to peddle its chemical 
compound, which turned out to be a derivative of nerve gas. 
</P>
<P>
"People say to pour vinegar in the water, or have the Eskimos come talk to the 
sea lions, or put killer whales in the channel," Scordino said. 
</P>
<P>
A net barrier didn't work, and neither did an acoustical assault with the sea 
lion equivalent of fingernails on a blackboard. 
</P>
<P>
Now, a team of 18 engineers and biologists is studying ways to alter the locks 
and give the fish a fighting chance, but such a permanent solution is expected 
to take years of study and design, not to mention millions of dollars. The Army 
Corps of Engineers must approve -- and probably fund -- any structural changes. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, wildlife officials captured and tagged 39 of the sea lions. The 
tranquilizers killed two, but the remaining 37 were turned loose 300 miles down 
the Washington coast. Twenty-nine showed up again in time for Sunday brunch at 
Ballard Locks. 
</P>
<P>
Biologists say the sea lions are young unmated males who migrate from their 
breeding grounds in the Channel Islands of California when romance fails to 
bloom. They usually head back in May, though a few are beginning to hang around 
Seattle year-round. Eleven of the tagged animals were spotted in the Channel 
Islands during pup counts last summer. 
</P>
<P>
The relocation plan would basically put the sea lions back in the Channel 
Islands two months ahead of their natural calendar, and make the swim back to 
Ballard Locks long enough for the peak steelhead season to pass, according to 
Washington officials. 
</P>
<P>
But California fishermen and state agencies complain that this would merely 
transfer nuisance animals from one place to another without solving the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent letter to the California Coastal Commission, the Pacific Coast 
Federation of Fishermen's Associations bitterly objected to the proposed 
transfer of what it dubbed "a gang of marauding sea lions." 
</P>
<P>
"California sea lions are not (permanent) residents of California," wrote 
executive director Zeke Grader, Jr. "California sea lions have historically 
ranged along the whole Pacific Coast. 
</P>
<P>
"The animal is not some sex offender that can be sent back," he continued. 
"Frankly, the proposal smacks of the California bashing that is all too 
fashionable currently in the state of Washington." 
</P>
<P>
No lawsuits have been filed, but California officials privately say they will 
go to court to block the sea lions' return. 
</P>
<P>
While they agree that 60 sea lions would not make much difference in a 
year-round population of some 80,000, California officials and fishermen worry 
that relocation could open the door for turning the state into a dumping ground 
for problem animals. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Bontadelli, director of the California Department of Fish and Game, told 
Washington officials in a letter last July that the department opposed shifting 
the problem "from one area to another." 
</P>
<P>
"We recognize that available non-lethal options to deal with this problem have 
proven ineffective to date," he wrote. "Therefore, lethal removal of the 
problem animals may be the only practical and effective long-term solution." 
</P>
<P>
Bontadelli could not be reached for further comment. 
</P>
<P>
The California Coastal Commission, going against its own staff findings that a 
sea lion transfer would be harmless, opposed it on similar grounds. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe they should deal with a Washington problem in Washington," said Hal 
Cribbs, executive secretary for the commission. "We're not shipping our 
problems up there." 
</P>
<P>
But whether California has any real say in the matter may also be a matter for 
courts to decide, since the final decision now rests with the National Marine 
Fisheries Service, a federal body. 
</P>
<P>
And California's concerns "aren't realistic," Byrne charged. "They're problem 
animals specific to Ballard Locks. If they were threatening a resource in 
California, they'd stay in California. It's a 1,500-mile trip." 
</P>
<P>
"We've pretty well eliminated easy, inexpensive and low-risk options," the 
Wildlife Department spokesman added. "And we're certainly not willing to give 
up those steelhead."

L.A. CUBANS HONOR A HERO, TALK OF FREEDOM IN HAVANA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL STOLBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On Jan. 28, 1976, members of the Los Angeles Cuban community gathered in Echo 
Park for the unveiling of a bronze bust of Jose Marti, the Cuban poet, 
journalist and revolutionary who is embraced as "the apostle" of his country's 
battle for independence from Spain. 
</P>
<P>
Every Jan. 28 since, local Cuban immigrants -- most of them refugees from the 
Communist government of Fidel Castro -- have gathered near Marti's likeness, 
both to honor his birthday and to talk about what his fight for freedom means 
to them. 
</P>
<P>
With walls tumbling down in Eastern Europe, Sunday's celebration was a little 
more hopeful than most. 
</P>
<P>
"This year it is different because of what is happening in the Communist bloc 
countries in Europe," said Gina Perez, whose husband, Abel, is editor and 
publisher of 20 de Mayo, a local Cuban newspaper. "We are hoping that communism 
in Cuba is getting weaker and weaker. We think that our liberation will be 
soon." 
</P>
<P>
Said Yoel Borges, a member of the California chapter of Junta Patriotica 
Cubana, which organized Sunday's event: "We are trying to produce in Cuba what 
is happening in Europe. We are looking to eliminate Castro's (allies) and the 
Communist Party from our country." 
</P>
<P>
Marti is revered as much in Communist Cuba as he is by Cuban expatriates. 
Havana's airport is named for him, and his tomb is a national shrine. 
</P>
<P>
The birthday celebration (Marti was born in 1853) drew a crowd of several 
hundred, many waving small Cuban flags and holding placards that proclaimed, 
"Cuba Next." After a brief parade and a ceremony in which the participants laid 
flowers before the Marti statue, the crowd heard Borges and other Cuban 
community leaders. 
</P>
<P>
The speakers' strident calls for democracy brought cheers. The crowd included 
Pedro Baez, a nurse and fiction writer who came to the United States a decade 
ago in the Mariel boat lift, and Rene Gonzalez Herrero, a 72-year-old former 
captain in the Cuban military who immigrated in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Herrero, who was imprisoned when Castro came to power in 1959 and stayed in 
jail until he was allowed to leave Cuba, lives in Bell. He soaked up the sun 
and the speeches in a folding chair set up beneath a palm tree. Through an 
interpreter, he said he attended the rally because he wants to see "freedom in 
this year." 
</P>
<P>
Also on hand was Rene Lazaro of Burbank, an amateur film maker who said he 
discovered Herrero while researching a movie he is making on Cuban political 
prisoners. "Most of the Cuban people for the past 29 years have been saying, 
'Next year, Castro will be out of power,' " he said. "I feel that someday, the 
government will give up and step down."

HEALTH: THE COMPLEX AFFLICTION, ONE OF THE MOST COMMON BIRTH DEFECTS, HAS

While Lisa Winslow was pregnant, the question was always in the back of her 
mind: Would her baby, like her husband, Warren, be born with a cleft lip and 
palate? In the delivery room, her doctor's joyful exclamation "It's a boy!" was 
followed by more somber news, "He has a cleft." 
</P>
<P>
Like Kyle Winslow, now 6 years old, one of every 700 babies is born with a 
cleft lip and palate. A cleft lip can be a slight notch in the upper lip or a 
bigger split extending all the way to the nose. A cleft palate is a crack in 
the roof of the mouth. Both can affect the way a child talks, eats and 
breathes. 
</P>
<P>
Cleft lips and palates are the third-most common birth defect, behind clubfeet 
and heart defects. 
</P>
<P>
More often than not, cleft babies face a rough road. Several surgeries usually 
are needed to repair the defect because of the complex nature of the 
affliction. The children often have related dental and medical problems, 
including ear infections, and are slow to learn to talk. Facial growth is 
abnormal, sometimes making children the butt of cruel jokes, as Lisa Winslow 
knows all too well. Her 3-year-old daughter Cami was also born with a cleft lip 
and palate. "It hurts when they come home and say the other kids tease them," 
said Winslow, who lives in Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
Although scientists have studied cleft lip and palate for years, their search 
for the cause and best treatment is far from over. Progress is best described 
as slow and steady. There's a trend toward performing surgery earlier than in 
the past, which can result in fewer speech problems and higher self-esteem for 
the children. 
</P>
<P>
New fiber-optic technology makes it easier to pinpoint anatomical problems and 
helps the surgeon and speech therapist design treatment plans. There is a 
continued emphasis on a team approach, with many health care specialists 
working on treatment together. Repairing the cleft before birth -- called in 
utero surgery -- is under study, although many specialists are skeptical. And 
scientists persevere in their hunt for the cause, or causes. 
</P>
<P>
About 20% of cleft defects are genetic, said Harold Slavkin, professor of 
craniofacial molecular biology at the USC School of Dentistry. The other 80% 
are caused by medications and drug use by the mothers, mere coincidence and 
other factors, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Surgery to repair cleft lips and palates already has come a long way. 
</P>
<P>
"In general, cleft lips are repaired about 3 months of age," said Dr. John F. 
Reinisch, co-director of the Craniofacial and Cleft Center at Childrens 
Hospital, Los Angeles, and USC chair of plastic and reconstructive surgery. 
"Cleft palate used to be repaired at 18 months and sometimes still is. But now 
there's a tendency at some centers to do it at age 10 months or a year." 
Experts say earlier repair results in fewer speech problems, and studies 
confirm that contention. In a study published earlier this year in the British 
Journal of Plastic Surgery, researchers concluded that delaying surgery may 
lead to persistent abnormal speech patterns, although the gap between the early 
surgery and late surgery groups was narrower than expected. 
</P>
<P>
Physicians also are becoming more aggressive about cleft surgery and try to 
maximize correction with each operation, said Dr. Gerald M. Sloan, director of 
the Craniofacial and Cleft Center at Childrens Hospital and an assistant 
professor of surgery at USC. "We'd like to do all corrections in two or three 
operations," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A new technique called Z-plasty, in which the palate is closed in a zigzag 
pattern rather than a straight line, is becoming widespread. It can't be used 
in all cases, said Dr. Libby Wilson, a plastic surgeon at Rancho Los Amigos 
Medical Center, Downey, and USC associate clinical professor of surgery. "The 
wider the cleft, the more difficult to do Z-plasty," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But when it can be done, it's preferable, she said. "When suturing is done in a 
Z-pattern, it repositions the cleft muscles to a more normally functioning 
position." Palate muscles, located in the roof of the mouth, help regulate the 
air flow that enables people to talk, eat and breathe. 
</P>
<P>
Most controversial of the treatments under study is surgically repairing the 
cleft while the baby is still in the womb. The technique has only been tried on 
animals. One researcher, Dr. Leonard Kaban, professor and chairman of the 
department of oral and maxillofacial surgery at UC San Francisco School of 
Dentistry, induces a full cleft lip in unborn animals. He says he has been 
successful in repairing cleft lip in all of the surviving animals. 
</P>
<P>
However, he says that about 25% of the fetuses did not survive, though all the 
mothers survived. 
</P>
<P>
Another researcher, Dr. Walter A. Sullivan of Detroit, studied repairs in the 
womb and found that fetal tissue can heal without scarring. Eliminating scar 
tissue isn't just a cosmetic concern, Sullivan said, because scars can extend 
deep beneath the skin and interfere with nerves, bone and blood vessels. The 
results of his in utero repair were published in November in the Plastic 
Reconstructive Surgery journal. 
</P>
<P>
But some cleft palate specialists don't share the fever for in utero repair. 
"There's no reason to think it will be beneficial in humans," said Sloan of 
Childrens Hospital. "It's incredibly risky to do in humans, and it's all very 
preliminary." 
</P>
<P>
"At this stage, I agree," said Kaban, who emphasized that in utero repair for 
humans is probably a decade or more away. The point of his work, he said, is 
not convenience but study of a larger question. "Our hypothesis is, if we 
repair cleft lip in utero, there will be no scar formation and no 
inflammation." Kaban is trying to determine if the scars and inflammation cause 
abnormal facial growth. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of in utero repair say efforts would be better spent on continued 
improvement of surgical techniques after birth. 
</P>
<P>
Even after successful lip and palate surgery, many children have ear problems. 
When palate muscles don't work correctly, they can't keep clear the Eustachian 
tubes, the small ducts connecting the throat to the middle ear. Fluid can 
accumulate behind the middle ear, causing ear infections and temporary hearing 
loss. As a solution, some surgeons make an incision in the eardrum, a procedure 
called a myringotomy, and insert a tiny ventilating tube. 
</P>
<P>
Some children also need speech therapy. Designing a treatment plan for speech 
improvement is now easier, thanks to the widespread use of fiber-optic 
nasoendoscopy, a technique that allows lighted viewing of the palate. "It can 
identify whether the palate is functioning adequately to close off the back of 
the nose and ensure normal speech," said Dr. Seth Pransky, a San Diego 
pediatric ear-nose-throat specialist who uses the technique. It can also help 
surgeons decide when to operate and can give children feedback on their speech 
progress. 
</P>
<P>
"A child sits in a chair and topical anesthesia is applied to the nose," said 
Susan Gray, a speech pathologist at Childrens Hospital, where the device is 
also used. "A small lighted tube with a tiny camera is inserted up the nose. 
It's not painful." The child watches an adjacent television screen, which 
displays the top of the palate and back and sides of the throat. "Children can 
talk normally so the speech therapist can watch the functional dynamics." In 
the past, a rigid, uncomfortable endoscopic tube was inserted into the mouth, 
said Gray, making it difficult to talk. Minimizing speech therapy isn't just 
cost-effective, Gray added. "If a child finishes speech therapy more quickly, 
it can boost self-esteem too." 
</P>
<P>
Surgeons and speech therapists aren't the only specialists on the cleft palate 
team. Orthodontists are also vital to correct such problems as incorrectly 
positioned or missing teeth. "The ideal team would also include a pediatrician, 
an ear doctor, a prosthodontist, a nurse, a social worker, an audiologist and a 
dysmorphologist (genetic defect specialist)," said Dr. Leslie Holve, a 
pediatrician and medical director of Cleft Palate Services at St. John's 
Hospital and Health Center in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after a baby is born with a cleft lip or palate, social workers often 
help parents cope with their disbelief and anger. "Some parents have trouble 
even looking at the child," said Reinisch of Childrens Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
There are misconceptions to correct, too, Holve said. "Folklore comes out of 
the woodwork. People think cleft is related to eclipses or to trauma during 
pregnancy. Some think an encounter with a rabbit during pregnancy results in 
the cleft," which once was called "harelip." 
</P>
<P>
While doctors work to dispel myths, scientists like Slavkin try to zero in on 
the cause or causes. "Scientists are moving toward the idea that clefting has 
many different causes, like cancer," Slavkin said. "Research strongly suggests 
that the disorder is not always due to a defect in the same gene." 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, London researchers sparked interest in the scientific community 
by linking a rare form of cleft palate to a faulty gene on a portion of the X 
chromosome, one of two that determine sex. Slavkin calls the research an 
important piece in a very big puzzle. "One can't extrapolate from that research 
that all cleft palate is X-linked," Slavkin said. "Some is autosomal (linked to 
a chromosome other than a sex chromosome); some is drug-induced." 
</P>
<P>
Scientists know, for example, that taking the anti-convulsant medications 
prescribed for the treatment of epilepsy is associated with cleft. In the lab, 
they are trying to discern the signals that direct the palate to grow together, 
and then determine how the medication alters normal growth. 
</P>
<P>
Cleft is also associated with the mother's use of alcohol, chemotherapy and the 
acne medication isotretinoin, also known as Accutane, Slavkin said. 
</P>
<P>
For families like the Winslows, patience is the key. Kyle has had two surgeries 
to repair his cleft lip and palate and five sets of ear tubes inserted. His 
sister has had three surgeries to repair a cleft lip and palate and four sets 
of ear tubes inserted. "The hardest part is yet to come," Lisa Winslow said. 
Upcoming is jaw repair, extensive orthodontic work and additional speech 
therapy. 
</P>
<P>
"There always seems to be another surgery on the horizon," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The American Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Assn. maintains a toll-free hot line, 
(800) 242-5338, to disseminate information and refer parents to support groups.

MEDICAL JOURNAL SAVES THE BIZARRE, ZANY STORIES FOR YEAR'S END 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Men who are uncircumcised should exhibit great care in running or skiing during 
cold weather because of the increased risk of frostbite, according to a new 
report in the British Medical Journal. 
</P>
<P>
In another study, psychiatrist Linda R. Montague of Glanrhyd Hospital in Mid 
Glamorgan submitted a short report on the "cross-species applicability of 
psychiatric diagnosis and treatment." The patient was a female cat -- 
tortoise-shell and white -- whose identity, in the best medical tradition, was 
carefully kept confidential. 
</P>
<P>
The studies are part of the annual year-end issue of the British Medical 
Journal, in which the editors save up their most unusual, bizarre or simply 
humorous short medical reports -- all of them true. The results provide a 
somewhat unusual view of British medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Medical officers Simon Travis and Digby Roberts of the 45 Commando Group of the 
Royal Marines reported on seven young soldiers who suffered "Arctic Willy," 
mildly frostbitten genitalia, while running or skiing in January and February 
at a base 132 miles north of the Arctic Circle in Norway. 
</P>
<P>
All of the men wore relatively tight-fitting pants that allowed wind to blow 
through them. Six of the seven were uncircumcised. 
</P>
<P>
Normal treatment for frostbitten extremities is immersion in a bowl of warm 
water, the physicians said, "but this would clearly be impracticable in these 
circumstances." They recommended a hot shower or sauna as an alternative. None 
received permanent injury, but the physicians advised them that "prevention by 
loose-fitting windproof trousers is the key." 
</P>
<P>
In Montague's research, the cat was discovered in conditions of squalor after 
the death of its 89-year-old owner. A veterinarian successfully cured an ear 
infection, but noted that the cat was withdrawn and self-neglecting, did not 
groom itself, and spent most of its time hiding in a utility room, presumably 
as a result of neglect before the owner's death and the trauma of the death. 
</P>
<P>
"The doctor thought that senile dementia was the likely diagnosis and that 
euthanasia was the only humane option," Montague wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Montague took the cat into her care and initiated a program of intensive 
stroking and holding, brushing to encourage washing behavior, "occupational 
therapy with a catnip mouse and a length of string, and a regular toileting 
program." 
</P>
<P>
The cat recovered fully, assumed a dominant position among other cats in the 
household, and even "showed herself capable of learning new skills by mastering 
the use of the cat-flap," Montague said. The results of the treatment prove, 
she concluded, that "principles of rehabilitative therapy are applicable beyond 
the human species." 
</P>
<P>
Neuroradiologist P. Macpherson of Southern General Hospital in Glasgow examined 
a woman who complained of sciatica, a piercing pain in the region of the hip 
and thigh. A medical history showed that she had been treated 18 months before 
when she fell on and broke a glass-topped coffee table. 
</P>
<P>
X-rays showed that the woman had a piece of glass lodged near the bottom of her 
spine. Macpherson's conclusion: The woman had a "pane in the back." 
</P>
<P>
Printed warnings that people with coronary problems should not ride roller 
coasters in amusement parks should be taken to heart, according to a group from 
the Royal Infirmary in Glasgow. The group attached portable electrocardiographs 
to seven women and six men before they went on a twisting roller-coaster ride. 
</P>
<P>
The subjects' heart rates increased from an average of 70 beats per minute 
before boarding the ride to an average of 154 beats per minute during it, and 
didn't return to normal until an average of 10 minutes after the ride was over. 
Heart rates of five reached more than 90% of their theoretical maximum. 
</P>
<P>
Other reports dealt with a rare incident in which two brothers independently 
suffered injuries during warm-ups for the same cricket match and a case of 
Salmonella infection caused by immoderate consumption of eggnog, in which the 
eggs are not cooked. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, T.P. Eddy, a former colonial medical service officer, was moved to 
write by earlier reports dealing with numbness in the limbs of leprosy 
patients. He recalled his own experience in a West African leprosy colony. 
</P>
<P>
After examining the patients, he asked if there was anything he could get them. 
One young man, a spokesman for the group, asked for "a boosy cat." 
</P>
<P>
"'Have you got mice?,' I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"'No, sir, rats,' he replied. 
</P>
<P>
"'Are they eating your food?' 
</P>
<P>
"'No, sir, us.' 
</P>
<P>
"Then they showed me the linear, parallel tooth marks of rats on the atrophied 
stumps of their arms and legs." 
</P>
<P>
They got their cat.

A small number of rats drinking fluoridated water developed both cancer of the 
mouth and bone irregularities unrelated to cancer, the National Toxicology 
Program announced last week. The findings, part of a federal study, came in 
addition to a report that some of the rats given fluoridated water had 
developed malignant bone tumors. 
</P>
<P>
As with the bone tumors, however, the numbers of affected test animals were 
small and the results have not yet been interpreted by outside scientific 
experts. The rodents were given water with varying levels of fluoride many 
times higher than what most humans consume. 
</P>
<P>
Five rats of both sexes consuming various doses of fluoride in water developed 
malignant tumors on the inside of their mouths, out of a total of 360 rats 
exposed to fluoride. Four of the cancer cases occurred in rats on the highest 
doses of fluoride. The finding was clouded, however, by the fact that one rat 
in a "control" group of 160 animals -- which had no fluoride in its water -- 
also developed cancer of the mouth.

VALUE OF CHOLESTEROL TESTS CITED

<TEXT>
<P>
Public cholesterol screening tests apparently encourage many people to seek 
advice from their doctors and change their diets to cut their risk for heart 
disease, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
A recent study found that about 40% of people who had high cholesterol levels 
on public screening tests went to a doctor to follow up on the results and more 
than 75% reported changing their diets. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Antonio Gotto of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston said his team's 
study of more than 13,000 people may help rebut recent criticism about the 
value and safety of wide-scale cholesterol screening. 
</P>
<P>
In a study published recently in the American Journal of Cardiology, Gotto and 
his colleagues looked at the effectiveness of cholesterol screening at a 
variety of sites -- shopping malls, workplaces, health care centers, a 
supermarket, a blood bank and a school.

The Sandinista government has agreed to immediately transfer $1.5 million in 
U.S. funds tied up in Nicaragua's Central Bank to an institute that will train 
opposition poll watchers for the Feb. 25 elections. Former President Jimmy 
Carter, who mediated the talks in Managua, said that President Daniel Ortega 
also promised to protect against intimidation of poll watchers and to let a 
dozen U.S. lawmakers observe the elections.

Western hostages in Lebanon are alive and well, sources in the pro-Iranian

McCarthy and American Thomas Sutherland are being held in the basement of a 
house in the suburbs of Muslim West Beirut. Other hostages, including eight 
Americans, are also alive, the sources were quoted as saying.

Philippine troops in a dawn raid today captured a rebel general regarded as one 
of the main organizers of last month's failed coup against President Corazon 
Aquino, the military said. Brig. Gen. Edgardo Abenina, who had a $44,500 price 
on his head, is the most senior officer arrested since the rebellion was 
crushed. Military officials said he suffered bruises trying to escape troops 
who surrounded his Manila hide-out.

A nearly decade-long labor struggle came to an end as 58 packing shed workers, 
46 of them women, collected compensation checks from a $1.4-million settlement 
with Sun World Inc. The packing firm was found guilty of unfair labor practices 
in failing to rehire the members of the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Workers Local 
78-B after a brief strike in 1981. U.S. Supreme Court justices ruled last year 
to let the back-pay award stand. Some workers received checks for more than 
$50,000.

The skull of a Marine who was inadvertently left in the desert after night 
maneuvers in 1988 was found about 3 miles from where his other remains were 
recovered more than a year ago, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Geology students came across the skull Jan. 6 during a dig near National Trails 
Highway outside the grounds of the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center in 
Twentynine Palms, about 180 miles east of Los Angeles, a Marine Corps spokesman 
said. Dental records confirmed the skull was that of Lance Cpl. Jason Rother, 
19, of Minneapolis, who was posted as a road guide during maneuvers on the 
sprawling base Aug. 30 1988, the Marine Corps said.

California State University trustees allegedly violated a state law by voting 
to give top administrators pay raises at a closed-door session, a press 
advocacy group charged here. 
</P>
<P>
The California First Amendment Coalition has asked the university system to 
invalidate pay raises that it voted Nov. 1 for Chancellor W. Ann Reynolds and 
campus presidents. A university spokesman denied that the action was taken in 
closed session and said the trustees acted properly. Reynolds' salary was 
increased by 43% to $195,000 a year, while campus presidents were boosted from 
$112,000 to $130,000.

TURTLE SLAUGHTER IN MEXICO PROTESTED

<TEXT>
<P>
An environmental organization condemned the slaughter off the Mexican coast of 
thousands of endangered giant sea turtles for their skin, which is made into 
high-fashion shoes and purses. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Steiner, a research biologist and director of the Earth Island Institute, 
recently returned from San Augustimillo in Oaxaca where he and other 
environmentalists reported seeing heads and flippers from olive ridley turtles 
floating in the surf near a slaughterhouse. He said fishermen were reluctant to 
discuss their capture and slaughter of 800 turtles, 99% of them females coming 
to shore to lay eggs. Although Mexico allows the annual slaughter of 20,000 of 
the turtles, Steiner said there were indications that illegal killings bring 
the toll to 75,000.

These were a few of his favorite things: 
</P>
<P>
His kids' picture in his locker. Dwight Clark's jersey in the one next to his. 
The Denver Broncos in his crosshairs. Bill Walsh's playbook at his fingertips. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh, himself, a lot farther away than that? 
</P>
<P>
Scouting report for future 49er foes: Whatever you do, don't ever let Joe 
Montana get as comfortable as he did Sunday when he capped his -- anyone's? -- 
most memorable season with another grand game. 
</P>
<P>
He went 22 for 29 for 297 yards and threw five touchdown passes, a Super Bowl 
record. He has a career total of 11 touchdown passes in Super Bowls, another 
Super Bowl record. He was named the game's most valuable player for the third 
time. You guessed it, another Super Bowl record. 
</P>
<P>
At age 33, his regular-season passing rating, 112.4, was an NFL record. In 
three postseason games, he completed 78.3% of his passes for 11 touchdowns and 
no interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
In three postseason first halves, en route to what would become three routs, he 
completed 79.4% for nine touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Like, what was left in the way of compliments? 
</P>
<P>
"He's probably the greatest quarterback ever to play this game," Coach George 
Seifert said. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, he's not looking up at anyone, that's for sure," said Steve Young, 
caught in the anguish/admiration of backing up a legend. 
</P>
<P>
But comfort can be hard to come by, so let's start with the picture. 
</P>
<P>
It has Joe's two young daughters and his infant son, posed with Joe's three 
Super Bowl rings. Underneath is engraved, "OK, Daddy, The Next Ring Is For 
You." 
</P>
<P>
Montana's wife, Jennifer, had it made up. 
</P>
<P>
"I have only one thing to say to her," said Joe, laughing Sunday night. "She 
can have that one. I'll take the next one." 
</P>
<P>
About the jersey . . . 
</P>
<P>
Dwight Clark, now retired, was Montana's closest friend on the 49ers, then or 
since. Clark made The Catch of Montana's pass to win the NFC title game against 
Dallas in 1982. The 49er equipment man recently took to hanging Clark's old 
jersey where Montana could see it. The first thing Montana did after this game 
was put on a sweat shirt from Clark's restaurant to plug it through the 
postgame interviews. 
</P>
<P>
"Just a ghost from the past," said Montana, grinning. "A good one." 
</P>
<P>
About Walsh, Young, and this roll that Joe's on . . . 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't always this way. Can anyone remember how badly the 1988 season was 
going for Montana, right up until the last month? 
</P>
<P>
The '86 season had ended with then-Giant Jim Burt blasting him into Never-Never 
Land. The '87 season ended with an upset loss to the Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
In the off-season, there were reports that Walsh and owner Eddie DeBartolo 
wanted to trade Montana to the Chargers for Billy Ray Smith; that the Chargers 
turned it down. 
</P>
<P>
The '88 season began with Walsh declaring a competition for the No. 1 spot 
between Montana and Young. 
</P>
<P>
In Game 11 of the '88 season, the Raiders beat the 49ers in Candlestick Park, 
9-3. Montana looked awful. The 49ers were 6-5 and looked out of it. 
</P>
<P>
What, him worry? 
</P>
<P>
Joe says he never got down. 
</P>
<P>
"I worry emotionally because I'm his wife," Jennifer said. "It hurts to know 
when he's capable of doing so much and yet not having the opportunity because 
he was being shuffled back and forth. I thought that was unjust. But it's like 
Joe said, 'That's not anybody's fault but Bill's.' And you have to have respect 
for your coach. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether he agrees with Bill's decisions or not, he's always had the utmost 
respect for him. And that's what he'll say over and over. You never heard it. I 
didn't hear it around the house. He never bad-mouths Bill." 
</P>
<P>
And yet, mustn't there have been some resentment? 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't resentment," Jennifer said. "It was just, he didn't understand any 
of it because he felt he'd had a great season the year before (1987), which he 
did. He didn't feel there was any justification for putting Steve in, and 
moving Joe back and forth. But I don't think there were any hard feelings." 
</P>
<P>
In a great irony, between Walsh and Montana, the mentor who designed the scheme 
and the wizard who ran it, there was always a certain tension. 
</P>
<P>
If Montana really wasn't smoldering, well maybe that was just Joe. 
</P>
<P>
He's modest to a fault. Jennifer says he almost blushes when she compliments 
him. He's amiable, easygoing, laid-back off the field almost to the point of 
being comatose. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a nice down-to-earth guy," says a teammate, "but he has the personality 
of a piece of bread." 
</P>
<P>
In the last month of the '88 season, Montana pulled himself together. He led 
the 49ers to their late-drive, come-from-behind Super Bowl victory over 
Cincinnati. He rolled right through the '89 season. He rolled through Super 
Bowl week, when his ex-wife Cass sold the story of their breakup to the 
National Enquirer, and he got dragged in on a drug story, although no evidence 
involving him had ever surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
He kept right on rolling Sunday night. By his reckoning, the Broncos only 
knocked him off his feet once or twice. He had them down for the count by 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
"That's something I'm working on," Young said. "You can get overly emotional. 
You throw a bad pass, you don't see someone you should see, you make a mistake 
in the heat of the moment. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's one of the best at it -- he'll just immediately pace the 
sideline, thinking about the next series. I mean, we're up 50-something to 10 
and he's pacing the sideline, thinking about the next series. 
</P>
<P>
"The tough times take a lot out of everybody. The good times take a lot out of 
everybody. I don't think he lets it outwardly show. People get used to him 
being the steady force on this team. Because of that, we'll get in games where 
we'll be down by a few touchdowns, or like this last controversy. You always 
look at Joe so if he's down or something -- oh my gosh! Something's really 
wrong! But that's never happened. 
</P>
<P>
"You notice in our postgame party, there's no champagne. We said the Lord's 
Prayer. I mean how many Lord's Prayers have you had in championship locker 
rooms? I mean, this is a business-as-usual kind of thing. Half the guys in the 
locker room are probably walking around saying, 'Let's go do it again,' because 
we're just that efficient. I think we kind of show ourselves for the people we 
follow." 
</P>
<P>
So what's it like for Young? 
</P>
<P>
"It's lousy sometimes, because you equally want your shot with this offense. 
And then at other times, it's inspiring. I think it's a paradox. I'll just 
leave it at that. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's any hope for me to play here, I want to be here. Maybe Joe can play 
'til he's 40, but I know I can play 'til I'm 40, too." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday night was one of the inspiring ones. 
</P>
<P>
Montana was asked what he plans to do next. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to take a nice nap," he said. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
All his right arm was good for Sunday was to cover his mouth when coughing. 
John Elway, least valuable player of Super Bowl XXIV, slipped the offending 
limb into the sleeve of a leather bomber-pilot's jacket, took his wife by the 
hand, then did the very thing he had so much difficulty doing during the 
(cough) football game that mercifully ended more than an hour before. He 
marched the length of the field. 
</P>
<P>
From the losers' locker room on the Poydras Street side of the Louisiana 
Superdome, the Elways re-entered the center ring of the cavernous arena and 
crossed the entire playing field, making for the Girod Street exit, 
side-stepping technicians and dangling cable. Stadium stragglers, never ones to 
pass up a chance to ask an athlete for an autograph, rushed forward for the 
signature of a flu-wracked, guilt-ridden, bronchial Bronco, whose team had just 
been horsewhipped, 55-10. 
</P>
<P>
"Sorry, John," one said. 
</P>
<P>
Elway sighed, smiled, signed. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, John! John!" a young girl called down from the mezzanine. 
</P>
<P>
Elway looked up, squinted into a bright light, waved to her. 
</P>
<P>
And away he went into the tunnel, into the darkness, into the future, homeward 
bound to his addresses in Aurora, Colo., and Palm Springs, hardly headed for 
Disneyland. Off he went to his dwellings, to dwell on all that went haywire. 
Home to wonder why he was tricked again rather than treated, to wonder whether 
the city and population of Denver would ever again allow him to feel a mile 
high. 
</P>
<P>
"All I can do is the best I can," said Elway, who looked the worst of any of 
the five quarterbacks who played football Sunday -- two San Francisco 49ers, 
two Denver Broncos and Budway Joe, the animated beer bottle. "I'm just trying 
to figure out how we can win one of these things." 
</P>
<P>
Call him with suggestions. There is no toll-free number, not yet, but when 
there is, you can bet it won't have Roman numerals in it. In three Super Bowls, 
Elway-quarterbacked teams have scored 40 points. The other guys have scored 
136. And at the bottom of this mine lies a big, big man, Big John. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't make the mistakes we did," Elway said of the victorious 49ers. 
Hey, who did? Elway's game had more holes than Pete Fountain's clarinet. He was 
10 for 26, got sacked four times, had two passes intercepted, fumbled twice. 
The touchdown he scored was strictly peanuts. In fact, John Elway was strictly 
peanuts; he was Charlie Brown, faked out by Lucy again. 
</P>
<P>
Did he accept his fate gracefully? Yes, he did. Hacking incessantly but 
insisting he felt fine, Elway talked about how awesome the 49ers looked, about 
what a "well-oiled machine" they are, about how the Broncos lost to a better 
football team and had to be satisfied that at least they hadn't lost due to a 
lack of effort. 
</P>
<P>
"It's disappointing," Elway said, smiling a smile that was all teeth and no 
mirth. "Why do we always come in here and play so poorly? 
</P>
<P>
"I feel sorry not only for myself and for the organization, but for the fans in 
Denver and throughout the United States who have been behind us, who have 
expected more from us. We've got to keep plugging away, try to get them one. 
I'd still rather lose the Super Bowl than not be in the Super Bowl at all, but 
when are we going to win one of these things?" 
</P>
<P>
More to the point: Is John Elway the reason Denver's here or the reason Denver 
loses? 
</P>
<P>
Cough. 
</P>
<P>
For the 49ers in New Orleans, it was big and it was easy. The only way they 
could have won by more is if Jack Pardee had been their coach, in which case 
the score would have been 95-10 before he pulled his starters. Elway's only 
touchdown wouldn't have counted if an official hadn't overruled an end zone 
interception by San Francisco's Bill Romanowski, charging him instead with pass 
interference. Elway has a total of two touchdown passes in three Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
He tried not to visibly react, bad play after bad play. After an interception 
by Chet Brooks, with the damage already 34-3, Denver defensive back Steve 
Atwater trudged back onto the field and did what any decent teammate does; he 
patted his quarterback on the rump. Sympathy was running high by then. The 
Broncos knew or suspected what Elway was feeling. 
</P>
<P>
By the end, even the 49ers themselves were commiserating. Niner linebacker Matt 
Millen helped the quarterback up, put a comforting hand on his shoulder and 
said: "Hang in there." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying," Elway said. 
</P>
<P>
"You're going to take a lot of heat, but it isn't justified," Millen said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the heat was coming from the stands. Certain fans had seen enough. From 
a section full of orange shirts, a section presumably occupied by Denver 
faithful, a chant arose during the second half, a chant that took in vain the 
name of a former punk musician, intended for the ears of Elway. 
</P>
<P>
"Johnny Rotten! Johnny Rotten!" it went, cruelly. 
</P>
<P>
"You know," San Francisco's overstuffed teddy bear Bubba Paris said, "it got to 
a point in the game where, being a Christian and being a person that loves 
people, I actually felt sorry for Denver." 
</P>
<P>
The tricky part for John Elway was not feeling sorry for himself. Here was a 
football player who has played in three Super Bowls, who knows somewhere in his 
insides that 'tis better to have played and lost than never to have played at 
all. Yet, all anyone could say to him -- all he could say to himself -- was how 
horrible it was that he, like Fran Tarkenton of the Minnesota Vikings, has 
quarterbacked three Super Bowl losers. 
</P>
<P>
"At least Fran was in a couple of those Super Bowls," Elway said. "I've never 
even been in one. We've been manhandled every time." 
</P>
<P>
He coughed and said maybe next time, things would be different. The cough was 
understandable. Sometimes, words get stuck in a guy's throat.

BOURBON STREET THEORY GAINS MORE CREDIBILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
You didn't need to analyze the statistics to forecast the Super Bowl winner. 
All you had to do was hang out on Bourbon Street last week and count the 
players from each team you saw at night. You would have seen more San Francisco 
49ers than Denver Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Donaldson of the Providence Journal writes: 
</P>
<P>
"I have seen two Super Bowls here in the Big Easy. Both times, I have seen the 
winning players on Bourbon Street. Never have I seen the losing players outside 
their hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"The Raiders rampaged through the French Quarter in 1981 like Jean Lafitte's 
pirates on shore leave. The Eagles remained in their motel near the airport in 
the suburbs, watching game films. 
</P>
<P>
"Oakland 27, Philadelphia 10. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1986, while Tony Eason was ordering blackened tofu from room service, Jim 
McMahon was parading through the French Quarter followed by an entourage 
wearing McMahon masks and headbands with highly descriptive -- but distinctly 
unprintable -- messages. 
</P>
<P>
"Chicago 46, New England 10. 
</P>
<P>
"Call it the Bourbon Street Theory. Which is that if the Super Bowl is in New 
Orleans, you're better off having your game plan drawn up by Spuds MacKenzie 
than some coach closeted in a dark room with a video machine. 
</P>
<P>
"Party hearty and win big, that's the way it works here in the City That Care 
Forgot." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: The Broncos suffered their other three Super Bowl losses at the 
hands of the Dallas Cowboys, New York Giants and Washington Redskins. The 
Minnesota Vikings also lost Super Bowls to four different teams. Name them. 
</P>
<P>
Apples of his eye: Eddie DeBartolo Jr., owner of the 49ers, on comparisons of 
his club to the Pittsburgh Steeler dynasty of the 1970s: "The Steelers were so 
awesome. You can't even make a comparison. It's impossible to do. The style of 
football, even though it was just 10 years ago, was so much different. It's 
like comparing apples and oranges. You can use computers, you can use anything 
you want, but unless you line the teams up, it would be awful difficult." 
</P>
<P>
Add comparisons: Denver linebacker Karl Mecklenburg on the Broncos' Super Bowl 
futility and that of the Vikings: "I grew up in Minneapolis. I followed the 
Vikings. They were a great team. Being compared to the Vikings is no slap in 
the face to me. It's much better than being compared to the Lions or somebody 
like that who never got there." 
</P>
<P>
A wave of the checkbook: Paul Brown, general manager of the Cincinnati Bengals, 
on the 49ers: "I'm so impressed by their bringing in players like (Jim) Burt 
and (Matt) Millen and (Mike) Sherrard. I guess you could say (such additions) 
is trying to buy a title. It's one way of doing it." 
</P>
<P>
The glasnost watch: Vladimir Aleshin, the director of Moscow's Lenin Sports 
Complex, was among a group of Soviet sports officials who received invitations 
to the Super Bowl from an American sports marketing company. A downcast Aleshin 
said Saturday: "Although I had the tickets and was able to leave on the 25th, 
we didn't get the visa. Now we are here and the Super Bowl will be held without 
us." 
</P>
<P>
Set for life: Dan Reeves, the late owner of the Rams, once tried to hire Vince 
Lombardi away from the Green Bay Packers. 
</P>
<P>
Reeves offered Lombardi a contract calling for $100,000 a year for 10 years. 
Lombardi told Reeves that security was what he really wanted. 
</P>
<P>
"Wonderful," Reeves said. "In that case, we can make it $10,000 a year for 100 
years." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: The Kansas City Chiefs, Miami Dolphins, Pittsburgh Steelers and 
Oakland Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Sal Campagna, restaurateur and volunteer food-service coordinator 
for the 49ers, on which wine he recommends to go with New Orleans jambalaya: "A 
spicy wine, maybe a gewurztraminer. If I couldn't find that, I'd probably 
recommend a beer." GARR KLUENDER

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The only difference between a San Francisco 49er postseason game and a Mike 
Tyson heavyweight title fight is 3 1/2 hours. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, Terry Bradshaw overrated John Elway. . . . 
</P>
<P>
You have to wonder how the Rams were able to beat the 49ers and lose to them by 
only three points during the regular season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Both coaches stayed with their starting quarterbacks too long. There was no 
reason for George Seifert to send in Joe Montana again after the fumble that 
put the ball on the Denver one-yard line with San Francisco clinging to a 48-10 
lead in the fourth quarter. And Dan Reeves should have put Elway out of his 
misery. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Now maybe the San Francisco defense, which has allowed only three touchdowns in 
its six postseason games the last two years, will get its just due. The fourth 
touchdown was given up by the special teams on a kickoff return. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Like the Lakers and Magic Johnson, the 49ers will be a power as long as 
33-year-old Joe Montana performs at peak efficiency. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Roger Craig avoids tackles the way his brother-in-law, Michael Nunn, avoids 
punches. . . . 
</P>
<P>
No wonder they call it the Stupor Bowl. Fourteen of the 24 have been decided by 
at least 16 points. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Look-alikes: Matt Millen and Jack (Hacksaw) Reynolds. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Denver has been outscored, 54-0, in the second quarter in its four Super Bowl 
appearances. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders goofed when they drafted tackle John Clay on the first round three 
years ago instead of Harris Barton, who is a mainstay of the 49er offensive 
line. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Montana made more money for his diet soft-drink commercials Sunday than for the 
game. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Give the CBS announcing duo of Pat Summerall and John Madden credit for not 
trying to make the game into something it wasn't. As early as the opening 
minute of the second quarter, Madden said the Broncos were getting frustrated. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
The camera work was good too. No gimmicks. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Wonder what Minnesota Viking Coach Jerry Burns thought about Dick Butkus' 
glowing tribute to him during the pregame show. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Mike Ditka's predictions were as lousy as his coaching this season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Many of the players looked tense during the introductions, but coaches Seifert 
and Reeves were all smiles. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I never did like the shovel pass. . . . 
</P>
<P>
This was one game in which time of possession was meaningful. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Put Bobby Humphrey on the 49ers and he would have had a great day. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos could finish anywhere from first to fourth next season in the 
improving AFC West. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Thumbs up to referee Dick Jorgensen and his staff for working a competent, 
controversy-free game. And not a single instant replay review. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Is Jerry Rice still open? . . . 
</P>
<P>
The only suspense was packed into Bud Bowl II. . . . 
</P>
<P>
If you're going to elect Jack Lambert and Franco Harris to the Pro Football 
Hall of Fame, you have to put Lynn Swann in there at the same time. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers and those old Steeler teams would match up a lot better than Vince 
Lombardi's Green Bay Packers, who, by today's standards, lacked speed and 
quickness. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The NFL should play 18 regular-season games and only two exhibitions instead of 
spreading the 16-game season across 18 weeks, as it's talking of doing. Of 
course, it won't happen because the players would have to be paid more. . . . 
</P>
<P>
What event draws bigger crowds on the average than the Rams in Anaheim Stadium? 
Motocross, which attracted 66,141 Saturday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Now the pro football focus switches to Al Davis, who has to make up his mind 
any day now about where the Raiders are going to play their home games next 
season.

BURT'S SEASON, MAYBE CAREER, WINDS UP ON EMOTIONAL NOTE 
</P>

<P>
When the New York Giants won the 1987 Super Bowl in Pasadena, the Denver 
Broncos were the victims, and Jim Burt was the subject of postgame television 
focus in an emotional hugging celebration with his son, Jimmy, age 5. 
</P>
<P>
When the San Francisco 49ers won the 1990 Super Bowl on Sunday in New Orleans, 
the Denver Broncos were the victims, and Jim Burt was the subject of postgame 
television focus in an emotional hugging celebration with his son, Jimmy, age 
8. 
</P>
<P>
And for Burt, the veteran middle guard whose NFL career apparently ended so 
loudly and controversially in training camp this season and was resurrected so 
fittingly Nov. 1 by the 49ers, the aftermath of the 49ers' 55-10 victory over 
the Denver Broncos was an emotional high. 
</P>
<P>
Surrounded by members of the media long after the other players had left the 
interview room, Burt stayed on the verge of tears while he described how much 
it meant to have this last chance. 
</P>
<P>
He had been part of the New York Giants' six-year construction program that 
brought a title in '87; he had been a veteran, a star, a focal point, a 
front-line player. Then, this training season, after being told that he would 
be part of the team and would be able to work through some serious back and leg 
injuries, he was cut by Coach Bill Parcells. 
</P>
<P>
Feeling betrayed, and being the type of player and person who would take 
betrayal to heart, Burt told the media, after joining the 49ers, that he hoped 
he had a chance, when San Francisco played the Giants, to bowl over Parcells on 
the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday night, with his second Super Bowl ring achieved, he apologized for that 
and said: "I was wrong for what I said. Now, all I want is to sit down, in 
private, face to face, with Bill Parcells, and talk some things out. I want to 
go away from this game of football feeling good, and go to Giants games and 
root for them." 
</P>
<P>
Burt, acquired when Michael Carter was injured, played sparingly this season 
for the 49ers, and did everything but say Sunday night that he will retire. 
</P>
<P>
"It's up to my wife," he said. "The last time, when I came back to play (with 
the 49ers), I bolted; left her four weeks away from having a baby. I promised 
her I'd come back for the birth, but then I kept playing here. She let me play, 
get it out of my system. She's the boss. We'll sit down and talk. The 49er 
coaches tell me I have two or three good years left, but I'm sure she doesn't 
want to hear that." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Rice, 49er wide receiver, said he knew early in the game that quarterback 
Joe Montana was going to have a big night. 
</P>
<P>
"When he's really clicking," Rice said, "he gets that little smile on his face. 
You see it in the huddle, like he is in control. It's, well, kind of a sneaky 
smile." 
</P>
<P>
Some quotable lines: 
</P>
<P>
John Madden, TV announcer: "Some people will say, well, at least they didn't 
quit. Of course they didn't quit. They don't let you quit." 
</P>
<P>
Matt Millen, 49er linebacker: "If they'd left our first offense in for four 
quarters, they might have scored 200." 
</P>
<P>
Bubba Paris, 49er offensive tackle: "I would have a good argument for saying 
that this is the best team that's ever been assembled. It would be hard to 
prove us wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Roger Craig, 49er running back: "I'll tell you what. I'm going to play as long 
as Joe Montana plays." 
</P>
<P>
Craig said he had a strange moment just before he scored his team's last 
touchdown, on a one-yard run. The score tied Rice and Pittsburgh's Franco 
Harris with four Super Bowl touchdowns in a career. 
</P>
<P>
"I was over on the sidelines, taking my tape off and not really paying all that 
much attention," Craig said. "Suddenly, they were hollering at me to get in 
there, that there was a record I could set. And the TV was on me. Mostly, I 
didn't care about the record, and the whole thing was kind of embarrassing." 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco quarterback Joe Montana said he will not participate in next 
week's Pro Bowl game because of a nagging elbow injury. His backup, Green Bay's 
Don Majkowksi, has also apparently bowed out because his contract expires Feb. 
1. A spokesman for the league said Philadelphia's Randall Cunningham will 
replace Montana and that New York's Phil Simms is the probable replacement for 
Majkowski. 
</P>
<P>
What about Jim Everett? No explanation was given as to why the Ram quarterback 
won't be participating. Everett could not be reached for comment at home Sunday 
night. When he was originally omitted from the NFC Pro Bowl team, Everett said 
he would be "honored" to go as an alternate. His coach, John Robinson, will 
coach the NFC squad next week in Hawaii. Everett was the NFC's second-rated 
passer behind Montana and led the NFL with 29 touchdown passes. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the writing was on the wall. 
</P>
<P>
Ringing the inside of the Superdome were banners with scores of the previous 23 
Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
On all the banners, the helmet of the winning team was on the left, the helmet 
of the loser on the right. 
</P>
<P>
Bronco owner Pat Bowlen complained before the game that the banner for this 
game, on which the score will be added, had a 49er helmet on the left, a Bronco 
helmet on the right. 
</P>
<P>
"By putting our helmet on the right, they already have us losing," Bowlen said. 
</P>
<P>
As things turned out, maybe someone knew what they were doing. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Humphrey can take a ribbing, but how much could his ribbing take? 
</P>
<P>
Strapped into a flak jacket to protect two broken ribs, Humphrey started at 
tailback for Denver and ran freely enough to lead the Broncos in rushing (12 
carries, 61 yards) and receiving (three catches, 38 yards). 
</P>
<P>
"A couple of times I felt pain when I took some good shots," Humphrey said, 
"but after a while it went away. It wasn't anything that would keep me out of 
the ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
Humphrey also fumbled once, a turnover that Bronco Coach Dan Reeves blamed on 
the flak jacket. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think Bobby was bothered at all in the ballgame," Reeves said. "But I 
do think the fact that he had (the flak jacket) on hurt him as far as the 
fumble was concerned." 
</P>
<P>
Reeves on the 49ers' place in history: 
</P>
<P>
"There's an awful lot of great teams. You don't win the championship even one 
year without being a great team. The fact that they've done it back to back, to 
me, moves them up another notch because it's so hard to repeat. Everybody guns 
for you week in and week out. 
</P>
<P>
"They lost two games all year, one by three points (to Green Bay) and one by 
one point (to the Rams). I'd say it's going to be very difficult for someone to 
say they're not one of the great teams of all time." 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writers Chris Dufresne, Mike Penner and Larry Stewart contributed 
to this story.

49ERS' THIRD-STRING QB BONO HAS NO ILLUSIONS

Steve Young sits behind Joe Montana and wonders. Steve Bono sits behind both 
Montana and Young and comprehends. 
</P>
<P>
Bono is the third-string quarterback on the San Francisco 49ers, a team that 
rarely gets past the first-string quarterback named Montana. 
</P>
<P>
And you thought the U.S. ambassador to Iceland was anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
Bono did play briefly this year, in the win over the Jets, subbing for Young 
who already was subbing for Montana, and Bono completed all four of his pass 
attempts, one for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
But as the 49ers prepare for Sunday's Super Bowl against Denver, and the media 
swarm about his teammates, Bono goes virtually unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't even think I'll be dressed out for the game," said Bono. 
</P>
<P>
There's no bitterness in the comment. Early last year Steve was a man without a 
franchise, having been released by Pittsburgh. And now he's on a team in the 
tournament championship. 
</P>
<P>
"Just getting here is extremely rewarding," said Bono. "I think of Archie 
Manning, who played 13-14 years, whatever, and never was on a winning team. I 
got my start because he was released by Minnesota. He never got to the Super 
Bowl in his career. That puts it all in perspective." 
</P>
<P>
For Steve Bono, 27, perspective is the operative word. Nothing has gone quite 
the way he planned the past 10 years, but he shrugs. 
</P>
<P>
"Expectations weren't met," he says. "But I can't say it's bad luck. You just 
do what you can do, and I felt I always worked hard." 
</P>
<P>
Bono was the best high school quarterback in Pennsylvania the fall of 1979, and 
also a fine basketball and baseball player. The question was not only which 
sport he would choose but which school he would choose. 
</P>
<P>
In his community of Norristown, the Philadelphia suburb that also gave us 
Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda, the betting was the 6-foot-4, 215-pound, darkly 
handsome Bono would select Penn State. Instead he went Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Bono enrolled at UCLA, but instead of becoming a star he became a cipher. There 
were injuries. There was Jay Schroeder. There was Tom Ramsey. there was -- 
egad! -- Rick Neuheisel. 
</P>
<P>
Given a chance to start as a junior in 1983 against Brigham Young -- for which 
Young was the QB -- Steve set a Bruin record by passing for 399 yards. But the 
next week at Stanford he was sacked, suffered a separated shoulder and was gone 
for the year. Neuheisel was back to upset Illinois in the 1984 Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The 1984 season Bono only missed three games -- he had a sprained ankle -- and 
then in the 1985 Fiesta Bowl he outdueled a University of Miami quarterback 
named Bernie Kosar. 
</P>
<P>
The Vikes took him in the sixth round of the 1985 draft, but after two seasons 
of watching Wade Wilson and Tommy Kramer alternate at QB he was released and 
signed by the Steelers. His two years at Pittsburgh produced five passes and 
three completions. 
</P>
<P>
He beat out Kevin Sweeney as No. 3 quarterback at San Francisco. There may be 
disappointment, but there are no illusions. 
</P>
<P>
"I can understand why Steve Young would be frustrated, because he came out of 
college runner-up in the Heisman voting and having thrown for a trillion yards. 
I was drafted in the sixth round and was a backup from the start. 
</P>
<P>
"My role has been defined for me. People have been honest with me. I credit 
(coach) George Seifert and John McVay, the GM, and everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
The past two weeks Bono has portrayed Denver's John Elway in practice against 
the 49er defense. 
</P>
<P>
"When I did get to play this year I made a contribution," said Bono, "and I 
would hope that in running formations against our defense I'm making a 
contribution." 
</P>
<P>
Some of Bono's family lives on the street in Norristown where Lasorda grew up. 
When Steve was at UCLA he would work as a bat boy and shag flies at Dodgers 
games. 
</P>
<P>
But football is his game and his business. 
</P>
<P>
"Joe Montana amazes me," said Bono. "I knew before I came here he was a winner, 
even as far back as high school. But I didn't realize what a great person he 
is. That's what amazes me more than anything." 
</P>
<P>
In his attitude, Steve Bono is also quite amazing. He doesn't think about what 
might have been only what is.

"No Mercy! No mercy! No mercy!" 
</P>
<P>
That's what 49er fans began chanting at a sports bar early in the second half 
of Sunday's 55-10 drubbing of the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXIV. 
</P>
<P>
There wasn't much else for them to say. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers took an early lead and never looked back. Starting quarterback Joe 
Montana did not leave the game until his team put a record 55 points on the 
scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
But die-hard fans wanted more. 
</P>
<P>
After the 49ers second consecutive Super Bowl victory, thousands of fans 
streamed out of the bars and into the streets, hugging strangers and 
optimistically chanting "Three-peat" -- hoping for a third championship next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
People converged on Market Street near downtown by car, foot and subway. 
Traffic on the street was at a standstill for about three hours. 
</P>
<P>
Many were lighting fireworks, shouting and honking car horns. 
</P>
<P>
Most were peaceful. But there was at least one minor fist fight. 
</P>
<P>
By 7 p.m., police were out in force as boisterous fans also began to gather on 
Broadway in North Beach and on Geary Boulevard west of Japantown. 
</P>
<P>
The mood for the past two weeks had been confident. Fans took for granted that 
the 49ers would blow out the Broncos. "I'm almost embarrassed," said Gary 
Beers, manager of Pat O'Shea's, one the city's most popular sports bars. "It's 
almost anticlimactic. It's almost routine. The Niners are in a league by 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
After the biggest blowout in Super Bowl history, some Bay Area fans said they 
wanted more -- although they have had a lot to cheer about in the past 18 
months. Besides the 49ers' back-to-back championships, baseball's Oakland 
Athletics have won two consecutive American League pennants and the 1989 World 
Series, and the San Francisco Giants won the National League pennant only to 
lose the series to their cross-bay rivals. 
</P>
<P>
Are the fans here spoiled? 
</P>
<P>
"Sure we're spoiled. But we're also the best," said Bill Roberts, 25, as he 
took a break from leading cheers at Pat O'Shea's. "We'll be even better when 
the Raiders come home. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the best place to be for sports. The best teams and the best fans." 
</P>
<P>
After Montana threw his second touchdown pass, a seven-yard toss to Brent 
Jones, the bar became a sea of high-fives. 
</P>
<P>
Some people jumped on tables to cheer for the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
"No, we're not spoiled yet," Beers said. "If they have another year of success, 
they're going to be like Lakers fans -- expecting them to win it every year." 
</P>
<P>
Some Bay Area fans think they are fortunate to have so many winning teams. 
</P>
<P>
"They have winners here," said Karen Jaich, an assistant film producer who 
moved to San Francisco six years ago from Simi Valley. "But they appreciate 
them. They've had a lot of heartbreak here, too." 
</P>
<P>
Jaich was typical of the "die-hards" who waited hours to get into their 
favorite sports bars. She stood in Pat O'Shea's with two beers in her hand as 
her husband waited in line to join her. 
</P>
<P>
At most sports bars there were lines stretching around the block before 
opening. Once open, people could only enter when a patron left. 
</P>
<P>
There was still a line in front of Pat O'Shea's when the game ended and fans 
started partying outside on Geary Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
But some left the bar early, bored with the lopsided contest. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't much of a game. It was a disappointment," said Craig Russell, who 
only watched the first quarter. "I'm a fan, I just had other things to do -- 
like my laundry." 
</P>
<P>
Others, such as George Bell, who worked at his gym instead of watching the 
game, could have cared less. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a bad thing they won," he said. "I guess it's good for some 
businesses." 
</P>
<P>
Several immigrants said they didn't understand the game, but enjoyed the 
excitement of having a championship team in their adopted city. 
</P>
<P>
Than Aung, who moved to San Francisco from Burma eight months ago, said, "I 
think I understand it, but not very well. I'm excited. It's a party."

Parties and celebrations quickly turned somber Sunday as Denver fans watched 
their Broncos lose, 55-10, to the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl XXIV. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in orange and blue, fans turned out at local bars and restaurants to 
watch the game. But their enthusiasm for the Broncos and predictions of a Super 
Bowl victory turned to depression and disbelief by halftime, when the Broncos 
trailed, 27-3. 
</P>
<P>
Although there was the usual outbreak of "Broncomania" in Denver after the 
Broncos won the AFC championship and a Super Bowl berth Jan. 14, the level of 
excitement was lower and local support for the team was noticeably less visible 
than for Denver's previous three Super Bowl appearances. 
</P>
<P>
About 300 people gathered at Fat 'n Mike's, a bar owned by the Denver Nuggets' 
Fat Lever and former Bronco and current Raider Mike Harden. 
</P>
<P>
One waiter said before the mood turned dismal that things were a bit on the 
wild side at the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
"It's crazy here. It's a nuthouse. But it's kind of fun, though," said the 
waiter, who identified himself only as L. A. 
</P>
<P>
Even at halftime, die-hard fans remained true to the orange and blue. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just going to let them get complacent," said Pat Brown, who wore 
miniature Bronco helmets for earrings. "We want them to get comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
"They're saving it up for the second half," said Ann Meadows, who came to the 
bar with 20 friends. 
</P>
<P>
Fans at the Boiler Room in downtown Denver started leaving halfway through the 
third quarter, when the Broncos trailed, 41-3. Although a Bronco comeback at 
that point seemed impossible, the crowd cheered as quarterback John Elway ran 
in for Denver's lone touchdown of the game. 
</P>
<P>
The cheers were short-lived, however, as San Francisco retaliated quickly, 
scoring 14 more points. When Gary Kubiak replaced Elway as quarterback in the 
fourth quarter, the crowd cheered again. 
</P>
<P>
Fans had grown sarcastic by the end of the third quarter with San Francisco 
holding a 41-10 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Elway should be sent to another team," said Jim Hallack. "He chokes 
under pressure and he's not as good as he thinks he is."

SWEDEN'S SUNDQVIST IS KING OF THE HILL; 
</P>
<P>
SKIING: HE DEFEATS COUNTRYMAN WALLNER TO WIN U.S. PRO TOUR EVENT AT SNOW SUMMIT 
AND MAINTAINS HIS LEAD IN OVERALL STANDINGS.

Jorgen Sundqvist picked up a winner's check for $5,000 at Snow Summit Sunday 
and doesn't care if the IRS knows about it. He's quite happy to pay taxes in 
the United States, rather than in his native Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
"The rate is much higher at home," he said, "so it is better to pay here." 
</P>
<P>
So far, in his 1 1/2 seasons on the U.S. Pro Tour, Sundqvist, 27, and the IRS 
have shared many moments of happiness. The Swede won the overall championship 
as a rookie, earning $101,874 in prize money, plus at least that much again 
from various contracts. Now, after 13 races this season, he leads the standings 
with 281 points and has deposited another $25,400 (less taxes) in his U.S. bank 
account. 
</P>
<P>
Sundqvist, who defeated fellow countryman Joakim Wallner in the final of 
Sunday's slalom, shared honors for the weekend with Christian Orlansky, who 
beat Sebastian Vitzthum in an all-Austrian giant slalom final Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
For Phil Mahre of Yakima, Wash., it was something of a lost weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The three-time World Cup champion and 1984 Olympic slalom gold medalist, lost 
to Orlansky in the first round Saturday, then was eliminated by Vitzthum in the 
second round Sunday. He picked up only 20 points and fell from fifth to ninth 
place in the standings, 100 points behind Sundqvist. 
</P>
<P>
Mahre first knew he was in trouble, he said, when Orlansky "shot out of the 
starting gate like a rocket" in the first of their two head-to-head runs. "When 
he did it again in the second run," Mahre said, "I figured he had a pretty good 
chance to go all the way and win the race." 
</P>
<P>
Orlansky, 27, did just that, scoring his first pro victory and moving into 
second place behind Italian Marco Tonazzi in the competition for 
rookie-of-the-year honors. Asked how he suddenly became a winner, Orlansky 
said: "It's probably because I have my girlfriend here. That's why I'm skiing 
so fast." 
</P>
<P>
Ingrid Paoli, standing nearby, confirmed that she had been in the United States 
for the last three pro events but would be returning home to Feldkirch, 
Austria, after next weekend's races at Winter Park, Colo. "Then, he must do it 
on his own," she said. 
</P>
<P>
After 10 years on the Austrian team, Orlansky did not race at all last winter. 
"They dropped me," he said. "So, I tried to ski for Belgium, but it didn't work 
out. It has taken me a little longer to get in shape again this season. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, I didn't like the pro style of racing (on dual courses with two 
built-in jumps). But now I am getting used to it, and everything is OK." 
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's slalom, Orlansky reached the quarterfinals, where he lost to the 
ultimate race winner, Sundqvist. 
</P>
<P>
Mahre, meanwhile, was already back in the lodge, his racing day over. He won 
his first run against Vitzthum by 0.043 of a second, but got off to a bad start 
in their second encounter and never caught up, allowing the Austrian to finish 
0.220 ahead for a net victory margin of 0.177. 
</P>
<P>
"My right pole just slipped in the snow as I left the starting gate," Mahre 
said, "and I was slow in gaining momentum." 
</P>
<P>
About halfway down the hill, Vitzthum sprayed up a rooster tail of snow right 
in Mahre's face, seemingly causing him to falter for a moment. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't see the next gate," Mahre said, "and I had to guess where the one 
after that was, but I didn't have any excuses. He just outskied me." 
</P>
<P>
Mahre skied without either his twin brother, Steve, or their younger sibling, 
Paul, both of whom are out with knee injuries. Steve won't race again this 
season, but Paul could be back at least for the Million Dollar Plymouth Super 
Series in March. 
</P>
<P>
Tour director Ed Rogers estimated that with the added money available in those 
three events, plus some potential bonuses in the World Pro Championships at 
Nagano, Japan, on Feb. 8-11, this year's pro champion could earn as much as 
$300,000. 
</P>
<P>
"And sponsorship money would probably double, or even triple, that amount," 
Rogers said. 
</P>
<P>
Sundqvist, the current tour leader, smiled and nodded in agreement when that 
figure was mentioned, but he isn't counting on anything, yet. 
</P>
<P>
"(Bernhard) Knauss is very tough," he said, "and (Tomaz) Cerkovnik has been 
skiing very well." 
</P>
<P>
Knauss, of Austria, is third in the standings with 220 points but has won the 
most money, $27,025. Cerkovnik, of Yugoslavia, is second with 241 points and 
has earned $21,800. 
</P>
<P>
One racer who was not smiling on a bright, sunny day in the San Bernardino 
Mountains was Roland Pfeifer of Austria, who was disqualified in the slalom 
semifinals for two "barges," or false starts. However, through a 
misinterpretation of the rules, an official allowed him to make his first run 
against Wallner, in which he posted a 0.389 margin. Then they told him it 
didn't count. He was out, and wouldn't even be able to ski in the consolation 
final. 
</P>
<P>
On the awards podium, Pfeifer was still complaining, and when the announcer 
said it was too bad and everyone was sorry, the fourth-place finisher in the 
slalom said: "I'm sorry. That's not enough."

SOUTH AFRICAN HAS SEEN ROUGH SEAS; 
</P>
<P>
SAILING: NEAL PETERSEN EXPERIENCED TOUGH TIMES IN HIS HOMELAND, BUT IT HELPED 
PREPARE HIM FOR A NEW CHALLENGE -- COMPETING IN THE TRANS-ATLANTIC RACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH ROBERTS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Neal Petersen was born in South Africa without hip sockets, and his ambition is 
to race a sailboat solo across the Atlantic, which will cost $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
His message: "If you want it badly enough, you can get it." 
</P>
<P>
Petersen, 22, a black, is not easily daunted, not by the racial inequalities of 
his homeland nor the magnitude of his campaign to compete in the Carlsberg 
Singlehanded Trans-Atlantic Race -- the C-STAR -- in 1992, and certainly not by 
the sea. 
</P>
<P>
His nickname is "Neptune," from the day some friends presented him with a 
trident. 
</P>
<P>
"That's how most of my friends have known me after seeing me around the water 
for a long time -- diving, sailing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He came to Southern California in 1985 to pursue his father's profession as a 
commercial diver, and from his savings he is having a 38-foot boat built to his 
specifications in a South African yard for $95,000. For the last few months, he 
has traveled the United States and Britain seeking sponsorship. 
</P>
<P>
Petersen is troubled that international sport has largely bypassed South Africa 
in recent years -- most demonstratively of all, the current, quadrennial 
Whitbread Round the World Race that made its statement by choosing not to stop 
at Cape Town, his hometown, this time but to sail a 7,650-mile leg directly 
from South America to Australia, hardly waving as it passed the Cape of Good 
Hope. 
</P>
<P>
Petersen doesn't quarrel with the reasons. He grew up classified as "coloured" 
on government documents, and yet has received some financial support from white 
South African businessmen. A few years ago, he was even asked to join the Royal 
Cape Yacht Club. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a bit of an embarrassing situation," Petersen said. "Some of the people 
I'd been sailing with proposed my membership for me. The yacht club allowed 
that whether they allowed my membership or not, they weren't going to stop my 
racing. So they shrugged their shoulders and said, 'Why not?' 
</P>
<P>
"I disagree totally with the classification system. We're all people. I'm an 
oppressed South African. This race has not been done by an oppressed South 
African before. There are companies and people in South Africa -- so-called 
'whites' -- who want to see a complete change. A few sensible people realize 
the world is changing and that we have to change with the times. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I'm able to give (them) an opportunity to voice their objections by 
backing my campaign. I've named it 'Freedom Challenge.' I want to see my 
country a free country, but without violence. I totally oppose violence." 
</P>
<P>
Petersen has reserved naming his boat until all the returns are in. 
</P>
<P>
"Whoever comes up with the most money will get that honor," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Petersen rose from better circumstances than some of his countrymen. His 
handicaps were more physical than financial. At 18 months, when he still wasn't 
walking properly, it was learned he had no sockets in his hips. It took three 
major operations over the next 5 1/2 years to correct the problem, and today he 
walks normally, but he lost a bit of his boyhood. 
</P>
<P>
"That did not allow me to run around and kick a ball or to horseplay like the 
other boys," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Much of his therapy was done in a swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
"While other boys learned to kick a ball, I learned to snorkel. I spent vast 
quantities of my time under water, and my respect of the sea started building." 
</P>
<P>
He said his father "taught me that the sea was something you could not take for 
granted and treat it like a play toy, because it can destroy you. It has no 
mercy. The sea does not make any difference between black or white, rich or 
poor, someone with disability or someone perfectly healthy. It has no 
discrimination." 
</P>
<P>
For a time he worked on North Sea oil rigs and experienced what he called, 
"hair-raising marine conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"I realized how weak we human beings are against the sea. The sea is very much 
alive -- in a way, human. I can relate to the sea's many different moods. The 
sea has so much life in it. When I'm out there sailing on my own, the whales 
and dolphins and birds become companions. They're also telltales of conditions. 
When conditions pipe up, the dolphins get excited. The boat starts accelerating 
and they'll come play around your boat." 
</P>
<P>
That's why Petersen said he doesn't worry about the solitude of solo sailing. 
"I feel more alone in cities than at sea." 
</P>
<P>
Petersen has done considerable offshore sailing, including an 8,000-mile 
Atlantic crossing as crew, but his longest solo voyage has been five days -- 
out of Long Beach and around San Clemente Island on a friend's boat. He plans 
two crossings of the Atlantic before the '92 race. 
</P>
<P>
"I've met a few people who would like to do a thing like I'm doing, but they've 
never been able to get it off the ground," he said. "One of the motivations 
behind the race is that I've had to overcome a hip disability, I've had to 
overcome racial discrimination, and I'm young, one of the youngest people in 
the race. 
</P>
<P>
"I want other young people in the world to look and say, 'Hey, he's like us.' 
If he could overcome all the disadvantages and finish the race, why can't we do 
it in our everyday living? I want this to inspire them."

BERGER REPLACES KRICKSTEIN ON DAVIS CUP TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Jay Berger was selected Sunday to replace injured Aaron Krickstein in next 
weekend's first-round Davis Cup match between the United States and Mexico at 
La Costa. 
</P>
<P>
Berger, ranked No. 9 in the world, and No. 4 Brad Gilbert will be the U.S. 
singles players. Gilbert was also a substitute. He replaced Michael Chang, who 
separated a bone in his hip in December. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Davis Cup captain Tom Gorman said he contacted Berger after Krickstein 
pulled a groin muscle in the Australian Open 10 days ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad he was available on such short notice," Gorman said. 
</P>
<P>
Berger's other Davis Cup experience was in 1988, when he won his match in a 3-0 
victory over Peru. THOMAS BONK

NEWSWIRE: USGA, MANUFACTURER SETTLE CLUBS' DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The United States Golf Assn. has agreed in an out-of-court settlement to 
recognize the Ping Eye-2 square-grooved clubs, and the manufacturer has agreed 
to stop making them. 
</P>
<P>
Karsten Manufacturing Corp. had sued the USGA for $100 million after the USGA 
refused to recognize the clubs, which have U-shaped grooves on the clubfaces as 
opposed to traditional V-shaped grooves. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement affects USGA events such as the U.S. Open but not the PGA Tour. 
The company, which has sold about two million sets of the clubs, obtained a 
federal court injunction allowing the clubs to be used in PGA Tour events. The 
PGA Tour has appealed to the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
A similar suit against the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews in 
Scotland, which sets worldwide rules for golf, was dropped by Karsten earlier 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
Karsten Solheim, president and founder of the company, said the USGA agreed to 
pay his company $5 million as part of the settlement. But John Solheim, vice 
president and general manager of the company and the son of the president, said 
"no money changed hands."

Boris Becker, saying he is "totally exhausted" and unable to play, has pulled 
out of West Germany's first-round Davis Cup matches starting Friday against the 
Netherlands and may not play Davis Cup this year, a Hamburg newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
The Hamburger Morgenpost said Becker contacted team coach Niki Pilic after 
returning to his home in Monte Carlo from the Australian Open tournament in 
Melbourne, where he was ousted in the quarterfinals by Mats Wilander. 
</P>
<P>
Becker, 22, was to lead the West German team for its home series against the 
Dutch at Bremen.

ATTORNEYS' DIVORCE VIDEOS HAVE ALL THE SIZZLE OF A TOOTHACHE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAULA SPAN, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
HARTFORD, Conn. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
First, you see the title: DIVORCE. Then, a patriotic shot of a courthouse, flag 
flying. A close-up of an office door plaque serves to introduce your host, MR. 
ROISMAN. Finally, there's the shirt-sleeved Gerald Roisman himself, shaking 
hands with a "client," preparing to fulfill the promise of this $29.95 
videotape's subtitle: "An Attorney Tells What You Should Know." 
</P>
<P>
"Arnold Becker's Video Guide to Divorce" had better production values, frankly. 
Arnie of NBC's "L.A. Law" fame worked with a video coach first, shrugged on one 
of his nattier Armanis, looked right into the lens and oozed advice: "If 
there's someone to blame, blame them. If there's papers to serve, serve them. 
If there's bank accounts to freeze, freeze them. Divorce isn't death; you don't 
have to mourn. What you have to do, is act." 
</P>
<P>
Not Roisman's style. He's less dramatic, less tailored and less blond. And 
since he doesn't have the direct-mail muscle of Dave Meyer behind him, he's 
sold a lot fewer videos (50 to 75, at last count) than Arnie did. 
</P>
<P>
The Roisman advantage, however, is that Arnie, portrayed by actor Corbin 
Bernsen, lives and peddles videos only on television. Whereas this guy from 
Hartford with the receding hairline and the golf ball collection in his office 
is a real divorce lawyer with a real video. 
</P>
<P>
And he's not the only one. 
</P>
<P>
Turns out there's another divorce lawyer in Columbia, S.C., Jan L. Warner by 
name, who's selling his own $29.95 videotape via an 800 phone number. This one 
uses graphics, printed titles that say things like "Channel Your Energy 
Positively" and "Have a Life Management Plan." 
</P>
<P>
Warner keeps his jacket on, takes a more nuts-and-bolts approach than Roisman, 
and drawls. 
</P>
<P>
Both lawyers say their video inspirations long predate Arnie Becker's 
entrepreneurial escapades of last season; supervising producer William 
Finkelstein says no one at "L.A. Law" had heard of any actual divorce videos 
before Arnie's was invented. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, it's hard to know whether life is imitating art in this trendlet, or vice 
versa. All you can say with confidence is that Arnie's got the best writers. 
</P>
<P>
Roisman, who estimates he's handled more than 3,000 divorces over 27 years of 
practice, had his brainstorm after seeing wee-hours television commercials for 
instructional videos such as Jack Nicklaus' on golf. 
</P>
<P>
Like lots of matrimonial specialists, he often spends his first hour or two (at 
$250 per) answering new clients' very basic questions, offering very general 
reassurance and urging them to go home and think about things before they 
decide to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
"People who first come in are very anxious, very upset, very nervous," he says. 
"There is so much misunderstanding." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe, he mused, he could lay out some of the rudiments in his own 
"informational vehicle." 
</P>
<P>
Noodling over various formats, Roisman and his son, Peter, decided to reenact a 
first session with a client. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Roisman, whose firm, Pro-Rep, represents athletes and entertainers, 
recruited an "actress-singer-model" client named Lisa Miller to play the 
about-to-be-ex-wife. She doggedly reads a list of questions that gives Gerald 
Roisman the chance to expound on such subjects as attorneys, fees, documents, 
property and custody. 
</P>
<P>
The 37-minute tape was shot by a couple of video consultants last summer in 
Roisman's conference room, enhanced for the occasion with a small sculpture of 
Justice holding her scales. 
</P>
<P>
Roisman says he's invested about $20,000 to produce the first thousand tapes, 
and needs to unload 650 to break even. Alas, ads in Connecticut newspapers 
brought only a ripple of response, and an attempt to generate reviews seems to 
have fizzled. 
</P>
<P>
But a Hartford Courant business column about the video venture was picked up by 
the Associated Press, which has led to three radio and two TV appearances and 
-- to much excitement in the law offices of Roisman &amp; McClure -- an inquiry 
from the staff of Maury Povich himself. 
</P>
<P>
"My dream is to see (my father) and Corbin Bernsen on a talk show together," 
Peter Roisman fantasizes. "On the Carson show or the Letterman show." 
</P>
<P>
This pairing might not be altogether to the 52-year-old Gerald Roisman's 
advantage, but never mind. He's getting a sufficient kick out of the media 
interest and colleagues teasing him about being a movie star; a potential 
profit of less than $10,000 on a thousand tapes doesn't mean all that much to a 
guy who has a full practice and develops condominiums on the side. 
</P>
<P>
Jan Warner is taking the business aspect a bit more seriously. 
</P>
<P>
He won't say how many copies of "How to Successfully Manage the Crisis of 
Divorce" he's got stacked and ready to mail, but he's hired a New York PR firm 
to flack the thing. What's more, he's planned a whole series of "life 
management videos" on topics like remarriage, prenuptial agreements and 
retirement planning. And he takes Visa and MasterCard. 
</P>
<P>
A consumer advisory: Neither of these products will keep your average viewer 
riveted. 
</P>
<P>
Roisman's tape is funnier, unintentionally, because once his blow-dried client 
starts reading her questions and nodding understandingly nothing can derail 
her, not even the lawyer's appalling anecdote about a visitation gone bad. 
Seems the husband had the two kids for the weekend, and, while the children 
were watching Saturday morning cartoons, he and his new girlfriend commenced 
"sexual relations" on the couch right in the same room. 
</P>
<P>
"Hardly appropriate parenting!" Roisman says, growing uncharacteristically 
animated. "Hardly appropriate dynamics!" 
</P>
<P>
But the actress-singer-model, instead of wailing or doubling over, just nods 
and plows on with the next question. 
</P>
<P>
Warner, whose tape is distributed through his business, SoloSource, dispenses 
with dramatizations and simply talks to the camera. He has a more forceful 
delivery, gets into details about insurance policies and investments, and says 
things like "Don't fight over the stainless steel." 
</P>
<P>
The two videos share a disclaimer: Both lawyers soberly warn that they cannot 
dispense legal advice in this fashion and that people contemplating divorce 
should see attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
This tactic is meant to spare them Arnie Becker's fate: He and his erstwhile 
business partner, Dave Meyer, were sued during this season's "L.A. Law" by a 
woman who claimed she followed Arnie's video advice and wound up with a lousy 
settlement. Arnie had to pay the woman to settle a breach of warranty claim. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not trying to warranty anything," Roisman notes pointedly, "except that 
if the tape doesn't spin around in your machine, we'll replace it."

HOWARD ROSENBERG: HARPER TAKES ON CITY HALL -- FROM THE INSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What a good idea for a series. 
</P>
<P>
Years of TV and newspaper headlines have confirmed our suspicion that, 
generically speaking, something funny is going on inside City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Hence "City," a promising CBS comedy that, in targeting the menace of 
bureaucracy, locates some of the humor lurking within the wider tragedies 
besetting many of America's metropolises. 
</P>
<P>
It premieres at 8:30 tonight on Channels 2 and 8. 
</P>
<P>
What James Coco and a fleeting CBS comedy called "Calucci's Department" wittily 
articulated about institutionalized denseness at a New York state unemployment 
office in 1973, Valerie Harper and "City" now apply to local government, with 
mixed results. 
</P>
<P>
Harper is bright, idealistic city manager Liz Gianni, faced on the home front 
by an independent 19-year-old daughter (LuAnne Ponce), and on the work front by 
destructive city politics and a chaotic, eclectic staff, led by her assistant, 
Roger (Todd Sussman), who lip reads her conversations through the glass of her 
private office. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, co-executive producer Paul Haggis' script has Liz being undermined by 
the mayor's office when she attempts to resolve the embarrassing problem of 
caskets sliding out of a cemetery on a hill into people's homes. It's a clever 
premise with lots of potential for dark humor, some of which is realized. On 
the other hand, the mother-daughter relationship doesn't work at all and is 
expendable. 
</P>
<P>
Roger and some of his colleagues are overdrawn, and Liz is too sweet and 
vulnerable to be totally believed as a city manager, even for laughs. "For a 
person who runs an entire city," her daughter observes, "you're a very gullible 
person." Exactly. 
</P>
<P>
Harper, however, is so likable and skilled at TV comedy, and some of this 
opening episode is such a kick, that optimism prevails. For now at least, city 
lights shine somewhat brightly.

HELMS LETTERS SHED LIGHT ON NEA TANGLE; 
</P>
<P>
ARTS FUNDING: CORRESPONDENCE WITH NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE ARTS CHIEF JOHN 
FROHNMAYER SUGGESTS THAT THE SENATOR TRIED TO INFLUENCE THE AGENCY'S DECISIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN PARACHINI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the height of last year's National Endowment for the Arts political 
imbroglio, Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) demanded details on NEA support to eight 
arts groups and nine artists in a letter underscoring Helms' concern over 
possible sexual content of some of the work. 
</P>
<P>
In a Nov. 7 letter to NEA Chairman John E. Frohnmayer, Helms -- saying only 
that "I am curious" about the funding involved -- demanded detailed information 
on arts endowment grants given to those arts organizations and artists over a 
seven-year period beginning in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
However, a newly released file of correspondence between Helms and NEA Chairman 
John E. Frohnmayer indicates that at the same time Helms was pressing his 
demands for details of NEA grants to arts groups and artists he targeted for 
critical scrutiny, Helms also attempted to intervene in NEA decisions bearing 
on individuals or arts groups he favored. 
</P>
<P>
The letters are among correspondence between Helms and the NEA obtained by The 
Times under the Freedom of Information Act. They include documents that appear 
to confirm speculation -- which first surfaced last year -- that Helms 
identified arts organizations whose controversial work could be singled out as 
Congress considers legislation to extend the life of the arts endowment this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Arts endowment sources characterized the Nov. 7 Helms letter to Frohnmayer as a 
"fishing expedition." Officials of some of the arts groups singled out by Helms 
charged the letter amounted to a hit list, intended to intimidate artists and 
galleries. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Helms nor Frohnmayer returned calls seeking their comments on the 
correspondence in the wake of release of the letters. 
</P>
<P>
The newly surfaced documents shed fresh light on the political tangle that 
enveloped the NEA last year in a months-long censorship controversy that 
created one of the most emotional debates in Congress in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The correspondence details, for the first time, an apparent attempt by 
Frohnmayer to strike a balance between maintaining an accommodation with Helms 
and Frohnmayer's own attempt at damage control. 
</P>
<P>
In one letter, Helms writes that he enjoyed meeting Frohnmayer's "lovely wife," 
Leah, at a Washington reception. In his reply, Frohnmayer scrawls at the bottom 
of the page: "Best wishes for the New Year." 
</P>
<P>
But cautiously in the last week, Frohnmayer has shown the first signs of a 
strategy apparently intended to reestablish the NEA as a champion of artistic 
expression. In remarks prepared for delivery late last week in Boston, 
Frohnmayer unveiled publicly a new defense of federal support for the arts he 
reportedly tested in an address a week before to a meeting of NEA employees. 
</P>
<P>
"As the Berlin Wall crumbles and artists in Eastern Bloc nations are free to 
openly produce alternative politically oriented art for the first time in 
decades," Frohnmayer said, "it is ironic that we in the free and democratic 
United States are debating the issue of censorship and artistic expression. 
</P>
<P>
"All points of view expressed in excellent art should be encouraged and 
supported, and grants should not be proscribed because of partisan or doctrinal 
disapproval." 
</P>
<P>
The Helms-Frohnmayer letters show that Helms, on Nov. 24, attempted to press 
his own nominee for the office of NEA general counsel on Frohnmayer -- to the 
point of urging a job interview for the candidate. Frohnmayer granted the 
interview, but then hired Julie Davis, a former law associate from his hometown 
of Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
In the letter urging the hiring of Edward Damich, a George Mason University law 
professor, as the endowment's chief lawyer, Helms reminded Frohnmayer that the 
senator remained conspicuously silent at the height of a crisis that developed 
in early November. The crisis took form when Frohnmayer canceled a $10,000 
grant to an AIDS art show in New York, saying the show was too "political," but 
then changed his mind and restored the money after a storm of controversy. 
</P>
<P>
The episode prompted widespread criticism of Frohnmayer's handling of the 
situation and resulted in embarrassment to President Bush when famed conductor 
Leonard Bernstein declined to accept the National Medal of Arts -- which Bush 
was to present at a White House ceremony -- as a protest of Frohnmayer's NEA's 
action. The grant involved Artists Space, a Manhattan gallery, and a show 
titled "Witnesses: Against Our Vanishing." 
</P>
<P>
"The media called my office constantly . . . in the obvious hope that I would 
say something that would exacerbate your situation," Helms wrote to Frohnmayer 
on Nov. 24. "I took none of the calls, and instructed my staff to say that you 
had talked with me in good faith and that I would not help them (the media) 
stir the pot." 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 1, Helms wrote the arts endowment again, to "respectfully request" that 
"every possible consideration" be given to an application for a $12,500 grant 
to the Sawtooth Center for Visual Design, a small adult art-education 
organization in Winston-Salem, N.C. Ten days ago, an endowment official 
responded, informing Helms that the National Council on the Arts, the NEA's 
advisory board, would vote on the grant application during a three-day meeting 
scheduled to begin Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
It is in the initial letter from Nov. 7, however, that Helms appears to 
identify specific artists and organizations as targets. NEA sources said the 
endowment receives as many as 150 letters a week from members of Congress and 
their staffs and that many of Helms' letters are no different from routine 
communications from throughout the Congress. But these sources said the letter 
demanding details of specific grants has almost a unique character and 
represents a route of attack with little precedent. 
</P>
<P>
It includes a demand for detailed information on grants to Artists Space and 
seven other organizations. In his letter, Helms characterizes the Artists Space 
AIDS show as something "containing sexually explicit homosexual photographs." 
The remaining groups include: 
</P>
<P>
* Project Artaud, a multi-media San Francisco arts agency that operates its own 
gallery and theater divisions; the Center on Contemporary Art, a Seattle 
multi-media group; Allied Arts of Seattle, and ReSearch Publications, a San 
Francisco organization that receives no NEA support. The four organizations 
were involved in development of a show titled "Modern Primitives" that featured 
tattooing and body decoration of a variety of subcultures. The show included 
some materials focusing on body-piercing -- including piercing of genital 
organs. Allied Arts also sponsored a panel discussion of censorship. 
</P>
<P>
* The List Visual Arts Center at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 
Cambridge, Mass. The List gallery organized a show called "Trouble in Paradise" 
that emphasized political and social commentary in a variety of media by 14 New 
England artists -- including work dealing with censorship, AIDS, homelessness, 
destruction of the American flag, domestic violence and drug abuse. One of the 
show's most provocative works was a piece by artist Jay Critchley called "Old 
Glory Condom Corp." The work included an appeal by Critchley to President Bush 
"to head a public/private partnership" to attack AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
* Art Matters, Inc., a New York-based national foundation that funds artists 
working with difficult subject matter. Two of the organization's top officials 
were key organizers of a program last year called Visual AIDS, a nationwide 
observance in which galleries and museums closed or presented special programs 
to call attention to the AIDS crisis. "Witnesses: Against Our Vanishing" was 
one of the key elements in the Visual AIDS program. Art Matters receives no 
federal funding. 
</P>
<P>
* The Durham-Chapel Hill, N.C., chapter of the American Institute of 
Architects, which sponsored a competition to design imaginative housing for the 
underprivileged. Helms noted that the contest was conducted in cooperation with 
Habitat -- a Christian housing-advocacy group whose supporters include former 
President Jimmy Carter. Kenn Gardner, the organization's chairman, initially 
said he was puzzled about why the housing design contest had attracted Helms' 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
Later, however, Gardner and officials of the Durham Arts Council noted that the 
housing competition's entries were on public display in Durham on the same 
night and in the same building as a lecture by an official of the 
Winston-Salem-based Southeastern Center for Contemporary Art (SECCA). 
</P>
<P>
The lecture -- sponsored by a local chapter of the American Civil Liberties 
Union -- featured homoerotic photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe and a reprint 
of an image of a crucifix immersed in urine. The latter photograph was included 
in a SECCA-sponsored show that became the subject of repeated attacks by Helms. 
Gardner speculated that whoever called Helms' attention to the housing-design 
contest may simply have misconstrued it as a part of the lecture on provocative 
art. Gardner said the architects group received a total of $1,135 from the 
North Carolina Arts Council, a sum the arts council said included no funds 
directly supplied by the NEA. 
</P>
<P>
Nine individual artists were also named by Helms in the Nov. 7 letter to 
Frohnmayer. Nearly all of the artists appeared to have been picked because they 
were involved in the shows and programs in question. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the arts groups reacted to confirmation of the existence of the 
Helms letters with concern. "What Sen. Helms, specifically, is doing by making 
these kinds of requests and putting organizations under this kind of scrutiny 
is making the whole process of funding political, which is scary," said Susan 
Wyatt, director of Artists Space. 
</P>
<P>
"It creates an environment of self-censorship and it sets Sen. Helms up as a 
kind of policeman for the art world. He's not someone who, from what I can 
determine, is really interested in the art itself. What he seems to be doing is 
using and misusing art for political purposes. 
</P>
<P>
"It intimidates people. Artists don't wish to be used as political tools. If we 
believe in freedom of speech and expression in this country, we can't have that 
kind of intimidation happening." 
</P>
<P>
Dana Friis-Hansen, curator of MIT's List gallery, said the university 
underwrote the entire cost of the "Trouble in Paradise" show. "Before this 
whole thing blew up, we would probably have gone to the NEA with a proposal to 
do a show of political art from New England," Friis-Hansen said. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, we would not consider trying to fund it through the NEA. We used to think 
the NEA was a place where more controversial and difficult art would find 
appreciation. But when that process is interfered with, (NEA selection 
panelists) will start being cautious because they fear their decisions could be 
meddled with. It's an effect that sort of trickles down."

SUPER-COLD PHYSICS SEEKS NEW LOWS: 'ABSOLUTE ZERO'; 
</P>

RESEARCH: SCIENTISTS HOPE TO LEARN HOW MATTER ORGANIZES ITSELF WITHOUT THE 
DISTURBING EFFECTS OF HEAT, AND WHY MATERIALS BECOME SUPER-CONDUCTING OR 
SUPERFLUID.

Until recently the coldest spot in the universe has been the empty void of deep 
space. But space is balmy compared to the ultra-frigid temperatures being 
pursued by laboratories in New York and Florida, where dueling refrigerators 
are approaching the ultimate in cold: a state called absolute zero. 
</P>
<P>
For scientists who pursue record cold temperatures, absolute zero is a place of 
beauty and mystery. In this super-cold clime, strange and new phenomena begin 
to unfold: Conductors become super-conducting (losing all resistance to the 
flow of electricity); fluids become superfluid (losing all viscosity); and all 
matter attempts to reach a state of perfect order. 
</P>
<P>
"We have theories. We have laws. But we really don't know what will happen 
until we cool things down," said Robert Richardson of Cornell University. 
"Low-temperature physics is largely the physics of the unknown." 
</P>
<P>
Near the ultimate limits of cold, the research refrigerators that fill entire 
buildings are so sensitive that even stray radio waves, or earthquakes on the 
other side of the world, can create vibrations that jiggle the super-cold 
atoms, which -- like rubbing two sticks together -- will send temperatures in 
the experiment soaring. 
</P>
<P>
Absolute zero is 459.67 degrees below zero Fahrenheit. Scientists measure such 
extremes not in degrees, but in a scale that uses units called Kelvins, or K, 
which are named for William Thomson Kelvin, the 19th-Century British physicist 
who proposed the scale. Absolute zero is 0 K. 
</P>
<P>
Until scientists learned to manipulate cold in their laboratories, the lowest 
known temperature in the universe was 3 K, occurring in the void of space 
between the stars. Early in this century, scientists managed to liquefy helium 
gas by subjecting it to repeated cycles of cooling in special refrigerators. 
Once liquefied, helium stays colder than 4 K and can be stored in the 
laboratory equivalent of a thermos bottle. Several years later, in 1911, 
scientists found that certain materials suddenly become superconductors at 
these low temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
In the last few years, laboratories in Britain, Japan and Finland -- using ever 
more sophisticated refrigerators and better insulators -- have reached 
temperatures of a few millionths of a Kelvin. In special settings, individual 
atomic nuclei have been cooled to a few billionths of a Kelvin. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists at new laboratories funded by the National Science Foundation at 
Cornell University and the University of Florida are now trying to match, and 
perhaps exceed, these record lows. They hope to learn how matter organizes 
itself without the disturbing effects of heat and why materials become 
super-conducting or superfluid. Researchers are trying to cool down silicon, 
helium and thin films of metals such as silver and platinum. 
</P>
<P>
In all materials, in solids as well as gases and liquids, the atoms are 
constantly in motion, vibrating and colliding with each other, creating thermal 
energy. The wilder the motion, the greater the heat. 
</P>
<P>
"Before the laws of quantum mechanics were revealed, absolute zero was thought 
of as the temperature when all motion would come to a stop," when atoms, and 
their subatomic components such as electrons and protons, would stop their 
frenetic vibrations and collisions, "and would collapse as if into a black 
hole," said Dwight Adams, a low-temperature physicist at the University of 
Florida at Gainesville. 
</P>
<P>
This is now known to be untrue. At absolute zero, atoms would still vibrate. 
Electrons would still swirl in a cloud around the nucleus. Indeed, helium would 
even remain in a liquid state at absolute zero, unless it was placed under 
enough pressure to force it into a solid. 
</P>
<P>
But the atomic order at 0 K would be perfect. In a solid, each atom, though 
quietly wiggling, would occupy a precise location in the material. In a liquid 
or gas, even though the atoms may move from spot to spot, they would move in 
unison. They would all be in perfect order, or in what physicists call the same 
quantum state. 
</P>
<P>
To reach this state, all thermal energy must be extracted from the system. 
Atomic motion must be slowed to a crawl. To get to this cold, scientists must 
first employ a special "dilution refrigerator," which is basically an elaborate 
version of an ordinary kitchen fridge, but with a lot more pumps, valves, heat 
exchangers, condensers and tubes, which are filled with liquid helium instead 
of Freon. 
</P>
<P>
Liquid helium, already under 4 K, can cool materials down to a few thousandths 
of a Kelvin. But to go further requires super-conducting magnets. These magnets 
are immersed in the liquid helium and surround a rod of copper. The low 
temperatures and the high magnetic field cause all the nuclei in the copper 
atoms to align like tiny compass needles that all point in the same direction. 
The researchers then reduce the magnetic field, which causes the copper nuclei 
to resume their random orientations. This return to random order absorbs the 
last rays of heat from the environment. 
</P>
<P>
But these temperatures are the most tenuous of states. The enemy is stray heat 
from outside. The researchers at Cornell and Florida have constructed whole 
rooms and buildings to shield their refrigerators from heat, which sneaks in as 
radio waves, or from cosmic background radiation, or from anything that causes 
vibration: trucks on the freeway, distant earthquakes, slamming doors. Each 
creates minute vibrations that jar the super-cold atoms and cause them to bump, 
raising temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
Yet no matter what the scientists do they will never quite achieve absolute 
zero. The closer they get, the larger the relative effect of the slightest 
amount of heat that gets in. "We can get close, very close, but it will always 
be beyond us," said Richardson of Cornell. And that is part of its allure, he 
said.

AUSTRALIAN OPEN: LENDL WINS WHEN SWEDE DEFAULTS BECAUSE OF A TORN STOMACH

<P>
An Australian Open marred by injuries and John McEnroe's stormy exit ended on a 
sour note Sunday as Ivan Lendl repeated as men's champion when Stefan Edberg 
quit with a torn stomach muscle. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time in the Australian Open's 85-year history that a men's 
finalist quit in the middle of a match. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl led, 4-6, 7-6 (7-3), 5-2, when Edberg told the umpire he could not 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg said he hurt himself in the last service game of his semifinal victory 
over fellow Swede Mats Wilander. Edberg, who has had strained abdominal muscles 
several times in the past, felt the pain from the start of Sunday's match. 
</P>
<P>
"It kept getting worse and worse," he said. "I could only serve at 75%. That 
wasn't working too well. I was struggling from the beginning. It didn't feel 
right, and once it gets into your head, it becomes psychological. And if you 
continue, you can only make your muscle worse." 
</P>
<P>
David Bolzonello, the tournament physician, said Edberg's abdominal strain was 
on his left side, "and that's where he pulls through on his service motion. I 
advised him a minimum of two weeks rest. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he made the right decision by not progressing. I think he would have 
made it worse." the doctor said. 
</P>
<P>
The tournament has had problems for two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Women's second seed Gabriela Sabatini and Australia's Mark Woodforde were 
forced from their third-round matches with sprained ankles. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe was thrown out from his fourth-round match for staring at a lineswoman, 
swearing at the umpire and cracking a racket. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg received massage by a trainer and put ice on his stomach during the 
final and rubbed his sore muscles several times during changeovers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the greatest feeling to win in this way," Lendl said. "I hope Stefan 
recovers soon. It's unfortunate, but sometimes things happen this way. He 
carried on for quite a while and showed great courage. I hope we can come back 
12 months from now and slug it out till the end." 
</P>
<P>
Lendl said that despite the tainted result, "a win is a win. Five to 10 years 
from now, not too many people will remember" that he won by an injury. "It 
doesn't feel as great as if I had won it fair and square." 
</P>
<P>
Lendl said he was surprised that Edberg came out to play knowing he was 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
Once Lendl realized that Edberg was hurt, he said he told himself, "Hang in 
there and make him play every point. An injury like that gets worse the longer 
you play." 
</P>
<P>
Edberg, who was forced to retire from the Australian Open with a back injury 
last year after winning in the round of 16, was in obvious pain from the middle 
of the second set on. 
</P>
<P>
The only other finalist to retire in mid-match in Grand Slam history was H. 
Roper Barrett, who quit after four sets against Anthony Wilding at Wimbledon in 
1911. 
</P>
<P>
In the women's doubles final, Czechoslovaks Helena Sukova and Jana Novotna beat 
American teen-ager and singles runner-up Mary Joe Fernandez and partner Patty 
Fendick, 7-6 (7-5) 7-6 (8-6). 
</P>
<P>
The trainer worked on him after the fifth game of the second set, when Edberg 
took advantage of four errors to break Lendl and put the set back on serve at 
3-2. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg held serve and pushed the set to a tiebreaker when he came back from 
15-40 in the 12th game. 
</P>
<P>
But after Edberg took the first two points of the tiebreaker, Lendl won the 
next six, including one on a double-fault by Edberg, and took the set with a 
backhand passing shot that whizzed down the line. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg double-faulted on the last two points to suffer a break in the opening 
game of the third set. He fought back from three break points in the third game 
to hold after five deuces. But the injury was clearly slowing him and draining 
him of energy. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl played well but not as crisply as he did earlier in the tournament and 
might not have beaten a healthier Edberg. Lendl hit an unusually high 17 
backhand errors in the first set, 16 in the second sets and 10 in the 
abbreviated third set. His total of 67 errors compared to 56 by Edberg. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought if I had a chance to win the second set, maybe I could have worked 
my way through winning the third set," Edberg said. 
</P>
<P>
But after dropping the tiebreaker, Edberg said he "knew there was no way I 
could finish the match." 
</P>
<P>
Lendl, who started a fad among the other players and fans when he wore a French 
Foreign Legion-style hat for sun protection in his previous matches here, came 
out hatless this time on a cool, overcast day. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg, one of the quieter players on the tour, had one of more boisterous 
cheering sections as shirtless Swedish men with one letter each of his name 
written on their chests led cheers for him. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the dozens of Swedish fans in the crowed of 15,000 had their country's 
flag painted on their faces and often chanted his name between points. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg, broken the first time he served against Lendl, certainly didn't look as 
though he had any weaknesses in his 6-1, 6-1, 6-2 semifinals victory over 
Wilander. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg laughed when asked about the turning point in that match. 
</P>
<P>
"The first point," he said with a smile, adding that he had "one of those days 
where I almost played perfect tennis."

In an effort to reduce "bureaucratic gridlock," Southern California lawmakers 
announced plans today to form a regional transportation authority for their 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
The new authority would be required to come up with a regional transportation 
plan for the area. It also would have the final say -- and resolve differences 
between cities and counties -- on all transportation issues in the counties of 
Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, Ventura and Imperial. 
</P>
<P>
The plan is expected to draw fierce opposition from the Los Angeles County 
Transportation Commission, which would lose power, and from Orange County, 
which has traditionally opposed having to take orders from a regional 
authority.

INVASION VIOLATED WORLD LAW, JAMAICAN LEADER TELLS QUAYLE

Vice President Dan Quayle's three-day mission to help repair damage to ties 
with Latin America ended on a sour note today with Jamaican Prime Minister 
Michael Manley telling him the U.S. invasion of Panama and arrest of Manuel A. 
Noriega violated international law. 
</P>
<P>
"We exchanged views on Panama and we are friends, but friends do not always 
agree," Manley told reporters after a meeting with Quayle. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle was greeted warmly in Panama on Sunday by many Panamanians who told him 
they were thankful the United States had stepped in to oust Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
But today, Manley, while condemning Noriega as a "menace" to the region, said 
his ouster in the U.S. invasion violated world law. 
</P>
<P>
He said that while opposing Noriega, "we also feel very strongly about the 
principles of sovereignty and the principles that are involved by the invasion 
of one country by another." 
</P>
<P>
"We made it clear . . . that we do not agree with the invasion," Manley said of 
talks he described as "frank and useful" -- diplomatic jargon for blunt. 
</P>
<P>
White House officials have acknowledged privately that ambitious plans for 
Quayle's diplomatic mission had to be abandoned after most of Latin America, 
including U.S. neighbor Mexico, refused to welcome a visit so soon after the 
invasion.

Defense Secretary Dick Cheney today proposed closing or realigning about 60 
military bases in the United States and 12 installations overseas as part of a 
cost-saving effort. 
</P>
<P>
"These proposed actions are part of an ongoing effort to streamline Defense 
Department operations in keeping with changing requirements and future budget 
realities," Cheney told Capitol Hill lawmakers in a letter that accompanied his 
list. 
</P>
<P>
Ten of the bases recommended for closure are in California, including Ft. Ord, 
which played a major role in the recent invasion of Panama, the Long Beach 
Naval Shipyard and Moffett Field Naval Air Station near San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, California accounts for nearly one third of the 35 military 
installations nationwide that Cheney proposed as candidates for closure as part 
of his "transition" budget request for fiscal 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Hardest hit in the state was the Bay Area, which, in addition to the Moffett 
Field Naval Air Station stands to lose Alameda Naval Air Station, Oakland Naval 
Hospital, Oakland Naval Supply Center and the Treasure Island Naval Station. 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California, the list also includes El Centro Naval Air Facility and 
Los Angeles Air Force Station in El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the list is the Sacramento Army Depot. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy also is proposing to mothball the battleship New Jersey, based at Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The recommended shutdowns, which must be approved by Congress, would take place 
between October, 1990, and October, 1994, the Defense Department said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, Cheney acknowledged it will be "tough" to get members of 
Congress, who represent voters in many of the targeted districts, to approve 
the domestic closings. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a real test for Congress. . . . It is absolutely vital that 
Congress have the guts to make the right decisions . . . so that we end up with 
the quality force that is essential to the security of the nation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney said he sent the list of domestic base "candidates" up to Congress along 
with a legislative package that would give him more power to decide to shut 
down military bases in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my expectation to fight very hard for it," he said, denying it was a 
political move on his part to simply portray Congress as an obstructionist in 
making deep defense spending cuts. 
</P>
<P>
In budget proposals to Congress, President Bush and Cheney outlined a smaller 
U.S. military force, paring 38,000 men and women from the 2 million in uniform 
and calling for elimination of several weapons systems. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration called for five costly new B-2 stealth bombers, another 
$1-billion Trident submarine and funds for two controversial intercontinental 
nuclear missile systems. The President also proposed an additional $900 million 
for the Strategic Defense Initiative. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, Cheney said he wants to terminate 20 weapons programs in an attempt to 
save $2.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Among them are the Marine Corps' V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft, the Navy's 
F-14D jet fighter, the Phoenix and Maverick missiles, the Apache helicopter, 
the Army Helicopter Improvement Program and the F-15E fighter.

AVA GARDNER BURIED UNDER NORTH CAROLINA MAGNOLIAS

Ava Gardner, the barefoot beauty who walked out of the North Carolina tobacco 
fields to become a Hollywood love goddess, was buried today in a pink gown 
beneath the stately magnolias of a wind-swept family graveyard. 
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 fans converged on tiny Sunset Memorial Park to mourn the 
passing of the legendary beauty, who left the farm at 19 and never returned. 
She was 67 when she died in London last Thursday of pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
"She's just about the prettiest woman that ever was -- the prettiest face, the 
prettiest eyes, the prettiest hair, the prettiest body," said J. T. Hurley, 72, 
of Cary, N.C., who braved a cold drizzle for two hours before the funeral 
began. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Francis Bradshaw, who delivered a graveside eulogy to 60 family 
members and more than 2,000 fans, paid tribute to Gardner, who was laid to rest 
in a flowing pink gown, not for her beauty but for her gentle soul. 
</P>
<P>
"She was no saint," Bradshaw said. "If we were all saints, then this whole God 
thing would not be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"She was no saint, they said, but they talked about her authenticity, her 
genuineness," the Methodist minister said. "They talked about her love for her 
home, for its realism, for its gentleness, for its roots, for its family." 
</P>
<P>
Gardner's sister, Myra Pearce of Winston-Salem, N.C., wept as Bradshaw spoke, 
then went directly to her car without a word to anyone. Another sister, 
Beatrice Cole of Los Angeles, was too sick to attend the funeral. 
</P>
<P>
None of Gardner's Hollywood cronies attended the service. Her housekeeper, 
Carmen Varga, placed a small bouquet of flowers on her solid cherry casket 
before it was interred. 
</P>
<P>
Fewer than a dozen other bouquets marked the grave, including a wicker basket 
of yellow roses from singer Lena Horne, with a card that read, "I love you." 
</P>
<P>
Singer Frank Sinatra, Gardner's last husband, sent a wreath of pink roses and 
carnations with a card signed simply, "Francis."

'ROBIN HUD' PLEADS GUILTY TO THEFT OF U.S. FUNDS, FEELS 'TERRIFIC'

<P>
A Maryland real estate agent, dubbed "Robin HUD" after admitting that she stole 
millions of dollars in federal housing funds and gave some of it to the poor, 
pleaded guilty today and said she felt "terrific." 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Louise Harrell smiled throughout the hearing in U.S. District Court in 
pleading guilty to charges that she stole at least $4.75 million and lied on 
her tax returns and to federal officials. Her trial was to have begun today. 
</P>
<P>
She claimed she had decided to plead guilty as part of a plea agreement because 
she did not want to spend taxpayers' money in a court proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
She pleaded guilty to stealing government property and failing to report income 
for taxes. As part of the plea bargain, prosecutors dropped two other tax 
counts, two counts of lying to officials from the U.S. Department of Housing 
and Urban Development, and one count of lying to a bank on a loan application. 
</P>
<P>
But prosecutors said they still do not believe her story that she gave most of 
the money to charity. 
</P>
<P>
"My assertion that she has been her own biggest charity will be fact" by April 
20, the date she is to be sentenced, U.S. Atty. Breckinridge Willcox said at 
the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors recommended a sentence ranging from 37 months to 46 months, roughly 
three to four years, in prison. The two charges to which she pleaded guilty 
carry a maximum sentence of 13 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted on all counts, she would have faced a maximum of 31 years in 
prison and more than $1 million in fines. 
</P>
<P>
Harrell, 46, who confessed to government officials in December, 1988, became a 
symbol of mismanagement at HUD when scandal erupted there last summer. After 
her indictment last November, U.S. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh said the case was 
the largest ever involving the theft of federal funds by an individual. 
</P>
<P>
Harrell went against the advice of her attorney and freely discussed taking the 
money in testimony before Congress and in several nationally televised 
interviews. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors say Harrell took at least $6.6 million from HUD, money generated by 
sales of HUD properties that Harrell handled as a private escrow agent for the 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
Harrell said she has documents to prove that she took only $4.75 million in HUD 
funds. And she said that, contrary to the prosecutor's assertion that only a 
little went to charity, in fact less than 6% of the money benefited her family. 
</P>
<P>
Harrell said she hopes to be sentenced to perform community service but regards 
prison as a chance to get a college degree. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the kids (her son, John, and his wife, Vicki) just think of it as Mom 
going away a few years for college," said Harrell, who will become a 
grandmother sometime next month.

Pope John Paul II, celebrating Mass today with the biggest and most

avoid the seduction of drugs and sex. 
</P>
<P>
Young people must "face the plagues of modern times," the Pope said on the 
second to last stop of his five-nation tour of the impoverished Sahel region, 
south of the Sahara desert. 
</P>
<P>
They must resist "the seduction of drugs and misunderstood sexuality," he told 
the crowd in a dust-blown field at the Yagma Marian shrine, 9 miles from the 
capital, Ouagadougou. 
</P>
<P>
At the Mass the Pope also spoke against artificial birth control, abortion and 
euthanasia. 
</P>
<P>
Church officials said they expected 300,000 people for the Mass, but reporters 
put the number at about 100,000.

DEMOCRATS EXPECT HOT DEBATE; HOLLINGS CALLS BUDGET 'FRAUD'

President Bush's $1.23-trillion budget drew a skeptical response from several 
Democrats in Congress today with one senator describing it as "another fraud" 
and a House leader calling for scaling back the President's defense proposals. 
</P>
<P>
While Democrats who control both houses of Congress were careful not to dismiss 
the budget out of hand -- in past years they had often characterized Reagan 
Administration budgets as "dead on arrival" -- they predicted a brutal debate 
over spending priorities. 
</P>
<P>
"They continue to jimmy the figures," Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.), a 
high-ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee, said of the Bush proposal. 
"It's another fraud." 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a stand-pat budget. I don't think it's a budget that really meets 
our needs," said House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Thomas S. Foley of Washington emerged from a White House meeting 
and immediately predicted a "larger reduction" in defense spending than Bush 
has proposed. 
</P>
<P>
"There'll be a debate about defense; there's no question about that," said 
Foley, making note of the changes under way in Eastern Europe that would allow 
the United States to scale back its military presence.

Troops early today captured a key leader in last month's coup attempt, and the 
military chief said the arrest will severely weaken efforts to launch a new bid 
to topple the government. 
</P>
<P>
Brig. Gen. Edgardo Abenina, captured outside a house in suburban Quezon City 
with two other rebel officers, is believed to be the senior officer involved in 
the Dec. 1-9 coup attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Abenina jumped a fence fleeing the troops but fell and injured a leg, said 
Brig. Gen. Rodolfo Biazon, chief of the National Capital Region Defense 
Command. He then surrendered, Biazon said. 
</P>
<P>
Biazon accused Abenina of forming the coalition of soldiers and supporters of 
the late President Ferdinand E. Marcos who led the December attacks, the sixth 
and bloodiest bid to oust President Corazon Aquino. Abenina is supposed to be a 
member of the military junta that would have replaced Aquino had the coup 
succeeded, Biazon said. 
</P>
<P>
At least 113 people were killed and more than 500 injured in the failed coup.

<P>
Consumer spending rose 7.3% in 1989, its fastest advance in three years, while 
incomes jumped 9%, the largest increase in five years, the government said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said spending totaled $3.58 trillion last year, posting 
the largest gain since a 6.1% advance in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending is considered a barometer of economic health because it 
accounts for about two-thirds of the nation's economic activity. The department 
reported last Friday that spending posted a rare decline of 0.1% during the 
entire fourth quarter of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Incomes totaled $4.43 trillion last year. Their 9% rise marked the sharpest 
jump since a 9.5% increase in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Americans' savings rate, savings as a percent of disposable income, rose to 
5.5% from a 4.2% rate in 1988. It was the highest rate since the 6.1% posted in 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
On a monthly basis, spending rose 1% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
$3.58 trillion in December, the smallest increase since a 1% advance last 
August. 
</P>
<P>
Incomes, however, edged up just 0.5% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
$4.57 trillion, the smallest increase since a 0.2% gain last September. 
</P>
<P>
The unusually cold weather contributed to the December jump in spending. 
Expenditures for fuel oil, electricity and natural gas increased $15.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Purchases of durable goods -- big-ticket items expected to last more than three 
years -- rose $6.7 billion after declining $2.8 billion the previous month. 
Non-durable purchases gained $6.2 billion after a $3.4-billion November 
increase. Spending on services increased $24.1 billion following a $9.6-billion 
advance the previous month. 
</P>
<P>
Several special factors affected the incomes last month. 
</P>
<P>
"The December increase was boosted by a return to work following strikes in the 
aircraft and telephone industries and was reduced by decreases in retroactive 
Social Security benefit payments and in subsidy payments to farm proprietors," 
the Commerce Department said. 
</P>
<P>
Excluding the special factors, income increased $23.6 billion or 0.5% in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
The December report showed that Americans' incomes after taxes rose 0.4% after 
a 1% gain in November. 
</P>
<P>
The key component of the income category -- wages and salaries -- increased 
$16.9 billion in December, reflecting in part the end of the Boeing Co. 
aircraft strike. Wages and salaries rose $2 billion in November. 
</P>
<P>
Payrolls at manufacturing companies increased $2.3 billion after dropping $5.9 
billion in November.

Japan will propose that textiles and clothing trade be liberalized by making it 
subject to regulations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, an 
official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said today. 
</P>
<P>
About half of the world's fiber trade is now governed by 114 agreements under 
the 1986 Multi-Fiber Arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese proposal would see MFA abolished in 1991 and textiles and clothing 
gradually integrated into GATT, with full integration by 1999. 
</P>
<P>
The change would mean pulling down the complex system of tariff walls erected 
to protect domestic textile clothing industries from low-cost foreign 
competition.

Colgate-Palmolive Co. today announced an agreement to acquire Canada's bleach 
and fabric softener businesses from Bristol Myers Squibb Co. for $172 million. 
</P>
<P>
The purchase is part of Colgate's strategy to be a major force in the 
profitable bleach category, said Reuben Mark, the consumer products company's 
chairman, president and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
Before buying the two businesses, which will be known as the Javex 
Manufacturing Co. Inc. and the Javex Marketing Co. Inc., Colgate was the 
largest marketer of household bleach outside North America, Mark said. 
</P>
<P>
Colgate built a strong presence in bleach overseas mainly through its 
acquisition of the Cotelle and Klorin bleach businesses in Europe and by 
introducing its own brands in selected world markets. 
</P>
<P>
The addition of the Javex companies will almost double Colgate's revenue base 
in Canada.

Campbell Soup Co. and Reynolds Metals Co. announced today a long-term supply 
agreement under which Reynolds eventually will provide recyclable cans for all 
Campbell's juices. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement includes Campbell's Tomato Juice, V8, Spicy V8 and Juice Bowl 
brands in both 5.5-ounce and 11.5-ounce can sizes. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds' patented Stay-on-Tab ends also will replace former tape tab ends on 
Campbell's juice cans. 
</P>
<P>
"The same advantages which have made the aluminum beverage can the 
consumer-preferred container in the beer and soft drink markets are also 
applicable to non-carbonated beverages," said Jeremiah Sheehan, vice president 
and general manager of the Reynolds Can Division. 
</P>
<P>
In order to meet Campbell's demands, Reynolds will add new capacity to three 
existing can manufacturing operations. 
</P>
<P>
The Richmond-based company operates 10 aluminum can manufacturing plants and 
two can end-making facilities in the United States. Since 1980, Reynolds said 
it has recycled more aluminum cans than it produces.

The four London stars of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical "Aspects of Love" will 
bring the show to Broadway, publicists for the show announced. 
</P>
<P>
Ann Crumb, Michael Ball, Kevin Colson and Kathleen Rowe McAllen have signed to 
reprise their London roles when the hit show opens April 8 at the Broadhurst 
Theater. 
</P>
<P>
Ball, who is British, and Colson, who is Australian, are being allowed to work 
on Broadway under an exchange agreement with the actors' union, Actors Equity. 
Crumb and McAllen are American. 
</P>
<P>
The situation is in marked contrast to the 1988 Broadway debut of Lloyd 
Webber's "Phantom of the Opera," which was preceded by months of acrimonious 
negotiation between the composer and the New York branch of Actors Equity over 
the employment on Broadway of Lloyd Webber's wife, Sarah Brightman. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd Webber eventually won, and Brightman opened the show in New York 
alongside the two other original London stars of "Phantom," Michael Crawford 
and Steve Barton.

Lloyd Richards, the outgoing dean of the Yale School of Drama, was inducted

today as the school announced a nationwide search for his successor. Richards 
has been in the job since 1979 but now wants more time to pursue other aspects 
of the theater, including acting. He said his responsibilities at Yale have 
forced him to pass up directing opportunities in England and in the Soviet 
Union as well as offers to act and direct films.

Patti LuPone is not amused. She originated the role of Eva Peron in the Andrew 
Lloyd Webber-Tim Rice opera, "Evita," but she is not among those being 
considered for the film version of the show. 
</P>
<P>
Barbra Streisand has been. So has Liza Minnelli, and so has Meryl Streep, who 
was to do the role before she backed out of the project, saying that she was 
tired and needed to take some time off. 
</P>
<P>
"No," said LuPone in a recent interview here. "I'm not amused that they haven't 
even considered me for the film version, but then I'm in good company. The same 
thing happened to Carol Channing, Mary Martin, Ethel Merman and Julie Andrews. 
They all originated stage roles that were given to others when the film 
versions of their musicals were made." 
</P>
<P>
LuPone may be out of the running for "Evita," but there is no need to feel 
sorry for her. She very recently had a long run in the Broadway revival of 
"Anything Goes," and she is now seen weekly in "Life Goes On," a television 
series in which she plays the mother of a boy with Down's syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
LuPone has also done five movies. Her newest is "Driving Miss Daisy." In it she 
plays Florine, wife of Boolie (Dan Aykroyd), the son of Miss Daisy, the Atlanta 
matron who forms a 25-year friendship with her chauffeur. 
</P>
<P>
Currently LuPone is busy with the television series. She finds the pace 
"extremely grueling. I'm physically capable, but it is grueling." 
</P>
<P>
If the series returns for a second season, LuPone will stay with it. "It will 
be back," she said. "It's protected. They won't cancel it because it has had 
too much publicity."

New Kids on the Block, the hottest teen-age pop group since the Jacksons and 
Menudo, say they want to be role models for the youth of today. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people associate musicians with drugs, and craziness, and being bad 
people," said New Kid Jon Knight, 20. 
</P>
<P>
"But that's not what we want to be with this group." 
</P>

Last week, New Kids was named Favorite Pop Rock Group at the American Music 
Awards. Their album, "Hangin' Tough Live," has sold 7 million copies and was 
named the Favorite Pop Rock Album at the awards show. 
</P>
<P>
"Joining the group was something like basketball: If you play basketball you 
can stay off the streets, you can set a goal. Music has made a goal for us," 
Danny Wood, 19, said in an interview published in The Tennessean Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The other members of the quintet are Donnie Wahlberg, 20, the group's oldest 
member; Jordan Knight, 18, and Joe McIntyre, who was 13 when he joined in 1984.

Country music star Waylon Jennings is singing a different tune since gaining a

Jennings was scheduled to accept his General Educational Development

He enrolled in Kentucky Educational Television's "GED on TV" program last fall 
after talking about it with Mrs. Wilkinson, the wife of Gov. Wallace Wilkinson. 
He passed the exam in December after studying tapes on his tour bus. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Wilkinson said Jennings, whose hits include "Mama, Don't Let Your Babies 
Grow Up to be Cowboys" (with Willie Nelson) and the theme to "The Dukes of 
Hazzard" TV show, was ecstatic when he learned he had passed. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got to admit, I don't think I've ever talked to a teen-ager more

PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: SENNA MAY BE A NATURAL LAXATIVE, BUT IT IS DANGEROUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE GRAEDON, AND TERESA GRAEDON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Q. I'm worried about my sister. I'm afraid the herbal laxative she swears by is 
ruining her health. 
</P>
<P>
Donna has always insisted that natural remedies are far superior to regular 
medicine. The herbalist she consulted told her to use senna regularly to flush 
the toxins from her system. 
</P>
<P>
Isn't it dangerous to use any kind of laxative too often? 
</P>
<P>
A. We don't know what toxins your sister thinks she is flushing, but she could 
well be doing herself more harm than good. 
</P>
<P>
Senna may be "natural," but that doesn't make it safe. This strong cathartic 
can cause cramping and diarrhea. Regular use can interfere with normal bowel 
function. 
</P>
<P>
Your sister sounds like a laxative abuser. Experts estimate that anywhere from 
5% to 15% of Americans overuse laxatives, often in a misguided attempt at 
weight control. 
</P>
<P>
The sooner Donna weans herself from senna, the healthier she will be. Fiber 
from bran and whole grains is a far more natural way to maintain regularity. 
</P>
<P>
Q. I was interested in your report about Scandinavian scientists finding that 
coffee raised cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
I have been drinking coffee for about 85 years, since I was a youngster in a 
Swedish home. In the old days, we ground the coffee at home, put it in a pot of 
cold water and heated it on the wood stove until it came to a boil. 
</P>
<P>
I drink four or five cups a day. It doesn't keep me awake, and I don't worry 
about how much cholesterol it contains. I'm glad I was raised long before the 
scientists started studying coffee. 
</P>
<P>
A. Coffee itself doesn't contain cholesterol, so no need to worry about that. 
</P>
<P>
But researchers now believe that brewing coffee the old-fashioned way you 
describe leads to elevated cholesterol levels. The more boiled coffee a person 
drinks, the more of this undesirable blood fat the body makes. Filtered coffee 
appears safer, so perhaps the paper filter removes the chemical culprit. 
</P>
<P>
Since you have already survived to a ripe old age, we see no reason for you to 
change your coffee drinking habits at this stage. 
</P>
<P>
Q. When I had the flu, I took a liquid cold formula with 1000 mg of 
acetaminophen plus three or four Tylenols a day for a headache. I was surprised 
at how much better my bad back felt, and I'd like to maintain this relief. How 
many Tylenols can I safely take in a day? 
</P>
<P>
A. The acetaminophen label says you should not take more than 4 grams (8 Extra 
Strength Tylenols) a day. Daily use over an extended period could increase your 
risk of kidney damage, however.

LIZ SMITH: STREISAND'S 'PRINCE OF TIDES' MOVED TO COLUMBIA 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
NO GRASS has grown under the fast feet of Jon Peters -- now one of the 
billion-dollar boys of Columbia, playing "Kong" to Peter Guber's "King." Jon, 
once hairdresser to Barbra Streisand, then Barbra's lover, then Barbra's movie 
producer-partner for many years, has now inked Streisand's latest pet project. 
"The Prince of Tides" has been moved from MGM/UA to Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
So Jon and Barbra will be working together again. She'll direct the movie and 
also play the role of the New York City psychiatrist. But Barbra, who tried 
over the last two years to talk Robert Redford into portraying the 
teacher-coach of the Carolina-Georgia Tidewater region, has given up on her 
"The Way We Were" co-star. She will put Nick Nolte in the leading role of Pat 
Conroy's novel. 
</P>
<P>
JUST WAIT until tomorrow when Premiere magazine's March issue hits the stands 
with a bang. It may cause whimpers. Editors Nancy Griffin and Kim Masters have 
interviewed scores of movie pros who've worked through the years with 
Guber-Peters. Sources had much to say, including Jon's ex-wife, Lesley Ann 
Warren, and "Mad Max" director George Miller, who toiled with the two on "The 
Witches of Eastwick." 
</P>
<P>
The article is the latest in a series of deadly portraits of Columbia's new 
boss men. (Vanity Fair and Fortune have already had their say.) Everybody 
credits Jon and Peter with very special talents, but they are also cited for an 
ability to spend lots of other people's money, to cross-market deals, and to 
take credit for the work of others. I don't think Guber-Peters will like this 
story, but Hollywood will be riveted. 
</P>
<P>
SPEAKING OF Lesley Ann Warren -- she is the talk of TV with her coming CBS 
miniseries, "Family of Spies." It unravels for six hours beginning Feb. 4. 
Lesley Ann periodically revives her career; remember her as the dizzy 
gangster's girl in "Victor/Victoria"? 
</P>
<P>
Even hotter is the word-of-mouth about her as Flora in the A&amp;E channel's 
Feb. 1 adaptation of Tennessee Williams' "Twenty-Seven Wagons Full of Cotton." 
Lesley co-stars with Ray Sharkey and Peter Boyle in this sizzler. 
</P>
<P>
WANT TO read a different point of view? Almost everything written about "Roger 
and Me" applauds the idea of the little guy standing up to an industry titan. 
But the capitalist film critic Malcolm Forbes says: "The real irony of the 
movie is that no one in America has exerted more Herculean efforts to get the 
U.S. automotive industry back in high gear than Roger Smith. He has revitalized 
the world's largest business while it's been besieged by lower-waged foreign 
competition. To make this warm, caring, top-notch CEO the film's villain is the 
ultimate irony." 
</P>
<P>
REMEMBER? There were two very sensationalizing books about machinations at CBS 
News over the last year. But if you want to read a REAL insider's considered 
and dispassionate story of this great network, pick up the super book by Les 
Midgley, titled "How Many Words Do You Want?" Veteran Midgley gives us a grand 
look at the "golden age" of newspapers and TV. This is "must" reading for 
dedicated news junkies alike.

Marc Spindler, a defensive tackle from Pittsburgh who might skip his final year 
of college football and turn pro, is a step closer to making that decision. 
</P>
<P>
Spindler had his right knee examined over the weekend in Kansas City by a 
doctor who said the joint is sound. That pronouncement gives Spindler the 
opportunity to declare himself eligible for the NFL draft in April. 
</P>
<P>
Spindler, reportedly angered at the recent Pitt firings of Coach Mike Gottfried 
and defensive line Coach Frank D'Alonzo, reportedly is ready to bypass the 
coming season in favor of the pro ranks. Draft expert Mel Kiper Jr. said 
Spindler is a likely first-round draft choice.

Big Eight foes Missouri and Kansas remained 1 and 2 in the college basketball 
poll today, with Arkansas, Michigan and Duke each improving three places from 
last week to round out the top five. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers (19-1) held the top spot for the second straight week with 59 
first-place votes and 1,569 points from the nationwide panel of sportswriters 
and broadcasters. 
</P>
<P>
Missouri struggled in its first game as a No. 1 team in seven years, beating 
Rutgers 89-84. It followed that with an easy win over Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas (20-1), which was No. 1 for two weeks before losing to Missouri on Jan. 
20, received the other four first-place votes and finished with 1,510 points. 
</P>
<P>
The three teams that improved three places from last week each had two 
conference victories in as many games. 
</P>
<P>
Arkansas (17-2) beat Houston and Texas to stay unbeaten in the Southwest 
Conference and received 1,349 points. Michigan (15-3) downed Big Ten rivals 
Northwestern and Michigan State and had 1,285 points, 62 more than Duke, which 
beat North Carolina State and Georgia Tech in Atlantic Coast Conferences games 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
Georgetown, which had been third, was sixth and was followed in the Top Ten by 
Syracuse, Purdue, Oklahoma and Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
The Hoyas (15-2) lost to Big East rival Syracuse (14-3) on Saturday -- the 
Orangemen's first win ever at the Capital Centre -- and received 1,190 points, 
49 more than Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
Purdue (15-2) is the surprising Big Ten leader, and the Boilermakers moved from 
13th to eighth with 1,034 points. Oklahoma (14-2) straightened out from a 
two-game losing streak and stayed ninth with 993 points, just two more than 
Louisville (14-3), which dropped from fourth after losing to DePaul on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois (15-3) led the Second Ten with 969 points and was followed by UNLV, 
Connecticut, Louisiana State, La Salle, UCLA, Georgia Tech, St. John's, 
Minnesota and Loyola Marymount. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon State topped the final five ahead of Indiana, Xavier, Ohio, Arizona and 
North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
The Tar Heels' No. 25 ranking put them back in the poll after missing the last 
four weeks and six of seven after having been ranked every week for almost 
seven years. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina (15-6), which was seventh in the preseason voting, came back to 
the rankings with victories over Clemson and Wake Forest. 
</P>
<P>
Dropping from the poll was Alabama (14-5). The Crimson Tide, 24th last week, 
lost to Tennessee and beat Auburn last week. 
</P>
<P>
Connecticut, which has won its last three Big East games over Syracuse, 
Georgetown and St. John's, improved seven places from last week's No. 20 
ranking and that jump was matched by UCLA, which was 16th after a Pac-10 
victory over Oregon State. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest drop of a ranked team was Indiana's fall from 12th to 22nd after 
Big Ten losses to Michigan State and Minnesota by 18 and 19 points, 
respectively.

Preliminary TV ratings showed that the Super Bowl averaged a 38.9 rating in 23 
cities, A. C. Nielsen Co. audience estimates showed today. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Eisenberg, a CBS vice president for research, said his network expects 
the ratings to rise to 43.5 when national estimates are available Tuesday. Each 
national ratings point represents 921,000 homes. 
</P>
<P>
If the national ratings don't appreciably rise from the 23-city "overnight" 
figures, Sunday's contest could prove the lowest-rated Super Bowl since 1971, 
when Baltimore beat Dallas 16-13.

Fans who saw their Super Bowl dreams dashed a fourth time took the loss hard, 
although a few attempted to keep their perspective. 
</P>
<P>
At the Mammoth Events Center in Denver, a radio station's Broncos celebration 
ended up being a wake Sunday evening as San Francisco's rout of Denver 
unfolded. 
</P>
<P>
"It's awful," said Milton Dicker, 36, of Denver. 
</P>
<P>
"It stinks," said Viveca Natulund, 19, of Golden. 
</P>
<P>
"It's embarrassing," said Angel Portee, 16, of Denver. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Deltoro, 39, of Denver, was more conciliatory. "There's nothing wrong with 
being No. 2," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the orange-and-blue faithful were sprinkled a few 49ers fans, and they 
showed compassion for the Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
"During the regular season, I root for the Broncos, but when it comes to Super 
Bowl, the 49ers are my team," said Doug Spainhower. The Lakewood contractor's 
red-and-gold 49ers jogging outfit and cap stood out in the sea of 
blue-and-orange-clad Broncos fans at Jackson's Hole, a large sports bar owned 
by former Bronco Ron Egloff. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the Broncos will be in the Super Bowl next year and they'll probably 
win," Spainhower said. "I don't feel sorry for the Broncos, but I feel sorry 
for the fans." 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously I'm very disappointed," said Egloff, as the crowd began to dwindle 
at the end of the fourth quarter. "They had a slight chance, but the 49ers 
played a great game. How do you stop a team like that?" 
</P>
<P>
Jackson's Hole, in suburban Lakewood, was the scene of one of dozens of Super 
Bowl parties. The standing-room-only crowd gathered around the pub's 33 
television sets included out-of-town visitors. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a New England Patriots fan, but I was converted," said Donald O'Connor, 
27, of County Kerry, Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
Hope began to fade for most Broncos fans by halftime, when Denver trailed 27-3, 
but a few were confident of a second-half comeback. "The Broncos are a 
second-half team," said Debbie DeThomas, 33, a Denver travel agent. They proved 
not to be Sunday, however, as the 49ers out-scored them 28-7 in the second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
At the Denver County Jail, two fights erupted during the first quarter among 
male inmates watching the game. The women prisoners traded gibes instead of 
punches. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey Milkman, a psychologist in private practice and a professor of 
psychology at Metropolitan State College, said Denver has experience in seeing 
its expectations dashed. 
</P>
<P>
"The odyssey of the Broncos mirrors the plight of the Denver or Colorado 
resident -- all dressed up and no place to go," said Milkman. 
</P>
<P>
"It really parallels the expectations of a state that was built up and expected 
to be on top of economic growth and development and has really fallen short in 
that endeavor," he said. "We feel a sense of underdog, struggle, not being able 
to actualize our dreams. That is really symbolized in what the Broncos have 
been doing." 
</P>
<P>
Broncos fans won't be able to welcome home their fallen heroes today. 
</P>
<P>
Team officials asked that a planned rally at Stapleton International Airport be 
canceled, said Brian Muir, a spokesman for the Denver Super Celebration '90. 
"It was a team decision," Muir said.

LATINOVISION: Before launching Orange County's only local Spanish-language TV 
service (B1), KBUENAvision asked Latinos in Santa Ana what they'd like to see. 
. . . It turns out they want what everyone else wants: More than half want 
movies, nearly half want sports, about a third want telenovelas (soap operas) 
and only about 10% want news. "When you survey special groups, there's almost 
never a significant difference," said the cable channel's Doug Montandon. . . . 
In sports, however, Latinos want soccer and boxing. Mark I. Pinsky and Steve

BUILDERS GRAB RECALL TOOL IN MISSION VIEJO CAMPAIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mission Viejo City Councilman Robert A. Curtis, a slow-growth proponent in 
fast-growing South Orange County, wasn't surprised when his foes launched a 
recall campaign against him last year. 
</P>
<P>
Those foes included powerful Orange County developers, whom Curtis irritated in 
his first year in office. Soon after, those developers helped raise more than 
$190,000 to oust him. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew they were gunning for me," said Curtis, a lawyer who makes $500 a month 
as a council member and who faces a recall vote Feb. 27. "They didn't make any 
secret of it." 
</P>
<P>
Curtis' battle has frayed tempers, divided loyalties and stirred Mission 
Viejo's political waters for months. But the campaign, while impassioned, is 
far from the first of its kind. For more than a decade, developers have been 
deeply involved in recall campaigns against local elected officials, bringing 
big money to bear on a process originally designed to thwart powerful private 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, some political observers worry that the development community is 
undercutting the spirit of California's recall laws, crafted in the early 1900s 
as a populist tool for controlling the power of big business and its ability to 
influence politicians. Now, critics say, that weapon often is used by the 
interests it was meant to restrain. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that the people of California who voted for the recall reforms 
had this in mind," said John Larson, chairman of the Fair Political Practices 
Commission. "They weren't casting a vote to make it easier for business 
interests to control the process." 
</P>
<P>
In 1976, Sonoma County Supervisor Bill Kortum became one of the first elected 
officials in California to feel the wrath of the development community in a 
recall. Elected in 1975, Kortum, a veterinarian who supported slow-growth 
positions, was the subject of a recall a year later; his official, written 
response called it "a power play by land development interests." 
</P>
<P>
Kortum was heavily outspent in the recall campaign, and he lost the election, 
ending his political career. "They (developers) bring in a lot of money, and 
they play very rough, believe me," Kortum said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
Kortum and others say that they find a disturbing shift of political power in 
the way developer-backed recalls often unfold. 
</P>
<P>
The days of outraged voters banding together to circulate petitions against a 
recalcitrant elected official are waning, they say. In their place have emerged 
well-oiled political machines, equipped with political consultants, high 
finances, glossy campaign materials, and legions of paid petition-circulators 
and phone-bank operators. 
</P>
<P>
But after a decade during which slow-growth advocates eagerly took advantage of 
the initiative process, developers and their lobbyists describe the recall 
battles as a sign of democracy on the rebound. 
</P>
<P>
"For a long time you had a slow-growth movement that was moving through a 
vacuum, without significant opposition," said Bart Doyle, general counsel of 
the Building Industry Assn. of Southern California, which has contributed 
$5,000 to the Curtis recall. "It was sort of a free ride for 10 years, and 
suddenly you have that opposition. What you're seeing now is a shift in the 
balance of power. We're competing." 
</P>
<P>
Big-Money Campaigns 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Wessell, a Burbank political consultant who represents business interests 
in recalls and many other kinds of campaigns, echoed those sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
"We're really in an era where these land-use issues are getting a thorough 
debate," he said. "You've got this clash of interests, and these are ways for 
people to work out their disagreements at the ballot box." 
</P>
<P>
Advocates of slow growth and environmentalism are far less sanguine. The bottom 
line in developer participation, they say, is big money. That, they say, skews 
a process intended to empower citizens and grass-roots organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Recent Southern California recalls -- one in Moreno Valley in 1986, for 
instance, and the Mission Viejo contest that is still under way -- demonstrate 
how big the financial stakes have become: With only relatively small-town 
officials being contested, pro-development forces raised more than $140,000 in 
each of those campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Other cases also illustrate the point. Four council members in Agoura Hills 
were outspent by better than 3 to 1 in last year's developer-backed recall 
attempt. Former San Clemente Mayor Karoline Koester and one of her council 
colleagues were outspent by about 15 to 1 in 1980; Koester won the recall 
election by a nose, but her colleague died during the campaign. Curtis is 
currently facing a fund-raising disadvantage of almost 10 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
"It's frankly terrifying," said Judy Corbett, executive director of the Local 
Government Commission in Sacramento. "How can you have a democratic system when 
one side has such an advantage in resources?" 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Mayor Larry Agran, a well-known slow-growth proponent, also worries 
about developers co-opting the political process with big contributions. 
"Developers have enough strength economically that they ought not be holding 
the political process hostage as well," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Developers and representatives of building groups liken those sentiments to 
political sour grapes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the wonderful thing about democracy," said Doyle of the Building Industry 
Assn. "It cuts both ways. The no-growth proponents are saying that certain 
people should be allowed to vote and be involved in politics and others should 
not." 
</P>
<P>
Alex Galuzezski, project supervisor for The Frost Group, a development firm in 
Laguna Niguel, was equally impassioned. 
</P>
<P>
"I say, 'God bless this country and the system that we have,' " Galuzezski 
said. "I see this basically as an extension of the public expressing its views. 
. . . Parting with some money in this way may in the long run pay us some 
dividends." 
</P>
<P>
The Frost Group, which contributed $10,000 to the Curtis recall, builds $10 
million to $15 million a year worth of residential developments in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Growth as a Key Issue 
</P>
<P>
With the stakes high and resources such as those at their fingertips, 
developers rarely enter the recall process halfway. By backing a recall, they 
automatically earn a local official's enmity, so they play to win, observers on 
both sides say. 
</P>
<P>
"I compare this to a dam," said Santa Cruz Supervisor Gary A. Patton, who has 
informally monitored developer-financed recalls since he fought off an attempt 
to oust him in 1978. "The pressure really starts building up when you get a 
group of environmentalists taking control of their local government. Once that 
pressure starts building, it looks for a weakness. If there's the slightest 
weakness for it to exploit, the money comes rushing through the hole." 
</P>
<P>
For their part, developer and real estate proponents tend to downplay the 
significance of contributions in recall campaigns. Dana Riccard, local 
governmental relations manager for the California Assn. of Realtors, cautioned 
that "money only goes so far." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that the process is any more skewed toward developers just 
because they have money," she said. "There's a lot of political clout that can 
be generated without big bucks." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, some recall efforts fail despite big contributions, and others led by 
homeowners succeed even though developers and others contribute heavily to 
protect incumbents. In Moreno Valley's 1986 recall, for instance, three 
pro-development councilmen received overwhelming backing from the development 
community and outspent recall advocates by a margin of 50 to 1, all to no 
avail. The recall won easily. 
</P>
<P>
But campaign war chests still are a big part of building clout, and political 
scientists worry that developer participation in recalls may skew the outcome 
on behalf of a narrow special interest. 
</P>
<P>
"I certainly think there's reason to be concerned," said David Hadwiger at the 
UC Berkeley Institute for Governmental Studies. "It's clearly an extension of 
the initiative battles and election contests that have been raging for years. 
The growth-control struggles have been so fierce that it's not surprising to 
find similar battles in recall elections." 
</P>
<P>
What most needles some local politicians is not just that developers have taken 
a growing financial interest in recall campaigns. Rather, they say, recall 
efforts backed by developer interests often try to hide the real issues -- 
growth and growth management -- behind a political red herring. 
</P>
<P>
Criminal reform, tax increases, rudeness to constituents and drug use have all 
been central topics in recall efforts in which observers privately acknowledge 
that the real issue is growth. In Santa Cruz, the successful recall of two 
slow-growth supervisors ostensibly was based on their rudeness to the Navy, an 
allegation that Patton and other observers consider laughable. 
</P>
<P>
A failed recall effort last year listed San Luis Obispo County Supervisor David 
Blakely's past use of marijuana as the reason to seek his ouster, but Blakely 
and other political observers say the councilman's drug use was not the real 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
Recall supporters showed up at public hearings on a slow-growth measure and 
handed copies of their petitions to citizens who spoke out against growth 
limits, Blakely said. Several local construction and banking notables were 
among the recall supporters, and the recall campaign treasurer also ran a 
construction company. 
</P>
<P>
Blakely, who called the recall attempt "the worst thing that's ever happened to 
me in my life," escaped a prolonged contest when the petitioners failed to 
round up signatures in time to force an election. 
</P>
<P>
Edric Guise, a legislative policy analyst for the Building Industry Assn. of 
Southern California, said that educating the public on the dangers of growth 
controls is a time-consuming and expensive process. It is more cost-effective, 
Guise said, to focus on other issues on which the official is more vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody wants to spend millions of dollars (on a campaign) educating people if 
they don't have to. . . . You end up with a huge education curve, and you don't 
want to put yourself in that situation," Guise said. 
</P>
<P>
"That," he said, "is politics." 
</P>
<P>
Exercising Their Rights 
</P>
<P>
In Mission Viejo, Curtis' recall organizers say he should be ousted because of 
his intolerance of constituents, his divisiveness on the council and his 
support for a controversial annexation on the city's border. But nearly all 
political observers in Mission Viejo agree that growth and growth management 
are the important issues driving the huge developer contributions in the race. 
</P>
<P>
The Mission Viejo Co., a wholly owned subsidiary of New York-based Philip 
Morris Cos., has chipped in more than $57,000. 
</P>
<P>
"We invest millions of dollars in this community every year, and we have an 
interest in how it's run," said company spokeswoman Wendy Wetzel. She denied 
that the company is interested in pushing a growth agenda but added that it 
would fight what it considers Curtis' unwise proposals to annex additional area 
to Mission Viejo's borders. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to cash, the Mission Viejo Co.'s contribution involves the loan of 
political consultant Wessell, who has done other work for the company. 
</P>
<P>
Wessell, an articulate and philosophical observer of local politics, won his 
stripes in the development community with a string of political successes on 
behalf of his business clients. 
</P>
<P>
Among others, he helped guide the hotly contested fight against Measure A in 
Orange County. That initiative, which would have tied growth to the ability of 
local roads to handle it, was soundly defeated. 
</P>
<P>
Noting Wessell's involvement and the enormous fund raising in his race, Curtis 
wastes few chances to blast the Mission Viejo Co. and its fellow developers. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a heavy-handed, bare-knuckled attempt to force me off the council," 
Curtis said. "I can't believe the people of Mission Viejo want developers to 
control the life of this city, and that's exactly what they're trying to do." 
</P>
<P>
Helen Monroe, who chairs the pro-recall Alliance for Mission Viejo, said she 
has no problem with taking large contributions from developers. "He has opposed 
development rather vehemently," she said of Curtis. "I'm not surprised that 
they're fighting back. They certainly have that right." 
</P>
<P>
As developers exercise their rights, however, officials who have faced such 
recall attempts warn of myriad fallouts. Most obvious is the removal of the 
official from office; most insidious, say the office-holders who survive, is 
the chilling effect the recalls have. 
</P>
<P>
"Officials find themselves looking over their shoulders at the developers," 
former Supervisor Kortum said. "It's at the local level that land use in this 
state is being decided, and it's there that it's hardest to resist that kind of 
influence. It's dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
That fear is central to California's tradition of progressive populism, whose 
patriarchal figure, Hiram Johnson, gave the state its recall laws. 
</P>
<P>
"This is clearly not in the spirit of what Johnson thought he was doing," UC 
Berkeley's Hadwiger said of developers making use of one of the former 
governor's most highly touted reforms. 
</P>
<P>
And though developer groups note that they, too, are blessed with democratic 
rights, Johnson's legacy seems to leave little doubt about where he would come 
down in the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
"In some form or another, every governmental problem . . . has arisen because 
private interest has intervened or has sought for its own gain to exploit 
either the resources or the politics of this state," the governor proclaimed in 
his 1911 inaugural address. "I take it, therefore, that the first duty that is 
mine to perform is to eliminate every private interest in the government."

TRIAL READY TO BEGIN ON MEASURE D ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's been 18 months since Cameron Cosgrove was sworn in as a member of the 
Irvine City Council, but some residents still refuse to call him "councilman." 
</P>
<P>
One speaker at a council meeting last week strode to the podium and introduced 
herself to the staff, members of the public, Mayor Larry Agran, "members of the 
City Council and Mr. Cosgrove." She leaned heavily on the "Mr.," denying 
Cosgrove the title accorded his office. 
</P>
<P>
From his seat, Cosgrove quietly burned. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like a victim," he said later. "I really do." 
</P>
<P>
For Cosgrove and his foes, the question of whether he deserves a seat on the 
council comes to a head this week, as a long-awaited trial begins in Orange 
County Superior Court. Beginning Wednesday, plaintiffs in the case will argue 
that Cosgrove was seated illegally in July, 1988, and that he should be removed 
from office before he is allowed to enter the June 5 election as an incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
Cosgrove and his allies retort that the lawsuit is purely political and is 
designed as much to hurt Agran as it is to clarify legal issues raised in the 
1988 race that put Cosgrove into office. 
</P>
<P>
That election, in which Cosgrove was the third-place finisher -- less than 150 
votes short of finishing second -- had another item on the ballot. It has 
become the source of a bitter controversy in Irvine, and the issues and 
personalities revolving around it expose some of the city's most tempestuous 
political disagreements. 
</P>
<P>
That item was Measure D, a provision that voters approved at the same time they 
elected Cosgrove to the council and Agran to the mayoralty. The measure stated 
that the third place finisher in some council races -- those with two seats 
open but a third vacated by a council member becoming mayor -- could be subject 
to a special election if enough signatures were gathered to force it. 
</P>
<P>
What Judge Claude M. Owens will have to determine is whether Measure D is 
binding on the same election in which voters approved it. Normally, measures of 
its kind only affect subsequent actions, but Measure D states that it shall 
"become effective with the General Municipal Election of June 1988." 
</P>
<P>
"The intent of the voters was clear," said Howard Klein, an Irvine realtor who 
is one of the plaintiffs in the case. "What we're asking is that the judge 
carry it out." 
</P>
<P>
An ardent champion of the case, Klein not only fights it in the courts -- where 
he and his allies estimate that they have already spent more than $30,000 -- he 
also occasionally shows up at City Council meetings. Last week, he and the 
normally even-tempered Agran verbally tussled, demonstrating how high emotions 
have risen over the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Klein blamed Cosgrove's attorneys for delays in the court case, and Agran, a 
Cosgrove backer, defended his colleague. The two traded sharp words and then 
Agran shot out: "Mr. Klein, I would suggest that you do what you do best, which 
is to file frivolous lawsuits against this city." 
</P>
<P>
Disgusted, Klein marched away from the microphone. 
</P>
<P>
Agran and his supporters view the case as an effort to discredit the mayor, who 
swore Cosgrove into office and who has consistently supported him. As they 
note, Klein is a prominent local Republican, and Agran a Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
Cosgrove is a Republican, but Councilwoman Sally Anne Sheridan, a vocal 
Cosgrove opponent, openly mocks Cosgrove's party affiliation. "If Cam Cosgrove 
is a Republican, I'm Karl Marx living in Woodbridge," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Even Klein, who denies that the suit is partisan, admits that it has a 
political edge. If successful, it would force Cosgrove to run without the 
benefits of incumbency this June. 
</P>
<P>
And it would presumably provide ammunition to Sheridan in her effort to unseat 
Agran. Sheridan, observers agree, would spare few chances to accuse Agran of 
illegally seating his ally in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Even if Measure D is found to legally apply to the 1988 election, plaintiffs 
will have to overcome obstacles before deposing Cosgrove. There are, for 
instance, questions about the timing and manner in which their petitions 
calling for a special election were distributed. 
</P>
<P>
But both sides have reached at least the semblance of accord on one point. All 
parties say they want the matter resolved quickly: plaintiffs so that Cosgrove 
will be stripped of his incumbency, and Cosgrove so that he will have time to 
rebound from the controversy before hitting the campaign trail. 
</P>
<P>
"I really just want to get this over with," Cosgrove said in an interview last 
week. "I've been caught up in the middle for too long." JIM NEWTON

GROUP PLANS SUIT ON PETITION'S LANGUAGE

<TEXT>
<P>
A residents' group seeking to control traffic noise through a ballot initiative 
has decided to delay circulating a petition on the measure and to file suit to 
change the wording of the petition's summary instead. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Save Our Bastanchury vowed to gather enough signatures to 
call a special election and place its measure before voters. 
</P>
<P>
The city attorney's summary of that measure, released Wednesday, must appear at 
the top of each petition. 
</P>
<P>
But Mary Homme, president of Save Our Bastanchury, said members considered that 
summary biased and inaccurate. The group unanimously decided to file suit in 
Superior Court in about two weeks to force the city to write a better summary, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. R. K. (Kerry) Fox, said he believed his summary is accurate and 
unbiased. TOM McQUEENEY

FREE DESIGN SERVICE OFFERED MERCHANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Redevelopment Agency is providing local businesses with free architectural 
services in a store-rehabilitation program, hoping to spur merchant 
participation in a city effort that has so far received only a lukewarm 
response. 
</P>
<P>
The Storefront Rebate Program, introduced last year, offers financial 
assistance to merchants in specified redevelopment areas who want to give their 
buildings a face lift. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant City Manager Donald S. Anderson said the city hopes to upgrade 
buildings that are outdated or in need of repair. 
</P>
<P>
"This program was initiated due to the realization that much of the city was 
developed in the 1950s and 1960s and we're now into the 1990s," Anderson said. 
"In some cases, the building owner or tenant hasn't done any remodeling or 
rebuilding because they just didn't have the money." 
</P>
<P>
The program offers rebates of 50% to 75% for improvements ranging from a new 
coat of paint and new signs to new awnings and outside landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
To provide further incentive, the agency voted this week to provide up to 
$2,500 worth of free architectural design services to businesses that decide to 
join the program. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson said without the free design services, there would probably be little 
interest in the program from the business community. 
</P>
<P>
"We think providing the designs is really going to help. This way, they can see 
what their building can look like, it's at no cost to them and they are under 
no obligation to proceed," Anderson explained. 
</P>
<P>
The stretch of older commercial buildings along Westminster Boulevard near 
Golden West Street is the type of area that the city wants to upgrade. 
</P>
<P>
"We're anxious to get this program off the ground," Anderson said. "It's good 
for the business community and it's good for the city." GREG HERNANDEZ

PASSENGER KILLED IN CAR ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 20-year-old Buena Park man was killed Sunday when the car he was riding in 
struck a van and then flipped several times, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Julian Soto died at the scene when the impact threw him partially out the 
passenger window and the car landed on top of him, said Sgt. Thomas Campbell of 
the Los Angeles County sheriff's Norwalk station. 
</P>
<P>
The driver, Jose Guadalupe Rodriguez, also 20 and of Buena Park, fell asleep at 
the wheel and veered into the median of southbound Beach Boulevard, Campbell 
said. The jolt caused him to wake up, and he reacted by steering sharply to the 
right across two lanes. 
</P>
<P>
The car clipped the rear of a southbound van. Both vehicles began spinning 
uncontrollably and then flipped over several times, Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez was arrested by California Highway Patrol officers on suspicion of 
drunk driving and vehicular manslaughter and was was being held at Orange 
County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the van was taken to Friendly Hills Hospital in La Habra, 
suffering back pain. 
</P>
<P>
The 8:30 a.m. accident occurred in an unincorporated area bordering La Mirada 
and Fullerton, Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
The CHP normally handles traffic accidents in unincorporated areas, but the 
accident was initially thought to have occurred in La Mirada, which is under 
the jurisdiction of the sheriff's Norwalk station, he explained.

INTERSTATE BANKING'S UPHEAVAL; 
</P>
<P>
CONSULTANT EXPECTS WAVE OF MERGERS BY INSTITUTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By James S. Granelli, Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Next year, the big banks from the East will be allowed to open shop in 
California, and they'll be buying institutions here to grab as much of the 
market as they can in the richest deposit-gathering state in the union, an 
Orange County industry consultant says. 
</P>
<P>
 But to be here on day one, they'll be negotiating this year to buy one of the 
state's 425 banks or one of its 185 savings and loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, Comerica Bank in Detroit, Michigan's third-largest banking firm, 
agreed to acquire San Jose-based Plaza Commerce Bancorp, which operates a 
medium-size bank with about $450 million in assets. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana consultant Edward J. Carpenter believes that banks in the state are 
ripe for merger mania. His firm, Southport/Carpenter Group, represents numerous 
potential acquirers, from small Eastern banks to large Japanese institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Though California opened its banking borders to 11 western states 18 months 
ago, Carpenter said, the real impact will come next January, when banks 
nationwide will be able to operate in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 But it won't be just the big Eastern banks that will be fishing for a good 
catch in California, he said in a recent interview with Times staff writer 
James S. Granelli. Watch for medium-size, out-of-state banks, foreign banks and 
specialty banks to be looking for a variety of banks and S&amp;Ls in 
California, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter, 44, started his consulting business after leaving the research 
department of Security Pacific National Bank. He holds a joint master's in 
business administration from Cal State Long Beach and the UCLA Graduate School 
of Business, and he also holds a master's in finance from the Wharton School of 
Business at the University of Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Q. How will Orange County consumers fare under interstate banking? 
</P>
<P>
A. I expect 20 new commercial banks from out of the state to enter California, 
and they'll be offering a variety of charge card services, trust services and 
traditional banking services. The consumer will benefit because the history of 
interstate banking in other states has shown that in the first two years of 
interstate banking, there is a drop in the average interest rates on real 
estate construction loans, credit card borrowings and consumer loans, such as 
auto loans, home refinancing loans and home improvement loans. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Aren't out-of-state banks already offering many of these services, 
especially low-interest credit cards, to residents here? 
</P>
<P>
A. They are, but when they want to take a share of the deposit market, they 
lower their overall cost to consumers. This will be the first time they will be 
able to take deposits, and in order to gain market share, they'll drag new 
depositors in by offering teaser-rate loans. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How is this going to affect bankers here in terms of competition? 
</P>
<P>
A. Some of the banks in Orange County will find themselves attractive 
acquisition targets, and we expect that approximately 10 banks in Orange County 
will be sold and/or merged into out-of-state banks within the first two years 
of interstate banking. We don't have projections for consolidations within the 
county, but few of them have occurred in the past and there's plenty of time 
for that to happen. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Some industry observers say that with a softening market and a possibility 
of recession, we're not going to see a lot of acquisitions by out-of-state 
banks. 
</P>
<P>
A. That's just, in our experience, inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
Q. So regardless of the economy, those that want to buy will buy? 
</P>
<P>
A. Maine had the first interstate banking law in 1981. Maine would not be 
viewed as a particularly attractive state for out-of-state banks, and banking 
and the economy in general went into a two-year recession then. At the time it 
allowed banks in nearby states to come in, Maine had 27 commercial banks. In 
the first two years, during that recession, 21 new commercial banks entered 
Maine. So my sense is that California is more attractive than Maine. In other 
states that had regional banking earlier than California, also during 
recessionary times in the early 1980s, we witnessed the highest purchase price 
multiples in banking in recent history. There is no data to indicate that 
California is less attractive than any of these other states. 
</P>
<P>
Q. For the last 18 months, banks in 11 western states have been allowed to buy 
California banks. What has California's experience been under regional 
interstate banking? 
</P>
<P>
A. There's been little entry. But California banks, when they had to give an 
inch, gave an inch to the warriors who wouldn't fight the battle -- meaning 
that there are no significant large banks outside of California west of the 
Rockies. The largest banks in the West, outside of California, are either too 
small, are experiencing significant losses, are not in a position to move yet 
or already are owned by California banks. So there are no candidates to come 
into California west of the Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
Q. The law takes effect next January, but shouldn't we know this summer who's 
coming in? 
</P>
<P>
A. We're going to begin to see a number of stakeout transactions similar to the 
Comerica deal for Plaza Bank in San Jose. Comerica, a very aggressive and 
highly successful bank in the Midwest, was looking for growth-oriented business 
and a consumer state. It bought Plaza Bank at a high price, added capital and 
used a formula that allows it to pay that high price partly by distributing 
Plaza's earnings to shareholders between the deal date, which was earlier this 
year, and the trigger date next January. Numerous transactions like that are 
being negotiated and some of the more attractive banks are being taken out of 
the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Another Michigan banking firm, Michigan National Corp., owns Beverly Hills 
Savings in Mission Viejo. Do you expect Michigan National to convert the 
S&amp;L to a bank? 
</P>
<P>
A. They have made statements that they would eventually see this as their 
banking system in the West. They, like many banks, have discovered that there 
are not many larger banks available in California. In fact, if you looked at 
the 14 largest banks in the state, control of seven has been acquired in the 
last five years. The majors -- Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Security Pacific 
and First Interstate -- are large multibillion-dollar banks. There are only a 
few smaller multibillion-dollar banks -- like City National and Imperial -- 
that would be attractive targets and their stock already is trading at prices 
that are beginning to look like interstate purchase prices. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Are their stock prices high because a lot of speculators expect buyers to 
come after those banks? 
</P>
<P>
A. Correct, but after you get through that first 14, there are less than 25 out 
of 525 banks in California with between $500 million and $1 billion in assets 
that could be purchased. There are more banks than that in that category, but 
they already have been purchased. 
</P>
<P>
Q. But they could be purchased again? 
</P>
<P>
A. Well, if they're purchased by a large Japanese, German, French or Canadian 
bank, they're probably not going to be resold. And that is, in fact, the case 
on all of those purchases. 
</P>
<P>
Q. The biggest bank in Orange County is less than $300 million, and that's 
small. Do any of the 39 banks here really expect to be acquired or face stiffer 
competition? 
</P>
<P>
A. The larger banks in Orange County, those over $200 million in assets, have 
two different kinds of markets. CommerceBank, for instance, is a business bank. 
It deals with commercial companies that are medium in size and its marketplace 
is largely companies in the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area. It has a 
loan production office in Long Beach and a branch in Costa Mesa, as well as the 
main office in Newport Beach. It's a business lender bank with surprisingly few 
accounts. CommerceBank has less than 20,000 accounts, unusual for banks of that 
size. But each account has a balance of between probably $50,000 and $75,000. 
It is not likely that CommerceBank will lose its share of the business market, 
and it is typically more difficult for an out-of-state bank to acquire 
middle-market business customers than it is to acquire consumer accounts. And 
that's why CommerceBank becomes a tremendous acquisition candidate. In fact, 
any business bank that's over $150 million in assets in Orange County and has a 
five-year track record is an attractive candidate to certain interstate banks. 
</P>
<P>
Q. And the other market for the county's larger banks? 
</P>
<P>
A. The rest of the banks -- some of which have larger branch systems and have a 
mix of business and consumer accounts like Eldorado and Sunwest -- will find 
that they are going to have to be very competitive with their consumer accounts 
to hold them. And they're going to have to work harder to hold their consumer 
accounts than their business accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Q. So they are not likely merger candidates, unless they merge themselves. 
</P>
<P>
A. They are likely candidates if, as consumer banks, they reach $500 million in 
size. Now, $500 million is roughly the amount of business that you need to 
acquire to run an aggressive advertising campaign. That and a branch system of 
at least 10 offices. Now Eldorado would fit that category if it raised capital 
and continued to grow. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What happened to the notion that a bank had to have $1 billion in assets to 
attract an out-of-state suitor? 
</P>
<P>
A. If we had $50-billion companies in the state, you would have to be a 
$1-billion bank to be attractive. But the major out-of-state banks now are all 
looking at the $500-million number because that's where their minimum 
break-even point is and because the $1-billion banks just aren't available. 
We've heard Chase say it, we've heard Citicorp say it, we've heard many of the 
major interstate acquirers all say that $500 million is the minimum that they 
can acquire and still make money. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Meantime, California's four major banks are picking up sizable banks? 
</P>
<P>
A. Yes. Security Pacific, Wells Fargo and First Interstate have been running 
around the state paying unusually large prices to acquire them. They're 
beginning to consolidate market share to make less opportunities available for 
the interstate banks to acquire, and they're beginning to pay interstate 
prices. And if you look at some of these acquisitions, you see duplicative 
coverage. In Southwest Bank, Security Pacific bought a bank with branches 
virtually next door. The majors are buying these banks for three reasons: To 
increase market share prior to interstate banking; to eliminate the possibility 
of major market share entry by the big boys out East, and to position 
themselves as acquirers for the remaining banks in the state that might want to 
be sellers. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Will the Eastern banks, finding little available above the $1-billion range, 
buy two or more $500-million banks to build up market share quickly? 
</P>
<P>
A. That's exactly right. There just aren't any statewide systems. They might 
buy Pacific Valley up north and come down here and buy Santa Monica bank or 
Metro Bank or Lincoln National or Guardian. 
</P>
<P>
Q. We hear about the major Eastern banks wanting to open up in California. But 
aren't there a lot of other banks that might be interested? 
</P>
<P>
A. Everybody finds it comfortable to talk about the big buyers because the big 
buyers are not unwilling to discuss their intentions. However, there's a 
plethora of banks in the $2-billion to $10-billion category that are looking in 
California. I really can't name them because they're clients. But I can say 
that banks with specialties, certainly in Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas and 
Virginia, operate in communities that are very similar to Orange County. Those 
bank holding companies are real estate lenders and they're looking at Orange 
County and other parts of Southern California as a duplicative marketplace to 
theirs. Banks in the Northeast also are mortgage lenders and they're looking 
for niche lenders here. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What you're painting now is a picture of almost any bank with good loan 
production, any bank with some specialty, being a target. 
</P>
<P>
A. As long as they have a valid, five-year history of success. I think the 
point to be made is that when we have a recession, our level of recession is 
significantly lower than other states. And now we're seeing our market being 
buoyed by foreign as well as U.S. investors. There is no state in the union 
that is producing half of the real estate loan volume that's being generated 
from Fresno to the Mexican border. You have to be here if you want to be in the 
lending business. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do foreign banks have easier access to California than out-of-state banks? 
</P>
<P>
A. Not really. The International Banking Act of 1979 provided that a foreign 
bank had to elect one home state for full-service banking and could be in one 
other state with more limited services. The Japanese banks, except for one, 
picked California as their home state and New York as their second state. Fuji 
Bank elected New York as a home state, so it does not have a full-service 
capability in California. It wants to be here. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Now it has to wait like everyone else? 
</P>
<P>
A. Right. When interstate banking is triggered in California, the foreign bank 
can take its New York facility and open branches to California. There's a whole 
flood of foreign banks -- Canadian, French and especially South American -- 
that want to be here. Major league acquisitions will happen. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What about the state's savings and loans, which hold more than 25% of that 
industry's deposits? Are we going to see any big S&amp;Ls go down? 
</P>
<P>
A. You bet we will. We're negotiating currently for four healthy S&amp;Ls that 
hold in excess of $10 billion in assets each. In total, we've got over 20 
negotiations going on for S&amp;Ls in the state. What the banks have learned is 
that if they use the savings and loan culture as a separate vehicle within 
their holding companies to originate mortgages, they can create a very nice 
subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
Q. From what you've said, most interstate banking activity will occur over the 
next two years. How many banks will be coming into California by 1995 and what 
kind of consolidation will there be in the banking industry in that time? 
</P>
<P>
A. We expect that, within the first five years, of the approximately 425 
commercial banks in California, 175 will sell or be merged either with each 
other or with out-of-state banks. Of the 250 banks remaining, 150 are in rural 
communities that are not particularly attractive for acquirers and 100 will 
have built fortress walls and will be fighting off the entrants from 
out-of-state. There are about 185 savings and loans. We believe through natural 
attrition -- failure, merger or other intrastate activities -- that 75 savings 
and loans will disappear. Of the remaining 110 S&amp;Ls, we believe that 50 
will merge with out-of-state banks. 
</P>
<P>
Q. That doesn't sound like a very big S&amp;L industry here. 
</P>
<P>
A. Except that the total assets in those 50 S&amp;Ls will be dramatic.

UTAH MAGNATE, GE UNIT MAY JOIN IN BID FOR ARISTECH

Utah chemical magnate Jon Huntsman and a General Electric Co. division said 
Friday that they are attempting to form a 50-50 joint venture that could 
acquire Aristech Chemical Corp. for more than $899 million. 
</P>
<P>
Huntsman Holdings Corp. and GE Plastics of Pittsfield, Mass., said the proposal 
could enable Huntsman to boost his offer for Aristech to at least $26 a share 
from $25, according to a letter that the Salt Lake City businessman mailed to 
Aristech board member R. S. Evans. 
</P>
<P>
Aristech spokesman David Higie declined to comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Huntsman is in a bidding war for Aristech with Mitsubishi Corp. of Japan and 
Aristech's senior management, which last week offered $26 a share. The senior 
management group is led by Aristech Chairman Thomas Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
Aristech has about 32 million shares outstanding, or 34.6 million when fully 
diluted. Aristech stock dropped 12.5 cents to $25.125 in New York Stock 
Exchange trading on Friday 
</P>
<P>
Huntsman's $25-a-share offer, worth about $865 million, was rejected in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
Aristech's board in effect rejected the Mitsubishi-management bid on Wednesday 
when it announced that it would seek bids from buyers willing to pay more than 
$26 a share. The board set a bidding deadline for 5 p.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Huntsman asked Aristech to extend the deadline until Feb. 20 to 
give him more time to review Aristech's financial condition and form the joint 
venture. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, the 5 p.m. Jan. 29 deadline for the submission of bids, as set 
forth in your Jan. 24 letter to me, will not afford us an adequate opportunity 
to conduct the necessary review," Huntsman wrote. 
</P>
<P>
"In view of Mitsubishi Corp.'s and Aristech management's lengthy period to 
conduct a complete review of Aristech, fairness dictates that we be afforded a 
reasonable due diligence review period," the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
Huntsman has signed an agreement not to accumulate additional Aristech stock 
unless he offers to buy all outstanding stock for $25 per share or more. 
Huntsman currently owns 8.7% of the company's stock, according to Huntsman 
spokesman Joel Frank. 
</P>
<P>
In Securities and Exchange Commission documents, Huntsman said he has signed a 
confidentiality agreement in return for receiving confidential financial data 
about the company. 
</P>
<P>
Much of Aristech's holdings are former USX Chemical Corp. properties. The 
company employs about 1,800 people at 10 plants in eight states.

ATTACHMENT TO LAND BINDS PEOPLE TO TRAGIC DESTINY IN 'HOLY DAYS'

<P>
If a poem is a form of dense evocational shorthand, Sally Nemeth's "Holy Days" 
is a stage poem. It is uncommonly affecting -- an elegy for the lost souls in 
the dying plains of Kansas, 1936, who clung to their blighted homesteads like 
bees to the poisoned hive. Not as a matter of choice, but of inevitability. As 
one of the characters in the play that opened Saturday at South Coast Repertory 
explains, "It never occurred to us to leave." 
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time an artist has written about place as destiny. The 
late Emlyn Williams in his film, "Woman of Dolwyn," showed a Welsh shepherd 
who, rather than leave, chose to sit with his flock in the path of the oncoming 
torrent when his native village was wiped out by the construction of a dam. In 
"The Ik," British director Peter Brook introduced us to an East African tribe 
that put up with dehumanizing starvation rather than be moved to different 
ground, when the land around them was turned into a wildlife preserve and they 
could no longer hunt. 
</P>
<P>
Roots. Destiny. Paralysis. Humanity. The suggestion in all these works, 
including Nemeth's sparingly crafted 80-minute tone poem at South Coast, is 
that there is a deep imprinting by the land on its inhabitants; that there is 
an invisible DNA that links us to it and makes us what we are, for better or 
for worse. Any immigrant will tell you that there is a volume of truth in that, 
even when not moving is not a solution. 
</P>
<P>
Nemeth doesn't take on so grand a theme. She goes for the smaller picture to 
illustrate the large one. Her "Holy Days" presents four members of a farm 
family struggling to hang on. They are middle-aged Gant (Richard Doyle), his 
wife Rosie (Jeanne Paulsen), young Will (John K. Linton) and his pregnant wife 
Molly (Devon Raymond). The relationship between the couples is not entirely 
clear and it doesn't matter whether Will is a farmhand or Gant's cousin, nephew 
or in-law. The overriding bond -- and Nemeth knows this at some fundamental 
level -- is the ruined land that the men work together. 
</P>
<P>
This is "The Grapes of Wrath" in reverse. There is not much plot. What there 
is, is simple and stirring. It consists of one decision. Gant finds out that he 
can get work through the Works Progress Administration on a bridge-building 
crew some distance away and decides to do it. To feed the rest of them. Rosie, 
a woman traumatized by other events in her life, hates the idea. End of story. 
</P>
<P>
It is not the action that counts, but the chiseled characters. Nemeth is a 
miniaturist. So, in this instance, is director Martin Benson, who has served 
the play with emphasis on body language and without fear of its long, eloquent 
silences. The detailing is all. John Iacovelli's set is beige and worn -- 
everything covered with a fine layer of dust. Dust permeates the jeans and 
overalls worn by the men. Their faces are ashen. There is permanent dirt under 
their fingernails, permanent dust in Gant's hair. It sticks to his perspiration 
stained hat. When he pours water to drink, it is by the half-glass. Nothing to 
waste. 
</P>
<P>
The women's clothes are drab, but cleaner, down to their heavy wrinkled 
stockings (Ann Bruice designed the costumes). Each time anyone shakes out one 
of the cloths or kerchiefs that cover the kitchen table or their faces or 
heads, dust shakes out. The sense of desiccation is pervasive -- of land and 
lives dried out by wind and circumstance. 
</P>
<P>
Is there a play in this? There is. Amazingly. A majestic and gripping one, 
largely thanks to the care with which the production was assembled and cast. By 
not asking for pity or empathy, Paulsen ensures that we embrace Rosie's 
distanced, troubled soul, paralyzed in the midst of creeping disaster. Behind 
her frozen face, the pain is enormous. Doyle's Gant, a man of few words, makes 
each one count. You feel the alienated love and believe the torment between 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Will is a simpler fellow, but no simpleton. Played with un-self-conscious 
boyishness by Linton, he comes off as a good, if slightly scattered man. 
Raymond's bright and attractive Molly may be way ahead of him, but she'll never 
let her husband lag far behind. Of all the characters, Molly's is the most 
surprising, partly for that kind of patient generosity and partly because of 
her unfailing instinct for the simple phrase to express complex thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
It is Nemeth's instinct, of course, and it is everywhere in her play. There is 
beauty and wisdom in this little piece, directed by Benson with an equally 
stern and loving hand. Play and production are never indulgent, redundant or 
soft. The poetry is the authentic one of people who use language sparingly, as 
though words were slightly foreign objects to be weighed, measured and prized. 
"Holy Days" was done only once before in England in 1988. Welcome home.
