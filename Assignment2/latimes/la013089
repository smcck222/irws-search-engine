Jurors in the New York trial of Joel Steinberg, accused of killing his 
6-year-old adopted daughter, deliberated for a seventh day amid predictions of 
a manslaughter verdict. Acting Justice Harold Rothwax told the state Supreme 
Court jury not to weigh lesser charges unless it decided to acquit Steinberg of 
second-degree murder, and the jury sought repeated instructions on a 
manslaughter verdict. The panel sent out a note indicating it was unable to 
find that Steinberg intended serious injury to Lisa Steinberg, who slipped into 
a coma and died after he allegedly punched her in the head. The jury also asked 
to hear again testimony from Hedda Nussbaum, Steinberg's former live-in lover, 
who gave the most damaging testimony against him.

NEWSMAKERS: TROTSKY'S BANISHED GRANDSON OUTLIVES STALIN'S CURSE

 -- Esteban Volkow Bronstein, better known as Leon Trotsky's grandson, waited 
57 years to meet his half-sister, Alexandra Zaharnovna, although he never knew 
if she were alive or dead. Volkow, 62, who lives in Mexico City, was unaware of 
Alexandra's whereabouts until he received a telephone call from French 
historian Pierre Broue, who told Volkow that Alexandra, 65, was living in 
Moscow. "When Stalin expelled my mother (in 1931)," Volkow said, "he allowed 
her to take only her youngest child." Volkow was brought to Mexico City and 
lived there with his exiled grandfather until his assassination in 1940 -- 
believed to be the work of Josef Stalin, who had accused Trotsky of subversion 
in the 1920s. Alexandra spent six months in jail and five years in internal 
exile. Volkow described his Moscow meeting with Alexandra, who is ill with 
cancer, as well as his thoughts about the Soviet Union in an interview with 
Associated Press. "The truth is that the country is really alien to me," he 
said. "I left so young I have practically no memories, no memories. Maybe just 
the beginning of winter, the cold."

 -- Maybe Euripides could write a better drama, but for now, modern-day Greeks 
will have to settle for l'affaire Papandreou -- as in Greek Prime Minister 
Andreas Papandreou, 69, and his affaire de coeur with Dimitra Liani, 34, an 
airline flight attendant. Papandreou moved in with Liani in September after 
having heart surgery, but one of the conflicting lines of the story, which is 
being played out like a TV soap opera, comes from his wife, Margaret, who says 
Papandreou has refused to meet with her to discuss divorce by mutual consent. 
She said: "I set no conditions for a divorce. The only thing that remains is a 
meeting with Andreas. For me, the divorce matter is closed." Papandreou also is 
eager to put personal problems behind him before national elections June 18.

 -- John Le Carre's next spy thriller, "The Russia House," is described -- a 
bit mysteriously -- by his publisher as a book that is "a spy story and an 
anti-spy story, a story of Cold Warriors who continue to dance in their gray 
cellars after the music has ended." Le Carre's "Smiley's People" and "The Spy 
Who Came In From the Cold" were, of course, set in an era before anyone had 
heard of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, let alone glasnost or 
perestroika. So, the Sunday Telegraph in London posed this intriguing question: 
"If the creator of (British spy catcher George) Smiley and of Karla, the Soviet 
spymaster, has had to come in from the Cold War, what front will he fight on?" 
In June, Le Carre fans will find out. JAMES MARNELL

Tornadoes accompanied by marble-sized hail blew roofs off houses in South Texas 
and heavy rains flooded streets knee-deep in some towns, but no injuries were 
reported. The National Weather Service said parts of southeast and 
south-central Texas got as much as 3 inches of rain, and the Gulf Coast town of 
Palacios got 2.8 inches within six hours. More than an inch of rain fell in 
Houston, and flooding was reported in Bay City, 65 miles to the southwest. 
Showers also doused portions of Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee and Kentucky, 
and there was scattered rain and drizzle over the southern parts of the Great 
Lakes and Missouri.

FORMER CAUSE CELEBRE BEN SASWAY TURNING HIS ENERGY INWARD

PALOMAR MOUNTAIN 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As he makes another pot of coffee and stirs embers in the fireplace, Ben Sasway 
watches a thick mist creep over Palomar Mountain. A serious storm is moving in. 
No chance he'll be able to work on restoring his family's cabin in the middle 
of a freezing rain. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe he'll try reading "Moby Dick" again. But, after 10 pages, Sasway found 
Herman Melville's classic to be "incredibly self-indulgent." He could "veg-out" 
in front of the television for a while. But he's been doing that a lot lately. 
He can't play backgammon, because no one else is around on this mountaintop 
where he has taken refuge the past few months. In the old days, a hundred 
supporters could have kept him company. But he's looking for something 
different. 
</P>
<P>
"Welcome to limbo," he says wryly. 
</P>
<P>
For an instant, he seems to be talking about the rainy day. But it's more than 
that. He's talking about his life. 
</P>
<P>
Three and a half years ago, Benjamin Sasway, the first American since the 
Vietnam War to be indicted and imprisoned for failing to register for the 
draft, walked out of the U. S. Penitentiary at Lompoc, near Santa Barbara, and 
"went screaming off into the night." He wanted no more of press conferences, 
court appearances or prison sentences. He had taken a stand and paid the price: 
six months in jail for refusing to register for the draft. 
</P>
<P>
But there is no way of recovering the years, or of knowing how his life might 
have turned out had he not taken a stand that began in January, 1980, when 
President Jimmy Carter, reacting to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, 
proposed reinstituting the military draft for 19- and 20-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Recalls News of the Draft 
</P>
<P>
"I was standing in another guy's dorm room at Humboldt State when I heard about 
it," Sasway said. "From that moment, I knew it was something I would never do. 
I think I made a quip like 'Screw it, I'm not going to do it.' And the guy 
said, 'Hey, you can go to jail for that.' " 
</P>
<P>
Sasway told his parents, who live in Vista, that he was not going to register, 
and said they tried hard to talk him out of his revolt. When they realized his 
mind was made up, he said they became supportive, and, instead of registering 
before the July 24, 1980, cutoff date, the 19-year-old college freshman sat 
down and wrote a four-page letter to the President. 
</P>
<P>
In it, Sasway said that "the spirit of this mandate, like actual conscription, 
is immoral and incompatible with a truly free society. . . . I feel compelled 
by my conscience to state honestly and openly that I am not registering for the 
draft." 
</P>
<P>
During the next five years, Sasway got the 15 minutes of celebrity status that 
Andy Warhol promised everyone -- and a lot more. During the summer of 1982, his 
boyish face accompanied stories in magazines and newspapers across the country. 
His public comments about the registration were relayed to the nation in 
20-second sound bites on the network news. He found himself being praised and 
excoriated, but not ignored. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Will Not Be a Tool' 
</P>
<P>
"I will not be a tool of the American military misdirection that involved us in 
Vietnam 15 years ago and that might see our involvement in El Salvador or 
Nicaragua today," Sasway told reporters on June 29, 1982, when the U. S. 
attorney's office informed him of his pending indictment. He faced a maximum of 
five years in prison and a $10,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't especially want to be a martyr," he said. "But I also feel the 
obligation to perform the dictates of my conscience. If that means going to 
jail or suffering ill consequences, I have to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Jail is what it meant. In August, 1982, after a three-day trial, Sasway was 
convicted of the felony of not registering for the draft and sentenced to 30 
months in prison. There were three years of appeals -- Sasway's attorney, 
Charles T. Bumer, said Sasway was being selectively prosecuted since about 
650,000 others had failed to register -- but neither the U. S. 9th Circuit 
Court of Appeals nor the U. S. Supreme Court would hear the case. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Off to Prison in 1985 
</P>
<P>
In April, 1985, Sasway kissed his girlfriend and his parents goodby, put his 
furniture in storage and checked into the Metropolitan Correctional Center in 
San Diego for his processing to Lompoc. 
</P>
<P>
Up to that moment, Sasway had been caught up in his cause and in the attention 
that it brought. A few nights before he went to jail, his college friends threw 
him a going-away party, at which they made a macabre prison joke by presenting 
him with a bar of soap attached to a rope. Despite the attempts to keep the 
evening light, Sasway managed one last speech as a free man. 
</P>
<P>
"I have cause to celebrate because I have lived my life in accordance with my 
conscience," he told his friends dramatically. "I have not allowed external 
forces to crush who I am." 
</P>
<P>
Sasway's notoriety followed him into Lompoc, where his decision to go to jail 
as an act of conscience was regarded by some fellow inmates as a form of 
lunacy. In prison, he said, he worked as a secretary in the business office and 
a as clerk in the prison commissary, and pitched hay on the cattle farm. 
</P>
<P>
When he got out in 1985, having served six months of his 30-month sentence, 
Sasway returned to Humboldt State, where he had been majoring in philosophy, 
political science and journalism. For three years, he took classes at Humboldt 
and worked construction jobs in the Northern California coastal community of 
Arcata. Then he decided to come home and start over. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't see anything happening for me up there," he said. "How's that for a 
hip and groovy way of putting it?" 
</P>
<P>
Sasway said he moved in October to his parents' cabin on Palomar Mountain, 
thinking it would be a good way to begin easing back into life. 
</P>
<P>
"My big goal for the next two months is to open up a bank account," he said. 
"And it would be nice if I could enter my 'working stiff' phase of life with 
some degree of deliberateness, because it really is a central part of who I 
am." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Time Has Taken Its Toll 
</P>
<P>
This is not the 21-year-old who asked, "What could be a more important ethical 
decision than to decide to kill or not to kill?" 
</P>
<P>
The face that plastered the front pages seven years ago has become sharply 
angular. He's thinner. He favors jeans and T-shirts over the shirt and tie he 
wore during his trial. His hair, once short and parted neatly down the middle, 
is cropped like a rock star's, spiky on top, shoulder-length and curly in back. 
</P>
<P>
Sasway still wears his liberal heart on his sleeve, arguing as adamantly as 
ever for peace, a clean environment and human rights. But his words are 
punctuated with a sarcasm that was not there seven years ago. He swears more 
often. There is a hint of bitterness, of abandonment. The friends and political 
supporters who rallied around him in 1980 are somewhere else in 1989, and media 
darlings have come and gone. 
</P>
<P>
After he was released from prison, Sasway shunned the limelight he once 
enjoyed. Before his trial, he appeared on every talk show, from "Phil Donahue" 
to "Today." He held press conferences to announce each new development in his 
case. He accepted every interview request. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked it all the way through because people were listening to me. When a 
person's mouth moves as much as mine does, it's easy to get the impression that 
people are bored. All of a sudden, people were interested for 15 minutes. It's 
exciting that I was involved with a whole bunch of people coming together on 
this particular issue, yelling and screaming and demanding that their world 
make sense. It was exciting having people appreciate me. But, at the same time, 
every step of the way it was profoundly destabilizing." 
</P>
<P>
During the past three years he's avoided interviews, appearing only once on a 
radio talk show about five months after leaving Lompoc. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't really very becoming because I was incredibly glib," he said. "I had 
gotten really tired of being so idealistic and so serious, and talking so much. 
It was all so banal. So banal." 
</P>
<P>
The energy Sasway once used to fight the outside world has been turned inward. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't mean to be vain, but I was a pretty big story for a while. I was 
prepared to deal with jail, I was prepared to make my big stand. But over a 
period of time I started to get the feeling everybody was judging me. . . . I 
started to lose track of where I was in all of it. And that's something you 
just can't prepare for . . . . " 
</P>
<P>
As he looks back now, from the vantage point of being 28 years old, Sasway 
questions whether his convictions or his character were involved in his 
decision to speak out against the draft. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it was just stubbornness -- 19-year-olds are stubborn, 19-year-olds are 
idealistic, 19-year-olds think they wrote the book on truth. They may not be 
virtuous. They may just be stubborn." 
</P>
<P>
Jail is over. College has gone on too long. It's time to get on with it. He 
needs to get off the mountain. But that's something Sasway said he has never 
been good at, chastising himself for having no self-discipline. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people get a lot more done than I do. They're a lot more productive 
than I am. So I'm not convinced I'm doing myself or anybody any good this way, 
philosophizing all the time," he said. "They're out there doing stuff while I'm 
flapping my lips." 
</P>
<P>
Sasway's girlfriend of eight years, Laurel Linstedt, works at a children's camp 
near the San Francisco Bay Area. They've got a lot of history. She stood by him 
through his indictment, his trial, his prison stint, his return to the real 
world. But Sasway hasn't decided what to do about this part of his life, 
either. They separated nine months ago, but he says it's not over. 
</P>
<P>
Sasway admires his father, Joe, for taking a practical approach to life. 
Although Sasway said he has spent his 20s entertaining "life's big questions," 
his father, during the same period of his own life, got a job as a teacher and 
began raising a family, even though he wasn't sure it was what he wanted to do. 
</P>
<P>
"My father was the last generation that looked at work as drudgery that you 
just did," Sasway said. And, although his father accepts that Sasway and his 
peers entertain the big questions, he tells his son "you're going to be a tough 
bunch to make happy." 
</P>
<P>
Knowing that, has Sasway decided what he wants to do with his life? 
</P>
<P>
The answer comes wrapped in flippancy. The wall of the cabin needs insulating, 
he said. He's looking for compelling, engaging work in the area. Probably 
temporary, but incredibly lucrative. Really, he doesn't have any serious plans. 
If he can't adjust to life in San Diego, he might move to Tennessee. He doesn't 
say why. 
</P>
<P>
He plans to stay on Palomar Mountain through February, but that's as far as his 
plans go. Welcome to limbo. 
</P>
<P>
On the wall of the family cabin, there's an old photo from Ben's crusading 
days. It's a simple black-and-white picture of a pile of signs left by 
supporters following a rally after his trial. 
</P>
<P>
"Free Ben," the signs say. 
</P>
<P>
"I went through my rebellious, idealistic, rowdy phase, and now I'm interested 
in settling down and having a fairly quiet life," he said. Then, reaching back 
for a little of the fire of 1982, he goes on. "Continuing to make a difference, 
continuing to hold strong values, but focusing on domestic issues, like earning 
a living, tiling a kitchen, that type of thing. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe the reason I take refuge in that theory is that tiling the kitchen and 
earning a living are good and appropriate as long as they are done in love. You 
don't always need to be on the radical edge of social movement to make a 
difference."

Neighbors of Watts celebrates its 20th anniversary -- and is putting on a show 
with a crowd of a dozen show-stopping stars. 
</P>
<P>
The wonderful Joe Williams, writer Maya Angelou, the Ray Brown Trio, "Hollywood 
Shuffle," Robert Townsend and Marilyn McCoo and Billy Davis Jr. are just some 
of the stars who will be up on stage Saturday at the Santa Monica Civic. All 
the proceeds go to the South Central Community Child Care Centers and other 
Neighbors of Watts projects. 
</P>
<P>
Started by Dixie Jewison, Dawn Wolper and Suzanne Turman, Neighbors of Watts 
brought together women from the entertainment community to assist a struggling 
organization, the Mothers of Watts. Now the Harriette Evans Shields and Ella 
Fitzgerald centers provide comprehensive development programs for 96 children 
from low-income families. 
</P>
<P>
ROLLING ALONG -- Everybody loves the story of the little charity that could. 
Cuisine a Roulettes fits the bill -- and fits it now in an Ungaro gown. 
</P>
<P>
Cuisine a Roulettes is the fairly young support group for St. Vincent's 
Meals-on-Wheels -- and one of the two primary beneficiaries of the lavish 
annual Spago-inspired American Wine and Food Festival. But March 2, this crowd 
moves into fashion when co-chairs Debbie Lanni and Eva Elkins host an Ungaro 
fashion luncheon at the Ma Maison Sofitel. (How perfect and how perfectly 
French.) 
</P>
<P>
St. Vincent's Meals-on-Wheels serves 1,100 meals daily to housebound people in 
Los Angeles. Nelly LLanos is the president of the group that she, with Kathy 
Kilroy, founded just a couple of years back, a group that now has dozens of 
women members, and a few fellows, like Charles Elkins and Glen Holden. 
</P>
<P>
Winnie Schweitzer, a member of the group and owner of the Ungaro Boutique in 
Beverly Hills, has made sure that all proceeds from the lunch go to St. 
Vincent's Meals-on-Wheels. 
</P>
<P>
SUIT UP -- Of all the annual benefits coming around the track, nothing keeps up 
speed like the annual Jimmy Stewart Relay Marathon. This year it's on Sunday, 
April 5. To kick off the proceedings, Corwin and Nanci Denney host their annual 
star-crowded reception honoring Stewart and the perennial marathon chair, 
Robert (R. J.) Wagner. 
</P>
<P>
The celeb race committee includes Bob Hope, Charlton Heston, Bruce Jenner, 
Heather Locklear and Shirley Jones with hubby Marty Ingels. Of course Jimmy and 
R. J. are such swell fellows that this event annually turns out to have more 
famous people than photographers present (a rare occasion in Hollywood). 
</P>
<P>
MORE, MORE, MORE -- Concern Foundation for Cancer Research and Concern II 
present "A Very Special Evening With Stevie Wonder and Friends" on March 5 at 
the Universal Amphitheatre. . . . More stars, this time Lou Rawls, Debbie Allen 
and Loni Anderson, will be among those saluting Jose Feliciano on Feb. 11 at 
the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, where he receives the 1989 Humanitarian Award 
from the Women's Auxiliary of California Pediatric and Family Medical Center. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
The Golda Meir Club of Israel Bonds launches its Founders Circle with a 
luncheon Tuesday at the home of Barbara and Bill Belzberg -- a home that just 
happens to be the site of the club's first meeting a decade ago. Alice Peerce, 
the vice chairman of national Israel Bonds and widow of opera star Jan Peerce, 
will speak. . . . 
</P>
<P>
When Robinson's spring catalogue comes out, the inside cover will feature an 
untitled work by Sam Francis. The original work will be auctioned off this 
spring at an evening for art collectors, with the purchase price going to the 
Sam Francis Foundation for medical research on infectious and environmental 
diseases. Robinson's also hosts a Feb. 23 luncheon at its Santa Monica store -- 
this one benefiting KCET-TV. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Judge Joseph Wapner and his wife, Mickey, will be honored by Alternative Living 
for the Aging when they receive the Sheldon Andelson Award on Sunday at the 
Beverly Hills Hotel. Michele and Arlen Andelson, Susan and Tom Houston and 
Dorothy Corwin are among the co-chairs.

JACK SMITH: THE SEARCH FOR STORIES NEUTER AND NEUTRAL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A few months ago, Ruth Lerner of Pacific Palisades asked me to recommend 10 
works of American fiction for her son, who is sojourning in China. 
</P>
<P>
Because he was allowed only 44 pounds of luggage, he took only Chinese-English 
dictionaries, reference works and guidebooks. 
</P>
<P>
He asked his mother to send him one paperback American novel a month -- books 
that he could leave behind. He said he wanted the best in American fiction. 
There was one caveat: The books must not be highly sexual or political. Her son 
was afraid they might be confiscated. 
</P>
<P>
The reason I have been so long in responding to Mrs. Lerner is that I can't 
think of any good American novels that aren't loaded with sex and politics. 
What other subjects are there? 
</P>
<P>
My first thought was to recommend books that made me laugh. But most of them 
were full of sex. Nothing is funnier. 
</P>
<P>
For example, any list of 10 good American novels should include "Comfort Me 
With Apples" or any other book by Peter De Vries. That most of his sex scenes 
turn out disastrous doesn't make them any the less funny. 
</P>
<P>
I thought of recommending "For Whom the Bell Tolls," by Ernest Hemingway. Every 
young man ought to read Hemingway. But of course it is loaded with politics, 
and there's that scene where Robert Jordan and Maria make love in a sleeping 
bag. 
</P>
<P>
I thought of "Unknown Man No. 89," by Elmore Leonard. It's about two alcoholics 
who rehabilitate each other, fall in love, and skin a con man who is trying to 
skin her. No politics, but some very good sex. Out it goes. 
</P>
<P>
I wanted to recommend "The Girl in the Plain Brown Wrapper," or any other of 
John D. MacDonald's Travis McGee series; but McGee can't get through a book 
without bringing about the recovery of some sexually frustrated young woman by 
personal therapy, applied in bed. Much too sexy for China. 
</P>
<P>
"Gorky Park," by Martin Cruz Smith, is a gripper, but I'm afraid it won't do, 
either. It's about nothing else but sex and politics. The two seem to be 
related, in some sinister way. 
</P>
<P>
"Looking for Rachel Wallace," by Robert B. Parker, is an excellent novel, 
disguised as a private-eye yarn. It's full of gratifying dialogue between 
Spenser, the private eye, and Rachel Wallace, a lesbian-feminist advocate. But 
the subject matter is sexual politics, which I suppose would be a double whammy 
in China. 
</P>
<P>
He might get away with "The Big Sleep," by Raymond Chandler. There is a 
ding-a-ling female in it who tends to take her clothes off at unpropitious 
moments, but there is no explicit sex. Chandler had a guilt complex about sex. 
Consequently, his hero, Philip Marlow, almost never gets into bed with the 
numerous femmes fatales in Chandler's novels. The politics is strictly local -- 
mostly about corrupt cops. 
</P>
<P>
If he hasn't read it already, I think the young man ought to read "The New 
Centurions," or anything else by Joseph Wambaugh; but, alas, Wambaugh's books 
reek of kinky sex, and degeneracy of other kinds. Not for any nation that 
doesn't want its people to know what its problems are. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Lerner asked her son about Mark Twain, and he told her he had already read 
"Tom Sawyer" and "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn." Well, that leaves "A 
Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court," which I thought was hilarious when 
I read it at the age of 12. On the other hand, there is a lot of subtle 
political satire in "Connecticut Yankee," although, as I remember, it is free 
of explicit sex. 
</P>
<P>
It seems to me that Mrs. Lerner's son has laid down restrictions that eliminate 
almost every good book. I really don't know of a good adult novel that isn't 
concerned with politics or sex, and usually both. 
</P>
<P>
I thought of recommending "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz," by L. Frank Baum, which 
is thought of as a children's classic. But few books are as loaded with sexual 
frustrations as "Wizard." We have a cowardly lion, a tin man and a scarecrow, 
all symbols of the sexually-dysfunctional male. All, obviously, are pedophiles 
in love with the adolescent heroine. Hollywood has exploited few more depraved 
themes than "The Wizard of Oz." 
</P>
<P>
In good conscience, I'm afraid I can recommend only the Horatio Alger books and 
the Rover Boys.

Texas Noon by Leonard Sanders (Delacorte Press: $18.95; 452 pages). 
</P>
<P>
In this coming symphony of mixed metaphors, it might be logically argued that 
there are absolutely no bad books -- not even any "average" books; that every 
novel is like a plain little secretary with glasses, typing away in obscurity, 
and that all it takes is the love of a good reader to turn those horn rims into 
bright-blue contact lenses, to pull the wispy, untended hair out of its 
school-teacherly bun, and fluff it up into a movie-star perm. Perhaps it's the 
other way around: No book can be "good" until a reader falls in love with it. 
</P>
<P>
As in any dating situation, the trick is for reader and book to get on the same 
wavelength. I hope that Leonard Sanders won't take it amiss when I say it might 
be best if you read "Texas Noon" in a slightly weakened condition, when you're 
only running at about 80% -- when your objections about whether or not this 
work could be construed as "original material," or why these characters change 
their personalities at the drop of a chapter heading might be considerably 
muted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Novelistic Dance Hall 
</P>
<P>
Read this book when all your petty caveats are put to rest by some pesky virus 
that has got you flat on your back and you don't want anything to be original: 
You just want to be waltzed around the novelistic dance hall by some burly bozo 
who at least knows what he wants to do, and you follow wimpily along, because 
it's 3 in the afternoon, the sun is out, your nose is running and there's 
nothing else to do but be led through the paces of this plot. 
</P>
<P>
"Texas Noon" makes a virtue of cliche. We've got an independent oil company in 
these pages! The characters -- all in one tempestuous family -- live in Ft. 
Worth. (Leonard Sanders is so ingenuous about all of this! You'd think he'd 
never even lived in the United States of America, where, for the last decade, 
two of our most popular television series have been David Jacob's "Dallas" 
where a tempestuous family lives just a stone's throw from Ft. Worth, and 
"Dynasty," where yet another tempestuous family struggles to wrest power from 
each other's independent oil company. Sanders even presents a character named 
Crystelle, though the spelling of her name and her disposition differ greatly 
from Krystle in Richard and Esther Shapiro's own decadent media confection.) 
</P>
<P>
"The simple things are the best," some people say. Sanders keeps "Texas Noon" 
simple. Joanna Spurlock has just inherited Spurlock Oil. Because her husband, 
Brod (who murdered somebody in Volume 1) has died. Joanna -- in the 1950s -- 
takes over Spurlock Oil. Can she do it? Yes, because she learns to pretend to 
defer to her male staff, and though those guys are so stupid she has them 
believing they're making the decisions. Joanna has two sons. (Well, the plot is 
tried and true -- all the way back to Jenesis. If something works, why fix it?) 
Her older son, Weldon, is brash and money-grubbing. Her younger son, Kelly, is 
quiet and disturbed. Weldon gets in a scrape and is sent off to military 
school. Kelly joins the Texas Boys Choir getting culture and a backbone. 
Crystelle comes back to Ft. Worth with evidence that Brod, her brother, killed 
that man back in Volume 1. Consternation! 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Who Will Wrest Control? 
</P>
<P>
Will the evil Crystelle be able to wrest control of Spurlock Oil from the 
virtuous and hard-working Joanna? What do you think, gentle reader? And when 
Weldon comes home as a brash and money-grubbing grown-up and teams up with the 
scholarly but still lonely Kelly, what do you think will happen then? Will they 
wrest control from Joanna? If so, at what cost? 
</P>
<P>
"Texas Noon" is less an adventure than a soft old song -- something like "Red 
River Valley" or "My Old Kentucky Home." Read it in the afternoon, keep your 
cough syrup beside you. Watch the patterns that the leaves on the trees outside 
your window make on the pages of your book. Let Sanders waltz you around the 
floor until you feel better -- tunelessly crooning plot turns in your ear in 
such a soothing tone that in his voice, a grisly murder seems as calm and 
orderly as a hand-hooked throw rug. (Just don't read "Texas Noon" when you're 
feeling chipper, critical and generally on top of things. That would be an 
injustice, both to the author -- and to you.)

The competition for Los Angeles' morning radio audience could soon turn into an 
all-out war with the move here from New York of Scott Shannon, creator of the 
"Morning Zoo" concept of slap-happy hip talk on morning rock radio. He'll be 
taking over the morning show on KIQQ-FM. That will put him head to head in the 
mornings against KIIS-FM's long-time ratings champ Rick Dees and his close 
runner-up, KPWR-FM's Jay Thomas. In addition, Shannon has been named vice 
president for programming of Westwood One Radio Station Group. ALEENE MacMINN

And speaking of the market for Dali art: A federal grand jury indicted a 
Honolulu-based chain of art galleries and its two top officials on fraud 
charges, claiming the gallery sold fake Salvador Dali artworks during the past 
12 years. The indictment last week charged Center Art Galleries-Hawaii owner 
William Mett, 46, of Kailua, and vice president Marvin Wiseman, 44, of Waikiki, 
with 93 counts of mail, wire and securities fraud in Dali sales to 36 
customers. Assistant U.S. Attorney Les Osborne said Mett and Wiseman have 
agreed to surrender at their arraignment, probably this week. In a written 
statement Thursday, Mett said he was innocent. ALEENE MacMINN

The first Salvador Dali work to be sold in Spain since his death last week 
brought $131,000 -- about three times the catalogue price. The work was a 1948 
gouache study of costumes for a production of Shakespeare's "As You Like It." 
The buyer represented a private collector. A spokeswoman for Sotheby's auction 
house said the surrealist painter's death had influenced interest in his work, 
but added it was too early to say if prices would rise. "The market will be 
more influenced by the contents of his will -- if, for example, the bulk has 
been left to public institutions, then there would be a limited number of 
paintings on the market." Dali died in his hometown of Figueras at the age of 
84 after an attack of pneumonia. His will is due to be opened in about two 
weeks. ALEENE MacMINN

KABC-TV Channel 7 will launch a half-hour early morning newscast in the next 
few months, says news director Roger Bell. Whether it will begin at 6 or 6:30 
a.m. is yet to be worked out with the parent network. Channel 7 currently 
carries the hourlong ABC network newscast, "News This Morning," from 6-7 a.m., 
then goes into the two-hour "Good Morning America." KABC reporter Gene Gleasen 
will anchor the new broadcast, with the co-anchor and the premiere date still 
to be determined. Of the three local network affiliate stations, only Channel 4 
now has a locally-produced early-morning newscast (at 6:30 a.m.). ALEENE

POP CAPSULES : BACK-YARD PARTY ROCK FROM AMBEL AND GANG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Toward the end of his show at the Palomino on Friday, Eric Ambel asked if 
anyone knew of a barbecue he could play at Sunday. In some ways, the casual, 
spirited rock 'n' roll provided by Ambel and his band, Roscoe's Gang, might 
have been more suited to a back-yard party than the sparsely populated North 
Hollywood club. But Ambel's genuine enthusiasm proved enough for any setting. 
</P>
<P>
Even if all Ambel (taking a break from his duties as the lead guitarist for New 
York's Del-Lords) had done was play Swamp Dogg's buried treasure "Total 
Destruction of Your Mind" -- the highlight of his recent "Roscoe's Gang" album 
-- he would deserve to be carried to the barbecue of his choice in a sedan 
chair. With drummer Ron (Wrongo) Gremp's trash-can whomp serving as the 
heartbeat, the rarely heard song sounded like an outtake from "Beggar's 
Banquet." 
</P>
<P>
That heartbeat carried the gang -- which included singer Syd Straw and 
harmonicat Jimmy Powers -- through a rambunctious mix of obscure outside 
material, several Del-Lords selections and a handful of spunky originals. A 
reminder that rock played just for fun is every bit as meaningful as rock 
played for more "high-minded" purposes. STEVE HOCHMAN

POP CAPSULES : GLIB SHOWMAN ROGERS: CROSSOVER AND CLIP-ONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What with new traditionalists such as Randy Travis and Dwight Yoakam claiming 
the recent country charts and awards, it has been said that the time has passed 
for Kenny Rogers and his watered-down ilk. That word clearly hadn't filtered 
down Saturday to Anaheim's Celebrity Theatre, where the first of Rogers' five 
sold-out weekend shows was accepted with polite rapture by his fans. 
</P>
<P>
Everything that critics revile in him was on display: the most torpid voice 
this side of Raymond Burr; the innocuous "crossover" material; the glib showman 
who, despite any number of aw-shucks digressions, manages to end the show 
exactly within the 65-minute production schedule. 
</P>
<P>
But, that said, Rogers isn't at all an unpleasant person to spend an hour with. 
Several of his many audience interactions showed a self-deprecating wit and 
spontaneity (a handy thing when dealing with fans who hand him clip-on ties or 
scrutinize him with binoculars from the third row). He also managed to fit in 
16 songs, with his worn voice doing credible service even to warhorses like 
"Lady." 
</P>
<P>
Though opener Kathy Mattea's performance was hampered by its brevity and a 
stilted stage set-up, she gave charged performances to "Goin' Gone" and 
"Eighteen Wheels and a Dozen Roses," a truck-stop jukebox standard if ever 
there were one. JIM WASHBURN

POP CAPSULES : AN INEFFECTIVE SET FROM ROBERT CRAY BAND AT UNIVERSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SNOWDEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Between being announced at the Universal Amphitheatre Saturday as America's 
premier R&amp;B band and utilizing the Memphis Horns, the Robert Cray Band left 
plenty of clues that its music owes as much to Southern soul as to straight 
blues. But the problems during the quintet's uneven two-hour performance went 
beyond definitions of musical style or the six (!) broken guitar strings that 
Cray suffered during the set. 
</P>
<P>
Cray's effectiveness depends on waging a subtle kind of guerrilla war on 
blues/soul conventions, in everything from song structure and lyric themes to 
his spiky, rhythmically unpredictable solos and expressive singing. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that in a large hall like the Amphitheatre, Cray needs strong 
material in which all those elements click, because there's no musical flash or 
visual dazzle to fall back on. His up-tempo songs hardly qualify as 
barn-burners, and the moody medium tempo and lack of punch Saturday became 
enervating. Every song seemed to take the set back to square one. 
</P>
<P>
The terse punctuations of the Memphis Horns added snap and color to the 
quintet's Spartan sound. But, during the second hour, only brief, unexpected 
interludes -- Cray's throat-lacerating gospel growls on one number, a Delta 
blues duel with guitarist Tim Kaihatsu on another -- and his breakthrough hit 
"Smoking Gun" sustained interest. DON SNOWDEN

TCHAIKOVSKY PROGRAM AT PASADENA CIVIC AUDITORIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HETTMANSBERGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On Saturday night, Rostropovich led the National Symphony in a Tchaikovsky 
program at Pasadena Civic Auditorium. On balance, the results gratified the 
thinking listener, without sacrificing any of the requisite passion and 
sentiment one expects in this music. 
</P>
<P>
Revealing a deliberate and thoughtful reading of the Piano Concerto No. 1, 
Alexander Toradze displayed a wide range of articulation and tone quality: 
powerful and bright in the opening movement, limpid in the second and fiery in 
the Allegro con fuoco finale. Negotiating even the most treacherous octave runs 
with rarely a blur, Toradze's technical command affords him the luxury of 
de-emphasizing the purely virtuosic aspects of the work in favor of artistic 
considerations. 
</P>
<P>
Rostropovich's conducting of the Fifth Symphony continued along a similar 
interpretive path. Only in the Andante cantabile did the director lean toward a 
more heart-on-sleeve approach. But in the outer movements the tempos and 
transitions were persuasively gauged, while the third movement Waltz possessed 
a soothing lilt. Throughout the work the combination of expert playing from the 
first-chair members, and a collective sound that never turned strident even in 
the largest climaxes, was alluring. 
</P>
<P>
The evening began with an appropriately virile reading of the "Coronation 
March" (1883), and concluded with two encores: a sassily played "Promenade" by 
Gershwin, and a vibrant and explosive Overture to "Russlan and Ludmilla" by 
Glinka. GREG HETTMANSBERGER

Nine people were killed in an explosion and fire at a house in the western town 
of Bodrum, the Anatolian News Agency said Sunday. The Saturday night explosion 
killed one man standing outside the house. Flames then engulfed the building, 
killing all eight members of a family inside, the agency said. It added that 
the explosion may have been caused by a gas leak.

The government said Sunday that it will seek to reassure the United States that 
its controversial nuclear program is peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry spokesman, quoted by the official APP news agency, said, 
"Pakistan never tried to manufacture a nuclear bomb, nor would it ever do so in 
the future." 
</P>
<P>
The statement followed American newspaper reports that U.S. aid to Pakistan 
might be cut off because Washington may no longer be able to certify that 
Pakistan does not possess a nuclear bomb. 
</P>
<P>
Without such certification, required annually by law, Pakistan would not be 
eligible to receive U.S. economic and military aid beyond the financial year 
ending on Sept. 30.

were temporarily displaced residents of a retirement complex that is being 
renovated.

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: A WHITE ELEPHANT AT MISSION BEACH? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city bureaucrat charged with its care and tending calls it "an ideal 
location in an ideal city." 
</P>
<P>
The description may not be far off: 18 acres of publicly owned property right 
on the ocean, just a wave away from wide and sandy South Mission Beach. For 
decades it was home to the Belmont Park amusement center, crowned by the Giant 
Dipper roller coaster and the Plunge swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1950s, the park went to pot. In the mid-1980s, the San Diego City 
Council tried to reverse the neglect by marrying up with politically connected 
developers who promised a trendy little shopping complex. The deal went bad, 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors wanted a tree-lined park and branded the project a monstrosity; 
Councilman Mike Gotch decided not to risk their wrath in a reelection campaign. 
Activists got a measure on the ballot, but it was too late to stop the 
bulldozers. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego County Grand Jury scorched the council for signing a sweetheart 
deal and forfeiting its duty to protect the public interest. 
</P>
<P>
Through it all, boosters maintained that the $18-million complex would be a 
boon to the city, both financially and in rescuing the site from transients. 
But the numbers from the first seven months of operation are now in, and they 
are proving more unsettling at City Hall than an 8.0 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Whereas the developers projected the complex would do $19 million in gross 
receipts, the actual figure is closer to $1.7 million. Visions have begun to 
arise of a beachfront white elephant: vacancy signs, turnover, squabbles among 
tenants (a lawsuit has been discussed), an agonizing civic reminder of what the 
site could have become. 
</P>
<P>
Only 38% of the space is occupied, although that will increase if two 
restaurants make good on their plans to move in. If they do, the current 
owner-operator, a wholly owned subsidiary of San Diego Gas &amp; Electric, may 
not be there to see it. 
</P>
<P>
The subsidiary, Pacific Diversified Capital, is negotiating to sell out to an 
unnamed interest, subject to city approval. It is also selling a Kearny Mesa 
office building, fueling speculation that SDG&amp;E is unloading its San Diego 
commitments before merging with Southern California Edison. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Korpan, president of Pacific Diversified, which bought the buildings and 
lease from the original developers, says that isn't so. He says the prospective 
buyer approached him, not vice versa. He says the complex can be successful, 
particularly if the coaster returns. 
</P>
<P>
Don Barone, lease supervisor with the city's property department, is similarly 
convinced, particularly if the new operator is more experienced and aggressive. 
Still, concern is mounting on the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The council last week discussed the sad situation in closed session with the 
city attorney; more discussions will follow. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Move Over, Babe 
</P>
<P>
In the beginning, there were the Baseball Hall of Fame and the Pro Football 
Hall of Fame. Then there was the Hall of Fame for Great Americans in the Bronx, 
the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame, the Science Fiction Hall of Fame (no, there is 
not a Godzilla wing), the Crossword Hall of Fame, the Building Industry Hall of 
Fame (great hammers of the past), the Polka Hall of Fame (not to be confused 
with the Cleveland-Style Polka Hall of Fame) and even the Hall of Flame 
(innovations in fire equipment). 
</P>
<P>
And now: the Attache Hall of Fame, run by the Defense Intelligence Agency in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Sam Frankel, a retired Navy rear admiral living in Rancho Bernardo, has just 
been inducted into the Attache Hall of Fame for his service as a Naval attache 
to both the Soviet Union and mainland China. He joins Pershing, Stilwell and 
Halsey as charter inductees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Smart Angle 
</P>
<P>
Why does a bail-bond company in downtown San Diego have its business signs 
lying nearly flat on its roof? The signs, in English and Spanish, cannot be 
seen from the street. 
</P>
<P>
But a good advertiser knows its audience: Those with the best view are the 
prisoners peering down from the skinny windows of the 12-story Metropolitan 
Correctional Center.

Your editorial cites every bad thing about Roe vs. Wade, then proceeds to 
support it. In essence, it says, Roe vs. Wade is based on outdated medical 
knowledge, finds questionable basis in the Constitution, established a "right" 
where none is enumerated, but hey, we've gotten used to it so let's not rock 
the boat. 
</P>
<P>
Bad law is bad law. Human life is not so trifling an issue that we can get by 
with mediocre legislation "protecting" it.

ROOSEVELT

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Today marks the birthday of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, a man who is 
remembered for many things but for me and hundreds like me, who were given an 
early death sentence due to poliomyelitis and other childhood diseases, it is a 
day of saying a prayer of thanks to this man who gave us the will to "hang in 
there" when all others had given up on us. 
</P>
<P>
I was told when I was 16 that I would not live beyond my 19th birthday. I am 
middle-aged now, still in pain but working every day thanks to the efforts of 
FDR's Warm Springs Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Most young people today have no idea why his likeness is on the dime. Long 
before the March of Dimes came into being it was FDR who built the little 
hospital in Warm Springs, Ga. (mortgaging his own home at Hyde Park, N.Y., to 
do so) so children afflicted with polio might recover. 
</P>
<P>
I remember that day in 1944 when he spoke to me and said, "You must make 
friends with the pain . . . set a goal for the future and go after it." That is 
why Jan. 30 is so special to me.

TRAFFIC CAMERA

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The automatic camera being tested by the city of Pasadena, as well as its photo 
radar, would be considerably less useful if traffic lights were properly 
synchronized. I believe that the principal attraction of these devices is their 
revenue-generating potential. The problem for us drivers is that the city gets 
more return on its "investment" by not synchronizing the lights.

STANDING FIRM ON MEDICARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Key congressional leaders have rejected calls to rewrite the Medicare-expansion 
law that came into effect Jan. 1, and we think that they are right. 
</P>
<P>
Many Medicare beneficiaries are objecting to the fact that the additional 
services, including expanded acute care in hospitals and coverage for 
prescription drugs, will be financed by the beneficiaries themselves through an 
income-tax surcharge on those with higher incomes. At a time when the nation is 
rapidly graying, there is no equitable alternative. The shrinking work force 
can hardly be expected to subsidize these expanded services for the growing 
population of older Americans. Furthermore, the benefits are a bargain. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.), chairman of the Finance Committee, and Rep. Dan 
Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, are standing 
firm behind the new law.So they should. To reject this reform would be to doom 
other essential expansions of service, including long-term-care insurance, that 
can be developed by Congress only if at least some of the cost is borne 
directly by the beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
A majority of Medicare beneficiaries will pay only a basic monthly fee for the 
added protections -- $4 for the current year, rising to $10 in 1993. For the 
40% of the seniors with higher incomes, there is an additional income-tax 
surcharge -- 15% of tax liability for this year, rising to 28%, or a maximum of 
$1,050, in 1993. Congressional estimates underscore the fact that even at 
maximum fees these are bargains, representing a substantial subsidy. "An 
individual who pays the maximum supplemental premium of $1,050 in 1993 will 
still receive, on average, a subsidy of approximately $1,700," according to 
Rep. Pete Stark (D-Oakland), one of the authors of the legislation.

'ABORTION AND THE COURT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When The Times reported the President's telephone hookup with those gathered 
for the 16th annual March for Life ("Bush Calls for Reversal of '73 Abortion 
Ruling," Part I, Jan. 24), the real bombshell of the story was accorded a scant 
line's attention, buried in the 11th paragraph of a story which was buried on 
Page 19: " 'America needs a human life amendment,' the President said." 
</P>
<P>
A human life amendment?! This is news! To my knowledge, not once in his 
campaign for the presidency did Bush call for such an amendment. Yet on his 
first business day as President, Bush blithely proposes this startling 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
I want to hear more. What exactly is Bush proposing? And why didn't he inform 
the American people of this striking point of his agenda during the campaign? 
</P>
<P>
Avowing such a reactionary plan so early in his presidency -- without even a 
hint of his intention to do so during the campaign -- smacks of dishonesty.

<TEXT>
<P>
I was astonished by the content of an interview with Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh 
on Jan. 22 when he was asked why, when a majority of Americans support the 
right of women to terminate pregnancy, the government is recommending 
overturning Roe vs. Wade. He responded that ordinarily the government would be 
responsive to a majority, but this was "a matter of principle." 
</P>
<P>
Whose principle, pray? And what has become of government of the people, by the 
people? 
</P>
<P>
While most of us deplore abortion, the problem is not amenable to solution by 
repression. Let the government take a serious hand in the question of 
population control. We have the scientific know-how!

FAMILY FRIEND SOUGHT IN TEEN BEATING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"A friend of the family" is being sought for questioning in the brutal beating 
of a 13-year-old girl in Hillcrest last week, authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, Marcie Bradburn, was discovered about 10:30 a.m. Friday, 
unconscious and lying near the site of the abandoned Sears store at Cleveland 
and University avenues, police spokesman Bill Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
She apparently had been beaten with a baseball bat or other heavy instrument 
and then choked. The girl lived with her mother in an apartment in the 1400 
block of Morrow Way, less than two blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
A 27-year-old man whom the family had befriended was believed to be involved in 
the beating, Robinson said, but the spokesman stopped short of calling him a 
suspect. Police did not release the man's name or his description, but said 
they believe he is still in the San Diego area. 
</P>
<P>
Bradburn is hospitalized in critical condition with extremely serious head 
injuries, according to police. Her location is being withheld because the 
assailant remains at large.

CONFRONTING THE REAL LATIN CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM PFAFF, William Pfaff is a Los Angeles Times syndicated columnist 
based in Paris. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first problem Latin America presents to the Bush Administration is 
identification of the true problem. The Reagan Administration devoted itself to 
all the wrong problems, for which it paid a considerable price in U.S. 
credibility and international respect. Can George Bush's people do better? 
</P>
<P>
Ask the State Department specialists responsible for Latin America how they 
spent their time during the Reagan years. They will answer that 80% of their 
energy was devoted to Nicaragua and 20% to all the rest. Secretary of State 
James A. Baker III got examined mostly on Nicaragua, El Salvador and Cuba 
during his confirmation-hearing questioning on Latin America. Argentina, whose 
democratic government is under grave and growing challenge, was not a subject 
of notable interest. 
</P>
<P>
El Salvador, Nicaragua and Cuba have for months, even years, dominated press 
discussion of Latin America. A crisis currently is predicted for El Salvador, 
where a presidential election takes place in March, with poor prospects for the 
U.S.-backed Christian Democrats. The left-wing guerrilla movement is bidding 
for a truce and a role in the election. 
</P>
<P>
But is crisis in El Salvador necessarily a crisis for the United States? 
Washington worries about communists and death squads, matters of certain 
concern to the Salvadorans, who must live with the consequences of their 
electoral -- and extra-electoral -- choices. But El Salvador's problems are not 
the fundamental problems of Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
El Salvador's Marxism, like that of the Sandinistas next door in Nicaragua, 
represents an ideological dead end for Latin America -- just as Castroism does. 
Romantic middle-class Marxism is an outdated and increasingly irrelevant 
response to cultural and structural problems in Latin America. The 
ideologically unclassifiable, cult-like "Shining Path" in Peru is much more up 
to date and a great deal more sinister. So are the drug barons -- feeding, and 
fed by, North American drug addiction. 
</P>
<P>
Fundamentally, Latin America confronts the political consequences of its 
absolutist cultural inheritance, as well as an urgent economic crisis. The 
cultural issue is unresolvable as such, being the historical condition with 
which Latin Americans live. But it needs to be confronted nonetheless. The 
Latin American intellectual and religious tradition is absolutist, intolerant, 
unpragmatic -- a constant obstacle to compromise and political reforms. 
</P>
<P>
The imperialism that populated and culturally shaped Latin American society, 
destroying the Indian civilizations already there, was peculiarly 
uncompromising, motivated by the search for gold and a search for souls. Spain 
and Portugal, at the peak of their powers in the 16th Century, failed to make a 
creative adaptation to the modern world that followed. Their American colonies 
could do no better. The Enlightenment and the social revolutions of the 19th 
Century passed them by. They walled themselves off from modernity, reemerging 
only in the 1960s and '70s. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has refused to leave the region alone, even though unable to 
influence it to become something more congenial in Protestant and progressive 
North American eyes. Washington has really never known what it wanted of the 
Latin Americans. "I am going to teach the South American republics to elect 
good men," said Woodrow Wilson in 1914. But who would have been these "good 
men" in Wilson's eyes? 
</P>
<P>
Latin America's economic crisis follows in part from its inability to repay the 
debt enthusiastically pressed upon it during the 1970s, when American and West 
European banks needed to recycle the OPEC nations' windfall dollars. Virtually 
no one today contests that the debt is unrepayable, but the Western countries 
insist on a mechanism to disguise this fact and avoid such hard words as 
default and bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
The unrepayable loans are a problem for the banks that made the loans, 
certainly, and finding an adroit way to write off the money is important to the 
stability of the international banking system. But this is a frivolous problem 
compared to that faced by economically failing societies, which cannot borrow 
more because they cannot repay past loans, yet have to go on feeding people, 
investing to develop agriculture, investing to build the infrastructure that 
makes future development imaginable. What do they do? There is no Baker plan to 
solve their problems. 
</P>
<P>
In the West, the tendency has been to shrug these considerations off as, 
generally, the Third World's worry. Alternatively they are held to be problems 
so awful that nothing can be done about them. This might even work for Japan 
and the West Europeans, because they are real or virtual islands, cut off from 
the Third World. The United States is not so lucky in this respect, if luck is 
the word. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has an unshuttable land and sea border on Latin America. It 
simply can't treat Latin American economics as a private-sector problem. It 
can't treat Latin American politics as an ideological problem -- or a military 
one. If Latin America's problems are not dealt with in Latin America, on 
realistic terms, then Latin Americans are going to come to the United States 
looking for their solutions. The United States is the one rich nation in a 
position to have the poverty-stricken of the world beating down its doors, 
looking for answers.

LOYOLA GETS EVEN, BEATS PEPPERDINE, 99-86 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN DROOZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a game in which neatness didn't count, Loyola Marymount defeated Pepperdine, 
99-86, Sunday, riding the Waves back into a three-way, first-place tie in the 
West Coast Athletic Conference before a standing-room crowd of 4,350 in Gersten 
Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola used a 65-point second half and some timely free throws, notably Enoch 
Simmons' 14 straight in the second half, to improve to 11-7 overall and pull 
into a conference tie with Pepperdine and St. Mary's at 5-1. Pepperdine is 13-8 
overall. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola's perseverance helped overcome some uncharacteristic poor shooting, 
especially by 3-point specialist Jeff Fryer. The Lions made only 4 of 25 shots 
from 3-point range but managed to pull away by outrebounding the Waves in the 
second half, 30-15, and shooting 50% after halftime to pull away from a 34-32 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
Hank Gathers led the Lions with 31 points, and Simmons added 24, all but 4 in 
the second half. Fryer managed 21 points despite making only 5 of 18 shots. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions also got a spark off the bench from center John Veargason, who had 10 
points and 12 rebounds, and guard Terrell Lowery, who had 6 points and 8 
assists, including several key feeds as Loyola went on a 9-point run early in 
the second half to take a 47-40 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Though it wasn't artistic, the game had the atmosphere of a playoff after 
Pepperdine's 104-79 victory Wednesday. Five players fouled out, two technicals 
were called against Pepperdine, Loyola's Tom Peabody took an elbow to the 
eyebrow that needed a half-dozen stitches and opponents had to be separated 
several times. 
</P>
<P>
"This was our Army-Navy week. It was a test of our guys to put (Wednesday's 
loss) behind 'em and play hard," Loyola Coach Paul Westhead said. "I didn't 
think we shot especially well or looked real slick, but we played really hard." 
</P>
<P>
Wave Coach Tom Asbury noted Loyola played "with much more emotion." 
</P>
<P>
"Neither one of these teams could be called physical but that was awful 
physical and one of the most hard-fought games I've seen," Asbury said. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams, seemingly anxious at the start, went scoreless for the first 2:30, 
and Loyola needed more than 3 minutes to get on the scoreboard. The Lions 
eventually built a 26-16 lead, with Gathers accounting for 17 of the points, 
but Pepperdine managed to keep the game in the 30s. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we were in great shape at halftime, even though we hadn't played 
well," Asbury said. 
</P>
<P>
They exchanged leads until Loyola caught up, at 40-40, with 17:44 left. The 
Lions then ran off 9 points and eventually led 72-58 before Pepperdine put on 
its own spurt behind Tom Lewis and Shann Ferch, who did most of their scoring 
down the stretch. Lewis finished with 26 points and Ferch with 19. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine trimmed the lead to 76-70 on a pair of Lewis free throws with 4:54 
to play. But Lewis was called for a technical foul for a comment to the 
officials, and the Lions easily outdistanced the Waves, making 24 of 28 free 
throws in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to give them credit," Asbury said. "They had their tails kicked the 
other night, but they came back with a lot of emotion." 
</P>
<P>
Both teams play host to St. Mary's next weekend -- Friday at Loyola, then 
Saturday at Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
And another Loyola-Pepperdine matchup is a possibility in the WCAC tournament.

feeling we might meet again," Asbury said.

Had everything gone as planned, Tim Krumrie and his wife Cheryl would have 
checked out of their Honolulu hotel today, mementos of a second consecutive Pro 
Bowl appearance stuffed in their suitcases. 
</P>
<P>
There would be baby-sitters to pay in Eau Claire, Wis., relatives to see, 
friends with whom to discuss the events of Jan. 22, when Krumrie's Cincinnati 
Bengals lost a Super Bowl game to the San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Krumrie is waiting to check out of Cincinnati's Christ Hospital, where 
the 274-pound nose tackle takes up considerable bed space while recovering from 
leg surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Mementos? Try a set of crutches, a fresh supply of bandages and a scowl. 
Krumrie is going home, all right, but it isn't exactly the triumphant return he 
had hoped for. 
</P>
<P>
He wanted a Super Bowl ring. He got a freak injury instead. He wanted a trip to 
Hawaii and the Pro Bowl. Turns out an ambulance ride and hospital food will 
have to do. 
</P>
<P>
You figure it out; Krumrie can't. He did everything he was supposed to do on 
the play that snapped his left tibia and fibula -- the lower leg bones -- like 
dry twigs. If you were a coach grading his effort later on film, you couldn't 
help but place a plus mark next to Krumrie's name. It was perfect execution -- 
except for the result, which was perfectly sad and sickening. 
</P>
<P>
There in the first quarter, during the second series of the game for the Bengal 
defense, Krumrie crouched down into his stance, his eyes darting from Randy 
Cross, the 49er center, to the 49er backfield, to the rest of the Bengal 
defensive line. Krumrie was fine now. All the pregame jitters, all the 
nervousness were gone. Better yet, Cross or the two 49er guards were having 
trouble blocking him. 
</P>
<P>
"I was feeling good," Krumrie said from his hospital room. "I felt I was going 
to have a good game. I mean, I wasn't getting killed or handled." 
</P>
<P>
Cross snapped the ball and lurched toward Krumrie. Krumrie absorbed the hit and 
quickly moved down the line, toward running back Roger Craig, who was making 
his way toward an opening. Craig wouldn't have a chance. 
</P>
<P>
At the last moment, Krumrie planted his left foot in the Joe Robbie Stadium 
turf and struck. The collision was a loud one. Craig, who isn't tackled easily, 
tried to twist from Krumrie's grasp. Krumrie held on, his body going one way, 
his foot, caught in the turf, going another way. Something had to give. Turned 
out to be his leg. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt it snap," Krumrie said. "I heard it snap. I knew that I broke my leg." 
</P>
<P>
Cheryl and the Krumries' 4-year-old daughter, Kelly, were seated in the stands 
at about the 25-yard line. The play unfolded almost in front of them. They saw 
Krumrie hit Craig. They saw Krumrie remain on the ground, which is when Cheryl, 
who minored in athletic training in college, thought her husband had been 
knocked unconscious by one of Craig's knees, which pump furiously during a run. 
</P>
<P>
"He lay so still," she said. "When they played the replay . . . I immediately 
knew the leg was broken." 
</P>
<P>
Later, in a failed effort to cheer Krumrie up, she told him: "At least you made 
the tackle." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Robert Heidt Jr., the Bengal team physician and orthopedist, rushed onto 
the field and found Krumrie on his back and strangely calm. 
</P>
<P>
"I broke my leg," Krumrie said simply. 
</P>
<P>
Heidt believed him. 
</P>
<P>
"You never doubt Tim," he said. "He knows his body. He knew not to move. He 
felt the snap. He felt the pop. And he felt the pain." 
</P>
<P>
Krumrie's leg, said Heidt, was angled out "about 60-70 degrees." It was enough 
to make even Heidt, who has seen his share of that sort of injury, "a little 
queasy." 
</P>
<P>
Heidt checked Krumrie's pulse. He examined the leg and made sure it wasn't an 
open fracture, which would mean the bones were sticking out. They weren't. He 
squeezed Krumrie's knee and ankle to see if there was any damage to the joints. 
There wasn't. Then he gently held the leg and placed an air splint around it. 
</P>
<P>
Krumrie was put onto a stretcher. Before he was wheeled away, several of his 
teammates moved toward him. "We'll kick their butts," they said. 
</P>
<P>
Then Cross approached him. 
</P>
<P>
"You're a hell of a football player," Cross said. 
</P>
<P>
Krumrie nodded. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a class football player," he said later. 
</P>
<P>
Oddly enough, Krumrie was partly the victim of a patch of stubborn turf. Even 
early in the game, players were having difficulty planting their cleats in the 
loose, spongy grass. But this time Krumrie's foot stuck, leaving him flat on 
his back and flat out of the game that mattered most to him. 
</P>
<P>
"The doctors said my muscles were stronger than my bones," he said. "It was one 
of those weird things. Nobody cut me. It was bizarre. It was weird. It would 
have been a great play for me. Craig was right there." 
</P>
<P>
Once in the Bengal locker room, Heidt made arrangements for Krumrie to be 
transported to a nearby hospital. 
</P>
<P>
No way, said Krumrie, who clutched a tiny black-and-white television. He wanted 
to return to the sidelines after they stabilized the leg. 
</P>
<P>
Cheryl, who had made her way from the stands, arrived about the same time Heidt 
was getting the developed X-rays of the broken bones. Krumrie told her to 
return to her seat; he'd be out later. 
</P>
<P>
Heidt made a deal of sorts. No sidelines, but Krumrie could stay in the locker 
room until shortly after halftime. Then an ambulance would have to take him to 
the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Fair enough, Krumrie said. 
</P>
<P>
Then it was time to stabilize the leg. Morphine would be necessary. One 
problem: The paramedics had the painkiller stashed away in a kit. There would 
be a delay. 
</P>
<P>
Krumrie, tired of the wait, told Heidt to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
"You and I would be screaming for morphine," Heidt said. "He said, 'Just get 
this done and take care of it.' And we did. 
</P>
<P>
"He's one tough cookie, that's all I can say." 
</P>
<P>
Don't be fooled. High threshold of pain or not, Krumrie said the injury "hurt 
like hell." 
</P>
<P>
"But I could have been in shock," he said. "Maybe that's why I didn't ask for 
any (morphine). I guess I was so excited about the game. The adrenaline was 
flowing." 
</P>
<P>
Once the bones were set, Krumrie sat back and watched the game. Later, someone 
sent down a large color television to replace the hand-held screen Krumrie had 
been using. 
</P>
<P>
At the half, the score tied, 3-3, Krumrie became a cheerleader of sorts. As 
Bengal players stopped by to check his condition, he issued bits of wisdom or 
encouragement. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't enough, of course. The 49ers won, 20-16, and who knows how much 
difference Krumrie would have made. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people have said that to me," he said. "But you can't take one player 
and say, 'He would have won the game.' I thought David Grant (Krumrie's 
replacement) did a wonderful job. I thanked him for holding up my part of the 
bargain. My teammates played their hearts out. I thought (on the 49ers' game- 
winning drive) that we'd intercept a pass or make a big play." 
</P>
<P>
Krumrie checked into Christ Hospital the day after the game. On Tuesday, Heidt 
and Dr. Michael Welch operated for 3 hours. A rod, which runs the length of the 
tibia, was inserted into the bone. Two screws were put into the top of the bone 
and two more on the bottom. They'll be removed in 12 weeks, at which point 
Krumrie can begin working out again. 
</P>
<P>
There is no cast on the leg, only one large bandage "and a lot of little 
bandages," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And all things considered, Krumrie considers himself, in a way, lucky. Had fate 
really wanted to pull something on him, it could have snapped his knee 
ligaments and cartilage rather than a pair of bones. 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, Krumrie is waiting for his discharge papers. Truth be known, 
he's not crazy about hospitals. He'd prefer to be back in Eau Claire, where he 
could be with his family, including his 5-week-old son. Krumrie hasn't seen him 
in almost 3 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
And Krumrie could do without the publicity. At one point, hospital officials 
had to screen all calls. They also had to close Krumrie's room off, what with 
all the Bengal fans trying to sneak in to extend their get-well wishes. As it 
is, Krumrie finds himself with about 500 cards and 40 potted plants. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a floral shop now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Already Krumrie has begun a physical therapy program. He can do leg raises, 
ankle rotations and muscle flexes. When in bed, a machine flexes and stretches 
his knee to prevent atrophy. And sometime this week, Krumrie will be fitted 
with a custom brace. 
</P>
<P>
Back home are all sorts of goodies. Krumrie owns seven Nautilus machines, a 
Jacuzzi, a pool, a sauna, a stationary bike and assorted free weights. In 
short, a health club awaits in Krumrie's basement. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a long road," Cheryl said. 
</P>
<P>
But not an impossible one. Heidt said the outlook is favorable. 
</P>
<P>
"If the bone heals, God willing, he can go out and do what he needs to do 
again," Heidt said. 
</P>
<P>
Count on it, said Krumrie. He expects to return in time for the opening of 
Bengal training camp in July. 
</P>
<P>
As for memories, the fewer the better. Krumrie doesn't want to see another 
replay of the breaking of bones. He could also do without sympathy and pity. It 
happened, it's over, time to move on. 
</P>
<P>
So off he goes, on crutches and surely in pain. Some mementos.

O'MEARA PULLS OUT 1-SHOT WIN; 
</P>
<P>
HIS 10-FOOT BIRDIE ON 18TH GIVES HIM PEBBLE BEACH TITLE

PEBBLE BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tom Kite left the door open slightly for Mark O'Meara to win the AT&amp;T 
Pebble Beach National Pro-Am golf tournament Sunday -- and O'Meara charged 
right through. 
</P>
<P>
Kite, tied with O'Meara at 10-under par, finished his round with a par putt on 
the 18th hole at the Pebble Beach course. 
</P>
<P>
So it was up to O'Meara, playing one hole behind Kite, to either win the 
tournament, send it into a playoff, or blow it. 
</P>
<P>
O'Meara won it with style, a 10-foot, straightaway birdie putt on the final 
hole to take the winner's check of $180,000. He finished at 277, 11-under par. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to describe his feelings when the putt disappeared into the cup, O'Meara 
said: "I almost had a heart attack. The last time I felt like that was when I 
caught a 10-pound, 7-ounce largemouth bass in a lake near home. When I got it 
in the boat I was so excited I started hyperventilating. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a difficult putt because I've never had one like that before in all the 
years I've played here, even in amateur golf, or practice rounds. 
</P>
<P>
"It was hard to read it. I played it straight and it was kind of fast and 
downhill. It bounced and bounced and went in." 
</P>
<P>
The tournament came down to a two-player shoot-out between Kite and O'Meara, 
who had the lead after the second round and shared it with Nick Price going 
into the final round. 
</P>
<P>
Kite sank a birdie putt on the 13th hole to tie O'Meara at 9-under par and then 
went ahead by 1 stroke with another birdie at the 14th. 
</P>
<P>
However, O'Meara, who lives in Escondido, matched Kite's putt with a birdie of 
his own at the 14th hole. 
</P>
<P>
Then, the leaders parred the next three holes, setting up the climactic finish. 
</P>
<P>
Kite's approach shot on the par-5, 548-yard 18th hole went 15 feet above the 
hole. His birdie try went slightly to the right of the cup and he got his 
tap-in for a par. 
</P>
<P>
O'Meara said that from his vantage point on the fairway he couldn't see Kite's 
putt. 
</P>
<P>
"But from the reaction of the crowd, I knew he had missed it," O'Meara said. 
</P>
<P>
So O'Meara then used his sand wedge for his third shot on the 18th, a distance 
he said of 93 yards to the hole. 
</P>
<P>
His shot stayed to the right of the hole, and he said he then stroked his putt 
and hoped for the best. 
</P>
<P>
Even though O'Meara, 32, won here in 1985, the last year he had any victories 
on the PGA Tour, he wasn't looking forward to a playoff against Kite, 39, a 
17-year veteran of the Tour, who had won here in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"Tom might have had more experience on his side," said O'Meara, referring to 
the prospect of a playoff. 
</P>
<P>
For the record, O'Meara is 0-2 in playoffs, and Kite is 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
It seems that birthdays have been special occasions here. Price got a share of 
the lead Saturday on his 32nd birthday and O'Meara was especially pleased that 
he won Sunday on his father's 58th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
Kite, who lost here in a playoff against Curtis Strange in the Nabisco 
Championship last November, was obviously disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not much fun," he said. "I had my chances and I played a solid round. But 
I 3-putted the seventh and eighth holes and missed the green on the ninth for 
another bogey. I lost it in the middle of the round." 
</P>
<P>
Kite was 2 strokes behind O'Meara and Price at the start of the final round and 
shot a 69 Sunday despite his 3 bogeys (along with 3 birdies) on the front 9. 
</P>
<P>
O'Meara had a 70, with 2 bogeys and 4 birdies, the last, of course, being the 
most dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Carter, Sandy Lyle and Price, who had a final-round 73, finished behind the 
leaders at 280, 8-under par. 
</P>
<P>
O'Meara, though at even par heading into the final 9 holes, conferred with his 
caddy, Greg Rita, on strategy. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'Let's have a goal, go for 2 under on the backside. Let's play our 
game and try not to worry what's going on with the rest of the field.' 
</P>
<P>
"The turnaround for me was my birdie on 14. I knew he had birdied the 13th and, 
when he birdied the 14th, I realized that he had gone to 10 under and I knew I 
was 9 under. 
</P>
<P>
"So I hit a pitching wedge to within 2 feet of the hole at 14 to stay tied. 
Fortunately, it came down to the last hole with a chance to win, and I took 
advantage of it." 
</P>
<P>
Though it was windy and cold here Saturday, the weather couldn't have been 
better Sunday with minimal wind, a clear sky and temperatures in the high 60s. 
</P>
<P>
That was made to order for O'Meara, who said he plays better in warmer weather. 
</P>
<P>
"As a child, I had frostbite in both of my hands. So when it gets cold out 
there, I kind of lose my feel a little bit," O'Meara said. "Obviously, I was a 
little nervous. Who wouldn't be. But I tried to remain calm." 
</P>
<P>
O'Meara earned $438,311 on the tour last year and was 22nd on the prize money 
list. He has also been a money winner in tournaments in foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
O'Meara is an easygoing sort, but he seemed annoyed that the group ahead of him 
was playing so slowly. 
</P>
<P>
"It took us 3 hours to play the front side," he said. "The group ahead of us 
should have made a better effort to speed up. But I wasn't going to let it 
aggravate me." 
</P>
<P>
O'Meara said he hadn't dwelled on the fact that he hadn't won on the Tour since 
1985. He did, however, win the Australian Masters in 1986 and the Lawrence 
Batley Invitational in England in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"I've just worked hard to be more relaxed," he said. "You're going to have some 
bad shots. You can't expect perfection on every shot." 
</P>
<P>
O'Meara learned the game when his family moved to Mission Viejo when he was 13. 
He used to slip onto a nearby course to play. 
</P>
<P>
He played well enough at Mission Viejo High School to earn a golf scholarship 
to Cal State Long Beach. Then he won the U.S. Amateur title in 1979 and 
qualified for the tour 2 years later. 
</P>
<P>
Kite said he was cruising the first 6 holes with 3 birdies before he bogeyed 
the last 3 holes on the front 9. 
</P>
<P>
"Finishing second the second time around is much tougher," said Kite, referring 
to his playoff loss here to Strange. "I'll be disappointed and a little 
chagrined for the rest of the night. But next week is the L.A. Open, and I'll 
be down there trying to win and I guarantee you that somehow I'll take this 
tournament as a good blessing. 
</P>
<P>
"When you shoot 10-under par on these golf courses, you have nothing to be 
ashamed of. But it hurts when you come that close in a tournament you really 
felt you should have won." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Golf Notes 
</P>
<P>
Steve Jones and Jim Rheim won the pro-amateur division of the Pebble Beach 
tournament. They had a net 255, 1-stroke ahead of Dan Pohl and Dan Marino, the 
Miami Dolphins' quarterback. Jones, the defending champion of the tournament, 
finished at 281, 7-under par. He had a 70 on his final round. . . . Dave 
Stockton, with a 69 Sunday, finished at 282, 6-under par.

SCOTT OSTLER: BEING HERO IS TRICKY BUSINESS

<P>
Joe Montana! You've just directed the 49ers to another Super Bowl championship 
with a record-smashing display of passing and leadership! You have cemented 
your place in history as the quarterback of the '80s and one of the all-time 
clutcho-stupendo greats of football! What are you going to do now? 
</P>
<P>
Are you going to Disneyland? 
</P>
<P>
Or will you simply duck quietly out of sight? 
</P>
<P>
I think Plan B is the ticket, Joe. Forget Disneyland. Mickey Mouse and Goofy 
might go into a sulk because you're getting all the attention. 
</P>
<P>
"Just because we're not hotshot football stars," Mickey and Goofy would say, 
"is no reason for everyone to treat us like animals." 
</P>
<P>
Your genial Disneyland guide would write a book, telling all. How you tossed a 
candy-bar wrapper that missed the wide-open litter can by 5 feet, and how you 
sadistically refused to let your daughters have those huge lollipop they cried 
and begged for. 
</P>
<P>
Hey, Joe, pack up your wife and kids and head for a Tibetan mountaintop. It's 
the off-season there -- great rates, no phones. Go somewhere far away, because 
things are already getting ugly around here. 
</P>
<P>
First of all, your partner in crime has turned on you. Jerry Rice! 
</P>
<P>
The day after the Super Bowl, Rice is in a deep funk, bitter and depressed. 
Why? Because he has not cashed in commercially on his Super Bowl most valuable 
player award. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say it's the media's fault because they're not getting my name out 
there," Rice said. "If it were Joe Montana, Dwight Clark, it would have been 
headlines all over." 
</P>
<P>
Wonder how Rice thinks the MVP is chosen. By vote of the stadium hot-dog 
vendors? 
</P>
<P>
The football media, which is about 98% white, votes on the award. 
</P>
<P>
The media declared Rice to be the winner, even though in this observer's humble 
opinion, the 49er quarterback was clearly the MVP. 
</P>
<P>
Joe, apparently what's bothering Jerry is that he got the MVP but you got the 
"I'm going to Disneyland" commercial, $50,000 for 4 words. That selection, of 
course, was made before the game. It seems logical that the Disneyland people 
offered the spot to a 2-time Super Bowl MVP quarterback, rather than to a wide 
receiver who says his injured ankle is so sore he can't cut on it. 
</P>
<P>
I can understand Rice being ticked off if he hasn't landed a bunch of big 
endorsement contracts. I can even forgive him blaming it on media racism, even 
though that's a cheap, malicious cop-out. 
</P>
<P>
What I can't understand is him dragging your name into the dirt, Joe. Who threw 
the guy all those passes? 
</P>
<P>
I'm not saying Rice should be grateful. But it has been a great partnership, 
like Rogers and Astaire, and it would've been nice for Jerry to leave you out 
of it when he was lashing out at the injustice of it all. 
</P>
<P>
Rice, I'm sure, will get his commercial due, although I don't like his chances 
of signing a fat deal with Subaru. The MVP award winner is given a new Subaru, 
and when Rice was handed his keys, he sighed, "I've got so many cars, I don't 
know what I'll do with a Subaru." 
</P>
<P>
Shoot, he could give it to his mailman. He could fill it with dirt and make it 
into a planter. He could donate it to the homeless; with its fold-down bucket 
seats and roomy trunk, it probably would sleep 10. 
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the nation's press, I apologize to Rice for cluttering his 
driveway. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another problem lurks on your horizon, Joe. I hear that your 
ex-wife, Cass, has written a steamy book about the marriage and divorce that is 
(according to a publicist) "laced with Joe's emotional and highly revealing 
love letters." 
</P>
<P>
What I want to know, Joe, is how you could have walked out on a classy lady 
like this. The incredible courage of this woman, granting the public access to 
these vital and socially relevant documents, even though doing so might cause 
embarrassment to you. 
</P>
<P>
Joe, didn't anyone ever tell you? If you plan to get rich and famous, don't 
send letters to your sweetie, send Candygrams. 
</P>
<P>
Say, Joe, isn't this the same ex-wife who tried to keep your Super Bowl MVP 
trophy and your Super Bowl ring? When the Joe Montana Museum is built, this 
lady has to be the leading candidate for curator. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, you're an optimist, Joe. I'm sure you're grateful that your first 
wife hasn't written a book yet, or that your retiring center, Randy Cross, 
hasn't accused you of hogging the headlines, or of having cold hands. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it doesn't seem right. 
</P>
<P>
Your head coach quits on you this season, tries to demote you to second string, 
and when you beat back the challenge, he blames all the controversy on -- guess 
who? -- the media. 
</P>
<P>
You fight off shoulder and back and elbow problems, take injections, play hurt 
and never say a word, even when your back surgeon announces that you're putting 
your life on the line by continuing to play. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, on the last play of the season, you're firing an amazing rifle-shot 
touchdown pass to some guy we've never heard of. 
</P>
<P>
And nobody is surprised, because you've been doing pretty much the same thing 
for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
That's the way the movie would end, with a freeze frame on that moment of 
victory in the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
But this is real life, not a movie, and life plods forward, up hills and down 
valleys. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, life is a journey you have to walk yourself, Joe, unless Rice will lend 
you his Subaru.

LOUISVILLE LOSES ELLISON, THEN DROPS GAME TO OHIO STATE, 85-79 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<P>
Jay Burson is used to being overlooked, but sometimes he can be overpowering. 
</P>
<P>
Burson, a 6-foot, 156-pound guard, scored 29 points Sunday at Louisville, Ky., 
to lead No. 17 Ohio State to an 85-79 upset of third-ranked Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
"No one gave us a chance, but we had nothing to lose when we came in here," 
Burson said. "They were No. 3 and looking at becoming No. 1. A lot of people 
forgot about us." 
</P>
<P>
Louisville played the second half without All-American center Pervis Ellison, 
who went down with a sprain of the medial collateral ligament of his left knee 
late in the first half. He scored only 6 points. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Rudy Ellis will determine the extent of Ellison's injury today. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals (14-3) were riding a 14-game winning streak and were set to 
become the top-ranked team in the nation after No. 1 Illinois and No. 2 
Georgetown lost this week. 
</P>
<P>
But Ohio State (15-4) had the shortest and best player on the court. Burson hit 
12 of 20 shots and 5 of 6 free throws in addition to grabbing 7 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Ohio State outrebounded Louisville, 43-30, with Perry Carter grabbing 10. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen that before," Ohio State Coach Gary Williams said. "I don't get 
spoiled or jaded. He's gone from being a novelty because of his size to being a 
very good college guard." 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the 10th over a top 20 team in Williams' 2 1/2 years at Ohio 
State. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a good one," he said. "We beat Iowa at Iowa 2 years ago when they were 
No. 1 when Dennis Hopson had 35 points. And we beat Kentucky in the NCAA 
tournament later that year. Last year we beat Purdue when they were something 
like second in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"But like I said before, this means a lot. I'm a (full-court) pressing coach 
and Denny Crum has been pressing for the last 17 years. When I was an assistant 
at Lafayette, I used to watch Coach Crum's games and steal from him. And I will 
keep stealing from him." 
</P>
<P>
The Buckeyes trailed by 10 points early in the second half and still were 
behind, 64-59, when Perry Carter's rebound basket with 8 minutes left ignited a 
13-3 run that gave them the lead for good. 
</P>
<P>
Burson, who had 17 points in the second half, hit a pair of running jumpers to 
give Ohio State a 70-67 lead with less than 4 minutes left. Eli Brewster added 
a basket and Louisville couldn't recover. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona 72, Stanford 52 -- Sean Elliott scored 31 points and the sixth-ranked 
Wildcats held Todd Lichti in check while trouncing the No. 19 Cardinal in a 
Pacific 10 Conference game at Tucson, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott's performance gave him 2,218 points for his career, second in Pac-10 
career scoring to UCLA's Lew Alcindor (now Kareem Abdul-Jabbar), who finished 
with 2,325. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona (15-2, 9-1) had a 31-21 halftime lead, but Elliott, who also had 9 
rebounds, scored 18 points in the second half and the Wildcats pulled away. 
</P>
<P>
Lichti, who came in averaging 20.4 points and 13 shot attempts, finished with 
11 points on 2-of-5 shooting. Howard Wright scored 14 points for Stanford 
(15-5, 7-3). 
</P>
<P>
Duke 92, Clemson 62 -- Robert Brickey and Quin Snyder scored 19 points each and 
the eighth-ranked Blue Devils broke a 3-game losing streak by routing the 
Tigers in an Atlantic Coast Conference game at Durham, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
Clemson (12-5, 3-3) was without 6 players, including leading scorer Elden 
Campbell, who were suspended one game for "violation of basketball team policy 
regarding academic study hall rules." David Young had 19 points for Clemson. 
</P>
<P>
Duke (14-3, 4-3) broke the game open with a 32-5 run that opened a 62-33 lead. 
All-American Danny Ferry, who missed the last game with back spasms, had 8 
points to spark the surge and finished with 12 points. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina State 90, Maryland 67 -- Rodney Monroe and Brian Howard each 
scored 21 points and the No. 15 Wolfpack downed the Terrapins in an ACC game at 
College Park, Md. 
</P>
<P>
Maryland (6-12, 0-6) scored the first 9 points of the game but couldn't sustain 
the effort and lost its ninth straight game -- second only to the Terrapins' 
21-game losing streak at the end of the 1940-41 season. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Massenburg scored 19 points for Maryland and Chucky Brown added 18 points 
for N.C. State (14-2, 6-1), which turned the game around with a 28-9 run. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan 99, Purdue 88 -- Glen Rice scored 20 of his 34 points in the first 
half and the 10th-ranked Wolverines got past the Boilermakers in a Big Ten game 
at West Lafayette, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
Rice made 7 of 8 shots in leading Michigan (16-4, 4-3) to a 48-33 halftime lead 
and the Wolverines went on to snap a 2-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Jones had 17 points for Purdue (9-11, 2-5). 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame 64, Temple 60 -- Jamere Jackson hit three 3-point shots and scored 
15 points as the Irish turned back the Owls at South Bend, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
LaPhonso Ellis, whose 5 points were his lowest point total this season, hit 2 
free throws with 20 seconds remaining to seal the win for Notre Dame (10-3). 
</P>
<P>
Mike Vreeswyck scored 17 points and Mark Macon had 14 for Temple (9-7).

Forward Jonni Gray scored three 3-point baskets in the first half on her way to

</P>
<P>
USC (6-11 overall, 2-5 in the Pac-10) outshot Washington State in the first

Cherie Nelson and Teresa Strickland came off the bench to score 28 and 11 
points, respectively, for USC. Angie Miller added 16 points for Washington

Hector Lopez, Derrick Kelly and Ruben Castillo headline tonight's boxing show 
at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez (17-1), the No. 1-ranked (World Boxing Council) featherweight in the 
world from Glendale, meets Rogelio Lopez (16-6) from Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez, who won the Forum's featherweight tournament title last year, hasn't 
fought since last spring, after being arrested and jailed on a kidnap charge 
involving his girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly (21-1-2), from Los Angeles, boxes Luis Santana (38-7) of Las Vegas, who 
will defend his North American Boxing Federation welterweight championship for 
the fourth time. The two met 14 months ago at the Forum, Kelly winning a 
10-round decision. 
</P>
<P>
Castillo, normally behind the microphone with Chick Hearn at Forum boxing shows 
as a Prime Ticket commentator, is launching a comeback at age 31. In a 10-round 
lightweight bout, he meets Santos Moreno (45-15) of Juarez, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Castillo was 66-6 when he retired in 1985. He fought four times in world title 
bouts, but never won. EARL GUSTKEY

CUNNINGHAM, WALKER LEAD NFC IN PRO BOWL

<P>
Randall Cunningham displayed his knack for improvisation, and Herschel Walker 
showed how tough he is to stop near the goal line as the NFC routed the AFC, 
34-3, in Sunday's Pro Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham, voted the game's Most Valuable Player, completed 10 of 14 passes 
for 83 yards and rushed twice for 49 more yards. The Dallas Cowboys' Walker 
scored 2 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"We've taken the short end of the stick the past couple of years," Walker said, 
referring to the NFC's having lost the last two previous Pro Bowls. "We were 
fired up this time." 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham, the Philadelphia Eagle quarterback making his Pro Bowl debut, made 
a couple of spectacular plays by turning broken plays into healthy gains. 
</P>
<P>
"The key was just not giving up until the end of the plays," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"When I found out I had won the MVP I was really fired up; I mean, Herschel had 
2 touchdowns . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Chicago's Mike Ditka, coach of the NFC All-Stars, said, "With the talent we 
had, it would have taken a lot of bad coaching to mess it up." 
</P>
<P>
New Orleans kicker Morten Andersen added a pair of field goals for the winners, 
including a Pro Bowl record 51-yarder. 
</P>
<P>
The NFC led 14-3 at halftime, then took complete command with 10 points each in 
the third and fourth quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Neal Anderson of the Chicago Bears, another first-timer in the Pro Bowl, also 
was an offensive standout for the NFC. He rushed for 85 yards in 13carries and 
caught 2 passes for 17 more yards. 
</P>
<P>
Houston quarterback Warren Moon led the AFC with 13 completions in 20 attempts 
for 134 yards. But, after going 10 for 11 for 98 yards in the first half of his 
initial Pro Bowl, Moon was pressured by the NFC defense in the second and had 
trouble throwing the ball on target. 
</P>
<P>
"When you get behind, the defense comes right at you," Moon said. "They know 
you have to throw the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Marv Levy of Buffalo, the AFC coach, said: "We played a lackluster game. I feel 
badly. You don't play any game, including an All-Star game, without wanting to 
win." 
</P>
<P>
"As we didn't make the plays, our enthusiasm waned; as they made the plays, 
their enthusiasm increased." 
</P>
<P>
Walker's first touchdown, a 4-yard run, put the NFC ahead, 7-3. Then John 
Settle of the Atlanta Falcons made it 14-3 on a 1-yard touchdown run on 
fourth-and-goal midway through the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
With Cunningham at the controls in the third quarter, the NFC added a 27-yard 
field goal by Andersen and a 7-yard touchdown run by Walker. 
</P>
<P>
A 51-yard field goal by Andersen, which broke the Pro Bowl record of 48 yards, 
set by Jan Stenerud in 1972, and an 8-yard touchdown pass from Minnesota's Wade 
Wilson to the Rams' Henry Ellard closed out the scoring. 
</P>
<P>
The NFC defense, led by ends Chris Doleman of Minnesota and Charles Mann of 
Washington, limited the AFC to a 38-yard field goal by Buffalo's Scott Norwood 
in the early moments of the game. 
</P>
<P>
The NFC, which had lost two straight Pro Bowl games and three of the last four, 
now leads the series 11-8. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the winning NFC team earned $10,000 each. The losing players got 
$5,000 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
Moon had the AFC moving well in the first quarter and early in the second, with 
his only incompletion still a well-thrown pass. 
</P>
<P>
The ball bounced off intended receiver Eddie Brown of Cincinnati and the San 
Francisco 49ers' Ronnie Lott intercepted 1-yard deep in the NFC end zone and 
returned the ball 34 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the second period, Wilson marched the NFC 80 yards for its second 
touchdown.

MATER DEI HIGH COACH FINDS WINNING ISN'T EVERYTHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gary McKnight, the Empire Builder, stands with his hands thrust in the pockets 
of his gray trousers surveying his latest masterpiece. 
</P>
<P>
It's nearly 8 o'clock one evening and 18 boys clad in the red-and-white colors 
of Santa Ana Mater Dei High School shoot layups inside the Orange Coast College 
gymnasium at Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
McKnight, dressed in a brilliant red sweater with "M.D. basketball" emblazoned 
over his heart, is stationed near the end of the Mater Dei bench. 
</P>
<P>
After 6 seasons -- some filled with controversy -- McKnight, 36, is a portrait 
of success. He's a 5-foot 10-inch, chubby genius of a basketball coach, having 
transformed a very good Mater Dei program into a juggernaut, the likes of which 
has never been seen in the Southern Section. 
</P>
<P>
He has won five Southern Section and Angelus League championships and a state 
championship at Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
McKnight has a 189-17 record, including 21-2 this season. The Monarchs are 64-2 
in Angelus League play. Despite a 21-8 record (McKnight's worst) and losing the 
league title to Bishop Amat last season, McKnight rallied the Monarchs to a 
fourth consecutive 5-A championship. He's the only coach in the 76-year history 
of the Southern Section to win four straight titles. 
</P>
<P>
McKnight has turned out more top-flight players than any other coach in Orange 
County. He has sent players to California, Brigham Young, Kentucky, Loyola 
Marymount, Pepperdine and Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
McKnight, his wife, Judy, and their young sons, Bryan, Clay, Geoffrey and 
Matthew, live in a spacious 2-story home in Mission Viejo. The McKnights have 
two basketball hoops in the backyard. 
</P>
<P>
All is bliss for McKnight these days. 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't always that way. There were times in his early days at Mater Dei 
that McKnight was miserable, which was directly tied to winning. 
</P>
<P>
As Mater Dei won, McKnight and the school became the target of accusations and 
innuendo. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mater Dei recruits players, which McKnight denies. 
</P>
<P>
 -- McKnight keeps his star players in lopsided games so they can pad scoring 
averages. 
</P>
<P>
 -- All McKnight cares about is winning, regardless of the consequences. 
</P>
<P>
McKnight, 29 when he was hired at Mater Dei, his first head coaching position, 
admits he made mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
In his zeal to make Mater Dei a powerhouse, his teams often won games by 40 or 
50 points, when he could have given his reserves more playing time and still 
won by 20. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei won its first Southern Section championship in his first season, its 
second 2 years later. 
</P>
<P>
But after 3 heady seasons full of victories, McKnight found himself with few 
friends and no respect among his peers. 
</P>
<P>
It was then he knew he had to make peace. He knew he had to mature. 
</P>
<P>
"I was young and heading the most powerful athletic program in Orange County in 
the largest Catholic high school west of Chicago," McKnight said. 
</P>
<P>
McKnight knew how to win. He just needed to know how to handle winning more 
gracefully. 
</P>
<P>
He has since learned that sometimes it pays to be nice, to show a little 
compassion for the other team, to be humble in victory, to be graceful in 
defeat. 
</P>
<P>
McKnight has mellowed and matured as time has passed. He said he has made 
overtures to make friends with other coaches. 
</P>
<P>
And because he has, he has taken his rightful place as one of the Southern 
Section's most respected coaches. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE WONDER YEARS 
</P>
<P>
Tony Sisca had no doubts that Gary McKnight would be a success. 
</P>
<P>
In 1969, Sisca coached baseball at San Clemente High School when McKnight was a 
hard-nosed sophomore catcher trying to make an impression. 
</P>
<P>
"You could see he wanted to learn as much as he could about the game," said 
Sisca, a government and economics teacher at San Clemente. "I thought he was 
very, very serious. I remember remarking that I hope this kid makes our team 
because he's so serious. 
</P>
<P>
"When he took batting practice, he didn't joke around. He tried to hit the ball 
hard every time and was deeply disappointed if he didn't." 
</P>
<P>
McKnight made varsity that season, but an injury limited his playing time. He 
also played varsity football. 
</P>
<P>
But when it came to basketball, McKnight was cut from the junior varsity. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a good kid, but baseball was his best sport," said Stan DeMaggio, 
former San Clemente basketball coach. 
</P>
<P>
McKnight continued playing baseball at Saddleback College, under the late 
Marshall Adair. By then, McKnight knew he wanted to be a coach. 
</P>
<P>
McKnight's interest in coaching began when he was a junior in high school. He 
coached baseball, basketball and football in San Clemente youth leagues. He 
graduated to coach traveling all-star youth basketball teams, something he 
continued to do until he took the Mater Dei job in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
In 1973, DeMaggio hired McKnight as freshman coach and varsity assistant. 
McKnight jumped at the chance, though it wasn't everything he expected it to 
be. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, I started working for him as a volunteer the year before," McKnight 
said. "All I did was take the last five down to the other end of the court and 
teach them the other team's offense." 
</P>
<P>
DeMaggio, who now coaches the Capistrano Valley High School girls' basketball 
team, quit in 1976 and McKnight, newly graduated from Cal State Fullerton, 
became an assistant to Bill Mulligan at Saddleback College. McKnight had 
coached Mulligan's son, Brian, on the freshman team at San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
"I first saw him when my sons were playing on a Riverside traveling team," said 
Mulligan, UC Irvine's coach. "There was this little fat guy coaching Mission 
Viejo. And they were beating everybody by 50 points. My first reaction was not 
to like the guy." 
</P>
<P>
That changed as Mulligan got to know McKnight. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy can coach," Mulligan said. "Above all, he can coach." 
</P>
<P>
Mulligan introduced McKnight to Jim Harris, who had just been named the coach 
at a new high school in Huntington Beach called Ocean View. 
</P>
<P>
Harris had met McKnight a few years earlier when McKnight was coaching a youth 
team that played a game at Ocean View. 
</P>
<P>
"He was very quiet, very gentlemanly and very young," said Harris, who 
officiated the game. 
</P>
<P>
Harris remains McKnight's closest friend. Their families take summer vacations 
together and make a point of attending the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
Final Four each year. 
</P>
<P>
It was at Ocean View that McKnight got a taste of winning and winning big on 
the high school level. 
</P>
<P>
He coached the freshman and junior varsity teams to a combined 82-11 record and 
won a league championship in each of his 4 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, McKnight, who taught science at Ocean View, was laid off by the 
Huntington Beach Union High School District and a subsequent job search yielded 
a teaching position at Mater Dei. He continued to coach at Ocean View and was 
one of the finalists for a vacancy as the Seahawks' varsity baseball coach. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't get the job -- "It's funny how things work out," he said -- and 2 
months later, he was named to succeed Bill Alexander, who was asked to resign, 
as Mater Dei varsity basketball coach. 
</P>
<P>
McKnight came to Mater Dei with no varsity experience. But with Adair, Harris 
and Mulligan as his mentors and a gymnasium full of talented players awaiting 
him, he was seemingly headed straight to the big time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE BLUNDER YEARS 
</P>
<P>
"I thought, 'Is this how easy it is?' " McKnight said of his first few seasons 
at Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
The answer appeared to be a resounding yes. 
</P>
<P>
McKnight had Tom Lewis (now at Pepperdine), Matt Beeuwsaert (California) and 
Chris Jackson (UC Riverside). The Monarchs clobbered their opponents. 
</P>
<P>
His first season, Mater Dei was 29-3 and won the 4-A title -- then the large 
school division. In his second, the Monarchs were 28-2 and were the 4-A 
runners-up. 
</P>
<P>
But at a time when Mater Dei was bringing new-found respect to Orange County 
high school basketball, McKnight was lonely. At a time when he should have been 
hailed for his efforts, he was assailed for being overzealous. 
</P>
<P>
Other coaches despised him for his tactics: for allegedly recruiting Lewis 
(though it has never been proven), for running up scores, for keeping the 
starters in long after games were decided to pad his stars' statistics. 
</P>
<P>
And they hated him for winning. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard not to have a little arrogance when you win all the time," said Mark 
Ramstack, last season's point guard. "A lot of that comes from people's 
perception because you win. A lot of people judge you because you win." 
</P>
<P>
As Mater Dei continued to win, McKnight continued to lose friends. 
</P>
<P>
"He called me at that time, and said, 'You're the only friend I've got,' " 
Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a lot of pressures and mistakes," McKnight said. "We ran up a lot 
of scores. We had a lot of false values, it seems now as the years have 
passed." 
</P>
<P>
Former Dana Hills Coach Steve Thornton was particularly critical. 
</P>
<P>
"McKnight says that Mater Dei is great for Orange County basketball," Thornton 
was quoted as saying in a 1984 Times story on the ethics of the Monarch 
basketball program. "I think it's terrible for Orange County basketball myself. 
It makes a mockery of what high school sports is supposed to be." 
</P>
<P>
Countered McKnight in the same article: 
</P>
<P>
"I think it comes with winning. It's part of the territory. We're 51-4 in 2 
years. I wonder if some of these people would be upset if we were 4-51. If we 
need to have a mediocre program for me to have some of these people who are 
jealous as my friends, I guess I won't have them as friends." 
</P>
<P>
Now, McKnight said he could have been more diplomatic. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I had the right attitude," McKnight said. "I don't think I 
handled some things very well then. I didn't have the maturity at the time. It 
bothered me that coaches in the county didn't like me, that I was alienating 
them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE YEARS AHEAD 
</P>
<P>
Clay McKnight, 12, jogged out to the backyard, scooped up one of what seemed to 
be 3 dozen basketballs lying about, took a couple of dribbles and unloaded a 
two-handed dunk on one of the two hoops. This one is only 7 feet high, but it 
still was impressive. 
</P>
<P>
Marv Marinovich built it for his son, Todd, a former Capistrano Valley and 
Mater Dei football quarterback and basketball player, now at USC. He passed it 
on to McKnight when Todd outgrew it. 
</P>
<P>
The other basket is regulation 10 feet. The pole is set into a 5-foot deep 
block of cement to ensure it weathers jamming by McKnight's other kids -- the 
varsity players at Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
Clay is quickly followed by Bryan, 8, Geoffrey, 7. Matthew, 5, lags behind. 
</P>
<P>
"He only looks like an angel," Judy McKnight said rolling her eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Each boy had a ball in hand, dribbling and shooting in a mini-Monarch shoot 
around. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the pounding of the basketballs, it's an idyllic scene. 
</P>
<P>
The McKnight family is highly visible at every Mater Dei game. Judy stands with 
Gary for a few moments in front of the bench before the game starts. After a 
few quiet words and a peck on the cheek, she's off to take her seat in the 
stands. The McKnight children are ballboys. 
</P>
<P>
But to get the full effect, to find McKnight at his happiest you have to come 
here, to see him and his family at home. 
</P>
<P>
"My family gets cheated," McKnight said. "Especially during the season. It 
would be nice if my home was closer to school. My sons could come to practice 
every day. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of fun. They're starting to understand now what dad does. I'm 
looking forward to the day Clay is a freshman. It's not just the basketball, 
but riding to school together in the mornings." 
</P>
<P>
His devotion to family life is one of the reasons McKnight said he would not 
accept a college assistant coaching position. Though it seems to be the next 
logical step in McKnight's rising career, he says he can't bear the thought of 
flying around the country scouting and visiting recruits without the company of 
his family. 
</P>
<P>
Nor can he fathom the idea of knocking down doors to get a head coaching 
position at a college. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been offered several assistant jobs, usually it's to nail a recruit," 
McKnight said. "I'm very content. I'm very happy at Mater Dei." 
</P>
<P>
With that contentment and happiness, a new Gary McKnight has emerged. The 
brashness of the angry young McKnight has faded. What remains is simply the 
most successful coach of the most successful basketball program in the Southern 
Section.

Orel Hershiser picked up his National League Cy Young and World Series MVP

"I hope this city is easy on me," Hershiser said only half-jokingly, "because

Hershiser and the Dodgers probably will go to arbitration over this season's

NEWSWIRE: KIMBALL FACES SENTENCING TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Olympic diver Bruce Kimball faces up to 22 years in prison when he is 
sentenced today in Tampa, Fla., for drunken driving-manslaughter in the Aug. 1 
death of two teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
Kimball, 25, will be sentenced by Hillsborough Circuit Judge Harry Lee Coe, 
before whom he pleaded guilty Jan. 11, the day after a jury was seated to hear 
his trial. 
</P>
<P>
State sentencing guidelines call for a sentence of 7 to 22 years on the 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
Kimball was free on bond before his trial but after pleading guilty was jailed 
without bond to await sentencing. He has been kept in a one-person call and 
checked every 15 minutes because his attorneys that they were concerned about 
his "self-destructive behavior." 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said Kimball, who won a silver medal in platform diving in the 
1984 Summer Olympics at Los Angeles, was driving his sports car at 70 to 90 
m.p.h. when it slammed into a group of teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
Kimball admitted he had been drinking earlier in the day and prosecutors said a 
blood-alcohol test administered that night recorded .20, twice the legal limit.

BODY FOUND OFF VENTURA LINKED TO SHARK ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID FREED, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura County coroner said Sunday that a young woman whose body was found 
floating in the ocean near Ventura may have been the victim of an extremely 
rare shark attack, possibly the first such fatality in California waters in 
four years. 
</P>
<P>
The body of the unidentified woman, believed to be a windsurfer, was spotted 
Saturday about six miles off Channel Islands Harbor by the crew of a sailboat, 
Coroner Warren Lovell said. Crew members of a Coast Guard vessel retrieved the 
body. 
</P>
<P>
An examination showed that the woman, believed to be between 18 and 26 years 
old, had sustained a "classic shark bite," which gouged a 13-inch-wide chunk of 
flesh from the front of her left thigh. Lovell said the woman also sustained 
several other superficial bite wounds and a fresh "defensive-type" bruise to 
the back of her right hand, as if she had tried to stave off a lunging shark. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Evidence of Drowning 
</P>
<P>
She had been dead one to two days, according to the coroner. 
</P>
<P>
"The lungs did not show any of the classic findings of drowning," Lovell said. 
"This was about as likely a fresh bite case as I've ever seen. It would appear 
that the bites occurred before" the victim died. 
</P>
<P>
"She was a gorgeous young girl," Lovell said. "It's a real shame." 
</P>
<P>
The woman had short brown hair and was wearing a blue and black Spandex 
swimming suit, with a blue and black zip-up jacket. She was wearing a ring on 
her right hand and single-stone ear studs. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on the way she was dressed, we think she might have been windsurfing," 
Lovell said. 
</P>
<P>
A check of law enforcement agencies along the California coast found that none 
has fielded any report of a missing person matching the victim, the coroner 
said. Nor have there been any reported shark sightings in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Shark attacks in Southern California are extremely rare, particularly when 
compared to the number of attacks that have occurred along the state's central 
and northern coast. 
</P>
<P>
Records show that California's last fatal shark attack took place in September, 
1984, when a diver searching for abalone was attacked off Pigeon Point, about 
40 miles south of San Francisco. The diver was attacked about 150 yards 
offshore by what his partner described as a 12- to 15-foot great white shark, 
which bit him on the upper legs and buttocks. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1926, when California officials began keeping such records, and 1984, 
six other people are known to have been killed by sharks. In five of those 
instances, the shark was believed to be a great white. 
</P>
<P>
Shark expert John McCosker, director of the Steinhart Aquarium in San 
Francisco, said Sunday that the attack reported in Ventura County was a 
"classic white shark scenario." Such fish, he said, can exceed 20 feet and 3 
1/2 tons, although most attacks have involved great whites that were 10 to 18 
feet in length. 
</P>
<P>
"If this was, in fact, a great white attack, it would be the first that we know 
of to have occurred south of Santa Barbara," McCosker said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1959, a diver was killed in an attack off La Jolla in San Diego, but 
witnesses said the fish was most likely a tiger shark, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
In all, there have been 50 fatal and non-fatal shark attacks in California 
waters since 1926, McCosker said.

MAN AND THE HOUR MEET IN BENNETT; 
</P>
<P>
HIP MAVERICK TAKES OVER IN NATION'S WAR ON DRUGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS JEHL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
AUSTIN, Tex. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Back in 1967, as the waves of student unrest and the counterculture broke over 
the campus of the University of Texas, a graduate student named William J. 
Bennett cut a memorable figure at philosophy department parties. 
</P>
<P>
He would down a few Lone Star beers, squash his cigarette and pick up a guitar. 
The music was the Animals' classic, "House of the Rising Sun," but the words 
were the opening lines of "Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus" -- the seminal 
discourse by Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein. 
</P>
<P>
"The world is all that is the case," Bennett would warble, parroting the 
abstruse propositions all philosophy students were required to read. " . . . 
The world of facts, not things." 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere on campus, the smell of marijuana and strains of acid rock served 
notice that the times were changing. Long hair was hip. So were sandals and 
psychedelic drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Austin was the wintering place for San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury. And nowhere 
was that influence so evident as in Nueces House, a "pre-hippie" student co-op 
whose 23-year-old graduate supervisor would one day be tapped as the nation's 
first drug czar. 
</P>
<P>
Yet where his peers saw creative, mind-expanding possibilities in drugs, or at 
least harmless fun, Bennett saw something disturbing. Following the lead of a 
moralistic faculty mentor, he clung conspicuously to the earlier symbols of 
rebellion -- beer and cigarettes, motorcycles and rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
Two decades before Nancy Reagan's campaign, say those who knew him then, Bill 
Bennett shunned drugs and what they stood for. Today, with national attitudes 
swinging sharply away from the permissiveness of the 1970s and President Bush 
vowing to lift the scourge of narcotics, the man and the hour seem to have met 
in Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
Selected over candidates with extensive law enforcement experience, he embodies 
what is expected to be the central theme of the new Administration: the 
argument that strength of character and individual willpower may be more potent 
than police work in the war against drugs. 
</P>
<P>
From today's vantage point, Bennett's record -- the party-loving "regular guy" 
whose regard for moral conduct and abiding ambition caused him to avoid even 
marijuana while a student -- provides a fitting biography for an anti-drug 
chieftain. 
</P>
<P>
In the Cabinet-level post, created by a frustrated Congress to make one person 
accountable, Bennett is to knit together the federal government's fragmented 
anti-drug efforts and coordinate the work of more than a dozen departments and 
agencies. He will deal with everything from military interdiction and 
intelligence to drug testing of air traffic controllers and admonishing 
children in federal schools on the dangers of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Exhort, Command 
</P>
<P>
He is expected to exhort as well as command -- providing inspiration that might 
curb the nation's demand for narcotics. 
</P>
<P>
In that regard, those who remember Bennett less than fondly call attention to 
another side to his credentials. 
</P>
<P>
Resident for more than a decade on campuses that were the laboratories of 
change, Bennett came ultimately to regard himself as an embodiment of the "true 
counterculture," his friends say -- a lone voice against a misguided chorus. 
</P>
<P>
As such, he was resented by some for what they saw as his intolerance. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, drug abuse is most prevalent among many whose lives are more troubled 
than Bennett's has been and who do not have the profound self-confidence he has 
always evinced. In this context, Bennett may find it hard to reach out 
successfully to those whose attitudes he now seeks to sway. 
</P>
<P>
"People have always been put off by him," said Timothy Lowe, a longtime friend. 
Said Steve Craddock, who knew Bennett while he was attending law school at 
Harvard: "Bill never had a penchant for tolerating divergence from the norm." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, his stand in the '60s has in part won him the first opportunity 
to show whether he has an answer for the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Eye to Future 
</P>
<P>
The recollections of more than two dozen former Bennett friends and associates 
interviewed for this story read like highlights of a resume compiled with 
prescience for the role he would later assume. 
</P>
<P>
 -- His near-fanatical love for rock music was "severely tested" in the 
mid-'60s by the British invasion of pop music and by "lyrics that glorified 
drug use," according to Ken Watson, his roommate first at Williams College in 
New England and later at Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 -- When marijuana smoke first began to seep into the Nueces House hallways in 
the fall of 1966, Bennett spoke out, warning residents that drug use could be 
harmful to them and to the co-op's status. Unable to stop the trend, he grew 
uncomfortable and was regarded as an outcast, though friends say he did not 
become a crusader on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 -- When he was a teaching fellow at Southern Mississippi University in 
1967-68, he "took delight in the straight-arrow ethos," according to Lowe. "How 
refreshing it was that drugs had not become a widely used feature of life," 
Lowe remembers Bennett observing. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Later, while teaching at the University of Wisconsin at Madison in the 
early 1970s, Bennett became infuriated at seeing "spaced-out students, all of 
them high on drugs and wasting their lives," crowding pristine streets named 
after signers of the Constitution, said John Burkett, another friend. 
</P>
<P>
"He has the analytic abilities to get ahold of the problem, and he has the 
right principles to direct him toward the right solution," said John Silber, 
philosophy department chairman during Bennett's time at Texas and now president 
of Boston University. "I think he's one of the few people alive who has the 
courage to do the job." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Military Force 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Bennett has advocated the use of increased military force against 
drug producers and traffickers. But in comments the day of his nomination, 
Bennett said he expects in his new job to conduct "a conversation with the 
American people. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"In the war against drugs," he said, "you don't, I guess, expect me to be 
walking a beat or patroling in people's houses." 
</P>
<P>
Born in 1943 to a middle-class family in Brooklyn, Bennett spent most his young 
adulthood as student, teacher and administrator in universities. He left 
campuses behind in 1976, when he became executive director and later president 
of the National Humanities Center in North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
A big man with a lumbering gait, Bennett still looks like the college football 
lineman he was at Williams, the elite New England liberal arts institution 
where he received a scholarship after attending a Jesuit high school in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
As an outspoken education secretary under former President Ronald Reagan from 
1985 until last summer, Bennett maintained that rough-hewn image. He stubbornly 
remained a bachelor until age 39 (he married Mary Glover in 1982 and they have 
a 4-year-old son) and even played quarterback on the department's team in 
Sunday morning games on the Mall. 
</P>
<P>
With his bearish appearance and his relish for the rough-and-tumble approach to 
intellectual combat, Bennett was the model of the self-made scholar. He was a 
package of classical allusions and beer and cigarettes who disdained effete 
intellectuals. 
</P>
<P>
That also had been his image when neoconservatives persuaded Reagan to appoint 
him to head the National Endowment for the Humanities in 1981, and earlier, as 
the young student and teacher in the '60s and '70s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Making Statement' 
</P>
<P>
"He was making a statement," said a close Bennett friend. "He was saying: 'Look 
at me, I'm drinking beer, I'm dressing like a bum, I love rock 'n' roll music, 
I love football, and yet I'm a philosopher too." 
</P>
<P>
A back injury at Williams helped philosophy supplant football as Bennett's 
principal preoccupation. But his new commitment to Kant and Socrates did not 
otherwise separate him from the mainstream of student life in the days before 
the drug culture dawned. 
</P>
<P>
Along with most of his classmates, Bennett turned out enthusiastically for 
fraternity rush despite a college decision to phase out the fraternity system 
altogether. While illicit drugs were hardly to be found at Kappa Alpha, the 
house of his choice -- or indeed anywhere else at Williams in 1961-65 -- beer 
was still plentiful, even for the underaged. Bennett, friends say, drank his 
share. 
</P>
<P>
Yet he seemed precociously aware of long-term consequences. In a Shakespeare 
class, Bennett identified closely with Prince Hal -- the fun-loving rapscallion 
who distanced himself from his roistering friends as he came to realize that he 
would become King Henry V. 
</P>
<P>
"The lesson was that responsibility set limits to the kind of fun you can 
have," said Lowe, who took the course with Bennett. "That was a hard message at 
Williams, and it was one that we spent a lot of time talking about . . . I 
think public service loomed for Bill early on." 
</P>
<P>
Mirroring the liberal drift of their generation, Bennett and his friends 
regularly attended the meetings of the campus chapter of Students for a 
Democratic Society. But while others decided to join the radical group, Bennett 
stalled. Ultimately, he heeded the advice of his older brother, Robert, who 
warned that association with a "fringe group" might later prove troublesome. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Regarded as Leftist 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the Bennett who arrived at the University of Texas as a 
first-year graduate student in the fall of 1965 was regarded by his classmates 
as a leftist -- a disciple of William Sloane Coffin Jr., the nationally 
prominent anti-war leader and popular motorcycle-riding chaplain from Yale, and 
earlier Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, once Bennett saved enough money, he bought a motorcycle of his own, and 
took delight in roaring around Austin on his fast new machine. 
</P>
<P>
But Silber, the philosophy department chairman and moral preacher whose 
influence over Bennett would be difficult to exaggerate, put a quick end to 
such nonsense. 
</P>
<P>
Declaring motorcycles unfit for rational men, Silber issued a "no motorcycles" 
ultimatum for his graduate students. An intimidated Bennett obeyed. He even 
bought Silber's '52 Chevrolet. 
</P>
<P>
"Silber was kind of a puritan," then-graduate student David Solomon said. "He 
hated long hair, couldn't stand bell-bottoms, and was hard on drugs." He even 
lectured about "the impossibility of a philosopher doing his job if he had a 
wet soul," according to Larry Hickman, a Bennett classmate. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Silber did like to invite students to his home for darts and beer. And 
Bennett was far from a teetotaler. 
</P>
<P>
"We consumed massive quantities of alcohol," said classmate John Hardwig of 
these graduate-school get-togethers. Indeed, Bennett's appetites for smoking 
and drinking were such that Hardwig said he would have been "shocked" 20 years 
ago if told that Bennett one day would hold a position of authority over social 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
By the standards set by Silber and emulated by Bennett, vices such as drinking 
and smoking were permissible if they did not interfere with one's work. Thus 
Bennett remained a smoker until he was nominated to the drug czar post. Asked 
then how he could display an addiction of his own while condemning others for 
not abandoning theirs, he agreed to kick the habit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Life of Principle 
</P>
<P>
Drugs, illegal and mind altering, have never met the Silber test. "You had to 
lead a life of principle," said David Gerber, a former Silber student. "You 
couldn't just drift hither and yon." 
</P>
<P>
In Bennett's periodic public pronouncements about drugs, those who knew him at 
Texas have heard a distinct Silber echo. Silber suggests that should not be 
surprising. "Civilized people," he said in a recent interview, "have never been 
confused about whether intoxicants diminish public performance." 
</P>
<P>
It was Silber, ironically, who helped bring Bennett to Nueces House in the 
autumn of 1966. It was 
</P>
<P>
one of two "College Houses" established through foundation grants to stimulate 
academic debate in a residential setting. Silber encouraged Bennett to take up 
residence. 
</P>
<P>
For all its high ideals, Nueces House was no pristine ivory tower. 
</P>
<P>
In the fall of 1966, the emphasis on intellectual curiosity attracted certain 
collateral effects. "In College House," said a Bennett friend, "would be the 
kids doing drugs, the kids strongly opposed to the war, the first long-hairs in 
Texas." 
</P>
<P>
"Peyote was wild," said another friend, John Burkett. "There was LSD, speed . . 
. you just had a lot of crazy stuff." 
</P>
<P>
"In College House . . . " said former resident Dean Rindy, "Bill Bennett was in 
an atmosphere in which most people around him were doing things he's condemning 
now as hell's power." 
</P>
<P>
No one interviewed offered any indication that Bennett might have used illegal 
drugs, and the nominee declined a request for an interview. Asked previously 
whether he had used drugs, Bennett has answered enigmatically. But friends in 
touch with Bennett while this article was being prepared insisted that Bennett 
had never even smoked marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
When marijuana first became apparent at Nueces House, "we tried to keep the 
place drug free," said Watson, his roommate at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Watson said Bennett pushed successfully for a house policy banning public drug 
use, telling residents at a house meeting that "this stuff was a foolish risk, 
and one that could not be afforded individually or as an organization." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not a Vigilante 
</P>
<P>
But other former residents do not recall Bennett as an anti-drug champion. "I 
never remember him leading a gang of anti-drug vigilantes or speaking out 
against the virtues of pot," Rindy said. 
</P>
<P>
No one disputes that Bennett -- not known then or now for a tolerant demeanor 
-- grew progressively more uncomfortable at Nueces as the year progressed. At 
exam time he moved out to stay with a fellow graduate student, and looked 
forward to leaving Austin for a teaching post at Southern Mississippi 
University in Hattiesburg. 
</P>
<P>
The social isolation of that small Southern town occasionally sent Bennett 
fleeing to New Orleans for a weekend respite of restaurants and bars. But he 
nevertheless found Mississippi exhilarating at the height of the civil rights 
movement, and friends say his time there redoubled his commitment to that 
cause. 
</P>
<P>
When Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was shot in Memphis, Tenn., Bennett was one of 
a small group of whites to attend a memorial service in Hattiesburg. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, the year in Mississippi served also to "jell 
(Bennett's) own conservative view of things," said Lowe. "Here were people who 
might be wrong about racial matters, but without drugs, could work and study 
without distraction." 
</P>
<P>
Amid what came later, Lowe and others said, Bennett would yearn out loud for 
the values of Hattiesburg. Moving on to Harvard Law School, Bennett 
increasingly found himself to be the odd man out. He stood as a stubborn symbol 
of stability in the Harvard freshman dormitory he supervised as proctor. 
</P>
<P>
To John Curlutte, a newly arriving freshman from rural Illinois, Bennett seemed 
"the only clean-shaven guy in Harvard Yard" amid a sea of "guitars, long hair, 
drugs." Under Bennett's wing that year, conservative students mounted the first 
panty raid on Radcliffe that anyone could remember and once tried to block an 
SDS demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
That was hardly the Cambridge norm. "Pot smoking was quite prevalent," 
remembers David Lhow, another member of that class. And when Bennett learned 
that two freshmen in his dormitory were peddling heroin, he persuaded reluctant 
Harvard administrators to suspend them, according to an account provided by his 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Loved to Party 
</P>
<P>
While his attitude on drugs was hardening, his stand on parties was 
unthreatened. Dormitory students recall vividly the Saturday night beer blasts 
that Bennett regularly hosted, spending university funds to supply underage 
freshmen. By morning, Lhow said, hallways were "ankle-deep in beer cans." 
</P>
<P>
In an era of Woodstock, they also remembered Bennett for his collection of 
classic rock 'n' roll -- his emblem since the mid-'60s, when revolutions in 
rock left him mourning "the day the music died," a friend said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, while Matthews Hall stereos blared tapes of Woodstock performances by 
Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin for months after the concert, Bennett would voice 
displeasure, and could muster enthusiasm only for the Woodstock performance of 
Sha Na Na -- a '50s revival group. 
</P>
<P>
For Bennett, that music served as a symbol of a purer past, of beers and onion 
rings at Split Rail in Austin while listening to the Hootenanny Hoots. 
</P>
<P>
Now, after more than 20 years, the values that once rendered Bennett an 
exception in his generation have emerged dominant again, elevating him to a 
status in which he is well-placed to promote them. 
</P>
<P>
It is a sign of how drastically the tide has turned, however, that even 
Bennett's staunch record does not lift him beyond question. The mere fact of 
having associated with drug users now makes his friends defensive. 
</P>
<P>
For example, there is the future drug czar's most infamous assignation: a 
"blind date" with Janis Joplin that he has told friends about for years. The 
woman who arranged it said Joplin and Bennett spent less than an hour drinking 
and talking during a summertime gathering at a "party barn" outside Austin. 
</P>
<P>
A few months later, Joplin died of a heroin overdose. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about such elements in Bennett's past, one of his friends, Richard 
Sorenson, drafted and read out a formal statement: 
</P>
<P>
"Bill was a big fan of Elvis Presley," it said. "But in those days, we didn't 
know about Elvis' drug habits."

U.S. FAR OFF ON TROOP ESTIMATES IN CUBA CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN FISHER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. officials weighing a possible invasion of Cuba at the height of the 1962 
missile crisis were off by a factor of four in their estimate of Soviet troop 
strength on the island and underestimated the number of Cubans under arms by 
about 60%, it was revealed here Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"We estimated that (the Soviets) had around 10,000 men there and that the 
Cubans had around 100,000 men under arms," former U.S. Defense Secretary Robert 
S. McNamara said at a news conference wrapping up an unprecedented meeting of 
Cuban Missile Crisis participants here. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Cuban and Soviet officials revealed, there were more than 40,000 
Soviet troops on the island and 270,000 armed Cubans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Fight to Death' 
</P>
<P>
"The entire people was ready to fight to the death," said Jorge Risket Valdes, 
a member of the Politburo of Cuba's ruling Communist Party and leader of 
Havana's delegation at the extraordinary Moscow meeting. 
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that Cuba had expected to lose as many as 800,000 people if 
the United States attacked. 
</P>
<P>
"The figures they gave show it would have been a real war if we had gone in," 
added Graham T. Allison, dean of Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of 
Government. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's disclosures were only the latest of several surprises at the 
conference, which was organized jointly by the Soviets and officials of 
Harvard's Nuclear Crisis Project. On Saturday it was confirmed that the Soviets 
already had nuclear warheads in Cuba at the time of the dramatic 1962 showdown 
and that the intermediate-range missiles on which they were to be mounted were 
aimed at Washington, New York and other U.S. cities. 
</P>
<P>
While several conference participants credited the common sense of the late 
President John F. Kennedy and then-Soviet leader Nikita S. Khrushchev for 
avoiding a nuclear conflict that seemed dangerously near, Theodore C. Sorensen, 
former special counsel to Kennedy, offered a different view Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mistaken Assumptions 
</P>
<P>
Sorensen said that he had drawn up a list of 10 mistaken assumptions by parties 
to the crisis that were revealed during three days of formal and informal 
meetings here. 
</P>
<P>
"The value of this conference to me," he concluded, "is not proving how wise we 
all were, but how fallible we all were." 
</P>
<P>
McNamara recalled in a closing statement that a Soviet participant had confided 
his decision to evacuate his family to the country at the height of the 1962 
crisis for fear of a U.S. nuclear strike on Moscow. "And at the same time in 
Washington, on a beautiful fall evening, as I left the President's office to 
return to the Pentagon, I thought I might never live to see another Saturday 
night," McNamara added. 
</P>
<P>
What the conference underlined, the former defense secretary said, is that "in 
this nuclear age, crisis management is dangerous, difficult, uncertain. . . . 
Therefore we must direct our attention to crisis avoidance." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Leap of Imagination' 
</P>
<P>
The superpowers "have made little progress" in that direction despite the 26 
years that have passed since the Cuban crisis, McNamara said, but he added that 
they now have "the greatest opportunity since the end of World War II to 
reformulate our relations." 
</P>
<P>
It would require "a leap of imagination for us to conceive of our national 
roles in a world not dominated by the struggle between East and West," but both 
nations need such a vision, McNamara said. "Conflicts within and conflicts 
between nations will not disappear," he said. But the superpowers could assure 
that they would not be nearly so dangerous if they would agree that: "Neither 
would seek to take advantage of such disputes to increase or extend their 
political or military power beyond their borders, and their bilateral relations 
would be conducted according to rules of conduct which precluded the use of 
force." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scars Run Deep 
</P>
<P>
The fact that such prominent personalities on all three sides of the 1962 
crisis could for the first time sit down with one another to discuss it was 
hailed as a sign of significant progress. But Sunday's news conference also 
showed that the scars still run deep. 
</P>
<P>
Cuban delegation leader Risket repeatedly threw verbal jabs at the Americans 
for maintaining a hostile policy toward his country and, in a more surprising 
move, leveled rare public criticism at Cuba's Soviet allies over the fact that 
Havana was never consulted before Khrushchev finally pulled his missiles out of 
Cuba.

BONN JOLTED AS RIGHTISTS GAIN IN W. BERLIN VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

MUNICH, West Germany 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The center-right government of West Berlin suffered a severe defeat in a 
city-state election Sunday that saw an unexpectedly strong showing by a 
far-right party known as the Republicans, which campaigned on an anti-foreigner 
platform. 
</P>
<P>
Voters gave governing Mayor Eberhard Diepgen's conservative Christian Democrats 
only 36.9% -- a slump of nearly 10 percentage points from the last election 
four years ago. It lost 22 seats in the outgoing 144-seat West Berlin 
legislature. 
</P>
<P>
The junior partner in the Berlin ruling coalition, the liberal Free Democrats, 
failed to gather the necessary minimum 5% and lost their 12 seats in the Berlin 
legislature. But the left-wing Alternative List, West Berlin's version of West 
Germany's Greens party, held on to its 15 seats in the legislature with 11.5% 
of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear Sunday night whether Mayor Diepgen could continue 
in office, although political observers speculated that he might form a 
so-called grand coalition with the opposition Social Democratic Party, which 
polled 38%. 
</P>
<P>
The results shook the Christian Democrats in the capital of Bonn, and West 
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said late Sunday that it was a "heavy election 
defeat." 
</P>
<P>
The big surprise, and one that worried many West German political observers, is 
the newly won power of the Republicans -- an extremist group that has a 
national membership of about 7,000. The national chairman is Franz Schoenhuber, 
a former officer in Adolf Hitler's elite SS troops, who had to resign a post 
with Bavarian radio when he wrote a book glorifying his Nazi past. The party 
leader in West Berlin is Bernhard Andres, a 37-year-old policeman. 
</P>
<P>
"Today the Germans have shown again the need for a democratically-purified 
patriotism," Schoenhuber said on West German television after the returns were 
in. 
</P>
<P>
His party polled 8.5% of the vote, well over the 5% needed for representation 
in the legislature, and was awarded 11 seats. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that the far-right Republicans, founded in 1983 in 
Bavaria, had reached the 5% mark and gained representation in a state election. 
West Berlin, like Hamburg and Bremen, has the status of a state, but it is not 
a fully integrated part of West Germany as a result of post-World War II 
agreements. 
</P>
<P>
The Republicans were originally created as a far-right alternative to the 
conservative Christian Social Union, the Bavarian sister party of the national 
Christian Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Failed in Other States 
</P>
<P>
Since then, they have run in other West German state elections but failed to 
poll the necessary 5% for representation in the legislatures. 
</P>
<P>
The coalition of Christian Democrats and Free Democrats had governed West 
Berlin since 1983, and Diepgen had been expected to lead the two parties to 
another victory Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Diepgen, 47, said the results were a "real surprise" and called the 
Republicans' showing "catastrophe." 
</P>
<P>
West Berlin Social Democratic leader Walter Momper said the success of the 
Republicans will damage West Berlin's international image. 
</P>
<P>
When Republican party leaders arrived at Berlin City Hall for postelection 
statements Sunday night, they were called "Nazis" by protesters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Law and Order 
</P>
<P>
Like France's far-right party, the Republicans campaigned for law and order and 
against drug abuse and foreign workers. 
</P>
<P>
West Berlin has 150,000 Turkish residents, the largest such community outside 
Turkey, who make up about 10% of the city's population. 
</P>
<P>
Strong Republican support came from West Berlin working class districts, 
political analysts said, where unemployment is high and competition for jobs 
stiff. 
</P>
<P>
The election was viewed as a setback to the political fortunes of Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
In elections held in eight states since national balloting returned Kohl to 
office two years ago, the Christian Democrats have lost support in six.

GOVERNOR TO BUSH: KEEP TAX PLEDGE, ASK EUROPE TO PAY MORE FOR DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian declared Sunday that President Bush should live up to 
his campaign promise and resist pressure to raise taxes, asserting a tax 
increase could "trigger a worldwide recession." 
</P>
<P>
The governor also gently lectured his largely European audience at an 
international economic conference here that, if Europe were to shoulder more of 
the burden of its own defense, the United States could cut military spending 
and reduce its budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian further suggested that the Bush Administration and Congress restore 
tax-deductible individual retirement accounts (IRAs) for all taxpayers, a 
casualty of the 1986 tax reform. This would stimulate savings, generating 
capital for investment and reducing the flow of U.S. consumer dollars overseas, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Republican governor's adamant anti-tax posture was not shared by two fellow 
members of his panel: U.S. Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.), a member of the Senate 
Finance Committee, and John A. Young, president and chief executive officer of 
Hewlett-Packard Co. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, what do I think we should do?" Bradley asked rhetorically. "I 
think we should cut spending. I think we should pass a gasoline tax and have an 
increase in cigarette taxes, in the neighborhood of $25 (billion) to $30 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
"I, however, would not advocate that in the United States publicly, because I 
am a Democrat." 
</P>
<P>
Recalling that Democratic presidential nominee Walter F. Mondale was hurt 
politically in 1984 by promising voters a tax increase, and that Bush was 
helped in 1988 by vowing not to raise taxes, Bradley -- himself considered to 
be a potential White House aspirant -- said: "I, therefore, as a Democrat do 
not want to play 'Fool' in George Bush's drama." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concern Over Trade 
</P>
<P>
Martin Feldstein, who was Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser in his first 
presidential term, advocated a further weakening of the dollar by 10% to 15% in 
order to make U.S. exports less expensive abroad and more attractive to foreign 
consumers. He insisted that this is the only way to substantially reduce the 
nagging U.S. trade deficit, estimated to have been $136 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
The four-member panel expounded on "the U.S. world role after the elections" 
before several hundred attendees to the annual conference of the World Economic 
Forum. People shell out registration fees of $4,000 to $8,000 to attend this 
weeklong conference at a ski resort in the Swiss Alps. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian, here for three days, freely acknowledged that he is "not an expert 
in international economics." He said he came as governor of a state with the 
sixth-largest economy in the world -- and as a campaigner for Bush who "saw 
firsthand which issues made a difference with the voters and which did not." 
</P>
<P>
"Make no mistake, there was indeed a mandate in the vote for President," the 
governor asserted. "(Americans) voted for the candidate who told them without 
hesitation that taxes should not be increased." 
</P>
<P>
Bush's chief of staff, John H. Sununu, recently suggested that the no-tax 
pledge might have to bend if an adverse economic "climate" were created by 
failure to significantly reduce the nation's $155-billion budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
But Deukmejian urged Bush indirectly to stick by his guns. 
</P>
<P>
"I know the conventional wisdom says that a tax increase is the answer," 
Deukmejian commented, adding: "The deficit can and must be reduced by 
controlling spending. We cannot risk triggering a worldwide recession through a 
major tax increase." 
</P>
<P>
And bringing up a sensitive subject, Deukmejian said: "Many have suggested that 
we further limit defense spending. That can be done if our allies, who want us 
to reduce the deficit, agree to a greater sharing of the burden of maintaining 
our defenses around the world." 
</P>
<P>
Roughly half the U.S. military budget currently is devoted to the defense of 
Europe. And many in Washington -- Democrats and Republicans -- have been 
demanding increased "burden-sharing" by the other North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization countries. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian also said the U.S. government "should work toward a tax system that 
penalizes debt and encourages savings -- and not the other way around." 
</P>
<P>
Asked later to elaborate in an audience question-and-answer session, Deukmejian 
said that abolishing tax credits for IRAs "was a very unwise move." And he said 
they should be reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian also denounced as "very, very poor policy" the controversial idea 
recently floated by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady of taxing savings and 
checking accounts to help finance bailouts in the savings and loan industry. 
</P>
<P>
"That would be completely contrary to encouraging savings," Deukmejian said. "I 
hope it does not receive any kind of support in Washington."

PROBE FINDS 'SHOCKING' CORRUPTION; 
</P>
<P>
SENATE TO AIR PROBLEMS IN INDIAN AFFAIRS

<P>
Indian programs run by the federal government are riddled with "shocking" 
corruption, including contract fraud, organized crime and sexual abuse of 
children, the chairman of a special Senate investigating panel said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), who heads the Select Committee on Indian 
Affairs investigations subcommittee, also said in an interview that the problem 
of illegal gambling involving Indians "seems to be especially bad in 
California." 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials said that of an estimated 110 illegal gaming operations being 
run on reservations nationwide, a substantial number are in California, where 
the Indian population of 210,000 is the largest of any state. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Payoffs for Contracts 
</P>
<P>
DeConcini said a yearlong investigation by the committee, which is to open 
hearings on its findings today, uncovered widespread instances of contractors 
paying large sums to tribal leaders and federal employees in order to do 
business on tribal lands. The hearings will feature secretly taped 
conversations with an Indian leader who allegedly incriminated himself. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the investigators found numerous "shell companies" set up by non-Indians 
to take advantage of federal programs under which minority firms are awarded 
government contracts, DeConcini said. He said there is "a great amount of fraud 
being perpetrated" by non-Indian firms pretending to be run by Indians. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the investigations, DeConcini said, "is to find out whether 
Indian programs are getting to Indians and to document the waste of taxpayers' 
money." The findings "are going to be shocking," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In setting up the investigation last year, Congress was reacting to news 
accounts in Arizona of widespread abuses in the $3-billion federal system of 
aid to American Indians, many of whom are impoverished. The corruption, 
lawmakers said, has resulted in Indian communities losing millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2 Series of Hearings 
</P>
<P>
Hearings into the alleged corruption are to last two to three weeks. Then, 
after a scheduled break, the committee plans further hearings into what 
DeConcini called "the very complex problems" of managing natural resources on 
Indian lands. Among the issues involved will be an inventory of oil and gas and 
drainage and an examination of the "lack of accountability" for the way federal 
programs are being run, DeConcini said. The second series of hearings is 
expected to begin in April. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the hearings opening today, the senator said the investigators 
found a "very discouraging" number of "sexual abuses of Indian children in 
schools run by the Bureau of Indian Affairs," the Interior Department agency 
that administers federal assistance programs for the nation's 1.4 million 
American Indians. Moreover, DeConcini added, the bureau has shown a "lack of 
any swift response to complaints." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Indian Agents Defended 
</P>
<P>
Carl Shaw of the Bureau of Indian Affairs defended its work force of 15,000 
people, 82% of whom are Indians. He said most of them are "dedicated employees 
who are trying to improve life on reservations." 
</P>
<P>
Shaw said some Indians may be corrupt, but he likened the hundreds of tribal 
leaders around the country to the officials of state and city governments, 
saying many of them also have been proven to be corrupt. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know what the Senate committee has uncovered," he said. "We have 
cooperated fully with the investigation, and I hope if there is any wrongdoing, 
those wrongdoers will pay for what they have done wrong."

PENTECOSTALS BACK FOUNDER ON FINANCES

<P>
Ending an acrimonious battle in a well-known Pentecostal body, the board of the 
Full Gospel Business Men's Fellowship International on Sunday voted 
overwhelmingly to absolve its founder-president of "supposed improper practice" 
in financial matters. 
</P>
<P>
Directors of the Costa Mesa-based worldwide fellowship voted 79 to 17, with two 
abstentions, to "vindicate" 75-year-old Demos Shakarian. The board also 
restored his full authority as president. The actions, in effect, repudiated 
charges made by the board's audit committee. 
</P>
<P>
The committee -- acting to protect the nonprofit body's tax-exempt status, they 
said -- had informed the Internal Revenue Service last year that Shakarian 
received $276,000 in unreported benefits and undocumented expenses that would 
have to be counted as income, from 1981 to 1987. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Claims of Authority 
</P>
<P>
But Shakarian's backers have insisted that insurance and disability-related 
benefits were board authorized and that his travel expenses could be nearly all 
accounted for. 
</P>
<P>
Shakarian said the accusations against him arose from a bid for control of the 
fellowship by a 15-man executive committee of the board. 
</P>
<P>
But Bill Weaver of Oklahoma City, one of the board members accused of engaging 
in a power play, said there was no vindictiveness involved. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm simply saying his bookkeeping is atrocious," Weaver said in a voice loud 
enough to be heard in the hall outside the closed meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Executive Vice President Gene Ellerbee said he assured board members that 
Shakarian, a millionaire with extensive property holdings, will take 
responsibility for any money he might owe the IRS. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pioneer Figure 
</P>
<P>
Shakarian is considered one of the pioneers in spreading the Pentecostal 
version of Christianity, which is distinguished by speaking in tongues, healing 
claims and belief in everyday occurrences of the supernatural. 
</P>
<P>
The now-retired dairyman started the fellowship in 1952 at lunch meetings with 
business and professional men in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The noontime exchanges of stories of faith became a feature of chapters around 
the world, thus blunting the previous image of Pentecostalism as appealing only 
to uneducated Christians low on the socioeconomic scale. 
</P>
<P>
Shakarian, partly disabled by a stroke in 1984, was nevertheless vigorous in 
speaking briefly to board members during the daylong debate Sunday. He 
alternately threatened to quit and urged them to settle the two-year-old 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
"If I take a walk, what will you do?" Shakarian was heard to ask. 
</P>
<P>
Income from donors in about 96 countries where the fellowship has chapters has 
dropped from about $6.5 million in 1986 to just below $4 million in 1988, 
fellowship officials say. 
</P>
<P>
But Shakarian said a full vote of confidence from the board, which is what he 
received Sunday, was all that was needed to get the group back on track.

A West German businessman said Sunday he plans to set up a base in Britain 
selling kidneys for transplant. 
</P>
<P>
Rainer Adelmann, who already carries out the trade in France and West Germany, 
said transplant patients would have to pay between $26,000 to $52,000 per 
kidney. 
</P>
<P>
"I take only 20%," Adelmann told Independent Television News. 
</P>
<P>
Controversy erupted earlier this month in Britain when poor Turks were reported 
to have been paid $3,500 to donate their kidneys. 
</P>
<P>
Adelmann's plans to start business in Britain were condemned by the National 
Kidney Research Fund.

DEATH OF AN ALLY BRINGS CHINA NEW PROBLEMS IN TIBET

<P>
The sudden death of the Panchen Lama, the second-highest-ranking Tibetan 
religious leader, confronts China with a new crisis as it continues to try to 
defuse pro-independence sentiment in Tibet. 
</P>
<P>
Even the anchorman on the national television news seemed to recognize its 
implications when he called the 50-year-old Panchen Lama's death of a heart 
attack Saturday a "heavy loss" for China. 
</P>
<P>
The late spiritual and political leader was the most effective spokesman for 
China's current policy in Tibet, which stresses a limited revival of religious 
freedom together with emphasis that the region must remain under Chinese 
control. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Successor Must Be Discovered 
</P>
<P>
The deceased leader's successor, by Tibetan tradition, will be a baby boy born 
within the next few years who must be discovered by religious elders as his 
predecessor's "reincarnation" and then sent to a monastery for training before 
finally being installed formally as the next Panchen Lama. Thus, for nearly two 
decades, until that child approaches adulthood, it will be impossible for a 
successor to play the same role as the late leader. 
</P>
<P>
The exiled Dalai Lama, Tibet's highest-ranking religious leader, has long 
espoused Tibetan independence, although he modified that stance last year by 
saying that he could accept Chinese control of Tibet's foreign relations. 
</P>
<P>
Over the centuries, Tibet has sometimes been independent and sometimes a part 
of the Chinese empire. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the Dalai Lama, led by strongly nationalistic monks, have staged 
a series of pro-independence protests in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa over the 
past 16 months. Three of these demonstrations ended with police firing into 
crowds of protesters. Chinese authorities fear that further protests may break 
out in the weeks ahead. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rioting Erupted Last Year 
</P>
<P>
The annual Monlam festival, which begins next month, ended in anti-Chinese 
rioting last year. March is the 30th anniversary of the 1959 Tibetan uprising 
that resulted in the Dalai Lama's fleeing to exile in India. Violence could 
occur in connection with either anniversary. It is rumored among foreigners in 
Lhasa that Tibetans have stolen a quantity of weapons from Chinese security 
forces and that these might be used in connection with pro-independence 
protests. 
</P>
<P>
The late Panchen Lama was not widely adored like the Dalai Lama, but he was 
respected by most Tibetans as an important religious figure. After spending 
nearly a decade imprisoned or under house arrest during the 1966-76 Cultural 
Revolution, he reemerged as an advocate of both religious and economic 
development in Tibet. He was able to argue with some effectiveness that 
Tibetans should devote their energy to activity in these fields rather than a 
struggle for independence. 
</P>
<P>
The Panchen Lama was an acceptable leader both to Beijing and the Tibetan 
people, a diplomat in Beijing said. 
</P>
<P>
"He will be very hard to replace," the diplomat commented. "I know of no one of 
comparable stature who can take his place." 
</P>
<P>
The late Panchen Lama was the 10th in a line that is believed by Tibetans to 
have been reincarnations of the Amitabha Buddha, or Buddha of Infinite Light. 
</P>
<P>
In a dispatch from the Tibetan city of Xigaze, where the Panchen Lama died only 
a few days after presiding over a major religious ceremony, the official New 
China News Agency indicated that the tradition of discovering a reincarnated 
successor will be carried on. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prayers for 'Early Incarnation' 
</P>
<P>
After reporting that top political authorities of Tibet paid their last 
respects Sunday to the dead leader, the news agency added that monks at the 
Tashilhunpo Monastery chanted prayers "praising the Panchen Lama for his 
outstanding achievements and wishing him an early incarnation." 
</P>
<P>
Several other official statements of praise and grief also were released 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The Panchen Lama was "a great patriot, noted statesman, devoted friend of the 
Chinese Communist Party and outstanding leader of Tibetan Buddhism in China," 
according to an official obituary issued by the Standing Committee of the 
National People's Congress and summarized by the news agency. The Panchen Lama 
was a vice chairman of the congress. 
</P>
<P>
The State Council, China's equivalent of a Cabinet, released a message of 
condolence expressing "extremely deep grief over his death."

MANILA STILL WARY OF MARCOS RETURN; 
</P>
<P>
DEAD OR ALIVE, EX-CHIEF COULD CAUSE PROBLEMS FOR AQUINO

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gone from the Philippines for nearly three years, Ferdinand E. Marcos still 
casts a shadow that touches both president and peasant. 
</P>
<P>
Manila's master of politics and intrigue for a generation, the ailing Marcos, 
confined for the third time in two months to a Honolulu hospital, is watched as 
warily as when he presided in Malacanang Palace. 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose that . . . the racketeering charge (brought against Marcos in a New 
York federal court) would make an ordinary, normal person sick," mused a 
suspicious Senate President Jovito R. Salonga. "But there is no doubt in my 
mind also that the former president is trying to avoid having to go through the 
rigors of a trial." 
</P>
<P>
Distrust fills the Cabinet of President Corazon Aquino. When Marcos suffered a 
collapsed lung 10 days ago, Aquino's ministers met in crisis session to discuss 
whether, even dead, Marcos should be allowed to return to his homeland. 
</P>
<P>
"Marcos was an elemental personality," noted his former labor minister, Blas 
Ople, adding wryly, "Cory (Aquino) would want to be reassured that he is really 
dead." 
</P>
<P>
More and more, the coffee-shop comments about Marcos end in brief eulogies. 
</P>
<P>
Teodoro Locsin Jr., Aquino's former speech writer, remarking on the fixation on 
hospital reports from Honolulu, concluded: "Whether we were his enemies or his 
cronies, Marcos helped shape the lives of all of us. When he dies, a part of 
everyone dies along with him." 
</P>
<P>
For Juan Ponce Enrile, who had been Marcos' martial-law administrator and then 
turned against him in a military mutiny that brought Aquino to power in 
February, 1986, the response was not speculative. 
</P>
<P>
The waitress in a restaurant had just taken his order when a call came for him. 
It was important, an aide said, and Enrile rushed off. When he returned to the 
table moments later, Enrile was shaken. His voice cracked as he related the 
news, which turned out to be premature. 
</P>
<P>
"President Marcos is dead," Enrile said flatly. "My God!" His eyes mirroring 
his mood, he murmured, "It is sad that he had to die in a foreign land." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Official Position 
</P>
<P>
Officially, the Aquino government's position is that for "reasons of national 
interest" Marcos will not be allowed to return to the Philippines, at least not 
yet. 
</P>
<P>
Salonga, the first chairman of the president's Commission on Good Government, 
who doggedly put together the Philippine case against Marcos for theft of 
government funds, takes a slightly more open view. 
</P>
<P>
"If Marcos decides to do a Chun Doo Hwan (the former South Korean president), 
that is, make a public apology, seek our people's forgiveness and restore his 
ill-gotten wealth," he might be allowed to return, Salonga said recently. 
"There will be enough time for the former president and his lawyers to initiate 
a plea-bargaining process . . . with the New York courts and prosecutors . . . 
authorities in Washington and the government of the Philippines." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aquino Has Four Options 
</P>
<P>
As the politicians read it, the Aquino government is faced with four options, 
none without problems: Marcos could be permitted to return to the Philippines 
to live out his days; he could be allowed to return briefly to preside over the 
funeral of his mother, who, in what a priest of her province called "the 
longest wake in history," remains unburied more than eight months after her 
death; he could be allowed to die in exile, then be returned for his own 
burial; or he could never be allowed to return, dead or alive. 
</P>
<P>
Legalistic- and protocol-minded Filipinos have been poring over foreign 
historical precedents for all the options, since the Philippines has never 
faced a situation like this. 
</P>
<P>
The concentration centers on political options, since many politicians here 
believe the former president's legal problems could somehow be worked out, 
based in part on unconfirmed reports from Honolulu that Marcos' lawyers are 
floating various schemes to do just that. One report making the rounds in 
Manila says that Marcos has signed or will sign quitclaims to the accumulated 
money, turning over ownership to an international trust to be based in Britain. 
What the trust would do for Marcos is unclear. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Consent Decree Suggested 
</P>
<P>
"With regard to the money," Ople said, raising another option, "perhaps there 
could be something like what you Americans call a consent decree, a return of 
the funds with no admission of guilt." 
</P>
<P>
But many politicians here, speculating widely since Marcos' lung collapsed, say 
the political considerations are more important in the consultations at 
Malacanang. Defense Minister Fidel V. Ramos is reported to be the voice of 
caution in the Cabinet on the question of letting Marcos return alive. 
</P>
<P>
Ramos, who harbors presidential ambitions himself, is in a difficult postion. 
He not only joined Enrile in the 1986 mutiny that overthrew Marcos, he also is 
the former president's second cousin. In Laoag City, the capital of Marcos' 
native Ilocos del Norte province, provincial leaders said last week that the 
Ilocano people will never forgive Ramos. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No Loyalists Here' 
</P>
<P>
The provincial governor, Rudolfo Farinas, who was a close friend and political 
ally of Marcos' son, said he would anticipate no trouble in the Ilocano region 
if the ousted president were allowed to return to his political stronghold in 
the north. "He's had his time," insisted Farinas, discounting speculation that 
pro-Marcos loyalists might rally around their 71-year-old leader and pose a 
threat to Aquino's government. "There are no loyalists here," he said. "The 
people here love him, but the loyalists are in Manila." 
</P>
<P>
Castor Raval, a Laoag lawyer who for 20 years carried on a long and lonely 
opposition to Marcos in Ilocos del Norte, agrees. "He has no more political 
clout," the lawyer said. "Even the former beneficiaries of his bounty are now 
working with the Aquino government." 
</P>
<P>
But if Marcos comes back to Laoag in a coffin, Farinas and other Ilocanos say, 
there could be serious trouble. "There are always rabble-rousers who will make 
it an issue," the governor noted. Tempers could run high at the burial. As Ople 
said, in a remark he attributed to Enrile, "If Ramos goes, the Ilocanos might 
bury him alongside Marcos." And under Ilocano custom, Ramos, as a second 
cousin, would be expected to attend Marcos' funeral. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opposes Death in Exile 
</P>
<P>
Gov. Farinas said he personally believes death in exile for Marcos "would be 
inhumane." But many Ilocanos consider equally inhumane Marcos' refusal to 
permit the burial of his mother. 
</P>
<P>
The old woman, who died last May 4 at age 95, lies in a glass-topped coffin in 
a former Marcos family home in the town of Batac outside Laoag. Last week, 
hundreds of schoolchildren, bused in from the nearby towns of Marcos (named for 
the former president's father) and Espiritu, filed by the casket, momentarily 
somber on a school outing. 
</P>
<P>
In a chair against a wall, dressed in black, sat Fortuna Barba, Marcos' 
57-year-old sister, keeping vigil as she has since her mother died. "It's the 
Ilocano custom that the head of the family should bury our dead," she told a 
visiting reporter. So far Marcos, the head of his family, has not given 
permission for Barba to violate the code of the north and bury their mother in 
his absence. 
</P>
<P>
In Manila, Marcos' enemies say the former president is playing a cruel 
political game with the body of Dona Josefa, trying to force Aquino to approve 
his return for the burial. But Barba remains loyal, despite the ordeal of her 
eight-month vigil. "We don't see it that way," she said.

VICTORY! AUCTION IS A THRILLER

Donna Frieden, 34, went shopping Sunday and paid $1,400 for a black fedora. 
</P>
<P>
"This was my birthday present, my Christmas present and my anniversary 
present," the Sherman Oaks voice-over artist said. "I'm not going to buy any 
clothes for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
This was not just any hat, mind you. This particular headpiece belonged to 
superstar Michael Jackson, and Frieden had long coveted one. Several times she 
came close to catching the trademark fedora that the performer tossed into the 
audience after singing "Billie Jean" in his concerts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Always Wanted His Hat 
</P>
<P>
"I have always wanted to catch the hat at his concerts, but it always went to 
the person in front of me or next to me. I've always wanted it so badly," said 
Frieden, who attended two concerts in Jackson's 1984 "Victory" tour and three 
during his just concluded "Bad" tour. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not normally star-struck. I don't usually go after things like this, but 
Jackson is such an incredible performer." 
</P>
<P>
Frieden was able to buy her heart's desire at an auction in a North Hollywood 
warehouse where Enid Jackson sold some of the clothing and memorabilia she won 
in a divorce settlement with her ex-husband, Jackie Jackson, Michael's older 
brother. 
</P>
<P>
Enid Jackson said she has "warehouses and warehouses full of stuff," belonging 
to members of the Jackson clan that she plans to sell because she no longer 
wants to pay for its storage and maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
Though Frieden admits that $1,400 is a lot of money to pay for a hat that she 
will be "too afraid to wear in public," she said she and her husband agreed she 
could bid as high as $1,500 for it. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the Jackson-related items at the auction -- including a silver lame 
suit, blue and gold brocade vests, an iridescent jumpsuit, a black and white, 
tiger-skin patterned spandex leotard, a turquoise and rhinestone spandex 
leotard, a number of belts, pairs of boots, and several gold and platinum 
records -- were snapped up by businessmen who hope to capitalize on people's 
attraction to stars. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Memorabilia Shop 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people love anything associated with their favorite artist," said 
Paul Scharfman, who purchased several costumes worn by Michael Jackson's 
brothers during the Victory tour. Scharfman hopes to resell the items at The 
Rock House, a boutique he plans to open on Melrose. 
</P>
<P>
He said he has been planning to open the boutique for 10 years and will feature 
clothes and memorabilia from musical stars. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest purchaser of Jackson memorabilia was Brian Murphy, director of 
memorabilia artwork and display for the Hard Rock Cafe. Murphy spent about 
$12,000 for more than a dozen Jackson items, which he said will be used to 
decorate the cafe's London restaurant, and branches under completion in 
Washington and Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy said he attributes much of the famous restaurant chain's success to the 
power of music memorabilia to draw large numbers of people. 
</P>
<P>
As she watched strangers bidding for costumes she helped design for her 
ex-husband and former brothers-in-law, Enid Jackson took it all in stride. 
</P>
<P>
"I have pictures and I have memories that no one can take away," she said.

GRANADA HILLS; 
</P>
<P>
UPGRADE OF BUSINESS AREA URGED 
</P>

<P>
Spanish colonial-style architecture and more parking spaces are called for in a 
Los Angeles Planning Department proposal to spruce up the central business 
district of Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
At a public presentation of the proposal late last week, several Granada Hills 
business leaders who helped shape the plan said it is needed to halt the 
decline of the area's aging commercial strip along Chatsworth Street. 
</P>
<P>
"We're at a crossroads here in Granada Hills," said John F. Weitkamp, an 
attorney who served on a citizens committee appointed by City Councilman Hal 
Bernson to advise planners on the proposal. "We're either going to start 
improving the aesthetics of the community, or it's going to erode." 
</P>
<P>
Businesses such as auto parts stores, gyms and take-out restaurants dominate 
the area on Chatsworth Street between Aliso Creek and Encino Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
And several storefronts have become vacant as the strip has had to compete with 
a corner shopping center with ample parking at Devonshire Street and Balboa 
Boulevard, said Ralph Crouch, Bernson's planning deputy. 
</P>
<P>
The plan by the city and Bernson's citizens committee does not call for a 
freeze on development. Such a freeze has been instituted in Reseda's central 
business district and is proposed for Chatsworth's. Instead, the plan calls for 
new development or major renovations to conform to the Spanish colonial 
architectural style. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unifying Element 
</P>
<P>
The architectural theme would "get the community an identity as a unit, rather 
than a bunch of little stores," said Duane R. Feuerhelm, a citizens committee 
member whose automobile dealership is on Chatsworth Street. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea here is to finally set some kind of standard for Granada Hills," said 
John Ciccarelli, another member of the committee and a past president of the 
Granada Hills Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal also calls for several lots behind the Chatsworth Street 
businesses to be used for parking. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, planners hope the business owners or others would buy the 
properties and convert them into lots for paid parking, said Michael J. 
O'Connor, a city planner in charge of the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor conceded at Thursday's meeting that the plan is optimistic, but he 
added that a dearth of on-street parking has been "the No. 1 problem" for 
businesses on Chatsworth Street. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Business Restrictions 
</P>
<P>
The proposal also lists businesses that would be banned, including pawnshops 
and sexually oriented stores. The commercial area does not have such businesses 
now, O'Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal would not force existing businesses to leave, although new 
businesses in several categories would require conditional-use permits. For 
instance, secondhand clothing stores, drive-through food services and 
automotive businesses would require such permits, O'Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
A public hearing on the plan is scheduled for March 3. The Planning Commission 
and the City Council are expected to consider the proposal by the end of the 
year.

SOLAR CALL BOXES GET HUNG UP IN PATENT DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Installation of emergency call boxes on Ventura County freeways, scheduled for 
April, will be delayed because of a dispute over patent rights, a county 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
Al Knuth, deputy director of the county Public Works Department, said that 
installation of the 390 solar-powered call boxes will be delayed at least until 
July because of legal squabbles between two communications companies that had 
bid on the project. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a disappointment we sure didn't expect," he said in an interview Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Knuth said the county has spent $3,000 to hire an attorney specializing in 
patent law to help settle the disagreement. The attorney, Bernard Kleinke of 
San Diego, is to report to county officials Feb. 22, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In October, the county awarded Cubic Communications Corp. of San Diego a 
contract for nearly $817,000 to install the boxes at quarter- and half-mile 
intervals on six freeways. It rejected a competing bid of about $1 million from 
GTE Cellular Communications Corp. of Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
GTE alleges that allowing Cubic to install the system would be an infringement 
of GTE's patent on the system, which doesn't expire until 2004, Knuth said. 
</P>
<P>
E.A. Hardenburgh, GTE's general manager, said the company would consider 
letting Ventura County use the system for a fee. Hardenburgh would not say how 
much GTE would charge the county. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Burnett, Cubic's chairman, said his firm would "defend any suit GTE wants 
to throw at us." He said that licensing the call-box network "is like licensing 
the wheel" because the technology is not that sophisticated. 
</P>
<P>
A lawsuit, he said, "would not hold up, but it's sure got the politicians 
nervous, so that's why they've delayed the installation." 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County has three call boxes. Two are on the Simi Valley Freeway just 
over the Los Angeles County line. The other is on the southbound side of the 
Ventura Freeway, halfway up a steep incline near Camarillo.

Students and parents from nine San Fernando Valley schools proposed Sunday that 
high school student leaders sit in on contract negotiations between the Los 
Angeles Unified School District and its teachers. The student-parent group, 
frustrated at the drawn-out negotiations, also suggested that board members 
bargain face to face with the teachers union. 
</P>
<P>
"Having senior students sitting in will be a calming influence on the thousands 
of kids" who have picketed and stayed out of classes, said parent Barry 
Pollack. He referred to protests last week at a dozen high schools and three 
junior high schools in the city. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the students' "mere presence will temper heated rhetoric and 
encourage honesty and compromise" between the two sides, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Pollack said that a letter with the recommendations, signed by himself and Todd 
Cobin, the board's student representative, will be delivered today to Supt. 
Leonard Britton, to Wayne Johnson, president of the United Teachers-Los 
Angeles, and to board members. Pollack is running against school board 
President Roberta Weintraub. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Student Opinions 
</P>
<P>
Students should not only attend the negotiations but should also give their 
opinions, said Cobin, who is student body president of Birmingham High School. 
The students are not outsiders but rather "the keynote, the backbone of the 
whole thing," he said. "The board and the teachers are supposed to be working 
for the students." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's meeting in Sherman Oaks drew about 35 parents and students, many of 
whom said the students were being used as pawns in the labor dispute. 
</P>
<P>
The district and teachers union have negotiated for nearly a year. Teachers 
have threated to withhold grades from the district, but they said that they 
would give the fall term grades, due Friday, to students on unofficial report 
cards. 
</P>
<P>
Many students said they support teachers' demands for higher pay. And seniors, 
in particular, said that they want their official grades filed with the 
district because they need them for college admissions. Cobin called the 
situation "academic child abuse." 
</P>
<P>
To pressure the district, several students last week skipped homeroom, where 
attendance is taken, because the district loses $15 a day in state aid for each 
student absent. 
</P>
<P>
Pollack, who has three children in public schools, said he drafted the letter 
because "something's the matter when it takes 1,000 students walking out" to 
call attention to a dispute. He said he had not been able to go to an open 
house in more than a year because of the teachers' boycott of parent 
conferences. 
</P>
<P>
Amanda Walzer, a junior at Grant High School, said a student presence would 
help ensure that the negotiating "is operating and reaching a quick 
compromise." She said she boycotted homeroom last week because "our teachers 
are worth more than they're getting." 
</P>
<P>
Parents agreed that teachers are underpaid. "We've got to pay them like the 
professionals they are," said Philip Reeder, who has two children at Sherman 
Oaks Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
The letter, he said, might "shake the board up a little bit." He said that he 
supported the students' protest because "I come from the '60s" and because the 
protest was "really thought out, peaceful, controlled and the issue is of vital 
importance."

TEXACO PAY-OUT PACT COOLS ICAHN TAKEOVER THREAT; 
</P>
<P>
BIGGEST SHAREHOLDER WOULD GET $336 MILLION OF $1.9-BILLION DISTRIBUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Texaco announced Sunday that corporate raider Carl C. Icahn has agreed to stop 
his threats to take over the energy giant as part of a $1.9-billion pay-out to 
shareholders that would net Icahn an estimated $336 million. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement ends a long-running feud between the nation's third-largest oil 
company and Icahn, the chairman of Trans World Airlines and Texaco's biggest 
shareholder. It also appears to end the immediate threat of a takeover at 
Texaco, according to industry analysts. 
</P>
<P>
The $1.9-billion distribution to stockholders disclosed Sunday is higher than 
the $1.7 billion the company had promised last June. Icahn had threatened to 
launch a bid for control of the company unless the pay-out to shareholders was 
increased. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms disclosed by the company, Texaco will issue two special dividends 
to its shareholders with a value of $8 per share and a total worth of $1.9 
billion. With 16.6% of the company's stock, or about 42 million shares, Icahn's 
portion will be about $336 million. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange, the company said, Icahn entered into a "standstill" agreement in 
which he pledged not to buy additional shares of Texaco stock and to vote his 
existing shares along the same lines as other shareholders. A company 
spokeswoman said the standstill pact will be in effect for seven years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stability Seen 
</P>
<P>
Texaco also said it will buy back $500 million worth of its stock by August, 
1990, bringing to $2.4 billion the price tag of Sunday's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement closes another turbulent chapter for the New York-based oil 
company, which has endured bankruptcy, a $3-billion lawsuit settlement 
connected with its takeover of Getty Oil and the sale of nearly $7 billion 
worth of assets in the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
"The agreement with the Icahn interests should provide a period of stability 
needed for Texaco shareholders," James W. Kinnear, president and chief 
executive of Texaco, said in a statement after the board approved the package 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, a friendly offer from Icahn to buy Texaco was turned down by 
management. He then waged and lost a costly proxy battle last June. Since then, 
Icahn has been increasingly critical of Texaco's management and had been 
preparing for another possible proxy fight. 
</P>
<P>
He said in a recent interview that he had not ruled out a new bid for the 
company. Two weeks ago, he announced that he had increased his stake to 16.6%. 
But in a statement issued by his Mt. Kisco, N.Y., office on Sunday, Icahn 
sounded a conciliatory note and acknowledged that he has entered into the 
standstill agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that top management at Texaco during the last year has done a good job 
in making Texaco leaner and more productive," said Icahn, who has made a 
fortune in recent years by engaging in takeover attempts involving such major 
companies as Philips Petroleum and American Can. 
</P>
<P>
Eugene L. Nowak, a leading oil industry analyst at the New York investment 
house of Dean Witter, said the agreement neutralizes Icahn and provides 
substantial benefit for Texaco shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to eliminate the possibility of a takeover, or at least cuts those 
odds significantly," said Nowak. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called Victory for Kinnear 
</P>
<P>
In addition to not buying more Texaco stock, Icahn agreed to give the company a 
say in how he would dispose of his current holdings, should he decide to do so. 
That presumably would prohibit him from selling out to another raider. 
</P>
<P>
A Texaco spokeswoman characterized the agreement as a victory for Kinnear, and 
industry analysts said Icahn must have decided he could not win a bid to elect 
his slate to the company's board at its annual meeting in May. 
</P>
<P>
The major institutional investors in Texaco apparently had aligned themselves 
with management, as they did in helping to defeat Icahn's proxy bid last year. 
</P>
<P>
Under pressure from Icahn to improve its return to shareholders, Texaco has 
sold off nearly $7 billion in assets in the last year, including a 
$3.24-billion cash deal to sell its interest in Texaco Canada to a subsidiary 
of Exxon Corp. which was announced on Jan. 19. 
</P>
<P>
The cash raised from the sales will be used to pay the special dividends and 
help pay down the company's $8-billion debt if the plan is approved by 
shareholders at the annual meeting in early May. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Improved Prices 
</P>
<P>
If approved, the first special dividend will be $4 per share in three-year 
notes. The second dividend will consist of $3 in cash per share and $1 in a new 
preferred stock. 
</P>
<P>
In June, Kinnear had said Texaco would distribute $1.7 billion to shareholders 
from the proceeds of asset sales. The higher distribution was the result of 
improved prices for some assets along with pressure from Icahn, according to 
analysts. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say in general that, from a shareholder's viewpoint, this is quite 
satisfactory," said Todd L. Bergman, an analyst at the New York investment firm 
of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.

Darkie toothpaste is being renamed and redesigned to remove its logo of a 
grinning black minstrel after several groups complained to Colgate-Palmolive 
Co. that the product was offensive, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
The toothpaste is manufactured and sold in Asia by the Hong Kong-based Hawley 
&amp; Hazel Group. Colgate-Palmolive, which sells household and hygiene 
products worldwide, became a joint partner with Hawley &amp; Hazel in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, some members of Congress and the Interfaith Center on Corporate 
Responsibility, a coalition of church investors, have been putting pressure on 
the companies to change what they said is racially offensive packaging. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Acceptable to Coalition 
</P>
<P>
The popular product, which has remained unchanged for 62 years, will be renamed 
Darlie in all of its markets -- Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and 
Thailand -- within a year, Colgate-Palmolive said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The company said the logo will be changed to a "to a non-racially offensive 
silhouette" -- a racially ambiguous man in a top hat. 
</P>
<P>
"The management of Hawley &amp; Hazel and Colgate-Palmolive have agreed that 
the old name and package presentation represents offensive racial stereotyping 
that should be changed," Colgate-Palmolive said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it's acceptable," said Dara Demmings, a spokesman for the Interfaith 
Coalition, which seeks to influence social and financial issues within 
corporations through stock ownership. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to pressure from the coalition, three Interfaith members who each 
owned at least $1,000 worth of Colgate stock registered objections at a 
shareholders meeting in May. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Decision Praised 
</P>
<P>
The shareholders included the Illinois-based School Sisters of St. Francis; 
Southern Province of the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate in San Antonio, 
and a nun who owns shares for the Sisters of Loretta, based in Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
Similar pressure from outside groups led Quaker Oats Co. to modify its Aunt 
Jemima figure in the 1960s to make her look less like a plantation cook. 
Likewise, complaints led Sambo's restaurant chain to change its name to No 
Place Like Sam's in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Demmings said she believed Colgate-Palmolive officials were hampered by 
objections from Hawley &amp; Hazel, who told a group of congressmen as late as 
last month that it had no plans to change the product's name. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unfortunate that it took so long," said New York Rep. Edolphus Towns, a 
member of the congressional Government Operations Committee, who voiced 
objections to the product during a visit to Taiwan in December. 
</P>
<P>
Towns praised Colgate-Palmolive for making "a diligent effort since day one of 
their relationship (with Hawley) to correct this insensitive name and 
logotype." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, another committee member, praised the 
company "for its understanding, albeit late," and urged other companies to "act 
accordingly."

Swiss authorities ordered bank records linked to the unfolding insider trading 
scandal in France to be turned over to U.S. investigators who uncovered the 
affair. The SEC had asked the Swiss Federal Office of Police Affairs to help in 
the Pechiney-Triangle probe by ordering a suspension of strict banking secrecy 
rules on accounts at five Swiss banks and two financial services companies. The 
affair involves allegations that people with confidential, advance information 
made huge illegal stock market profits when the French state-owned aluminum 
company Pechiney bought out U.S.-based Triangle Industries last November.

TROUBLE FOR YUGO;

DECLINING SALES, FINANCIAL WOES MAKE ROAD ROCKY

In the fall of 1985, Global Motors Inc. introduced American car buyers to a 
Spartan, Yugoslavian-built automobile called the Yugo with a $3,900 price tag. 
The New Jersey firm had hoped it would be the start of a long and profitable 
relationship, a storybook business deal. 
</P>
<P>
But by the time the car was introduced in California a year later, critics were 
calling it "the worst car in America." 
</P>
<P>
And, now, three years later, Global Motors is beset by financial woes, 
plummeting sales and criticism of the Yugo by consumer and safety advocates. 
Global Motors suffered a nearly 35% sales drop in 1988 as Yugo sales plunged to 
31,000, from almost 48,000 in 1987 analysts said. A number of dealerships also 
have severed ties with Global, which imports and markets the cars in the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
This all comes at a time when a number of South Korean and Japanese cars are 
encroaching on Yugo's turf. Yugo's price tag is now closer to $5,000, and 
Ford's South Korean-built Festiva and South Korea's Hyundai Excel are two 
strong contenders in the basic-transportation market. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cost-Cutting Measures 
</P>
<P>
In addition, analysts said, limited resources have delayed the introduction of 
a host of new Yugo models and features, including models equipped with 
automatic transmission and convertibles. 
</P>
<P>
To offset the resulting financial setback, Global has taken major cost-cutting 
measures. A Global vice president acknowledged last week that several dozen 
employees -- a number of top-level executives among them -- were laid off last 
Monday evening. 
</P>
<P>
However, officials at Global, based in Upper Saddle River, N.J., downplayed the 
significance of the move. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Negotiations in New York 
</P>
<P>
"It was prudent to cut back our staffing," said Ronald Hoffman, Global's senior 
vice president for operations. "It's a concept of bringing staffing in line 
with our objective of being a basic-transportation vehicle. It's no different 
than what other companies do." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a search for more capital, Global executives were in New York 
City last week for negotiations with officials of Zavodi Crvena Zastava, the 
car's Yugoslav manufacturer, and an announcement is expected soon. Auto 
industry observers expect Zastava to buy all or part of Global and provide the 
American company with a a much-needed infusion of cash. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Meeting 'Crucial' 
</P>
<P>
"The Yugoslavians have told us they are interested in remaining in the U.S. 
market," said Hoffman. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe the meeting is crucial," said Chris Cedergren, an automotive analyst 
at J.D. Power and Associates in Agoura Hills. "The current owners, Mabon, 
Nugent &amp; Co. are looking for funding. When they bought out Global founder 
Malcolm Bricklin last year, they expected business to be different." Among 
other things, Cedergren said, they spent huge sums to beef up the marketing of 
the car. 
</P>
<P>
"That," he said, "was a costly proposition. It was a wise move, but the market 
did not act to the tune they had hoped . . . Between 1985 and the present, 
Global has lost a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, many car buyers were discouraged from buying the Yugo early on. In 
February, 1986, Consumer Reports said "it is hard to recommend the Yugo at any 
price." Two years later it called the Yugo "one of the worst cars" it has ever 
tested. Almost from its introduction, the Yugo was branded a shoddily built 
vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
"The car was not very good when it came to the U.S.," said Maryann N. Keller, 
an analyst at Furman Selz Mager Dietz &amp; Birney investment firm in New York 
City. "It had many, many quality problems -- many of which have been 
corrected." 
</P>
<P>
Sales of the car continue to feel the reverberations of the initial criticisms, 
so much so that some dealers across the country are backing away from the Yugo. 
</P>
<P>
"We terminated our franchise about four months ago," said Stan Krajenke, who 
owns a car dealership in Detroit. "Sales were not going too good. The bad rap 
in the beginning was one of the main reasons why." 
</P>
<P>
"Our renewal came up in August, but we didn't renew," said Ken Shepherd, the 
general manager of O'Donnell Motors in San Gabriel. "The Yugos just weren't 
moving. We bought in because we thought it was a viable franchise . . . Without 
a doubt, it was the most serious business mistake we've ever made. I wish 
someone would have warned us before we signed."

has ruled. U.S. District Judge Ilana Rovner set the stage for a hearing on 
damages with her ruling last week. No date for the hearing was set, but lawyers 
for both sides are scheduled to meet with Rovner this Wednesday and decide how

ASIAN FIRMS HOPE TO RAISE THEIR PROFILES AMONG AMERICAN CONSUMERS

Getting noticed is not always easy. Just ask the people at Samsung Group. 
</P>
<P>
The South Korean company began a campaign about 10 years ago to make American 
consumers aware of its household wares -- like microwave ovens, television sets 
and videocassette recorders -- that were primarily sold under the names of more 
well-known makers. Now the Samsung brand appears on products sold in pricey 
department stores and promoted with $8 million worth of annual advertising. 
</P>
<P>
The results? A consumer survey last summer showed that most people were still 
unfamiliar with Samsung. "When you mention the name to people," said company 
spokesman Richard Leister, "it raises a question mark. There is still a bit of 
work to be done in order to build the national awareness of Samsung." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
World Leaders 
</P>
<P>
Products made by firms in South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and other rapidly 
developing Far Eastern nations have been sold in the country for years. But 
many of these companies outside Japan still have a long way to go before they 
win the recognition and customer loyalty -- and the related rewards -- in the 
United States that firms like Honda and Sony enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
Many of these firms are corporate giants and world leaders in their businesses. 
Samsung, for example, is the world's largest manufacturer of microwave ovens, 
and Kunnan Enterprises of Taiwan holds the title of the globe's biggest maker 
of tennis rackets. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the names of these giant firms and their products are still relatively 
obscure in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Daewoo, the third-largest company in South Korea, ranked near the 
bottom of a recent survey measuring consumer awareness in the United States. In 
the ranking of 672 names, only four others were more obscure than Daewoo, 
despite a sizable ad campaign, according to Landor Associates, a corporate 
design firm that conducted the survey. 
</P>
<P>
Lacking a strong identity can make it harder for a company to command the 
prestige and higher prices that are the privilege of a well-regarded brand 
name. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Costly to Create Image 
</P>
<P>
"Established brands are very valuable commodities," said Robert Kahn, executive 
director of Landor's Los Angeles office. "It is generally a wise thing to do. 
It is difficult, though. There are so many competing brands and images that 
make it difficult to capture a share of the consumers' attention." 
</P>
<P>
Creating a well-known brand name and image is a costly, time-consuming process. 
Not only must companies spend more on marketing and production to live up to 
that image, but they must battle against a huge number of competitors promoting 
their owns names and reputations. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers from countries such as South Korea and Taiwan must also overcome 
lingering doubts in consumers' minds about product quality and workmanship, 
said Renee Fraser, general manager of the Pacific division of the advertising 
agency Bozell, Jacobs, Kenyon &amp; Eckhardt. Still, that's a marked 
improvement from a decade ago when many Americans expressed an ' "I don't think 
I would have bought something from Korea' attitude," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, a host of Japanese companies can claim well-known names and an 
image for quality. But 30 years ago, the Japanese found themselves struggling 
to raise their profile and turn around a poor image much like today's firms 
from emerging Asian nations. 
</P>
<P>
"In the early 1960s, if you would say a certain product was made in Japan, you 
were ensuring its low-quality image," said Clive Chajet, chairman of Lippincott 
&amp; Marguiles, a corporate image consultant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aim for Dealers, Retailers 
</P>
<P>
"It takes time to establish a world-class brand," Chajet said. "It's far too 
soon to judge whether these brands have succeeded or failed." 
</P>
<P>
Many companies have found it easier building brand awareness by begining with 
wholesalers and retailers. 
</P>
<P>
Advertising for Pro-Kennex tennis rackets, made by Kunnan Enterprises of 
Taiwan, has mostly featured the technical aspects and quality of the company's 
rackets. The strategy, which also pointed out that Kunnan was the world's 
largest maker of tennis rackets, was aimed at making retailers and dealers 
aware of the brand, said Mark Wentura, senior marketing manager at Pro-Kennex. 
The ads ran mostly in trade publications. 
</P>
<P>
Pro-Kennex, which has recently begun running ads aimed at consumers, is the 
third-best-selling brand in the United States -- behind Prince and Wilson -- 
eight years after its introduction in this country. "We've been accepted in 
tennis and now it will be easy to create an image as a racket sports leader," 
said Wentura, referring to a new line of racquetball and squash rackets bearing 
the Pro-Kennex name. 
</P>
<P>
While companies such as Kunnan build themselves a brand image in the United 
States, they risk losing as customers the many companies that sell their goods 
under other names. These companies, besides being steady sources of sales, also 
have established distribution networks and bear the costs of adverting and 
marketing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Upgraded Image 
</P>
<P>
"We worked hard not to ruffle anyone's feathers," Leister said at Samsung. And 
for good reason: Half of Samsung's $800 million in annual U.S. sales are from 
products sold under other names, like General Electric microwave ovens. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the importance of such sales, Samsung began selling its own brand-name 
products in the United States in 1978. First, low-priced Samsung-brand products 
appeared at mass merchandisers, such as K mart. 
</P>
<P>
Then, two years ago, the company looked to upgrade its image by launching an 
advertising campaign and selling products at specialty-electronic and 
department stores. "We felt it was time to get away from the low-end image that 
Samsung had and promote the Samsung brand," said Leister. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Touting Quality 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the company expanded its U.S. repair and service centers. "If 
a customer buys a product from a company that they don't really know, in the 
back of their mind, there is some concern," said Liester. The customer, 
according to Liester, asks: What happens if it breaks? 
</P>
<P>
During the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul, Samsung, along with many other Korean 
companies, advertised heavily during television broadcasts of the games. This 
fall, Samsung launched its first nationwide print campaign, which touts Samsung 
quality in such publications as National Geographic and Smithsonian. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just the begining," said Leister. "Not only do we have to get the name 
recognized but have it associated with a quality product."

A COIN WASHING MACHINE BY ANY OTHER NAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although many people use the word "Laundromat" to generically refer to 
coin-operated laundries, the first washing machine for public use was actually 
called a "Washateria." 
</P>
<P>
An enterprising entrepreneur named J.F. Cantrell opened the first Washateria in 
Ft. Worth, Tex., on April 18, 1934, according to the book "Famous First Facts." 
</P>
<P>
The facility had four electric washing machines that customers could rent by 
the hour. Hot water and electricity were supplied, but users were obliged to 
bring their own soap. 
</P>
<P>
The name "Laundromat" was first registered as a goods and services trademark by 
Westinghouse Electric Corp. in 1940. White Consolidated Industries Inc. 
acquired the trademark in 1975 when it purchased the major-appliance division 
of Westinghouse. 
</P>
<P>
But White Consolidated, a Cleveland-based industrial and consumer products 
company, stopped making commercial laundry equipment about two years ago and no 
longer builds coin-operated laundries or markets commercial washers or dryers, 
according to H. Ted Fritz, vice president of Westinghouse brand management. 
</P>
<P>
Westinghouse dropped out of the commercial laundry business, Fritz said, after 
Maytag and Speedqueen began to dominate the industry in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Today the trademark name "Laundromat" is only being used on a new line of 
consumer laundry equipment, Fritz said. However, he noted, White Consolidated 
still has a European subsidiary making commercial laundry equipment, and White 
Consolidated has not ruled out the possibility of one day re-entering the 
commercial coin-operated laundry business.

CLUBS STAYING ALERT IN EFFORT TO HALT BLIGHT;

30-YEAR FIGHT IN SOUTH L.A. STRIVES TO UPGRADE AREA 
</P>

<P>
It wasn't long after the young man moved into a rented house on Ferdia Harris' 
neat, tree-lined stretch of 94th Street in South-Central Los Angeles that she 
decided he needed a visit. 
</P>
<P>
"I was driving past one day and there he was, out there in front of his house 
taking a car apart at the curb," Harris recalled. "I got out of my car, marched 
right up to him and said 'You know, you can't do that here. You're going to 
have to move that to your back yard.' 
</P>
<P>
"He asked me who I was and I told him I was the deputy for the area," she said, 
erupting into laughter about the title she made up on the spot. "He was very 
apologetic and said he didn't know he was doing anything wrong. We haven't had 
a problem out of him since." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Room for Junk 
</P>
<P>
What made the difference in that gentle but effective confrontation between 
neighbors last summer? "I think he may have had some respect for my age," the 
70-year-old Harris said. "But I also made it clear to him that we wanted him to 
stay, but we didn't want his junk." 
</P>
<P>
Harris has been sending the same message to people who live near her for more 
than 30 years, since shortly after she moved into what was then a tiny box of a 
starter home on 94th near McKinley Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
She first transmitted it through home improvement block clubs she helped 
organize in the 1950s when black families moved in large numbers into the 
southern part of the city, replacing whites fleeing to the suburbs. The main 
purpose of the clubs, some of them literally as small as one city block, was to 
encourage the new residents to build a stable community by maintaining and 
improving their property instead of moving away to more prosperous areas as 
soon as they could afford to. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Harris' message was condensed to "Don't Move, Improve," and became the 
slogan of the Council of Community Clubs, an umbrella organization that Harris 
founded in 1963 to make it easier for the block clubs to get what they needed 
from government agencies. Its functions have since expanded to include such 
things as employment counseling and job referral for residents and voter 
registration drives. 
</P>
<P>
Although the council has shrunk from a peak of 78 block clubs in the late 1970s 
to 35 today, Harris and others think something like it -- a large coalition of 
tiny neighborhood groups -- may hold the solution to problems that plague 
South-Central and other areas of the city. Proposals now being offered by 
police and others that would organize neighborhood groups in the war against 
blight and crime are derivatives of methods the Council of Community Clubs 
refined years ago. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilwoman Gloria Molina, concerned with the proliferation of street 
drug dealing in parts of her 1st District, has set aside $75,000 from her 
office budget to organize small neighborhood groups through a program called 
More Advocates for Safe Homes. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) has proposed that the Los Angeles 
City Council create a city commission that would oversee activities of already 
established block clubs and organize new ones throughout the city, block by 
block. 
</P>
<P>
"Block clubs are probably the most viable concept for crime prevention," said 
Waters. "The problem is that right now everything is hit and miss." 
</P>
<P>
As the council considers Waters' proposal, which is in committee, the Los 
Angeles Police Department has ordered all its divisions to begin planning for a 
citywide program that operates on the theory that neighborhood improvement and 
beautification is a deterrent to crime. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Christopher West of the LAPD Crime Prevention Unit said that through the 
program, called Police Assisting Community Enhancement, the department will 
help residents wade through bureaucratic red tape when they want to do such 
things as have abandoned cars removed from the streets or have alleys cleaned. 
</P>
<P>
The program, West said, grew out of a Harvard University study in the early 
1980s that concluded if a community would tolerate, say, abandoned cars, it 
would tolerate deteriorated buildings. If it would tolerate deteriorated 
buildings, it would tolerate loiterers on street corners. Eventually, he said, 
serious criminal activity would move into the area. 
</P>
<P>
The study also concluded, West said, that evidence of destructiveness and 
neglect in neighborhoods, such as broken windows on a building, attract similar 
vandalism, if left unattended. 
</P>
<P>
Harris understood that without the benefit of a scientific study. 
</P>
<P>
"From the beginning we realized that you had to nip the problem in the bud," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Block club streets are not immune to crime, she said, but they have remained 
stable through the years even where they abut areas that have serious gang 
problems and widespread physical deterioration. 
</P>
<P>
One of the tools used often by clubs affiliated with the Council of Community 
Clubs is a complaint form, designed by Harris, that club members fill out when 
they can't get city departments to respond to their requests for service. The 
forms are sent to the City Council district office in question and, if 
necessary, followed up with phone calls or face-to-face meetings. 
</P>
<P>
When those tactics don't bring immediate responses, the problem is not left to 
sit. 
</P>
<P>
"We have swept the streets ourselves," said Harris, who holds the title of 
executive director of the CCC. "We have picked up litter and we try to 
influence others to do the same." 
</P>
<P>
Willis Pursley, the CCC's 65-year-old president, said his Halldale Avenue Block 
Club simply pays a young man to keep its streets free of litter. 
</P>
<P>
Laura Shur, an aide to Councilman Robert Farrell, whose 8th District is home to 
most of the block clubs affiliated with the Council of Community Clubs, said 
the clubs, during a one-month period last year, submitted 47 requests for aid. 
Included were 16 requests for alley cleanings or graffiti removal, seven for 
building inspections, four for the removal of abandoned cars and two for vacant 
lots to be cleaned. 
</P>
<P>
The best proof of the success of the "block club movement," as Harris calls it, 
is the appearance of the streets that have strong block clubs. 
</P>
<P>
Those streets are filled with row after row of neat homes, clean-swept alleys, 
trimmed lawns and delicately clipped trees. Many of the trees, Harris said, 
were placed there, not by the city, but by block club members who pooled their 
money to buy saplings, then spent a Saturday planting them. 
</P>
<P>
Harris organized four blocks on 94th Street, she said, shortly after she and 
her husband moved there. It is believed by many to have been one of the first, 
if not the first, organization of its kind in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"The houses then were little cubbyholes, the area wasn't very picturesque," 
Harris said. "Our purpose was to make it better so people would stay." 
</P>
<P>
In a few years, the clubs had popped up all over South-Central, particularly in 
its southeast section. Harris formed the CCC in 1963 and in 1969 it became a 
nonprofit charitable organization. Affiliate clubs pay an $18 annual fee for 
membership and their presidents represent them at CCC meetings. Any expenses 
incurred beyond what the dues pay come out of the pockets of Harris and other 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
The only government funding the organization has ever received, said Harris, 
was a two-year grant in the late 1970s to operate a federal Model Cities 
program. That was also the only time it operated in an office outside of 
Harris' home. 
</P>
<P>
Harris said the separate office made the Council of Community Clubs more 
visible and attracted more block clubs to it. After the office closed, she 
said, a number of the clubs broke away from the larger organization. 
</P>
<P>
Pursley said that in recent years, a few clubs have disbanded when their most 
active members grew old or died. He estimates that in addition to the 
affiliates of the Council of Community Clubs, about 40 other block clubs 
operate in the 8th District. The organization also has some clubs in nearby 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
The most active members in all the South-Central block clubs, Pursley said, 
tend to be older people who have lived in the same homes for 20 or 30 years. 
For that reason, he said, the Council of Community Clubs is trying to come up 
with ways to attract younger people. 
</P>
<P>
Julia Lee, another member of the council, said that effort is sometimes 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't find many young families that own their houses," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Others said that it also is difficult to find people who have the motivation 
that the all-volunteer block club work requires or people who have experience 
as leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, who moved to Los Angeles in 1939 from Texas at age 19, brought to the 
block club movement the skills she developed as a civil rights activist and as 
a union organizer at Douglas Aircraft Co. in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Much of what she knows about city services and the intricacies of city 
government was gained between 1968 and 1974, when she worked as an aide to her 
brother-in-law, Billy Mills, who was at the time on the City Council 
representing the 8th District. 
</P>
<P>
Mills, now a Los Angeles Superior Court judge, said he hired Harris, not 
because she is a relative, but because of her extensive contacts in the 
community through the block clubs. 
</P>
<P>
"No one I know is able to get things done the way Ferdia does," said Mills. "We 
used to pray for organizations like hers. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Farrell, a former Mills aide who succeeded him on the City Council, 
said he also maintains a close relationship with Harris and the CCC. 
</P>
<P>
"When I need to get the word to the community out about something, they are 
always willing to do it through their network," Farrell said. "By the same 
token, they let me know what's going on in the community."

AFTER 3 YEARS IN JAIL, RAMIREZ WILL GO ON TRIAL TODAY IN 13 NIGHT STALKER 
MURDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN CHEN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The object of a massive police manhunt at age 25, Richard Ramirez has marked 
three birthdays in a tiny, pale-blue cell in the Los Angeles County Jail, 
reading, exercising and, occasionally, boasting about the Night Stalker 
killings with which he is charged. 
</P>
<P>
This morning, a month shy of his 29th birthday, the drifter from El Paso, Tex., 
goes on trial for his life. But if Ramirez harbors any trepidations about the 
possibility of going to the gas chamber, he does not show it. 
</P>
<P>
In court, he became a studious participant in the preparation of his defense, 
taking notes and consulting animatedly with members of his legal team as they 
went about selecting a jury. 
</P>
<P>
His only distractions seem to come when a woman enters the courtroom, prompting 
him to turn his head for a close once-over. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Low-Keyed Demeanor 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez's low-keyed courtroom demeanor during the last six months of jury 
selection is in marked contrast to an earlier court appearance in which he 
flashed a pentagram drawn on his palm and yelled, "Hail Satan!" after pleading 
not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
Such bizarre behavior probably had to do with his being upset at his previous 
attorneys, according to Daniel Hernandez, who was hired by Ramirez after the 
defendant had a falling out with two court-appointed public defenders and 
another lawyer, all shortly after his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez is charged with 13 murders in a terrifying spree of nighttime 
residential attacks in Los Angeles County that also left many others injured. 
He faces 30 other felony counts, including attempted murder, rape and forced 
oral copulation. The defendant is also charged with a 14th murder in San 
Francisco and an attempted murder and sexual assault in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
At the jail downtown, Ramirez remains isolated in a windowless, 10-by-12-foot 
cell, devouring newspapers, magazines and books, including a recent biography 
of the late actor David Niven, according to Richard Salinas, a paralegal who is 
assisting Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from his frequent evening consultations with Hernandez, the defendant is 
allowed one visit a day -- from "friends and family," according to Hernandez, 
who declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
In jail, Ramirez's ankles are not shackled, as they are in court. But whenever 
he is moved from his cell, to make a telephone call, for instance, a sergeant 
must be present, along with the customary deputies. 
</P>
<P>
Also as an added precaution, Ramirez is usually transported from the jail to 
the Criminal Courts Building alone. Occasionally, he rides in a bus with other 
inmates, but even then he is segregated from the others. 
</P>
<P>
At the jail, there is a "special Ramirez watch," which means that a sheriff's 
deputy is posted just outside Cell No. 7021 and looks in on Ramirez every 15 
minutes through a rectangular, plate-glass window in the steel door. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chilling Monologue 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Deputy Jim Ellis was on such a watch on Oct. 10, 1985, when Ramirez 
launched into a chilling monologue, according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
"I killed 20 people in California. I was a super-criminal," Ramirez told Ellis. 
"No one could catch me. Then I (expletive) up and left one goddamn fingerprint 
and they caught me." 
</P>
<P>
Recounting a murder in San Francisco for which he has been charged separately, 
Ramirez said: "I walked up the stairs real slow and got into the house, and 
then I went into the bedroom and saw these two people sleeping there and then, 
boom, boom. I did them in." 
</P>
<P>
He went on: "I love to kill people. I love watching people die. I would shoot 
them in the head, and they would wiggle and squirm all over the place and then 
just stop. Or cut them with a knife and watch the face turn real white. I love 
all that blood. One time I told this lady to give me all her money. She said 
no. So I cut her and pulled her eyes out," he said, referring to one of his 
alleged victims. 
</P>
<P>
While making these comments, Ramirez occasionally paused to "laugh a little 
bit," Ellis reported. 
</P>
<P>
Co-prosecutor Phil Halpin said he will seek to introduce these statements as 
evidence in the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Moments earlier, Ramirez had expressed a suspicion that his food and drink were 
being drugged, and flushed a portion of the meal down the toilet. 
</P>
<P>
Four months later, Deputy Robert Anderson was on watch when Ramirez slipped a 
postcard under the door, asking Anderson to mail it. 
</P>
<P>
"Read the back of it," Ramirez urged. "It rhymes like a poem." The jingle 
contained a threat against a former acquaintance. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez's message was that "he was going to get anybody who is directly 
involved with turning him in to the police," according to Anderson's account of 
the incident. 
</P>
<P>
It was also from jail that Ramirez allegedly said last August that someone 
would slip him a gun so he could "get the D.A." and then turn it on others in 
the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
According to County Deputy Public Defender Hank Hall, who initially represented 
Ramirez, a court-appointed psychologist in 1985 had found him to be "borderline 
competent" after a 10- to 15-minute discussion that was abruptly terminated by 
Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
That session had to be delayed a day because, Hall told Los Angeles Municipal 
Judge Elva R. Soper, Ramirez was "acting up in the lockup." 
</P>
<P>
During that same 1985 court proceeding, Soper observed: "Up to this point, the 
questions I have asked Mr. Ramirez, he has answered in a logical, intelligent 
fashion." 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez replied: "I am sane." 
</P>
<P>
He added that he has had 11 years of education, plus one year of studies in the 
electrical trade. Then he volunteered: "I have a psychologist in Los Angeles 
who has qualified me sane. . . . I don't want to go to no hospital, ma'am." He 
did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
The tall, lanky Ramirez usually appears in court wearing a dark suit, and often 
with sunglasses. When he speaks, which is rare, it is in a husky voice. 
</P>
<P>
In mid-January, when Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Michael A. Tynan asked 
Ramirez if he joined in a defense motion for a mistrial, he replied with 
aplomb: "I think you should rule on it. If the law is that I have to answer, 
then I'd like to talk to him (Hernandez) first." 
</P>
<P>
After conferring with Hernandez, Ramirez told the judge: "Yes, I concur." 
</P>
<P>
Tynan has estimated that the trial may take as long as two years.

Superconducting materials can carry current by two mechanisms, rather than one 
as some theories hold, says a study published last week. The findings should 
help scientists figure out how superconductivity works, researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
But they still do not know just how superconductivity arises in so-called 
"high-temperature" superconductors, which require less chilling than previous 
materials before they lose their electrical resistance. 
</P>
<P>
University of Tokyo researchers reported in last week's issue of the British 
journal Nature that they developed a new family of compounds in which the 
current is carried by electrons, which are tiny charged particles. 
</P>
<P>
In previously known high-temperature superconductors, the charge was carried 
instead by roving areas called "holes" that lack electrons, they said.

EGG MAY HATCH GENETIC DRUGS

Researchers at Amgen Inc. of Thousand Oaks have developed an effective new 
method of inserting new genetic information into chicken eggs so that it will 
be passed on to succeeding generations. One benefit of the development may be a 
new path to production of genetically engineered drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Using techniques that have been refined in other animals, the Amgen researchers 
open the egg at a very early stage of development, insert genetic material into 
the nucleus through a very fine glass tube, then reseal the egg and allow it to 
hatch. Future experiments will attempt to introduce new genetic material 
controlling such traits as growth characteristics and disease resistance, the 
company said. 
</P>
<P>
Amgen officials said the technique may one day have applications in the 
pharmaceutical industry because of the chicken's proven ability to efficiently 
produce albumen -- the protein that makes up the white portion of chicken eggs. 
Foreign proteins, such as drugs, could be manufactured along with the albumen, 
then readily isolated.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: TRASH FROM THE PAST VIES FOR TV TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

HOUSTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You can have your high-concept television. 
</P>
<P>
You can have your rip-offs of old shows that copied still older shows. You can 
have your glamour shows, your high-tech smoothies, your glossy stars, your 
spotlights, your flash, your fizz, your razzmatazz and all that jazz. 
</P>
<P>
The cream of a mammoth syndicated program-selling conference here last week was 
not with big-budget big shots trying to sell their slickly packaged wares to 
American stations and a few foreign networks. 
</P>
<P>
It was in a small, low-cost, out-of-the-way booth on the floor of the George R. 
Brown Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
This is trash TV. 
</P>
<P>
"Do I have the trashiest movies of all time?" Tom T. Moore asked rhetorically. 
"If not, I'm close." 
</P>
<P>
Very close. 
</P>
<P>
Moore heads Reel Movies International, a small Dallas distributor that sells 
not only some deliciously ancient TV series, but also a supremely corny movie 
package called "Killer B's." 
</P>
<P>
These "B" movies, mostly from the 1950s, are so absolutely awful that they are 
irresistible. If you can't love "Devil Girl From Mars," "Night of the Ghouls" 
or "Plan 9 From Outer Space," you're hopeless. And "Half Human" ("He still felt 
a searching need for human love") isn't bad, either. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just fantastic trash," said Moore. Here, at last, was a salesman whose 
product matched his hype at the annual meeting of the National Assn. of 
Television Programming Executives. 
</P>
<P>
It's almost unthinkable that there wouldn't be a large TV audience for these 
exhilaratingly horrid productions. Moore played a reel of movie trailers 
offering some of the best screams and most exquisitely bad dialogue this side 
of Godzilla. 
</P>
<P>
From "Devil Girl From Mars": "She's a creature without mercy! Get back! Get 
back!" 
</P>
<P>
From "Mesa of Lost Women": "Have you ever been kissed by a woman like this?" 
</P>
<P>
From "A Date With Death": "Creatures of the night rush relentlessly to keep . . 
. a date with death." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, there were no station executives rushing to keep a date with 
Moore. His domestic sales here were nil, he said, even though he had recently 
closed a $1-million deal in England, where the widening over-the-air TV and 
emerging cable markets have created a large demand for programming. 
</P>
<P>
The English always did have an eye for masterpieces. 
</P>
<P>
And some were available from other distributors, too, making the competition 
fierce. "Let him brag," Michael Avery said about Moore. "But I promise you that 
we have the worst movies over here." 
</P>
<P>
An empty boast? If nothing else, a look at their catalogue certifies that Avery 
of Avery Productions and Scott Sobel of Scott Entertainment -- who work 
together despite operating separate companies on opposite coasts -- can dish 
trash with anyone. 
</P>
<P>
They do handle many genuinely formidable movies. But among their multitude of 
titles is also "Chained for Life," the 1930 classic about Siamese twins. A 
quote from the original ad: "I must have a love life!" 
</P>
<P>
Also, their "Teenage Theatre" package, hosted by Mamie Van Doren, offers such 
appealingly unwholesome movies as "Carnival Rock": "Thrill-crazed gangsters and 
sleazy psycho teens all clash together in a seedy carnival nightclub, set to 
the blistering beat of rockabilly rhythm 'n' blues." Sounds like "The Morton 
Downey Jr. Show." 
</P>
<P>
The movies are wonderfully raunchy. In terms of pure fun, however, nothing tops 
the nostalgic TV packages available from Avery/Scott -- whose "TV's Golden 
Years" has already run on KHJ-TV Channel 9 in Los Angeles -- and other 
distributors. 
</P>
<P>
A special quality of old TV -- whether camp or classic -- is its ability to 
reconnect you to your past and replay moments in time when you were watching 
specific programs. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Clement of Virginia Beach, Va., began as a collector himself before 
starting his distribution company, Classic Entertainment. His catalogue for the 
programming convention included such familiar titles as "The Jack Benny Show" 
and "The Roy Rogers Show" from the 1950s. Good watching. 
</P>
<P>
But what an even bigger kick it would be -- and what childhood memories it 
would evoke -- again to see "Foreign Intrigue," the 1951-55 series (it changed 
heroes and titles several times) that was about, well, foreign intrigue in the 
Cold War era. 
</P>
<P>
Filmed in Europe, it was possibly the most ambitious -- and surely one of the 
best and most urbane -- series of its time, reeking of atmosphere, romance, 
adventure and politics. 
</P>
<P>
However, nothing at the convention here was more political -- and nostalgic, in 
a way -- than "The Truth About Communism," Sidney Fields' 1968 documentary 
narrated by Ronald Reagan: "It's the conspiracy that's growing stronger and 
stronger. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Said Allen Hart, vice president of Excel Telemedia: "This is the old 
anti-communist, snarling Reagan. We've had it for about six or seven years and 
it's been a tough sell up 'til now. I think it was a personal thing. Most of 
the programmers just didn't like Reagan. But now that he's out of office, 
there's renewed interest." 
</P>
<P>
There was never any interest to renew in "The Stan Kann?? Show." This is 
carrying nostalgia too far. 
</P>
<P>
Who is Stan Kann? Exactly the point. 
</P>
<P>
The brochure from Weiss Global Enterprises of Oxnard says: 
</P>
<P>
"Stan Kann, who always seems to have a talent for making easy tasks more 
difficult, is featured with anchorman Doug Paulson as they introduce a 
potpourri of comedy in a warm, friendly atmosphere for the entire family's 
enjoyment. Each episode is situationally unique and features a special 
celebrity guest." 
</P>
<P>
Some of whom are no longer alive, unfortunately, for the show is 16 years old. 
</P>
<P>
Kann was once a frequent guest on talk shows. "He's the buffoon who screws 
everything up," said Steven Weiss, president of Weiss Global. "Look, it's a 
delightful little show. We thought it would get good demographics. We thought 
it would make a good afternoon show. So far, we've been wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Not that Weiss Global doesn't have some pretty terrific oldies, including such 
Ronald Reagan movies as "Cattle Queen of Montana" and "Tennessee's Partner," 
the memorable movie "Virgin Sacrifice" and such aged TV series as "Rocky Jones, 
Space Ranger," "My Little Margie" and "I Married Joan." 
</P>
<P>
The nostalgia business may be heating up, according to Weiss, whose 
grandfather, Louis Weiss, produced silent movie comedies and the original 1917 
Tarzan serial starring Elmo Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't tell you the amount of calls and letters I get from people who like 
these TV shows," Weiss said. "Some of them even want autographed stills. They 
don't even realize Joan Davis is dead." 
</P>
<P>
All of which seemed a universe away from the syndication convention's 
creatively moribund, but booming, frenzied, neon world of contemporary trash, 
where bad is really bad. 
</P>
<P>
A "Devil Girl From Mars" line fits here: "This is the sinister shape of things 
to come."

CIGARETTES: SMOLDERING ISSUE IN FILM? 
</P>

<P>
Hollywood films could be a new battleground in the nation's war on smoking. 
</P>
<P>
Several congressmen and anti-smoking groups at a legislative conference here 
said they will push in the 101st Congress for restrictions on cigarette 
advertising and promotion, including a possible ban on payments to film makers 
to feature cigarette brands. 
</P>
<P>
One lawmaker at the weekend conference, Rep. Tom Luken (D-Ohio), announced an 
inquiry to determine if cigarette makers, like other businesses, pay movie 
companies to feature their products in specific scenes. 
</P>
<P>
Luken, who sponsored a failed bill in the last Congress to ban all cigarette 
ads and promotion, was among seven congressmen who gathered here with members 
of health groups, including the American Medical Assn. and American Lung Assn., 
to set a smoking control agenda for the new Congress. 
</P>
<P>
He released a copy of a Jan. 25 letter asking the six major U.S. cigarette 
makers to disclose names of any movies in which they paid to have their brands 
appear on screen. 
</P>
<P>
Luken, who chairs the House Subcommittee on Transportation, Tourism and 
Hazardous Materials, asked for the list by Feb. 10, along with a copy of 
agreements between cigarette manufacturers and film makers. The request covers 
all movies made in the last 10 years. Luken also asked the companies to 
disclose whether any scripts were changed to include smoking scenes. 
</P>
<P>
But the nation's two largest cigarette makers, Philip Morris and RJR Nabisco's 
Reynolds tobacco unit, denied that they pay to place their brands in films. The 
other companies could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
Company policy "prohibits our paying to have our products placed in movies," 
said Betsy Annese, a vice president for communications with R.J. Reynolds 
Tobacco Co. Annese said she did not know how long the policy has been in 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't pay money to get cigarettes in movies or cigarette signage in 
movies," said Tom Ricke, director of corporate communications for Philip Morris 
Cos. Inc., adding that the policy had been in effect "for at least 10 years." 
Ricke said the company occasionally agrees to requests from film makers for 
cigarettes and signs, and has "from time to time provided, as a courtesy, 
promotional clothing to cast and crew." 
</P>
<P>
It is a common practice for businesses to use motion pictures as advertising 
vehicles. Anti-smoking groups accuse cigarette makers of using films as a way 
to promote smoking without interference from warning labels or the ban on 
broadcast advertising. 
</P>
<P>
A Luken aide said he believed this is the first time a congressional panel has 
sought information about possible promotional arrangements between tobacco 
companies and film makers. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to find out the extent to which the merchants of addiction are paying 
the film producers to get cigarettes used in movies," Luken said in a prepared 
statement. "This practice is a subtle way of getting young people to smoke and 
also has the effect of circumventing the federal ban on cigarette advertising 
on television," he charged. 
</P>
<P>
Luken's interest was aroused by an item in a back issue of Philip Morris 
Magazine, a glossy publication of general articles and smokers' rights 
editorials distributed free to 12 million subscribers. The magazine's winter, 
1987, issue, attacked a proposed ban on cigarette advertising and promotion as 
potentially harmful to the film industry. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed ban "ignores, apparently by design, the reality of film making 
today," the magazine said. "It is no coincidence that one manufacturer's ice 
cream, car, clothing, computer, cola, cosmetics, stereo, cigarette, beer, etc. 
is displayed exclusively in any given film. Featuring a particular brand name 
throughout a film is a significant and rapidly growing source of revenue for 
film makers." 
</P>
<P>
Ricke, the Philip Morris spokesman, said these statements were "meant to be a 
general description of the practices" of movie and consumer products companies. 
"It wasn't meant to describe Philip Morris' policies." 
</P>
<P>
Luken called the firm's explanation "strange." He added that "people don't 
usually defend a practice unless they're involved." 
</P>
<P>
"There's certainly enough here for us to ask the questions," Luken said. "If 
they're not (paying to feature their brands), we'll move on to other issues." 
</P>
<P>
The president of a firm that places products in movies said he approached ad 
agencies for "two or three" cigarette makers last year about possible movie 
deals, but struck out each time. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't want to touch it, with cash, with a 10-foot pole," said Ed Mintz, 
president of Van Nuys-based CinemaScore. "It was such a hard, closed door." 
</P>
<P>
Mintz said he had a "gut feeling" such deals have been worked out before, 
although he had "never seen a contract." 
</P>
<P>
Mintz said films may be a good vehicle for cigarette brands, which are more 
readily recalled by audiences than some other consumer products. He said his 
survey research showed that Philip Morris' Marlboro brand, the world's largest 
seller, pictured in "Alien Nation" and "Midnight Run," was recalled by 68% and 
62%, respectively, of those who saw those films. He said 40% of those who saw 
"Who Framed Roger Rabbit" recalled American Tobacco's Lucky Strike brand, while 
21% of "Tequila Sunrise" patrons remembered American's Malibu brand.

COURTING THE ACADEMY 
</P>

<P>
The way the producers of "Stand and Deliver" figure it, Edward James Olmos 
deserves more exposure in the Oscar race. 
</P>
<P>
Olmos' portrayal of a barrio high school teacher in that film earned him some 
critical acclaim and a Golden Globe nomination. But when it came to the annual 
ritual of studio campaigning for Oscar nominations, Warner Bros. bought only a 
handful of advertisements in the Hollywood trade papers. 
</P>
<P>
A Warners spokesman insists the film received the same treatment as the 
studio's other Oscar contenders. But Olmos' agent, Jim Cota, takes a different 
view. "We got absolutely no support from the studio -- it's terrible," Cota 
said. 
</P>
<P>
So Cota, the film's investors (who sold "Stand and Deliver" to Warners in a 
pick-up deal) and Olmos are pooling their own money to buy ads in the trade 
papers, asking members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to 
consider Olmos for a best actor Oscar. "We had to beat up Eddie over the head 
to do this," Cota said. 
</P>
<P>
That "Stand and Deliver's" supporters are dipping into their own pockets to the 
tune of several thousand dollars is a sign of how important marketing campaigns 
have become in the race for Oscar nominations. 
</P>
<P>
True, the Academy warns members about "advertisements, promotional gifts and 
other lobbying tactics," and Academy members love to expound at length about 
the integrity of their voting process. But many Hollywood insiders also concede 
that marketing campaigns do help shape the thinking of Academy members -- 
though not always in the manner that the studios intend. 
</P>
<P>
This year, for example, Cannon has launched an aggressive campaign for its 
critically acclaimed "Little Dorrit," prompting some Oscar race veterans to 
snipe that the studio's "garish" advertisements work against the picture. 
Universal's marketers thought Academy members would enjoy an elegant dinner 
before the studio's free screenings, but others say that strategy could 
backfire. "If (promotion) gets too elaborate," one producer said, "people are 
going to feel like you're trying to buy their vote." 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Warners' decision to hold back on its campaign for Olmos could 
actually aid his Oscar race. "This casts him as the underdog," explained Gabe 
Sumner, executive 
</P>
<P>
producer for Odyssey Entertainment Ltd. "Fellow actors might be more receptive 
to nominate him. They would probably appreciate (his situation)." Indeed, 
Sumner purposely positioned "Rocky" as an underdog candidate in 1976, when that 
film won the best picture Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
Marketing campaigns are especially important this year, which appears to be 
short on front-runners. In contrast to past years, there has been a notable 
lack of agreement among the various critics' groups that bestow their own 
awards in advance of the Oscars, including the Hollywood foreign press, which 
handed out its Golden Globes awards on Saturday. "When there are no shoo-ins, 
it's open season for every studio's publicity department to spend lots of 
money," said producer Robert Radnitz. 
</P>
<P>
Since November, the 4,632 voting members of the Academy have been bombarded by 
advertisements in the trade papers (principally Daily Variety and the Hollywood 
Reporter), gold-embossed letters in their mailboxes, and sound tracks passed 
out at screenings. Once the nominees are announced on Feb. 15, the volume of 
advertising will increase even further until the winners are announced March 
29. 
</P>
<P>
Like the presidential primary, the Oscar season only gets longer and longer. 
"Every year they seem to start the campaign earlier," said Lynne Segall, 
marketing and sales director for the Hollywood Reporter. Prime advertising 
spots in that paper are locked up beginning in August. 
</P>
<P>
Compared to 1960, though, when an Oscar campaign for John Wayne's "The Alamo" 
equated a best picture vote with patriotism, studio strategies for seeking 
Oscar nominations are downright tame. So tame, in fact, that the Academy even 
plans to tone down its written warning to members about "crude and excessive 
solicitations," an Academy spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Watching the studio's marketing moves can be almost as entertaining as the 
Oscar race itself. Here's a look at some of this year's strategies: 
</P>
<P>
The resurrection strategy: "The Unbearable Lightness of Being" faces unbearable 
odds: Nearly 80% of the films that have gone on to win a best picture Oscar in 
the past 54 years were released in the second half of the year. "Unbearable 
Lightness" was released in February last year, and it didn't survive at the box 
office for long. 
</P>
<P>
So producer Saul Zaentz, together with the film's distributor, Orion, mounted a 
major advertising campaign, hiring Lloyd Leipzig, who had conducted the 
successful Academy Award campaign for Zaentz's "Amadeus." Leipzig and the Davis 
&amp; Grimaldi agency began routinely reminding Academy members about 
"Unbearable Lightness" back when most people in Hollywood were still talking 
about the Thanksgiving box office results. A rough survey of the trades shows 
that, so far, "Unbearable Lightness" is the most advertised film in the race. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom-line strategy: "Rain Man" is already considered a top contender for 
an Oscar nomination. But MGM/UA isn't taking any chances: Colorful, poignant 
scenes from the film regularly fill up two-page ad space in the trade papers, 
and the studio is running a lengthy commercial about the making of "Rain Man" 
on Los Angeles cable systems. 
</P>
<P>
MGM/UA is hoping that a few nominations will help "Rain Man's" prospects at the 
box office when it is released overseas in late February or early March. That 
same strategy worked wonders when "Moonstruck" collected a satchel of 
nominations before going overseas last year. 
</P>
<P>
The re-release strategy: One key to any Oscar campaign is to get voters to see 
the film. "The problem gets worse and worse," says producer Jere Henshaw, a 
30-year Academy member. "How do you get people out of the house and in to see 
the picture?" This year, in addition to free, private screenings for Academy 
members, studios are re-releasing films in commercial theaters close to Academy 
members' neighborhoods -- "Who Framed Roger Rabbit," "A Cry in the Dark," 
"Bird," "Running on Empty" are among the re-releases. Some films, like 
"Unbearable Lightness" are also available on videocassette. 
</P>
<P>
The quotable critics strategy: Any film critics left out of the campaign for 
Clint Eastwood's "Bird" must be feeling pretty lonely. In one Daily Variety ad 
alone, critics from 30 different outlets were quoted -- ranging from Newsweek 
and NBC's "Today" show to the University of Texas' student newspaper, the Daily 
Texan. That contrasts with Weintraub's campaign for the less-than-critically 
acclaimed "My Stepmother is an Alien," which had to resort to filling up its 
advertising space by reprinting two entire reviews.

John H. Cleveland of Washington became the second Teamsters vice president to 
resign, clearing the way for him to be dropped as a defendant in a government 
racketeering case. The action by Cleveland and Robert H. Holmes, a vice 
president in Detroit, was part of an agreement with the Justice Department, 
said Deborah Corley, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office in New York. 
Corley said the agreement would be submitted for court approval. Holmes' 
resignation was announced as Teamsters leaders met in Washington to discuss a 
government proposal to settle the racketeering case. Cleveland made no public 
announcement of his resignation, but a union source confirmed Corley's account. 
The union rejected the settlement.

MOTH TARGETED FOR SPRAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Forest managers plan to spray bacteria on up to 105,000 acres of Plumas and 
Lassen national forests to combat the largest infestation of tussock moths in 
Northern California history. In June, airplanes will release droplets of 
Bacillus thuringiensis, a naturally occurring bacterium known as Bt, on the 
forests where the moths threaten to destroy 300 million board-feet of timber. 
Lawrence Crabtree, a U.S. Forest Service silviculturist who is coordinating the 
project, said the spraying will cost about $1.5 million. The moth, native to 
forests west of the Mississippi, typically experiences a population explosion 
every 10 to 12 years, Crabtree said. Tussock moths already have turned more 
than 50,000 acres of forest into a ghostly gray by nibbling the needles of 
white fir trees. Crabtree said larvae from millions of eggs laid last fall 
could spread the damage. Environmental groups said they may appeal, contending 
Bt also will kill other insects.

The breakaway white-supremacist wing of South Africa's Afrikaners has 
fragmented further with the formation of a neo-fascist movement to fight for a 
white homeland. The Afrikaner Liberation Movement was founded in Pretoria by 
three disaffected leaders and about 100 former members of Eugene Terre 
Blanche's paramilitary Afrikaner Resistance Movement. The founders, who 
recently failed to oust Terre Blanche, said they will "liberate the Afrikaner 
nation from foreign domination through the creation of a separate homeland." 
The group is the latest in a string of far-right organizations that oppose 
President Pieter W. Botha's limited reforms of apartheid.

State prisons may be located in two more San Joaquin Valley communities during 
the 1990s -- Porterville and Coalinga. Prisons have become the valley's biggest 
growth business of late with new men's lockups opening at Avenal and Corcoran 
in Kings County, the world's biggest women's prison being built in Madera 
County and smaller facilities on the boards in other valley towns. A state 
Department of Corrections report to the Legislature says plans are moving ahead 
to locate prisons at Coalinga in western Fresno County and at Porterville in 
southeastern Tulare County. A preliminary site evaluation under way at Coalinga 
should be finished by spring, the report added. And corrections officials hope 
to hold community meetings in the Porterville area later in the year before 
beginning site evaluations.

The outlawed Irish Republican Army pledged to take greater care to avoid 
causing civilian casualties after its political supporters criticized the 
guerrilla group for a series of botched bomb attacks in Northern Ireland. The 
pledge came in a message from the IRA's "army council" to the annual conference 
in Dublin, Ireland, of the group's legal political arm, Sinn Fein. However, the 
IRA said it will continue attacks against British military and security forces. 
Twenty-three civilians have been killed since November, 1987, by the IRA in 
guerrilla operations that went wrong.

Five fatal shootings in a 24-hour period made January the deadliest month ever 
in the nation's capital as Washington recorded 49 homicides. At the present 
pace, District of Columbia homicides would exceed 600 for the year. The 
District last year recorded 372 homicides, surpassing Detroit for the highest 
murder rate in the country. Police Chief Maurice T. Turner Jr. and Assistant 
Chief Isaac Fulwood Jr. are expected to unveil a proposal for dealing with the 
violence at a news conference today. Fulwood last week said the city's raging 
drug trade continues to be responsible for most of the gunplay.

Defending Sudanese troops ran out of ammunition and abandoned the southern 
garrison town of Nasir, besieged by rebels for more than nine months, the 
army's general command said. A statement said that more than 1,700 army and 
rebel troops were killed or wounded in the siege of the Upper Nile town. The 
official Sudan News Agency said that Col. Mahjoub Mohammed Yousif, commander of 
the garrison, was among those killed. The statement said government troops were 
forced to withdraw after bad weather interrupted air drops of much-needed 
ammunition and supplies. The fall of Nasir is seen as a major blow to the 
Khartoum government in the five-year-old civil war in the south.

THE THOROUGHLY CONTEMPORARY ROBERTSON DAVIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN HENDRIX, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robertson Davies is a 75-year-old Canadian writer with flowing white hair, 
beard and mustache, bright blue eyes and a very pink face. His portly bearing 
reflects the good food and drink he enjoys. He has kept the upper-class English 
accent he acquired while at Oxford half a century ago, and his diction and 
syntax have more in common with that time and place than the contemporary 
scene. His conversation is wide-ranging and his wit sharp, vast, sometimes 
bawdy and always learned -- full of plays on words, literary allusions and very 
eclectic esoterica. He has what has been called a cult following among his 
readers, and his persona seems that of an elitist fuddy-duddy who has known 
comfort and privilege for a very long time. 
</P>
<P>
The man does not look like a "women's libber." 
</P>
<P>
And yet it is one of the many ways in which he is modern. 
</P>
<P>
"Christianity has remarkably little to say about women. . . . Women cannot be 
expected to hold a wholly subordinate position. All this hullabaloo regarding 
women as priests is just a flea bite in a great struggle about what constitutes 
life in its fullness, about human balance." Davies made those remarks while 
sitting before the fire in the den of the Canadian consul general's house in 
Hancock Park where he and his wife of 48 years, Brenda Maddox, had been 
welcomed to Los Angeles, their first visit, with a luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
Here on a tour for "The Lyre of Orpheus," third novel of a trilogy that began 
with "Rebel Angels" and the best-selling "What's Bred in the Bone," he has, he 
said, been "running around like a mad dog since September." He was spending 
just one day in Los Angeles and it was raining. 
</P>
<P>
His writings appear old-fashioned, if not downright medieval, in their esoteric 
bits from astrology, hagiography, magic, the occult, the marvelous, 
Christianity, history, intricate and tricky plots, interactions of bizarre and 
mundane characters. But they are also full of Jungian analysis, myth, the 
eternal questions and modern dilemmas. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, his feminism is no contradiction. He has a moral vision and social 
consciousness that are anything but static. Like his novels, Davies seems to 
accommodate a lot and it all dwells inside him in a state of lively 
coexistence. He seems comfortable with paradox. More than anything, perhaps, he 
is an original. 
</P>
<P>
This is a man who does not drive a car, has "not much use" for computers and 
won't use a word processor, having ascertained it would take him six months to 
master one and "there's a lot I can do in six months without doing that." He 
deplores the loss of ritual in the Catholic Church and says, of onlookers with 
Protestant backgrounds like himself, "some of these hippie priests with guitars 
give us the jumps." Yet his mind is often on the future, and all that baggage 
he carries around from the past is what informs his vision of it. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to dip into a notion of Plato's that human history develops in 
2,000-year sections. The 2,000 years of Christian influence seem to be coming 
to a conclusion. The next is not known, but the hint is there in the area of 
technology. I think we're going to experience revelation of the marvelous in 
the next few hundred years." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Turning to the Marvelous 
</P>
<P>
As formal religion begins to lose its grip, he has often observed, people turn 
to the marvelous. At a simplistic level, people turn to popular astrology, 
teacup readings, card readings, superstition. That is not it, he says. Nor, 
necessarily, he said, is it the robots and computers of the future, since they 
are man-created and follow orders. They cannot tell us about anything 
important, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we'll be evolving something new, although we won't utterly desert 
Christianity. It has given us too much," he said, adding that compassion was 
perhaps its greatest contribution. It bears remembering, he said, that at the 
time of Christ, the city of Rome did not have a single hospital. 
</P>
<P>
One of the problems with Christianity, he said, is that it "urges us to 
perfection and perfection is inhuman. Perhaps the new thing will be to 
understand that wholeness rather than goodness is the thing to aim for." 
</P>
<P>
As the human race steps into the next millennium, he said, if women were more 
equal, "they could get down to what is deepest in femininity. They can teach 
us. Men are more aggressive, combative. Women are not perfect, but when they 
fight, they fight one at a time. They do not get organized very easily. Men are 
too easily herded into gangs and armies. This may be one of the great blessings 
of the future. It could lead to a totally new concept of war and politics, or 
the forgetting of war altogether." 
</P>
<P>
Society is far from there, and he has devoted one devastating page in "The Lyre 
of Orpheus" to the place of the social wife. It is wickedly satirical 
description of "dogsbody jobs associated with art and music which wealthy 
volunteers are graciously permitted to do by the professionals," and of the 
"great Ladder of Compassion," on which diseases are ordered in terms of 
prestige." 
</P>
<P>
"Cheap labor!" Davies said of the whole business, leaning forward and raising 
his voice to outrage. "They're getting them real cheap. Their reward will be 
some sort of vague social acclaim. It stinks, you know, the way in which women 
are exploited." 
</P>
<P>
Phrases like "Canada's pre-eminent man of letters" abound now and the 
provincial novelist has an international standing. It nettles him, however, 
that he was not taken seriously in Canada until he was taken seriously in the 
United States with the publication of "Fifth Business" in 1970, the first novel 
of his Deptford Trilogy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a fact Canada is obsessed with the United States. . . . It's true we have 
a feeling that a greater degree of sophistication in art exists here than in 
Canada. And, until recently, it seemed there was a greater sophistication 
financially as well." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Running Against Tide 
</P>
<P>
Mentioning the large real estate holdings Canadians have here, and Canadian 
ownership of "the big booze companies," he said, "suddenly we realize we own a 
big piece of the action. We may wake up to the fact we are not entirely 
insignificant in the actual world." 
</P>
<P>
Such awareness is still running against the tide, and he tells one story, a 
true one, he says, that he labels "the essence of Canada." 
</P>
<P>
It involves the late Prime Minister Lester Pearson, who prior to heading the 
government was active in the United Nations and was awarded the Nobel Peace 
Prize in 1957 for helping establish a U.N. Emergency Force after the 1956 
Egyptian-Israeli war. 
</P>
<P>
"A friend of mine was at a cocktail party in Vancouver," Davies said, "when 
someone came running in, saying: 'Have you heard the news? Mike Pearson got the 
Nobel Peace Prize.' 
</P>
<P>
"There was silence and then one little old lady spoke up and said, "Well! Just 
who does he think he is?' That's Canada." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
America's Ignorance 
</P>
<P>
At the same time he has rather acerbic observations to make about Americans' 
relative ignorance or indifference to "the rather large land mass north of the 
border" and has particular disdain for the weather maps he sees on American 
television news where there's a vast blank to the north. 
</P>
<P>
Later that night he gently chided an amused audience of 300 seemingly devoted 
fans about that land mass to the north. He read to a packed house at UCLA's 
Dickson Auditorium. A former actor with England's Old Vic company, he is a 
performer and chose several very dramatic passages, full of dialogue and wit, 
to his audience's obvious delight. 
</P>
<P>
They loved it, as they had John Espey's introduction of him. Espey, a retired 
UCLA professor, had been at Oxford with Davies in the late '30s. The two of 
them, Espey told the audience, represented fully half the membership of the 
Long Christmas Dinner Club, an elitist little Canadian/American group that 
named itself after a play of Thornton Wilder's, and dressed formally for dinner 
several times a term, ate and drank a lot and played literary hoaxes on the 
English. 
</P>
<P>
Such privileged pranks seemed a far cry from the circumstances and politics of 
the UCLA audience, but his fans savored the revelation.

DEUKMEJIAN'S HEALTH CARE BUDGET CUTS FEARED BY POOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN R. CHURM, Times Staff Writer

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Esther Alvarez considers a move to a nursing home a death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
It is a life style she tasted last fall when she fell and broke her hip. For 30 
days, she recuperated in a convalescent home, and nearly ever day she cried. 
</P>
<P>
"At home I feel alive," Alvarez said. "But at that nursing home, I felt dead." 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez, 62, and her 86-year-old husband now live in the Santa Ana home of 
their daughter, and the family receives a monthly check from the state to help 
pay the costs of caring for the elder Alvarezes. 
</P>
<P>
But Esther Alvarez, who has suffered two strokes and is confined to a 
wheelchair, worries that her daughter won't be able to afford caring for her 
anymore. 
</P>
<P>
Governor George Deukmejian's proposed budget for 1989-90 would cut $485 million 
from health and welfare services. Among those programs marked for reductions 
are the In-Home Supportive Services Program, which the Alvarezes receive, Aid 
to Families With Dependent Children, Planned Parenthood and Indigent Medical 
Services. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Swollen State Budget 
</P>
<P>
The governor defends the proposed cuts as necessary to balance the swollen 
state budget. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Democrat-controlled Legislature will have a chance to propose 
changes in the budget during upcoming hearings in Sacramento. The final budget 
won't emerge until after the governor has had a chance to blue-pencil the 
changes adopted by state lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
County and private health care advocates, however, fear the consequences. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wonder how many more people this will push over the edge and into the 
streets," said Jean Forbath, director of Share Our Selves in Costa Mesa, which 
gives food and medical aid to the poor. "A lot of people in this county are 
trying to make a go of it. But holding a steady job in a place like Orange 
County doesn't guarantee a roof over one's head or a hot meal 3 times a day. 
</P>
<P>
"It's expensive to live here," she said, "and those programs are critical to a 
lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
Until last August, Alvarez and her husband, a retired construction worker in 
poor health, lived by themselves. The $548 they receive from the in-home 
services program was used to hire an attendant to help the couple cook, clean 
and shop. But under the program, the couple could pay only minimum wage. And 
the state restricted the number of hours funded to 79 a month. 
</P>
<P>
None of those hired lasted long. 
</P>
<P>
"It boiled down to finding someone willing to work part time for minimum wage," 
said Alvarez's daughter, Rosie Griggs. "Under those restraints, it's tough 
finding quality help." 
</P>
<P>
Frustrated by the turnover in help, Griggs and her husband moved the couple to 
their home. "It just seemed like it would be easier this way," she said. 
</P>
<P>
For a time, Griggs managed to juggle her family, including a 7-year-old son, 
her job at an electronics firm and her parents. Then her mother broke her hip, 
and Griggs struggled with the load. When her mother returned from the 
convalescent hospital just before the holidays, Griggs took a medical leave 
from work to be at home more. 
</P>
<P>
She returned to work just last week. 
</P>
<P>
"We're luckier than most," Griggs said. "We have enough money to cover whatever 
the state cuts. And my mom and dad have a home here for as long as they want. 
</P>
<P>
"But what about those that don't have a cushion, or family to lean on. What are 
they going to do?" 
</P>
<P>
The way Leroy Hinkley figures it, the state's in-home services program has 
given him a few extra years with his three "kids." 
</P>
<P>
The kids are Wolfer, Tippy and Johnny: a pit bull, collie and a mutt. And his 
home is a white clapboard house on Main Street near 17th in Santa Ana, where he 
has lived since childhood. 
</P>
<P>
Now 80, Hinkley is in failing health. He has diabetes and his hearing is 
failing. He moves slowly, relying on his rusted metal walker. 
</P>
<P>
Though social workers say he would be better off in a home with 24-hour medical 
care, Hinkley, who never married, has refused to leave the dogs. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't abandon your family," he said as Wolfer begged Hinkley to play ball, 
circling the room clenching a semi-deflated volleyball in his teeth. "You can't 
find this kind of friendship in one of those fancy homes for old people." 
</P>
<P>
Because of his age and health, Hinkley can't adequately care for himself. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, he has used the $335 he receives from the in-home services 
program to hire outside help. But, as many of the 4,500 county residents in the 
program have found, it has never been enough money to keep anyone more than a 
month or two. And the governor's budget would cut $50 from that $335. 
</P>
<P>
"Being able to stay home has meant a lot to Leroy," said Carol Bade, a social 
worker at VIP Center, the adult day center where Hinkley goes several days a 
week. "The state has given Leroy that chance to be happy in his older years." 
</P>
<P>
As a teen-ager, Yvette Bennett promised herself she would not end up on welfare 
like her mother. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett grew up in Sunset Beach, the oldest of five children. Her parents 
divorced when she was 13, and her mother raised the children without support 
from their father, Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite her pledge, Bennett's life has nearly mirrored her mother's. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like it, but I'm a welfare mother," said the 28-year-old Bennett, a 
Huntington Beach High School graduate, who notes proudly that she is a 
fourth-generation Orange Countian. 
</P>
<P>
She married young, then divorced 4 years ago, gaining custody of her 5-year-old 
son but no financial support from her former husband. To pay rent and buy food, 
she worked during the day as a nurse's aide at a convalescent home and at night 
as a clerk at a 7-Eleven. 
</P>
<P>
Between the two, she made "good money," but worried that she never saw her son. 
</P>
<P>
"He would complain to me, 'Mommy, I never see you. I miss you.' It tore me up," 
Bennett said. "I became depressed and friends told me to quit work and go on 
welfare. . . . I resisted for a while, but then I decided my son was more 
important." 
</P>
<P>
Last June, as a single mother with a child, she qualified to receive $535 a 
month through the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program. She joined 
about 55,000 other county residents in the program, many of them like her, 
single and unemployed with children. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett moved to Anaheim and rented a one-bedroom apartment for $525 a month. 
She also began receiving $87 a month in food stamps. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Bennett made a go of it, but by November she couldn't pay the rent, 
and on Christmas Eve, she was evicted. She sold her furniture, and has been 
living with family and friends since. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's face it, I'm poor. And some of this is my own doing," Bennett said. "But 
I'm trying. I'm not lying in the gutter. I want to work and I want stay in 
Orange County. . . . But sometimes, I don't know if I can." 
</P>
<P>
Jean Shanks was going to high school in New Mexico when she first went to 
Planned Parenthood for advice and protection. 
</P>
<P>
"I was 15 and becoming sexually active," recalled Shanks, now 32 and living in 
Orange. "For $3 I got an examination, some advice and a supply of birth control 
pills. It was reassuring." 
</P>
<P>
In December, 1987, two weeks after Shanks and her family moved from Albuquerque 
to Orange County, she again found herself in a jam. Her husband, a construction 
worker, had been hit by a truck on a job site and seriously injured. Shanks, a 
legal secretary, had not yet begun to look for work and her birth control 
prescription was nearly gone.

"I remembered Planned Parenthood so I went to the local office," she said. "I 
had $7 in my purse and that was it." 
</P>
<P>
It was enough. She received an examination and a new prescription, services 
that would have cost more than a $100 from a private physician. 
</P>
<P>
A recommendation to eliminate state money for family planning agencies would 
save an estimated $36 million a year, state officials say. 
</P>

About 31,000 low-income women in Orange County visited family planning clinics 
in 1988.

"I would have been up a creek if they hadn't been there," Shanks said. "It 
seems to me it would be a whole lot cheaper to help women get protection from 
pregnancy than helping pay for an unwanted baby."

<P>
Maria Elena Romo has a weak heart. 
</P>
<P>
Romo, 57, who lives with her daughter in Costa Mesa, has been hospitalized 3 
times in recent years for heart complications, the last time in December at 
Hoag Memorial Presbyterian Hospital in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Her medical treatment and medicine are paid by the county's Indigent Medical 
Services program, which serves 12,000 county residents. But a proposed 
$333-million cut in state funding for such programs would mean Romo could only 
get help if she became critically ill. 
</P>
<P>
"Maria Elena could only qualify for help if her heart failed," said Vicki 
Mayster, a health official at the Share Our Selves medical clinic, where Romo 
receives treatment. "It would have to be a matter of life and death before the 
state would probably step in under the proposed budget reductions." 
</P>
<P>
Romo, who raised nine children in a Mexican border town, said the program has 
kept her alive. 
</P>
<P>
"It has let me be with my children and grandchildren and I am thankful."

PEOPLE / HERBERT J. VIDA: HOBBYIST HAS THE MOST TOY SOLDIERS IN THIS MAN'S ARMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Charles A. Mitchell marches off to war every other Friday night, sometimes 
carrying several regiments of his 5,000-man army in his briefcase. 
</P>
<P>
"I go to war for two reasons," the 48-year-old Garden Grove resident said. 
"First, it fulfills one part of my character, the one looking for adventure and 
excitement of 19th-Century warfare. The other is a chance to express my 
artistic talents." 
</P>
<P>
These war games, however, are played with toy soldiers on the living room floor 
or a table-top. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell said he also finds great joy researching military excursions from the 
Civil War to World War II, and using those tactics to win battles. 
</P>
<P>
The artistic outlet comes from the countless hours he spends making 
1/4-inch-tall lead soldiers used to fight his wars. He has to use a magnifying 
glass to make and paint them. 
</P>
<P>
"I found that we could have more equipment and soldiers if we played the war 
games with the smaller scale," said Mitchell, who claims the war games are more 
complicated than chess. "There are more players on a side, more human factors 
and more complexities in movement." 
</P>
<P>
Playing the war game, he points out, "is a matter of placing yourself in a 
historical situation and testing your mental capabilities, tactics and strategy 
against another individual or a computer." 
</P>
<P>
It's also a time when "the natural aggression of people surfaces. And it's a 
healthy way of experiencing (that) aggression during a table-top battle with 
little toy soldiers rather than taking it out on a friend at some other time." 
Mitchell, a Costa Mesa discount store manager, said he first started collecting 
toy soldiers at age 6 with a box of 4-inch-tall toy soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been collecting toy soldiers ever since," he said. "But I didn't really 
start taking care of them until I was a teen-ager. Over the years, I guess I've 
gained a reputation for making the smaller figures." 
</P>
<P>
But now, "I take the war games seriously," said Mitchell, who also makes and 
paints 3/4-inch-tall and larger soldiers, horses, ships, tanks and other 
military armament that are stored in a windowed cabinet in his living room. 
</P>
<P>
He and a group of 30 men meet in each other's living rooms, where the war games 
are held on the floor or table-top, depending on the scope of the military 
action and armament chosen for the battle. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell said that sometimes there is no winner. "That usually happens when we 
run out of time," he said. "We lose track of time and find we can't complete 
the battle. We have to go to work in the morning." 
</P>
<P>
He said each war team has three or four members. 
</P>
<P>
In between, he sharpens his competitive skills by playing bridge. Mitchell and 
his wife, Dianne, are bridge life masters. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have liked to be a general during some of the great wars," said 
Mitchell, 48, who was in the Army at a time when the country was not at war. "I 
was always fascinated with war and have researched them all." 
</P>
<P>
During the summer, he takes trips to Ft. Tejon State Historic Park near Gorman 
to watch simulated Civil War battles with real people. 
</P>
<P>
But Mitchell also has a more modern-day fantasy. "I would like to be one of the 
people who fly the space shuttle." 
</P>
<P>
Eric Mowrey, 20, of Costa Mesa thought he had the winning combination in a 
"crazy idea" contest sponsored by Los Angeles radio station KLOS. The prize was 
two tickets to Super Bowl XXIII in Miami and a little spending money. 
</P>
<P>
Mowrey, billing himself as a Human Bowling Unit, slid 32 feet on a plastic 
sheet through a mixture of mustard, ketchup and chocolate syrup and scored a 
strike by knocking down 10 bowling pins. He was wearing a football helmet. 
</P>
<P>
But Mowrey's wacky antics only netted him second place and a $500 prize, 
according to station spokeswoman Ann Cerussi. 
</P>
<P>
The winners were two Los Angeles men who shaved their heads, painted their 
bodies like Cincinnati uniforms and played "The Star Spangled Banner" with a 
trumpet and cymbals. 
</P>
<P>
They were also blindfolded and hanging upside down, 30 feet in the air.

MILD TEMBLOR JIGGLES BUT CAUSES NO DAMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A mild earthquake of 2.8 magnitude struck 4 miles north of Newport Beach on 
Sunday evening, alarming many residents but apparently causing no injury or 
damage, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The temblor rocked Newport Beach and surrounding cities at 7:01 p.m., Caltech 
spokesman Robert Finn said in Pasadena. An earthquake of 3.5 magnitude can 
cause slight damage in a local area. 
</P>
<P>
A Newport Beach police dispatcher said the station "had one call asking if we 
had one." 
</P>
<P>
Police in Fountain Valley and Costa Mesa had more callers but took no reports 
of damage or injury, spokesmen said. 
</P>
<P>
Most callers simply wanted to verify that what they felt had been an 
earthquake, Costa Mesa Sgt. John Pherrin said. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people thought it was an explosion," he said. "We felt it here, but it 
was real mild."

POSTSCRIPT: LATINO WORKERS DRIFT BACK TO SITE THAT DREW COMPLAINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM CARLTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last month, the city of Laguna Beach opened an outdoor hiring hall on a remote 
stretch of Laguna Canyon Road in hopes of luring Latino dayworkers away from a 
Coast Highway convenience store, where they drew complaints. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, the plan worked. But now some of the dayworkers have drifted back to 
their old haunt, complaining that the canyon is too cold. The Circle K store, 
they say, is warm and has food and coffee. And, they say, it seems easier to 
find jobs in town than out in the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
"Little by little, we are returning," said Juan Diaz, 25, an immigrant from 
Acapulco, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
The management at Circle K, however, is not so happy. Neither are some 
residents, who fear the dozen or so workers milling near their homes each 
morning will swell back to nearly 100, as was the situation before the city in 
mid-December set up its hiring hall on a dirt parking lot along Laguna Canyon 
Road. 
</P>
<P>
"My heart goes out to them, but I can't take this," said Sydney Mack, a woman 
who lives on nearby Chiquita Street. "I am considering moving from my home of 
17 years." 
</P>
<P>
Perminder Singh, the Circle K manager, said he has noticed a gradual increase 
in the number of workers congregating outside his business on the corner of 
North Coast Highway and Viejo Street. 
</P>
<P>
"It was good for a couple of days, but now they are starting to come back," 
Singh said Thursday morning as 15 dayworkers mingled outside his store. At the 
canyon pickup site, about 45 men waited for jobs at the same time Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody knows what to do now," Singh said. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Kenneth C. Frank acknowledged that the city's plan has not removed 
all the day laborers from north Laguna Beach. But a spot check by city 
employees last week found only six workers at the Circle K and 57 at the canyon 
location, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying it's perfect (but) we think it's been pretty darn successful," 
Frank said. "I mean, look at what's happening in Orange," where dayworkers 
congregate on Chapman Avenue. "They've had raids, leaned on people and the 
workers are right back." 
</P>
<P>
The number of workers at the Circle K has been so reduced that they pose little 
of the problem they did before, Frank said. Neighbors had complained that the 
laborers' urinated and defecated in public, and Circle K management complained 
that they harassed female customers and shoplifted. 
</P>
<P>
Singh said those problems are returning. 
</P>
<P>
"The ladies, especially, are scared to come in here," Singh said. 
</P>
<P>
But workers outside Singh's store denied that they caused problems. 
</P>
<P>
"We are here to work, that is all," said Pablo Martinez, 40, of Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez, who left a wife and 10 children in Mexico to find work in the United 
States, said that he spent a few days at the Laguna Canyon job site but quickly 
returned to the Coast Highway site. 
</P>
<P>
"It is sunnier here earlier," Martinez said. "In the canyon it is very cold." 
</P>
<P>
At the canyon site, where several workers wore scarfs over their faces to ward 
off the 48-degree chill, Eutimio Mancilla, 26, of Acapulco, said through 
chattering teeth, "It's too cold in this place. In this place it is cold every 
morning." 
</P>
<P>
It also draws fewer employers, the men say. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the Circle K, Lino Quintana, 35, an immigrant from the Mexican state of 
Guerrero, said patrones, American employers, stop there for coffee and 
laborers. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, some Latino workers said they feel safer from immigration raids at the 
convenience store -- where they can scan approaching streets -- than in the 
canyon, where Laguna Canyon Road curves quickly out of view. "Also there is no 
place to hide (in the canyon)," Diaz said. 
</P>
<P>
Frank said, however, that the exact opposite is true. A sweep through Laguna 
Beach last week by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service concentrated 
in the northern area, resulting in a few apprehensions of undocumented workers, 
Frank said. But the INS left the new hiring hall location alone. 
</P>
<P>
"The INS is cooperating to keep the pressure on north Laguna," Frank said.

PENTECOSTAL GROUP VOTES TO VINDICATE FOUNDER 
</P>

<P>
Ending an acrimonious battle in a well-known Pentecostal body, the board of the 
Full Gospel Business Men's Fellowship International voted overwhelmingly Sunday 
to absolve its founder-president of "supposed improper practice" in financial 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
Directors of the Costa Mesa-based worldwide fellowship voted, 79-17, with 2 
abstentions, to "vindicate" Demos Shakarian, 75. The board also restored his 
full authority as president. The actions, in effect, repudiated charges made by 
the board's audit committee. 
</P>
<P>
Committee members -- acting to protect the nonprofit body's tax-exempt status, 
they said -- had informed the Internal Revenue Service last year that Shakarian 
received $276,000 in unreported benefits and undocumented expenses that would 
have to be counted as income, from 1981 to 1987. 
</P>
<P>
But Shakarian's backers have insisted that insurance and disability-related 
benefits were authorized by the board and that his travel expenses could be 
nearly all accounted for. 
</P>
<P>
Shakarian said the accusations against him arose from a bid for control of the 
fellowship by a 15-man executive committee of the board. 
</P>
<P>
But Bill Weaver of Oklahoma City, one of the board members accused of engaging 
in a power play, said there was no vindictiveness involved. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm simply saying his bookkeeping is atrocious," Weaver said in a voice loud 
enough to be heard in the hall outside the closed meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Executive Vice President Gene Ellerbee said he assured board members that 
Shakarian, a millionaire with extensive property holdings, will take 
responsibility for any money he might owe the IRS. 
</P>
<P>
Shakarian is considered one of the pioneers in spreading the Pentecostal 
version of Christianity, which is distinguished by speaking in tongues, healing 
claims and belief in everyday occurrences of the supernatural. 
</P>
<P>
The now-retired dairyman started the fellowship in 1952 at lunch meetings with 
business and professional men in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The noontime exchanges of stories of faith became a feature of chapters around 
the world, thus blunting the previous image of Pentecostalism as appealing only 
to uneducated Christians low on the socioeconomic scale. 
</P>
<P>
Shakarian, partly disabled by a stroke in 1984, was nevertheless vigorous in 
speaking briefly to board members during the daylong debate Sunday. He 
alternately threatened to quit and urged them to settle the 2-year dispute. 
</P>
<P>
"If I take a walk, what will you do?" Shakarian was heard to ask. 
</P>
<P>
Income from donors in about 96 countries where the fellowship has chapters has 
dropped from about $6.5 million in 1986 to just below $4 million in 1988, 
fellowship officials say.

NOTEBOOK: TED BUNDY'S DEATH CLOSES CHAPTER, BUT NOT WOUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK I. PINSKY, Times Staff Writer Mark I. Pinsky is a staff writer for the 
Orange County Edition of The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By its nature, murder is difficult to comprehend in any rational context. This 
is especially true of gruesome serial killings. Encountering one charged with 
that level of violence sitting neat and clean in a well-lighted room makes it 
even more difficult to envision him committing the brutal and bizarre acts 
alleged in the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
I thought about how difficult last week as news coverage surrounding the 
execution of serial killer Ted Bundy reached a crescendo, sending my mind 
reeling back more than a decade to a county jail cell in Tallahassee, Fla., 
where I spent an hour with Bundy. At the time, I was a free-lance writer based 
in North Carolina, writing about sensational murder cases in the South. 
</P>
<P>
This kind of life carried with it many occupational hazards, in addition to 
journalism's nearly inescapable one of profiting from the misfortune of others. 
If, as a reporter, you acknowledge the horror you see, you run the risk of 
becoming emotionally paralyzed and unable to do your job. On the other hand, if 
you shield yourself from the horror, you do a disservice to the reader by 
making the events seem routine. 
</P>
<P>
My meeting with Bundy in his cell -- a journalistic coup that infuriated the 
sheriff and jailers -- was one of the most disconcerting experiences of my 
life. Until then, all the murderers or accused murderers I had met were in some 
way different from me: a different race, a different class, a different sex. 
Because of this, I could do what psychologists call dissociate: make the 
killing abstract and unreal, even when the person I was interviewing admitted 
the killing. 
</P>
<P>
There was none of that with Bundy. As I entered his cell, he was listening to 
jazz on a college radio station, volunteering that he listened to "All Things 
Considered," a National Public Radio news program, "every night -- without 
fail." He was white, middle class, educated, well-spoken, well-read, 
politically sophisticated -- albeit a bit conservative for my taste -- and my 
age. Dressed in a dull green jumpsuit, he sported a fresh haircut and a red 
rubber band on his right wrist. He had woven a serviceable jump rope from 
shredded sheets, which he used to exercise regularly in his cell. 
</P>
<P>
Bundy said he was innocent, as did most of the people I interviewed in jail in 
those days, but I had done enough research to feel he was guilty, and was 
frankly more interested in the way he talked about his home life, his time in 
college and on the road. He was, by turns, relaxed, earnest, reflective and 
even humorous about himself and his predicament. 
</P>
<P>
"People have a picture of me which is not accurate," he complained. He said he 
felt "pegged to the wall like a butterfly." As for the criminal justice system, 
he said, "I was one of those naive Americans . . . who never gave it a second 
thought. Criminals? They got what they deserved." He said he did not hate women 
and was "as capable of feeling love as anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
He said his childhood was "not idyllic" but "very ordinary," with "parents who 
never fought, didn't smoke." There was "no harsh discipline" or abuse, he 
recalled, and "I didn't need to get into trouble to get attention." 
</P>
<P>
He had a definite sense about his situation at the time. "The intensity of the 
people here in Florida indicates to me that it's going to be very difficult to 
get a fair trial," he said. "It's not as though I don't think I'll ever be free 
again. It's not a hope that I cling to. . . . It's not that I don't have any 
remorse. I don't have any responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
After a time, he convinced me, sort of. I got the eerie feeling that he did not 
kill all those people. At the same time, I felt a strong sense of menace -- 
that the cunning person who did commit the murders was tucked in the folds of 
Bundy's cortex. 
</P>
<P>
More troubling was the thought that, if someone like him is capable of murder, 
then perhaps someone like me is capable of murder as well. 
</P>
<P>
One night during Bundy's subsequent trial in Miami, I was having dinner with a 
television reporter, also covering the trial. Without warning, the weight of 
what I had seen and heard that day in court crashed down on me and I started to 
weep. After that, I resolved to get off the murder beat. 
</P>
<P>
The night before Ted Bundy was executed, I rummaged through my papers to find 
my interview notes. I found the legal pad and turned to the last page of 
writing. To verify that, despite the jail's restrictions, the meeting had taken 
place in his cell, I asked Bundy to sign the pad when the hour was over. He 
wrote: "Dear Mark, Thank you for allowing me this interview. Theodore Robert 
Bundy."

SEPARATING THE FACTS FROM OPINIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN EISENBERG, Baltimore Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fact: Until the San Francisco 49ers' Super Bowl victory, never before had teams 
from one state simultaneously held the pro football, baseball and basketball 
championships. (You can look it up.) 
</P>
<P>
Opinion: Had cornerback Lewis Billups not dropped an easy interception in the 
end zone in the third quarter, the Cincinnati Bengals would have won the Super 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Fact: Eight of the top 12 scorers in this week's National Basketball Assn. 
rankings left college before their senior years. 
</P>
<P>
Opinion: I'm so happy George Steinbrenner was pardoned. 
</P>
<P>
Fact: Larry Brown already is quietly complaining that he is miserable coaching 
the San Antonio Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
Opinion: Pistons and Lakers in the finals. Pistons in six. 
</P>
<P>
Fact: About 79% of the Proposition 48 cases are eligible. 
</P>
<P>
Opinion: You can have my seat to Leonard-Hearns. A couple of has-beens. 
</P>
<P>
Fact: One year ago, college basketball's ultimate national champions were in 
the middle of a four-game losing streak, their record dropping to 12-8. 
</P>
<P>
Opinion: Charles Oakley for Bill Cartwright is the most lopsided trade of the 
year in sports. 
</P>
<P>
Fact: Carl Yastrzemski's father, Carl Sr., still works a daily shift at the 
port in Boston Harbor. He is 72 and works inside maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
Opinion: Making Dave Schmidt a permanent starter is a good move. The Orioles 
should have done it 2 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Fact: There was a standing ovation the other night at Halsey Field House when 
poor Derric Turner, the Navy basketball player who is 6 for 44 shooting free 
throws this season, made one against UNC Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
Opinion: With freshman Alonzo Mourning and sophomores Dikembe Motumbo and John 
Turner, Georgetown has truly frightening potential. I can see the Hoyas winning 
2 national championships in the next 4 years. 
</P>
<P>
Fact: Seventeen of pro basketball's 25 head coaches are in their first or 
second seasons with their current teams. (On the other hand, head coaches in 
the Big East, Big Ten and Atlantic Coast Conference have been in their current 
positions an average of 9 years.) 
</P>
<P>
Opinion: It says much about the state of American soccer when, in the year the 
national team finally should qualify for the World Cup, the coach of the team, 
Luthar Osiander, quits because he would rather be a maitre d' at a restaurant 
in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Fact: Oregon State basketball Coach Ralph Miller, retiring this year after 38 
years in the business, knew James Naismith, who invented the game. 
</P>
<P>
Opinion: It's popular to say Mario Lemieux is hockey's best player now because 
he is far ahead of Wayne Gretzky in the scoring race. Before this becomes law, 
however, it might be nice for Lemieux to lead a team to the playoffs once. 
</P>
<P>
Fact: The Maryland basketball team has not won a game this year. 
</P>
<P>
Opinion: Back from the Supe in Miami, I must admit I like stone crabs more than 
Maryland crabs. (Nah, did I say that?) 
</P>
<P>
Fact: Reggie Lewis is averaging 19 points as Larry Bird's replacement. 
</P>
<P>
Opinion: I bet Dan Quayle has a lot to say about Proposal 42. 
</P>
<P>
Fact: The Blast of the Major Indoor Soccer League had 10 days off, then played 
back-to-back games this week. 
</P>
<P>
Opinion: Pete Rozelle, the old pitchman, is losing his public relations touch. 
Before the Super Bowl, he said the Overtown riots had "ruined part of his 
week," and that the leftovers from his mega-party would be given to the 
homeless. Such compassion. 
</P>
<P>
Fact: After only 4 months at No. 2, Ivan Lendl again is the world's No. 1 
tennis player after winning the Australian Open. 
</P>
<P>
Opinion: There is no better show in college basketball this year than Louisiana 
State freshman Chris Jackson. Yow.

THE CAN'T-MISS KID COMES HOME; 
</P>
<P>
FORMER KING CARPENTER TRIES TO SALVAGE CAREER IN BOSTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At 17, when most kids are posing for prom pictures, Bobby Carpenter was posing 
for the cover of Sports Illustrated. A police officer's son and the pride of 
Peabody, Mass., he was the first American-born hockey player to go directly 
from high school to the National Hockey League. SI dubbed him "The Can't-Miss 
Kid." 
</P>
<P>
Eight years later, "The Can't-Miss Kid" has missed three times -- with the 
Washington Capitals, New York Rangers and Kings -- and now he comes home to 
play for the Bruins as something less than a conquering hero. 
</P>
<P>
His right hand, owing to a New Year's Eve collision with a goal pipe during the 
Soviet series, is in a cast. His career, owing to the fact he has scored only 
66 goals in his last 250 games, is in a rut. His contract, a 4-year, 
$1.6-million deal he signed after scoring a career-high 53 goals for the 
Capitals during the 1984-85 season, is in its option year. 
</P>
<P>
But when it comes to the NHL, how many options does Bobby Carpenter have left? 
True, he's only 25, but in the last 2 years, he's been marked down more often 
than month-old milk. If he fails here, the Bruins will practically have to give 
him away. Has Bobby Carpenter come home to stand trial in a hockey court of 
last resort? 
</P>
<P>
"There's no middle ground for me here," Carpenter said. "A player in my 
situation has to be real good, or I'm going to be considered a real bomb." 
</P>
<P>
In many quarters, he has been considered a real bomb ever since that 1984-85 
season -- the last time his contract was in its option year -- when he became 
the first American-born player to score more than 50 goals. Coming as it did 
after seasons of 32, 32 and 28 goals, it seemed to announce Carpenter's 
expected entry into hockey's highest echelon. 
</P>
<P>
It was a brief stay. Carpenter scored only 27 goals in the 1985-86 season. But 
for the fifth consecutive season, he played in every game. And as his points 
plummeted to what was then a career-low 56, so did his already uneasy 
relationship with Capital Coach Brian Murray. 
</P>
<P>
Physically, Carpenter was tough. Despite shoulder and other injuries, he played 
hurt. But mentally, he wasn't so tough. When things weren't going his way, he 
sulked. He sulked a lot. 
</P>
<P>
"Bobby, he's a different (type of) guy," said Scott Stevens, Carpenter's 
closest friend on the Capitals and a member of Carpenter's wedding party. "He's 
very honest. Most people would say something to someone (just) to make them 
feel good. Bobby's not like that." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really hard on myself," Carpenter said. "I always have been. I can't let 
things go by real easily. I wish I could. When I get down on myself, it's tough 
for me to bounce back." 
</P>
<P>
The ocean floor is higher than Carpenter was at the start of the 1986-87 
season, when he suggested that perhaps he and the team might be better off if 
he went elsewhere. Angry Capital management told Carpenter to go home, where he 
sat in limbo for 6 weeks while they worked out a trade with the Rangers, who 
used him sparingly in 28 games before trading him to the Kings in exchange for 
aging star Marcel Dionne. 
</P>
<P>
It was in Washington that Carpenter earned a reputation, perhaps undeserved, as 
a spoiled brat. More than 2 years after he and the Capitals said good riddance, 
Carpenter stiffened noticeably when asked about his Washington experience. 
Brusquely, he declined. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter is not an easy guy to get to know. Reporters on both coasts who 
covered him for several years regard him as distant, strained. Bruin General 
Manager Harry Sinden says Carpenter is shy. Even his father, whom Bobby says he 
is very close to, describes his son as "a very private person," someone who 
would rarely share innermost thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
"He never did like the limelight," Bob Sr. said. "He'd just as soon go to the 
game and have nobody (media) there." 
</P>
<P>
Many players feel that way. The difference is in how they handle it. Bob Sr. 
says the family wanted Bobby to go to college (he would have gone to 
Providence) rather than directly to the NHL, because it would have helped him 
mature. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew what he was going to have to go through," Bob Sr. said. "You can't buy 
the things you lost. You lose phases of growing up. You never handle them 
smoothly." 
</P>
<P>
When Carpenter came into the league, the Capitals announced his signing by 
opening up the raw bar and a ritzy room at the Capital Centre. Two U.S. 
Congressmen, one member of the White House staff, and dozens of members of the 
national media attended. 
</P>
<P>
When Carpenter came to the Boston Garden Friday for his first Bruin practice, 
he was greeted only by several local reporters, and an arena full of empty 
seats. Bobby Carpenter is no longer big news. 
</P>
<P>
After the quick shuffle and lost season -- 9 goals -- of 1986-87, he'd hoped to 
find himself, and his game, in L.A. in the 1987-88 season. And while he found 
more playing time than the Rangers had given him, he found nearly as much 
frustration, with 19 goals and 33 assists in 71 games. 
</P>
<P>
All his life, Carpenter had been a center. Sure, he played wing in the Canada 
Cup, and in a pinch, but it was not his preferred position. But somewhere along 
the line, he says, people got the idea he was a wing. 
</P>
<P>
Then the Kings got Wayne Gretzky. They had Carpenter and Gretzky room together 
in training camp, perhaps hoping that a bit of The Great One would rub off on a 
would-be great one. They put Carpenter on Gretzky's left wing. If that's not 
hockey heaven, what is? 
</P>
<P>
It stayed that way the first 17 games of this season, but Carpenter wasn't 
reminding anybody of Jari Kurri. Before the New Year's Eve injury, Carpenter 
had 11 goals and 15 assists in 39 games, 4 goals in his last 21. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter says the Kings had too many offensive players to fit him in, that 
while he did get to play on lines with Gretzky and Bernie Nicholls, he only got 
to play four or five shifts per game with them because he wasn't used to kill 
penalties or on every goal-scorer's dream assignment, the power play. 
</P>
<P>
"I was happy in L.A., and they were very happy with me," Carpenter said. "But 
they had too many great players, too many great goal-scorers. Now they expect 
you to get 30 goals when you're not even on the power play. What they expected 
me to do, and what they put me in the position to do, were two different 
things." 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter always seems to have an excuse why things have gone awry since that 
53-goal season. Some people say he's overprotective of his right shoulder -- 
which he first injured the season before he scored 53 -- and therefore lacks 
the hellbent aggressiveness that, combined with his speed, shot and 
stick-handling, set him apart. 
</P>
<P>
"The year after he scored the 53 goals, he wasn't getting involved in the 
corners, bumping and grinding as much," Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
Sinden says Carpenter was his former aggressive self when the Bruins scouted 
him this season. Carpenter was being very aggressive -- diving over the Soviet 
goaltender -- when he injured his wrist and hand, which should be OK in 2 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Kasper, whom Sinden traded to get Carpenter, is a great defensive center, 
but goals are what the Bruins need. Playing center, Carpenter -- who only had 
one more goal than Kasper when the trade was made -- is confident he can supply 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"When you score 53 goals at (age) 20," Sinden said, "you've got some kind of 
talent. It may be innate, or inert, at this time. I don't know. If he doesn't 
score a lot of goals, it won't bother them (his teammates). If he jumps in and 
plays hard, they'll accept him." 
</P>
<P>
Feeling awkward already, Carpenter knows acceptance may not come easily. Kasper 
was one of the most popular Bruins. The day after he was traded, his former 
teammates each got ahold of some adhesive tape and affixed a makeshift "11", 
Kasper's number, to their sweaters. Defenseman Ray Bourque, a future Hall of 
Famer and the unofficial conscience of the team, publicly criticized Sinden for 
making the trade. 
</P>
<P>
No, they're not jumping for joy that Bobby's come marching home. 
</P>
<P>
"He's tainted (in the NHL)," Sinden said. "He's probably perceived as a little 
brat. When it was happening in D.C., I was saying to myself, 'What's the matter 
with that kid?' " 
</P>
<P>
Nothing, they used to say. Remember that 1981 draft day? The Hartford Whalers, 
picking fourth overall, were all set to draft Carpenter when the Capitals 
swapped No. 1 slots with the then-Colorado Rockies -- picking third -- and 
grabbed him. The Whalers had to settle for Ron Francis. Sometimes you win when 
you lose. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter's father, who liked Whaler management and the easy drive to Hartford, 
was furious that day. Eight years later, he laughs about how naive, how 
narrow-minded he was about where his son should and would play. Things change. 
</P>
<P>
So do perceptions. When Bobby was starting out in the NHL and things didn't 
always go his way, Bob Sr. says he always sided with him. Now, he doesn't. And 
he admits he "was probably wrong" to be so quick to see it his son's way in the 
early days. 
</P>
<P>
"It happens to everyone," Bob Sr. said. "The coach isn't always going to like 
you. Everyone's not always going to do what you say." 
</P>
<P>
But if you can put the puck in the net, they'll learn to love you. The Bruins 
are hoping to love Bobby Carpenter. Center Bobby Carpenter. And Carpenter? He's 
excited to be here. 
</P>
<P>
"To be able to come home in my prime is very special," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But whose prime will it be? The pulsating prime you'd expect from The 
Can't-Miss Kid? Or the uninspired prime of a 25-year-old journeyman who once 
had a special gift, but lost it along the way?

Q &amp; A: ROBERT J. MYLOD; 
</P>
<P>
'BEVERLY HILLS SAVINGS IS BACK'; 
</P>
<P>
NEW OWNER IS BREATHING LIFE INTO THE ONCE-DEAD S&amp;L 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By James S. Granelli, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Beverly Hills Savings is back." That's the optimistic phrase emblazoned on 
posters hanging at the six branches of the once-insolvent savings and loan. 
</P>
<P>
The Mission Viejo-based S&amp;L had been operated by regulators since April, 
1985 -- longer than any other insolvent S&amp;L. With $1.6 billion in assets, 
Beverly Hills Savings was headed for liquidation. 
</P>
<P>
But the S&amp;L was brought back from the dead when it was sold at 8:30 p.m. on 
Dec. 31 with $983 million in federal assistance and $52 million in cash from 
its new owner, Michigan National Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan National, owner of Michigan National Bank, is no stranger to trouble. 
Its former chairman, Stanford Stoddard, was convicted of fraud, and one of its 
Detroit rivals, Comerica Inc., tried to take it over while it was bringing in a 
new chairman 4 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
But the new chairman, Robert J. Mylod, thwarted the takeover attempt and 
assembled a management team that put the money-losing company back in the 
black. The effort boosted the company's capital base -- its insurance against 
losses -- from $180 million to $700 million and led to net income of $93 
million last year and more than $9 billion in assets. 
</P>
<P>
With the nation's fastest-growing mortgage company, Independence One Mortgage 
Corp., and a national investment firm, Independence One Investment Services 
Corp., Michigan National hopes to revive the operations of Beverly Hills 
Savings and gain a foothold in the California market. Under current laws and 
regulations, a Midwestern or Eastern bank cannot buy a healthy bank or S&amp;L 
in California, but can buy an S&amp;L certified as insolvent by regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Mylod, 49, is a former president and chief operating officer of the Federal 
National Mortgage Assn., a reseller of mortgage loans, and is a former 
president of Advance Mortgage Co. The New York native also worked for Citicorp 
in New York, the nation's largest banking firm, for 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
While in Orange County last week, Mylod told Times staff writer James S. 
Granelli why his firm entered the Southern California market, why it targeted 
Beverly Hills Savings and what his plans are for the $1.6-billion institution. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What opportunities does the savings and loan field offer a bank holding 
company? 
</P>
<P>
A. I don't view it as the savings and loan field. I think that with Beverly 
Hills particularly, it is the chance to become involved in the financial 
services business of Southern California. And Michigan National Corp. will be 
bound by all of the rules that apply not only to savings and loans but also to 
bank holding companies. But within that context, Michigan National views this 
as an opportunity to provide a wide array of financial services to its 
customers, hopefully a growing customer base in the Southern California market. 
So there's not going to be any specific focusing, if you will, on whether it's 
a savings and loan or a bank. 
</P>
<P>
Q. So had there been a bank available, assuming California laws would have 
allowed it, you would have purchased the bank just as well as an S&amp;L. 
</P>
<P>
A. I think that's absolutely possible. It's all a function of what kind of 
transactions can be negotiated that are in the best interest of the 
stockholders of Michigan National. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Then the opportunity to get into the Southern California market was 
paramount. 
</P>
<P>
A. Exactly. That was really the attraction. The Southern California market, 
while competitive, is a large and very vibrant market, and we think it will 
continue to be that way as far into the future as we can peer. We're just 
delighted to be part of it. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Others have come into the Southern California market from out of state, 
looked at it much the way you have, but found it very, very difficult to 
compete. Why do you think will succeed where others have failed? 
</P>
<P>
A. The business of running a bank is a very difficult business and the only way 
to make it work is to have some very highly talented people. We have some 
highly talented people in this organization, and we're going to need more 
highly talented people in order to be successful in this market. I think you 
can look out on the playing field and see it littered with a lot of 
unsuccessful players or competitors. By the same token, I think I could go out 
and point out some people who have come into this market and been quite 
successful. The key difference is the people and the strategies that they have 
employed. We recognize it's a tough market, no question about it, but we're 
willing to step up and we think, without being overconfident, that we can be 
successful. 
</P>
<P>
Q. While the Federal Reserve will be holding you to certain kinds of 
restrictions under bank holding company laws, are you going to be able to use 
any of the broader savings and loan powers such as real estate joint ventures, 
the purchase of equity stocks or even insurance sales? 
</P>
<P>
A. That is so far into the future in terms of our planning that I don't think 
it would really be meaningful for me to answer the question. Our job right now 
is to understand the business as it exists today and to build ourselves a 
reasonable plan for growing the business. We're not going to be pursuing any of 
the, let's say, more liberal powers that savings and loans have for the time 
being. We're going to be focusing on more what I would call traditional types 
of financial services. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Why did Michigan National look for acquisitions out of state? Had it 
saturated the market in Michigan to the extent that it had to look elsewhere 
for customers for growth? 
</P>
<P>
A. We felt that by the year 1988, we had produced a much stronger balance 
sheet, significantly grown the capital of the business and significantly 
improved the quality of our loan portfolio. So it was time to begin to expand 
our business. You have to understand the context in which we say that. The 
banking business of this country, both the savings and loan and commercial 
banking, are under a process where there is going to be tremendous 
consolidation over the next 5 to 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Q. I take it that Michigan National plans to emerge intact from the 
consolidation process? 
</P>
<P>
A. Michigan National would not be a survivor 10 years down the road if it 
simply stayed the same size. It is going to have to attract, in one form or 
another, more capital to manage in order to be a real competitor down the road. 
So in 1988 we began to look for ways to expand the business. We view ourselves 
as an entrepreneurial management team, and we're looking for deals and 
expansion opportunities that make good sense for our stockholders. We already 
were a national company before we became involved with Beverly Hills. So 
there's a national orientation and, therefore, we said we want to do 
acquisitions where we can find them in the best markets at the best possible 
terms for our stockholders. Therefore we began to pursue the possibility of an 
assisted merger in a good market. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Why did you settle on Beverly Hills Savings? This is an S&amp;L which even 
the government-hired operators have said was ready for the junk heap. It was 
going to be liquidated. 
</P>
<P>
A. What we saw in Beverly Hills was a relatively small branch system with 
relatively high deposits per customer in a tremendous economic climate with 
relatively few management problems. When you cut through the whole thing, this 
company has been in the process of taking deposits for the last several years. 
It has no loan-producing capabilities at this point. It's managing a portfolio 
of relatively sick loans. But we saw a tremendous franchise name -- the name 
Beverly Hills runs all the way back to 1929 (when the S&amp;L was established) 
and has a very proud history, except for the most recent past. We think we can 
apply the same kind of formula to managing the business that we did at Michigan 
National. We think this is a tremendous opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Even with all the bad loans, especially in the commercial area, that you now 
must manage? 
</P>
<P>
A. We expect to get into commercial lending at some point in time. We think 
we're very well qualified to manage the existing portfolio of Beverly Hills. 
Michigan National has a portfolio of about $1 billion of commercial real 
estate-oriented mortgages. In 1988, we wrote off about $380,000 against that $1 
billion in assets. That's a little less than 4/100ths of 1%. That is an 
outstanding record that my colleagues in that part of the business have turned 
in. Commercial real estate lending has been kind of a sore subject around the 
country, and several banks have had some problems with it. We are always very 
nervous and concerned about the portfolio, and we look at it very closely. Once 
we begin to get control of the problems at Beverly Hills and turn it around and 
liquidate some of these assets, we expect to use that expertise to participate 
in a more responsible way in the commercial real estate lending activities in 
this market, which is a tremendous real estate market. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Were you the lone bidder on Beverly Hills Savings? 
</P>
<P>
A. There were other competitors. I know we were competing against other 
organizations to acquire this bank. But you'd have to ask the regulators who. 
</P>
<P>
Q. You have said previously that you want to make this institution grow. Would 
the strategy that Citicorp used at Citicorp Savings provide a road map for you? 
Citicorp acquired the failed Fidelity Federal in 1983 and went on a buying 
spree, picking up more than 50 branches from various S&amp;Ls in the state. 
</P>
<P>
A. We would not have done this deal if we didn't think this was a good, viable 
institution with a good opportunity to grow. That is clearly our focus and 
we're going to try to recruit with that in mind. We think we have a good chance 
of being successful. We're not going to try to do a Citicorp strategy. We are a 
much smaller organization than Citicorp. Citicorp earned $1.7 billion last 
year. Michigan National earned $93 million. We're not going to have this big, 
massive national strategy. We're just a little guy trying to provide 
outstanding service to the people that we serve. But we're here to make this 
thing work. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Nevertheless, Beverly Hills Savings could be used eventually to buy other 
S&amp;Ls, perhaps large, profitable ones. 
</P>
<P>
A. Absolutely. Once we've got a sense that we understand where we are and a 
sense of control -- and once we've actually been able to make it profitable -- 
clearly we're going to want to expand it. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Is it possible that in 1991, when banks from across the nation are allowed 
in California, this will become Beverly Hills Bank? 
</P>
<P>
A. That's a speculation, but yeah, that's possible. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What have you learned in 3 weeks or so of running Beverly Hills Savings? 
</P>
<P>
A. The first thing is that there have been very few surprises. The company is 
generally well managed, we think. It's got some excellent managers who we think 
are going to add to or create the future of this company. Over time, we expect 
to augment them, particularly with a chief operating officer, whom we hope to 
recruit in a reasonably short period of time and who probably is going to be a 
product of this market. This is a totally different environment from Michigan 
and we would like to get somebody who has very high values, a very high sense 
of integrity, understands the market and can help to create the vision of the 
future for Beverly Hills Savings in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How does the $983 million in Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. 
assistance break down? 
</P>
<P>
A. The easiest one to understand is the $800-million negative net worth note. 
FSLIC, in signing that note, commits itself to repay no later than 10 years 
from now the entire $800 million which is the hole, if you will, in the balance 
sheet. Then, the rest of it is going to be interest FSLIC pays on the note and 
FSLIC subsidies on the bad assets. The third major area is that they will make 
Michigan National whole, in effect, for any losses on the sale of all these 
covered assets. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Still, nearly $1 billion is a lot of money to revive a dying S&amp;L. 
</P>
<P>
A. If the regulators went to the other alternative, which is simply to 
liquidate this company, their cost would clearly have been substantially higher 
than that. And they would have taken a potentially viable economic instrument 
out of the community and 160 people who work at Beverly Hills Savings would 
have lost their jobs. As long as the operators that come in and run these 
businesses are responsible, they are doing incrementally something that is 
valuable to the taxpayers of this country. This industry problem exists and 
it's not going to go away. The question is, what do you do with it now that 
it's there? And what's the best way to deal with it? I can't say that what the 
FSLIC did is absolutely perfect, but I can say that I believe they had to do 
something. 
</P>
<P>
Q. You now have roughly $800 million worth of tax benefits -- part of about $5 
billion in tax breaks that all buyers of failed S&amp;Ls got last year -- that 
you hope to use to reduce the amount of taxes Michigan National pays. In 
addition, regulators gave buyers more than $37 billion in tax-free assistance 
last year. Is that too much to pay? 
</P>
<P>
A. What is the alternative to doing this transaction? The fact is that this 
(problem) has happened. It's here. You can't make it go away. And someone's got 
to manage their way out of it. The federal government, unfortunately, is the 
insurer of the deposits of all these savings and loans and banks around the 
country and has the responsibility of doing that. I don't know what the 
ultimate solution will be. But I think the proposal made by the Bush 
Administration (to charge depositors up to 30 cents for every $100 on deposit 
at banks and S&amp;Ls) is a very poor one because it's very shortsighted. All 
it does is create more pressure on the savings and loan industry, which it 
certainly doesn't need right now. But there is a problem there and it's got to 
be worked out. The part that we're playing, I think, is helping to reduce the 
amount of the problem. I really believe that. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Some S&amp;L industry leaders have criticized the FSLIC promissory notes as 
not being worth the paper they're written on. Are they? 
</P>
<P>
A. Absolutely. We did this deal with the federal government, and the General 
Accounting Office has stated that the full faith and credit of the United 
States government is behind the notes that are being issued. We just don't have 
any concern about that. There are some inquiries made by various members of 
Congress into these transactions, but we'd be happy to share information on the 
entire transaction with anybody. We think this is a good transaction for 
Michigan National Corp. We think it's a good transaction for Beverly Hills. And 
we think it's a good transaction for the taxpayers of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Can you break down the bad assets that are costing Beverly Hills money? 
</P>
<P>
A. We're going through that portfolio of loans. It's about $800 million. 
Somewhere by the middle of February, we will have categorized every single 
asset that we have on the books at Beverly Hills. These assets are spread out 
all over the country. Some are in Texas, some are in Colorado, some are in 
Wisconsin, some are in Illinois. A lot of them are in California. We will have 
a specific management strategy for each one of these properties by that time. 
Some of these are loans; some are properties we took back in foreclosures; some 
of them are direct investments. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Is it mostly residential? 
</P>
<P>
A. It's mostly commercial, but there are about $200 million or so of 
residential mortgages in the portfolio. Our mortgage company subsidiary, 
Independence One Mortgage Co., which has a servicing portfolio of about $8.5 
billion, is going to become involved in the active management of that 
single-family residential portfolio. The people there understand that business 
exclusively. And we have a very sophisticated commercial lending group working 
with the existing team to categorize these loans. 
</P>

'The Southern California market, while competitive, is a large and very vibrant

we can peer. We're just delighted to be part of it.'

'TALLEY'S FOLLY' DOESN'T CLICK AT SECOND STAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lanford Wilson told interviewer David Savran that his "Talley's Folly" "is more 
of a well-made play (than his 'Fifth of July'). It locks into place, you can 
actually hear it click." 
</P>
<P>
Not at South Coast Repertory's Second Stage. 
</P>
<P>
This conversation (set in 1944) between an immigrant Jew and a small-town 
Missouri heiress -- he woos her, she resists -- initially seems no more natural 
than the geegaws on the abandoned boathouse where it takes place. 
</P>
<P>
But as these once and future lovers keep talking, as they discover that they 
share mutual hopes for the future on one very important subject, we should hear 
that big click. It should sound like a force of nature. 
</P>
<P>
Here it just sounds forced. 
</P>
<P>
This is the first major production of the play in the Southland since Judd 
Hirsch and Trish Hawkins did it at the Mark Taper Forum in 1979, and it raises 
the question of why we were so smitten with it back then. It must have had 
something to do with the chemistry between the two actors. 
</P>
<P>
At South Coast, director Lee Shallat has two fine actors, Hal Landon Jr. and 
Anni Long, and John Iacovelli's intricate boathouse set, complete with cobwebs. 
A breeze occasionally wafts across the stage and so do the sounds of a rural 
night, designed by Chuck Estes. 
</P>
<P>
But the chemistry isn't there, and the play itself seems weaker as a result. 
</P>
<P>
The course of the play depends on our understanding why Matt Friedman continues 
to pursue Sally Talley despite the opposition of everyone -- including, 
throughout most of the hour and a half of talk, Sally herself. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson did make clear, perhaps too much so, the reasons why Sally found Matt 
intriguing -- he's exotic; he's a symbol of her defiance against her family; 
he's charming and incredibly persistent. 
</P>
<P>
But what's in it for Matt? It's Matt who has gone out of his way and out on a 
limb, and Wilson didn't explore his motivations deeply enough. We do learn that 
Matt has been severely wounded; presumably he seeks comfort against the storm. 
But Sally seems to offer more storm instead of more comfort; she is one remote 
and defiant shiksa. 
</P>
<P>
Is she part of an assimilationist attempt on Matt's part? Does she make him 
feel more like an American? Wilson should have raised these questions, even if 
he ended up answering them negatively. 
</P>
<P>
As it is, the play is too unbalanced between Matt the pursuer and Sally the 
pursued. We don't see Matt question his own goal for one moment. Nor do we see 
Sally give Matt much of an incentive to keep going (other than what Matt points 
out as her nice new dress, designed by Shigeru Yagi). Given the romantic 
setting and Matt's unfaltering stance, we never doubt how it will end. 
</P>
<P>
Too bad we never fully understand why it got started. Without turning into a 
stereotype, Landon has adopted an immigrant's inflections and body language. 
But there are moments when the accent deserts him. Matt imitates the local 
lingo occasionally -- and Landon does it so well that it almost sounds more 
natural to him than Matt's own Eastern European rhythms. 
</P>
<P>
At least on Saturday night, there were a few moments when Matt's gift of gab 
seemed to stall momentarily, when the pauses extended longer than expected. 
Perhaps this was Shallat's and Landon's choice; perhaps they were trying to 
indicate a little of the awkwardness under Matt's spiel. But the pauses weren't 
quite long enough for that. The play already seems too long in this 
incarnation, and prolonging it doesn't help. 
</P>
<P>
Long demonstrates Sally's show-me side (this is Missouri, after all), but it 
comes off as fear more than curiosity. And it's Sally's curiosity that (in the 
absence of deeper writing by Wilson) must be one of the primary qualities about 
her that tantalizes Matt. Long's Sally seems too trapped, restrained from 
leaving by Matt's physical presence more than by his irresistible appeal to 
her. 
</P>
<P>
Cameron Harvey's lighting design also seems unduly restrained. The transition 
from sunset to moonlight is hardly apparent. There isn't much of a glow 
surrounding this supposedly happy ending.

The federal judge in the Iran-Contra case threw out Oliver L. North's subpoena 
of President Bush but ruled today that former President Ronald Reagan can be 
compelled to testify in the case against his former aide. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell, clearing one of the last obstacles to 
the scheduled start of North's trial Tuesday, ruled that the former White House 
aide had made no showing that Bush "has any specific information relevant and 
material" to the charges against North. 
</P>
<P>
Gesell said Reagan "shall remain subject to call" to testify in the case but 
said in his three-page order that there would be further proceedings if it is 
found necessary to summon the former President as a witness. 
</P>
<P>
Gesell also quashed, with "one narrow exception," North's subpoena for Reagan's 
personal diary. 
</P>
<P>
The judge said portions of the diary might become part of the trial "if at some 
point" North's defense team "supports a claim that President Reagan ordered, 
directed, requested or, with advance knowledge, condoned any of North's" 
alleged criminal activities in the diversion of Iranian arm-sales profits to 
the Contra rebels in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Production Procedure' 
</P>
<P>
In that event, Gesell said, "an appropriate production procedure" must be 
developed for reviewing the former President's diary and determining whether 
any of the entries support North's assertions. 
</P>
<P>
North contended in testimony at the congressional Iran-Contra hearings in 1987 
that all of his activities were authorized by superiors in the Reagan 
Administration and that he reported to former national security advisers Robert 
C. McFarlane and John M. Poindexter. 
</P>
<P>
Government lawyers had challenged the subpoena for testimony by Reagan and Bush 
as unprecedented. 
</P>
<P>
They argued on constitutional grounds that Reagan and Bush enjoyed executive 
privilege and could not be forced to testify on sensitive national security 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
Gesell's order implemented a tactic he had indicated at a hearing Friday that 
he would use with regard to Reagan's testimony. Gesell said then that 
circumstances may change as evidence is introduced at the trial and that 
testimony of certain individuals may become relevant. 
</P>
<P>
The 12 counts against North include obstruction of Congress, destruction of 
documents and acceptance of illegal gifts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2 Counts Thrown Out 
</P>
<P>
The two key counts returned against North March 16 -- conspiracy to defraud the 
government and theft of government property -- were thrown out earlier this 
month. An interagency committee of intelligence experts feared that trial on 
those two charges could expose so much classified information that the national 
security would be jeopardized. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted on all counts, North faces a maximum 60 years in prison and $3 
million in fines. 
</P>
<P>
Independent prosecutor Lawrence E. Walsh has turned over trial duties to his 
chief deputy, John Keker. 
</P>
<P>
Jury selection is expected to take about two weeks, and lawyers for both sides 
have predicted that the trial will take about five months.

3 EX-PRESIDENTS JOIN CALL FOR NATIONAL HEALTH CARE

<P>
A commission including three former Presidents today proposed a national health 
care system that would ensure access to basic medical services for all 
Americans with financing by all but the poorest. 
</P>
<P>
The system is designed to extend health care to the estimated 37 million 
Americans who are uninsured, to curtail soaring health costs and to improve the 
quality of medical care nationwide, said the National Leadership Commission on 
Health Care. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed "strategy of providing access by asking every American to take 
responsibility for his or her own care and to assume a very small share of the 
cost of those who cannot assume that responsibility is eminently fair," the 
commission said in its report. 
</P>
<P>
Without change in the nation's health care system, costs are expected to grow 
from the current $550 billion a year to $1.5 trillion by the year 2000, said 
Paul G. Rogers, a former Democratic congressman from Florida who co-chaired the 
commission with former Iowa Gov. Robert D. Ray, a Republican. 
</P>
<P>
The commission, supported by 38 corporations, unions and foundations, spent 2 
1/2 years preparing the report. Three former Presidents -- Richard M. Nixon, 
Gerald R. Ford and Jimmy Carter -- served as honorary co-chairmen. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Role for Private Insurance 
</P>
<P>
The proposed system would continue a major role for private insurance coverage 
and would encourage employers to extend such coverage to more employees. 
</P>
<P>
All Americans would be covered by a basic package of medical services, which 
would be the minimum coverage for all private health insurance plans and for a 
publicly funded benefits pool. 
</P>
<P>
Many workers would continue to get privately financed coverage as an employment 
benefit, with the employer paying most or all of the premium, and they could 
add to that coverage if they wanted. Also the federal Medicare insurance 
program for older and disabled Americans would continue. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone else would be covered by the pool called the Universal Access program. 
Medicaid, the federal health insurance program for the poor, would be abolished 
and its recipients would be covered by the new program. 
</P>
<P>
The Universal Access program would be financed by all employers and by all 
individuals not covered by Medicare who have incomes above 150% of the poverty 
level.

17-YEAR TERM FOR DIVER KIMBALL;

<P>
'MUST BE PUNISHED' FOR DRUNK DRIVING, DEATHS, JUDGE SAYS

Olympic diver Bruce Kimball was sentenced to 17 years in prison today for 
killing two people and injuring four others when his car plowed into a group of 
teen-agers last August. 
</P>
<P>
The 1984 Olympic silver medalist, who was legally drunk at the time, must serve 
an additional 15 years probation, ruled Hillsborough Circuit Judge Harry Lee 
Coe. 
</P>
<P>
"You must be punished," Coe told Kimball after the 3 1/2-hour sentencing 
hearing. "You must suffer the consequences of drunken driving, and we must stop 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Kimball had pleaded guilty to two drunken driving manslaughter and three great 
bodily injury counts earlier this month, and has been in jail since. 
</P>
<P>
Today he changed the plea to no contest, a technical move aimed at making it 
easier for victims to recover damages from his automobile insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old Kimball, dressed in a blue jail uniform, stood impassively 
before the judge during the hearing, and did not visibly react when the 
sentence was read. 
</P>
<P>
Coe, who also revoked Kimball's license, noted that most prisoners serve only 
20% to 30% of their sentences in any case, which could free Kimball in as 
little as three years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Will Teach Alcohol Peril 
</P>
<P>
Coe said that 15-year probation will include community work aimed at teaching 
young people the dangers of alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said Kimball -- with a blood alcohol count of 0.2, or twice the 
legal limit in Florida -- was doing 75 m.p.h. on a darkened road near Brandon 
just outside of Tampa on Aug. 1 when his car plowed into a group of teen-agers 
gathered at a site commonly known as "the spot." 
</P>
<P>
At the hearing, Assistant State Atty. John Skye said Kimball "was not just a 
little careless, he was not just a little negligent." 
</P>
<P>
The bloody accident came as Kimball was in training to qualify for the 1988 
U.S. Olympic team. He was released on bond and families of the victims went to 
the Olympic trials in Indianapolis to protest his quest for a place on the 
team. Kimball ultimately failed to qualify. 
</P>
<P>
Kimball's parents had tearfully asked for mercy for their son.

SWAGGART THREATENS SEX STORY SUIT

A lawyer for television evangelist Jimmy Swaggart today threatened a "mammoth" 
libel suit against Penthouse Magazine for publishing the account of a New 
Orleans housewife who claims Swaggart conned her into performing sex acts. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Brewer Sr., an Irving attorney who is also a member of the Swaggart 
Ministry board of directors, said that Swaggart had never met the woman and 
that she had falsified the account for fame and money. 
</P>
<P>
Catherine Kampen, 38, claimed that the affair with Swaggart began in July, 
1987, and lasted until January, 1988, before Swaggart was defrocked last spring 
by the Assemblies of God for a tryst with a prostitute. Kampen, who was 
employed by a "strip-o-gram" service, alleges in the article that she met 
Swaggart on the street and that he pretended to counsel her on her marital 
problems. She said they never had sexual intercourse but claims that he conned 
her into performing sadomasochistic acts for his sexual pleasure.

Defense Secretary George Younger said today that Britain plans to withdraw all

His statement followed British media reports over the weekend that London plans 
to pull out 1,000 of its 1,800 troops and close several military facilities in 
the territory, which Spain claims. In a written message to Parliament, Younger 
said a "continuing drive for cost-effectiveness" is the reason for the troop 
reduction.

A Rembrandt and another 17th-Century Dutch painting were stolen from a 
government art warehouse, and police today arrested a warehouse employee and 
her boyfriend as suspects, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The two paintings, "Man With Beard," a 1647 work by Rembrandt, and "Winter 
Landscape With Skaters," a 1649 painting by Jan van Goyen, were reported 
missing from the warehouse here on Jan. 20, according to police spokesman Nico 
Laterveer. The disappearance was made public only today "so as not to 
jeopardize the investigation," Laterveer said. 
</P>
<P>
The two suspects, identified only as a 22-year-old administrative employee of 
the warehouse and her boyfriend, remained in custody. A search of their 
apartment failed to yield the paintings, whose combined value was estimated at 
between $474,000 and $711,000.

'SENIOR JUDGE' BURGER IN LINE FOR $60,000 RAISE

Former Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, who stepped down from the high court in 
1986 and hasn't heard a case since because he's been "too busy," stands to 
receive a $60,000-a-year pay raise because he claimed status as a "senior 
judge" rather than full retirement. 
</P>
<P>
Burger left the Supreme Court bench in September, 1986, to serve as unpaid 
chairman of the commission celebrating the bicentennials of the Constitution 
and Bill of Rights. When he retired in 1986, his salary was $108,400, and had 
he resigned, his annual salary would have been frozen for life at that figure. 
But Burger, who has spent much of his career campaigning for higher salaries 
for judges, opted to accept the title of "senior judge." As a result, he 
qualifies for whatever raises are extended to his successors as chief justice. 
</P>
<P>
Under the congressional pay raise bill pending in Congress, a fifth of all 
senior federal judges, including Burger, stand to collect their largest pay 
raises in a decade even though they no longer handle any court cases. 
</P>
<P>
Burger declined to answer questions about his impending raise and his judicial 
workload other than to pass along that, "I'm too busy to sit."

Only 14% of Orange County families could afford the typical house in December, 
down from 16%, according to the California Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
The association said a family needed an income of $75,318 to afford a 
single-family resale house at the median price of $237,114. The monthly survey 
excludes new homes, which are even more expensive, on the average. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy demand pushed housing prices through the roof last year in Southern 
California, until even affluent Orange County now has a severe shortage of 
affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the trade association estimated that slightly more California 
families statewide could afford a house in December. That improvement -- 23% of 
families compared to 21% in November -- was the first in nearly two years.

A Santa Ana man died Sunday night after he accidentally shot himself in the 
head, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Family members of Jose Rojas, 19, called police about 9:45 p.m. yesterday, 
officials said, to report that he was brandishing a .357-caliber handgun 
outside his home in the 1100 block of West Walnut Street. When police arrived, 
they found Rojas lying on the ground with a fatal gunshot wound to the head, 
police spokeswoman Maureen Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
Family members and neighbors told police that Rojas had been drinking and 
firing the gun all day. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said there was no evidence Rojas intended to commit suicide, so police 
are calling the shooting accidental.

South Korea's top trade official unveiled a comprehensive import-liberalization 
program today designed to tackle its surging current account surplus. 
</P>
<P>
Trade Minister Han Seoung Soo spoke against a backdrop of increasing pressures 
on Seoul to open its markets and reduce a surplus which last year totaled 
nearly $14 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Han told reporters that import restraints on about 540 farm and fishery 
products would soon be unshackled, on a step-by-step basis. 
</P>
<P>
Curbs on imports of 46 still-prohibited manufactured items would be scrapped 
over two or three years, Han said. 
</P>
<P>
"Friction with our trading partners is worsening day by day because of the 
growing current account surplus. At home, the surplus is threatening to cause 
inflation spirals," he said. "The appropriate solution is to buy more foreign 
goods by opening our import markets." 
</P>
<P>
Detailed guidelines are expected to be revealed at the end of February.

Fairchild Industries Inc. today announced it has taken additional steps to 
protect itself from a takeover, including paying $75 million to repurchase 
stock and other securities from the Soros group, its largest share owner. 
</P>
<P>
George Soros and Harvey Karp agreed to resign from Fairchild's board of 
directors, and each member of the group agreed not to buy Fairchild stock for 
10 years as part of the deal, the Chantilly, Va.-based aerospace company 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Fairchild said it was selling 1.6 million shares of stock to its 
own employee stock ownership plan, using the shares that it is buying from the 
Soros group. 
</P>
<P>
The sale will mean that employee plans will have 23% of the company's common 
stock and 19% of the outstanding voting power.

Omani Oil Minister Said Shanfari said today that his country is ready to reduce 
its oil exports to help stabilize world oil prices after a meeting between the 
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and independent oil producers 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
The minister's pledge was made in a statement to his country's Arabic-language 
daily Oman and was broadcast by Muscat Radio, monitored in Bahrain. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Syria said that it plans to boost its oil exports from 80,000 
barrels a day in 1988 to 130,000 to 140,000 barrels a day this year. 
</P>
<P>
Oman's announcement followed a meeting last week in London between oil experts 
from six OPEC countries and 13 non-OPEC countries. 
</P>
<P>
A statement issued after last Thursday's meeting called for non-OPEC nations to 
cooperate with OPEC in stabilizing world oil prices.

MOCHRIE TURNS HER WATERLOO (NO. 18) INTO SWEET VICTORY

Dottie Mochrie couldn't think of a better way to win her first LPGA title: Beat 
the hole that nearly beat her. 
</P>
<P>
Mochrie made a 2-foot putt for par on the fifth playoff hole, at No. 18, for 
her victory in the $300,000 Oldsmobile Classic today over Beth Daniel. The 
playoff began after Mochrie faltered on the 18th and final hole of regulation 
play. 
</P>
<P>
The former Furman University star bogeyed No. 18 Sunday for the second straight 
day, and the nightmarish finish lingered in her mind well after darkness forced 
suspension of play after the fourth extra hole. 
</P>
<P>
After all, the playoff would resume on No. 18. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a wreck," said Mochrie, who slept for two hours Sunday night and then 
tossed and turned for hours with "visions of the 18th hole, where I wanted to 
hit it, where the pin was." 
</P>
<P>
"In the middle of the night, I wasn't feeling too good about it," she said. 
"But by the time I was ready to get up, I felt like this is your tournament to 
do with it as you wish." 
</P>
<P>
Mochrie and Daniel, chasing her 15th LPGA victory but first in an official tour 
event since 1985, returned to Stonebridge Golf and Country Club early today to 
warm up for the conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
The playoff Sunday night was even after the completion of holes 18, 10, 11 and 
12. 
</P>
<P>
This morning, Daniel was confident, but she saw her hopes fade when she drove 
into the right rough on the 18th, 161 yards from the hole, and her second shot 
landed in a bunker in front of the green. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Really Owes You' 
</P>
<P>
Mochrie, meanwhile, positioned her second shot on the green, 18 feet above the 
cup. Her putt for birdie drifted right, but she was left with a tap-in par. 
</P>
<P>
"My husband was sitting there this morning, and said, 'You know, this hole 
really owes you.' I birdied it Friday, but it really got me good over the 
weekend." 
</P>
<P>
Mochrie, who made $137,293 as a rookie last year, earned $45,000 for her first 
career victory. She shot a 69 in the final round for a 72-hole total of 
9-under-par 279. 
</P>
<P>
"This takes the pressure off that I put on myself to win this year. I knew I 
could play well, and now everybody else knows," Mochrie said. "It won't be a 
matter of people saying it'll happen if you wait long enough. I waited 
overnight, and that was long enough."

Ole Christian Furuseth of Norway broke from a tightly bunched pack after the 
first run to win the slalom portion of the men's combined competition by 
one-hundredth of a second today at the World Alpine Ski Championships. 
</P>
<P>
The combined slalom results will be paired with a downhill on Friday to 
determine the combined medalists. 
</P>
<P>
Luxembourg's Marc Girardelli, who placed third in the combined slalom, loomed 
as the clear-cut favorite for the gold medal because of his downhill prowess. 
</P>
<P>
Furuseth, 22, whose best World Cup result was a second in a giant slalom this 
season, came from sixth place after the first run to edge Sweden's Jonas 
Nilsson. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fierce Competition 
</P>
<P>
The top seven racers in the first run were separated by a mere 
nineteen-hundredths of a second, setting up fierce competition in the second 
heat. Veteran Paul Frommelt of Liechtenstein led the way in the first run at 
49.96 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Furuseth was clocked in 46.77 seconds for the quickest second run over a 
slightly shorter, 57-gate course. Nilsson, in fifth place, had a 46.82 in the 
second run. 
</P>
<P>
That left Furuseth with an aggregate time of 1 minute, 36.89 seconds, while 
Nilsson finished at 1:36.90. 
</P>
<P>
Girardelli finished third in 1:37.65, followed by Tetsuya Okabe of Japan in 
1:37.66 and Frommelt in 1:37.83. Switzerland's Paul Accola was sixth in 
1:37.85. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Californian Places 12th 
</P>
<P>
Austria's Guenther Mader, another expected contender in the combined, was ninth 
in 1:38.14, and Switzerland's Pirmin Zurbriggen stood 11th in 1:38.47. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Ormsby of Tahoe City, Calif., was 12th in 1:38.63. 
</P>
<P>
Felix McGrath of Shelburne, Vt., who was 12th in the first heat, missed a gate 
halfway down the course. Tiger Shaw of Stowe, Vt., straddled a gate and did not 
finish the first run. 
</P>
<P>
Among other first-run casualties were Austria's Hubert Strolz, the combined 
gold medalist at the Calgary Olympics, and West Germany's Armin Bittner, who 
shares this season's World Cup slalom lead with Girardelli. Strolz straddled a 
gate just 19 seconds into his run, and Bittner missed a gate barely 10 seconds 
into his run. 
</P>
<P>
Austria's Bernhard Gstrein, who was seventh and just .19 seconds behind 
Frommelt entering the second run, straddled a gate about 10 seconds from the 
finish.
