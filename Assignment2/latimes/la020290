SHERIFF'S MOUNTED POSSE FACTORS IN FUN WHILE PATROLLING SANTA CLARITA VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
There's a lot of horsing around when Bob Warford, Chuck Powell and Bob Harris 
get together for monthly gatherings with friends in the Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
It's not that the meetings don't involve serious work. But fun is a big factor 
when the group rides horseback, patrolling streets in east Newhall, keeping 
motorcyclists off private ranches or ensuring that big community events don't 
get out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
They are among the 38 members of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department's 
Mounted Posse in the Santa Clarita Valley -- one of 14 sheriff's posses in the 
county. Riding their own horses, members of the posse combine a love for horses 
with law enforcement. And they do it for free, said Warford, the group's 
coordinator for the last 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just a bunch of cowboys at heart," said Powell, who is a Los Angeles 
County firefighter at the Sand Canyon station. "It's nice to get away from the 
rat race, to go out on the horse and take it easy." 
</P>
<P>
They go on training rides at least once a month and are called out for special 
assignments an average of five or six times a year, Warford said. More than 
anything else, the posse provides a highly visible law-enforcement presence 
when large groups of people gather at parks and on streets for special events, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Half of the posse's riders are Los Angeles police officers who own horses and 
live in the area, Warford said. For them, volunteering for the posse is a 
refreshing break from filling out crime reports, checking for gang activity or 
making drug busts. It's also an alternative to joining the Los Angeles Police 
Department's own Mounted Unit, which recently stopped accepting part-time and 
volunteer riders to become a full-time, professional detail. 
</P>
<P>
Though they sometimes get grim assignments, such as looking for the remains of 
lost hikers or searching for missing children, members say that most of the 
time they are living it up while putting down crime from the saddle. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoy doing this. My other job is work," said Harris, a detective in the 
Police Department's robbery and homicide division at Parker Center in downtown 
Los Angeles. "It pretty much started out as a hobby with everybody. We just all 
enjoy it." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Officer Jean Posner, a horse lover since she was 3, said she 
thought about joining her department's Mounted Unit but was concerned that she 
might not qualify because of on-the-job injuries she suffered several years 
ago. So she joined the sheriff's posse, which she said is not only easier on 
her but also is better for her horse. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes in riots in L.A., my friends have had horses slashed by razor blades 
or hit in the head with bottles," said Posner, who patrols low-income housing 
projects in the Police Department's northeast valley Foothill Division. In the 
Santa Clarita Valley, she said, "the heavy-duty stuff is only in Newhall, off 
Market Street and San Fernando Road, with people drinking in public." 
</P>
<P>
Of those posse members who aren't Los Angeles police officers, most are Level 2 
sheriff's reservists, meaning they have had 13 weeks of Police Academy training 
and are permitted to carry a service revolver on patrol, as long as they are 
under the direct supervision of a full-time deputy, Warford said. All posse 
members must complete a 40-hour horseback training course before joining the 
unit. 
</P>
<P>
Among the posse's assignments last year was the search in March for 7-year-old 
Sara Nan Hodges, a Newhall girl whose body was later found in the bedroom of a 
14-year-old neighbor, who has pleaded guilty to her murder. They also helped 
authorities try to determine the location from which three horses escaped and 
ran onto the Golden State Freeway in April, killing a 19-year-old motorist and 
injuring another man when they collided with cars. 
</P>
<P>
Reservist Rita Vanatter, a school nurse for the Westside Union School District 
in the Antelope Valley, said the most gratifying part of being on the posse is 
the attention the horses get from children. 
</P>
<P>
"They just want to touch your horse," she said. "It's like the highlight of 
their lives." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, many posse members say, enforcing the law from the back of a horse is 
kinder and gentler than doing it from a black-and-white patrol car or a 
motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
When two park rangers were surrounded by a group of angry, intoxicated men last 
year at the Castaic Lake State Recreation Area, the presence of mounted 
deputies had an instant calming effect when the men saw their children's 
fascination with the horses, a posse member said. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids see the horses, and the parents see the kids are happy," he said. "It 
calms everybody down." 
</P>
<P>
As far as major crime goes, posse members don't see much of that, and neither 
do they really want to, Warford said. 
</P>
<P>
"We really haven't had exciting shoot-'em-up type things," he said. "It seems 
routine, but it's a chance to get out into the open and ride our horses."

IT'S SNOW FUN AS VALDEZ RESIDENT PAYS $5,000 TO HAVE ROOF CLEARED

<TEXT>
<P>
For the man with the biggest roof in Valdez, this year's snow season has come 
with a steep price: He has paid $5,000 to have it cleared. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Holtz, owner of the FoodMart supermarket, said Wednesday it took two men 
with snow blowers a couple of weeks to finally get all of the snow off. 
</P>
<P>
"My roof is 21,000 square feet," Holtz said. "We had 400 tons of snow up there. 
It's built to hold 140 pounds per square foot, and we had 100 pounds per square 
foot. 
</P>
<P>
"It took over $5,000 to get the 9 feet of snow on the roof blown off," he said. 
"I guess that's just one of the costs of doing business." 
</P>
<P>
Holtz said Valdez was returning to normal after getting 4 feet of snow on Jan. 
16, when a single-day record of 47 1/2 inches was set. More than 13 feet of 
snow fell in January, leaving only rooftops visible on one-story dwellings. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Bailey of the National Weather Service said Valdez is 8 inches from 
passing the season record for snowfall accumulation of 384.7 inches, set in 
1986-87. 
</P>
<P>
Harry Rogers, superintendent of schools, said children no longer play "king of 
the hill" but "man on the mountain" at the elementary school.

DRIVE GAINS FOR INITIATIVE TO RESTRICT GILL NET FISHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN R. CHURM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Proponents of an initiative to extend a ban on gill net fishing to Southern 
California coastal waters announced Thursday that they have gathered more than 
150,000 signatures to put the measure on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblywoman Doris Allen (R-Cypress) said 950,000 signatures are needed by 
early May to qualify the initiative. The proposal is opposed, in large measure, 
by the commercial fishing and seafood processing industry, which uses the nets 
to catch halibut, white sea bass and shark in large quantities. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed ban would prohibit gill net fishing within three miles of the 
coast from Point Conception to the Mexican Border, and within one mile of any 
of the Channel Islands off Santa Barbara. The initiative also would make 
permanent a similar ban on the fine-mesh nets along the central and northern 
California coast. 
</P>
<P>
Allen launched the initiative drive in mid-December after several legislative 
attempts to restrict the use of gill nets failed. Limits on the use of the nets 
have long been sought by sport fishermen and environmentalists, who claim that 
fish populations are being depleted and that dolphins, porpoises and other 
marine mammals are being destroyed when they are inadvertently caught in the 
nets. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, state officials blamed gill nets for the deaths of more than 70 sea 
lions that washed ashore in Orange County during a three-week span. 
</P>
<P>
"The time is now to once and for all to rid California's waters of the 
destructive practice of gill net fishing," Allen told members of a Long Beach 
tuna fishing club that donated $20,000 to the signature-gathering effort. "It 
is cruel the way these mammals become entangled in this net and die." 
</P>
<P>
According to the most current figures available from the state Department of 
Fish and Game, 6,500 sea lions, harbor seals and harbor porpoises were killed 
in gill nets and similar devices in 1986-1987. 
</P>
<P>
But industry spokesmen said Allen and others have exaggerated the numbers of 
mammals killed by the nets to rally support for a ban that would destroy the 
gill net fishing industry. About 200 gill net fishermen operate in Southern 
California, mostly out of San Pedro and Ventura harbors, and some say they 
would be out of business if the gill net ban is passed. 
</P>
<P>
Seafood wholesalers also predicted that limiting gill net fishing would drive 
up the price of fresh fish in local markets. 
</P>
<P>
"If that ban goes through, prices will go sky high," said Rob Ross, executive 
director of the California Fisheries and Seafood Institute, a lobbying group 
for fish processors. "It is a destructive kind of law that will only put people 
out of work."

SECORD GETS PROBATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
That my fellow Air Commando Assn. member Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord opted to 
cop a plea rather than stand and fight as did Lt. Col. Oliver L. North is 
regrettable ("Secord Gets Probation, Calls Reagan Cowardly," Part A, Jan. 25). 
The Iran-Contra affair ("scandal" as The Times persists on calling it), was no 
more than a witch hunt conducted by congressional Democrats ably abetted by the 
news media with the intent to smear and, if possible, impeach President Ronald 
Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
To this extent, the congressional Democrats and the media failed because Reagan 
never admitted to any knowledge of providing weapons to Iran to achieve the 
release of our hostages, nor any knowledge of the use of the money gained from 
the sale of arms to Iran to be passed on to the Nicaraguan Freedom Fighters. 
Unless former President Reagan's classified papers and/or tapes are made 
available to the defense counsels, or if the former President himself is not 
called to the witness stand to testify under oath, it will never be known just 
how much Reagan knew and when he knew it and if he did not sanction this 
operation. That is why I deeply regret that Secord did not stand and fight 
instead of copping a plea and prostrating himself before the court in 
contrition. This is not how a man fights injustice. 
</P>
<P>
Men and women who engage in covert operations on behalf of their government, 
especially when they believe that such operations have been ordered by the 
commander in chief, are obligated to keep the secrets even if this means lying 
to persons who do not possess the need to know. This is particularly true when 
they are hauled before a congressional panel determined to subvert the 
President's constitutional prerogative of conducting the foreign policy of the 
U.S. 
</P>
<P>
With this in mind, Secord should have challenged the allegations made against 
him just as did North and, I would hope, Admiral John Poindexter. 
</P>
<P>
Because constitutional questions are involved, I believe that it is necessary 
that the findings of the lower courts be challenged to the Supreme Court and 
that President Reagan (and his wife) be ordered to testify and to produce any 
and all documents and tapes that bear upon this case.

SECORD GETS PROBATION

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Who says our justice system doesn't work? Richard V. Winrow, convicted of 
possession of 5.5 ounces of cocaine with intent to distribute, was sentenced to 
life in prison without parole ("5 1/2 Ounces of Crack Brings Life Term With No 
Parole," Part A, Dec. 7). Secord, on the other hand, operator of a tremendous 
extra-governmental scam to make millions off U.S. taxpayers and supply arms 
illegally to a murderous U.S. mercenary army, has been sentenced to two years 
probation and fined $50. 
</P>
<P>
To add further insult to this outrageous outcome, Secord is now whining that 
the independent-prosecutor law cramps his style excessively, and is launching a 
campaign to have it repealed! 
</P>
<P>
The lessons of recent history are clear: If you want to be a successful 
criminal, just be sure to commit large-scale crimes, be a white male and wear a 
suit. It also won't hurt to cultivate some contacts in the White House.

Isn't it ironic that Secord is now calling Reagan "cowardly"? Here is a man who 
lied to his country. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't have the guts to stand up for the truth! Secord, a convicted felon, 
should be lucky that he received a probationary sentence. The fact that he now 
says Reagan is cowardly carries no weight. A real coward is someone who is 
afraid to stand up for the truth when the moment is at hand.

WHY MEXICO IS SO ANGRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's not surprising that the Drug Enforcement Administration would pull out all 
the stops to get the thugs who killed DEA agent Enrique Camarena near 
Guadalajara in 1985. But the latest indictments in that painful case are sure 
to put new stress on U.S.-Mexican relations. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department revealed this week that a grand jury in Los Angeles has 
indicted, along with 17 other persons, the former head of Mexico's equivalent 
to the FBI, Manuel Ibarra Herrera, and the former director of Interpol in 
Mexico, Miguel Aldana Ibarra, as accessories to the Camarena killing. This 
despite the fact that 12 key figures in the case have already been prosecuted 
and jailed in Mexico. The two former lawmen are the highest-ranking Mexicans to 
be charged with involvement in the murder -- and that ups the ante in the long 
and often testy standoff between Washington and Mexico City over the Camarena 
case. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. investigators have never made a secret of the fact that they believe the 
drug kingpins who murdered Camarena were linked to Mexican police officials. 
The controversy over a recent television movie that purported -- in a fiction 
format -- to document the Camarena killing was only the latest instance of the 
case's causing a flap between the two governments. But by actually indicting 
former top Mexican cops, the U.S. government is putting its suspicions on the 
record. And handing over suspects as politically well-connected as Ibarra and 
Aldana may be asking too much of Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who is about as 
friendly a president as Washington has dealt with in Mexico for a long time. 
Surrendering car thieves is one thing; giving up appointees of a former Mexican 
president is quite another. 
</P>
<P>
So maybe the best that can be hoped for now is that this festering sore in 
U.S.-Mexico relations does not infect trade relations, environmental issues and 
other important areas for the two countries. Ever since Salinas, a Harvard 
graduate, and George Bush, a Texan with close ties to Mexico, became presidents 
of their respective countries, people like U.S. Ambassador to Mexico John 
Negroponte have been talking about a "new maturity" in relations between the 
two nations. The latest development in the Camarena case will test just how 
mature that relationship really is.

MCMARTIN: SYSTEM ON TRIAL AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's true that hard cases can make bad law, but they frequently provide 
instructive examples. The never-ending McMartin Pre-School case, for instance, 
has become, among other things, virtually an ongoing experiment in the criminal 
court's ability to administer justice in the glare of massive -- frequently 
prejudicial -- publicity. 
</P>
<P>
There are two kinds of pretrial publicity: One is the sort of fair-minded 
reporting that respects both the public's need for information on the conduct 
of their police and courts and a defendant's right to a fair trial. Such 
reporting is unlikely to compromise the administration of justice. There is by 
contrast a strong suspicion that sensational, biased journalism can have a 
distorting impact on a criminal trial and, particularly, on its jury. 
</P>
<P>
Too bad that much of the pretrial publicity in the McMartin case was of the 
latter sort. The fact that the criminal justice system was able to cope with it 
was attributable to the competence of the defense and prosecution and the 
hard-working judge who was willing to go to great -- and expensive -- length to 
impanel an unbiased jury. 
</P>
<P>
Obtaining such a jury required financing usable research into the publicity's 
impact on prospective jurors. It required the judge to allow an unusually 
lengthy and wide-ranging voir dire to ferret out biases unrecognized by the 
potential jurors themselves. Finally, it demanded a pool of prospective jurors 
large enough to contain those rare individuals able to set aside what they have 
read, seen and heard and to decide a case solely on the basis of the testimony 
given in court. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that such individuals are there to be discovered should be a source of 
enduring pride to the American people and a lasting vindication of the Founding 
Fathers' faith in the jury system. But, as the McMartin experiment already has 
demonstrated, finding those people adds substantially to the length and cost of 
a criminal trial. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the decision to refile the 13 unresolved charges against Raymond 
Buckey has pushed the McMartin experiment into uncharted territory. What impact 
will all the post-trial publicity have on prospective jurors, particularly 
since much of it, especially in the electronic media, has suggested that 
acquittal was tantamount to injustice? Let's hope that the forbearance, will 
and wisdom of the criminal justice system will overcome the hurdles once again.

SHERIFF BLOCK SHOWS A WISE HEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sheriff Sherman Block has issued some sound and sensitive guidelines for his 
deputies in the aftermath of a fatal confrontation with black members of the 
Nation of Islam that began with a minor traffic stop. 
</P>
<P>
Block has advised against taking "enforcement actions in minor incidents" in 
black neighborhoods because of the "heightened tensions" that have resulted 
from the incident in which a deputy shot and killed a Muslim on Jan. 23. If 
taken to heart by his street cops, the sheriff's advice can defuse escalating 
tensions, and maybe save lives. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting followed a non-fatal confrontation between Los Angeles police and 
Muslims last month. Both incidents prompted a series of unprecedented meetings 
between high-level law- enforcement officials and black leaders representing 
the Muslims, other religious groups, civil rights organizations and community 
groups. The meetings, organized largely by Danny Bakewell of the Brotherhood 
Crusade and Councilman Nate Holden, have started a beneficial dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the sessions, the Sheriff's Department produced a training video 
for all deputies that outlines the Nation of Islam's history and its small 
presence in Los Angeles. The presentation also acknowledges that Muslims and 
law enforcement share some worthwhile goals, specifically, "to get young black 
men and women out of gangs and to keep them off of drugs." The message -- and 
effort to reach an understanding -- are commendable. 
</P>
<P>
Minister Louis Farrakhan, the controversial leader of the Nation of Islam, 
should respond in kind when he visits Los Angeles this weekend. Farrakhan can 
be offensive and incendiary -- his virulent anti-Semitic speeches are well 
known -- but he can also be eloquent. He should tone down his hate-mongering 
and advocate a continuing dialogue to ease tensions between local police and 
Los Angeles' black community. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff Block has made it clear his department is not at war with Muslims. 
Farrakhan must send out a similarly sensitive message. No one wants more 
bloodshed.

President Bush and Secretary James A. Baker III may be on the verge of turning 
the military success of the Panama invasion into the political fiasco of the 
1990s. The U.S. Southern Command's newspaper headlined the problem earlier this 
week: "Breakdown in law, order spreads fear." 
</P>
<P>
That's putting it mildly. An internal report prepared by the Southern Command 
portrayed the successor to Manuel A. Noriega's Panamanian Defense Forces, the 
Public Forces, as indequate in terms of personnel, training, organization, 
discipline and morale. Which means that the President's rush to withdraw all 
the American troops sent to Panama in December is terribly misguided. Indeed, 
the United States has no choice but to become more involved in re-establishing 
the security of Panamanians and Americans in the country. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. help in keeping order and training the new Public Forces will take months. 
Although thousands of arms have been confiscated since the invasion, armed 
robberies and other assaults are widespread. What's more, many Panamanians 
don't yet trust the new police force since many of its members previously 
worked for Noriega. In response, some Panamanians have called for the formation 
of local defense brigades, which would no doubt increase the violence and 
death. 
</P>
<P>
"How long?" was the question most asked during Vice President Dan Quayle's 
visit to Panama last weekend. President's Bush answer should be, "Not yet."

OVERCOMING CAPTIVITY TO THE WORST IN US; 
</P>
<P>
NATION OF ISLAM: ITS LEADER'S RHETORIC MAY BE UNSETTLING, BUT ITS ANTI-GANG, 
ANTI-DRUG MESSAGE IS A POSITIVE FORCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

in the Pan African Studies Department at Cal State Los Angeles.

<TEXT>
<P>
Minister Louis Farrakhan, leader of the Nation of Islam, comes to Los Angeles 
today to make a speech. His arrival will be marked by controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Farrakhan's organization, which is viewed with suspicion and fear by some 
Americans, arose in the 1930s as a response to white racism and structured 
inequality. The tenets of the religion offer clues to the conditions that 
stimulated its growth and development: self-pride, collective effort and 
economic self-sufficiency. Spiritual resurrection, self-examination, 
self-analysis and self-correction are emphasized. Members are known for 
humility and respect for others. The "uniform" of male members is a suit and 
tie. Gender relationships are viewed as egalitarian, although men and women 
have tightly prescribed roles and responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps most significant is the fact that the Nation of Islam works and works 
well. Whereas most American institutions consider certain segments of the 
African American community incorrigible, the Nation focuses on the downtrodden 
-- the unemployed, the gang member, the drug dealer, the incarcerated felon -- 
and seeks to transform these lowliest members of our society into productive 
citizens. Their success abounds. 
</P>
<P>
The late Malcolm X, a self-educated former felon, was the charismatic leader of 
the Nation who best symbolized the transformation of former criminals into 
religious and civic leaders. Today, positive Muslim influence is pervasive in 
U.S. prisons. 
</P>
<P>
Children attend schools in uniform and appear to succeed academically. In Los 
Angeles, efforts by the Nation have produced reductions in gang participation 
and graffiti. Men and women who join the Nation renounce drug use and become 
part of a community committed to economic and psychological self-sufficiency. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Nation of Islam has succeeded in transforming portions of the 
African American community into productive citizens, it feels under siege by 
law- enforcement agencies that are too quick to call for reinforcements, too 
quick to arrest and too quick to shoot to kill. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Oliver Beasley, a member of the Nation of Islam in Los Angeles, was 
fatally shot by a sheriff's deputy. His death exacerbates the strained 
relations between law enforcement and the African American community and 
illustrates the continuing frustration among inner-city blacks -- and the real 
and potential role of the Nation of Islam in America. 
</P>
<P>
The killing of an African American man by law-enforcement officers is not 
unusual. The media have successfully drawn an exaggerated portrait of the inner 
city as plagued by crime, drug abuse, violence and homicide. Law-enforcement 
officers are, not surprisingly, paranoid. The killing of a member of the 
Nation, however, is incongruous because of the group's reputation for obeying 
the law and living morally. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the language of the Nation's leadership scares many Americans. The late 
Elijah Muhammad, considered the Nation's prophet, spoke of "the fall of 
America," and Farrakhan asks, "Can America save herself?" On closer 
examination, one can see that these statements are rhetorical. In the context 
of Farrakhan's messages, the question is not threatening but an expression of 
fear: "Can America save herself -- from herself?" In this respect, the Nation 
of Islam may be viewed as America's conscience, and this may account for the 
frequently strong opposition to its perceived purposes. After all, its 
leadership repeatedly denounces many of our cherished ideals and institutions. 
</P>
<P>
America was founded in a climate of racial separation and white supremacy, a 
legacy that we continue to struggle to overcome. Thus, American proclamations 
of freedom and democracy ring hollow for those who have experienced structured 
inequality, and the Nation of Islam and its leadership unabashedly attacks this 
profound hypocrisy. 
</P>
<P>
Its objective of racial separation, therefore, is more properly viewed as an 
acquiescence to the separatism imposed by whites. The Nation of Islam merely 
seeks justice and equal opportunity. Instead of being a hate group, it is an 
anti-hate group. 
</P>
<P>
Some statements by Farrakhan are more problematic, and many people 
understandably regard them as anti-Semitic. These statements -- which may, in 
part, be reflective of a long-standing conflict between Islam and Judaism in 
the Middle East -- unfortunately broaden the chasm between African Americans 
and Jewish Americans. Farrakhan must find language that solves this conflict, 
but more important, Jewish Americans must bring pressure to bear on Israel to 
end its abhorrent ties to South Africa. Moreover, Farrakhan is much more 
critical of African Americans than any other group in his quest for individual 
and social change. 
</P>
<P>
The Nation of Islam consciously avoids blaming the dominant culture for the 
plight of African Americans (although such blame is not without merit), and 
instead seeks to transform the individual from within. Thus, the goals of the 
Nation are not subversive of the state, but subversive of the individual's 
captivity to hedonism, materialism, racism and sexism. 
</P>
<P>
We should observe and listen closely to the Nation of Islam. It offers a 
program of individual and social change that could be used as a model to 
produce long-term solutions to the plight of the poor and to end the 
inconsistency between our words and deeds concerning freedom and justice in 
America.

DAVIS CUP; 
</P>
<P>
U.S. SUBS ARE READY FOR MEXICO 
</P>

<P>
If this is the Davis Cup, there must be turmoil, so leave it to the United 
States to get the ball rolling. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. team, which hasn't won the Davis Cup in eight years, starts searching 
for it again today at La Costa as the heavy favorite in a first-round match 
against Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
But first, some questions need answering: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Where's Andre Agassi? 
</P>
<P>
Probably color-coordinating his shirts at home in Las Vegas, where he chose to 
remain after being passed over. Then, afforded the chance to reconsider, Agassi 
just said no. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Where's John McEnroe? 
</P>
<P>
Certainly not in Australia or posing for any airport photos, not after his 
wallet was $6,500 lighter because of fines and after he poked his finger at a 
photographer at LAX upon his return home. McEnroe doesn't play Davis Cup 
first-rounders, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Where are Ken Flach and Robert Seguso? 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, they were in Abilene, Tex., playing a doubles exhibition. 
They were not preparing for Davis Cup because the Ken and Bob Show is off the 
air after absorbing its first Davis Cup loss last summer in West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"We lose one lousy match . . . " said Seguso. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Where are Rick Leach and Jim Pugh? 
</P>
<P>
They were up there on the dais at Thursday's draw, introduced by referee Javier 
Sansierra of Spain as "Leets" and "Poog." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Where's Chucky Adams? 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with the theme of this Davis Cup, practice player Adams got his big 
break here. He broke a bone in his foot, joining Michael Chang, who has a 
separated bone in his hip, and Aaron Krickstein, who has a pulled groin, on the 
U.S. all-hospital team. 
</P>
<P>
All set? Let's play ball. Jay Berger plays the first singles match today at 
noon against Jorge Lozano, followed by Brad Gilbert against Leonardo Lavalle. 
The four will switch opponents Sunday after Leach and Pugh play Lozano and 
Lavalle in Saturday's doubles match. 
</P>
<P>
Half of the U.S. team is new, or at least different from the squad originally 
selected. When Chang and Krickstein could not play because of injuries, U.S. 
captain Tom Gorman named Gilbert and Berger to replace them. 
</P>
<P>
But to many, the real question is not who is playing, but how long it will 
take. A 5-0 sweep? Let's just say the United States is confident. 
</P>
<P>
When he was named to play against Mexico as a substitute for Chang, Gilbert 
said four or five different U. S. teams could beat Mexico. He was more 
conservative Thursday when asked about American prospects. 
</P>
<P>
"I like our chances," Gilbert said. "I think even though this is the 
replacement team, we are not quite like the scout football players. I see 
things looking good for us." 
</P>
<P>
For Mexico then, the view must not be quite so good. Coach Antonio Palofax 
acknowledged that his players would be bucking difficult odds. 
</P>
<P>
"For us to win, yes, it would be an upset, but there is always a chance," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert, who has experienced difficulty with Lavalle, has at least already 
swamped him in the rankings. Gilbert is No. 4 in the world, Lavalle No. 157. 
</P>
<P>
Lavalle is 3-1 against Gilbert but lost to him in 1986 in their only previous 
Davis Cup encounter. 
</P>
<P>
Berger has not played Lavalle or Lozano. He is ranked No. 11 in the world, and 
Lozano is No. 348. Named to the team only last Saturday after Krickstein was 
forced to pull out and Agassi passed on Gorman's invitation, Berger arrived 
Sunday at La Costa, only five days before his match. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care if I had to travel three times around the world, I'd be here to 
play," Berger said. 
</P>
<P>
What they're playing on is a medium-fast hardcourt, resurfaced a couple of 
weeks ago. The legendary Pancho Segura, La Costa's director of tennis, believes 
the surface will favor neither team. 
</P>
<P>
His pick? 
</P>
<P>
"I only hope that it is 1-1 after the first day so there is a lot of 
excitement," Segura said. "Then, as you know, anything can happen in Davis 
Cup." 
</P>
<P>
Davis Cup Notes 
</P>
<P>
The displaced doubles team of Ken Flach and Robert Seguso is gone, but not 
forgotten, at least for this round. Seguso believes that Rick Leach and Jim 
Pugh will do all right in their Davis Cup debut Saturday. "They're a very good 
team," he said. "They're very eager. That's what doubles are all about -- all 
eagerness. I'm sure they shouldn't have too much trouble." Flach said he 
understood when U. S. Captain Tom Gorman told him he was turning to Leach and 
Pugh to get them some Davis Cup experience. . . . If the U. S. team beats 
Mexico this weekend, its second-round opponent is expected to be 
Czechoslovakia, which plays Switzerland this weekend. "I'll miss La Costa," 
Flach said. "I told Gorman, 'Let us play La Costa and send Leach and Pugh to 
Czechoslovakia.' "

MAJOR WIN FOR USC ON MINER SHOT; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE BASKETBALL: RAVELING'S TEAM BEATS UCLA FOR THE FIRST TIME IN EIGHT 
TRIES. BRUINS CAN'T GET OFF LAST-SECOND SHOT AND FALL FROM FIRST, 76-75. 
</P>

<P>
A free throw by freshman Harold Miner with 30 seconds left Thursday night at 
the Sports Arena gave USC a 76-75 upset victory over UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
On a night when UCLA's Trevor Wilson fell hard to the floor in the first half, 
bruising his back and spraining his right wrist, the Trojans took the lead for 
good, strangely enough, after Wilson returned. 
</P>
<P>
USC never trailed in the last 17 minutes as it won for only the second time in 
10 Pacific 10 Conference games, knocking UCLA out of a share of the conference 
lead. Miner scored 27 points. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA failed to attempt a shot in the last 30 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
After Miner made the second of two free throws, UCLA brought the ball up the 
floor and was attempting to set up a potential go-ahead shot when Ronnie 
Coleman intercepted a pass by the Bruins' Don MacLean. 
</P>
<P>
"They ran a play we'd practiced against all week," USC Coach George Raveling 
said. "They did not run a surprise play." 
</P>
<P>
Coleman was fouled with 7.5 seconds left, but missed the front end of a 
one-and-one, giving the Bruins another chance. 
</P>
<P>
This time, Darrick Martin brought the ball up the floor before dishing off too 
late to Wilson, who took the pass as the buzzer sounded. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't bring it up quickly enough," UCLA Coach Jim Harrick said of his 
sophomore point guard. "Credit that to youth and inexperience. That play didn't 
beat us. Twenty-five other plays beat us." 
</P>
<P>
The game was UCLA's worst of the season, Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
USC ended a four-game losing streak and improved to 7-10 overall in winning for 
the first time against UCLA in eight games under Raveling. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA, ranked 16th, fell to 14-4 overall and 8-2 in the Pac-10, a game behind 
Oregon State, a 98-81 winner over California Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson and freshman Tracy Murray scored 19 points each for the Bruins, who got 
12 points and a career-high 16 rebounds from MacLean. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman scored 19 points and had nine rebounds for USC. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe this," said MacLean, who made only five of 16 shots and missed 
a pair of free throws with 1:40 remaining and UCLA trailing, 73-70. "I can't 
believe we lost to these guys when it was so important." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA made only four of 15 free throws in the second half. Wilson, his wrist 
ailing, made two of eight. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about his wrist, Wilson said tersely: "Painful." 
</P>
<P>
USC's Calvin Banks, who had made only eight of 32 free throws this season, made 
two with 1:38 left to give the Trojans a 75-70 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked over to Coach and he kind of smiled at me, and I smiled back," Banks 
said. "That took a little bit of the pressure off." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson then made a running jump shot with 1:10 left to cut the Bruins' deficit 
to 75-72. After Banks lost the ball out of bounds, Gerald Madkins made a free 
throw for UCLA with 45 seconds left to make it 75-73. 
</P>
<P>
Madkins missed a second foul shot, but Wilson stole the rebound from Keith 
Greeley and scored on a layup to tie the score with 38 seconds to go. 
</P>
<P>
It was 75-75, but the Bruins never took another shot. 
</P>
<P>
"A win like this will soothe a lot of wounds," Raveling said. "It's the perfect 
balm for our disappointments." 
</P>
<P>
USC was 3-9 under Raveling in games decided by two points or less. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA led, 15-12, when Wilson took his painful tumble. 
</P>
<P>
As USC's Chris Munk drove around Madkins on a fast break with 13:15 left in the 
first half, Wilson rose to block Munk's layup attempt. He seemed to graze the 
Trojan center and fell hard to the floor along the baseline, landing on his 
right side and rolling his body over his right wrist. 
</P>
<P>
Munk missed the shot, but Robert Pack scored on a follow. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a big bruise on his back where he landed," UCLA's team physician, 
Gerald Finerman, said of Wilson, who was scheduled to have precautionary X-rays 
taken on his wrist later in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
With Finerman and trainer Tony Spino attending to Wilson on the bench, the 
Bruins then outscored USC, 13-6, to open a 28-18 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson eventually was taken to the locker room for treatment before returning 
to the bench with five minutes left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
In Wilson's absence, Murray scored 13 of his 15 first-half points, making four 
of six shots as UCLA forged a 44-38 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Miner, limited to six-of-20 shooting and 15 points last month in the Trojans' 
89-72 loss to the Bruins at Pauley Pavilion, scored 14 points in the first 
half, making five of 10 shots. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, his wrist taped, returned for the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Even with Wilson back on the floor, however, USC outscored the Bruins, 13-2, to 
start the half. Pack scored the Trojans' first 10 points, making a pair of 
three-point shots as USC pulled even at 46-46, then stripping MacLean and 
scoring on a layup to give USC a 48-46 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Miner then made a three-point shot to make it 51-46. 
</P>
<P>
Trojan-Bruin Notes 
</P>
<P>
In four games as the Bruins' starting center, Tracy Murray is averaging 18.2 
points and 5.2 rebounds and has made 65% of his shots. "The addition of Murray 
has made our team more fluid, a lot better offensively," UCLA Coach Jim Harrick 
said. "He's made us a lot better club." And don't be too hasty in conceding 
Pac-10 freshman of the year honors to USC's Harold Miner, Harrick said this 
week, invoking the names of Murray and California's Brian Hendrick. Columnist 
Joe Jares of the L. A. Daily News told Harrick at Harrick's weekly media 
luncheon: "I'd probably give it to Murray because he sat in front of me at a 
Westwood theater the other day and had the courtesy to move." Murray is 6-8, 
with a flattop haircut that rises at least another inch above the top of his 
head.

MORNING BRIEFING: SUNDAY SILENCE SHOULD HAVE AN EASY GO OF ECLIPSING 1989 FEATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARR KLUENDER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What makes Eclipse Award winner Sunday Silence such a great thoroughbred? 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Beyer of the Washington Post writes: 
</P>
<P>
"Sunday Silence is the most adaptable champion since Affirmed. He has raw speed 
that enables him to be a front-runner if his jockey chooses. He can sit behind 
the leaders and use that speed to accelerate sharply at a crucial stage of the 
race -- as he did when he out-kicked Easy Goer on the turn at the Breeders' 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
"No conditions seem to faze him. When he encountered an unfamiliar muddy track 
at the Kentucky Derby, he handled it successfully -- while Easy Goer didn't. 
When he was stopped cold at a critical stage of the Preakness -- trouble that 
would have spelled certain defeat for almost any other horse -- he recovered 
immediately and rushed back into contention. 
</P>
<P>
"If Sunday Silence had been retired at the end of 1989, we might have concluded 
that he hadn't won enough big races to earn recognition as an all-time great, 
but that he had shown as much talent as just about any American race horse 
since Spectacular Bid. On the basis of his Breeders' Cup performance, I believe 
he could have beaten Alysheba, Ferdinand, Lady's Secret or Spend a Buck -- the 
last four horses of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"Fortunately, it is not necessary to speculate about how good Sunday Silence 
could be, because the colt will race again this season as a 4-year-old. There 
is every reason to believe he will get better and better." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: The Golden State Warriors' Chris Mullin is on a pace to become the 
first player since the 1969-70 season to finish an NBA season in the top 10 in 
scoring, field-goal percentage and free-throw percentage. Who was the last to 
do it? 
</P>
<P>
Getting out the voter: The Philadelphia 76ers were kicked out of their hotel 
rooms in Miami recently when President Bush made a surprise visit. The Secret 
Service said it needed the rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Said 76er forward Charles Barkley: "I can't believe they let him bump us. I've 
been in the league six years. He's been in one year. I voted for him, but he 
won't be re-elected now." 
</P>
<P>
Add Barkley: Barkley, who is paid $3 million a year, has been fined $15,350 
this season. He reportedly plans to deduct the fines from his income tax. 
</P>
<P>
A vote for Davis: Gene Collier of the Pittsburgh Press on the failure of the 
Raiders' Al Davis to gain election to the Pro Football Hall of Fame: 
</P>
<P>
"Al Davis is selfish, egomaniacal and mercenary and puts his own vibrancy and 
that of his Raiders ahead of all else, which is only what just about every 
owner in every sport is and does without penalty. 
</P>
<P>
"His contribution, beyond the obvious, is that he has lent the league an 
antagonist franchise and kept the whole story line from being terminally, 
Establishment dull. 
</P>
<P>
"How can you have a Hall of Fame without this guy? In time, that will qualify 
as a rhetorical question." 
</P>
<P>
The simple pleasures: Hall of Fame defensive lineman Art Donovan in "Fatso," by 
Bob Drury, on today's NFL salaries: 
</P>
<P>
"I guess it's good I got out when I did, because high finance for me is merely 
enough dough for a hunk of kosher salami or baloney, a loaf of Jewish rye and a 
case of Schlitz." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: The Atlanta Hawks' Lou Hudson. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Tom Miller, University of Colorado basketball coach, on playing 
top-ranked Missouri at Boulder, Colo., last Saturday, playing at No. 2 Kansas 
Wednesday and at Missouri Sunday: "One-two-one. I'm going to have to find out 
who made that schedule." GARR KLUENDER

TV-RADIO: WHEN BUCKNER PLAYS SHOW AND TELL, HE DOESN'T HAVE TO YELL

Quinn Buckner is becoming the quintessential basketball commentator. He simply 
does the job the way it should be done. 
</P>
<P>
In direct contrast to Dick Vitale, Buckner doesn't dominate a telecast. He 
doesn't rant and rave and attempt to draw attention to himself. All he does is 
make good observations without intruding.

<P>
That's really all any sports commentator needs to do. 
</P>

Buckner will work Saturday's Loyola Marymount-Louisiana State game for CBS with 
play-by-play partner James Brown. The game, the second of a CBS doubleheader, 
begins at 11 a.m., after the Georgetown-St. John's game. 
</P>
<P>
Buckner, who is not employed full time by CBS, also works for ESPN and Prime 
Ticket, doing mainly Big West Conference telecasts. He became affiliated with 
West Coast basketball after moving from the Milwaukee area to Yorba Linda last 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
Buckner, a business major at Indiana, is one of six partners in a Covina-based 
firm, Data Line, which does data processing for banks and savings and loans. 
The group bought the company in December 1988, and when Buckner grew tired of 
commuting, he moved to Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Buckner is half of the answer to this trivia question: What two basketball 
players were on a state high school championship team, an NCAA champion, an 
Olympic gold medal-winning team and an NBA champion. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Lucas is the other half. 
</P>
<P>
Buckner's Thornridge High School team won the Illinois state title; his 1976 
Indiana team won the NCAA championship; he played on the Olympic team later 
that year, and he was with the Boston Celtics when they won it all in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Buckner played most of his pro career with Milwaukee and finished with the 
Indiana Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
His college coach, Bob Knight, is the person who got Buckner into broadcasting 
after he retired from the NBA in 1986. Knight got him together with former ABC 
Sports executive Chuck Howard, who hired Buckner to work on his Big Ten 
basketball package. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was in college, Coach (Buckner calls Knight simply 'Coach') told me I 
should get into broadcasting," Buckner said Thursday prior to leaving for Baton 
Rogue, La. "I never took him seriously. 
</P>
<P>
"Then he recommended me to Chuck Howard, a friend of his, after I retired." 
</P>
<P>
Turns out that maybe Knight, of all people, has a knack for spotting 
broadcasting talents. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, during Buckner's first season on the Big Ten package, ESPN took note 
and hired Buckner as a free-lancer the next season. 
</P>
<P>
Then CBS got on the Buckner bandwagon, using him last season. His first CBS 
assignment, coincidentally, was a Loyola Marymount game. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Ticket hired Buckner this season after he moved to the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
NBC announced Thursday that it has hired Jimmy Connors and Chris Evert as its 
main tennis commentators. 
</P>
<P>
That means that Connors will not play at Wimbledon or in the French Open. 
</P>
<P>
It also means viewers will see less of Bud Collins, who is being retained by 
NBC but only as an interviewer/reporter and backup play-by-play announcer. 
Collins was given a new long-term contract. 
</P>
<P>
Evert will make her NBC debut at the Family Circle Cup in April, and Connors 
will make his debut at the French Open in June. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Chirkinian, who has been producing golf for CBS since 1958, like so many 
others, watched the new NBC golf team of Bryant Gumbel and Johnny Miller with 
interest on telecasts of the Bob Hope Classic two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
So, what did he think? 
</P>
<P>
Chirkinian, in Pebble Beach for this week's National Pro-Am, said he didn't 
care to comment, but did anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess Gumbel doesn't know what fringe is," Chirkinian said. "He called it 
fuzz. Did you hear that? 
</P>
<P>
"When Peter Jacobsen's ball on (No.) 18 ended up on the fringe, Gumbel said, 
'I'm not sure what they call that, but it looks like fuzz.' " 
</P>
<P>
Chirkinian said of Dick Ebersol, NBC Sports president: "He must not consider 
golf a sport." 
</P>
<P>
Why is that? 
</P>
<P>
"He assigned Gumbel to it." 
</P>
<P>
Of Miller, Chirkinian said: "He may develop but he was pretty stiff." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Chirkinian is partial to his announcers, Pat Summerall and Ken 
Venturi, who work the 18th tower, and Jim Nantz, Gary McCord, Ben Wright and 
Steve Melnyk. 
</P>
<P>
After the Pebble Beach tournament, this crew will next work the L.A. Open Feb. 
22-25. 
</P>
<P>
The latest thing for your VCR is something called a video magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Nicklaus Productions, in a joint venture with ABC Sports, has created the 
first of a planned six bi-monthly editions entitled "Wide World of Golf." 
</P>
<P>
The video magazine is being sold only through mail-order subscriptions, 
obtained through advertisements and direct-mail solicitation, and at golf pro 
shops. 
</P>
<P>
A one-year subscription costs $99.95, while individual tapes go for $29.95. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is to give golfers not only an instructional tape, but one that is 
also informational and entertaining," said Terry Jastrow, ABC golf producer who 
is also Nicklaus' partner in the Santa Monica-based production company. 
</P>
<P>
Jastrow said that if the project is well received, they will produce video 
magazines dealing with other sports as well as non-sports topics. 
</P>
<P>
TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
Candidates for commentators' jobs on NBC's NBA coverage next season include 
Chuck Daly, Julius Erving and Laker Coach Pat Riley. CBS was interested in 
Riley before this season, but couldn't to wrest him away from the Lakers. NBC 
probably won't be able to either. Daly, a former cable commentator in 
Philadelphia, is a more viable candidate. . . . Coverage of today's round of 
the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am will be carried by the USA network, delayed, 
at 4 p.m. and repeated at 9 p.m. Weekend coverage on CBS begins at 1 p.m. 
Saturday and 12:30 p.m. Sunday. . . . A reminder: Bill Shoemaker's last ride 
will be televised Saturday on ABC's "Wide World of Sports." Incredibly, it's 
being delayed on the West Coast. Although ABC is not saying when Shoe's race 
will be shown, it will probably be at the end of the show. . . Also on "Wide 
World" Saturday will be delayed coverage of a fight between Mike McCallum and 
Steve Collins and taped coverage of the George Foreman-Gerry Cooney fiasco. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's Hector Camacho-Vinny Pazienza fight will be on pay-per-view cable 
television and also shown at a number of bar-restaurants in Southern 
California. They include: Cheers in Simi Valley, Don Enrique's in Santa Monica, 
Dream at 1717 Silver Lake Blvd., the National Orange Show in San Bernardino, 
the Tree House in Diamond Bar, the Sports Deli in Century City, Zubies in Costa 
Mesa, and the Red Onions in Marina del Rey, Lakewood and on Wilshire Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Former Ram general manager Don Klosterman, now the chairman of NTN, a Carlsbad 
communications company, said the video game QB1, created by his company seven 
years ago, is starting to take off. The computer game is played along a 
football telecast, and more people played during last Sunday's Super Bowl than 
ever before. There have been more than one million players, according to 
Klosterman, who said he is close to landing a major sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
NBC has colorful Jorge Paez fighting on its "SportsWorld" Sunday at 10 a.m. On 
the same show will be coverage of the Pizza Hut All-Star softball game, 
featuring major league stars. Bob Costas and Tony Kubek are the announcers. It 
will be NBC's final baseball venture, at least for four years, since CBS takes 
over. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers have switched radio stations, going from KRTH to KRLA. The switch 
came about because KRTH, after being sold, changed formats. . . . Magic Johnson 
was the easy winner of Channel 2's "L.A. Athlete of the Decade" call-in poll. 
Johnson got 50% of the votes, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 27%, Marcus Allen and Wayne 
Gretzky each 8% and Orel Hershiser 7%. Proceeds from the calls, about $4,000, 
will be donated to the Bay Area Earthquake Relief Fund. 
</P>
<P>
Mizlou's Sports News Network (SNN), a new 24-hour sports network, made its 
debut Thursday night. But only one Southern California cable company, 
Calavision of Calabasas, is carrying it for now. . . . Personnel moves: Randy 
Kerndoon, formerly of KWNK, has been hired by KFWB as a morning sports anchor. 
He begins his new job Monday. . . . ESPN has hired another woman sports anchor, 
Anne Montgomery, 34, who has been working in Phoenix. She has also been an 
official in several sports. Carolyn Burns, who has been doing some anchor work 
on the late-night edition of "SportsCenter," has been re-assigned to reporting.

EXPLOSIVE LOYOLA BASKETBALL TEAM PACKS ARENAS FROM COAST TO COAST

Fastest draw in the West? 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, it's no contest. Wherever Loyola Marymount plays, tickets are at 
a premium. 
</P>
<P>
Last week the Lions set an attendance record of 4,886 at Portland's Chiles 
Center on a rainy Oregon night, then played before a standing-room-only crowd 
at Gonzaga. Two weeks before, it was standing room only at Santa Clara and San 
Diego, where spectators were warned that if they left the gym at halftime they 
wouldn't get back in. 
</P>
<P>
On Loyola's Eastern swing in the first week of January, the Lions set a 
field-house record of 3,200 at St. Joseph's in Philadelphia, then played 
LaSalle before a house of 10,004 in the Philadelphia Civic Center, a sellout 
despite cable television coverage. 
</P>
<P>
In December the Lions drew 9,183 at Oregon State on another wet evening in the 
Northwest, and in Cincinnati a season-high Xavier crowd of 8,741 turned out 
although the game was on local TV. 
</P>
<P>
Another large crowd is expected Saturday when Loyola plays Louisiana State in 
the 14,236-seat Maravich Assembly Center in a nationally televised game. 
</P>
<P>
"We should be getting a percentage of the gate," Lions Coach Paul Westhead 
quipped. 
</P>
<P>
At home, the Lions are nearly averaging sellout level, thanks to several 
standing-room-only crowds that have topped the official Gersten Pavilion 
seating capacity of 4,156. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions' crowd-pleasing style and high-scoring feats have not been lost on 
the youngest fans, even on the road, where fans root against the Lions for 40 
minutes, then mob their locker room for autographs. 
</P>
<P>
After last week's game at Gonzaga, security personnel at Martin Centre needed 
police barriers to keep droves of autograph seekers from Loyola's locker room. 
When Hank Gathers emerged, he asked one young Spokane boy: "Who's your favorite 
player?" In a sincere voice, the youngster replied, "You are, Hank." He got his 
autograph. 
</P>
<P>
Westhead may have taken a cue from Sylvester Stallone, who learned that 
whatever the critics say, action is boffo at the box office. 
</P>
<P>
The makeup of the California Collegiate Athletic Assn., which loses Cal State 
Northridge after this school year, faces a further challenge if a new baseball 
conference is in the works. 
</P>
<P>
The CCAA has long billed itself as the Division II "Conference of Champions" 
and has dominated nationally in a number of sports. But Northridge is upgrading 
its program to Division I next fall, depriving the conference of a perennial 
contender in volleyball, swimming, softball and baseball. UC Riverside is 
studying a move as well. 
</P>
<P>
Now Chapman College in Orange apparently is considering upgrading its baseball 
program to Division I. Chapman reportedly has received an invitation to join 
Grand Canyon College of Phoenix -- which has made plans to go up to Division I 
in 1991 -- Sacramento State, a perennial Division II baseball power, and U.S. 
International, a Division I independent, in forming a new conference. With UC 
Riverside also looking at Division I, the CCAA could suddenly be down to five 
baseball teams. 
</P>
<P>
However, Cal State Dominguez Hills Athletic Director Dan Guerrero, who is on 
the CCAA planning committee, points out that for now that is Chapman baseball 
Coach Mike Weathers' desire. Chapman has no athletic director and its 
department is in flux. 
</P>
<P>
"The desire is but one (aspect)," Guerrero said. "There's practicality, 
expenses, scholarships. There's a lot to consider. (A move by Chapman) would 
obviously impact our conference. There's a kind of domino effect. You have to 
watch what the other schools in your conference are doing." 
</P>
<P>
The CCAA expects to bolster its membership by adding Cal State San Bernardino, 
possibly by the next school year. Guerrero said the NCAA is also studying 
several suggestions to make Division II more attractive both to low-level 
Division I schools and high-powered Division III members. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman is expected to announce its decision by June. 
</P>
<P>
While the Dominguez Hills women's basketball team has faded in conference play, 
freshman center Yvonne Vanlandingham has continued excellent play. The 6-foot 
center out of Long Beach Poly High leads the Lady Toros in scoring at 11.3 
points per game, which also tops all freshmen in the conference. She ranks 
among conference leaders in rebounds (7.2 per game), steals (33) and blocked 
shots (14). 
</P>
<P>
Interpreters Apply Within -- This quote last week from Cal State Los Angeles 
basketball Coach Henry Dyer after his team lost to Dominguez Hills, 64-62: "We 
reacted like the barn was on fire and (Dominguez Hills) reacted like they were 
at a funeral. It's tough to win against that kind of play." 
</P>
<P>
Stat of the Week: The Cal State Dominguez Hills men's basketball was 0-8 in 
games in which it trailed at the half until Saturday night, when the Toros 
erased a halftime deficit of 33-29 and defeated Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, 
58-56. 
</P>
<P>
College Notes:Loyola's Bo Kimble was named West Coast Conference basketball 
Player of the Month for January. He averaged 34.8 points and 7.8 rebounds and 
shot 56.4% in leading the Lions to an 8-1 record. Kimble was WCC Player of the 
Month in December as well. Kimble was also named WCC Player of the Week for the 
fifth time this season . . . If Kimble leads the nation in scoring, on the 
heels of Hank Gathers' doing so last season, they would be the only teammates 
to do so in consecutive seasons since Furman's Frank Selvy in 1954 and Darrell 
Floyd in 1955 . . . Former Dominguez Hills golfer Pat Burke recently qualified 
for the pro tour. Burke earned All-American honors for the Toros as a junior in 
1985 . . . Loyola forward Per Stumer has re-emerged in the Lions offense. In 
six conference games he is shooting 68% and is 13 of 21 from three-point range 
(62%) while averaging 11.2 points and 7.7 rebounds. Since returning from the 
team's East Coast swing the first week of January, Stumer has scored in double 
figures in all but one game . . . The Loyola lacrosse club will play host to 
Humboldt State at noon Saturday and Occidental at noon Sunday.

LADY TOROS MUST TRY TO LOSE THEIR LOSING WAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL McLEOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER / This is a story Van Girard hoped he would 
not have to read this year. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
His Cal State Dominguez Hills women's basketball team is faltering -- really 
faltering. 
</P>
<P>
The Lady Toros, 1-4 in the California Collegiate Athletic Assn., have lost 
three straight games and eight of their last 10. Losses tonight against Chapman 
College (14-6, 2-3) at Carson and Saturday at Orange would virtually eliminate 
Dominguez Hills from playoff contention. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some little things on the floor that we are not doing to win 
basketball games," Girard admitted. 
</P>
<P>
The season started bright enough. By the first week in December the Lady Toros 
had a five-game winning streak and seven victories, more than in 1986, Girard's 
rookie year. 
</P>
<P>
Road losses at UC Davis and Sacramento State and at home against Cal State 
Hayward started the slide. But when looking back on the 1989-90 season, it 
might be the final two minutes of the first half in a 78-50 loss at Cal Poly 
Pomona that will be viewed as the turning point. 
</P>
<P>
Riddled by the flu, the team suited just seven players against the nationally 
second-ranked Lady Broncos. However, with two minutes left in the half the Lady 
Toros had the ball and a chance to tie the score at 33. But a turnover opened 
the door for powerful Pomona. The Lady Broncos quickly opened a 42-31 halftime 
lead, then shook Dominguez Hills with a 15-2 run in the first seven minutes of 
the final half. 
</P>
<P>
In watching the Lady Toros play since that meeting three weeks ago, it appears 
that they are still trying to regain composure, playing, perhaps, with the fear 
that a good season has gone sour. In a 50-45 loss at Cal State Los Angeles Jan. 
20, they shot six one-and-one situations in the final 1:40 and missed the front 
end of each. In last week's 79-63 home-court loss to Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, 
they fell behind, 21-4, and shot just 33% from the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Call it the snowball effect. Girard concedes that the Lady Toros are struggling 
from one game to the next. 
</P>
<P>
"In our conference, from a physical standpoint we are not going to overpower 
anyone," he said. "We have to play smart. When we don't, we won't win." 
</P>
<P>
Girard said it has been a combination "of little things" that has brought on 
the misfortune. He cited the flu, small injuries and his switch in 
concentration from defensive to offensive practice sessions. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still young," he said. "There's a period in the game when we're just not 
out there (mentally), and that really hurts us." 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Hills has a 9-10 record. Girard had been accustomed to winning, 
averaging 23 wins a season in 10 years at Lynwood High School. Hired in late 
July, 1988, he showed up at Dominguez Hills without a recruit and posted only a 
6-19 record but forced more turnovers (23.5 per game) than any other team in 
the conference. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's record, however, included a disappointing 1-11 CCAA mark. On paper, 
before this CCAA season, it appeared the Lady Toros had a good shot at reaching 
the .500 mark and making the conference postseason tournament. But to do that 
would mean winning five of the last six CCAA games. And the Lady Toros play at 
San Luis Obispo and play host to Pomona on consecutive weekends. 
</P>
<P>
"We've made a lot of progress in comparison to last year," Girard said. 
"There's lots of room for improvement, but we are not that far away." 
</P>
<P>
How far away they will be in the CCAA race will be determined this weekend, 
with both games in the home-and-home series beginning at 5:45 p.m.

RAUB'S ENCORE AS BASKETBALL COACH A SUCCESS FOR KENNEDY GIRLS' TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Their eyes bugged out, because right in front of them was a guy they thought 
had bugged out long ago. 
</P>
<P>
"The referees were great," Craig Raub said. "I hadn't seen them in a while, and 
their eyes got real big." 
</P>
<P>
Raub, you see, returned briefly as coach of the Kennedy High girls' basketball 
team last week. He coached the Golden Cougars to three City Section 4-A 
Division titles and nine Valley 4-A League titles in nine seasons. He retired 
in 1987, however, leaving Toya Holiday -- one of his former players -- in 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
Holiday, however, teaches at Frost Junior High in Granada Hills and does not 
arrive at Kennedy until well into the afternoon. The varsity game against 
Chatsworth last week was scheduled too early for Holiday to make it for the 
tip-off. 
</P>
<P>
So Raub, 37, who remains at Kennedy -- where he coaches tennis and is an 
assistant with the football team -- volunteered. 
</P>
<P>
It appears he hasn't lost his touch. By the time Holiday arrived at halftime, 
Kennedy enjoyed a 37-12 lead en route to a 63-34 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, it seems as though Kennedy, which has switched to the West Valley 
League, can win with anybody at the helm. The Golden Cougars' two wins last 
week stretched their win streak in league play to a state-record 134 over the 
past 14 seasons, Raub said. The streak spans the tenures of four different 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Legal move: Although some City Section football coaches have raised questions 
about their eligibility, Brian Brison and Leonice Brown appear to have 
satisfied state rules with their transfers to San Fernando. Brison left Alemany 
and enrolled at San Fernando last week and Brown, who left Crespi, will enroll 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
State eligibility rules require an athlete to sit out 12 calendar months after 
he or she transfers unless the athlete has moved or can prove hardship. 
</P>
<P>
Brison, a sophomore wide receiver and defensive back who also runs track, has 
moved into the San Fernando attendance area from the Poly area. Brown, a junior 
tailback who rushed for 1,097 yards last season, also claims he recently has 
moved. He declined to give details. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando football Coach Tom Hernandez said that the students will have no 
trouble gaining eligibility. "We make sure everything is OK before we do things 
around here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Delayed decision: Sylmar's Jerome Casey, who might have been the area's most 
versatile football player last season, probably will not make a decision on a 
college by Feb. 14, the first day high school seniors can sign national letters 
of intent. Casey has visited Nebraska, Washington and Washington State and will 
visit USC this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
He has failed to score 700 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test as required for 
athletic eligibility under NCAA Proposition 48. He took the test again Saturday 
but will not get the results until after Feb. 14. 
</P>
<P>
Casey said he was nervous the first time he took the test but that he is 
confident he will score sufficiently. 
</P>
<P>
"I was nervous because I know the test meant so much," he said. "They're basing 
so much of what happens to you on one test. But I've been taking an SAT class 
and I felt a lot better the second time." 
</P>
<P>
USC is Casey's first choice, but school policy prohibits accepting Prop. 48 
athletes. Casey might follow the example of Curtis Conway, the Hawthorne High 
quarterback who sat out the 1989 season until he passed the SAT. Conway will 
attend USC next fall on a scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
Casey, 5-foot-10, 180 pounds, rushed for 1,447 yards, caught 14 passes for 378 
yards and scored 26 touchdowns last fall. He also led the team with 70 tackles 
as a safety but said that he is being recruited as a running back. 
</P>
<P>
Brave youth: A week away from the boys' basketball playoffs, first-year Coach 
Alan Bennett of Birmingham might have the only surprising entry from the Valley 
Pac-8 Conference, a 74-61 loss to Sylmar on Thursday night notwithstanding. 
Four teams will advance to postseason play -- two from each of the Mid-Valley 
and East Valley leagues. 
</P>
<P>
North Hollywood and Reseda (Mid-Valley) and Grant (East Valley) have playoff 
berths all but sewn up, as expected. But Birmingham? The East Valley League 
team's coach called the season "a rebuilding year" way back in November. 
</P>
<P>
Talk about euphemisms. "Rebuilding year" generally translates into, "We may win 
a game or two if Jupiter aligns with its third moon and a couple of calls go 
our way." 
</P>
<P>
But Bennett has made the phrase a truism. Young players dominate a team 
learning Bennett's system. The Braves' starters include four juniors, and five 
of the top six players will return next year. 
</P>
<P>
Junior Brian Bennett (no relation to the coach) is averaging 14 points in 
conference play. Fellow junior Kevin Horton, playing the first organized 
basketball of his life, is averaging 10 points and nine rebounds in conference 
play. 
</P>
<P>
Three more juniors -- guard Chet Chea and big men Noah Kirshbaum (6-4) and 
Ignacio Esteeva (6-5) -- round out the youth movement. 
</P>
<P>
And, with a 4-4 league record, the Braves are one game ahead of third-place 
Sylmar with two games remaining. In other words, Bennett just may have built a 
playoff team. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not world-beaters, but we're starting to jell," Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
Play ball: Reseda's Mike Hawkins, a starter averaging 12 points and five 
rebounds a game, is making a timely return from an ankle injury. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkins will be ready to play tonight when his team faces Mid-Valley League 
leader North Hollywood. With a win, Reseda could grab a share of first place. 
</P>
<P>
"He's fine," Reseda Coach Jeff Halpern said. "He's ready to go. He's been 
jumping all week." 
</P>
<P>
Open for business: Anybody want to play a little football next fall? Looking 
for a little nonleague action? Give Granada Hills Athletic Director Don Stone a 
yell. 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills, the defending North Valley League champion, has open dates on 
Sept. 14, 22 and 27. 
</P>
<P>
Finding volunteers has not been easy. Hart recently backed away from a Stone 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
"They said we were too good," said Stone, a statement Hart Coach Mike 
Herrington admitted that he had made. 
</P>
<P>
Crespi was released from its Sept. 22 game at Pierce College so that the Celts 
could play former Del Rey League nemesis Loyola. Crespi and Loyola will be in 
different leagues next season. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a big money-maker for Crespi, so we let them out (of the agreement)," 
Stone said. "That could have been a good one -- a Saturday night game at 
Pierce." 
</P>
<P>
En garde: The verbal posturing, it seems, has not ended. 
</P>
<P>
Canoga Park basketball Coach Jeff Davis started the battle a month ago when he 
said he believed that two of his players, Marcus Reed and Lindsey Dunbar, 
formed the second-best guard tandem in the Valley. Only Cleveland's Eddie Hill 
and Andre Chevalier were better, in Davis' opinion. 
</P>
<P>
After Davis' statement was published, Granada Hills captain Jermoine Brantley 
took exception to the remarks -- and pointedly said so. 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills has since upset Cleveland, so Brantley and backcourt mate Osiris 
Nalls have a right to claim the top spot, Brantley said. 
</P>
<P>
"Before the (Cleveland) game, we got together," Brantley said. "We talked about 
how important it was in terms of the game but also to us as guards. We wanted 
all the skepticism (about who ranks first) to be tilted in our favor." 
</P>
<P>
For what it's worth, Nalls and Brantley outscored Hill and Chevalier, 37 to 28. 
</P>
<P>
Yet there is evidence to suggest that Brantley might not quite believe his own 
claims. For instance, after the Highlanders beat Cleveland, Brantley approached 
Hill and Chevalier and offered this frank assessment of what took place: "I 
told them they played a good game," Brantley said. "And that it took an 
excellent performance from our team to win."

GIANNINI WANTS BYE INSTEAD OF KENNEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Montclair Prep football Coach George Giannini said Thursday that his team will 
not play Kennedy in the fall, despite a published report that said such a 
meeting had been tentatively arranged. 
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the schools' athletic directors had agreed to the 
Sept. 22 game, pending approval from Giannini. 
</P>
<P>
But Giannini is strongly opposed to the game. 
</P>
<P>
"That report is absolutely premature," Giannini said. "Right now, there's no 
contract and there's no game. I want to take a bye on the third week. In fact, 
I'm absolutely not leaning toward playing that game. I think I'm almost sure 
we'll take a bye." 
</P>
<P>
Montclair Prep has scheduled nine games, including five against Alpha League 
opponents and three against nonleague foes Santa Paula, St. Genevieve and Simi 
Valley. Also included is a game against Oahu Farrington High in Honolulu as 
part of a tripleheader in Aloha Stadium in August. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon and Crespi also are scheduled to play Hawaiian teams, pending approval 
by the Southern Section. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Section rules allow for only 10 regular-season games, forcing the 
Mounties to take at least one bye -- in either the first week of the season 
(Sept. 7) or the third (Sept. 21). Giannini said that he would rather play the 
first week and take the third week off. 
</P>
<P>
"I would love to play Kennedy," Giannini said. "But I want to do what's best 
for our program. And that would mean taking the third week as a bye." 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy Coach Bob Francola said that his City Section team is willing to play 
if Giannini changes his mind.

FISHING NOTES;

<P>
GIANT BLACK SEA BASS BACK ON THE LOCAL SCENE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN STANTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hopes for black sea bass are rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
Juvenile giant black sea bass are making appearances again. 
</P>
<P>
The fish were in danger of extinction until the state Department of Fish and 
Game put them on the prohibited keeper list in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Not a day passes but that someone on a party boat catches a bass and releases 
it. 
</P>
<P>
When these fish come to the surface in a bloated condition and are unable to 
submerge, there is a safe method to deflate them. The fish suffer from bloating 
of the gas bladder. Fish and Game personnel have deflated bloated rockfish 
successfully during tag and release programs. 
</P>
<P>
Anglers on private boats who hook black sea bass can penetrate the skin just 
behind the pectoral fin with a thin blade. The gas will be removed and the fish 
can submerge unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
These fish can grow to 500 pounds and live 70 years if they can evade a hook. 
</P>
<P>
There could be a full return to fishing these giants if the small ones are 
returned to sea. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Gregory of Fish and Game said fishermen should remember the survival of 
the sea bass or any undersized fish is an important factor to the fishing of 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
The King Harbor Marlin Club held its 16th annual awards banquet Saturday night. 
A club record was set in 1989 when club anglers caught 40 marlin, releasing and 
tagging 28. 
</P>
<P>
Trophy winners were Jerry Austin for largest marlin, Ray Hawkes for first 
albacore and Stan Austin for junior-member award. 
</P>
<P>
A special award went to Syd Whitaker for catching a 6-pound, 4-ounce halibut 
using two-pound test line. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Klein, 31, the 1989 bass angler of the year, has won $300,000 fishing for 
bass. 
</P>
<P>
Klein, from Montgomery, Tex., has been called the "Fishing Professor" because 
of his analytical approach to the sport. 
</P>
<P>
While most anglers have a special technique -- spinner baits, flippin, etc. -- 
Klein has adapted a number of techniques into his game plan. He has gained a 
reputation as a proponent of flippin. He has proven he can catch bass on deep, 
clear lakes as well using plastic worms and grubs as part of his arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
He has been a "bassmaster" finalist seven times. 
</P>
<P>
Klein will be sharing techniques with participants in a bass institute at El 
Camino College on Saturday and Sunday. For reservations and information call 
(213) 715-3116.

ROOKIES SPRING INTO SPOTLIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
JUNIOR COLLEGES: CANYONS AND SIX OTHER SCHOOLS WILL OPEN THEIR SEASONS TODAY 
SPORTING HIGH HOPES DESPITE MANY FIRST-YEAR PLAYERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Although today is Groundhog Day, the more reliable sign of the approaching 
spring could be the gopher balls that will be popping into the sky around 
Valley-area junior college baseball fields. 
</P>
<P>
While the groundhog has yet to deliver a verdict on the advent of spring, local 
junior college teams will ring out winter with the crack of bats and slap of 
gloves when all seven teams open their seasons today. 
</P>
<P>
In 2 p.m. nonconference games, Mission will play at Antelope Valley, Saddleback 
will play at Moorpark, and East Los Angeles will play at Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, three Valley-area teams will compete in the Foothill tournament, 
co-sponsored by Glendale and Citrus. Glendale will play Riverside at 2 p.m. and 
College of the Canyons will play Ventura at 10 a.m., both at Stengel Field in 
Glendale; and Valley will meet defending state champion Cerritos in a 10 a.m. 
game at Citrus. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, every local coach is approaching the season optimistically, 
but, until proven otherwise, Canyons remains the king of Valley-area junior 
college baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Three-time state champion during the 1980s, Canyons (24-13, 16-4 in the Western 
State Conference last season) shared the WSC title with Ventura and will field 
a youthful lineup in another bid for both titles. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a little different than any Canyons teams of the past," said Coach Len 
Mohney, who has 24 freshmen on his 33-man roster. "We're going to have to pitch 
and play defense. We're going to struggle to score runs. Our pitching is 
unproven, but it's good." Redshirt sophomore pitcher Travis Regnolds returns 
after spending a year on the sidelines because of elbow surgery. Regnolds, a 
right-hander, had a 5-2 record for a 32-8 Canyons team in 1988. Sophomore Lance 
Gibson (3-1 and three saves), a member of the Woodland Hills West American 
Legion national championship team, has been moved from the bullpen to the 
rotation. 
</P>
<P>
Mohney estimated that he will start six or seven freshmen, but sophomore 
catcher Robert Trujillo returns as does left fielder Gary Morgan, who hit .430 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
Like Canyons, Mission has a lot of inexperience, but the similarity ends there. 
Mission (10-23, 8-12, third in the Southern California Athletic Conference) has 
never made the state playoffs and does not even have a home field. The Free 
Spirit play their home games at Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"We are greatly improved over last year; we have some legitimate junior college 
players this year at every position," Mission Coach John Klitsner said. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore right-hander Jose Garcia (7-8, 3.65) was a first-team All-SCAC pick 
last season. First baseman John Kukawski (.343) is one of the few other 
veterans for Mission, which has 22 freshmen out of 26 players. 
</P>
<P>
It is the nature of junior college baseball teams to have an abundance of 
rookies, but Moorpark and Pierce also have rookie coaches, at least in terms of 
college coaching. After a highly successful career at Chatsworth High, Bob 
Lofrano joins Bob Lyons as a co-coach at Pierce, and Ken Wagner has moved up to 
Moorpark after 20 years at Camarillo High (eight as head coach). 
</P>
<P>
Lofrano brought freshman shortstop Vince Simili with him from Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had a plus right now, it would be our hitting," Lofrano said. "We're 
basically a good average team in terms of making contact and putting the ball 
in play. I think our pitching right now is average and improving." 
</P>
<P>
Lofrano calls sophomore right-hander Chris Murphy the ace. 
</P>
<P>
Shortstop Danny Smith and third baseman Darren Furlong are returning starters 
for Moorpark (20-14, 9-8, fourth in the WSC). 
</P>
<P>
Steve Biggs, a freshman right-hander from Camarillo, began the school year on 
scholarship at Cal but transferred to Moorpark during semester break, Wagner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"He is real talented. I hope that pitching is going to be our strong point," 
Wagner said. "There was some time to recruit, and we got some good kids in." 
</P>
<P>
Valley has that rarest of junior college athletic commodities -- experience. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not very deep, but the starting nine guys are very experienced," Coach 
Chris Johnson said. "That's really where I feel most comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
Valley (29-12-1) welcomes back three members of the All-WSC second team: 
designated-hitter Mark Cavarretta (.390), third baseman John Stephens (.350) 
and right-handed pitcher Wayne Schull (4-2). First baseman E. J. Pape hit nine 
homers last season. 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley Coach Frank Blua will build his team around a pair of veteran 
hitters, sophomores Jim Estes and Steve Lasagna, but Antelope Valley (9-23, 
5-16 in the Foothill Conference) will need to improve on an 8.26 team 
earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
A first-team, all-conference outfielder, Estes led the team in batting, .367; 
runs batted in, 31; stolen bases, 10; and tied for the lead in home runs, six. 
Catcher Lasagna hit .300 with four home runs and 21 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
"We can put together some decent power," Blua said. "We are guardedly 
optimistic, obviously, after last year." 
</P>
<P>
A trio of All-WSC players provide good power for Glendale (16-20, 8-12). Center 
fielder John Bojanac hit eight home runs, and first baseman Art Chute hit six. 
Both were selected first-team all conference. Third baseman Paul Hugasian (five 
home runs) played shortstop last season. 
</P>
<P>
"Defensively, we've shown signs of brilliance, but we've also been 
inconsistent," Glendale Coach Steve Coots said.

The agent for Charger wide receiver Jamie Holland is hoping today is the day 
his client is set free. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Feldman said Thursday he hopes Holland is not on a list, to be released 
this morning, of 37 Charger players to be protected under the Plan B free-agent 
system. 
</P>
<P>
If Holland is not on it, he will be an unrestricted free agent allowed to 
negotiate with any of the other 27 NFL teams. 
</P>
<P>
Holland, whose three-year contract with the Chargers expired Thursday, made 
$180,000 last season, according to figures from the NFL Players Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"If they let him go, I know we'll get a much better deal," Feldman said from 
Indianapolis, where he is attending a workout of college players. "It will be a 
nice increase." 
</P>
<P>
The average salary of players signed in 1989, the first year of Plan B, 
increased 40.3% to $198,000, according to the NFL Management Council. In 
addition, players received an average signing bonus of $35,000. 
</P>
<P>
As with all of the players they do not protect, the Chargers would not be 
allowed to deal with Holland again until April 1. But Feldman said he did not 
expect that Holland would still be available anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"Another team will take him," Feldman said. "I'm sure of that." 
</P>
<P>
Holland, a 1987 seventh-round draft choice from Ohio State, has caught 71 
passes for 1,010 yards and one touchdown in three seasons. Last season, he was 
fourth on the team with 26 catches for 336 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Holland is one of 22 Chargers whose contracts expired Thursday. General Manager 
Bobby Beathard has declined to discuss specifics but has said that some of 
those 22 would be left unprotected. He also has said the unprotected group 
would not include quarterback Jim McMahon, whose contract paid him $800,000 
last season, making him the highest-paid Charger. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers hold the rights to 56 players. Two -- running backs Gary Anderson 
(1989 holdout) and Napoleon McCallum (military) -- are exempt from Plan B 
consideration, leaving 17 players who have been left unprotected.

SDSU HOPES TO OFFSET SHORTFALL IN FOOTBALL

The San Diego State athletic department fell $151,000 short of anticipated 
football ticket sales revenue last season but expects to make up much of the 
difference from increased revenue and savings in other areas, the department 
reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The department received approximately $1.27 million from football ticket sales, 
less than the department budgeted but more than officials said they feared they 
might raise before they launched a late-season plea for public support. 
</P>
<P>
The department reported it expects to make up much of the lost revenue with a 
slight increase in basketball ticket sales, better-than-expected revenue 
sharing of the football bowl receipts with other Western Athletic Conference 
members and a reduction, caused by attrition, in the amount spent on athletic 
scholarships, primarily in football and women's basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Athletic Director Fred Miller said the department also expected to realize a 
savings of $34,000 from other budget reductions and to raise $100,000 in the 
first five months of its marketing venture with the Murrieta Hot Springs Resort 
in Temecula. The venture provides for the resort to make a donation to the 
department fund-raising effort with the purchase of a 30-day package. Miller 
said these measures should allow the department to balance its 1989-90 budget 
of $4.76 million. 
</P>
<P>
The report was made at a regular meeting of the Intercollegiate Athletic 
Authority, the advisory board that oversees the department. The board approved 
a modified department budget for the 1989-90 fiscal year, incorporating the 
changes.

PEOPLE: MURPHY TO STEP DOWN AS CAP CITIES-ABC CHIEF

<TEXT>
<P>
The chairman and chief executive of Capital Cities-ABC Inc., Thomas S. Murphy, 
plans to step down as CEO on June 1 and will recommend that President Daniel B. 
Burke succeed him. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy, who will stay on as chairman, and Burke have worked together at the 
giant media company for nearly 30 years and it had been expected that Murphy 
would turn the chief executive post over to Burke at some point. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy turns 65 on May 31. Burke turns 61 on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not a surprise," said one securities analyst who spoke on condition 
that he not be identified. "Burke has appeared with Murphy at every corporate 
presentation Murphy has made over the past 10 years. They always refer to each 
other as partners." 
</P>
<P>
The analyst said he did not expect any change of direction at Capital 
Cities-ABC if the board approves the recommendation, as is expected. The next 
board meeting is in March. 
</P>
<P>
In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Capital Cities-ABC rose 37 1/2 cents 
a share to $515.37 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
The company owns the ABC Television Network, eight television stations, six 
radio networks, 21 radio stations and has publishing interests.

McGraw-Hill Inc.: The New York publishing company posted 1989 earnings of $47.8 
million, down sharply from $185.5 million the previous year. The company said 
it took an unusual charge of $152 million due to writedowns associated with 
non-performing assets and the shutdown of General Books and reserves for 
severance payments for staff reductions of more than 1,000 full-time positions. 
Revenue for 1989 increased 6.9% to $1.8 billion.

discontinued operations. Results for 1989 included a gain on the divestiture of 
Marriott's airline catering operations, restructuring charges and writeoffs 
from continuing operations. For the fourth quarter, net income was $1 million, 
compared to $65 million in 1988, on sales of $2.5 billion, up 19% from the 
restated 1988 results.

HORSZOWSKI: AT 97, A PIANIST'S PIANIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mieczyslaw Horszowski, who played an astonishing recital at the Dorothy 
Chandler Pavilion on Wednesday, has always been a pianist's pianist. 
</P>
<P>
He never courted a mass audience. Flash and fuss were never his specialties. 
For him, the music came first. 
</P>
<P>
While other keyboard heroes zealously cranked public-relations machines, 
Horszowski went about his more serious business with gentle, almost selfless 
determination. While his rivals embarked on vast international tours -- and on 
ego trips that reached even farther -- Horszowski concentrated on basics. 
</P>
<P>
He stayed fairly close to the East Coast, having moved to New York in 1940. He 
taught a long parade of accomplished students. He played chamber music, often 
with the likes of Casals and Szigeti. 
</P>
<P>
He demonstrated a rare concern for such old-fashioned values as classical 
purity and interpretive integrity. Although his playing always revealed a 
striking independent character, he steadfastly avoided the traps of 
exaggeration and distortion. 
</P>
<P>
He offered enlightened surveys, often in unglamorous locales, of the complete 
sonata repertory of Mozart, and he championed the late keyboard output of 
Beethoven. As the decades passed, he developed a fiercely devoted following. 
His name gradually became a household word -- but only in the homes of 
connoisseurs. 
</P>
<P>
Logic would suggest that Horszowski should have stopped playing in public a 
long time ago. Fortunately, art is not always dictated by anything so mundane 
as logic. 
</P>
<P>
At the age of 97, he is still venturing strenuous recitals, without apology. He 
is still giving object lessons in style, in sensitivity and in the 
communicative force of simplicity. 
</P>
<P>
It would be silly to pretend that his fingers can manage all the things today 
that came so easily when he was a boy of 87. It would be a disservice to the 
achievements of Horszowski in his prime to claim that his technique at twilight 
matches that of high noon. 
</P>
<P>
Any pedant could cite the smudged phrases, the lapses of concentration or the 
linear approximations that materialized from time to time during his 2-hour 
marathon at the Music Center. One had a right to expect some lapses. Actually, 
there were far fewer than one had a right to expect. 
</P>
<P>
Horszowski began the evening crisply, and a bit stiffly, with Bach's French 
Suite, No. 6 (BWV 817). Without worrying much about the niceties of Baroque 
scholarship -- that is a problem for another generation -- he stressed 
universal virtues: contrapuntal clarity, rhythmic propulsion and abiding poise. 
</P>
<P>
In Beethoven's F-major Sonata, Opus 10, No. 2, he introduced the contrast of 
expressive freedom. Without a hint of emotional indulgence, he allowed the 
phrases to breathe with poignant fluidity. 
</P>
<P>
After intermission he explored some character pieces of Schumann -- the 
"Arabeske," Opus 18, and the "Papillons," Opus 2 -- painting with brisk 
strokes, muted colors and reasonably bold accents. In four Chopin miniatures -- 
culminating in the festive, seldom-performed Bolero, Opus 19 -- Horszowski 
dealt in rhapsodic images that never cloyed. He made the poetry sound as 
natural as casual conversation. 
</P>
<P>
At encore time, he generously volunteered the inevitable "Traumerei," dreamy 
indeed, plus Chopin's F-minor Etude, Opus 25, No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
For once, the instant standing-ovation was justified.

"Don Quixote," with the company's Leanne Benjamin. 
</P>
<P>
Also appearing from the National Ballet will be renowned Canadian-born

HOSKINS AND WASHINGTON: BUDDIES WITH A LOT OF 'HEART' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
High concepts can be like badly wired explosives. They're supposed to be the 
engines driving a movie up into the skies, but sometimes they're more like 
bombs ticking away in the hold. Luckily, "Heart Condition" (citywide), slips 
out of most of the traps built into its own gimmick: a goofy-sounding notion 
about a racist haunted by his black heart transplant donor. 
</P>
<P>
This buddy-from-beyond marketing hook may seem like an albatross, but the stars 
-- Bob Hoskins as Jack Moony and Denzel Washington as ghost Napoleon Stone -- 
pry it loose. Separately, they've always been scene-stealers. Together, they're 
practically a syndicate. 
</P>
<P>
In the film, Hoskins' Moony is a hot-tempered, bigoted cop. Felled by a heart 
attack after a lifetime of junk food, tantrums and dangerous exertions, he's 
given the transplanted pump of Washington's Stone, an Armani-suited slickster 
of a lawyer who used to defend the hookers Hoskins collared. Moony gets more 
than his heart. The ghost of Stone suddenly appears before him -- but nobody 
else -- admonishing him away from greasy cheeseburgers, giving him a sartorial 
make-over, guiding his love life, educating him in cool and couth, transforming 
him from bigot to buddy and, finally, teaming up with him to track down Stone's 
own killer. 
</P>
<P>
Like most male-bonding action movies, "Heart Condition" suggests that these 
feuding comrades make up one integrated personality. Here, they're even in love 
with the same woman: Chloe Webb as a hooker-in-distress, Crystal. And they have 
the same nemesis, Jeffrey Meek as Graham, Crystal's boss, a sleek pimp who 
wants no spots on his Maserati. 
</P>
<P>
The premise may seem sappy or dubious to the end, but the teamwork clicks. 
Hoskins is a titan of frustration, rage and lightly leashed passion. Like Danny 
DeVito, he's a little stocky guy with gigantic emotions tearing their way loose 
-- and when directors fling him into a scene, he's like a Birmingham grenade 
with the pin pulled. Scenes revolve around him; worlds quiver around him. 
Washington, on the other hand, has such a silky touch -- even when he's playing 
psychopaths or hard guys -- that he seems to iron out all the kinks in the air. 
Washington cools everything out. He's a smoothie and Hoskins is a tornado. 
</P>
<P>
In "Heart Condition," writer-director James Parriott plays up these contrasts. 
He keeps comically colliding the densely detailed worlds of the twosome: the 
amiable, cat-littered mess in which Moony lives and the pricey Century City 
environs and chichi hangouts of Stone. And there's such sly mischief and high 
class hip in Washington's performance that we can see why he enrages Moony; the 
cop's bigotry is also permeated with class jealousy. 
</P>
<P>
A TV hyphenate making his feature debut, Parriott knows how to keep us from 
switching the channel. There's a "Chinatown"-style scandal as the plot motor: 
the cocaine-overdose death of a reactionary U.S. senator at a Graham orgy. And 
the movie races along from its near-artsy, opening -- quick fragments of the 
orgy and drug overdose -- into a thick fog of danger, L.A. swank and buddyhood. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout, "Heart" seems crammed with talent. Arthur Albert's cinematography 
catches a poisonous quality in the L.A. sunlight. The score, by Patrick 
Leonard, who sometimes produces and writes for Madonna, has a tricky, seductive 
ambiance; the jazzier stretches almost sound like Keith Jarrett. Webb, Meek, 
Ray Baker, Ja'net Dubois -- in a telling scene as Stone's disapproving mama -- 
and the others make up a tangy ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
The movie's only major problem is its formula shtick and that silly premise: 
Archie Bunker and his talking black heart. The joke is too obvious and the key 
scene, the rapprochement between Stone and Moony, lacks punch. "Heart" also 
probably errs in having Moony, throughout, converse so openly with his 
invisible partner. Wouldn't a savvy streetwise cop try to hide these spooky 
conversations more? Hoskins, last seen battling Toons in "Who Framed Roger 
Rabbit," is peerless at playing with actors who aren't there -- but there are 
too many cheap laughs here at his expense. 
</P>
<P>
Still, in many ways, "Heart" (rated R for sex, violence and language) is in the 
right place. Buddy movies usually succeed on chemistry -- and Hoskins and 
Washington have more of it here than they need or can use. They're able to pull 
this movie right off its hook and let it fly.

OLIVIER FAREWELL IN 'WAR REQUIEM' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Great Britain entered World War I with such widespread naive optimism and 
experienced such terrible losses on such a personal level that it's the ideal 
conflict with which to express anti-war protest. 
</P>
<P>
In 1962, Benjamin Britten composed an oratorio, based on the poetry of World 
War I soldier Wilfred Owen, to commemorate the new Coventry Cathedral, which 
had been bombed beyond restoration during World War II. "War Requiem" has now 
become a remarkably evocative and powerful film in which England's premier 
experimentalist, Derek Jarman, has created a flow of images involving tableaux 
and intercut with archival material to accompany the soaring, majestic 
oratorio. 
</P>
<P>
("War Requiem" launches the Monica 4-Plex's new Monica Premiere Showcase 
policy, which means that from now on one of the Santa Monica theater's four 
screens will be devoted exclusively to limited engagements of specialized 
films.) 
</P>
<P>
"War Requiem" opens with a World War I veteran (Laurence Olivier, in an elegiac 
and most fitting screen farewell after six decades on screen) being wheeled in 
his chair outside a vast, boarded-up Victorian hospital complex. As his nurse 
pins a row of medals to his sweater, the old soldier, with an expression of 
infinite sadness, commences remembering long-ago battles. In essence, we're 
seeing the film -- and therefore, World War I -- through Lord Olivier's haunted 
eyes. (At the very beginning of the picture, we hear on the sound track Olivier 
reciting Owen's "Strange Meeting.") 
</P>
<P>
What follows are meticulously re-created glimpses of life in a training camp, 
in the trenches and in a field hospital, all punctuated with clips of actual 
wartime footage. What emerges is a collective portrait of the British people at 
their most solicitous, selfless and quietly heroic. Gradually, three principal 
figures emerge: the dark-haired, mustached Poet -- i.e., Owen -- (Nathaniel 
Parker), the Unknown Soldier (ginger-haired Owen Teale) representative of the 
dead soldiers celebrated in Owen's "Anthem for Doomed Youth," and the Nurse 
(Tilda Swinton). 
</P>
<P>
Gradually, too, Christian rituals evolve in which both the Poet -- Owen was 
killed at age 25 one week before Armistice -- and the Unknown Soldier are 
equated with the sacrifice of Christ. Parker and Teale serve largely as icons 
of stalwart Britishers, but it falls to Swinton, in some superb moments of 
silent acting, to express such capitalized emotions as Grief and Desire. 
</P>
<P>
One of Jarman's most inspired touches was to move forward to the present in 
depicting death in battle via film clips. In another context, these clips might 
well be unbearable, so unsparing are they, but here they are presented with a 
sense of discretion and dignity that give full force to Jarman's protest 
against war. "War Requiem" and its predecessor, "The Last of England," an 
apocalyptic, surreal vision of Britain after the fall of government, reflect a 
deep love of country and its people on the part of Jarman. They also are 
evidence of a new maturity in a one-time enfant terrible who once was more 
likely to drive you up the wall -- or up the aisle -- than to move you with his 
commanding sense of the visual.

CHARLES DENNIS MAKES L.A. DEBUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New York performance artist Charles Dennis made his first Los Angeles 
appearance with two contrasting solos of differing impact Wednesday at Highways 
in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
His "cityanimal" chronicles a day in the life of an urban dweller, the 
cityanimal. 
</P>
<P>
It is divided into halves, each beginning with the same taped speech of the 
creature's need to go out after being cooped up in his apartment all day. 
Venturing out, however, brings frustration in sexual pursuit and encounters 
with violence, real or implicit. Ultimately, he confesses to thriving on the 
danger. Well, good for him. But what does that do for anybody else? 
</P>
<P>
A lean, compact dancer, Dennis worked in graceful, vigorous, demented spurts of 
tai chi and karate movements. But the narrative had many holes and dead spots, 
and the character never established any emotional connection with the audience. 
</P>
<P>
More successful was Dennis' "2 X 2 X 4," in which he played a serious version 
of kids' games with building blocks (14 2x4's) -- cradling them, cuddling them, 
carrying them; pretending they're snowshoes, surfboards or ski poles; hoping 
from one to another as if crossing ice floes on a river; putting them together 
to form V shapes, a wall or a fort. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the blocks fell unintentionally; more often, Dennis kicked apart his 
own constructions, suggesting cycles of building and destruction. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly a serious tone was introduced by juxtaposing bare skin (Dennis was 
shirtless) with hard wood textures. But the imaginative play held interest 
longer than did metaphoric implications. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis will repeat the program tonight.CHRIS PASLES

STAGE BEAT: 'WEST SIDE STORY' AT GOLDEN; 'WORSHIP' AT GROUNDLINGS; 'PLANET' AT 
HIGHWAYS; 'EARTHERS' AT THEATER 6470; 'W(HOLES)' AT THEATRE/THEATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"West Side Story" may have lost its thematic edge since the Jets and Sharks 
exploded on Broadway in 1957, but the Golden Theatre production in Burbank is a 
zestful reminder of how Jerome Robbins advanced the art of musical theater 
dance in the original. 
</P>
<P>
Under the fine tuning of director-choreographer Gregory Scott Young, the cast 
darts, glides and hoofs with a tempo that catches the finger snap of big, ugly 
Gotham. 
</P>
<P>
Time has diminished Arthur Laurents' "Romeo and Juliet"-indebted book, but this 
show, with percussive propulsion from a live three-piece band, brings back 
Leonard Bernstein's tingling music. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins' throbbing choreography made dance as important as the score in this 
racially-charged teen gang story about rival turf, and the performers at the 
Golden Theatre turn a cramped stage into a realm of dynamic motion. 
</P>
<P>
The leads in the 24-member company convey ardor and street credibility. Ernie 
Marchain Jr.'s Tony and Carrie Jachnuk's impassioned Maria are vocally splendid 
and endearing. Macho Mark McCandless and wiry Bill Benson (check out the 
latter's swoopy '50s hairstyle) heat up the famous "rumble" scene. 
</P>
<P>
But for sheer impact, the most electric performer is Dana Marley, as the 
spitfire second banana. 
</P>
<P>
 The wraparound and multilevel set design by Melanie Singleton, with its trash 
cans and mannequins, is functional and realistic. 
</P>
<P>
At 139 N. San Fernando Road, Burbank, Thursdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m.; 
Saturdays, 2 p.m.; Sundays, 7 p.m., through Feb. 25. Tickets: $10-$15; (818) 
841-9921. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Worship the Groundling' 
</P>
<P>
Last year, The Groundlings skewered L.A. topics, and in the newest show, 
"Worship the Groundling You Walk On," the comedy troupe's grounders and fly 
balls target movie lines, Barbie dolls, agent 007, home shopping, a feminist 
therapy group and dating rituals of assorted stripes. 
</P>
<P>
The company continues to prosper with a mix of rehearsed sketches and 
audience-suggested improv. The latter is the surest evidence of the actors' 
resources, as honed by director William Schreiner. 
</P>
<P>
The show is funny (not in every sketch but most of the time) because the actors 
possess their characters. The lines aren't howlers nor are the situations 
necessarily fresh (meeting future in-laws, for example). But the characters are 
sharply angled, like vanity mirrors. 
</P>
<P>
"Date Sketch" with the loping Steve Hibbert and the sexually aggressive Julia 
Sweeney is a quick gem. Sweeney, who works possibly a notch beyond everyone 
else, can segue to a hard luck wallflower with ease. The women are not afraid 
to look horrible, and they utilize an array of wigs to effect their masks. 
</P>
<P>
"Barbie" is risibly naughty, with Mindy Sterling and Heather Morgan in a toy 
store playing lesbian games with Barbie. Red-headed Patrick Bristow is 
consistently sharp, especially in the improvs. 
</P>
<P>
One first-act sketch, however, "Essential Herbs," makes fun of Chinese accents 
and should be scrapped. It's egregious. The first act needs tightening anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 At 7307 Melrose Ave., Fridays at 8 p.m., Saturdays at 8 p.m. and 10 p.m., 
indefinitely. Tickets: $12.50-$17.50; (213) 934-9700. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Forbidden Planet' 
</P>
<P>
The work at Highways, Santa Monica's multicultural performance space, is often 
pushy and innovative. But L.A. multimedia artist John Goss' "Forbidden Planet" 
only partially realizes its subtitled intention to probe "sex and intimacy in 
the age of AIDS and telecommunications." 
</P>
<P>
That's a humongous target and Goss' wit, such as framing his subversive odyssey 
through the Anne Francis character from the 1956 sci-fi film, "Forbidden 
Planet," is a clever touch. Here, she's an alien who discovers that Earth is 
the forbidden planet and she sets to work operating a global phone sex network 
to achieve global climax. 
</P>
<P>
It's a funny and -- if you've been following the 976 numbers -- a portentous 
theme. In fact, Goss uses telephone imagery in practically every scene of his 
episodic work, which culminates in "Telecumference," tableaux visualized in a 
sublime video image of interfacing telephone lines spreading electronic passion 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
Technically, Goss' brave new world, with five actors, slashing light, digital 
sound and video projections, is an ambitious production. But its sociopolitical 
statement is seldom involving. Too much of the work is arcane, repetitive and 
fragmented. And the actress playing the Francis character is so weak vocally 
you struggle to focus on her otherwise outrageous lines. 
</P>
<P>
 At 1651 18th St., Santa Monica, concluding tomorrow and Sunday, 8:30 p.m. 
Tickets: $10; (213) 453-1755. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Earthers' 
</P>
<P>
There's another figure from the galaxies trying to help Earthlings in 
"Earthers" by husband-wife playwrighting team Dan Castellaneta and Deb Lacusta. 
Theater 6470's production is notable for the piquant, other-worldly performance 
of Betsy Randle's off-center visitor from outer space. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, there's not much to recommend this subtitled "cosmedy," unfolding in 
an office of carping workers whose frustrations are transformed by the spell 
cast by the squeaky-voice Randle. 
</P>
<P>
She sometimes freezes the action to address the audience in inventive language. 
The stylized set includes painted Day-Glo lines that heighten the work's 
fantasy side. 
</P>
<P>
But the reality side of the play is routine. In the best scene, an unhappy 
shipping clerk (the well-cast Eric Kohner), who wants to be an astronaut, 
rather gets his wish. But most of the piece is devoid of arc and momentum. 
</P>
<P>
Director Jeff Michalski and playwright Castellaneta (of "The Tracey Ullman 
Show" and "The Simpsons" fame) are Second City veterans. That might explain the 
revue-like structure. What should be blithesome and seamless is disjointed. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6470 Santa Monica Blvd., Thursdays through Sundays, 8 p.m., through Feb. 
25. Tickets: $12; (213) 466-1767. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'W(Holes)' 
</P>
<P>
Eric Trules has mellowed as an actor and writer since his evocative one-man hit 
two years ago called "Down . . . But Not Out." His anger, edge and precision 
have faded in his new show, "W(Holes)," at Theatre/Theater. 
</P>
<P>
A program note by Trules reports he survived a life-threatening disease, which 
he said influenced the monologues and dialogues of characters in crisis in 
"W(Holes)." Now, however, his new material is folksy where it needs to be hard, 
personal where it needs objective distance. 
</P>
<P>
Trules has an acting partner this time, Barbara Clay, and she brings a welcome 
counterweight. Directed by Charles G. Davis, they work off a huge spongy divan 
with big holes in it. They alternately empty and fill those (emotional) holes 
with stories dealing with love, sex, fear, mantras, freedom, healing, llamas 
and "the puppet man upstairs on the rocket to the moon." 
</P>
<P>
But Trules' tone is too precious, too sincere for its own good. It's actually a 
therapeutic lecture about shedding our skins, adorned as entertainment. When an 
actor finds Truth, watch out. 
</P>
<P>
 At 1713 Cahuenga Blvd., Saturdays and Sundays, 8 p.m., through Feb. 24. 
Tickets: $10; (213) 285-3874.

HOME TECH / CD CORNER: MAKING THE CASE FOR JOHNNY CASH -- ROCKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Johnny Cash: The Sun Years" wasn't designed by Rhino Records to be Exhibit A 
in the case for Johnny Cash's induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. 
But the newly released CD indirectly serves as one. 
</P>
<P>
One reason frequently cited to explain why the veteran singer has been bypassed 
by Hall of Fame voters since balloting began five years ago is that many voters 
tend to view Cash's primary interest as country music rather than rock. 
</P>
<P>
This perception exists even though he was a label-mate at Sun Records in the 
'50s of -- and often toured with -- four other artists who have been voted into 
the Hall of Fame: Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins and Roy Orbison. 
</P>
<P>
The view also overlooks the fact that country -- along with gospel and blues -- 
played a key role in the development of rock. Two country legends -- Jimmie 
Rodgers and Hank Williams -- have been inducted by the Hall of Fame as 
forefathers (the term given to pre-rock influences). 
</P>
<P>
Cash's music was influenced strongly by the restless blues strains popularized 
by Rodgers and by the rural, emotional purity of Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Cash's key Sun singles -- including "I Walk the Line" and "Folsom 
Prison Blues" -- reflected a tension and a guitar-oriented edge that gave them 
a tougher, more modern pop-rock feel than most of the country records of the 
'50s. Some of the singles -- notably "Big River" and "Home of the Blues" -- 
even ventured effectively into rockabilly. 
</P>
<P>
While the 18 songs featured on the new Rhino package (including all those 
cited) represent Cash's most direct ties to rock, his later Columbia recordings 
were also influential in rock -- both his ambitious concept albums and his 
frequent social comment. Among the Hall of Fame members who have cited Cash as 
an influence: Bob Dylan, Bobby Darin and Ray Charles. 
</P>
<P>
Several of Cash's Columbia albums are already available in CD and an especially 
attractive one is due shortly: a single, budget CD that includes both of Cash's 
live "Folsom Prison" and "San Quentin" prison albums from the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
HALL OF FAME, PART II: Eddie Cochran, who was part of the Hall of Fame's 1987 
induction class, is saluted in an excellent four-disc CD box set that was 
released in Britain by Liberty/EMI and is available as an import in some U.S. 
record shops. The set, which retails for around $48 and is titled "The Eddie 
Cochran Box Set," contains 113 selections -- ranging from the L.A.-based 
performer's early country experiments through some live TV appearances and some 
tracks where he appears simply as a session guitarist. 
</P>
<P>
Cochran had only two Top 20 U.S. hits, "Sittin' in the Balcony" and "Summertime 
Blues," but his music was characterized by an uncommonly appealing sense of 
youthful intensity and desire, and he was an especially big influence in 
Britain, where he died in a 1960 auto crash at age 21. 
</P>
<P>
There are no plans for EMI to release the box set in this country, but the 
label is planning to issue a single, 20-song Cochran CD as part of its 
"Legendary Masters" series on Feb. 26. Other artists who will be featured in 
the series include Rick Nelson, Gary Lewis &amp; the Playboys, Bobby Vee and 
the duo of Shirley and Lee. 
</P>
<P>
HALL OF FAME, PART III: The Kinks, inducted into the Hall of Fame last month, 
are mainly celebrated for the singles and concept albums that were released in 
the '60s by Reprise Records. But the English band also made several noteworthy 
albums in the '70s for RCA Records, including "Muswell Hillbillies." That album 
is one of three of the RCA collections just released in CD by Rhino. The 
others: "Soap Opera" and "Schoolboys in Disgrace."

CAUGHT BETWEEN HARD ROCK, MA MAISON, PACIFICS COPES WELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pacifics is in an awkward situation: under an escalator, a few steps east of 
the Hard Rock Cafe, across the street from the new Ma Maison. Especially that 
last part. As a shopping-mall restaurant (it's in the Beverly Center, though 
you have to enter from the sidewalk), it could seem almost impressive, but the 
other side of the street from Ma Maison is a desperate place for a restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
True to its name, it leans heavily to seafood, starting with an appetizer list 
of decent oyster-bar fare. The crab cocktail, for instance, is not random 
scraps of claw meat mixed with sauce but whole chunks, the sauce served on the 
side. This is a noble way of doing things, even if the crab meat might be a 
little more flavorful. 
</P>
<P>
Pacifics throws clams around with a generous hand. The best dish on the menu is 
probably the linguine in thick cream sauce loaded with clams and garlic. The 
clam chowder, of a floury rather than a creamy texture, is well stocked with 
clams. Pacifics even puts chopped clams into Caesar salad; the clams do add 
something subtle and meaty to the salad, though some people are going to have a 
hard time with the little gray lumps of stuff that look as if they're climbing 
around on the lettuce leaves. 
</P>
<P>
The seafood entrees are mostly straightforward things like broiled swordfish 
sprinkled with paprika on a bed of spinach, though with that one you do get 
French-fried julienned yams (call them shoestring potatoes made from yams). 
Even the dishes on special are likely to be reassuring old favorites, like 
blackened red snapper, that little Southern California Cajun tradition of ours. 
It's not bad as blackened snappers go, in a crunchy crust much heavier on cumin 
than red pepper. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, though, Pacifics gets high on sauces. Chicken New Mexico is chicken 
breast in a rich cream sauce pleasingly flavored with pecans, corn kernels and 
chunks of sweet pepper. Trout Santa Fe is much the same with tomatoes in place 
of pecans. The highly flavored sauce is delicious, but is that really a trout 
under it? Who can tell? 
</P>
<P>
And sometimes it gets maybe a little too high on sauces. Scallops Cho-Cho San 
come in a very exotic mixture of white wine, cilantro and plum sauce, plus 
paddy mushrooms and broccoli. The aroma is oddly reminiscent of an old Madeira 
wine mixed with cilantro, and a bit sweet in the bargain. I guess I like it, 
though I can't think what I'd like it on. Not scallops, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
And Pacifics has a very mistaken idea that there is a special affinity between 
seafood and orange juice. It serves excellent barbecued shrimp sprinkled with 
hot paprika, but they come with a pilaf mawkishly dashed with orange juice and 
a most absurd barbecue sauce that tastes like ketchup plus orange juice. Alas, 
the restaurant is about to introduce a new menu, which they boast will contain 
yet more orange sauces and even some tangerine sauces, not to mention 
black-bean sauces -- which sound ominous in their own right. 
</P>
<P>
It's odd that Pacifics doesn't seem to have any orange desserts. Mostly the 
dessert list is a selection of semi-familiar pastries: cakes and tarts and that 
box thing made of slabs of chocolate with more chocolate stuff inside. The 
caramel pecan basket, though, is unusual and quite good, a basket of pecans 
lined with chocolate on the inside, filled with vanilla Bavarian cream and 
strawberries. It looks homely but the flavors and the textural contrast are a 
great success. 
</P>
<P>
Pacifics is in an awkward situation, but aren't we all sometimes? I'll say this 
much: If I don't have the money for Ma Maison or the right attitude for the 
Hard Rock and I'm on the sidewalk outside the Beverly Center, it's where I'm 
going for clam linguine, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacifics, 8500 Beverly Blvd., Los Angeles. (213) 652-1974. Open for lunch and 
dinner seven days. Parking in Beverly Center. Wine and beer. American Express,

TRAFFIC ENDANGERS STATE'S FUTURE, 2 GROUPS WARN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Traffic congestion strangling California freeways may become the most important 
environmental and economic issue of the decade, according to two very different 
groups, the Sierra Club and the more conservative Californians for Better 
Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
In its annual "Green State of the State" report released today, the Sierra Club 
warned that, unless dramatic changes are made in California's transportation 
system, the state is headed for worsening traffic congestion and environmental 
catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
"Transportation is California's environmental issue of the decade," the club 
contended, and the masses of cars carrying only the driver are what "fuel the 
problems of smog, global warming, oil spills and contamination." 
</P>
<P>
Putting the traffic problems in economic terms, Californians for Better 
Transportation reported that the rapidly increasing congestion on the state's 
freeways and urban streets already costs motorists $17 billion a year in lost 
time, increased fuel and car repair costs. 
</P>
<P>
"Transportation may be the economic issue of the '90s," said Ray Remy, a 
spokesman for the highway lobby group and president of the Los Angeles Area 
Chamber of Commerce. "If we can't move goods and people, that is only going to 
have increasing economic consequences." 
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Club and Californians for Better Transportation strongly support the 
complex gasoline tax measure that will be on the June ballot. The proposition 
would allow the state to raise $18 billion over the next 15 years to fight 
congestion and to come up with mass transit alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere is the problem more acute than in Southern California. Los Angeles 
leads the nation in every negative traffic indicator, according to a third new 
traffic study. No other big city relies so heavily on already congested 
freeways and urban streets to move people and goods, according to the study by 
Texas A&amp;M University transportation experts. 
</P>
<P>
The nut of the problem is that transportation expenditures have not kept pace 
with California's rapid population growth. As a result, traffic in urban areas 
such as Southern California and San Francisco is grinding to a halt. California 
now is last among states in highway spending per mile, and funds for rapid 
transit projects have been cut back in the past decade, critics say. 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, traffic has increased by 55% since 1980 and now stands at 241 
billion vehicle-miles a year, but the miles of new road construction have 
increased less than 2% in the same period. Two-thirds of the existing roads are 
in "fair to very poor condition," and the cost of bringing them up to good 
standards is estimated at $8.6 billion, according to Californians for Better 
Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Club report -- called "Heading the Wrong Way: Redirecting 
California's Failed Transportation Policy" -- sharply criticized government at 
all levels over the past quarter-century, contending that politicians have 
failed to fund, build and maintain a modern transportation system. 
</P>
<P>
The environmentalists take dead aim at those developers and government agencies 
that have carved up rural areas, creating urban sprawl that in turn puts more 
traffic on already overburdened freeways and roads. The new highways and 
freeways that have followed such developments have been built at public expense 
for private gain without thought to environmental damage, the club charged. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cars Blamed 
</P>
<P>
"In Los Angeles, an astonishing two-thirds of the urban space is dedicated to 
transportation," the club's experts reported. They said that cars account for 
more than half the state's urban air pollution and that highway expansion 
projects damage or destroy wildlife habitats. 
</P>
<P>
"How we solve the problems created by the state's worsening transportation 
system is the most important environmental decision California will make going 
into the 21st Century," the Sierra Club concluded. The club is demanding that 
more emphasis be put on getting drivers to car-pool or ride-share and that more 
effort be put into developing urban mass transit. 
</P>
<P>
While the Sierra Club and Californians for Better Transportation are very 
different groups -- the one representing environmentalists, the other a 
coalition of highway user groups -- their studies have brought them to many of 
the same conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
"Traffic congestion is threatening to shut down the state's road and highway 
system," said Jack Maltester, president of Californians for Better 
Transportation. And the results have a direct impact not only on the movement 
of goods and services, but on the motorist's pocketbook. 
</P>
<P>
The highway group's report found that by 1988 congestion had added 20 minutes 
to the average commuter's drive time, and that figure is expected to double or 
triple in the next 10 years if nothing is done. The average motorist pays 
$1,200 a year because of the delays, added fuel and repair costs, the report 
stated. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line, Maltester said, is that the state's motorists are "paying a 
premium to drive on rough, congested roads." 
</P>
<P>
Both of these reports have begun to stir some reaction in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether the problems are described in environmental or the economic terms, how 
we solve the transportation nightmare is going to say a lot about the quality 
of life in Los Angeles over the next 10 years," Assemblyman Richard Katz 
(D-Sylmar) said. 
</P>
<P>
As chairman of the Assembly Transportation Committee, Katz has attacked the 
"build-and-boom mentality" that has allowed urban sprawl without mitigating the 
impact of such development on transportation systems and the environment. 
</P>
<P>
Katz also helped fashion a compromise gas tax measure that will go to the 
voters in June. The proposition would lift the spending restrictions imposed by 
the "Gann initiative," allowing the state to raise $18 billion for 
transportation development. 
</P>
<P>
The compromise includes a requirement that local governments develop 
"congestion management plans" proposed by Katz. These plans would link urban 
development to the need for adequate transportation systems to move the 
increased population, a regulation that is being strongly opposed by the 
building industry. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Sierra Club and Californians for Better Transportation are supporting 
the measure in the June election, provided congestion management requirements 
are included. And, for the first time, the highway lobby group strongly 
supports the increased development of rail and other forms of mass transit to 
help relieve freeway congestion.

MOST BASES ON HIT LIST LIE IN DEMOCRAT AREAS

<TEXT>
<P>
When Defense Secretary Dick Cheney unveiled a new proposal this week for 
closing 43 military facilities and cutting back scores of others, congressional 
Democrats cried foul. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration was disproportionately targeting installations in 
Democratic congressional districts, they said. They predicted that the 
Administration would hold the hit list over the heads of congressional 
Democrats like a club if they deviated substantially from President Bush's 
defense budget. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney dismissed the complaints. But a statistical analysis of the 
Administration proposal shows that whether intentionally or not, the hit list 
would hit Democratic districts far harder than Republican ones. Cheney himself 
acknowledged that the list gives the President enormous leverage over 
individual congressmen in the coming budget battle. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 21 bases on Cheney's list that are large enough to have major economic 
impact on their locales, 19 are in Democratic congressional districts. That 
prompted Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.) to call the list an "unacceptable" 
and "partisan" document in which "Democratic districts are hit and Republican 
districts get off scot-free." 
</P>
<P>
Cheney insists his plan reflects purely military judgments. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't come down and say, 'Hit Democrats or hit liberal Democrats and not 
conservative Democrats,' " Cheney told reporters. "If you look at the list, 
you'll find that it is in fact the best judgment of the (military) services of 
what (their) requirements are." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he has conceded the political power of his base-closing list. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a real test for Congress," he said. "We've got a lot of people up 
there who want to cut the defense budget, and here's a very simple way to do 
it. Either they will remove roadblocks to essential readjustment . . . of our 
base structure, or they aren't really serious about cutting the defense 
budget." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Trap in Wait? 
</P>
<P>
Prominent Democrats recognize the trap that lies in wait. 
</P>
<P>
"The way they handled it certainly has every appearance of political motives," 
said John C. White, former Democratic national chairman. "It says, 'Look guys, 
you're going to have to deal with us this year.' First it comes out of the 
blue, it's laid on the table and then the defense secretary says there's no 
final decision yet. It looks like a trial balloon, that it may be negotiable" 
if a lawmaker has something to offer in return. 
</P>
<P>
No one in the Administration will acknowledge a political motive. A member of a 
commission that successfully recommended 86 defense facilities for closure in 
1986 said there is no way to prove one. 
</P>
<P>
"When we finished our recommendations, we sat back . . . and talked about how 
you prove politics," one commission member said. "We decided you can't do it. 
You just can't do it." 
</P>
<P>
That bipartisan commission prepared a list -- by coincidence, according to 
members -- that struck Democratic and Republican districts roughly evenly. That 
prompted House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin (D-Wis.) to call it 
"fair and reasonable," and it set the stage for relatively easy approval. 
</P>
<P>
Several lawmakers, including Aspin and Rep. Robert T. Matsui (D-Sacramento), 
want to establish another bipartisan commission to review the Cheney list. 
Matsui's Sacramento district would lose an Army depot in Cheney's proposed 
closures. 
</P>
<P>
But for whatever reasons, the effect of Cheney's proposals is decidedly 
lopsided. Information released by the Army, Navy and Air Force this week 
reveals that the vast majority of personnel to be affected by the cuts are in 
Democratic congressional areas. 
</P>
<P>
Slated for Relocation 
</P>
<P>
Apart from National Guard and reserve personnel, about 95,600 military 
personnel are slated to be moved if their bases are eliminated, reduced in 
scope or "realigned." Of those, more than 87,000 -- fully 91% of the total -- 
are within Democratic areas. 
</P>
<P>
Of the approximately 60,000 civilian employees on the targeted bases, 93%, or 
more than 56,000, work in Democratic districts. Many of these civilian workers 
are not guaranteed alternate employment when their military units are disbanded 
or moved, military spokesmen said. 
</P>
<P>
Republican-located installations appear to be getting better treatment than 
equivalent facilities in Democratic areas. 
</P>
<P>
Of seven Army ammunition plants facing closure by 1994, for example, only two 
are being offered the chance to compete with each other for metal-parts 
contracts in a bid to survive. Located in Minden, La., and Scranton, Pa., both 
are in Republican congressional districts. 
</P>
<P>
Case closed? Not so fast, some experts say. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 60% of House districts are represented by Democrats, and many of the 
nation's big military bases are located in traditional Democratic areas of the 
South and West. According to the House Armed Services Committee, 19 of the 
nation's 24 largest bases -- which cumulatively account for almost 40% of the 
servicemen and women stationed in the United States -- are located in 
Democratic districts. 
</P>
<P>
"Congress is controlled by Democrats, the committees that deal with defense are 
controlled by Democrats, so they'll have the preponderance of the bases," said 
Lawrence J. Korb, a Pentagon official in the Ronald Reagan Administration who 
oversaw defense installations. "They get on those committees because they have 
or want a facility in their district, and they stay on to protect them." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, although Democratic congressional districts would be hit hard by 
Cheney's list, many of the targeted bases are located in states with prominent 
Republican senators. Among them is Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.), whose 
gubernatorial bid could be hurt by the proposed closure of 11 installations -- 
bases and smaller facilities -- in the state. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gramm Affected 
</P>
<P>
Other prominent Republicans affected would be Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, whose 
state accounts for seven of the proposed closures, and Sen. John Heinz of 
Pennsylvania, whose state would suffer four closures. Gramm, a powerful ally of 
the Bush Administration, faces a reelection bid this year. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, one analyst said, the base-closing issue could prove to be a political 
liability for Bush. 
</P>
<P>
The closings "will be an issue in 1990, but they're going to be realities in 
1992" when Bush is up for reelection, said longtime GOP analyst Kevin Phillips. 
"In those key electoral states, if I were Bush, I don't know that I would 
really want very much to win" on proposals to close bases. 
</P>
<P>
Staff writers John M. Broder and David Lauter contributed to this story. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
11 CALIFORNIA BASES SLATED FOR CLOSURE 
</P>
<P>
Of the 21 full-fledged military bases that Defense Secretary Dick Cheney 
proposed to close, 11 are in California. Nineteen are located in the districts 
of Democratic congressmen.

E. GERMANS LOOK TO FUTURE WITH HOPE -- AND UNEASE

WEIMAR, East Germany 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The burghers in Weimar, the quiet city that recalls Germany's cultural glory 
and political shame, share the feelings of their countrymen. 
</P>
<P>
From the salt-sprayed Baltic coast and the spacious, lake-speckled farmlands of 
Mecklenburg to the depressed cities of Saxony and the rolling hills of 
Thuringia, East Germans are gingerly moving toward democracy -- confused about 
the present, deeply unsure about the future. 
</P>
<P>
But from the Elbe to the Oder rivers, and here in the city that was home to 
Goethe and Schiller and the ill-fated Weimar Republic, dozens of conversations 
suggest two certainties emerging among the people struggling to lift the 
40-year yoke of communism: 
</P>
<P>
Although the Communist Party still dominates the East German government, the 
party is nearly finished in this country, destined never again to exercise 
power after the first free elections, which were moved up by two months this 
past weekend and are now scheduled for March 18. 
</P>
<P>
Reunification with West Germany is overwhelmingly favored here. The question is 
not whether, but when and how. 
</P>
<P>
So most of the 16 million East Germans are looking beyond the Communist past 
and into a free-market future -- and wondering what that future will mean for 
jobs and social benefits they have long taken for granted. 
</P>
<P>
As Violetta Bertel of Weimar's information office put it: "The mood is the same 
everywhere. People are against the Communist Party. They are for reunification. 
The question is whether it comes fast or slow. 
</P>
<P>
"But people are afraid of losing their jobs in a competitive society," she 
continued. "They know that everything is overstaffed, from auto plants to 
museums." 
</P>
<P>
Echoing Bertel's sentiments on the future of the Communist Party, Waldemar 
Faarsch, a rugged 47-year-old shipyard worker in Rostock, pulled on a beer in a 
waterfront cafe and spoke for many when he said: "There's no way now they could 
win an election. They may still be the biggest party, but they are very 
unpopular." 
</P>
<P>
As for German reunification, Rainer Frommann, councilor for the environment in 
the aptly named Bitterfeld, the most polluted city in East Germany, declared in 
his bare office: "A month ago, sentiment around here for reunification was 
50-50. Today, it's nearly 100%." 
</P>
<P>
Across East Germany, one can see the red, gold and black West German flag -- a 
colorful symbol of the desire for reunification -- hanging from construction 
cranes, from railroad switching towers and from scaffolding. There is no secret 
police to rip them down. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Matter of Economics 
</P>
<P>
There are few ideological reasons proffered for reunification. To most East 
Germans favoring a single Germany, it is a matter of sheer economic well-being. 
On visits to West Germany, they have seen the future, and it works -- at least 
better than state socialism. 
</P>
<P>
Only a relatively few intellectuals, clerics and party members continue to call 
publicly for a socialist East Germany, believing that socialism can still find 
a way to provide a better future. 
</P>
<P>
But a construction worker in East Berlin put the opposition case this way: "We 
have 40 years of socialism, and it hasn't worked. Enough is enough." 
</P>
<P>
And even Prime Minister Hans Modrow, in the first such statement by an East 
German government leader, called Thursday for the reunification of Germany as a 
neutral federation with a single government and a capital in Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, East Germany's swiftness in discarding the carapace of communism 
has left people here realizing that reunification and free enterprise could 
mean a period of hardship. 
</P>
<P>
That concern is registered not just in the major cities of East Berlin, Leipzig 
and Dresden, where most attention has focused, but in more out-of-the-way 
places on the Baltic Sea and the Polish border and in farm towns and hamlets. 
</P>
<P>
Bobbing at the wharf in Warnemunde, a charming little harbor downriver from 
Rostock, sailors aboard the fishing smack Margarethe practice a little free 
enterprise by hawking freshly grilled herring fillets from the vessel to 
passers-by. 
</P>
<P>
In the immaculate pilot house, Capt. Hans-Juergen Schneider, wearing the 
traditional Hanseatic black sailor's cap, told a visitor: "We have a good job, 
a good life, a good standard of living. As a fisherman, I would like to see the 
country -- or whatever comes after -- join the European Community so that we 
can fish in other waters besides our own. 
</P>
<P>
"The Communists are all washed up. Nobody wants them. No chance. Everyone here 
is sure that reunification will take place. The question is how fast. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Price May Go Up 
</P>
<P>
"Economically, it's difficult to see ahead. The government has been subsidizing 
the price of fish, and if we compete openly, the price will have to go up. The 
next government will have to solve this." 
</P>
<P>
The old province of Mecklenburg stretches across the north German plain, with 
overarching skies and sudden dark squalls howling in from the Baltic, which the 
Germans call the "East Sea." 
</P>
<P>
With its fishing and agriculture, the north is relatively more prosperous and 
content than the south of East Germany, the area that was the focus of most of 
the popular demonstrations that toppled the Stalinist regime of Erich Honecker 
last October. 
</P>
<P>
But astute farmers recognize that the state cooperative enterprises are 
over-staffed and that reductions will be necessary to compete in a free market. 
</P>
<P>
Siegfried and Marianne Neumann are tall blonds who live in a cozy house with 
their daughter, Dana, 17, and son, Lars, 14, in the farming hamlet of Vorbeck. 
German farmers tend to live in villages and walk or drive to their fields, 
rather than living in farmhouses on their land, as is usually the case in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Offering a visitor a pre-lunch glass of pink sparkling wine, Siegfried Neumann 
said he grows grain, hops, potatoes and turnips and raises cows and pigs on the 
8,600-acre state cooperative. 
</P>
<P>
"There is insecurity here because we are not sure about the future," he said. 
"As everywhere, we have too many people to make the farm economically 
effective. We could do better with 20% less people. But this means dislocation. 
And reunification will mean some companies will go bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
"I spend one day a week in West Germany, in Schleswig-Holstein, talking to 
farmers and market people there. We could build up trade with the West, but a 
lot has to be done. We need modernized machinery. 
</P>
<P>
"Like everywhere else, nobody is sure what's going to happen. Everyone wants 
reunification as soon as possible. We are flying the West German flag around 
here." 
</P>
<P>
As to whether he considers himself East or West German, Neumann said with a 
grin, "I am North German." 
</P>
<P>
Like those in farm families everywhere, Neumann faces the prospect that his 
children will leave the farm for city life. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to life under Honecker and his hard-line predecessors, Neumann 
said, there is now variety to Vorbeck's political scene. "We have all the 
parties represented in our town, but everybody knows each other, so the mood is 
calm." 
</P>
<P>
His wife added: "There is no support for the Communists. The remaining members 
here quit the party just yesterday. There's nothing left of them. We also have 
representatives from the opposition groups -- but they don't seem to have a 
program." 
</P>
<P>
The opposition's lack of a coherent program was also cited by Petra Stiller, a 
city librarian in Frankfurt, on the wide, sluggish Oder River which, with its 
tributary, the Neisse, forms East Germany's postwar border with Poland. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the new groups don't seem to have programs, so we don't know what to 
make of them. But we certainly won't elect the Communists," the jeans-clad 
29-year-old said. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people want change and are interested in uniting with the Federal 
Republic (West Germany). They hope change will give them a better life 
economically. They want a higher standard of living and things in the shops." 
</P>
<P>
On the touchy question of Poland's postwar borders, she said: "My grandparents 
came from east of here, land which is now Poland. But I don't want to go back 
there and see no reason that it should be part of Germany again." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pleased by Restoration 
</P>
<P>
She is delighted that the town leaders are getting around to restoring churches 
and some public buildings damaged in World War II, rather than tearing them 
down and building high-rises. 
</P>
<P>
Would she leave for West Germany? 
</P>
<P>
"I think that all of us here have thought of going to the Federal Republic, but 
I have three children, and it is not easy to get a job or an apartment. I will 
wait to see what happens in the elections." 
</P>
<P>
That theme was taken up by others. Some officials predict that unless the March 
election produces democratic results, as many as 3 million more East Germans 
will head west, joining the 344,000 who fled there during the upheaval late 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of those who left -- their departure, in effect, detonating 
the downfall of the Honecker regime -- came from the depressed, industrial 
areas of Saxony. They were mostly younger people with valuable skills, people 
such as mechanics and health workers, the population segment that the country 
can least afford to lose. 
</P>
<P>
The mass departures left some communities without basic services. There were 
reports of hospitals without sufficient nurses, troops pressed into service as 
deliverymen and drivers of public transportation. 
</P>
<P>
"If the . . . election is seriously disappointing," commented an East German 
editor who has traveled widely, "hundreds of thousands more young, able workers 
will leave for West Germany, and we will eventually become a nation of older 
pensioners, with nobody left to pay for our pensions." 
</P>
<P>
Even now, there are many who are not waiting. According to news reports, 
between 2,000 and 3,000 East Germans are moving to the West each day. 
</P>
<P>
South of Frankfurt lies the region of the Sorbs, a Slavic people who settled 
along the Neisse and who now are a minority in the area between Cottbus and 
Bautzen, with town and street signs there in both German and Sorbian. 
</P>
<P>
This is also the area that produces half of the country's electricity and 80% 
of its urban natural gas. But the power generation comes from burning brown 
coal, or lignite, which emits noxious sulfur dioxide fumes. 
</P>
<P>
The landscape is characterized by massive power plants next to deep open-pit 
mines with enormous Rube Goldberg-like machines that claw away at the earth for 
coal. In the absence of brisk winds, a pall hangs over the area, and the leaves 
of trees are often coated with gray dust. 
</P>
<P>
To entice workers to live in towns along the power belt such as Hoyerswerda, 
newly constructed, spacious apartments are offered; roomy living quarters are 
rare anywhere in East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
'My parents came here to work when I was 16," a former resident of Hoyerswerda 
recalled. "They liked the idea of a big flat. But some nights I would wake up 
and could hardly breathe. The landscape was devastated by the mines. They used 
to tell us the fumes were not poisonous, but now we know better." 
</P>
<P>
The deepest pollution band stretches from Cottbus through Dresden and Karl-Marx 
Stadt and Meissen -- a traveler might wonder how it is that beautiful 
porcelain, Meissen's trademark, could be fashioned in such a glum environment 
-- to Leipzig, Halle and Bitterfeld. 
</P>
<P>
Here, too, are massive open-pit mines and the smoke-spitting factories that 
produce brown coal briquettes used for heating in the rest of the country -- 
and so contributing to nationwide pollution. 
</P>
<P>
The depressed state of the south, East Germany's rust belt, was an important 
reason for the anti-government feelings that welled up in Leipzig and Dresden. 
Similarly, the Communist central government under Honecker allowed the inner 
cities to rot while building sterile and boring high-rise apartments farther 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Construction materials and manpower were diverted to East Berlin to shine up 
the capital for its 750th anniversary in 1987 and again two years later for the 
40th commemoration of the founding of the Communist state -- all to the anger 
and despair of provincial officials. 
</P>
<P>
Further, much of the infrastructure was allowed to run down. As a railroad 
worker named Manfred Grothmann put it: "The railways are in a desolate state. 
They electrified much of the system a few years ago but forgot about the 
roadbeds. 
</P>
<P>
"They've got electric engines, but they have to go slow because of the poor 
condition of rails and ties." 
</P>
<P>
A friend of Grothmann, Ingo Mann, added: "What's the answer? We've got to get a 
new government and help from the Federal Republic to rebuild industry and clean 
up the environment. Pretty soon, we'll all be one country, so why not get 
started now?" 
</P>
<P>
In Erfurt, the hilly capital of the Thuringia region, one almost gets the 
impression that the Germanys have already been reunited: West German visitors 
are a common sight in the striking city, with its twin Protestant and Roman 
Catholic cathedrals, its 14th-Century bridge over a branch of the Unstrut 
River, and houses and shops built atop the structure. 
</P>
<P>
It was in Erfurt that Martin Luther, years before he sparked the Protestant 
Reformation, decided to become a Roman Catholic monk; he translated the Bible 
from Latin into German at nearby Wartburg Castle, laying the foundation for 
modern German. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy to see all these people," said barman Frank Lein, pouring an 
espresso into a gilded cup in Erfurt's Erfurterhof Hotel, outside which were 
parked dozens of West German cars. "It could mean new life for the town. But 
really, reunification is the only way out of this crisis. Our great hope is 
that it will come this year." 
</P>
<P>
Less than 20 miles east of Erfurt is Weimar, near which lie a major Soviet 
helicopter base and the former Nazi concentration camp of Buchenwald -- which 
drew its name from the beech forest surrounding it and which is now a national 
memorial. On a rare clear day, the Buchenwald bell tower can be seen for miles 
around. 
</P>
<P>
Weimar itself maintains the homes of the poets Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and 
Johann von Schiller and the composer and pianist Franz Liszt. And it boasts a 
small but elegant central mall -- although most of the town, like everything 
else in East Germany, is rundown and in need of a coat of paint. 
</P>
<P>
Weimar has freshened up the city theater, where the constitution was adopted in 
1919 for Germany's ill-fated Weimar Republic. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting behind her desk, city official Bertel, who advises visitors on Weimar's 
history and importance, commented: "People don't believe in reforming socialism 
here. It had its chance and failed. Some people in middle and old age are 
disappointed that socialism didn't work. They devoted their lives to it -- in 
vain. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we don't know who to vote for," she added. "There are so many 
opposition groups saying so many different things." 
</P>
<P>
Living in Weimar, Bertel said, has made her particularly aware of the fatal 
flaw of the Weimar Republic: too many parties and not enough governmental 
discipline -- a situation made to order for the collapse of fragile democracy 
and the rise of Adolf Hitler.

HAKIM RECEIVES PROBATION, FINE, NO ARMS PROFITS 
</P>

<P>
Albert A. Hakim, who arranged arms shipments to Iran as part of a scheme to 
fund the Nicaraguan Contras, was sentenced Thursday to two years' probation and 
a $5,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-born businessman also agreed to give up his claim to $7.3 million 
in profits from the arms sales -- profits that have been lodged in frozen Swiss 
bank accounts since 1986. Under an agreement with prosecutors, the U.S. 
government can now lay claim to the money. 
</P>
<P>
Hakim originally faced five felony charges of conspiracy to illegally divert 
funds to the Contras and theft of government property. However, under a 
November plea bargain, Hakim pleaded guilty to a minor charge: a misdemeanor 
for making an illegal payment to a U.S. government employee. More specifically, 
he paid for a $13,800 security fence for Lt. Col. Oliver L. North's suburban 
Virginia home. 
</P>
<P>
Also as part of the plea bargain, Hakim agreed to cooperate with prosecutors 
and to give up his claim to the $7.3 million. He will continue to fight, 
however, for the $1.7 million in interest that has accrued in the Swiss 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
After humbly thanking U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell for a relatively 
light sentence, the 56-year-old businessman walked outside the federal 
courthouse, leaned into reporters' microphones and blasted prosecutors, the 
press and former President Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
Hakim described himself as an ordinary businessman who was caught up in a 
political dispute between the Republican White House and the Democratic 
Congress. He complained that his business and reputation had been ruined. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been abused by two presidents," he added, mentioning first Reagan and 
then "President Walsh," a reference to independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh, 
who supervised the three-year Iran-Contra prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not an arms dealer," he said. Instead, he described himself as an 
international trader in high-technology products who worked out of Northern 
California and got involved in the weapons business at the behest of the Reagan 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
Like Richard V. Secord, the retired Air Force major general who last week also 
received a two-year probation, Hakim blamed Reagan for allowing operatives in 
the Iran-Contra scheme to be the "fall guys" for the failed White House effort. 
</P>
<P>
Hakim and his attorneys also criticized Walsh for pursuing the investigation 
and prosecution of the Iran-Contra defendants, even after the main criminal 
charges were dropped. "This case never belonged in the criminal justice 
system," Hakim's attorney N. Richard Janis said outside the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
Hakim was the seventh defendant sentenced for his part in the Iran-Contra 
scandal. None has been sent to prison. The only remaining defendant, former 
National Security Adviser John M. Poindexter, is still awaiting trial. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief courtroom session Thursday, Judge Gesell praised Hakim for helping 
prosecutors, "in sharp contrast" to other defendants in the arms scandal. 
</P>
<P>
"You're also the only one who at some stage of the matter was not an officer or 
a former officer of the U.S. government," Gesell continued. "Indeed, you were 
brought into the situation you find yourself in by the U.S. government." 
</P>
<P>
Gesell also lauded Hakim for negotiating the release of American hostage David 
P. Jacobsen from Lebanon in October, 1986. Just a few weeks before the U.S. 
arms shipments to Iran were revealed, North, Secord and Hakim met with Iranian 
officials in Frankfurt, West Germany, and sought the release of American 
hostages held in Lebanon. Frustrated by the slow pace of the negotiations, 
North and Secord left, but Hakim stayed on to complete a deal that resulted in 
Jacobsen's release by his Shiite Muslim captors in Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobsen's release "was the result of your conduct," Gesell told Hakim, "not 
the result of others who have taken credit for it." 
</P>
<P>
Interviewed on Cable News Network, Jacobsen said he felt both joy and sadness 
at Hakim's sentencing: " . . . joy that the judge treated him very leniently. 
The real sadness that he was ever indicted and brought up on some minor, 
trivial charges." 
</P>
<P>
Hakim could have been sentenced to one year in prison and fined up to $100,000. 
Gesell ordered Hakim, who lives in Los Gatos, to report to a probation officer 
in nearby San Jose. He may not leave the country without getting permission 48 
hours in advance. 
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement announced Thursday by Walsh's office, the U.S. government 
can now lay claim to the $7.3 million from Swiss authorities. 
</P>
<P>
The frozen bank deposits have grown with interest to $9 million. Until 
Thursday, Hakim had contended all of this money was his because it was profit 
from arms sales he arranged. Since the weapons came from U.S. arsenals, U.S. 
officials said the profits should be returned to the Treasury. Two of Hakim's 
associates -- Swiss businessman Willard I. Zucker and Swiss lawyer Philippe 
Neyroud -- also laid claim to a smaller part of the funds. 
</P>
<P>
"We are getting back the money that can be traced to Iranian arms sales," Mary 
Belcher, a spokeswoman for Walsh, said of the $7.3 million. "This simplifies 
things 1000%." 
</P>
<P>
Hakim, Zucker and Neyroud will continue to fight over the remaining $1.7 
million from interest, she said. Since Swiss government authorities ordered the 
accounts frozen, the agreement must be submitted to Swiss officials before any 
money can be released, Belcher added. 
</P>
<P>
In papers filed with the court last week, Walsh's office said Hakim's 
cooperation could lead to "further prosecutions," but officials have refused to 
discuss new directions in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Although Walsh and his staff had nothing but kind words for Hakim Thursday, the 
businessman and his lawyers were harsh in denouncing the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Janis said Walsh's operation is "a paradigm of everything that is 
wrong with the independent counsel statute and the all-powerful, unrestrained 
prosecutions. After three years and $100 million of taxpayers' money spent in 
an unprecedented investigation, we have the U.S. government now claiming that 
Mr. Hakim is a misdemeanant because he did not stop Gen. Secord from spending 
$13,000 to build a security fence for Lt. Col. North and his family," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In response, Walsh's office said it had spent $18.5 million, not $100 million, 
since the investigation began three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Albert A. Hakim and his business partner, retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard 
V. Secord, became involved in the Iran-Contra operation in 1984. They helped 
Oliver L. North set up a private financial network of offshore companies to 
secretly sell U.S. arms to Iran, and used the profits to provide military 
assistance to the Nicaraguan Contras. Secord received two years' probation when 
he was sentenced last week.

KLVANA CASE PROMPTS NO REFORM IN MEDICAL REVIEW 
</P>

An internal inquiry into how state medical authorities handled an investigation 
of Dr. Milos Klvana, a Valencia obstetrician recently convicted of murder, 
found no need for major institutional reforms, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"Overall, I would say the system is adequate," said Dr. Rendel Levonian after a 
meeting of the Medical Board of California. Levonian, a Whittier surgeon, is 
chairman of the board's medical quality division. 
</P>
<P>
Klvana was convicted Dec. 18 by a Los Angeles Superior Court jury of 
second-degree murder in the deaths of eight infants and a fetus. 
</P>
<P>
An internal inquiry was prompted after Klvana's prosecutor said the medical 
board failed to act against the doctor's license, despite being aware of his 
incompetence. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor, Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Brian R. Kelberg, has 
called for changes in board procedures that he said rely on the opinions of 
physician consultants. 
</P>
<P>
Kelberg said the board's consultants frequently accepted Klvana's version of 
events in an atmosphere of "collegiality" that hampered the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
At Thursday's meeting of the Division of Medical Quality, which is a 
seven-member arm of the board that oversees enforcement, board Executive 
Director Kenneth J. Wagstaff differed strongly with what he described as a 
public perception that "the fox is guarding the henhouse." Board investigators 
-- not consultants -- decide whether cases should be pursued against doctors, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Kelberg, the head of the district attorney's medico-legal section, 
responded in an interview that the board has "problems that have to be 
attacked." The medical consultants should be replaced with people who have 
legal as well as medical training, he said . 
</P>
<P>
Klvana was convicted because he proceeded with out-of-hospital births in cases 
with high-risk prenatal and childbirth complications, despite knowing that he 
had neither the medical skill nor the facilities in his clinics to perform them 
safely. The newborns died between 1982 and 1986 during birth or shortly 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
Klvana, 49, is scheduled to be sentenced Monday. Kelberg is seeking a sentence 
of 53 years to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
The most notable example Kelberg cited in his criticism of the medical board 
involved the 1983 death of Amanda Herrera. In that case, for which Klvana was 
eventually convicted of murder, two medical board consultants believed Klvana's 
assertion that he did not use a labor-inducing drug outside of a hospital, 
according to board documents. 
</P>
<P>
But an autopsy showed head injuries indicating that the infant died because she 
was forced through the birth canal by drug-induced contractions, Kelberg said. 
Board documents show that at least one of the board consultants knew of the 
autopsy's existence. 
</P>
<P>
One of the consultants wrote that although he believed Klvana's care to be 
grossly negligent, "I would assume his practice in this case is no different 
from many situations in the Third World where only marginal medical care is 
available." 
</P>
<P>
During the board meeting, Wagstaff did not mention the Klvana case by name. But 
he referred to the "Third World" comment and said he plans to issue 
instructions to all medical board consultants about the meaning of California 
standards of health care. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't use Third World standards," he told the board.

30 YEARS AFTER SIT-IN, THEY EAT AT WOOLWORTH COUNTER;

SPARKED SIMILAR ACTIONS ACROSS THE SOUTH.

The dramatic lunch counter sit-in 30 years ago that helped ignite the 1960s 
civil rights movement surprised everyone, even the four black participants who 
re-enacted it Thursday at Woolworth. 
</P>
<P>
"We were scared," recalled Franklin McCain, one of the four college students 
who staged the first lunch counter sit-in on Feb. 1, 1960. "All I wanted was a 
Coke and a doughnut." 
</P>
<P>
"If someone had come up behind me and said 'Boo,' I probably would have fallen 
off the stool," said another protester, David Richmond. 
</P>
<P>
When McCain and his three college friends took their same seats Thursday, they 
were treatedlike celebrities. A black Woolworth executive greeted them before 
they sat down to a breakfast of eggs, grits, bacon and coffee. 
</P>
<P>
McCain, Richmond, Joseph McNeil and Jibreel Khazan, formerly Ezell Blair Jr., 
were surrounded by dozens of reporters and spectators when they ordered food 
from two women who worked there on Feb. 1, 1960. 
</P>
<P>
Woolworth Vice President Aubrey Lewis noted that 30 years ago he, too, would 
have been denied service. "I'm proud you had the courage to open the doors for 
a movement," he said. 
</P>
<P>
While the four waited for their meals, some spectators sang "We Shall 
Overcome." Outside there was more singing, and some bystanders carried placards 
saying "Feb. 1, 1960. It seems like only yesterday but it could be tomorrow" 
and "The only thing that's worthwhile is change -- Remembering Feb. 1, 1960." 
</P>
<P>
One thing that has not changed much is the lunch counter, which looks about the 
same as it did in 30-year-old news photographs about the sit-in. But now, black 
and white customers sit side by side on the chrome and red vinyl seats, 
ordering food and discussing sports and events of the day. 
</P>
<P>
When the four North Carolina A&amp;T State University freshmen refused to leave 
the whites-only counter 30 years ago, their sit-in touched off similar protests 
across the South. 
</P>
<P>
During their sit-in, which began at about 4 p.m., a policeman stood near them 
and slapped his billy club in the palm of his hand a few times, but they were 
not threatened with arrest. The store was closed at 5 p.m., a half-hour early, 
and they left peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
"People took us for granted because we were poor youth, freshmen in college," 
Khazan said. "In America, people don't really believe young people can do 
anything to make positive change in society. 
</P>
<P>
"We've achieved some rights, but there's many more rights that haven't been 
achieved." 
</P>
<P>
Geneva Tisdale, who is black, was working at Woolworth on Feb. 1, 1960. She 
remembers the four students coming in that day. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought they were joking," she said Thursday. "I never thought they were 
serious." 
</P>
<P>
Another counter worker, Ima Edwards, who is white, said she didn't "see it 
blossoming into this." 
</P>
<P>
After Thursday's breakfast, the four went outside, where the street in front of 
the store was renamed February One Place. 
</P>
<P>
The four said they had targeted Woolworth because it was a well-known national 
chain that allowed its lunch counters to be segregated only in the South. On 
July 25, 1960, Woolworth agreed to allow blacks at the lunch counter.

THORNBURGH ASKS SPECIAL HUD PROBE COUNSEL; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSING PROGRAM: AT ISSUE IS WHETHER FORMER SECRETARY SAMUEL R. PIERCE JR. MADE 
GRANTS OUT OF POLITICAL FAVORITISM.

<P>
Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh Thursday asked a special court to appoint an 
independent counsel to investigate whether former Housing and Urban Development 
Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. conspired with other HUD officials to defraud 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh asked the three-judge panel to name a prosecutor to look into the 
way Pierce and other HUD officials under former President Ronald Reagan handled 
the Moderate (income) Rehabilitation Program, a multimillion-dollar housing 
program. 
</P>
<P>
However, the attorney general said he had found "no reasonable grounds" to 
further investigate whether Pierce had perjured himself in testimony before a 
House Government Operations subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh acted in response to a request last Nov. 3 by a majority of the 
Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee. They sought an outside 
investigation of whether Pierce and HUD officials "conspired to deprive the 
United States of their loyal and faithful services" by making HUD grants on the 
basis of political favoritism and without regard to federal law. 
</P>
<P>
Their request triggered a preliminary inquiry by Thornburgh under the Ethics in 
Government Act. They also asked that the perjury allegations be examined. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh noted that an April, 1989, audit of the Moderate Rehabilitation 
Program by HUD's inspector general cited "a widespread perception among 
(housing) developers and persons in local Public Housing Authorities that the 
funds were being disbursed in disproportionate amounts to projects backed by 
prominent Republicans acting as consultants or by former HUD officials." The 
audit covered the years 1984-1988. 
</P>
<P>
Although Thornburgh did not specify what other former HUD officials should be 
scrutinized, he told the special court that Deborah Gore Dean, Pierce's 
executive assistant from June, 1985, through July, 1987, had been quoted as 
saying the program was "set up and designed to be a political program" that was 
run "in a political manner." 
</P>
<P>
Both Pierce and Dean invoked their Fifth Amendment protection against 
self-incrimination in refusing to testify last year before the employment and 
housing subcommittee, headed by Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo), which was 
looking into HUD's critical audit of the program. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh, who served alongside Pierce in the Cabinet during the last six 
months of Reagan's presidency, complained to the judges that he had "very 
little latitude" in deciding if an outside prosecutor was needed. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh said he had to seek the appointment "unless I can determine that 
there are no reasonable grounds to believe that further investigation is 
warranted." 
</P>
<P>
He also complained that he was not permitted to use such law enforcement tools 
as grand juries, immunity grants or issuing subpoenas. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce supplied written answers to questions submitted to him during the 
inquiry, but he and Dean declined to be interviewed by the Justice Department, 
Thornburgh said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert E. Plotkin, Pierce's attorney, voiced disappointment that an independent 
counsel had been sought "at all," but praised Thornburgh's conclusion that "the 
ridiculous perjury charges are without any merit." 
</P>
<P>
Plotkin, who declined to discuss why Pierce had refused to be questioned by 
Thornburgh's investigators, noted that the attorney general "felt constrained 
by the limits of the statute" in seeking the appointment, adding that there was 
"no mention of any overwhelming evidence that Pierce did anything wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Lantos, the House subcommittee chairman, said he welcomed Thornburgh's 
decision, adding that "an independent counsel is in the best position to fully 
investigate and resolve questions of possible criminal wrongdoing." 
</P>
<P>
Pierce, the only black in Reagan's Cabinet who served throughout both terms, 
initially testified before the House panel last May that he did not have "hands 
on" involvement in the Moderate Rehabilitation Program. 
</P>
<P>
The House Judiciary Democrats cited five instances in which Pierce allegedly 
intervened personally in decisions on various HUD programs. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh, contending there were no reasonable grounds to further probe 
perjury, said three of the five instances involve Pierce's alleged intervention 
in programs other than moderate rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Pierce's statement disclaiming "hands on" involvement "is 
fundamentally ambiguous, which makes a perjury prosecution essentially 
impossible," the attorney general said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the law, however, the three-judge panel, in naming an outside prosecutor, 
is free to structure the inquiry any way it chooses. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh's decision marked the second time that an independent counsel has 
been sought during the Bush Administration. Last year, independent counsel Dan 
K. Webb decided there was no evidence to support prosecuting James W. Cicconi 
on charges he accepted a $5,000 loan from a Baltimore brokerage that required 
no repayment. 
</P>
<P>
Cicconi, who is a presidential assistant and deputy to chief of staff John H. 
Sununu, was accused by a former chairman of the brokerage who is serving a 12 
1/2 year prison term for fraud and racketeering.

Rosa Parks, whose refusal to move to the back of the bus 35 years ago was a key 
moment in the civil rights struggle, was honored Thursday by House Democratic 
leaders, who said she had changed the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"Rosa, let me thank you personally for sitting down so long ago so I could 
stand here today," said Rep. William H. Gray III (D-Pa.), the House Democratic 
whip, who credited Parks with triggering changes that have allowed blacks such 
as himself to attain high office. 
</P>
<P>
Parks' 77th birthday on Sunday will be marked by a black-tie national tribute 
at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
In anticipation of that event, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) and 
other House Democrats appeared with Parks at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes it takes one person to say no, and a whole series of events follow," 
Foley said. "There are few people that can say they changed the nation. Rosa 
Parks changed the nation." 
</P>
<P>
Her refusal to surrender her seat to a white passenger on a Montgomery, Ala., 
city bus on Dec. 1, 1955, led to a citywide bus boycott that lasted 381 days.

CANCELED BOOK ADDS FUEL TO JERUSALEM POST TIFF 
</P>

<P>
The Jerusalem Post on Thursday canceled publication of a book about human 
rights in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, making a move that is 
sure to fuel conjecture that the influential and traditionally liberal paper is 
taking on a marked conservative slant. 
</P>
<P>
The book, entitled "Essays on Human Rights," was edited by Meron Benvenisti, 
the leading Israeli authority on the occupied lands. It was one of a series on 
the occupied region that the Post's book-publishing department was putting out. 
</P>
<P>
Benvenisti is suing to have the book published as planned. "This is clearly an 
attempt to suppress the book. The act reflects the publishers' real political 
views," he stated. 
</P>
<P>
There have been months of tumult at the Jerusalem Post after its purchase last 
year by Hollinger Inc., a Canadian company. Post editor Erwin Frenkel and about 
30 editors and reporters have resigned to protest what they called editorial 
interference by the new publishers, who are represented by a retired army 
colonel, Yehuda Levy. 
</P>
<P>
Publisher Levy maintains that cancellation of Benvenisti's book is part of a 
streamlining operation to make the Post profitable. 
</P>
<P>
"Our move has nothing to do with human rights," he said. "We have simply 
decided to break away from activities that have nothing to do with the 
newspaper." 
</P>
<P>
Levy has been in control of the manuscript since early December but said he had 
not read it. 
</P>
<P>
The Post has been advertising the seven-volume "West Bank and Gaza" series for 
several months; five books have been already published. The planned sixth 
volume, "Essays on Human Rights," covers topics such as confiscation of 
Palestinian land, labor conditions for Palestinians, the legal system in force 
during the Arab uprising and censorship of Arab publications. 
</P>
<P>
The Post, which is published in English, came under attack by Prime Minister 
Yitzhak Shamir last year for its hard-hitting reporting on the intifada, or 
Arab uprising. Shamir is said to have especially resented the Post's reach to 
foreign audiences through its weekly international edition. 
</P>
<P>
The drama at the paper is part of a larger debate in Israel over the role of 
the press, both domestic and foreign, in covering the Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict. Government officials say reporters skew coverage to favor the 
Palestinians. Journalists are chafing under steady attempts to limit coverage 
of the conflict through censorship and military prohibitions on traveling to 
the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
In a column published Jan. 21, Yosef Goell, a member of the Post's editorial 
board, sharply criticized the newspaper's past coverage of Israel, which he 
characterized as "scorched-earth" journalism. 
</P>
<P>
"A definite pro-Palestinian and anti-Israeli bias had begun to creep into the 
newspaper in its treatment of news linked to the Palestinian, territorial and 
intifada issues," Goell wrote. Several other staff members attacked Goell's 
remarks.

LEBANON CHRISTIANS CLASH AGAIN; TRUCES CALLED

The battle for military supremacy in East Beirut and Lebanon's Christian 
heartland Thursday roared through a second day of heavy shelling and vicious 
street fighting, with neither side giving way. 
</P>
<P>
A lightly observed morning truce arranged by Vatican officials collapsed by 
midday. Army brigades loyal to Christian strongman Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun and 
the militiamen of the Lebanese Forces fought house to house in neighborhoods in 
the eastern sector of the Lebanese capital. 
</P>
<P>
Near nightfall, Voice of Lebanon radio, monitored in Nicosia, reported that yet 
another cease-fire -- two failed Wednesday -- had been arranged in a direct 
telephone deal between Aoun and the Lebanese Forces commander, Samir Geagea. 
</P>
<P>
"The two leaders agreed to end the fighting, restore the situation back to 
normal and stop propaganda campaigns between the two sides," declared the 
radio, which is operated by the right-wing Falangist Party. There was no 
confirmation from Aoun's bunkered headquarters at the presidential palace at 
Baabda outside East Beirut, but Beirut press reports said the level of fighting 
decreased. 
</P>
<P>
The internecine tank and artillery battles, the worst in the fractious 
Christian camp since the start of Lebanon's civil war nearly 15 years ago, have 
killed more than 60 soldiers and civilians in 48 hours, according to the 
reports. About 250 people were reported wounded. 
</P>
<P>
The fighting was triggered by Aoun's demand Tuesday that Geagea's militia 
forces either lay down their arms or join his army units. The headstrong, 
U.S.-trained general would likely lose face in the Christian camp if he agreed 
to withdraw his challenge. 
</P>
<P>
Eight of the dead fell in Muslim-dominated West Beirut when apparently stray 
shells spilled over the Green Line separating the beleaguered capital. No 
return fire by Syrian or Muslim militias forces in the west was reported. 
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Beirut, the Lebanese Forces captured a pro-Aoun naval 
base, an armor depot in the port of Juniyah and the airstrip at Halat, south of 
Jubayl, which services the general's minuscule air force. 
</P>
<P>
Elias Hrawi, a Syrian-supported Christian elected president of Lebanon last 
November under an Arab League political accord shunned by Aoun, called on the 
general's loyalists to rebel. 
</P>
<P>
"The army's mission is to protect the citizens, not to kill them," Hrawi said 
in a radio interview. 
</P>
<P>
The new president sacked Aoun shortly after taking office. However, the 
54-year-old general, who has struck a popular chord among the Christian 
populace through his campaign to drive the Syrian army from Lebanon, has 
refused to budge from Baabda. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the State Department on Thursday called again for Aoun to step 
down. 
</P>
<P>
"Gen. Aoun must realize that his bellicose behavior does not advance the 
interests of the Christians or any other community . . ., the Washington 
statement said.

BULGARIA'S PREMIER, COMMUNIST-CONTROLLED CABINET RESIGN

<P>
Prime Minister Georgi Atanassov, a holdover from the era of disgraced leader 
Todor Zhivkov, resigned along with his 22-member Communist-controlled Cabinet, 
Bulgarian state radio said late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The resignation was the first by a government since 1947, when the Communist 
Party consolidated power in postwar Bulgaria, according to the state news 
agency BTA. 
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet's departure clears the way for creation of an interim government to 
run Bulgaria until elections this year. The Communists have proposed such a 
government to share power with the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
The state news agency said the resignations became known Thursday night during 
an emergency, closed-door Communist Party congress. The government will 
continue to serve until Parliament accepts its resignation, the agency said. No 
date was given. 
</P>
<P>
Delegates to the party congress remained in session and were expected to 
continue meeting through this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, the delegates adopted a new party platform that confirmed the 
relinquishing of the Communists' monopoly on power, as approved by Parliament 
last month. They also sanctioned moderate reforms before starting the secret 
session to elect the party leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Atanassov had come under fire for failing to curb unprecedented labor unrest 
and resolve other economic ills. His resignation was widely expected. 
</P>
<P>
Atanassov became prime minister in March, 1986. He survived the Nov. 10 ouster 
of Communist Party chief Zhivkov, but was not able to escape the former 
leader's shadow. Zhivkov is now under arrest on criminal charges.

<P>
The government on Thursday deployed troops, tanks and warplanes in Yugoslavia's 
Kosovo province, where six more ethnic Albanians were killed in fierce clashes 
verging on civil war. 
</P>
<P>
Belgrade Radio said Yugoslav President Janez Drnovsek will visit Kosovo today. 
</P>
<P>
Troops roamed the Serbian-controlled province on Thursday, the official Tanjug 
news agency said, and air force jets flew low over the provincial capital, 
Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters saw 15 tanks in a village near Pristina and later saw tanks and 
trucks heading toward an army base near the capital. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said Thursday that 19 people, including a policeman, have been killed 
and 98 people hurt since ethnic Albanians took to the streets Jan. 24 to demand 
greater autonomy, free elections, the resignation of regional leaders and the 
release of political prisoners. But reporters on the scene said more than 30 
people have been killed. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, a teen-age girl was killed during a gunfight with police in a 
village near Podujevo, north of Pristina. Another Podujevo villager said his 
25-year-old son was shot and killed by an army officer. 
</P>
<P>
One person was killed in clashes between police and about 500 protesters in the 
village of Magura, Belgrade Radio said. Zagreb television reported three other 
deaths without giving details. 
</P>
<P>
Tanjug said the most serious clashes took place in Podujevo, Pristina and 
Djarkovica and in villages close to the town of Titova Mitvrovica, where 
thousands of Albanians gathered for the funeral of two men killed Tuesday.

PANEL FINDS REP. SAVAGE MADE IMPROPER 'SEXUAL ADVANCES' 
</P>

<P>
The House Ethics Committee concluded that Rep. Gus Savage (D-Ill.) made 
improper "sexual advances" to a female Peace Corps volunteer in Zaire last 
March, according to a copy of the panel's report obtained Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The unreleased report, obtained by the Associated Press, said the committee 
would not take further action because Savage had written a letter of apology to 
the woman, who was not identified by name. 
</P>
<P>
The report said Savage's behavior was "contrary" to a House rule requiring 
members' conduct to "reflect creditably" on the legislative body. 
</P>
<P>
An account of an interview with the woman quoted her as saying Savage, in the 
course of an evening, forced kisses on her, pawed her and "asked her to have 
sex with him" on three occasions, but she was "not responsive." 
</P>
<P>
Savage, a black lawmaker from Chicago, contended in a House speech that the 
committee was declining to pursue the case and said he received "not even a 
slap on the wrist." 
</P>
<P>
He described the allegations against him as a "racist attack" by white 
government officials and white-owned news media, and did not mention the letter 
of apology. 
</P>
<P>
The committee chairman, Rep. Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles) refused to comment 
on Savage's remarks. 
</P>
<P>
"The committee clearly disapproves of Rep. Savage's conduct" in the trip last 
March, the report said. "Based upon its review of available information and the 
congressman's Nov. 20, 1989, letter of apology, the committee believes that 
Rep. Savage did, in fact, make sexual advances to the Peace Corps volunteer." 
</P>
<P>
The report added that Savage "has acknowledged that he may have acted 
inappropriately as evidenced by his letter." 
</P>
<P>
The Committee on Standards of Official Conduct -- the ethics panel's formal 
name -- said it was placing other House members "on notice" that similar 
conduct would be viewed "with the clear possibility that additional action 
might be pursued." 
</P>
<P>
The committee considered allegations that Savage assaulted the female Peace 
Corps volunteer while on an official trip to Zaire last March. 
</P>
<P>
The worker contended that Savage fondled her for more than two hours in the 
back of a chauffeur-driven embassy car in Kinshasa, the country's capital, 
according to several government officials. 
</P>
<P>
A House source, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the Peace Corps 
worker "was unwilling to testify. She did not want to pursue it."

DEMOCRATS QUESTION TIMETABLE FOR TROOP CUTS; 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSE: PENTAGON CHIEF SEES THE SOVIET UNION PULLING ITS FORCES OUT OF EUROPE 
BY 1995. SENATORS ARGUE THAT EVENTS CALL FOR FASTER NEGOTIATIONS.

Defense Secretary Dick Cheney predicted Thursday that the Soviet Union will 
withdraw all of its troops from Europe by 1995, a forecast that prompted key 
Senate Democrats to question whether President Bush's new proposal for cutting 
U.S. forces should be faster and deeper. 
</P>
<P>
As the Senate Armed Services Committee opened congressional debate on reshaping 
the nation's military structure, Cheney and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff, Gen. Colin L. Powell, were repeatedly challenged on the Administration's 
troop-reduction plans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
195,000 Force Level 
</P>
<P>
Cheney, disclosing the Pentagon's rough timetable for cuts in Europe, testified 
that it may take a year or two to carry out any U.S.-Soviet agreement on the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
Bush announced Wednesday night that he was recommending that each side cut its 
combat forces in Central Europe to 195,000, with the United States allowed to 
have an additional 30,000 elsewhere in Europe. Currently, the United States has 
305,000 troops on the continent. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Alan J. Dixon (D-Ill.), sharply criticizing the pace of negotiations, 
declared that he would push the subcommittee he heads to legislate an immediate 
reduction of 50,000 American troops in Europe and 10,000 in Korea. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon said events are overtaking negotiations, with NATO allies West Germany 
and Belgium already planning their own deep cuts and Soviet forces certain to 
be kicked out by new governments in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying we should strip until we're naked," Dixon said. "There are 
reasonable, moderate, fair reductions we can make." 
</P>
<P>
Later, Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) applauded Bush for going beyond his 
proposal of last May and advocating the withdrawal of 80,000 U.S. troops, not 
just the 30,000 he called for then. He called it "much more relevant to the 
changes in Europe and to the budget realities here at home." 
</P>
<P>
But Nunn voiced strong concern when Cheney seemed to advocate keeping 225,000 
U.S. troops in Europe indefinitely, despite his prediction that the Soviets 
would pull all of its forces out of Eastern Europe and the two Germanys would 
be reunited. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn warned that unless the United States had plans to make substantial 
withdrawals in such a case, it could wind up supplying most of the ground 
forces for NATO as other allies disbanded their units. 
</P>
<P>
The influential senator got Cheney to concede that the Administration would 
"take another look" at U.S. troop levels in the event of a sweeping Soviet 
pullback and German reunification. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Cheney's expression of flexibility, the defense secretary firmly 
defended Bush's new plan. He asserted that any effort by Congress to make 
unilateral troop cuts before the conclusion of U.S.-Soviet arms control talks 
would undermine the NATO alliance and encourage greater instability in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"We are on the verge of winning one of the greatest victories in the history of 
the world without a shot being fired," Cheney said. "We should not unilaterally 
bring them (U.S. troops) home before we get an agreement." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Republicans Cautious 
</P>
<P>
Several Republicans on the committee strongly backed that position. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot let the euphoria sweeping this nation drive us to unilateral and 
hasty reductions in these forces," Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S. C.) said. 
</P>
<P>
Although members of both parties warmly pledged to work cooperatively with 
Cheney and Powell in the battles ahead, several Democrats served notice that 
they would press for deep cuts in the Administration's proposals for increased 
spending on strategic weapons programs. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) proposed a "Democratic alternative" that he 
said would carve a $169-billion "peace dividend" out of the defense budget over 
the next five years, more than quadrupling the savings proposed by Bush for the 
same period. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy singled out the B-2 Stealth bomber, the "Star Wars" anti-missile 
program and other major programs for deep slashes. He argued that Bush's budget 
fails to reflect a dramatically diminished Soviet military threat and a massive 
upgrading of U.S. strategic weapons in the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to have a modernization program," he said, "but does it have to be at 
the madcap pace of the 1980s?" 
</P>
<P>
Cheney, while acknowledging major changes in the world, said that the Soviets 
continue to modernize their own strategic arsenal. "The Soviet Union remains 
the only nation on earth capable of destroying the United States," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Powell likewise contended that this was no time for the nation to let down its 
guard. 
</P>
<P>
"I never want to return to that leisurely, comfortable 'From Here to Eternity' 
attitude of the 1930s that helped invite global conflict to an unsuspecting 
world," he said.

COUPLE HELD IN CONTRACT KILLING OF SON

<P>
An elderly Pompano Beach couple were charged Thursday with arranging the 
contract killing of their only son to collect a $70,000 insurance policy, 
Broward County sheriff's officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Theron Morris, 76, and his wife, Leila Mary Morris, 62, were being held without 
bond in the Broward County Jail, charged with first-degree murder in the Jan. 8 
slaying of their son, Christopher Morris, 42. 
</P>
<P>
George Crolius, a spokesman for the sheriff's office, said the couple are 
accused of hiring their son's roommate, Martin Wayne Rector, to carry out the 
killing. 
</P>
<P>
The plot was hatched after Christopher Morris' scheme to kill his former wife 
and her 10-year-old daughter for a $35,000 insurance policy fell through. 
</P>
<P>
Crolius said that Christopher Morris and Rector, 34, had planned to commit the 
murders and divide the insurance money with Theron and Leila Mary Morris. The 
younger Morris then learned that the insurance policy. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said that Morris walked into his parents' trailer home on Jan. 8 and 
was met by Rector, who ordered him to the floor at gunpoint. He was later found 
shot to death. 
</P>
<P>
Rector was arrested Wednesday.

William Holmes says he has the Constitution on his side, and so the Post Office 
be damned. 
</P>
<P>
Holmes, 41, a General Dynamics/Convair engineer living in Escondido, says he 
discovered recently that the 1961 law setting first-class postage at 6 cents 
has never been changed. Forget that 25-cent stuff. 
</P>
<P>
Since November, Holmes has sent out 200-plus letters, each with only 6 cents 
postage and a stamp that says: "First Class Mail. 81 U.S. Statute L. 613. No 
Postage Due." He became a Libertarian a few years back and it changed his life. 
</P>
<P>
"We are tired of administrative organizations making law and ignoring the 
supreme law of the land, the Constitution," Holmes said. 
</P>
<P>
Postal officials have heard it all before. Across the land, the Post Office has 
gotten 250 court orders against other postal protesters using the 6-cent 
scheme. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an old scam," said Ken Boyd, spokesman for the Post Office in San Diego. 
If Holmes persists, he'll wind up in federal court, Boyd said. 
</P>
<P>
But the 6-cent flap points out a little-known chink in Post Office armor: the 
use of correct postage depends more on voluntary compliance than the public 
thinks. All but three of Holmes' letters were delivered undetected. 
</P>
<P>
Sorting machines detect whether postage is being used (by sensing the ink on 
stamps) but cannot tell whether the postage is "short-paid." If the letter 
carrier doesn't catch it, it doesn't get caught. 
</P>
<P>
Holmes vows to take the 6-cent issue to the Libertarian state convention later 
this month in Mission Valley. 
</P>
<P>
He's also decided to stop paying federal income taxes. He found a law that says 
only residents of the District of Columbia need to file a 1040 form. 
</P>
<P>
If he thinks the Post Office is unforgiving, wait until he meets the Internal 
Revenue Service, said Boyd.

<P>
This is the same ACLU that finds nothing wrong with nunchakus, now being used 
by police against uncooperative anti-abortion protesters. The San Diego City 
Council votes $80,000 to increase the Police Department's stockpile of 
nunchakus, and the ACLU is silent.

Howard Wayne, a deputy attorney general in San Diego, is running for Assembly. 
He hired Tom Shepard, Hedgecock's convicted co-conspirator, as a political 
consultant, and Bob Meadow, labeled by the grand jury an unindicted 
co-conspirator, as a pollster. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne sees nothing incongruous in this. He says he is not handling the 
Hedgecock case and, besides, Shepard and Meadow are not defendants in the case. 
</P>

Law and order and ethics in government are major issues in his campaign, he 
says.

Henderson is always eager to tweak Wolfsheimer. He issued a statement saying

LINDBERGH FIELD: IT COULD HAVE BEEN A SCENE FROM "BONANZA," EXCEPT THAT NO ONE

It wasn't an episode from "L.A. Law," but it could have been: The disgruntled 
judge is told that more than a thousand people from Point Loma are unhappy 
about a proposed settlement of their airport noise lawsuit, which they never 
consented to and which pays their out-of-town lawyer $50,000, so the judge 
excuses himself from the courtroom to let the attorney and the people talk. 
</P>
<P>
For the next half an hour, lawyer John Schimmenti of El Segundo stands in the 
center of the large courtroom as dozens of his clients fire away with angry 
questions. Why do you deserve $50,000? Why didn't you return our phone calls? 
Why didn't you tell us about the settlement? 
</P>
<P>
"This is so pathetic . . . (and) such a scummy way to do business," charges one 
of the clients, Pat Rickon. 
</P>
<P>
Schimmenti tries to explain. Yes, he says, some mistakes were made. The law has 
changed, he says. "Use the microphone, we can't hear you!" yells an elderly 
woman, one of many in the audience. The lawyer offers to divide the $50,000 
with the people. The courtroom erupts in derisive laughter. 
</P>
<P>
"You're fired!" shouts a man in the back. Some of the clients, themselves 
lawyers, quiz Schimmenti as if he were on the witness stand. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the marshals and law clerks, onlookers to the inquisition, grin 
nervously and whisper. It could be a scene from "Bonanza," except no one has a 
rope. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, it's over. Schimmenti tells U.S. District Judge J. Lawrence Irving 
that "a substantial number" of his clients don't want to settle with the San 
Diego Unified Port District, the agency that runs Lindbergh Field and which the 
estimated 1,500 residents sued because of jet noise at the busy airport. 
</P>
<P>
Irving, who earlier had explained that he was inundated with phone calls, 
letters and a personal visit from residents since December, when the proposed 
settlement became public, tells Schimmenti, "I had no intention of approving 
this settlement" because of the dissatisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
So the the lawsuit -- technically 11 lawsuits filed against the Port District 
involving 780 parcels of property -- moves forward to a trial, probably this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
Irving says he will give the residents 90 days, until April 
</P>
<P>
27, to decide how they want to proceed. He orders Schimmenti to document his 
billing to the court by providing time sheets. 
</P>
<P>
The judge also calls on Schimmenti and the lawyer for the Port District, 
Michael Gatzke, to contact all the residents who were named in the lawsuit and 
notify them of the new developments, and to ask whether they want to remain as 
plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, a somewhat chagrined Schimmenti, acknowledging he has never seen or 
participated in a similar scene, says he assumes he will remain the lawyer for 
the residents. But many in the lobby say they intend to hire someone new to 
represent them. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see how we can keep him. We're not going to court with him," says John 
Turner, a plaintiff and a lawyer himself. Turner says some leaders of the 
residents, many of whom are members of the Airport Coalition, a group that has 
long waged a battle over airport noise, have already begun discussions with San 
Diego attorneys who might take the case. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Palmtag, a plaintiff and spokeswoman for the Airport Coalition, praises 
Irving and says: "He really understood what was happening to us and took care 
of it in a responsible way. We couldn't have asked for more." 
</P>
<P>
Palmtag says the issue isn't about money or damage awards the residents could 
potentially receive. Instead, she says, it's about moving Lindbergh Field. The 
controversy over the proposed settlement and news that the Port District 
intends to improve Lindbergh Field to accommodate more passengers has 
rejuvenated many in Point Loma to fight against the airport in court, she said. 
</P>
<P>
According to the terms of the proposed settlement, first offered to Schimmenti 
by the Port District, the Point Loma homeowners would not have received money 
damages from the Port District. But the agency would have paid the residents' 
legal fees, up to $50,000. In addition, some of the residents were free to 
refile their lawsuit by 1994 with a different attorney. But many people at 
Thursday's hearing say they were excluded from refiling because they had not 
answered letters sent by Schimmenti, letters many said they never received. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of Thursday's hearing, an elderly woman makes her way to the railing 
separating the audience from the lawyers and judge. "Thank you very much, 
judge," she calls out to Irving, as he walks to his chambers. "You're welcome," 
he replies.

DUFFY CHANGES CAMPAIGN-FUND RULES THAT HE MAY HAVE BROKEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego County Sheriff John Duffy and Assistant Sheriff Jack Drown accepted 
thousands of dollars in campaign contributions last year from fellow members of 
their department, apparently in conflict with a Sheriff's Department policy 
prohibiting such contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy this week reversed the longstanding policy barring sheriff's candidates 
from within the department from receiving political donations from sworn staff 
members. He made the change on the eve of the deadline for candidates to file 
their first round of financial disclosures. 
</P>
<P>
In those disclosure forms, Duffy and Drown list numerous donations from 
high-ranking members of the Sheriff's Department last year, including $250 
contributions that Duffy and Drown gave each other. 
</P>
<P>
The forms show that Drown collected three-fourths of his $3,650 in campaign 
money from sworn staff members or their spouses, while Duffy received about 8% 
of his $25,935 in donations from sworn deputies or their spouses. 
</P>
<P>
Told of the contributions, other candidates for sheriff said Thursday it showed 
collusion between Duffy and Drown. In December, Duffy announced he was pulling 
out of the race and endorsed Drown. 
</P>
<P>
The rival candidates contend that Duffy and Drown first ignored their own 
written policy regarding campaign donations from department members, and then 
reversed that procedure when they had to declare 
</P>
<P>
the money on the campaign forms. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't appear to be illegal," said ex-San Diego Police Chief Ray Hoobler, 
one of the candidates in the June primary election for sheriff. "But the 
conduct certainly is somewhat suspicious as far as a motive." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm irritated for two reasons," said sheriff's Capt. Jim Roache, another 
candidate. "I was given special instructions to comply with department policy 
and did not accept or solicit any money from department employees. I have bent 
over backwards not to involve department employees in this hotly contested 
political battle." 
</P>
<P>
Roache added that he has hired an attorney to research whether any campaign 
laws were broken. 
</P>
<P>
Despite repeated attempts, neither Duffy nor Drown could be reached for comment 
Thursday. Nor did Janet Houts, the department's legal adviser, return several 
phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Bob Takeshta, a department spokesman, said he could not discuss in detail 
the policy change because it was a political -- rather than a departmental -- 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
But he did say it was his understanding that the switch was made only to 
"clarify" what role sworn staff members can play in political fund raising and 
to make sure their conduct is "in compliance with applicable government code 
sections governing political activity." 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the policy was reversed to accommodate the money Duffy and Drown 
had already received from members of the Sheriff's Department, Takeshta said: 
</P>
<P>
"That's an unequivocal no. The change was based solely to clarify the rules, 
and for no other reason." 
</P>
<P>
Until Tuesday, the department's manual governing the "rules and conduct for 
sworn members of the San Diego County Sheriff's Department" included this 
provision: 
</P>
<P>
"Officers are prohibitted from (any actions to) solicit or knowingly receive 
from any other officer or employee of the county of San Diego any political 
assessment, subscription or contribution." 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's officials could not say how long the policy had been in effect, but 
one source said it had been a policy for more than 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, that provision of the policy manual was stricken and new language 
was inserted, allowing sworn Sheriff's Department employees who are candidates 
for political office to: 
</P>
<P>
"Communicate through the mail or by other means requests for political funds or 
contributions to a significant segment of the public which may include officers 
or employees of the county." 
</P>
<P>
"However," the replacement provision adds, "officers shall not solicit 
political funds or contributions solely from employees of the county of San 
Diego." 
</P>
<P>
Takeshta said the change "was just to show that county employees can be 
solicited for political support as long as they are included with others and 
not targeted separately," he said. "And that's the reason why it was done." 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, the day after the policy was switched, was the deadline for 
sheriff's candidates to file their first campaign finance disclosure forms. In 
those forms, the candidates were required to list all significant contributions 
they received in the six months between July 1 and last Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy was a candidate for re-election through last fall and therefore was 
required to file a disclosure form. He announced Dec. 11 that he was 
withdrawing from the race, after intense media coverage about his management 
style. On the same day that he told reporters he was quitting the race, Drown 
announced his intention to run. 
</P>
<P>
Drown's disclosure form states that he received $3,650 in contributions. That 
amount includes $2,700 in 12 individual donations made by sworn members of the 
Sheriff's Department or their spouses. 
</P>
<P>
Those who gave Drown the maximum amount of $250 are Duffy and his wife, Linda; 
Assistant Sheriff Richard W. Reed and his wife, Pamela; Capt. James Marmack, 
who supervises the Vista jail; Lt. Alan Truitt; Sgt. Bill Southwell and his 
wife, Susan; and Sgt. Debra Hanlon and her husband, John. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Ernest Klevesahl and Sgt. Frank Nunez gave $100 each to Drown. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy, meanwhile, disclosed that he received $25,935 in donations. That amount 
includes $2,000 in eight individual contributions made by sworn members of the 
Sheriff's Department or their spouses. 
</P>
<P>
Those contributors, all of whom gave the maximum donation of $250, are 
Undersheriff Richard E. Sandberg; assistant sheriffs Drown, Reed and Charles K. 
Wigginton; Capt. Alan Fulmer, the department's former chief spokesman who now 
supervises the Vista station; and Lt. Liz Foster, who took Fulmer's job as 
department spokesperson. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy and his wife also contributed $250 each to his campaign, as did Janet 
Houts, the sheriff's legal adviser, and her husband, attorney John Houts. 
</P>
<P>
Roache said he was upset that Drown skirted the policy provisions regarding 
money from staff members, while he as a sheriff's captain was forced to abide 
by the code of conduct. He also suggested that the policy reversal -- timed on 
the eve of the filing deadline -- indicated that Drown and Duffy were 
attempting to cover their tracks. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a coincidence that the policy change was distributed to department 
employees the day before the filing deadline," Roache said. "And obviously, up 
until then, it appears Mr. Drown and Mr. Duffy both were violating that 
policy." 
</P>
<P>
Everett Bobbitt, a San Diego attorney who successfully sued Duffy to overturn 
another department provision that had prohibited Roache from running for 
sheriff, has been retained by Roache again, this time to research the legal 
implications of how the money from within the Sheriff's Department was raised. 
</P>
<P>
Bobbitt, who donated $250 to Roache's campaign, said he plans to lodge a 
complaint with the County Board of Supervisors and also may file a lawsuit 
challenging Drown's and Duffy's rights to retain that money. 
</P>
<P>
Vince Jimno, a sheriff's candidate who is on leave from his job as police chief 
in Escondido, said he believed it was simply a "policy of convenience" for 
Duffy to change the provision regarding department employees and political 
donations. 
</P>
<P>
Jimno's disclosure form states that he raised $7,789, most of it from 
individuals living or working in North County. 
</P>
<P>
Roache reported contributions of $6,880, including donations from some 
officials within the San Diego school system, where Roache serves as an elected 
board member. 
</P>
<P>
Hoobler's disclosure form had not been filed with the registrar of voters by 
late Thursday afternoon. But the candidate said he raised a little more than 
$10,000 during the filing period.

BEATING BY BORDER PATROL AGENT WINS ALIEN SMUGGLER $65,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A convicted smuggler of aliens was awarded $65,000 for injuries inflicted in 
1986 by a Border Patrol agent who helped arrest the man at the San Onofre 
immigration checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
Arturo Halog Huerte, 27, and a U.S. citizen, suffered a broken nose in the 
incident when Border Patrol Agent L. E. Frost hit him with a flashlight, and a 
fractured skull from subsequent blows. However, visiting U.S. District Court 
Judge Justin Quackenbush ruled that use of the flashlight did not amount to 
"unreasonable force." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the judge found that blows delivered by Frost, after Halog was 
subdued, amounted to excessive force, said attorney Raymond Buendia, who 
represented Halog. Halog has two convictions for alien smuggling and spent 21 
months in federal prison after the arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Quackenbush's ruling was applauded by longtime Border Patrol critic Roberto 
Martinez. Martinez, director of the American Friends Service Committee, a 
Quaker group that advocates migrants rights, said the judge's decision "sent a 
message to Border Patrol agents. . . . They just can't physically abuse people 
and get away with it." 
</P>
<P>
Agent Ted Swofford, Border Patrol spokesman, declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
The incident involving Halog oc 
</P>
<P>
curred early on the morning of March 17, 1986, when agents stopped him on 
suspicion of alien smuggling. According to affidavits filed in the case, Halog 
attempted to escape by running across the freeway but was chased and caught by 
Border Patrol agents. 
</P>
<P>
Frost, who is now a U.S. Customs agent in Albuquerque, N.M., admitted 
delivering a blow with the flashlight but denied hitting Halog afterward. No 
agents were disciplined in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Halog was placed in custody and taken to San Clemente Hospital, where a doctor 
diagnosed a fractured skull and recommended admitting Halog. The doctor 
relented when agents told him that Halog would be transferred to the 
Metropolitan Correctional Center, where medical treatment is available. 
</P>
<P>
Halog was instead taken to a small holding cell in San Ysidro and the following 
day to the MCC, where prison officials photographed his injuries before booking 
him. He was then taken to Harborview Hospital where a doctor rediagnosed a 
fractured skull and admitted him for two days. 
</P>
<P>
"On several occasions, after his arrest, Halog asked for medicine and medical 
attention, but Border Patrol agents laughed and refused to act," said Buendia. 
</P>
<P>
The statement was contested by Special Assistant U.S. Atty. Samuel Bettwy, who 
represented both the Border Patrol and Frost at the civil trial. According to 
Bettwy, the judge "ruled that there was no failure to provide adequate medical 
treatment, and there was no harm done." 
</P>
<P>
Bettwy said that Quackenbush never specified which blows amounted to excessive 
force, but agreed with Buendia that they occurred after Halog was hit with the 
flashlight. He characterized Frost as "a highly commended employee with a clean 
file." 
</P>
<P>
Violence and shootings along the border are commonplace, and Border Patrol 
agents are frequently involved in incidents that result in allegations of 
brutality and excessive force. Martinez said that civil suits against the 
Border Patrol are rarely successful because federal judges usually believe an 
agent's account of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Humberto Carrillo Estrada, 14, is one of a few who have won damages from the 
Border Patrol. In 1987, a federal judge awarded Carrillo $574,000 for injuries 
suffered when he was shot by Agent Edward C. Cole two years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
In that incident, Cole alleged that the boy was going to throw a softball-sized 
rock through a hole in the border fence, at another agent who was arresting 
Carrillo's older brother. Cole fired several shots through the fence and hit 
Carrillo who was standing on the Mexican side. 
</P>
<P>
The judge who heard the lawsuit ruled that Cole lied in his version of the 
shooting and acted unlawfully. No charges were brought against Cole, despite 
investigations by the INS Office of Responsibility, the district attorney and 
the state attorney general's office.

Border arrest case -- Because of inaccurate information provided by a 
plaintiff's attorney, The Times incorrectly reported Feb. 2 that a federal 
judge ruled that former Border Patrol Agent L.E. Frost had used excessive force

excessive force but did not specify in his ruling which of the agents at the 
scene used unreasonable force.

6 INCUMBENTS FAIL TO FILE FOR APRIL MUNICIPAL RACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE HATCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Key posts in several South Bay cities will be wide open for competition in the 
April 10 municipal elections following decisions by six incumbents not to seek 
reelection. 
</P>
<P>
As of 5 p.m. Thursday -- the filing deadline for the April balloting -- 
nomination papers had not been turned in by City Council members Irene Strobel 
of Avalon, Dan McKenzie of Lawndale, Hal Hall of Lomita and James Kinney and 
Edward Ritscher of Palos Verdes Estates. Lawndale Mayor Sarann Kruse, who 
announced Dec. 7 that she was leaving office, also did not file. 
</P>
<P>
In cities where incumbents passed up the chance to run for reelection, the 
filing deadline for those races was automatically extended to Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In all, 57 candidates have filed for the various seats at stake in the nine 
South Bay cities holding elections April 10 -- Avalon, Carson, El Segundo, 
Gardena, Lawndale, Lomita, Manhattan Beach, Palos Verdes Estates and Rolling 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
While Thursday's deadline left several council seats open, it also left two 
South Bay mayors virtually assured of another term in office. As of 5 p.m. 
Thursday, mayors Hugh (Bud) Smith of Avalon and Don Dear of Gardena had not 
drawn opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Barring write-in challenges, that guarantees the reelection of three South Bay 
chief executives. On Dec. 28, Torrance Mayor Katy Geissert made it past the 
filing period for her city's March 6 municipal elections without drawing an 
opponent. 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood Mayor Edward Vincent's seat also is up for election Nov. 6, but that 
city does not hold its filing period until mid-July. 
</P>
<P>
Although the mayor's race seems decided in Avalon, four candidates have filed 
for the two council seats up for election there and the field may grow before 
filing ends next Tuesday. Incumbent Councilman Hal Host filed for reelection, 
as did three challengers -- Barbara Doutt, a community volunteer who is married 
to Dan Doutt, executive vice president and spokesman for the Santa Catalina 
Island Co.; Dennis Reitinger, an Avalon businessman, and former Councilman 
George Scott. 
</P>
<P>
In Carson, both of the City Council incumbents up for reelection, John Anderson 
and Sylvia Muise, filed for office. 
</P>
<P>
But so did a crush of challengers -- businessman Al Blanco, former 
Torrance-Carson NAACP President Mervin (Marvin) Clayton, retired Army officer 
Nathaniel (Nate) Riddick, educator and administrator Juanita McDonald, and 
business administrator Barbara Post. 
</P>
<P>
Another challenger, accountant Jaime Punsalan, filed papers to challenge City 
Treasurer Mary Louise Custer. No candidates came forward to take on the fourth 
Carson incumbent facing reelection this year, City Clerk Helen Kawagoe. 
</P>
<P>
Two City Council seats are up for grabs in El Segundo and both incumbents Alan 
West and H. R. (Bob) Anderson, have filed for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, four challengers filed nomination papers -- J. B. Wise, an 
electrical contractor; Terry Ceretto, an aerospace test technician; Gerhardt 
Van Drie, a civil engineer, and Thomas A. Jolly, a designer and inventor. 
</P>
<P>
Though Gardena Mayor Dear cleared the candidate filing process unchallenged, 
the two City Council members facing reelection, Mas Fukai and Gwen Duffy, drew 
a pair of opponents -- Steven Bradford, an IBM marketing representative, and 
Curt Bryant, a Gardena businessman. 
</P>
<P>
In Lawndale, the departure of Mayor Kruse and Councilman McKenzie from the 
political scene has acted like a magnet, attracting 11 challengers. 
</P>
<P>
The only incumbents filing for reelection are Councilman Larry Rudolph and City 
Clerk Neil Roth. 
</P>
<P>
Filing for mayor were Virginia Rhodes, an office manager; Michael Machado, a 
tow truck driver; Melissa Bergstrom, a health counselor, and Councilman Harold 
Hoffmann. (If Hoffmann wins, a successor will be picked for his council seat in 
a special election or by appointment of the City Council.) 
</P>
<P>
Filing for the Lawndale council were Herman Wienstein, a real estate agent; 
Nancy Marthens, a TRW business data analyst; Ronald Maxwell, a former Lawndale 
parks and recreation commissioner; Norman Lagerquist; William Johnson, manager 
of a Ralphs grocery store, and Uffe Moller, a manager at Garret AiResearch in 
Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
Yet another challenger filed papers to run for city clerk -- Barbara Grimes, a 
former deputy city clerk. 
</P>
<P>
In Lomita, Hal Hall was the only one of the three council incumbents up for 
reelection who decided to call it quits. Incumbents Peter Rossick and Robert 
Hargrave both filed for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
As of Thursday, there were three challengers: Chuck Taylor, an advertising 
executive and city planning commissioner, Lawson Pedigo and Beverly Hart. Hart, 
a college administrator, is the former president of a local homeowners group 
that clashed with the council last year over a proposed 24-hour mini-mart 
licensed to sell alcohol. Under pressure from residents, the council rejected 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
Both Manhattan Beach City Council incumbents scheduled to face voters in April 
-- Mayor Connie Siever, a Delta Airlines flight attendant, and Larry Dougharty, 
an economist -- filed for reelection. Lining up to challenge them were Dan 
Stern, an aerospace executive, and Steven Napolitano, a Loyola Marymount 
University art student. 
</P>
<P>
In Palos Verdes Estates, only one of the three City Council incumbents up for 
reelection this year, Ruth Gralow, filed for office. So far, two challengers 
have filed -- Michael Moody, an insurance broker, and Maurice Commanday, a 
businessman. 
</P>
<P>
In Rolling Hills, the three incumbents facing reelection -- City Council 
members Ginny Leeuwenburgh, Judy Murdoch and Gordana Swanson -- have drawn 
three challengers: management consultant Martin Rosenzweig, retired firefighter 
Frank Hill and community volunteer Ann Carley.

BUSH SEEKS $10 MILLION FOR I-5 CHECKPOINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush's proposed budget for 1991 seeks $10 million toward construction 
of a 16-lane border checkpoint on Interstate 5 at Camp Pendleton that would be 
part of the Administration's plan to stem the influx of illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The money would be used to replace the current checkpoint, also in Camp 
Pendleton but near San Clemente, where local officials have complained about 
chases through their community to catch suspects. 
</P>
<P>
The new checkpoint would also serve as a U.S. Border Patrol station.

AFTER 25-YEAR DELAY, TORRANCE BEGINS WORK ON ARTS CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANET RAE-DUPREE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After 25 years of false starts, the Torrance Cultural Arts Center on Thursday 
finally made it all the way to an official groundbreaking ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Beaming City Council members, shivering as a frigid wind whipped across the 
two-acre construction site, gave speeches of gratitude to more than 200 
community leaders who had gathered to watch the ceremonial tossing of earth 
from gold-painted shovels. 
</P>
<P>
"I really never thought that this day would come," Mayor Katy Geissert admitted 
as she recited the numerous obstacles the $12.2-million complex has faced since 
city leaders first discussed it more than 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a celebration of a dream realized." 
</P>
<P>
Scheduled for completion in August, 1991, the 63,700-square-foot center will 
include a 497-seat theater, a visual arts wing, a performing arts wing, a 
children's art center, a community meeting hall with banquet seating for 300 
and a 15,000-square-foot festival plaza with a small outdoor stage. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Epson America -- which this summer will complete construction of 
its national headquarters within sight of the arts complex -- will pay for an 
authentic Japanese garden, expected to cost as much as $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
Although a city bond measure will pay most of the construction costs, private 
donors have given more than $1 million to the project, including $250,000 from 
developer Frank Torino to build the plaza, $250,000 from development company 
Watt Homes Industries, $500,000 from Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., and $30,000 
raised by the Torrance Youth Council through bake sales and craft booths over a 
seven-year period. 
</P>
<P>
Operators of other South Bay arts facilities said they welcome Torrance's 
project. 
</P>
<P>
"There is always the friendly competition between different cultural entities, 
but we really don't see Torrance . . . . taking dollars out of our pockets," 
said Vincent Beggs, director of the Palos Verdes Arts Center in Rancho Palos 
Verdes. "There is plenty of room for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
Peter Lesnik, director of the Norris Theatre for the Performing Arts in Rolling 
Hills Estates, said the upcoming competition from the Torrance theater "will be 
a healthy thing." 
</P>
<P>
"It's like restaurants -- the more restaurants you find on a block, the more 
people tend to go to each one of them," Lesnik said. "The more theaters and 
culture and entertainment there is in an area, the more likely people will look 
there when they're thinking about spending an evening out." 
</P>
<P>
Lesnik and Bob Stewart, manager of the Torrance complex, said they plan to 
coordinate their bookings so the theaters avoid direct competition. 
</P>
<P>
Plans for the four-building Torrance complex, to be built on a bare patch of 
ground in the northwest corner of the Civic Center, have changed numerous times 
through the years. 
</P>
<P>
It began modestly enough in 1964 with the completion of the city's Joslyn 
Center, a small building directly across from the police station. Originally 
intended to be the first of two arts center phases, Joslyn Center stood alone 
for years as the more pressing needs of streets, libraries and parks drained 
away money that city leaders had hoped to use for build more facilities for the 
arts. 
</P>
<P>
In 1971, hopes for an expanded arts complex were rekindled when sponsors of an 
$18-million parkland bond measure designated $1 million for a community 
theater. But voters rejected the measure and the city's attention turned to 
other things. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a lot of nuts-and-bolts type projects being done," Geissert said. 
"The city had so many pressing needs." 
</P>
<P>
Ten years later, City Council members asked a consultant to study Torrance's 
recreational needs. The consultant recommended building a 400- or 500-seat 
theater, several exercise and arts studios, and a large meeting hall. 
</P>
<P>
The council adopted a cultural arts center master plan and began staging 
community hearings in 1983. For two years, debate over the complex's future 
raged, with one faction insisting that Torrance's cultural facilities were 
woefully inadequate while another argued that the city's money could be better 
spent and that any arts complex should be built entirely with private 
donations. 
</P>
<P>
On May 28, 1985, council members voted 6 to 1, with Councilman Bill Applegate 
opposed, to issue $9.4 million in bonds to pay for the complex. At the time, 
officials predicted that they would stage a groundbreaking within 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
One month away from the scheduled groundbreaking, however, the city received 
construction bids that were more than 60% over budget, leading to the 
architect's dismissal and throwing the project's future into limbo. 
</P>
<P>
Determined council members returned to the drawing board, hired a new architect 
and staged more public hearings. Last month, they accepted a construction bid 
10% over budget. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the start of what we think is going to be the crowning jewel in this 
fabulous city of Torrance," said Applegate, who conducted Thursday's ceremonies 
as chairman of the council's Citizen Enrichment Development Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he saw any irony in being the lead speaker at the groundbreaking 
for a project he voted against, Applegate said he has done what he could to 
support the council majority's decision. 
</P>
<P>
"Once the commitment was made, I wanted it to be the best we could have," he 
said. "And it is."

L.A. REPORT BLAMES PORT OFFICIALS FOR TRIATHLON FAILURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A city review of an aborted attempt in 1988 by the Port of Los Angeles to begin 
holding an annual triathlon faults port officials for poor internal 
communication and inadequate fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
The review will be presented today to the Los Angeles City Council as part of a 
proposal to establish a Los Angeles International Triathlon, which would be 
overseen by the council, not port officials. The proposal is expected to win 
easy approval. 
</P>
<P>
The review, conducted by the city administrative officer, was requested by the 
City Council in July, 1988, shortly after the port canceled its three-event 
endurance race. The port abruptly dropped the race, which Mayor Tom Bradley 
predicted would become "the world's pre-eminent triathlon," less than four 
months before its scheduled debut. 
</P>
<P>
The review concludes that the Board of Harbor Commissioners "appears to have 
acted responsibly" when it allocated $100,000 for the failed event. But it 
criticizes port staff for not holding executive-level briefings on mounting 
problems and for "limited" coordination between the marketing and public 
relations departments. 
</P>
<P>
"Although the (port) had a relatively minor amount of money invested in the 
project, it still had the responsibility to safeguard that money," the review 
states. "Moreover, money alone does not define the importance of a project, 
especially in this case where extensive community outreach and media coverage 
were sought and received." 
</P>
<P>
Lonnie Tang, the port's director of commerce who was responsible for the 
triathlon, did not take issue with the findings in an interview on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it pretty accurately reflects what we did right, and maybe what we did 
wrong," Tang said. "Overall communication on issues, where there appears to be 
a problem, probably could have been brought to the attention of the executive 
side quicker." 
</P>
<P>
The City Council is not expected to take any action on the review, which was 
intended for informational purposes only. But Councilman Nate Holden, who has 
criticized the port's handling of the event in the past, said he will "raise a 
lot of hell" at today's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't show good judgment," Holden said Thursday. "They appropriated 
$100,000, but had no reason to believe they had the organizational structure to 
make the triathlon happen. It was wasting taxpayers' money." 
</P>
<P>
The triathlon was the brainchild of Steven Resnick, the port's marketing 
director, who has since left for private business. Resnick saw the event as a 
glamorous way to attract international attention to the port. The event was to 
consist of a two-kilometer swim at Cabrillo Beach in San Pedro, a 40-kilometer 
bike race through San Pedro and the Palos Verdes Peninsula, and a 10-kilometer 
run through Ports O' Call and the Cabrillo Marina. 
</P>
<P>
The port unveiled plans for the triathlon at a lavish reception in San Pedro in 
January, 1988. The port set up a nonprofit corporation to stage and raise money 
for the event. It also hired a marketing company to raise $200,000 in private 
donations. 
</P>
<P>
But the donations never materialized. By May, most of the $100,000 in seed 
money allocated by the commissioners had been spent, and only $40,000 in 
donations had been collected. At the same time, the port's public relations 
department continued to promote the event, sending out press releases touting 
the event as "the best triathlon in the world." Taken by the promotional 
effort, Triathlete magazine selected it as one of the six "international 
extravaganzas" in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
There were also mixed signals coming from the port. In April, Resnick assured 
the nonprofit group that the port would "fill the gaps" if fund raising fell 
short, but a few weeks later Tang told the same group there would be no more 
port money. 
</P>
<P>
The review by the city administrative officer points to fund raising as one of 
several lessons to be learned from the port's failed effort. The review 
suggests that fund raising should have started earlier and that a professional 
firm -- not a nonprofit group created by the port -- should have overseen the 
event. "This method was successfully used in staging the L.A. Marathon," the 
report states. 
</P>
<P>
The council proposal for an annual city triathlon attempts to avoid the 
pitfalls encountered by the port. According to the proposal, firms interested 
in staging the event for the city must have "demonstrated expertise," reimburse 
the city for expenses and provide "substantial prize money and television 
coverage." 
</P>
<P>
"I think they can learn from our experience," said Tang, the port official. 
"Perhaps the timing is right for the city of Los Angeles to do it."

EDISON'S EXCESS PLANTS 'INEFFICIENT,' REPORT SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Southern California Edison's excess electric generating plants -- which would 
be returned to service after a proposed merger with San Diego Gas &amp; 
Electric -- are described as old, inefficient and undependable in an August, 
1988, SDG&amp;E document released Thursday by order of the state Public 
Utilities Commission. 
</P>
<P>
According to the document, an unidentified SDG&amp;E electrical generation 
expert viewed Edison's "mothballed" power plants, which can generate an 
estimated 900 megawatts of electricity, as "old units, with poor heat 
rates/operating records, which do not make the cut on economics compared to 
adding new generation. 
</P>
<P>
They may also not meet air quality standards." 
</P>
<P>
Utility officials have said that some of the proposed merger's savings would be 
created by returning Edison's excess power plants to service. That move 
supposedly would cut electric rates by delaying construction of costly new 
power plants in SDG&amp;E's service territory. 
</P>
<P>
"This is really is an astounding document," said Michael Shames, executive 
director of Utility Consumers Action Network, a San Diego-based consumer group. 
"When it comes to the deferral of plant generation, they're saying (cost 
savings) really aren't there." 
</P>
<P>
But SDG&amp;E vice president Ed Guiles downplayed the importance of the 
document. 
</P>
<P>
"We probably didn't have a clear, detailed, knowledgeable vision" of Edison's 
power plant plans when the document was prepared, Guiles said. The document was 
apparently prepared just days after Edison surprised SDG&amp;E with an 
uninvited merger bid in August, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time, it was probably questionable (to the staff person preparing the 
document) whether it was reasonable for (Edison's) excess capacity to fill our 
needs," Guiles said. Edison has since drafted a "reasonable plan" that includes 
capital expenditures that would bolster the plants' efficiency and address 
environmental concerns, he said.

MOORE HEAVILY FAVORED DESPITE FBI PROBE; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: A POLITICAL CORRUPTION INQUIRY THAT INCLUDES ASSEMBLYWOMAN GWEN MOORE 
HASN'T ERODED HER SOLID SUPPORT AMONG SOUTH BAY VOTERS. 
</P>

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Assemblywoman Gwen Moore remains the odds-on favorite to win reelection in her 
Westside and South Bay district, even though she has been a target of a 
political corruption investigation by the FBI for at least the last 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
Both Republicans and fellow Democrats said the Los Angeles lawmaker appears 
unbeatable for a seventh term in November's election. 
</P>
<P>
"She is unequivocally strong in her district," said Rod Wright, a Democratic 
campaign consultant and activist. "I don't think anything would change unless 
she was indicted and convicted of a felony." 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Paul A. Woodruff (R-Yucaipa), who oversees elections for the 
Assembly GOP Caucus, said there is a shortage of "high-caliber" Republican 
candidates to run against Moore, partly because of the huge registration edge 
that Democrats hold in her 49th Assembly District. 
</P>
<P>
Even Eric Givens, a Los Angeles Republican who has plans to run against Moore 
for the third time, acknowledges he faces an uphill fight. "It's one of the 
longest shots of the season," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Registrar-Recorder's office reported that since Monday -- when 
filing opened for the June 5 primary election -- only Alice Mae Miles, a Peace 
and Freedom Party candidate, has submitted her papers to run in the 49th 
Assembly District. 
</P>
<P>
Moore, 46, is one of five elected state officials who are targets of the 
federal investigation. She carried two bills for a bogus shrimp company set up 
by the FBI as part of an elaborate sting operation. 
</P>
<P>
The probe became public in August, 1988, when Moore's Capitol office was raided 
by federal agents. The dummy company had contributed money to her campaign 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
Moore has not been charged with any crime and has maintained her innocence. 
When she testified last month as a defense witness at the political corruption 
trial of Sen. Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier), she was told by U.S. Atty. David 
Levi that she remains under active investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The federal probe, which resulted in Montoya's indictment, has thrust the 
low-profile lawmaker into the spotlight more than at any other time in her 
career. 
</P>
<P>
Politicians cite several reasons for her political strength. 
</P>
<P>
They say that with a 4-1 Democratic registration bulge, Moore would have to be 
charged with a crime before a serious, well-financed challenger would emerge to 
oppose her. 
</P>
<P>
Another factor in Moore's favor, they say, is that she is a well-liked lawmaker 
whose career had not previously been touched by scandal. Moreover, she is 
generally given high marks for being responsive to her constituents, from the 
Crenshaw District to Marina del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of that view on both sides of the political aisle, "people give her 
the benefit of the doubt" about the federal investigation, said Rick Taylor, a 
Democratic political consultant. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't think that she's a dishonest person at all," said Los Angeles 
City Councilman Nate Holden, a one-time Democratic state senator. "That's my 
feeling. If anything went wrong, it's not because she knew it." 
</P>
<P>
After testifying at Montoya's trial, Moore told reporters: "I've done nothing 
wrong. I've tried to cooperate with every legitimate investigation. I have 
nothing to hide." Montoya faces 10 counts of extortion, racketeering and 
money-laundering. 
</P>
<P>
Other FBI Targets 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Montoya and Moore, two other lawmakers -- Republican Assemblymen 
Frank Hill of Whittier and Pat Nolan of Glendale -- are also targets of the 
investigation. Former Sen. Paul Carpenter (D-Cypress), now a member of the 
State Board of Equalization, is also a target of the federal probe. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation shadowed Moore's reelection efforts in 1988, but she 
overwhelmingly defeated Givens, a contractor. 
</P>
<P>
During the election, Givens charged that Moore had been too busy representing 
"phony businesses" to pay serious attention to the district, and he called for 
her to step down. 
</P>
<P>
But Moore captured 76.7% of the vote in the district, which includes Leimert 
Park, Crenshaw, Baldwin Hills, Culver City, Ladera Heights, Cheviot Hills, 
Playa del Rey, Marina del Rey and parts of Westchester and Palms. 
</P>
<P>
Moore is not the first California lawmaker to campaign with the cloud of a 
federal investigation hanging over her head. In 1986, Assemblyman Mike Roos 
(D-Los Angeles) won reelection, even though his ties to fireworks magnate W. 
Patrick Moriarty were being investigated by the U.S. Justice Department. In 
1987, federal prosecutors decided not to try Roos in connection with a 
profitable investment arranged by Moriarty. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, the current investigation does not appear to have had a significant 
impact on Assemblyman Hill's political clout. Hill is given a good chance of 
winning a special state Senate election scheduled for Tuesday. "I think he has 
the respect of everyone up here," said Ken Maddy (R-Fresno), the Senate 
minority leader. "For those of us who felt free to endorse him, we are 
embracing the idea that he's innocent until proven guilty." 
</P>
<P>
Moore's supporters take a similar stance about the assemblywoman. 
</P>
<P>
Kerman Maddox, a former assistant to Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, asserted 
that if anyone runs against Moore and "uses the sting, it's an exercise in 
futility. It will mean nothing, simply because she has a good reputation. . . . 
People seem to think she got caught up in this because of bad staff work." 
</P>
<P>
At Montoya's trial, Moore testified that she agreed to carry the legislation 
because officials from the dummy company said it would create 35 to 40 jobs, 
most of them for minorities and "low-entry level people." 
</P>
<P>
Kept Some Money 
</P>
<P>
Moore also testified that in 1986 she returned one $5,000 contribution from 
federal undercover agents because it appeared to be a bribe. But she told 
reporters she kept $2,000 given her in 1986 because the undercover operatives 
attended one of her fund-raisers. "They bought tickets, they came to my 
fund-raiser. They ate my food and so I kept the money," Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
Tyrone Netters, then a Moore aide, helped steer two Moore bills to benefit the 
dummy company through the Legislature. The day after the Legislature gave final 
approval in 1988 to one of the bills, Netters, an unsuccessful candidate for a 
local utility board, reported receiving a $2,000 contribution to his campaign 
from the dummy company. 
</P>
<P>
William Julian, a spokesman for the assemblywoman, said Moore does not want to 
elaborate at this time on her views about the case. 
</P>
<P>
But Moore has voiced optimism about her reelection effort, saying that her 
constituents have been supportive of her during the investigation. "I am 
definitely running," Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
Moore has lived in the area around her district since she was 2 years old. A 
former member of the Los Angeles Community College Board of Trustees, she was 
first elected to the Assembly in 1978. The contest drew several other black 
candidates and divided loyalties in the black community. Moore had support from 
the Democratic political organization of Los Angeles Reps. Howard L. Berman 
(D-Panorama City) and Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
Moore is regarded as a low-profile liberal who is loyal to Assembly Speaker 
Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) but is not part of his inner circle. A year ago, 
in a move seen as a vote of confidence, Brown named Moore as the Democratic 
whip to help shepherd legislation for Assembly Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
As chairwoman of the Assembly Utilities and Commerce Committee, Moore wields 
clout in overseeing telephone and other utility rates. One of her best-known 
measures was a 1984 law to ensure that home telephone service remained 
affordable for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
Speaker Brown this week called Moore "one of the best, if not the best" chairs 
of an Assembly committee. Brown said that until he named her to head the 
committee in 1983, he "never knew she had the talent. . . . This woman is 
awesome" in terms of knowing about utilities and negotiating compromises on 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
But others question the way her office has performed, especially in the way 
bills for the dummy shrimp company were handled. 
</P>
<P>
Now 'More Prudent' 
</P>
<P>
Citing the role of Moore's aide, Netters, in the legislation, another 
Democratic colleague, who asked not to be identified, said: "I still feel she 
was duped by staff. . . . By God, it just looks to me that she was a victim. . 
. . " 
</P>
<P>
Robert Jacobson, who left Moore's staff last year, acknowledged that the 
legislation on behalf of the dummy shrimp company "simply wasn't just that big 
a deal" for Moore's office. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I have poor staff," Moore said. "We run as tight a ship as 
anyone. What happened could happen to anyone in the Legislature. It is not a 
reflection of poor staff." 
</P>
<P>
Jacobson said that partly because of the FBI investigation, Moore streamlined 
her office operation. "For one thing," he said, "we became much better 
organized in the office, kept better track of documentation . . . to avoid 
falling in this trap again." 
</P>
<P>
A Democratic legislative staffer, who asked not to be identified, said that in 
the past Moore had a reputation for introducing legislation "without paying a 
whole lot of attention to the bills," especially those not dealing with the 
regulation of utilities. Now, he said, "she's probably more prudent about bills 
she carries." 
</P>
<P>
Even before Moore testified at Montoya's trial, Assemblywoman Sally Tanner 
(D-Baldwin Park) said "it's been pretty hard" for Moore to constantly read 
"negative things" about herself. 
</P>
<P>
Tanner, Moore's seatmate on the Assembly floor, acknowledged that the 
investigation has been "agonizing for her. It's been a very traumatic thing for 
her." But Tanner maintained that it has not impacted Moore's performance. "She 
hasn't let it affect her at all," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Until the federal investigation was disclosed, Moore was mentioned in 
Sacramento as a possible successor to Rep. Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles) if 
he decided to run for the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors or some other 
office. Other lawmakers say it is unclear whether the investigation will pose a 
roadblock if Moore ever seeks higher office. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the investigation has not changed the way Republican strategists view 
the odds on Moore's winning reelection. 
</P>
<P>
"The district is very solidly Democratic," said Republican Assemblyman 
Woodruff. "I think it would be hard to convince the voters of that area that 
she hasn't been voting . . . the party line." 
</P>
<P>
District Is Democratic 
</P>
<P>
Woodruff maintained that voters in the 49th District almost always vote 
Democratic. "If Ronald Reagan or George Bush or George Deukmejian cannot carry 
Gwen Moore's district," Woodruff said, it would be difficult for an unknown GOP 
candidate to beat Moore. 
</P>
<P>
Without commenting on the FBI investigation of Moore, Assemblyman Tom 
McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks) complained that an Assembly member "could be 
convicted of an ax murder three days before the election and still win 55% of 
the vote." 
</P>
<P>
Despite her popularity, some elected officials question whether Moore has done 
enough for their cities. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't see a lot that she does particularly for Culver City," said Culver 
City Mayor Jozelle Smith, who said she is still upset that in April, 1988, 
Moore mounted a last-minute mail and telephone campaign on behalf of three 
council candidates. "I was angry about the interference . . . in our 
elections," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
But Ronni Cooper, president of the Ladera Heights Civic Assn., said Moore is 
extremely responsive to her group's needs. She cited Moore's help about a year 
ago in blocking construction of a Southern California Rapid Transit District 
bus yard in her community. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think her credibility has been hurt in our community" by the FBI 
investigation, Cooper said. "Every time we have needed her help . . . she has 
been there for us."

APPEALING THE RULING ON REDONDO PIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A recent news article (Times, Jan. 25) reported that Superior Court "Judge" 
Abraham Gorenfeld has ruled that Redondo Beach must rebuild its damaged pier. 
</P>
<P>
I phoned the Torrance courthouse and learned that "Judge" Gorenfeld simply does 
not exist. There is however a "Commissioner" Gorenfeld. 
</P>
<P>
The difference between a judge and a commissioner, though mainly technical, is 
very significant in view of the findings that were made, and the reasoning used 
to support them. 
</P>
<P>
If Commissioner Gorenfeld had done his own homework completely, I'm certain 
that he'd have realized that current problems are the direct result of far too 
many "expedited" decisions in the past. Decisions that were strongly influenced 
by the plaintiffs in this very case, or their representatives. These hurried 
decisions have ultimately been proven to be terribly contrary to the best 
interests of the public, who must now pay the cost of correcting them. 
</P>
<P>
One must ask if Gorenfeld did any research on this issue himself, or whether he 
simply relied upon his law clerks' opinions and issued them as his own. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Gorenfeld relied on repairs voluntarily made by the city in 1968 
as setting a precedent requiring the city to fully rebuild, rather than simply 
repairing. What he apparently overlooked is that the city has learned a lot 
more since 1968 as a result of very costly lessons, and its thought process is 
more mature now with respect to the pier. We have learned that the pier and 
harbor is an extremely hazardous location. We don't want to repeat past 
mistakes. We don't want to see any more people die because of (poor) planning 
or construction, and under the current leases we can't require more stringent 
standards without fear of being sued by the lessees, in order to make us pay 
the costs of better safety. 
</P>
<P>
The impacts of this decision may well carry on after all of our lifetimes. If 
we accept it, we will be forced to keep rebuilding the pier every time nature 
damages or destroys it, without regard to the overriding concerns of safety. 
</P>
<P>
I strongly urge all council members to support an appeal to the commissioner's 
decision. I especially urge council members Terry Ward, Ron Cawdry and Kay 
Horrell to put their predisposition of "pier support" aside, in the best 
interests of Redondo Beach citizens. 
</P>
<P>
If we win an appeal, and subsequently choose to rebuild a pier, we can 
negotiate new, safer terms and leases that protect us as a condition of 
reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
We won't even have that option if we accept the commissioner's ruling.

Editor's Note: Gorenfeld's official title is "Judge Pro Tem," which is 
synonymous with "Commissioner." The title means that Gorenfeld has been 
selected by the presiding judge of the superior court to sit temporarily as a 
judge, at 85% of a judge's salary. However, in the pier case, as in most other 
cases, both parties stipulated that Gorenfeld would sit as judge. Hence the 
title.

RANCHO P.V. NEEDS TAX-FREE SOLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It seems to me that the question at hand is: Where is the money going to come 
from to keep up roads, parks, trails, and general expenses, without taxing the 
residents of Rancho Palos Verdes? The overzealous supporters of no-development 
once again turn in desperation to character assassination as their only line of 
defense. If they would spend as much time thinking of ways to generate revenue 
to get the bills paid, as they do trying to keep these tinder-dry hills from 
becoming revenue-producing, beautifully landscaped places that people could 
enjoy, their service to humanity would be greatly enhanced. 
</P>
<P>
The council needs a Planning Commission that is just that, a Planning 
Commission. One that will see the needs of Rancho Palos Verdes and act as a 
pilot to lead the way to a better community that is fiscally sound, serving the 
general needs of our beautiful city. 
</P>
<P>
As I have said before, if you have a better plan than a golf course and a hotel 
to produce real money, let's hear it -- then people of reason can get behind 
these plans, and let's quit the hype of council bashing.

COUNTY WARNS AGAINST EATING LOCAL SHELLFISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GAW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Overpopulation of the San Diego area is the prime suspect in the contamination 
of mussels, clams, scallops and oysters that led the county to issue an 
advisory not to eat bivalve shellfish picked up along the county's coast. 
</P>
<P>
"We just have too much sewage, too much runoff, too many pets that are putting 
their waste on lawns, and all this accumulation is finally coming home to 
roost," said Gary Stephany, deputy director of the county's Environmental 
Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
Stephany said no reports of illness because of shellfish contaminated by fecal 
coliform bacteria have been received but such illnesses often go unreported 
since the side effects are similar to a common stomach flu. Side effects 
include a mild to severe upset stomach and diarrhea, Stephany said. 
</P>
<P>
The advisory, issued Wednesday, does not apply to shrimp, crabs, lobsters or 
other crustaceans, nor does it apply to commercially sold shellfish in 
restaurants or markets. State and federal authorities inspect commercial 
shellfish, while crustaceans have feeding systems different from bivalve 
shellfish, Stephany said. 
</P>
<P>
Seafarms West in Carlsbad, the only U.S. commercial grower of bivalve shellfish 
south of Santa Barbara, has been filtering and disinfecting the water used by 
its shellfish since the state last June found high levels of fecal coliform 
bacteria, according to state health officials. 
</P>
<P>
But the finding at Seafarms West prompted county health officials to test 
mussels along the rest of the county's coast for fecal coliform, a bacterium 
found in sewage. 
</P>
<P>
The county sampled mussels from Oceanside to San Diego Bay in November. Because 
bivalves have similar feeding systems, county officials presume clams, scallops 
and oysters are also contaminated. It was the first such test ever conducted by 
the county because of its high cost. 
</P>
<P>
The state then conducted tests by putting uncontaminated mussels in San Diego 
County waters and retesting them. Those tests in December verified the county's 
finding of high levels of bacteria in the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Stephany said the county will step up its testing and confer with sewer 
agencies "to map out a plan to find out exactly what the cause is." 
</P>
<P>
"The best thing that we can do is reclaim the sewage and the water and up the 
treatment of sewage for irrigation purposes, and maybe save a lot of the water 
that we do have," Stephany said. 
</P>
<P>
Stephany said bacteria levels are not high enough to hurt swimmers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still safe to swim, from our standpoint," he said. "An occasional gulp of 
sea water if you're jumping waves won't make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
Officials at San Diego's Point Loma Waste Water Treatment plant agreed that 
"the beaches have always been safe for body contact." 
</P>
<P>
Frequent tests of the bacterial water quality at nine shore stations from 
Imperial Beach to Ocean Beach have consistently shown "excellent water 
quality," especially in the beach areas, said Patty Vainik, senior marine 
biologist at the city's treatment plant. 
</P>
<P>
But the waste water in the ocean comes from many sources, not just sewage 
treatment plants, Vainik said. 
</P>
<P>
"The more we pave Southern California, every bit of rain that falls, every bit 
of irrigation that we do will be washed into the ocean, the bay and the 
estuaries," Vainik said.

LEGAL TOOL IN SCHOOLS RIFT CITED; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: PARENTS FIGHTING THE YEAR-ROUND SCHOOL PROPOSAL SAY THE DISTRICT 
FAILED TO FOLLOW STATE LAW. A SPECIAL COUNSEL FOR THE SUPERINTENDENT DISAGREES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Some parents fighting the conversion of 109 Los Angeles schools to year-round 
schedules say they have found legal grounds to block the proposed changes, a 
former school board candidate said Thursday. But a school board attorney 
disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Romey, who has been working with other parents opposed to year-round 
schools, said the Los Angeles Unified School District failed to give proper 
notice of the proposed changes, which would begin this summer. 
</P>
<P>
'There is a good, legal tool to fight this," said Romey, who has run twice for 
the West San Fernando Valley seat on the school board. 
</P>
<P>
The California Education Code requires districts intending to convert schools 
from traditional to year-round schedules to publish those plans in a newspaper 
advertisement before November of the year preceding the changes. 
</P>
<P>
But Richard Mason, special counsel to Los Angeles school Supt. Leonard Britton, 
said the code does not apply to the district's proposals. 
</P>
<P>
Mason said the district is exempt from the code requirement because no Los 
Angeles students will be required to attend year-round school. Parents who 
oppose year-round schools can apply for transfers to schools with traditional 
schedules, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mason also said the district may be exempt from the provision because it 
printed notices in 1987, when the board first considered changing schools to 
year-round schedules. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph R. Symkowick, general counsel for the state Department of Education, 
said he is uncertain whether the code requirement applies to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
But in general, Symkowick said, "anyone looking at the case would consider not 
just the letter of the law but its intent, which is to allow for parent input." 
</P>
<P>
Charles Ballinger, executive director of the National Assn. for Year-Round 
Education, a nonprofit group supporting year-round schools, said he agreed with 
Mason's argument. "But none of this has ever gone to court," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Britton has recommended that all schools in the district convert to some form 
of year-round schedule by summer, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Parents opposed to year-round schools say the plan will require students to 
attend classes in stifling heat and will disrupt vacations and child-care 
arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
The school board is expected to make a decision Monday on the controversial 
proposal.

DEATH PENALTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I take exception to the continuing use of the phrase, "The death penalty is no 
deterrent." 
</P>
<P>
Can you name another crime other than murder where the sentence -- justice -- 
is not carried out because it is not a deterrent to further crime? 
</P>
<P>
The death penalty is not supposed to be a deterrent. It has two purposes: 
punishment and the removal from society of a dangerous criminal. 
</P>
<P>
We talk of the Constitution and our obligation to act by its rules, yet we call 
the death penalty "cruel and unusual punishment." When the Constitution was 
written, that penalty was not considered cruel and unusual. There were far more 
inhumane kinds of punishment in those days. 
</P>
<P>
There are two phrases that come to mind: an eye for an eye and let the 
punishment fit the crime. If that latter phrase were adopted, that beast who 
cut off a young girl's arms after raping her would have the same thing done to 
him. 
</P>
<P>
One of the arguments against the death penalty is that sometimes innocent 
people are put to death. Why not give those accused who maintain their 
innocence an important option: the right to permit the use of truth serum, 
polygraph tests and/or hypnotism. These tests would almost perfectly establish 
their innocence -- or guilt.

HOMELESS GAIN ANOTHER ADVOCATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN ALLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The homeless were invited to join celebrities Wednesday night as guests 
converged at the California Afro-American Museum in Exposition Park for the 
inaugural event of a new group calling itself Artists Against Homelessness. 
After a reception that showcased artworks by the homeless, an entertainment 
program followed, featuring skits, poetry, speeches, songs and dramatic 
readings. 
</P>
<P>
AAH is the latest Hollywood-based organization to declare that homelessness is 
not good. How does it differ from other groups? "We include homeless people on 
our board of directors," said co-founder Tom Boyd. "We are not a political 
organization, but a consciousness-raising organization," added Bill Duke, who 
directed the show. 
</P>
<P>
Among the crowd: Danny Glover, Louis Gossett Jr., Kate Mulgrew, Katey Sagal, 
Ana Alicia, Rita Coolidge, Beverly Todd, Taurean Blacque, Rain Pryor and Bonnie 
Bramlett. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to know what's going on with the homeless, ask me," said D. J. 
Walker, a homeless man who addressed the crowd, adding, "When you all leave 
here, you're going home." 
</P>
<P>
Organizers claimed that, unlike other groups, they were welcoming the homeless. 
They backed it up by taking donations instead of selling tickets and by not 
serving an embarrassingly lavish buffet. Limousines were conspicuously absent 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone may be equal, but there was still a separate celebrity entrance, and 
guest Gerry Power complained of being asked to move when he tried to sit down 
in an unmarked seat -- seems he strayed into a celebrity-only area.

MAKING BOOK ON LITERACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The centerpieces were the giveaway. Rather than the usual eruptions of imported 
out-of-season flowers, each table was topped with a leather-bound tome by an 
author such as William Shakespeare, George Eliot, Edith Wharton or Pearl S. 
Buck. 
</P>
<P>
The books were propped on mini-word processors with the words "Family Literacy" 
on the screen. 
</P>
<P>
The theme of the annual Town Hall of California dinner was reading and writing 
-- in today's parlance, literacy. About 850 people representing business, 
education and the arts filled the Century Plaza Hotel's Los Angeles Ballroom 
Wednesday night to honor Jean Sharley Taylor, retired associate editor of the 
Los Angeles Times and originator of The Times' 2-year-old Reading Lab, which 
offers literacy skills to employees, their families and the downtown community. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as they stepped from their cars, guests were invited to inspect the 
latest expansion of Taylor's vision, a New Age version of the little red school 
house: a mobile reading lab equipped with six computer work stations. "We just 
got it today," Barbara Neder, Reading Lab administrator, said of the large 
white van that will serve youth and adults in Los Angeles through different 
social service programs. 
</P>
<P>
First Lady Barbara Bush served as the evening's honorary chair, and the timing 
of her husband's State of the Union address earlier that evening was lost on no 
one. "That this event is the same night that the President made one of his 
national goals to have all adults become literate by the year 2000 is 
symbolic," said Leonard Britton, superintendent of schools for the Los Angeles 
Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
"The United States is in dire, dire danger of becoming a third-rate nation 
unless we catch up," said attorney Richard J. Riordan, co-chairman of the event 
with Tom Johnson, vice chairman of the Times Mirror Co.

A CUT BACK TO A DISTANT DECADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PADDY CALISTRO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hairstylist Phillip Wilson got fed up hearing that women couldn't manage their 
hairstyles. "I'll never be able make it look like this," they complained about 
their perfect salon 'dos. The problem wasn't with the women, it was with the 
haircuts, determined Wilson, the international artistic director of L'Anza, an 
Irwindale-based hair-care products firm. 
</P>
<P>
The obvious solution, he says, is to cut hair the way it grows rather than 
trying to force it into a style -- what he refers to as "the no-tension cut." 
</P>
<P>
It's not a new technique. It was popular in France from about 1918 to 1924. But 
it fell out of fashion and Wilson has found that many hairdressers have 
forgotten it. 
</P>
<P>
Many stylists now rely exclusively on the straight-edged, geometric cut, he 
finds. "Since 1966 when Vidal Sassoon introduced the geometric cut, we've been 
cutting style into hair, rather than letting the hair itself determine its best 
style," he explains. 
</P>
<P>
For a geometric cut, the usual technique is to hold hair straight and taut, and 
snip it into the desired shape. But for his no-tension cut, Wilson lets the 
hair hang naturally and he cuts by following the natural growth patterns. A 
complete cut takes only about 10 minutes. To take hair from long to short, he 
uses masking tape to secure the hair in position, and the tape is his guide as 
he cuts. Once the tape is removed, he makes minor adjustments and the haircut 
is complete. 
</P>
<P>
"When hair is cut the way it grows, it always falls into place," the 
37-year-old stylist says. "I've tested the look with women who swim, who run, 
who work at a hectic pace. The hair always springs back." 
</P>
<P>
Other stylists have started to try out the cut at their salons. Robert Sanchez 
of Moda Salon in Escondido says: "The cut works by itself. You don't need to 
use a lot of styling products with it and clients like that." Gill 
Brookes-Jones of Taboo in Los Angeles says clients like the soft, natural look 
the cut achieves. In the past year, Wilson has taught the method to more than 
100,000 stylists at seminars in the United States, Europe and Asia.

A GOOD GRADE FOR UNIFORMITY; 
</P>
<P>
STYLE: VAUGHN STREET ELEMENTARY SCHOOL BECOMES L.A.'S FIRST TO MAKE REGIMENTAL 
DRESSING AN OPTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first dress uniform adopted by a Los Angeles public school is being 
introduced today at the Vaughn Street Elementary School in the city of San 
Fernando. The burgundy and gray plaid skirts and jumpers for girls and the gray 
pants and white shirts for boys are not mandatory, they are merely available to 
any parent who wishes to purchase them. 
</P>
<P>
A parents group at Vaughn Street School implemented the uniform option for the 
same reason that parents of children from the Good Shepherd Lutheran School, a 
private school in Inglewood, made uniforms mandatory last year -- for their 
children's safety. Students from both schools had been harassed by gang members 
because many times the color of their clothes represented the color of a rival 
gang. In choosing the new uniforms, school parents avoided red and blue, the 
colors of the Bloods and the Crips, two powerful local gangs. 
</P>
<P>
Dianna Munatones, the director of public information for the Los Angeles Public 
Schools, maintains that the school district will not instate a general uniform 
policy for all public schools, but parents can choose to organize and develop a 
policy for their children's school, as long as it is not mandatory that 
students wear them. 
</P>
<P>
Parents are more receptive to the idea than students, in the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
"We win the students over with shorts," said Elena Mills Mandin, president of 
Sue Mills uniform company in Inglewood. She has discovered that girls get more 
interested in uniforms if their options include shorts or culottes that look 
like miniskirts. 
</P>
<P>
Uniform styles have not changed considerably since the days when parents of 
today's students wore them. Jumpers and pleated skirts, blazers and gray pants 
are still the mainstays. Today, fabrics usually contain a high polyester 
content. 
</P>
<P>
Some newer options do exist, however. Pastel shirtwaist dresses, cotton 
cardigans, and polo shirts are available to broaden students' wardrobes. And 
there are numerous choices of colors. 
</P>
<P>
The girls who attend Santa Margarita High School in Rancho Santa Margarita in 
Orange County have seven different skirt and pant styles, and four different 
tops to choose from, in different colors. The boys have pants in six styles and 
shirts in three varieties available, in varying colors. At the Buckley School 
in Sherman Oaks the high school girls have a choice of six different sweaters. 
</P>
<P>
Some uniform companies sell fabric by the yard to enterprising student 
seamstresses who want to make their own garments. 
</P>
<P>
In order to service their school accounts, the five school uniform companies 
located in the Los Angeles metropolitan area offer a range of shopping options. 
They have retail stores that are open year-round, and facilities for supplying 
uniforms by mail order. They will also go to the schools several times each 
year and set up a mobile store. They consider themselves manufacturers though, 
not fashion design companies. 
</P>
<P>
Schools that change from a freewheeling dress code to uniforms don't always 
find the going smooth. There is usually a vociferous minority of parents who 
object. The complaint heard most often is that a rigid uniform policy stifles a 
young person's creative expression. The same parents who voice that argument, 
however, have been known to apologize and reconsider their stance once they see 
the benefits of uniform dressing. 
</P>
<P>
Some educators have also been adamant about their disapproval of uniforms, at 
first. 
</P>
<P>
Jerome Reinertson, the principal of Good Shepherd School, resisted the idea of 
uniforms while his school debated the issue for almost a decade. "If someone 
had told me seven years ago my students would be wearing uniforms, I would have 
thought it was a joke," he said. Reinertson believed that the creativity and 
individuality children expressed through their clothing should be inviolate. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't look at things the same way now. The real concerns of safety and 
economics far outweigh the old issues," he says. "If we are to provide the best 
education for these children then we have to provide an environment where they 
feel safe and let nothing deter them from getting that education." 
</P>
<P>
By removing the external coding that status fashion labels provide, many 
educators have found that uniforms can serve as the great equalizer. Children 
who are dressed alike have to depend on wits and intelligence to make their 
creative mark. 
</P>
<P>
The Vaughn Street School is just the first Los Angeles public school to unveil 
a uniform. In the past several months Bill Watson, owner of Kid's Limited, the 
company that is supplying Vaughn Street School with its uniforms, has been 
contacted by representatives from four other public schools in the area, all of 
them interested in uniforms.

ALBUMS NOT 'AUTOMATIC' FOR JESUS-MARY CHAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Normally when a rock band goes nearly three years without a new album, there's 
a tangible reason for the delay: label problems, personnel changes, perhaps a 
timeout to allow for solo projects. 
</P>
<P>
Not so with the Jesus and Mary Chain, whose long-awaited follow-up to 1987's 
"Darklands," the critically acclaimed "Automatic," finally came out last 
Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
They just took their sweet time. 
</P>
<P>
"That's how long it took us to make this record," said Jim Reid, the co-leader 
-- with brother William -- of the dark, emotionally charged British rock group 
that will appear tonight at the California Theater downtown. 
</P>
<P>
"And, instead of worrying why it took so long, it worries me more that other 
people do it so quickly," he said. "In the music business, 99% of the bands 
release an album every year, and that makes me feel suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
"It's impossible that they can sustain the same songwriting rate over such a 
short period of time, and that raises suspicions that they just release albums 
to make money. I think everyone should take more time; it would be a lot more 
healthy." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the Jesus and Mary Chain's new album -- so long in the making -- was 
well worth the wait, Reid unabashedly maintains. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't mean to be big-headed when I say it's better than anybody else's. All 
I'm saying is it's better than anybody else's to my taste," he said. "And 
that's because we took the time to do something different, just as we've tried 
to do with all our albums. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no point in repeating yourself. I mean, if the Beatles had done 15 
albums exactly like their first, we never would have had a 'Sergeant Pepper's' 
or a 'White Album.' 
</P>
<P>
"Bands should be encouraged to make something new. Every album should be 
different than the one before it -- it should perfectly suit your own taste, it 
should completely satisfy you -- and sometimes that takes a little extra time." 
</P>
<P>
This perfectionism, this desire to constantly outdo themselves, is 
understandable, given the pressure the Jesus and Mary Chain felt after the 
release of their brilliant 1985 debut. "Psychocandy" was hailed as a musical 
masterpiece, a compelling mix of beautiful melodies, melancholy themes and 
brutal guitar feedback. 
</P>
<P>
Several times in the British rock press it was even suggested that the group 
should split up because they'd never be able to come up with another record 
anywhere near that good. 
</P>
<P>
So, when it came time to cut a second album, the band approached the studio 
with a fair amount of trepidation. 
</P>
<P>
"It was real scary, because everybody was either saying we couldn't or we 
shouldn't," Reid recalled. "It was a nervous time; the band hadn't been 
together that long, and to be faced with that kind of pressure was unnerving. 
</P>
<P>
"So, when we started working on the second album, we purposely set out to make 
it different than 'Psychocandy.' And, in retrospect, maybe we made it too 
different -- you should always go into the studio with an idea of how an album 
should be, not how it shouldn't be, and that's the mistake we made." 
</P>
<P>
"Darklands" certainly is different, with a lot more polish -- and a lot less 
feedback -- than "Psychocandy." The brothers Reid subsequently toured the 
United States, Europe, Australia and even Russia, all the while writing songs 
and rethinking their musical direction once again. In 1988 Warner Brothers 
Records released an album of odds and ends, "Barbed Wire Kisses," that, despite 
its haphazard assembly, wound up on several critics' Top 10 lists that year. 
</P>
<P>
The band finally returned to the studio last summer, and the result is 
"Automatic," which many critics consider their best yet. Wrote one: "The Jesus 
and Mary Chain still works the same few rock archetypes -- blues, Velvet 
Underground two-chord rise and fall, Stooges' grunge riffs, Ramones' bubble-gum 
punk -- and this time, the Reids really make it sing and surge and soar." 
</P>
<P>
"With 'Automatic,' we were a lot more confident," Reid said. "We had gotten 
over the hard part, and what we tried to do was get back into the raw, 
energetic sound we had on 'Psychocandy,' but not in the same way." 
</P>
<P>
Jim and William Reid were born and raised in Glasgow, Scotland. "Our father 
worked in a factory and is now unemployed," Jim Reid said, "and our mother 
worked in a fish-and-chips shop." 
</P>
<P>
While growing up, he said, he and his brother "listened to all the glam stuff, 
T-Rex and Slade, and then when punk rock came along, that had the most impact 
on us." 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that always stayed with me," he added, "was the whole punk idea that 
anybody could make a record if they really wanted to, even if they weren't 
musicians. 
</P>
<P>
"So, when we were still in our teens, we began making experimental music and 
cutting demos. We used to use an echo box, hit things with a hammer, use some 
obscene words and add a synthesizer drone. 
</P>
<P>
"It took us a long while to realize that that wasn't going to pay. If we were 
going to make our mark, we were going to have to write songs." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the brothers Reid didn't begin writing songs until after they had 
finished high school. 
</P>
<P>
"We were bored and (unemployed), and when you're in that situation you either 
force your way out or you go under," Reid said. "And, in our case, our way out 
was through music. 
</P>
<P>
"In the beginning, we merely wanted to entertain ourselves, to make the best of 
a bad situation. We had no idea we could actually make money at it." 
</P>
<P>
But make money they did, moving to London in the early 1980s and immersing 
themselves in the pub scene. On the strength of an independently released 
single, "Upside Down," they landed a recording contract with Britain's feisty 
Blanco y Negro Records in early 1985. 
</P>
<P>
And, after scoring several U.K. chart hits that summer, they cut "Psychocandy," 
which by year's end had been released in the United States.

MELODRAMA: WAS THIS 'STELLA,' A LOONY MIDLER REMAKE, REALLY NECESSARY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"It's a great life if you don't weaken," intones Bette Midler as the noble 
heroine of "Stella" (citywide). Ugh. 
</P>
<P>
Do we really need to be put through another version of "Stella Dallas"? Is this 
the vehicle that Bette Midler thinks will reclaim her serious-actress status? 
If so, she's greatly misunderstood her gifts, which stand in raucous, 
subversive contrast to everything this sudsy weepie represents. Directed by 
John Erman, freighted with a musical score of soaring banality, this 20-year 
saga of an uneducated, working-class single mother who sacrifices everything to 
give her daughter the chance she never had is so recklessly shameless it verges 
on camp parody. 
</P>
<P>
No one involved in "Stella" is quite in on the joke, however, with the possible 
exception of screenwriter Robert Getchell who, based on such past scripts as 
"Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore" and "Bound for Glory," surely must recognize 
the difference between honest sentiment and slop. There's a giddy, 
what-the-hell quality about a few of his sequences, as if he had decided to 
throw caution to the perfumed winds and indulge his affection for the excesses 
of '40s women's films. 
</P>
<P>
I'll say this much for "Stella." It's got more loony oomph than all those Joan 
Crawford/Lana Turner vehicles that it superficially resembles. It plays out our 
own giddy fantasies of those films in much the same way that the great Carol 
Burnett movie tear-jerker parodies on TV did, but without the redeeming saving 
grace of wit. The movie is crazy without knowing it. 
</P>
<P>
When we first spot Stella, she's tending bar in a rough, chummy dive in 
Watertown, N.Y. Nursing a beer in that bar is Stephen Dallas (Stephen Collins), 
a handsome, well-to-do medical resident specializing in kidney diseases. (The 
filmmakers missed a camp metaphorical moment by not making him a cardiologist.) 
Turned on by Stella's mock striptease atop the bar, he ends up convincing her 
to reassess her opinion of "fancy" men and have dinner with him. A giddy 
dalliance follows. So does a baby daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Stella, you understand, has already rejected what appeared to be a sincere 
offer by the kidney doctor to make her an honest woman, or failing that, 
support her and the child. (That's why there's no "Dallas" affixed to this 
"Stella.") As a result, she has to scrimp and slave to raise her daughter (the 
lovely Trini Alvarado) solo. We're supposed to regard her rejection of Stephen 
as righteous but, really, it's a bonehead decision, particularly since Stephen 
is portrayed as a pillar of virtue. Stella snubs him because if she didn't, 
there wouldn't be a movie. 
</P>
<P>
Stella's character suggests psychological entanglements that have no way of 
being addressed in a movie this ding-a-ling-y. Her obsessive single-motherhood 
has a self-punishing quality. So does her walling off of any subsequent suitors 
-- and we're talking 20 years here. Despite her mock stripteases and sensual 
heft, this Stella is basically a prig. She lives to toil and suffer. 
</P>
<P>
We're cued to recognize all that suffering as noble rather than masochistic. 
And that's where the movie really turns into a crock. Self-sacrifice makes 
Stella angelic. She mostly makes her living selling beauty supplies door to 
door, and the irony is not lost on us: She may look like a rumply harridan on 
the outside, but inside she's beauty incarnate. Does this dumb dichotomy 
explain why the film makers have gone to such great lengths to make Bette 
Midler look so unappetizing? From some angles, she might be Ben Franklin in a 
blond fright wig. 
</P>
<P>
The uglification serves another dubious purpose. It's a quick-read visual aid 
to class consciousness. In the fluffy never-never land of "Stella," where one 
registers the progress of the decades only by the pop tunes on the sound track, 
the working class is peopled exclusively by chubby louts and punks. Even 
Stella's mainstay buddy, the good-natured, alcoholic Ed Munn (John Goodman), 
spends most of his time barging in on her, stomach first. The film makers are 
so concerned that we recognize Stella's passion to rid her daughter of poverty 
that they turn poverty into a species of dementia. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Stephen and the book-publisher whiz (Marsha Mason) he intends to 
marry are impeccably groomed, inside and out. They are what money was made for 
-- to savor the finer things. The film makers can't even allow for the 
possibility that Stella might have it in her to appreciate those finer things 
for herself. Early on, Stephen in tow, she disrupts a classical voice recital 
by literally throttling herself with boredom; later on, the film scores points 
against her by pointing up her ignorance of Harold Pinter. (She buys tickets to 
a Pinter play for Christmas Eve!) 
</P>
<P>
The upwardly mobile pretensions of this film are, to put it gently, unseemly. 
The last "Stella Dallas" was filmed with Barbara Stanwyck in 1937. America may 
now be more class stratified than it's been since the '30s, so there is, I 
suppose, a mite of justification in doing an updated remake. But the class 
consciousness of "Stella," just like its weepy, wronged-woman moralism, seems 
extravagantly musty. 
</P>
<P>
Bette Midler may have misjudged her talents in "Stella," but the other 
possibility is that she's indulging that awful, moony, bag-lady-on-a-park-bench 
side of her that she showed off in the Magic Lady sequence in her one-woman 
concert movie "Divine Madness." Midler may believe that being a great actress 
means devolving into a heap of tears but, as the ineffable "Beaches" already 
demonstrated, she doesn't make a very convincing suffering lady. She'll never 
be Joan Crawford, and why should she want to be? Midler, in "The Rose," gave 
what is probably the most startling and voracious debut performance I've ever 
seen in a film. There's real fire in her torch songs if only she'd light the 
flame.

'MY LEFT FOOT' IS TOUGH-MINDED, UNSENTIMENTAL AND BRILLIANT; 
</P>
<P>
FILM: DANIEL DAY-LEWIS SEIZES THE ROLE OF HANDICAPPED WRITER, POET AND PAINTER 
CHRISTY BROWN, MAKING VIEWERS LOOK BEYOND HIS WHEELCHAIR AND INTO HIS SOUL.

Who goes to the movies for moral uplift? You want moral uplift, go to the Ice 
Capades. So don't think that seeing "My Left Foot" (at Horton Plaza) wins you 
some kind of spiritual merit badge. This one you see for the pure love of great 
movie making. Its tough-minded, unsentimental writing and ferociously brilliant 
acting -- across the board and especially at the top -- manage to give a pretty 
good idea of what Christy Brown, the Dublin-born writer, poet and painter, was 
all about. 
</P>
<P>
As Brown began the autobiography he called "My Left Foot," in honor of the only 
limb he could control enough to write with: "There were nine children before me 
and 12 after me. Of this total of 22, 13 lived." None, however, quite like 
Christy. This son of an impoverished bricklayer was born with cerebral palsy 
and, in the fashion of the day in 1932, was called a "dunce" and a "poor 
half-wit" for the first nine years of his life. Out of his mother's earshot. 
</P>
<P>
Probably because co-writer and director Jim Sheridan, a Dubliner, is from a 
huge and poor family himself, the film sneers at heart-tugging exactly the way 
Christy would, and with very nearly his same blunt Anglo-Saxonisms. Neither 
poverty nor Christy's condition is the subject here; they are the givens. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, 13-year-old Hugh O'Conor, who plays young Christy, and Daniel 
Day-Lewis, who picks up at Christy's 17th birthday, meld to create an 
extraordinary portrait of a wild, difficult, far-ranging mind, a man unsparing 
of himself and of others, full of rage and despair, for years full of untapped 
sexuality, who at last achieves some modicum of heart's ease. It is a 
spellbinding journey. 
</P>
<P>
In his first film, director Sheridan frames the story with a fund-raising 
ceremony outside Dublin on the estate of Lord Castlewell and (the splendid 
Cyril Cusack), at which 21-year-old Christy is being honored after publication 
of his autobiography. 
</P>
<P>
The wheelchair-bound, black-bearded writer is put into a drawing room with a 
nurse to look after him, until his appearance. Drinking his whiskey from a 
straw-and-flask arrangement in his tuxedo jacket, Christy casts a satyr's eye 
over this lively, open woman, Mary Carr (Ruth McCabe) and begins his assault, 
using his book as an opening wedge. And as she starts to read, raptly, and to 
see his paintings illustrating its pages, we move into his childhood. 
</P>
<P>
O'Conor's young Christy has the baleful look, the fierceness, the clamped-down 
mouth that Day-Lewis will have; it seems entirely likely that one could grow up 
into the other. But O'Conor's performance is nearly all mime and sound, the boy 
is like a furious projectile. Speech will come later, painstakingly. 
</P>
<P>
Sheridan (and co-writer Shane Connaughton) tips us off to what is boiling 
inside this wild-eyed boy two years before the family sees it. When the 
breakthrough finally comes, the scene is a real killer. As O'Conor lies, 
exhausted, after spelling his first word in chalk with his foot, the energy 
he's used to do this seems to pour off him in waves. (The scene is framed as a 
visual reference to another later on, as father and son lie beside each other, 
close as these opposites will ever be.) 
</P>
<P>
The older Christy will be reached through a crop-haired, luminous-eyed teacher, 
Dr. Eileen Cole (Fiona Shaw). He is now Day-Lewis, a late teen-ager and young 
man, torn by his sexuality, his loneliness, the depths of what he needs to say. 
Speech therapy will help him say it; particularly some of his crisper 
Anglo-Saxonisms (the reason for the film's R rating). This is a portrait of the 
hero as a socially almost-impossible young man: randy, uncontrollable, barely 
redeemed by the swiftness of his wit. 
</P>
<P>
Day-Lewis seizes the role, and almost immediately gets us to look beyond the 
man in the chair to the soul inside. It's a performance with a fantastic 
trajectory; he is sly, funny, as swift as he can be with these squash-shaped 
syllables, wicked, mordant and openly romantic. And wait until you seem him as 
goalie in a street scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
But he's not all charm. Cross him or, as it happens, let him fall in love and 
be left, and his rages are horrible. This is the tyrannical side of Christy's 
disablement, and the film makers don't avert their eyes to its unpleasantness. 
</P>
<P>
They also don't avert their eyes to the realities of poor Irish life, but it's 
treated as throwaway stuff, details too familiar to single out, like the single 
stunning fact of 22 children in one woman's lifetime. There's the meanness of 
this poverty; the children four in a bed upstairs, even when they are in their 
late teens and one in that bed is the uncontrollable Christy. 
</P>
<P>
There's also the enveloping warmth, always; an unspoken family-first unity, 
even when it means rallying around a bullying, empty shell of a father (the 
late Ray McAnally in a fine, last performance). And there's the pure, boundless 
love that radiates from the magnificent Brenda Fricker as Christy's mother. 
</P>
<P>
She plays her like the rock she must have been, without a jot of martyrdom or a 
flicker of complaint and without an actressy moment. And in keeping with her 
self-effacing power, Sheridan keeps his ensemble up and together, so that even 
Day-Lewis' incandescence never runs away with the film. It can't have been 
easy, since this is one of film's definitive performances, with a subtlety and 
physicality of almost eerie accomplishment.

<TEXT>
<P>
By now Los Angeles knows Santa Barbara artist Guy Williams as a maker of 
loosely structured, intellectually astute geometric paintings. A painter's 
painter, Williams' work has always reflected a belief that colored paint 
conscientiously handled was content enough for art. 
</P>
<P>
Given this, his new work and his new medium come as a particularly enticing 
change. 
</P>
<P>
Quiet, meditative emblems are built on the format of a square intersected by a 
single horizontal or vertical line, but they are made from tree bark! 
</P>
<P>
The bark has been smoothed and sanded so finely that it resembles compressed 
cork. At each craggy seam, vein-like horizontal striations form, giving the 
work the look of geological strata. Williams remains a painter, using the 
natural variations in the wood's color to modulate tonalities and "paint" moody 
atmospheres. "Asia No. 3" is exquisite and, though Williams is an artist quick 
to eschew any earthbound content, one work made from the teal-tinged bark of a 
eucalyptus tree (with a single filament of wood creating a central horizon 
line) looks just like a vast Oriental landscape at dawn. 
</P>
<P>
You don't need to see the titles of this "Asia" suite to know Williams is 
looking East. That there is transcendent content in repose here strikes some 
hyper-stimulated Americans as a little airy. The notion made contemporary art 
history in the works of Barnett Newman, to whom these works owe a great debt, 
and it's timely and believable in Williams' hands. (Kiyo Higashi Gallery, 8332 
Melrose Ave., to March 2.) MARLENA DONOHUE

PAINTER'S EXHIBIT FAILS TO CONNECT COLOR WITH MUSIC

LONG BEACH

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Artists long have been intrigued by the idea of translating musical notes into 
visual form. Trouble is, the fancy theories behind the work tend to sound 
awfully tedious or far-fetched -- and hard to apply to the visual evidence. 
</P>
<P>
If a painter were to proclaim that his work incorporated all the notes of 
Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, that fact in itself would have little more than a 
bizarre novelty value. So what, we would reply. How can we relate what we see 
to our knowledge of the score? 
</P>
<P>
Still, the urge to translate one art form into another persists. Nancy Mooslin, 
director of the art gallery at the Art Institute of Southern California in 
Laguna Beach, is an artist whose abstract paintings are concerned with the 
relationship she perceives between musical pitch and color. A group of her 
pastels and paintings and an environmental sculpture are on view through Feb. 
28 at the Fine Arts Gallery at Long Beach City College. 
</P>
<P>
Mooslin explains in a statement that she assigned the 12 colors in the color 
wheel to the 12 equal-tempered pitches in an octave, using darker colors for 
the low pitches ("which related to the rich, full sound of low-frequency 
vibrations") and lighter colors for the high pitches ("just as the 
high-frequency vibrations are thin and clear"). 
</P>
<P>
This is all very well, but the viewer has a hard time actually processing color 
as specific sounds, even with the color-to-pitch key Mooslin adds at the bottom 
of her two-dimensional works. 
</P>
<P>
We are left with the shapes and colors, which range from rather humdrum 
arrangements of wide, intersecting arcs of color (in pastels called "Searching 
for the Music of the Spheres") to the sprightly patterning in paintings 
intended to represent major scales. These small, engaging works are 
"syncopated" (visually, if not musically) with pileups of small, thick daubs of 
intense color on flat fields of lighter color. 
</P>
<P>
The environmental piece is a series of six large arcs in various sizes, 
colorfully painted with geometric shapes, waves, cloud forms and other forms of 
ornament. Breezy and bright, the piece looks as though it would be at home in a 
playground. Actually, the sculpture consists of six musical compositions 
"translated" according to Mooslin's system. But we have to take her word for 
that. 
</P>
<P>
Mooslin's interest in inter-media projects led to the founding of Connect 3, an 
ensemble that also includes choreographer Sylvia Turner of Orange and composer 
Darrel Dorr of El Toro. Wednesday night the collective premiered "Fractured 
Peace," a 20-minute modern dance piece that incorporates Mooslin's painted 
sculptures along with the music that "built" them. A big problem with mounting 
performances in gallery space is that the sight lines are usually woefully 
inadequate. Standing behind a group of tall people at the gallery entrance, I 
heard Dorr's burbling score but saw only a fleeting glimpse of the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fractured Peace" will be repeated Sunday at 2 p.m. and Feb. 23 at 8 p.m. at 
the Fine Arts Gallery, Long Beach City College, 4901 E. Carson St., Long Beach. 
Mooslin's visual art remains on view at the gallery through Feb. 28. Gallery 
hours: 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Mondays through Thursdays (also 7 to 9 p.m. Mondays 
through Wednesdays) and 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. Fridays. Admission to the performance 
and the exhibit are free. Information: (213) 420-4317.

Peter Zecher continues to bend geometry to his bidding by juggling steel cubes, 
rings and cylinders into repetitively patterned constructions. Some are 
free-standing floor sculptures, others "float" high on the gallery walls, and 
still others are small table-top doodads. 
</P>
<P>
Although there are pleasures for the eye in trying to trace the way Zecher 
structures each piece, most of the work ultimately seems too ponderously 
literal, like a nerd's doodle in math class blown up into three dimensions. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of the infinitely repeatable modular unit now seems awfully close to 
an interior design concept; in fact, one Zecher piece, "Cube Line IV," looks 
like those metal organizers that are supposed to tidy up your closet. Many of 
the new works are painted a single basic color -- gold, red, black or turquoise 
-- which tends to emphasize the "decorator" side of the work rather than the 
inventive linkages. On the plus side, some of the units are now more open and 
airy than Zecher's tightly defined trademark shapes. Letting more air into a 
piece like "Fractured Cubes I" loosens things up a bit and lets us see the 
overall shape as sculpture with possible metaphorical associations rather than 
a hobby-kit obsession. (Zero One Gallery, 7025 Melrose Ave., to Feb. 20.) CATHY

Susan Stinsmuehlen-Amend makes glass constructions that take their lead from 
the antics and subjects of Synthetic Cubism. In that early 20th-Century style, 
actual textures like chair caning played against printed textures which in turn 
played against hand applied paint. 
</P>
<P>
This sparked a dialogue on flatness and literal surface that's been the core of 
modern painting. Stinsmuehlen-Amend juxtaposes every imaginable texture and 
surface, but she forms these from finely modeled glass. The artist takes 
everyday objects as her subjects and pulls them together in the helter-skelter, 
topsy-turvy syntax of Synthetic Cubism. The difference is that hers is a 
uniquely feminine vision, close to that of New York artist Elizabeth Murray in 
its homey content and freely associative approach. 
</P>
<P>
"Cinque Petal" is a large, wall-mounted, five-leaf clover ornately encrusted 
with glistening bits of black and rich green glass. It looks like an oversized 
bit of ceramic jewelry, a hat or wall paper design. Spiraling half domes 
sprouting from other pieces look like inverted tea cups, playfully hint at 
breasts or turn into slippery organic slugs. "Palais d'Embryonic Arabesque" is 
first of all squiggly, delicious design, but also suggests a button and 
rhinestone studded vanity with an oval mirror at its center. The recurring oval 
shape crafted from mosaic bits of inlaid teal, green and brown glass in 
"Domestic Inception" hints at a uterus canopied by scores of glossy, bulbous 
eggs. Glass art that throws its glove into the fine art sculpture arena must be 
deft and intelligent to avoid looking hokey; this work is both.

CSUN FILM STUDENTS' HARD WORK SHOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID COLKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's easy to tell a Cal State Northridge film student from one at USC. The CSUN 
student is the one selling raffle tickets for trips to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
"I was desperate, and I was trying anything to raise money for my film," said 
Aron Margolis, the producer and director of "Final Cadence," a 30-minute film 
made at the CSUN film school. It is one of five films to be shown at the 1990 
Student Film Showcase, marking the first time CSUN has sponsored a public 
showing of films made at the school. The screening will be Wednesday at 7:30 
p.m. at the Campus Theater. 
</P>
<P>
Students at the well-known USC film school are issued the basic equipment and 
supplies for their 16-millimeter films, but CSUN students have to beg, borrow 
and rent equipment and raise funds to pay for supplies. 
</P>
<P>
"It took me 2 1/2 years to make my film. I just finished it in October," said 
Margolis, 26, who completed the rest of his studies in May, 1988. "I tried a 
little bit of everything to raise money. At one point I bought a very 
inexpensive weekend package to Vegas and then sold raffle tickets for it. 
</P>
<P>
"I only took in about $200 profit. It wasn't worth it." 
</P>
<P>
With a couple of grants from a CSUN foundation and in-kind services donated by 
several film companies, Margolis was able to finish his film, which is about a 
high school student who is getting unwelcome pressure to take over the family 
paint-mixing business. 
</P>
<P>
Margolis said showings of the $23,000 film have gotten him offers of assistant 
director work, but he is trying to hold out until he can get his own project, 
either in Los Angeles or in Mexico City, where he grew up. "I'm out knocking on 
doors," he said, "showing this film I made." 
</P>
<P>
Robyn Freedman, who co-wrote and co-produced the moody, 17-minute film "Nexa" 
at CSUN, admits that at times during her schooling she was jealous of students 
who could attend the well-equipped USC school. "But USC was really out of the 
question for me, just far too expensive," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She and a group of students pooled their resources to come up with the $8,000 
needed to make "Nexa," which was shot in black and white in the industrial 
section of downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"When I look back on it, I'm glad I didn't go to USC," Freedman said. "Not all 
the students there get a chance to direct, like we do at CSUN. And I really 
believe that it's not the school you go to, but what you put into it that 
counts." 
</P>
<P>
Freedman said she is working with her father, producer Jack Freedman, to 
develop projects they hope to soon put into production. 
</P>
<P>
The other three films in Wednesday's showcase are "Bohotz: His First 
Adventure," Maria Demeter's comedy about a recent graduate from clown college; 
"Deception," a film noir-like thriller directed by Peter Levitt; and "Aquaman," 
a satire on comic-book heroes written and directed by Jeff Klein and Tom Farr. 
</P>
<P>
The first Cal State Northridge student film showcase will screen at 7:30 p.m. 
Wednesday at the Campus Theater, 18111 Nordhoff St., Northridge. Admission is 
free. For additional information, call 818-885-3192.

SANAMLUANG'S COOKING IS THE THAI THAT BINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL STERN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The dizzying array of restaurants on Ventura Boulevard creates the illusion 
that you can get virtually anything imaginable to eat there. That is a great 
exaggeration. 
</P>
<P>
The southern part of the San Fernando Valley simply lacks sufficient 
concentrations of most ethnics to support restaurants offering authentic fare 
of their native lands. 
</P>
<P>
But this changes as you go north of the boulevard. Consider North Hollywood. 
When you happen on the neon-lit Bangluck Plaza at night, it shimmers like a 
mirage in the clear darkness of a Santa Ana night. It's almost a mini-modern 
Asian village: Thai supermarket, video store and restaurant and Chinese 
barbecue shop. And, in the parking lot, a Buddhist shrine the size of a VW bug, 
encrusted with glass mosaic and adorned with a herd of small carved wooden 
elephants. 
</P>
<P>
The market is so close that you can see the produce that goes onto your table. 
And this proximity must be one reason that Sanamluang Cafe's cooking is as 
fresh and vibrant as any I've encountered. Compared to most other Thai places, 
the cooking is more pungent, more flavorsome, less delicate in the Western 
sense, yet wonderfully complex. 
</P>
<P>
For example, yen-ta-pho, a hot and sour soup whose red broth is laced with nam 
pla (fish sauce) and chiles, sends out beautifully mixed messages, some of them 
highly spiced. The solids -- among them squid, shrimp, jellyfish and fried won 
ton and rice noodles -- add a generally welcome variety of textures. 
</P>
<P>
Another almost magical dish is listed on the menu simply as duck salad. What's 
in it other than duck, red onions and lime juice is difficult to say, but it's 
worth going back to order merely that. 
</P>
<P>
Sanamluang also does admirable versions of more familiar dishes. Larb -- a 
salad of ground beef (or pork or chicken) with onion, mint leaves, chile, lime 
juice and powdered rice -- was fully realized. Tom-yum-goong -- a chile-spiced 
soup with lemon grass, beautifully textured shrimp and lime juice -- should 
wake up even a long-dormant palate. Especially pleasing was a squid salad of 
such outstanding texture that its preparation should be required of any chef 
attempting to prepare this challenging sea creature. 
</P>
<P>
All of this is served in a slightly updated version of the once-standard 
Formica-heavy design of ethnic restaurants. Sanamluang's prices are slightly 
old-fashioned too: Six people could eat very well for less than $40 and have 
plenty to talk about the next day. 
</P>
<P>
Though virtually all of Sanamluang's dishes seem accessible to the Western 
palate (the degree of spiciness is, as always, a personal one), there are a 
couple that just might be too odd. 
</P>
<P>
Koou chai is a patty of translucent glutinous rice paste filled with Chinese 
greens. Its slimy texture, somewhat like that of sea urchin, might be 
off-putting; the mild taste is certainly not. Som-tom, a salad made with 
shredded translucent green (that is, unripe) papaya with salty dried tiny 
shrimp is also slimy. There is no reason to believe that these dishes are less 
than the best they can be; it's just that it would be difficult to recommend 
them to cautious eaters. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of the variety and vitality of the choices available at this 
Sanamluang (there are others in Pomona and Hollywood), a whole section of the 
menu headed "Dishes" is not offered here. This includes such intriguing items 
as fried morning glory with soy bean sauce and duck feet stew. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, even with the shorter menu, the North Hollywood cafe should whet 
your appetite for the exotic. 
</P>
<P>
Recommended dishes: tom-yum-goong ($4.75), larb ($3.75), duck salad ($4.50). 
</P>
<P>
Sanamluang Cafe, 12980 Sherman Way, North Hollywood; (818) 764-1180. Open 10 
a.m. to midnight daily. Beer and wine. Parking lot. Cash only.

CSUN CLASSES INTRODUCE CHILDREN TO WORLD OF MUSIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE SCHLOSBERG, Schlosberg is a regular contributor to Valley Calendar. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's been a sad song in recent years for music education -- fewer students are 
joining high school bands, and only one-fourth of Los Angeles elementary 
schools offer instrumental music instruction. 
</P>
<P>
But Cal State Northridge has a way to get kids interested early. The music 
department's Community Music School is offering a variety of low-cost programs 
for children as young as age 4 and a special course for developmentally 
disabled children. 
</P>
<P>
The classes, taught by CSUN faculty with help from college music majors, are 
held after school and on Saturdays in the CSUN Music Building. They begin in 
mid-February. 
</P>
<P>
"It's critical that kids have music instruction at a young age," said Frances 
Ulrich, director of the Community Music School. "Otherwise just the peer, 
popular music takes over, and that's a very limited menu." 
</P>
<P>
For 4-year-olds, there's "Music Play and Puppet Magic," a course that develops 
awareness of musical sounds through creative games and hands-on activities with 
instruments. The kids are also introduced to classical music. 
</P>
<P>
Children ages 6 to 8 can attend "Adventures in Music and Movement," which 
involves singing, folk dancing, and playing xylophones, electronic keyboards 
and percussion instruments. Ulrich, who teaches the course, introduces 
traditional and modern music and teaches the children about instruments in an 
orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
Ulrich said it's important for children to become exposed to music before age 
8. "At that age, kids are pretty well set at what they are open to developing 
later," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The course, which starts Feb. 10, runs six Saturdays for $30. 
</P>
<P>
The Suzuki String Program, which is also offered, provides individual violin 
and cello lessons for children ages 3 to 12. For the first year, they learn to 
play without reading musics. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like the old-fashioned, rigid teaching," Ulrich said. "And it's very 
natural for them to handle a string instrument at that age." 
</P>
<P>
The lessons cost $13 for 30 minutes of instruction. 
</P>
<P>
Also offered is "Music for the Special Learner," a class for children with 
various mental, emotional and physical disabilities. Instructor Ron Borczon, a 
music therapy professor, integrates music activities with social and academic 
skills. "It's good socialization, where they can experience music in a group 
setting," Borczon said. "Sometimes they'll sing into a microphone and they 
think they're on stage, and everyone claps for them. It's a great self-esteem 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
The children learn songs and make instruments such as maracas and drums. The 
class, which begins Feb. 22, meets at 4 p.m. Thursdays. 
</P>
<P>
The university also is offering beginning guitar for children ages 8 to 13 
beginning Feb 22. Preparatory orchestra for children with at least one semester 
of previous instruction begins Feb. 13. 
</P>

PREVIEW: KIDS OF ROCK THEATRE BRINGS SHOW TO MALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE WYMA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mall crawlers may wonder if they've passed into another dimension tonight if 
they wander into the food area of the Fallbrook Mall in Canoga Park. Along with 
the usual shish kebab and baked potato stands, they'll find about two dozen 
dancing, singing teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, while many numbers in the musical revue will be straight off this 
week's MTV rotation, others will date from before television was born. 
</P>
<P>
The group, Kids of Rock Theatre, is made up of students in a singing and dance 
workshop of the same name. They play the mall at 6:30 p.m. the first Friday of 
each month, performing popular songs from the last 60 years. 
</P>
<P>
Some are dance numbers only, such as Benny Goodman's "Sing, Sing, Sing." 
Others, such as a medley from "West Side Story," find the group both singing 
and dancing. Music is provided by tape recordings played through a sound 
system. Admission is free. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing that's real different about the group is they're singing five-part 
harmony while dancing very complex moves," said Greg Wolford, director of Kids 
of Rock Theatre. "A lot of the singing is a cappella." 
</P>
<P>
Wolford is a choreographer whose recent credits include seven songs in "Wedding 
Band," a Jim Belushi movie set for March release, and two numbers in the 
just-wrapped "Masters of Menace," starring Belushi and Dan Aykroyd. Wolford has 
been teaching the workshop, which takes students ages 14 to 19, for a decade. 
</P>
<P>
It's no surprise the teen-agers enjoy performing current or recent hits. 
Friday's show will include a song-and-dance version of the Janet Jackson tune 
"Rhythm Nation." Songs by Michael Jackson and Herbie Hancock also will be 
performed. 
</P>
<P>
But Wolford, who lives in La Crescenta, said his students also take to the 
older songs. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids like them because of the way we detail it and keep it in period," he 
said. "We keep it fast, too, and they like that." 
</P>
<P>
The show lasts about 45 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"One nice thing is that you can bring the kids," said a mall spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Kids of Rock Theatre practices about 10 hours a week and performs at various 
benefits. Tuesday the group played in a fund-raiser at the Bonaventure Hotel 
for an inner-city youth program. The event saluted the 100th anniversary of the 
Dodgers baseball organization, and a number of players attended. Wolford said 
several hundred people were in the audience. Kids of Rock Theatre was the 
headline group. 
</P>
<P>
"We did an a cappella version of the 'Star-Spangled Banner' that had about 15 
different singers, and they loved it," said group member Matthew Stone, 16, of 
Sun Valley. "The people in the audience were crying." 
</P>
<P>
 Kids of Rock Theatre; 6:30 tonight; Food Court, Fallbrook Mall, 6507 Fallbrook 
Ave., Canoga Park; admission free; for information telephone (818) 340-5871.

BUSINESS HONOR GOES TO A MOST UNUSUAL 'HIGH-TECH' FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM KOWSKY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Diego company that manufactures an indoor horticulture device popular 
among marijuana growers has won top honors from an organization of the area's 
business leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Pyraponic Industries Inc. II, which advertises its product in pro-marijuana 
magazines such as High Times, has been recognized as the Business of the Year 
in Manufacturing from the Greater San Diego Chamber of Commerce. The company is 
scheduled to receive the award later this year at a banquet along with six 
other businesses honored in other categories. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the company's notoriety, the chamber so far is undeterred. While the 
company's advertising in pro-marijuana magazines "is a surprise to us," there 
are no plans to revoke the award, said chamber spokesman Pete Litrenta. 
</P>
<P>
"Of all those that applied, this is the best manufacturing company," Litrenta 
said. "This company evidently showed a lot of growth in sales and employees." 
</P>
<P>
Pyraponic has sold more than 90,000 Phototrons since it was founded in 1982, 
DeMarco said. The 65-employee company, which sells its product strictly by mail 
order, reported $10 million in sales in 1989, and was recognized last year by 
Inc. magazine as one of the 500 fastest-growing private corporations in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffery DeMarco, the company's founder and president, said advertisements in 
High Times, a magazine for marijuana enthusiasts, are responsible for more than 
17% of sales of Phototron, the 42-inch-high indoor greenhouse he designed while 
a graduate student working on a federally licensed project on marijuana 
cultivation at the University of Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
Drug Enforcement Agency spokesman Jim Mavromatis said Thursday that while local 
agents have not seized any Phototron device in connection with illegal 
pot-growing activity, other indoor greenhouses are frequently the subject of 
DEA drug raids. 
</P>
<P>
"All I can tell you is that the only times I have seen indoor growing 
operations (they have been) for marijuana cultivation," Mavromatis said. 
</P>
<P>
DEA agents in San Diego visited the Pyraponic Industries plant in Rancho 
Bernardo, a San Diego suburb, last fall to investigate whether the company was 
engaged in any illegal activity. No arrests or seizures were made. 
</P>
<P>
DeMarco, who started but did not complete his master's degree in criminology, 
said the indoor greenhouse is advertised in more than 50 publications including 
Playboy, Penthouse, Better Homes &amp; Gardens and Field &amp; Stream. The 
device, which sells for $390, can be used to grow a wide variety of plants 
including fruits, vegetables, flowers and herbs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the company's reliance on pro-marijuana magazines including High Times 
and Magical Blend, Pyraponic Industries does not condone marijuana cultivation 
and, in fact, revokes its service guarantee to anyone who employs the device to 
grow marijuana, DeMarco said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a policeman, I'm an entrepreneur," the 38-year-old DeMarco said.

NEWSPAPERS AIM SPECIAL PUBLICATIONS AT LATINOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A handful of California's mainstream newspapers are chasing after one of 
today's hottest marketing prospects -- the Latino population. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the Daily News began to publish a free, weekly Spanish 
language newspaper, Vecinos del Valle (Valley Neighbors), that will reach 
48,000 homes in the San Fernando Valley. By May, the Fresno Bee plans to 
publish Vida en el Valle (Life in the Valley), a separate, bilingual newspaper 
that will reach 30,000 homes in the Fresno area. And for more than a year, The 
Times has published Nuestro Tiempo (Our Time), a bilingual section that reaches 
more than 419,000 homes. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Union has indicated that it too may eventually publish a 
Spanish-language paper. 
</P>
<P>
For years, specialty publications like the popular La Opinion have primarily 
served local Latinos. But now, marketing experts suggest, this may be just the 
beginning of specialty papers -- targeted at minorities -- that are published 
by mainstream newspapers nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first time in U.S. marketing history, language has become the real 
demographic barrier," said Henry E. Adams, executive vice president at Market 
Development Inc., a San Diego research firm that specializes in Hispanic 
marketing. "It used to be things like sex or age, but now language is the 
stumbling block." 
</P>
<P>
Newspaper executives generally say that these special Spanish-language editions 
and sections are mainly bids to increase readership. And that is true. But 
those new readers are actually the key to increased advertising sales. Analysts 
say the real fuel behind this sudden expansion is the keen desire by a growing 
number of major advertisers to reach Latinos -- and the subsequent desire of 
newspapers to profit from that. 
</P>
<P>
"This is all advertising-driven," said Roger Sennott, general manager of Market 
Development Inc. "The big advertisers want Spanish-language outlets." 
</P>
<P>
The trend can be seen in other media as well. The number of Spanish-language TV 
and radio stations continue to grow. Yellow Pages that are written in Spanish 
keep expanding into new markets. And several major publishers, including 
Whittle Communications, have recently announced plans to publish general 
interest Spanish-language magazines. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, more than just about anywhere else, this growth can be seen in Los 
Angeles County, which has a Latino population of 3.3 million, or 36.4% of the 
population, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Latinos could comprise 40% of 
the city's population by the year 2010. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a market we have not been effectively reaching," said David J. Auger, 
publisher of the Daily News. "The time is right for us to try." 
</P>
<P>
So this week, the Daily News began to publish Vecinos del Valle, which is 
delivered weekly to select Latino subscribers and non-subscribers to the Daily 
News, primarily in the cities of San Fernando, Sylmar, Pacoima and Sun Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The paper -- which is written entirely in Spanish -- is published by the 
advertising staff of the Daily News, said Auger. "The idea was conceived by 
that group," he said. The first 12-page issue, which is about 50% news and 50% 
advertising, includes an article on bilingual education. Among its largest 
advertisers is Budweiser. 
</P>
<P>
Auger declined to state the start-up costs of the publication, but he did say 
he expects the paper to be operating profitably within several months. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Fresno Bee has said it plans to begin publishing a weekly 
bilingual publication by May that will either be mailed or delivered 
(independent of the Fresno Bee) to families with Latino surnames throughout 
Fresno County and nearby communities. That publication, Vida en el Valle (Life 
in the Valley), will initially be delivered free of charge, but will eventually 
seek "volunteer" subscriptions of $15 per year, said Ray Steele Jr., general 
manager of the Bee. The paper will also be sold on newsstands for 25 cents. 
</P>
<P>
"We think the Hispanic market is growing, and we want to be a part of that 
growth," said Steele. He noted that at least six Spanish-language newspapers 
already are published in the Fresno area. And if Vida en el Valle is 
successful, he said, the concept could be tested in other parts of the state, 
including Salinas, San Jose and Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Nuestro Tiempo, the monthly, bilingual Latino section 
published by The Times, is also studying expansion. 
</P>
<P>
"There is consideration of becoming a weekly publication," said Frank O. 
Sotomayor, editor of Nuestro Tiempo, which is written by Times staff and 
free-lance writers. "Our editorial goal for Nuestro Tiempo is simply to provide 
more coverage about Latinos and to reach those readers we had not been 
previously serving." 
</P>
<P>
Nuestro Tiempo, which primarily circulates in central and East Los Angeles, is 
distributed through a combination of home delivery and mailings. Its 
circulation in the San Fernando Valley, where it will now go head-to-head with 
Vecinos del Valle, is about 21,000. 
</P>
<P>
There are indications that the San Diego Union will also get in on the act. The 
newspaper has had discussions about publishing a Spanish-language newspaper, 
said Gerald L. Warren, editor of the Union. "It's definitely in the long-range 
planning," he said, but he declined to place any timetable on the project. 
</P>
<P>
Some say the mainstream newspaper to most aggressively court Latinos is the 
Miami Herald. 
</P>
<P>
In 1976, it first published a Spanish-language section. And in November, 1987, 
it began to publish El Nuevo Herald, a daily Spanish-language newspaper 
distributed along with the Herald to more than 101,000 homes. "The Hispanic 
population continues to grow," said Roberto Suarez, publisher of El Nuevo 
Herald and associate publisher of the Miami Herald. "That explains our growth." 
</P>
<P>
With 65 employees, the paper averages about 48 pages per issue. Among its major 
advertisers are Budweiser, Publix (a supermarket chain) and Burdines (a retail 
chain). The Herald reportedly spent more than $3 million to start up the 
publication.

Gillette Seeks Soviet Venture: Gillette Co., the world's largest maker of 
razors and blades, said it was negotiating on a joint venture to build the 
company's first manufacturing plant in the Soviet Union. Gillette said it had 
signed a memorandum of intent with a Soviet group, the Central 
Scientific-Production Assn., known as Leninets, which employs 40,000 people in 
the manufacture and sale of consumer products and in scientific, ecological and 
research activities. Gillette said it hopes to sign a definitive agreement for 
the project later this year.

Chrysler Closing St. Louis Car Plant: Chrysler Corp. will close its St. Louis 
car assembly plant in September as part of a move to consolidate the company's 
assembly capacity, Chrysler said. In all, 3,700 workers will be laid off, the 
company said. Chrysler will move assembly of the Dodge Daytona and Chrysler 
LeBaron coupe and convertible to plants in Sterling Heights, Mich., and Newark, 
Del., from St. Louis, boosting the employment at those two plants by a few 
hundred workers each, a spokesman said.

McDonnell May Shift Jet Work: McDonnell Douglas said it is looking at moving 
some work on the MD-11 jumbo jetliner to St. Louis from the firm's Douglas 
Aircraft subsidiary in Long Beach. A Douglas spokesman emphasized that assembly 
of the MD-11 will continue to be done in Long Beach and that no local jobs 
would be lost because of the move. A boom in commercial aircraft sales has left 
Douglas with a $45-billion backlog.

HILTON SAYS IT WANTS TO BE ALONE

<P>
Hilton Hotels Corp. hung out a do-not-disturb sign Thursday, saying it would 
pass up buyout offers for now and try to negotiate a better deal or come up 
with a restructuring plan. 
</P>
<P>
The lodging-casino concern, which put itself up for sale last summer, said its 
directors met Tuesday and Wednesday to consider bids and restructuring 
proposals. 
</P>
<P>
The board adjourned "without taking definitive action," Hilton said. 
</P>
<P>
Its stock, which had traded as high as $115.50 a share last August, tumbled 
$3.25 to $58.50 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Hilton said its board "instructed its financial advisers and management to 
further develop the acquisition proposals and the alternate strategies and to 
report back to the board on these matter within the next several weeks." 
</P>
<P>
Hilton has effectively been up for sale since settlement of a dispute over the 
estate of founder Conrad Hilton last May. The company formally invited offers 
in August for all or part of its lodging and casino operations.

RETAILERS' SALES IN MONTH TOP EXPECTATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services

<TEXT>
<P>
Major U.S. retailers on Thursday reported strong sales gains for January, a 
transition month when stores clear out leftover holiday merchandise to make 
room for fresh spring lines. 
</P>
<P>
"January's retail sales were stronger than anyone expected and reflected real 
demand by consumers," said Janet Mangano of Josephthal &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook Service said that in the weeks immediately 
after Christmas, the customer rested. "But sales picked up sharply in the 
fourth week of January," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sales on a comparable basis in stores open at least one year rose about 5% 
industrywide from a year earlier, according to analysts' estimates. 
</P>
<P>
Chains specializing in apparel had the best growth while several mass 
merchandisers, including the nation's largest retailer, Sears, Roebuck &amp; 
Co., tallied increases below the industry average. 
</P>
<P>
January is typically slow in the retailing trade, and the month marks the end 
of the fiscal year for many merchants. Consumers usually have spent their 
buying urges at Christmas, and some people enter the new year with credit card 
debts that discourage them from shopping for a while. 
</P>
<P>
Widespread price cutting and other promotions this past holiday season -- 
particularly by debt-laden department stores desperate to raise cash -- may 
have left buyers more bloated than usual. 
</P>
<P>
Among the leaders was the Gap, an apparel retailer whose sales climbed 24% on a 
comparable-store basis. Sears, which has been reporting disappointing results 
and may be pulling back from its "everyday-low-prices" strategy launched early 
last year, said same-store sales rose 3.3%.

Campeau Corp.'s huge U.S. department store divisions, Federated Department 
Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp., won the right in bankruptcy court Thursday 
to keep paying certain employee and retiree benefits. 
</P>
<P>
The approval was sought, among other reasons, to ease the concerns of employees 
at Federated and Allied. 
</P>
<P>
The units filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection on Jan. 15 after 
being crushed by takeover debts. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, Federated officials confirmed that they are considering calling off 
efforts to sell Bloomingdale's, the high-fashion department store chain that is 
known as the crown jewel of the Campeau retail empire. 
</P>
<P>
Bloomingdale's was put on the block in September as part of a last-ditch effort 
to avert a financial collapse. After Federated made its Chapter 11 filing last 
month, company officials said they would still try to sell the 17-store chain, 
although they conceded that they no longer could meet their February deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, Federated is studying whether "there would be more value . . . by 
retaining Bloomingdale's or by selling it," said spokeswoman Carol Sanger. 
</P>
<P>
"Absent a bid for Bloomingdale's that would be so overwhelming that we'd have 
to act on it, the decision would be delayed pending the construction of an 
overall reorganization plan for the companies," Sanger said. 
</P>
<P>
Retail industry sources have said that potential bidders for Bloomingdale's 
have been unwilling or unable to come up with offers high enough to satisfy 
Federated, which has sought more than $1 billion for the chain. Bidders also 
may have been scared off by the need to secure bankruptcy court approval for 
such a sale.

SEC PROBES FIRST INTERSTATE OVER $400-MILLION RESERVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
First Interstate Bancorp said Thursday that the Securities and Exchange 
Commission launched an informal inquiry related to the $400 million that the 
bank set aside last December largely to deal with its problem-plagued Texas 
unit. 
</P>
<P>
The intent of the inquiry wasn't disclosed, but when banks or other firms set 
aside large sums to cover potential losses, questions are often raised about 
whether adequate and timely disclosures were made. 
</P>
<P>
A First Interstate spokesman called the inquiry routine. He quoted from a Jan. 
8 letter from an SEC staff member in Washington that said the request should 
not be taken as "an indication by the commission or its staff that any 
violation of law has occurred" nor that it reflects wrongdoing by any person at 
the bank. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles-based banking company has been plagued by problems with its 
units in Texas, where it made the untimely acquisition of ailing Allied 
Bancshares in early 1988, and in Arizona, where it has been hurt by that 
state's soft real estate market. 
</P>
<P>
In December, First Interstate disclosed that it would set aside $400 million in 
provisions largely to deal with problem real estate loans in Texas. Two months 
earlier, First Interstate disclosed a $350-million provision for real estate 
problems in Arizona. Those moves resulted in a $124.5-million loss for First 
Interstate in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The Arizona provision was made after a review by officials from the Office of 
the Comptroller of the Currency. First Interstate disclosed Thursday that its 
Arizona unit must abide by unspecified rules related to its lending practices 
and other matters, under an agreement reached in January with the regulators. 
</P>
<P>
First Interstate is trying to sell 7.5 million shares to replenish its capital, 
the financial cushion that banks maintain against losses. 
</P>
<P>
As it does, institutional investors and securities analysts are growing 
increasingly critical of how its management has disclosed its problems, 
complaining that the bank has surprised them too often over the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
Some investors and analysts were especially angry when the Texas problems were 
disclosed just weeks after the Arizona announcements. They contend that the 
bank should have disclosed all of its problems at once. 
</P>
<P>
Bank executives in previous interviews have denied that there was any intent to 
space out the announcements. Last month, the bank disclosed that Joseph J. 
Pinola, who has taken the brunt of the criticism, will retire on June 1, to be 
succeeded by Edward M. Carson, the company's president.

cash. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets for the raffle are available from all students for a $10 donation to

Students at the junior and senior high school levels in San Clemente will have 
a voice in planning their recreation facilities after recent approval by the 
City Council of a Youth Advisory Committee to the Parks and Recreation 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The seven-member panel will be made up of city residents between the ages of 12 
and 18, according to a plan from Bruce Wegner, parks and recreation manager. 
There will be three junior high and four high school students on the committee. 
</P>
<P>
Applications will be accepted by the commission beginning next month for those 
interested in serving the first term from April to September. Beginning in 
September, appointed commission members will serve a full year's term. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin High School seniors Erin Cunningham, Jennifer MacLean and David Taylor 
have received appointments to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. 
</P>
<P>
The three appointments to the academy brings the total to nine in the past six 
years, more than any other high school in the country, according to the 
academy's director of admissions. 
</P>
<P>
Brent Borden, David Lauderdale and Fred Rice were accepted in 1984; Laurie 
Reider in 1987, and Matt Blitch and Tom Feuerborn in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really proud of the accomplishments of the students and staff at Tustin 
High," said Merlin L. (Bud) Henry Jr., a Tustin Unified School District board 
member and an admissions representative for the academy.

The Oakland Tribune, last year, asked readers to submit their favorite and even 
quirkiest money-saving habits and practices.

A Berkeley couple said that they save dental floss on a bathroom hook to be 
used another day and a Richmond man said he refreezes used ice cubes, backwash 
and all. 
</P>
<P>
One person, unbelievable as it may seem, said, "I regulate my bodily functions 
so that I go to the bathroom during work hours. This saves on water, tissue and 
time. I can spend my hours at home doing something constructive, like cutting 
off expiration dates on coupons."

SOME ADDITIONS TO 'LIST TO END ALL LISTS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I'd like to add a couple of quotes to Bell's list ("Quote -- A List to End All 
'89 Lists -- Unquote," Life, Jan. 6). 
</P>
<P>
Most sanctimonious and hypocritical: Eric Lichtblau wrote last November 
regarding mailers sent by the Irvine Values Coalition: "But a closer 
examination of at least four repeated campaign claims shows them to be 
distortions or outright misrepresentations of the facts." 
</P>
<P>
Oh really? Isn't that the perfect epitome of the pot calling the kettle black? 
Journalists do that all the time. Besides, The Times refused to wait until the 
IVC was able to produce the documentation to support their claims. 
</P>
<P>
Most absurd: This dubious honor goes to no other than The Times publisher, 
David Laventhol, when commenting on the closure of the Herald: "The absence of 
the Herald is going to place an even greater responsibility on The Times to be 
fair, accurate and complete in its reporting and to provide a forum for 
multiple voices on important issues." You have the right to print anything you 
like in your newspaper, but please don't insult your readers' intelligence by 
claiming to be fair, accurate, etc. 
</P>
<P>
The above quotes were taken from The Times so there is no guarantee of 
accuracy.

Today I had the opportunity to read the article by Patrick Mott about the Costa 
Mesa Police Department's driving under the influence team that was printed in 
the Dec. 16 edition of the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Mott's article was informative, very well researched and portrayed an 
honest example of the Police Department's efforts to reduce the trauma caused 
by "drunk drivers." 
</P>

Please thank Mr. Mott for taking the extra time and effort to write the story.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: YOUTH FLEEING COPTER SHOT BY POLICE OFFICER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An unarmed 15-year-old was shot and wounded early Thursday by a Los Angeles 
police officer in a confusing incident that began when the youth fled after 
mistakenly thinking a police helicopter was chasing him. The youth ignored 
commands to halt and then appeared to rush at an officer, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The youth was identified as Eric Davis, who was shot once in the lower body. He 
underwent surgery at UCLA Medical Center and was in serious condition, a 
hospital spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting took place at 12:25 a.m. near the Mid-City apartment building 
where Davis lives, shortly after police responded to a report of a car being 
burglarized on Venice Boulevard near Rimpau Boulevard, authorities said. Police 
said Davis and a 15-year-old companion heard the helicopter and mistakenly 
believed it was after them for selling cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Officers Theodore McHenry, 31, and Alicia Handy, 26, who were searching for car 
burglars, both fired shots when the youth came toward them "with both hands 
near his front waist band area," LAPD spokesman Don Lawrence said. 
Investigators were not sure Thursday which officer shot Davis.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PARK LA BREA TO LOCK ITS GATES THIS MONTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The biggest rental complex in Los Angeles, the Westside's Park La Brea, will be 
off limits to outsiders beginning later this month, when it will be converted 
into a fenced and guarded community. 
</P>
<P>
Only Park La Brea's 10,000 residents, their guests, workers and emergency 
vehicles will be permitted to drive freely through the gates once the new 
policy is in place.

Plans call for the gates to be locked by mid-February in the 176-acre complex, 
which is made up of 18 high rises and 26 garden apartment buildings in a maze 
of octagons and traffic circles stretching east of Fairfax Avenue between 3rd

BILL BOYARSKY: WATCHING THE MOUNTAINS GO DOWN HILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Bill Boyarsky 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although Los Angeles has a worldwide reputation for urban congestion, we're 
blessed by two mountain ranges that are towering reminders of the pre-freeway 
West. 
</P>
<P>
There's a painful lesson in those two mountain ranges about preservation of 
open space. 
</P>
<P>
The San Gabriel Mountains extend eastward between the San Gabriel and San 
Fernando valleys. The San Gabriels are pretty well protected as part of the 
1,000-square-mile Angeles National Forest. No matter how many more subdivisions 
and malls are built in the two valleys, the mountains will always offer a 
refuge. 
</P>
<P>
But the other range, the Santa Monica Mountains, separating the San Fernando 
Valley from the rest of Los Angeles, has been endangered for years. Close to 
the basin's urban heart, reaching tantalizingly to the coast, the Santa Monicas 
are being eaten up by development. 
</P>
<P>
That's because government got into the act too late, beginning to buy land for 
the Santa Monica Mountains Recreation Area, on the western half of the mountain 
range, after real estate prices began to soar. That's why the park contains 
only about 16,000 acres, a fraction of the public lands in the San Gabriels. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the staggering cost of land, the federal government is trying to 
compete for land with real estate developers. Also obtaining land are the 
nonprofit Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy and the Mountains Restoration 
Trust. But their meager funds make the competition one-sided. With mountain 
homes selling for well over $1 million, who can afford a park? 
</P>
<P>
There's little anyone can do now. That was shown this week by what has happened 
to a small canyon in the Santa Monicas extending from Mulholland Drive down to 
Fryman Road in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
The canyon is popular with hikers and is used for nature walks by students from 
a nearby elementary school. The steep canyon walls, with their chaparral 
underbrush, are perfect examples of mountain topography. A small stream at the 
bottom completes the landscape. The canyon, and, on clear days, the entire 
Valley, is visible from an overlook in a park just off Mulholland Drive. 
</P>
<P>
But not for long. Concluding a long battle over the future of the canyon, City 
Atty. Jim Hahn ruled Monday that the city had no way of stopping construction 
of 30 homes there. The property owners will clear away trees and underbrush, 
build an 18-foot-tall retaining wall, partially fill the canyon and then put up 
the houses. 
</P>
<P>
I heard about the canyon in a phone call from Judy Marx, one of the homeowners 
who have been fighting the development. I wasn't enthusiastic. Members of the 
save-the-canyons movement tend to be fanatics, their life myopically focused on 
the canyons to the exclusion of other civic issues. But I drove up to see her, 
wondering about the wisdom of city officials who allowed homes to be built in 
such a steep mountain area. The trip was worthwhile, for her story illustrated 
the dilemma presented by the Santa Monicas. 
</P>
<P>
The canyon's fate was sealed almost a decade ago when the subdivision was first 
proposed. The Briarcliff Improvement Assn. of Studio City, a homeowners' group, 
opposed it in the city Planning and Building and Safety departments, before the 
Planning Commission and the Board of Zoning Appeals. The association and others 
also tried to persuade the state or the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy to 
buy the land. But neither did. Both the conservancy and the state were under 
heavy pressure to save other mountain land. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of homeowner groups start too late and give up too early. That was not 
the case with Briarcliff and other homeowners who joined the fight. They forced 
the development firm to agree to about 75 modifications of its proposal. The 
project was reduced to half its original size before the council approved it, 
with Wachs casting the only no vote. In fact, some of the homeowners hoped the 
new requirement had made the project so expensive that it would never be built. 
</P>
<P>
But they reckoned without the real estate boom. With prices for mountain homes 
climbing, the developers are ready to go ahead -- as they have every right to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
My visit to Judy Marx reaffirmed the futility of such efforts to save the 
mountains in light of today's real estate prices. As we watch canyons in the 
Santa Monicas being filled, we can at least be grateful to an earlier 
generation that had the foresight to save the San Gabriels.

BUCKEY'S LAWYER SAYS REINER IS SEEKING TO WIN VOTES WITH RETRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner was accused by Ray Buckey's lawyer Thursday of 
attempting to boost his campaign for state attorney general by ordering a new 
trial for the McMartin Pre-School defendant on 13 charges of child molestation 
and conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an expedient use of (the public's) emotional confusion," Danny Davis said 
in an interview the day after Deputy Dist. Atty. Roger Gunson announced 
Reiner's decision to retry Buckey. 
</P>
<P>
Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, were acquitted last month of 52 
molestation counts after a 2 1/2-year trial, the longest criminal proceeding in 
U.S. history. The jury deadlocked on 13 other counts. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to retry Ray Buckey was "not a political matter, but a matter of 
justice," Reiner said Wednesday after Los Angeles Superior Court Judge William 
Pounders set the new trial for March 9. 
</P>
<P>
Davis declined to speak to the media after a brief court hearing Thursday, but 
in a telephone interview he said Reiner was preying on the public's "emotional 
backlash." 
</P>
<P>
The public outcry "could lead a politician to believe that continuing to 
prosecute in this case would be consistent with demonstrating that he is 
against molestation," Davis said. " . . . For politicians, a large vote for 
retrial would also mean a large emotional vote for the person who refiled the 
case." 
</P>
<P>
Davis noted that television polls found the public overwhelmingly opposed to 
the acquittals. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner, running for attorney general in the June Democractic primary, could not 
be reached for comment Thursday. But on Wednesday he said politics was never an 
issue during hours of discussions in his office on retrying Buckey. Reiner said 
he decided to press the case to resolve the charges more clearly, because of 
the "seriousness of the offense" and the "feelings of the families, especially 
the children." 
</P>
<P>
The remaining charges involve five children allegedly molested at the McMartin 
Pre-School in Manhattan Beach between 1978 and 1984. Jurors in the first trial 
said the majority had voted for acquittal on all of the deadlocked counts. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said the jury had more trouble deciding the 13 charges because it heard 
less evidence on those counts than on the 52 others. He said the prosecution at 
retrial will face the same problem it had in the first trial -- proving that 
children were not prompted by parents, police or the social workers who 
interviewed them. 
</P>
<P>
"I never felt any of these witnesses were appropriate for a criminal trial," 
Davis said. "Their stories were too mixed with contamination and the unreal." 
The defense attorney had told Pounders on Wednesday that he needed to clear "a 
number of obstacles" before retrying the case. But he said Thursday that he has 
no doubt that he will represent Buckey. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner said late Thursday that Buckey could be retried on just five molestation 
charges. In remarks during taping of KNBC-TV's weekend "News Conference" show, 
Reiner said only two of the remaining five alleged molestation victims have 
made strong commitments to testify at the retrial. He said a third alleged 
victim will not testify, and prosecutors will dismiss three molestation counts 
relating to her. He said it is doubtful a fourth alleged victim will testify. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Reiner said prosecutors do not intend to call the fifth alleged 
victim, a boy whose mother triggered the case in 1983. If only two testify, 
Buckey would be retried on five counts, he said.

BOY, 16, SHOT DEAF BROTHERS, POLICE TOLD; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: TWO TEEN-AGERS SAY A LONG BEACH YOUTH KILLED ONE AND WOUNDED THE OTHER 
WHEN A DISPUTE ESCALATED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A 16-year-old Long Beach boy is being sought as the gunman who shot two deaf 
brothers, killing one and wounding the other, in a scuffle in Granada Hills 
that witnesses said escalated from a stare-down contest between strangers at a 
traffic light, Los Angeles police said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the suspect was identified by two other teen-agers who came forward 
Wednesday and told detectives they were among a carload of youths involved in 
the confrontation that led to the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Cesar Vieira, 30, and Edward Vieira, 25, both of Palmdale, were shot Sunday 
night in a parking lot at the intersection of Devonshire Street and Balboa 
Boulevard. The older brother died early Monday of chest wounds. Edward Vieira 
was treated for hip and shoulder wounds at a hospital and released. 
</P>
<P>
Edward Vieira told police he and his brother were riding on a motorcycle when 
they were forced off the road and into the parking lot by a car containing five 
teen-agers, police said. 
</P>
<P>
During the ensuing confrontation, the brothers -- who had limited speaking 
skills and normally communicated through sign language -- were apparently 
unable to understand what was happening, police said. One of the teen-agers 
then opened fire with a handgun. 
</P>
<P>
Police described the suspected gunman as an associate of members of a Skinhead 
gang based in West Los Angeles. However, detectives said the shooting of the 
Latino brothers apparently was not racially motivated. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect's name and other details of his background were not released 
because he is a juvenile, Detective Michael Brandt said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the boy has fled his home in Long Beach. Two other teen-age boys 
who were in the car during the incident were still being sought for questioning 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday night, the two witnesses, a 16-year-old girl and a 17-year-old 
boy, went with their parents to the Devonshire police station. Lt. Harvie 
Eubank said the teen-agers were "upset" by the shooting, particularly after 
learning that the brothers were deaf and may have not understood what was 
happening during the confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
The boy and girl, who are not gang members, are not expected to be charged, 
Eubank said. However, their version of events differs from Edward Vieira's 
account, he said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Eubank, the two teen-agers said the shooting incident began when 
the teen-agers in the car and the men on the motorcycle started staring at each 
other at a traffic light. "They said it started as a stare-down contest and 
then somebody spit at the others and then they spit back," Eubank said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said it was unclear who spit first or, in fact, if any spitting 
occurred. Edward Vieira has told investigators he and his brother did nothing 
that would have brought on the attack. 
</P>
<P>
After the car followed the motorcycle into the parking lot, at least two of the 
teen-agers got out, including the boy with the gun, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the kind of traffic dispute that are a dime a dozen," Brandt said. "But 
in this case, one kid started shooting. The brothers did nothing to provoke 
that." 
</P>
<P>
The teen-agers who came forward told police they had no idea the incident would 
escalate into a shooting, Eubank said. 
</P>
<P>
"These kids thought it was going to be a fight," Eubank said. "They said they 
heard the first bang and saw Cesar was grazed with a bullet. They yelled, 'No, 
don't shoot!' but this other kid kept firing."

POLICE BARRICADES GO UP IN SOUTH-CENTRAL 'WAR ZONE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE FRITSCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police began erecting barricades Thursday around a square-mile area of 
South-Central Los Angeles in the latest in a series of neighborhood blockades 
intended to discourage drug dealing and drive-by shootings. 
</P>
<P>
Residents called the area a "war zone" controlled by drug dealers, and most 
said they welcomed the extra attention. 
</P>
<P>
"They park their cars in your driveway, they play their music and they do their 
selling -- even if you're looking at them," said a 57-year-old woman who was 
afraid to give her name. "They dare you to say anything to them. They bring out 
the guns and they tell you you're dead. They say they're going to get someone 
in your family." 
</P>
<P>
The area encompasses about 30 blocks bounded by 32nd Street on the north, 
Vernon Avenue on the south, Central Avenue on the west and Compton Avenue on 
the east. It will be encircled by 60 sand-filled plastic barricades and traffic 
cones. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the neighborhood was chosen because it has one of the highest crime 
rates in the city and because it has been the scene of 15 drive-by shootings in 
the past three months. 
</P>
<P>
Residents say they have been agitating for months to get increased police 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
Amid a heavy police presence, Mayor Tom Bradley and Police Chief Daryl F. Gates 
announced the crackdown at a press conference Thursday in a vacant lot at 41st 
Street and Central Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"We are determined to take back the streets of this community for the 
law-abiding people who live here, who work here and who play here," Bradley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Residents and others will not be restricted from entering the neighborhood, the 
mayor said, promising that people will be stopped by police only if they 
display "suspicious or erratic behavior." He said that of 560 residents 
interviewed recently, all but two wanted the barricades. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to beefed-up police protection, the area will get help from other 
city departments to clean up graffiti and remove trash from alleys and vacant 
lots, Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
Police officials said the program, which will be re-evaluated after six months, 
will cost $35,000 a month to pay overtime for additional police officers. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not here to occupy the territory," Gates said. "This isn't Panama. It's 
the city of Los Angeles and we're going to be here in a lawful manner. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"People's constitutional rights will be protected in every way." 
</P>
<P>
Gates said a major aim of the blockade will be to "disrupt the relationship 
between drug buyers and sellers. If you can destroy that relationship, you can 
destroy the drug trade that exists here and has festered here and destroyed the 
area." 
</P>
<P>
Since October, the Police Department has erected similar barricades in the 
Pico-Union area, the Sepulveda district and a Mid-Wilshire neighborhood -- all 
aimed at combatting street drug dealing and related crime. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Robert Davis, pastor of St. Peter's Rock Baptist Church at 54th Street 
and Hooper Avenue, said Thursday that he is delighted with the blockades 
because the neighborhood has been plagued by drive-by shootings, most by 
non-residents. 
</P>
<P>
"People over here in this area have been crying for years about what's 
happening and nobody has been listening," he said. "The children -- 4 and 5 
years old -- when they hear the shots they hit the floor. The parents teach the 
children to hit the floor. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a war zone."

RTD BOARD SUSPENDS PACT USED TO HIRE EX-MEMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD B. TAYLOR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jan Hall, recently retired member of the Southern California Rapid Transit 
District Board of Directors, may have a very short tenure as a paid lobbyist 
for the district, according to RTD officials. 
</P>
<P>
The district board on Thursday suspended the $99,500 consultant contract that 
put Hall to work on the district's behalf, but then agreed to give RTD General 
Manager Alan F. Pegg a week to explain why and how Hall ended up as a district 
lobbyist immediately after leaving her board post. 
</P>
<P>
If his explanation falls short, several members of the board have indicated 
that they will move to cancel the contract, an RTD spokesman said. Hall 
resigned her seat on the RTD Board of Directors last week to work for CBC 
Consultants, a private South Bay firm that contracted her services to the 
district. The contract, signed by Pegg, calls for Hall to lobby for the RTD, a 
district spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The deal, transacted by Pegg without the knowledge of the district's governing 
board, stirred an immediate, angry reaction from RTD Director Nick Patsaouras, 
who said the general manager should either resign or be fired if he did not 
immediately rescind the contract. 
</P>
<P>
Although the matter was not on Thursday's agenda, Board President Gordana 
Swanson brought the issue up and recommended that the contract be canceled. 
Earlier Swanson had said she was concerned about the deal, even though RTD 
attorneys had said there was no violation of the district's "revolving door" 
policies. Those policies are intended to prevent district directors from going 
to work for the RTD for at least a year after leaving their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
With only seven of the board's 11 members present on Thursday, it was decided 
to postpone action, giving Pegg a week to report back on why and how he put the 
consultant contract together. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Pegg feels (Hall's) knowledge of public transportation will help RTD in 
its relations with Sacramento and Washington, D.C., decision-makers," said Greg 
Davy, an RTD spokesman. "She is excellent and forceful communicator," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Hall, a Long Beach councilwoman, had been on the RTD board since 1981 and is 
considered a rapid transit expert. "This was a way to hire her, in effect," 
Davy said.

HOME TECH / WHAT'S NEW: 'INDIANA JONES' RELEASED IN 7 VIDEO FORMATS 
</P>

THIS WEEK'S MOVIES 
</P>
<P>
Indiana Jones is always adventuring into areas where no other explorer dares to 
go, so it's fitting that "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" represented a 
video-industry first when it was released Thursday. The Steven Spielberg film 
is the first to be released simultaneously in seven versions: regular VHS, 
Beta, pan-and-scan LaserDisc, letterbox LaserDisc, Super-VHS, 8mm, and 
Spanish-subtitled VHS. 
</P>
<P>
That is especially good news for anyone who has laid out big bucks for a 
Super-VHS VCR, only to find that pre-recorded material in the improved-image 
format is almost non-existent. The news gets even better: The Super-VHS version 
of the 1989 summer blockbuster is the lowest-priced S-VHS movie-on-tape yet -- 
only $39.95 -- and it's in the letterbox configuration (wide screen, with black 
bands at top and bottom). 
</P>
<P>
"Last Crusade" is the first S-VHS release from Paramount Home Video, offering 
hope that other S-VHS tapes will be coming from this major and others in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Prices are even lower for the other versions -- $29.95 for each of the 
LaserDisc versions and $24.95 for all others. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison Ford is back as Indy, with Sean Connery on hand as his father. Also 
starring Denholm Elliott, River Phoenix, John Rhys-Davies and Alison Doody, 
"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" is MPAA-rated PG-13. 
</P>
<P>
Other new movies-on-tape: 
</P>
<P>
"High Hopes" (Academy, $89.95, not MPAA rated). Critically acclaimed 1989 
British comedy-drama from director Mike Leigh about the class system in 
Thatcher-era Britain. 
</P>
<P>
"The Fastest Guitar Alive" (MGM/UA, $19.95). Did you know that singer Roy 
Orbison starred in a Civil War drama back in 1968? He did, and here it is -- 
though this tame movie will be of interest only to curiosity seekers. 
</P>
<P>
"Eat a Bowl of Tea" (RCA/Columbia, $89.95, PG-13). Comedy set in New York 
City's Chinatown, circa the 1940's. Directed by Wayne Wang ("Slamdance"). 
</P>
<P>
"Night Visitor" (MGM/UA, $79.95, R). No one believes a compulsive liar when he 
reports a gruesome murder. This 1989 film with Elliot Gould shouldn't be 
confused with 1970's "The Night Visitor," which starred Max von Sydow and Liv 
Ullmann. 
</P>
<P>
"Time Trackers" (MGM/UA, $79.95, PG). Weak time-travel comedy that gets waylaid 
in medieval England too long. Ned Beatty, Kathleen Beller. 
</P>
<P>
"Another Chance" (Republic, $89.95, R). Obscure 1988 romantic comedy with Bruce 
Greenwood, Vanessa Angel and Anne Ramsey about a playboy who suddenly has to be 
faithful to one woman. 
</P>
<P>
"Jesse James Rides Again" and "G-Men vs. the Black Dragon" (Republic, $29.95 
each). Two double-cassette packages compiling 1940s serials. 
</P>
<P>
NEXT WEEK: "Lethal Weapon 2" and "Wired" (both Wednesday). 
</P>
<P>
OTHER NEW VIDEOS 
</P>
<P>
They're baa-ack. Those masters of mayhem, the Three Stooges, wreak havoc in six 
more videos containing three shorts each. Volumes 27 through 31 feature Larry, 
Moe and Curly; Volumes 26 and 31 have Larry, Moe and Shemp. The tapes are 
$14.95 each from RCA/Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
Another sort of mayhem is on view in "Rolling Stone Presents 20 Years of Rock 
&amp; Roll" (MGM/UA, $19.95), a 97-minute retrospective featuring performers 
ranging from the Beatles to Madonna. TERRY ATKINSON

Dan Miller will stay on as the show's announcer and will occasionally 
participate in comedy bits, but he will no longer be the Ed McMahon-style 
sidekick. Likewise, Sajak will no longer exchange witticisms with his band 
leader, Tom Scott, as Johnny Carson does with Doc Severinsen and David 
Letterman does with Paul Shaffer. 
</P>
<P>
The show won't begin anymore with Sajak emerging to loud audience applause and 
fanfare through a curtain as all the other shows do. Instead, on many nights, 
he might be seated in a leather chair as the show opens, simply talking to his 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
Foundering at the bottom of the late-night talk show ratings for most of the 
past year, CBS' "Sajak" has been dismissed by critics, talk-show guests and the 
vast majority of viewers as a dismal flop. The new look is an attempt to 
overcome that "loser" image, said Michael Weisman, the show's new executive 
producer, and to encourage viewers to sample the show once again. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're trying to do is make Pat as comfortable as possible, play up his 
strengths and get away from that same old cliched talk-show look," said 
Weisman, the former executive producer of NBC Sports who took over at "Sajak" a 
month ago. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the sidekick and the banter with the band leader, Weisman is 
chucking the desk and the couch -- all institutions on "The Tonight Show." Gone 
too is trying to imitate Arsenio Hall's upbeat, noisy, party-like atmosphere. 
The set will now consist of two black leather chairs, with a new, "high-tech" 
background. There's also a new 37-second opening and new theme music. 
</P>
<P>
Celebrity guests and interviews will still be the backbone of the show. But 
Weisman is in negotiations with the local comedy troupe The Groundlings to 
perform a comedic soap opera, complete with cliffhangers, three nights a week, 
between the interviews. The show will also feature regular documentary-style 
tape pieces that go in search of such real-life personalities as "the most 
outrageous cabdriver in New York" or the "nuttiest waitress in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most provocative change will be a nightly roundtable discussion 
that Weisman plans for the end of each show. The plan -- designed to get away 
from the stock, I-have-an-album-coming-out-next-week celebrity interviews 
endemic to late-night talk shows -- is to have Sajak gather all of the 
evening's guests around a table for some unscripted and, Weisman hopes, 
humorous or argumentative conversation. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's roundtable will include Joan Rivers, "Murphy Brown's" Joe Regalbuto 
and author Erica Jong. 
</P>
<P>
As previously announced, Sajak will soon be hosting his show only four nights a 
week, with guest hosts filling in on Fridays. The first of these will be 
comedian John Mulrooney on Feb. 16.

RAMS WILL LEAVE IRVIN UNPROTECTED; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: CORNERBACK PROBABLY WILL RETIRE AFTER A 10-YEAR CAREER. LANSFORD 
ALSO WON'T BE PROTECTED AS TEAM TAKES A GAMBLE WITH KICKER.

<P>
Several veteran Rams, including cornerback LeRoy Irvin and kicker Mike 
Lansford, will be among the players left unprotected when the team's Plan B 
free agency list is announced today. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the restricted free agency plan, the Rams can protect 37 of 
their 52 players under contract at the end of the season. Those not protected 
can negotiate with any other NFL team until April 1 and not be subjected to 
compensation rules. 
</P>
<P>
Unprotected players may also chose to stay with their present teams. 
</P>
<P>
Although he has a year remaining on his contract, Irvin, 32, will not be 
protected, sources say, and probably will retire after a 10-year career with 
the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
Lansford's case is different. He recently signed a two-year contract with the 
Rams and will almost assuredly return in 1990 as the team's kicker. The Rams 
exposed him to free up a valuable spot on the protected list, knowing Lansford 
probably isn't going to play anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
Reached Thursday afternoon, Lansford confirmed the Rams' strategy: "They're 
thinking I'm secure here, I enjoy L.A., that I grew up here, that all my 
family's here, and they're right." 
</P>
<P>
Lansford, however, said he will listen to other offers. 
</P>
<P>
Other Rams expected to be on today's list include veteran defensive lineman 
Shawn Miller, reserve wide receiver Ron Brown and punter Dale Hatcher. 
</P>
<P>
There was speculation late in the week that either veteran linebacker Mel Owens 
or tight end Pete Holohan would not be protected. 
</P>
<P>
Owens, 31, had not been contacted by the Rams as of Thursday evening, which he 
understood to mean he was going to be protected. 
</P>
<P>
"I think John (Robinson) would have called me," Owens said. "I think he would 
have said, 'Mel, we're going to put you out there.' " 
</P>
<P>
Robinson and the Ram coaching staff are in Hawaii preparing for Sunday's Pro 
Bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
Owens added that if the decision came down to Owens or Holohan, the Rams would 
protect their tight end. 
</P>
<P>
"He caught 51 passes this year," Owens said. 
</P>
<P>
Holohan, 30, did not return phone calls Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Owens said he would not be upset if he is not protected. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I have some market value," he said. "I've seen a lot of people benefit 
by it." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, 12 of 19 Rams left unprotected signed with other teams for more 
money.

U.S. PLAYERS GET BACK ON THE FIELD

With no games for more than two months, the soccer players of the U.S. national 
team have faced stiffer opposition off the field than on it. Whether that has 
made them battle-tested, or just battle-weary, will be revealed tonight, when 
they play for the first time since qualifying last November for this summer's 
World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Their first-round opponent in the Marlboro Cup at the Orange Bowl is a familiar 
one, Costa Rica, which has even less World Cup experience than the United 
States. The United States last played in the world's most prestigious soccer 
tournament in 1950; Costa Rica will be making its first appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica, like the United States, qualified from the Central and North 
American and Caribbean region. They split two games last year, the United 
States losing at San Jose, Costa Rica, 1-0, and winning at St. Louis, 1-0. But 
Costa Rica finished the five-team, eight-game qualifying tournament with a 
better record. 
</P>
<P>
In tonight's second game, Uruguay plays Colombia, two respected South American 
teams that also qualified for the World Cup. The winners will meet Sunday night 
for the championship, after the losers play for third place. 
</P>
<P>
With four World Cup teams involved, there is more interest than usual for an 
exhibition tournament in the United States. Applying for credentials were 265 
reporters from 18 countries. 
</P>
<P>
"In the first Marlboro Cup of Miami in 1986, this was the number of fans we 
had," one of the organizers, Noel Lemon, said this week at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
He predicted a crowd of more than 30,000 each night at the Orange Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Coach Bob Gansler said he has been pleased with his team's practices, 
although it is difficult to predict if off-the-field distractions will affect 
the players on the field in their first game since Nov. 19. 
</P>
<P>
The players claim they have a common enemy, the U.S. Soccer Federation, but 
some of the resentment appears to be spilling over into their relationships 
with each other. Twelve of the 16 players offered $26,000 to $40,000 12-month 
contracts by the federation in December have signed, but most say they did so 
reluctantly and are still dissatisfied with the terms. 
</P>
<P>
Offers were withdrawn to two players, midfielder Paul Caligiuri of Santa Monica 
and reserve goalkeeper David Vanole of Manhattan Beach, who did not sign by the 
Jan. 14 deadline. Caligiuri, who scored the goal against Trinidad and Tobago 
that put the United States into the World Cup, remained with the team on a 
$40-per-diem basis, but Vanole has not been invited to return. 
</P>
<P>
Two others, goalkeeper Tony Meola and midfielder John Harkes, both of Kearny, 
N.J., have not signed their contracts. The federation gave them extensions, 
explaining that the players were unable to review the contracts while trying 
out earlier this month with an English first-division team. But other players 
complain that the federation is giving them special treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Some players also complained when four teammates -- Meola, Harkes, Hugo Perez 
and Tab Ramos -- received $250 each to do advertisements for Turner Network 
Television's World Cup coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Gansler has attempted to relieve the tension by forming a five-player committee 
to report grievances to him. The players were allowed to select two committee 
members. One of their picks was Harkes.

EXPERIENCE PAYS FOR STEWART, O'MEARA; 
</P>
<P>
PEBBLE BEACH GOLF: PLAYERS SHOW FORM IN FIRST ROUND THAT HAS GIVEN THEM SUCCESS 
IN THE PAST ON MONTEREY PENINSULA.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A year ago, Payne Stewart had to withdraw after the first round of the AT &amp; 
T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am because of painful back problems. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, Stewart, the second-leading money winner on the PGA Tour in 1989, 
shot a six-under-par 66 at Cypress Point for the first-round lead in the Pebble 
Beach tournament. 
</P>
<P>
What a difference a year makes. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart says there isn't a better place in the world to play than on the 
Monterey Peninsula courses used for the tournament: Pebble Beach, Cypress Point 
and Spyglass Hill. 
</P>
<P>
His enjoyment was evident on a day when Cypress Point dried out somewhat after 
an early morning rain. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart also is experienced at playing here, having finished second twice in 
the tournament the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
So it wasn't surprising that another player with lots of experience here, Mark 
O'Meara, was only one shot behind Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
O'Meara, the defending champion who also won here in 1985, shot a 67, five 
under, at Spyglass, generally regarded as the most difficult of the three 
courses. 
</P>
<P>
Stan Utley, Jim Woodward, Jim Thorpe and Bob Gilder were tied for third at 68. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm excited about being here," Stewart said. "It's one of those stops on the 
tour where I feel I can play well. I enjoy the weather and the courses, and it 
doesn't matter whether it's windy, cold, or raining, or sunny like it was 
today. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fun golf. You have to be patient. You have to be able to hit different 
kinds of golf shots. It challenges us -- and I enjoy that." 
</P>
<P>
Others may not share Stewart's enthusiasm, but obviously he doesn't have any 
mental hangups about playing here. 
</P>
<P>
After Stewart withdrew here in 1989, he consulted Frank Jobe, the noted Los 
Angeles orthopedic specialist. 
</P>
<P>
Jobe told Stewart that he had three degenerative disks in his back. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'There is no operation I can do for you right now that's going to 
make you any better,' " Stewart said. "He said that through exercise, 
rehabilitation and losing some weight I could be able to play. If I didn't do 
that he said my back problems would continue to get worse." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart heeded the advice and had his best year on the tour in 1989, earning 
$1,201,301 and winning two tournaments, most notably the PGA championship. 
</P>
<P>
In Thursday's play, Stewart had seven birdies and only one bogey. He also 
birdied a hole that has customarily treated him badly, the par-four, 393-yard 
17th. 
</P>
<P>
"I've made a bunch of sixes there in the past," he said. "I thought that if I 
got under six there I would be satisfied." 
</P>
<P>
He got his birdie with a 12-foot putt. 
</P>
<P>
Although the weather was favorable, Stewart wouldn't mind if it turned nasty. 
</P>
<P>
He figures that would eliminate a lot of players who don't have the skill 
required for the three courses in bad weather. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart and O'Meara stressed that patience is a key in playing the courses 
here. 
</P>
<P>
"Par isn't bad on any of the holes," Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart jokingly said that he had to hold up his amateur partner, "Some L. A. 
pitcher." 
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the Dodgers' Orel Hershiser. 
</P>
<P>
"Orel was trying too hard at first," Stewart said. "He's such an intense 
competitor. Once he started to relax, he began to play better." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart and Hershiser are only two shots out of the lead in the team 
competition with a net 65. 
</P>
<P>
O'Meara, who had seven birdies and two bogeys, made two birdie putts from 35 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
As the defending champion, O'Meara said he likes his position. 
</P>
<P>
"I look at my past memories here as positive ones. I realize I've been very 
fortunate in this tournament, and I realize it's difficult to defend any 
championship," he said. "But I'm not putting any extra pressure on myself. 
</P>
<P>
"I know no matter what happens in the future, my name is on a plaque out there. 
It's hard enough to win once, but to win twice I take a lot of pride in that. 
</P>
<P>
"I know these golf courses. I've played them for so many years now. I have a 
feeling I know the greens pretty well. 
</P>
<P>
"And I know if you shoot around par, or a couple under, you'll have a good 
score." 
</P>
<P>
O'Meara was teamed with his 61-year-old father, Robert, and he said his dad 
struggled a bit. They had a net score of 66. 
</P>
<P>
Like Stewart, he wouldn't mind if the weather turned a bit nasty for the 
remaining three rounds. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't mind seeing the wind blow a little bit," he said. "I'd like to see 
the course play as hard as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Golf Notes 
</P>
<P>
Mark Calcavecchia, Tom Kite and Raymond Floyd each shot 69. . . . Jack 
Nicklaus, who was four under par at one time, wound up with a par 72. . . . Jim 
Thorpe, who had a 68, is making a comeback after surgery on his left wrist and 
thumb in 1987. Thorpe, who turned 41 Thursday, finished second last week in the 
Phoenix Open and had an eagle Thursday. He chipped in from 40 feet on the 
par-five, 548-yard second hole at Cypress Point.

WILLIAMS GETS SAVE; FULLERTON WINS IN OVERTIME, 90-84 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Time was running out on Cal State Fullerton Thursday night for what seemed like 
the umpteenth time in Wayne Williams' career. 
</P>
<P>
With his team trailing San Jose State by two points with less than 10 seconds 
left, Williams had the ball near the top of the key. 
</P>
<P>
Five times in his two-year career, Williams has hit desperation three-pointers, 
twice winning games with them. But this time, Williams drove for a scooping 
layup with two seconds left, forcing an overtime period that ended in a 90-84 
Fullerton victory in front of 2,201 in Titan Gym. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a prayer," Fullerton Coach John Sneed said. "But his prayers have been 
answered so many times." 
</P>
<P>
In overtime, Fullerton (11-8, 5-5 in the Big West) took the lead and held it, 
and Williams hit four consecutive free throws in the final 28 seconds to clinch 
the victory. 
</P>
<P>
As regulation time ran down, there were those in the crowd who thought Williams 
might try a three-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want him to get into that buzzer-beater thing," Sneed said. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said it crossed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"Just for a second I started to take a long shot, but when I saw how much time 
was left I thought I could get a little closer. . . . Really I was trying to 
draw the foul, but I got the bucket." 
</P>
<P>
Williams' latest last-second heroics took a bit of the spotlight away from 
Cedric Ceballos, who for the second game in a row played every minute of an 
overtime game, finishing with 31 points and 16 rebounds, eight offensive. 
</P>
<P>
Ceballos played one of the finest games of his career Monday night against UC 
Santa Barbara, scoring 33 points in a game Fullerton lost in overtime after 
holding an 11-point lead with 2:20 left. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm playing great," Ceballos said. "Things are just flowing. It's that time of 
year to get a run going. This is the homestretch. I'm just putting my head 
down." 
</P>
<P>
Andre Brooks scored 27 points for San Jose, including five three-pointers, and 
Troy Batiste added 21 points. San Jose is 5-14, 2-8.

Carlos Martinez, of the Chicago White Sox, was freed after eight days in a 
Caracas, Venezuela, prison to begin a trial for assault that could end his 
baseball career. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez, a 25-year-old Venezuelan who hit .300 in 350 at-bats for the White 
Sox last season, was held in jail while the criminal court decided which 
charges he would face. 
</P>
<P>
Criminal Judge Ibelise Duran freed Martinez, who has been accused of beating a 
Caracas stadium guard with a bat on Dec. 20 after the guard forbade him to 
enter the park through an entrance not meant for players. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez could be ordered to remain in Venezuela during the length of the 
trial, which "could last months or years" according to prosecuting attorney 
Luis Naranjo.

SHOEMAKER WON'T BET ON HIMSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bill Shoemaker says he won't make a bet on Patchy Groundfog, the 7-year-old 
chestnut he'll ride Saturday in the race that ends Little Big Man's 
extraordinary 42-year career. 
</P>
<P>
Lack of confidence? Hardly. Shoemaker, who had his pick of any horse that ran 
according to the unusual conditions of the race, let his agent, Bill (Bear) 
Barisoff, choose his mount, and Patchy Groundfog, who will run coupled with 
Ofanto, has been established as the 2-1 favorite by Jeff Tufts, the Santa Anita 
linemaker. Bob Mieszerski, the handicapper for The Times, is picking Patchy 
Groundfog, the stronger part of the entry, to win. 
</P>
<P>
Racing rules permit jockeys to bet on their own horses, but someone else -- his 
wife Cindy, probably -- will be collecting souvenir tickets for Shoemaker. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever I've bet on a horse I'm riding, I haven't done too well," Shoemaker 
said. "I haven't won those races too many times." 
</P>
<P>
The Shoemaker finale will be the first and last running of the Legend's Last 
Ride Handicap, a $100,000 mile race on the grass for 4-year-olds and up. To 
accommodate ABC, which is televising the race -- on a delayed basis in Los 
Angeles -- the stake will be the fifth race, with a post time of about 2:45 
p.m. The program begins at 12:15. 
</P>
<P>
The oldest jockey in the Last Ride will be riding the oldest horse in the race. 
Shoemaker, 58, has never ridden Patchy Groundfog, a New York-bred who has won 
14 of 47 starts and earned $540,855. Patchy Groundfog is a grandson of Olden 
Times, who won the 1962 San Juan Capistrano in one of Shoemaker's canniest 
rides. Patchy Groundfog, making his first start this year, had two wins, a 
second and a third in mile races last year, including a victory in the San 
Francisco Mile at Golden Gate Fields. 
</P>
<P>
To make sure Shoemaker has a mount Saturday, he was allowed to pick two 
alternates, and they are Shining Steel and Ofanto. In the event Patchy 
Groundfog is scratched, the jockey on either of those other horses would have 
to give up his mount, although the original rider would still share in the 
purse. 
</P>
<P>
The 12-horse lineup for the Last Ride, with jockey, weight and morning-line 
odds: 
</P>
<P>
Happy Toss, Fernando Toro, 116 pounds, 8-1; Exemplary Leader, Eddie 
Delahoussaye, 115, 12-1; Splendor Catch, Gary Stevens, 116, 12-1; Shining 
Steel, Robbie Davis, 115, 20-1; Ofanto, Martin Pedroza, 116, 2-1; Nediym, 
Russell Baze, 115, 6-1; River Master, Sandy Hawley, 116, 15-1; Colson, Pat 
Valenzuela, 116, 10-1; Patchy Groundfog, Bill Shoemaker, 118, 2-1; Oraibi, 
Corey Black, 117, 8-1; Rampoldi, Gary Boulanger, 115, 20-1, and Bosphorus, 
Chris McCarron, 115, 5-1. Rambo's Hall, Tokatee and Hollywood Reporter are on 
the also-eligible list. 
</P>
<P>
In 1966, when Johnny Longden rode his last race, winning the San Juan 
Capistrano by a nose with George Royal over Plaque and Bobby Ussery, there was 
speculation that the eight other jockeys, caught up in the sentimentality of 
the occasion, didn't give 100%. 
</P>
<P>
One of the eight was 34-year-old Bill Shoemaker, riding Cedar Key, winner of 
the San Luis Rey Stakes and the second betting choice to Hill Rise. 
</P>
<P>
"They (other jockeys) don't give you anything," Shoemaker said Thursday. "We 
were trying to beat (Longden). My horse was about fifth or sixth turning for 
home. When I saw I couldn't win, I started rooting for John to win." 
</P>
<P>
Another jockey in the Longden race was Walter Blum, now a steward at Gulfstream 
Park. Blum's San Juan mount was Or et Argent, who raced near the pace before 
finishing seventh, just ahead of Cedar Key. 
</P>
<P>
"We all wanted to see Johnny go out a winner, but when the gates opened, that 
didn't make any difference, because we all rode the way we always did," Blum 
said Thursday from Florida. "After the race, we were all happy that Johnny had 
won, except Ussery, I guess. He thought Longden had fouled him. But Johnny had 
no more fouled him than I'm fouling you right now." 
</P>
<P>
There has been speculation that Shoemaker's last race will be a setup. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to win on my own merits and not the other way," Shoemaker said. "Those 
other jocks are pros; they know what to do. And it's not going to be the end of 
the world if I don't win. I'm not going to get down on my knees and cry if I 
don't win." 
</P>
<P>
Bayakoa, last year's champion older filly or mare and a distant second to 
Sunday Silence in the horse-of-the-year voting, will become the first 1989 
Eclipse Award winner to start this year when she runs at Santa Anita Sunday in 
the $150,000 Santa Maria Handicap at 1 1/16 miles. 
</P>
<P>
Bayakoa could add to a big day for trainer Ron McAnally, who is expected to 
saddle his grass expert, Hawkster, in the $500,000 Charles H. Strub Stakes, 
which is at 1 1/4 miles on dirt. Hawkster was zero for six on dirt last year, 
but he likes off tracks, and McAnally figures there are no standouts in the 
Strub. Hawkster worked five furlongs Thursday on the main track in a handy :59 
3/5. 
</P>
<P>
Bayakoa lost only two of 11 races last year, and one of the defeats was by a 
half-length to Miss Brio in the Santa Maria. 
</P>
<P>
Gorgeous, who ran a game second to Bayakoa in the Breeders' Cup Distaff, losing 
by 1 1/2 lengths, faces another formidable opponent Saturday in the $200,000 La 
Canada, a 1 1/8-mile race for 4-year-old fillies. Also in the six-horse field 
is Akinemod, who has won six of seven races overall -- including two straight 
this year -- and was an 18-length winner in the El Encino on Jan. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Luthier's Launch drew the inside post and will be ridden by Alex Solis and 
carry 117 pounds. Outside her, in order, are Kelly, Pat Valenzuela, 114 pounds; 
Akinemod, Gary Stevens, 122; Excellent Lady, Chris McCarron, 115; Lucky Song, 
Robbie Davis, 117, and Gorgeous, Eddie Delahoussaye, 125. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Racing's narrow-mindedness reached new proportions last Saturday when the 
Thoroughbred Racing Assns., one of the sponsors of the Eclipse Awards, was 
reluctant to pay the plane fare for Kent Desormeaux to fly to Los Angeles to 
participate in the national telecast that announced his selection as the year's 
outstanding jockey. The TRA reportedly is paying ABC's Jim McKay $100,000 to be 
its national spokesman for a year and is the same organization that sets the 
price for the annual Eclipse dinner. This year's affair, at $250 a plate, will 
be attended by more than 1,000 people a week from tonight in Miami Beach, Fla. 
. . . Desormeaux is moving from Maryland to Santa Anita, but holdover 
suspension days from last year will prevent him from riding in California until 
Feb. 14. 
</P>
<P>
It will be announced today that Rhythm was given high weight of 126 pounds in 
the New York Jockey Club's Experimental Handicap, an annual theoretical rating 
of 3-year-olds based on their 2-year-old careers. Next in the weights was Grand 
Canyon at 125 pounds, followed by Summer Squall, Adjudicating and Slavic at 124 
pounds apiece. Rhythm beat Grand Canyon in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile and won 
the Eclipse Award for 2-year-old colts. 
</P>
<P>
Go for Wand, the champion 2-year-old filly who also won her Breeders' Cup race, 
got 123 pounds in a separate Experimental rating, followed by Stella Madrid at 
121 and Sweet Roberta at 120. . . . The ratings were compiled by racing 
secretaries Bruce Lombardi, Howard Battle and Tommy Trotter. . . . The last 
high-weighted colt to win the Kentucky Derby was Spectacular Bid in 1979.

TRAFFIC HAS STATE ON ROAD TO RUIN, 2 REPORTS WARN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD B. TAYLOR, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Traffic congestion strangling California freeways may become the most important 
environmental and economic issue of the decade, according to two very different 
groups, the Sierra Club and the more conservative Californians for Better 
Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
In its annual "Green State of the State" report released today, the Sierra Club 
warned that, unless dramatic changes are made in California's transportation 
system, the state is headed for worsening traffic congestion and environmental 
catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
"Transportation is California's environmental issue of the decade," the club 
contended, and the masses of cars carrying only the driver are what "fuel the 
problems of smog, global warming, oil spills and contamination." 
</P>
<P>
Putting the traffic problems in economic terms, Californians for Better 
Transportation reported that the rapidly increasing congestion on the state's 
freeways and urban streets already costs motorists $17 billion a year in lost 
time, increased fuel and car repair costs. 
</P>
<P>
"Transportation may be the economic issue of the '90s," said Ray Remy, a 
spokesman for the highway lobby group and president of the Los Angeles Area 
Chamber of Commerce. "If we can't move goods and people, that is only going to 
have increasing economic consequences." 
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Club and Californians for Better Transportation strongly support the 
complex gasoline tax measure that will be on the June ballot. The proposition 
would allow the state to raise $18 billion over the next 15 years to fight 
congestion and to come up with mass transit alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere is the problem more acute than in Southern California. Los Angeles 
leads the nation in every negative traffic indicator, according to a third new 
traffic study. No other big city relies so heavily on already congested 
freeways and urban streets to move people and goods, according to the study by 
Texas A&amp;M University transportation experts. 
</P>
<P>
The nut of the problem is that transportation expenditures have not kept pace 
with California's rapid population growth. As a result, traffic in urban areas 
such as Southern California and San Francisco is grinding to a halt. California 
now is last among states in highway spending per mile, and funds for rapid 
transit projects have been cut back in the past decade, critics say. 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, traffic has increased by 55% since 1980 and now stands at 241 
billion vehicle-miles a year, but the miles of new road construction have 
increased less than 2% in the same period. Two-thirds of the existing roads are 
in "fair to very poor condition," and the cost of bringing them up to good 
standards is estimated at $8.6 billion, according to Californians for Better 
Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Club report -- called "Heading the Wrong Way: Redirecting 
California's Failed Transportation Policy" -- sharply criticized government at 
all levels over the past quarter-century, contending that politicians have 
failed to fund, build and maintain a modern transportation system. 
</P>
<P>
The environmentalists take dead aim at those developers and government agencies 
that have carved up rural areas, creating urban sprawl that in turn puts more 
traffic on already overburdened freeways and roads. The new highways and 
freeways that have followed such developments have been built at public expense 
for private gain without thought to environmental damage, the club charged. 
</P>
<P>
"In Los Angeles, an astonishing two-thirds of the urban space is dedicated to 
transportation," the club's experts reported. They said that cars account for 
more than half the state's urban air pollution and that highway expansion 
projects damage or destroy wildlife habitats. 
</P>
<P>
"How we solve the problems created by the state's worsening transportation 
system is the most important environmental decision California will make going 
into the 21st Century," the Sierra Club concluded. The club is demanding that 
more emphasis be put on getting drivers to car-pool or ride-share and that more 
effort be put into developing urban mass transit. 
</P>
<P>
While the Sierra Club and Californians for Better Transportation are very 
different groups -- the one representing environmentalists, the other a 
coalition of highway user groups -- their studies have brought them to many of 
the same conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
"Traffic congestion is threatening to shut down the state's road and highway 
system," said Jack Maltester, president of Californians for Better 
Transportation. And the results have a direct impact not only on the movement 
of goods and services, but on the motorist's pocketbook. 
</P>
<P>
The highway group's report found that by 1988 congestion had added 20 minutes 
to the average commuter's drive time, and that figure is expected to double or 
triple in the next 10 years if nothing is done. The average motorist pays 
$1,200 a year because of the delays, added fuel and repair costs, the report 
stated. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, traffic congestion is expected to cost commuters and their 
employers even more in lost time, wages, fuel and vehicle maintenance by the 
year 2010 than it will cost residents and businesses in Los Angeles County, 
according to the Southern California Assn. of Governments, a regional planning 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
That's because Orange County began experiencing tremendous growth with fewer 
freeway and major arterial miles in place, and because there are fewer 
alternate routes available to motorists when tie-ups occur, transportation 
experts say. 
</P>
<P>
If transportation projects already planned and funded are completed, traffic 
congestion will cost Orange County residents and businesses a total of $9 
billion annually by the year 2010, compared to $8.8 billion in Los Angeles, 
studies show. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, the last year for which such estimates are available, congestion cost 
Orange County residents and businesses an estimated $392.1 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line, Maltester said, is that the state's motorists are "paying a 
premium to drive on rough, congested roads."

MISSION VIEJO CO.: A PROUD LEGACY MARRED BY DISCORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
MISSION VIEJO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Long before the red tile roofs of Mission Viejo sprawled across southern Orange 
County's foothills, the community took shape on a mass of blueprints and 
photographs prepared by the fledgling Mission Viejo Co. 
</P>
<P>
In those days, the company consisted of three executives, a bookkeeper and a 
secretary, and it grew up with warm community support. But today, that support 
is being tested as Mission Viejo grows more independent from the company that 
built it. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the company, which now boasts more than 300 employees, nurtured 
its proud creation, sponsoring and sustaining various civic organizations that 
helped govern local affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a real sense of working together to build this community," recalls 
City Councilman Norman P. Murray, regarded by many as Mission Viejo's senior 
statesman. "People pitched in, and the company took great pride in its work." 
</P>
<P>
Murray, one of many Mission Viejo residents who laud the Mission Viejo Co. for 
its architecture and management style, remains among the company's most loyal 
defenders in Mission Viejo, but that has become a more controversial 
proposition. 
</P>
<P>
"The Mission Viejo Co. has tried to run this place like a company town," said 
Milton Gerloff, president of Citizens Against Lake Mandatory Membership. "They 
do what they think is best for us, no matter what we think." 
</P>
<P>
Melody Carruth, who, as a leader of Citizens to Save Laguna Hills, has butted 
heads with the Mission Viejo Co. and its representatives, is equally vehement: 
"Most people in this area view the Mission Viejo Co. as a bunch of thugs," she 
said. "It'd be great if the company would just stick to what it does best, 
which is build beautiful homes." 
</P>
<P>
And City Councilman Robert A. Curtis, probably the company's harshest critic 
and the subject of a recall effort that it backs, is especially blunt: "The 
Mission Viejo Co.'s whole approach is: You agree with them or you will be 
destroyed." 
</P>
<P>
The community is partly to blame for the rift between residents and the 
company, as politicians like Curtis make hay blasting the Mission Viejo Co. As 
the city enters its municipal adolescence, strife with the parent company may 
be a natural expression of independence, company and city officials agree. 
</P>
<P>
But critics say the company also shoulders much responsibility for the 
breakdown in trust. Since its 1972 acquisition by New York-based Philip Morris 
Cos., and particularly in the two years since Mission Viejo became a city, the 
Mission Viejo Co. has become increasingly obstinate and remote, they say. 
</P>
<P>
"I find it very strange," said Mayor Christian W. Keena, who offers glowing 
praise of the company's work but remains puzzled by some of its recent actions. 
"They've built this wonderful community, but they've really hurt their own 
public image. . . . They've just decided not to be open." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the company's image problems can be traced to some of its forays into 
the public arena. In 1988, it backed a recall election in Laguna Beach -- 
though at first it denied its participation -- and recently the company has 
pumped thousands of dollars into a Mission Viejo annexation fight and recall 
election. 
</P>
<P>
It has cast large numbers of proxy ballots to influence homeowners' association 
races, backed lawsuits and petition drives, and dispatched highly paid 
political consultants to contest measures it dislikes. In 1983, it even waged a 
campaign against a group of store owners for displaying American flags. The 
company considered them a form of advertising. 
</P>
<P>
But the Mission Viejo Co., in that as in most other disputes, insists that its 
main responsibility to property owners is to protect and complete the 
community's master plan, devised in the early 1960s and only changed slightly 
in the years since. 
</P>
<P>
"We've made promises to this community that we would complete this community 
according to the plan," said David A. Celestin, the company's vice president 
for planning and governmental relations. "We have objected to efforts to change 
that plan, and we will continue to." 
</P>
<P>
But Celestin, in a wide-ranging interview last month, agreed that the past few 
years have not always been smooth ones, at least in terms of the company's 
relations with the local government. 
</P>
<P>
"You're going to have people complaining anywhere, and, yes, we have some 
here," he said. "We have the 'Nimbys' (Not in My Back Yard), and we have what I 
call 'IGMs,' the 'I Got Mine's.' " 
</P>
<P>
Much of the recent controversy dates from Curtis' efforts to annex a pie-shaped 
piece of property on Mission Viejo's western border. That area, known as Aegean 
Hills, is so closely affiliated with Mission Viejo that residents' addresses 
say Mission Viejo and even the freeway exit fails to distinguish between the 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the City Council voted 5 to 0 to proceed with plans for annexing the 
neighborhood, but company officials strongly objected, saying the annexation 
would compromise the company's master plan. 
</P>
<P>
The company helped support a petition drive opposing the annexation and urged 
its employees to participate in the effort, a suggestion that stunned city 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the council reversed itself, voting 3 to 2 against the annexation. 
Still, Curtis' persistence incurred the company's wrath, and it has spent more 
than $57,000 to aid the recall campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis claims that the company backs his recall, which will be decided by a 
Feb. 27 election, because he has supported slow-growth measures, but the 
company denies that, saying it grows solely out of the annexation dispute. 
</P>
<P>
For whichever reason, the company's actions strike some residents as heavy 
paternalism and overkill. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just ridiculous that they've reacted like this," said Virginia Lavan, 
chairwoman of a group called Citizens Against Coercion by the Mission Viejo Co. 
"All just because of a disagreement about annexation? They're trying to silence 
someone who opposes them." 
</P>
<P>
Celestin disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not challenging the council's right to run its city," he said. "But we 
think people have a right to be listened to, and as long as they exercise that 
right, we'll be there to support them." 
</P>
<P>
According to some observers, what has hurt the company's image more than its 
recent political adventures, however, is its mechanism for dealing with the 
public. James G. Gilleran, the company's president and chief executive officer, 
rarely makes public comments, and local leaders complain that he is 
unresponsive and difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Gilleran is not the only company official who is elusive; normally, all press 
and public questions are referred to Wendy Wetzel, the company's spokeswoman. 
When Celestin agreed to be interviewed last month, Wetzel was openly surprised, 
saying it was the first interview request in years that she could remember 
having been approved. 
</P>
<P>
"That's really a matter of corporate and personal style," Celestin said. "Jim 
Gilleran wants to make sure that any information that is provided is accurate 
and correct, so he wants to check all of it before it goes out." 
</P>
<P>
But the reluctance of top company officials to deal openly with city leaders 
and members of the public has taken a toll on the company's public image. It 
shows up in contrast to the generally positive reputation enjoyed by the Santa 
Margarita Co. 
</P>
<P>
"The Mission Viejo Co.'s style is somewhat different from the Santa Margarita 
Co., which tends to be very open and very pro-information," Keena said. "That 
makes a big difference in the way they are perceived." 
</P>
<P>
At Santa Margarita, President and Chief Executive Officer Anthony R. Moiso 
often speaks publicly, dedicating local projects, answering press questions and 
meeting with local leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Moiso, a former executive vice president of the Mission Viejo Co., was 
reluctant to comment on the differences between the two organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Moiso and other observers suggest that public image may matter less to 
the Mission Viejo Co. now that its time in the city is drawing to a close. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to be here forever," Moiso said, pointing to a set of wall maps 
that outline his company's development plans for South County. "They're just 
winding down." 
</P>
<P>
As critics bridle at the Mission Viejo Co., many blame its problems on Philip 
Morris, a Fortune 500 company best known as a cigarette maker. Under Philip 
Morris, the Mission Viejo Co. has lost its local identity, critics say. 
</P>
<P>
That has become a rallying cry of Councilman Curtis' anti-recall campaign. 
Curtis almost never refers to the Mission Viejo Co. by that name, instead 
directing his barbs higher up the corporate ladder, at Philip Morris. It is a 
technique that sets Curtis up as the David against a New York-based Goliath, 
and it appears to resonate in a community that prides itself on its insularity. 
</P>
<P>
The recall, Curtis said, as he does frequently, "is an attempt by Philip Morris 
to dictate the affairs of this city." 
</P>
<P>
Repeated calls to the Philip Morris Cos.' New York headquarters were not 
returned or were referred to the Mission Viejo Co. Although two Philip Morris 
officials, as well as two former officials, agreed to discuss the company's 
relationship with the Mission Viejo Co., they would not allow their names to be 
used. 
</P>
<P>
Those officials and others, however, said that Philip Morris probably exercises 
little direct control over the Mission Viejo Co.'s operations. Moiso, who 
worked closely with Philip Morris during its takeover of the Mission Viejo Co., 
said he doubts that Philip Morris would meddle deeply in local affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"They're very decentralized and very well-managed," one former Philip Morris 
executive said of the New York company. "If anything, I would attribute the 
problems in Mission Viejo to their getting too little direction from New York, 
not too much. It sounds to me like a case of the extremities getting further 
and further from the heart." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, some local leaders, including Keena and Curtis, believe that 
Philip Morris is divesting itself of its real estate operations. In the 
process, Curtis and others say, the company may be rushing to make quick 
profits at the expense of the community. 
</P>
<P>
Wetzel and Celestin would not respond directly to questions about whether the 
company is quitting the real estate business other than to say that such 
questions are "always under review." 
</P>
<P>
What is clear, however, is that the company's run inside Mission Viejo is just 
about over. By the mid-1990s, Mission Viejo's last home will have been built 
and sold, and the company that built the town will have turned over its 
management to the council that now governs it. 
</P>
<P>
For the company, then, the recent travails come just as officials would like to 
bow out of Mission Viejo gracefully. And despite more than two decades of 
closely parenting Mission Viejo, they threaten to mar the company's legacy with 
discord. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Celestin gives no hint that recent events have unduly alarmed company 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"We're proud of this community," he said. "It's a place. You can see it, you 
can feel it, you can smell it. We plan to leave it the way we set out to. We're 
going to complete the plan." 
</P>

ILLEGAL DISCHARGES COST TIMES $30,000

State water quality officials have leveled a $30,000 fine against the Los 
Angeles Times for discharging water contaminated with chemicals into storm 
drains in three separate incidents at its Orange County plant since November, 
officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel very strongly there was negligence, not so much with management but 
with L.A. Times personnel, and the L.A. Times is responsible for its 
employees," said Bruce Paine, an engineering associate for the state Regional 
Water Quality Control Board. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Paine added, it was found that none of the illegal discharges 
caused major damage to water quality or the storm drain system. 
</P>
<P>
Paine said the amount of the fine is in a "middle-of-the-road" range, compared 
to those generally issued about six or eight times a year to Orange County 
businesses accused of violating the law. 
</P>
<P>
Ernie Vitucci, general manager of The Times Orange County Edition, said he 
received word of the fine in a telephone conversation with a state water 
quality inspector. The newspaper, however, has yet to receive formal 
notification. 
</P>
<P>
"After three spills in a fairly limited amount of time, a fine seems 
appropriate," Vitucci said. Times officials said they probably will not contest 
the fine at a hearing scheduled for Feb. 13 before the Water Quality Control 
Board. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent incident came last week when more than 500 gallons of chilled 
water containing a non-hazardous solution of corrosion inhibitor -- used to 
cool the plant's main computers -- was discharged into storm drains at the 
plant. Workers drained the water to make way for construction in an apparently 
mistaken belief that the solution could be dumped in the storm drain. Under 
state law, however, nothing but rainwater can be directed into a storm drain. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, The Times has been undergoing a major renovation of its Costa 
Mesa facility. 
</P>
<P>
In investigating the incident, Orange County and state inspectors learned of a 
similar incident last Nov. 27 when chilled, contaminated water also spilled 
into the storm drains at the plant, on Sunflower Avenue just east of Harbor 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
In the third incident, water containing a relatively small amount of developing 
fluid, used to make newspaper printing plates, drained into the storm channels 
for 35 days before being discovered by Times officials in December. The spill 
occurred because a pipe was improperly connected to the storm drain instead of 
a sewer drain, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Vitucci said drainage of the chilled water planned for Monday will be closely 
monitored. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the newspaper was fined $5,000 for an incident in which contaminated 
water spilled into the storm drains.

UCI PLACES ITS 1ST STUDENT ON REGENTS' BOARD

<P>
For the first time, a UC Irvine student has been selected to serve on the 
University of California Board of Regents. 
</P>
<P>
Jenny Doh, a 23-year-old senior majoring in political science, will begin 
serving a one-year term as the non-voting student member of the board, which 
governs the nine-campus UC system. 
</P>
<P>
Doh said financial aid, the quality of education, cultural diversity and the 
impact of university growth on students are the most important issues facing 
the UC system. 
</P>
<P>
State officials are considering adding three new campuses to the system to 
accommodate projected increases in the number of eligible students. And several 
existing campuses, including Irvine, are in the middle of major expansion 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
"I have first-hand experience with growth because of all the building going on 
here," Doh said of the 26-year-old campus. "Students feel isolated in the 
system when they see just growth, growth, growth." 
</P>
<P>
As the system grows and new campuses open, it should embrace and cultivate the 
changing ethnic makeup and cultural diversity of the state, Doh advised. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, financial aid can be used both to attract more minority 
students and also help students who work their way through college graduate 
more quickly, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Doh also stressed the need to keep student-to-teacher ratios manageable as the 
system grows. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the proposed UC expansion is tied to a June ballot measure that would 
modify the 1979 Gann initiative, which limited the expenditures of state and 
local taxes. Doh said she was "crossing her fingers" that the measure succeeds, 
noting that without the additional campuses, serious overcrowding at existing 
campuses will occur. 
</P>
<P>
The student regent is supposed to give the board a student's perspective on 
issues and does not serve as a student advocate. 
</P>
<P>
"My first and foremost job is to serve the state and the university," Doh said. 
"I'm a messenger to the board and to the students." 
</P>
<P>
UCI's Associated Students president Susan Barnes, who defeated Doh in the 
university's student presidential race last year, said she thought Doh would be 
a good regent and would offer the board a different perspective from that of 
representatives from more established UC campuses such as UCLA and Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a boost for Irvine. It will shed attention on us for a year," Barnes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Doh was chosen from among 65 other candidates by a special regents committee; 
her term begins in July. 
</P>
<P>
Doh, who moved to the United States from her native Korea in 1974, said her 
exposure to diverse groups of people sparked her interest in university 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was in high school in Bakersfield, I thought I was the only person in 
the world to feel how it is to be an Asian-American," she said. "When I came to 
UCI, I realized I was not alone . . . I discovered my rights." 
</P>
<P>
Doh has been involved in ethnic minority and gay rights causes and served as a 
representative on UCI's Think Tank on Cultural Diversity. She said she would 
urge the regents to look closely at the needs of these groups. 
</P>
<P>
"I see a lot of homophobia and racism," Doh said. Although she said she is not 
gay, she said, "It hurts me to see my friends go through such pain.".

GILL-NET FOES GAIN IN BALLOT BID; 
</P>
<P>
INITIATIVE: MORE THAN 150,000 SIGNATURES HAVE BEEN GATHERED FOR A VOTE ON 
PROHIBITING THE FISHING METHOD IN COASTAL WATERS. THE SEAFOOD INDUSTRY OPPOSES 
SUCH A BAN.

<P>
Gill-net fishing, under growing attack from environmentalists and others, was 
addressed on two fronts Thursday, as a statewide drive to prohibit the 
controversial fishing method moved into high gear. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of an initiative to extend a ban on gill-net fishing to Southern 
California coastal waters announced that they have gathered more than 150,000 
signatures to put the measure on the ballot in November, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblywoman Doris Allen (R-Cypress), the measure's principal sponsor, said 
950,000 signatures are needed by early May to qualify the initiative, which is 
opposed, in large part, by the commercial fishing and seafood processing 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
Gill nets are narrow-weave devices that are weighted to extend upright in the 
water to catch fish by entangling their gills in the meshes. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed ban would restrict the use of the monofilament nets within three 
miles of the coast from Point Conception to the Mexican border, and within a 
mile of any of the Channel Islands off Santa Barbara. The initiative would also 
make permanent a similar gill-net ban along the central and Northern California 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
In Irvine meanwhile, a committee of scientists, economists and marine 
biologists held the first of three days of meetings to study the impact in 
outer-ocean waters of gill nets on marine mammals, particularly dolphins. The 
sessions are sponsored by the Washington-based National Academy of Sciences, 
which was contracted by the Commerce Department to issue recommendations later 
this year on changes in federal policy toward gill nets in U.S. waters. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, much of the testimony focused on the potential impact of a 
gill-net ban on the tuna industry. In the open ocean, large schools of 
yellowfin often stick close to porpoises. As a result, the mammals often become 
entangled in the nets used to snare tuna. About 2.2 million tons of tuna are 
caught worldwide each year. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, Allen started her initiative drive in mid-December after 
several legislative attempts to restrict the use of gill nets by "near-shore" 
fishermen failed. Last month, Assembly Bill 1, a package of gill-net 
restrictions introduced by Allen, was rejected by the Assembly Committee on 
Water, Parks and Wildlife, intensifying the lawmaker's push to qualify the 
initiative for the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"The commercial fishing lobby is very strong, and it is time we take our cause 
to the people," Allen told members of a Long Beach tuna-fishing club that 
donated $20,000 to the signature-gathering effort. 
</P>
<P>
Allen estimated that it will cost about $350,000 to gather enough signatures, 
much of it going to a paid consultant coordinating the effort. So far, she 
said, the Committee to Ban GillNets has raised about $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Limits on the use of the fine-mesh nets have long been sought by sport 
fishermen and environmentalists, who say that fish populations are being 
depleted and that dolphins, seals and other marine mammals are being destroyed 
when they are inadvertently caught in the nets. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, state officials blamed gill nets for the deaths of more than 50 sea 
lions that washed ashore in Orange County during a three-week span. 
</P>
<P>
"The time is now to once and for all to rid California's waters of the 
destructive practice of gill-net fishing," said Allen, an active gill-net 
opponent since 1984, even though her 71st Assembly District in western Orange 
County is landlocked. "It is cruel the way these mammals become entangled in 
this net and die." 
</P>
<P>
According to the most current figures available from the state Department of 
Fish and Game, 6,500 sea lions, harbor seals and porpoises were reported killed 
in gill and similar trammel nets in 1986-87. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Frumkes, a private Los Angeles biologist working with Allen's initiative 
committee, said fishermen using nets have contributed to the near-elimination 
of the population of white sea bass off Southern California and have cut the 
number of halibut in local waters in half. 
</P>
<P>
But industry spokesmen said Allen and others have exaggerated the depletion as 
well as the numbers of mammals killed by gill nets to rally support for the 
ban. They said such a ban would destroy a multimillion-dollar-a-year industry. 
</P>
<P>
About 125 gill-net fishermen operate in Southern California, mostly out of San 
Pedro and Ventura harbors; many of those fish only in the zone one to three 
miles offshore. 
</P>
<P>
Under Allen's initiative, gill-net fishermen would be compensated financially 
for switching to hooks or other techniques if the ban passes and takes effect 
Jan. 1, 1994. The fishermen would be paid the equivalent of an average year's 
catch with money raised from a new $3 marine-protection stamp that all sport 
fishermen would be required to buy annually in addition to a fishing license. 
</P>
<P>
But Tony West, president of the San Pedro-based California Gillnetter's Assn., 
said Allen's "payoff would be merely a drop in the bucket" and would not cover 
the cost of converting small boats used for coastal fishing into vessels 
capable of longer-duration, open-ocean fishing. 
</P>
<P>
"A number of guys who are in their 40s and 50s, who have been fishing all their 
life, would suddenly be out in the cold," West said. "It would be tragic. We'd 
be the victims of a massive smear campaign." 
</P>
<P>
Seafood wholesalers also predicted that limiting gill nets would drive up the 
price of fresh fish -- particularly halibut, white sea bass and shark -- in 
local markets. 
</P>
<P>
"If that ban goes through, prices will go sky high," said Rob Ross, executive 
director of the California Fisheries and Seafood Institute, a lobbying group 
for fish processors. "It is a destructive kind of law that will only put people 
out of work." 
</P>
<P>
Staff writer Ted Johnson contributed to this report.

<P>
MARINE RESOURCES PROTECTION ACT 
</P>
<P>
What is it? A proposed initiative for the November ballot that would, among 
other things, ban gill net fishing in Southern California coastal waters. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents' argument: Gill nets have significantly depleted populations of 
coastal fish, such as halibut and white sea bass, and killed scores of marine 
mammals including dolphins and sea lions that are inadvertently caught in the 
nets. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents' argument: Eliminating gill nets used to catch halibut, sea bass and 
shark will drive up the price of fresh seafood in local markets. They also 
dispute claims about the impact of gill nets on local fish and marine mammal 
populations. 
</P>
<P>
Key provisions: 
</P>
<P>
Prohibit gill net fishing beginning Jan. 1, 1994, within three miles of the 
coast from Point Conception to the Mexican border, and within a mile of any of 
the Channel Islands off Santa Barbara. Restricted areas would become known as 
Marine Resource Protection Zones. 
</P>
<P>
Make permanent a similar gill net ban along Central and Northern California 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
Compensate commercial fishermen for the loss of their gill net permits with 
money raised from a new $3 fee assessed sport fishermen through 1995. The new 
fee would be paid by the anglers in addition to their annual $11 fishing 
license. 
</P>
<P>
Require the state Department of Fish and Game to establish four new "ocean 
water" ecological reserves off the California coast for marine research. The 
four areas would be identified by a special commission. 
</P>
<P>
Require the Department of Fish and Game to monitor and evaluate the daily catch 
of commercial fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
Principal author of the initiative: Assemblywoman Doris Allen (R-Cypress). 
</P>
<P>
Needed to qualify for the November ballot: About 950,000 signatures. Proponents 
say as of Feb. 1 about 150,000 signatures had been gathered. 
</P>
<P>
Total cost of signature drive: $350,000. Proponents say as of Feb. 1 about 
$100,000 had been raised.

In a brazen midday robbery of a South Coast Plaza jewelry store Thursday, 
gunmen stole $450,000 worth of diamond jewelry and escaped into the busy mall, 
police and the store manager said. 
</P>
<P>
No one was injured in the 12:20 p.m. robbery at Black, Starr &amp; Frost 
jewelers, located on the second floor of the Nordstrom's wing of the mall. The 
three unmasked men escaped on foot through an exit 60 feet from the jeweler and 
may have met up with two other men before leaving the area, police said. 
</P>
<P>
After entering the store, one of the bandits ordered three employees and two 
customers to lie on the floor, while another held a gun to the manager's neck 
and ordered him to open a jewelry cabinet, store manager Barry Lacey said. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview, Lacey gave the following account of the robbery: "I 
was putting sterling silver jewelry into a wall cabinet when they all burst in. 
One put my arm behind me, stuck a gun in the side of my neck and said 'Open the 
case.' I tried to turn around and see if (the gun) was real, when he pushed me 
aside and said 'open it' again. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked him 'which one?' because the sterling silver jewelry isn't worth that 
much," Lacey continued. "I told him I'd open any case he wanted me to. He 
hesitated, then pointed to a case of solitaires (jewelry with a single diamond 
setting) and said, 'That one.' 
</P>
<P>
"I was fumbling with the keys, to find the right one, and apparently I took too 
long because he pushed me out of the way and started kicking in the backs of 
two display cases." 
</P>
<P>
One man scooped the jewelry into a gym bag held open by a companion, he said. 
They emptied one case and half of a second case before the three decided to 
flee into the mall, Lacey said, adding that most of the take was diamond rings 
with solitaire settings. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa police are speculating that the robbers drove from the mall parking 
lot to nearby Larkspur Street, abandoned a stolen car, and left in another car, 
possibly with two other men, Lt. Tom Warnack said. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the holdup, police received a report from a Larkspur Street 
resident of five suspicious-looking men getting into a blue, older model, 
American-made sedan. When officers arrived at the scene they found an 
abandoned, blue 1985 Oldsmobile traced as stolen from Inglewood, Warnack said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they have no further leads in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Lacey, who said he had never been a robbery victim in his 12 years in the 
jewelry business, described the team as amateurish. 
</P>
<P>
"They seemed very unprofessional," he said. "When I asked them which case I 
should open, they had to look around to find out what they wanted. I don't 
think they had cased the store." 
</P>
<P>
Lacey said the robbery lasted just under two minutes, according to the timer on 
a security video camera in the store. He said the camera captured images of all 
three men. 
</P>
<P>
Lacey closed the store for five hours after the robbery to take inventory, then 
took his employees out to lunch "to have a drink and relax." 
</P>
<P>
The last reported jewelry store heist in South Coast Plaza was in 1988, when 
four heavily armed men escaped with $1 million in merchandise from Slavick's 
Jewelers. Six jewelry stores have been robbed in five Orange County malls since 
1988.

RETIRED AF COLONEL TO MANAGE CHAMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE L. JONES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Costa Mesa Chamber of Commerce has hired Edward (Lee) Heinz as executive 
manager. Heinz replaces Arlene Schafer, who held the position for three years 
before resigning in December. 
</P>
<P>
Heinz has been executive vice president of the Lompoc Valley Chamber of 
Commerce for the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
Heinz served 28 years in the Air Force before retiring as a full colonel in 
1988. He was commander of the 659th Test and Evaluation Group at Vandenberg Air 
Force Base in Lompoc. 
</P>
<P>
A doctoral candidate in public administration at the University of La Verne, 
Heinz holds two master's degrees from USC, in international relations and 
systems management. He also holds a bachelor's degree in political science from 
UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
"Costa Mesa is very diverse in terms of affluence," Heinz said. "It has South 
Coast Plaza on one end of the spectrum and plenty of small mom-and-pop 
operations on the other. I want to make sure that the chamber represents 
everyone. But first, I plan to do a lot of listening. Then, in about 30 days, 
I'll be ready to make my first recommendations." 
</P>
<P>
Russell T. Gilbert, president of the Costa Mesa Chamber of Commerce, said 
Heinz's leadership background, particularly his emphasis on long-range 
planning, would contribute toward the future growth and success of the chamber.

COSGROVE CASE IS NOW UP TO THE JUDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Participants in a lawsuit challenging City Councilman Cameron Cosgrove's right 
to hold office concluded the first part of their trial Thursday, as a Superior 
Court judge took the matter under advisement. 
</P>
<P>
Saying he hoped that it would be a "matter of days, not weeks," before he 
rendered an opinion, Judge Claude M. Owens concluded the portion of the trial 
devoted to debate of legal matters. 
</P>
<P>
Owens will rule on whether the legal issues alone are enough to decide the 
case. If they are, Cosgrove is expected to retain his seat; if not, the second 
phase of the trial would pick up in March. 
</P>
<P>
In Thursday's session with lawyers, Owens picked holes in each side's 
arguments, leaving both the plaintiffs and the defendants puzzled as to which 
way the judge may be leaning. 
</P>
<P>
"He's very inscrutable," said Thomas M. Jones, lawyer for two Irvine residents 
who filed the case. "I really can't read him at all." 
</P>
<P>
The suit, which has been the object of intense scrutiny and debate in Irvine 
for months, seeks to remove Cosgrove from office, arguing that his seating on 
the council violated Measure D. That measure passed in June, 1988, and stated 
that in certain council elections, residents could circulate a petition to 
prevent a council candidate from taking office. 
</P>
<P>
Measure D applies in elections where an incumbent council member is elected 
mayor, leaving a vacancy on the council. That occurred in 1988, when Larry 
Agran, then a councilman, easily won election as mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Two council seats were open that year, and Cosgrove finished third in the 
balloting by just over 100 votes. But because Agran's seat became open when he 
became mayor, Cosgrove was sworn in as a councilman to fill Agran's unexpired 
term. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is whether Measure D is binding on the 1988 race, since it passed as 
part of that same election. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the courtroom debate centered on another related issue of timing. The 
Measure D petitions calling for a special election to fill Cosgrove's seat were 
dated July 5, 10 days before the secretary of state certified the measure as 
being valid. 
</P>
<P>
The judge has twice questioned Jones about whether the petitions can be 
considered valid since they predate the formal adoption of the law that allowed 
for them. 
</P>
<P>
Howard J. Klein, an Irvine patent attorney and one of the plaintiffs in the 
case, agreed that the timing of the petition posed "an important question, but 
we feel that we have arguments and precedent to support our position." 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for Cosgrove, however, argued that on the basis of the timing alone, 
the case against their client should be thrown out. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty clear," said Franklin J. Lunding, one of two lawyers the City of 
Irvine has retained to represent Cosgrove. "If the petitions weren't good, then 
there is nothing else to decide." JIM NEWTON

STATE TO SEEK SETTLEMENT OR FILE CHARGES AGAINST ROCKWELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state attorney general's office said Thursday it expects to file a civil 
complaint against Rockwell International unless it can reach an out-of-court 
settlement with the firm over alleged hazardous waste violations at its Santa 
Susana Field Laboratory west of Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Atty. Gen. Ken Alex said the case was formally referred to his office 
early Thursday by the state Department of Health Services, which previously had 
cited Rockwell for hazardous waste violations after an inspection last June of 
the 2,668-acre test site. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney general will pursue the case "with an eye toward filing a civil 
complaint," according to Alex. But he said Rockwell will first be approached 
about reaching a settlement, which would result in the filing of a consent 
decree. 
</P>
<P>
Alex said there is little chance the state will drop the case, "unless the 
company gives us information that we're not currently aware of." 
</P>
<P>
Each hazardous waste violation carries a penalty of up to $25,000 per day. 
Rockwell's potential exposure is great, since some of the allegations involve 
long-term non-compliance -- such as years of operating waste treatment 
equipment without needed permits. 
</P>
<P>
However, it was unclear how many counts might be filed in court. State health 
officials originally cited Rockwell for 13 violations after the June 
inspection. But health officials said in the past that they had dropped some 
counts, based on a follow-up investigation and Rockwell's response last October 
to the original citation. 
</P>
<P>
Rich Varenchik, a spokesman in Burbank for the health department's toxic 
substances control division, declined to discuss the number of counts referred 
to the attorney general. Alex said he did not know how many counts will be 
filed, pending a review of the file. 
</P>
<P>
In its inspection last June, the state did not cite Rockwell for toxic spills 
or illegal discharges, but rather for failure to meet compliance deadlines, 
submit required plans and obtain permits for cleanup equipment -- such as 
air-stripping towers the firm is using to treat ground water tainted by 
chemical solvents. 
</P>
<P>
But officials said this does not mean the case is minor. "As a general rule, 
operation without a permit is a serious violation," Alex said. 
</P>
<P>
A Rockwell official said he was irritated and surprised that the health 
department referred the case to the attorney general without telling the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Lafflam, manager of environmental affairs for Rockwell's Rocketdyne 
Division, which runs the Santa Susana lab, said Rockwell had supplied the 
health department with documents missing from the state's files in an effort to 
show "the alleged violations were inaccurate and erroneous. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We thought we were working very closely with them," Lafflam said. "We really 
thought we had resolved most of the issues." 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Susana lab has been engulfed in controversy since reports last spring 
of low level radioactive and chemical contamination caused by nuclear and other 
energy research. The work has been carried out in a 290-acre portion of the 
test site for more than 30 years for the U.S. Department of Energy and its 
predecessor, the Atomic Energy Commission. 
</P>
<P>
However, most of the 13 violations originally cited by the health department 
involved non-nuclear areas of Santa Susana, where Rockwell does rocket testing 
for the Air Force and NASA. 
</P>
<P>
In another development Thursday, DOE regional officials for the first time 
disclosed that President Bush's budget proposal contains $7.6 million for 
environmental cleanup and waste management activities at Santa Susana in fiscal 
1991, well below what agency officials had sought. 
</P>
<P>
Although Bush's budget plan was unveiled Monday, officials at DOE's San 
Francisco operations office said they did not know until Thursday how much 
money was included for the Santa Susana lab, one of the sites under their 
jurisdiction. They said a previous news report citing a budget figure of $9.8 
million was erroneous. 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, DOE officials are seeking $35 million through fiscal 1995 to remove 
contamination from soil, ground water and buildings at Santa Susana and to 
bring equipment into compliance with new pollution control limits. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell, DOE and health officials say existing contamination at the site poses 
no immediate hazard to workers or neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush proposal, which must be considered by Congress, includes $2.8 billion 
next year for environmental cleanup at DOE nuclear weapons plants and test 
sites nationwide, up from $2.2 billion this year, a DOE official said.

ALL-YEAR CLASSES ARE ILLEGAL, PARENTS SAY; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: OPPONENTS OF YEAR-ROUND SCHOOLS SAY THE SCHOOL BOARD DID NOT GIVE 
LEGAL NOTICE FOR THE EXTENSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Valley parents fighting the conversion of 109 Los Angeles schools to year-round 
schedules say they have found legal grounds to block the proposed changes, a 
former school board candidate said Thursday. But a school board attorney 
disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Romey, who has been working with other parents opposed to year-round 
schools, said the Los Angeles Unified School District failed to give proper 
notice of the proposed changes, which would begin this summer. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a good, legal tool to fight this," said Romey, who has run twice for 
the West Valley school board seat. 
</P>
<P>
The California Education Code requires districts intending to convert schools 
from traditional to year-round schedules to publish those plans in a newspaper 
advertisement before November of the year preceding the changes. 
</P>
<P>
Romey said parents are prepared to cite the requirement should the fight move 
from the school board to the courts. 
</P>
<P>
But Richard Mason, special counsel to Los Angeles schools Supt. Leonard 
Britton, said the code does not apply to the district's proposals. 
</P>
<P>
Mason said Thursday the district is exempt from the code requirement because no 
Los Angeles students will be required to attend year-round school. Parents who 
oppose year-round schools can apply for transfers to schools with traditional 
schedules, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mason also said the district may be exempt from the provision because it 
printed notices in 1987, when the board first considered changing schools to 
year-round schedules. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph R. Symkowick, general counsel for the state Department of Education, 
said he is uncertain whether the code requirement applies to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
But in general, Symkowick said, "anyone looking at the case would consider not 
just the letter of the law but its intent, which is to allow for parent input." 
</P>
<P>
Charles Ballinger, executive director of the National Assn. For Year-Round 
education, a nonprofit group supporting year-round schools, said he agreed with 
mason's argument that the requirement does not apply as long as students can 
transfer to schools on traditional schedules. "But none of this has ever gone 
to court," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Britton has recommended that all schools in the district convert to some form 
of year-round schedule by summer, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Romey said she began passing out copies of the code section to San Fernando 
Valley and Westside parents who have attended public hearings and 
demonstrations that drew hundreds of participants in the past two weeks. 
Parents opposed to year-round schools say the plan will require students to 
attend classes in stifling heat and disrupt vacations and child-care 
arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
The school board is expected to make a decision Monday on the controversial 
proposal to increase classroom capacity by 23% through year-round schedules, 
double sessions or larger class sizes. Forty-five of the schools under 
consideration for changes are in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
District officials say the changes are needed to accommodate soaring enrollment 
in the 610,000-student district, the nation's second largest. 
</P>
<P>
"Once the board votes, the question will be, 'Do we go after a temporary 
restraining order?' " Romey said.

FORMER MANAGER OF FAIR CHARGED IN EMBEZZLEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Felony charges of embezzlement and falsifying accounts of public funds were 
filed against the former manager of the Antelope Valley Fair in Lancaster 
Thursday by the Los Angeles county district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
C.W. Adams, 48, who resigned in April after the fair board of directors 
questioned him about budget irregularities including unpaid debts, was charged 
with using about $1,200 worth of fair equipment and funds for personal use. 
</P>
<P>
He was also charged with altering records to conceal more than $100,000 worth 
of unpaid utility bills on the eve of a preliminary state audit in March. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the state auditor general's office is conducting a separate audit 
that should be complete in about two weeks, Deputy Dist. Atty. Stephen L. 
Cooley said. The audit will be reviewed for any information that could lead to 
further criminal charges, Cooley said. The fair is a public entity under the 
auspices of the state Department of Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
Adams denied wrongdoing in interviews with investigators, according to 
documents. He works for a rodeo in Barstow. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors allege that Adams used $700 worth of steel tubing belonging to the 
fair to construct a wrought-iron fence several hundred feet long at his home in 
1986, Cooley said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Adams is accused of buying $500 worth of tires for his Jaguar and 
an all-terrain vehicle and illegally billing the expense to the fair at some 
point between October, 1988, and February of last year, Deputy Dist. Atty. John 
A. Portillo said. 
</P>
<P>
When budget irregularities prompted a review by the state Division of Fairs and 
Expositions in March, 1989, Adams allegedly instructed an employee shortly 
before the audit to conceal more than $100,000 in unpaid utility bills by 
deleting records from a computer and removing documents from a file, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
Adams told investigators the fence was not built with fair materials but with 
tubing left for him at the fair by someone who owed him money, court documents 
say. He maintained that the purchase of the tires with public money was 
legitimate because the fair owed him an equivalent amount of reimbursement for 
work-related travel, the documents say. He also denied falsifying the utility 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Cooley said the explanations were not satisfactory and were not borne out by 
the evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Adams will be arraigned Feb. 5. If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of 
five years and four months on the charges. The charge of falsifying public 
accounts carries an additional penalty of disqualifying the offender from 
holding public office or state employment in California.

EMERGENCY SERVICE PLAN IMPLEMENTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LANIE JONES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seven months after two city ambulances were turned away from a local emergency 
room, the Santa Ana Fire Department on Thursday implemented a plan requiring 
nearby hospitals to accept any sick or injured patient in their assigned area. 
</P>
<P>
"We're saying the patient's best place is probably an emergency room -- more so 
than in the back of an ambulance wandering around the county," explained Santa 
Ana paramedic coordinator Eric Widdell. 
</P>
<P>
Administrators at three community hospitals still object strongly to the city's 
"catchment plan," and one on Tuesday threatened legal action to block it. But 
by Thursday afternoon, they appeared to be cooperating, Fire Chief Allen R. 
Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I know, the (hospital) doors are open and things are working, and I 
have heard nothing to the contrary," Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
Added Craig R. Myers, executive director of Coastal Communities Hospital and a 
leading opponent of the plan: "We do what we're obligated to do -- take care of 
the patients as they come in the door." 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Carter on Tuesday, Myers complained that his hospital still 
lacked specialists in orthopedics, plastic surgery and opthalmology to handle 
emergencies. He had considered seeking a temporary restraining order 
"preventing you from delivering . . . patients to Coastal," or downgrading 
Coastal's emergency license to "urgent care," a move that would effectively 
close the hospital to city ambulances, his letter said. 
</P>
<P>
But, Myers' letter concluded, he had decided to try the city's plan for the 
next 60 to 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the plan's other opponent, Bryan Burklow, administrator of both 
Doctors Hospital of Santa Ana and Santa Ana Hospital Medical Center, also 
reportedly pledged to participate. 
</P>
<P>
So far some officials from the six other hospitals involved have called the 
plan fair. They are UC Irvine Medical Center, Fountain Valley Regional Hospital 
and Medical Center, Western Medical Center-Santa Ana, AMI Medical Center of 
Garden Grove, St. Joseph Hospital of Orange and Healthcare Medical Center of 
Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute concerns the lowest level of emergency service, "basic life 
support" for people with non-life-threatening injuries or illnesses -- a 
fractured leg, a cut or an abdominal pain of several days -- who are brought to 
a hospital by one of Santa Ana's emergency medical technicians. 
</P>
<P>
Coastal and Doctors both operate "basic" emergency rooms, meaning an emergency 
room with a physician on the premises. Santa Ana offers "standby" emergency 
service, meaning a physician is on call. 
</P>
<P>
But all three hospitals contend they have had difficulty recruiting specialists 
like orthopedists to work on-call and so cannot handle every case that city 
ambulances bring. 
</P>
<P>
Their Century City attorney, Carl Weissburg, last week asked Santa Ana 
officials to let the hospitals provide a daily update on what specialists their 
emergency rooms have and what kinds of cases the ambulances should bring them 
-- an idea the city has rejected as impractical. LANIE JONES

UMBERG JOINS CONTEST FOR PRINGLE'S SEAT;

Orange County's most hotly contested Assembly race of 1990 took shape Thursday 
as a second Democrat launched his campaign and another rumored challenger took 
his name out of the running. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Umberg, who quit his job as a federal prosecutor in Irvine last month so 
that he could enter the race to unseat Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden 
Grove), officially announced his candidacy at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Umberg said his experience as a prosecutor, especially in drug cases, gives him 
an edge over the other candidates on one of the most important issues in the 
72nd District, which includes parts of Anaheim, Santa Ana, Garden Grove, 
Westminster and all of Stanton. That issue, he said, is crime. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been very satisfying to have made a direct and immediate impact on the 
crime, drug and gang problems that plague our community," Umberg said at a 
press conference in Santa Ana. "In the state Assembly in Sacramento, I will 
help make our state criminal justice system more effective and efficient." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana City Councilman Miguel A. Pulido, who had been rumored as another 
Democratic contender for the seat, also appeared at the press conference to 
endorse Umberg's candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
"This puts it to rest," Pulido said. "I'm seeking reelection (to the council) 
in November. Crime is a major problem in the (Assembly) district, and we need 
somebody who can manage it." 
</P>
<P>
Umberg's anticipated candidacy has been a divisive issue for Orange County 
Democrats. The chairman of the party's central committee, Michael Balmages, has 
already endorsed Jerry Yudelson for the seat. 
</P>
<P>
The two Democratic candidacies have split the county party into separate camps. 
Balmages charged recently in a letter to Assembly Speaker Willie Brown that "a 
small group of Democrats who have dominated the party's losing tradition" in 
Orange County are responsible for Umberg's candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
Yudelson, who ran unsuccessfully in 1988 against U.S. Rep. Robert K. Dornan 
(R-Garden Grove), is an environmental consultant. He also said the Democratic 
primary could be a heated competition. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Democrats make a severe mistake by trying to out-crime Republicans," 
Yudelson said Thursday. "We have to be the party of economic opportunity and 
economic salvation. Those are the things I want to talk about." 
</P>
<P>
He also called Umberg a "carpetbagger" because Umberg moved into the district 
from Irvine recently so he could run. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he owes it to explain why a yuppie lawyer from Irvine should be 
running in this race less than a month after moving into the district," 
Yudelson said. 
</P>
<P>
Yudelson also promised to examine Umberg's record as a prosecutor, which he 
called "very shallow." 
</P>
<P>
Some Democrats are worried that a messy primary could hurt them in a fall 
campaign against Pringle. Instead of attacking each other, they would rather 
see Pringle on the defensive throughout the year. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats believe that Pringle is vulnerable because of his involvement in a 
decision in the 1988 race to place uniformed guards at several polling places 
in Latino neighborhoods. The incident is still under investigation by the 
Orange County district attorney's office for a possible criminal violation of 
voters' civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
Pringle said: "That's the only issue they think they can try to pin on me. I 
think people in the district are sick and tired of it." 
</P>
<P>
But Umberg said at his press conference: "The incumbent has spent the last year 
fighting for his survival in federal court rather than fighting for our 
concerns in Sacramento. . . . What his campaign did on Election Day in 1988 is 
inexcusable." 
</P>
<P>
Umberg and Yudelson are also pro-choice on abortion, and Pringle, who is 
against abortion, has been targeted by national pro-choice leaders in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Pringle said of the Democratic challengers: "I'm proud to be a top target. 
There's nobody I would rather contrast myself with than the liberal leadership 
in Sacramento."

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JUDGE DROPS CHARGE IN VAN NUYS SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A first-degree murder charge against a Van Nuys man was dismissed Thursday by a 
Van Nuys Superior Court judge who ruled that the defendant's confession had 
been obtained illegally. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County district attorney's office said charges will be refiled 
because prosecutors believe they have enough evidence against Stephen Rusty 
Lockett, 29, to convict him without the confession. 
</P>
<P>
Lockett was accused of killing Tracy Shay White, 33, whose body was found along 
a road in Griffith Park, wrapped in blankets and sheets, on Sept. 9, 1988. She 
had been killed by a blow to the head with a heavy object about 10 days 
earlier, court documents said. 
</P>
<P>
Lockett had called White's boss and said she would not be at work because she 
was attending a funeral, said Deputy Dist. Atty. James G. Berry. Lockett was 
arrested on Oct. 14 in Las Vegas with White's car and credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
Questioned by Los Angeles police in Las Vegas, Lockett said, "I'd just feel 
more comfortable if I had an attorney," according to police transcripts of the 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
But he waived his right to counsel after being told an attorney was not 
immediately available and that talking to police could help his case, the 
transcript shows. 
</P>
<P>
The transcript also quotes the detectives as emphasizing to Lockett that they 
would in no way harm him or force him to talk if he did not choose to. 
</P>
<P>
Lockett went on to tell detectives that he struck White with a hammer after she 
attacked him with it. He said he wrapped her body in sheets and drove her to 
the park. 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys Superior Court Judge James A. Coleman dismissed the charge because he 
said Lockett clearly had tried to invoke his constitutional right to an 
attorney before he confessed. 
</P>
<P>
Lockett was rearrested Thursday and was returned to jail.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GROUP CALLS FOR MORE MONEY FOR PARKLANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A coalition of 20 national conservation groups Thursday urged Congress to spend 
$35 million to buy land in the Santa Monica Mountains Recreation Area -- more 
than three times what President Bush dedicated to the park in his 1991 budget. 
</P>
<P>
The Wilderness Society said the money was needed to purchase privately owned 
and undeveloped sections of the park that will provide coastal access and link 
several major activity centers. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, it identified 1,303 acres in Corral Canyon as a significant 
ecological area and said acquisition of the 314-acre Whizin tract in Medea 
Valley near Paramount Ranch is "critical to expand public use in the area." 
</P>
<P>
The money would come from the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which is 
maintained by revenue from offshore drilling. The fund is the government's 
primary source of money for purchasing natural and recreational areas. 
</P>
<P>
In his 1991 budget, though, Bush proposed $11.55 million for the park, slightly 
less than last year's high of $12 million. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Los Angeles), a leading advocate of the park, 
called Bush's figure a status quo amount. But rising land prices mean the Park 
Service will need more money, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The truth is we ought to be spending much more for land acquisition than 
either the Bush Administration is proposing or Congress is spending. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We are simply losing potential park properties all over the country," he said, 
adding that he will seek between $20 million and $30 million next year.

COUNCIL RACES ATTRACT MANY CANDIDATES

Concerns over growth drew the largest number of candidate filings for municipal 
office in Palmdale in at least a decade Thursday. Opposition to a proposed dump 
in Elsmere Canyon appeared destined to be a major campaign issue in Santa 
Clarita's City Council election April 10, its first since incorporation. 
</P>
<P>
In the gated community of Hidden Hills, a proposal to build low-cost housing 
for senior citizens is being opposed by at least three of seven people who 
filed for candidacy on Thursday, the deadline to file papers to run in 
municipal elections April 10. 
</P>
<P>
In the city of San Fernando, few divisive issues emerged from campaign 
statements before Thursday's filing deadline, although the newly elected City 
Council this spring is expected to hire a new city administrator to oversee 
day-to-day operations. 
</P>
<P>
* PALMDALE: The continuing rush of development in Palmdale brought out 14 
candidates, the most in at least a decade. Palmdale voters will elect a mayor 
and two of the city's four City Council members in April. 
</P>
<P>
Three incumbents filed for reelection, along with 11 challengers, including 
several well-known homeowner group leaders. But the ballot will not be final 
until the city clerk's office next week verifies that each submitted the 
required petition signatures of at least 20 registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Pete Knight, an ex-Air Force test pilot, is seeking a new two-year term. 
Voters also will decide a ballot measure that would extend the mayor's term to 
four years. 
</P>
<P>
The two mayoral challengers will be Kamal Chalabi, a civil engineering 
professor at Cal State Long Beach who complains development in the city "is 
completely out of hand," and Brian Spencer, an aerospace engineer who was on 
the U.S. Olympic field hockey team in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Nine candidates challenged first-term Councilmen Daniel Becker and Thomas 
Smith. They included James Ledford, a city planning commissioner; Patty Alfred, 
head of the Joshua Hills Homeowners Assn.; James Root, a board member of the 
Palmdale Community Assn.; and Celeste Eckley, president of the Inco 
Neighborhood Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Also running are production planner Neal Emelio, conservator Durwood Bland Jr., 
Suzy Love, Geoffrey Mika and Chris Nejako. 
</P>
<P>
* SANTA CLARITA: Eight challengers and three incumbents declared their 
candidacies in the city's first City Council election since incorporation two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Six candidates filed campaign statements saying they either opposed landfills 
in general or the Elsmere Canyon proposal in particular. 
</P>
<P>
Officially, the Santa Clarita City Council has remained neutral on plans by the 
city and county of Los Angeles to open a dump in Elsmere Canyon, just outside 
the Santa Clarita city limits, by 1995. Council members have said they could 
jeopardize Santa Clarita's legal standing to fight the dump if they officially 
denounced the plan before reviewing the project's environmental impact report, 
which is expected this spring. 
</P>
<P>
In their campaign statements, Councilman Carl Boyer III, 52, and Councilman 
Dennis Koontz, 50, said they do not want landfills in the Santa Clarita Valley. 
Mayor Jo Anne Darcy, 58, a field deputy to Supervisor Mike Antonovich, said she 
opposed landfills that are environmentally unsound. 
</P>
<P>
Also attacking the proposed dump were Kenneth Dean, 50, an interior designer 
who unsuccessfully ran for the council two years ago; Jill Klajic, 42, a 
businesswoman and community advocate; and Andrew (Andy) Martin, 65, a rancher 
and office manager. 
</P>
<P>
Other candidates in Santa Clarita are Linda J. Calvert, 45, an educator and 
realty agent; Wayne Carter, 62, a retired heating fitter; Vera Johnson, 63, a 
retired educator and longtime community activist; John Buckner Smith, 43, a 
college student seeking his teaching credential; and Herbert H. Wolfe, 75, a 
retired Air Force investigator. 
</P>
<P>
* HIDDEN HILLS: Candidates who filed for the City Council election included 
three incumbents and three critics of a plan to annex land and build low-cost 
senior housing in the affluent rural community. 
</P>
<P>
The incumbents -- Mayor Chris K. Van Peski, Councilwoman Colleen Hartman and 
Councilman Warren H. McCament -- last month voted to annex 25 acres on the 
southern border of the western San Fernando Valley community to build 46 units 
of lower-cost senior housing. 
</P>
<P>
Three opponents of the plan -- Howard Klein, Susan Porcaro and David Stanley -- 
also filed papers to run April 10. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey Cohen, a Hidden Hills planning commissioner, also filed. 
</P>
<P>
* SAN FERNANDO: Two incumbents and four challengers filed papers to run for 
three seats at stake in the April 10 City Council election. Because a third 
incumbent, Evelio Franco, chose not to run, the filing deadline for other 
candidates has been extended until Feb. 6, said Wilma Miller, assistant city 
clerk. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Daniel Acuna, a real estate consultant who is completing his first 
four-year term on the council, filed for reelection. The other incumbent 
candidate is Councilman Doude Wysbeek. Wysbeek, who served on the council from 
1982 to 1986 but lost a reelection bid and then was appointed to the council 
last May to replace a member who resigned. 
</P>
<P>
Challenging the incumbents will be Jose Hernandez, a planning commissioner and 
urban studies professor at Cal State Northridge; Linda Jauron, a businesswoman 
and volunteer at the San Fernando YWCA; Gabe Rodriguez, a retired manufacturing 
plant supervisor and long-time San Fernando resident; and Mary Jane Tuomy, a 
planning commissioner who previously served as a parks and recreation 
commissioner.

MALL PROPOSED FOR AREA CITY SEEKS TO CLEAN UP; 
</P>
<P>
REDEVELOPMENT: A RETAIL CENTER IS PLANNED IN SANTA ANA NEAR A STREET THAT 
POLICE ONCE DESCRIBED AS 'THE HEAVIEST TRAVELED FOR NARCOTICS.'

<P>
One of city's most notorious, drug-infested areas may soon become the site of 
an outdoor mall. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council on Monday will consider a proposal for an eight-building 
retail center on Bristol Street near McFadden Avenue, in an area where the city 
plans to launch a separate, $335-million redevelopment project. 
</P>
<P>
The retail mall, proposed by developers Hyun M. Youn and Donald Krotee 
Partnership of Santa Ana, would be on the east side of Bristol between Brook 
and Cubbon streets. 
</P>
<P>
City staff members are recommending that the council approve the center, which 
would be named Bristol Village, as part of the effort to clean up the 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Drug dealers used to speed down Brook and Bristol streets to escape police 
until the city blocked off the junction of the streets with a concrete barrier. 
</P>
<P>
Police described Brook Street as the "heaviest traveled street for narcotics," 
where dealers waited for their customers who bought drugs without getting out 
of their cars. Police resorted to mounted horse patrols on Brook Street in 
1988, after children were reportedly playing with bags of marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
The redevelopment project would be developed in three phases, according to a 
staff report. The first phase would replace three boarded-up houses. The second 
and third phases would require the developers to acquire several properties. 
But those buildings would be razed anyway, because they have numerous building 
code violations, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
"Vacant land typically becomes an enforcement problem, as (it) historically 
(has) resulted in the collection of trash and debris as well as providing 
refuge for undesirables to congregate," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Spix, an attorney at Hermandad Mexicana Nacional Legal Center, said 
Thursday that the mall would remove needed housing from the city. 
</P>
<P>
"The city is going to tell the people who currently live there that they are 
better off living in a mall," Spix said. 
</P>
<P>
Spix is representing two people in a suit filed Tuesday against the city 
seeking to block the 783-acre Bristol Street redevelopment project. The 
plaintiffs are Robert Gonzales, an optometrist who has worked in a Bristol 
Street office for two years, and Evangelina Avalos, a single parent who lives 
on Brook Street with her four children. 
</P>
<P>
Spix said Santa Ana, in its goal to redevelop the city, has "historically 
failed to provide replacement housing" for residents who are displaced, or to 
pay relocation costs. 
</P>
<P>
"Before the City Council adopts a redevelopment project, they should have had a 
plan to help the residents who cannot afford to move," Spix said. "The city is 
taking too much away from the residents." 
</P>
<P>
City officials have said that under state law, Santa Ana must pay the fair 
market price for the homes taken for redevelopment and must pay to relocate 
anyone affected. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Daniel H. Young, who fought for the Bristol Street project, said: "I'm 
quite disappointed in the suit. Richard Spix has had a long record of getting 
in the way of a positive agenda in the city." 
</P>
<P>
Young said he has not yet studied the latest proposal for the smaller Bristol 
Village and has not decided how he will vote. 
</P>
<P>
"The neighborhood is a very sensitive area," he said. "If we allow anything to 
be built on that site, it has to be first-class." 
</P>
<P>
The 28,000-square-foot center would have an additional 100,000 square feet for 
parking. It would consist of single line of buildings, topped by a clock tower. 
</P>
<P>
The city and the developers, who are aware of the crime problems in the area, 
have been working on plans for the center for three years, a spokesman for the 
developers said.

Veteran Supervisor Thomas F. Riley was the top fund-raiser among the three 
Orange County supervisors up for reelection in June, with campaign 
contributions totaling $107,100, according to financial statements filed this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder of Huntington Beach has raised the least of the 
three board members on the campaign trail, reporting $148.40 in contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Newly elected Board Chairman Don R. Roth raised $71,172 during the latest 
reporting period, July 1 to Dec. 31. He has $103,762 in cash on hand, financial 
statements show. 
</P>
<P>
The other two supervisors, Roger R. Stanton and Gaddi H. Vasquez are not up for 
reelection this year. 
</P>
<P>
Among Riley's largest contributors were Barry Brief of the Stein-Brief Group, 
Ranney E. Draper of Diversified Shopping Centers and Laguna Niguel Investors, 
who contributed $1,000 each. During the reporting period, Riley spent $35,061 
on campaign consultants, postage and printed materials. He had $88,071 cash on 
hand, financial statements show. 
</P>
<P>
Roth's largest single contribution of $2,800 came from the political action 
committee of the Assn. of Orange County Deputy Sheriffs, with headquarters in 
Garden Grove. The PAC gave Roth, who is often at odds with Sheriff Brad Gates, 
$4,050 during 1989. Roth had $103,762 in cash on hand. 
</P>
<P>
Along with contributions from major developers, Roth, a former Anaheim city 
councilman, also received campaign money from the Anaheim Police Officers 
Assn.'s PAC, plus $700 from Disneyland, $500 from the Lettuce Amuse U Comedy 
School Inc. and $2,500 from the Los Angeles Fire Fighters Local 1014. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side of the ledger, Roth spent $43,958 during the latest reporting 
period, most of which went for such campaign-related expenses as postage, 
meals, consultants, and to pay the firm running his reelection effort, Campaign 
Management Inc. of Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Wieder's campaign spending has far outpaced her fund raising, according to 
financial statements. Wieder, who is seeking her fourth term, has spent 
$21,752.43 since July. She has relied heavily on loans to cover expenses so 
far, her statements show. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent loan to Wieder's campaign, $9,000, was received in July; it 
could not be determined who made the loan. The required form detailing the loan 
was left out of Wieder's financial statement, and she could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
Wieder has also received two earlier loans totaling $40,000. 
</P>
<P>
Wieder's campaign funds paid for a trip to Europe last fall, where she attended 
a women's forum at a cost of $2,237, according to her financial statement. She 
also attended the prestigious John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard 
University, where the tuition was $5,800.

Among her other large expenditures were $1,200 in attorney fees paid to the 
Washington law firm of Wunder, Ryan, Cannon &amp; Thelan. No details on the 
expense were available. 
</P>
<P>
Gates, who made public his decision to seek reelection a few weeks ago, raised 
$1,000 during the filing period. Gates, who faces no serious opposition in his 
bid for a fifth term, had long been expected to seek reelection. He received a 
total of $127,050 in campaign contributions in 1989, financial statements show. 
</P>
<P>
Gates had received just one contribution since July: $1,000 from George 
Argyros, owner of a Costa Mesa development firm. The two largest expenses 
reported for his campaign during the latest reporting period were $6,876 paid 
to an accounting firm for preparing his campaign expense reports and $2,121 in 
car phone bills.

What Joe Montana is to the Super Bowl, Cynthia Hernando is to a spelling bee -- 
accurate and possessed of steely nerves. And a winner. 
</P>
<P>
She displayed all her talents Thursday night, joining two other students to cop 
top honors at the Eighth Annual Orange County Elementary Spelling Contest. 
Through round after round, word after word, Cynthia ticked off all the right 
letters, even tackling such personal nemeses as peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
"At first I didn't think I was going to do well at all," Cynthia said after the 
contest, hugging her parents, Cecilia and Cesar Hernando. Then, trophy in hand, 
the sixth-grader from Walter Knott Elementary School in Buena Park began to 
cry. 
</P>
<P>
She will be joined by Tara Nathan, a sixth-grader from Vista Verde Elementary 
in Irvine, and Gabriel Knoy, a sixth-grader from Barcelona Hills Elementary in 
Mission Viejo, on a trip to the state spelling finals in Santa Rosa on May 12. 
</P>
<P>
More than 60 students from 20 public school districts in 26 private schools 
participated in the contest, which was coordinated by the Orange County 
Department of Education and sponsored by the the county Board of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
The students, all of them from grades 4 through 6, kicked off the evening by 
taking a ticklish written test of 20 words. 
</P>
<P>
Each child was given a clipboard and pencil, and a prompter read them off: 
daffodil, mammoth, livelihood, cupboard and chocolate. The students then had 15 
seconds to write down their answers. 
</P>
<P>
As the seconds ticked down, the children huddled over their clipboards, pencils 
working furiously, their little brows furrowed in concentration. When time 
expired, a bell was rung and the prompter chimed, "Pencils up!" Scores of tiny 
arms were thrust toward the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, the contestants were herded into a back room for a snack while 
district officials toted up the scores. 
</P>
<P>
Farhana Haque, 9, leaned back in a folding chair, dipped a plastic spoon into a 
cup of vanilla ice cream and pored over a list of the 20 words handed out after 
the written test was concluded and passed in. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't get 'crochet' or 'adequate' right," Farhana noted, hardly ruffled. 
"But it was fun." 
</P>
<P>
Eighteen out of 20 is better than most adults would do, but it wasn't even good 
enough to get Farhana into the final round of 30. Fifteen students got all 20 
words right, while another 15 misspelled only one word. 
</P>
<P>
But it was the final round, an old-fashioned spelling bee with all the tension 
of the seventh game of the World Series, that separated the best and brightest 
of the bunch. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Natividad held a videotape camera to his eye as his daughter, Cherylmae, 
strode to the stage for her turn. Though the Cypress sixth-grader missed a word 
and was eliminated early on, her father was understandably proud of her 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"She loves to engage in mental gymnastics," he said. "She's always been a good 
speller. We spent only about 10 minutes a night. Got out the old dictionary." 
</P>
<P>
The students zipped through words such as bridge, degree and blister. But one 
by one, they began to fall out as toughies such as percolate, eloquence, 
persecute and megalopolis came up. The three finalists rose to the top as an 
unlucky youngster added a "u" to yacht. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Peterson, county schools superintendent, said the program is a great 
impetus for students, a welcome reward for using their brains. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a way to accentuate the academic in a world in which diversions are so 
powerful," Peterson said. "Most children these days watch about five hours of 
TV a day. These students, though, are spending some of that TV time on their 
books. That's what we want to emphasize."

FAIR, BREEZY WEATHER ON TAP THROUGH SATURDAY

Orange County can expect fair, cool and breezy weather to last into the weekend 
in the aftermath of a cold front that swept over the region in the last two 
days, producing showers, strong winds and snow in some areas, forecasters said 
Thursday evening. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks fair through Saturday. But by Sunday, we have a chance of more 
showers," said meteorologist Rick Ditmann of WeatherData Inc., which provides 
forecasts for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Strong winds followed the fast-moving front as it moved rapidly through the 
county early Thursday, causing scattered showers that created only a trace of 
measurable rain before giving way to sunny skies, puffy white clouds and a 
light haze over the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
Sunny weather is expected to continue today, with high temperatures in the 60s 
and gusty north winds to 25 m.p.h. in some areas. Tonight, Ditmann said, 
temperatures may dip into the 30s in some inland areas, and into the 40s and 
50s elsewhere in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, fair skies and highs in the mid-60s and low 70s will change to 
increasing clouds later in the day, with a chance of rain at night. 
</P>
<P>
Scattered showers are expected to begin early Sunday and continue throughout 
the day, with high temperatures reaching the upper 50s and low 60s, Ditmann 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Palm Springs on Thursday was hit with gusts of 45 m.p.h. Burbank and Riverside 
reported sustained winds of 25 m.p.h. Gusts of 50 m.p.h. were recorded in the 
Mojave Desert, and winds reached 60 m.p.h. in the Tehachapis. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California Edison said more than 18,500 customers were without power 
from a few minutes to several hours Thursday because of wind-related problems. 
</P>
<P>
About 2,500 Southern California Edison customers in Laguna Beach were without 
power for 45 minutes Thursday night after strong winds caused some tree 
branches to become entangled in power lines, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Sullivan, a spokesman for the power company, said the outage began around 
7 p.m. Power shut down automatically to an area along Coast Highway from 
Broadway down the coast to Mountain Road as the branches became entangled in 
the power lines. He said power was restored to all but 20 customers by 7:45 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Rain-hungry weather watchers got very little to cheer about from the recent 
front. 
</P>
<P>
There was no measurable rain at the Los Angeles Civic Center and only traces in 
Orange County. The National Weather Service said that on the first day of 
February -- normally considered to be the middle of the rainy season -- only 
2.31 inches of rain had been recorded at the Los Angeles Civic Center, nearly 6 
inches below the 8.23 inches that is normal by Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
According to David Cooper of the National Weather Service, coastal and mountain 
areas of Southern California average four to 10 rainy days in February. He said 
desert regions average about two or three rainy days, and two to three feet of 
snow usually fall in the higher mountains.

Frenchman Bob Wollek won the pole for this weekend's Daytona 24-hour endurance 
race in a Porsche 962 after Oscar Larrauri started a record-breaking qualifying 
session by topping the track mark, then crashing in another of the Porsche 
prototypes. 
</P>
<P>
Larrauri, from Italy, escaped injury when he apparently blew a right-rear tire 
as he passed another car coming off the fourth turn of the banked portion of 
the 3.56-mile road circuit at Daytona International Speedway. The car spun, 
became airborne and skidded down the track on its roof. 
</P>
<P>
Wollek, whose co-drivers are South African Sarel van der Merwe and American 
Dominic Dobson, posted the pole-winning speed, 131 m.p.h., on his final lap.

After El Toro and Mission Viejo high schools battled to a 1-1 tie Thursday, El 
Toro Coach Bob Chavez realized that poetry and girls' soccer don't mix. 
</P>
<P>
"It's funny, the kids told me to read this to them before a big game," Chavez 
said, holding a crumpled up piece of paper with the words "JUST DO IT." 
</P>
<P>
"I guess they thought I was just reading poetry." 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo (14-4-2, 4-2-2 in league play) dominated South Coast League rival 
El Toro (15-3-2, 5-1-2) early, but didn't score until Nikki Charette's goal 
with 10 minutes remaining in the half. The goal came after goalie Allegra 
Garcia twice had denied Mission Viejo with diving saves. 
</P>
<P>
"We were lucky it wasn't 3-0 before halftime," Chavez said. 
</P>
<P>
During the break, Chavez discarded the "poetry" and screamed at his players 
with his own inspirational message. 
</P>
<P>
"In the the second half we were ready to play," Chavez said, "We started moving 
the ball better, but we're in a scoring slump right now." 
</P>
<P>
Chavez credited Mission Viejo's defense for his team's lack of offense. 
</P>
<P>
Shawn Viloria's goal gave El Toro its second tie with Mission Viejo this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I like games like this," Mission Viejo Coach Jim Dutton said, "Both teams 
never quit, and any time we play El Toro, it's a war." MICHAEL ITAGAKI In 
another South Coast League match: Dana Hills 5, San Clemente 0 -- Gina Pitale, 
Stacey Juhl, Jennifer Koenig, Kristin Bye and Shelby McKay scored for visiting 
Dana Hills (17-3-1, 6-2). In Century League girls' soccer: Foothill 3, Villa 
Park 1 -- Amy Hardy scored twice and Julie Ehret scored another goal for

ANDERSON MATURES INTO PERFORMER OF NOTE; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE BASKETBALL: OCCIDENTAL'S 6-FOOT-10 CENTER WAS A SELF-DESCRIBED 'STIFF' 
WHEN HE PLAYED AT LOS ALAMITOS HIGH SCHOOL.

<P>
As long as a tuba was wrapped around him, Chris Anderson always felt at home on 
center stage. 
</P>
<P>
He could not lift the instrument when he began playing it in the fifth grade -- 
"Why couldn't he have chosen the piccolo?" asked his mother, Lynn -- but by the 
time he had reached junior high, Anderson was an award-winning soloist for a 
jazz ensemble that played a festival circuit throughout the western United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a swimmer when I was a kid, so my lungs were really big and I could get 
some good sound through that sucker," Anderson said. "I was always the biggest 
guy in school, so I wanted to learn the biggest instruments. First I learned 
the string bass, then the tuba. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything was just enormous." 
</P>
<P>
As the years passed, Anderson and his sousaphone became more proportionate. 
Today, at 6-foot-10, 210 pounds, he still plays, but he now dwarfs the 
instrument. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, a senior, also stands tall above opponents as the starting center for 
the Occidental College basketball team. A self-described "stiff" when he played 
at Los Alamitos High School, Anderson has developed into one of the top 
Division III post players in the West. 
</P>
<P>
Once timid under the basket, Anderson now is a powerful force on offense and an 
enforcer on defense. 
</P>
<P>
"You can take most players as freshmen, work with them for four years and at 
the end say, 'This guy is a good Division III player,' " La Verne Coach Gary 
Stewart said. "With Chris, you go through that and you say he is not a Division 
III player. He can play at a higher level." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson believes so too, and to that end he will pursue a professional 
basketball career in Europe or Australia after he graduates from Occidental in 
June with a degree in exercise science. 
</P>
<P>
But before taking his turn-around jump shot overseas, Anderson will attempt to 
help the Tigers (6-12 overall, 2-4 in the Southern California Intercollegiate 
Athletic Conference) turn around their season. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson has been Occidental's most consistent performer. He is averaging 18.4 
points and 9.2 rebounds -- fourth and third, respectively, in the SCIAC -- and 
leads conference players with 46 blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a difference between someone who stands tall and someone who plays 
tall," Claremont Coach David Wells said. "Chris has improved immensely. He's as 
fine a defensive post player (as) our league has seen in a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson also is among the tallest. SCIAC centers usually measure in at 6-5 or 
6-6. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's anybody in our league that can stop me one-on-one," 
Anderson says. "(At the Division III level), I'm not used to playing against 
people my size that have any kind of athletic ability." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson was the one lacking in talent when he arrived in Eagle Rock in 1986 
after a mostly forgettable high school career. 
</P>
<P>
As a freshman at Huntington Beach High, the only uniform he wore was that of 
the marching band. Music provided the impetus for a transfer to Los Alamitos, 
where band director and longtime friend Chuck Wackerman had taken a job. 
</P>
<P>
By then, Anderson was 6-5 and ready to trade his spats for a pair of high-tops. 
He participated in the jazz band and went out late for basketball, but he did 
not play much for the sophomore team. He made the varsity as a junior but did 
not start. As a 6-8 senior, he still wasn't good enough to make the starting 
five, but he averaged four points and four rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, he received several "business reply" recruiting letters from small 
schools, including Occidental. 
</P>
<P>
"They were looking for a smart tall guy," Anderson said. "They didn't care 
whether you could walk or not." 
</P>
<P>
Most people who saw him early in his freshman season weren't sure Anderson 
could do that much without falling. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember seeing him and saying, 'Boy, they've got their work cut out with 
this guy,' " Pomona Coach Charlie Katsiaficas said. "He really hadn't caught up 
with his body. He was very, very raw." 
</P>
<P>
And very, very scared. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no mental clue on what to do with the basketball and what to do if 
people wanted me to score," Anderson recalled. "I was the biggest basket case." 
</P>
<P>
As noted, however, big goes a long way in a small-college conference such as 
the SCIAC. 
</P>
<P>
Playing for the junior varsity as a freshman, Anderson progressed under the 
tutelage of assistant Cleve Buckner, who played for the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
"He'd fall or get knocked down on the floor and stop playing for a while 
because he was waiting for a call," Buckner said. "At the end of his first 
year, he started picking himself up off the floor." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson averaged 12.1 points and 6.5 rebounds as a sophomore on the varsity 
and came into his own last season when he shot 60% from the field. His averages 
of 18.2 points and 8.8 rebounds a game ranked fifth and second, respectively, 
in the SCIAC, and he led the conference in blocked shots with 2.9 a game. He 
was a first-team all-conference selection. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson is confident that his size and skills will translate well at whichever 
outpost he lands after graduation. 
</P>
<P>
Several former Occidental players have played overseas, including Coach Brian 
Newhall, who played in France for two years after graduating in 1982, and John 
Keister, who is now playing in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Buckner believes that Anderson's best days as a basketball player are ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"Chris is going to make leaps and bounds after this year," Buckner said. "The 
other people developed (as players) as much as they were going to when they 
finished here. He has a chance to go farther than anyone else."

A state appellate court has ruled that persons implanted with certain heart 
valves made by Shiley Inc. -- a type with a history of life-threatening 
failures -- may sue the manufacturer for fraud even though their valves have 
not malfunctioned. 
</P>
<P>
The 4th District Court of Appeal on Wednesday reversed the opinion of an Orange 
County Superior Court judge that Judy Khan of Roanoke, Va., had filed her 
grievances prematurely because the heart valve which she received in 1983 has 
not malfunctioned. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Finzen, Khan's attorney, said the California appellate court was the 
first court in the country to allow persons with functioning Bjork Shiley 
Convexo-Concave valves to litigate against the Irvine-based manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
In a 17-page decision, the appellate court permits Khan to go to trial with her 
lawsuit against Shiley and its corporate parent, Pfizer Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Shiley contended in a statement Thursday that it had "scored a major legal 
victory" in the appellate decision. The company said the court ruled out seven 
of eight causes of action, including the ability of the plaintiff to sue on 
grounds of product liability, while only allowing the allegation of fraud to be 
litigated. 
</P>
<P>
The company denied that it had acted fraudulently. "Shiley firmly believes 
there is no basis to this claim and that after further litigation proceedings . 
. . the plaintiff will be unable to recover on such a claim," it said. 
</P>
<P>
Shiley said it had not decided whether to appeal the decision. 
</P>
<P>
Khan's civil suit seeks an unspecified award for damages from emotional 
distress. It alleges that Shiley and Pfizer concealed problems with valves, of 
the kind implanted in Khan's heart, before deciding to completely recall the 
valves in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The appellate court said it was confirming that a "manufacturer of a product 
may be liable for fraud when it conceals material product information from 
potential users. This is true whether the product is a mechanical heart valve 
or frozen yogurt." 
</P>
<P>
Finzen said his law firm, Robins, Kaplan, Miller &amp; Ciresi, currently 
represents 140 other people who, like Khan, still have the valve implanted and 
have filed suit in California. 
</P>
<P>
From 1979 to 1986 more than 85,000 Bjork Shiley Convexo-Concave heart valves 
were sold worldwide, about half in the United States. According to the U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration, there have been 389 reported breakages of the 
60-degree and 70-degree valves, in which at least 246 people have died. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of the Public Citizens Health Research Group, which 
has acted as a resource for those suing Shiley, said wrongful-death lawsuits 
brought by relatives of the deceased have resulted in some out-of-court 
settlements, in several cases exceeding $1 million. So far none have been 
litigated, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Wolfe predicted that the California decision could persuade more people living 
with valves to file lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
"It opens the door for massive amounts of litigation which should be brought by 
all these people who are walking around terrorized in many instances," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Finzen, however, said he believes the number of pre-fracture lawsuits will be 
limited because many people who have Shiley valves implanted do not know they 
may have a problem. "The company never notified any of the patients directly," 
he said. Only surgeons and, in some cases, cardiologists were informed of the 
potential danger, he said.

HomeFed Corp. The San Diego-based parent of HomeFed Bank reported 
fourth-quarter net income of $33.1 million, up from a profit of $32.2 million 
for the same three months the previous year. For the fiscal year ended Dec. 31, 
HomeFed's profit was $115.7 million, up from $111.3 million for fiscal 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Gains from real estate operations were of significant help to both the fourth 
quarter and fiscal 1989 results. For the quarter, real estate gains were $23.8 
million, up from $14.4 million for the previous year. Fiscal year real estate 
gains were $80.2 million, up from $44.1 million for 1988. The gains were needed 
to offset substantial increases in loan-loss reserves. HomeFed's bad loan 
reserves, which were announced previously, totaled $108 million at the end of 
the recent quarter, up from $18 million after fourth quarter 1988. For all of 
1989, loan-loss reserves totaled $147 million, up from $48 million in 1988. The 
loan-loss reserves helped reduce HomeFed's nonperforming loans to 1.81% of its 
$17.8 billion in total assets on Dec. 31, down from 2.85% of assets as of Sept. 
30.

Each year the State Board of Equalization reassesses the total value of 
property in the state to reflect new construction, escalating prices and 
resource development. Growth in assessed value for the seven Southland counties 
during the 1989-90 fiscal year was among the highest in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Assessed values in booming Riverside County rose 16.2%, ranking it No. 2, 
behind Inyo County, where development of geothermal wells has boosted land 
values 28.5%. The other six Southland counties posted growth rates in the top 
12 of the state's 58 counties. Twenty-one counties grew at rates of more than 
10%, 23 increased between 5.0% and 9.9%, and 14 had increases below 5.0%. Only 
one county, Modoc, suffered a decline in valuation, falling 0.8%.

Brea Plant to Close: NI Industries will close its wheel-manufacturing plant in 
Brea at the end of March, resulting in the dismissal of 31 salaried employees 
and 131 hourly workers. 
</P>
<P>
The 365,000-square-foot factory, in operation since 1977, builds steel wheels 
primarily for General Motors cars. An NI spokesman said the company had lost 
its crucial GM contract because of the car company's decision to build more of 
its own wheels, and because the distance to GM assembly plants in the East 
resulted in high transportation costs for the NI products. NI Industries, a 
Long Beach-based subsidiary of Masco Industries, will sell the Brea facility, 
the spokesman said.

PACKAGED TO SAVE THE PLANET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sebastian International did more than sing the praises of its latest cuts and 
colors early this week at the Hairdressers' Guild show in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Executives of the Woodland Hills hair-care and cosmetics company put employees 
in issue-oriented T-shirts ("Protect the Planet, Protect the Species"), 
introduced biodegradable packaging and sealed its commitment to the Rainforest 
Foundation with a $50,000 check and a promise of $200,000 more by the end of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
While Sebastian's environmental statement was the most ambitious and 
elaborately staged, it wasn't the only one issued during the two-day trade 
show. 
</P>
<P>
Aveda Corp., Minneapolis-based makers of beauty products from flower and plant 
essences, announced (on recycled paper) that it was a member of the Coalition 
for Environmentally Responsible Economies and a sponsor of Earth Day 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Stefano, president of Joico, a Los-Angeles company specializing in 
products for damaged hair, reiterated his commitment "to a cleaner, more 
healthful environment" and let it be known that his firm had eliminated all 
aerosol cans -- at a cost of $60,000 and a potentially significant revenue loss 
-- because of dissatisfied customers. 
</P>
<P>
After a demonstration of 1990 hair trends Sunday night at the New Otani Hotel, 
Stefano urged his 180 international distributors "to recycle everything you 
can" and presented a fashion show of clothing made from newspapers by Canadian 
designer Liza Deyrmenjian. 
</P>
<P>
Sebastian's mainstream approach to statement clothing -- two Protect the Planet 
T-shirts -- will be sold in affiliated salons across the country. A portion of 
each sale goes to the Rainforest Foundation, and a similar program applies to 
select Sebastian products in brown paper bags printed with such information as: 
"Tropical deforestation is comparable to nuclear war. . . . The continued 
destruction of the rain forests . . . at a rate of 60 acres per minute will 
lead to flooding, erosion . . . and . . . climate changes world-wide. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Along with its Rainforest Foundation program, which includes videos, posters 
and brochures, Sebastian is making packaging and formula changes that will turn 
everything the company sells "earth friendly," according to company president 
John Sebastian. 
</P>
<P>
Introducing biodegradable bottles, made from cornstarch and high-density 
polypropylene, Sebastian said they were chosen as "the first step forward to 
something positive," despite controversy. (The environmentally involved, 
including a spokesperson for the California Integrated Waste Management Board, 
have expressed doubts that anything, including cornstarch and polypropylene 
packaging, can degrade in most landfill conditions.) 
</P>
<P>
In addition, two of the company's most popular products, Hi-Energy Hold and 
Hair Gloss, will no longer be manufactured because their formulas couldn't be 
made "environmentally friendly." 
</P>
<P>
"The key to the future is being able to form a healthy alliance with a company 
like Sebastian" said Jean-Pierre Dutilleux, founder of the Rain Forest 
Foundation, noting this was the first alliance between his organization and an 
American firm. "I hope this could be the start of a grass-roots movement."

LITTLE PASSION FOR GAY SOAP AT PREVIEW PARTY; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISON: THE ORANGE COUNTY-PRODUCED SHOW WENT OVER LIKE BEEFCAKES AT A 
CONVENTION OF VEGETARIANS.

COSTA MESA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lying bare-chested beneath the sheets, Neal and Stan disentangle after spending 
a night together. 
</P>
<P>
"Neal, I know you've heard of foreplay," Stan says. "Have you ever heard of 
afterplay? A hug, a kiss, anything! Breathe on me!" 
</P>
<P>
Neal tenderly pulls Stan's unshaven face close to his own -- then exhales 
harshly. "Satisfied?" he smirks. 
</P>
<P>
Stan turns away. He is wounded, rejected. . . . 
</P>
<P>
You've read about it in TV Guide and USA Today, you've seen provocative 
excerpts on local TV news, you've heard about it on the radio. And now, 
finally, "Secret Passions," the gay-oriented soap opera being produced in 
Orange County, has had its local debut -- Wednesday in a Costa Mesa nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
About 300 people, mostly men, crowded Newport Station for a spirited premiere 
party and watched Neal and Stan and the rest of the show's cast of characters, 
mostly gay, on a large-screen TV. 
</P>
<P>
The show went over like beefcakes at a convention of vegetarians. 
</P>
<P>
The one-hour soap, made on a shoestring budget for public-access cable TV and 
believed to be the first of its kind in the country, had its cable debut 
Tuesday at 11 p.m. on a gay network in New York City. About 15 people, out of a 
potential 800,000, called to say "they liked it," though some complained of 
boredom, according to Butch Peaston, the network official who aired it. 
</P>
<P>
David Gadberry, who produces, writes and acts (as Stan) in the soap, said he 
intends to send the pilot Mondayto nine Orange County public-access cable 
stations, and to others in at least 15 U.S. cities. Public-access operators are 
generally legally bound to broadcast any non-commercial program for which they 
have air time. 
</P>
<P>
The national media blitz caught fire weeks before a single episode was even 
complete. Wednesday night, as he has told scores of reporters already, Gadberry 
again said he made the show to counter negative media stereotypes about gays. 
</P>
<P>
It realistically depicts the gay life style, said Gadberry, 29, who has 
produced live theater but not TV before. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm tired of being portrayed in the media as someone made to suffer, as a 
victim, as a pervert," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But just a few of the soiree's party-goers seemed to be caught up by life in 
the fictional Orange County town of Orange Grove, where dirty politics, big 
business, domestic strife and romance reign. They wanted to know more about 
Chaz Cavanaugh, a gay counterpart to "Dallas' " sleazy J.R. Ewing; June 
Tshwaila, a smarmy black lesbian running for City Council, and an anti-gay 
fanatic, the Rev. Arthur Dimsdale. 
</P>
<P>
Others supported the project in concept. Jeff LeTourneau, co-chairman of the 
Orange County Visibility League, said the program "could break down more 
barriers" by exposing gay behavior to unenlightened heterosexuals 
</P>
<P>
"I see that as a positive step forward for the gay community," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But most said they thought the "Secret Passions" pilot -- which shows men 
kissing, as promised -- is not true to life. Its characters and situations are 
"extreme," "overly dramatic" and "far-fetched," like those in other soap 
operas, viewers said. 
</P>
<P>
Plus, many said, it was just plain boring. Several left before the show was 
over or mumbled restlessly throughout its second half. 
</P>
<P>
"It is awful, awful," said Mike, 24, of Orange, who would not give his last 
name. "That's not the way I live my life. It's corny and misrepresentative. 
Every relationship (in the show) has a problem. Why don't they show the 
positive side of things?" 
</P>
<P>
Randy, 22, who also declined to be further identified, said: "It doesn't 
present an accurate, well-rounded picture." 
</P>
<P>
Cast member David Burrill put it this way: "I think they should have spent more 
time in production than hyping it up to the media." 
</P>
<P>
Even Gadberry, while quick to defend the project, conceded that the show is 
decidedly "slow." 
</P>
<P>
"Oh yeah," he said, "to be honest with you. But it was great as a first effort 
working with volunteers." 
</P>
<P>
And, he said, he can "guarantee" that the next episode will be improved. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, national media coverage of "Secret Passions" continues. A producer 
for MTV, the 24-hour music video network, said he would be showing clips from 
the soap Thursday night at 11:30. Gadberry and the Rev. Louis P. Sheldon of 
Anaheim, an anti-gay evangelist, are scheduled to face off this morning on 
"Nine Broadcast Plaza," a nationally broadcast news magazine carried (at 7 
a.m.) by some local cable companies on WWOR out of New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
And Gadberry continued to say Hollywood executives assure him that they will 
help market the soap to such commercial cable outlets as the USA Network. He 
would not name these individuals (who, he said, fear reprisal for supporting 
homosexuality), nor would he say whether any commitments have been made. 
</P>
<P>
But even without their support, he insisted, he will keep producing the soap 
for biweekly broadcast on public-access TV. 
</P>
<P>
It took about two months to finish the pilot, but future episodes can follow 
quickly now that cast and crew are in place, he said. He is now editing a 
second segment and taping a third. 
</P>
<P>
"To hell with the entertainment industry!" he told Wednesday's crowd. "We're 
going to do it on our own!"

ARTS PATRONS MAY SAMPLE 3 MUSICAL FIRSTS; 
</P>
<P>
ENTERTAINMENT: A ROBERT CUMMINGS OBOE CONCERTO AND ZELMAN BOKSER'S 'POINTS OF 
LIGHT' ORCHESTRAL WORK WILL BE PREMIERED. ALSO DUE: A TANDEM PERFORMANCE BY 
SHAKESPEAREAN ACTORS AND THE GARDEN GROVE SYMPHONY.

<P>
This will be a weekend of musical firsts in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Micah Levy and the Orange County Chamber Orchestra will give the first 
performances of local composer Robert Cummings' Concerto for Oboe and Strings 
on Sunday at St. Joseph Center in Orange and Monday at South Coast Repertory in 
Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
UC Irvine faculty member Zelman Bokser will conduct the UC Irvine Symphony in 
the premiere of his orchestral work "Points of Light" tonight and Saturday at 
UCI's Fine Arts Village Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
And the Garden Grove Symphony and members of the Grove Shakespeare Festival 
will team up for the first time to offer a program of Shakespearean drama and 
music Saturday at the Don Wash Auditorium in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Cummings said he got the idea to write a concerto for oboe while 
listening to the radio as he was driving along in his car in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard the Corigliano Oboe Concerto and was rather drawn to it," he said on 
the phone from his home in Garden Grove. "I thought it would be a nice thing to 
write. There are not that many in the literature . . . so I proceeded to write 
one in the next three months." 
</P>
<P>
An organist and music director of Holy Family Cathedral in Orange for almost 25 
years, Cummings, 50, has been composing since he was 14. His Third Symphony, he 
said, won a Hollywood Bowl Award in 1956, but "nothing ever came of it." 
</P>
<P>
"It is discouraging, but it's very hard for a composer to be an advocate of 
himself," he observed. 
</P>
<P>
Cummings said he underwent an "artistic crisis" in 1970 after "10 years of 
experimentation in avant-garde material. I, like all artists, started in a 
tonal style and, through the education process at various schools, was forced 
to write in a rather different style. I looked back on (his work) and asked, is 
this what I really want to do? So about 1981, I went back to a semi-tonal 
style, post-Britten, post-Tippett. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"That is the dilemma of the modern artist -- what in the world style does one 
write in?" 
</P>
<P>
He calls his Oboe Concerto "unabashedly tonal," so much so that "I'm sure there 
are going to be people thinking, 'What's this guy doing in the 20th Century?' " 
</P>
<P>
"But it's definitely a 20th-Century work. The harmony is 20th Century. But the 
structure is very classical. The first movement is sonata allegro, the second 
is rather an interlude and the third is a sonata rondo. 
</P>
<P>
"Lots of composers are coming back to tonality," he continued. "In my music 
from this point on, I will try to meet the audience at least half-way. If 
that's a sell-out, I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 Micah Levy will conduct the premiere of Robert Cummings' Concerto for Oboe and 
Strings with soloist Allan Vogel Sunday at 4 p.m. at St. Joseph Center, Loyola 
Marymount University, 480 S. Batavia St. in Orange; and Monday at 8 p.m. at 
South Coast Repertory, 655 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. Levy also will 
conduct Haydn's Symphony No. 82 and William Boyce's Overture No. 4. Tickets: 
$14-$17. Information: (714) 538-8391. 
</P>
<P>
Zelman Bokser swears that his new "Points of Light" has "nothing to do with 
George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in Europe when the campaign was going on and for some reason managed not 
to have heard about that phrase," Bokser said in a recent phone interview. 
</P>
<P>
"I had planned this piece knowing I'd be doing Brahms' Piano Concerto No. 1, a 
very dark, heavy kind of work, on the same concert. So my original idea was to 
write something considerably more ethereal, in texture anyway." 
</P>
<P>
The composer said the work lasts about 11 minutes and is written for a "large 
orchestra, used sparingly." 
</P>
<P>
"There are particular sets of pitches I use in the work that motivate 
everything that happens," he said. "That's true of virtually everything I 
write. In this particular work, I'm using a set of whole-tone pitches. It's not 
modal, it's not tonal, it's not 12-tone, but what could be seen as whole-tone 
scale groupings. String chords are spaced in such a way that there are large 
spaces between each of the voices. That gives kind of an airy sound." 
</P>
<P>
 Zelman Bokser will conduct the UC Irvine Symphony in "Points of Light" today 
and Saturday at 8 p.m. UC Irvine's Fine Arts Village Theatre. Also on the 
program: Brahms' Piano Concerto No. 1 (soloist: Lincoln Mayorga) and 
Mendelssohn's "Italian Symphony." Tickets: $7, general admission; $6 for 
seniors and students. Information: (714) 856-6616 or 856-5000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Those listening to the Garden Grove Symphony on Saturday will get a bit of 
Shakespearean drama as well, as Laura Mitchell and Wayne Watkins of the Grove 
Shakespeare Festival act in selections from "A Midsummer Night's Dream," 
"Othello," "Henry V" and "Romeo and Juliet." 
</P>
<P>
"The idea was to coordinate the efforts of the symphony and the Shakespeare 
Festival, which are both major events in the city," said Thomas Bradac, the 
festival's producing artistic director. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a great body of music that has been written about Shakespeare's 
works. (Originally, we thought) they could present one of these concerts that 
would wrap around the body of the works." The idea evolved, Bradac said, into 
"several small vignettes from the plays that are being used as transition and 
dovetailing into the concert. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not putting on a performance underscored by the symphony," he stressed. 
"We are trying to give people a flavor of cross-disciplines. 
</P>
<P>
"The two organizations are working much more cooperatively than we have in the 
past," Bradac added. "There is a limited amount of dollars available for 
everybody. But both organizations serve the community and we can work 
cooperatively to maximize our efforts. We're both in the same ball park. If 
this succeeds, I imagine in the future we may try some more experiments." 
</P>
<P>
 Edward Peterson will conduct the Garden Grove Symphony in a "Sounds of 
Shakespeare" program Saturday at 8 p.m. at the Don Wash Auditorium, 11271 
Stanford Ave., in Garden Grove. Music by Tchaikovsky, Mendelssohn, Walton and 
others will be played. Laura Mitchell and Wayne Watkins of the Grove 
Shakespeare Festival will present selected scenes from Shakespeare's plays. 
Tickets: $10-$25. Information: (714) 534-1103.

SURF ROSE BUT NOT THE SURFERS; 
</P>
<P>
UCI TEAM GETTING ITS ACT TOGETHER FOR S.D. COMPETITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MORELL, John Morell is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eric Kobrine wakes to the surf every morning. His house in Newport Beach is one 
of those beach homes north of the pier with beautiful views and sand in the 
carpets. 
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday he got up early, put on shorts and a T-shirt, stood in the sand 
beyond his patio near a blue vinyl tarp and waited. He was getting ready for a 
big day. 
</P>
<P>
As president of UC Irvine's surf team and surf club, he and the other members 
would choose the six-person squad that would compete in this weekend's National 
Scholastic Surfing Assn. (NSSA) meet in Torrey Pines. 
</P>
<P>
Response by the surfers at UCI had been enthusiastic. Kobrine was expecting 15 
to 20 people, all of whom would be rushing through the surf, competing against 
each other for one of the six spots. 
</P>
<P>
It was scheduled to start at 8. Mother Nature was helping out with waves, "kind 
of small, but good," Kobrine said. 
</P>
<P>
His arms folded, Kobrine surveyed the quiet beach with a serious stare. A 
junior with a major in math and economics, he calculated the scene. "Things 
will get going soon," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Already in the water were two team members, Chris Cullen and Arek Avedian, 
getting in some practice. Dogs on their morning walks barked and jostled with 
each other as their owners shielded their eyes from the sun and glanced over at 
the guys in black wet suits who wrestled with their boards and the waves. 
</P>
<P>
It was getting late, 8:40. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, must have been some outrageous parties last night," joked Kobrine, 
explaining the absence of surfers who had promised to compete. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, a couple of guys, Dave Park and George Bonne, dove into the ocean, 
looking to make the team. Then a club member who photographs the guys in action 
dropped by to watch. 
</P>
<P>
That was it. 
</P>
<P>
So much for the heated competition, the pressured battles to be the best. 
</P>
<P>
The trials, as originally planned, were canceled, and the event became just 
another surfing session in Kobrine's front yard. 
</P>
<P>
Park, a junior with a major in electrical engineering, and Bonne, a freshman, 
both made it; Park as a team member and Bonne as an alternate. 
</P>
<P>
No one who showed up was disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
Cullen, the Anteaters star surfer, came back to the sand for a breather. As 
Kobrine slipped into the house to change into his wet suit and pull out his 
short, polyurethane board (he's the team's expert body surfer), Cullen looked 
around the empty beach and shrugged. "We probably should've called some of 
these guys last night, but we didn't." 
</P>
<P>
Although they didn't get the turnout they expected, the UCI five were confident 
they could fill out their team. "Some of the guys are in fraternities, and I 
guess there were some big parties," said Cullen as he zipped his suit back up 
for another go at the waves, his car key conveniently tied to the zipper ring. 
This week, all the final plans had to be made. 
</P>
<P>
Ideally, they will take six surfers, including one female surfer (they'll get 
more points during the competition if they have one) and two alternates down to 
Torrey Pines. 
</P>
<P>
The NSSA attracts schools up and down the coast, and UCI, with its handful of 
surfers, hasn't had much of a chance against some of the bigger surf schools, 
such as San Diego State, Cal State Long Beach, UCLA and Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
"You usually can't tell the surfers from the non-surfers at school," Cullen 
said. "Surf clothing is really popular and everyone wears it. Then there are 
guys like Arek. He showed up at one of our meetings in glasses and a UCI sweat 
shirt and didn't look at all like he could surf, but he's pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
The team's small size makes it more the way people say college athletics should 
be. The team members of major sports get flown or bused to their competitions, 
but the Anteater surfing team will be "driving in two or three cars," Kobrine 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, it's not like a football team," Cullen said. "Maybe one guy doesn't 
want to ride down with another because he doesn't want to listen to his tapes. 
Surfers just like to do their own thing." 
</P>
<P>
Should the team make it to the finals on Sunday, the members will need a place 
for the night. While UCI's basketball squad would have a hotel ready for it, 
arranged by one of its managers, the surfing team's captain has some brochures 
from the NSSA that list a few motels willing to cut a deal. Cullen and Avedian 
could stay with some friends. 
</P>
<P>
Other sports get cheerleaders sent down with them to get the school spirit 
flowing. Not having them attend is OK with this team. "We get beach bunnies 
though," Cullen joked. "They make up for it." 
</P>
<P>
The word going around the small group was that despite their efforts of 
plastering the school with posters, the low turnout was due to money. While the 
team received a $500 grant from the UCI athletic department, it still has come 
up short for the contest. 
</P>
<P>
In order to enter all three NSSA events this year, team members will have to 
ante up $55 each, which can be an awesome sum when you're going to school and 
working part time. The team has sponsors -- Ape Gloves, Instinct Sportswear, 
Pacific Surf &amp; Sport -- who supply products, but freebies don't translate 
into entrance fees. 
</P>
<P>
Torrey Pines, near San Diego, is known as prime surfing beach. It faces some 
strong waves that have been carried across the Pacific. Cullen, a veteran of 
several individual surfing competitions, can recite the criteria by which his 
performance will be judged by heart. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to ride the biggest waves the longest distance with the most radical 
moves in the most stylish manner closest to the curl as possible," he said. A 
senior psychology major, he has told the others what the judges look for and, 
while he pulls for the team, he realizes that, once again, surfing isn't 
football. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very individual. You're out there alone on your board against the waves, 
but it's still a team effort, you're pulling for your teammates to do well 
too." 
</P>
<P>
They will all be pulling for each other Saturday, provided they are able to 
catch the other team members on campus and let them know when to be there, get 
a female surfer and reach Dave Park, since no one seemed to have his phone 
number after he went home. 
</P>
<P>
Hey, Dave, if you're reading this: They need you for the team. Call Eric. And 
hang loose.

Aerojet General and NASA's space shuttle program, announced a new non-toxic way 
to clean high-purity industrial piping systems used in the pharmaceutical, 
biotechnology, aerospace and food/beverage industries. The material is based, 
in part, on the citric acid found in oranges and lemons. It is designed to 
replace such highly toxic fluids as nitric and hydrofluoric acids, which are 
currently in use.

O.C. HOUSING AFFORDABILITY UNCHANGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite a slight improvement statewide in housing affordability during 
December, it remained unchanged in Orange County, where only about one in seven 
households could qualify for a conventional loan on a median-priced resale 
home. 
</P>
<P>
That 15% rate for the county compares to a 48% national rate and a 21% 
statewide rate, the California Assn. of Realtors said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Even though per-capita and household incomes in Orange County are among the 
highest in the country, the even higher housing costs here meant that the 
county's monthly housing affordability rate ranged between 13% and 16% 
throughout 1989 -- consistently one of the lowest in the nation, the 
association said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, when housing prices in the county were considerably lower -- although 
still among the country's highest -- the affordability rate averaged 20%. 
</P>
<P>
For December, a prospective home buyer in Orange County needed a minimum annual 
household income of $81,034 to qualify to make the $2,026 monthly payment on a 
mortgage loan for the median-priced resale home, which sold for $248,664. 
</P>
<P>
That was nearly 32% more than the $61,420 annual income needed to qualify for a 
home with the statewide median price of $188,477. 
</P>
<P>
And the minimum Orange County income was more than 2 1/2 times the $30,144 
necessary to get a conventional loan on a home with the national median price 
of $92,500. 
</P>
<P>
In arriving at its affordability figures, the association calculates a 20% down 
payment and includes insurance and property taxes in the monthly payment. The 
survey does not include attached housing, which is generally less expensive -- 
and thus more affordable. 
</P>
<P>
AFFORDABILITY INDEX FOR EXISTING HOMES 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen percent of Orange County households could afford to buy the 
median-priced resale home in the county in December, unchanged from 15% in 
November but down from 17% in December, 1988.

Median housing costs, heading upward since 1985, appear to have leveled off. 
The current median home mortgage, $740, is virtually unchanged since 1988. 
Between 1985 and 1988, that figure rose every year, albeit in decreasing 
increments, by a total of $196, or 36%. 
</P>
<P>
County renters, too, have seen their costs stop increasing. The current $680 
median is unchanged from 1988. Since 1985, the median rent payment increased 
$102, or 18%. 
</P>
<P>
These median monthly payments may not be rising now, but 
</P>
<P>
housing is still a big-ticket item in county budgets. Half of all homeowners 
pay more than $750 per month for their mortgages. Among renters, 38% owe more 
than $750. Then there is that fortunate group of homeowners whose mortgages are 
paid: 13% report paying nothing each month, including 32% of those 55 years and 
older. 
</P>
<P>
Two major determinants of housing payments are length of time at a residence 
and, as real estate agents are fond of saying, location. The southern portion 
of the county remains the mostexpensive for both owning and renting. For both 
South County groups, six in 10 pay more than $750 per month. Among owners who 
have had their homes five years or less, 74% have mortgages costing more than 
$750. The comparable figure for those who've been in place more than 10 years 
is just 18%. And while 40% of renters who have been in their residences less 
than six years pay more than $750, just 14% of those who've been there more 
than 10 years are stuck with similar payments.

An off-duty police detective helped a group of bystanders chase a pair of 
alleged robbers in Woodland Hills and then shot one of the suspects as he 
raised a butcher knife to attack his pursuers, Los Angeles police reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. William Hall said Edward Lujan, 27, was in critical condition at Northridge 
Hospital Medical Center and will be arrested on suspicion of robbery when his 
condition permits. 
</P>
<P>
Mario Carello, 25, was arrested on suspicion of robbery. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Ted Ball, a member of the robbery-homicide division, was off-duty and 
taking his wife to dinner about 5:30 p.m. Thursday when he saw two men 
assaulting and robbing a woman in the parking lot of a drug store in the 22000 
block of Clarendon Street, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Ball, 39, and several other bystanders who saw the attack began to chase the 
men, who split up during the pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
Lujan turned toward a small group of people who had chased him into an alley 
and allegedly raised the knife, Hall said. Ball fired a shot, which struck 
Lujan in the back. 
</P>
<P>
After the shooting, police went to a nearby home where Lujan had been staying 
with friends. Carello was found there and arrested. 
</P>
<P>
The 50-year-old woman who had been robbed was treated for a bruise on her head, 
police said.

President Alan Garcia said today he will attend a drug summit in Colombia on 
Feb. 15 now that President Bush has promised to reduce the number of U.S. 
troops in Panama to their pre-invasion levels. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after the United States invaded Panama on Dec. 20 and toppled the regime 
of Manuel A. Noriega, Garcia and other Latin American leaders protested to 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia said at the time that he would boycott the summit, probably sending a 
government minister in his place. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia, Bush and the presidents of Colombia and Bolivia had planned to 
coordinate their fight against drug trafficking at the meeting in Cartagena. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, President Bush said he would reduce the U.S. military 
presence in Panama to its pre-invasion level of about 13,000 troops "well 
before the end of February." He did not give a specific date.

<P>
In a speech that launched a new era for South Africa, President Frederik W. de 
Klerk today lifted a 30-year ban on the African National Congress and announced 
that its jailed figurehead, Nelson R. Mandela, will soon be released. 
</P>
<P>
In his watershed address to Parliament, De Klerk said the ANC and 
</P>
<P>
other black nationalist movements will be legalized immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"The season of violence is over. The time for reconstruction and reconciliation 
has arrived," he told the white-dominated Parliament's opening session in a 
speech setting the scene for a negotiated settlement to South Africa's 
political deadlock. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk said his long-term aim is the formulation of a new constitution that 
will give the vote to all South Africans, regardless of color, and that will 
put an end to racial domination. 
</P>
<P>
Education Minister Stoffel van der Merwe said the form of universal franchise 
would have to be negotiated with black leaders but that it would not let the 
black majority dominate whites. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk said his government will decide on a date for Mandela's release "soon" 
but added that a short delay is unavoidable. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish to put it plainly that the government has taken a firm decision to 
release Mr. Mandela unconditionally," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Government sources said shortly after the announcement that Mandela, jailed for 
life in 1964 for plotting to overthrow white rule, could be free within a week. 
</P>
<P>
Other measures announced in De Klerk's speech included a temporary halt to 
executions, an easing of restrictions on reporting political unrest and a 
six-month limit to political detention without trial. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk's sweeping concessions were greeted cautiously by ANC leaders but with 
jubilation by thousands of anti-apartheid activists who turned out in the 
streets of Cape Town and Johannesburg to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela's wife, Winnie, who led a 5,000-strong protest march through Cape Town, 
said De Klerk had not gone far enough and that apartheid should be scrapped 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not prepared to accept a bone with no meat. Unbanning the ANC and 
leaving apartheid as it is is no deal," she told the marchers. 
</P>
<P>
In Harare, a senior ANC official said the movement saw "some substantive 
changes," and veteran ANC leader Walter Sisulu told a news conference in 
Stockholm: "Victory is in sight." 
</P>
<P>
World reaction was swift and generally positive, with some of the warmest 
praise coming from British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who said she would 
invite both De Klerk and Mandela to London for talks. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush welcomed De Klerk's package, but said further development of the 
trends in it would be needed before he ends economic sanctions against South 
Africa. Bush has invited Mandela and De Klerk to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Even hard-line black African apartheid critics joined in the chorus of praise, 
although Nigeria, Zambia and Ghana said De Klerk should have done more. 
</P>
<P>
Inside South Africa, moderate black leader Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi, head of 
the 2-million-strong Zulu Inkatha movement, said De Klerk had now proved he was 
sincere about apartheid reform. 
</P>
<P>
The news from Cape Town immediately boosted South Africa's beleaguered economy, 
and the Johannesburg stock exchange closed sharply higher at record levels.

Marina Ogilvy, a close relative of Queen Elizabeth II whose pregnancy out of 
wedlock brought the British Royal Family unwelcome publicity, was married today 
with the queen's blessing. 
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old bride, four months pregnant, did not wear a traditional white 
dress, and there was none of the lavish spectacle normally associated with 
royal weddings. 
</P>
<P>
The private ceremony ended a dispute between Ogilvy and her parents, the 
queen's cousin Princess Alexandra and businessman Sir Angus Ogilvy, who she 
claimed had cut her off after she became pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
Ogilvy, 24th in line to the British throne, married Paul Mowatt, a 26-year-old 
photographer, at a 19th-Century church near her parents' home. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 photographers and reporters jostled outside as the dark-haired Ogilvy 
arrived in a rust-colored bolero and mid-calf black velvet dress with matching 
hat. 
</P>
<P>
Sir Angus met his daughter with a kiss and asked, "How are you, darling?" She 
smiled and he led her down the aisle. 
</P>
<P>
Their embrace signaled the end of a dispute which hit the headlines after 
Ogilvy told a newspaper in October that her parents tried to trick her into 
having an abortion or marrying by special license.

China lodged "a strong protest" against the Bush Administration and Congress 
today for imposing economic and military sanctions in response to the crushing 
of pro-democracy demonstrations last year. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu delivered the toughly worded protest to 
James Lilley, the U.S. ambassador to Beijing, the official New China News 
Agency said. 
</P>
<P>
"I am instructed to express our utmost indignation and lodge a strong protest 
with the U.S. government against the hegemonistic (aggressive) act of the U.S. 
Congress," Liu said. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration is responsible for "the unbridled anti-China waves 
stirred up by the U.S. Congress," he charged. 
</P>
<P>
While China has aimed its previous attacks at the Congress over the sanctions 
issue, the latest protest was also clearly directed at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, who signed the long-stalled sanctions bill this week after 
modifying it in the face of a hostile Congress, was not mentioned by name in 
the Chinese protest.

The new stamp depicts John Marshall, the fourth chief justice, whose likeness

"When it comes to members of the court who were not John Marshall, the pickings 
are slim," Rehnquist said during a ceremony at a larger-than-life statue of 
Marshall in the Supreme Court building.

A former Politburo member and political enemy of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev 
was expelled from the Communist Party for using his influence to buy a 
Mercedes, Tass reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The harsh action against die-hard conservative Yuri F. Solovyov came three days 
before a critical meeting of the party Central Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The expulsion was another humiliation for Solovyov, the former Leningrad party 
chief who was defeated during the spring in the vote for Parliament despite 
having no opposition. More than 50% of the voters crossed his lone name off the 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Solovyov was expelled at an emergency meeting of the Leningrad party committee 
Thursday, the day after the sensational Leningrad TV program "600 Seconds" 
broadcast a report showing his name on an auto registration list. Journalist 
Alexander Nevzorov told viewers it had become easy to buy a Mercedes-Benz 280-S 
for 9,780 rubles.

JAPAN TRADE SURPLUS DROPS TO 4-YEAR LOW

<P>
Japan cut its massive trade surplus with the rest of the world by 28.4% last 
year, the government reported today, but economists say the surplus will climb 
again in the year ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Record spending by Japanese abroad, higher oil imports and a strong dollar 
helped cut the trade surplus in 1989 to its lowest level in four years. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's current account, the broadest measure of trade in goods and services, 
narrowed to $56.98 billion in 1989 from $79.63 billion in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's invisible trade deficit, which includes the money Japanese spend as 
tourists overseas, ballooned to $15.93 billion in 1989 from $11.26 billion in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
With 9.6 million Japanese traveling abroad last year, Japan's travel deficit 
amounted to a record $19.33 billion in 1989 and accounted for a large part of 
the reduction in the current-account surplus, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
"Tourism was very, very important. Travel abroad has increased by 20% in each 
of the last three years," said Matthew Berlow, an economist at Credit Lyonnais 
Alexanders Laing and Cruickshank Securities. 
</P>
<P>
A stronger dollar in 1989 was a major cause of the sharp decline in the trade 
surplus, said Hidehiro Iwaki, an economist at the Nomura Research Institute. 
</P>
<P>
A high U.S. currency depresses the value of Japanese exports denominated in 
dollars and accounted for roughly 30% of the $18 billion reduction in the 1989 
trade surplus. 
</P>
<P>
Exports totaled $269.63 billion in 1989 against $259.77 billion the previous 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Slower U.S. economic growth and capacity limitations among some Japanese 
manufacturers, mainly auto makers, triggered by robust Japanese domestic 
demand, also curtailed exports. 
</P>
<P>
"Some goods for export might have been shifted to the domestic market," said 
Chiharu Sumita, an economist at UBS Phillips and Drew International. 
</P>
<P>
"Capacity constraints put a drag on Japanese exports although they've started 
to expand production capacity lately," Iwaki said. 
</P>
<P>
Japan imported more oil at higher prices in 1989 and that gave imports a boost, 
economists added. Imports last year totaled $192.50 billion against $164.75 
billion in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts cautioned, however, that progress in narrowing the trade surplus 
further could stall out this year. 
</P>
<P>
"We think the surplus for the full year will be somewhat larger in 1990 than it 
was in 1989," Berlow said. He foresees a current-account surplus of $63.9 
billion this year.

Hermes, the former saddle maker that grew into a global seller of fine silk 
scarves and luxury leather goods, announced today that the Japanese 
conglomerate Sumitomo has acquired a 1.2% stake in the company. 
</P>
<P>
It did not release further details of the purchase, but the financial daily 
Tribune de l'Expansion reported that Sumitomo bought the small stake for $18 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The four daughters of Hermes founder Emile Hermes have 17 children, and 
together the family holds 90.3% of the company. 
</P>
<P>
Sumitomo got its foot in the door when the 9.7% stake not in family hands was 
sold by three French banks that held the shares. Hermes did not disclose the 
names of any of the other new holders.

JOBLESS RATE HOLDS STEADY, 'CLEAR' SIGN OF HEALTHY ECONOMY

<P>
The nation's unemployment rate held steady at 5.3% for an eighth straight month 
in January, but the economy still produced 275,000 new jobs, the government 
said today in a report that analysts took as a refreshing sign of an economic 
rebound. 
</P>
<P>
"This shows the economy is strengthening. It's about as clear an indication as 
we're going to get that the economy is not going down," said Michael K. Evans, 
head of a private Washington forecasting firm. 
</P>
<P>
"It has to relieve some of the fears that we're headed for recession," added 
economist David Wyss of DRI-McGraw Hill. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the steady jobless rate and better-than-expected job growth were 
especially encouraging in light of the economy's sluggish 0.5% growth at the 
end of 1989, the poorest showing in more than three years. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department said January's strong job growth figures might be 
overstated because the warm weather last month, which followed a bitter cold 
December, made it difficult to seasonally adjust job totals for construction 
and other industries affected by weather. 
</P>
<P>
Delays in the reporting of post-Christmas layoffs in retail trade also may have 
skewed the numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Factory jobs dropped 112,000 last month, with 90,000 of the losses suffered by 
the struggling auto industry. However, many of those laid-off auto workers have 
been recalled since last month, when the Labor Department conducted its survey 
to gauge job growth, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
It was the 10th straight month that manufacturing jobs declined. Yet analysts 
were impressed at the economy's ability to absorb those losses without a hike 
in the jobless rate. 
</P>
<P>
"The auto industry has taken a really big hit, but the rest of the economy is 
marching along and has virtually swallowed up the manufacturing losses," said 
Robert Dederick, chief economist for the Northern Trust Co. of Chicago. 
</P>

Michigan has been particularly hard hit by the manufacturing decline; the

Jacques Calvet, president of France's Peugeot S.A., warned today that at least 
one of six major European auto makers will go bankrupt unless reciprocity in 
car trade between Japan and the European Community is maintained. 
</P>
<P>
"In 10 years, the capacity of Japanese auto makers manufacturing cars in Europe 
will exceed 1.5 million units, forcing one full-range automobile maker or an 
equivalent to go bankrupt," Calvet said at a news conference at the Japan 
National Press Club. 
</P>
<P>
He said globalization of the auto industry will be hampered unless reciprocity 
and harmony are established. 
</P>
<P>
Calvet said European auto makers demand that the number of Japanese cars 
registered in Europe, including locally manufactured vehicles, be limited until 
European car exports to Japan grow to a reasonable level. 
</P>
<P>
He said the ceiling should be set at a ratio of one European car sold in Japan 
to two Japanese vehicles marketed in Europe.

Producer-director Steven Spielberg will participate in the 62nd annual Academy 
Awards presentation -- but an Academy spokesman declined to elaborate, except 
to say that Spielberg will do more than present an award. 
</P>
<P>
This will mark Spielberg's fourth appearance on the show. In 1986, the director 
received the Academy's Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award, and he has presented 
the best director award on two previous occasions. 
</P>
<P>
Spielberg has never won an Oscar himself, though his films, "Close Encounters 
of the Third Kind,"(1977) "Raiders of the Lost Ark,"(1981) and "E.T., The 
Extra-Terrestrial," (1982), all garnered nominations for best director.

DOCUDRAMAS TAKE FICTION'S LIBERTIES WITH OUR HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Millions of American television viewers are going to spend the February 
"sweeps" ratings period reliving events from our national past -- although some 
of the events didn't happen the way they will on television. 
</P>
<P>
It is history as entertainment, currently one of the hottest forms of 
television programming. This is how many of us learn history these days -- in 
our living rooms, munching popcorn, watching Annette O'Toole as Rose Kennedy, 
Powers Booth as super-spy John Walker Jr., Karen Allen as teacher-astronaut 
Christa McAuliffe or Tom Hulce as civil rights worker Mickey Schwerner. 
</P>
<P>
The big events of the February sweeps are CBS' "Family of Spies" starting 
Sunday night, NBC's "Murder in Mississippi" Monday night, ABC's "The Kennedys 
of Massachusetts" starting Feb. 18 and ABC's "Challenger" Feb. 25. 
</P>
<P>
There are great liberties taken in the movies and miniseries airing this month. 
The private life, including bedroom scenes, of slain civil rights worker 
Schwerner and his wife, Rita, was fictionalized by the screenwriter of "Murder 
in Mississippi." Stanley Weiser said he had to "take dramatic license" because 
the real Rita Schwerner declined to participate. The critical scene in 
"Challenger" in which executives of Morton-Thiokol OK the space shuttle launch 
despite questions about the safety of O-rings the company manufactured for the 
shuttle is based on one man's recollection (the only man from whom producers 
bought story rights). There is no mention that other participants in the 
meeting depicted offer a contradictory version. 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the film is seen through Christa McAuliffe's eyes. Yet, because 
McAuliffe's family declined to participate, more "dramatic license" was 
employed in her private relationships, too. 
</P>
<P>
"The Kennedys of Massachusetts" overlooks such minor facts as Joe Kennedy Sr. 
being a bootlegger, while it includes made-up bedroom scenes between the young 
John Kennedy and an unidentified Englishwoman. 
</P>
<P>
There are a couple of simple reasons why we are seeing more of what Allen 
Sabinson, the head of motion pictures and miniseries for ABC, calls "true 
stories": prestige and ratings. 
</P>
<P>
"Look back at the Emmy nominations for last year," Sabinson says. " 'My Name Is 
Bill W.' (about the founding of Alcoholics Anonymous), 'Murderers Among Us' 
(Simon Wiesenthal and the aftermath of the Holocaust), 'Roe vs. Wade' (the 
Supreme Court's 1973 ruling on abortion)." 
</P>
<P>
And "true stories," both particular and historical docudramas, get ratings, 
too. The highest-rated movie or miniseries of all time is the historical 
docudrama "Roots." Such recent historical docudramas as "Cross of Fire," "The 
Murder of Mary Phagan," "Roe vs. Wade" and "My Name Is Bill W." have all done 
well in the ratings.

"Miami Vice" actor Don Johnson may turn to a bank next time he needs a loan. 
And a friend of his may be sure his next deal is done in writing. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Johnson's company, DJ Racing, secured an interest-free $300,000 loan 
from Johnson's friend, lawyer and real estate investor Martin Ergas. Ergas has 
sued for failure to repay the loan by November, but Johnson says the money to 
build a racing boat isn't due to be paid back until 1995. 
</P>
<P>
Donald M. Klein, attorney for Johnson and his company, said the lawsuit is "an 
effort to embarrass Mr. Johnson into settling. He does not do that as a general 
principle, and in this case he definitely doesn't do it."

Super-rich investor Sid Bass found a creative way to deal with an unwanted

Bass and his wife, Mercedes, plan to move their former neighbors' 
6,600-square-foot house to the grounds of the Lena Pope Home, a facility for

Officials say the donated four-bedroom French-style house will be used as a

The house is the former residence of the Mac Churchill family, who moved after

"Thank goodness the Basses are doing this," Churchill said. "Nobody else could 
have thought of doing it."

triumphs in 1988 and 1989, quit last week, leaving Steeb as its No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt under pressure but it was also nice to carry the responsibility," Steeb

UNION READY TO BACK PLAYERS WHO CHALLENGE NFL FREE-AGENT SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gene Upshaw, head of the NFL Players Assn., said today the union would back any 
player who challenges the league's Plan B free-agency system. 
</P>
<P>
Because the union has decertified, it no longer is a valid representative of 
the players. 
</P>
<P>
But Upshaw said that wouldn't stop the association from offering free advice to 
a player who takes the league to court over the system that allows teams to 
protect 37 players from Feb. 2 through April 1. 
</P>
<P>
"Quite naturally, if any player was interested in becoming the plaintiff in a 
lawsuit, we would definitely want to talk to him," Upshaw said. "We're not out 
soliciting plaintiffs, but we know who they are, and we've had a number of them 
call us. We would help those people." 
</P>
<P>
The National Football League has sought an injunction in Minneapolis to stop 
individuals from filing suit against Plan B but has yet to receive a ruling in 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
The league put Plan B into effect last year after the owners and the players 
union failed to reach a collective bargaining agreement. The process, which 
enables those players not on a team's 37-man protected list to become free 
agents, was challenged unsuccessfully by the union in court in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that it's an injustice that the better players in the league never get 
the chance to become free agents," Upshaw said. "It penalizes players who do 
well. If you do well, you have the distinct honor of being protected, and 
that's not fair and it's not right."

A Denver County Court referee today ordered Denver Broncos tackle Gerald Perry 
to serve 15 days in jail, perform 100 hours of community service and pay $269 
in fines and court costs for soliciting a prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
Perry will serve the 15 days concurrently with a 15-day Aurora jail term he is 
scheduled to begin serving Monday for a similar charge. 
</P>
<P>
Denver court referee Jim Scott sentenced Perry to 120 days in jail but 
suspended all but 15 on condition Perry has no additional violations for a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Perry had been convicted on the Denver charge in August but was given deferred 
judgment, meaning the case would have been dropped had he stayed out of 
trouble. It was reviewed after Perry was convicted of solicitation for 
prostitution in Aurora. 
</P>
<P>
The Aurora case against the 300-pound linebacker stemmed from his arrest there 
Sept. 7, three weeks after his conviction in Denver.

AKINEMOD FAVORED TO WIN $200,000 LA CANADA STAKES 
</P>

<P>
A field of six headed by Akinemod and Gorgeous has been entered in Saturday's 
$200,000-added La Canada Stakes at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
Gorgeous will be ridden by Eddie Delahoussaye and was assigned 125 pounds for 
the 16th running of the 1 1/8-mile race for 4-year-old fillies. Akinemod will 
be ridden by Gary Stevens and was assigned 122 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Others entered were Luthier's Launch, who will be ridden by Alex Solis and was 
assigned 117 pounds; Lucky Song, Robbie Davis, 117 pounds; Excellent Lady, 
Chris McCarron, 115 pounds, and Kelly, Patrick Valenzuela, 114 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
If all six entries go to the post, the total purse will be $213,500 and the 
winner will earn $123,500. 
</P>
<P>
Akinemod has won six straight races, including the La Brea Breeders' Cup and El 
Encino Stakes in her last two starts. She won the El Encino by 18 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
Gorgeous was scratched from the El Encino because of an off track. She hasn't 
raced since finishing second behind Bayakoa in the Breeders' Cup Distaff in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
A victory in the La Canada race will enable Akinemod to become the third filly 
to sweep the La Canada Series, joining Taisez Vous (1978) and Mitterand (1985). 
The first two races of the series were the La Brea Breeders' Cup and El Encino 
Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
The La Canada Stakes will be run as the eighth race Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
In the fifth race of the day, the $100,000-added Legend's Last Ride, Bill 
Shoemaker will be aboard Patchy Groundfog in the final race of his illustrious 
career. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday night, Hot Operator, making his first start in more than four 
months, overtook 9-10 favorite Tanker Port in the late going to win the $60,000 
feature race at Santa Anita by 1 3/4 lengths before a crowd of 12,833. 
</P>
<P>
Hot Operator, ridden by Chris McCarron and carrying 115 pounds, covered one 
mile in 1:37.40 and paid $6.40, $2.40 and $2.20. 
</P>
<P>
The win was the fifth in 16 lifetime starts for Hot Operator and was worth 
$33,000, raising the 5-year-old Florida-bred son of Well Decorated's career 
earnings to $258,550. 
</P>
<P>
Tanker Port, ridden by Robbie Davis and carrying 117 pounds, crossed the finish 
line one length in front of Captain Holly and returned $2.20 and $2.20. 
</P>
<P>
Captain Holly, ridden by Eddie Delahoussaye and carrying 116 pounds, was a 
half-length ahead of Charlatan at the wire and paid $2.40 to show.

KITE'S CONSISTENCY MAKES HIM ALL-TIME PGA MONEY WINNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was bad enough blowing last year's U.S. Open with a ghastly final round 78. 
Poised to win his first major championship, Tom Kite suddenly lost his iron 
grip and did a complete nose-dive. 
</P>
<P>
It happened, and Kite woke up the next morning to read his obituary. A man who 
built his career on the rock of consistency was being reduced to pebbles. 
</P>
<P>
"People said I'd never win another golf tournament, that I was finished," Kite 
says contemptuously. "That's just the opinion of so-called experts who don't 
know diddly." 
</P>
<P>
The so-called experts have never been much taken with Kite. Sure, he wins a ton 
of money, and yes, he's as persistent as a Texas mosquito, but steadiness and 
consistency don't make hearts race with excitement. 
</P>
<P>
Seve Ballesteros is either very good or very bad. Greg Norman grabs a golf 
course by the flagstick and tries to strangle it. Tom Kite credits his success 
to the fact that he avoids mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pretty good at managing my game around the golf course," Kite says. "I 
obviously have a pretty well-balanced game." 
</P>
<P>
That's why his performance in the U.S. Open at Oak Hill Country Club was so out 
of character. One stroke ahead as the final round began, Kite made a triple 
bogey on the fifth hole and finished in a tie for eighth place. 
</P>
<P>
But think twice before writing off Kite. He rebounded from his U.S. Open 
debacle to win the Nabisco Championships in October and pass Jack Nicklaus and 
Tom Watson as the PGA Tour's career money leader. The Nabisco victory was worth 
a cool $625,000. 
</P>
<P>
Fiercely proud, the 5-foot-8, 150-pound Kite made his point loud and clear. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think I was finished," Kite says. "It was a matter of showing other 
people what I was made of." 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 PGA Player of the Year, Kite is playing better than ever at age 40. He 
won three tournaments last year and set a new single-season record with 
earnings of $1,395,278. Though he has won just 13 tournaments in an 18-year 
career, Kite's paychecks have exceeded $5.6 million, which is a record. 
</P>
<P>
Kite started today three strokes behind leader Payne Stewart in the $1-million 
Pebble Beach National Pro-Am after shooting a 69 on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Kite won the tournament in 1983, when it was still called the Crosby, shooting 
a course record 62 at fabled Pebble Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a really nice love affair with Pebble Beach," Kite says. "That's 
probably my favorite course in the world, and Cypress Point is probably my 
second favorite. 
</P>
<P>
"We play an awful lot of great golf courses on the tour, but we don't play any 
the caliber of Pebble Beach. That's because there simply aren't any." 
</P>
<P>
The love affair has been tested a couple of times recently. Kite lost a playoff 
to Curtis Strange in the 1988 Nabisco Championships at Pebble Beach, and fell 
one shot short of Mark O'Meara in last year's Pebble Beach National Pro-Am. 
</P>
<P>
"I still remember my disappointments," Kite says. "But you have to move on. You 
don't have a choice." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Kite Sr. taught his son the game at an early age. Young Tom played some 
Little League baseball in Austin, Tex., but golf never had much competition 
when it came to keeping the boy's attention. 
</P>
<P>
"Golf was all I did," Kite says. "Being as small as I was, I didn't have much 
choice." 
</P>
<P>
He became an accomplished player, but there was another kid in town who always 
seemed to get the headlines. A kid named Ben Crenshaw. It took many years for 
Kite to step outside Crenshaw's charismatic shadow, and while they remain 
friends, the experience clearly shaped Kite's stubborn, I'll-show-'em 
character. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're 13 or 14 years old, that hurts," Kite says. "You don't understand 
at that age that the so-called experts aren't really experts." 
</P>
<P>
Crenshaw and Kite were teammates at the University of Texas. Crenshaw won the 
NCAA individual title in 1970 and 1971, and they tied for top honors in 1972, 
after which both players turned pro. 
</P>
<P>
"I always knew I was going to make it," Kite says. "I felt that if (Crenshaw) 
could make it, I could make it, because I was extremely competitive with him." 
</P>
<P>
Kite finished among the top 60 money winners in 1973, his first year on tour, 
and has not had what could be considered a bad year since. Since 1981, when he 
topped the money list after finishing in the top 10 in an incredible 21 of 26 
tournaments, Kite has been the most consistent player in golf. 
</P>
<P>
He doubts he'll ever match the weekly precision of 1981, now that he has three 
young children and spends less time on the practice tee. Last year marked just 
the second time in his career that he won more than one tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly I would love to have the consistency I had in 1981, but I don't know 
if I'll be able to get it again," Kite says. "I'm not able to get that momentum 
going as easily as I did. 
</P>
<P>
"But when I get in contention, I play better under the heat. I may not win 
every tournament, but I'm going to come very close." 
</P>
<P>
During a recent golf telecast, Johnny Miller marveled at the way Kite remains 
enthusiastic about golf this long into his career. Kite is perhaps the finest 
iron player in the game, and he didn't get that way by accident; he spends as 
many hours as anyone on the practice tee at tournament sites. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole deal with playing well is staying excited," Kite says. "If you can 
stay excited and stay in shape, there's no reason you can't play well into your 
40s or 50s. I'm still excited about winning golf tournaments." 
</P>
<P>
His peers respect his consistency and work ethic, though Kite disagrees with 
those who call him an overachiever. 
</P>
<P>
"Overachiever or underachiever is someone else's perception of what you should 
be able to do," Kite says. "The trick is not listening to critics. Don't listen 
to people who say one player ought to be the best when he's not the best. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't found anybody in my career who can come close to looking into 
someone's heart or gut."

STAR SOFTBALL HURLER MICHELE GRANGER FIGHTING BACK FROM MYSTIFYING INJURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWIGHT CHAPIN, SAN FRANCISCO EXAMINER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michele Granger never thought it would turn out this way. 
</P>
<P>
Last year at this time, she was one of the best women's softball pitchers in 
the world -- maybe the best. Granger, who rewrote the record books at Valencia 
High School in Placentia, was expected to dominate college hitters the way 
she'd handled national and international hitters for years, and perhaps lead 
the California Golden Bears to a national championship. 
</P>
<P>
Then it happened. 
</P>
<P>
Her pitching hand began to swell. It would start in her left index finger, move 
down into her palm and back up through her middle finger. 
</P>
<P>
Before long, the young woman who threw a fastball 70 m.p.h. couldn't throw at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
"It was impossible to grip the ball," she said. 
</P>
<P>
After pitching just 25 innings as a Cal freshman last season, Granger had to go 
on an enforced athletic vacation -- which was no fun at all for someone who'd 
said: "I'm very much a perfectionist. I don't want to be average." 
</P>
<P>
Making matters worse was the fact that doctors haven't been able to determine 
what's causing the swelling. And months of therapy haven't taken care of the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw a couple of therapists just about every day last summer," she said. 
"They thought it might be a nerve, might be a muscle, might be this and that. 
But they never found anything conclusive." 
</P>
<P>
Granger does have less swelling now, though. She's been working out with the 
fingers of her left hand taped in an effort to keep the inflammation down, and 
she's going to try to pitch through the pain. 
</P>
<P>
"I still want to throw," she said, "and the doctors say there shouldn't be any 
harm as long as I don't let the hand get too swollen. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to say what will happen long term. . . . I think I'm going to be a 
little slower than I'd like, and it will be interesting to see if I have any 
control. I'm probably throwing in the lower 60s now, but by mid-season I'd like 
to be back into the 70s and throwing some smoke." 
</P>
<P>
Cal Coach Diane Ninemire said she'll probably test Granger -- who will retain 
four years of eligibility -- on Feb. 7, when her Bears, 38-26 and tied for 
ninth in 1989 national rankings, open their season with a double-header in 
Berkeley against Santa Clara. 
</P>
<P>
It's already been a new year to remember for Granger who married John Poulos, a 
law student, Dec. 30. 
</P>
<P>
And she has taken off the 10 pounds or so she gained during her inactivity last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"Having to fit into a wedding dress does wonders for your figure," she said.
