There are, in this endlessly fascinating land of ours, museums devoted entirely 
to a collection of cast-iron farm-implement seats, to cheese, to brassieres. So 
why not this one, to creatures that may or may not exist? 
</P>
<P>
The Cryptozoology Museum opens this weekend in Malibu, and "we define 
cryptozoology as being the search for mysterious creatures," says its curator, 
Jon Beckjord. 
</P>
<P>
His assorted studies on the Loch Ness Monster, the yeti and its West Coast 
cousins -- Bigfoot, sasquatch, whatever -- and other creatures of fact or 
fancy, such as Africa's Mokele M'Bembe, form the core of the display. Also, it 
helps Beckjord clean out his garage of at least a dozen years of research by 
the former Bay Area city planner, who "got bored (with that work) and went off 
to look for Bigfoot and I guess my mistake was I found it." 
</P>
<P>
Not for him the creatures of pure myth -- the roc, the chimera, the unicorn. 
Instead, "We're trying to offer the ones that to the best of our knowledge 
appear to be verified, or haven't at least been debunked." 
</P>
<P>
Housed for now in a room off the Trancas Restaurant that converts to a dance 
floor by night, the collection of "pictures, mostly" is intended to offer 
enough alternatives to satisfy everyone, from skeptics to zealots: "1, that 
there is no such thing -- and we have uncovered some hoaxes. 2, that they are 
rare, difficult-to-find creatures . . . like the coelacanth (a prehistoric fish 
thought to be extinct and finally caught alive in the 1930s) . . . 3, new 
explanations. . . . This really borders on some radical ideas that disturb some 
people, so we'll go at it lightly." 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant itself, says Beckjord, may soon offer a Bigfoot Burger theme 
lunch. 
</P>
<P>
Accompanied, perhaps, by a bowl of Scotch broth, in which you think you see a 
sea serpent. 
</P>
<P>
Scores of food writers and critics convening here for the International Food 
Media Conference had a thoughtful little gift awaiting them at the Biltmore 
headquarters. In addition to the usual hotel guest array of shampoo, shower cap 
and chocolate mint, these guests were presented with a small shopping bag 
filled with Alka Seltzer, Tums and Rolaids. 
</P>
<P>
Food. It's a tough job but someone's got to do it. 
</P>
<P>
The not-to-miss event at "one of the two most prestigious dog shows in the 
country," the Kennel Club of Beverly Hills' extravaganza this Sunday: the 
herding demonstration, wherein dogs herd ranch and farm animals. 
</P>
<P>
De rigueur training for what to do when bulls cavort through those Rodeo Drive 
china shops. 
</P>
<P>
When his rented helicopter lost power and dropped to the ground Friday, Ed 
Mauldin adroitly executed an emergency landing called "full down auto rotation" 
and put down at a Panorama City construction site. 
</P>
<P>
Too bad the FAA wasn't watching. Because Mauldin had been on his way to Van 
Nuys Airport to take the oral exam for his flight instructor's certification. 
And when he finally arrived, he didn't pass. "My nerves were shot," the 
seasoned pilot said. 
</P>
<P>
That same maneuver is required on the other part of the test that Mauldin has 
yet to take. But since he's already done it, "maybe this one will count," he 
said hopefully. 
</P>
<P>
In a California champagne-maker's Valentine's list of the nation's most 
romantic cities, San Francisco came in first, Honolulu second and L.A. third. 
</P>
<P>
So far, so good. But keep in mind that this is a computer analysis -- and how 
many times have you shared a split of vintage brut with a computer? This 
computer factored in marriages and divorces, restaurants, sales of flowers, 
diamonds and champagne, and miles of walkable shoreline, and also concluded 
that the nation's seventh and 10th most romantic cities are Rochester, N.Y., 
and Grand Rapids, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
If only Cole Porter had known, we might have had a different song entirely: "I 
love Rochester in the summer, when it sizzles . . ."

Demos Shakarian is back in full authority this week as president of the Full 
Gospel Business Men's Fellowship International, based in Costa Mesa, after the 
group's board voted last Sunday in Palm Springs to absolve him of internal 
allegations that he accrued more financial benefits than the law allows and did 
not fully account for six years of travel expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Shakarian, 75, placed controller Peter Taylor on "administrative leave." Taylor 
had been accused by Shakarian backers in the deeply divided organization of 
undermining Shakarian's credibility, which Taylor denied. 
</P>
<P>
Although the board's audit committee had informed the Internal Revenue Service 
last year that Shakarian had $276,000 in benefits that should have been 
reported as income, board members were persuaded by arguments that an outside 
review of company records was incomplete and possibly misleading and that the 
accusations arose from attempts to curtail Shakarian's authority. 
</P>
<P>
Treasurer Gerald Walker, a retired businessman in Denver, said this week that 
he felt "very badly about the whitewashing of . . . Demos without any 
documentation. He will still have to answer to God and to the IRS, not 
necessarily in that order." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Bellinger, a Shakarian aide, had with him in Palm Springs a box of 
documents and receipts that he said accounted for all but $6,000 of $108,000 in 
travel expenses. Bill Morretti, a former tax accountant from Stanton who was at 
the meeting, said he examined the contents and was satisfied that Shakarian was 
wronged. 
</P>
<P>
Difficult times are still ahead for the pioneering Pentecostal organization. A 
budget of $5.5 million was proposed for 1989, but the executive committee 
imposed a ceiling of $4 million -- the approximate income during 1988. 
</P>
<P>
CONFERENCES 
</P>
<P>
Father Dennis Mikulanis, the interfaith and ecumenical officer for the San 
Diego Catholic Diocese, is expected to become only the second Catholic priest 
ever elected president of the San Diego County Ecumenical Conference when the 
organization holds its 19th General Assembly on Sunday. Mikulanis, the lone 
nominee for the two-year post, will succeed the Rev. Faith Conklin, a United 
Methodist minister. The 2 p.m. meeting of the predominantly Protestant 
conference will be at Chula Vista First United Methodist Church, and the Rev. 
Ellis Casson, pastor of Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church in San Diego, 
will be the principal speaker. 
</P>
<P>
More than 500 lay and rabbinical delegates will take part next weekend in a 
five-state regional convention for Reform Judaism's Union of American Hebrew 
Congregations at the Newport Beach Marriott Hotel and Tennis Club. The 
three-day, biennial meeting begins Friday and includes a Saturday night banquet 
address by Albert Vorspan of New York, national senior vice president of the 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
ACTION 
</P>
<P>
After five months of operation and with the help of federal grants, the 
Hope-Net project of the Mid-Wilshire Parish has established nine food 
distribution centers in that area of Los Angeles. The Mid-Wilshire Parish is a 
cooperative organization of 12 churches and one Jewish temple. Project director 
Larry W. Hixon, a Disciples minister whose office is on the third floor of St. 
James Episcopal Church, said Hope-Net also plans to provide housing for the 
homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Jewish "para-chaplains" for nursing homes in the Los Angeles area will be 
trained in a course given on eight successive Thursday nights, starting Feb. 9, 
at the Jewish Federation Building, 6505 Wilshire Blvd. The program, which has 
already graduated and assigned 50 men and women, trains volunteers to visit 
nursing homes twice a month, conduct religious services, arrange holiday 
programs and visit with lonely patients, according to Rabbi Martin Ryback, 
chaplaincy director for the Southern California Board of Rabbis. JOHN DART

SIMI VALLEY CLINCHES SHARE OF TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Greg Hess came bounding out of the visitors' locker room at Simi Valley High 
with score book held high and that I've-found-the-cure-for-cancer look. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I just found out the real story," the Westlake coach said with 
conviction. Listeners leaned forward in anticipation. "Five-for-16 from the 
line." 
</P>
<P>
Hess was explaining his Warriors' 61-59 Marmonte League loss to Simi Valley on 
Friday night. Indeed, it was rather chilly around Westlake's free-throw line 
(Simi Valley, on the other hand, made 19 of 26), but the real story was 
standing several yards away, entangled in one vicious high-five session. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley's Steve Carnes and Mike Wawryk, the high-fivers, scored 19 and 17 
points, respectively, to help the Pioneers to a share of the league title. They 
now have won or shared four consecutive championships. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley and Camarillo, which lost to Thousand Oaks on Friday, will play 
Wednesday at Camarillo where the Pioneers can win the title outright. 
</P>
<P>
For Carnes and Wawryk, the win over Westlake was significant. Carnes, the lone 
returnee from last season's Southern Section 4-A Division champion, admittedly 
has been erratic. His play Friday was confident, controlled and effective. 
</P>
<P>
"Some nights I come in and the shots fall in, and other nights they won't fall 
for nothing," Carnes said. "Those things happen. I came in here knowing I had 
been playing inconsistently, and I just wanted to come out and play as good as 
I possibly could." 
</P>
<P>
The 6-1 junior scored 7 points in the fourth quarter, including 3 free throws 
in the final 3 minutes and 2 long-range jump shots that helped overcome a 47-45 
Westlake advantage after 3 quarters. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the kids really respect Steve's athletic ability," Simi Valley Coach 
Dean Bradshaw said. "He's capable of bringing the guys to a level they're not 
used to playing at." 
</P>
<P>
Wawryk gives Simi Valley (16-7, 9-2) a consistent inside threat. The 6-5 
center, who had to leave the team over the summer because his family was 
moving, returned to Simi Valley just before the season began and 3 games ago 
won the starting job. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good time for me to come out and show what I can do," said Wawryk, who 
grabbed a team-high 8 rebounds and scored Simi Valley's first 8 points of the 
fourth quarter, which the Pioneers opened with a 14-2 run. 
</P>
<P>
Wawryk also helped contain Westlake center Kurt Schwan, who came into the game 
needing 3 rebounds for the single-season Westlake record (he got 9) and 11 
points for the school's career record (he got 6). 
</P>
<P>
Peter Mladina led the Warriors (13-9, 6-4) with 16 points.

MCLINN HOLDS THE ANSWERS FOR TAFT, 55-51 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brooklyn McLinn spent a restless Monday at Taft High 2 weeks ago, answering the 
perfunctory question from students with as little emotion as possible. Of 
course, when the logical follow-up to the first question was asked -- the one 
he secretly hoped his friends would not raise -- McLinn shrugged, rolled his 
eyes, and pointed a finger. 
</P>
<P>
Directly at himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Did you guys win? 
</P>
<P>
 "Uh, no, we didn't," McLinn would answer. 
</P>
<P>
 How did you lose? 
</P>
<P>
 "I committed the game-losing foul," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, McLinn, in fact, did commit the critical foul in Taft's 1-point 
loss to North Valley League rival Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night at Taft, however, he answered the lingering question -- how would 
he respond this time? -- with 15 points to lead Taft to a 55-51 win in a 
rematch with the Golden Cougars. 
</P>
<P>
"I hated what happened last time," McLinn said. And no wonder. He had fouled 
Kennedy's Cord Bailey, who hit a game-winning free throw with 3 seconds left. 
"All that stuff that they ask. 'How'd you lose?' 'What happened?' All that." 
</P>
<P>
But McLinn had all the answers in the victory that gives Taft (16-3, 6-2 in 
league play) the inside track to second place in North Valley play with 2 games 
to go. All second-place teams will play at home in the first round of the City 
Section 4-A Division playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
McLinn and backcourt mate Dedan Thomas combined for 39 points, and more 
importantly, answered Kennedy's defensive challenge early. Kennedy used a 
collapsing defense all game against Taft, which meant that McLinn and Thomas 
would have to help loosen things by firing from the perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
McLinn, of course, was only too aware of this. The last time the teams met, he 
had missed his first few jump shots, and Kennedy stopped paying attention to 
the 5-foot-10 senior. 
</P>
<P>
"They just dropped right off me," McLinn said. "They stopped guarding me. It 
was important that I hit the first couple tonight." 
</P>
<P>
McLinn, in fact, made 4 of 6 field-goal attempts and scored 11 points in the 
first half, including 3 3-point shots as Taft built a 40-36 halftime lead. 
McLinn and Thomas scored all but 7 of Taft's points in the half. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy, however, was able to use its superior strength inside to make its only 
run of the game in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Senior forward Randy Brown, who finished with a game-high 26 points, pulled the 
Golden Cougars into a 32-32 tie with 4:33 left in the third quarter when he 
scored on a bank shot to cap an 8-4 run. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the most underrated player in the Valley," Taft Coach Jim Woodard said of 
Brown. "He is a force, I can tell you." 
</P>
<P>
Taft, however, outscored Kennedy, 8-4, to take a 40-36 lead entering the fourth 
quarter. Kennedy (12-6, 5-3) missed its first 4 shots of the fourth quarter -- 
a harbinger of things to come -- and made only 5 of 20 in the period. 
</P>
<P>
Taft, on the other hand, was handed all it needed by Thomas at the free-throw 
line. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, an All-American point guard, made his first 6 free throws in the fourth 
quarter and 8 of 9 in the period. 
</P>
<P>
McLinn also hit a pair of free throws in the fourth quarter as Taft made 11 of 
17. Kennedy made only 3 of 7 free throws in the quarter and 5 of 13 in all. 
</P>
<P>
So, when McLinn holds his ground and again points a finger at himself next 
Monday, it will probably be a thumbs-up sign.

THE COLLEGES; 
</P>
<P>
WASHOUT AT CS NORTHRIDGE DELAYS SEASON DEBUT FOR EAGER UMPIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There were a lot of unhappy coaches and ballplayers Friday when the rains came 
and forced the postponement of several openers for Valley-area college baseball 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
No one, however, was more disappointed than Nick Buncick, an umpire who has 
been a fixture on the high school, junior college and 4-year scene for 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Buncick, 49, stood in the Cal State Northridge dugout Friday afternoon, 
lamenting the fate of the Matadors' opener against the University of San Diego 
and looking like a child who had just lost his dog. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I sound like a kid sometimes," Buncick said, "but I love to be out 
here. I think I look forward to the season more than the players." 
</P>
<P>
Originally from Ohio, Buncick moved to California in 1967. But after attending 
the Al Summers Umpires School in Daytona Beach, Fla., he worked 2 seasons in 
the Class-A Midwest League calling balls and strikes for players such as 
Carlton Fisk, Vida Blue and Bill Lee. 
</P>
<P>
Buncick has worked 17 years for the Rapid Transit District, arranging his 
schedule as a dispatcher around his umpiring assignments. This season, he will 
work about 70 games, the majority of which will be spent behind the plate. 
</P>
<P>
"You can get into more trouble on the bases," Buncick said. "Gimme the plate 
any day." 
</P>
<P>
All on the line: Steve Murphy, a sophomore guard at Moorpark, had a feeling 
that he was going to have a good year at the free-throw line after making 16 of 
his first 17 free throws. However, he never expected to have a chance at 
breaking Steve Ornelaz's record of 27 consecutive free throws set during the 
1978-79 season. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy has made 25 consecutive free throws in the past 8 games and hopes to 
break Ornelaz's record tonight when Moorpark plays host to Glendale College. 
</P>
<P>
"The streak is making me nervous at the line," Murphy said. "Once I get the 
record out of the way it will take pressure off me." 
</P>
<P>
Murphy, who has not shot a free throw in the past 2 games, said that his 
confidence at the line has improved during the streak. 
</P>
<P>
Said Murphy: "Confidence is a real big part of it. If you go up there knowing 
that you are going to nail them, that's about 80% of it." 
</P>
<P>
Roadhouse blues: The Cal State Northridge volleyball team travels to San Diego 
State tonight looking for its first win in the Western Intercollegiate 
Volleyball Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors, who fell from 10th to 11th in the national rankings after WIVA 
defeats to Pepperdine and USC, play 5 of their first 6 conference matches on 
the road. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge plays its first home match Friday against sixth-ranked Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
"In this conference it's imperative that you win your home matches," Northridge 
Coach John Price said. "The schedule will even out for us by the middle of the 
season. But we need to win at least two of our first six matches." 
</P>
<P>
Whistle while he works: It's bound to happen. Brett Dennis will be walking down 
the street, hear a shrill whistle, turn to an imaginary scorer's table and 
sheepishly raise his hand. Tea kettles and tiny birds will haunt him. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis, a 6-0 forward on the Occidental basketball team, seemingly collects 
fouls faster than points. 
</P>
<P>
Because he is considerably shorter than most of the players he guards, Dennis 
often has to rely on muscle to compensate. 
</P>
<P>
"Anytime Brett's in the building he's going to get called for the foul," said 
assistant Jim Kerman, adding Dennis often gets assessed for committing a 
pay-back foul. "It's the Kurt Rambis syndrome." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the afternoon of bodysurfing Dennis spent with the ex-Laker rubbed off. 
Dennis met Rambis in La Jolla a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Impact player: It took a while, but senior center Doug Friedman is finally 
making an impact for the Westmont College basketball team. The former Thousand 
Oaks High player is averaging 7.8 points. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the reasons we have won so many games lately is because of the improved 
play of Doug," Coach Chet Kammerer said.

CSUN SOFTBALL TEAM BEATS UNLV BEFORE LOSING TO THE RAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH NICHOLS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For Coach Gary Torgeson, the Tournament of Champions offers an opportunity to 
see how his Cal State Northridge softball team will fare against Division I 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
Torgeson did not get much of a chance to preview the Lady Matadors on Friday, 
however, after CSUN's afternoon game against Sacramento State was rained out. 
</P>
<P>
In CSUN's morning game, pitcher Debbie Dickmann threw a 2-hit shutout to lead 
the host team to a 1-0 victory over Nevada Las Vegas in 8 innings. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not out here to lose, but I was actually more concerned with getting 
some games played so I could get a look at our personnel," Torgeson said. 
</P>
<P>
The coach liked what he saw against UNLV, especially the strong effort of 
Dickmann, a Division II All-American who was 22-4 with 17 shutouts last season. 
Dickmann allowed just 2 singles. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Erickson scored the only run in the eighth. She reached base on a bunt 
single, advanced on another, then scored on a wild throw after a fielder's 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
The Lady Matadors will play San Diego State this morning unless rain forces 
another cancellation. Only six of 12 games were completed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Lady Matadors will play San Francisco in a second game this afternoon.

LINCOLN COMEBACK CATCHES SAN DIEGO

<P>
As the fourth quarter progressed Friday night, and No. 2 Lincoln lurched ever 
closer toward its second loss of the season, Ron Loneski, the green-jacketed 
Hornet coach, leaned toward assistant Hosea Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to win," Loneski proclaimed with his team down by 9. 
</P>
<P>
With 19 seconds to play, the score tied and pandemonium suffocating the steamy 
San Diego High School gym, Loneski sat quietly on the bench, hands folded on 
his lap. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Temple made one of two free throws, giving Lincoln its first lead of the 
second half, 69-68. 
</P>
<P>
When San Diego's Clark Jones missed a short jumper with 5 seconds left, it was 
a final. 
</P>
<P>
"We needed to see how we play under pressure," Loneski said after the City 
Central League victory, which improved Lincoln to 21-1 and 6-0. "The kids kept 
their poise." 
</P>
<P>
The test began when Aaron Wilhite, 6-feet-8, fouled out with 5:32 to play, 
leaving a gaping hole in Lincoln's middle. San Diego was up by four at the 
time, 59-55. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavers led by as much as eight, 67-59, with 3:00 remaining. Then came a 
fierce Lincoln press -- and the true meaning of pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Loneski changed from a full-court zone press to a man-to-man, and as their lead 
dwindled, the Cavers consistently had trouble getting the ball upcourt. San 
Diego turned the ball over four consecutive times and watched Lincoln score 10 
of the next 11 points. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost our composure," San Diego Coach Dennis Kane said. "When it came crunch 
time, they executed, and we didn't." 
</P>
<P>
One freeze-frameable moment: 2:08 left, San Diego ahead, 68-67, and searching 
blindly for the kill. After a scramble for a rebound, Raynard Wells picked up 
the ball and started a length-of-the-court fast break. He passed to sophomore 
J.R. Greer, who went for the dunk, missed and then was hit with a technical 
foul for hanging on the rim. Temple made the free throw to tie it. 
</P>
<P>
Temple, who finished with 29 points and 9 rebounds, almost single-handedly led 
Lincoln in the fourth quarter. He scored 12 points and had 5 rebounds, 
including 10 of Lincoln's final 12. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach said I had to be the man when Aaron fouled out," Temple said. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln charged ahead, 13-4, early in the first quarter, but San Diego scored 
17 of the next 21 points take a 21-17 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavers made a blistering 10 of 13 field goals in the second quarter, 
including three 3-pointers from Wells, who finished the first half with 20 
points, scoring 17 in the second quarter alone. He managed just five in the 
second half, none in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Andre Letchaw, who finished with 13 points and 12 rebounds, carried San Diego 
(13-4, 4-2) in the third quarter with five rebounds, and Clark Jones scored 
nine of San Diego's 13 in the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Wilhite scored 17 points and had 11 rebounds for Lincoln before fouling out, 
and guard John McCartney had 15 points.

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: WAGNER RETURNS, IS REINSTATED BY THE AZTECS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In what might conclude the saga of running back Darrin Wagner, San Diego State 
Coach Al Luginbill announced Friday that Wagner will not transfer to Nebraska 
and has been reinstated by the Aztecs. 
</P>
<P>
Wagner quit SDSU in November, and Nebraska Coach Tom Osborne said in statements 
that he would be welcomed as a walk-on. Wagner was The Times' 1987 San Diego 
County back of the year for Lincoln but did not play for the Aztecs as a 
freshman. 
</P>
<P>
According to Luginbill, Wagner returns to the team under certain restrictions 
and will redshirt in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"Darrin just needed to find out for himself that he had a good situation here 
at San Diego State," Luginbill said. "But he is still on scholarship, and we're 
very happy to have him back. As far as I'm concerned, this case is closed." 
</P>
<P>
Wagner said he was hesitant to go to Nebraska and was listening to what other 
people were telling him. "I'm just more comfortable at San Diego State," he 
said. "This is my hometown, and this program is a Division I program that's 
headed in the right direction. I want to be a part of it." 
</P>
<P>
Raymond Thompson, Crawford High School offensive lineman, has verbally 
committed to play football at Weber State. 
</P>
<P>
At Crawford, the 6-foot-2, 239-pound nose guard, was named to the All-State 
Cal-Hi Sports team and All-City Central League first team. 
</P>
<P>
MEN'S BASKETBALL 
</P>
<P>
Cal State San Bernardino overcame a 13-point second-half deficit with a 12-0 
run midway through the second half to defeat UC San Diego, 96-89, at Triton 
Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman Rick Batt, starting for the first time in place of injured center 
Gordon McNeill, had 36 points on 15 of 22 shooting and 13 rebounds. UCSD (7-14) 
led, 48-40, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
CS San Bernardino (15-5) made all 20 of its second-half free throw attempts and 
25 of 26. Gerald Duncan led CSSB with 33 points and Dave Webb added 21. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Beth Koenig scored a career high 22 points and point guard Nancy Caparaz had 11 
points, 10 rebounds and 9 steals as UC San Diego defeated Cal State San 
Bernardino, 91-74, at Triton Pavilion. 
</P>

NUMBERS DON'T LIE: AZTECS FACING TROUBLE AT AIR FORCE TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The numbers, once simply depressing, are becoming staggering for the San Diego 
State men's basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs have lost six of the past seven games and six of the past seven road 
games. They have lost 22 of the past 23 Western Athletic Conference road games, 
and are 0-4 on WAC trips this season. 
</P>
<P>
And today, at noon, they play at Air Force in Colorado Springs. 
</P>
<P>
That's the same Air Force team SDSU defeated, 64-61, in the San Diego Sports 
Arena on Jan. 7. But it's also the same Air Force team that now has won four in 
a row -- including three on the road. To say the Falcons are playing their best 
of the season would be, in the words of Coach Reggie Minton, "a fair 
appraisal." 
</P>
<P>
Said Minton: "Anytime you win three consecutive WAC road games, chances are 
you're playing pretty good. We've been playing very well as of late. Actually, 
we've played pretty well and worked hard throughout the year, but we're just 
now getting some breaks." 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force offense is designed to get the ball into the hands of 6-foot 
junior guard Raymond Dudley, who scored 31 points in an 86-79 victory over 
Hawaii earlier this week. Dudley is fourth in the nation in scoring at 27 
points a game. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a rare talent," Minton said. "He's one of the premier players in our 
league." 
</P>
<P>
Minton felt his team had a letdown in the final 7 minutes of the first half in 
its first game against SDSU this season. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have patience or execute in those 7 minutes," Minton said. "From 
that point on, we were chasing them and not in our rhythm." 
</P>
<P>
SDSU hasn't had much rhythm in a month. Since the Jan. 7 victory over Air 
Force, the Aztecs have won once -- 69-61 Monday over Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
But Thursday's 67-47 loss to Colorado State -- a team SDSU had beaten earlier 
this season, 62-57 -- was the low point of the season. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs shot just 41% (19 of 46) from the floor and 39% (5 of 13) from the 
free throw line in their worst defeat of the year. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU center Mitch McMullen, who leads the team with 14.7 points a game and 7.8 
rebounds, was limited to just 15 minutes against CSU because of a sore left 
Achilles tendon. 
</P>
<P>
Said Minton: "I respect every team in this league, and any team Jim Brandenburg 
coaches will be well-prepared and come out and play hard."

BORDER PATROL TO INVESTIGATE ALLEGATION THAT AGENT HARASSED LEGAL ALIEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Border Patrol officials said Friday that they will investigate allegations by a 
Salvadoran alien who said that two agents detained him more than two hours and 
tore up documents that allow him to remain legally in this country pending a 
ruling on his petition for asylum. 
</P>
<P>
Rutilio Alfredo Fuentes Sanchez, 25, said that Agent J. O. Nelson and an 
unidentified officer arrested him on the morning of Jan. 25, while he was 
standing beside a flower stand on El Camino Real in Encinitas with several 
other men. According to Fuentes and other aliens who witnessed the incident, 
Nelson and his partner, a Latino agent, appeared to single him out and forced 
him inside a Border Patrol vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Several witnesses, including Fuentes' father, Silvestre Coca, said that Fuentes 
tried to show agents a copy of his petition for asylum and asked them not to 
arrest him. The agents ignored the document and drove him around for more than 
two hours before stopping in a remote, hilly area that he did not recognize, 
Fuentes said. 
</P>
<P>
"They took me out of the vehicle and Nelson grabbed me by the shirt and threw 
me to the ground," Fuentes said. "I landed on my knees and took the immigration 
papers out of my pocket to show to them. Nelson grabbed the document and tore 
it up without looking at it. He said: 'This piece of paper is no good.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Agents Sped Off 
</P>
<P>
The agents then got inside the vehicle and sped off, leaving him on the ground, 
Fuentes said. Minutes after the agents left, "four cholos" robbed him of $300 
at knifepoint, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for attorney George Siddell, who is representing Fuentes and his 
father, who has also petitioned for asylum, said that Fuentes reported the 
incident to them. The spokesman, who requested anonymity, said he took Fuentes 
to an Immigration and Naturalization Service case worker to explain the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
The INS official gave Fuentes a new copy of his petition, which states that he 
is allowed to remain in this country pending a decision on his case, said 
Siddell's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Fuentes, who served in the Salvadoran military for three years, entered the 
United States illegally on Aug. 16, 1988, and applied for asylum on Oct. 27, 
stating that he feared that he would be killed by leftist guerrillas if he 
returned home. 
</P>
<P>
Border Patrol Assistant Chief Armand Olvera said his office will refer Fuentes' 
complaints to the INS Office of Professional Responsibility, which investigates 
reports of misconduct by agents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Kind of Action Not Condoned 
</P>
<P>
"We know nothing about this incident. We have turned this information over to 
the Office of Professional Responsibility for investigation. We don't condone 
this type of action," Olvera said. 
</P>
<P>
Olvera was asked to make Nelson available for comment, but the agent could not 
be reached. 
</P>
<P>
Fuentes alleged that the harassment by Nelson continued this week. On Tuesday, 
while Fuentes was waiting at the same site for employment offers, Nelson and 
another unidentified agent, whom witnesses again described as Latino, heaped 
obscenities on him again, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Witness accounts of the incident said that, even after Nelson returned to his 
vehicle, the unidentified agent continued to shout obscenities at Fuentes. 
</P>
<P>
"I finally got mad and told him that I was going to sue him and Nelson," 
Fuentes said. "He stepped real close to my face and told me that a judge would 
never believe anything I said, and that he had the power to send me to jail for 
one year." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wrote Name, License Number 
</P>
<P>
The confrontation ended there, Fuentes said. During the shouting match, Fuentes 
wrote down Nelson's name and the license number of the vehicle the agents were 
driving, but he failed to note the other agent's name. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Border Patrol officials have not officially denied that such 
incidents occur. But officials frequently respond that no record of the 
incident has been made by agents. The officials have also said that it is 
impossible to verify an incident without the name of the agent or agents 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
The difference in Fuentes' allegations is that he has provided the name of the 
agent involved and the license number of the vehicle he was in. On Friday, 
Chief Olvera said that Border Patrol officials had no record of the incident 
but would investigate. 
</P>
<P>
In November, a coalition of immigrant rights groups sued the INS, charging that 
U. S. border agents have illegally seized and destroyed immigration documents 
belonging to hundreds of aliens who are trying to legalize their status in this 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Roberto Martinez, an activist who heads the U. S.-Mexico border project for the 
American Friends Service Committee, said aliens frequently complain about 
Border Patrol agents who seize and destroy their documents. 
</P>
<P>
"This shows the pattern and practice of the Border Patrol in the way they 
enforce our immigration laws. They are completely ignoring the rights of people 
who are amnesty candidates, and who have legal authorization to be here," 
Martinez said.

POLICE PROBING ROBBERIES OF INDOCHINESE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAWN MAREE SMITH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Police Department is investigating a series of brutal robberies of 
Indochinese residents in Southeast San Diego, including the shooting death of a 
man this week, but have not yet determined whether they are linked. 
</P>
<P>
The robberies, which police believe have been committed by a group or groups of 
young Asians, have been characterized by demands for gold and the ransacking of 
the victims' houses. 
</P>
<P>
"There is that possibility" that the robberies are linked, homicide Detective 
Bob Lopez said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Although several residential robberies by young Asian males have occurred, 
Lopez said, he is wary of attributing the incidents to gang members. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It's Hard to Tell' 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't seen anything that would indicate that they would be gang members," 
Lopez said. "Traditional gangs -- Hispanics and blacks -- wear colors, but 
Asian gangs are difficult to pinpoint and identify. It's hard to tell that they 
are gang members, because they don't have the traditional markings that 
Hispanic and black gangs have." 
</P>
<P>
The most recent residential robbery occurred Thursday night and ended in the 
shooting death of Huy Tinh Le, 42, who lived in the 4100 block of Polk Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The three thieves, who were dressed in black, knocked at the victim's door 
about 8:30 and forced their way into the home, police said. Armed with handguns 
and knives, the assailants demanded money and gold and ransacked the house. 
During the robbery, the thieves, in their late teens or early twenties, shot Le 
several times, and he died almost immediately, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The bandits fled, but no vehicle was seen or heard. Other members of the 
Vietnamese family witnessed the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Turned Into a Murder' 
</P>
<P>
Lopez believes the incident "was just a residential robbery that turned into a 
murder." 
</P>
<P>
In another incident, a Vietnamese couple was robbed in the 2600 block of Gerald 
Court on Jan. 19. Authorities received a call at 2 p.m. that a woman was 
screaming for help, according to police spokesman Bill Robinson. When officers 
arrived, the victims told them they had been robbed by four Vietnamese gunmen 
who tied them up and blindfolded them. The thieves, demanding gold, ransacked 
their house, destroyed furniture and took $400 to $500 in cash. 
</P>
<P>
The woman told police that, during the robbery, one assailant held a knife to 
her throat, cutting her slightly, and that her husband was kicked during the 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
On the afternoon of Jan. 11, a Laotian woman in her yard in the 4200 block of 
Thorn Street in Southeast San Diego was approached by three Vietnamese men, who 
forced her at gunpoint to join her family inside the house, which they then 
ransacked, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, they threatened the family by picking up a baby, saying they would 
throw it to the floor if the family did not cooperate. An older relative tried 
to protect the baby when they put it back down, and she was kicked in the face 
and chest. 
</P>
<P>
The family was made to lie on a bed covered with a blanket while the men 
ransacked the house for money. The thieves stole equipment and credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Carl Campo said the similarities are not enough to establish a link 
between the robberies.

<P>
A man accused of shooting his mother-in-law in a Clairemont doughnut shop 
pleaded not guilty to a murder charge Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Geering, 36, previously was charged with attempted murder in the Sunday 
shooting of Audrey Erbe, 59, but the charge was amended when she died 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Erbe was shot just above the eye and was in a coma for several days. 
</P>
<P>
Geering's estranged wife, Diane Geering, was also at the doughnut shop, but hid 
in the bathroom when she saw Geering in the shop with a gun, Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Greg McClain said. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Municipal Judge Raymond Edwards Jr. rescheduled the preliminary 
hearing for March 2. He allowed the $200,000 bail to continue, even though the 
charge was amended. 
</P>
<P>
McClain said Geering had assaulted his ex-wife several times before the 
shooting.

<P>
The Centre City Development Corp., the city agency in charge of downtown San 
Diego's redevelopment, decided Friday to withdraw a recommendation to increase 
densities on three blocks near the waterfront. 
</P>
<P>
The decision delays for now a proposal by Torrey Enterprises, which wanted to 
build a skyscraper 500 feet tall on one of the blocks. The tallest building 
allowed on the block will remain at about 20 stories, or about 200 feet. 
</P>
<P>
A majority of the CCDC board of directors said any decision on increasing 
densities will have to wait until the Navy completes a more detailed plan for 
development of its property. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy has plans for a massive reconstruction of its property, consisting of 
eight blocks between Pacific Highway and Harbor Drive, south of Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy's land is next to the block on which Torrey Enterprises wants to 
build, and CCDC is concerned about increasing densities and height in the 
absence of more details about the Navy's preliminary plans, still several 
months from completion. 
</P>
<P>
Torrey Enterprises recently announced plans to build a $90-million, 39-story 
office and residential high-rise on the southeast block of Pacific Coast 
Highway and E Street.

ELBOW ROOM IN EAST EUROPE; 
</P>
<P>
SOVIET ALLIES, YES, BUT NO LONGER FAITHFUL SERVANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES GATI, Charles Gati is a professor of political science at Union 
College and a senior research scholar at Columbia University's Research 
Institute on International Change. This is adapted from an article in the 
America and the World 1988/89 issue of Foreign Affairs. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Today the winds of change blow from the Soviet Union to Eastern Europe and not 
the other way around -- and most East European regimes, making use of their 
newly granted if still limited autonomy, are dissociating themselves from 
Mikhail Gorbachev's policies of reform. Most are, in fact, united against 
almost everything he stands for, and they are unwilling to follow his example. 
</P>
<P>
With only Hungary and Poland backing Gorbachev, and emulating especially his 
policy of glasnost, the region's old diversity is thus turning into a new 
political schism. The emerging rift lacks the decisiveness and vindictiveness 
of earlier disputes, like the Soviet-Yugoslav conflict of 1948-49 or the 
Sino-Soviet split of the 1960s. Indeed, Moscow may yet restore a greater 
measure of unity in Eastern Europe by masterminding the replacement of its 
orthodox opponents, or by slowing down its reformist supporters, or both. But 
now there is an unprecedented standoff between the East European "Gang of Four" 
(Romania, East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria) on the one hand and 
Hungary and Poland (and the Soviet Union) on the other. It is truly a standoff, 
because so long as the East European guardians of orthodoxy can convincingly 
argue that reforms would undermine their countries' fragile stability, there is 
little that Gorbachev can do -- or would want to do -- to impose his policies 
and preferences. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Bloc in 1989, then, is but a shadow of its former self. It is a 
military alliance whose members maintain extensive, but not always beneficial, 
economic ties. Their ideological orientations, and certain of their political 
interests, diverge. Romania, East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria defy 
Moscow and continue to seek only to "perfect" their harsh rule. Supporting and 
supported by Moscow, Hungary declares its interest in the adoption of a 
multiparty system, and Poland may yet come to terms with labor-union pluralism. 
</P>
<P>
What are the implications of these contradictory, tentative, still reversible 
but in some cases very promising trends? Does Gorbachev have a new policy 
toward Eastern Europe? 
</P>
<P>
In examining Soviet intentions, it is useful to begin with the obvious: 
Gorbachev is a reformer, not a revolutionary. Whatever his ultimate impact may 
be, he does not seek to liquidate the Soviet hold on Eastern Europe; it is, 
after all, the most significant and the most tangible achievement of Soviet 
foreign policy. Gorbachev may bend -- he is bending -- but he will not break. 
The evolution of Eastern Europe from a Soviet sphere of domination to a sphere 
of influence may yet take place -- fitfully, the process of decompression and 
even retrenchment has begun -- but not because Moscow is ceding its "front 
yard." The Soviet role is becoming less domineering and more paternalistic, 
because to continue the old policy of heavy-handed Soviet rule would have 
deleterious consequences for Gorbachev's domestic and foreign-policy 
priorities. 
</P>
<P>
Still, a cloud of uncertainty hangs over Soviet intentions. On the one hand, 
Gorbachev still approves of past Soviet interventions and he still speaks of 
protecting the region's "common interests." On the other hand, East European 
officials trying to interpret Soviet policy no longer take it for granted that, 
in a crisis, they should either expect or count on Moscow's "fraternal 
assistance." They believe that there are conclusive signs of a growing Soviet 
reluctance to offer such "assistance": Gorbachev's withdrawal from Afghanistan 
and his promise to reduce Soviet commitments elsewhere in the Third World, his 
patience toward centrifugal tendencies in the Soviet Union, the stress he 
places on the autonomy of the East European Communist parties, his plan to 
begin thinning out Soviet forces in the region, and his subordinates' repeated 
assurance that the Brezhnev Doctrine of restricted East European sovereignty is 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's policies also reflect the ambiguity inherent in Moscow's current 
position in Eastern Europe. For example, several recent decisions concerning 
personnel changes in the East European regimes were apparently permitted to be 
made mainly on the scene, and only partly in Moscow. While the removal in 
December, 1987, of the old Brezhnevite party chief of Czechoslovakia, Gustav 
Husak, was in line with Soviet expectations and suggestions, his replacement by 
a younger and more vigorous Brezhnevite, Milos Jakes, was a decision made in 
Prague. In Hungary, too, the replacement of Janos Kadar by Karoly Grosz in May, 
1988, was congruent with Soviet signals, but the wholesale expulsion of eight 
of the old Politburo's 13 members was accomplished at a party conference in 
what amounted to a local conspiracy against Kadar's associates. Produced by 
secret ballot, the eventual outcome took everyone, including the Soviets, by 
surprise. 
</P>
<P>
How Soviet leaders treat their East European colleagues behind the scenes is, 
of course, largely a matter of rumor and speculation. While Soviet officials 
claim that "a good example is the best sermon," East European officials say 
that although their Soviet counterparts show considerable flexibility both at 
bilateral and multilateral meetings, they are still tough and demanding, 
especially on economic issues. Nevertheless, during a private conversation in 
his office last October, Karoly Grosz told me that it was no longer either 
necessary or customary to ask for Moscow's "permission" before undertaking a 
new initiative. He said that recently, before making a particularly difficult 
decision, he had called Gorbachev and asked for his "opinion." The answer was 
that Grosz should be "guided by his conscience." 
</P>
<P>
The East European leaders have obtained considerable elbow room, even if their 
growing autonomy is still circumscribed by their perception of geopolitical 
realities, by the extent of their countries' economic dependence on the Soviet 
Union and by their knowledge that the political survival of the region's 
one-party systems ultimately still depends on Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
What, then, can be made of Gorbachev's more paternalistic approach to Eastern 
Europe? Clearly, Soviet hegemony is not giving way to full respect for the 
principles of sovereignty and noninterference. There are circumstances that 
would prompt Moscow to resort to the use of force on behalf of its geopolitical 
-- if not ideological -- interests, claiming that the Warsaw Pact's common 
interests were threatened. Indeed, the important question is not whether the 
Brezhnev Doctrine is alive or dead. Even if it were declared null and void, 
East Europeans would remain uncertain and skeptical. The more realistic 
questions are these: To what extent has the threshold of Soviet tolerance 
changed? How far can an East European country go without inviting Soviet 
military intervention? 
</P>
<P>
One answer is that as long as a given East European country remains in the 
Warsaw Pact and accepts socialism, there will be no intervention. A second 
answer is that the Soviet threshold of tolerance is higher for the region's 
small and strategically insignificant countries (Bulgaria, Romania and Hungary) 
than it is for East Germany, Poland and Czechoslovakia. The third -- and safest 
-- answer is that only if an upheaval occurs will Gorbachev know and decide 
what to do, and therefore the outside world cannot know in advance either. 
</P>
<P>
Absent upheavals, there are two important differences between the domineering 
Soviet policies of the past and Gorbachev's more paternalistic approach. First, 
in the past Moscow did not hesitate to tell the East European leaders both what 
they should and should not do, issuing imperatives as well as prohibitions. 
Today, Moscow is satisfied with indicating only what they should not do. Within 
the confines of such prohibitions -- against leaving the Warsaw Pact and 
renouncing socialism -- the East European regimes have gained sufficient 
autonomy to decide on their own what sort of economic and even political 
arrangements would suit their circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
Second, Moscow's major preoccupation, even more than in the past, is the 
region's stability, meaning peace and quiet at almost any price. A spontaneous, 
popular upheaval similar to that which engulfed Poland at the beginning of this 
decade is today's Soviet nightmare. Soviet officials know that large-scale East 
European disturbances would weaken and perhaps defeat perestroika and glasnost. 
This is why Gorbachev, fearful of disorder, has shied away from trying to 
dislodge the orthodox leaders of still-quiescent Romania, Bulgaria, 
Czechoslovakia and East Germany. The more idealistic goal of yesteryear -- 
creating a cohesive and viable "socialist commonwealth" -- has been shelved for 
the time being. 
</P>
<P>
Yet even the limited and relatively modest goal of stability remains beyond 
Moscow's reach. Evaluations of the region's economic ills range from serious to 
catastrophic. Hungarian and Polish reformers are uncertain of and divided over 
what to do next, while the anti-reformist contingent skirts trouble in the 
longer run by adhering to the repressive policies of the past. Meanwhile, the 
present mix of Soviet toleration of rigid East European regimes and Gorbachev's 
concurrent calls for dynamic change at home is -- unwittingly -- fueling the 
fire of rapidly growing East European popular demands. The irony, as Zbigniew 
Brzezinski has observed, is that "if the viewpoint that a Soviet military 
intervention is in fact unlikely becomes more widespread (in Eastern Europe), 
this perception might make a revolutionary upheaval more probable." 
</P>
<P>
Hence, the underlying problem is that while Moscow seeks peace and quiet in 
Eastern Europe, the East European peoples feel encouraged by Gorbachev's 
domestic politices and rhetoric to seek change. In fact, so basic is the change 
they propose in some countries that, according to a rudimentary but telling 
survey of public opinion, most East Europeans see even Gorbachev as being 
"good" for the Soviet Union but not good enough for Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The expected regional crisis of the 1990s calls for a bold supplement to 
existing U.S. policy toward Eastern Europe: direct talks with Moscow about the 
region's future. The purpose of such a dialogue would be not to settle but to 
probe; bilateral contact might also pave the way for multilateral discussions. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in four decades, the interests of the two super-powers 
concerning the region's future may have begun to converge in Eastern Europe -- 
and to reflect the aspirations of the Eastern European people as well. 
</P>
<P>
No one would gain from violent East European upheavals that might prompt Soviet 
military intervention and very possibly mark the end of the reform process in 
both Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. By contrast, all sides would gain 
from evolutionary change under stable conditions. 
</P>
<P>
The ultimate purpose should be to shape a zone of peace in Eastern Europe, an 
area that would consist of a group of truly friendly states mindful of 
legitimate Soviet interests. In the end, they would be like neutral Austria or 
Finland, or find an independent and pluralist existence within the Warsaw Pact 
framework. 
</P>
<P>
To bring about such changes, Washington should help fashion a market-oriented 
economic environment in Eastern Europe -- and thus contribute to the region's 
viability and stability at a time of radical change. Moscow should concurrently 
help fashion a pluralist political order in Eastern Europe -- and thus 
contribute to the region's long-term viability and stability. 
</P>
<P>
An understanding along these lines would eliminate the most important legacy of 
the Cold War, give content to Gorbachev's concept of a "common European home," 
facilitate the devolution of the Soviet Empire under peaceful and stable 
conditions and afford Eastern Europe an opportunity to get on its feet and 
stand on its own.

TAKING ON THE GANGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pondering a social problem as complex and as painful as youth gangs tempts many 
Southern Californians simply to turn away in frustration, perhaps on the 
pretext that gangs are the worry of someone else -- the police, the prison 
system or the residents of faraway ghettos and barrios most often victimized by 
gangs. 
</P>
<P>
But denial of the gang problem does not minimize its effect on the whole 
society -- the terrible loss of life in gang violence, the costs of trying to 
control the gangs, and the sense of vulnerability that washes through all 
neighborhoods when random violence occurs, no matter how far away. Clearly 
something must be done. But what? 
</P>
<P>
A useful start would be to define the problem better. Too often people think of 
"gangs" as a monolith. Even the press lapses into oversimplification at times. 
The result is a pointless debate among groups that think they've got the 
solution to the problem. They focus on some police strategy, an education 
program or even a social ill (single-parent families, drugs or joblessness, 
etc.) whose elimination would resolve everything. In fact, solving the problems 
that gangs cause will require many different approaches, no one of them likely 
to be effective in every case. Once over this hurdle, it is easier to avoid 
frustration at the persistence of gangs and to concentrate on dealing with 
them. 
</P>
<P>
For example, one good result of the widespread concern over local street gangs 
is improved coordination among various law-enforcement agencies. Communication 
about gangs among the Los Angeles Police Department, the county sheriff, the 
district attorney and the Probation Department is better today than ever. The 
local agencies, in turn, keep in better contact with state agencies like the 
Department of Corrections and California Youth Authority. Even federal 
agencies, including the U.S. attorney's office and the FBI, now join in 
anti-gang activity when the need arises. Such cooperation must improve even 
more. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County and other jurisdictions must also keep supporting innovative 
programs like the Community Youth Gang Services Project, whose street 
counselors keep tabs on youth-gang activity and try to prevent violence. The 
key to their effectiveness is that most project workers are themselves former 
gang members, with knowledge and insights about gangs that are practical and 
useful. They do not pretend that gangs can quickly or easily be abolished; they 
simply try to limit the damage that gangs do. That is an important place to 
start dealing with the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Another way for state and federal governments to limit the damage that gangs do 
is to further strengthen gun-control laws. In particular, they must not lose 
the opportunity -- created by public outrage over the recent schoolyard 
killings in Stockton -- to ban the sale of automatic combat weapons like the 
AK-47. Easy access to such high-powered weapons makes today's street gangs much 
more deadly than their predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
In the long run, government at all levels must revise the strategy being used 
to stem the flow of illegal narcotics into this country, especially the cheap 
rock cocaine known as crack. The high profits from crack are major contributors 
to gang violence as rival groups battle to control the market just as 
bootleggers fought each other in the 1920s over liquor sales. Police who try to 
stem to flow of narcotics to this country's streets do a courageous and 
commendable job. But they will be fighting a war that they cannot win until the 
demand for illegal narcotics slows or dries up. That can happen only if more 
money is put into treatment programs to help addicts and education programs to 
persuade people to stay away from illegal drugs in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
Most proposals for dealing with gangs involve police action, but it would be 
folly to think that a complex problem like gangs can be solved just by tougher 
law enforcement. The social ills that lead or drive young people into gangs 
must be attacked, too. As this country learned from its experience with the War 
on Poverty in the 1960s, such efforts can be costly and controversial. 
</P>
<P>
It became fashionable in the anti-government heyday of the Reagan 
Administration to question the effectiveness of government spending on social 
programs. Some were inefficient, even wasteful, but many others did a great 
deal of good. Even the Defense Department is wasteful and inefficient at times, 
but no one seriously suggests dismantling the nation's defense system as a 
result. By the same token, it is shortsighted to dismantle all social programs 
that help preserve tranquility. 
</P>
<P>
As part of solving the "gang problem," taxpayers must spend more for education, 
especially of youngsters from poor families so that they stay in school at 
least through high-school graduation. The fewer dropouts on the streets, the 
fewer young people for gangs to recruit. Even critics of the War on Poverty 
concede the value of education programs like Head Start. 
</P>
<P>
For young people who have already dropped out of school, more job-training 
programs must be created to prepare them for meaningful, productive careers. 
Again, the War on Poverty provides a successful model in the Job Corps program. 
The programs should focus on helping a particularly vulnerable group -- single 
mothers trying to keep their families intact. By helping them raise healthy and

No single answer to the gang problem is likely to work in every instance. Youth 
gangs, and the more sophisticated adult gangs that grow out of them, are likely 
to persist in some form or other no matter what is done to control them. But 
that is no argument for not trying. Los Angeles has made a start in dealing 
with gangs as a crime problem. But that is just treating the symptom. The 
illness will be cured when American society decides that eliminating the social 
problems that help bring youth gangs into existence is just as important.

SERIAL KILLER BUNDY'S EXECUTION AND DEATH PENALTY CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What does Ernest van den Haag mean by a "net gain in justice" to be found in 
the executions of 23 of the 350 Americans wrongfully sentenced to death from 
1900 to 1985? 
</P>
<P>
He must know that a system that mistakenly executes some of the innocent will 
also fail to punish some of the guilty (and not only those whose places are 
taken by the innocent). The blanket application of the death penalty does not 
ensure an increase in the number of criminals who will be caught and punished 
for capital crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Van den Haag's "net gain in justice" really means nothing more than relief for 
his own frustration with the knowledge that, without the death penalty, heinous 
criminals will not be executed. The "very acceptable" execution of the innocent 
along with the guilty translates as "any eye for an eye, any tooth for a tooth" 
here. But what does satisfying Van den Haag's emotional needs have to do with 
justice? 
</P>
<P>
I can almost hear recently executed serial killer Ted Bundy's own words, as if 
in approval: "It shouldn't be a problem. What's one less person on the face of 
the earth, anyway?" (Part I, Jan. 25).

DIGGING A DITCH AT THE BORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Building a ditch to exclude "undesirables" is not a new idea. For example, the 
Romans often constructed an elaborate ditch and rampant (vallum) even going so 
far to ring a whole city (circumvallation) in order to starve its inhabitants. 
Hadrian's Wall, crossing Britain for 70 miles to connect the current sites of 
Carlisle and Newcastle-upon-Tyne, was intended to stop incursions by the Picts 
and the Scots. That wall was usually paralleled on its "friendly" side by a 
substantial vallum. 
</P>
<P>
Does that strategy work? I recently spent a year in Durham, 20 miles south of 
Hadrian's Wall. Never during that time was I molested by a marauding Pict.

McCarthy tells of 23 wrongful executions, and how many people find that 
acceptable. It horrifies me, and I am ashamed for our country. 
</P>
<P>
Doesn't anyone else remember civics classes which taught "innocent until proven 
guilty," and "the burden of proof is on the prosecution," and "better that 100 
criminals go free than that one innocent person is convicted"? I remember how 
proud I was to learn that our justice system honored those exacting rules. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't just me. Everyone I knew really believed in those precepts. When did 
that change? 
</P>
<P>
Today, anyone speaking up for such ideals is ridiculed as "soft on crime" and 
as "caring more about the rights of the criminal than the rights of the 
victim." 
</P>
<P>
No one sees any distinction between "accused" and "guilty" when it comes to 
violent crimes; instead anyone charged with a violent crime is labeled a 
criminal. The general public and, of course, all politicians, have joined the 
prosecutors and police in decrying rules which protect the accused. 
</P>
<P>
When did it change?

How about a special tax on banking executives who make imprudent investment

Our politicians and business leaders should stop putting burdens on wage

In just one week President Bush has managed to (1) exacerbate the conflict

savings and loan depositors, and (3) endorse a 50% pay hike for Congress 
despite opposition by a majority of Americans.

SERIAL KILLER BUNDY'S EXECUTION AND DEATH PENALTY CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
What led Bundy on his murderous rampage, where up to 100 unsuspecting, young 
women may have been his victims? Pornography? The thrill of danger? The feeling 
of total power and domination over someone? I doubt it. 
</P>
<P>
Bundy was a freak of nature, a mutation, a "bad seed." He was literally a 
"killing machine," born to murder, like those creatures in "Alien." No amount 
of counseling or love or psychological therapy could have prevented his brutal 
acts, as how can you cure a person with no conscience? In fact, contrary to 
being abused or deprived, he had all the advantages life could offer: good 
looks, a charming personality, a college education, a loving family 
environment. So where did Bundy go wrong? 
</P>
<P>
The fact is, he didn't go wrong, he was just born a time bomb destined at some 
point in time to explode. There was no way his acts could have been prevented. 
The only way to stop monsters like Ted Bundy is the old fashioned way: the 
death penalty.

For a few, brief moments I thought I might have voted for the wrong candidate 
in November. Then, our new President, exhibiting the high moral and ethical 
tone he wants his Administration to set, said that deposits in savings and loan 
associations "are backed by the full faith and credit of the government, and 
they are sound, they are good." Then, to prove that he meant what he said, Bush 
added that he found nothing wrong with considering having depositors foot the 
bill for bailing out the savings and loan industry. 
</P>
<P>
If not immoral or unethical, the President's remarks are, I suggest, those of a 
hypocrite.

DIGGING A DITCH AT THE BORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The silly season has just begun: The report from Washington officials to build 
a four-mile ditch at the border as a solution to the illegal immigration and 
drug trafficking problems ("U.S. Plans to Dig 4-Mile Ditch at Mexican Border," 
Part I, Jan. 25). 
</P>
<P>
A four-mile ditch here, a four-mile ditch there. Where will it end? Let us be 
realistic! Why not build a great wall around the United States! I say, put that 
ditch in Washington, D.C. There are more drugs and money laundering in 
Washington than in any other part of the country. Of course, those people there 
are more honest and the business of drugs is more legitimate. 
</P>
<P>
Building that ditch is like putting obstacles to thwart the red "sockeye" 
salmon from reaching their spawning grounds. Or, like using a net to trap all 
those King Monarch butterflies from coming to the California forest for the 
summer.

SERIAL KILLER BUNDY'S EXECUTION AND DEATH PENALTY CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My gratitude to Colman McCarthy ("Falsely Convicted but Truly Dead," Op-Ed 
Page, Jan. 24)) for discussing the most unequivocal argument against the death 
penalty -- the unfortunate execution of those wrongly convicted. 
</P>
<P>
In the column he quotes Ernest van den Haag as saying that the 23 executions of 
innocent people is "a very acceptable number." Why is it not acceptable for an 
individual to kill an innocent person while the government is allowed to 
perform the same tragic act time after time? The only acceptable number is 
zero, and as long as the justice system is capable of error the death penalty 
must be considered an immoral act. 
</P>
<P>
The only successful argument for the death penalty is specific deterrence -- 
those executed will not kill again. The same can be accomplished, however, by 
simply keeping these people locked up forever. 
</P>
<P>
I don't want anyone to get the idea that I condone the acts of mass murderers 
-- I feel that those with no possibility of rehabilitation should remain in 
jail for life. I merely feel that only vengeance, not justice, is served by 
execution, and that we cannot allow this unjust system to endure.

DRIVER OF TRUCK THAT HIT 2 HOMES SURRENDERS, IS FREED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The driver of a tractor-trailer that ran off the Hollywood Freeway and struck 
two houses turned himself in to authorities Friday, three days after the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
California Highway Patrol Officer Jim Young said Reginald Davis, 31, of 
Hawthorne, who is under investigation for leaving the scene of an accident and 
driving with a suspended license, was not arrested and was released after he 
gave a statement about the accident. 
</P>
<P>
The CHP also said that he was not the driver listed on the truck's documents 
and that the company did not check the status of his license, according to 
Officer Jeff Harman. 
</P>
<P>
Peggy Caley, president of J. Cal Transportation, which owns the truck, said the 
Lakewood company did not have time to check Davis' record with the state 
Department of Motor Vehicles because he was hired at the last minute over the 
weekend when the regular driver got sick. 
</P>
<P>
Davis told authorities that a car hit the truck before the Tuesday night 
accident, causing him to lose control of the vehicle. However, officers who 
were at the accident believe Davis hit an abandoned car parked on the shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he was dazed and confused and wandered off from the crash and that he 
woke up two days later lying in the bushes adjacent to the freeway," Young 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Davis asked a resident of one of the Babcock Avenue houses that had been hit to 
call 911, then disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
Young said the CHP will ask the Los Angeles city attorney's office to file two 
misdemeanor charges against Davis for leaving the scene of an accident and for 
driving without a license. 
</P>
<P>
The DMV reported that Davis had his license suspended in October for driving 
under the influence of alcohol or drugs and that he was holding a chauffeur's 
license, not the truck driver's license required to drive an 18-wheeler.

ASBESTOS REMOVAL CITED; 
</P>
<P>
BURBANK DISTRICT DELAYS RESTRUCTURING OF SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Burbank school board has voted to postpone for a year a plan to establish 
two four-year high schools and scale back elementary schools to kindergarten 
through fifth grades. 
</P>
<P>
The board decided to delay the restructuring, which had been scheduled to begin 
in September, because remodeling of the district's two high schools, Burbank 
and Burroughs, is not scheduled to be completed until February, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Asbestos was discovered in walls and insulation at the schools late last year, 
district officials said. And removing it will cause the remodeling to take 
longer than planned, officials said. The asbestos removal will begin this 
summer, they said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Adding Ninth-Graders 
</P>
<P>
The district is remodeling both schools to accommodate ninth- graders. 
</P>
<P>
Supt. Arthur Pierce said the asbestos does not pose a danger to students or 
teachers at the schools, but it could be a health hazard if it were removed 
while students are in the buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"Parents might be concerned if this asbestos dust were around, so we are taking 
the cautious approach," Pierce said. 
</P>
<P>
Although board members expressed disappointment with the delay, they agreed 
that it was necessary and insisted that the reconfiguration be put in place for 
the 1990-91 school year. 
</P>
<P>
"My disappointment is tempered by the realization that we must do what is best 
for our students," board President Audrey Hanson said. 
</P>
<P>
Parents will be officially notified in a letter that will be sent out soon, 
Pierce said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Parents Not Upset 
</P>
<P>
Jean Andrus, president of the district's PTA Council, a coalition of 
parent-teacher associations, said parents are not upset by the delay. 
</P>
<P>
Under the reconfiguration, the district's three junior high schools -- Jordan, 
Muir and Burbank -- will be turned into middle schools for sixth- to 
eighth-grade students. 
</P>
<P>
The district's about 900 ninth- graders will attend either Burbank or Burroughs 
high schools when the plan is in place. 
</P>
<P>
The restructuring and remodeling will cost about $2 million, officials said. 
Although an exact figure for the asbestos removal has not been determined, 
officials said, it may cost about $375,000. 
</P>
<P>
The plan was proposed three years ago when the district's enrollment was 
dropping. The student population at district schools has stabilized, officials 
said.

COPTER PILOT EN ROUTE TO EXAM SURVIVES REAL-LIFE TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pilot Ed Mauldin was flying to Van Nuys Airport to take a test for his flight 
instructor's certification Friday when his rented helicopter lost power and 
dropped 600 feet to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
In a maneuver called the "full down auto rotation," Mauldin, 36, of Lancaster 
safely landed the craft on a construction site in Panorama City. Uninjured, he 
was driven to Whiteman Airport in Pacoima where he rented another helicopter 
and flew to Van Nuys to take the test. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't pass. 
</P>
<P>
"My nerves were shot," Mauldin said. "My flight test was rescheduled. I took 
the orals and did well but not enough to pass. I'll have to go back on a better 
day." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Flight Test Maneuver 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the full down auto rotation maneuver is included in the flight test 
for instructor certification by the Federal Aviation Administration, Mauldin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe this one will count," he said of the maneuver he used to put down the 
ailing copter. 
</P>
<P>
"He did it, but it will be up to his test instructor" to determine whether the 
maneuver counts toward his certification, FAA investigator Lenny Schaustal 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Mauldin, a commercial helicopter and fixed-wing pilot, said he rented the 
copter at Whiteman. While on the way, an engine problem developed, and the 
craft lost power to its top rotor about 8:30 a.m., he said. 
</P>
<P>
The helicopter started to drop. Mauldin said he used the rotation maneuver, in 
which the craft is pointed forward as it drops, to allow wind to turn the top 
rotor and provide enough lift to glide the craft to a landing. 
</P>
<P>
Mauldin, who had never made an emergency landing, said the copter dropped to 
the ground in about four seconds. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very safe maneuver," he said. "You just have to have a spot to land. It 
is pretty well straight down. You don't have much of a choice of where to go." 
</P>
<P>
Mauldin landed the copter on a lot cleared for a construction project near 
Woodman Avenue and Terra Bella Street. 
</P>
<P>
The helicopter, rented from Watson Helicopters, was not damaged, Schaustal 
said. A preliminary investigation concluded that an engine belt failed, cutting 
off power to the rotor, he said.

GRAND JURY USES NEW U.S. LAW TO INDICT 4 IN DRUG SALES AT PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal grand jury employed a new law for the first time in Los Angeles 
County to indict four men Friday on charges of selling drugs at or near public 
playgrounds or parks. 
</P>
<P>
The new law, passed by Congress in November, 1988, outlines penalties for the 
sale of drugs in or near parks, U.S. Attorney Robert C. Bonner said. It is 
similar to another federal law that outlines penalties for sale of drugs in or 
near schoolyards. Penalties for first-time offenders under both laws range from 
one to 40 years in federal prison, without the possibility of probation or 
parole, Bonner said. 
</P>
<P>
The four men, all Mexican citizens, will not be sent to prison if convicted, 
said Susan Bryant-Deason, assistant U.S. attorney. They will be deported to 
Mexico, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Too many of our parks have become open-air drug bazaars," Bonner said. "The 
message of the new law is: Public parks belong to the public, not to dope 
dealers." 
</P>
<P>
Named in the indictment were Fernando Cedillo, 21; Gabriel Serna, 20; Oscar 
Rizo, 19, and Sergio Esquivel, 19, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The four were arrested on Jan. 25 and charged with selling cocaine to Los 
Angeles undercover officers in the playground area of Lanark Park in Canoga 
Park, said David Dotson, assistant Los Angeles police chief. 
</P>
<P>
Seventy-five people were arrested at the park for narcotics violations in 1988, 
Dotson said. So far this year, 22 narcotics arrests have been made in or near 
the park, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dotson and Bonner spoke at a news conference at the park. They were joined by 
Councilwoman Joy Picus, whose district includes the Canoga Park area. 
</P>
<P>
Picus said she asked police to step up efforts to rid the park of drug dealers 
after receiving numerous complaints from area residents, one of whom described 
the park as a "drive-through drug bar." 
</P>
<P>
"This has been a hot spot in my district for a while," Picus said. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne McCormick, who lives with his family in an apartment complex next to the 
park, said he wrote to Picus complaining about drug sales in the area. 
McCormick, who attended the news conference with his wife, Marty, and 
2-year-old daughter, Bethany, said he has been approached on many occasions by 
drug dealers outside his complex. 
</P>
<P>
Picus said she will ask the City Council on Tuesday to request the Legislature 
to consider legislation similar to the federal law. 
</P>
<P>
Three of those named in the indictment Friday are being held without bail at 
the Metropolitan Detention Center downtown, said Bryant-Deason, who will 
prosecute the case. Bail was set for one of the suspects, who was not 
identified, at $10,000, Bryant-Deason said. 
</P>
<P>
The four are scheduled to be arraigned in U.S. District Court Feb. 13.

JAPAN FORESEES A JOINT GLOBAL ROLE WITH U.S. 
</P>

<P>
For more than 15 years, the United States has been urging Japan to play a 
larger role in world affairs. For nearly as long, Japan has been agreeing that 
it ought to do so. 
</P>
<P>
But Thursday's meeting in Washington between President Bush and Prime Minister 
Noboru Takeshita marked the first time that leaders of the two nations have 
been able to get down to brass tacks on what may be, at last, a new Japanese 
willingness to share some of the world's burdens with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Takeshita, whose nation's aid has been focused on Asia, repeated pledges by 
earlier Japanese leaders to broaden the scope of official economic assistance 
to include Latin America and Africa. He said Japan wants to cooperate with the 
United States in the Middle East. He said he wants to make a regular practice 
of U.S.-Japan policy coordination on issues ranging from relations with the 
Soviet Union to global environment problems. 
</P>
<P>
And, in his remarks to reporters after the meeting, Takeshita called not only 
for cooperation but also for "joint operations" with the United States on 
global issues. 
</P>
<P>
As a Foreign Ministry official accompanying him put it before leaving Tokyo, it 
is increasingly "the Group of 2" -- the United States and Japan -- that 
exercises a decisive influence on world events. 
</P>
<P>
"Our bilateral relationship," he said, "has assumed a global dimension." 
</P>
<P>
Takeshita's declaration of willingness to assume a global responsibility -- 
Bush Administration officials expressed surprise at the forcefulness of the 
message -- represented a growing, but still limited, confidence that has 
emerged in Japan along with its new status as the world's leading creditor 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the past, Japan is now putting its money where formerly only its mouth 
had been. This year, it is expected to surpass the United States as the world's 
No. 1 economic aid donor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Irritated by U.S. Inaction 
</P>
<P>
Takeshita's performance in Washington also came against a background of growing 
irritation among both Japanese officials and business leaders with America's 
seeming inability to cope with its own problems, ranging from narcotics to its 
huge budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
But as viewed through Japanese eyes, it did not amount to a demand for the 
United States to yield a portion of its global leadership. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo on Friday, Chief Cabinet Secretary Keizo Obuchi issued a special 
statement calling the meeting "the start of new cooperation between Japan and 
the United States." But rather than point to new leadership by Japan, Obuchi 
cited Bush's commitment to maintain the United States' position as a global 
power "making efforts for peace, democracy and justice," and said it would be 
Japan's role to support "these American efforts." 
</P>
<P>
As Takeshita told Bush directly, "No country can replace the role of the United 
States. We want America to be strong, to be an ally we can trust most of all." 
</P>
<P>
Japanese reaction was summed up by the Asahi newspaper, which complained in an 
analysis that Takeshita's declarations would "strengthen even further (Japan's) 
complementary role in the global strategy of the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Takeshita also followed the path of his predecessors in failing to propose any 
initiatives of his own, a trait that has irked a series of Washington 
administrations dating back at least to 1973. 
</P>
<P>
In July of that year, then-Secretary of State William P. Rogers astonished 
Japanese officials by publicly praising a rare initiative that Prime Minister 
Kakuei Tanaka had proposed six months earlier, but almost immediately dropped. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers, who had been urging Japan to assume greater responsibility for peace 
and stability in Asia, chose to support Tanaka's abandoned idea for a 
pan-Pacific conference to discuss rehabilitation of the war-ravaged Indochina 
peninsula simply because he wanted to encourage some Japanese initiative, a 
senior U.S. official said at the time. Although already a dead letter, the 
Tanaka idea was the only one he could find, the official explained. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese leaders, particularly former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, have 
tried for years to focus meetings with American leaders on global issues, but 
each time they found themselves overwhelmed with bilateral trade and economic 
disputes. 
</P>
<P>
Only 13 months ago, Takeshita, making his first Washington trip as prime 
minister, pledged to lend $4 billion to Latin America, a region of key interest 
to the United States. Hardly anyone noticed. A shopping list of four specific 
American trade complaints drew all the attention. 
</P>
<P>
Trade took a back seat in the Bush-Takeshita meeting if only because the Bush 
Administration hasn't had time to draw up its own trade agenda with Japan. 
Takeshita's disposal of last year's complaints and a slight reduction in the 
U.S. deficit with Japan in 1988, the first in nine years, also took some of the 
heat out of the trade issue. 
</P>
<P>
From the Japanese view, Takeshita adopted a posture that appeared 
self-effacing. 
</P>
<P>
"It is often said of me that I am slow in reaching decisions, but what I 
promise, I always carry out," Takeshita told Bush. "From now on, I want to 
speed up my decision-making." 
</P>
<P>
That Takeshita even went to Washington struck a note of sankin-kotai -- trips 
of obeisance that daimyo lords paid to shogun leaders during Japan's feudal 
era. A regular session of Parliament, which normally would have convened as 
soon as the government formulated the fiscal 1989 budget, was postponed for 
more than two weeks so that Takeshita could make the trip. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Third World Debt Plan 
</P>
<P>
Takeshita also refrained from reiterating the so-called "Miyazawa plan" for 
solving Third World debt, a rare Japanese initiative that his former Finance 
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa put on the table at the Toronto summit of seven 
leading industrialized nations last summer. Despite the repeated American calls 
for a more active Japanese role in world affairs, U.S. officials rejected 
Miyazawa's proposal out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
Before leaving Tokyo, diplomats who accompanied Takeshita said Japan planned to 
wait to see what new ideas the Bush Administration might propose on the debt 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
A provocative remark on Jan. 25 by Defense Secretary-designate John Tower, who 
condemned as "a lousy idea" the decision to include in Japan's postwar 
constitution a ban on maintaining military forces, was publicly ignored by 
Takeshita. Instead, he assigned his foreign minister, Sosuke Uno, to lodge a 
mild complaint with Secretary of State James A. Baker III. 
</P>
<P>
Tower's statement, Uno said, "caused a big reaction in Japan. Prudence is 
needed in handling how we move forward with cooperation in defense." 
</P>
<P>
It was a far more restrained reaction than could have been expected from the 
U.S. government if a high Japanese official had called a major element of the 
American Constitution "a lousy idea." 
</P>
<P>
And compared with irritations expressed among working-level government 
officials and some businessmen about the persistent American budget deficits, 
Takeshita's reference to that problem could only be described as mild. 
</P>
<P>
"The United States complained about our tariff levels. So we lowered them. Then 
the United States complained about the (yen-dollar) exchange rate. So we 
corrected that. Then, the United States complained about our economic 
structure. So we are changing that," one senior Foreign Ministry official said. 
"Now, it's time for Americans to recognize that something's wrong on their 
side." 
</P>
<P>
As far back as 1973, President Richard M. Nixon, in welcoming Tanaka on a visit 
to Washington, called the United States and Japan "equal partners." Tanaka, 
however, declared that Japan "had no thought whatsoever of standing 
shoulder-to-shoulder with the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Takeshita's performance did not yet bring Japan up to a shoulder-to-shoulder 
level. But it did amount to a declaration of intent to take some of the weight 
off America's back -- in exchange for closer consultations on how the load 
should be handled.

IMPORTING OF GOODS DEBATED;

<P>
SOVIETS GROPE FOR ANSWERS TO CONSUMER SHORTAGES

<TEXT>
<P>
What do you do these days if you're an adviser to the Soviet government and 
find yourself in a direct disagreement with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev? 
</P>
<P>
If you're economist Nikolai Petrakov, and the issue is so important that the 
future of Gorbachev's reform program may depend on it, you start by writing the 
Soviet leader a lengthy memo telling him where you think he's gone wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Then you air your differences publicly in an interview with a Soviet newspaper 
that reaches a select audience of opinion leaders, telling the editor you'll 
understand if he's afraid to print it. After all, some people might still be 
nervous about the limits of glasnost, Gorbachev's program of openness. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, if a Western journalist happens to call right in the middle of the 
whole affair, you happily make your case to him, as well, stressing that "the 
question is still open," and that "even Gorbachev's own position may change. 
He's a very flexible leader and highly capable of listening to arguments." 
</P>
<P>
At issue is whether the Soviet Union should import up to $7 billion worth of 
consumer goods in the next two or three years to help offset increasingly 
painful and politically troublesome shortages in the domestic market. 
</P>
<P>
But a widespread public debate that has flared over this question in recent 
weeks reaches much deeper, to critical issues of how far and how fast 
Gorbachev's reforms can go. It also gives an instructive glimpse into the 
increasing use of public opinion here to try to influence state policy. And it 
demonstrates how, to a greater extent than sometimes perceived in the West, the 
policy of glasnost extends not only to history, but, within limits, to 
criticism of current government policy and even Gorbachev himself. 
</P>
<P>
Last month the Soviet president appeared to rule out the possibility of a major 
consumer goods import program. Sounding frustrated by criticism that his 
reforms have so far failed to improve everyday life, Gorbachev told Moscow 
party leaders in a televised speech that the country had already tried 
"plugging our holes with 'funny money.' 
</P>
<P>
"Shall we continue this policy?" he continued. "We regard it as utterly 
irresponsible and will definitely not pursue it." 
</P>
<P>
If anything is imported, he implied, it ought to be the equipment to 
manufacture consumer goods, not the goods themselves. 
</P>
<P>
A few days later, in a statement seen as intended to dampen consumer 
expectations, another of Gorbachev's top advisers, Leonid Abalkin, said it 
would take until 1995 before the promised perestroika, or "restructuring" of 
the economy achieves significant results. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sitting at Kitchen Tables 
</P>
<P>
Abalkin, who is director of the national Academy of Sciences' Institute of 
Economics, told a press conference: "The important thing to know is, when will 
people, sitting around their kitchen tables, finally be able to say: 'Oh, life 
is much better now than it was.' I think this will happen only by 1995, and we 
will be reaping the first palpable changes by then." 
</P>
<P>
But economist Petrakov, who is deputy director of the academy's separate 
Central Economic Mathematical Institute, is still not giving up. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that if Abalkin's vision comes true, perestroika will expire before 
1995," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have about two years for our leadership to achieve favorable 
dynamics," Petrakov said in an interview. "Of course, no problem will be 
finally resolved in that time. But at least in the next two years the situation 
must show real improvement." 
</P>
<P>
He said the nation's store shelves are "practically naked," and that as a 
result "we are exhausting the credit of trust which the population extended to 
our leadership." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Promises of the Past 
</P>
<P>
While in his own relatively privileged position he may be ready to wait for 
five or six more years to see major changes, Petrakov commented, "How can you 
explain that to an ordinary citizen, who heard the same thing from (Leonid I.) 
Brezhnev and before that from (Nikita S.) Khrushchev? That soon everything will 
be all right?" 
</P>
<P>
Soviet intellectuals appreciate Gorbachev's reforms for the impact of glasnost 
on political and cultural life, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But we have tens of millions of people who have no interest in politics and 
who never heard of (Boris) Pasternak and (Mikhail) Bulgakov," Petrakov added, 
referring to Russian writers whose formerly suppressed works have been 
officially rehabilitated. 
</P>
<P>
"And they must feel that it's better than it was. They alone can provide that 
kind of powerful, grass-roots support that Gorbachev needs. Then and only then 
will perestroika become as 'irreversible' as he says it is," the economist 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Petrakov is not alone in his fear that waiting for Soviet industry to reorient 
its production lines will take too long. 
</P>
<P>
"If someone is dying of tuberculosis, you don't build sanitariums in the Swiss 
Alps," scoffed one Moscow professional. "You give him a quick injection to save 
him!" 
</P>
<P>
A woman from Barnaul, in Siberia, complained in a letter to the government 
newspaper Izvestia that she had just spent five hours waiting in line to buy 
three tubes of toothpaste and three bars of soap. 
</P>
<P>
"We are patient people -- that's known," she wrote. "But do they need to test 
the limits of our patience so thoroughly and for so long?" 
</P>
<P>
Everybody in the line was cursing perestroika, she added. 
</P>
<P>
"All right -- much needs to be done," she continued. "But in the meantime . . . 
they must give ordinary people a break. . . . Otherwise their anger will become 
too deep and no amount of perestroika talk . . . will move them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Who Will Feed Us?' 
</P>
<P>
Even the Communist Party newspaper Pravda, which ran an article last week by 
the head of the State Statistics Committee claiming that things are not so bad, 
featured on the opposite page a contradictory piece headlined: "Who Will Feed 
Us?" 
</P>
<P>
The officially acknowledged "unsatisfied internal demand" for consumer goods is 
70 billion rubles. That represents money in peoples' hands for which there are 
no things to buy. It's equivalent to 250 rubles, or about five weeks' pay for 
the average factory worker, for every man, woman and child in the country. 
</P>
<P>
The shortages were exacerbated by a government policy of responding to 
declining oil export revenues with cuts in imports of medicines and other 
consumer goods. Just the opposite policy is required, not only to buy more time 
for the reforms to take hold, but also to provide added incentive to the people 
who must implement them, according to Petrakov. 
</P>
<P>
Now, he said, the country is trapped in a "vicious circle. People don't want to 
work effectively because the shops are empty. . . . On the other hand, as long 
as they don't work, there will continue to be shortages." 
</P>
<P>
The only way to break the circle is with a "powerful impetus" that would result 
from diverting some of the country's foreign currency reserves and Western 
credits to buy "huge amounts" of imported goods. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Great Risk' Entailed 
</P>
<P>
Petrakov acknowledged that such a step entails "great risk," and that because 
of reduced earnings from oil exports, the timing is "horrible." But the 
alternative of spending all the nation's resources on new, consumer 
goods-producing equipment is doomed to failure, he argued. Certainly, he said, 
"we need our own equipment. We can't rely on imports forever. But there is 
strategy and there are tactics. Those calling for just equipment don't account 
for today's situation." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union has bought Western equipment in the past without generating 
any great leap forward. Eduard P. Gostev, deputy chairman of the national Bank 
for Foreign Economic Affairs, said in an interview with Britain's Reuters news 
agency last week that "some of that equipment is still lying in the snow and 
has not been installed." By last year, Gostev said, the equivalent of about 
$4.4 billion worth of goods bought with precious foreign currency had been 
wasted. 
</P>
<P>
In order to avoid what Soviet officials refer to as the "Polish disease" -- 
huge Western debts, skyrocketing inflation, and still shortages of consumer 
goods -- Petrakov said the import program would have to be accompanied by other 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
Capital investment must be "restructured" to cut out or at least slow down 
expensive industrial projects that are either unnecessary or will require many 
years to become profitable, he said. Other measures should encourage Western 
investment to take up the slack. And the government will have to cut its budget 
deficit by scaling back spending on defense and other items, as it already has 
announced it will do. 
</P>
<P>
Petrakov acknowledged that eventually the Soviet Union must cut down huge 
government subsidies and allow the laws of supply and demand to determine 
prices if perestroika is to work. But that process threatens runaway inflation. 
By importing consumer goods, the government could bring more balance to the 
market in the next two or three years and reduce the disruption associated with 
genuine price reform, he said. 
</P>
<P>
If the government moves toward market pricing in the current climate, the 
immediate result will be the worst of both worlds, continuing shortages and 
rampant inflation, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
This "will cause a highly negative attitude toward 'restructuring' as a whole," 
he said. And, referring to those here who already oppose Gorbachev's reforms as 
threatening to their own positions, he added, "The old bureaucracy won't miss 
this chance" to undermine the effort. 
</P>
<P>
Petrakov is said to be one of about 15 economists whose opinions are regularly 
sought by top government leaders. In contrast to times past, Petrakov said, 
specialists are now "treated with respect. We have the opportunity to report 
directly to Gorbachev and (Premier Nikolai I.) Ryzhkov." 
</P>
<P>
They also count on the Soviet press to carry their debates into the halls of 
political power, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Petrakov stressed that Gorbachev "hears arguments from many people." As for 
himself, he is not around to know how the final decisions are reached. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not familiar with the practical kitchen where the final cooking is taking 
place," he said with a smile.

TOWER PROBED ON NEW CHARGE OF BEING DRUNK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In its renewed investigation of defense secretary nominee John Tower, the FBI 
is checking allegations that Tower was recently involved in an episode of 
public drunkenness, sources said Friday -- allegations that call into question 
his insistence that he has no current drinking problem. 
</P>
<P>
Tower testified in confirmation hearings earlier this week that his problems 
with alcohol are behind him. 
</P>
<P>
But a senior member of the Armed Services Committee, who asked not to be 
identified, said Friday that the new allegation, if true, suggests that the 
former Texas senator's drinking problem "may be ongoing" and that his 
confirmation remains in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
The charge received Wednesday by the committee was very specific, giving the 
date and place of the alleged incident, and was made by an informant who 
identified herself, a knowledgeable source said. The episode allegedly occurred 
within the last year at the Monocle, a Capitol Hill restaurant frequented by 
lawmakers, lobbyists and congressional aides. 
</P>
<P>
Two other allegations under scrutiny by the FBI's special inquiries unit, which 
is working around the clock this weekend on the Tower matter, involve 
assertions of another incident of public intoxication and of a recent affair 
with an unidentified Dallas woman. 
</P>
<P>
If the new charges should be verified by the FBI, Tower's nomination is doomed, 
an authoritative committee source said. 
</P>
<P>
FBI agents spent two hours at the Monocle Friday, interviewing the owner, the 
maitre d', bartenders and waiters, The Times learned. The agents were told that 
Tower, when he was in the Senate, "used to drink martinis." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wine or Tonic Water 
</P>
<P>
But one source said that no one on the staff contradicted Tower's statement 
that in recent years he has moderated his once-heavy drinking and now drinks 
only an occasional glass of wine. In fact, in recent weeks, the staff told 
agents, he often has ordered tonic water. 
</P>
<P>
None of the staff could recall any recent incident of improper behavior by 
Tower at the restaurant, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the Armed Services Committee had been set to approve the Tower 
nomination, but Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) abruptly canceled the vote because of 
the new charges, which he referred immediately to FBI Director William S. 
Sessions. 
</P>
<P>
The bureau already had conducted an extensive background investigation of 
Tower, a 24-year Senate veteran who headed the Armed Services panel from 1981 
to 1985. 
</P>
<P>
When he nominated Tower, President Bush said he was "totally satisfied" with 
the FBI check. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Results Until Tuesday 
</P>
<P>
Nunn said he did not expect the latest FBI inquiry to be completed until at 
least Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Tower Friday refused to comment, as he has throughout the confirmation inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
Some Tower supporters complain that committee Democrats are turning the 
confirmation process into a "circus" for partisan political reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"This is terribly cruel to a man who's just sort of hanging out there," said 
committee member Malcolm Wallop (R-Wyo.), a Tower supporter. 
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that "our feeling is simply that we 
believe he will be confirmed but that, whenever there are any new concerns 
raised, they need to be looked into." 
</P>
<P>
A senior White House staff member, who asked not to be identified, said 
Administration officials were getting impatient with the delays in Tower's 
confirmation. "Everybody kind of wants to get our Cabinet in," the aide said. 
"People want to see him confirmed and on the job." 
</P>
<P>
House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin (D-Wis.) said that the 
controversy has already hobbled Tower's ability to lead the Pentagon 
effectively. 
</P>
<P>
"This whole nomination process is going to present a problem for him at the 
Pentagon in terms of running the place," Aspin said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>

Tower Urged to Withdraw 
</P>
<P>
And two influential defense industry trade magazines on Monday will call for 
Tower to withdraw from consideration for the Pentagon post. 
</P>
<P>
In an editorial prepared for Monday's issue, Defense News, a trade paper widely 
read by defense contractors and on Capitol Hill, says: "Withdrawal is necessary 
because the record of Mr. Tower's professional life raises substantive doubt 
that he can perform with utmost effectiveness . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Army Times, another prominent defense community publication, says Tower is 
unsuited for the Defense Department post because of his work as a consultant to 
defense contractors shortly after leaving government service in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
It said that "the speed and greed with which Tower spun through the revolving 
door (between government and industry) is appalling." Tower has said that he 
was paid a total of more than $750,000 by six defense firms in the two years 
after leaving government service. 
</P>
<P>
Tower's profitable consulting work had raised concerns among a number of 
members of the Armed Services Committee but did not appear to threaten his 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called Morally Unfit 
</P>
<P>
Tower's personal conduct, however, became an issue in the hearings on Tuesday, 
when conservative critic Paul Weyrich charged that the former senator was 
morally unfit for the post because of a history of drinking and womanizing. 
</P>
<P>
After a lengthy closed session in which Tower was allowed to respond to 
Weyrich's charges, Nunn asked the nominee publicly whether he had a problem 
with alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
"I have none, senator," Tower replied. "I am a man of some discipline."

L.A. TEACHERS AGREE TO BOARD PLAN FOR TALKS 
</P>

<P>
The Los Angeles school district's most celebrated report card day went off 
without a major snag Friday amid signs of potentially significant progress on 
the bogged-down labor negotiations front. 
</P>
<P>
In a step toward possible resolution of a yearlong labor dispute, the teachers' 
union agreed to a school board plan for nonstop, face-to-face negotiations 
beginning Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, despite some confusion, continued grumbling by students and some 
apparent report card tampering by students, union and school district officials 
reported no big problems Friday as hundreds of thousands of students were 
presented marks for their work since last September. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pressure Tactic 
</P>
<P>
As threatened by the 22,000-member teachers' union, which has been boycotting 
certain non-teaching duties as a negotiating pressure tactic, marks were given 
to the students in handwritten form on 4-by-6-inch cards prepared by the union, 
rather than filed with school offices in the normal manner. The union estimated 
that at least 85% of teachers withheld grades from the district. The district 
said the figure appeared closer to 70%. 
</P>
<P>
School Supt. Leonard Britton, contending that the withholding of grades could 
harm some students, threatened earlier in the week to withhold paychecks, 
starting next month, from teachers taking part in the grade boycott. Union 
officials have threatened to strike if that occurs. 
</P>
<P>
While student concern over the grade-withholding tactic has been partly 
responsible for widespread campus demonstrations in recent weeks, most students 
accepted the unofficial report cards without loud protest when the day finally 
came. 
</P>
<P>
"It went smoothly. This is acceptable," said Iiesha Howard, a college-bound 
senior at Dorsey High School. 
</P>
<P>
The key question of whether some seniors headed for college might be placed at 
a disadvantage if preparation of official school transcripts is delayed could 
not be conclusively answered Friday. But high school counselors appeared 
confident that they could handle any difficulties that might arise. 
</P>
<P>
"For my students, I do not anticipate any problem that is insurmountable," said 
Felicie Barnes, a college counselor at Dorsey, where about 150 of the 400 
seniors are headed for four-year universities. 
</P>
<P>
College counselors at Taft and Monroe high schools in the San Fernando Valley 
made copies of the grade cards belonging to students applying to college. They 
will examine each report card, verify any questionable grades with teachers and 
send copies to each school that requires midyear grades. They will also send a 
note explaining why the grades are not sent on official transcripts. 
</P>
<P>
"If that's what it takes to get these kids into college, I'm willing to do it," 
said Linda Zimring, Taft's college counselor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Easy to Forge Grades 
</P>
<P>
Some students and school administrators acknowledged that it would be 
relatively easy to forge grades. Most agreed, however, that students applying 
for college would not be likely to tamper with their grade cards because they 
know they would eventually be caught. 
</P>
<P>
But Taft Principal Ron Berz said students have other reasons -- such as 
establishing eligibility for extracurricular activities -- for altering grades. 
Berz said he knew of some that were changed. 
</P>
<P>
"This is going on all over school," Berz said, waving two report cards he had 
just confiscated from a student. 
</P>
<P>
Both cards had the same name, but one had markedly better grades. 
</P>
<P>
Berz said students could easily obtain an additional blank grade card and fill 
it in themselves. During a locker clean-out at Taft Thursday, he said, 
administrators discovered 50 or 60 blank grade cards. He said he suspected 
students had found them on teachers' desks and made copies. 
</P>
<P>
Lovell Johnson, a Monroe High School senior, said he was aware that some 
students were altering their report cards and added that it was easy to get 
extra cards. 
</P>
<P>
"Say you fail first period, then you go to your next period and say you didn't 
get one," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
"You can write your own report card," confirmed Shannon McIntyre, also a Monroe 
senior. 
</P>
<P>
United Teachers-Los Angeles President Wayne Johnson agreed that forging grades 
was possible, but he insisted that it was a minor problem and would succeed in 
fooling parents only for a short time. 
</P>
<P>
"Eventually, these grades will be filed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Worry and Debate 
</P>
<P>
For some students, the worry and debate over the unofficial report cards 
continued even after they received them. At Garfield High on the Eastside, 
senior Anna Gonzalez, 17, said she wants to attend a local trade school in the 
fall but may not be eligible unless she can present her official report card 
within two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no way the school will accept this report card," she said. "While the 
teachers and the schools are fighting, what am I supposed to do about getting 
an education?" 
</P>
<P>
But Josh Ofstein, a Monroe senior who is applying at several Ivy League 
colleges, said, "Anyone who these grades really matter to knows there isn't 
going to be a serious problem." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the day, there were many instances of confusion. At Dorsey High, for 
example, senior Blanca Torres' card was missing one grade from a teacher who 
was not participating in the union action. On another line of her card, the 
teacher had apparently been confused about how to fill out the form, and the 
information was incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
For a third class, Torres' teacher had scribbled over a mistake and marked the 
change with initials. Torres said her counselor told her "that doesn't look 
good." 
</P>
<P>
At Gardena High School, teacher Hartley Kern, the union representative, said 
Gardena students applying to college were confused about where to go for 
counseling. 
</P>
<P>
"Students know they should get their grades to a counselor," Kern said. "But 
we've had no directive from the principal as to what seniors are supposed to do 
-- go to a college counselor or to a regular counselor. I tell students to go 
to both places to make sure they've done it right." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the grumbling and inconvenience, many students continued to show 
sympathy for the teachers and support for their job action. Seventeen-year-old 
Lizbeth Chavira, a Garfield High senior, said, "It's not (the teachers') fault 
that they need a pay raise. They can't support their families, and they have to 
do this to make things better for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, under orders from a state mediator supervising the contract 
negotiations, the teachers' union accepted a school board-proposed bargaining 
format it had rejected a day earlier. The Sunday session at school district 
headquarters will put school board President Roberta Weintraub and union 
President Johnson face-to-face, along with Britton and professional negotiators 
for both sides. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby for consultation will be the others needed to approve new offers and any 
settlement -- the other six school board members and elected union officers. 
</P>
<P>
Diana Munatones, a district spokeswoman, said officials hope the contract 
dispute over wages and other issues can be quickly settled so "students can get 
back to class and studies and teachers can get back" to their duties. But 
Johnson warned Friday that the union will renew its demand for the presence of 
all seven school board members at the talks if rapid progress is not made. 
</P>
<P>
"I find it absolutely incredible that seven elected officials will not sit down 
and meet . . . union officials on a contract dispute that has this whole city 
turned upside down," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The two sides are far apart on wage increases and other issues, including how 
neighborhood schools should be managed. Teachers want a one-year contract with 
a 12% pay increase, but the district is seeking a three-year contract and says 
it cannot afford much more than its current pay offer of 17.4% spread over the 
three years.

SANDINISTA PROPOSAL FOR REBELS WINS HONDURAS SUPPORT 
</P>

<P>
In what could be a breakthrough in Central America's stalled peace efforts, 
Honduras gave qualified support Friday to a Nicaraguan government proposal for 
disarming and resettling idled Nicaraguan rebels who want to leave their 
military camps in Honduras. 
</P>
<P>
Honduran President Jose Azcona Hoyo gave his response after hearing the 
proposal from Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega and discussing it with Vice 
President Dan Quayle. Honduran and U.S. officials said the Nicaraguan plan will 
receive serious attention. 
</P>
<P>
This apparent step toward talks on disbanding the U.S.-backed Contra army was 
taken as Latin American leaders meeting here pressed Ortega to relax his 
Sandinista party's strong grip on a postwar Nicaragua. A final armistice in the 
Contra war is expected to be the goal of a five-nation Central American summit 
meeting now set for Feb. 13-14 in San Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
Honduras, a long-compliant U.S. ally and Nicaragua's northern neighbor, has 
played host to the Contra army since the CIA assembled it in 1981. After the 
U.S. Congress cut off their military aid a year ago, about 10,000 rebels have 
retreated to the Honduran border camps, leaving only a token force to skirmish 
in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
As one of the Latin American leaders who gathered here Wednesday for 
Venezuela's presidential inauguration, Ortega handed Azcona a proposal offering 
land, jobs and amnesty to Contras who want to lay down their weapons. 
Nicaragua's Sandinista government would also release most of its 3,000 or so 
remaining political prisoners, take other steps toward a freer society and set 
up a team of Hondurans and Nicaraguans to monitor the homecoming. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Extraordinary Problem' 
</P>
<P>
Azcona said he felt obliged to study the proposal because the presence of so 
many armed Contras in his country is "an extraordinary problem" that could 
become a "security threat" if, lacking renewed American military aid, they 
abandon the camps and scatter about the country. 
</P>
<P>
"We can help solve this problem by easing the departure of the Contras from 
Honduras to third counties that want to receive them. We can collect these 
Contras' arms, if that is the decision, and we can ease the departure to 
Nicaragua of those Contras who accept amnesty in Nicaragua," Azcona told 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Azcona said he insisted in their meeting that Ortega cannot wait until the 
rebel army is dissolved before keeping promises about democratic reforms that 
the Nicaraguan leader made as one of the five signers of a Central American 
peace accord 18 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Azcona said, he will support continued non-lethal U.S. aid to 
the Contras to keep them together. 
</P>
<P>
But twice during his press conference, Azcona said he was "pleased" and "fully 
satisfied" with Ortega's promises to reduce the size of the Sandinista army, 
hold fair elections next year and give freer rein to private enterprise in 
Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle discussed the plan with Azcona here but declined to comment on it 
publicly. But he said the Bush Administration is making "no move right now" to 
rearm the Contras, with the hope that "diplomatic initiatives" can force 
changes in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. official said the Administration "will take a good hard look" at the 
Ortega plan but may need months to devise a strategy for Central America. "The 
whole region is more out on its own than ever," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega beamed as he watched a telecast of Azcona's remarks from his hotel 
suite. "I think we have achieved a rapprochement," he said. "The summit can be 
fruitful." 
</P>
<P>
Other Latin American leaders here for the swearing-in of President Carlos 
Andres Perez told Ortega that he must concede more than amnesty for the summit 
to succeed. However, none insisted that he resume the direct talks with Contra 
leaders that were broken off last June. 
</P>
<P>
President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica, author of the 1987 peace accord, 
challenged Ortega to advance municipal elections now set for November, 1990, 
into this year and to abolish a censorship law. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Three-Hour Meeting 
</P>
<P>
In an unusual three-hour meeting that ended early Friday, Ortega and Arias 
debated the Nicaraguan conflict with the Sandinistas' closest Latin American 
allies -- Cuban President Fidel Castro, Peruvian President Alan Garcia and the 
new Venezuelan president. 
</P>
<P>
An official who was present said that Castro did little talking, leaving Ortega 
to defend himself. 
</P>
<P>
For Ortega, said the source, "it was like having your best friends tell you, 
'We respect you, but we think you have to do more.' They're telling him this 
could be his best and last opportunity for peace."

QUAYLE GIVES SALVADOR ULTIMATUM ON RIGHTS 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vice President Dan Quayle said Friday that he was delivering "a very emphatic, 
very strong" message that the United States expects El Salvador's armed forces 
to eliminate violations of human rights or face "consequences." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters just before he entered the Salvadoran military 
headquarters for meetings with Defense Minister Carlos Vides Casanova and 
ranking field commanders, the vice president said: 
</P>
<P>
"And when I emerge . . . there will be no doubt in their minds of our 
seriousness about our commitment to human rights and to justice, and that we 
expect them to work toward the elimination of human rights (violations)." 
</P>
<P>
Although most Salvadoran officials and politicians were more anxious to hear 
Quayle's reaction to recent peace proposals by the nation's Marxist-led 
guerrillas, the vice president made it clear that he wanted the world to know 
of the Bush Administration's concern over human rights. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Early 1980s Violence 
</P>
<P>
Compared to the bloody days of the early 1980s, when more than 800 people a 
month were dying in El Salvador's political violence, most of them at the hands 
of government-sanctioned death squads, the current figures provided by church 
and human rights groups, are relatively light: 96 in 1987 and 145 in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle appeared eager to exert influence toward reversing the trend toward 
rising political violence. 
</P>
<P>
He alluded to the December, 1983, visit here by then-Vice President Bush, who 
had threatened an end to the huge American military aid program and apparently 
forced a moderation of government-inspired human rights abuses. 
</P>
<P>
"My message will be direct," Quayle said, "it will be emphatic. It will be much 
along the lines that Vice President George Bush conveyed to them in 1983." 
</P>
<P>
Quayle, for whom the nine-hour visit here was the last stop on his first 
foreign trip as vice president, flew from Venezuela where he had represented 
the United States at the inauguration of President Carlos Andres Perez. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Debate About Peace 
</P>
<P>
He arrived here in the midst of efforts by the government and various political 
parties to find a common response to a peace proposal made last week by the 
guerrillas who have been fighting the government for nearly nine years. 
</P>
<P>
The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, or FMLN as the group is known by 
its Spanish initials, offered to take part in a national election for president 
and accept the results of the voting if the election, now scheduled for March 
19, were postponed to Sept. 17. As part of such an accord, the group said it 
would drop previous demands for a negotiated sharing of power and the 
integration of the 7,000 guerrilla fighters with the 58,000-member regular 
army. 
</P>
<P>
In his 15-minute session with reporters at the residence of U.S. Ambassador 
William G. Walker, Quayle said the rebel proposal "is a step forward." But he 
added that any negotiations should be accompanied by an immediate cease-fire by 
the FMLN, something the rebels have not offered. 
</P>
<P>
The vice president's remarks came a day after President Jose Napoleon Duarte 
backtracked from his initial rejection of the FMLN offer, saying that the 
proposal now gives "promises of hope." Duarte said any movement toward a 
national consensus had to be within a constitutional framework. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Proposal for War' 
</P>
<P>
The Salvadoran president had originally called the plan "a proposal for war" 
and said any postponement of the election would be unconstitutional. The 
constitution calls for the first round of presidential balloting to take place 
no later than two months before a new president is supposed to take office -- 
in this case by March 31. 
</P>
<P>
Duarte's change of mind, under pressure from the Bush Administration and the 
U.S. Embassy here, signaled a subtle shift that allowed the president's 
followers to suggest a solution. For instance, Fidel Chavez Mena, the 
presidential candidate of Duarte's Christian Democratic Party, proposed his own 
peace plan Friday just before meeting with Quayle. 
</P>
<P>
The key point of the Chavez Mena's plan calls for all presidential candidates 
to withdraw, thus mooting the election. Under this plan, when Duarte's term 
ends in June, the National Assembly, as permitted by the constitution, would 
appoint an interim president until new elections could be arranged. 
</P>
<P>
This plan will be discussed Monday and Tuesday at an all-party conference, 
together with a plan advanced by the Nationalist Republican Alliance, an 
ultra-rightist party now leading the presidential polls. The rightist proposal 
is to invite FMLN leaders to discuss their offer before the National Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle told reporters that the effort "to develop a national consensus within 
the framework of the constitution is the way to proceed." 
</P>
<P>
But it was human rights that he returned to whenever possible. 
</P>
<P>
"I will have a very direct discussion," he said of his meeting with the army 
leaders. "There will be specifics in my discussion. We're not just here to give 
a platitude for the support of human rights. . . . The conversation and the 
talks will be very direct and very candid." 
</P>
<P>
When asked if he would threaten the military with an end of U.S. aid, the vice 
president answered: 
</P>
<P>
"There are consequences of human rights violations in the future. We, the 
United States, are committed to the process and the system of democracy. 
Democracy means human rights and decency. . . ."

DE KLERK WILL SUCCEED AILING BOTHA 'IF HE WANTS JOB,' PRETORIA SAYS

<TEXT>
<P>
Frederik W. de Klerk, the conservative Cabinet minister and new leader of the 
ruling National Party, is certain to become South Africa's next president "if 
he wants the job," the government's chief spokesman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no question about where the power for choosing the next president 
will reside. F.W. de Klerk is now the leader of the party," Information 
Minister Stoffel van der Merwe said in the government's first specific comment 
on the issue of presidential succession. 
</P>
<P>
Van der Merwe, briefing foreign journalists in Cape Town before the opening 
session of Parliament, also said President Pieter W. Botha, who suffered a mild 
stroke two weeks ago, is "not currently being consulted on running the 
day-to-day business of government." 
</P>
<P>
Botha, 73, resigned his leadership of the party Thursday, giving up a 
significant portion of the power that he has held in South Africa for the past 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts believe that Botha, by separating the jobs of party and 
government leadership, was signaling his intention to remain as president at 
least until his 5-year term expires in September or until the next general 
election. 
</P>
<P>
Van der Merwe declined to speculate on Botha's plans but said, "The clear 
indication is that President Botha is not going to relinquish his office now." 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk, a leader of the conservative wing of the party, was elected party 
leader by a 69-61 vote in a party caucus Thursday, defeating Finance Minister 
Barend du Plessis, considered one of the party's more liberal members. 
</P>
<P>
Under the South African constitution, presidents are selected by a system 
effectively controlled by the caucus of the ruling party. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk, like most of Botha's Cabinet ministers, has until now remained in the 
shadow of Botha's powerful personality. The 52-year-old education minister has 
not revealed his goals for the country, other than to express his support for 
Botha's programs. 
</P>
<P>
But given De Klerk's relative conservatism, many political analysts believe 
that the gradual and limited reform program begun under Botha would slow 
considerably under a De Klerk administration. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Campus Crackdown 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk has cracked down on anti-apartheid protesters at universities by 
vowing to withdraw government funds from schools that allow demonstrations. He 
also has been among the more vocal critics of white South Africans who hold 
talks with the African National Congress, the primary guerrilla group fighting 
Pretoria's white minority-led government. 
</P>
<P>
Botha's absence from the opening of Parliament cast a pall over the usual 
pageantry of the proceedings, presided over by Acting President Chris Heunis. 
Although the president's opening speech has traditionally laid down some of the 
government's plans for the year, Heunis delivered a more general address that 
highlighted the government's achievements but offered little of its vision for 
the future of reform. 
</P>
<P>
"One cannot introduce earth-shattering new reform initiatives" with Botha still 
recovering from his illness, Van der Merwe explained. "But reform is going 
forward. You can rest assured." 
</P>
<P>
On his doctors' orders, Botha was not allowed to help write or review Heunis' 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
Heunis did announce that the government has formally withdrawn its own 
controversial amendment to the Group Areas Act that would have toughened 
enforcement of the 35-year-old law dividing South Africa into separate living 
areas by race. 
</P>
<P>
But he reiterated the government's commitment to racial segregation, saying it 
will study "other ways and means of guaranteeing (racially separate) community 
life" for those who want it. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a government measure to create, for the first time, some residential 
areas where whites and blacks could live as neighbors has become law. Under the 
legislation, a "free settlement" board will soon begin studying possible open 
areas. The government will retain final power to declare an area open, however. 
</P>
<P>
Because of a severe housing shortage for black South Africans, thousands have 
already moved into areas set aside for whites only. 
</P>
<P>
The government has been under increasing pressure from the far-right 
Conservative Party to more strictly enforce its residential segregation law as 
well as its Separate Amenities Act, which Conservative Party members have used 
in several cities to ban blacks from using public facilities such as parks and 
meeting halls.

Soviet authorities have ordered the evacuation of 20 more villages in the 
republic of Byelorussia because of continuing high levels of fallout from the 
1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet television reported Thursday that persistently high levels of cesium 137 
were recorded in 17 districts of Byelorussia -- up to 170 miles north of the 
site of the accident in the neighboring republic of the Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
It described the aftermath of the accident as an "unhealed wound" and said, 
without elaborating, that residents had not been fully informed on the 
consequences of the April, 1986, accident. 
</P>
<P>
The explosion and fire at the Chernobyl power plant was the world's worst 
nuclear accident, killing 31 people, forcing the evacuation of at least 100,000 
and causing losses estimated at $13 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The television report said contamination from the accident had affected 415 
settlements with a total population of 103,000. 
</P>
<P>
A local Communist Party official said agencies should be under strict public 
control to ensure all food consumed in Byelorussia is free of contamination. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the plant's reactors are back in operation. The fourth reactor has 
been encased in concrete.

MYSTERY, DOUBTS SHROUD KIDNAPING OF BELGIAN

<P>
It is a real-life mystery worthy of the fictional Belgian detective, Hercule 
Poirot. 
</P>
<P>
One of Belgium's most popular politicians, two-time Prime Minister Paul Vanden 
Boeynants, was kidnaped Jan. 14 from his apartment building garage by a group 
calling itself the Socialist Revolutionary Brigade. 
</P>
<P>
But some people think maybe not. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's put it this way," said a non-European diplomat based here, "We have 
strong doubts that things happened the way they said." 
</P>
<P>
One reason for the skepticism is that Vanden Boeynants, 69, was convicted of 
tax evasion two years ago by a judge who called him an "inveterate cheat." He 
was being investigated once again, this time for receiving kickbacks between 
1972-79 while he was Belgium's defense minister. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, the former butcher turned politician, nicknamed "Paul Sausage" 
because he used to distribute truck-loads of free blood sausages to encourage 
voters on election days, has disappeared and investigators have been stymied 
for nearly three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"We are waiting for a trail to follow," said Brussels public prosecutor Andre 
Vandoren earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
"We are hoping for something in the next few days. But all we know now is that 
he has been kidnaped by a group calling itself the Socialist Revolutionary 
Brigade that is ideologically not very clear." 
</P>
<P>
The previously unknown organization took responsibility in a telephone call to 
the Belgian radio and television service on the day of the kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
Ten days later, a Brussels newspaper received a typewritten demand for $790,000 
in ransom from the group, along with Vanden Boeynants' identity card and some 
strangely worded samples of his handwriting. His note pledged that a 
substantial portion of the ransom money would be paid to institutions for the 
poor within six weeks of his release. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, there's been no word on Vanden Boeynants' fate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Tearful Appeal 
</P>
<P>
In desperation, the missing politician's son went on television this week in a 
tearful appeal to the kidnapers and his father. "Papa, if you can hear me or if 
you can see me, you must know that we are with you," said Christian Vanden 
Boeynants, manager of one of his father's meat-processing plants. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, nearly everyone in Brussels has a theory about what happened to 
their favorite politician, a Christian Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
Even after his conviction, Vanden Boeynants received more votes than anyone 
else in recent city elections and was in line to become mayor of Brussels, a 
life-long dream of his. 
</P>
<P>
He reluctantly turned the job down under pressure from Prime Minister Wilfried 
Martens, who is said to have balked at the idea of a convicted man -- Vanden 
Boeynants received a three-year suspended sentence -- being chief executive of 
the "Capital of Europe." 
</P>
<P>
But in the tough working-class neighborhoods like Les Marolles, a maze of 
narrow cobblestone streets in the heart of Brussels, people are more likely to 
forgive his sins and relish his exploits. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'He Knew Too Much' 
</P>
<P>
When he was asked about Vanden Boeynants, a retired policeman happily pulled a 
dog-eared card signed by the politician from his briefcase. "We once dined 
together," he said proudly. 
</P>
<P>
The retired policeman speculated that the Vanden Boeynants has been killed by 
some of his political associates because "he knew too much." 
</P>
<P>
A Communist painting contractor said he had great respect for the virulently 
anti-Communist political leader. He theorized that the kidnaping was the work 
of the extreme right wing. 
</P>
<P>
A taxi driver said it could only be the work of the extreme left. "Most of my 
friends are extreme right. I know it was not them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Strange crimes of murky ideological origin are not that unusual in Brussels. 
Four years ago, the city and its suburbs suffered a wave of commando-style 
attacks by gunmen on crowded markets. After two years of this random violence 
that left the city in a state of terror, the attacks suddenly stopped, but not 
before 30 people had been killed. 
</P>
<P>
No one was ever arrested. Opinion remains divided as to whether the attacking 
gang was a leftist group or a right-wing group. 
</P>
<P>
A popular theory in the Robin Hood vein is that Vanden Boeynants disappeared 
with part of the Belgian treasury. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm afraid Paul Sausage has drowned in a pot-de-vin," said a denizen of a Les 
Marolles bar named La Lanterne. He used the expression -- literally, a pot of 
wine -- that is argot for "payoff." 
</P>
<P>
Theories like this have caused Vanden Boeynants' many friends to jump to his 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
Vanden Boeynants is an honest man of scrupulous political morality, said his 
former aide in the ministry of defense, retired Gen. Jules Everaert. 
</P>
<P>
In the general's mind, his friend was the victim of persecution by the press, 
although the political leader seemed on good terms with reporters, sending many 
of them several pounds of prime beef every Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
"He had the impression that each time a villainous affair exploded in Belgium, 
someone tried to throw him in the middle of it in one way or the other. Once he 
told me: 'When I die, they will follow me to the grave.' "

A large Soviet military convoy pulled out of Kabul in a snowstorm during the 
night, leaving only a rear guard Friday in the besieged Afghan capital. 
</P>
<P>
Afghan soldiers questioned by reporters said the column of tanks, armored 
personnel carriers and trucks full of soldiers took three hours to file up the 
road to the 12,000-foot-high Salang Pass. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet sources confirmed that a big convoy had left and said only 1,000 to 
1,500 troops remain, mainly guarding the city's airport. They are to be 
withdrawn over the next week, in advance of the Feb. 15 deadline under last 
April's Geneva accord. 
</P>
<P>
In an incident Friday, French journalist Jean-Francois Leven of the weekly 
L'Express was shot and slightly wounded by a Soviet soldier, a colleague said. 
The soldier reportedly was upset over Leven taking photographs.

IRAN TO FOCUS ON REVIVING DEVASTATED ECONOMY

Recovering from eight years of fighting, Iran will devote the second decade of 
its Islamic revolution to rebuilding the war-devastated nation, Parliament 
Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Addressing tens of thousands of worshipers at Tehran University, Rafsanjani 
said the next decade of the fundamentalist-led Islamic revolution will be "the 
decade of construction and economic independence." 
</P>
<P>
He said war-devastated Iran has "all the potential needed to step in that 
direction," Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency quoted him as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Iran this week began celebrating the 10th year of its Islamic revolution and 
the return to Tehran from exile of Iran's supreme leader, the Ayatollah 
Ruhollah Khomeini. It was the first time in eight years the celebration was not 
held under the shadow of combat and followed the August cease-fire with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Two senior Iranian officials echoed Rafsanjani's call for economic 
reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
Central Bank Governor Majid Qasemi said Iran is on the verge of economic 
revival and will borrow from abroad to finance viable projects. It was the 
first time in almost a decade that a senior official confirmed that Tehran will 
solicit large loans from Western money markets. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Oil Minister Gholamreza Aghazadeh said in New York that his country 
plans to raise $3 billion in foreign loans in the next five years to set up 
"revenue-producing projects," the news agency of the Organization of Petroleum 
Exporting Countries reported Friday. The report was monitored in Manama, 
Bahrain. 
</P>
<P>
Khomeini had banned such loans when he took power and established an Islamic 
regime. 
</P>
<P>
Iran almost entirely self-financed its war with Iraq, while the Baghdad 
government remains heavily in debt, especially to Arab Persian Gulf states and 
Japanese banks. 
</P>
<P>
Aghazadeh added that Iran is close to agreement with the Soviet Union on the 
export of Iranian natural gas once a price has been agreed upon. 
</P>
<P>
The absence of ties with the United States has pushed Iran to develop closer 
economic links with Moscow and its East European allies.

LUJAN URGES U.S. FUNDING TO FIGHT FOREST FIRES 
</P>

<P>
Signaling a likely reversal of Reagan Administration policy, Interior Secretary 
Manuel Lujan Jr. said Friday that he has urged the White House to restore more 
than $140 million in federal funding to fight forest fires that start on public 
lands. 
</P>
<P>
The issue has been a matter of contention since the cost of fighting last 
summer's massive blazes soared to unprecedented levels, burdening federal 
coffers and prompting suggestions that state and local authorities pick up some 
of the tab. 
</P>
<P>
At the urging of former Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel, outgoing President 
Ronald Reagan included the burden-sharing proposal in the budget that he 
submitted to Congress last month. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Use of Supplemental Funds 
</P>
<P>
But Lujan told reporters at his first news conference Friday that he has urged 
the Office of Management and Budget to strike that provision and instead use 
supplemental federal appropriations to pay for unexpected fire costs. 
</P>
<P>
His proposal could require more than $80 million in added expenditures by the 
Interior Department, which oversees the Park Service, a department official 
said. He estimated that it would add more than $60 million to the budget of the 
Agriculture Department, which has authority over the Forest Service. 
</P>
<P>
Lujan sought on another matter to deflate expectations of a change in course, 
going out of his way to say that he did not expect Bush to set aside "a lot of 
money for acquisitions" of federal lands. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists had held out hope in the wake of Reagan's seven-year 
moratorium on land acquisitions that Bush might take a markedly different line. 
But Lujan emphasized Friday that "we have to work within budget constraints" 
and indicated that he would not support any large-scale land purchases. 
</P>
<P>
"To be frank," the New Mexican said, noting that his native state is largely 
owned by the federal government, "I have not ever been too crazy about adding 
any new lands to federal ownership." 
</P>
<P>
Generally, however, Lujan maintained in the news conference the passive manner 
he already has exhibited in his confirmation hearings. He answered reporters' 
questions more than a dozen times with "I don't know," and he said that the 
forest fire-fighting proposal is the only issue on which he has stated a 
forceful case to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
He declined in particular to take a stand on the renewal of water contracts in 
California's Central Valley. Critics have opposed renewal on grounds that they 
would extend costly federal subsidies for up to 40 years and that they could 
pose hazards to the environment. 
</P>
<P>
Lujan said only that the department's past position -- recommending that the 
contracts be renewed before an environmental impact study could be conducted -- 
is under review. 
</P>
<P>
But the department's principal antagonist in the controversy, the Environmental 
Protection Agency, moved Friday to take the matter out of Lujan's hands, 
referring it to the White House Council on Environmental Quality and asking 
that it settle the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Acting EPA Administrator John A. Moore requested that Interior "take no action" 
on the contracts, the first of which comes due Feb. 28, "until the council acts 
upon this referral."

7-YEAR-OLD AIDS PATIENT SHARES HUG WITH PRINCESS

<P>
The 7-year-old boy in blue pajamas was standing with his nurse in a 17th floor 
corridor of Harlem Hospital, and when the woman in a red wool suit with black 
velvet buttons on the sleeves walked by, he looked up at her shining blonde 
hair. 
</P>
<P>
"Are you very heavy?" she asked, stopping. 
</P>
<P>
Princess Diana bent down, picked up the child, who has AIDS, and hugged him. 
For two or three minutes, the worlds of poverty and plenty were united as the 
princess and the patient stood in the hallway, the little boy's head on Diana's 
shoulder, his arms around her neck. With a sad smile, the princess finally put 
him down. 
</P>
<P>
Moments earlier, on the final stop of her three-day visit to New York before 
her return to London, Diana had put a question to Dr. Margaret Heagarty, Harlem 
Hospital's director of pediatrics: 
</P>
<P>
"When you have the problem of drugs, how on earth are you going to cope with 
the problem of AIDS?" 
</P>
<P>
"They (drug users) are irresponsible," the physician told the princess. "But we 
have seen women on drugs with AIDS sit by their dying children and mourn. 
</P>
<P>
"I have come to the conclusion that just because you are a drug user doesn't 
mean you don't love your children. They love their children as you love your 
little princes. They are just folks. I have given up judging." 
</P>
<P>
Diana traveled to Harlem on Friday to visit New York's municipal hospital 
system, under strain because of poverty, homelessness and AIDS, after attending 
a gala dinner the night before under the glass dome of the Winter Garden, on 
the Hudson River in New York's World Financial Center. 
</P>
<P>
In Britain, Diana has worked to dispel myths about the spread of the virus, 
shaking hands with an AIDS patient to show that the disease can't be 
communicated through casual contact. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you think people are educated enough about this?" Diana asked the 
physician. 
</P>
<P>
"No, not enough. But visits like yours help. Our own 'royalty,' whatever that 
is, being a democracy or a republic or whatever, have not done as much as you, 
anything so symbolic as you," the director of pediatrics replied. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe we share compassion for our children," she told the princess. "AIDS 
is a virus infection. It is a disease. It is not a crime or a sin." 
</P>
<P>
However, Heagarty also told reporters during Diana's visit that Barbara Bush, 
"with not any great fanfare" had toured the hospital's pediatric unit before 
the Republican convention "just to see for herself the problems of the children 
with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that may very well translate into additional resources for children 
with AIDS," the physician said. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . I think the folks who are required to deal with both the medical care 
and the social needs of these children are stretched almost beyond endurance 
and that we need additional resources," Heagarty continued. 
</P>
<P>
Staffers and patients in the hospital's lobby cheered when Diana arrived at 
mid-morning and went straight to an AIDS briefing conducted by Dr. Heagarty in 
a second floor conference room. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you think this situation is going to get worse?" Diana asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," Heagarty said. 
</P>
<P>
"In the next five years?" 
</P>
<P>
"Well into the next century," the physician replied. 
</P>
<P>
Diana then went to an upper floor of the hospital. Nurses, lining the corridor, 
held out their hands to be touched. Some carried children in their arms. In the 
pediatrics unit, an 11-month old infant with AIDS was being held by his 
grandmother. The baby boy curled his fingers around Diana's finger, and the 
child gazed up with big brown eyes at the princess. They remained linked that 
way for two or three minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Diana stroked a pink frilly dress worn by a 23-month-old girl named Monica, who 
was held by Galye Alston, a nurse in the unit who is adopting the infant, an 
AIDS patient. 
</P>
<P>
"I brought her here to see you today," Alston explained. 
</P>
<P>
Diana sat down in a rocking chair next to a young mother holding her baby with 
AIDS in her arms. She chatted with the mother as they both rocked. 
</P>
<P>
As Diana prepared to depart -- with gifts of two small white teddy bears for 
Prince William, 6, and Prince Harry, 4, and a card signed by local 
schoolchildren -- a worker on the pediatrics floor, Lulu King, rushed up to her 
and clasped her arms. 
</P>
<P>
"Princess Di, thank you for bringing love and youth and vitality to Harlem," 
she said.

CHRISTIC INSTITUTE ORDERED TO PAY $1 MILLION

A federal judge on Friday awarded nearly $1 million in attorneys fees to a 
Contra leader, a former CIA official and others who were accused in a civil 
lawsuit of mounting a guns-for-drugs scheme to aid the Nicaraguan rebels. 
</P>
<P>
Chief U.S. District Judge James Lawrence King in June threw out the $24-million 
lawsuit filed by the Christic Institute on behalf of journalists Tony Avirgan 
and Martha Honey, saying the plaintiffs failed to prove their case. Defense 
attorneys then filed a motion seeking to recover damages caused by the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
King ruled in their favor again Friday, saying the institute and the plaintiffs 
would have to pay the defendants $955,000 in attorneys fees and $79,500 in 
court costs. 
</P>
<P>
He said the suit was "based on unsubstantiated rumor and speculation from 
unidentified sources with no first-hand knowledge." 
</P>
<P>
Among the defendants in the suit were Adolfo Calero, a civilian leader of the 
Contras, and Iran-Contra figures Richard V. Secord and Albert A. Hakim, and 
former Maj. Gen. John K. Singlaub. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Sheehan, a lawyer for the Washington-based Christic Institute, a liberal 
public-interest legal services group, called the order a "legal disgrace" and 
said it provided further evidence of King's bias in the case. "Obviously, we 
are going to appeal this," he said.

DEFENSE PANEL URGES REVIVING OF PLAN TO 'HIDE' ICBMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A bipartisan group of congressmen and defense experts urged the Bush 
Administration Friday to scuttle its predecessor's proposal to put the MX 
intercontinental missile on rail cars. As an alternative, it offered a 
variation of the old "shell game" concept in which the ICBM is hidden among a 
field of otherwise empty silos. 
</P>
<P>
In the long-running search for an ICBM that would escape a Soviet surprise 
attack and be politically acceptable, the group set the stage for a new battle 
over the weapon system by reviving a modification of a plan discarded by the 
Administration of Jimmy Carter a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
Variously called a "race track" and "drag strip" approach, the Carter scheme 
would have shuttled 200 MX missiles among 4,600 shelters in Utah and Nevada to 
protect them by deception. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Snicker Factor' 
</P>
<P>
Resurrecting the idea risks "the snicker factor -- an enormous groan" over yet 
another ICBM basing idea, admited Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wis.), chairman of the 
House Armed Services Committee and a member of the group. More than 30 
proposals have been rejected to date. But he claimed that the new concept 
overcomes many of the objections of the earlier schemes. 
</P>
<P>
The group's report, titled "Deterring Through the Turn of the Century," sought 
a basis for compromise between the Democratic-controlled Congress and the new 
Republican Administration over the ICBM as well as other contentious weapon 
issues. Balancing recommendations for liberals and conservatives, the report 
also endorsed: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Continued funding for Reagan's controversial Strategic Defense Initiative, 
commonly called "Star Wars," at the current level of about $4 billion a year, 
"with modest annual increases." It admitted that there is "no near-term 
prospect" that anti-missile defenses can substitute for today's deterrence 
doctrine based on offensive weapons, however. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Deep cuts in offensive nuclear arsenals as agreed in the Strategic Arms 
Reduction negotiations. Some conservatives and military officers have begun to 
challenge the proposed cuts. The United States should drop its proposal to ban 
mobile ICBMs, the report said. It also suggested that the United States accept 
a ban on nuclear sea-launched cruise missiles and move to raise the agreed 
ceiling of 1,600 missiles and bombers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Essentially all major strategic weapons programs now in place, while 
acknowledging that the defense budget will rise no faster than inflation. It 
said that "some programs may need to be canceled, others delayed," but it 
recommended only delays and sought to establish priorities in spending rather 
than fingering programs for cancellations. 
</P>
<P>
For example, it urged that the ICBM modernization program be modified, and 
probably at greater cost. It would put only the nuclear-armed sea-launched 
cruise missile program in jeopardy. It suggested slowing down development of 
the B-2 stealth bomber, because it is expensive and unproven, and the Trident 
submarine program because it might carry too many weapons to fit comfortably 
into limits of a strategic arms treaty. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Sequence Them' 
</P>
<P>
The plan "doesn't mean you have to cancel programs. You have to sequence them," 
Aspin said at a Capitol Hill press conference. Added another member, Robert C. 
McFarlane, former national security adviser to President Ronald Reagan: "They 
can have it all, just at a slower rate." 
</P>
<P>
The group was co-chaired by Harold Brown, former defense secretary in the 
Carter Administration, and Brent Scowcroft until his appointment last month as 
President Bush's national security assistant. 
</P>
<P>
Other members were Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), chairman of the House Armed Services 
Committee; two key Republican senators, John W. Warner of Virginia and William 
S. Cohen of Maine; R. James Woolsey, former undersecretary of the Navy in the 
Carter Administration; Amos A. Jordan of the Center for Strategic and 
International Studies here; Aspin, and McFarlane. 
</P>
<P>
Focus of the report was the ICBM issue, which the group said arose because of 
"the most glaring weakness" in the U.S. strategic arsenal today: the 
vulnerability of existing silo-based ICBMs to increasingly accurate and 
numerically superior Soviet warheads. The Soviets might destroy U.S. ICBMs in a 
surprise attack, then threaten U.S. cities if the United States retaliated. 
</P>
<P>
The danger was first recognized 15 years ago when the 10-warhead MX was 
designed but the Carter Administration failed to win approval of its MX basing 
scheme, as did Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Reagan appointed a special commission chaired by Scowcroft in 1983 
which found that U.S. vulnerability was not as acute as feared because 
submarine-based missiles and bombers guaranteed sufficient retaliatory forces, 
even if the ICBMs were destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
The commission also achieved a compromise in which 50 MXs were placed in 
existing silos (where they are just as vulnerable as the older Minuteman 3 
missiles they replaced), in exchange for which the Pentagon began to develop a 
single-warhead small ICBM, called the Midgetman, that promised to be more 
survivable than the MX because it could be moved around on dirt roads. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration now faces the vulnerability issue because Soviet 
submarine-based cruise missiles, among other new weapons, will make possible in 
the near future an attack on U.S. bomber and ICBM forces at the same time, the 
group said. This will cause dangerous over-reliance on U.S. missile submarines, 
in its view. 
</P>
<P>
Recent efforts to resolve the issue have reached an impasse.

PAUL ROBI, 57; ORIGINAL SINGER WITH PLATTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paul Robi, an original member of the Platters, one of popular music's most 
successful vocal teams in the 1950s and '60s, died Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Robi's daughter, Franchesca, said her father was 57 and died of cancer in a Los 
Angeles hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Another member of the original group, David Lynch, died on Jan. 2, 1981, also 
of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
At a time when rock 'n' roll was becoming the nation's signature music, the 
Platters managed to appeal to both rock and traditional movements. 
</P>
<P>
Their renditions of "Only You," "The Great Pretender," "Magic Touch" and "My 
Prayer" sold in the millions of copies. In a single year -- 1958 -- the group 
had two gold records, both based on older songs: "Twilight Time" and "Smoke 
Gets in Your Eyes." 
</P>
<P>
The Platters were formed by Herbert Reed in 1953 and originally included Reed, 
Robi, Lynch and Tony Williams. Later a woman, Zola Taylor, was added. 
</P>
<P>
They came under the management of Buck Ram, who was looking for a group to 
record some of the songs he had written. One of them was "Only You," and the 
success saga began. 
</P>
<P>
Franchesca Robi said her father had continued to perform until his health 
failed several months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Robi is also survived by his wife, Martha; two sons; another daughter, and 
three grandchildren.

TAX BOARD MEMBER CHANGES MIND ON REFORM

Conway Collis, who has amassed more campaign funds than any other member 
elected to the Board of Equalization, began promoting legislation Friday that 
would prohibit board members from participating in decisions affecting 
political contributors. 
</P>
<P>
Collis, a Democrat and an opponent of similar legislation in the past, said he 
decided to push for restrictions on campaign financing after it became apparent 
that public confidence in the tax board had been shaken by an FBI investigation 
of one member and another member's accusations that campaign contributions were 
influencing decisions. Collis' own records were subpoenaed in December as part 
of that probe. 
</P>
<P>
The public attention on campaign contributions, he said, had become so intense 
that the issue was overshadowing his attempts to reform board procedures, 
making it easier for taxpayers to lodge appeals, and was giving impetus to 
other legislation that would eliminate the elected board. 
</P>
<P>
The normally obscure board administers and enforces business taxes. It is made 
up of four members elected by districts, and the state controller, who is an ex 
officio voting member. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that in fact elected officials that I have seen are able to make sound 
substantive decisions regardless of whether or not they have received a 
campaign contributions, but the campaign contribution creates an appearance of 
favoritism that undermines public confidence in the decisions," Collis said in 
an interview. "For that reason I think it's important to eliminate those 
contributions." 
</P>
<P>
His proposal, to be introduced next week by Assemblyman Elihu Harris 
(D-Oakland), would prohibit members from voting on matters affecting those who 
had contributed to their campaigns in the previous 12 months. It would also 
prohibit Board of Equalization members from accepting contributions from any 
person or business that they had reason to believe would have a case before 
them within the next year. 
</P>
<P>
"This provision would have the effect of outlawing any contributions from 
utilities and railroads," Collis said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, however, drew whoops of laughter from board member William 
Bennett, who refuses to accept campaign contributions, and state Sen. Quentin 
Kopp, (I-San Francisco), who tried unsuccessfully to pass similar legislation 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Collis) must have invented the word hypocrite," Kopp said. "He was the 
only board member who testified against my bill last year -- how it was unfair, 
how no such similar rules applied to judges. I remember his testimony." 
</P>
<P>
Kopp has since proposed legislation that would eliminate the board and create a 
California tax court to hear appeals by individuals and corporate taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
Added Bennett: "How startling and delightful. There's no sinner without 
redemption. Now I assume he's going to make substantial refunds to the oil 
companies, the public utilities and the banks which have contributed to him so 
generously." 
</P>
<P>
It was Bennett who bitterly complained that campaign contributions were 
influencing board decisions, particularly in cases involving utility companies. 
Collis said he stopped voting two years ago on matters affecting his 
contributors to avoid conflicts of interest. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI's investigation has also focused on the tax breaks granted by the 
board's majority to corporations that had given campaign donations to some 
board members. 
</P>
<P>
Although federal investigators collected documents from his office in the 
course of that probe, Collis said he has since been assured by the U.S. 
attorney's office that he is not a target of the investigation. U.S. Atty. 
David Levi declined to confirm or deny the statement.

PSYCHIATRIC EXAM ORDERED FOR MOTHER WHO KILLED HER BABY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

The judge who declared that Sheryl Lynn Massip was temporarily insane when she 
killed her infant son Friday ordered the Anaheim woman to undergo a preliminary 
review of her psychiatric condition to determine whether she should be confined 
to a state mental institution. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Orange County Superior Court Judge Robert R. Fitzgerald 
answered those who have attacked his extraordinary decision six weeks ago 
finding Massip not guilty by reason of insanity in a brutal killing that her 
lawyers blamed on an extreme form of the "baby blues." 
</P>
<P>
Overturning a jury's murder verdict, Fitzgerald ruled Dec. 23 that the new 
mother was suffering from postpartum psychosis and was not responsible for her 
actions when she ran over her 6-week-old son with the family car in April, 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
Massip, 24, still could face up to 11 years in a state mental institution. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzgerald's decision sparked a pending appeal from county prosecutors and 
alarmed others in the legal community who feared that it signaled an 
unwarranted expansion of judicial power. It also produced more than 60 letters 
to the judge, some of which sharply attacked his position and called for his 
ouster. 
</P>
<P>
Addressing those who have challenged the existence of postpartum psychosis, 
Fitzgerald said Friday: "It's my belief that you're simply not paying attention 
to the current medical knowledge. And to the people that think I should step 
down, I tell you a resounding 'no.' I won't do that." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzgerald, a Superior Court judge since 1980, is up for reelection in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Later, the judge ordered county health professionals to complete a preliminary 
review of Massip's mental condition by the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
Postpartum psychosis is thought to cause intense anxiety, delusions and 
hallucinations and even violence in about one to three of every 1,000 new 
mothers, researchers say.

COLUMNIST MISSED MARK WITH CABLE 'GLITCH' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If Scott Ostler (Jan. 23) bothered to call Century Cable, he'd know that the 
broadcast of a TV theme song and an anti-Semitic remark over the Super Bowl 
audio was not a "glitch" from the local cable company, as he wrote, but pirate 
broadcasters illegally tapping into the audio signal. 
</P>
<P>
It bothers me that Ostler should rate an offensive anti-Semitic statement as 
being of so little consequence that he was able to forget about it in the 
pursuit of a cute lead. That's pretty sloppy. It also makes me wonder if he 
agrees with those slugs. To me, his editorial omission indicates his tacit 
assent.

To rate a place on the NBA all-time starting team, a player must be impressive

Two of Scott Ostler's recent all-time picks, Magic Johnson and Larry Bird, are 
approaching serious all-time consideration. 
</P>
<P>
However, Michael Jordan, another of Ostler's selections, has less than four 
full seasons in the NBA. So far, Jordan is a flash in the pan in comparison to 
Jerry West and Oscar Robertson.

PLANT OF THE WEEK: LIRIOPE MUSCARI; 
</P>
<P>
LILY TURF EVERGREEN PERENNIAL WITH VIOLET FLOWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It's easy to overlook Liriope muscari, to dismiss it as not quite colorful or 
dramatic enough. But one of the most effective shade landscapes I've ever seen 
was a simple stone path around the north side of a house, the path bordered 
with more than a dozen liriopes in full purple bloom. They were gorgeous -- 
exotic and practical. 
</P>
<P>
Liriope is a shade-loving, blooming alternative to the ubiquitous impatiens. 
Unlike impatiens, however, liriope also does well in the sun (except in the 
hotter desert areas). There are several varieties with variations in flower and 
leaf color, but all range from about 12 inches to 18 inches in height and all 
have shiny black berries after flowering. Those with variegated leaves -- 
Silvery Sunproof, Variegata and Gold Banded -- bring a sense of shimmery light 
to shaded areas. 
</P>
<P>
Planted in sun, liriope probably will need at least average water, but in the 
shade it can get by with less. The flowers, resembling grape hyacinths, look 
good in a mixed bed or lined up as an edging. They require average soil and 
little care; just cut them back in winter or spring if they look shabby. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the variegated-leaf varieties, look for Majestic, with an 
abundance of dark violet flowers borne above green leaves, and Big Blue, with 
deep-green leaves and lavender flowers. If you have difficulty finding these 
locally, most of them can be found in the Wayside Gardens (Hodges, S.C.) and 
Burpee Ornamental Gardens (Warminster, Pa.) catalogues. Also, for the patient 
adventurer, Park Seed Co. (Greenwood, S.C.) carries Liriope muscari Exiliflora 
seeds. JUDITH SIMS

GARDENING: TRYING NEW ROSE VARIETIES? HERE'S GOOD PLANTING ADVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ELLEN GUFFEY, Free-lance writer Mary Ellen Guffey grows garden roses in 
Malibu. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rose growers often fall into two categories: exhibitors and gardeners. 
Exhibitors lavish all their attention and resources on producing a few perfect 
long-stemmed, classic blossoms. 
</P>
<P>
Like parents of prodigies, exhibitors tolerate eccentric behavior and indulge 
crazy demands to coax perfect blooms. 
</P>
<P>
Gardeners, on the other hand, are less compulsive about their roses. Their 
desires are more functional: they want roses that grow easily, look relatively 
good in the garden, and/or produce satisfying bouquets. They can't bear to 
disbud because they treasure every blossom, even short-stemmed ones that have 
to be floated. 
</P>
<P>
Recognizing these disparate camps, the American Rose Society annually polls its 
members asking them to rate new roses in two categories: exhibition and garden 
display. The results of this survey appear in "Proof of the Pudding," the 
current edition that includes the ratings for 1987, 1988 and 1989 hybrid teas 
(HT), grandifloras (GR), floribundas (F) and shrubs (S). 
</P>
<P>
I was particularly interested in the garden ratings, because my roses give me 
much pleasure but would rarely win blue ribbons. At the top of the list 
receiving the highest rating was Sexy Rexy, a new floribunda with profuse 
sprays of multipetaled, petite pink blooms. Other roses that ranked high for 
garden display were Mikado (HT), Touch of Class (HT), Prima Donna (GR), Bonica 
(S) and Cary Grant (HT). 
</P>
<P>
The best parts of "Proof of the Pudding," however, are the candid moments of 
rosarians regarding the new roses. They pull no punches, reporting good and bad 
qualities, something you'll never find in catalogue descriptions. For a copy of 
"Proof," send a $2.50 check made out to the American Rose Society, to Luis T. 
Desamero, Editor, 3053 Laurel Canyon Blvd., Studio City 91604. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Planting Bare-Root Roses 
</P>
<P>
After reading about these wonderful new roses, I got the urge to remove a 
number of bushes that are no longer producing well in my garden and replace 
them with selections from the "Proof" list. 
</P>
<P>
Although I'm not growing for exhibition, I do want my new bare-root roses to 
get off to a good start. So I asked an expert how he plants his roses, and I 
was startled by some of his advice. Thomas Cairns, who was recently recognized 
by the American Rose Society as Exhibitor of the Year for his outstanding roses 
at local and national shows, provided the following instructions (and comments) 
for planting bare-root roses in Southern California: 
</P>
<P>
Begin by digging a big hole and preparing the soil before buying your roses. 
(Does it make sense to put a $10 rose in a 25-cent hole?) Amend the soil with 
one-third peat moss and one-third nitrohumus. (Don't stint on start-up costs. 
First- and second-year performance depends on how well roses are planted and 
tended during the critical first four weeks.) Water the holes and leave them 
alone until planting time. 
</P>
<P>
After purchasing your roses, remove the wrappings. Prune any broken or damaged 
roots but do not prune the canes just yet. Soak the bushes one to two days in a 
5-gallon container filled with water and 1 tablespoon of Vitamin B-1. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Critical Initial Period 
</P>
<P>
Place one cup of blood and bone meal at the bottom of each hole. Mound the soil 
at the bottom of the hole into a small pyramid. Arrange the roots over it so 
that the bud union is 1 or 2 inches above the soil level. (Don't bury a rose's 
bud union in Southern California!) 
</P>
<P>
Now, mound soil or mulch 6 to 8 inches above the bud union -- to protect it and 
the newly emerging buds from excessive transpiration. (Don't let them dry out 
during this critical initial period before their roots are established.) Some 
nurseries provide a paper cone to be filled with soil to protect the bud union 
and lower canes. 
</P>
<P>
Don't prune the bush just yet, because this causes unnecessary transpiration at 
a time when the roots can't handle it. Water the newly planted bush. After 
three to four weeks, spread 1 cup of rose fertilizer around the surface of the 
newly planted rose. Then remove the mounded soil/mulch and mix it with the 
fertilizer, helping to cover up the conspicuous granules. Now prune the canes 
lightly. 
</P>
<P>
This routine, Cairns says, speeds a bare root rose to early productivity and 
ensures long life.

DAY HIKE: GREAT VIEWS ON THE VALLEY SIDE OF THE SANTA MONICAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wilacre Park, Fryman Overlook, Coldwater Canyon Park and Franklin Canyon Ranch 
-- these four recreation areas comprise Cross Mountain Park. Individually and 
collectively, they contribute some much-needed breathing room to the San 
Fernando Valley side of the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Betty P. Dearing Trail -- or Dearing Mountain Trail, as it's usually called -- 
connects Fryman Overlook with Coldwater Canyon Park and Wilacre Park. The trail 
honors a determined conservationist for her efforts to create a trail across 
the Santa Monica Mountains from Los Angeles to the sea. 
</P>
<P>
The trail begins in the wilds of Studio City in Wilacre Park, the former estate 
of silent-movie cowboy Will Acres. The land was saved from the bulldozer by 
environmentalists and the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy in 1982. From the 
park's high points, great clear-day vistas of the San Fernando Valley await the 
urban mountaineer. 
</P>
<P>
The trail continues to Fryman Overlook on Mulholland Drive, where the 
aforementioned valley vistas are even more terrific. From the overlook, you can 
follow a path and a suburban street back to Wilacre Park. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TreePeople Outpost 
</P>
<P>
Between the panoramic viewpoints is Coldwater Canyon Park, headquarters of 
TreePeople. The group's well-publicized tree-planting campaign has contributed 
a great deal to the greening of Los Angeles. You can learn about TreePeople's 
work by visiting its exhibits, landscaping display, nursery and headquarters. 
And you can learn about the trees by taking Magic Forest Nature Trail, which 
winds through the preserve. 
</P>
<P>
Along Dearing Mountain Trail, you'll observe two human alterations of the 
landscape. One alteration is botanical; many exotic trees and shrubs grow on 
the steep slopes of Coldwater and Fryman canyons. TreePeople headquarters once 
was Fire Station 108, built by the Los Angeles Fire Department in 1923. During 
the years the firefighters were in residence, eucalyptus, pine and many other 
kinds of non-native trees were planted in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Another alteration is the terracing of hillsides to create pads for the 
construction of homes. Building on steep slopes is, of course, prevalent in 
canyons all over Southern California, but in the Coldwater-Laurel Canyon area 
it has reached ridiculous heights. The hiker looks up at some truly astonishing 
residences -- homes on stilts, homes built stairstep-like down precipitous 
canyon walls, homes that seem certain to slide down to Ventura Boulevard after 
the first good rain. 
</P>
<P>
Directions to trailhead: From the Ventura Freeway in Studio City, exit on 
Laurel Canyon Boulevard and drive south 1 1/2 miles to Fryman Road. Turn right 
and immediately park. The unsigned trail begins at a yellow vehicle gate. 
</P>
<P>
The hike: Ascend the asphalt road past bay laurel and towering toyon, walnut 
trees and assorted planted pines. The road retires to dirt and soon proffers 
those terrific views of the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
At a wide spot in the road, a bit more than a mile from the trailhead, you'll 
intersect Coldwater Canyon Park's Magic Forest Trail. You may continue on 
Dearing Mountain Trail, still a dirt road at this point. If you want a little 
break, detour right on the park's nature trail. Ascend one of the handsome 
stone staircases, built by the WPA in the 1930s, to the domain of the 
TreePeople. After learning about the group's tree-planting efforts, rejoin 
Dearing Mountain Trail. 
</P>
<P>
A half-mile descent on the trail brings you past the backside of some homes, a 
yellow vehicle gate, and down to Iredell Street. Walk 50 yards on the street 
and rejoin Dearing Mountain Trail at another yellow gate. After 100 yards, the 
trail junctions. Stay left and begin a short but very steep ascent up a 
terraced slope. 
</P>
<P>
The trail then descends to the head of a ravine that's watered by a seasonal 
creek and shaded by towering eucalyptuses. Frogs provide musical accompaniment 
to the path, which traverses the canyon wall, then dips again to the bottom of 
another ravine. Unfortunately, this ravine and its tiny creek are below one of 
Mulholland Drive's "deadman's curves" and has become the final resting place 
for a dozen wrecked autos. Minus the junkyard, this little dell would be a 
pretty spot. 
</P>
<P>
The trail ascends moderately up the chaparral-covered south wall of Fryman 
Canyon to Mulholland Drive and Fryman Overlook. From the overlook, you can see 
much of the San Fernando Valley. Beyond the valley, smog-free views also take 
in the Verdugo, Santa Susana and San Gabriel mountain ranges. 
</P>
<P>
Fryman Overlook displays two commemorative plaques. One praises Mulholland 
Drive, brainchild of William Mulholland, chief engineer of the Los Angeles 
Department of Water and Power, who in 1913 proposed a 55-mile scenic road 
through the Santa Monica Mountains. Betty P. Dearing (1917-1977) is honored for 
her efforts to "create a nature walk from Los Angeles to the sea." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Roads Outdid Trails 
</P>
<P>
Road builders have been more successful than trail builders in the Santa 
Monicas. While Mulholland Drive was constructed in the early 1920s, the 
Backbone Trail has yet to be completed. 
</P>
<P>
Physical fitness fans not content with the workout afforded by this hike can 
proceed to Fryman Overlook's exercise course. The less energetic will head for 
home. 
</P>
<P>
Return a short distance on Dearing Mountain Trail to a junction; instead of 
descending the way you came, keep straight and follow the sage- and toyon-lined 
path as it heads east below Mulholland Drive. The trail turns north, then east 
again and soon junctions. 
</P>
<P>
Take the left fork and descend steeply down a mustard-cloaked hillside to a 
dirt fire road. Turn left on the fire road, which, after a 100 yards, continues 
as a concrete path and descends to a yellow gate at the corner of Dona Maria 
Drive and Fryman Road. Follow Fryman Road three-fourths of a mile to the 
trailhead at Wilacre Park. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dearing Mountain Trail 
</P>
<P>
Wilacre Park to Coldwater Canyon Park: 2 1/2 miles round trip; 500-foot 
elevation gain. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilacre Park to Fryman Overlook: 6 miles round trip; 700-foot elevation gain.

FAMILY SPOTS: SPORTS ARENA BEING GROOMED FOR DOG SHOW ON SUNDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLEN MELINKOFF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 2,500 dogs, representing 138 breeds, will compete for prizes at 
Sunday's All Breed Dog Show and Obedience Trials at the Los Angeles Sports 
Arena. For families who are thinking about getting a dog, this is a chance to 
size up the possibilities and talk with pet owners about the advantages and 
disadvantages of different breeds. 
</P>
<P>
Around the arena, owners will be busy grooming and cajoling their charges into 
center-ring readiness. 
</P>
<P>
Between judgings, a troupe of Dobermans will jump through hoops and barrels and 
will scale walls. In the scent relay, teams of dogs will jump over hurdles and 
locate the jackets of their owners. There will also be a demonstration of how 
dogs herd farm animals. 
</P>
<P>
Other attractions include the appearance of Warren Eckstein, radio host of "Pet 
Show," who will answer behavioral questions about dogs (as well as cats, pigs 
and goldfish, if he's asked); free veterinary advice; a demonstration of how 
4-H youngsters help train puppies to become guide dogs, and more than 70 
vendors selling dog paraphernalia. A computer is provided for visitors' use to 
find out which breeds would best suit their life styles. 
</P>
<P>
Show hours are 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. Admission: adults, $4.50; children, $1. 
Information: (818) 789-8350.

 MEASLES OUTBREAK CLAIMS 2 CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An outbreak of measles among members of a Long Beach church has left two 
children dead, 12 hospitalized and two more sick at home. 
</P>
<P>
"I anticipate a few more cases," said Bob Salcido, senior epidemiologist with 
the Long Beach Department of Health and Human Services. "Usually it comes in 
waves." 
</P>
<P>
The 16 stricken children -- ranging in age from 6 months to 13 years -- are all 
of Samoan ancestry and associated with United Samoan Assembly of God in Long 
Beach, Salcido said. The two who died, he said, were ages 3 and 19 months. 
Salcido would not release the children's names. 
</P>
<P>
At least six of the stricken children had not been immunized against the 
disease, Salcido said.

 CITY ATTORNEY WINS ROUND IN DRUG FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Atty. James K. Hahn, foiled by the court Jan. 18 in his 
immediate attempt to halt drug dealing at six South Los Angeles locations, has 
won agreement from owners of two of the houses to evict or bar any tenants or 
visitors arrested for possession or sale of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Hahn obtained a preliminary injunction, stipulated to by the owner 
of a home at 2179 W. 21st St., where, Hahn said, narcotics trafficking has gone 
on despite numerous arrests. The injunction requires the homeowner to install 
self-locking doors, exterior lighting and a self-locking fence. Under the 
agreement, no one but the owner's immediate family members may live in the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the owners of a house at 1733 Longwood Ave. agreed to evict their 
tenant, who had been arrested for possession of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn's deputies in his new Narcotics Abatement Unit are scheduled to appear 
Feb. 16 before Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Kurt Lewin seeking preliminary 
injunctions in the four other cases. 
</P>
<P>
Lewin denied Hahn's request for temporary restraining orders on the day Hahn 
announced the crackdown on "cesspools of drug dealing" and filed the cases.

 DRIVER IN FATAL CRASH WON'T BE CHARGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County district attorney's office has announced that it will 
not prosecute a 70-year-old Sherman Oaks driver whose car rammed into a crowded 
Monterey Park restaurant, crushing two people to death and injuring the driver 
and four others. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Don Eastman called the Dec. 28 accident a tragedy but said 
he concluded after a review of the case that driver Rudy D'Agostin committed no 
crime. It is unclear why D'Agostin lost control of his car and crashed into the 
Four Happiness Restaurant on Garfield Avenue, Eastman said, although "age and 
medical problems caused (D'Agostin) to really have no idea what he was doing." 
</P>
<P>
It is possible, Eastman said, that D'Agostin had suffered a mild stroke before 
the accident. He had been missing from home for two days, Eastman said, and at 
1:35 a.m., about 15 hours before the accident, a Burbank policeman had stopped 
D'Agostin for running a stop sign. 
</P>
<P>
Tests showed that D'Agostin was not intoxicated, he said.

 WOMAN, 85, BACKS CAR INTO POOL, DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An 85-year old woman died Friday when she backed her Jaguar out of its garage 
at her Brentwood home and somehow plunged into the back yard swimming pool, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they were not sure whether she died from drowning or from injuries 
suffered in the accident in the 100 block of North Bristol Avenue. The woman's 
identity was not released pending notification of relatives. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Officer John Lopata, who was first on the scene, found the 
woman trapped in the auto, dived into the pool, forced the door open and pulled 
her out of the pool. But arriving paramedics pronounced her dead. 
</P>
<P>
"She may have put her foot on the accelerator instead of the brake," Police 
Sgt. Rick Walker said.

DOCTOR CHARGED IN MURDER FOR PROFIT CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG SMITH and LISA TURNER, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Glendale physician was arrested on suspicion of murder Friday, concluding an 
eight-month investigation into the death of a man whose body allegedly was used 
to collect $1 million in life insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale police arrested Richard P. Boggs, 55, in the parking lot outside his 
office on North Central Avenue shortly after noon as Los Angeles County 
prosecutors were filing murder, conspiracy and insurance fraud charges against 
him. 
</P>
<P>
Also charged in the scheme were two Ohio businessmen, Melvin Eugene Hanson, 47, 
and John Barrett Hawkins, 29, owners of a retail clothing firm in Columbus. 
</P>
<P>
The murder charges against the three men include two special allegations of 
murder for financial gain and aiding and abetting a murder for financial gain, 
meaning that all three could be sentenced to death if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
The case, which investigators said came close to being a perfect crime, 
revolves around the death of Ellis Henry Greene, 32, of North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Heart Disease Blamed 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said Greene died in Boggs' office early on the morning of April 
16, 1988, of inflammation of the heart. Boggs, however, identified the body as 
that of Hanson. Hanson's partner, Hawkins, then claimed the body from the Los 
Angeles coroner's office and had it cremated. He later collected $1 million 
from Farmers New World Life Insurance of Washington on a policy carried by 
Hanson. 
</P>
<P>
Boggs had reported the cause of death as heart failure, and the coroner's 
office accepted that conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
The Glendale Police Department began an investigation in June after an inquiry 
from the insurance company led them to discover that Hanson's fingerprints, 
obtained through the Ohio Department of Motor Vehicles, did not match those of 
the dead man. 
</P>
<P>
The body was later identified as that of Greene, who had lived with an aunt in 
North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Boggs told investigators at the time that Greene had been his patient for 
several years, but he said he knew the man as Hanson. 
</P>
<P>
In a search of the doctor's office last November, Glendale police found a stun 
gun, a weapon commonly used by police to disable suspects with an electric 
charge. Deputy Dist. Atty. Al MacKenzie of the district attorney's major fraud 
unit said the use of a stun gun as a murder weapon is still under 
investigation, and Boggs was charged Friday with assault with a stun gun. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators for several agencies embarked on what a spokesman described 
Friday as "a painstaking labor of love" to reconstruct every move from the last 
time Greene was seen alive the night before his death to the present. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Combined Effort 
</P>
<P>
Investigators for the FBI, the fraud bureau of the California Department of 
Insurance, the Glendale police and the Los Angeles county coroner's office 
worked on the case with officials from Columbus, MacKenzie said. 
</P>
<P>
A break in the case occurred Monday when Hanson, who already had been charged 
in Columbus with insurance fraud, was arrested by customs officials at the 
Dallas-Ft. Worth airport. He was carrying a fraudulent passport as he attempted 
to return to this country from Mexico, authorities said. He was returned to 
Ohio and is being held in Franklin County Jail. Hawkins is still the object of 
a nationwide manhunt. 
</P>
<P>
Boggs, who was under 24-hour surveillance by Glendale police several days 
before his arrest, is being held without bail in the Glendale Jail. He is 
scheduled to be arraigned Monday in Los Angeles Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
MacKenzie said Los Angeles and Columbus officials are discussing whether Hanson 
will be extradited to California.

L.A. GETS A TASTE OF ARCTIC WEATHER FROM CHILLY RAIN

Southern Californians scurried for umbrellas and sweaters Friday as Arctic 
winds dropped temperatures into the 40s and low 50s along the coast and brought 
light snow to mountain resorts and passes. 
</P>
<P>
"We dress a little warmer, with the thermals of course," said Officer Mark Ehly 
of the California Highway Patrol's Ft. Tejon station, located along Interstate 
5 in the Tehachapi Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
It was warmer, but still cloudy and wet at Long Beach Harbor, where a few 
intrepid sailors braved the choppy seas to get in a little boating. 
</P>
<P>
"Not a bad day to sail, if you don't mind getting wet," remarked Tony Burt of 
the Pacific Sailing Club as he looked out from his office toward the Queen Mary 
and the Pacific Ocean. "But personally, I think it's a day to stay inside by 
the fire." 
</P>
<P>
About 0.32 of an inch of rain had fallen at the Los Angeles Civic Center by 7 
p.m. Friday, and a forecast of a low of 47 degrees for Friday night prompted 
city officials to announce that they would open armories and recreation centers 
near downtown Los Angeles to shelter the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
More than 700 cots will be available through the weekend at four downtown 
recreation centers, said George Pallas, of the city homeless coordination unit. 
Armories in Van Nuys and West Los Angeles will also be open. 
</P>
<P>
Three homeless men and a woman returned Friday to an abandoned Westlake home 
where the night before they had built a campfire in the living room to keep 
warm. The fire got out of hand, blackening much of the house. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to stay in the garage now," a homeless man said as he surveyed the 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Rain Coming 
</P>
<P>
The forecast for the Los Angeles Basin for today calls for periods of rain and 
maximum temperatures in the low to mid-50s, with rain tapering to showers 
tonight, said Dave Beusterien of Weather Data Inc., which provides forecasts to 
The Times. Variable clouds with a chance of showers were forecast for Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
More and heavier snow was predicted for today in Southern California mountain 
areas, with snow levels dropping to 5,000 feet today and 3,000 feet Sunday, 
Beusterien said. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, stores selling warm clothes and ski equipment were doing a 
brisk trade Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"We're completely sold out for rentals," said Matt Byran, a salesman at Craig's 
Snow Job in West Los Angeles. "Hard goods like skis go around Christmas. The 
clothing goes right now." 
</P>
<P>
A light snow had already begun to fall at Lake Arrowhead at about 2 p.m. 
Friday, and residents said they were going to leave water faucets dripping to 
keep pipes from freezing. 
</P>
<P>
Closer to sea level, light rains caused serious problems for freeway commuters. 
</P>
<P>
Four crashes involving 24 vehicles, including a tanker truck, closed all four 
lanes on the westbound Ventura Freeway in Calabasas and backed up cars for 
miles at the height of the rush-hour commute. 
</P>
<P>
The crash occurred about 2:15 p.m. near Las Virgenes Road. At one point, 
traffic completely stopped for almost five miles. 
</P>
<P>
Scores of drivers poured on to surface streets in search of alternate routes, 
many of them driving north to the Simi Valley Freeway to find a way into 
Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a mess," said Officer Bob Weaver of the California Highway Patrol.

1ST CHARGE FILED IN LAWYERS' ALLEGED INSURANCE FRAUD 
</P>

<P>
Federal authorities Friday filed their first criminal charge in an 
investigation of a purported scheme by Los Angeles lawyers to bilk insurance 
companies out of millions of dollars in legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
Suzanne Rubin, 29, former operator of a court reporting business in Reseda, was 
charged in federal court with a single count of mail fraud. She pleaded not 
guilty at her arraignment, but prosecutors said she is expected to enter a 
guilty plea next week as part of a plea agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Rubin and her lawyer declined comment. Prosecutors refused to say if Rubin will 
assist them in their investigation, which has focused on about 15 Los 
Angeles-area lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. William Q. Hayes said only that he "anticipated that more 
(people) will be charged." 
</P>
<P>
The Times reported last month that federal authorities were investigating 
whether the lawyers, paid by insurers to defend policyholders, had schemed to 
prolong litigation and fatten their fees through various maneuvers, including 
the filing of spurious claims against each other's clients. 
</P>
<P>
Although details were sketchy, the charge filed against Rubin was the 
government's first public statement on the nature of the case. It said "Rubin 
and others" had schemed "to defraud the judicial systems of the United States 
and the state of California and numerous insurance companies and to obtain 
money by means of false and fraudulent pretenses." 
</P>
<P>
According to the document, from 1983 to 1988, Rubin and the others fraudulently 
represented that litigants in various lawsuits "were represented by independent 
attorneys," when in fact those attorneys worked together as part of "a network 
. . . with interlocking financial and professional interests." The cases were 
in Los Angeles, San Diego and Orange counties, and the investigation was 
conducted by federal authorities here. 
</P>
<P>
Rubin was charged in a criminal information, usually filed in lieu of an 
indictment when a defendant plans to enter a plea. 
</P>
<P>
According to the four-page information, Rubin's former court reporting service, 
International Court Reporters, was kept busy taking depositions for the 
lawyers, including one the document called merely "the organizing attorney." 
The reference was to West Los Angeles lawyer Lynn Boyd Stites, according to 
well-placed sources. Stites could not be reached for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The document said that at the request of the organizing attorney, Rubin began 
supervising "the operations and billing practices" of two other law firms that 
had "a secret financial connection with the organizing attorney." 
</P>
<P>
The mail fraud count involved a bill purportedly mailed by Rubin to an 
insurance company on behalf of Lewis Koss, a Calabasas lawyer, in March, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Koss could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyers being investigated have concentrated on an arcane area of insurance 
law. They work as defense lawyers in a type of case in which insurance 
companies must pay them to defend policyholders but lose the right to pick the 
lawyers or direct defense strategy. 
</P>
<P>
The situation arises when an insurer and policyholder disagree on whether legal 
claims against the policyholder are all covered by insurance. 
</P>
<P>
The federal investigation has paralleled civil fraud suits filed by insurance 
companies against some of the lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
Rubin's deposition was taken in December in one of the cases filed by USF&amp;G 
against Stites. Lawyers for USF&amp;G asked Rubin if any of the lawyers had a 
financial interest in her court reporting business. She refused to answer the 
question and many others, citing her 5th Amendment protection against 
self-incrimination.

TV ACTOR JAILED AFTER HE ALLEGEDLY SHOT MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK JONES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Actor Todd Bridges, who portrayed the older brother on the "Diff'rent Strokes" 
television series, was in the Parker Center jail Friday after he allegedly shot 
and wounded another man in a South-Central Los Angeles house identified by 
police as a drug hangout. 
</P>
<P>
Officers said the 23-year-old Bridges and a companion, Harvey Duckett, 30, were 
arrested Thursday night a short distance from the house in the 300 block of 
West 65th Street where Kenneth Clay, 25, was shot at least five times. 
</P>
<P>
It was Bridges' second arrest in as many weeks at the same location. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 25, Bridges was arrested on suspicion of possessing cocaine at the 
house, where there have been numerous drug incidents, said Officer Bill Frio, a 
Police Department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
At Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center, where he was in serious but 
stable condition, Clay told Community Resources Against Street Hoodlums 
detectives that Bridges did the shooting, officials reported. 
</P>
<P>
Clay was struck twice in his right shoulder, once under the left armpit, in the 
upper lip and in the right side of his neck, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives said that he told them he was taking care of the vacant house and 
that he went there when neighbors reported "burglars." Police said he 
apparently found Bridges and Duckett, argued with them and was shot. 
</P>
<P>
Officers said that the pair fled but that Clay furnished a description of their 
automobile. Newton anti-gang officers took them into custody a short time 
later. Newton Division Sgt. Doug Tantee said police also seized a .22-caliber 
handgun and a shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
The actor, who played the part of Gary Coleman's older brother on "Diff'rent 
Strokes" from 1978 to 1986, has had trouble with the law for several years. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, he was arrested by Beverly Hills police for carrying a loaded, 
concealed .45-caliber handgun in his car. He pleaded guilty, was fined $240 and 
placed on one-year probation. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, he was sentenced to a year in jail for making a bomb threat against a 
San Fernando Valley car customizer with whom he had argued over the latter's 
demands for payment in advance because several of the actor's checks had 
bounced. A homemade pipe bomb went off in a car owned by the other man. 
</P>
<P>
Bridges was originally charged with possessing explosives with intent to injure 
or intimidate but pleaded guilty to the lesser bomb-threat charge on the 
grounds that a trial would hurt his career. 
</P>
<P>
The year in jail was suspended pending psychiatric treatment. Bridges was put 
on three-years' probation, fined $2,500 and ordered to make $6,000 restitution. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, he told the judge that he "had trouble handling all the pressure" 
of fame and his parents' divorce. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, Bridges was arrested for reckless driving in Northridge when, 
officers said, they found him going 80 m.p.h.. Two days earlier, according to 
police, Bridges' family told them that he was suicidal and possibly armed. 
</P>
<P>
Bridges began acting at the age of 6. He was Loomis on the "Fish" television 
series in 1977 and 1978, then went on to do "Diff'rent Strokes." 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, he and Duckett were being held without bail.

NAACP ASKS U.S. TO PROBE ALLEGED KKK INFLUENCE AT L.A. CENTRAL JAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People called Friday for a 
federal investigation into reports of racial tension at the Los Angeles County 
Central Jail, where two crosses allegedly were burned by white deputies in 
quarters housing black gang members. 
</P>
<P>
James Martin, director of the NAACP's western region, said his organization has 
been told by inmates and unnamed deputies that some of the white jailers belong 
to the Ku Klux Klan, the white supremacy organization that has made burning 
crosses a symbol of racial hatred. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the allegation, Martin said there is no "solid evidence" any jail 
deputies are KKK members. Nonetheless, he told a press conference that the 
"NAACP is deeply concerned that KKK influence continues to exist in the Los 
Angeles County Jail. The Los Angeles NAACP . . . has contacted the (U.S.) 
attorney general with a request that they look into the situation." 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Capt. William Hinkle, commander of the 6,800-inmate jail, said 
Martin's statement is the first either he or members of his staff have heard of 
the KKK allegations, and he expressed doubt. 
</P>
<P>
"I spend a lot of time in the jail talking to inmates," Hinkle said. "To have 
that going on without coming to the surface is kind of hard to believe." 
</P>
<P>
The NAACP began to investigate jail conditions in December after receiving 
several letters, including one signed by 22 black gang members, complaining of 
misconduct and racial harassment, Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department has begun an internal investigation into allegations 
of cross-burnings and other misconduct by deputies on the floors where gang 
members are kept. Four deputies and a sergeant were reassigned out of the jail 
this week after being accused of using "excessive force." The FBI this week 
began a separate investigation into the cross-burning allegations, which first 
surfaced in sworn testimony at an unrelated Civil Service hearing last month.

Max Laemmle, the Man Who Loved Movies, was a major force in Los Angeles film 
culture, not only for the films he presented but for his warm and generous 
collaboration with other film organizations. 
</P>
<P>
It was with the help of Laemmle (who died Jan. 20) that the American Film 
Institute was able to reorganize the Los Angeles International Film Festival in 
1987 (replacing Filmex) and present it at his Los Feliz Cinema. His 
collaboration with the AFI continued in specialized festivals at his Santa 
Monica Cinema devoted to European, British, U.S. independent and documentary 
films. He will be greatly missed.

"Brilliant . . . yeah, you're brilliant . . . it's brilliant." 
</P>
<P>
Brilliant isn't the kind of word you expect to hear from rappers, who generally 
are bent on trying to prove how tough they are and often seem ready to pick a 
fight. But it's a favorite of Sandra Lawrence, who with her younger sister 
Timmy makes up the Wee Papa Girls, a London-based rap act that has been a hit 
in England and makes its Los Angeles concert debut Thursday at the Palace in 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"We're the nice posse," says Lawrence, 23, referring to the "crew" of friends 
and associates she and Timmy, 19, have assembled in London. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some clubs we go to in London that have all these hard crews, and 
it's a bit frightening," she says. "If we go we get stared at, 'cause we just 
go there to grit our teeth and have a good time. It doesn't have to be like 
that. But you have ignorant people who think it is like that." 
</P>
<P>
Not only is the Wee Papa Girls' attitude a bit against the grain, so is their 
music. Though inspired by American hip-hop styles, the songs on the new album, 
descriptively titled "The Beat, the Rhyme, the Noise" (including a version of 
George Michael's "Faith"), utilize the hyperactively pulsating foundation known 
in England as "house" music. Clever production touches by the team of Two Men 
and a Drum Machine (actually Andy Cox and David Steele of the group Fine Young 
Cannibals) give the music more of a real song sense than much rap pieces have. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of English rappers like to pretend they're L. L. Cool J or Public Enemy, 
which is fine because a lot of people admire them," Sandra Lawrence says. "But 
we've got another side of English rappers who want to have their own style. 
We're not sure what category to put us under. We're not pop, but we're not that 
hard. We're trying to think of a fun word to use."

FACES . . .: A PEACH OF A PART 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Nellie Melba -- the soprano who took her stage name from Melbourne and gave it 
to peach desserts and toast -- was a symbol of Australian national identity as 
much as a cultural icon. As such, she is also becoming a little-understood, 
mythic figure in her homeland. 
</P>
<P>
"We think she has been very much maligned," says Linda Cropper, the actress who 
portrays the tempestuous diva in "Melba," a six-hour, four-part Australian 
miniseries airing Fridays at 9 p.m. on KCET-TV Channel 28 and other PBS 
stations. "People are pretty ignorant about her -- I was one of them. We show 
the scandals, but I know we went all out to do a very truthful thing." 
</P>
<P>
Trained at the National Institute of Dramatic Art, Cropper considers herself 
primarily a stage actress, though she has done other miniseries and has a film, 
"Eden's Lost," showing in Britain. She has never been tempted to sing, however, 
and the voice of another young Australian, Yvonne Kenny, has been dubbed in 
whenever Melba sings in the series. 
</P>
<P>
"The two biggest challenges were the singing -- or the miming -- and the 
aging," Cropper says, "but I love a challenge." 
</P>
<P>
During the course of the series Cropper, who turned 28 in the middle of six 
months of shooting, is Melba from adolescence to old age. 
</P>
<P>
"The padding you can live with," she says, "though it does get hot. It was the 
first time I had worn prosthetic makeup." 
</P>
<P>
The result produced changes on and off the set. "It was very helpful to perform 
with that weight, and the older I got, the more people deferred to me -- even 
friends who knew me well." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the makeup burden while shooting in a hot Australian summer, Cropper 
has no regrets about taking the part. 
</P>
<P>
"I always try to go for a role if it's something that's going to stretch me, or 
just a great script. I like being in a situation where anything can happen."

Rebecca Parris, the Boston-based singer, is in town for a while. Heard during a 
one-night stand Thursday at Nucleus Nuance, she was set for two evenings at 
Alfonse's, closing tonight and will open Tuesday for a five-day run at the 
Director's Lounge of the Registry Hotel in Universal City. 
</P>
<P>
A tall, imposing woman, Parris can claim several of the virtues to which many 
singers aspire: a personal, confident sound, flawless intonation and an often 
dominant jazz feeling. 
</P>
<P>
Like many vocal artists she tends now and then to lag behind the beat. This can 
work well if it doesn't get out of hand, but if during "The Man I Love" the 
trio is already into the "we'll build a little home" passage while the singer 
hasn't quite finished the "Tuesday will be our good news day" line, it can make 
for a disconcerting moment. 
</P>
<P>
The less Parris leaned on her jazz proclivity, the more convincing was her 
impact. Such songs as "Never Let Me Go," "My Romance," "The Island" and Carroll 
Coates' charming waltz "London by Night" were delivered in a full, warm and 
rich manner. On the other hand, "Autumn Leaves" at a ridiculously fast clip was 
strictly a throwaway. 
</P>
<P>
Parris has a slightly too flip personality that detracts from the mood some of 
her songs try to establish. And her backup group lets her down. John Harrison, 
a pianist who came with her from Boston, lacked the light touch and swinging 
jazz beat that could have complemented her. Between this and an occasionally 
over-loud drummer she had problems; in fact, it was a pleasing contrast to hear 
her start one song with just Allen Jackson's bass for accompaniment. 
</P>
<P>
Despite these handicaps, Rebecca Parris deserves the attention of anyone 
looking for fresh and inventive vocal concepts.

STAGE WIRE: ARTISTS RALLY FOR JAILED CZECH PLAYWRIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN SULLIVAN, Times Theater Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When an artist gets arrested for speaking his mind, other artists can be 
counted on to speak theirs. That explains the gathering reaction in the theater 
world to the news that Vaclav Havel is back in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Havel is Czechoslovakia's most distinguished playwright. Los Angeles has seen 
three of his plays -- "A Private View" and "Largo Desolato" at the Mark Taper 
Forum and "The Memorandum" at Company of Angels. He is a pained humorist, 
treating the routine madness of life under a totalitarian regime. 
</P>
<P>
He writes from authority. His arrest in Prague on Jan. 16 was the fourth time 
since the 1960s that he has been jailed for "disturbing the public order." 
</P>
<P>
This time Havel was arrested with 13 other activists for taking part in a 
ceremony in Wenceslaus Square in honor of Jan Palach, a student who had 
immolated himself there during the "Prague Spring" revolt in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
Havel sounds like a lion in the streets. In fact, according to the Taper's 
Gordon Davidson, who met him in Prague last summer, he's as gentle and 
quizzical as his heroes. 
</P>
<P>
"I am simply on the side of truth against lies, of good sense against nonsense 
and of justice against injustice," Havel has written. 
</P>
<P>
American theater people are mobilizing to protest the arrest. A rally was held 
Jan. 23 at the New York Public Theatre, spearheaded by Joseph Papp, who staged 
"The Memorandum" there in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
"Havel was arrested for 'hooliganism,' which is a euphemism for someone who 
protests openly," Papp said. "We must respond instantly." 
</P>
<P>
The Taper is planning a similar event. Davidson delivered Havel's Los Angeles 
Drama Critics' Circle Award for "Largo Desolato" to the playwright last summer 
in Prague. 
</P>
<P>
"I was charmed by him," Davidson said Friday. "He has clocked a lot of mileage 
and he's got a lot of passion about what's happening in his country. But what 
he wanted to talk to me about, as a theater person, was his plays. He hasn't 
seen any of them in full productions since 'The Memorandum."' 
</P>
<P>
KCRW-FM. 89.9 is also involved in the protest. The station aired a BBC 
production of "Largo Desolato" Monday and featured Havel on its monthly 
"Amnesty International Reports" program. 
</P>
<P>
What can readers do to help Havel and his colleagues? Amnesty International 
suggests air-mail letters (45 cents) to this address: Judr. Gustav Husak, 
Prezident CSSR, Praha -- Hrad, Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
For more information call "Amnesty International Reports" at (213) 450-5183. 
</P>
<P>
QUOTE OF THE WEEK: Vaclav Havel -- "If I get involved in anything other than my 
literary work, it flows from my position as a man who is in the public eye and 
is thus duty bound to speak up on certain subjects in a louder voice than one 
who is not."

POP BEAT: BOB MARLEY'S LEGACY MIRED IN ESTATE BATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SNOWDEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Almost eight years after his death, reggae master Bob Marley still stirs 
people's emotions. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, 6,000 fans are expected to gather at the Long Beach Arena for the 
seventh annual Bob Marley Day concert honoring the legacy of Marley, who died 
of cancer on May 11, 1981. The concert, which begins at 2 p.m., features a bill 
headlined by veteran reggae stars Burning Spear and Judy Mowatt. 
</P>
<P>
On a larger scale, the reggae sound that Marley popularized continues to make 
commercial inroads in this country. UB40's "Red Red Wine" recently became the 
first reggae single to top the Billboard pop chart, while Bobby McFerrin's 
"Don't Worry, Be Happy" was another surprise reggae-tinged success. 
</P>
<P>
The "Conscious Party" album by Marley's eldest son, Ziggy, and his Melody 
Makers band sold more than 500,000 copies, and when one of its selections, 
"Tumbling Down," hit the top of Billboard's black chart, Ziggy fulfilled a 
dream of his father's -- reaching the previously reggae-resistant black market. 
</P>
<P>
But Ziggy Marley's success and the increasingly rosy picture for reggae overall 
have camouflaged a bitter court battle over Bob Marley's estate. On Dec. 30, 
Jamaica's Supreme Court approved the $8.2-million sale of the assets of the 
Marley estate -- including the Tuff Gong recording studio in Kingston, the 
merchandising rights to Marley's image and the publishing rights for his songs 
-- to a company headed by Island Records President Chris Blackwell. (The actual 
sale has been stayed pending appeals.) 
</P>
<P>
Top executives at Island Records, the label that released all of Marley's 
albums from 1973 until his death, declined to comment on the situation. 
</P>
<P>
The Jamaican-born Blackwell, who founded Island and championed Marley and 
reggae when both were still unknown quantities on the international pop scene, 
was quoted in the Jan. 21 issue of Billboard magazine as saying: "I just felt I 
was the most appropriate person to buy it and I was the only one willing to 
take on the assets in Jamaica." 
</P>
<P>
But some -- including Marley's mother, Cedella Booker -- have been critical of 
Blackwell's action. 
</P>
<P>
Booker, who unsuccessfully mounted a bid against Blackwell for the estate 
assets, has charged that Blackwell got the assets at a bargain-basement price 
(published reports have put the value at $30 million at the time of Marley's 
death) and also claimed that the sale was insufficiently publicized outside 
Jamaica. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to stop this because no man can buy Bob -- he's priceless," she said 
in an interview. "We do want the estate to stay in the family, and I don't 
think outsiders should take over because it's a legacy that Bob left on the 
earth for his children and the world." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, it was Marley's insistence on living his life according to his 
Rastafarian faith that left his mother, heirs and closest associates vulnerable 
to the manipulations of the "Babylon system" he castigated in his music. Marley 
didn't believe in wills and didn't leave one. 
</P>
<P>
Bad feelings still linger between Marley associates and his widow Rita -- whom 
Jamaican courts removed from her post administering the estate after 
allegations were made that she mishandled the assets. Members of Marley's 
longtime backing band, the Wailers, are currently embroiled in multimillion 
dollar suits against the Marley estate's former attorney and accountant for 
royalties the band members contend are owed them. 
</P>
<P>
And Cedella Booker is in threatened with eviction from her Miami home because 
the title remained in Marley's name -- even though all parties to the dispute 
acknowledge that it was purchased by Marley as a gift for his mother. 
</P>
<P>
"I am disappointed in what has taken place but I still have a lot of room to 
rejoice," Booker said. "As it is said, sorrow may last for a night but joy come 
in at the morning. I know that the day will come when I shall be rejoicing, 
even when I'm going through sorrows now. 
</P>
<P>
"Bob said, 'Don't cry, every little thing is going to be all right,' so when I 
feel the tears coming down on these words, I quickly dry my tears or hold it 
back. I know I mustn't cry because Jah's (God's) will must be done." 
</P>
<P>
DEATH OF A JAGUAR: The diabetes-related death Sunday of Herman (Sonny) Chaney, 
for 35 years the lead singer of the L.A. vocal group the Jaguars, served to 
remind pop historians of an era of local music that has had impact all the way 
through the success of Los Lobos and the movie "La Bamba." Credited as being 
L.A.'s first integrated pop group, the group was a key player in forging the 
vibrant multicultural scene that gave rise to the likes of Ritchie Valens. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to play a lot at El Monte Legion Stadium, and the audiences were a 
good cross section of whites, Chicanos and blacks," recalled group member Manny 
Chavez this week of the group's '50s beginnings. "I don't think kids today even 
think in those terms; it's common to see racially mixed groups now. . . . But 
that was the begining of rock 'n' roll and they were all into the music, so 
they didn't care (that the group and audience was mixed)." 
</P>
<P>
The Jaguars were spurred to return to active performing in 1987 in part because 
of their song "Charlena's" featured appearance in the "La Bamba" score. 
</P>
<P>
Memorial services for Chaney, who last performed with the Jaguars as part of a 
"Legends of West Coast Doo-Wop" concert in November, will be held today at the 
McKinley Avenue Baptist Church, 5025 McKinley Ave. in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
LIVE ACTION: Ratt will headline the Los Angeles Sport Arena on March 12. 
Tickets are on sale now. . . . On sale today is Living Colour at the Palace on 
Feb. 23. . . . Also new on the Palace schedule are Michelle Shocked on March 7 
and That Petrol Emotion on March 9. . . . Stryper's Universal Amphitheatre 
concert scheduled for Sunday has been postponed, due to an illness in the band.

DURAN DURAN, PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS A-GO-GO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Admirers of the female form in a state of go-go had a field day Thursday at the 
sold-out Universal Amphitheatre, where headliner Duran Duran and opening act 
the Pursuit of Happiness both offered gyratin' gals aplenty as sidelights to 
their respective shticks. 
</P>
<P>
The mutual attraction to miniskirts aside, the two groups couldn't conceivably 
have been more different -- not even in what their respective use of dancing 
girls signifies about their art. 
</P>
<P>
Duran lead idol Simon le Bon, is, frankly, a lousy dancer himself -- which 
doesn't make him any less sensitive a human being, but, hey, his combo is in 
the process of re-establishing itself as the premier white teen dance band 
(after a short-lived quasi-adventurous phase), and Le Bon does still insist on 
moving himself around on stage. Thus: all distractions welcome, be they ladies 
or light shows. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, the sexy, graceful choreography of the two backup singers added 
needed visual spice, but we should know better than to expect the folks that 
brought us the "Girls on Film" video to leave well enough alone, and soon the 
femmes were simulating salacious stuff with band members, before stripping down 
behind a screen and shaking their stuff in silhouette to the purportedly 
anti-porn "Skin Trade." Would someone please explain, as the song says, the 
reason for this strange behavior? 
</P>
<P>
Duran Duran's occasionally savvy dance fever mightn't have seemed quite so 
empty had it not followed the much tougher, more tuneful and literate hard-pop 
blitzkrieg of the Pursuit of Happiness, a Canadian quintet with all the makings 
of a great rock 'n' roll band. Where Duran is still caught up in selling sex, 
marrying the prurient and the pretentious, the Pursuit's Moe Berg actually 
writes about it, addresses it, tries valiantly to make some sense of it or at 
least get a laugh out of love's odd politics. 
</P>
<P>
And in this case, the winsome women framing the stage were actual members of 
the band. Backup singer Leslie Stanwyck's frisky-a-go-go dancing reflected a 
casual joy in the music, something that couldn't be said for the often 
ponderous impersonality of the headliner's Teflon dance music and its 
accompanying goils-on-film. CHRIS WILLMAN

DESPITE COLD, MAGIC IS HOT IN LAKER WIN OVER TRAIL BLAZERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM McMANIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This being the flu season, which naturally coincides with the National 
Basketball Assn. season, Magic Johnson took all the necessary measures to play 
on a rainy night when he probably felt like calling in sick. 
</P>
<P>
Feeling ill, Johnson missed the Lakers' morning workout, but hardly anything 
else Friday. Johnson drank plenty of fluids, then sank plenty of shots. He fed 
the cold, as they say, and generously fed the ball to teammates. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, however, it was the Portland Trail Blazers who felt worse. All 
Johnson did was score 17 of his 29 points in the first quarter, as the Lakers 
recorded an easy 140-129 victory before a Forum crowd of 17,505. 
</P>
<P>
Clutching a cup of orange juice and sniffling while sitting at his locker 
afterward, Johnson certainly did not look well. But, on the court, he was as 
strong as ever in helping the Lakers build a comfortable early lead that they 
never relinquished. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been kind of sick," said Johnson, who made 10 of 15 shots. "I was just 
hoping I'd have the energy to play. You never know until you walk out on the 
court. 
</P>
<P>
"But once I'm out there, I don't even think about being sick. Once you hit the 
floor, you do your job. I still don't feel well, but I'll be all right. 
Hopefully, it won't go into the flu stage." 
</P>
<P>
On this night, quality performances were contagious. In addition to Johnson's 
29 points, 8 assists and 8 rebounds, James Worthy had 21 points, A.C. Green 20 
points and 11 rebounds and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 15 points. 
</P>
<P>
So dominant were the Lakers that Coach Pat Riley went to his bench early and 
often, and the bench responded by not letting Portland seriously threaten. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Lakers' third consecutive victory over the Trail Blazers at the 
Forum this season, their second straight blowout win. This one enabled the 
Lakers (31-14) to increase their Pacific Division lead to 3 games over the 
Phoenix Suns and the Seattle SuperSonics. Both lost Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a bounce-back game at home for us," said Riley, referring to Wednesday 
night's 17-point loss at Phoenix. "Our first half was about as good as we 
played all season, I have to say that. We kept driving the ball to the basket 
and kept the pressure on. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want any lingering effects from the Phoenix game. It was a matter of 
coming in mentally tenacious." 
</P>
<P>
The only thing Johnson brought back from the just-concluded trip, in which the 
Lakers won 2 of 3 games, was the beginnings of a cold. 
</P>
<P>
"I started feeling ill on the road," Johnson said. "But I wanted to play 
tonight." 
</P>
<P>
The Trail Blazers wish he had stayed home. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson made all 5 shots in the first quarter, 1 coming from 3-point range. He 
also made all 6 free-throw attempts, and ended the quarter by making a 
behind-the-back pass to Mychal Thompson underneath for an easy basket. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly thereafter, the Lakers pulled away and Portland was well on its way to 
losing for the 23rd time in the last 24 games against the Lakers at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers had a 22-point halftime lead, extended it to 25 early in the third 
quarter and, despite liberal use of the reserves from that point, never saw the 
lead dip below 12. 
</P>
<P>
In totaling 140 points, their second-highest total this season, the Lakers 
received 47 points from their bench. 
</P>
<P>
Leading the reserve charge was guard David Rivers, who played 15 minutes in 
Johnson's place and had 10 points and 5 assists. 
</P>
<P>
Third-string center Mark McNamara made a rare third-quarter appearance and 
finished with 7 points, and Thompson (9 points), Orlando Woolridge (9) and Tony 
Campbell (8) also contributed. Going mostly with reserves to start the second 
quarter, the Lakers increased the lead from 9 to 15 points. 
</P>
<P>
It was 52-41 when Riley re-inserted 3 starters 5 1/2 minutes into the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in the third quarter, a 22-point Laker lead dipped to 16 when Riley used 
Thompson and McNamara in place of Green and Abdul-Jabbar. 
</P>
<P>
"The hope is (Riley) gets enough confidence in us so that he can go with us in 
key situations," McNamara said. "Then, we could keep things status quo for a 
while. That helps all of us. We (the reserves) get some minutes, and (the 
starters) get some rest." 
</P>
<P>
Rivers, playing more lately because of the illness that has sidelined Byron 
Scott, is starting to show signs of improvement after a rocky first half of the 
season. Friday night, Rivers made 5 of 7 shots, and his 5 assists offset 3 
turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have to live with that up and down (performances) with David," 
Riley said. "There are three things he has to show us to be a good point guard 
in this league. He has to penetrate and finish off plays, hit the open jumpers 
and make his free throws. 
</P>
<P>
"We know he can penetrate and make free throws, but he's got to prove he can 
make the jumper." 
</P>
<P>
The Trail Blazers, led by center Kevin Duckworth, who had 25 points, and Kiki 
Vandeweghe, who had 20, made 53% of their shots. But still, the Lakers 
dominated by holding a 45-35 rebounding advantage and forcing 11 first-half 
turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
"You can see it in their faces, in their eyes," Portland Coach Mike Schuler 
said of the Lakers. "At home, the Lakers are tough to beat. They are always 
focused on what they have to do. Our players had to be ready for that, ready 
for their pressure. They weren't." 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's 15 points left him 1 shy of 38,000 for his career. . . . 
Byron Scott, out with internal bleeding, will work out on his own today and 
will be evaluated before Sunday's game. . . . The Lakers have outrebounded 
opponents for the 10th time in the last 11 games. . . . Mychal Thompson made 
just 3 of 8 shots, lowering his NBA-best field-goal percentage to 59.1%.

DON BEAUPRE TRYING TO MAKE ANOTHER BIG SAVE -- HIS CAREER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOUIS GLASER, Baltimore Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
BALTIMORE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Don Beaupre peered through his mask for one of the first times as a National 
Hockey League goaltender to see Mark Howe flying down ice with no defenseman 
between them. 
</P>
<P>
Beaupre, a 19-year-old rookie for the Minnesota North Stars, was starting in 
the 1980-81 opener against the Hartford Whalers before a capacity Met Center 
crowd. "I was pretty nervous," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Howe skated across the blue line, cut to Beaupre's left, faked a shot and then 
fired the puck high toward the net. 
</P>
<P>
"He shot to my glove, and I stopped it," Beaupre said. "You kind of stop and 
think after the first time you stop a big-name player." 
</P>
<P>
During his first season in the NHL -- an eight-month rise to fame -- Beaupre 
didn't have much time to think. In one year, he went from an all-star for the 
Sudbury Wolves in the Ontario Junior League to the starting Campbell Conference 
goalie in the NHL All-Star Game. He finished with 18 wins, including a 9-3 
victory in the opener, third place in the rookie of the year voting and was in 
goal during the North Stars' only victory in the Stanley Cup finals against the 
New York Islanders. "The highest point of the whole year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Eight years later, Beaupre is at the lowest point of his career. 
</P>
<P>
He's an NHL goalie playing for the Baltimore Skipjacks in the American Hockey 
League -- the result of a trade the Washington Capitals made with Minnesota for 
Claudio Scremin, a University of Maine defenseman who was a 10th-round pick by 
the Capitals in the 1987 entry draft. 
</P>
<P>
"In our evaluation, when we acquired (Beaupre), he was more the victim of 
circumstances -- a new coach, new general manager, a new-look type of 
organization that was getting rid of the old and bringing in the new," Capitals 
General Manager David Poile said. "We feel we have three NHL-caliber 
goaltenders in our system probably for the first time in our franchise's 
history." 
</P>
<P>
However, only two (Pete Peeters and Clint Malarchuk) are kept on the Capitals' 
roster during the regular season. And for the first extended period in his 
career, Beaupre is playing in the minors. 
</P>
<P>
He played one period with Washington in November, replacing Malarchuk when the 
Capitals were losing, 5-2, after two periods to the New Jersey Devils, and 
Peeters was unavailable because of an injury. Beaupre allowed one goal in six 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
"After the game, they told me I was going down to Baltimore because Pete was 
ready to play again," Beaupre said. "I was disappointed, but didn't think it 
would be for that long. I had heard talk that they were unhappy with their 
goal-tending at the beginning of the year, would make a deal and I'd come back 
up. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's 2 1/2, three months and I'm still here. I came to play for 
Washington, not for Baltimore. Things are going good here, but it's not the 
NHL, and after eight years there, this isn't the highlight of my career." 
</P>
<P>
The adjustment has been tough for Beaupre, who, with his wife Kim and daughters 
Jennifer, 23 months, and Christina, six months, moved from their house in 
Burnsville, Minn., to a rented townhouse in Bowie, Md. He said he sometimes 
wakes up after dreaming about the dreads of minor-league play -- the bus rides, 
cheap hotels, smaller paychecks -- things he thought he left behind in Sudbury. 
"All the angry feelings about the way things are going kind of come together," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's swallowing your pride. I'm making less money this year than my first year 
in the NHL," he said. "I've given my energy to the NHL. It's the premier hockey 
league in the world, and after playing in it as long as I did, and knowing I 
can play there, being in the American league is pretty tough." 
</P>
<P>
Still, he won six of his first seven games with the Skipjacks, allowing 2.4 
goals per game while winning the AHL Player of the Week award. In 24 games, he 
has a 12-9-2 record with a 3.57 goals-against average. 
</P>
<P>
"He's able to make the second and third saves on shots that are in tight," 
Skipjacks Coach Terry Murray said. "He's very quick and has tremendous legs. 
The best part of his game is his agility - moving from side to side, out (of 
the goal) challenging." 
</P>
<P>
"The main thing is believing they're not going to score on you," Beaupre said. 
</P>
<P>
At 15, Beaupre was one of the best goalies in the junior leagues; he joined the 
Wolves when he was 17. He was drafted by Minnesota two years later, and made 
the team after training camp -- which included a week in Sweden. He celebrated 
his 19th birthday on the plane ride home. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything was so new, all the different cities, and you're playing against 
players you've seen on TV and read about," he said. "We had our own bus with 
bunks in Sudbury, and now I was flying and staying at first-class hotels." 
</P>
<P>
After his first year, Beaupre slumped, finishing with an 11-8-9 record and a 
five-game stint in Nashville of the Central Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
"My second year was the toughest. I got hurt (rib injury), and they sent me 
down right away," he said. "During my first year, I never thought I'd ever play 
in the minors." 
</P>
<P>
Beaupre rebounded, winning 36 games during the next two years, but began 
1985-86 in a rut. However, he came back after the All-Star break to win 14 
straight games.

LOYOLA IS OUTRUN BY ST. MARY'S; 
</P>
<P>
GAELS' 116-104 WIN PUSHES LIONS OUT OF FIRST PLACE IN WCAC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The anticipated showdown -- Loyola Marymount's offense of the Nineties (and 
usually hundreds) against the timeless defense of St. Mary's -- failed to 
materialize Friday as St. Mary's showed it could beat Loyola at its own game. 
</P>
<P>
The gallop was in the Gaels as they ran away to a 116-104 victory before a 
sellout crowd of 4,366 at Gersten Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
The victory allowed St. Mary's (18-2) to remain tied for first place in the 
West Coast Athletic Conference at 6-1 going into tonight's game with co-leader 
Pepperdine at Malibu. Loyola is 12-8 and 5-2 going into tonight's home game 
against San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The Gaels came to Los Angeles with a well-earned reputation for defense, 
ranking second in the nation in points allowed (54.7 per game) and shooting 
percentage (39%). Loyola countered with its 113.4-point average, best in the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
But St. Mary's Coach Lynn Nance said his team can score, too. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been running well all year," he said. "People who have played us have 
been trying to stop us from running, because we've been very effective. It's 
too bad we're stereotyped (as being all defense). We've been scoring quite a 
few points." 
</P>
<P>
St. Mary's output Friday was the second-highest in school history, paced by 
senior forward Robert Haugen's career-high 37. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola's Hank Gathers, who scored 39 points, said: "They surprised us. They 
went straight at us. They played the game to win instead of not to lose. They 
did an excellent job of capitalizing on our mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
The first half was played at the fast pace Loyola wanted, but with an 
unexpected twist: St. Mary's liked the running just fine. 
</P>
<P>
After trading baskets for a 10-10 tie, St. Mary's pulled away to a lead that 
reached 36-21 with 8:02 left in the half as Haugen scored inside with ease. 
</P>
<P>
Behind Gathers' 22 first-half points, the Lions fought back to within 43-34 
with 3:27 to go. But the Gaels spent the rest of the half rebuilding their lead 
to 55-41 by halftime, outshooting the Lions, 17-4, from the foul line. 
</P>
<P>
The Gaels extended the lead to 100-77 with 5:47 to play before Loyola made a 
charge in the last minutes, going on a 9-0 run to make the score respectable. 
</P>
<P>
Haugen hit all seven of his shots in the second half and finished 14 for 16 
with 13 rebounds. Forwards Erick Newman (18) and James Dailey (17) led four 
other Gaels in double figures. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers, who hit 18 of 24 shots and added 18 rebounds, had little help from his 
normally explosive teammates. Jeff Fryer added 16 points, Per Stumer 12 and 
Enoch Simmons 10. The Gaels outshot Loyola, 64% to 45%, and held the Lions to 
six 3-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
"We created the game we wanted. We just weren't able to finish it off," Lion 
Coach Paul Westhead said. "We had an offensive problem more than a defensive 
problem."

KNICKS VALUE OAKLEY FOR THINGS FANS AND THE MEDIA DON'T SEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE JACOBSON, Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What the Knickerbockers think about Charles Oakley first are things they think 
only they appreciate. Things they think nobody else knows or cares about. 
</P>
<P>
Like the episode at the video studio in Phoenix on the interminable last trip. 
Or the incident the first time he played Philadelphia while wearing a New York 
Knicks uniform. 
</P>
<P>
They say, "He's a whole lot better than I thought he was," as Kenny Walker did. 
That means on one level, he's a better basketball player. That's apparent. More 
than that, they believe he's made them a better basketball team. "Stuff that 
doesn't show in the stats," Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
In the eighth game of the season, when Oakley was still making his transition 
to the Knicks from his reputation with the Chicago Bulls, Walker's spindly body 
was menaced by the burly Charles Barkley. "I remember it vividly," Walker said. 
He and Oakley had Barkley trapped in the corner, Walker absorbed an elbow and 
was charged with a foul as he lay on the floor. And Barkley flung the ball into 
Walker's body and glowered over him. Few basketball players glower like Charles 
Barkley. 
</P>
<P>
"The first one there was Oakley," Walker said. "He was terrific. Some guys say 
what they're going to do; he doesn't just talk." 
</P>
<P>
He showed that quickly. "I'm a role player," Oakley said. "I had to prove to 
them I can play. I think I've proved that." 
</P>
<P>
One of his roles is that he is an enforcer. "A cop," Oakley called himself. The 
good teams have somebody who stands over everybody's shoulder to make sure the 
bully doesn't pick on the little guys. Oakley is 6-9 and he plays as wide as he 
is tall. He will not be moved, which is also the nature of his game. He says he 
fears no man without a gun. 
</P>
<P>
He is a rebounder. "He is a house," said Mark Jackson. "He can't jump out of 
the building, but he wants the ball." 
</P>
<P>
His first news conference after being drafted by Chicago in 1985 was to declare 
that some day he would lead the league in rebounding. And he did that the last 
two seasons. "I like banging," Oakley said. "The things I do, I can't be 
stopped. Rebounding." 
</P>
<P>
Being the cop and the rebounder go together like iron and paint: When the ball 
comes off the iron, Oakley is poised in the paint. Being an enforcer and a 
rebounder are functions of desire and effort. 
</P>
<P>
The strong chemistry of the Knicks has grown from that. It's not coincidence 
that they are in first place. What they saw of Oakley was what an opposing team 
sees in a handful of games. Sometimes they ask how come he does those things 
against us. And sometimes what he can do goes unseen. "You don't appreciate 
what he does until you see him night after night," Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
What he does, Walker said, "are things the fans don't see, things the media 
doesn't see." 
</P>
<P>
Like last weeks' visit to Phoenix. Oakley pulled Jackson, Walker and Pete Myers 
out of the hotel to make a tape, lip-synching and gyrating to rap lyrics. 
Oakley has done that before, sort of as traveling social director. "On the 
road, the walls have a tendency to close in on you," Walker said. "It's good to 
have somebody to get you out. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easy to do if you're going well. I like guys who can come out when 
they're going bad. He gives everybody a lift." 
</P>
<P>
He is also playing very good ball, which is really where it all begins. When Al 
Bianchi made the trade, he identified Oakley as a rebounder, which was what he 
showed in Chicago. "I was trying to tell them I could do more," Oakley said. "I 
said I should be more involved. In Chicago, they said I had a bad attitude. In 
two years, no play was ever called for me. They said I was a rebounder and 
shouldn't need a play called for me." 
</P>
<P>
He is still a rebounder but Rick Pitino calls a postup for Oakley from time to 
time. "He lets me know he cares," Oakley said. That's part of the art and craft 
of coaching. Last season Oakley got nine shots a game and felt unappreciated; 
this year he's averaging 10 shots a game and feels in the middle of everything. 
</P>
<P>
He is a rebounder. But it's one thing to get the ball off the boards and 
another to do something with it. "In Chicago, they said I didn't do anything 
with it," he said. "I don't know who they were watching." 
</P>
<P>
With the Knicks, he has established himself as a skillful passer, first on the 
outlet to begin the break and then in the half-court offense. "He'll throw the 
ball underhanded or throw a baseball pass," Walker said. "That stuff you don't 
see in the stats." 
</P>
<P>
The stats say he went into Thursday night's game with Cleveland averaging 10.9 
rebounds and 12.8 points a game. They blew out the Cavaliers. Oakley had his 
basic game with 16 points and 13 rebounds, eight off the defensive board where 
the break begins. He has had double figures in both in 29 of the first 45 
games, which is in line with his career figures, but in less playing time. 
</P>
<P>
He also dresses better than his teammates knew, which is part of his 
contribution to this team. He is what Jackson defined as "a juicer." Oakley is 
the arbiter of style. Like if Sidney Green's garb doesn't meet the demands, 
Oakley will tell him, "Nice suit." 
</P>
<P>
"It means I got a messed-up suit," Green said. 
</P>
<P>
Oakley, of course, denies that role. "Mark," he said. "He's a juicer's juicer." 
</P>
<P>
But Oakley reaches out to needle all of them. "Patrick, myself or Greg Butler," 
Walker said, slicing across the strata of the team. 
</P>
<P>
"The only way we can repay him is to work as hard as he does." 
</P>
<P>
And to be there if he needs them. That time came at Atlanta when Oakley got in 
a scuffle and Walker went to his aid. "I can't do as much for him as he can for 
me, but I'll be there," Walker said. "I threw my little body out there." 
</P>
<P>
That's appreciation.

MORNING BRIEFING: BAD-GUY IMAGE IS FOR OILERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Houston Oilers have long enjoyed a bad-boy reputation, on and off the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
When Ladd Herzeg resigned this week as the team's general manager, it was 
probably just coincidence that only a few weeks before, he had slapped a 
Houston Chronicle columnist to culminate an embarrassing caviar-dipping, 
champagne-drinking spree at a Houston restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
But it was Coach Jerry Glanville who may have set the tone. Twice upset at the 
tone of reports on him and his team during the season, he challenged Houston 
Chronicle writer John McLain to fight and then, outside the practice facility, 
bumped radio talk show host Barry Warner of KILT-AM and told him he wanted to 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
"Jerry said, 'Come on, let's go to a hotel room and settle this thing,' " 
Warner said. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him if I was going to a hotel room with somebody, it wouldn't be with a 
broken-down football coach." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers' Feb. 19 game with the Celtics in the Forum has been sold out for 
five months. Josh Rosenfeld, the Lakers' public relations director, said he has 
had more than 100 requests for credentials, including the City News Service. 
</P>
<P>
So? 
</P>
<P>
"From Willow Springs, Missouri?" Rosenfeld asked. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee Bucks Coach Del Harris sat one out Friday night. Actually, he lay one 
out. For the first time in his 30-year coaching career, Harris missed a game. 
</P>
<P>
While his Bucks were playing the Indiana Pacers, Harris could only listen to 
the game on the radio in his Indianapolis hotel room after injuring his back 
while playing Good Samaritan in a restaurant the night before. 
</P>
<P>
Harris said he saw an elderly gentleman with a walker fall onto a table, then 
land on his back. Harris rushed over to help. He bent over, got halfway up and 
felt "this thing in my back rip." 
</P>
<P>
Harris isn't sure what is wrong, except that he can't stand up because his back 
hurts. 
</P>
<P>
After a night's sleep, he felt good enough to order room service, but when his 
food was brought, Harris passed out on the floor. He told the waiter to call 
team trainer Jeff Snedeker. 
</P>
<P>
"He was calling 'Snecker, Snedler, Snooker,' " Harris said. "I thought I was 
going to pass out again, spelling Snedeker for the guy. I spelled it seven 
times." 
</P>
<P>
The moral? There are two, Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
1) "I stepped out of character and tried to be a nice guy and look what 
happened to me." 
</P>
<P>
2) "My next trainer will be named Bill Jones." 
</P>
<P>
Numbers: The Pittsburgh Pirates, baseball's worst-drawing team only four years 
ago, expect to sell 1 million tickets by Opening Day. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, when they finished last, the Pirates drew 735,900. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook 
</P>
<P>
From Harry Caray, named to the Italian-American Hall of Fame and the Baseball 
Hall of Fame: "I'll bet I'm the first guy in history to go into two halls in 
one day."

<P>
OILERS RALLY TO DEFEAT RED WINGS, 8-5 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Craig MacTavish scored one goal and assisted on three more and Jimmy Carson had 
two goals Friday night as the Edmonton Oilers rallied to beat the Detroit Red 
Wings, 8-5, at Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers, who were trailing, 5-3, early in the second period, came back after 
Grant Fuhr replaced starting goaltender Bill Ranford. MacTavish, Normand 
Lacombe and Craig Redmond then scored as Edmonton took a 6-5 lead into the 
third period. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Messier scored early in the final period, and Carson scored a power-play 
goal with less than 4 minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
Washington 1, Hartford 0 -- Goalie Pete Peeters made 31 saves and earned his 
fourth shutout of the season as he stopped the Whalers at Landover, Md. 
</P>
<P>
Bengt Gustafsson's second-period goal was his 15th of the season as the 
Capitals extended their unbeaten streak to six games. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 3, St. Louis 3 -- Paul Coffey, Mario Lemieux and Troy Loney scored 
in a 3:28 span of the third period to give the Penguins the tie with the Blues 
at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh came back from 3-0, helped by a major penalty against Tony McKegney. 
McKegney was given 5 minutes for boarding Jim Johnson at 19:36 of the second 
period, and Pittsburgh scored twice. 
</P>
<P>
Coffey scored his 21st goal at 2:07, and Lemieux scored his 55th on a breakaway 
at 4:21. Then, with the teams at even strength, Loney tied the score with his 
seventh goal. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 4, Winnipeg 2 -- Cam Neely broke a 2-2 tie with 5:44 to play and added 
an empty-net goal with 56 seconds left as the Bruins beat the Jets at Winnipeg. 
</P>
<P>
Neely, voted as starting right wing on the Wales Conference All-Stars, has 25 
goals, including 15 in his last 16 games.

HE'S STRIKING A BLOW FOR FATHERHOOD; 
</P>
<P>
STARLING, A DEVOTED PARENT, FACES LESS-DEVOTED HONEYGHAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
LAS VEGAS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This one is for fatherhood. 
</P>
<P>
One boxer will fight tonight because, he says, "my son is my life. My son is 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
The other boasts of having fathered, as nearly as he can figure, five children 
by three women. 
</P>
<P>
It's Marlon Starling and Lloyd Honeyghan tonight at Caesars Palace, the 
featured matchup of an HBO welterweight doubleheader. Starling is seeking 
Honeyghan's World Boxing Council welterweight championship. 
</P>
<P>
The co-main event matches two more welterweight contenders, 1984 Olympic hero 
Mark Breland and South Korea's Lee-Seun Soon, fighting for the vacant World 
Boxing Assn. championship. 
</P>
<P>
Starling and Honeyghan are a couple of one-time dead-end kids. Starling grew up 
in Hartford, Conn.; Honeyghan on the streets of London, by way of Jamaica. 
</P>
<P>
For Starling, 30, big paydays have arrived after a long climb up boxing's 
ladder. 
</P>
<P>
His career-turning victory occurred in the summer of 1987, when he knocked out 
Breland in the 11th round. Starling's manager, Mort Sharnik, recalled a 
conversation with his boxer, just days after that shocker. 
</P>
<P>
"When I sat down with Marlon afterward, I commented to him that he didn't seem 
as jubilant to me as I'd expected he would be," Sharnik said. 
</P>
<P>
"And he said to me: 'I haven't thought of anything since the fight except my 
son.' He told me that the Breland fight made him understand how important his 
son was to him." 
</P>
<P>
In a phone interview the other day, Starling, who is divorced, talked about 
Marlon Jr, 12. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything I do is for Marlon Jr.," he said. "He's doing really well in school 
right now, and I'm so proud of him for that I could bust. My son is my purpose 
for living." 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Honeyghan's love life, to say nothing of his parenthood, has been 
fodder for London tabloids for years. When he told British boxing writers in 
December that he planned to marry his live-in girlfriend, Jennifer Green -- who 
is the mother of two of his children -- they burst out laughing. 
</P>
<P>
Not only that, he said he would marry her on Feb. 2, two days before the 
Starling fight. 
</P>
<P>
At noon Friday, British fight writers stationed in Las Vegas called off a 
not-very-serious matrimony watch. 
</P>
<P>
Starling-Honeyghan was supposed to have been Starling's first $1-million fight. 
Instead, he will earn about $250,000 tonight, and Honeyghan will make $650,000. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, HBO wanted to sign Starling to a two-fight deal, paying him 
$250,000 to meet Tomas Molinares of Colombia and $800,000 to meet Honeyghan. He 
turned it down. 
</P>
<P>
"Against my advice, Marlon took only the Molinares end of the deal," Sharnik 
said. "He felt he should get $1 million for Honeyghan. I even advised him to 
take it for $750,000." 
</P>
<P>
He got his $250,000 for the Starling fight last July, but he was also beaten. 
After the bell sounded to end the sixth round, Molinares caught Starling with a 
right hand and knocked him out. 
</P>
<P>
Sharnik screamed foul and threatened a lawsuit against the WBA, the New Jersey 
State Athletic Commission and everyone else within shouting distance. 
</P>
<P>
"We spent a couple of days with a room full of attorneys, and eventually 
decided a lawsuit would take Marlon out of the prime years of his boxing 
career," Sharnik said. 
</P>
<P>
"We filed a protest with the WBA, and Marlon is still bitter over the fact that 
after paying $15,000 in WBA sanction fees for three title fights, the WBA never 
even responded to the protest. Not even a phone call. 
</P>
<P>
"But here's what kind of a guy Marlon is: As depressing as that whole 
experience was to him, he gets more depressed at having to leave home, to train 
for fights like this one, and be separated so much from Marlon Jr." 
</P>
<P>
Breland, 22-1-1 and still in the comeback mode, was supposed to meet Molinares 
tonight. But Molinares pulled out six weeks ago, giving up his WBA title, 
citing "severe depression." 
</P>
<P>
Enter Lee, the WBA's No. 2-ranked welterweight. Breland, somehow, is ranked No. 
1. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of boxing people will be looking to see if Breland can regain some of the 
luster he lost against Starling in 1987 and in a disputed draw in a rematch 
with Starling last year. 
</P>
<P>
His trainer, Joey Fariello, talked about the Breland-Starling draw, which most 
ringside watchers saw as a clear win for Starling. 
</P>
<P>
"Mark still has to prove he can fight," Fariello said. 
</P>
<P>
"Right after the (second) Starling fight, I recommended that Mark quit. I told 
Shelly Finkel (Breland's manager) he just wasn't right. There was nothing 
there, no motivation. I don't think he wanted to fight." 
</P>
<P>
Finkel wanted to see Breland in the ring again, however, and the Olympic 
champion knocked out someone named Fabio Baez in one ound. 
</P>
<P>
"The Baez fight was the best I'd ever seen him," Fariello said. "He went out 
there and threw bombs. If he'd fought like that against Starling, it'd been a 
different story."

HERSHISER SAYS HE AND DODGERS ARE AT IMPASSE OVER LOCKOUT LANGUAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orel Hershiser, the Dodgers' Cy Young Award-winning pitcher, said Friday that 
his contract talks are at an impasse over lockout language. 
</P>
<P>
Teammates Kirk Gibson and Mike Marshall both have clauses in their contracts 
obligating the team to pay them in the event of an owners' lockout in 1990. 
However, the Dodgers don't want to extend the same provision to Hershiser, 
agent Robert Fraley said. 
</P>
<P>
Fraley said the Dodgers have made Hershiser two offers, the best a three-year 
deal worth $6.25 million. Dodger executive vice president Fred Claire said 
Friday that that is more than $2 million less than what Hershiser is seeking. 
</P>
<P>
Fraley said the impasse is over lockout language, but the financial terms of 
the deal are also unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser, who made $1.1 million in 1988 and could become a free agent after 
this season, is scheduled for a Feb. 16 arbitration hearing. He is seeking 
$2.425 million for one year, which would be a record arbitration award. The 
Dodgers are offering $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Claire said: "We signed the other players to their contracts last season before 
we determined our lockout language position. What we offered Orel is not 
unreasonable. It is the largest guaranteed 3-year contract ever offered in the 
history of the Dodgers." LONNIE WHITE

IRWIN'S NEW OUTLOOK; 
</P>
<P>
VETERAN PRO SAYS 'BEANING' IN PRO-AM HAS GIVEN HIM AN ATTITUDE ADJUSTMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH TOSCHES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Hale Irwin stepped onto the Riviera Country Club course Wednesday for the 
pro-am before the Los Angeles Open, he was hoping to come away with a book full 
of notes on the course and its conditions. 
</P>
<P>
What he came away with was a nasty, gaping gash on his forehead and a face full 
of blood. And he considered himself very lucky. 
</P>
<P>
Irwin was struck by a ball hit by former Ram center Rich Saul. The force of the 
blow opened a two-inch laceration on Irwin's face and required 16 stitches to 
close. He was held at Santa Monica Hospital for several hours and then 
released. 
</P>
<P>
Saul, who made a career out of playing injured, said the accident made him 
sick. "It was my second shot and I hooked a three-wood," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Hale was more than 200 yards away and I hooked it through a row of trees. All 
of a sudden I see people running and gathering in one spot and yelling. I knew 
right away what happened. I ran over as fast as I could and someone was putting 
pressure on the cut to stop the bleeding. He was laying there with blood on his 
sweater and golf glove, and he looked up and told me, 'I'm fine.' 
</P>
<P>
"I felt so, so bad. It really made me feel terrible. Just about an hour earlier 
I had met him in the locker room and introduced myself. And then I went and did 
that. I felt so bad. This is a very low point in my life." 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-four hours later, though, Irwin was back on the course for the opening 
round of the tournament. And with a throbbing head, he shot a one-under-par 70. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, with a new bandage covering the wound, he shot four-under-par 67 and 
was just three strokes off the lead with two rounds to play. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that his name is on the leader board is not, however, why Irwin feels 
lucky. He feels lucky because he can see his name on the leader board. And he 
can see the leader board. And the golf course. 
</P>
<P>
"I stare at it now in the mirror and I realize just how close it came to 
something else," said Irwin, avoiding direct mention of his eye. "It sure 
smacks you with a dose of reality. I misread some putts today, and all I could 
think was how thankful I was that I could see them at all." 
</P>
<P>
Irwin had hit his second shot on the seventh hole during the pro-am and had 
turned to walk. Instantly, he heard someone yell "fore" and saw only a flash 
before he crumbled to the wet ground. 
</P>
<P>
"I just saw a flash of white," he said. "I actually saw the ball and it 
registered in my brain what was about to happen, but there was no time to 
react. I didn't even begin to put my hands up and then, bang. I remember 
dropping my club and then bringing my hands to my face and then laying down." 
</P>
<P>
Doctors told him he would have suffered serious and permanent damage to his eye 
had the ball hit it directly. His brush with disaster left Irwin shaken even on 
Friday. But somehow, he said, it may have helped his golf game. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always been very intense on the course, and I always will be," he said. 
"But for the first time, I felt different out there the last two days. It gave 
me an attitude adjustment. I approached the course the next day a bit 
differently than I ever had approached a tournament before." 
</P>
<P>
Irwin, 43, winner of 17 PGA tournaments, including the 1976 L.A. Open and the 
1974 and 1979 U.S. Opens, said he also found himself thinking back to a scene 
he encountered three weeks ago in Myrtle Beach, S.C. He was the first motorist 
to come upon a crash on a dark road, a crash that killed a young woman. Irwin 
was the first to reach the woman who was pinned in the wreckage. But it was too 
late. 
</P>
<P>
"She had no pulse," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That accident left an invisible scar on Irwin. Wednesday's accident will leave 
a visible scar. 
</P>
<P>
"I got upset at myself on the course today but quickly caught myself and asked, 
'Why am I complaining about golf?' " he said. "That was the first time I had 
ever started feeling like that. I'll still be intense out there, but now it's 
different. I'm still wrestling with the emotion, but I feel a change." 
</P>
<P>
The change showed late Friday when Irwin, not noted for his humor during his 22 
years on the tour, was asked if perhaps the injury was a message from above. 
</P>
<P>
"If it was, I wish He had found a different way to get the message to me," 
Irwin said. "A golf ball to the face was a bit much. A vision in my sleep would 
have been nice."

PEPPERDINE STUMBLES, DOESN'T FALL; 
</P>
<P>
WAVES REMAIN TIED FOR FIRST WITH LACKLUSTER 68-65 WIN 
</P>

<P>
If Pepperdine was rehearsing Friday night against the University of San Diego, 
it won't play well in its West Coast Athletic Conference basketball showdown 
tonight against St. Mary's. 
</P>
<P>
The Waves stumbled, fumbled and bumbled their way through the first 36 minutes 
against San Diego, but managed to win, 68-65, before a crowd of 1,406 at 
Firestone Fieldhouse in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine improved to 14-8 overall and 6-1 in the WCAC, remaining in a 
first-place tie in the conference with St. Mary's. 
</P>
<P>
The Toreros fell to 6-13 and 1-6. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, we weren't ready to play," said Pepperdine Coach Tom Asbury, who 
added that it was also clear that his team was looking ahead to St. Mary's. The 
Waves will play host to the Gaels at 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
If you didn't know the players, you would have thought that San Diego was the 
first-place team and Pepperdine was in last place Friday night. At least it 
looked that way in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
The Toreros outshot the Waves, 67% to 42.3%, and outrebounded them, 14-10, en 
route to a 41-37 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
The only reason Pepperdine managed to stay close in the half was that it made 5 
of 9 3-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine came out with more intensity in the second half and managed to tie 
the Toreros several times and trade leads with them on several other occasions. 
But neither team was able to pull away. 
</P>
<P>
With 3:13 left in the game, Pepperdine's Shann Ferch hit a baseline jumper to 
tie the game for the 13th time at 62-62. 
</P>
<P>
Successive layups by Tom Lewis and Craig Davis gave Pepperdine a 66-62 lead -- 
the biggest of the night for the Waves. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Means made two free throws as Toreros pulled within 66-64 of the Waves 
with 2:12 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
After a Pepperdine turnover and missed shots by each team, San Diego's Craig 
Cottrell missed the front end of a one-and-one free-throw situation, and Marty 
Wilson got the rebound for the Waves. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson hit the front end of the one-and-one but missed the second, leaving 
Pepperdine with a 67-64 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Means was fouled with 6 seconds left and hit his first free throw. But his 
intentional miss of the second bounced off the backboard and failed to hit the 
rim. The ball was awarded to Pepperdine and Wilson was fouled. He made the 
front end of the one-and-one for the game's final point. 
</P>
<P>
Four Waves scored in double figures. Lewis had 13, Davis 12, Ferch 11 and 
Wilson 10. 
</P>
<P>
Dondi Bell led San Diego with 14 points, and Cottrell had 12, Gylan Dottin 11 
and Means 10.

TAC SUSPENDS FOUR CALIFORNIA ATHLETES; 
</P>
<P>
PENALTIES STEM FROM PARTICIPATION IN SERIES OF SOUTH AFRICA MEETS 
</P>

<P>
The Athletics Congress, which governs track and field in the United States, 
suspended four more athletes Friday for participating last October in a series 
of unsanctioned meets in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Most severely penalized was 4-time Olympian John Powell, a discus thrower from 
Cupertino, Calif., who was suspended for 6 years. Suspended for 4 years were 
Californians Carol Cady, a discus thrower from Stanford; Ruth Wysocki, a 
middle-distance runner from Canyon Lake, and James Robinson, a half-miler from 
Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco attorney Rich Nichols, a member of the 3-man panel appointed by 
The Athletics Congress to conduct hearings regarding the South African tour, 
said that Powell's suspension was longer because he is a coach. Cady is one of 
the athletes instructed by Powell. 
</P>
<P>
"For one who is looked up to by athletes to take an action that flies in the 
face of the sport's rules and regulations is a serious offense," Nichols said. 
</P>
<P>
In reaching its decision after a 2-hour meeting, the panel rejected a claim 
forwarded at an earlier hearing by Clark Leslie, a San Mateo attorney who 
represents Powell and Cady, that the International Amateur Athletic Federation, 
the governing body for the sport, has not legally suspended South Africa's 
membership. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie argued that the IAAF's initial move to suspend South Africa in 1976 
required a two-thirds vote but received only a simple majority 
</P>
<P>
Although TAC's representative, Alvin Chriss, acknowledged that the IAAF acted 
improperly when it suspended South Africa in 1976, he said that the IAAF 
subsequently corrected the error with a unanimous vote in 1981. The action was 
taken because of South Africa's official policy of racial separation. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Leslie nor any of the athletes attended Friday's hearing, the fourth 
since November. All 14 U.S. athletes who competed in South Africa have been 
suspended, as have two administrators. The panel will conduct a hearing in Los 
Angeles March 30 for the third administrator, Pasadena City College Coach Skip 
Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie said that he will have no comment until he sees a copy of the decision. 
But he indicated that Powell and Cady will appeal. Others who have notified TAC 
of their plans to appeal are the U.S. group's organizer, Dick Tomlinson, and 
athletes Tom Petranoff, Tom Hintnaus, Ray Wicksell and Tyrus Jefferson. TAC's 
Board of Directors will hear the appeals March 12 in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Wysocki, a 1984 Olympian in the 800 and the 1,500, said that she is not sure of 
her next step. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we all intend to keep fighting this," she said. "We should have the 
right to compete. I don't feel we've done something wrong." 
</P>
<P>
She said that she will return to South Africa for another series of meets in 
April. 
</P>
<P>
After that? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know," she said. "It will be interesting to be at home in the summer 
and do what normal people do."

The New York Yankees, 45 days after letting Ron Guidry go as part of a youth 
movement, made an abrupt turnaround and signed the left-hander to a 1-year 
contract for $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas Green, the Yankees' new manager, had previously decided not to keep the 
38-year-old Guidry and the 46-year-old Tommy John. 
</P>
<P>
Owner George Steinbrenner apparently decided to go against Green's wishes, 
saying, "It was my decision." 
</P>
<P>
Guidry missed the first half of the 1988 season while recovering from shoulder 
surgery. He went 2-3 with a 4.18 earned-run average in 56 innings and made 
$825,000 in the second season of a 2-year contract. He is guaranteed $250,000 
in the new contract, even if he fails to make the opening-day roster.

NEWSWIRE: A'S SIGN CANSECO FOR $1.6 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jose Canseco, voted most valuable player in the American League last year, 
avoided arbitration and nearly quintupled his salary Friday by agreeing to a 
1-year contract with the Oakland Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
Canseco will earn $1.6 million in 1989, an increase of $1.245 million over the 
$355,000 he made last year, his third full season in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Canseco's raise is the largest ever in baseball, topping the $1.15-million 
increase Andre Dawson of the Chicago Cubs received for the 1988 season. 
</P>
<P>
Canseco had sought $1.64 million in arbitration. The Athletics were offering 
$1.3 million. 
</P>

He also is the first player to have hit at least 30 home runs and driven in 100 
runs in his first 3 full seasons. He led the major leagues in 1988 with 42 home

most votes of any member of the 1988 American League All-Star team.

408,000 NEW JOBS, INCREASE IN HOURLY WAGES REPORTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The nation's economy continued to generate new employment at near-boom levels 
in January, creating 408,000 new jobs, despite an unusually large number of 
job-seekers, the Labor Department reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Director Janet L. Norwood of the Bureau of Labor Statistics and private sector 
economists partly discounted the 0.1 percentage point increase in unemployment 
-- to 5.4% -- as mostly attributable to unpredictable post-Christmas labor 
market fluctuations. They instead focused on the strong report of job creation 
in manufacturing and services. 
</P>
<P>
The 408,000 new jobs reported by business establishments was well above last 
year's monthly average of slightly more than 300,000 new jobs and above market 
expectations of new January payroll employment of about 250,000. December's job 
creation was put at 221,000, a downward revision from the 279,000 reported a 
month ago. 
</P>
<P>
Of more concern in the employment report was the fact that average hourly wages 
increased a relatively steep 0.6% in January after two months of virtually no 
increases -- a statistic likely to revive fears that a new cycle of wage-driven 
inflation may be on the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
"The big picture," said Allen Sinai, chief economist at Boston Co., "is of a 
very strong economy, of increasing employment beginning to tighten the labor 
market and beginning upward pressure on wages." The almost certain consequence, 
he predicted, is that the Federal Reserve Board is virtually certain to nudge 
interest rates another notch or two higher. 
</P>
<P>
At least 100,000 of the new January jobs came from higher than expected 
employment in construction, thanks to mild January weather, and from fewer than 
usual post-holiday layoffs by retailers. 
</P>
<P>
These special factors may have eased market concerns that the economy is 
starting the year too explosively. In fact, the reaction in financial markets 
Friday was subdued, with the Dow Jones industrial average declining a modest 
2.50 points. 
</P>
<P>
Seasonal variation also was responsible for the Labor Department estimate that 
the labor force expanded enormously during the month. Before adjustment, raw 
Census Bureau numbers suggested a slight decline in the labor force, just as 
the raw numbers suggested a slight decline in employment. After adjustment, it 
was decided that 865,000 new job-seekers poured into the labor market and that 
702,000 more Americans were employed -- the first time in many months that the 
Census survey of new jobs has actually exceeded the payroll count, normally 
considered the more reliable estimate. 
</P>
<P>
The result was a marginal increase in total unemployment from 5.3% to 5.4%, 
even though all other signs pointed to powerful employment growth. 
</P>
<P>
Sinai dismissed the 0.1 percentage point increase as insignificant. "What is 
unmistakable," he said, "is the tremendous demand for jobs and the tremendous 
availability of jobs. Once again, even with (former President Ronald) Reagan 
gone, the incredible job-creating machine created an incredible number of 
jobs." 
</P>
<P>
He expressed concern, however, at the renewed evidence in January of upward 
pressure on wages, as the average manufacturing workweek increased by 0.1 hour 
to 41 hours, an unusually high number. 
</P>
<P>
Giulio Martini of Sanford Bernstein &amp; Co. in New York noted that an 
artificial bulge of perhaps 65,000 extra warm-weather jobs in construction and 
perhaps a like number of jobs added to retail employment by seasonal adjustment 
were offset by lower-than-normal new employment in services and an unexpected 
decline in government jobs. The verdict: "a very strong report, with all signs 
pointing to higher wage inflation." The consequence: "We assume the Fed will 
act again" on interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Different View 
</P>
<P>
Robert F. Wescott of Alphametrics, a Philadelphia forecasting firm, made a 
similar judgment but drew slightly different conclusions. "The year is starting 
off with economic growth and employment growth stronger than expected," he 
said. "Inflation seems to be under control, but we need a constant monitor of 
that hourly earnings number." 
</P>
<P>
Wescott suggested that Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, for all his public dourness 
about economic growth in excess of about 2.5% a year and public concern that 
inflation is accelerating, "deep down inside is tickled pink over the 
performance of this economy." 
</P>
<P>
Civilian unemployment in California increased to 5% in January from 4.7% at 
year's end, as the labor force increased by 22,000 while employment declined by 
19,000. In January a year ago unemployment was 5.2%.

PLANT CLOSING LAW NOW IN EFFECT, BUT THE DEBATE GOES ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, Times Labor Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A controversial law requiring America's large companies to give workers 60 
days' notice of plant closings or mass layoffs takes effect today, with 
organized labor praising it and business decrying it. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope companies will view this law as the beginning of a new era of 
cooperation and good will between employers and their workers," said Sen. 
Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio), the principal author of the law. "Companies that 
believe in treating their employees fairly will not have trouble complying with 
this law," he added. 
</P>
<P>
But a lawyer for one of the nation's most prominent pro-management law firms 
predicted that the law will have a negative impact on U.S. businesses. "It will 
severely interfere with management flexibility," said Michael Lotito of 
Jackson, Lewis Schnitzler &amp; Krupman in San Francisco. "This is like taking 
Agent Orange to cure a little patch of poison ivy." 
</P>
<P>
But Lorrie McHugh, an AFL-CIO spokeswoman, said, "Fairness and decency were the 
overriding concerns in getting this law passed. Sixty days' notice became a 
matter of fairness, so workers and their communities could plan." 
</P>
<P>
The sharply differing reactions Friday reflected that the long battle over the 
measure may not be over even though it has become law of the land. Legislation 
requiring advance notice of plant closings and layoffs has been advocated for 
years by the AFL-CIO, but bills persistently died in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Then, last year, such notice was mandated as part of an omnibus trade bill. But 
President Reagan vetoed the bill, citing the plant-closing notice provisions as 
a primary reason for the veto. Subsequently, as the result of a compromise, a 
separate notice bill was introduced and passed. It went into effect without 
Reagan signing it, the only time this happened during his Administration, 
McHugh noted. 
</P>
<P>
The new law, called the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 
1988, or WARN, requires companies with 100 or more employees to provide at 
least 60 days' written notice if they: 
</P>
<P>
* Close a plant or discontinue an operating unit with 50 or more workers. 
</P>
<P>
* Lay off 50 to 499 workers if these employees constitute a third of the total 
work force at a single site. 
</P>
<P>
* Lay off 500 or more workers at a single site. 
</P>
<P>
There are some exemptions to the law for faltering companies, such as when the 
closing or layoff constitutes a strike, or when the action occurs amid 
unforeseeable business circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Average of 14 Days' Notice 
</P>
<P>
Remedies for violation of the law include back pay and related fringe benefits 
for employees up to a maximum of 60 days and fines of up to $500 a day to a 
maximum total of $30,000. However, the law does not give the Labor Department a 
way to enforce the law, so suits would have to be filed by individuals or 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
Studies by the General Accounting Office, cited by Metzenbaum, reported that 
the average white-collar worker in the United States receives only 14 days' 
notice of a layoff and that the typical blue-collar worker gets only seven 
days' notice. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, a recently published study by two University of Nebraska 
professors found that nearly 4 million person-weeks without work could have 
been avoided in the United States had the law been in effect between 1979 and 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
The study by the two management professors, Douglas O. Love and William D. 
Torrence, was based on Labor Department statistics and indicates that the new 
law could have a significant positive impact on the national economy. They 
estimated that the cost of lost work time during the 5-year study period was 
$1.33 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually all of the United States' major trading partners -- including Japan 
and West Germany -- have had advance notice laws for some years.

Del Webb Corp. posted a loss of $15 million for 1988, compared to a loss of $97 
million in 1987. Revenue fell 34% to $107 million. The Phoenix-based leisure 
company said the results were due in part to a loss of $26.5 million from 
discontinued commercial/industrial real estate projects in Colorado and 
Arizona, primarily as a result of loss provisions of $20 million for the 
disposition of those assets.

A broad measure of the nation's money supply rose in the week ended Jan. 23, 
the Federal Reserve Board reported. The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose 
to a seasonally adjusted $3,072.6 billion in the week from $3,070.4 billion the 
previous week. The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a 
seasonally adjusted $785.8 billion from a revised $783.6 billion. M1 includes 
cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts and non-bank travelers 
checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts such as savings deposits and money market mutual 
funds.

Bridgestone Corp., the Japanese tire manufacturer that bought Firestone Tire 
&amp; Rubber co. last yer, said it will spend $350 million to build a second 
plant in Tennessee to manufacturer radial tires for trucks and buses. 
</P>
<P>
The company plans to start building the plant later this year near Morrison, 
about 75 miles southeast of Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
"We are excited that we will be able to expand our production capabilities in 
the Unites States, the world's largest tire market", said Akira Yeiri, 
Bridgestone's president. 
</P>
<P>
Bridgestone expects to begin production at the plant in early 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Bridgestone's existing pant at La Vergne, Tenn., produces about 3,00 radial 
truck tires a day. 
</P>
<P>
The new factory is expected to reach full capacity of 4,000 truck and bus tires 
a day in 1994. At that time, it will employ about 750 people, a Bridgestone 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Bridgestone has pledged to become the world's biggest tire maker. It now trails 
Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. and Michelin of France.

The Federal Trade Commission, clearing the way for the nation's biggest merger, 
agreed not to challenge the $24.5-billion acquisition of RJR Nabisco by 
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. -- provided that the two companies sell 
certain products to reduce their market shares in ketchup, Oriental foods and 
packaged nuts. The commission, ruling on a preliminary agreement announced 
earlier this week, said KKR must within a year sell the Chun King Oriental 
foods line of RJR Nabisco or the La Choy line of Beatrice/Hunt-Wesson Inc., a 
unit of KKR; the Planters nuts line of RJR Nabisco or Beatrice's Fisher nuts 
line, and RJR Nabisco's Del Monte ketchup or Beatrice's Hunt's ketchup. An FTC 
official said that, if the brands were combined, they would have "probably 
slightly under 60%" of total sales of $300 million in Oriental foods; about 25% 
of the $500 million ketchup market, and about 50% of $1.5 billion in sales of 
packaged nuts.

Cooper Cos. reported a $115-million fourth-quarter loss, compared to a loss of 
$4.8 million a year earlier. Sales fell to $160.2 million, down 9%. The quarter 
includes a $59-million provision for losses on a planned divestiture. The Palo 
Alto-based medical products firm posted a $207-million loss for the year, 
contrasted with net income of $52 million in 1987. Sales jumped to $611.31 
million, up 72%. Results aren't directly comparable, the firm said, because 
figures from Cooper Technicon are included in full-year 1988 results but are 
included only in the last four months of the previous year.

DREAM VERSUS REALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read with amusement Superintendent of Schools Leonard Britton's letter 
("Blaming the Los Angeles School Board for the Labor Woes of Teachers Is 
Unfair," Jan. 1) attacking Harry Bernstein's column, "L.A. School Board-Teacher 
Harmony Is a Possible Dream." 
</P>
<P>
Britton takes exception to Bernstein calling the pay docking of teachers' 
salaries a "retaliation" or "escalation" by the district in the contract 
negotiations, but that is in fact what it is. 
</P>
<P>
Britton also claims that United Teachers of Los Angeles' belligerence has hurt 
the trust level that is essential to resolving problems. If it is belligerent 
for UTLA to point out that Britton's chauffeur was paid $90,733 last year, that 
there are 100 administrators in L.A. who are paid between $85,000 and $141,000 
-- more than Gov. Deukmejian, Mayor Bradley, U.S. congressmen and U.S. Senators 
-- I guess we are belligerent. We feel that this information is important for 
the community to understand the district has upside-down priorities. 
</P>
<P>
Britton's final attack, when he said, "In fact, we have offered L.A. teachers a 
significant power-sharing, school-based management proposal that not only 
builds upon but is more comprehensive and far reaching than the system in Dade 
County," is totally false. The only proposal the district has offered is for 
teachers on their own time to work out proposals and present them to the 
principal. Principals can veto any proposals they do not like. This proposal is 
a sham and nothing like the Dade County plan, where teachers have real 
decision-making authority. 
</P>
<P>
The overall thrust of Bernstein's column was right on target. His article 
speaks of Los Angeles school board-teacher harmony as a possible dream. We at 
UTLA see that dream as a reality worth continuing to strive for.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: THE TAXPAYER MUST DO THE RECORD-KEEPING ON 
STOCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Carla Lazzareschi 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: How does the Internal Revenue Service check up on the buy and sell 
dates of stocks? Can it really know every transaction in the portfolio of every 
taxpayer? -- M. S. C. 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: No, they don't, but it doesn't really matter, the IRS says. If IRS 
auditors want to check up on your stock dealings, they have the legal right to 
get the information they want -- or let you pay the financial consequences. 
</P>
<P>
According to an IRS spokesman, brokerage houses are required to report all 
stock sales to the agency on what is known as a Form 1099-B. You receive copies 
of these reports and are required to attach them to your income tax return 
every time you sell shares. The IRS also receives this information and, thanks 
to the power of computers, routinely cross-checks the data against your tax 
return to ensure that you have reported exactly what the brokerage house 
reported. (Similar forms covering interest and dividend payments are completed 
and filed by brokerages, corporations and financial institutions.) 
</P>
<P>
However, merely reporting the sale of securities on the Form 1099-B isn't where 
your obligation as a taxpayer ends. You must also tell the IRS how much money 
you made -- or lost -- in the deal. This computation requires you to state what 
you paid for the shares and calculate your so-called "taxable basis" in the 
securities. The difference between the basis and the sales price -- if the 
sales price is greater -- is the amount on which you are obligated to pay 
taxes. If the sales price is lower than the taxable basis, you are allowed to 
deduct the difference between the two amounts as a loss. These computations 
must be completed on Schedule D of the tax form and filed with your 1040 form. 
The IRS says it is the obligation of all owners of securities to keep records 
of their holdings, their original costs and any transactions affecting their 
taxable bases in these securities. 
</P>
<P>
In most cases, this is where it ends. However, if you are one of those lucky 
individuals selected for an IRS audit, you may be required to prove how you 
arrived at the taxable basis for your just-sold securities. If your records 
can't satisfy the IRS, you could be liable for taxes on the full amount of the 
proceeds from the sale. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Several years ago, I started purchasing U.S. Series E Savings Bonds. I am 
now wondering if I can give these bonds to a minor child as the beginning of a 
college fund. If I do this, is the interest taxed at the child's rate? -- D. E. 
J. 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes, interest accumulated after the gift is made would be taxed at the 
recipient's rate, regardless of his age. If the recipient is a child under age 
14, the first $500 is tax-free. Income from $500 to $1,000 is taxed at 15%, and 
income over $1,000 per year is taxed at the parents' highest rate. Children age 
14 or older are taxed at their own (generally lower) rates. 
</P>
<P>
However, be advised that as a donor you may not escape taxation on the interest 
that has already accumulated on the savings bonds you are giving away. This 
means that before you give these bonds to the child, you must determine how 
much interest they have earned while you have owned them. You must declare this 
interest -- even though you are not actually pocketing it -- as income on your 
tax return. 
</P>
<P>
A helpful tool in calculating what you owe is the savings bond interest rate 
report prepared by the Savings Bond division of the Treasury Department. To 
obtain the report, send a postcard to the U.S. Savings Bond Division, Public 
Affairs Office, asking for its "guaranteed minimum rate chart." This list is 
published monthly and includes the minimum interest rates paid on all 
outstanding Savings Bonds. The address is 1111-20 St. N.W., Dept. C.L., 
Washington, D.C. 20226.

<P>
You might also be interested in some recent changes affecting savings bonds and 
college education. Beginning in 1990, interest earned on newly issued Series EE 
bonds can be free from federal taxation if they are redeemed to pay for college 
or vocational school. 
</P>
<P>
However, as you might expect, there are several restrictions. Bond buyers must 
be at least 24 years old, and the tax break will apply only to bond proceeds 
used for tuition and required school fees -- not for books or room and board. 
In addition, it will apply only to degree programs at colleges, universities 
and certain vocational schools. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the tax break can be used only by families and individuals meeting 
certain income standards. The upper limits are an adjusted gross income of 
$90,000 for couples filing jointly and $55,000 for individual filers. 
</P>

Q: A recent column dealing with pension withdrawals and payments said the 
federal government had only one firm regulation regarding disbursements, namely 
that pension funds are required to start making disbursements to all 
participants at age 70 1/2, regardless of whether they are still on the job. I 
am over age 70 1/2 and still employed by the company in whose pension plan I am 
fully vested. I asked our corporate benefits manager about my pension payments 
and he says he doesn't know what law I am talking about. Can you help? -- J. A. 
M. 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes, but you might not like the answer. According to our pension experts, 
the regulations covering mandatory pension distributions at age 70 1/2 were 
contained in the tax reform legislation of 1986 and are now part of Section 
401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code. However, this section of the law did 
not become effective until Jan. 1, 1989, and affects only those people who turn 
age 70 1/2 on or after Jan. 1, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
People who turned age 70 1/2 before Jan. 1, 1988, are covered by the old law, 
which basically said that they were eligible to receive pension distributions 
at age 70 1/2 or when they stop working, whichever occurs later. So, if you 
turned age 70 1/2 before 1988, you are not eligible to receive any of your 
pension funds until you retire.

PERSONAL FINANCE / BILL SING: A SAFER WAY FOR SMALL INVESTORS TO BUY STOCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Bill Sing 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You think the stock market looks tempting: The Dow Jones industrial average is 
up 7.5% since Jan. 1 and volume has been picking up. But like most small 
investors these days, you hesitate to jump in for fear that equities may be 
peaking and are due for a big correction. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, many stock mutual fund companies in recent years have made this 
process easier, and as a result it is gaining popularity among many investors. 
</P>
<P>
Dollar cost averaging is, in effect, buying through an installment plan. 
Instead of investing in one lump sum, you invest in regular increments: say, 
$100 a month, instead of $1,000 all at once. 
</P>
<P>
Such a process relieves you of trying to predict market peaks and valleys -- 
something at which most investors, including professional money managers, fail 
miserably. If the market goes up, you will be thankful that you are earning 
profits while you continually invest more. If the market goes down, you will be 
happy because you will be buying shares at lower and lower prices, reducing 
your average costs. And you'll feel a lot better than had you invested your 
whole bundle at a market peak. 
</P>
<P>
One key to making dollar cost averaging work is being sure you don't stop when 
the market tumbles. 
</P>
<P>
"Dollar cost averaging is an excellent way to make any kind of investment, but 
the problem with it (is that) when things are going badly, investors stop," 
says Kurt Brouwer, a San Francisco investment adviser who manages mutual fund 
portfolios. "After the (October, 1987) crash, people just stopped. But that is 
exactly when you should be doing it, because you will be buying at the cheapest 
point." 
</P>
<P>
Another advantage of dollar cost averaging: It is a good form of forced 
savings, making you set aside a certain amount of your earnings every month for 
long-term investing. Over time, you could build a considerable nest egg that 
you can use to buy a home, fund your childrens' education or provide for a 
comfortable retirement. 
</P>
<P>
And dollar cost averaging gets you to think of stocks as a long-term 
investment, which is appropriate anyway for small investors who don't follow 
the market on a day-to-day basis like the pros. For while stocks definitely are 
more volatile than bonds or certificates of deposit, over the long run they 
consistently outperform other paper investments. 
</P>
<P>
Dollar cost averaging can be applied to individual stocks, but it is best 
applied to mutual funds. That is because buying individual stocks in small 
amounts can be costly; brokerage firms typically charge higher commission rates 
on smaller purchases. But applying dollar cost averaging to no-load mutual 
funds won't cost you anything extra, since those funds don't charge sales 
commissions anyway. And small investors gain diversification and professional 
management through mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
Realizing the demand among investors for dollar cost averaging, many larger 
fund groups have set up programs in recent years to do it for you. Many 
investors say they don't have the discipline to write a check every month on 
their own, says Stanley Egener, president of Neuberger &amp; Berman, a New York 
mutual fund company. 
</P>
<P>
Ask your fund group if it has such programs. 
</P>
<P>
Some fund families, such as T. Rowe Price, will arrange with your employer to 
have a certain amount -- as little as $50 a month -- automatically taken from 
your paycheck at work. The money is then invested directly into the fund of 
your choice. Major employers doing this with T. Rowe Price include Hughes 
Aircraft, AT&amp;T, Unisys and Coldwell Banker, says T. Rowe Price spokesman 
Steve Norwitz. 
</P>
<P>
Other fund families, including Fidelity and many others, can arrange to have a 
set amount transferred from your checking account at a bank or savings and loan 
into a mutual fund. These usually require minimum monthly withdrawals of at 
least $50 or $100, but most larger banks and S&amp;Ls will do it, usually 
without charge. T. Rowe Price also allows you to order discretionary transfers 
through a toll-free telephone number. In any case, you generally will need to 
first open an account in the fund you are transferring money into, meeting its 
initial minimum investment requirement. 
</P>
<P>
Still other fund groups, such as Neuberger &amp; Berman, will allow you to 
designate a set amount to be withdrawn each month from your money market mutual 
fund. That money is then reinvested into another fund in that group. Neuberger 
&amp; Berman, for example, requires you to place $5,000 or more into any one of 
its money market funds and then designate how much you want transferred on a 
monthly basis, with a minimum of $100 a month. 
</P>
<P>
And some fund groups, such as Fidelity and T. Rowe Price, will reinvest 
dividends or capital gains that your earn in one fund into another fund in that 
group. Fidelity, the nation's largest mutual fund group, just started such a 
program, called Directed Dividends. It, like other programs, first requires you 
to open an account in the fund to which you are transferring funds. 
</P>
<P>
These and other programs are provided free of charge by fund companies, 
although you will have to pay any loads (sales commissions) charged by the 
funds you are buying.

JAPAN TRADE SURPLUS RISES IN DECEMBER BUT DIPS FOR YEAR

Japan said Friday that its trade surplus in December was nearly $1 billion more 
than the same month in 1987, but for the year slipped 2% to $94.79 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The December trade surplus rose to $10.93 billion from $9.96 billion in the 
year-earlier month, the government said. 
</P>
<P>
The broader-based December current account surplus, which includes trade in 
both goods and services, fell to $9.27 billion from $9.44 billion in the 
year-earlier month. This was still above the previous month's $6.76 billion. 
</P>
<P>
For the whole year, Japan's trade surplus in goods and services fell nearly 9%, 
but economists see little hope for any cut in the surplus in 1989.

DOMESTIC CAR SALES FALL 5.8% IN JANUARY 
</P>

<P>
Hurt by weak sales in early January, U.S. car sales dropped 5.8% last month, 
the automotive industry reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Automotive analysts said that the totals would have been much worse if not for 
increased sales in the last 10 days of the month. 
</P>
<P>
The total automotive industry, including both imports and domestics, reported 
sales of 716,367 autos in January, compared to 760,625 autos in January, 1988. 
Sales of domestic cars fell 3.9% for the month, while imported car sales 
dropped 10.3% from year-ago levels. 
</P>
<P>
"The last 10 days really pulled up the whole month," said Cynthia Certo, an 
automotive analyst with Integrated Automotive Resources, a Wayne, Pa.-based 
automotive research firm. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that sales faltered in the beginning of the month because the 
vigorous sales push by auto manufacturers in the last 10 days of 1988 was 
highly effective. This resulted in slower-than-usual sales at the beginning of 
the new year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Incentive Programs 
</P>
<P>
"There was grave concern earlier in the year," said Chris Cedergren, an 
automotive analyst with J. D. Power &amp; Associates, an automotive research 
firm in Agoura Hills. "All the prognosticators were saying it was doom and 
gloom for the automotive manufacturers. We believed (that the weak sales) were 
payback from the strong selling period in the final 10 days of December. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a tremendous upswing for the final 10 days which saved the month. . 
. . The bottom line is that sales aren't great. They're OK or good." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts added that extensive incentive programs helped the domestic vehicles 
in the last 10 days of January. For the month, General Motor's sales fell 
11.1%, while Ford's sales rose 3.6%, and Chrysler's sales dropped 6.7%. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler's sales were hurt this month because it recently ceased production of 
its Reliant and Aries models, and hasn't yet replaced them with its new A-body 
vehicles, the Spirit and Acclaim. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
AUTO SALES 
</P>
<P>
Percentage changes in auto sales for the month of January are based on daily 
rates rather than total sales volume. There were 25 selling days in the current 
period and 25 in the year-ago period.

With its growing ethnic communities, Los Angeles has become known as America's 
new Ellis Island. Since its founding in 1781, however, when 44 black, mulatto, 
mestizo, Indian and Spanish settlers arrived to found the Pueblo, Los Angeles 
always has portrayed a global village. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps no neighborhood in Los Angeles reflects this multiracial history as 
clearly as does the city's oldest district of Chinatown. Located north of 
downtown Los Angeles, the area has experienced successive waves of new 
immigrants, including Indian, Spanish, Mexican, Italian, French, Chinese, 
Anglo-American, Filipino, Croatian, Vietnamese and Cambodian. 
</P>
<P>
This three-hour walking tour explores landmarks reflecting the Pueblo's 
multiracial history, as well as providing an overview of the area's rich 
historic architecture, ethnic eateries, crowded shopping streets, pedestrian 
pathways and cultural monuments. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Enter the New Year 
</P>
<P>
Further, as Monday marks the Chinese New Year, followed by Lion Dances 
throughout Chinatown on Feb. 12, the Chinatown Community Carnival on Feb. 17-19 
and the traditional Golden Dragon Parade on Feb. 18, this is an ideal time to 
explore the area. 
</P>
<P>
The walk begins at Union Station on Alameda Street, where parking is $4. This 
is one of the last great rail-passenger terminals built in the country, was 
designed by John and Donald Parkinson and built in the late '30s. Los Angeles' 
Old Chinatown once stood at this site, until it was demolished for the 
station's Spanish Moderne facilities, which still welcome thousands of train 
passengers each day. 
</P>
<P>
Cross Alameda Street and walk west toward the Plaza. On the northwest corner of 
Alameda and Los Angeles streets stands the Placita de Dolores, a plaza 
decorated with a tile mural by Eduardo Carrillo, and a replica of the Bell of 
Dolores, commemorating the Mexican Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
In front of the Placita grows a small garden of native plants, dedicated to the 
history and culture of the native California Indians. 
</P>
<P>
As many as 200 Indians once lived in Yang-na, the Basin's largest Indian 
village, which existed near present-day City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 2, 1769, the Spanish soldiers and padres on the Portola Expedition, the 
first Europeans to explore the region, stayed overnight along the river near 
Yang-na. Upon seeing the clear, sweet waters of the river, with its rich black 
soil, flowering wild roses, huge sycamore trees and wild grapes, the site was 
praised as ideal for a future settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Walk south along Los Angeles Street, noting the statue of Junipero Serra set in 
the trees across the street. Father Serra, who established the first nine of 
California's 21 missions, also was responsible for much of the missionization 
of the Indians, who were forced to leave their villages and work on the mission 
lands. 
</P>
<P>
Modern Los Angeles began humbly on Sept. 4, 1781, when 44 poor settlers arrived 
from Mexico to found El Pueblo de Nuestra Senora la Reina de Los Angeles de 
Porciuncula, today known simply as Los Angeles. No one knows exactly where 
these settlers first built their makeshift houses of willow branches, tule 
reeds and mud. After several floods, however, in 1815 they relocated their 
little pueblo just north of where the Old Plaza Church is now. In 1818, the 
Plaza was moved to its present location. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Plaza area is part of El Pueblo de Los Angeles State Historic Park, 
containing 27 historic structures dating from 1818 to 1926. The park offers for 
50 cents an excellent detailed walking-tour brochure that describes most of the 
sites. Free, docent-led walking tours also are offered Tuesday through Saturday 
from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. to anyone meeting in front of the firehouse. 
</P>
<P>
At 134 Paseo de la Plaza rises the city's Firehouse No. 1, built in 1884. 
Inside the two-story brick building is a small firefighters' museum. 
</P>
<P>
South of the firehouse, at 419 N. Los Angeles St., stands the Garnier Building 
of red brick and rusticated sandstone. Built in 1890 by Philippe Garnier, it 
remains the oldest and most important remnant of Los Angeles' original 
Chinatown. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Male House Servants 
</P>
<P>
In 1850, the U.S. Census recorded two Chinese male house servants living among 
the Pueblo's 1,610 residents. However, as the northern gold fields were played 
out and new railroad building demanded laborers, many more Chinese immigrated 
to the Southland. By 1870, more than 200 Chinese lived in the Pueblo. 
</P>
<P>
East of the 400 block of Los Angeles Street once existed the most notorious 
street in all of Los Angeles: Calle de los Negros. In the 1850s, the dirt 
alley's one-story adobe buildings housed saloons, prostitution dens and 
gambling halls, attracting thugs and thieves and earning it the title "the 
sinkhole of depravity" by the press. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1860s, many Chinese relocated to the alleyway, which was to become 
the site of the Pueblo's worst racial incident, known as the Chinese Massacre. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 24, 1871, an Anglo was shot and killed in the cross fire between two 
rival Chinese tongs, or gangs. Within hours, a hysterical mob of 500 Angelenos 
besieged and attacked the Chinese residences, brutally lynching 18 Chinese men. 
</P>
<P>
Walk along the south side of the Plaza and turn left on Main Street. The Pico 
House at 424 N. Main St. was built in 1869-70 by Pio Pico, the last Mexican 
governor of California. The Italianate-style structure was the Pueblo's first 
three-story hotel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Century of Theater 
</P>
<P>
Next to the Pico House, at 420 N. Main St., stands the Merced Theater, 
constructed in 1870 as the city's first true theater. 
</P>
<P>
The oldest building south of the Plaza is the Masonic Hall at 416 N. Main St., 
which houses a small museum of Masonic history. 
</P>
<P>
Walk south to Arcadia Street, cross Main Street, turn right and walk to the 
Mission-style Old Plaza Church at 535 N. Main St. Built between 1818 and 1822, 
Plaza Church is the city's oldest Catholic church. A shimmering Byzantine 
mosaic of the image of Our Lady of the Angels, inspired by a similar mosaic in 
the Porciuncula Chapel near Assisi, graces the front on the old church. 
</P>
<P>
Walk into the church courtyard to see the shrine to the Virgin of Guadalupe, 
and then cross Main Street to the Plaza. Paved with bricks, shaded by 
century-old Moreton Bay fig trees, the Plaza remains the historic heart of Los 
Angeles and evokes an Old World charm with its pigeons, benches and lacy 
gazebo. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rejuvenated Marketplace 
</P>
<P>
Walk north along Olvera Street, the narrow brick alleyway that is lined with 88 
booths and shops selling huaraches, pinatas, handblown glass and other Mexican 
curios. It's a festive Mexican marketplace today, yet in 1920, the alley was 
nothing more than a dirt-covered trough lined with crumbling adobes and other 
aging structures. 
</P>
<P>
When the city condemned the lane, a woman named Christina Sterling recognized 
its irreplaceable historic heritage and fought to renovate the area as a 
historical and tourist center. 
</P>
<P>
At No. 10 stands the Avila Adobe, the city's oldest existing residence, built 
circa 1818. The house contains historic exhibits on early California rancho 
life, the history of water in Los Angeles and the life and work of Christina 
Sterling (see below). (Open Tuesday-Friday, 10 a.m.-3 p.m.; Saturdays and 
Sundays, 10 a.m.-4:25 p.m.) 
</P>
<P>
The historic park's visitor center is located in the Sepulveda House, at No. 
W-12, which offers a free film on the history of the Pueblo, a gift shop and 
bookstore and historic exhibits. (Open Monday-Friday, 10 a.m.-3 p.m.; Saturday, 
10 a.m.-4:30 p.m.) 
</P>
<P>
At the end of Olvera Street, turn left, walk to Main Street and cross Macy 
Street. Walk one more block west on Macy Street and turn right on Spring 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Change of Pace 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, a commercial setting from old Shanghai surrounds you. Tawdry brick 
buildings display signs advertising acupuncture and herb shops, Vietnamese 
cafes, a Chinese cinema and wholesale meats. The sidewalks become more crowded. 
Smells of fresh seafood and ginseng waft from several storefronts. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1850s, this neighborhood was known as Sonoratown, because hundreds of 
the gold seekers from the Mexican state of Sonora settled here on their way to 
the Northern California gold fields. 
</P>
<P>
Later, in the 1930s, Christina Sterling attempted to revitalize the area with a 
romanticized Chinese-themed tourist center called China City, modeled after her 
success with Olvera Street. By 1949, after several devastating fires, China 
City had disappeared. Yee Mee Loo Restaurant, at 690 N. Spring St., established 
in 1939, reflects a glimmer of China City's heyday, with its faded photos of 
Hollywood stars and its 1940s jukebox. 
</P>
<P>
One of Chinatown's legendary Cantonese seafood restaurants is Monkee's, at 679 
N. Spring St. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fresh Fowl 
</P>
<P>
For a look at one of Chinatown's more unusual services, stop at Shang Lee 
Poultry, at 711 N. Spring St., where chickens, quail, chukar and pigeons are 
dressed to order. (Be forewarned that watching the fowl being killed can upset 
even the least squeamish.) 
</P>
<P>
(Although not on our mapped walk, Philippe the Original, one of Los Angeles' 
oldest cafes and famous for its French-dip sandwiches, is a block away at the 
northwest corner of Ord and Alameda Streets.) 
</P>
<P>
Continuing on the mapped walk, turn left on Ord Street. Once this area was the 
center of Los Angeles' Italian district, but most recently Vietnamese and 
Cambodian Chinese have opened cafes, garment outlets and newsstands. 
</P>
<P>
Cross Hill Street and turn left on Yale Street, which parallels Hill. Six aging 
turn-of-the-century cottages, shaded by tattered avocado trees, line Yale 
Street, hosting small businesses and fraternal associations. 
</P>
<P>
Turn right on Sunset Boulevard, then turn right on Hill Place, a narrow 
hillside lane occasionally offering vistas down into the river-side valley 
where the Pueblo first began. Amazingly, simple Victorian cottages from the 
late 1800s at Nos. 633, 643, 700, 713, 743 and 747 still edge the quiet street; 
note the different patterns of shingles, corbels and decorative scrollwork. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Croatian Period 
</P>
<P>
At 756 Hill Place, turn left into the alleyway to the rear door of St. Andrew's 
Croatian Church and peer inside. Built in 1910, when a sizeable Yugoslavian 
community was centered here, the church contains remarkable stained-glass 
windows and Gothic Revival altars imported from Austria. 
</P>
<P>
Turn right on Grand Avenue and then right again on Alpine Street, which leads 
downhill into the cultural heart of Chinatown. 
</P>
<P>
Turn left on Yale Street. At the Alpine Recreation Center's front lawn, many 
elderly Chinese practice tai chi in the mornings. On the east side of Yale 
stands Castelar Elementary School, the Chinese Confucian Temple and the 
Chinatown Branch of the L.A. Public Library. 
</P>
<P>
Turn right on College Street. At No. 531 is French Hospital, the second oldest 
hospital in Southern California, established in 1860 when this area had a large 
French community. 
</P>
<P>
Turn left on North Hill Street. Mid-block at Gin Ling Way, walk into Chungking 
Court, built in the late 1940s as New Chinatown's West Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Community Project 
</P>
<P>
Cross Hill Street and walk through the ornate West Gate, the district's oldest 
pai lou (gateway). Gin Ling Way leads into the heart of New Chinatown, which 
was begun in the late 1930s by the Chinese American community, seeking to 
rebuild what was lost to Union Station. In 1938, New Chinatown broke ground as 
the nation's first community to be wholly owned, planned, financed and 
controlled by its Chinese residents. 
</P>
<P>
As you walk along Gin Ling Way, look up at the ornate roofs and lavish 
architectural details. Architects Erle Webster and Adrian Wilson worked closely 
with the community to devise a new style, called "Chinese American." Masonry 
and stuccoed, wood-framed buildings were accentuated with intricately carved 
rafters, upsweeping tile roofs, Chinese-patterned window screens and tiered 
pagoda-like roofs trimmed in neon. 
</P>
<P>
Stop at Peter Soo Hoo Plaza, which features a plaque honoring both Peter Soo 
Hoo Sr. and Herbert Lapham, leaders of the New Chinatown project. A statue of 
Dr. Sun Yat-sen, who led the overthrow of the Manchu Dynasty, stands in the 
Plaza's center. 
</P>
<P>
Turn left at North Broadway and walk to the Phoenix Bakery at No. 969, one of 
the area's oldest and busiest bakeries, renowned for its strawberry 
whipped-cream cake. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Italian Remnant 
</P>
<P>
Turn around and walk south on North Broadway. Little Joe's Italian Restaurant 
at 900 N. Broadway, started in 1910 and moved here in 1926, serves as a 
reminder of the area's once-thriving Italian community. 
</P>
<P>
North Broadway, with its numerous Chinese cafes, markets, herb and tea shops, 
is the commercial heart of Chinatown. Exotic scents of incense, ginseng, 
seafood, live poultry and barbecued duck fill the crowded sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
A few landmark shops include: Han San Co. for herbs (No. 841); Ten Ren's Tea 
and Ginseng Shop for one of the area's largest and finest selections of 
Taiwanese teas, where the staff often demonstrates the Chinese tea ceremony 
(No. 811); United Seafood for live lobster, crab and catfish (419 Alpine St.); 
Superior Poultry, with live geese, squab, duck, chukar and even rabbits (No. 
750). 
</P>
<P>
After exploring the numerous shops and markets, you may want to conclude your 
walk with dim sum, especially popular at Mirawa Restaurant, at 750 N. Hill St., 
or A.B.C. Seafood Restaurant, at 205 Ord St., which serve dim sum between noon 
and 3 p.m.

HE'S THE KEEPER OF THE FLAME FOR LIGHTHOUSES

<P>
There is no structure as altruistic as a lighthouse. Its only purpose is to 
serve humanity. 
</P>
<P>
 -- George Bernard Shaw 
</P>
<P>
Today, Wayne Wheeler will officially launch the start of the Bicentennial of 
the Lighthouse by cutting the ribbon and delivering the keynote address at the 
rededication of the 1846 Key West, Fla., Lighthouse. 
</P>
<P>
Wheeler, 50, known to lighthouse aficionados from coast to coast as Mr. 
Lighthouse, probably knows more about the quaint sentinels that guide ships 
into safe harbor than anyone alive. 
</P>
<P>
The bearded, blue-eyed San Franciscan is founder-president of the 4,000-member 
nonprofit historical and educational U.S. Lighthouse Society, sponsor of the 
yearlong salute to the lighthouse. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a wave of lighthouse restoration projects going on all along 
America's coasts and the shores of the Great Lakes," Wheeler explains. "At Key 
West, for example, $250,000 was raised in fund drives to restore the lighthouse 
abandoned by the Coast Guard 20 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Wheeler will be busy this year, attending a number of lighthouse rededications 
at bicentennial celebrations -- many on July 4, and some on Aug. 7, set aside 
by the U.S. Senate as National Lighthouse Day. 
</P>
<P>
It was on Aug. 7, 1789, that President George Washington signed the Lighthouse 
Act, the first public-works act of the new nation, transferring 12 lighthouses 
to the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
Newport, R.I., will be the site of the 200th birthday party for lighthouses. 
The Coast Guard Academy Band will perform, there will be a parade, photograph 
and art exhibits and workshops pertaining to the history of lighthouses, old 
keepers swapping stories and the "Ida Rather Be Rowing Regatta," named after 
legendary lighthouse keeper Ida Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis died of a stroke at the Lime Rock Lighthouse in Rhode Island in 1911 
after tending the light for more than 50 years. She saved 18 lives and became a 
national hero, with her picture appearing on the cover of Harper's Weekly in 
July, 1869. 
</P>
<P>
In 1910, there were 800 lighthouses in operation in the United States, manned 
by 1,659 civilian keepers from the U.S. Lighthouse Service. It was the heyday 
of the colorful structures, which the Senate resolution described as 
symbolizing "safety, security, heroism, duty and faithfulness." 
</P>
<P>
In 1939, the Coast Guard assumed responsibility for lighthouses. During the 
last 25 years, all but nine of the more than 750 lighthouses have been 
automated. Many have been replaced, in the words of Wheeler, "by rotating aero 
beacons stuck up on ungainly poles." 
</P>
<P>
Wheeler, a native of Buffalo, N.Y., was a Coast Guard officer from 1963 to 
1975, and the civilian assistant chief to navigation aids for the Coast Guard 
in San Francisco from 1976 to 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"I started the U.S. Lighthouse Society in 1984 in the dining room of my home," 
Wheeler said. "For three years I worked 40 hours a week for the Coast Guard, 35 
hours a week for the Lighthouse Society. 
</P>
<P>
"The society got so big I had to quit the Coast Guard," explained Wheeler, a 
self-proclaimed "lighthouse nut." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Poetry and Songs 
</P>
<P>
In 1977, he put together a slide show on the history of lighthouses, beginning 
with the 45-story Pharos at Alexandria, Egypt, constructed in 280 BC and one of 
the Seven Wonders of the World. During his presentation, he recites lighthouse 
poetry, sings sea chanteys and delights audiences with legends and lore of 
lighthouses. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Lighthouse has been on the lecture circuit with his one-man show ever 
since. 
</P>
<P>
"I quickly learned there are people all over America who, like me, are crazy 
about lighthouses, even people in landlocked places like North Dakota. . . . I 
decided there ought to be an organization for lighthouse nuts like myself." 
</P>
<P>
Today, nearly five years later, lighthouse lovers in every state and 13 nations 
are members of the U.S. Lighthouse Society. They include Walter Fanning, the 
group's 80-year-old vice president, who was born in a lighthouse, and Connie 
Small, 87, an ex-lighthouse keeper's wife who wrote the book "Lighthouse 
Keeper's Wife." 
</P>
<P>
For $20 a year dues, members receive the Keeper's Log, a magazine filled with 
features, photographs, sketches and historic accounts about lighthouses and 
those who staff them. Each issue of the Log carries stories about famous 
lighthouses, like America's first lighthouse: Little Brewster Island, erected 
in 1716 in Boston and blown up by the British in 1786. America's first keeper, 
George Worthylake, drowned two years after the lighthouse was built, a fate 
remembered over the years by scores of keepers in storms and in rescue 
attempts. 
</P>
<P>
The Lighthouse Society headquarters -- on the fifth floor of a downtown San 
Francisco building at 244 Kearny St. -- is a museum of lighthouse artifacts, 
photographs and information about lighthouses. 
</P>
<P>
The Lighthouse Society sponsors an annual fog-calling contest and photography 
contests and works tirelessly for the preservation and restoration of 
lighthouses throughout America. 
</P>
<P>
The society owns the 128-foot lightship Relief, one of the last of the Coast 
Guard relics that served as floating lighthouses.

PREVIN WIELDS BATON -- AND SCISSORS -- FOR ERICKSON PREMIERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, Times Music Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Strange happenings at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. Andre Previn and the Los 
Angeles Philharmonic had scheduled a world premiere on Thursday: Robert 
Erickson's "Corona," completed in 1986. They ended up offering only a portion 
of a world premiere. 
</P>
<P>
Although the management deemed the action worthy of neither a public 
announcement nor an official explanation, Previn had cut the work drastically 
at the last moment. How much he cut remained a mystery for a while. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to initial questions, a spokesman for the orchestra reported that 
about seven minutes had been dropped from what would have been a 20-minute 
piece. Other sources, however, claimed that "Corona" should have lasted 26 
minutes and that half was missing. Some morning-after sleuthing suggested that 
the other sources were right. 
</P>
<P>
What remained was a typical Erickson tone poem -- tough, tight, ruggedly 
individualistic and constantly engaging. The impressionistic title, according 
to an utterly inadequate program note, refers to the "brilliant halo of light 
and ever-changing shape" associated with an eclipse of the sun. 
</P>
<P>
Juxtaposing gleaming and blazing sonorities, expanding and compressing key 
motives, contrasting dramatic blasts with lyrical echoes, the composer 
constructed a fascinating crescendo of bright colors and primitive dynamics. Or 
so it seemed. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview on Friday, Previn stated that this piece, commissioned 
before his arrival here, "was not in the same league as previous Erickson 
pieces." The basic problem, he said, involved redundancy. "A unison F-natural 
for 25 minutes -- that's too long." 
</P>
<P>
The music director added that the players had "laughed through one and a half 
hours" of rehearsal. "They could not figure it out," he said, "and the 
composer, who has been ill, was incommunicado." 
</P>
<P>
The only solution, he apparently thought, was deletion. "I decided to undertake 
some laborious cuts -- two bars here, one bar there, no big chunks. I took out 
the minimalist longueurs. If I didn't do that, I thought the audience would go 
crazy. We were going to have a very, very bad time as it was." 
</P>
<P>
Reached at his home in San Diego, Erickson registered surprise at the turn of 
events. "I'm sorry they did not do the whole piece," he said. "I look forward 
to a complete performance. It is a damn shame." 
</P>
<P>
Had he been consulted regarding any possible abridgement? 
</P>
<P>
"No." 
</P>
<P>
Did he agree with the conductor's stylistic evaluation? 
</P>
<P>
"The last thing the piece does is flirt with minimalism." 
</P>
<P>
Previn had claimed that he found himself in a no-win situation. "If I play the 
music as written, I do the gentleman a disservice. If I cut, I am accused of 
tampering. If I cancel, I am accused of bad faith." 
</P>
<P>
Bad faith, in this case, might have better served artistic integrity. 
</P>
<P>
The remainder of the program proved less controversial. Jean-Philippe Collard 
made his belated Philharmonic debut in a big, broad, unabashedly impetuous yet 
appropriately sentimental performance of Rachmaninoff's First Piano Concerto. 
Previn and the orchestra provided lush yet sensitive accompaniment. This was 
good goo. 
</P>
<P>
After intermission, Previn came up with a brisk, brusque and technically 
brilliant performance of Beethoven's Fifth. The audience seemed to appreciate 
the pervasive streamlining, up to and including the raucous and clunky finale.

PIANIST LANZ SHOWS KEY TO NEW AGE MUSIC

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Has New Age music hit its peak? Have the soft and gentle sounds variously 
described as "yuppie elevator music" and "easy listening wallpaper" proved to 
be nothing more than the disco fad of the '80s? 
</P>
<P>
Pianist David Lanz doesn't think so. One of New Age-oriented Narada Records' 
premier artists, the Seattle-based pianist thinks the problem lies in a 
misunderstanding of the term. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't bother me at all to think of myself as a New Age musician because 
the idea has been around for a long time, and still has plenty of vitality," he 
said in a phone interview this week. "As a matter of fact, I like to think of 
myself as a New Age musician -- that is, a musician who's starting to wake up. 
Because the more people wake up, the more they realize they have to take care 
of themselves, take care of their bodies. If music can help them do it -- 
that's all to the good." 
</P>
<P>
"To me, the crystals and all that stuff are just the trappings, and some people 
get hung up on all of that -- on the exterior, on all the merchandising and 
souvenirs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"As I understand New Age, it's a reference to a time that hasn't arrived yet, a 
Utopian time that's still in the future," he said. "Music is supposed to be one 
of the elements that ushers it in." 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, at the Long Beach Convention Center's Center Theater, Lanz will 
perform some of the solo piano pieces that represent his share in ushering in 
that Utopian era. Guitarist John Doan, another Narada artist, will open the 
show. 
</P>
<P>
Lanz came to New Age music somewhat indirectly, via a strong interest in 
meditation and philosophy. With roots in jazz and small band performance, his 
evolution into New Age soloist came in several phases. 
</P>
<P>
"At first," he explained, "I had the attitude most performers have, which was 
that if I write in a certain style, I'll make money; I felt I had to think 
about writing hits. 
</P>
<P>
"But as I started to read, and learned more about the scientific and spiritual 
relationship between music, tone and color, I decided to turn my back on that 
attitude and just do the most natural thing. When I started, I was really 
embarrassed by the music I was writing, because it was so simple, and so 
melodic. I'd studied and played a lot of jazz, and what I was doing didn't seem 
dissonant or complex enough. I had all those intellectual reservations." 
</P>
<P>
Lanz's breakthrough came when he pushed the intellectual and musical 
reservations aside and, as he put it, "just started being myself, totally, and 
let my music reflect that. In a way, my approach to New Age music is a bit like 
talking to a friend. You don't have to be very complicated when you speak. If 
you say what's in your heart, it's usually very simple." 
</P>
<P>
Lanz's approach has apparently worked. His most recent album, "Cristofori's 
Dream," hit the top of Billboard magazine's New Age listings, and two earlier 
albums (both recorded with guitarist Paul Speer) have continued to appear in 
the Top 20.

BACK-TO-BACK SEQUELS FOR 'BACK TO FUTURE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE WEINSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael J. Fox and director Robert Zemeckis will reunite later this month to 
begin filming two sequels of their 1985 hit "Back to the Future." 
</P>
<P>
Universal Pictures' unusual plan to produce the two films back to back is 
intended to keep production costs down and to take advantage of an extended 
break in Fox's schedule. Fox is currently wrapping up the seventh and final 
season of NBC's "Family Ties," and he will work simultaneously on the TV show 
and the first sequel when the film goes into production Feb. 20. 
</P>
<P>
Universal plans to release the new films in the winter of 1989 and the summer 
of 1990, respectively. Though Zemeckis, who was honored this week with a 
Director's Guild of America Award nomination for "Who Framed Roger Rabbit," 
would not reveal any plot details, both films are expected to involve time 
travel and some elaborate production effects. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview Friday, Zemeckis said the "two movies would have 
average scale budgets for big movies," but he declined to give any exact dollar 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
"You never know how the audience will respond to these characters again," 
Zemeckis said, when asked whether the premise and characters of the first film 
would remain fresh and attractive through two additional installments. "We feel 
close to these characters, and we didn't want other people to do the sequel. We 
didn't want to see our material tampered with." 
</P>
<P>
The sequels are reuniting virtually all of the key production people and cast 
members from the original film. They will be produced under the banner of 
Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment and Spielberg will again serve as 
executive producer; Zemeckis and his long-time writing collaborator Bob Gale 
are teaming up again on the scripts; and Gale and Neil Canton, co-producers of 
"Back to the Future," will co-produce Parts 2 and 3. STEVE WEINSTEIN

KODO CALTECH CONCERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We may be moving toward a kinder, gentler America, but Kodo seems, if anything, 
more stern and concentrated than ever. The group's One Earth Tour this year 
brought it to Beckman Auditorium at Caltech in Pasadena Thursday and Friday, 
with a characteristically tight, intense program. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese drummers' intermissionless performance has been purged of its 
feminine elements, dropping the costumed, quasi-narrative folk dances, leaving 
a forceful, almost stark program of music as martial art. Even their shamisen 
duet, in the loud, florid Tsugaru style, seemed a grim, ritual duel. 
</P>
<P>
When Kodo relaxes, however, it does so with athletic exuberance. The centrally 
placed, processional "Issen" and the encores brought the house lights up and 
the beaming drummers out, capering in the aisles and playing to the audience 
with all the joyful zest of the Oba Oba cast. 
</P>
<P>
As experienced Thursday, the program proved familiar in outline and many 
details. It began with Maki Ishii's racketing "Dyu-Ha," bringing the drummers 
onstage through the audience, pounding wooden clappers, and built carefully to 
the entrance of the massive o-daiko and the great drum's ceremonial thunder. 
</P>
<P>
In between, the agenda touched varied topics. Its lyrical -- but always tautly 
focused -- items were Motofumi Yamaguchi's "Hae," for koto, oke-daiko and steel 
drums, and shinobue flute songs, one with antiphonal response from the balcony. 
</P>
<P>
"Ryogen no Hi," with its leaping, combative cymbals, and Leonard Mitsutada 
Eto's "Yu Karak" provided moments of athletic humor. It is, however, the fury 
and impossibly disciplined speed of Roetsu Tosha's "Chonlima," the savage 
"Miyake" assault on the large miya-daikos, and the strenuous "Yatai Bayashi" 
finale that are most characteristic. JOHN HENKEN

OFFICER CLEARED IN SHOOTING AT NEWPORT BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Finding no evidence of criminal wrongdoing, a county investigation has cleared 
a Newport Beach police officer who mistakenly shot and seriously wounded an 
unarmed Liberian immigrant along the beach last Labor Day weekend, the Orange 
County district attorney's office announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
At the moment of the Sept. 4, 1988, shooting, Officer Derek Duncan "reasonably 
and honestly, albeitly mistakenly, believed that he was being confronted by a 
life-threatening danger," investigators from the district attorney's office 
concluded in ruling out the possibility of criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
Sundaga Bryant, a former Orange resident who now lives in Santa Ana, was 
critically wounded in his arms and torso by a single blast from Duncan's 
.12-gauge shotgun. Bryant, 26 at the time, is now suing the city of Newport 
Beach and Duncan for at least $1 million in damages, claiming negligence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sawed-Off Shotgun Report 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach police, backed by Friday's finding, said the officer honestly 
mistook the portable radio that Bryant was carrying for a gun in the 
early-morning shooting. Just moments earlier, police had received a report of a 
man on the beach carrying a sawed-off shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant, stifled by the intense heat that September morning, took a walk along 
the Balboa shore with his wife around 2 a.m. About an hour later, after the 
report of a man with a shotgun, Officer Duncan spotted Bryant on the beach and 
ordered him to "freeze." When Bryant began to turn, Duncan shot him once 
through the arms and torso, according to police accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Wallace J. Wade refused to discuss details of his office's 
investigation of the shooting, citing the ongoing civil litigation. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm comfortable with the conclusion we reached," Wade said. "There were a lot 
of factors to consider. Our feeling was that this was a tragic situation 
because Mr. Bryant was clearly an innocent victim caught up in this, and the 
intense emotions complicated our investigation." 
</P>
<P>
Bryant's attorney, Christian W. Keena of El Toro, said he anticipated the 
county's decision recommending against criminal charges but was still 
disappointed. "This is one of the worst negligence actions I've seen. I can't 
see how it could be justified," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Keena said he respected the work of Wade's office but added: "I think there 
might have been enough indication of wrongdoing to go to a grand jury with it. 
There has to be serious questions when you have an officer shining bright 
flashlights, and a man is shot at 12 feet from behind." 
</P>
<P>
Bryant could not be reached for comment. Keena described him as "very 
disappointed" and said he did not want him speaking with the press for several 
days. "He's extremely depressed, and, in fact, I'm going to call his doctor. 
This is all very hard for him to understand." 
</P>
<P>
An avid soccer player, Bryant was employed as a taxi driver and a nurse at the 
time of the shooting, his lawyer said. Suffering from intense pain and almost 
total loss of mobility in both arms, Bryant has not been able to return to 
work, Keena said. 
</P>
<P>
Keena said that with the criminal investigation over, he now hopes to move 
ahead with Bryant's civil suit against the city and Duncan to prove what he 
called "a clear case of liability." 
</P>
<P>
The shooting stirred charges of racism from some members of the local Liberian 
community who characterized the incident as an unprovoked attack on a black man 
who was with a white woman -- his wife. 
</P>
<P>
But investigators said they found no evidence of racism. And Keena, after 
initially raising the race issue as a possible factor when filing Bryant's 
civil suit, said Friday that he does not plan to pursue it. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Duncan, a member of the department for 3 years, was placed on 
administrative leave immediately after the shooting, as is standard procedure 
in such cases, according to Newport Beach police spokesman Robert Oakley. A few 
weeks later, Duncan -- then 25 -- returned to active duty after clearance by 
psychologists and investigators, Oakley said. 
</P>
<P>
Department investigators concluded that Duncan, mistaking Bryant's radio for a 
gun in the dark, had good reason to believe that he was threatened when Bryant 
turned toward him. 
</P>
<P>
Moments after the shooting, police detained a 14-year-old boy with a pellet gun 
-- the apparent subject of reports that morning of a man with a shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant's wife, Marlene Bryant, said she was sitting with the boy after the 
shooting and heard him ask an officer: "Am I the cause of this? Am I going to 
be blamed for this?" According to Marlene Bryant, the officer then responded: 
"Shut up. Haven't you caused enough trouble? See what you made me do." 
</P>
<P>
Duncan did not want to speak with the press Friday about the case, Oakley said. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting was one of two -- both non-fatal -- by a Newport Beach police 
officer in 1988, and the fifth in the county over the summer. Police spokesman 
Oakley said department investigators found no shortcomings in the way Duncan 
reacted to the situation that would warrant department policy changes. 
</P>
<P>
On the question of the shooting's implications for police procedures, Wade of 
the district attorney's office said, "That's up to the Newport Beach Police 
Department." 
</P>
<P>
The department, in a statement released after findings of the district 
attorney's office were made public, also voiced "its concerns and regrets for 
the unfortunate incident in which Mr. Sundaga Bryant was shot. We wish to 
sincerely express our hope for a complete recovery for Mr. Bryant for his 
tragic injuries."

6 ARRESTED, DRUGS SEIZED IN 3 RAIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal drug agents arrested five men and one woman in three early-morning 
raids Thursday in Anaheim and Fullerton, seizing marijuana, cocaine and black 
heroin valued at $246,000. 
</P>
<P>
Drug Enforcement Authority officials from Santa Ana seized 120 pounds of 
marijuana, 3 kilograms of cocaine, 6 ounces of heroin and $15,000, according to 
DEA agent Ralph Lochridge. 
</P>
<P>
At one of the Fullerton sites, agents found marijuana in four car tires that 
had been inflated and attached to rims. In addition to the drugs and money, the 
DEA seized two 9-millimeter pistols, two .22-caliber rifles and one AK-47 
assault rifle, Lochridge said. 
</P>
<P>
The arrests took place at 834 and 912 Whitewater Drive in Fullerton and at 1033 
N. Loara St. in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
The six suspects, ranging in age from 19 to 37, were arraigned Friday on 
charges of possession of marijuana, cocaine and black heroin for sale and are 
being held in Orange County Jail. Three of the suspects are being held in lieu 
of $1-million bail and the other three at $500,000 bail. The five men are all 
illegal aliens, and the woman is a U.S. citizen, Lochridge said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects were identified as Esteban Zepeda Barragan, 37; his wife, Yesenia 
Maria Quintana, 19; Andres Bautista Chavez, 23; Gustavo Leyva Ramirez, 27; 
Enrique Baltazar Aguirre, 28, and Rodrigo Nuno Murillo, 21. 
</P>
<P>
Lochridge said that the arrests were made after a 1-week investigation and that 
all the drugs had come from Mexico.

INNOCENT PLEA ENTERED IN SLAYING OF DOCTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Hollywood man accused in the slaying of a Newport Beach opthalmologist 
pleaded not guilty Friday to felony charges that he entered the doctor's 
oceanfront duplex and stabbed him to death. 
</P>
<P>
A preliminary hearing is scheduled for Feb. 27 for Allen John Lindsey, 23, to 
determine if there is sufficient evidence to try him for the murder of Dr. 
Boonkird Chulapatrcheevin, 45. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Public Defender Anthony C. Kies, representing Lindsey, asked Newport 
Beach Municipal Judge Francis Munoz to lower the suspect's $250,000 bail, but 
the judge refused. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsey was arrested last month after Los Angeles police saw him driving the 
victim's white Mercedes-Benz sedan, which was being sought in the investigation 
of the slaying, Newport Beach Police Officer Bob Oakley said. 
</P>
<P>
Chulapatrcheevin was found dead on the floor of his apartment by his younger 
brother who had gone to the duplex after he failed to show up at his Santa Ana 
office one day last month. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsey, who is being held in Orange County Jail, could face a prison term of 
26 years to life if convicted, Kies said.

SONGWRITER WINS TOP JAZZ PRIZE OF $5,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The $5,000 prize for best jazz song in the first Billboard Song Contest has 
gone to Ron Robbins of Irvine. Robbins' song, "Montego," was picked by jazz-pop 
stars George Benson and George Duke, the two judges in the jazz category. 
</P>
<P>
"Montego" now goes up against the winners in six other categories in the 
competition for a $25,000 grand prize. Judges will come from a panel that 
includes David Foster, Roy Clark, Quincy Jones, Julio Iglesias and Tammy 
Wynette, in addition to Benson and Duke. The winner will be announced next 
month, said contest spokesman Craig Melone. 
</P>
<P>
Melone said the 1988 contest, sponsored by Billboard magazine, received 
thousands of entries in each category. The contest is open to anyone who earns 
less than an average of $5,000 a year from songwriting.

3 MORE CARCASSES FOUND; 
</P>
<P>
FISHING NETS LINKED TO SEA LION DEATHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three more dead sea lions washed ashore Friday in Orange County, bringing to 34 
the revised total since the unexplained string of deaths began Jan. 21, the 
U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service reported. 
</P>
<P>
The three carcasses were found at Newport Beach, Huntington Beach and 
neighboring Bolsa Chica State Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The dead sea lion at Newport Beach washed up about 3 p.m. near 22nd Street on 
the city's Balboa Peninsula, said Lifeguard Rob Wyatt. Another carcass beached 
near M Street earlier in the day, he said, but that carcass had been reported 
to federal authorities on Thursday, when it was still floating offshore. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm beginning to believe the sea lions are dying through interaction with 
fishermen's nets out at sea," said Joe Cordaro, a wildlife biologist with the 
National Marine Fisheries Service office in Los Angeles. "I have no proof yet, 
but we are coming to this conclusion because everything else seems to be ruled 
out." 
</P>
<P>
Cordaro said necropsies performed Thursday on two dead sea lions found in 
Orange County revealed no evidence of gunshot wounds, parasite infections or 
illnesses. He said the federal agency previously ruled out the possibility that 
the sea lions were being killed by natural predators, such as sharks. 
</P>
<P>
The carcasses had washed ashore in Huntington Beach until Thursday, when four 
appeared on Newport Beach shores. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe the currents have changed," Wyatt said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities "don't know where out in the ocean the sea lions are dying," 
Cordaro said. "We don't know if it's some point off Huntington Beach because 
the currents could be carrying them for miles before they come ashore." 
</P>
<P>
Officials might not be informed about all of the beachings. For instance, 
William A. McGilligan of San Clemente said that an ill mammal, which he 
described as a seal, washed ashore near his home on Buena Vista on Tuesday 
afternoon. Cordaro, however, said Friday that his office had never been 
notified of an ill mammal beached in San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials have said they know of no coordinated effort by local, state 
and federal agencies to solve the mystery. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Wilkinson, an aide in the Washington office of Rep. C. Christopher Cox 
(R-Newport Beach) said Friday that "so far we haven't received a single call or 
letter from a constituent about this matter."

Orange County churches opened their doors to the homeless Friday night as a 
cold front brought raw, wet weather that is expected to continue through the 
weekend but will not interfere with two major events today. 
</P>
<P>
National Guard armories in Santa Ana and Fullerton, which normally take in the 
homeless during cold or inclement weather, were scheduled to be used this 
weekend for drills, so the First Presbyterian churches in Santa Ana and 
Fullerton filled their recreation halls with cots from the county, according to 
Bob Griffith, chief deputy director of the Orange County Social Services 
Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Buses Friday picked up the homeless who were unable to get into private 
shelters and delivered them to the churches, where they were to be fed Friday 
night and this morning, he said. 
</P>
<P>
At 9 p.m., 89 people were sheltered at the Santa Ana church and 51 in the 
Fullerton church. Both shelters will be open through the weekend. The armories 
will reopen on Monday night if the bad weather continues. 
</P>
<P>
The churches each will hold about 100 people -- 25 fewer than the armories -- 
but no one will have to sleep outside if they fill up, said Scott Mather, 
chairman of the Orange County Homeless Issues Task Force. "What we were able to 
do last time (in January, during another National Guard drill) was to take 
excess folks to another church. We won't put anybody out," he pledged. 
</P>
<P>
County officials open the shelters when there is a 50% chance of rain, or when 
the temperature drops below 40 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Forecasts Friday called for evening lows in the 40s, according to David 
Beusterien of WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts to the Times. By 6 
p.m., 0.12 of an inch of rain had fallen in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Today's forecast calls for rain turning into showers. A high today of 54 
degrees is forecast for Laguna Beach. Variable clouds with a chance of showers 
are forecast for Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Friday's rain during the rush hours caused serious problems for 
Orange County freeway commuters. 
</P>
<P>
"It just seemed like everybody was crashing," said Michael Lundquist, a 
spokesman for the California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1 and 8 p.m. Friday, there had been 10 injury and 61 non-injury 
accidents, he said. Accidents on county freeways had slowed traffic to a crawl 
Friday afternoon. At the interchange of the northbound Santa Ana Freeway and 
the San Diego Freeway, an afternoon accident caused a 5-mile backup in all 
lanes to Alicia Parkway, delaying commuters by 15 to 30 minutes, Lundquist 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Today, festivities are planned in Westminster for Tet, the Vietnamese New Year, 
which organizers say will be held rain or shine. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Pham, one of the organizers of the Tet Festival, said it is expected to 
attract more than 35,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
"We plan to be there at the scheduled time and hopefully everything will be 
fine," Pham said. Festivities, including a parade, food, folk dances and other 
activities, will be from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. today at Centennial Regional Park 
in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
And the Black History Parade will march through Santa Ana today with the 
dedication of the U.S. Postal Service, organizers said. "We'll be out there 
rain, shine, sleet or snow," said Carolyn Jackson, a parade organizer. "We're 
gonna have the parade." 
</P>
<P>
The 10 a.m. parade, which Santa Ana officials said attracted about 25,000 
spectators last year, will travel from 15th Street down Main Street to Civic 
Center Drive. It will head west on Civic Center Drive to the Unity Festival, 
scheduled to begin at 1 p.m. in Santa Ana Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
If heavy rain falls, Jackson said, the Unity Festival, which features 
continuous entertainment, food and craft booths, may be canceled. 
</P>
<P>
Turning to horticulture, if the weekend weather drops to the freezing point, 
agricultural experts fear that crops may be affected. 
</P>
<P>
Strawberries are the county's biggest crop and are in all stages of growth, 
with some fields still in the flowering stage while others are ready to be 
harvested. The last fields will be picked in late spring. If the plants are hit 
hard by frost, flowers and fruit alike will be ruined, according to Harry Otto, 
farm adviser for the University of California Cooperative Extension. 
</P>
<P>
Otto said he could not predict if growers would have to take preventive 
measures this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
When cold temperatures threaten, he said, growers use sprinklers on crops such 
as strawberries or wind machines in citrus orchards to guard against frost. 
</P>
<P>
Wind machines heat fields by mixing the cold air that settles near the ground 
with the higher, warmer air. However, he said, the machines are not as 
effective when the frigid temperatures are caused by cold fronts because there 
is not enough of the higher, warmer air. 
</P>
<P>
Sprinklers help the plants because when water freezes, the molecular action 
gives off heat that is absorbed by the plants' tissues, "even though the plants 
may be covered with ice," he said. However, "if the cold spell goes on for 
several days, you can't sprinkle night after night or you'll drown the plants," 
he added.

GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI: THIS TEAM IS NOT REAL, BUT IT HAS A GENUINE APPEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Gene Wojciechowski 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Visited the locker room of the Detroit Cougars the other night at the Flight 
Theater in Hollywood, home of the play, "Gameface," which was written by John 
Schalter and former Ram offensive lineman Russ Bollinger. 
</P>
<P>
Some team, these Cougars. 
</P>
<P>
Let's see, there's a steroid-stuffing, pill-popping, beer-chugging, womanizing 
linebacker named B.D. Murdock. There's a born-again, holier-than-thou teammate 
named Blake Walters; an aging cornerback/lawyer named Babs Winston who will try 
anything to remain in the game; a picket line-crossing running back named Tommy 
Nathan; an overweight lineman named Orwell Weaver and a rookie racist teammate 
named Kenny Samson, played nicely by Bollinger, by the way. Have I forgotten 
any stereotypes? 
</P>
<P>
Oh, yes, there's the scheming owner, the fatherly equipment manager, the 
drunkard doctor, the back-stabbing assistant coach, the buffoonish head coach, 
the goofy assistant equipment man and my personal favorites, the 
slimier-than-slime, resplendent-in-polyester sportswriter (what else?), Scott 
Schultz, and his knockout journalist-in-training, the beautiful Nancy Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
I'm no theater critic, but if this is your average National Football League 
team, someone better alert Commissioner Pete Rozelle -- and quick. And while 
they're at it, they might want to give a call to a sports editor or two. Scott 
and Nancy won't be winning the Pulitzer any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
Here's the plot, or at least, one of them: 
</P>
<P>
Our main man, B.D. Murdock, overhears a conversation involving the Cougars' 
owner. Seems the owner has devised a plan to force Murdock out of the league 
and, by doing so, also forces the linebacker to forfeit his big-money annuity 
plan. What Murdock doesn't know, is that the sportswriter has planted a 
voice-activated tape recorder (equipped, apparently, with what must be a 
remarkable 12-hour tape) atop a dressing stall ledge. Pretty clever. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, all of this takes place the day before the Cougars play the Dallas 
Stars in the conference championship game. 
</P>
<P>
As scenarios go, this one belongs in playwright hell. The tipoff is the 
sportswriter. No self-respecting scribe would accept this owner's offer; he 
would have asked for more. 
</P>
<P>
But for all the occasional holes in the plot -- some gaping, some hardly 
noticeable -- Bollinger and Schalter manage to convey the hypocrisy that is 
rarely seen outside a team's locker room. They've taken the familiar heavies -- 
the druggies, the God-squaders, the eccentrics, the racists, the corrupt -- and 
given them a good twist. Turns out the on-stage vignettes, not the unlikely 
main story, are what makes "Gameface" enjoyable, at times, even memorable. 
</P>
<P>
We learn that football teams aren't always happy families, that emotional 
schisms can contribute more to a loss than a faulty game plan. We learn 
ultimately that each player is alone, left only with his sometimes wavering 
convictions and his one asset -- his body. 
</P>
<P>
In a clever bit of writing, Bollinger and Schalter show how winning temporarily 
masks all hatred, all insecurity, all differences. One moment, the redneck 
rookie Samson is ready to fight the black running back Nathan. The next moment, 
they mug together for a postgame television interview. 
</P>
<P>
The born-again player swears allegiance to the Lord, going so far as to ask in 
the pregame prayer that "may the best team win." But in the end, he wants the 
victory more than anything. He may tote a Bible, but deep in his heart, he 
worships a game. 
</P>
<P>
The good-natured equipment manager quiets a rowdy locker room by declaring that 
back in the days of Lombardi "we didn't use steroids." Atta boy, that should do 
it. He cares, but not enough to do something drastic, such as turn in a player, 
arrange outside counseling . . . anything, but lecture people about the evils. 
</P>
<P>
The supposed intellectual of the group, Babs Winston, professes a drug-free 
body, but later changes his mind and pays the consequences. 
</P>
<P>
As for Murdock, he may be the only guy who truly understands the games within 
the game. "Live hard, die young," he says. "Never be outpharmacied," he warns. 
Players are victims of the Dixie Cup system, he says: "They use you up and 
throw you away." 
</P>
<P>
So Murdock turns to steroids (as Bollinger himself did while with the Rams) to 
survive. He pops pills. He revs his body up to the red zone to compete. 
Eventually, his body answers back. 
</P>
<P>
There are no heroes in this play, which is fitting because the number of role 
models in the real league seems to decrease daily. However, there are moments 
when you believe what Bollinger and Schalter have presented here is true, or 
could be. The in-fighting . . . the tension before a game . . . the daily 
dilemma a team doctor must face: serve the player or the employer . . . the 
ambition that probably takes place on plenty of coaching staffs . . . the 
loneliness. 
</P>
<P>
"We all have our Super Bowls," Murdock says, "and we'll do anything to get 
there." 
</P>
<P>
But is it worth it? As Bollinger and Schalter tell it, the answer is a 
resounding no.

BREA-OLINDA HANGS ON AT THE FREE-THROW LINE TO BEAT WESTERN, 55-46 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Brea-Olinda High School rallied from a 10-point halftime deficit and then held 
on for a 55-46 Orange League victory over Western Friday at Western. 
</P>
<P>
It took eight consecutive free throws by Aaron Charlton to save the victory and 
give Brea-Olinda (17-7, 6-2) sole possession of second place in the Orange 
League. 
</P>
<P>
"Charlton is a good player to have in there. He's a real clutch player," 
Brea-Olinda Coach Rick Jones said. "He always makes those free throws." 
</P>
<P>
Charlton was 10 of 10 from the free-throw line for 20 points overall. 
</P>
<P>
But it was Keith Walker who led the Wildcats' comeback, scoring eight points in 
the third quarter while Brea-Olinda was on a 19-5 run. 
</P>
<P>
"They got all the calls in the first half," Jones said. "I told them things 
would even out in the second. We came out and made the first five or six 
points, and that made the difference." 
</P>
<P>
The Wildcats scored the first five points of the quarter on a three-pointer by 
Charlton and a 10-foot jumper by Marc Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Chamberlain then converted a three-point play and Walker made a 
three-point shot before Rodney Stewart gave Brea-Olinda a 33-32 lead with 5:02 
left. Brea-Olinda built a four-point lead by the end of the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Sam Sabarra made five of six free throws in the fourth to pull Western within 
one point, 45-44, as Walker fouled out with 2:27 left. 
</P>
<P>
But then it was Charlton's turn, and he made eight free throws in the final 
2:22. 
</P>
<P>
Western (15-6, 5-3), hampered by poor shooting all night, managed only a layup 
by Matt Schroeder during the final minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Western, which shot 18 of 49 from the field, controlled the first half, 
building a 15-11 lead in the first quarter and adding to it with a 10-2 run in 
the second to reach the half leading, 30-20. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Romero led Western with 20 points, 14 in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim 51, Valencia 44 -- Jude Barbito scored 18 points to lead Anaheim (8-13, 
1-7) at Valencia. The score was tied, 8-8, at the end of the first quarter, but 
the Colonists outscored the Tigers, 12-6, to take a 20-14 halftime lead. Victor 
Zambrano scored 13 points and Greg Cole added 10 off the bench for Anaheim. 
Steve Dodd had 19 points and 16 rebounds for Valencia (4-13, 1-7). 
</P>
<P>
Savanna 59, Magnolia 42 -- The Rebels (21-2, 7-1) used a balanced attack to 
defeat host Magnolia. Mustapha Abdi and Aaron Calderon each scored 12 points 
for Savanna. Keith Rodriguez scored 11 and Eric Preuss 10 for the Rebels, who 
led, 31-15, at halftime. Jerry Jones scored 17 points for Magnolia (10-10, 
4-4).

RANCHO ALAMITOS STAYS IN RACE

<TEXT>
<P>
Rancho Alamitos High School got its best performance of the season when it 
needed it the most Friday night as the Vaqueros defeated Pacifica, 72-44, in a 
key Garden Grove League boys' basketball game at Rancho Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Alamitos (9-8, 7-4 in league play) moved to within striking range of 
third-place Pacifica (13-6, 8-3). La Quinta (15-5, 10-1) is first, one game 
ahead of Kennedy (16-7, 9-2) and two in front of Pacifica. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a must-win for us if we were going to have any chance of catching 
Pacifica or anyone else for third place," Rancho Alamitos Coach Terry Munson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Vaqueros led, 21-17, at the end of the first quarter and outscored the 
Mariners, 15-5, to take a 36-22 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Lira scored 24 points and David Green 20 to lead Rancho Alamitos. Green 
also had 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
The Vaqueros dominated the inside game as Richard Pearce had 17 rebounds and 11 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Alamitos played a box-and-one defense on Pacifica's Dustin Bonham, who 
came into the game averaging 19.9 points. Bonham was held to 6 points by Rancho 
Alamitos' Jim Yarnell. Bill Maurer scored 10 points to lead Pacifica. 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta 71, Los Amigos 51 -- Scott Campbell scored 26 points to lead host La 
Quinta (15-5, 10-1). Campbell, a 6-foot 5-inch senior, made 12 of 19 shots and 
had 10 rebounds. Scott Linck had 13 points and Bill Snyder 10 for the Aztecs. 
Snyder also had nine assists and Linck six. Carlos Palomino scored 18 points 
and David Pearlman 11 for Los Amigos (6-12, 4-7).

</P>
<P>
The Mustangs (16-5, 8-0) trailed, 16-10, at the end of the first quarter but

MCKNIGHT SAYS HE MIGHT SEEK FULLERTON JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gary McKnight, the phenomenally successful Mater Dei High School basketball 
coach, said Friday he plans to apply for the Cal State Fullerton job, provided 
Fullerton indicates he would be a contender. 
</P>
<P>
"I would be very interested, but I don't want to waste my time," said McKnight, 
a Cal State Fullerton graduate who has guided Mater Dei to a 190-17 record, 
five Southern Section championships and one state championship since becoming 
coach in 1982. "I'd be very interested to make a move like that." 
</P>
<P>
McKnight said he will talk with Fullerton Athletic Director Ed Carroll before 
making a decision. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton named assistant coach John Sneed as acting basketball coach for the 
season when George McQuarn resigned Nov. 3. Sneed has said since that day that 
he is a candidate for the job. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll announced last week that because of a school affirmative action policy 
Fullerton will not make a separate decision on Sneed, but will consider him 
along with the rest of the applicants. Carroll set a Feb. 24 deadline for 
applications, and said he would like to name a coach soon after the Big West 
Conference tournament, which concludes March 11. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Sneed, one other coach contacted by The Times said he has 
applied for the job -- Iowa assistant Rudy Washington, formerly an assistant at 
USC and head coach at Compton College and Verbum Dei High School. At Verbum 
Dei, he succeeded Sneed, who had replaced McQuarn. 
</P>
<P>
Washington also is the founder and executive director of the 2,000-member Black 
Coaches Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a great situation," Washington said. "It's home for me, and I'm 
working as hard as I can (to pursue the job)." 
</P>
<P>
A number of potential applicants -- including UCLA assistant coach Paul 
Landreaux and UC Riverside Coach John Masi -- apparently are waiting for an 
indication of their chances. 
</P>
<P>
"If (Fullerton) calls me and shows an interest, then I may look into it," 
Landreaux said. "I've been looking for a Division I job. If they're interested 
in me, I'm sure they'll contact me. If they contact me, I'll talk to them." 
</P>
<P>
Masi, whose Riverside team upset Iowa in December and is 17-2 and is ranked No. 
1 among Division II teams, said he has talked with Carroll and "probably will 
apply," although he, too, is awaiting an indication of Fullerton's interest. 
</P>
<P>
McKnight's only experience as a varsity head coach is at Mater Dei. He has been 
an assistant at Ocean View High School, an assistant at Saddleback College 
under Bill Mulligan, and coach of the freshman team at San Clemente High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
He has turned down offers to be an assistant in major college programs. 
</P>
<P>
"Being at Mater Dei is a unique situation; it's like being at a college," 
McKnight said. "I won't leave unless it's a really good situation. I wouldn't 
consider the Chapman (College) job (where Rich Prospero is interim coach). . . 
. But this is an opportunity to go Division I."

McKnight stressed his background in Orange County as a qualification for the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they need to recruit in Orange County, and get some financial backing 
in Orange County," McKnight said. "I've got it working here." 
</P>
<P>
McKnight's lack of major college coaching experience clearly would be his 
biggest disadvantage in seeking the job. 
</P>
<P>
"Ron Palmer at Long Beach State, (football coach) Gerry Faust at Notre Dame, 
they didn't make it," said McKnight, referring to men who jumped from high 
school jobs directly to Division I coaching jobs. Palmer's teams were 23-64 in 
three seasons at Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"But there are others that have," McKnight said.

PRIME COMPUTER, MAI STOCKS RISE ON RUMORS OF SWEETENED OFFERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID OLMOS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prime Computer's common stock has moved up in brisk trading this week, driven 
by rumors that MAI Basic Four or another suitor might be preparing to top MAI's 
original $970-million offer for the Natick, Mass., minicomputer maker. 
</P>
<P>
The increased activity by Wall Street traders by Friday had driven Prime's 
stock price to $20.75 a share -- slightly above the $20 per share offered Nov. 
15 by MAI in its hostile takeover bid. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, speculation that Prime might turn the tables on MAI has 
helped fuel a 45.8% gain in MAI's stock the past 2 days, analysts said Friday. 
MAI, a Tustin computer maker controlled by New York investor Bennett LeBow, is 
about one-third the size of Prime. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said two other companies rumored to have developed an interest in 
Prime are Ford Motor Co. and Sun Microsystems, a Silicon Valley computer maker. 
Cash-rich Ford is one of Prime's biggest customers. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Foote, a Ford spokesman, said the auto maker's policy is not to comment on 
rumors about possible acquisitions. A Sun Microsystems spokeswoman also 
declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
Prime's stock rose $1 per share Thursday and was up an additional 12.5 cents 
Friday to close at $20.75 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
"Yesterday, there was a rumor that there would be a higher bid" for Prime, said 
Jay Stevens, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds. "Today, the rumor is less 
strong. This is a critical time when you can make a lot of money on rumors." 
</P>
<P>
MAI's stock has soared 45.8% since it closed Wednesday at $7.37 1/2 a share. 
The company's stock closed Friday at $10.75 per share, up $1.75 for the day in 
Big Board trading. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed the rise in MAI's stock to rumors about a possible 
"Pac-Man" defense by Prime, in which the Massachusetts firm would fend off MAI 
by launching a bid to acquire the Tustin company. 
</P>
<P>
They said MAI's stock is also being helped by the company's favorable 
first-quarter operating earnings, which surprised some analysts when they were 
reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Tustin firm's earnings of $5.5 million for the quarter ended Dec. 
31 were down slightly from $5.6 million a year earlier, revenue was up 26% to 
$107.6 million from $85.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
And earnings from operations rose to $15.9 million for the quarter, up 48.6% 
from $10.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
Net income was affected by the ongoing costs of several recent acquisitions, 
MAI said. 
</P>
<P>
Several industry analysts said they had expected MAI to post much worse results 
because the mid-range computer market has been slumping in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"The earnings came in a lot better than anyone hoped," said Robert Johnson, an 
analyst with Rotan Mosle in Houston. "I was looking for 27 cents a share in 
earnings, and it came in at 36 cents." 
</P>
<P>
MAI Chairman William Patton attributed the stock's gain to the earnings report 
and said the company believes its stock has been undervalued for some time. He 
would not comment on rumors that Prime might be planning a counterattack. 
</P>
<P>
As of Jan. 30, 72.6% of Prime's common shares had been tendered to MAI. The 
offer is scheduled to expire Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, MAI said it had secured key financing commitments totaling 
more than $650 million from Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. and Canadian Imperial Bank 
of Commerce for the deal. 
</P>
<P>
As LeBow moves closer to capturing his prey, Johnson said, Prime may by 
stepping up its search for alternatives to the offer. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the takeover battle, analysts speculated that Prime might attempt the 
Pac-Man anti-takeover defense -- named after a popular video game of the early 
1980s in which characters that don't swallow their opponents are themselves 
devoured. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said he also has been hearing rumors from Wall Street traders about a 
possible bid for Prime by Ford or Sun Microsystems. 
</P>
<P>
"The Ford rumor makes sense because they have lots of cash, Ford is one of 
(Prime's) primary customers, and Ford is trying to get into new businesses," 
Johnson said. Sun Microsystems, which makes high-powered computer workstations, 
might be interested in Prime for its large international sales and service 
organizations, he said.

ALMANAC / SURVEY OF CLERICAL SALARIES: NORTH COUNTY WORKERS HAVE EDGE ON PAYDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Office workers in north Orange County generally are paid higher salaries than 
their counterparts in the south county, according to an annual survey by 
Irvine-based Thomas Temporaries. 
</P>
<P>
Among 15 state urban areas surveyed, north Orange County ranked second or third 
in beginning monthly salaries for three of nine job categories, and no lower 
than eighth in the other categories. 
</P>
<P>
South Orange County clerical salaries were in the middle range of state areas 
surveyed but also ranked no lower than eighth in any of the nine occupations. 
</P>
<P>
South county will see more clerical job growth than north county in 1989, the 
survey indicated. And 46% of the 96 south county businesses surveyed plan to 
hire additional office staff in the first 6 months of this year, the survey 
said, with word-processing typists, general clerks and accounting clerks in 
greatest demand. 
</P>
<P>
In north county, 32% of the 99 businesses surveyed plan staff increases, with 
the greatest demand for general clerks and word-processing typists.

PUC PROMISES PUBLIC ROLE IN SDG&amp;E REVIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A state Public Utilities Commission official promised Friday to hold "as many 
public participation hearings as possible" in San Diego during the agency's 
upcoming review of Southern California Edison's proposed merger with San Diego 
Gas &amp; Electric. 
</P>
<P>
PUC Administrative Law Judge Lynn Carew said copies of "testimony, exhibits and 
other documents" generated by the PUC review will be stored and available for 
public viewing at the downtown branch of the San Diego Public Library. 
</P>
<P>
During a lengthy pre-hearing session Friday in San Diego, Carew also ordered 
SDG&amp;E and Edison to describe the "nature and extent" of their business 
dealings since the merger was announced in November. Carew ordered utility 
lawyers to detail the role that Edison executives have played "in SDG&amp;E's 
daily operations and management decision-making." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Complaint by UCAN 
</P>
<P>
Carew's order followed a complaint by San Diego-based Utility Consumers Action 
Network that SDG&amp;E and Rosemead-based Edison have ignored state regulations 
that prohibit the transfer of proprietary information. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Malkin, SCE's Los Angeles-based attorney, argued that the "great deal" 
of information exchanged so far was "essential . . . to prepare for this (PUC) 
proceeding. . . . There is no 'de facto' control of SDG&amp;E by Edison." 
</P>
<P>
Carew on Friday also refused to adopt Edison's proposed hearing schedule. That 
"expedited" schedule suggested that the PUC's extensive review be completed by 
Dec. 27. Carew, who will dictate a schedule during an upcoming pre-hearing in 
San Diego, complained that Edison's proposed schedule left "little time" for 
her to write a decision that the full PUC would use to approve, amend or reject 
the proposed merger. 
</P>
<P>
Edison's "unusually ambitious" schedule was driven by the desire to complete 
the proposed merger before a March 31, 1990, "drop dead date" that was included 
in the merger agreement, Malkin said. 
</P>
<P>
Malkin also complained that a lengthier hearing schedule could jeopardize the 
merger "because there's more chance for some external event to take place that 
(would change) the value of the deal." 
</P>
<P>
However, Deputy City Atty. William Shaffran contended that the March 31, 1990, 
deadline "should have no effect whatsoever" on the PUC's review. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief speech during the session, Mayor Maureen O'Connor demanded that the 
PUC "level the playing field by strictly limiting and supervising the 
expenditures made by all parties in this takeover effort." O'Connor in recent 
weeks has attacked Edison as a free-spending company that expects to spend $16 
million to prove its case to the PUC. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor also asked the PUC for an "accounting" of discussions between 
regulators and utility executives involved in the merger. 
</P>
<P>
During the hearing, Carew refused to immediately institute "sunshine" rules 
that would severely restrict the lobbying of PUC officials. Instead, she 
ordered parties to the review to study proposed regulations that are expected 
to be adopted in 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
The PUC took the unusual step of bringing two "public advisers" to the meeting, 
largely because O'Connor had invited San Diegans to attend the meeting. The 
advisers counseled a handful of San Diegans on the complexities of the upcoming 
review. Pre-hearing sessions such as Friday's meeting in San Diego generally 
are attended only by attorneys, utility representatives and consumer group 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
The public advisers will return to San Diego on Thursday and Friday to conduct 
workshops that will explain the public's role in the decidedly complex review.

NEW DECORATIVE CENTER RUN BY 'EVANGELIST FOR GOOD TASTE' 
</P>

<P>
Having shed his sport coat, Gephard Durenberger stood in the middle of the 
exhibit room with his hands on his hips and a pleased-as-punch grin on his 
face. 
</P>
<P>
A truckload of 17th- and 18th-Century English and French antiques had just been 
unloaded at the new Center for the Study of Decorative Arts in San Juan 
Capistrano and volunteer Patricia Wheeler was asking center director 
Durenberger what he thought of placing a hanging cupboard in a corner of the 
room devoted to early English-country antiques and already filling with such 
treasures as a collection of 18th-Century pewter and porcelain. 
</P>
<P>
"Why not? I'd love it," Durenberger said with characteristic enthusiasm, moving 
into the next room where volunteer Suzanne Cecil was setting up an exhibit 
devoted to formal English drawing-room furniture. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is great," exclaimed Durenberger, grinning mischievously: "See 
what talent we have here? And these women all charge at least $100 an hour. And 
look at the quality! People in the East think we (Californians) all have Melmac 
and junk." 
</P>
<P>
The antiques for the exhibits that Wheeler and Cecil were helping to set up are 
on loan from 20 California collectors for the center's inaugural exhibition, 
"California Style: Collectors and Collections." The exhibition, which features 
two period room settings and five vignettes, opens Tuesday and will run through 
May 6. 
</P>
<P>
The choice of spotlighting California collections is a fitting one for the new 
study center, the first of its kind on the West Coast and one that is already 
being compared to Cooper-Hewitt, the nationally acclaimed decorative arts 
museum and school in New York. 
</P>
<P>
While Cooper-Hewitt is in an old private mansion, the Center for the Study of 
Decorative Arts is housed in a uniquely California setting: A compound of early 
California-style buildings that enclose a tree-shaded patio and fountain. 
</P>
<P>
The rough-hewn, homey atmosphere of the center is an ideal environment for the 
study of the decorative arts, a term which, as Durenberger explains, "is 
synonymous with 'home.' " 
</P>
<P>
"It's everything we deal with in our everyday life -- furniture, china, 
textiles, ceramics, silver -- including the house and the garden it sits in," 
he said. "And that's exactly what we're about at the study center: To offer 
study collections and lectures and classes whereby everyone -- and we mean 
everybody -- will have an opportunity to understand better the way we lived in 
the past and how we can apply those lessons to today and, hopefully, for our 
future generations." 
</P>
<P>
Located next to the architecturally acclaimed San Juan Capistrano Regional 
Library on Camino Capistrano, the nonprofit study center includes a fireside 
reading room and study loft stocked with books and magazines on the decorative 
arts. 
</P>
<P>
The center is the culmination of 5 years of cultural activities staged at the 
library by its parent organization, Libros y Artes, a cultural support group 
for which Durenberger, a longtime Capistrano antique dealer, serves as 
president. 
</P>
<P>
The study center is also a culmination of sorts for the 52-year-old 
Durenberger, a summation of both his professional and personal growth since 
arriving in Orange County from the Midwest in the late 1950s and landing a job 
as an apprentice with the respected antiquarian Carl Yeakel of Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Durenberger not only has deeded the quarter-acre study center property to the 
city -- the 4,000 square feet of exhibit space formerly housed his antique 
shop, which has been moved down the street -- but he has been a guiding light 
in San Juan Capistrano's growing emergence as a cosmopolitan cultural oasis. 
</P>
<P>
Since he joined a group of citizens protesting the proposed installation of a 
Kentucky Fried Chicken "bucket in the sky" in 1969, Durenberger has devoted a 
good portion of his time to civic activities. He served as founding president 
of San Juan Beautiful, president of the San Juan Capistrano Historical Society 
and the south county's representative on the Orange County Historical 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
But it is for the Durenberger Series, a series of study tours abroad and 
lectures on architecture and the decorative arts held at Folie Gep, the Gothic 
guest house on the grounds of his showcase Capistrano Beach home, that 
Durenberger sealed his reputation for being what one admirer described as an 
"evangelist for good taste." 
</P>
<P>
A vibrant personality with boundless energy and contagious enthusiasm, 
Durenberger is indeed a man of impeccable taste. But "Gep," as his legion of 
friends call him, remains as unpretentious as his Midwestern roots. He would 
just as soon be out digging weeds in his back yard or donning the pair of old 
corduroy pants and work shoes that he brought with him to the center to help 
set up the exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
Described by a magazine writer several years ago as having almost 
"movie-star-ish good looks," the tall, dark-haired Durenberger has a playful, 
frequently self-deprecating sense of humor. That is evident when, asked his 
age, he had to think twice and then good-naturedly added: "I'm an aging, 
balding, middle-aged gent." 
</P>
<P>
Art Birtcher, a general partner of Birtcher, the Laguna Niguel-based real 
estate development company who is serving on the center's board of trustees, 
views the Center for the Study of Decorative Arts as something that will become 
"a very important portion of the social fabric of not only Orange County but 
entire Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
A longtime friend of Durenberger's, Birtcher added: "Gep has brought the 
enthusiasm and the concept, with the city, into being and will be the heartbeat 
of the center's future." 
</P>
<P>
San Juan Capistrano City Manager Stephen B. Julian, who has worked with 
Durenberger on plans for the center, agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"It's interesting," he said. "If I had to say something about Gep and where 
this thing is going, I'd have to say that in Japan they treat artists and 
(creative) people as sort of national treasures. In that sense, Mr. Durenberger 
is one of our treasures." 
</P>
<P>
As for Durenberger, he commends the city for having had the foresight to 
initiate the idea of Libros y Artes. 
</P>
<P>
"But neither the city nor I could have foreseen it would blossom into a proper 
study center and museum," he said. "And I think the city fathers were 
pleasantly surprised not only by the (support of the) design community but the 
general public. It's that mix of the design community, the city fathers and the 
general public that made it sing." 
</P>
<P>
And now that the Center for the Study of Decorative Arts has become a reality, 
Durenberger himself is downright lyrical. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm over the moon!" he exclaimed, standing amid the pre-opening confusion and 
clutter. With a grin, he added: "If I weren't so tired, I'd really be enjoying 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Durenberger's Capistrano Beach home has been featured in Town and Country 
magazine, the World of Interiors, House and Garden (twice) and, in April, it 
will appear on the cover of House Beautiful. In fact, his home has appeared in 
so many magazines and newspapers that Durenberger wryly remarks, "I feel like a 
public stripper." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his impressively appointed surroundings, Durenberger describes his home 
as "humble" and insists that he is not a man "of means." "No, I'm not," he 
says, "it's a sham, and an illusion." 
</P>
<P>
A most impressive illusion, however. 
</P>
<P>
And what better place to discuss the decorative arts with Gep Durenberger than 
in his own home. 
</P>
<P>
There are two ways to enter Durenberger's domain. One is through the small, 
single-story, Mediterranean-style main house. The other is through the more 
imposing, 2-story 18th-Century Gothic Revival guest house, Folie Gep, which 
Durenberger built on the back of his half-acre property in 1981 to conduct his 
decorative arts lecture series. (Folie, Durenberger explains, is a French word 
for a building that was not built as a residence but for entertaining, or as a 
place to rest while hunting.) 
</P>
<P>
The street-side front door of the folie sets the tone for the building, which 
incorporates architectural elements brought back from buying trips to France 
and England: A 6-inch-thick Gothic Revival wooden door from England, complete 
with original hinges, handles and door frame. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the large foyer, visitors first encounter a sedan chair from the English 
Regency period. Directly ahead is a stairway leading to three bedrooms and a 
bath; to the left of the stairs, through a pair of 18th-Century French wooden 
doors, is the antique-filled main room. 
</P>
<P>
Durenberger calls it "the schoolroom." 
</P>
<P>
It's here where a host of guest lecturers such as Desmond Guinness, chairman of 
the Irish Georgian Society, and Edward Saunders of the National Trust of Great 
Britain have discoursed on period architecture and the decorative arts. 
</P>
<P>
Viewed from above, "the schoolroom" portion of the folie resembles a cross. The 
room is a 16-foot-square cube topped by a pyramid-shaped roof 27 feet above and 
framed on the sides by four half-cubes. Below the pyramid are Gothic clerestory 
windows; the gray plaster walls are scored and painted to simulate cut stone. 
</P>
<P>
Guests who have stayed in the folie over the years include everyone from New 
York fashion designer Bill Blass and Lady (Slim) Keith to Gillian Wilson, 
curator of decorative arts at the Getty Museum, and William Rieder, curator of 
decorative arts of the Metropolitan Museum of Art -- and any number of 
Durenberger's 19 godchildren. "I'm never without people," he says. "It's a dull 
home when it's an empty home." 
</P>
<P>
For the study center's opening gala tonight, Durenberger's home has been 
filling up all week with assorted family and friends, including his sister, 
Rita Dobbins of New York, interior designer John Saladino (a former college 
classmate), and Stanley Barrows, dean emeritus of the Parsons School of Design 
in New York. Barrows will stay over to deliver a lecture next Saturday on 
"California Style: Origins and Antecedants," the first in the study center's 
"Collectors and Collections" lecture series. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing a white monogrammed shirt with rolled-up sleeves, slacks and tasseled 
loafers with argyle socks, Durenberger led his visitors out the glazed French 
doors of the folie and into the garden: a wonderfully blended conglomeration of 
trees (pine, pepper and a Hawaiian "shower tree"), hedges, shrubs, grass, 
gravel pathways and two arbors. A glassed-in "garden shed," where Durenberger 
often serves lunch to guests, overlooks a small, rectangular swimming pool with 
a statue of St. Fiacre, the patron saint of gardeners, at one end. ("I found 
him in England and I'm just mad about him.") 
</P>
<P>
While Durenberger has incorporated many ideas gleaned from visits to the great 
gardens of England and Europe, the overall feeling of his home and grounds is a 
combination of Mediterranean and early California. Adding to that feeling is 
the fact that the living room, dining room and his bedroom all have doors that 
open onto the garden, and the doors are usually left wide open. Past visitors 
have described Durenberger's airy home and garden variously as having an "Old 
World ambiance" and being a "romantic, insolated world." 
</P>
<P>
Its origins are more prosaic. 
</P>
<P>
The two-bedroom main house is a former beach cottage, one of six built in the 
late '20s, along with a beach club and a mansion for Los Angeles oil 
millionaire Edward L. Doheny Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Durenberger bought the small house, which had been badly neglected, in 1971 for 
$30,000. "And I was really stretching to buy it," he said. Being raised in the 
Midwest, where Mediterranean architecture is unknown, he said, "I just knew 
that was the house I wanted. It was such a natural response I felt toward this 
architecture in this climate." 
</P>
<P>
Before moving in, Durenberger spent a year making repairs, knocking out walls 
and adding personal touches: He resurfaced the walls in the living room and his 
bedroom in the style of a Mediterranean cottage: unpainted plaster with straw 
in it. He also installed Cotswold cottage windows -- "It's so much more fun 
looking out a window with great character" -- painted the plank floor in the 
living room to resemble parquet and installed Mexican pavers in the dining 
room. 
</P>
<P>
An outdoor courtyard was converted into a glass-domed atrium ("It's wonderful 
for having dinner in on a rainy night"), and the exterior of the house has a 
Mediterranean, peeled-paint look. Durenberger relishes telling the story of the 
time he was weeding out front and a neighbor, not knowing she was talking to 
the owner, clucked: "It's such a shame. They've worked so hard and it looks so 
shabby." 
</P>
<P>
"It is," Durenberger concedes with a grin, "very much an eccentric house." 
</P>
<P>
The Mediterranean style of the architecture lends itself to the collection of 
17th- and 18th-Century English and French antiques Durenberger has amassed over 
the years. Indeed, except for the refrigerator and stove in the kitchen, there 
is little that is 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I find that furniture that's already been used by someone else has a 
lot more character and soul and I rather enjoy that association," Durenberger 
said, seated on a 17th-Century French wing chair in the living room. "And since 
I love history, these things are more than just sentimental attachments. I love 
to consider their historical association and how that's being recycled in the 
20th Century. It is nice, really, sitting in a chair that gave pleasure 300 
years ago and served all those generations." 
</P>
<P>
The overall effect of his house is tasteful yet unpretentious -- not unlike the 
owner himself. 
</P>
<P>
But it hasn't come without great effort. That, he believes, more than how much 
money someone has to spend on turning a house into a home, is what really 
counts. 
</P>
<P>
"We all know people born with great taste and love for their environment (who) 
didn't have great means. You're talking to one," he said. "To have a bit of 
money, of course, is a great advantage, no doubt about it. But I don't think 
one is limited because of a lack of money from having a beautiful environment. 
I've known so many people with very limited incomes who have lived in the most 
attractive homes. They might do their own muslin curtains, but the results are 
sensational. 
</P>
<P>
"What I've put together has been done with a minimal amount of money and a 
maximum amount of loving energy. And I think that's why people love to come to 
my home. When one equates the value of their home with financial value, then we 
are really running into trouble. I don't think that was as often the case in 
the past when people rooted and stayed there for generations." 
</P>
<P>
Durenberger laments the fact that in today's upwardly mobile society, a home is 
considered as disposable as an automobile. "It's hard to establish a sense of 
home when you're moving every 2 years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Durenberger comes by his appreciation of antiques and the decorative arts via 
his childhood, growing up in LeSueur, Minn. His childhood home was an 1859 
brick house filled with 19th-Century antiques. 
</P>
<P>
"We were the only people in town that didn't have wall-to-wall carpeting," he 
said. "My father was in bulk oil, but he had this great sensitivity for the 
decorative arts. He was following the lead of my mother, who had amazing 
taste." 
</P>
<P>
A Notre Dame liberal arts graduate, Durenberger moved to California in 1958. An 
uncle, who was an executive for J.C. Penney, had arranged for him to enter a 
junior management training program in the Santa Ana store. He quit after a 
year. By then he had met antiquarian Carl Yeakel, who hired him as an 
apprentice in his Laguna Beach shop. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a first-class dealer and to be trained by him was a rare treat," 
Durenberger said. "As I befriended Mr. Yeakel, he gave me a lot of important 
advice, the most important being to pursue a career that I truly love. And it 
was apparent this is what I enjoy the most and do the best." 
</P>
<P>
In 1967, Durenberger struck out on his own. With savings and money borrowed 
from his parents, he bought an old bungalow that had once been part of a 
defunct hot springs colony off Ortega Highway for $18,000 and established his 
San Juan Capistrano antique shop. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, he said, "no one had ever had a shop down here, but I felt 
strongly about the community. It's where I wanted to live. It was very 
agricultural and with my Minnesota background, I felt strongly about that. This 
community had a definite flavor and character. It had old houses and new 
houses, rich and poor living side by side; it had that homogeneous quality that 
is sometimes difficult to find in other communities." 
</P>
<P>
As his reputation as an antiquarian grew, so did his shop. "Every time I 
scraped together a few thousand dollars I didn't need for merchandise, I added 
a room," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But by the mid-'70s, having turned 40, Durenberger underwent what he amusingly 
refers to as a mid-life crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"It was certainly not full of angst," he said. "It was just a period of 
re-evaluation, which I think people have to go through. What I had set out to 
do was done. I had not given myself sufficient goals that would sustain me for 
a lifetime and I was looking for a new challenge." 
</P>
<P>
A turning point came in 1977 when he was accepted for a study course at the 
Center for the Study of Fine and Decorative Arts based at the Victoria and 
Albert Museum in London. 
</P>
<P>
"I just realized how much I didn't know" about the decorative arts, he said. 
"Equally important, I found all these bits and pieces I did know came 
together." He said he learned how to put his knowledge of furniture, porcelain 
and other decorative arts into historical perspective, to understand why, for 
example, Gothic novels were being written at the same time that Gothic Revival 
houses were being built. 
</P>
<P>
With the enthusiasm of his many English friends, Durenberger said, he conceived 
the idea of starting a lecture program on the decorative arts in California. To 
that end, he built the folie "and off we went. That was in 1981 and there's 
been no looking back." 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, city officials asked him to head the new cultural support group Libros 
y Artes. Commissioned to bring to the community a wide range of cultural 
experiences, Libros y Artes offered films, lectures, seminars and musical 
events at the library. And every time they offered a lecture on the decorative 
arts, Durenberger noted, "we got a barn-burner response." 
</P>
<P>
"When you consider the amount of shelter magazines and home tours and the great 
interest the general public has in their environment, it's not such a shock," 
he said. "We just all want to learn how to live graciously and in order to do 
that, you have to have knowledge. It's just that simple. Creating a home is an 
art. There's no doubt about it." 
</P>
<P>
When Melville Martin of Palos Verdes bequeathed his first-class collection of 
18th-Century English and Irish antiques to Libros y Artes, the prospect of one 
day having to house the collection spurred the organization to establish an 
independent facility. 
</P>
<P>
The resulting study center, Durenberger said, "married the Libros y Artes and 
Durenberger Series under one umbrella." 
</P>
<P>
Although Libros y Artes receives an annual $10,000 grant from the city, the 
center is funded primarily by private donations and membership fees. Until the 
center receives the Martin collection and other donated items, Durenberger said 
it will depend entirely on loans from private collections for its exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
But like gardeners who love to share their planting tips or clippings, 
Durenberger said, "people in decorative arts tend to be generous in spirit. I 
think all of us who have been exposed to beautiful things and have been 
privileged to live with them like to share that joy with other people." 
</P>
<P>
With the establishment of the Center for the Study of Decorative Arts, 
Durenberger said, "I hope we're going to be able to open all sorts of new 
avenues for people so they can enjoy their home more and understand it better 
and provide a better environment for themselves and their friends." 
</P>
<P>
His own home would serve as an ideal case study. 
</P>
<P>
"I think when people come into my very humble house and see nice things, I 
think it encourages them (and conveys the idea) that living with beautiful 
things is not out of the reach of the ordinary household income. And that's 
what we're really about at the center. Education is the message.

FAMILY LIFE: ADOPTEES HELP EACH OTHER OUT

Half a dozen strangers sat nervously in a circle of chairs Wednesday as the 
support group meeting got under way. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's go around the room and introduce ourselves," said Charice Leabo, the 
group leader, nodding toward the young woman on her left. 
</P>
<P>
"My name is Alison," she began, "And I'm an adoptee." 
</P>
<P>
Then she laughed. "This is weird. I feel like I'm at an AA meeting or 
something." Everyone else laughed too, and the ice was instantly broken. 
</P>
<P>
The group was Adoptee Awareness, a support organization started by Leabo, 19, 
of Tustin, an adoptee whose birth mother contacted her in August, 1988. 
Wednesday's meeting was the group's first. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to be able to sit down and talk to someone who says, 'I 
understand,' and you know they really do understand," Leabo said. "My best 
friend is a good listener and I talk to her a lot, but she's not adopted and 
she can't really know what it's like." 
</P>
<P>
Leabo was "found," in the parlance of adoption, while some in the group are 
"searching." They don't know who their birth parents are, but they are trying 
to find out. Others aren't sure they want to know. As one young man put it, 
"I'm just lost." 
</P>
<P>
"I was adopted at 3 months," Leabo said. "A lot of times I felt I wasn't part 
of the family. I knew that I wasn't blood, that I didn't look like anybody. It 
was difficult for me to accept who I was. 
</P>
<P>
"I was angry at the world, and angry at my birth mother. Then I realized she 
was really unselfish. She was unmarried, by herself, didn't have any money. If 
she had kept me, she wouldn't have been able to take care of me." 
</P>
<P>
After she got over the anger, Leabo says, she didn't search because "I was so 
scared of hurting my adoptive mom. My (adoptive) father died when I was 13, and 
after that it was just the two of us. Then 6 years to the day after my father 
died, my phone rang, and it was Ilene (Wood). I got so excited I couldn't 
breathe. 
</P>
<P>
"The minute I saw her I felt so complete. I saw where I came from. It was like 
looking in the mirror." Leabo now lives with Wood, and she says her adoptive 
mother, who has moved to Missouri, accepts the situation and no longer feels 
threatened.

Alison Hicks, 24, of Anaheim only recently began her search. "All my life I 
knew I was an adoptee. But I was curious; I wanted to know what my mother looks 
like," she said. "My parents have always been very supportive, but they said, 
'If you're going to do it, we'd rather you wait until you're out on your own. 
So I decided about 2 months ago that I would start." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not looking for a new family," she said. "I'm just curious." On the advice 
of a search consultant from Concerned United Birthparents (CUB), a separate 
support group, Hicks filed papers requesting information from the Orange County 
adoption agency that placed her. She has an appointment next week to meet with 
an agency worker and get whatever information is available. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like the first part of my life was never explained to me," said Chuck 
Whitmore, 21, of Temple City, who spent more than 3 years searching for his 
birth parents. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to the hospital where I was born, to the agency in L.A. that placed me. 
I even went to the closest church to the hospital and looked through their 
baptismal records. I got so depressed when I could find nothing at all. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to know what they looked like. I wasn't sure I wanted to know 
more. I remember when I was 16 and I realized that my girlfriend looked like 
her brother and her dad. I thought that was neat, and I wondered if there was 
somebody out there I looked like." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
That's a common feeling among adoptees. "You see people who do look like you," 
Leabo said. "I remember before Ilene found me, wherever I went, to the beach, 
to Disneyland, to a restaurant, I would see people and wonder, 'Could that be 
them?' " 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Whitmore learned from the agency that his mother had given him up 
because "she thought it was more important for me to have a two-parent home." 
After that, he said, "I went from just wanting to see a picture to wanting to 
meet this lady. 
</P>
<P>
"She loved me enough to give me up. That's a very strong love, I think. And 
it's kind of sad that we had to be apart. I'm glad I found her," he said. His 
birth mother, who lives in Orange County, still has not told her own parents 
about her unwed pregnancy, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Whitmore's 19-year-old brother, Randy, also adopted, says he isn't sure how 
much he wants to know about his own birth parents. He didn't even know about 
Chuck's search until the rest of the family was told, 9 months after Chuck and 
his birth mother first met in 1987 at a hotel near Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got the greatest parents," Chuck said. "I didn't want them to feel I was 
leaving them." 
</P>
<P>
With the help of CUB, Chuck found his birth mother 19 months ago. "I wrote a 
letter to her, and then we got together. We see each other pretty often now. 
She came to one of my (motorcycle) races 2 weeks ago, and she got to see more 
of my real personality -- you know, how I act with my friends, instead of just 
some guy sitting around with his mother." 
</P>
<P>
His adoptive parents also met her at their request, and Chuck says that went 
well, although they don't have regular contact. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck said he and his birth mother "get along pretty good. There are a lot of 
similarities between us. We both drive fast; she drives faster than I do. I 
keep my room neat, and her house is absolutely spotless. We're like each other 
a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Chuck also got his birth father's name, address and phone number. He wrote a 
letter last year but got no response. "I'd like to meet him," he said. "But I 
don't want to push." 
</P>
<P>
"Being adopted has not made me a happy person," said Dave Ehlen, 26, of 
Anaheim. "I mean, I have a good family, but there's something missing, and I'm 
going to find it." 
</P>
<P>
After a series of frustrating phone calls to the adoption agency in San 
Antonio, Tex., his birthplace, Ehlen bought a ticket and flew there to do his 
own research. "But I walked away empty-handed," he said. "They wouldn't tell me 
anything. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to hurt these people (his birth parents)," Ehlen said. "Suppose 
she got married and had other kids and never told anyone about me? I'm not 
going to go up to her and say, 'Ta-dah!' I'd just let it go if I knew darn well 
that she didn't want to see me. But I don't know that. It's so frustrating, 
especially when (adoption agency workers) are sitting there with the files 
right behind them. 
</P>
<P>
"This woman's got to be thinking about me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been wanting to look since I was in the sixth grade," said Nancy Saar, 
21, of La Canada. "But my (adoptive) mom's scared I won't want her anymore." 
Saar said she has a physical description of her birth parents and some 
information on their backgrounds. "I think I look like my mom," she said. "I'm 
the same height as my mother was, and we both have brown hair. She loves 
horses, and so do I. I think we are probably pretty alike, and I want to pursue 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"My mom could have had an abortion, and then I couldn't have been here at all. 
I'm glad she didn't. But I want to know why she gave me up." 
</P>
<P>
Saar wasn't sure where to begin her search, however, so she came to Adoptee 
Awareness not only to share feelings, but for practical advice. 
</P>
<P>
But not all adoptees want contact with their birth parents, Leabo pointed out. 
"I got a call from a birth mother who found her daughter 2 years ago, and she 
won't have anything to do with her. She asked me to send her daughter a flyer 
for this meeting, and I did. She called me, and she was so angry, she said, 'I 
just don't understand why she won't leave me alone.' 
</P>
<P>
"I told her that it was up to her, but if she ever wanted to talk about it -- 
or about anything -- she could call me. She said she'd keep my number. I guess 
that's a start." 
</P>
<P>
Adoptee Awareness meetings are scheduled to be held the first Wednesday of 
every month at 7 p.m., at St. Paul's Episcopal Church, 1221 Wass St., Tustin.

There are a number of Orange County businesses that sell firewood in quantity. 
For some, selling wood is the main order of business; for others, including 
some tree services, it is a sideline. Don Sayles, owner of one of the county's 
largest firewood sellers, Woodshed Firewood in Orange, has some tips for 
buyers: Make sure the wood is already seasoned, a process that takes months. 
Ask the seller exactly how much wood is in a cord; some businesses, Sayles 
said, sell less than the standard 128 cubic feet (a stack of wood 4 feet by 4 
feet by 8 feet). 
</P>
<P>
Softwoods, he said, light easier than hardwoods but do not burn as long; Sayles 
recommends getting a mixture, with softwoods for starting the fire and 
hardwoods for sustaining it. Below is a sampling of county firewood sellers and 
their prices for a cord of different types of wood. Prices shown do not include 
delivery unless otherwise noted, although all the businesses listed do offer 
delivery. Quantities less than a cord are available, although some sellers have 
a minimum amount for delivery. Because of fluctuations in supply, prices are 
subject to change.

ON THE WATERFRONT: OCC'S MARINE PROGRAM HOISTS MORE SAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEARLEAN DUKE, Shearlean Duke is a regular contributor to Orange County 
Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most boaters dream of sailing the Virgin Islands, a yachting paradise. But 
recently two Virgin Island sailors came to Orange County -- and stayed for a 
year -- just to go sailing. 
</P>
<P>
What drew them was Orange Coast College's marine program, one of the most 
comprehensive collections of nautical courses, lectures and seminars in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Each year 3,000 students sign up for one of OCC's marine studies programs, 
which range from beginning sailing in Lido 14s to ocean passages on the 
65-foot, college-owned Alaska Eagle. 
</P>
<P>
The program, which began as a smattering of classes offered in the mid-'70s, 
now consists of hundreds of courses, including an unusual offering called 
"Ocean Passages" that takes advanced sailing students on a 2,225-mile sail to 
Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Early classes were under the direction of Dave Grant, who served as dean of 
students from 1975 to 1985 and administered the marine program part time. But 
by 1985 the program had grown so large and become so popular that Grant was 
appointed full-time marine programs director. By 1983, he had been joined by 
Brad Avery, a part-time sailing instructor who became full-time director of the 
OCC sailing program. 
</P>
<P>
This month the marine program will expand even more as the college completes 
construction of a 3,000-square-foot second-floor addition to the waterfront 
sailing base in Newport Beach. The new $400,000 facility will allow the college 
to offer a wider variety of marine-related courses and seminars, according to 
Avery. 
</P>
<P>
Before construction of the addition, "some classes were held on campus and some 
were held here at the sailing base." Avery says. "But the base has no real 
classroom (just a cavernous rowing center) and no heating. We had great boat 
docks, a fleet of boats, good storage, and we had this tremendous waterfront 
site, but no classrooms." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, campus classrooms were becoming increasingly hard to come by, 
Avery says. "We'd try to reserve classrooms for particular nights and there 
wouldn't be any available." 
</P>
<P>
So, 4 years ago the college began a fund-raising campaign to expand the base. 
"What is exciting about this," Grant says, "is that it was all done by private 
funds. This is the only community college in Orange County" to finance new 
classrooms with private money. 
</P>
<P>
The impetuous for the campaign was a $150,000 matching grant from the Harry and 
Grace Steele Foundation. The addition is being christened the Steele Sailing 
Loft in recognition of the donation. 
</P>
<P>
"Before the Steele Foundation grant we were running on a dream," Avery says. 
"We're not a yacht club. We don't have a lot of money. Most of our donations 
came from students who gave us $25, $50 or $100. This expansion gives our 
destiny back to us. It centralizes the entire program. And from the standpoint 
of instructors, we can attract better instructors because we have a better 
facility." 
</P>
<P>
Among the new courses being offered this spring are "Introduction to Naval 
Architecture," "Marine Electronics" and "How to Buy a Boat." Some of the other 
classes that were previously held on campus will now be at the center. They 
include "Celestial Navigation" and "Coastal Navigation." 
</P>
<P>
"Other new programs we've added include seminars," Avery says. "We can now 
offer seminars for 100 people." 
</P>
<P>
The first seminar will be held Saturday and Sunday, Feb. 18 and 19, and will 
feature popular lecturers John Neal and Barbara Marrett, a cruising couple from 
Friday Harbor, Wash., who have spent 10 years sailing more than 100,000 miles 
to such places as Pitcairn Island, the Galapagos, Easter Island, the Tuamotus, 
the Marquesas, Tahiti and Samoa. 
</P>
<P>
In March a seminar on cruising the Channel Islands will be offered by Mike 
Pyzel, an expert on the nearby islands. Pyzel is a veteran of more than 400 
Channel Island cruises and is a former Coast Guard search and rescue officer. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the classroom programs, the college will continue to offer its 
beginning, intermediate and advanced sailing classes. More than 50 such courses 
are planned for this spring and are taught in the college fleet which includes 
five 30-foot Shields and 12 Lido 14s. 
</P>
<P>
The college's big boat fleet includes Marda, a 50-foot powerboat, Saudade, a 
47-foot sailboat and Alaska Eagle, a 65-foot sailboat that has become the 
program's best-known vessel. 
</P>
<P>
Last September, Alaska Eagle completed its fourth Pacific cruise, which took it 
8,000 miles from Orange County to Hawaii, Alaska, Canada and back in 104 days. 
Along the way a total of 54 students sailed aboard Alaska Eagle during the six 
legs of the cruise. Nine students and two instructors were on board during each 
leg. 
</P>
<P>
After departing Newport Beach on June 11, the boat sailed to Hawaii on the 
first leg. Students on the second leg cruised around all the Hawaiian Islands. 
Students on the third leg boarded in Oahu and sailed almost 3,000 miles to 
Glacier Bay, Alaska. Students on the fourth and fifth legs cruised through 
Alaska and Canada. Students on the sixth leg brought Alaska Eagle home from 
Vancouver, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the students on the cruise started out in the OCC sailing program in 
Lido 14s and worked their way up, Avery says. "They'd start in the Lidos and 
say, 'What do I have to do to sail on Alaska Eagle?' " 
</P>
<P>
The Alaska Eagle program is the college's most unusual course, Avery says, and 
is designed to give sailors additional offshore skills in navigation, piloting, 
sail handling, steering, provisioning, maintenance and safety. For most 
students, it is their first major cruise, he says. 
</P>
<P>
The boat is Coast Guard-licensed with a route to Hawaii and Alaska. However, 
this year's "Ocean Passages" course will go only to Hawaii. "It is hard to do 
the Alaska portion," Avery says, "so we're not offering it this year, but we 
will probably do it again in the future." 
</P>
<P>
Alaska Eagle will depart Newport Beach for Hawaii on June 10. Students 
interested in the program are advised to apply now. Anyone 16 or older who is 
physically fit with at least intermediate-level sailing experience is 
encouraged to apply, Avery says. Applicants are selected on the basis of 
sailing ability, physical ability, skills and "willingness to participate fully 
in all aspects of shipboard life." 
</P>
<P>
For students who can't participate in the Hawaii cruise, the college will also 
offer day and overnight courses covering offshore sail training during cruises 
to Santa Catalina and the Channel Islands. 
</P>
<P>
Other "big boat" classes are offered in Saudade and include local offshore 
sailing. "Introduction to Big Boats" covers the basics of handling yachts 30 to 
50 feet in length. Reefing, sail changing and gear handling are covered in the 
class. "Ocean Sailing," also taught aboard Saudade, covers sail selection and 
sailing techniques for light and heavy weather.

PHOTOGRAPHY: AERIAL VIEWS OF NORTHWEST AVAILABLE FROM SPACESHOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Q I was very interested in the article on Spaceshots Inc. aerial photos(Jan. 
21). I have seen similar and more spectacular photos in the Northwest of 
Portland/Mt. St. Helens and Vancouver/Victoria. I wonder if Spaceshots Inc. 
also markets those photos? What is the full line of pictures available and 
where can I find them? 
</P>
<P>
WILLIAM SCHACKLEFORD 
</P>
<P>
Seal Beach 
</P>
<P>
A The column on Spaceshots Inc. generated a lot of response. There is something 
about spotting the location of your home or a favorite landmark or your route 
to work on the freeway that generates interest. 
</P>
<P>
The photographs of the Northwest were produced by Advanced Satellite 
Productions, based in Vancouver, Canada. Spaceshots Inc. does sell its 
photographs through a joint agreement. Other areas for which such shots are 
available include Seattle, the Chesapeake Bay, Portland, Ore., Mt. St. Helens, 
Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver and Reno. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, the only locations produced by Spaceshots Inc. are San Diego, Los 
Angeles (which includes parts of Orange and Riverside counties), Boston and 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Here is a partial list of retail outlets for Spaceshots Inc.: Clines Hallmark 
at South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa, A-1 Stationery in Huntington Beach, Laguna 
Books in Laguna Beach, International Aviation at John Wayne Airport, Deck the 
Wall at Brea Mall and Corner Drug in Seal Beach. Spaceshots Inc. is based in 
Seal Beach but has a phone number in the Los Angeles directory. For more 
information you can call (800) 272-2779.

Q I am a serious amateur photographer and recently bought a Leica R6 camera. My 
biggest problem is mastering the technical side. I have encountered a problem 
that no one seems to have an answer for. 
</P>
<P>
I take photos to have them printed, framed, shared and enjoyed. However, the 
4-by-6-inch prints made from my 35-millimeter slides invariably return cropped 
on both the side and bottom, never full frame. These, of course, are 
machine-processed prints. I have talked to the high-volume developing labs and 
they have no solution. Other camera labs that do hand processing are very 
expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Is there any way to get 4-by-6 or 5-by-7-inch prints from slides that are full 
frame at a reasonable cost? 
</P>
<P>
MARIAN JONES 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar 
</P>
<P>
A Sorry, but you're out of luck. Unfortunately the frame of a 35-mm. slide does 
not have the same proportions as a 4-by-6 or 5-by-7-inch print. You must use 
the more expensive custom services to have your prints made full frame. 
</P>
<P>
The high-volume photo developing stores use machines that give you a print in a 
short amount of time but with a minimum of flexibility. This is done to keep 
the price low for consumers. 
</P>
<P>
To get the high quality printing, or printing that does not fit a standard 
shape, you have to go to a custom lab and this can be expensive because the 
picture is printed by hand rather than machine. You also have to factor in the 
time that is spent cropping and adjusting the print. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps you can get around this by not cropping or framing your picture so 
tightly. However, there is still some risk in that you have no idea which side 
of the picture the machine will crop off.

ASK THE JUDGE: CLEARING GHOSTS OF CREDIT PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDGE B. TAM NOMOTO, B. Tam Nomoto, an Orange County Municipal Court judge, 
answers readers' questions about the law. Ask the Judge runs every other 
Saturday in Orange County Life.

<P>
Q. For several years, as the sole support of my children, my income was not 
enough to meet our needs, resulting in late payments to creditors. I never 
defaulted on anything -- never had anything repossessed and now, what is not 
paid off entirely is at least current. 
</P>
<P>
My income has more than doubled in the last five years, and all I want is a 
credit card so that I can write checks without a hassle -- and I can't get one. 
How long will I have to pay for a previously poor credit history? 
</P>
<P>
J.L. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin 
</P>
<P>
A. Both the federal government and California regulate consumer credit 
reporting agencies. It is a little unclear from your letter, but it appears 
that your poor credit rating is due to late payments which resulted in 
collection. If this is the case, those delinquent accounts will appear on your 
credit report for seven years either under the federal or the California law. 
If your late payments caused your creditors to sue you and/or obtain a judgment 
against you, these facts would appear on your credit report for 7 years or for 
the period that a lawsuit could be filed against you, which ever is longer, 
under both laws. 
</P>
<P>
As you know, the ultimate decision as to whether you will obtain a credit card 
is with the institution issuing it. You might contact the one whose credit card 
you desire and find out what would you would have to do to qualify. 
</P>
<P>
Q. My husband and I separated in February of 1986. He filed for divorce but it 
isn't final yet. My husband has still not filed a 1985 tax return. I have filed 
a single return for every year after 1985 but I understand that I am still 
liable for the 1985 tax return as much as he. I wasn't working during 1985 and 
I don't have his records or information to file an accurate single return. 
</P>
<P>
I paid a $1,000 security deposit to the owners of the condo I am renting. They 
placed the deposit into an interest-bearing account in their names but with my 
Social Security number as tax ID. Can the IRS take that money? 
</P>
<P>
M.J. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin 
</P>
<P>
A. Yes, the IRS could attach the $1,000 since your are still being identified 
as having an interest in it through the use of your tax ID. 
</P>
<P>
You should really attempt to protect yourself from any further liability for 
his 1985 tax return. I would suggest that you contact the IRS Taxpayer Service 
which could assist you in the preparation of a "married but filing as a 
separate person" tax return. The Taxpayer Service phone number is toll free: 
1-800-642-1040. Good luck!

BOOKS &amp; AUTHORS: BOOK PACKAGER LOOKS FOR WRITERS, ARTISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carnival Enterprises, one of the largest book packagers in the nation, is 
looking for talented Orange County free-lance writers, illustrators and art 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm always looking for talent I can tap to help us develop projects," said 
Gregory Lee, director of the Minneapolis-based firm's California office in 
Laguna Hills. "Carnival is a low-key company that has a nationwide publishing 
business, so we consume a lot of free-lance talent." 
</P>
<P>
And what exactly does a book packager do? 
</P>
<P>
"We do everything a publisher does except sales and marketing," Lee said. "We 
create the books from scratch and very often deliver the final printed books to 
the publisher." 
</P>
<P>
Carnival, which produces more than 100 books a year for such diverse clients as 
Simon &amp; Schuster Inc. and Hasbro Toys, specializes in juvenile literature 
and juvenile nonfiction. 
</P>
<P>
The 8-year-old firm has produced many award-winning children's books, including 
"Mother Told Me So" (Raintree Publishers of Milwaukee), winner of the 
International Reading Assn. Children's Choice Award, and "Angel Child, Dragon 
Child," a picture book for Raintree Publishers about a Vietnamese girl adapting 
to life in America, which won an award from the National Council for Social 
Studies. 
</P>
<P>
Lee, 32, said he worked in Carnival's Minneapolis office for 4 years as 
editorial director. But the bitter Minnesota winters took their toll on the 
Santa Ana native and he suggested opening a branch office in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to move back home," he said with a laugh. "It was not hard to 
essentially persuade the heads of Carnival that a West Coast presence would be 
important. And Orange County, as I read in the newspaper every day, is the 
business leader in probably the whole state. I mean what better place to be?" 
</P>
<P>
Because most people are not aware of what a book packager is, Lee said one of 
his objectives since opening Carnival's Orange County office a year ago has 
been to spread the word. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people who want to be in publishing -- whether they think they can 
draw, write or edit -- don't know packaging is a legitimate way to get into 
publishing," said Lee, who works out of his home. 
</P>
<P>
"But they can get credits for writing books for school libraries, ghostwriting 
stories for a toy company (Carnival has done many books and tapes that go with 
learning machines and dolls), or help write audio programs for book and tape 
products. I'm able to give people publishing work where they can establish a 
portfolio." 
</P>
<P>
Another of his goals, Lee said, is that he wants publishers on the West Coast 
"to know Carnival as well as our Eastern clients do." 
</P>
<P>
Lee said publishers frequently come to a company such as Carnival when "they 
need a series and they may need a lot of books at one time. Their staffing 
situation just may not allow them to accomplish that many books in a tight time 
frame without hiring new people. And many of them just don't have the resources 
to invest in bigger staffs. They hire a packager to accomplish the same amount 
of work for basically a finite fee." 
</P>
<P>
In other cases, a publishing house with limited resources may be able to 
produce only 100 titles a year but in order to stay competitive may want 150 
titles in their yearly catalogue. When they reach that point of saturation, Lee 
said, they will hire a book packager as an extension of their staff. 
</P>
<P>
Lee said one of the purposes of opening Carnival's West Coast office was to 
increase its exposure among companies that aren't in the publishing business 
but which may want to sponsor a book as a fund-raising gift or premium for 
people who contributed to a charity favored by the corporation. As an example, 
he cited a book produced by Carnival for the Minneapolis Star Tribune on the 
1987 World Series champion Minnesota Twins. 
</P>
<P>
Although Carnival recently produced "All Through the Night," a hard-cover 
children's picture book for Abingdon Press in Nashville, Tenn., the firm 
usually sticks to producing books for series: fiction with common themes or 
characters, or nonfiction with a focus on biography, science and nature and 
serious topics such as teen-age suicide and drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"We take (a publisher's) marketing objective and then we create the writing and 
whatever illustrations or graphics are needed," he said. "We design the series 
look and recommend the format: Should it be hard cover or paperback. We create 
audio programs if it's going to be a book and tape series, and we do all the 
camera-ready work, up through arranging for printing of the series." 
</P>
<P>
The firm, according to Lee, is currently producing new software programs for 
"Socrates," a popular video-learning system by Video Technology Industries. 
</P>
<P>
But many of the current projects Carnival is working on, Lee said, are for 
publishers that specialize in creating both fiction and nonfiction books for 
school libraries. 
</P>
<P>
While he is interested in developing an Orange County free-lance talent pool, 
Lee emphasized he is not interested in having authors and illustrators send him 
manuscripts and drawings in hopes of Carnival publishing them. He would, 
however, like to see samples of their work, particularly from writers and 
illustrators who are "dying to do children's books."
