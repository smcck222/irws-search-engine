LA JOLLA PLAYHOUSE WOOS FUGARD'S LATEST; TAPER LOSES OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Athol Fugard's choice of the La Jolla Playhouse for the first West Coast 
presentation of his latest play, "My Children! My Africa!," may come as 
something of a surprise to the theater community. Given both his and the Market 
Theatre's many previous associations with Los Angeles' Mark Taper Forum and its 
artistic director, Gordon Davidson, La Jolla's announcement last week that it 
had wooed the play to its stage in July is a testament to tenacity and the 
powers of direct contact. 
</P>
<P>
"We simply asked Athol," says Robert Blacker, La Jolla's associate 
director/dramaturge. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, it wasn't quite that simple. 
</P>
<P>
La Jolla's wooing of Fugard began in earnest last August when Susan Hilferty, 
Fugard's close companion and "My Children's" designer, arrived at the Playhouse 
to costume "The Misanthrope." Blacker and artistic director Des McAnuff had 
been trying to develop a relationship with Fugard for several years, and when 
Hilferty told them about Fugard's new play and the South African reaction to 
it, they immediately asked to read it. They then asked her to tell Fugard they 
wanted to put it on. 
</P>
<P>
"This was our first opportunity to work with a man who is one of the great 
living writers of the English language," says Blacker. "Of course we were going 
to pursue him. He is one of the playwrights who has produced a body of work 
that is essential to understanding our times. We knew this was something we had 
to produce." 
</P>
<P>
"And," says Fugard, "they never changed their tune. They just kept quietly 
getting in touch with me and telling me personally, 'We want to do it. We want 
to do it. We want to do it.' I knew that Gordon was interested, too. But I 
never knew that Gordon really wanted to do it. He never contacted me personally 
to tell me he wanted the play." 
</P>
<P>
Davidson seems confused by the whole episode. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to do it," says Davidson. "I tried to arrange for it." And, he adds, 
he did in fact leave several messages at the playwright's home in Upstate New 
York. Indeed, Davidson worked through Fugard's agent at William Morris in New 
York and the American rights-holder to secure those rights. The problem seems 
to have been a lack of communication. 
</P>
<P>
The play, which premiered to overflow audiences and powerful reviews at 
Johannesburg's Market Theatre last summer before moving on to limited runs in 
Port Elizabeth and Cape Town, made its American debut in December at the 
99-seat New York Theatre Workshop in Greenwich Village. When Fugard, who was in 
Los Angeles recently for casting the La Jolla production, talks about his "My 
Children! My Africa!," his voice fills with a certain urgency. "They are my 
children," he stresses. "It is my Africa." 
</P>
<P>
While the notices were mixed, audiences remained enthusiastic. "I've never had 
responses like I've had to this play," Fugard says. 
</P>
<P>
"I gather Gordon was even more adamant in his determination to get the play for 
the Taper after he saw it (in mid-January)," says Fugard, "but even then he 
didn't get in touch with me. I would have tried to work out a deal, but as I 
say, La Jolla came to me. I only committed to La Jolla when I believed Gordon 
and the Taper were not interested." 
</P>
<P>
Fugard is on his way back to South Africa for a rest. "I want to be back home 
when they release Nelson Mandela," he says. He also wants time to take stock of 
the play's experience in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm now convinced that the play works in terms of American audiences," he 
says. "I haven't the slightest doubt anymore. The question in my mind was 
always whether American audiences would tune into the simple human story, just 
the story of three people -- would they pick up that or would the whole 
question of, once again, South African politics obscure that? Those anxieties 
are laid to rest now." 
</P>
<P>
The new play is a passionate plea for reason over violence, words over stones, 
told through two students -- a white girl named Isabel and a black boy named 
Thami -- educated in separate schools who are brought together by a peaceful 
and compassionate black teacher, Mr. M. 
</P>
<P>
Until the teacher ineffably links the two, neither had ever had real contact 
with, or even heard of, the other race before. John Kani created the role of 
the teacher at the Market and reprised it in New York, where Courtney B. Vance 
replaced Rapulana Seiphemo as Thami, and Fugard's daughter, Lisa, replaced 
Kathy-Jo Ross as Isabel. 
</P>
<P>
For Fugard, the opening day of rehearsal in Johannesburg was a chilling echo of 
his play's essence. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe it," Fugard remembers. "We were starting to explore the 
material, and I said, 'So, in terms of your white friends in the past, Thami,' 
and he said, 'I've had no white friends.' 
</P>
<P>
"He had never been to a white person's house. Kathy-Jo had never been to a 
township. In the rehearsal room, to watch these two parallel what the play is 
about, what the Market is about, was just extraordinary. And that is what 
happens in the Market all the time." 
</P>
<P>
La Jolla audiences will, no doubt, find similar parallels of their own. JEFF 
SILVERMAN

A BILL IN BRITAIN CALLS FOR THE SALE OF BROADCAST RIGHTS -- AND THIS, SAY 
OPPONENTS, WOULD DESTROY GOOD PROGRAMMING 
</P>

<P>
From a small, quiet house near a subway station in the shabbily genteel Camden 
Town district, a rear-guard action is being fought against government reforms 
that could change the face of British television. 
</P>
<P>
In this building, which normally houses an independent TV production company, a 
large, bearded, bearlike man named Simon Albury paces restlessly, rummages 
through piles of newspaper clippings, takes a seemingly endless string of phone 
calls and summons up information on a computer screen. 
</P>
<P>
Albury, 44, is director of the Campaign for Quality Television, a 550-strong 
consortium of program makers, producers and on-air personalities that opposes 
plans by Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government to implement its new 
Broadcasting Bill. The measure, according to campaign supporters, would create 
a climate of financial caution and exclusively market-driven programming under 
which the sort of shows for which British TV is famed could no longer be made. 
</P>
<P>
Among the genres described by the campaign as "endangered species" are several 
familiar to American devotees of public television. Splashy, expensive period 
dramas like "Upstairs, Downstairs," "Brideshead Revisited" and "Jewel in the 
Crown" would not, they say, be made in such a new broadcasting era. Nor would 
off-center British comedies such as "Monty Python's Flying Circus" or John 
Cleese's "Fawlty Towers"; they would be deemed too anarchic for a mass market. 
</P>
<P>
The Broadcasting Bill, currently being guided through Parliament by Home Office 
Minister David Mellor, is expected to become law later this year. Its main 
provisions aim at reforming the structure of British commercial television. At 
present, 15 companies, each holding a lucrative franchise to broadcast in a 
specific region of the country, contribute programs to ITV (Channel 3), 
Britain's commercial TV network. Many of these companies -- Granada, Central, 
Thames and Yorkshire among them -- have a distinguished track record in 
programming that has brought them international repute. As the bill stands, 
franchises for each region would be awarded to the highest-bidding company -- 
with the proceeds going to the government's treasury. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign worries that the franchises could fall into the hands of companies 
less concerned with quality programming than profit from advertising revenues. 
"We fear Channel 3 could be a junk program channel," Albury says. 
</P>
<P>
Thus the campaign's main thrust is to persuade Mellor and his civil servants to 
insert a five-word amendment into the bill that would significantly alter it. 
Under the amendment, successful bidders for each franchise would be those 
companies undertaking to spend the most money on programming, rather than 
offering large sums to treasury coffers. 
</P>
<P>
"The government talks of companies having to make programs with a minimum 
standard of quality," Albury says. "But how do you objectify quality? You 
can't. We're saying quality programming comes from talent and money. Without at 
least one of the two, you won't get quality TV. So let the companies who want 
the franchises commit to spending a certain amount on the programming itself." 
</P>
<P>
This rallying cry has attracted several illustrious names to the campaign's 
banner. George Harrison, now a producer, whose Handmade Fims has consumed much 
of his time since his Beatle days, is an ardent supporter. So is David Puttnam, 
Britain's best-known film producer and former Columbia Pictures studio head. 
Monty Python alumni John Cleese and Terry Jones have contributed time and 
money; Dame Judi Dench, one of Britain's most distinguished actresses, has been 
vocal on the campaign's behalf. And comedian Rowan Atkinson, whose cult series 
"Blackadder" is seen on the Arts &amp; Entertainment cable channel, outlined 
the campaign's position in an eloquent speech at the Conservative Party 
Conference last October. 
</P>
<P>
All fear that without a commitment to quality by the companies that win 
franchises, commercial TV will be dominated, as a campaign pamphlet puts it, by 
"mid-Atlantic mediocrity." Another fear is that the companies would be too 
preoccupied in paying off loans raised to buy their expensive franchises to 
invest in quality programming. Instead, the argument goes, they would be 
tempted to buy cheap programming from abroad: game shows, soap operas, 
long-canceled American series. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign's members also scoff at the Thatcherite view that British 
broadcasting, like other areas of commerce, should be dictated by market 
forces. This, they think, would lead to bland, consensus programming aimed 
primarily at placating a mass audience, rather than programs stemming from the 
creative impulses of gifted program makers. Opponents of the campaign, who find 
its policies elitist, complain that too much British TV is made for program 
makers and their peers. But Atkinson told the Conservative conference: "It may 
come as a surprise to you to hear that I've only ever made programs for myself 
and my friends to watch. The fact that 12 million other people tune in at the 
same time is largely accidental." 
</P>
<P>
Albury worries about the dangers of devising shows to appeal to mass audiences: 
"What makes some programs so attractive is their uncompromising quality, and 
that might get watered down in a misplaced attempt to meet the market. 
</P>
<P>
"Monty Python is an example of an uncompromising show that went on to become an 
enormous international hit. But if you're setting out to create an enormous 
international hit, you certainly don't come up with Monty Python. As John 
Cleese says, no one coming from a calculating commercial position would ever 
make Monty Python." 
</P>
<P>
Terry Jones, Cleese's former Python colleague, is equally scathing. "If 
Michelangelo had been guided solely by market forces," he says, "he'd probably 
have wallpapered the Sistine Chapel. Fortunately for us, he painted it 
instead." 
</P>
<P>
David Mellor, the Home Office minister, has stood firm against criticism of the 
bill and dismisses as "hyperbole" the arguments of groups such as the campaign 
that predict programming quality will plummet. 
</P>
<P>
"The quality threshhold (for prospective franchise buyers) will be a high fence 
to jump," Mellor insists. 
</P>
<P>
He has also warned opponents of the bill not to be patronizing toward viewers. 
"I believe that, in the end, the public is infinitely more sophisticated then 
we give them credit for, and given the opportunity will not settle for the 
lowest form of pap." 
</P>
<P>
Mellor's political boss, Home Secretary David Waddington, told the House of 
Commons last month: "No one will be able to argue -- other than tongue in cheek 
-- that we are creating a Philistine's charter. What the bill provides is a 
sensible regulatory framework for a new age in broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
"Those bidding for licenses will have to come forward with schemes for diverse 
program services, calculated to appeal to a wide range of interests and tastes. 
High-quality news and current-affairs broadcasting will also be demanded. 
</P>
<P>
"The bill's safeguards are greater than those which exist. There will be a 
clear commitment to quality, capable of rigorous enforcement." 
</P>
<P>
Among professionals in the British TV industry, however, it is widely believed 
that the Broadcasting Bill is the first phase of an attempt by Margaret 
Thatcher's government to bring broadcasters to heel. Her ministers and Tory MPs 
frequently lament that the TV industry is overrun by liberals and leftists. 
Thatcher has openly clashed with the BBC over its news coverage of the 
Falklands War and the Ulster situation; MPs have also attacked ITV for 
left-wing bias in its current-affairs programs and for the irreverent political 
satire in the puppet show "Spitting Image." 
</P>
<P>
Mistrust between Tory governments and the BBC goes back at least 35 years, when 
commercial TV was first set up -- in part as a means of breaking the BBC's 
monopoly. But commercial companies established themselves along BBC lines, as 
skeptical program makers independent of governments. 
</P>
<P>
Many observers see the current Broadcasting Bill as an indirect means of 
emasculating the BBC. Another of its provisions is for a new commercial 
channel, and the theory goes that with two commercial channels airing mostly 
lightweight, mass-appeal shows, the BBC will be forced to downplay its more 
serious programs -- documentaries and investigative journalism -- to keep a 
share of the viewing audience. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the bill are also alarmed that the two commercial channels 
(Channels 3 and 5) will no longer be under any obligation to air documentary or 
current-affairs programming at peak viewing hours. 
</P>
<P>
"The bill is aimed at destroying the BBC, and marginalizing serious TV," Terry 
Jones says. "At the moment, serious current-affairs programs and investigative 
reporting programs have a decent budget because they're shown in peak (prime) 
time. But if they're pushed off those times, their budgets won't be as big, and 
they won't be able to do the same quality of investigative work." 
</P>
<P>
Jones cites Thatcher's well-reported outrage at a Thames documentary "Death on 
the Rock," which questioned her government's motive when British security 
forces gunned down three suspected IRA terrorists in Gibraltar. "Margaret 
Thatcher never lets up on what she wants to do," he adds. "And what she wants 
to do is soften up television. If she gets her way, it'll be all game shows and 
talk shows." 
</P>
<P>
Even some of Thatcher's fellow Conservatives in Parliament concede she seems 
personally motivated on this issue. The moderate Tory MP Julian Critchley, who 
in a UK Press Gazette article attacked the bill as "a nasty example of 
vulgarity," noted that it derived from a white paper on broadcasting, which was 
in turn the child of a cabinet subcommittee. "It will come as no surprise that 
the subcommittee was chaired by the prime minister herself," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Critchley is by no means the only Conservative critic of the bill. Another Tory 
lawmaker, George Walden, has described it as "contemptible." Its spirit, he 
said, "is frankly and irredeemably Philistine." 
</P>
<P>
Back in his office, Simon Albury is pacing the floor, sorting desperately 
through piles of newspapers and reflecting on what the Campaign for Quality 
Television has achieved. 
</P>
<P>
Albury and colleagues have met twice with Mellor to urge amendments to the 
bill. Mellor described their first meeting as constructive. However, after the 
second, on Jan. 24, Albury said Mellor had been reluctant to budge on the 
principal provisions of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Though several commercial TV companies have spent large sums on full-page 
newspaper advertisements stressing their own commitment to excellence, the 
campaign has grabbed the initiative and the visibility in opposing the bill. 
</P>
<P>
"We're fortunate that some of the people in our campaign have a lot of money 
and feel strongly about it," Albury says. Only about 20,000 has come in from 
donations, but the campaign has been influential and is shrewdly run. "One of 
the things I like about it," David Puttnam says, "is that this was the first 
campaign that didn't come from a group of people with an angle, as it were. 
These are people whose jobs are not going to suffer whatever the outcome (of 
the bill). They're interested in the purest sense. I also like the way they've 
approached the issue. They've taken the government's argument about wanting 
choice, quality and competition, and turned it on its head." 
</P>
<P>
Since September, Albury has been on sabbatical from his job as an in-house 
producer at Manchester-based Granada, where he has worked for 16 years on 
current-affairs programs such as "World in Action" and documentaries such as 
"Sergeant Pepper: It Was 20 Years Ago Today." 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, he says, "we knew there was going to be a broadcasting white paper 
(a British government publication summarizing policy that frequently precedes a 
bill going through Parliament). And there was a general feeling that 
broadcasting was under threat." When the white paper was published early last 
year, the fears of many broadcasting professionals were realized. "I had a 
project which fell through," recalls Albury, "so I had plenty of time to work 
on the campaign. I always feel that my project was the first victim of the 
white paper." 
</P>
<P>
He had been approached by George Harrison, who wanted Granada to make a film 
about the life of Indian sitar virtuoso Ravi Shankar, who enjoyed a raffish 
existence in Paris bistros, New York jazz clubs and at Hollywood movie star 
parties before returning home to perfect his musicianship under a guru's 
guidance. Harrison offered to be presenter of the film, which was budgeted at 
slightly more than 200,000. 
</P>
<P>
But Granada passed on the project. "It was felt," Albury says, choosing his 
words with care, "that there would not be enough 'return' in making the film, 
which needed a lot of library footage and extensive shooting in India. Once, no 
one in TV ever talked about the 'return.' But the white paper transformed the 
way commercial TV companies are run." 
</P>
<P>
For the campaign, Albury used as his model Charles Winner, a Southern 
California political campaigner he had seen in action in 1976, influencing 
public opinion on behalf of the nuclear industry lobby for a statewide 
proposition. 
</P>
<P>
"He taught me that a campaign starts early," Albury says. "And it's true. We 
kept going for months, and no one took any notice of us. Now, because we've 
been continuing the argument, people are starting to take notice." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the charges of elitism leveled at the campaign rankle. "They're 
nonsense," Albury says emphatically. "What we are for is a quality system on 
those channels which are freely available. And a quality system is one which 
has light entertainment and sports and quiz shows as well as those other things 
we're fighting for -- like documentaries and current affairs shows and 
educational programs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an incredibly patronizing view of people that says, 'Oh, it's a mass 
audience out there, all they want is game shows.' That's not a view we take. 
It's the mix we value -- and the government aims to destroy that mix." 
</P>
<P>
Puttnam agrees. "British broadcasting has evolved organically, and you can't 
paint any scenario that throws up better programming in terms of quality and 
diversity. If this bill goes through unamended, we will have to look at a 
British television ecology that's been damaged." 
</P>
<P>
The campaign's main aims do seem to dovetail neatly with public opinion. It 
recently commissioned an opinion poll that showed that more than 80% of Britons 
wanted the cash from commercial TV franchise bids used for making quality TV 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
Albury punches his hand with his fist as he recites the figure. "Short of the 
government accepting all our proposals, we're as well placed as we can be right 
now," he says. "And that's because our ideas are sensible."

ANOTHER CASE OF MURDER IN MISSISSIPPI; 
</P>
<P>
TV MOVIE ON THE KILLING OF THREE CIVIL RIGHTS WORKERS IN 1964 TRIES TO FILL IN 
WHAT 'MISSISSIPPI BURNING' LEFT OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Hollywood types flew into Meridian, Miss., to soak up local color for their 
movie. Naturally, they had to meet Lawrence Rainey, the old-time sheriff. He 
always seemed to be in the action around Neshoba County. 
</P>
<P>
This was about three years ago, as producer Tova Laiter and screenwriter 
Stanley Weiser, the visitors, were planning a film about what Mississippi calls 
"the troubles" -- that summer of '64 when those three "agitator kids" -- 
civil-rights workers -- were killed by Ku Klux Klan night riders and all the 
wrath came down. 
</P>
<P>
Weiser recalls the gathering at the restaurant at the Howard Johnson's: "So 
Rainey comes in with his country bumpkin lawyer . . . (and he was) trying to 
tell us to do 'The Sheriff Rainey Story.' 'Why do you want to dig up these old 
troubles again? Sheriff Rainey's a prince of a man and you should do his story, 
like "Walking Tall," Buford Pusser.' " 
</P>
<P>
Laiter recalls Rainey as very affable. He was tried in the case, not on murder 
charges but on federal charges of depriving the three men of their civil rights 
-- the two whites, Michael (Mickey) Schwerner, 24, and Andy Goodman, 20, and 
the black, James Chaney, 21. 
</P>
<P>
Seven men were convicted, including Deputy Sheriff Cecil Ray Price; Rainey and 
seven others were acquitted. The sentences ran from three to 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
The irony these many years later was that Rainey was working around Meridian as 
a security guard. Working for two black men. 
</P>
<P>
Weiser remembers now, "They talked about how there was no problems before 1964: 
'Before this whole civil rights happened, the blacks were treated well.' We 
asked about all the bodies (of black people) found in the rivers." The lawyer 
said that those weren't necessarily racist killings and some might have 
committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
Rainey recited his theory that the murders in 1964 were done by "their own" -- 
other civil rights workers -- and then the FBI covered it up. 
</P>
<P>
Weiser recalls that Laiter was dumbstruck. She kept asking, "How can we believe 
that?" 
</P>
<P>
Passions ran high and wild around the murders in Mississippi, and still do. 
When it comes to the retelling of this story, truth also runs wild, although 
the latest version, via Laiter and Weiser, called "Murder in Mississippi," 
might be the best visual history of Freedom Summer. It can be seen Monday at 9 
p.m. on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
The core of the cast is Tom Hulce as Schwerner, Jennifer Grey as wife Rita 
Schwerner, Blair Underwood as Chaney and Josh Charles as Goodman. 
</P>
<P>
It has been hard to round up the facts, as the sheriff's version suggests. 
</P>
<P>
Two other film versions about the same incident -- including the Academy 
Award-nominated "Mississippi Burning," showing this month on several cable 
movie channels -- focused on the manhunt for the killers. This new one puts the 
story in its broader context; it is in effect a "prequel," showing what led up 
to the murders. 
</P>
<P>
"Murder in Mississippi" relates that it was the black leadership in "the 
movement" that called for the invasion of 1,000 or more young white activists 
into the state to register black voters that hot summer. One black leader 
comments in the film that white people are part of the problem and have to be 
part of the solution. 
</P>
<P>
Civil rights advocates believe that if it had just been Chaney who was killed, 
the media would have stayed at home. The fact that two young white men were 
killed inflamed the national conscience and set about breaking down the 
barriers to black franchise in Mississippi and the whole South. In that sense, 
they were landmark murders. 
</P>
<P>
A four-hour miniseries that veteran TV writer-producer Calvin Clements Sr. 
wrote for CBS in 1975, "Attack on Terror: The FBI vs. the Ku Klux Klan," 
preponderantly followed the FBI version of the manhunt, aided by William 
Conrad's booming documentary voice. Wayne Rogers and Dabney Coleman were the 
star FBI agents; Ned Beatty was "Sheriff Ollie Thompson." 
</P>
<P>
"I had to change all the names," remembers Clements, "and I got a call from the 
network and they wanted to change the name of the state! I said, 'You want to 
put it in Tennessee?' " 
</P>
<P>
The hit feature film from English director Alan Parker, "Mississippi Burning," 
which came out at the end of 1988, was intended as a fiction with a lot of 
factual background, but again, dealt mostly on the manhunt, starring Gene 
Hackman and Willem Dafoe as ace FBI agents. (It received seven Oscar 
nominations, including best picture, best director and best actor for Hackman 
-- and ended up winning one, which went to Peter Biziou for best 
cinematography.) 
</P>
<P>
"Mississippi Burning" evolved into a raucous, vengeance-is-thine movie that did 
a virtual double reverse on the blaxploitation films of the mid-1970s -- only 
with the white guys raging against the whites over the black frustrations. The 
beating of a white woman, wife of the deputy, set Hackman and his agents off on 
a rampage of kidnappings, extortions, assaults, arsons, breakings and other 
mayhem. 
</P>
<P>
The film was criticized for telling the story from a strictly white point of 
view. Its black characters pretty much stood around, looking stalwart and 
resolute but immobile, like the Indians in Old West movies. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of excitement and a lot of blood and a lot of action," observed Ben 
Chaney Jr., 37, brother of James Chaney, "but it didn't reflect the attitude of 
the people who were there at the time, and that distorted history." 
</P>
<P>
Both the surviving Chaney and Dr. Carolyn Goodman, Andrew's mother, visited 
L.A. at the behest of NBC to discuss "Murder in Mississippi." Both like its 
mood and accuracy of the time and the place. 
</P>
<P>
"Seeing this movie for the first time," said Chaney, who was 12 at the time of 
the murders, "I was sort of relaxed and I thought Hollywood was getting close 
to who the people were in the movement who contributed so much to the 
struggle." 
</P>
<P>
Goodman, a psychologist for the New York State Office of Mental Health, noted, 
"On the whole, this movie did not pull a lot of punches. They were focusing on 
what happened, and what happened was an incredibly powerful time in history. It 
was not easy to watch it for me." 
</P>
<P>
And the pages of history may not close with Monday's broadcast. The Mississippi 
attorney general, Mike Moore, announced about a year ago that he would examine 
the 1964 files and see if state murder charges could be brought. He did not 
retern several calls from The Times but if he does proceed, it could evolve 
into yet another version of the truth. 
</P>
<P>
During their recent visits to Los Angeles, Carolyn Goodman and Ben Chaney 
endorsed the NBC project and introduced the film makers to families and 
friends. The Schwerner family avoided the movie. Producer Laiter said that 
Mickey Schwerner's father told her "the family had a policy not to talk about 
it and not cooperate in a movie, that his son was no more a hero than anybody 
else." 
</P>
<P>
Goodman and Chaney said that they were disturbed by "Mississippi Burning." 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't about civil rights," said Goodman. "It was a film that used the 
deaths of the boys as a means of solving the murders and the FBI being heroes." 
</P>
<P>
(The reality is that the FBI was caught between the warring factions that 
summer. The earlier productions deified the bureau; "Murder in Mississippi" 
runs an actual TV news segment prior to the "invasion" in which J. Edgar 
Hoover, the FBI's impervious chieftain, rails against the suggestion that his 
agents should get involved. 
</P>
<P>
("We most certainly do not give protection to civil rights workers," the real 
Hoover says in the news clip. "In the first place, the FBI is not a police 
organization, purely an investigative organization. And the protection of 
individual citizens, either natives of the state or coming into the state, is a 
matter for local authorities." 
</P>
<P>
(In the TV movie scene, the civil rights workers, who are watching the TV 
screen, hoot at Hoover's statement.) 
</P>
<P>
Calvin Clements Sr., semi-retired at 74 (he has a book being circulated in New 
York, a screenplay being proposed for cable, a musical "kicking around"), was 
told back in 1974 to avoid any contact with the families. But he feels that his 
"Attack on Terror" still is "100% accurate." 
</P>
<P>
He studied articles, 3,000 pages of trial testimony and "all the FBI 
investigative reports." (In his writing career he had done episodes of the old 
"The FBI" series.) 
</P>
<P>
"I had to verify it all," he said. "I had an (FBI) agent with me all the time." 
</P>
<P>
One recent night he came across "Mississippi Burning" on a cable channel and 
"after an hour I just turned it off, it was so false. It was disgraceful." 
</P>
<P>
Frederick Zollo, producer of "Mississippi Burning," said he was "surprised 
about the enormous reaction." 
</P>
<P>
He said the movie was intended as "a drama, as powerful as we could make it, 
using the three murders as a backdrop to the study of racism in Neshoba County 
(changed here to Jessup County) and in the larger view of America. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we certainly succeeded in that respect. I think we galvanized a 
nation, which a good movie should do. We made America think about the events of 
that summer and the events in America today, whether it be in Boston (the Carol 
Stuart murder) the last few weeks, in Howard Beach (the racial incident in 
Queens, N.Y.) or in that county in Georgia (Forsyth) where no blacks live 
because of what occurred decades ago (KKK lynchings in 1912)." 
</P>
<P>
They didn't set out to remake a true story but, he said, many memorable events 
were carefully reproduced from newsreel footage, including the march on 
downtown Philadelphia, Miss., and the speech over James Chaney at the funeral. 
</P>
<P>
In publicity notes, director Parker wrote that "Our film cannot be the 
definitive film on the (Movement). Our heroes are still white. And in truth, 
the film would probably never have been made if they weren't," meaning that the 
studios wouldn't finance it out of fear that the white audience might not 
attend a film with black heroes. 
</P>
<P>
Goodman said that "Mississippi Burning" did serve to arouse interest, 
"especially among young people," who hadn't known anything about that time in 
the South. 
</P>
<P>
"At the same time," Chaney put in, "the image that younger people got (from the 
film) about the times, about Mississippi itself and about the people who 
participated in the movement being passive, was pretty negative and it didn't 
reflect the truth." 
</P>
<P>
The survivors both acknowledged inaccuracies in the new TV representation. 
Chaney, who used to "hang out" with his older brother because their mother 
always pressed James into baby-sitting, is shown in playing with his Slinky on 
the stairs at the civil rights office in Meridian. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if we had Slinkys in Mississippi at that time," Ben Chaney said. 
"I know we used to play out in front of the office with marbles and throw rocks 
at girls," he noted, adding a smile at the recollection. 
</P>
<P>
Goodman had minor quibbles "but I'm not sure they will interact on the impact 
of the film." 
</P>
<P>
The image of son Andrew, for example. He trained with the workers at the 
orientation sessions at Western College for Women in Oxford, Ohio, prior to 
"invading" Mississippi. He had even played a racist heckler during the fierce 
indoctrination sessions. Then he was among the vanguard heading into 
Mississippi but was there only one day before the deadly trip into the wilds of 
Neshoba County. 
</P>
<P>
In the film, Andrew Goodman is depicted as a boy who just stumbles into 
trouble. But his mother insisted, "Andy knew what it was all about. (It came) 
from his family life. We were always involved in all kinds of demonstrations, 
pro-labor, anti-fascist. That's the story of our lives. Andy was not an 
innocent." 
</P>
<P>
But, again, that misportrayal doesn't affect the essence of the film, the 
mother said. 
</P>
<P>
She noted that many of the so-called Northern agitators were "more than 
students," that many were "people from the religious community, they were 
lawyers, they were doctors, a whole cross section of people who came from far 
from Mississippi. They came from lives of relative security. They knew they 
weren't going down there for a holiday." 
</P>
<P>
Chaney would have preferred more emphasis on members of the Mt. Zion Methodist 
Church -- the one that was burned by the Klan in the incident that brought the 
three young men into the night -- "and their attitudes and how come this church 
out of all the churches in Neshoba County was the one that stood up first. What 
made those people do that?" 
</P>
<P>
Chaney referred to some dialogue in the film that some black leaders were not 
willing to accept leadership of white people. "(They felt that) this was their 
movement and they didn't believe white people could stand up under the line of 
fire anyway. And when people like Michael Schwerner came down and stood up on 
the line of fire, he got the respect of the people of Mississippi -- blacks, 
young and old -- and from then on they were able to work together." 
</P>
<P>
Goodman added that there were very few defections after the murders: "That's 
something that has to be known too." 
</P>
<P>
Tova Laiter, now president of Freddie Fields Productions, first heard the name 
James Chaney in 1984 from writer Ben Stein. Eddie Murphy's "people" 
(management) told her that they were looking for movie ideas, and she in turn 
was discussing possibilities with Stein. 
</P>
<P>
"A friend who had been a state trooper in Arkansas," recalled Stein, "told me a 
story about how he had known state troopers in Mississippi who had known Chaney 
and said what was unknown about him was that he was funny, a mimic, a comical 
guy. He could do imitations like Eddie Murphy." 
</P>
<P>
"Why," asked Laiter, "had I never heard of this James Chaney? I thought, 'How 
come I don't know about this great story?' " 
</P>
<P>
Laiter hadn't known that much American history. She was raised in Israel, 
studied art and philosophy at Hebrew University and served as a sergeant in 
Army communications in the War Room in Jerusalem during the Six Day War. She 
remembered with some pride, "I gave the historic announcement that 'We have the 
Wailing Wall in our hands!' " 
</P>
<P>
"As it turned out, Murphy didn't like it," she said. "His career was just 
getting rolling and he didn't know if audiences would accept him dying." 
</P>
<P>
But she was intrigued about the Mississippi summer and started making the 
rounds, talking to perhaps 20 people: "Everybody was patronizing. They said, 
'Tova, you know better than that.' It's true, if you take on a black subject 
matter, you're going on a suicidal mission." 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, she had a "pitch" meeting with Mark Canton, then Warner Bros. 
president of worldwide motion picture production (now executive vice president 
of the corporate Warners): "She presented the story with such passion and it 
got to me so quickly," recalled Canton, who had studied contemporary American 
history at UCLA. "It touched a nerve in me. I thought it was incredibly 
relevant and, from the dramatic viewpoint, this story was very emotional and 
very accessible." 
</P>
<P>
He talked with Lucy Fisher (now executive vice president for theatrical 
production at Warners) and the deal was set by the end of the day, with rare 
speed. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed like a really human way to tell a story that was a story that still 
affects the nation," Fisher said. "Most things are didactic, but this one you 
could use the eyes and ears of Mickey and James." 
</P>
<P>
Laiter met with 10 or 12 writers, finally working out a script deal with 
Stanley Weiser, who had written "Wall Street" and "Project X." "My approach was 
to isolate the story on Chaney and Schwerner," Weiser said. "I thought about 
making it a 'buddy film' -- those dreaded words." 
</P>
<P>
Then they set about researching, talking with the old Freedom Summer gang in 
Boston, New York, New Orleans, Meridian. 
</P>
<P>
When "Mississippi Burning" hit big, Warners tensed. "From the management point 
of view, we had a wonderful script and we would have been happy to wait a year 
or two or three," said Fisher, "and then come at it again." But "Tova was 
incredibly intent on moving it forward," Lucy Fisher said. Laiter decided she 
didn't want to wait for a feature production and agreed to release the script 
for a TV production. 
</P>
<P>
Enter TV producer David L. Wolper. About a year ago, he recalled, "I was having 
dinner with Bob Daly (chief executive officer of Warners) and saying, 'Are 
there any films that you're not making, with scripts that may make good 
television things?' He said, 'Yes, as a matter of fact.' " 
</P>
<P>
Wolper then became executive producer of the project and the script was 
reworked for TV use. "The violence and language were a little coarser than for 
television, but it could easily be adapted," said Tony Masucci, NBC vice 
president for movies and miniseries. "The only important thing we lost because 
of time was the James Chaney relationship with a young woman in his home town. 
There were some lovely moments but we had to trim it." 
</P>
<P>
With such "true-life" or "fact-based" dramas, the question always lingers about 
what is true representation and what isn't. It's obviously a heavier question 
with heavier topics. 
</P>
<P>
Wolper, a veteran of the docudrama genre, insists, "Unless it's a court trial 
or Richard Nixon's office, nothing between two people is recorded on tape. So a 
writer creates dialogue. So right away you're taking dramatic liberties." 
</P>
<P>
He said that the purpose of the docudrama is to reflect "the emotional sense" 
of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Director Roger Young, who shot the TV movie around Atlanta, went into 
Mississippi to investigate: "I was very concerned that we do it as right as we 
could. I drove the same roads, I went to the killing sites. I went to the 
church. "I talked to people on the streets, which was quite interesting. 
Especially this one man, running a drug store there. I said, 'What did you 
think of "Mississippi Burning?" He said, 'Well, you know, it was an OK movie.' 
I told him I was from out of town and 'What did you feel about this kind of 
thing?' He said, 'You see how old I am?' I said, 'Yeah.' He said, 'Well, I 
think they got what they deserved.' " 
</P>
<P>
Carolyn Goodman is a quiet, thoughtful woman who speaks with precision and 
authority and expresses a strong will. Ben Chaney has a feisty side apparently 
built up over years of fervor over matters of civil rights. Even within weeks 
of the discovery of the bodies, little Ben was in a group of two dozen 
demonstrators who were jailed for trying to register at all-white Meridian 
schools. "At 12 you don't feel you're too small to take on the world," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He has ridden the roller coaster of emotions of the civil rights movement. 
After repeated threats, the family moved to Harlem, where young Ben eventually 
began hanging with Black Panther militants. 
</P>
<P>
In 1970, at age 17, after a wild excursion with two friends into the South that 
exploded in the killings of four people in South Carolina and Florida, he was 
tried three times on felony murder charges. He was acquitted on one charge and 
found guilty on two, with mercy recommended in both cases since it was 
acknowledged that he didn't participate in the actual murders but drove the car 
and served as the lookout for his two young black companions, one a 19-year-old 
Vietnam War veteran. He served 13 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a regular parole scheduled in the year 2014," Chaney said. "Ramsey Clark 
(former U.S. attorney general and a major civil rights activist) got into my 
case in 1980 and he finally convinced the Florida Parole Board to give me a 
hearing in 1983 and I was released in September." 
</P>
<P>
For a time he worked as a clerk in Clark's law practice in New York, and Clark 
donated office space for the year-old James Earl Chaney Foundation, dedicated 
primarily to voter registration drives. 
</P>
<P>
"But now I'm moving back to Mississippi," Chaney said last week. "We're going 
to station the foundation in Meridian. We're trying to look for a site there to 
put a building up or maybe rent some space in the meantime, hopefully by the 
end of the summer." 
</P>
<P>
So Chaney goes home. Will the New Mississippi be any different than the Old 
Mississippi? One question put to him during a press conference here was, "What 
were the decent white people in Mississippi doing at this time?" 
</P>
<P>
Chaney returned, "I don't know of any decent white person in Mississippi in 
1964."

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: 'SON OF SODERBERGH' FAILS TO MATERIALIZE; 
</P>
<P>
THERE WAS NO 'SEX, LIES AND VIDEOTAPE' AMONG THE FILMS AT U. S. FILM FESTIVAL, 
BUT THERE WAS MUCH WORTH SEEING

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a year ago, almost to the hour, that Steven Soderbergh sat nervously 
through his first public screening of "sex, lies, and videotape" at the United 
States Film Festival and walked out into almost a parody scene of agents and 
distributors pressing the flesh -- in his case, pressing their business cards 
into his flesh. 
</P>
<P>
Soderbergh is an internationally acclaimed director now. The Cannes Film 
Festival, where "sex, lies" won the Gold Palm and its star James Spader was 
named best actor, fixed that. But for Soderbergh, as for others before him, the 
yellow brick road began here on the eastern slope of the Utah Rockies where he 
returned triumphant this year to serve as a juror -- a writer-director with a 
major studio contract taking his jurying duties very seriously. 
</P>
<P>
The image of Soderbergh's success haunted the place. You could see it in 
journalists comparing notes, trying to second-guess what the new hit would be 
and who it would come from. You could see it in the young film makers, hungry 
to shoulder their "burdens" of celebrity and the choices that success could 
bring. 
</P>
<P>
But, while no "sex, lies, and videotape" emerged, there certainly were 
discoveries to be made, if you looked carefully. 
</P>
<P>
It may be presumptuous to "discover" a director who's won a MacArthur 
Foundation Grant, the "genius" award, which film maker Charles Burnett has 
done. But in plain fact, "To Sleep With Anger," which the gently self-effacing 
Burnett wrote and directed, may bring an end to his relative anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
A bracingly unexpected story, which never quite goes in a predictable 
direction, it gives Danny Glover his richest, most multilayered role to date as 
Harry Mention, a friend from the Old South who comes to visit his great old 
friends, Gideon and Susie, living comfortably among their children and 
grandchildren in a big old house in South Central Los Angeles, and very nearly 
brings the place down around them. 
</P>
<P>
Glover may have been the magnet around which financing and the producers 
gathered. But he is only the most visible member of a brilliant ensemble, whom 
Burnett works like a chamber orchestra, letting the cello tones of Paul 
Butler's Gideon play against the viola beauty of actress Mary Alice, as Susie. 
This is the cream of ensemble actors, playing the jealousies and strains, 
duties and devotions among three generations of a family. It's not quite black 
Chekhov, but it's not unreasonable to think of Chekhov as you watch. 
</P>
<P>
Everett Lewis, whose "Natural History of Parking Lots" became the buzz film 
among the critical community, will probably never go Soderbergh's route. With 
his mesmerizing black-and-white movie about screwed-up advantaged kids in 
eerily unused Hancock Park mansions, he's no more mainstream material than Jim 
Jarmusch, but he is an original. He has workshopped at the hosting Sundance 
Institute on his next film; this one is already invited to the Berlin Festival. 
With his generous take on life and youth, his artist's eye and a deadpan humor, 
he's one to watch. In any case, rail thin at more than six feet, with a laugh 
that once got him thrown off a bus, Lewis is almost impossible not to watch. 
</P>
<P>
Over at the Discovery Program, set up to give people in other branches of the 
movie industry a chance to direct, were two more finds. 
</P>
<P>
"Private Debts," which has taken prizes at two festivals before Park City, is 
haunting. To be discovered here are its first-time director, Nancy Cooperstein, 
and the extraordinary, luminous performance of its central actress, Sheila 
Kelley. The story of how the perceived pressures of society force a young woman 
to sacrifice the thing dearest to her is played out in small-town California. 
From the film's assured details, Cooperstein's strength seems to be in her work 
with actors; there's also great swirl and motion to the dance sequences at the 
heart of the action. It's the debut of a director with her own style and the 
humanistic sensibilities of a Martin Ritt. 
</P>
<P>
Jessie Nelson took "To the Moon, Alice" from a story by the fine novelist Lynn 
Sharon Schwartz. The film follows a young homeless couple who live each night 
on a deserted TV sitcom set. It's a great premise and an almost-realized film 
that gets a little soft at its very close, but as a writer-director, Nelson is 
a talent to mark. 
</P>
<P>
An appealing maverick quality could be found in any number of festival films 
and events. This was, after all, the year that Melvin Van Peebles, the mentor 
of black cinema, was honored with a complete retrospective. Richard Lester, 
another writer-director whose films were honored with a generous roundup this 
year, is out of an equally seditious mold. 
</P>
<P>
When brothers Reginald and Warrington Hudlin took two awards -- the Film 
</P>
<P>
Maker's Trophy and the prize for cinematographic excellence -- for "House 
Party," a hugely engaging rap on black teen-age life, they dedicated the prizes 
to Van Peebles. 
</P>
<P>
There may be a little of Van Peebles' spunk kick-starting "House Party," but 
really, it's amazingly conservative considering that the Hudlins are still shy 
of 35. Their greatly talented cast of kids do the right thing, morally, all the 
time without an adult around, a quirk that will probably give the film's 
distributors, New Line Cinema, a truly "mixed" audience: teen-agers and 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
Early word of mouth created the hope that Whit Stillman's "Metropolitan" would 
walk off with the roses, but it's decorously listless. "Metropolitan" hovers 
over a nightly gathering of New York debs and their escorts during the 
Christmas holidays like a solicitous waiter. For sheer jaw-dropping obtuseness, 
this group could probably out-point Dan Quayle, but it hardly seems reason 
enough to dedicate an evening to their company. 
</P>
<P>
Also too far on the proper side is "Longtime Companion," directed by Norman 
Rene, which traces the path of AIDS through a group of New Yorkers from 1981 to 
the present. Its touching performances, particularly by Bruce Davison, Mark 
Lamos and Mary-Louise Parker, won it the Audience Award for drama, but one 
could wish that in a first feature film on the subject, it felt and looked less 
like a TV drama. 
</P>
<P>
The AFI-produced "Hollywood Mavericks" is an paean to sedition, a smartly 
edited, well-thought-out series of conversations with some of the screen's 
better rebels: Martin Scorsese (the fan), Peter Bogdanovich (the historian), 
John Cassavetes (the purist), Alan Rudolph (the poet) and a dozen more, not one 
of them uninteresting for a single frame. 
</P>
<P>
As an unplanned companion piece to "Mavericks" was "Preston Sturges: The Rise 
and Fall of an American Dreamer," the worldly, debilitating history of a talent 
who seemingly couldn't wait to ruin everything he'd gained, including his 
pioneering status as a sound-era writer-director. 
</P>
<P>
Like Sturges' films, which seem to dance before your eyes, "Dancing for Mr. B." 
does that literally. As six of his great ballerinas, one of whom -- Maria 
Tallchief -- was also his wife, contribute a mosaic of details about working 
with George Balanchine, lavishly illustrated by clips of the ballets, it 
doesn't matter that he becomes more, not less mysterious. That was Mr. B., and 
film maker Anne Belle, clearly at home in this world, knows it better than 
most. 
</P>
<P>
Equally lively was "Berkeley in the Sixties," a rigorously bright study of that 
churning period of American political action. To the credit of Mark Kitchell 
and company, the film's intellect is matched by a vivid sense of history; this 
really is the '60s again. It won the Audience Award in the documentary vein, as 
well it might. 
</P>
<P>
If it seems as though the documentaries had run away with the festival, quite 
so. Does it say something about our pull toward "real" life? I doubt it; it may 
just mean that documentarians are becoming poets rather than pedants. 
</P>
<P>
As an example, "James Baldwin: The Price of the Ticket" was one of the 
festival's great emotional jolts; a portrait of the man whose books, in the 
1950s, were primers of political and personal understanding. Those who may 
never have read him will meet an eloquent, resounding and infinitely humane 
spirit. "You were black, impoverished, homosexual," one questioner ventures. 
"Weren't those three strikes against you?" "I thought I'd hit the jackpot," 
Baldwin smiles. 
</P>
<P>
Film makers Karen Thorson and Douglas Dempsey turned to Maya Angelou; Amiri 
Baraka; William Styron; Baldwin's marvelous brother and lifelong companion, 
David, and more, to build their picture of the man who left self-imposed exile 
to come home for the civil rights movement, to "preach the gospel of freedom." 
Asked near the end of his life whether he considered himself bitter, Baldwin 
says with remarkable forbearance that he'd heard about progress for blacks 
since he was in grade school; now, at 62, he was still hearing about it: "How 
much time do you want for your progress?" 
</P>
<P>
Festival judging is sometimes unfathomable. Perhaps the biggest stir at the 
awards ceremony came when "Chameleon Street," Wendell B. Harris Jr.'s uneven, 
ambitious first feature, won the Grand Jury Prize in the dramatic category, 
while Burnett's "To Sleep With Anger" received the Special Award of the jury. 
Reportedly, the judges considered "Chameleon Street's" style more adventurous, 
which is a little like choosing a big zirconian over a small, perfect diamond. 
No matter: as surely as audiences have a taste for subtlety over glitz, 
Burnett's drama will have its day. 
</P>
<P>
For Los Angeles audiences who might like to make up their own minds on these 
films, the AFIfest in April will include among its other Sundance choices the 
documentaries "Berkeley in the Sixties," "Dancing for Mr. B" and "Preston 
Sturges," along with the two grand-prize winners, "H-2 Worker" and "Water and 
Power." Dramatic films will include "Chameleon Street," "Metropolitan" and "The 
Natural History of Parking Lots." Plenty of room for discussion here.

A fierce storm with winds gusting to 104 m.p.h. battered northern France, 
killing at least 13 people and forcing a Pan Am jetliner to abort a takeoff 
after howling winds tore a six-foot gash in one of the wings, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
At Chartres in the Loire region, the winds ripped a dozen copper strips from 
the roof of the city's 12th-Century Gothic Notre Dame de Chartres cathedral, 
leaving two huge holes over the nave. Nine of the dead were in the Paris 
region, most of them victims of falling trees and flying debris. A 50-year-old 
man in Finistere was blown to his death while repairing a television antenna on 
his roof.

The government lifted curfew restrictions for 12 hours in Srinagar, summer 
capital of Jammu and Kashmir state, but shops remained closed and few people 
ventured out because of a strike called by Muslim separatists. 
</P>
<P>
A bomb exploded in the city during the relaxation, but a senior police official 
said there were no casualties. The Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front spread a 
strike call by word of mouth, shopkeepers said. The front is spearheading a 
campaign for secession of the state's predominantly Muslim Kashmir Valley from 
India, which has a Hindu majority. At least 76 people have been killed since 
the government first cracked down on the secessionist movement two weeks ago.

Armed robbers stole at least 200 ancient Roman gold artifacts from a storehouse 
in the excavation site at Herculaneum, a popular tourist center. 
</P>
<P>
Police said two robbers climbed over the gates, tied up six guards and with the 
help of other robbers they let into the site, escaped with sacks full of gold 
bracelets, earrings and other trinkets dating from the 1st Century. 
Herculaneum, along with Pompeii, nine miles south of Naples, was an ancient 
Roman city engulfed by ashes and debris from an eruption of the Vesuvius 
volcano in AD 79. Museum officials said the stolen artifacts are irreplaceable 
and therefore priceless, but would be difficult to sell.

<P>
The Golden Gate Bridge may soon undergo modern wind stress tests, partially to 
determine how the 52-year-old span would withstand blustery weather if a second 
deck is added for a rail transit system. A recommendation by chief bridge 
engineer Dan Mohn to study how much wind it would take to damage the suspension 
bridge, which in 1982 withstood 70-m.p.h. winds, was endorsed unanimously 
Friday by a committee of bridge directors. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, wind tests costing $39,863 would be conducted in 
conjunction with a $423,640 three-dimensional computer study of how a possible 
rail transit system on a lower deck would affect the bridge. The latter study 
is due to be released March 25 by T.Y. Lin International of San Francisco.

BLUE LINE TO PUT RAIL SERVICE BACK ON TRACK; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSIT: THREE DECADES AFTER THE RED CARS STOPPED RUNNING, THE LONG 
BEACH-TO-L.A. LINE WILL BE ROLLING BY JULY 16. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three decades after the Big Red Car trolleys were put out of business by autos, 
buses and Southern California freeways, Los Angeles transit officials later 
this year will start operating a new rail line in an effort to help unsnarl 
traffic congestion and avoid gridlock. 
</P>
<P>
The tracks, rail yards and shops are built, the overhead power wires are hot, 
and the first of the big blue-and-white passenger cars are being tested on 
short stretches of the 22-mile, $871-million Long Beach-Los Angeles Light Rail 
Line. 
</P>
<P>
Trains will officially start running between the two cities July 16. The fare 
will be $1.10 one way, and the trains will run every 10 minutes, carrying an 
estimated 20,000 riders a day, if all goes as planned. 
</P>
<P>
Not since 1961 has Los Angeles had a commuter rail system. That was the year 
the Pacific Electric Co. shut down the last of the Big Red Cars that once 
trundled along 1,100 miles of track, linking places like San Bernardino to Los 
Angeles and the beach cities. 
</P>
<P>
Officially, the new route will be called the Blue Line and will be the first 
operational system in a proposed $5-billion, 150-mile commuter rail network 
planned for Los Angeles County. The second leg of this network -- the 
$3.4-billion Metro Rail subway -- will be called the Red Line and will run 
north from Union Station to the San Fernando Valley sometime in the late 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Transportation Commission is the planning and funding 
authority for the ambitious return to commuter rail and is building the Blue 
Line. The Southern California Rapid Transit District is building the first leg 
of the 17-mile Metro Rail subway and will operate all of the trains in the 
network, including the Blue Line. 
</P>
<P>
The commission is paying the RTD $10 million to start up and run the Blue Line. 
In addition, the commission estimates operation and maintenance costs will run 
$20 million a year, financed by fares and local transit-tax dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Officials report that construction of the Blue Line is more than 90% complete, 
5% over budget and, for the most part, on schedule. However, there are a couple 
of hang-ups: 
</P>
<P>
* Temporarily, the line will end at Pico Boulevard in downtown Los Angeles 
instead of going underground into the Blue Line terminal in the Metro Rail 
station at 7th and Flower streets. Work on the underground station by the RTD 
is reported to be a year behind schedule. 
</P>
<P>
* On the south end, work on the three-mile loop through Long Beach -- and the 
last four of the route's 22 stations -- will not be completed until fall. So 
the line will temporarily end at Anaheim Street, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
And there are still some serious problems to be ironed out between the 
commission and the RTD over who will be in charge of both passenger security 
and fighting the war against graffiti, once the trains start running. Each 
agency claims it is better suited for those tasks. 
</P>
<P>
While the commission has been building the rail line, it has handled security. 
The RTD is scheduled to take over the Blue Line in May, when it will begin 
full-scale operational tests. However, it has not been decided whether the RTD 
will police the line with its own forces or will have help from the commission. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Line runs through some of the poorest neighborhoods in the city, 
crossing through turf claimed by drug-dealing gangs. Because of this, officials 
from both agencies agree that special efforts are needed to keep the line 
graffiti-free and safe for the thousands of passengers they hope to attract. 
</P>
<P>
Problems with spray-can-wielding vandals began even before the cement had dried 
on many of the stations along the route through South-Central Los Angeles. And, 
officials said, thieves were stealing construction materials and doing an 
estimated $350,000 damage. 
</P>
<P>
"Security is a big problem," said Ed McSpedon of the Rail Construct Corp., the 
commission subsidiary in charge of construction. The commission has budgeted $1 
million for graffiti control and contracted with the Los Angeles County sheriff 
to police the right of way. It wants the sheriff to continue as the primary law 
enforcement agency after trains start rolling, McSpedon said. 
</P>
<P>
The commission hired crews to clean off the gang marks, stepped up law 
enforcement and adopted the successful anti-graffiti policies used by the New 
York and Washington transit systems. In those cities, no trains are allowed to 
run with any graffiti on the cars. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to leave no doubt in the public's mind about their security and safety 
on this system," McSpedon said. 
</P>
<P>
RTD officials echo the same thoughts, but they say they need no help to keep 
the situation under control. The district is beefing up its 69-member transit 
police force to take over security. RTD officials dividing the authority with 
the sheriff would only cause problems. 
</P>
<P>
"We simply cannot expect to achieve a cost-effective, on-time, safe and 
reliable start if we continue to debate questions of basic approach," RTD 
Executive Director Alan Pegg said, referring to the dispute. Pegg said security 
is "an essential element of the operational phase," and he wants no 
interference from the commission. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from both of the big transit agencies say the trains will run as 
scheduled, and the security of the passengers will be assured. They do not say 
how they intend to resolve their differences. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, contractors are putting the finishing touches on the rail system, 
hooking up the automatic signals, testing the crossing gates at 26 
intersections. The RTD has hired half of the 220 managers, operators and 
maintenance experts needed to run the Blue Line and is training them for the 
May takeover. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Line trains will run along the Southern Pacific Railroad right-of-way 
north out of Long Beach across the Los Angeles River to Willowbrook Avenue. The 
tracks follow Willowbrook through Compton and Watts, then bend north to 
Washington Boulevard and follow that thoroughfare downtown to Flower Street. 
The line runs along the center of Flower Street and goes underground at 12th 
Street, tunneling into the 7th and Flower Street station. 
</P>
<P>
The 22 open-air stations along the fenced route have raised platforms to allow 
passengers to step directly onto the trains. There are no gates blocking 
platform access, nor will there be any ticket or station agents. Everything 
will be handled automatically, officials explained. Each station will have fare 
vending machines and money changers. 
</P>
<P>
Security will be provided by remote TV cameras, call boxes and roving police 
patrols. Undercover officers will ride the trains, McSpedon said. Passengers 
will be checked randomly to see if they have purchased fare tickets or have 
valid passes.

A RIGHT TO SEE THE SEA?; 
</P>
<P>
RESIDENTS UP AND DOWN THE COAST ARE SCRAMBLING TO KEEP THEIR OCEAN VIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Whenever the clatter and mess of development around their Del Mar home preyed 
on their nerves, Brett and Linda Castile could always look toward the one view 
that remained uncluttered by the hand of man -- that of the sea. 
</P>
<P>
A half block from the ocean, their home is within easy earshot of the big 
breakers that pound the North County shore on gray winter days. At sunset, the 
couple often would share a bottle of wine as they gazed off their back porch 
toward the peaceful blue-gray expanse. 
</P>
<P>
Today, that peace is gone, swallowed up by the condominiums being built by 
their neighbor and ex-friend, who refuses to alter the project that now 
eclipses the couple's cherished ocean view. 
</P>
<P>
But the Castiles are fighting back. They have hired a lawyer and made telephone 
calls to galvanize neighbors in an effort to take their cause before the city. 
</P>
<P>
Call it a fight for the right to see the sea. The dispute signals a growing 
trend up and down Southern California's overpopulated coast -- one that has 
prompted homeowners, lawyers and city officials to begin asking similar 
questions: 
</P>
<P>
"Just how much is a view of the sea worth to coastal dwellers?" "How hard will 
people fight to keep their ocean vista?" "And how can the government ensure 
that a room with a view stays that way forever?" 
</P>
<P>
Steve Scola was everybody's friend when he bought the property next door to the 
Castile's 11th Street home four years ago. He doted on the couple's four 
children, sent them birthday cards, gave them presents. 
</P>
<P>
But most important of all, he promised that no development of his property 
would ever block the couple's view of the ocean, Linda Castile said. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he was going to preserve our view of the sea at any cost," she 
recalled. "And we believed him. We had no reason not to." 
</P>
<P>
Now workmen are putting the finishing touches on the third of four condominiums 
Scola is building on the property -- structures that dwarf the Castile's 
two-story home, casting long shadows in the middle of the afternoon and 
blocking more than 90% of their ocean vista. 
</P>
<P>
As both their sunny solitude and the resale value of their home diminish with 
the pounding of each nail at the adjacent condos, Scola has told the couple, 
they said, that there is nothing he can do -- the project is three-fourths 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday night, the Del Mar City Council will hold a special administrative 
hearing in an attempt to reconcile the neighbors' differences. The Castiles 
claim that Scola's condominium project exceeds the city's height and bulk 
limitations, although they acknowledge that they never got involved in the 
process when the city first was reviewing Scola's plans. 
</P>
<P>
As Del Mar tries to resolve one view problem, the Solana Beach City Council 
also will meet Monday night to consider what city officials there call a major 
view ordinance proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The issue has arisen repeatedly since Solana Beach incorporated in 1986, said 
city planning director Steve Apple. So this fall, the City Council appointed a 
citizens zoning committee to explore ways to limit the squabbles that arise as 
people pack in larger and larger homes along the coast. 
</P>
<P>
"In Solana Beach, there has been no legal mechanism to protect private views," 
he said. "Our policy has been to encourage neighbors to work it out among 
themselves. But we're going to reach a point very soon when that's just not 
going to be good enough." 
</P>
<P>
The city is considering an ordinance to establish a three-member review panel 
that would make binding decisions in otherwise unsolvable view disputes, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a growing problem in affluent cities all along the Southern California 
coast," Apple said. "When we did our homework, we found that there were already 
enough models to follow -- existing view ordinances in Los Angeles-area cities 
such as Palos Verdes, Buena Ventura and other places along the coast." 
</P>
<P>
Such measures are applauded by coastal North County homeowners like Walt 
Baldwin, who sees his ocean vista not only as money in the bank but as an 
aesthetic treasure, the great Pacific pacifier. 
</P>
<P>
Baldwin, a Del Mar neighbor of the Castiles who surfs daily, has resisted many 
efforts to encroach on his ocean view. 
</P>
<P>
"One wall begets another wall begets another wall -- and we've got to put a 
stop to it somewhere," he said. "Having an ocean view has been a great focus 
point for my life, being able to say 'I'm on this map, on this coast.' 
</P>
<P>
"It's important for water-oriented people to at least have a glimpse of the 
sea. There's nothing more powerful than watching a wave break and see dolphins 
and other wildlife just beneath the surface. 
</P>
<P>
"The sheer power of that gives my life balance. And every person who comes to 
this town does so, I think, just to see that view." 
</P>
<P>
That's why, Baldwin said, the threat of losing a view will move people to all 
sorts of protracted measures. 
</P>
<P>
"People will muster just about every effort they have to protect their views," 
he said. "It's an emotional issue, as opposed to being a logical issue." 
</P>
<P>
It's a financial issue as well. 
</P>
<P>
The greater the ocean view, realtors say, the greater the cash value of the 
home. It just depends on the location of the home, the health of the housing 
market and the sheer scope of the view. 
</P>
<P>
"But it doesn't have to be a panoramic view to increase the value of the 
house," said Bill Smalley, a realtor with Grubb &amp; Ellis in Del Mar. "If you 
take two pretty similar properties, one with a view and one without, the 
difference could be as much as $100,000." 
</P>
<P>
The fights over views have proven to be a financial windfall for lawyers as 
well. Leo Wilson, the attorney representing the Castiles, handled a half-dozen 
such cases last year and considered more. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't want to make my living solely on this type of work, but I imagine 
you could," he said. "View certainly plays a role in a lot of homeowner 
disputes." 
</P>
<P>
Of all North County cities, insiders say, Del Mar has quite possibly been most 
distracted by the issue of view disputes. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, newer custom-made homes have blocked out the views of many 
less-expansive beach and hillside cottages built after the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of fairly affluent people have moved in and built elaborate homes, 
sealing off the smaller homes owned by people who have lived here a long time," 
said Arlene Carsten, a former mayor of Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
"The longtime residents have made a lot of noise because they want the 
community to stay the way it was." 
</P>
<P>
But buildings haven't been the only things to block expensive views. In 1984, 
while running for a City Council seat, Lewis Hopkins learned firsthand just how 
many Del Mar residents were miffed by their neighbor's trees and shrubbery 
blocking their view of the sea. 
</P>
<P>
"I went door-to-door to chat with people and find out what their concerns 
were," recalled the retired rear admiral who also served as Del Mar mayor. 
"And, strange as it may seem, the thing they complained about most was the 
vegetation that grew up over the years to block their view. A lot of people 
were hopping mad about it." 
</P>
<P>
Hopkins made vegetation blockage a primary issue after he won his seat on the 
council. He and other council members established a Vegetation View Blockage 
Committee that studied view ordinances in the upscale communities of Sausalito, 
Tiburon, Belvedere and El Cerrito in the San Francisco Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
The committee proposed that the city form a vegetation control board that would 
have the power to order pruning of any greenery that substantially blocked or 
obstructed scenic views. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council never passed the measure, however, instead adopting a 
resolution encouraging residents to resolve vegetation view blockage disputes 
through a city-contracted mediator, with the city footing some of the cost. 
</P>
<P>
Pat JaCoby, former member of the now-defunct committee, said she always liked 
the ordinances in some Northern California coastal cities that preclude foliage 
and building projects from blocking a homeowner's morning or afternoon sun. 
</P>
<P>
"It's eventually going to come to that," she said. "If we continue to pack the 
coastline, allowing people to build one house on top of another, we're just 
going to have to be more guarded about our views -- the things we bought the 
home for in the first place." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, the only solution to a view dispute is to have one of the neighbors 
move away -- as in the case of two actors from Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
The long-running battle was set off by several trees on property owned by 
Navarre Perry that blocked the view of Don Kennedy, a neighbor who lived 
directly up the hill. No matter what Kennedy tried, Perry refused to cut or 
trim his trees. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things those trees did was offer me some privacy from the houses 
above me," said Perry, a lawyer-turned-actor. 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted a 180-degree ocean view. But who has the greatest right to see the 
ocean, the guy highest on the hill so nobody else below him has the right to 
build or grow things? If that's the case, pretty soon you're going to have a 
pretty nice desert around here." 
</P>
<P>
And besides, Perry said, there are beautiful vistas other than an ocean view. 
"There's the rustic quality of trees and winding roads that's as nice as any 
ocean waves," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The two took each other to court, and Perry was awarded $89 after Kennedy cut 
away several tree branches with a power saw. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, however, Perry sold his home to move closer to San Diego and now has 
what he describes as a gorgeous view overlooking rugged canyons near Balboa 
Park. But nobody is happier about the move than Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, three months after Perry's departure, a storm blew down the most 
obtrusive tree. And his new, more cooperative neighbor did the rest, removing 
the others, Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
"Every morning when I get up and enjoy my ocean view, I take a deep breath and 
say 'Gee, I'm glad Navarre Perry moved!' " 
</P>
<P>
Del Mar officials maintain that, despite the death of the tree-pruning 
proposal, the city still fiercely protects a homeowner's right to what the city 
calls his "primary scenic view corridor." 
</P>
<P>
"We can't always protect 180-degree ocean views, but people get their day in 
court in Del Mar," said James Sandoval, city planning director. "Before any 
building project is approved, the city's design review board meets with a 
particular eye toward view concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"Many nights, they go into the wee hours of the next morning just to make sure 
that neighbors around a project are satisfied with what's going to be built 
around them." 
</P>
<P>
Sandoval said several North County cities, including Solana Beach and 
Encinitas, have examined the way Del Mar considers view blockage in the 
building permit approval process. The board reviews plans if notified by 
neighbors of the proposed project. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an important step along the way to get a building permit approved," he 
said. "Because, if things such as primary views aren't protected, city planning 
becomes more like Russian roulette." 
</P>
<P>
But the design review board process didn't help Brett and Linda Castile. 
</P>
<P>
Their trust in their neighbor persuaded them to bypass the design review 
board's hearing into Steve Scola's condominium project -- after being assured 
by him that their presence wasn't necessary, Linda Castile said. 
</P>
<P>
She said they also didn't require Scola to install story poles before the 
condominiums were begun -- as a preview to the projected height of the project. 
</P>
<P>
And now, rather than being clustered in the middle of the lot as he had 
promised, Scola has spread out his buildings, moving his neighbors to take 
action. 
</P>
<P>
Del Mar City Planner Sandoval said officials have been out to check Scola's 
project and have found it to be within city codes. 
</P>
<P>
Scola would not comment publicly on the dispute and has repeatedly refused to 
meet with the Castiles and a city-appointed mediator to work out a solution. 
</P>
<P>
That's fine with Linda Castile. On Monday night, she's going to do some talking 
-- telling the Del Mar City Council just how she feels. 
</P>
<P>
"My husband is an oceanographer and a surfer, and nothing riles him, not even 
when he has to go to Washington to talk before a bunch of bureaucratic paper 
pushers," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Until this."

FARRAKHAN SAYS U.S. SHOULD VIEW NATION OF ISLAM AS FRIEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Andrea Ford, Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Minister Louis Farrakhan granted a rare one-on-one interview to Times staff 
writer Andrea Ford on Saturday. Farrakhan, controversial leader of the Nation 
of Islam, was in Los Angeles for a Friday night speech at the Los Angeles 
Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 In the interview, which was limited to 20 minutes, Farrakhan repeated 
assertions that the war on drugs is a disguised war on blacks by the 
government. He also said the Nation of Islam is dedicated to eliminating drugs 
and that the government should view the Nation of Islam as a friend, not an 
enemy. 
</P>
<P>
 Following is a partial transcript of the interview. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What did you hope to accomplish with this visit to Los Angeles, and did you 
accomplish it? 
</P>
<P>
A: Always our aim is to teach and guide our people to that which will give them 
a better life and a better grip on themselves that we might come into a 
stronger bond of unity. . . . I believe that last night, certainly a beginning 
was made. . . . The Crips and the Bloods were there and even though they find 
it difficult relating one to the other, it appeared they found ease in relating 
to me and to us. We might possibly serve as a link to bring together those 
factions in our community that up to this point have not been able to find the 
path to unity. 
</P>
<P>
Q: In your speech you said the government's war on drugs is a disguised war on 
the black community. Could you elaborate on that? 
</P>
<P>
A: We believe that the government . . . is frightened by the rise in population 
of our people. We believe (the government) sees in black people a useless 
population that is considered by sociologists a permanent underclass. And when 
you have something that is useless, you attempt to get rid of it, if you cannot 
make it serviceable. . . . And just as Mr. Bush used the war on drugs as a 
pretext to bomb and invade Panama . . . we believe that same scenario is being 
put in place to attack the black community. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Beyond unity, do you have a specific plan or proposal to try to cure some of 
the ills plaguing the African-American community, the gang warfare, the drug 
problem? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes, of course. One could not come to the black community today as a servant 
if one does not have some solution to these problems. Most of these that you 
see that are with me in the Nation are those that we retrieved from the 
streets, from prisons, from a very low life . . . and we have by God's grace 
reformed these men and women, taken them from the old life style and given them 
a life style that is in harmony (with) the prophets of God. So if we can do it 
for the few, that is a sign that we can do it for the many if we are given a 
chance. When they are trying to find a cure for something, they measure what 
(the medicine does) with that small sampling, then they spread the sampling, 
then they get federal approval and give the medicine to all that suffer from 
that disease. I would hope that ultimately the government would see the Nation 
of Islam, not as the enemy, but the Nation of Islam as a friend. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do you believe the perception of you as perhaps anti-Jewish decreases your 
effectiveness in spreading your message to a wider audience of Americans? 
</P>
<P>
A: No, not at all. It has increased it. In fact, in 1985, when I came to Los 
Angeles, if it had not been for the Jewish community making the kind of issue 
that they made of my presence, we might not have filled the Forum. And 19,000 
people came to the Forum to see and hear this man who had the Jewish community 
so upset. Jews have never been upset over any black person. They usually have 
great control over black people. But here's one they don't control, and they 
have not yet found the mechanism to destroy what they can't control. And so it 
causes them great consternation. However, as I said last night, I am not 
anti-Semitic, nor am I anti-Jewish. 
</P>
<P>
Q: In your speech you described the black community and Los Angeles 
specifically as being on the brink of eruption. What do you mean? 
</P>
<P>
A: This is not just in Los Angeles. All over the country, police killings of 
black people are on the increase. And when a human being's life is taken, the 
law of justice says that loss of life must be justified. . . . Now millions of 
lives of black people have been lost and there has been no redress for that 
grievance. So something is building in the breasts of black folk and if wise 
measures are not taken at this juncture, this could explode in a volcanic 
eruption. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is Louis Farrakhan being irresponsible, as some say, by telling people they 
have every right to erupt? Are you giving license to rage? 
</P>
<P>
A: I cannot give license to rage. It is injustice that gives license to rage. 
Since I did not commit the crimes that have the black community enraged, then 
it is not I who gives license to the rage. . . . The people don't need a leader 
to direct their rage, they know who they are enraged against.

DISTRICT DICTATORS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In your article on the three proposed dump sites in North San Diego County 
("County Urged to Buy 3 New Landfill Sites," Jan. 25), you erroneously refer to 
a decision by the County Board of Supervisors on acceptance of a dump site. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the only member of the Board of Supervisors who will vote on the 
sites is Supervisor John MacDonald. 
</P>
<P>
We have already been told that the other board members will go along with his 
decision, since it is his district. 
</P>
<P>
Since this is the case, perhaps having a board of five members is an antiquated 
idea. With each member making the decisions for his or her own district, 
eliminate the board and install members as district dictators. 
</P>
<P>
It would save a bundle of money, and eliminate the facade of a board.

LESSONS WELL TAUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are those who walk among us whose presence changes the shape and sound of 
things. There are those who walk among us whose belief in truth and beauty 
makes all that is good true, and all that is true beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Lucas, the last full blood of the Kwaaymii tribe, walked among us for 86 
years. He was such a man. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Lucas believed in his people, but not to the exclusion of others. Tom Lucas 
met life with courage, but knew the value of fear. Tom Lucas knew hate and 
injustice, but maintained his power to love. To know such a man is to recognize 
the promise and the possibility in all of us. 
</P>
<P>
Winter now lives in the Laguna Mountains. Snow blankets the ground where Tom's 
circle is complete. He has taught us good lessons and he has taught them well. 
Let them grow, like the sage that will come in the spring, rich with insight 
and with healing for our often troubled times.

OFF-ROADERS DON'T BELONG IN ANZA-BORREGO DESERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Next month, when the state's Off-Highway Motor Vehicle Recreation commissioners 
come to town, they will be touring the latest additions to the Ocotillo Wells 
Off-Road Vehicle Park in eastern San Diego County. Using off-road vehicle 
registration fees, the state has recently more than doubled the size of the 
park, adding 20,000 acres to the existing 14,000. 
</P>
<P>
But that doesn't satisfy off-roaders. They also want access to Anza-Borrego 
Desert State Park next door, and the commissioners will be considering such a 
proposal at their March meeting in Borrego Springs. If approved, it would have 
to be ratified by the state Parks and Recreation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, groups of four to 20 riders of unlicensed vehicles would be 
allowed on 75 miles of roads in the eastern part of the park, although they 
would still be banned on the other 425 miles of Anza-Borrego roads. A 
designated member of each group would have to complete a desert-awareness 
program and each rider would have to agree in writing to stay on trails or pay 
a $250 fine. Group leaders would wear bright orange vests to make them easier 
for rangers to spot, and two more rangers would be hired with off-roaders' 
registration fees. 
</P>
<P>
Although the proposal is relatively modest, the encroachment on the fragile 
desert park should not be allowed. 
</P>
<P>
Over and over again, off-roaders have demonstrated that dirt bikes and 
all-terrain vehicles are more for sport than travel. People buy them primarily 
for the thrill of conquering tough terrain. The temptation to ignore the rules 
and stray from designated paths proves too great for too many. That's why 
there's Ocotillo Wells. 
</P>
<P>
Anza-Borrego has a different purpose. The 426,000 acres of parkland were set 
aside to preserve and protect an area of outstanding natural beauty. People go 
to Anza-Borrego to camp or hike or explore, and to enjoy the exquisite desert 
quiet -- activities incompatible with off-road vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
The vehicles were banned from the park in 1987 because of the damage they were 
causing to plant and animal life and to archeologically sensitive sites when 
riders went off the trail. That damage heals slowly, if ever, in the desert. 
</P>
<P>
Licensed four-wheel-drive vehicles and motorcycles are allowed on the park 
roads -- often just dirt trails -- and, admittedly, they, too, can cause damage 
if taken off road. But rangers say that rarely happens. Drivers tend to use 
them for transportation, not play. 
</P>
<P>
The federal Bureau of Land Management, which has a fairly liberal policy on 
off-road vehicles -- allowing casual use in many areas and competitive use on 
500,000 acres in California -- knows about the damage off-roaders can cause and 
how much it costs to police them. The bureau has had to more than double the 
number of its rangers, in large part because of the demands of policing 
off-roaders. 
</P>
<P>
And recently, the bureau banned four races in the California desert because of 
the damage caused during the Barstow-to-Las Vegas race and the amount of staff 
it took to police the races and protect the endangered desert tortoise. 
</P>
<P>
Off-roaders do not need Anza-Borrego. They have approximately 1 million acres 
of BLM and U.S. Forest Service land and 85,000 acres of state land, including 
the 34,000 acres at Ocotillo Wells to ride in. And Anza-Borrego and its 800,000 
visitors each year don't need off-roaders.

HERMOSA QUICK TO LEVY PARKING FINES, SLOW TO PAY COUNTY, AUDIT SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAWN HUBLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Hermosa Beach, notorious for its aggressive parking enforcement, 
has for six years underestimated the county's share of parking ticket revenues 
and owes the county more than $100,000, a recent audit shows. 
</P>
<P>
Marion Romeis, principal accountant-auditor at the Los Angeles County 
auditor-controller's office, said Friday that of the 16 cities audited during 
the three-month review, Hermosa Beach was the most in arrears. 
</P>
<P>
With a debt of $104,305, she said, "Hermosa was the biggest chunk" of the 
$162,806 owed the county overall. 
</P>
<P>
But City Manager Kevin Northcraft said the city, which nets about $2.5 million 
a year in revenue from parking tickets, will not pay the money until after the 
county supplies supporting documentation of its findings and the audit is 
reviewed by the city attorney. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is the county's $3-a-ticket share of each $18 parking citation paid in 
Hermosa Beach. The money goes into two construction funds used to build and 
refurbish courthouses and other county facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Most of that money, Northcraft said, is automatically channeled to the county 
by the city clerk, who collects fines that are paid on time. But when violators 
send the money for old, overdue tickets to a third party such as the Department 
of Motor Vehicles, the city isn't always sure, when the money is forwarded, 
whether the county's cut has been taken out, Northcraft said. 
</P>
<P>
Romeis said that the confusion has been common in other cities but that it has 
been particularly pronounced in Hermosa Beach, which in recent years has 
neglected to forward the county's share of money forwarded from the DMV. 
</P>
<P>
Bellflower, the city with the second-largest debt, owes $24,993, she said. 
Lawndale came in third, owing $22,386, followed by Gardena ($4,867), Compton 
($4,026), Glendora ($1,341) and Lakewood ($888). 
</P>
<P>
Bell Gardens, Hawaiian Gardens, Huntington Park, Los Angeles and Torrance were 
found to be current, Romeis said, while four other cities had overpaid. 
</P>
<P>
The county, she said, owes Southgate $28,647, Carson $21,639, Covina $11,319 
and Vernon $2,301.

AFTER FALSE START, RELIGIOUS COALITION RENEWS MINISTRY TO AIDS PATIENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A year ago this month, a procession of robed clergy from a dozen Valley 
congregations, 200 worshipers and a gospel choir gathered in a joyous 
celebration of faith at Temple Beth Hillel in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
The gathering was more than a gesture of interfaith goodwill. The worshipers 
were people with AIDS, their families and friends. The congregation also 
included members of churches and temples who wanted to show their support. 
</P>
<P>
The colorful service trumpeted the formation of the Valley Interfaith AIDS 
Coalition, which planned to hold monthly AIDS worship services and act as a 
local clearinghouse for information and assistance on acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
But the group had trouble sustaining that first outpouring of support. 
Subsequent services were shorter, smaller gatherings. Then, faced with funding 
and staff limitations, the coalition discontinued the services for the summer. 
In the fall, the services did not resume. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the coalition's leaders say they have regained lost momentum, citing a 
pressing need to provide spiritual help and social services to Valley residents 
affected by AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
In January they revived the AIDS services, scheduling them for the third Sunday 
of each month at St. Matthew's Lutheran Church in North Hollywood. The group 
prepared to poll Valley churches and synagogues about pooling resources to help 
people with AIDS and their loved ones. It also began planning an AIDS 
information forum in March. 
</P>
<P>
"They've been re-energized," said Barry Smedberg, executive director of the San 
Fernando Valley Interfaith Council. The AIDS coalition operates under the 
auspices of the council, which represents about 250 Valley congregations. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Smedberg said the coalition faces serious obstacles. AIDS activists must 
compete against other groups that want religious leaders' attention on a 
variety of social issues, ranging from homelessness to malathion spraying. For 
many clergy members, AIDS is an issue they would rather ignore. 
</P>
<P>
"Some have not been able to differentiate the AIDS problem from homosexuality, 
which some churches have a difficult time embracing," Smedberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Lutheran Social Services invited clergy members from 48 San 
Fernando Valley Lutheran churches to attend a seminar on helping congregants 
cope with AIDS. Just one minister showed up, recalled Smedberg, who was then 
the agency's area director. 
</P>
<P>
Although attendance might be higher today, he said, "there's a lot of apathy 
out there on this issue." 
</P>
<P>
The reluctance of Valley clergy to become involved with AIDS issues mirrors a 
nationwide trend, said Keith Wintermute, a Presbyterian minister in Oxnard who 
produced a documentary film last year called "AIDS and the Church's Role." 
</P>
<P>
"This is a disease that pushes people to the brink of eternity," he said. "They 
face the fundamental issues of faith, and their families desperately need the 
voice of the pastor or rabbi or priest. The churches are kind of sitting back 
and yawning. It's staggering." 
</P>
<P>
The revived Valley Interfaith AIDS Coalition hopes to fill this void by 
providing spiritual and social programs that are more readily available 
elsewhere in the city. 
</P>
<P>
"Just because we're on the other side of the hill doesn't mean we don't have 
the same problems as the rest of Los Angeles," said Marsha Van Valkenburg, a 
Northridge resident who chairs the coalition. 
</P>
<P>
As of Dec. 31, 8,576 cases of AIDS had been reported in the county since 1981, 
with 5,686 resulting in death, according to the Los Angeles County Department 
of Health Services. For the same period, 386 of the reported AIDS cases, or 
about 5%, were in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Although some religious leaders in other parts of Los Angeles have taken a more 
active role, getting clergy to address AIDS has been difficult. "It's not as 
'safe' as giving food and clothing to the homeless," said the Rev. Ginny 
Wagener, a coalition member who is pastor at St. Matthew's Lutheran Church in 
North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
When AIDS patients or family members seek spiritual comfort, local hospitals 
often turn first to the predominantly gay Metropolitan Community Church in the 
Valley.

"Our pastor was constantly being called because he was the only one thought to 
be sympathetic," said Sean Kinney, a coalition member and a founder of 
Metropolitan's AIDS ministry. Kinney hopes the coalition can spread some of the 
work around. 
</P>
<P>
The group's new questionnaire will try to find clergy from other Valley 
congregations who are willing to assist hospitals in AIDS cases. "The coalition 
had a specific interest to me because our church was almost tapped out," Kinney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The group also wants to help people with AIDS connect with local social 
services, such as a new Meals on Wheels program that will deliver low-cost food 
to homebound people who are younger than 60. Traditionally, such meals have 
been provided only to senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Alma Patotzka, volunteer director of the meal program, which is sponsored by 
the interfaith council, said her problem is getting the word out to Valley 
residents with AIDS or other serious illnesses. "I have the program, I have the 
volunteers, but I don't have the clients," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The AIDS coalition dates back to a directive given two years ago to Father Ed 
Allen, rector at St. Andrew and St. Charles Episcopal Church in Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"I had been approached by one of our bishops and asked to set up a center for 
AIDS information for the Episcopal churches in the Valley," he recalled. "We 
spent a year avoiding the issue as much as anything. As we learned more about 
it, we realized it was too big an issue for one denomination to handle." 
</P>
<P>
A committee at Allen's church sent letters to about 300 religious leaders in 
the Valley, asking them to attend a meeting about AIDS assistance. Six 
prominent clergy members from various faiths signed the letter. 
</P>
<P>
About two dozen people representing 18 congregations attended the first 
meeting, said Van Valkenburg. "We decided the first priority was to let the 
Valley know we were here," she said. "The best way to do that was by having a 
service." 
</P>
<P>
"It was very powerful," recalled Rabbi Steven Jacobs of the New Reform 
Congregation of Woodland Hills. "It was just a very moving experience. We used 
dancing, singing and prayer. It was a joyous experience." 
</P>
<P>
Along with the monthly AIDS worship services, the coalition has tried to 
educate religious leaders about the disease. 
</P>
<P>
"Clergy people are first and foremost human beings, with the same fears and 
trepidations that everyone else has regarding sexuality and mortality," said 
Van Valkenburg. "We felt that if we could educate the clergy, we would be 
encouraged to come into their congregations to educate the people." 
</P>
<P>
The task is difficult because some religious leaders associate AIDS with sinful 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people like to think of it as a punishment for being a gay person," said 
Jacobs. "Nothing could be further from the truth. When a person is suffering or 
dying, you don't sit in judgment. You extend compassion." 
</P>
<P>
Joe McGowan, associate pastor at St. Stephen Presbyterian Church in Chatsworth, 
said the problem is not unique to the Valley. Before assuming his post in 
September, McGowan served on a New Orleans AIDS task force that also had 
trouble attracting volunteers from the clergy. 
</P>
<P>
"The church has done very little in this area," he said. "I'm talking about all 
faiths." 
</P>
<P>
McGowan said AIDS worship services are important because people affected by the 
disease face religious turning points. "There are some who go through great 
spiritual tension at this time and some go through spiritual experiences in 
re-establishing their faith in God," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the local AIDS worship services are "also tailored to the care-givers, 
the nurses and doctors, the people who deal with this on a regular basis. The 
services are very positive. They stress God's love and grace and God's healing 
power. They're not designed to tell these people they've done wrong and if they 
turn their lives around, they'll get well." 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Valley Interfaith AIDS Coalition became involved for a variety 
of reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Van Valkenburg joined the group partly because she observed the harassment of 
gay co-workers. "I've always been very outspoken against prejudice of any 
kind," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Wagener had worked on AIDS projects in San Francisco and Omaha. "One thing I've 
found is people who have AIDS are life-affirming, rather than being preoccupied 
with death and dying," she said. "That's been the biggest surprise to me, the 
biggest blessing I've received from the people who have AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not so much that we professionals in faith are bestowing spirituality on 
people with AIDS. Often it's the other way around." 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, Kinney helped found an AIDS ministry at his North Hollywood 
church. "Even though we were a gay and lesbian organization, we didn't have a 
response," he said. "There was mass denial within our own people about what was 
going on." 
</P>
<P>
More recently, Kinney himself has tested positive for exposure to the AIDS 
virus. "It challenges every spiritual foundation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A recent addition to the coalition is a North Hollywood resident who has 
attended a mainstream church in Northridge for many years. The coalition 
member, who asked that his name not be used, said his family and co-workers 
know he is gay, but not his fellow worshipers. 
</P>
<P>
"The church is the only place I'm not 'out,' " he said. "My discomfort is my 
own, not anything they're inflicting." 
</P>
<P>
He said he joined the interfaith coalition because "it's important for me to 
support other people who are affected. Here at the Valley Interfaith AIDS 
Coalition, I found an ongoing, affirming ministry."

CLASS IS DISMISSED, BUT THE 'GRANDE DAME' IS NOT FINISHED TEACHING 
</P>

An ambulance raced to the scene of an accident on Interstate 5 south of 
Bakersfield. The driver, it seemed, had dozed off at the wheel and hit a guard 
rail. When the paramedic peered into the car and saw the uninjured driver, a 
flash of recognition came across his face. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't suppose you remember me," the paramedic told Gladys Waddingham, "but I 
used to be in your Spanish class at Inglewood High School." 
</P>
<P>
Another former student had just encountered Inglewood's most acclaimed former 
teacher. 
</P>
<P>
"I run into students in bizarre situations all the time," the 89-year-old 
Waddingham said recently. "I've had 10,000 students in my classes over 45 
years. Some of them are now bald-headed." 
</P>
<P>
Waddingham's teaching career began in 1922 and lasted so long that she now has 
former students who are teachers and have former students of their own. 
</P>
<P>
Waddingham retired in 1967 but in a sense she has never given up teaching. 
Today, she is the city's unofficial historian with a schedule busier than many 
who are generations younger. As one longtime friend and admirer, Brenda 
Conyers, put it, "She does more before breakfast than the rest of us do all day 
long." 
</P>
<P>
An early riser, Waddingham fills her days with meetings for the Historical 
Society of Centinela Valley, Inglewood's 100-year-old First Presbyterian Church 
and the never-ending stream of city advisory committees that inevitably add 
Waddingham's name to the list of members. 
</P>
<P>
"We need 100 more Gladyses," Inglewood Councilman Jose Fernandez said, 
extolling her commitment to the city. 
</P>
<P>
Her home has a wall full of plaques that she and her late husband, Francis, who 
was also active in community organizations, received over the years. 
Politicians love to invoke her name in speeches, and during election time they 
vie for publicity photographs with Waddingham. When local officials can't 
answer an arcane question about the city's past, they refer the questioner to 
Waddingham. 
</P>
<P>
A man from Michigan called her recently to find out where an electronics school 
that once operated in Inglewood had relocated. She got another call from an 
Oregon man trying to track down anyone who had known his mother, a city 
resident in the late 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
"She's the grande dame of the Centinela Valley," said the Rev. Daniel H. 
Newhall, pastor of the First Presbyterian Church for the last 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
Keeping the past alive for future generations is Waddingham's obsession. 
</P>
<P>
She wrote a 95-year history of the First Presbyterian Church in 1985 and 
updated it last year to honor the church's centennial celebration. She spends 
much of her time sorting through boxes of slides and other artifacts and 
shipping them to universities and historical societies. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to do it now because it would be a shame if all of it went to waste," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Born on a farm near Scottville, Mich., in 1900, Waddingham lived with her 
family in Oregon and San Diego before moving to Los Angeles to attend 
Occidental College in 1916. She graduated four years later as the class 
valedictorian and immediately began teaching Spanish in a 44-student high 
school in Las Vegas. Two years later, she took an $1,800-a-year job in 
Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
As the city has been transformed from an agricultural community to a Los 
Angeles suburb and from an all-white enclave to a predominantly minority city, 
Waddingham has worked to keep Inglewood aware of its historical roots. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1970s, when residents proposed renaming Monroe Junior High School after 
Martin Luther King Jr., she wrote biographies of Judge Albert Monroe and 12 
other city fathers to explain their accomplishments to current residents. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm against renaming the schools," she said recently. "But I can understand 
new people moving in and not knowing about the city's past." 
</P>
<P>
The school board later decided not to rename Monroe or any of the other schools 
named after Inglewood's founders, many of whom were Waddingham's 
contemporaries. 
</P>
<P>
Although many of Waddingham's friends have moved away, she has become an 
Inglewood booster. One of her longtime crusades has been recruiting younger 
members to the historical society. Another is letting outsiders know that 
Inglewood has a rich history that is continuing every day. 
</P>
<P>
"Not everything is wonderful about Inglewood," Waddingham said, "but everything 
is not wonderful in any town." 
</P>
<P>
She has a longtime friend who used to live in Inglewood who proves her point. 
</P>
<P>
"She will not come over here because she thinks it's dangerous," Waddingham 
said with a hint of annoyance in her voice. "But she's had troubles with kids 
breaking the (lights) in her apartment house. The neighborhood kids around here 
don't bother me at all."

BUSINESS IS BOOMING FOR MALL BUILDERS; 
</P>
<P>
REDEVELOPMENT: EXISTING SHOPPING CENTERS ARE BEING RECYCLED AND NEW ONES BUILT 
AS MORE AND MORE MERCHANTS COMPETE FOR RELATIVELY AFFLUENT SOUTH BAY SHOPPERS. 
</P>

How many new doughnut shops can a neighborhood support, anyhow? How many dry 
cleaners? Or fast food joints or convenience grocery stores or trendy eateries 
or clothing shops? Those are questions Donna Holick asks herself these days. 
</P>
<P>
"Redevelopment is fine if they get a little more creative," Holick said the 
other day as she stood inside her Harbor City store, the Kritter Korral Pet 
Shop. 
</P>
<P>
"It just seems like we're going to burn each other out." 
</P>
<P>
For six months now, Holick's business has been disrupted as construction crews 
have gone about the job of renovating and expanding the corner shopping center 
in Harbor City where she has leased space for the past six years. 
</P>
<P>
Work on the center, which started in October, 1988, is finally scheduled to be 
completed soon, and Holick hopes her life and business will return to normal. 
</P>
<P>
When that happens, though, Holick still won't be spared the sounds of 
construction work. 
</P>
<P>
Across the street from her Western Avenue store, a large sign advertises the 
soon-to-be "Harbor City Convenience Center." On an adjacent corner, another 
sign trumpets yet another planned shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
And not too far north on Western, at the intersection with Pacific Coast 
Highway, there is yet another sign. This one announces the construction of a 
McDonald's. "Here We Grow Again," the red sign with a smiling Ronald McDonald 
proclaims. 
</P>
<P>
So just how many new shops can the South Bay support? Apparently a lot, to hear 
local developers and commercial real estate brokers tell it. 
</P>
<P>
Barring an economic downturn, the recycling of existing shopping centers, and 
the building of new ones on what little undeveloped commercial property 
remains, is likely to continue at a brisk pace, they say. 
</P>
<P>
They cite as the reasons a relatively affluent population, as well as a 
scarcity of land and a number of older shopping centers that are either ready 
for the wrecking ball or a major face lift. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, developers have simply turned parking space into more lucrative 
shopping space; in other cases, such as The Terraces shopping center in Rancho 
Palos Verdes, they have completely reconfigured an existing site to make way 
for large-scale expansion. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like women's dresses," says South Bay developer Ron Florance. "Fashions 
change. The centers built 15, 20 or 25 years ago need to be freshened up, 
updated." 
</P>
<P>
Says Larry Lake, marketing director for Irvine-based Park Abrams Development 
Co., which is developing one of the sites across from Holick's store and 
remodeling a center on Pacific Coast Highway, just west of Crenshaw Boulevard: 
"If you can come up with a piece of property, you can usually find a retailer." 
</P>
<P>
Lake says Park Abrams, which has built 44 shopping centers in Southern 
California over the past seven years, operates under a simple credo: Pay top 
dollar for top corners. 
</P>
<P>
Within the past two weeks, bulldozers moved in on a former Sears service center 
on the corner of Crenshaw and Sepulveda boulevards in Torrance. The retailer 
relocated its service center operations to a larger building on Normandie 
Avenue. In place of the Sears building, a shopping center -- and a McDonald's 
-- will be built. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Cassick, a real estate representative for McDonald's, says the site was 
attractive to the company because of the high volume of traffic that passes 
through the intersection -- 80,000 vehicles a day, according to one local 
commercial real estate broker. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Cassick said the site's proximity to the sprawling Del Amo Fashion 
Square shopping center and other major retailers along Hawthorne Boulevard made 
the parcel desirable. 
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion, it is the No. 2 intersection in the city of Torrance," Cassick 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Others share Cassick's enthusiasm for Hawthorne Boulevard and its spillover 
effects on commercial properties within a reasonable distance. The brokerage 
company Grubb &amp; Ellis, for instance, has compiled statistics showing that 
within a five-mile radius of the intersection of Sepulveda and Hawthorne 
boulevards there will be an estimated 546,631 people, or 192,117 households, by 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
More than 60% of the estimated 509,720 people who now live in that radius have 
annual incomes of $35,000 or more, according to the company's figures. 
</P>
<P>
The retail area along Hawthorne Boulevard "happens to be a great, great trade 
area," says Steven Soboroff, a Santa Monica developer who teaches a UCLA 
extension class on shopping centers. 
</P>
<P>
"You can buy land (on Hawthorne) for $40 or $50 a square foot, the rents you 
(can) demand are $2.50 to $3 a square foot. The bottom line is the deal works. 
You can buy the land, build a building, rent it out and the investment works." 
</P>
<P>
The city of Torrance's own figures also illustrate just how robust its retail 
area is. Although figures that single out businesses on Hawthorne are not 
available, the city last fiscal year collected $24.7 million in sales tax 
revenues on taxable sales of $2.5 billion. The figures represent an increase of 
more than 12% from two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Despite those favorable economic conditions, the South Bay is not a guaranteed 
Shangri-La for developers. Even though several brokers say retail rents in the 
South Bay have been going up at about 15% a year, an increase comparable to 
Santa Monica, there is always the danger that a particular development won't 
take off. 
</P>
<P>
Cassick says that, because of the high cost of land, it is not uncommon for 
particular properties to go in and out of escrow several times before a 
developer finally comes along who feels he can make a go of it. In the case of 
the former Sears site at Sepulveda and Crenshaw, the original developer felt 
the profit margin was too slim and sold it to another developer, he said. 
</P>
<P>
If some developers find the going rough at times, so do existing tenants in 
shopping centers that are being renovated. The Kritter Korral's Holick says her 
business has declined about 20% to 25% since work began. Some longtime regular 
customers simply stopped shopping at her store because it was a hassle to 
maneuver through the construction activity. 
</P>
<P>
"It just got to the point where it was really hard to get in and out," Holick 
said. "It still is hard." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Guhr said the renovation of a center at Sepulveda Boulevard and 
Arlington Avenue, where he operated Geno's Pizza for more than 16 years, was a 
factor in his decision to close the business, although it wasn't the only one. 
</P>
<P>
When the supermarket next door closed in 1987 and the center was sold, Guhr 
said, foot traffic dropped and his business fell. 
</P>
<P>
Then, last year, renovation of the center began. Scaffolding hid his business 
from motorists. Parking was cut. The outdoor lights were shut off. Business 
declined further. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, he decided to shut down, leaving this message on his telephone 
answering machine: 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sorry, but we closed our business for good. We tried to go and keep it 
open as long as we could. But we saw ourselves forced to go ahead and close it. 
. . . We wish you all the best. Thank you and goodby."

2 KILLED IN INGLEWOOD CRASH; ALLEGED DRUNK DRIVER ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Two men were killed Saturday morning in Inglewood in a fiery four-car collision 
caused by a suspected drunk driver who walked away from the crash with only 
minor injuries, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Ignacio Becerra, 23, of Los Angeles, was booked by Inglewood police on charges 
of felony drunk driving and vehicular manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
He was being held at the Inglewood police station without bail, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The names of the two victims, a 61-year-old Inglewood man and a Riverside man 
also in his 60s, were not being released, pending notification of their 
families. 
</P>
<P>
The accident at 8:20 a.m. snarled traffic around Los Angeles International 
Airport for most of the morning while emergency crews worked to clear the 
wreckage at the intersection of Century and Crenshaw boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood Police Sgt. Thomas Farrell said the crash occurred when Becerra, who 
was traveling west on Century in a 1977 Ford LTD, slammed into a pickup. 
</P>
<P>
The truck, driven by the Inglewood victim, shot forward 300 feet and rear-ended 
a Datsun, Farrell said. Meanwhile, Becerra's car careened into the back end of 
an Isuzu, rupturing its gas tank and sparking a spectacular blaze that 
firefighters said was visible almost a mile away. 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood fire officials said the Riverside man in the Isuzu was knocked into 
the back seat by the collision and was unable to escape the flames that 
engulfed the car. 
</P>
<P>
The Inglewood man died of internal injuries en route to Daniel Freeman Memorial 
Hospital, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood Fire Capt. Dave Herbert said Becerra suffered only "a cut leg and a 
few bumps on his head." The driver of the Datsun was uninjured.

AGING HILLTOP CENTER NOW A TERRACED COMPLEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Tim Waters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The transformation of what was once known as the Harbor Heights shopping center 
in Rancho Palos Verdes shows just how extensive the recycling of commercial 
properties can sometimes be. 
</P>
<P>
Opened more than 30 years ago, the small, strip shopping center was the first 
major center on the peninsula side of Western Avenue. Tucked on top of a hill 
and hidden from motorists, it consisted of 10 tenants. 
</P>
<P>
In August, 1987, a Denver-based company, Wickliff Development Co., began 
transforming the aging center, carving out the hillside in front of the 
existing stores to make way for two additional tiers, each with rooftop 
parking. An estimated 155,000 cubic yards of earth were excavated from the 
site, most of which was hauled to a nearby undeveloped park, from where much of 
it originally had come. 
</P>
<P>
It was announced in September, 1987, that the project would be completed the 
following spring. It was actually completed about a year after that, and 
cosmetic work and leasing efforts are still under way. 
</P>
<P>
In June, 1988, Wickliff sold the center to Burton Properties Trust Inc., a U.S. 
subsidiary of The Burton Group PLC, a British conglomerate. In November, 1988, 
the company purchased Torrance's Old Towne Mall and is renovating it. 
</P>
<P>
The center's three tiers include about 185,000 square feet of retail space. The 
number of stores has been more than quadrupled. A multiscreen movie theater in 
space formerly occupied by a jewelry store opened last spring. 
</P>
<P>
According to Burton Properties, nearly 90% of the space at the center, now 
called The Terraces, is rented out. The company is confident the remaining 
25,000 square feet will be occupied by the time a grand opening is held in May. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Palos Verdes officials are hopeful the center will serve as a catalyst 
for other commercial redevelopment along Western Avenue -- redevelopment that 
already appears to be under way. 
</P>
<P>
"The area really has been upgraded in the past few years," said Laurie Jester, 
a city planner. "We have really seen a lot of new things going in there." 
</P>
<P>
George Krikorian, who owns the center's new theater, said he was attracted to 
the center because of its location and the absence of any other indoor theaters 
nearby. "The Terrace is the doorstep to San Pedro and the east side of the 
peninsula," he said. "It is somewhat of a pocketed community, geographically." 
</P>
<P>
Antonella Ouaddi, whose father, Joseph, has operated the Portofino Italian 
market and restaurant at the center for four years, said times were sometimes 
tough during the center's renovation. Business dropped, and the family had to 
pay for valet service for a year when the parking lot was overtaken by 
construction work. 
</P>
<P>
"We stuck it out because we are a family business," she said. "We kind of 
pulled together and tightened our belts." 
</P>
<P>
Now that the renovation is complete, business is starting to pick up again, she 
said. But her family is uncertain if the renovation will translate into a lot 
of new business. 
</P>
<P>
"We really haven't said, 'Wow, now it's booming.' " Tim Waters

Congressman Dana Rohrabacher is having a hard time selling his proposal to 
offer coastal communities a cut in future offshore oil royalties. 
</P>
<P>
Last month city leaders of Palos Verdes Estates sent him a letter stating that, 
royalties or no royalties, they would continue to oppose offshore oil drilling 
under any circumstances. And on Tuesday, the Rancho Palos Verdes City Council 
decided unanimously to mail him a similar message. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't think that money could compensate for the damage oil drilling could 
do," Rancho Palos Verdes City Councilwoman Jacki Bacharach said. "We didn't 
want him to think there was a scheme that could buy us off." 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher (R-Lomita) has asked the U.S. Department of the Interior to draft a 
measure that would require the federal government to share its royalties from 
new offshore oil and gas production with coastal cities affected by the 
drilling. 
</P>
<P>
He thinks the proposal could help Washington interest local communities in oil 
and gas development in the federal waters off California and other coastal 
states. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher wants to gauge support for the measure before deciding whether to 
introduce it in Congress. Though he received a letter in opposition last month 
from the city of Palos Verdes Estates -- and is about to receive another 
negative review from Rancho Palos Verdes -- Rohrabacher remains unfazed. 
</P>
<P>
Once voters realize that city budgets could be bolstered significantly by oil 
royalties, he said Friday, they may support offshore drilling. Elected 
officials, he added, should be open to debate on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"No one is talking about steamrolling local cities and forcing offshore oil 
development on anybody," Rohrabacher said, promising he will oppose offshore 
drilling in the Santa Monica Bay area if it is unacceptable to coastal 
communities. "But there is no reason to shut off debate about what the citizens 
of Southern California may or may not want to accept." 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher said his proposal needs more consideration. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now we are in the initial exploration," he said. "It could be a dry hole 
or it could be a gusher." George Hatch

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: CLUB OPENS TO FORGE FRIENDSHIPS BETWEEN JAPANESE AND 
AMERICAN FAMILIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
They are 6,000 miles from home, struggling to make themselves understood in a 
foreign language as they try to set up their homes, enroll their children in 
school, buy groceries and find their way around town. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese families who have flocked to the South Bay in recent years say 
their American hosts have been extremely kind, going out of their way to make 
them feel welcome. But they realized long ago that they need a place of their 
own to relax, share information and get to know one another. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Japanese Business Assn. staged a grand opening of the Family 
Club they have dreamed of for years, a place they hope will meet both their own 
social needs and their desire to thank the community that has welcomed them. 
</P>
<P>
Its setting on the upper floor of a small industrial building on the southern 
edge of Gardena is misleading, because association members want the Family Club 
to be a place removed from the traditional pressure of business. 
</P>
<P>
"We started to feel that we needed more, something closer to the community," 
said association Chairman Phil Shimbori, senior vice president of Kenwood USA 
Corp. "We wanted a place to have classes and seminars and meeting rooms, where 
we could invite the community to come visit with us." 
</P>
<P>
Located in the K. Ogawa &amp; Co. building at 1440 W. 178th St., the center is 
a small collection of rooms centered around a growing library of 
Japanese-language books. In addition to the library service, which will be 
available to anyone wanting to borrow books, the center plans to stage crafts 
classes, occasional get-acquainted sessions with prominent Japanese visitors -- 
such as a recent gathering to meet a leading Japanese cartoonist -- and 
cultural seminars. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be a YMCA outreach kind of program, where members of the (American) 
community can come by to meet members of the Japanese community," said Linda 
Moriwaki, a native Californian who has volunteered to help establish the Family 
Club. "It will also be a place where families first arriving, who don't 
understand what is going on, can come for help." 
</P>
<P>
One thing the association wants to avoid is any appearance of exclusivity, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't want the American public to think, 'Oh, there go the Japanese 
again, all gathering in one spot,' " she said. "This is really a sign that 
everything is opening up." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the dozens of community leaders invited to join in Tuesday's grand 
opening festivities said they welcome the effort. 
</P>
<P>
Persuading Americans to become active at the center "will require finding a 
common interest of some kind," Torrance City Councilman George Nakano said, 
"but you have to respect the effort that they're making." 
</P>
<P>
Gunkatsu Kano, Japan's deputy consul general in Los Angeles, said he believes 
the Family Club will help bridge the cultural gap between Japan and the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
"The host communities have been so generous," he said. "It is my hope that this 
Family Club will build deep friendships between Japanese and Americans." Janet 
Rae-Dupree

NEW LAWNDALE BUILDING RULES TO FAVOR CONDOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Lawndale City Council has tentatively approved building regulations 
designed to encourage the construction of condominiums rather than apartments. 
</P>
<P>
The regulations would give builders the option of putting condominiums on lots 
where the only alternative now is apartments or single-family dwellings and 
eliminate the requirement that condominiums only be built on lots of at least 
10,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
The 3-2 vote Thursday was taken after little discussion. Councilmen Larry 
Rudolph, Dan McKenzie and Harold Hofmann voted for the regulations, while Mayor 
Sarann Kruse and Councilwoman Carol Norman opposed them. The regulations will 
become law March 17 if the council approves them in a final vote Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Kruse and Norman criticized the proposal in previous meetings, saying it would 
increase density and parking problems. They suggested that voters be allowed to 
determine what the regulations should be. 
</P>
<P>
Rudolph has maintained that the changes would not increase density.

SCHOOL-BUS DRIVER FACES DRUNK-DRIVING COUNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A school-bus driver transporting Clairemont High School students was charged 
with drunk driving after his bus rear-ended a pickup truck in San Diego, 
injuring three people, including an unidentified student whose collarbone was 
broken, the California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
Those hurt in the accident Friday -- the student and two occupants of the 
pickup -- were treated at Mission Bay Hospital and released. 
</P>
<P>
A motorist who said he witnessed the accident told authorities that the school 
bus appeared to be racing along Balboa Avenue with another school bus just 
before the crash, according to the CHP, which is investigating. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the other bus has not been found, and it was not clear what 
company he worked for, said Carlos Gutierrez, a CHP traffic officer. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the racing account, Gutierrez estimated that the bus involved in the 
accident was traveling no more than 40 m.p.h. in a zone where the legal speed 
limit is 35 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
The driver, Joseph Bolden, 41, of San Diego, works for Laidlaw Transit Inc., 
the same company that employed a school-bus driver arrested at an Encino 
elementary school last month on charges of driving while drunk. In the Encino 
incident, the driver, Harold Keith Lone, had a history of drunk-driving 
convictions but had managed to obtain a license and a driving job by using an 
alias, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials in San Diego could not be reached for comment Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Bolden, who was not injured, was freed Friday evening from County Jail on his 
own recognizance, a jail spokeswoman said. He was charged with a misdemeanor 
count of driving under the influence of alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
Bolden told authorities he had had one beer several hours before the crash, 
which occurred at 2:30 p.m., Gutierrez said. Results of a blood-alcohol test 
were not yet available, and Bolden had no other violations on his school bus 
driver's certificate, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The CHP provided the following account of the accident: 
</P>
<P>
Bolden's bus, a 12-passenger model, was heading west on Balboa Avenue, toward 
Mission Bay Drive. His bus was in the center lane, while the bus with which it 
was allegedly racing was in the right lane. 
</P>
<P>
Bolden apparently could not stop the bus in time to avoid rear-ending the 
pickup, which was stopped at a traffic light. The pickup crashed into the rear 
of a sedan in front of it.

A 61-year-old retired grocery manager died Saturday after passing out in police 
custody, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Herbert Sewald of San Diego may have died of an accidental overdose of 
prescription medications and alcohol, a spokesman for the San Diego County 
coroner's office said. 
</P>
<P>
An autopsy is planned. 
</P>
<P>
Police are investigating, and they provided the following account: 
</P>
<P>
Just before 1 p.m. Saturday, police responsed to a call from a motor scooter 
shop on University Avenue, where they found Sewald passed out inside a display 
case. 
</P>
<P>
He was taken to the city detoxification center, which would not accept him 
because he appeared too debilitated. Officers took him to police headquarters 
to obtain approval to take him to County Jail, but Sewald stopped breathing 
while in the back seat of the police car. He was rushed to Physicians &amp; 
Surgeons Hospital, where he was declared dead.

STRAWBERRY ADMITTED TO REHABILITATION CLINIC;

BASEBALL: METS SAY RIGHT FIELDER, ARRESTED NINE DAYS AGO AFTER ALLEGEDLY 
THREATENING HIS WIFE, HAS ALCOHOL PROBLEM.

<P>
Troubled New York Met slugger Darryl Strawberry checked himself into a 
Manhattan rehabilitation center Saturday for treatment of what the team called 
an "alcohol problem." 
</P>
<P>
Strawberry entered the Smithers Alcoholism and Treatment Center -- where 
teammate Dwight Gooden underwent drug rehabilitation in 1987 -- just eight days 
after his arrest in Encino after police said he threatened his wife, Lisa, with 
a handgun. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an alcohol and not a drug problem," Strawberry's agent, Eric 
Goldschmidt, said. "The Mets tell me that Smithers has a great reputation, and 
I know things will work out for the better." 
</P>
<P>
Strawberry's decision to seek help came after three days of consultations last 
week with the team's employee assistance program director, Dr. Allan Lans, a 
psychiatrist associated with Smithers, according to Jay Horwitz, director of 
public relations for the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
Lans, who flew to Los Angeles at the suggestion of team officials Wednesday, 
spent two days with Strawberry at an airport hotel, talking with him and 
accompanying him shopping and to the movies. Lans escorted the 27-year-old 
right fielder back to New York Friday night, Horwitz said, and the two spent 
the night at Lans' home in Teaneck, N.J. Strawberry agreed to enter Smithers 
Saturday and was admitted just before 9 a.m., PST. 
</P>
<P>
"Our first concern is for Darryl's welfare," Met Executive Vice President Frank 
Cashen said in a statement released by the team. "Dr. Lans has worked closely 
with Darryl and spent several days in Los Angeles with him. . . . We are 
confident this will be the best thing for Darryl." 
</P>
<P>
The team wouldn't say how long Strawberry has had the alcohol problem, or 
whether it played a role in his dismal 1989 season. 
</P>
<P>
"We won't speculate," Horwitz said. "How long it's been a problem and those 
kind of details come under doctor-patient confidentiality." 
</P>
<P>
After finishing second in the voting for the National League's most valuable 
player in 1988, Strawberry promised a "monster" season in 1989. But Strawberry, 
the No. 1 draft choice in the nation in 1980, delivered a horror: his 
production at the plate dropped dramatically as he hit .225. 
</P>
<P>
Strawberry's troubled off-season began with a bitter contract dispute with the 
Mets. Strawberry, who can become a free agent after earning $1.8 million this 
season, reportedly was stung when Cashen said he wasn't worth the $3-million a 
year his agent asked. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 24, blood tests showed he was the father of a child born in 1988 to a 
St. Louis woman. Strawberry didn't dispute the medical findings and a court 
will determine how much he should pay in child support. 
</P>
<P>
Two days after that announcement, Strawberry was arrested at his home in Encino 
after his wife accused him of hitting her in the face and then threatening her 
with a gun, which was registered to her. 
</P>
<P>
Strawberry spent a short time in jail before he was released on $12,000 bond. A 
hearing scheduled for Friday to determine whether misdemeanor charges will be 
filed is expected to be postponed. 
</P>
<P>
It was unclear Saturday how long Strawberry will be at Smithers. The average 
stay is 28 days. Since spring training could be postponed by a lack of a labor 
agreement between the players' union and team owners, Strawberry might not miss 
any time with the team. 
</P>
<P>
Despite turmoil in his personal life and with teammates -- including a 
celebrated fight with Keith Hernandez last spring -- Strawberry has established 
himself as the all-time Met leader in home runs with 215 over his seven-year 
career.

<P>
For the past 41 years, Bill Shoemaker's second home has been the jockeys' room 
-- any jockeys' room, from Santa Anita Park to Pimlico and points in between. 
</P>
<P>
For Shoemaker, the room was more than a place to change his silks and polish 
his boots. He ate there, slept there, played cards, Ping-Pong and pool there 
and smoked his skinny, little cigars. 
</P>
<P>
Even on days when he had only one mount he would show up early, don his white 
terry cloth robe and settle in for a marathon round of race track rummy with 
valets and fellow jockeys. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Shoemaker closed up shop in the Santa Anita jockeys' room, leaving 
a huge hole where his 4-by-6 foot cubicle used to be. He packed up his tack 
box, his shower shoes and his extra boots -- a good starter set for any racing 
hall of fame. 
</P>
<P>
Down came Shoemaker's faded newspaper photo with his daughter, Amanda, taken 
after his victory in the 1985 Santa Anita Handicap on Lord at War, the race 
that made him the first to win $100 million in purses. Down came the six-inch 
strip of masking tape that read, simply, "Shoe," a truly modest label for what 
was literally the center of the horse racing universe on this day. 
</P>
<P>
An hour before Shoemaker's last ride, his usually spartan cubicle was packed 
with flowers: boxes full of long-stemmed red and white roses and a bouquet from 
the management at Beulah Park in Ohio that dwarfed the rider as he read the 
card. 
</P>
<P>
Shoemaker arrived in the room Saturday morning at 10 o'clock for a television 
interview. He knocked back a plate of ham and eggs, then killed some time at 
the card table, winning one, losing one and paying off from a wad of bills in 
his pocket. 
</P>
<P>
All day long, the other riders swirled around Shoemaker, pressing him for one 
last autograph, posing with him for one last snapshot. Luis Jauregui, Dave 
Patton, Frankie Detorri, Jesus Castanon -- they all wanted something to show 
their grandchildren someday. 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Hood, Shoemaker's valet for more than 25 years, came by to be with him on 
the big day. Hood, who rode against Shoemaker as his career began, knew better 
than anyone what was going on between those gray temples. 
</P>
<P>
"He's going to miss the room most of all," said Hood, now retired. "He liked 
nothing better than to spend time just being here with the other guys." 
</P>
<P>
At 2 p.m., about 45 minutes before the final ride, Shoemaker slipped on a set 
of mustard gold racing silks, adorned on the back with a red "SS" -- for 
Sully's Stable -- and trimmed with red epaulets. Across the room, Fernando Toro 
was getting a razzing from Corey Black. 
</P>
<P>
"Starting tomorrow, Bull, you'll be the oldest guy in the room," Black said to 
the 49-year-old Toro. "I call Bill 'Papa Shoe,' but we've got to call you 
Grandpa, don't we?" 
</P>
<P>
Shoemaker gave Toro a sympathetic smile. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't let them give you a hard time, Bull," said Shoemaker. "It's great when 
you turn 50. You get to flirt with all the girls and nobody minds. They think 
you're just a harmless old man." 
</P>
<P>
At 2:15 p.m., Shoemaker weighed in for the final time. As he stepped onto the 
scale, valet Bobby Markus handed him 20 pounds of saddle and lead-filled pads, 
the difference between Shoemaker's 98 pounds and the 118 assigned to Patchy 
Groundfog. 
</P>
<P>
"Unhhhh," Shoe groaned in mock stress as he leaned backwards under the weight. 
"That's the last time for that." 
</P>
<P>
Shoemaker let off a little nervous energy with some stretching exercises. Right 
leg, left leg, then a few deep bends to the floor. His game face was in place, 
and it was time . . . for cake. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Anita head chef Tony Pope hustled the jockeys into the pool and ping-pong 
room for the obligatory sheet cake, a table-sized creation of chocolate, cherry 
and vanilla that only Shoemaker could eat without blowing his riding weight. 
Flanked by Pope and fellow rider Eddie Delahoussaye, Shoe grinned one more time 
for one more bank of cameras. 
</P>
<P>
"No, Eddie, no! Don't push his face in the cake," a rider yelled from the back 
row. 
</P>
<P>
"No way, man," Delahoussaye said. "Not while he's holding that knife." 
</P>
<P>
As Shoemaker plunged the blade into the pastry, Delahoussaye scooped up a 
finger of frosting and plopped it in the middle of Shoe's nose. A bit dribbled 
to the front of the silks and was quickly wiped away. 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes before it was time to head for the paddock, the other jockeys in 
the Legend's Last Ride gathered around Shoemaker for a group photo. They mugged 
and giggled like school kids, and, just as the shutter snapped, Chris McCarron 
slapped a handful of shaving cream on top of Shoemaker's helmet. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured one of you guys would try something like that," said Shoemaker, a 
world-class prankster. "I tried it on a guy earlier, but he was too fast for 
me." 
</P>
<P>
The moment finally had arrived. At 2:27 p.m., Bill Shoemaker, the dignified 
dean of thoroughbred race-riding, walked out of a jockeys' room as a jockey for 
the last time, sporting a trace of shaving cream on his helmet, a cake stain on 
the front of his silks and a relieved smile at the thought that his longest day 
would soon be over. 
</P>
<P>
A half-hour later, Delahoussaye returned to the jockeys' room after slipping 
through inside Shoemaker and winning the Last Ride on Exemplary Leader. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll never forgive you, Delahoussaye," a fan screamed as he walked back 
through the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Shoemaker was hip deep in post race interviews, but it was business as usual 
for Delahoussaye and the other riders as they suited up for the next race. 
Delahoussaye shed his winning colors, picked up a new set of silks for the 
sixth race and eased them on. 
</P>
<P>
"Damn!" he shouted as his hand appeared at the end of the sleeve covered in 
shaving cream. He tried the other sleeve. Same result. 
</P>
<P>
"OK, who did it?" Delahoussaye demanded. "Was it you, Sibille?" 
</P>
<P>
Ray Sibille smiled and pointed to someone else, who pointed to someone else.

"At least I can be sure of one thing," Delahoussaye added. "This time, for

"But I'm not saying it wasn't his idea."

BILL SHOEMAKER'S FINAL RIDE; 
</P>
<P>
SHOEMAKER FINISHES FOURTH, BUT TRACK IS BIG WINNER; 
</P>
<P>
BETTING: SANTA ANITA GETS FIFTH-LARGEST HANDLE EVER. FOR MUCH OF FIFTH RACE, IT 
COMES $2 AT A TIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Bill Shoemaker's last ride was supposed to be a sentimental tribute to racing's 
all-time winningest jockey. 
</P>
<P>
However, sentiment has its price. 
</P>
<P>
And for most of the 64,573 at Santa Anita on Saturday afternoon, the price was 
$2. 
</P>
<P>
George Haines, the track's pari-mutuel manager, estimated that 40% of the win 
tickets that were bought on Patchy Groundfog, Shoemaker's ride, were for just 
$2. It's presumed that people bought those tickets as a souvenir with no 
intention of cashing them. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, one man went to the betting windows an hour before Shoemaker's final 
race and requested 5,000 $2 win tickets. The track could not meet that demand 
on such short notice and just punched tickets until the race started. 
</P>
<P>
Shoemaker's fourth-place finish also was costly to the state. If souvenir 
hunters had kept their tickets, the state would have pocketed about $184,000. A 
winning ticket would have paid $3.20. 
</P>
<P>
Monies from unclaimed tickets go back to the California Horse Racing Board and 
are supposed to be used for research. Last year, the state made $1.7 million 
from unclaimed tickets, although only $350,000 went to research. The rest of 
the money went to a general fund. 
</P>
<P>
The money bet on the Shoemaker race was easily the most bet on any race on 
Saturday. The track had the fifth largest handle ever, $13,124,004, of which 
17% was from the Shoemaker race. Normally, only 12% of the handle comes from 
the fifth race. 
</P>
<P>
The only races where more money traditionally is bet are the Santa Anita 
Handicap and the Kentucky Derby. In fact, $291,786 of the $594,697 (about 49%) 
bet to win in the fifth race was on Shoemaker. However, Shoemaker captured only 
34% of the place pool and 34% of the show pool. In total, $2,184,000 was bet on 
the fifth race, of which $1,213,724 (56%) included Shoemaker in the bet. 
</P>
<P>
Before the program started there was concern that a minus pool would be created 
by people betting on Shoemaker. With a minus pool, the track has to pay out 
more than it collects. The state requires that every bet must return at least 5 
cents on the dollar, making the minimum payout $2.10. 
</P>
<P>
Advance betting had Shoemaker at odds of 1 to 20 (a $2.10 return). However, 24 
minutes before post time the odds were 1 to 5 ($2.40) and stayed there for 
seven minutes. The odds changed to 2 to 5 ($2.80) for three minutes followed by 
1 to 2 ($3.00) for three minutes before hitting 3 to 5 for the final 11 minutes 
of betting. 
</P>
<P>
Public handicappers estimate that Patchy Groundfog would have gone off at odds 
of about 5 to 2 ($7.00) had Shoemaker not been making his final ride on the 
horse. 
</P>
<P>
There was little doubt that Shoemaker was the star attraction on Saturday. 
After his final race, it was estimated that nearly 13,000 people left the 
track. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps a Shoemaker victory would have changed all of that. But, still, it did 
little to change the financial windfall the day was to Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
Track officials claim that promotional expenses were only slightly greater than 
they would have been normally this weekend. Usually, the estimated $200,000 to 
$250,000 that was spent on promotion would have been directed toward today's 
Strub Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
Parking and concessions easily covered those expenses and the reported $100,000 
Shoemaker was paid to let the track honor him. The track also netted an extra 
$250,000 from the increased handle (the track gets 5% of all money bet) over a 
usual Saturday and $30,000 that ABC paid to televise the event. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Anita is hoping the day has a residual effect, causing people to return 
to the track. But, many of the people in the infield had to wait 20 minutes a 
race to place a bet. 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing we can do on a day like this," Haines said. "Most of the 
lines were long, especially in the infield. It's very difficult to service 
those people. We just can't get enough mutuel clerks." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Anita has 840 mutuel machines, of which 75 do not need an attendant. The 
track employs about 500 on most Saturdays but increased the total to 690 on 
Saturday. That still left 75 machines that couldn't be used because of a 
scarcity of mutuel clerks. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday wasn't the first time Santa Anita has had such a single-focused 
betting race. Spectacular Bid often caused minus pools when he ran at Santa 
Anita in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
But, the most recent time was on March 29, 1986 for the San Luis Rey Stakes. 
Symboli Rudolph, called the John Henry of Japan, was running and attracted an 
enormous amount of Japanese fans. 
</P>
<P>
According to Haines it created a large overlay, a situation in which horses are 
running at much longer odds than their form indicates. And, much like Saturday, 
the prohibitive favorite ran out of the money. 
</P>
<P>
But on this Saturday, the only things out of the money were the people betting 
on Bill Shoemaker.

Sacramento King owner Gregg Lukenbill has admitted he helped raise money to 
defeat a new baseball stadium in San Francisco for the Giants, according to a 
published report. 
</P>
<P>
Lukenbill, who wants to bring pro football and baseball to Sacramento, told the 
Sacramento Bee he asked a Woodland-based steel manufacturer to donate money to 
the campaign against the ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
The subsequent $12,500 contribution was used for last-minute mailers in 
November that San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos called a "sleazy, underhanded 
effort" by Lukenbill to steal the baseball team and "loot" San Francisco in the 
aftermath of the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Lukenbill's campaign contribution is under investigation by the state Fair 
Political Practices Commission and the San Francisco district attorney's 
office.

STRUGGLING AFC NEEDS VICTORY TO LESSEN STING OF SUPER BOWL

The AFC, suffering through a string of Super Bowl humiliations, will try to 
regain some respect in the NFL's other bowl game -- the Pro Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The AFC, loser of six consecutive Super Bowl games by a total score of 240-82 
but winner of three of the past five Pro Bowl games, takes on the NFC today at 
Aloha Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Kickoff is 5 p.m. PST. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be nice to win this one and finish up the season on a good note," 
said Denver safety Dennis Smith, whose team lost, 55-10, to San Francisco in 
the Super Bowl a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
Although most of football's best players will be in the game, some of the top 
names will be absent, particularly at quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco's Joe Montana, Denver's John Elway and Cincinnati's Boomer 
Esiason all are missing the game because of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Don Majkowski of Green Bay also didn't make it, listing personal reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Montana and Esiason were voted as the starters for the NFC and the AFC; 
Majkowski was the No. 2 quarterback for the NFC and Elway was to replace 
Esiason, who withdrew earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Warren Moon of Houston, the AFC starter, is left as the only quarterback voted 
into the Pro Bowl who actually will play. Mark Rypien of Washington was a late 
substitute for the NFC and Dave Krieg of Seattle was named to fill in for the 
AFC. 
</P>
<P>
Some players showed up for the game despite ailments, including running back 
Roger Craig and safety Ronnie Lott of the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
The contest marks the 20th year for the AFC-NFC all-star format, which began in 
1971 after the merger of the NFL with the American Football League. The NFC 
leads the series 11-8.

After finishing second in her first indoor race of the season, Jackie 
Joyner-Kersee will attempt to win the 55-meter hurdles in the Mobil 1 
Invitational track meet today at George Mason University. 
</P>
<P>
LaVonna Martin, a former Tennessee star, defeated Joyner-Kersee in the Millrose 
Games Friday night in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Martin was timed in 7.41 seconds; Joyner-Kersee clocked 7.47. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the athletes who competed in the Millrose Games will take part in 
today's meet in suburban Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
Hurdlers Roger Kingdom and Renaldo Nehemiah also are coming off disappointing 
performances in the Millrose Games. 
</P>
<P>
Kingdom, a two-time Olympic gold medalist, failed to qualify for the finals in 
the 55-meter hurdles. Nehemiah made the final but tripped over the first hurdle 
and failed to finish the race. 
</P>
<P>
Three talented East German athletes are scheduled to compete in the meet: 
Sigrun Wodars, Olympic 800-meter champion; Christine Wachtel, indoor 800-meter 
world champion; and Jens-Peter Herold, Olympic 1,500 meter bronze medalist.

COACH KRISTY LOESENER HAS PUT EL CAMINO ON WINNING TRACK; 
</P>
<P>
JC BASKETBALL: LAST SEASON THE WARRIORS MADE THE PLAYOFFS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 
14 YEARS. THIS SEASON THEY MAY BE EVEN BETTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Kristy Loesener has a strange attraction for struggling women's basketball 
programs. She likes the challenge of turning them around -- and perhaps the 
glory that comes with such an accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
At El Camino College, the second-year head coach has already experienced some 
of that glory. Loesener has brought immediate success to a program that went 
19-57 in three years under former Coach Jackie Lott. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988 the Warriors had a dismal 3-11 conference record. The year before, they 
finished at the cellar with an 0-14 league mark. That, among other things, was 
what attracted Loesener to El Camino. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoy the challenge," she said. "I enjoy teaching fundamentals, and I knew 
immediately that this was a great opportunity to do that. There's also a lot of 
talent in this area." 
</P>
<P>
Last season the 31-year old South Bay native capitalized on the talent pool, 
recruiting eight of the team's 10 players in only three months. 
</P>
<P>
Loesener had no choice but to rebuild in a hurry. When she was hired in May, 
1988, she inherited only two athletes, guard Julie Porter and center Melinda 
Brown, from her predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
The new coach and the new personnel clicked. El Camino finished 16-7 and made 
the playoffs for the first time in 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
Porter, a Bishop Montgomery High graduate, said playing for two coaches in two 
years wasn't easy. But she said Loesener helped the team by recruiting better 
athletes and developing them. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest difference in playing for Kristy is that we were more prepared," 
said Porter, now a guard at Dominican College in San Rafael. "We knew about the 
other team. We knew what they liked to do -- fast-break, run a lot, whatever. 
That made a difference." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Shannon, assistant athletic director at El Camino, said Loesener has 
brought unprecedented stability to the women's basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
"We've kind of struggled until we got Kristy," Shannon said. "She's very 
confident, and she's very self-assured. We expected this (success), and I think 
she expected it." 
</P>
<P>
This season looks even better for Loesener, a Torrance resident who spent her 
adolescence playing basketball for longtime Coach Sylvia Holly at Mira Costa 
High. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors are third in the eight-member South Coast Conference with a 6-3 
record and are 16-7 overall, despite the absence of top scorer Kim Bly, who 
suffered a knee injury Jan. 18 and is expected to miss the rest of the regular 
season. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino is known for its fast-paced offense, a Loesener specialty. Even 
without Bly, the back court is speedy, with guards Lynn Sherman and Tammy 
Booker. The front line includes 6-foot center Cheri Bullet and 5-9 forward 
Paula Dody. 
</P>
<P>
"Her style fits the players," said Cerritos College Coach Karen Peterson, whose 
team is second in the conference. "We played hard to beat them (68-58 on Jan. 
10). It was a great college game." 
</P>
<P>
Peterson, the Falcons' coach for the last eight years, said El Camino's program 
has taken a turn in the right direction. 
</P>
<P>
"There was dissension before," Peterson said. "They had a hard time keeping 
players. Kristy's changed it around real quick. I think she's really done a 
nice job over there. They got a lot better last year, and this year they're 
right up there." 
</P>
<P>
Loesener's secret is discipline and communication. Her players must be ready to 
work hard, she said. "I don't let people quit." 
</P>
<P>
But she enforces that discipline in an unusual way. Loesener isn't known for 
the aggressive behavior common among coaches. She doesn't yell or degrade her 
players like a drill sergeant. She's calm during practices and addresses her 
athletes in a soft, mellow tone. 
</P>
<P>
Bly, an all-league player at Hawthorne High, says Loesener is the most 
laid-back coach she's dealt with. 
</P>
<P>
"She allows us to speak to her as a person as well as a coach," Bly said. 
"Players like to work for her because she allows us to play with what we have. 
She lets us perform in our own way, and she's a great communicator." 
</P>
<P>
With those ingredients, Loesener, a health teacher at El Camino, believes she 
can make contenders out of struggling programs. She tried it twice before, at 
Glendale College and the University of Redlands, but didn't stay long enough to 
make a complete turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
At Redlands, a Division III school, Loesener's teams went 10-35 in 1987 and 
1988. At Glendale, in 1982-84, she compiled an 18-29 record. 
</P>
<P>
In between, Loesener was an assistant coach at Utah State University (1984-86), 
where she earned a master's degree in physical education with an emphasis in 
sports psychology. 
</P>
<P>
As a player, Loesener, a 5-foot-5 guard at Mira Costa, competed for two seasons 
at Santa Monica College and one season at Cal State Northridge before a knee 
injury in 1979 ended her career. 
</P>
<P>
She got a bachelor's degree in physical education from the University of Utah 
and made her coaching debut at University High in West Los Angeles in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
A full-time teaching position and the challenge of making the Warriors a 
powerhouse in junior college basketball attracted Loesener to El Camino. She 
added that it feels good to come home to the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of home, Loesener got the team a new and better one. Since she's been 
at El Camino, the women play and practice in the North Gym, also home to the 
men's team. Before, the women were stuck in the smaller South Gym. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the main gym," Loesener said during practice, "and we're the main 
team, so we want to play in the main gym. Sometimes I get snide comments like 
'Go play in the girls' gym.' " 
</P>
<P>
But derisive remarks don't bother Loesener, and they can't stop her from 
attempting another lift job. Her motto is "pursuit of excellence," whatever the 
cost.

IT'S ST. BERNARD OVER ST. ANTHONY AT BUZZER, 59-58 
</P>

<P>
After lealding by as many as 10 points in the first half, St. Bernard High held 
on in a tight second half to beat visiting St. Anthony High, 59-58, in a Camino 
Real League game Saturday night as a 16-foot jump shot by the Saints' Damaine 
Powell bounced off the back rim at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings (12-10, 7-5), who had four players score in double figures, were 
paced by Wyking Jones' 15 points. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Sullivan (12 points) hit two free throws with 35 seconds left to close 
the scoring. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been a clutch player for us," St. Bernard Coach Jim McClune said of 
Sullivan. "So I wasn't surprised. I thought he would (hit the free throw)." 
</P>
<P>
The second-place Saints (13-5, 9-3) were led by Oscar Encinas, who scored 23 
points. 
</P>
<P>
With 1:42 left in the game, Powell found backcourt mate Mike Smith open for a 
layup that gave St. Anthony a 56-53 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Ten seconds later Chris Keldorf (12 points) was fouled making a three-point 
basket and converted to give St. Bernard a 57-56 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Encinas missed on the Saints' next possession, but Smith scored after making a 
steal to give them a one-point lead with 39 seconds left. 
</P>

A backcourt foul by Powell four seconds later sent Sullivan to the line, where 
he provided the margin of victory.

DOMINGUEZ HILLS SWEEPS CHAPMAN, CLIMBS TO 4TH

Most of the season Cal State Dominguez Hills basketball Coach Dave Yanai has 
stood fast behind his prediction that the Toros would be "in the hunt" for a 
post-season berth in the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
</P>
<P>
But after Dominguez Hills (8-13) opened CCAA play with a 1-4 record, even the 
veteran of 13 seasons had his doubts. 
</P>
<P>
No one is doubting the team now, however, after the Toros swept a home-and-home 
series with Chapman College over the weekend, climbing into fourth place, a 
goal Yanai set for his freshman-laden team team when the year began. 
</P>
<P>
Victors 73-63 on Friday night and 56-47 on Saturday night, the Toros (4-4 in 
the conference) are now firmly in control of their own destiny in the fight for 
one of the top four spots in the CCAA. Four victories in their last eight games 
should guarantee no worse than the last of four playoff spots. 
</P>
<P>
"There were times that I questioned my own prediction," Yanai said. "I kept 
wondering if it would come back to haunt me."' 
</P>
<P>
It appears it won't if the Toros play the second round of their conference 
schedule as they did most of the first. They held halftime leads five times in 
the first round, winning all but one of those games, something they did just 
once in eight preseason games. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very confident," said Yanai. "Every team in this conference knows we will 
be in the hunt." 
</P>
<P>
In both games this weekend, the Toros used halftime leads to pull away to 
double-digit leads against the Panthers. Freshman forward Vincent Washington 
chipped in 12 points Friday and a career-best 16 Saturday to lead the Toros. 
</P>
<P>
In the women's game, the Lady Toros (9-12, 1-6) ran their losing streak to five 
CCAA games with a pair of losses to Chapman, 79-48 on Friday and 73-58 on 
Saturday.

SMALL COLLEGES; 
</P>
<P>
FOR THEM, WINNING ISN'T THE MOST IMPORTANT PITCH

<P>
The baseball programs at Point Loma Nazarene College and UC San Diego have a 
thing or two to learn about the American way. 
</P>
<P>
Winning, someone should tell them, is all that matters. 
</P>
<P>
But at Point Loma Nazarene, fielding the most competitive team possible is 
secondary to fielding a Christian one. After all, the "N" in PLNC does stand 
for Nazarene. 
</P>
<P>
"I primarily look for kids who will fit into our (Christian) environment," said 
Carroll Land, PLNC's coach. 
</P>
<P>
At UCSD, players arrive not necessarily to win but to earn a degree from one of 
the top academic schools in the UC system. 
</P>
<P>
They are student-athletes, with the emphasis on student. 
</P>
<P>
The programs are expecting varying degrees of success this year. Point Loma's 
season will be considered a good one if it finishes at the .500 level; such is 
the goal of what Land refers to as a "completely inexperienced team." 
</P>
<P>
UCSD, on the other hand, after losing only two starters from last year's team 
that finished ranked fifth in NCAA Division III, is seeking a berth in the 
Division III College World Series. 
</P>
<P>
"That's our No. 1 goal," said Coach Lyle Yates. "This is our most balanced team 
ever." 
</P>
<P>
UC SAN DIEGO 
</P>
<P>
It seems UCSD is adopting the American way. As recently as 1982, Yates was 
fielding a team of students of which "maybe two guys were real baseball 
players," the coach said. The Tritons are now getting transfers who played at 
Division I schools. 
</P>
<P>
Junior catcher Gene Northway transfered from San Jose State. Junior second 
baseman Louie Diaz arrived at UCSD via the University of Kansas, and senior 
right fielder Chris Murphy played at Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
They all came to a program that in 1987 won the NCAA West Regionals and placed 
fifth in the Division III World Series. In 1988, the Tritons were ranked No. 9 
nationally after going 25-2. Last year, they went 23-19. 
</P>
<P>
UCSD returns last year's leading hitter, third baseman Dave Ligerman (.345). 
But the starting third base job is not necessarily his. He's being pushed by 
Steve Nowlan, a transfer from Grossmont College. 
</P>
<P>
Other top hitters include: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Erik Judson, a shortstop who in 1988 hit .395 but last year fell to .274 
after recovering from a broken back. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ted White, a first baseman from Central Arizona, where he batted .321 last 
year and had seven home runs and 66 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Northway, who hit .321 at UCSD last year with three home runs and 10 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Murphy, who batted .309 a year ago and for a second consecutive season hit 
five home runs for the Tritons. 
</P>
<P>
UCSD also has experienced pitching. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Rupkey returns as the No. 1 starter. The All-American right-hander was 
10-5 last year with a 1.69 ERA. His 10 victories are an all-time school high. 
</P>
<P>
J.J. Fisher is the No. 2 starter and coming off a 1989 season in which he 
compiled a 7-2 record, 70 strikeouts and a 3.66 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
Dann Eaton, formerly of Serra High and San Diego City College and a transfer 
from Emporia State (an NAIA school in Kansas) will be the No. 3 starter. Last 
year at Emporia State, Eaton went 4-1 with four saves and a 3.53 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
POINT LOMA NAZARENE 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to UCSD, the Crusaders return only two starters from 1989: senior 
second baseman Craig Gastineau and sophomore third baseman/pitcher Mark 
Ratekin. The 23-man roster is dominated by eight freshman and eight sophomores. 
</P>
<P>
The top returning hitter is Ron Caton, who last year as a freshman designated 
hitter batted .320. This season, Caton will play first. 
</P>
<P>
The pitching staff is expected to be the strong point. Ratekin will be the No. 
1 starter. Others will be Kevin Burley, a returning sophomore right-hander; 
junior transfer Kevin Hazlett, a left-hander from Mission Community College in 
San Jose, and junior transfer West Rekeda, a right-hander who played at New 
Mexico last year.

WATT PROJECT LINKED TO REPLACEMENT HOUSING; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: THE OFFICE PROJECT WILL BRING 80 SUBSIDIZED UNITS TO THE CENTRAL 
CITY WEST PLANNING AREA, AS WELL AS 5,000 WORKERS AND A DAY-CARE FACILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When the Watt City Center office/retail project is completed just across the 
Harbor Freeway from downtown Los Angeles in about six years, it will be the 
daytime home to about 5,000 workers. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps more important for the estimated 15,000 residents of the Central City 
West planning area is thatthe controversial twin-tower project will bring 80 
low-rent apartment units to the area at a cost of $6.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
This will make it the first project in the area whose approval was linked to 
replacement low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates for low- and moderate-income housing have viewed the $650-million 
project as a model development for the 314-acre area west of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
"Any developer who builds in Central City West will be strongly urged to do 
replacement housing when his project is occupied," said the Rev. Philip Lance, 
an Episcopal priest and organizer of the 250-member homeowners' group, United 
Neighbors of Temple Beaudry &amp; City West. 
</P>
<P>
The mostly Latino residents of the area have an average annual family income of 
about $12,000, according to Michael Bodaken, a Legal Aid Foundation attorney 
who represented the community group in negotiations that resulted in the 
project's housing element. 
</P>
<P>
"We look upon this commitment to build low-income housing as a model for future 
projects in Central City West, to avoid the concentration on higher-cost 
housing that has occurred in other downtown areas," Bodaken said. 
</P>
<P>
Central City West is a mix of older low- and mid-rise commercial and 
residential buildings, along with new high-rise office buildings such as the 
33-story Arco Center at 1055 W. 7th St. Arco Center opened last spring and is 
80% leased. 
</P>
<P>
The boundaries of Central City West are the Hollywood and Harbor freeways, 
Olympic Boulevard and Witmer and Union streets. 
</P>
<P>
Watt City Center, a project of W&amp;M Partners Development Corp. -- composed 
of Ray Watt and Kent Merselis -- will be built on the 6.48-acre site at 7th and 
Bixel streets formerly occupied by the Thomas Cadillac and Vicky Thomas Pontiac 
automobile dealerships. Construction start is scheduled in mid-February. 
</P>
<P>
The two office buildings will be built over a six-year period, with the 
29-story, 510,000-square-foot office tower at the southeast corner of 7th and 
Bixel and a $1-million, 5,000-square-foot day-care center for 50 children on 
the south side of 8th Street scheduled for completion in the fall of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
A 62-story, 1.1-million-square-foot office tower at the southwestern corner of 
7th and Bixel will follow. 
</P>
<P>
The fees for 30% of the children in the day-care center will be subsidized by 
the developer. The center will be open to the public and also serve workers in 
the office towers. 
</P>
<P>
Forty of the 80 housing units must be built in the 314-acre Central City West 
specific plan area, to replace apartment buildings torn down by the Thomas 
family in 1985, according to Ray Watt, chairman and chief executive officer of 
Watt Industries. 
</P>
<P>
The other 40 units can be constructed in the specific plan area or within a 
3-mile radius of the project. 
</P>
<P>
The housing must be completed by the time the 29-story office tower opens and 
will be for very-low to low-income residents under guidelines established by 
the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, Watt said. 
</P>
<P>
Under HUD guidelines, the ceiling for very-low income is $23,000 a year for a 
family of four, while low-income is a maximum of $34,000 annually for a family 
of four, Bodaken said. 
</P>
<P>
Rents are pegged at 25% to 30% of adjusted gross annual income, he said. This 
means that a family of four earning $12,000 a year would pay $250 to $325 a 
month rent for an apartment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The housing will consist of two- or three-story apartment buildings," Watt 
added. "We haven't decided if the housing will be built by Watt Industries or 
by a joint venture." 
</P>
<P>
Based in Santa Monica, Watt has been in the real estate business since 1947. 
Through the years, Watt and his scores of joint-venture partners have built 
more than 100,000 houses, resort communities, 8 million square feet of 
industrial and office space, 50 shopping centers and three major hotels, 
including the 750-room Stouffer Concourse Hotel at Los Angeles International 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Merselis, president of W&amp;M Partners Development Corp., was involved in the 
construction of the Home Savings of America Tower at 7th and Figueroa streets 
when he was with Ahmanson Commercial Development Co., and with the development 
of Colorado Place in Santa Monica when he was with Becket Investment Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Watt said he decided to develop his first downtown Los Angeles project when he 
learned of the opportunity to acquire the Thomas site. Watt bought the land 
from the Thomas interests in May, 1988, for $57 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Downtown, east of the Harbor Freeway, is virtually all built up, so the 
logical directions of growth are west and south," Watt said. "I see a time when 
high-rise office buildings will line both sides of the Harbor Freeway 
throughout the downtown area -- and Bixel Street will be a major corridor." 
</P>
<P>
Under the approval agreement, W&amp;M will have to spend $3.5 million to widen 
and realign Bixel Street, a hilly north-south street that leads into the 
southbound on-ramp of the Harbor Freeway. Bixel will be widened from 46 to 86 
feet, with a 100-foot-wide potential right of way -- and a jog at 7th Street 
will be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
W&amp;M will also realign and widen the southbound Harbor Freeway on-ramp at 
8th Street as well as widen 7th and 8th streets. 
</P>
<P>
Designed by the Nadel Partnership, West Los Angeles, the two office towers will 
be clad in a combination of white flamed (rough) and polished granite and 
blue-gray glass. 
</P>
<P>
Landscaped plazas designed by Todd Bennitt of Jardin International will cover 
about 2 acres in front of the buildings along 7th and Bixel streets. 
Landscaping will include shade trees, water features and sculpture gardens. 
</P>
<P>
The buildings of Watt City Center will be linked by a combination of walks, 
subterranean driveways and a pedestrian tunnel system. 
</P>
<P>
Although Watt City Center was approved Dec. 15 by a 14-1 City Council vote -- 
with only Councilman Marvin Braude opposed -- the massive project has drawn 
fire from those who claim that it will produce traffic jams on the adjacent 
Harbor Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Before the approval vote, W&amp;M withdrew plans to build a 1,000-space garage 
for vans and other high-occupancy vehicles to reduce the amount of new traffic. 
</P>
<P>
As approved, the project will have about 3,200 above- and below-grade parking 
spaces for the two towers, meeting the city code requirement of two parking 
spaces for each 1,000 square feet of space, Merselis said.

Judith Lenthall, a former planner in the San Diego Planning Department, has 
been named president of the Building Industry Assn. of Southern California's 
nonprofit subsidiary that will build and rehabilitate housing for needy people. 
</P>
<P>
Lenthall played a key role in developing San Diego's highly praised single-room

AGENT RESENTS ADVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am writing on behalf of myself and the other 85 agents in the Woodland Hills 
office of Fred Sands Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
I take great exception to Robert L. Bruss' advice to sellers to only give a 
listing to a realtor for 30 days. As if this is not poor enough advice, 
admonition to sellers to "be sure the listing agent agrees in writing to allow 
the seller to cancel the listing at any time without cause and without cost" 
(Jan. 14), is nothing short of outrageous! 
</P>
<P>
I am hard-working, professional realtor-associate whose listings and sales come 
mainly as the result of personal referrals. It is not difficult to check the 
references of the agent with whom you wish to list your house. A listing 
contract is a contract of employment. What contract of employment may be 
terminated at a moment's notice? 
</P>
<P>
All of my listings are vigorously marketed and no expense is spared to promote 
them. It would not be unusual for myself and my company to spend $4,000 to 
$5,000 to promote each listing. 
</P>
<P>
Despite constant broker and public open houses, beautiful picture-brochures 
distributed widely, national and local newspaper, and television advertising, 
in today's market, some homes do not sell quickly. 
</P>
<P>
When this happens, it is never the fault of a seller for making it hard to show 
his property, keeping an untidy house, insisting on too high an asking price or 
being in a difficult location (i.e. backing to a freeway). No, it is always the 
fault of the real estate agent! 
</P>
<P>
The clause Bruss advocates would allow a listing to be canceled perhaps within 
24 hours of a large sum of money being spent. This is hardly fair to the 
diligent agent. 
</P>
<P>
I would be grateful if Bruss would cease to belittle the efforts of myself and 
my colleagues, and instead, devote himself to assisting buyers and sellers to 
realize the dream of the American home ownership.

'BIG I' COMPLAINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I'm sure the architect of downtown's First Interstate World Center is shocked 
that this landmark architectural achievement has been so irresponsibly 
cheapened by First Interestate's corporate ego and greed displayed ever so 
bluntly by the four "Big I" logos recently stuck on the crown of the building. 
</P>
<P>
I think it's safe to assume that by now the public knows that the tallest 
building on the West Coast, is recognized internationally as Los Angeles' first 
major contribution to contemporary architecture. 
</P>
<P>
It is obvious to anyone that the seemingly arbitrarily placed "Big I" signs 
don't belong on this building. 
</P>
<P>
First Interstate had an opportunity to present itself with class. Instead, it 
overstated itself, cheapened a beautiful building, and has angered many in the 
community. If First Interstate truly wants to make a contribution to Los 
Angeles, it should begin by removing the four "Big I's."

REALTOR COOL TO CALLING SLOWER SALES 'BIG CHILL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am a real estate broker and president of the Orange County Broker Council for 
ERA Real Estate. 
</P>
<P>
I take issue with the article "The Big Chill" (Jan. 14). 
</P>
<P>
First of all, your title does not reflect what is happening in the marketplace, 
which is a slowdown from the fast-paced market of last year, not a "chill." 
</P>
<P>
Your subhead stating that owners are being forced to slash prices to sell their 
properties is extremely misleading. What really is happening is that sellers 
are having to price their properties realistically in order to sell, and they 
are reducing asking prices, not selling prices. 
</P>
<P>
Your article quotes a stockbroker as predicting a 5% to 10% drop in housing 
prices this year, and a real estate investor as predicting a 10% to 20% drop. 
What I don't understand, is, why you didn't interview people who are recognized 
experts, the economist, real estate analyst, real estate broker or real estate 
board president. 
</P>
<P>
Their only disagreement is on how much the increase will be. That varies from 
2% to 8% depending on who you talk to. 
</P>
<P>
You stated that housing inventory is up 50% from a year ago. If your reporter 
had checked the facts, he would have found that there was a severe shortage of 
inventory last year, which would distort any comparison with this year.

CAR SAYS SOME FIRMS MISAPPLY CHECK-HOLD LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Representatives of some title and escrow companies are misinterpreting a new 
state law, causing "considerable confusion" in California's real estate market, 
according to the California Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
The law, which took effect Jan. 1, allows title and escrow companies to place a 
variety of different holds on funds that are deposited in escrow accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Personal checks drawn on a local bank can usually be held for up to three 
business days, according to the realty group, while checks drawn on an 
out-of-town bank can be held for up to seven days. 
</P>
<P>
However, the realtors claim, some escrow and title companies are applying the 
same rules to certain cashier's and certified checks that, under law, usually 
can't be held for more than one business day. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that most escrow agents are disbursing funds as soon as they become 
available, but some escrow and title companies apparently have misinterpreted 
the law or have been misinformed about requirements of the new law," said Jim 
Antt Jr., president of the California Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
Buyers and sellers can face additional costs if their escrow is delayed, Antt 
said.

NEWSPAPERS MAKE A GOOD MULCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From the Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Old newspapers create a problem when they fill up landfills and clutter 
basements and garages. But there is a good use for old newspapers that helps 
bring about a more productive, weed-free garden. 
</P>
<P>
A mulch of shredded newspapers conserves moisture, moderates temperatures and 
discourages weed growth. It can also shelter seedlings from sun, wind and rain 
on exposed soil. The paper generally decomposes gradually into soil-enriching 
humus by the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Newspaper strips mixed with grass clippings soak up excess moisture to 
encourage an airy, open texture in compost piles. The high-carbon newsprint 
rots readily in combination with the high-nitrogen clippings, and household 
waste such as fruit and vegetable peelings, egg shells, coffee grounds and tea 
leaves. 
</P>
<P>
Newspapers generally contain 75% ground wood pulp and 25% purified fiber or 
cellulose. Wood pulp contains the nutrients and trace elements that were in the 
trees originally. Newsprint ink is made from carbon black and mineral oil and 
is not harmful to plants or microbial soil life. 
</P>
<P>
Newspapers are said to be rich in carbohydrate energy and have been 
successfully fed to cattle by agricultural researchers at several university 
experiment stations. 
</P>
<P>
But researchers advise against using color newspaper inserts and magazines in 
gardens. 
</P>
<P>
Newspaper shredders are available. One that reportedly quickly slices 
newspapers -- up to 12 thicknesses at once -- into half-inch ribbons features 
self-sharpening circular blades. For information, write The Kinsman Co., River 
Road, Point Pleasant, Pa. 18950.

SOLAR HEATER PROVIDES DRINKING WATER TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES DULLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: We have a large family and spend over $300 per year to heat hot 
water. I would like to use a solar system to save money and help save the 
environment. Are there still solar systems available? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: When the energy tax credits were eliminated, many of the high-priced 
solar contractors went out of business. Although solar equipment that you can 
use to build your own system is a little harder to find now, it is still 
available. There are even some new, very efficient designs. 
</P>
<P>
A typical solar system can provide 60% to 75% of your family's hot water needs 
throughout the year. The annual savings can total a couple of hundred dollars. 
Since this is after-tax money, it can be equivalent to $300 to $400 of 
additional income from your job. 
</P>
<P>
The two most common types of solar systems for heating water utilize flat plate 
collectors or concentrating collectors. Concentrating collectors use one of 
several methods to focus the sun's rays on to the water to produce higher water 
temperatures or steam. 
</P>
<P>
One new and very efficient solar system uses a small concentrating collector to 
produce steam and pure distilled drinking water as a byproduct. The collector 
is rotated by a small motor throughout the day so it continually faces the sun 
most directly. Being relatively small, it is not very noticeable on your house. 
</P>
<P>
The steam from the collector circulates through a pipe in your existing water 
heater where it condenses to transfer the heat to the water. On a typical sunny 
day, it produces about 3,000 BTU/hour. 
</P>
<P>
Tubing runs from the tank to a water storage jug to collect the purified 
distilled drinking water. It produces more than 700 gallons of distilled water 
per year. This can save several hundred dollars in bottled water costs or 
additional energy consumption to operate an electric distiller. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, photovoltaics (solar cells that produce free electricity) have 
become much more energy-efficient and cost effective. You can tie these into 
solar systems to power the small electric motors and controls. It is a natural 
fit since the electricity output is greatest when the hot water production is 
greatest. 
</P>
<P>
Before you select a solar system for your home, contact a solar designer to 
plan a system for your needs. You can always add more collectors to a system as 
your budget allows. 
</P>
<P>
You can write to me for Utility Bills Update No. 359 describing the new solar 
water heating system that makes distilled drinking water, a list of solar 
collector manufacturers and several piping layouts of solar systems. Please 
include $1 and a self-addressed business-sized envelope. Send your requests to

Rust-Inhibiting Paint Works on Baseboards 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have electric baseboard heaters in my bathroom, and the covers on them are 
rusting due to the moisture. Do I need a special type of paint that won't 
adversely effect the heat transfer efficiency of them? 
</P>
<P>
A: Most rust-inhibiting paints are fine, as long the cover doesn't get hotter 
than 190 degrees. Although the cover normally shouldn't get that hot, check 
with the supplier of the baseboard heaters for the temperature specifications. 
Painting the cover won't affect the efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
If the temperature gets above 190 degrees, use heat-resistant paints made for 
barbecues. Don't paint the actual heating fins under the cover. They get too 
hot and the paint can effect the heat transfer properties. 
</P>
<P>

be sent to James Dulley, Los Angeles Times, 6906 Royalgreen Drive, Cincinnati,

ON THE HOUSE: HOME IMPROVEMENT;

<P>
PLANNING IS THE SECRET TO REMODELING SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MORRIS and JAMES CAREY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: I have decided to do some major remodeling in my home that will 
require a professional. I need help. I don't know where to begin. 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Our advice can be summed up in three words -- plan, plan, plan. 
</P>
<P>
The real key to most successful remodeling projects is thorough planning. The 
first step is to clearly define your ideas by preparing a well-detailed needs 
list. You should attempt to be as specific as possible with respect to the 
materials, finishes and products to be used. 
</P>
<P>
The next step is to agree on a realistic budget based upon the work you wish to 
have performed. 
</P>
<P>
Once you have established needs and budget, then some design expertise by an 
architect, designer or contractor/designer is in order. Many general 
contractors have in-house design services. 
</P>
<P>
The completed design should then be bid to at least three reputable general 
contractors. Make sure that these contractors are licensed and have all the 
proper insurances required to perform such work. Remember the cheapest price 
may not give you the best value. 
</P>
<P>
A real professional will be anxious for you to visit previous jobs to see his 
work and talk to his customers. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, you should contact the Contractors State License Board and the 
Better Business Bureau to ensure that there are no complaints against that 
contractor. Also, both of these organizations offer very helpful and highly 
informative pamphlets free of charge. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to the contract, make sure that everything is in writing, leave 
nothing to chance. If it's not in writing, chances are that you won't get it, 
at least not without paying more for it. 
</P>
<P>
Before to making the final payment, make sure that the contractor provides you 
with releases of lien for all labor and material and provided for the job. An 
ounce of planning is truly worth a pound of cure. 
</P>
<P>
Cracks in Stucco Wall Keep Coming Back 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have cracks in my stucco that have been patched, but they keep coming 
back. The filler the painter used is crumbling. The painter said there isn't 
anything he can do. How can I make permanent patch? 
</P>
<P>
A: It may either be that your painter is not versed in stucco patchwork, or 
that you have substantial ground movement under your house. Try a paintable 
silicone caulk. Scrape the old patch material out of the cracks, make sure that 
the inside surfaces are free of paint and loose debris, and force the new caulk 
deep into the crack joint. 
</P>
<P>
How to Strip Old Layers of Wallpaper 
</P>
<P>
Q: We have just purchased a previously owned home, and one of my first projects 
is to remove all of the horrible wallpaper. It's so busy it gives me a 
headache. Can you offer some tips? 
</P>
<P>
A: Besides patterns that you are not happy with, wallpaper in poor condition, 
multiple layers of wallpaper and flocked wallpaper must be removed before you 
can hang a new covering. If the existing material is strippable, it will come 
off easily when you pull at a corner or seam. 
</P>
<P>
Before removing non-strippable wallpaper, break the surface of the covering by 
sanding it with very coarse sandpaper. You can also score the wall with a saw 
by scraping the saw's entire cutting blade against the covering in many places 
and in various directions. 
</P>
<P>
To remove the paper you can use either a steamer (can be rented from your local 
paint or wallpaper store) or a garden sprayer. 
</P>
<P>
In both cases, the active ingredient is water, but there are concentrated 
solutions available that will hasten the process by helping to break down the 
old glue. 
</P>
<P>
A steamer converts water to steam that runs through a hose to a device that you 
move along the wall. This allows the steam to penetrate the covering. To use a 
garden sprayer, fill it with very hot water and spray the water onto the 
wallpaper. You will be able to begin removing the paper in a matter of minutes 
by using a broad knife and working from the top down. 
</P>
<P>
If several layers of paper exist, it's a good idea to remove each layer 
separately. Extreme caution should be employed so as not to damage the drywall 
below. This may be virtually impossible if the wallpaper was originally applied 
to a raw, unprepared surface. In this case, you will need to repair the wall 
with a spackling paste or drywall compound. 
</P>
<P>
After all the repairs have been made and the surface has been thoroughly 
sanded, apply a coat of flat, oil-based enamel undercoat or primer seal. You 
are now ready to install your new wallpaper.

CONVERTING 2 BEDROOMS INTO MASTER SUITE PAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Converting two existing bedrooms into a master suite can make an existing home 
competitive with new construction, according to Remodeling Magazine. 
</P>
<P>
The expected pay back from such a remodeling job averages 79% nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Experts advise undertaking the project only if the house will still have at 
least three bedrooms. 
</P>
<P>
An additional bathroom considerably increases the marketability of a home with 
one or 1 1/2 baths, according to Remodeling Magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Use high-quality materials that are easy to clean. Use lots of mirrors and 
include ample storage. Skylights brighten interior bathrooms and help to make a 
small room look larger.

THE SMALL INVESTOR: TREAT TENANTS WITH RESPECT: IT'S GOOD BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

I am a landlord specializing in providing single-family detached rental houses. 
Our three-bedroom, one-bath houses are in the east San Gabriel Valley 
communities of Hacienda Heights, La Puente and Azusa. 
</P>
<P>
In 15 or so years of being in the rental house business, we have developed some 
effective management techniques that some of your landlord readers may be able 
to apply in the management of their properties. 
</P>
<P>
Golden Rule: Always treat your tenants with dignity and respect. 
</P>
<P>
Never lose sight of the fact that you cannot succeed in landlording without a 
cooperative tenant. The tenant, when he pays his rent, makes it possible for 
you, the landlord, to pay bills and make your expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Just as a merchant needs customers to buy his merchandise to be a successful 
merchandiser, so does a landlord need: 
</P>
<P>
1 -- A good long-term tenant. 
</P>
<P>
2 -- A tenant who pays the rent on time. 
</P>
<P>
3 -- A tenant who respects the property of others and maintains it as if it 
were his own. 
</P>
<P>
All things considered, renting to good tenants is surely the best way to run a 
landlording business. You need the tenant just as much as he needs you. Keeping 
good tenants is the key to being a successful landlord. Thus, it seems that the 
prudent landlord should go out of his way to keep good tenants. 
</P>
<P>
Let's talk about a few common-sense but winning techniques for keeping good 
tenants: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Be friendly at all times but not chummy. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Be reasonable at all times in your relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Make an extra effort to please them at certain times. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tend immediately to their reasonable requests for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Greet them when they first move in with a friendly hello or a note of 
welcome on their front door. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Provide them with useful written information for coping with emergencies 
that pertain to the property. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Memorize all of your tenants' names. People like to be remembered. 
</P>
<P>
 -- At the tenant's one-year anniversary in your property, send a complimentary 
letter to the tenant's employer. Check with tenants first to get permission and 
the name of his immediate superior. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sometime during the holiday season, send your tenants holiday greetings or 
small gifts to express your gratitude for their having been your good tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Include your good tenants in your efforts to obtain other good tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Offer to repaint their dwelling if it hasn't been painted in three or more 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Stay in constant touch and let them know you care about them and their 
loved ones' well-being. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Respect their right to privacy at all times. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Whenever possible, hire tenants to work for you. Tenants appreciate the 
opportunity to pick up some extra money. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't take long before the tenant realizes that you are truly not the 
unscrupulous landlord they had envisioned and that you care about their 
well-being. They will come to see you as a landlord who values them as good 
tenants and will reciprocate by being good tenants. 
</P>
<P>
What goes around, comes around. Being a rotten landlord begets having rotten 
tenants.

MONTOYA CASE: HOW MANY OTHER ROTTEN APPLES EXIST?;

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If Sen. Joseph Montoya is a rotten apple, as a jury of 12 ordinary citizens has 
decided, then the next question is: How many other rotten apples are there in 
the barrel of Capitol politicians? 
</P>
<P>
Do the keepers of the barrel -- California's voters -- consider it so spoiled 
that they will want to throw out the whole bunch this election year? Will they 
try to douse the rotten odor with a major dose of political reform? 
</P>
<P>
And to what extent is the Legislature capable of reforming itself? 
</P>
<P>
The preliminary answers to these questions varied widely among politicians and 
academicians Saturday, ranging from those who believe the whole Sacramento 
barrel is rotten, to those who say it does no good to regulate politics. It's 
human nature, they say; crooks will be crooks. Why should Sacramento be 
different? 
</P>
<P>
The Montoya jury, described by one academic as "the equivalent of a political 
focus group," sent a strong message to the Legislature Friday that public 
corruption will not be tolerated. But afterward, the federal jurors emphasized 
that this was not their goal; they had concentrated solely, narrowly, on the 
evidence against Montoya and wound up convicting the Whittier Democrat on seven 
counts of extortion, racketeering and money-laundering. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, several jurors reported being shocked upon learning during the 
two-month trial that legislators routinely raise huge amounts of money from 
special interest groups seeking legislative action. They heard evidence of 
lawmakers collecting hundreds of thousands in campaign contributions and 
accepting honorariums of up to $10,000 for a single appearance before a lobby 
group. 
</P>
<P>
"It shook me up," said juror Rosemary Talamantez, a UC Davis librarian. "I was 
surprised that there was so much money going back and forth. I had never even 
thought about honorariums. We elect our officials and have faith that they 
represent us. And here was Sen. Montoya playing around with people's money, 
playing around with people's lives. I hope not all of them (legislators) are 
like this." 
</P>
<P>
Not all legislators are unethical. In fact, the consensus of Capitol politicos 
-- lobbyists, observers and legislators themselves -- seems to be that most are 
basically ethical, given the high-stakes, pricey political arena with the 
gray-area rules in which they play. Still, most lawmakers find their personal 
standards of integrity constantly put to the test by the need to raise campaign 
contributions and live on a $40,800 annual salary without supplementing their 
incomes with honorariums. 
</P>
<P>
And not everyone around the Capitol believes that even most legislators are 
ethical. For example, one highly respected, veteran political insider who has 
held important posts in the Legislature, the executive branch and also among 
special interest groups recently commented, on the condition he remain 
anonymous: "In the '60s, it was like there was a barrel with a couple of rotten 
apples. Now, I feel like we've got a whole barrel of rotten apples and a few 
good ones in between." 
</P>
<P>
The judicial system is in the process of trying to determine just how many 
rotten apples there are. U.S. Atty. David F. Levi, working off of the same FBI 
sting operation that snared Montoya, also has been investigating five other 
elected officials and reportedly is widening his probe to other politicians who 
have not yet been publicly identified. 
</P>
<P>
Most legislators now expect the U.S. attorney to push aggressively for more 
indictments, several made clear in interviews after Montoya's conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Mindful that voters are becoming increasingly cynical about their 
representatives -- a recent Times poll found that a majority of voters think it 
is commonplace for lawmakers to take bribes -- legislators for the past year 
have been debating various ethics proposals designed to improve their tarnished 
image. 
</P>
<P>
One plan will go before California voters in June. It would ban honorariums. 
But it also would pave the way for a pay raise by creating an independent 
commission with authority to raise lawmakers' salaries. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always said that honoraria is thinly disguised bribery," said Sen. Ed 
Davis (R-Valencia). 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) was among those lawmakers Saturday saying 
the Legislature should immediately ban all honorariums and not wait for voter 
approval of an ethics package tied to a potential pay increase. 
</P>
<P>
"The hard thing is to get members (of the Legislature) to understand that they 
may not be doing what Montoya did, but that's not the point," Katz said. "The 
point is that what the public expects of us has changed, in the same way that 
10 years ago we would never have considered banning smoking on airlines. What 
was acceptable behavior then is not today. The public no longer views honoraria 
as acceptable behavior." 
</P>
<P>
For the last year, some legislators also have advocated other sweeping ethical 
reforms, including limits on gifts and outside income and restrictions on 
lobbying once legislators leave office. Such proposals, however, have been 
bottled up in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
State Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, as part of his race for governor, is 
pushing a November ballot measure that would provide for public financing of 
campaigns and impose California's first-ever limits on the number of years 
elected state officials could remain in office. He calls Sacramento a "swamp." 
</P>
<P>
But some experts question whether any of these "reforms" can clean up the 
political mess. "You can't regulate politics," said Larry L. Berg, director of 
the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at USC. "What Montoya did already was 
against the law. If people are crooks, they're crooks." 
</P>
<P>
Another academician, Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a senior associate at the Center for 
Politics and Policy at Claremont Graduate School, said "one message is that the 
public is not going to tolerate the kind of behavior that the jury perceived." 
</P>
<P>
"This was a jury of peers -- the public," she said. "I looked at it as the 
equivalent of a political focus group. I think you could have taken a group of 
12 people anywhere and they would have come to the same conclusion. They showed 
the skepticism that the public generally feels about legislators. When it was 
Montoya's word against anybody else's, it was anybody else they believed." 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, jurors came to the trial with little experience in the world 
of politics. The seven-woman, five-man jury included two mechanics, a utility 
crew foreman, a former accountant for the state, a secretary, a student and a 
postal worker. In fact, federal prosecutors and Montoya's attorneys had sought 
to keep off the jury anyone who had personal knowledge of the legislative 
process. 
</P>
<P>
Some members of the jury, which included two Latinas, one black and one Asian, 
said the prospect of convicting Montoya was emotionally traumatic, and at times 
gave them headaches or left them unable to sleep or eat. 
</P>
<P>
Talamantez said she was proud to have served on the jury and now has a better 
sense of her duty as a citizen -- and the duty of public officials to conduct 
their affairs honestly. 
</P>
<P>
"We as citizens have a responsibility," she said. "The legislators have a 
responsibility to us. I think it taught us a lesson: We should all read the 
papers and watch the news."

PARTS OF ALASKA PIPELINE FACE CORROSION THREAT;

<P>
Although oil executives once swore that it wouldn't happen, corrosion is eating 
through critical sections of the 800-mile-long Trans Alaska Pipeline, 
threatening its structural integrity and forcing an expensive and unprecedented 
crash program of repairs. 
</P>
<P>
Pipeline officials were in Juneau, Alaska, last week to explain a 
rehabilitation plan that could cost the oil pipeline's operators $1.5 billion 
and perhaps more over the next five years. That in turn could cost the Alaska 
state government hundreds of millions of dollars in oil royalties and related 
revenues. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials also are concerned because the nation's foreign trade deficit 
could increase by more than $1 billion if the pipeline must be shut down for 
even a few days. Line operators have promised to complete repairs without 
disrupting oil flow for more than 2.5 days over the next 18 months, though 
federal regulators say they have heard that the interruption would be longer. 
</P>
<P>
The Times has learned that the federal Office of Pipeline Safety is 
investigating possible violations of safety regulations. Inspection reports 
reviewed by The Times question the quality of installation, repair, maintenance 
and operations of the pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
The reports of large-scale corrosion, coming on the heels of the 
environmentally devastating Exxon Valdez oil spill last March, have served here 
to heighten suspicion of Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., the oil industry 
consortium that runs the pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
"They tell us they just got this state-of-the-art surveillance system, and 
that's why they found this," said Alaska Atty. Gen. Douglas B. Baily. "But 
we're not buying that story. This corrosion didn't just happen. They've had 
other technology to use." 
</P>
<P>
Because every month of delay represented enormous losses to its owners, the 
pipeline was built under tremendous pressure to get the job done. Both federal 
records and regulators suggest now that the severity of corrosion problems 
might have been lessened and repair costs minimized had Alyeska heeded warnings 
from critics before completion, not rushed construction work in bad weather and 
been more aggressive in looking for problems once oil was flowing. 
</P>
<P>
"In the oil business they always say 'pay me now or pay me later,' " said 
federal pipeline engineer Mark A. Reis, an inspector on the Alaskan line. "This 
is the 'pay me later.' This is the price of deferred maintenance." 
</P>
<P>
Although company officials acknowledge difficulties, they insist that there is 
no crisis and that problems can be corrected without imperiling pipeline 
operations or the ecologically fragile tundra. "We aren't shutting down the 
line," said Bill Howitt, Alyeska's manager for engineering. "We're doing the 
repairs on the fly. We have sufficient early warning in this case. . . . We 
don't have pipeline integrity problems." 
</P>
<P>
But Jack Overly, head of the Western regional division of the federal Office of 
Pipeline Safety, had a different view. "The extent of it we don't know," Overly 
said of the corrosion problem, "but it's big enough that it could affect the 
integrity of the pipeline." 
</P>
<P>
Interviews with state, federal and company officials, as well as a check of 
federal records on the pipeline dating back to the early 1970s, indicate that: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Most of the corrosion was caused by the failure of protective coating and 
tape wraps, which many critics had warned were flawed long before the pipeline 
was finished. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Preparations for lab tests of corrosion protections were begun at the 
National Bureau of Standards before the pipeline started up. But the tests were 
never conducted. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Almost from the start, promises to conduct regular corrosion checks were 
not kept. During construction, the company said it would make regular runs with 
corrosion detecting "pigs," sensing devices designed to slide through the 
interior of the pipe and indicate thinning of the walls. Officials blamed 
technical problems, among them fears that a pig might get stuck and gum up the 
pipeline. Alyeska continued to develop more sophisticated pigs, but not until 
two years ago did equipment sensitive enough to detect significant amounts of 
corrosion come on-line. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Storage tank bottoms at the Valdez terminal are wearing through. Federal 
inspectors blame salty, untreated sea sand, which they say was used as landfill 
under the tanks in violation of normal construction principles. Since salt is 
highly corrosive, sea sand is usually washed with fresh water before it is used 
as a construction base. However, Alyeska officials insist that the tanks were 
built atop an asphalt base, not sand. 
</P>
<P>
Corrosion is a slow process that weakens metal over years. And both federal and 
industry experts agree that, on the basis of information they now have, the 
corrosion problems on the Alaska pipeline pose no immediate threat to the 
environment or to pipeline operations. 
</P>
<P>
Textbooks describe corrosion as an electrochemical phenomenon -- nature's way 
of trying to return refined metals to their natural state. Electromagnetic 
currents flow naturally through the Earth and enter submerged pipelines. When 
buried metal comes in contact with water or soil, those substances conduct 
current off the metal, gradually degrading it by stripping away electrons. 
</P>
<P>
For years, the oil and gas industry has tinkered with schemes to minimize or 
defeat the corrosion process. Although techniques vary, the primary weapons 
against corrosion are coatings and tapes to seal out moisture and so-called 
"cathodic protection" systems that divert the flow of natural current from the 
pipeline to sacrificial metals placed nearby, which bear the brunt of corrosive 
effects. 
</P>
<P>
As an important backup, operators periodically run internal corrosion sensing 
pigs through the pipelines. 
</P>
<P>
But it is the very adequacy of such safeguards -- as Alyeska adapted them to 
the harsh, technologically challenging Arctic climate -- that has been called 
into question by the latest findings. 
</P>
<P>
The primary concern is that, if it is unchecked, corrosion could eventually 
weaken the half-inch-thick, 48-inch-diameter pipe wall and lead to a blowout, 
spewing thousands of barrels of crude oil onto pristine wilderness and forcing 
a shutdown of the line. 
</P>
<P>
Until repairs can be completed, Alyeska has reduced pressure in the line by 20% 
in key locations. At the same time, the company has kept the oil flowing evenly 
at about 1.9 million barrels per day by injecting costly friction-reducing 
chemicals into the line. 
</P>
<P>
Despite such precautions, investigations into corrosion, maintenance, operating 
procedures and repair programs have been launched by Alaskan officials as well 
as several federal agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Alaska, where 85% to 90% of revenue in the state Treasury comes from 
oil-related income, has formally challenged Alyeska's 
</P>
<P>
plans to add corrosion repair costs to a complex formula used to determine the 
value of oil royalties and wellhead taxes. Baily estimated that such charges 
could cost Alaska $22 million in 1990 and "hundreds of millions of dollars" 
over the next five years. If negligence is to blame, then Alaska should not 
lose a penny, Baily argued. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, The Times has learned, the Office of Pipeline Safety, part of the 
Transportation Department, may decide by spring whether to cite Alyeska for 
violations of federal guidelines. OPS is the principle regulatory overseer for 
155,000 miles of gas and oil lines across the country. 
</P>
<P>
Although the OPS probe is not complete, staff reports have suggested that 
Alyeska may have violated federal safety regulations by failing to adequately 
maintain portions of its cathodic protection system. Another possible 
violation, according to the same reports, could involve improper welding and 
repair procedures used to install containment sleeves -- in effect, large metal 
bandages -- welded over problem areas on the pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
Federal investigators say the company, under revamped ownership and management, 
is now moving aggressively to deal with the problem and appears willing to 
spend whatever it takes to overhaul a structure that, before its completion, 
planners said would never need a major overhaul. Alyeska has increased the 
number of corrosion engineers on its staff over the last year from about six to 
75, according to OPS sources. 
</P>
<P>
The $7.7-billion line was built by a partnership of oil firms, among them 
industry giants Sohio, Arco, Exxon and Mobil. Three years ago, Sohio was 
absorbed by British Petroleum PLC. Through that takeover, the British 
conglomerate now owns slightly more than 50% of Alyeska and has become its 
dominant force. 
</P>
<P>
Alyeska's Howitt said that in 1988 and 1989, runs with the new, more sensitive 
"super-pigs" identified 827 so-called "anomalies" -- spots along the line that 
may indicate corrosion. But only closer scrutiny, generally digging up suspect 
spots of buried pipeline, can confirm if anomalies indicate real problems or 
are merely glitches recorded by the sensing device. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Howitt said, 308 suspect sites have been excavated, including all the 
company deemed most critical. Inspections at 30 of those locations revealed 
corrosion "so extensive that there was a danger the line couldn't support 
maximum pressures," he said. Protective sleeves were welded to those spots. 
</P>
<P>
Although half of the pipeline is buried and half sits above ground, Howitt said 
all potential corrosion problems detected so far involve buried sections. 
</P>
<P>
Howitt said the anomalies under investigation are not sprinkled throughout the 
pipeline but are bunched largely in four sections totaling about 13.5 miles. 
</P>
<P>
Howitt blamed most of the corrosion problems on a failure of the protective 
coating system applied to pipes, including both the outer tape wraps and an 
epoxy sealer known as Scotchkote 202. In testimony Wednesday before the Alaska 
Senate Oil and Gas Committee, Howitt declared: "If the tape outer wrap had not 
failed, we would not be here today." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Howitt cited several theories that could have contributed to 
coating problems: a bad batch of Scotchkote; bad pipes; shoddy application of 
sealer; installation during bouts of snow, rain and temperatures sometimes 
dipping to minus 30 degrees below zero; damage from rocks as ditches were 
filled in after pipes were laid, and even exposure to corrosive salt air when 
the raw pipes were shipped across oceans from suppliers abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Alyeska, he said, has scheduled a minimum of 2.5 days of service interruptions 
during the spring of 1991 to replace at least 9 miles of the most suspect pipe, 
in the Atigun River flood plain zone about 150 miles south of Prudhoe Bay, with 
new material. OPS officials, however, said they had been told the shutdown 
could last 10 days and said Alyeska had ordered 22 miles of new pipe as a 
backup. 
</P>
<P>
Such a program represents a major turnaround for Alyeska, which long had 
resisted shutdowns of any kind. In June, 1979, for example, 5,500 barrels of 
oil squirted from the line when ground subsidence buckled two underground 
sections, one of them in the Atigun mountain pass, another area were corrosion 
problems are suspected. Instead of replacing the damaged portions, Alyeska 
plugged the leaks by welding sleeves over the bad pipe. 
</P>
<P>
Defending the procedure in a later report on the incidents, the company pointed 
to what it said was the "infeasibility" of taking the line out of service to 
replace a cylinder of pipe. Such an operation, the company said, would have 
forced a shutdown of more than 10 days for each leak -- far longer than Alyeska 
now says it should take in 1991 for a much bigger job -- resulting in a loss of 
25.6 million barrels of production. 
</P>
<P>
"To replace that 25.6 million barrels on the world spot market would have 
increased the national imbalance of payments by about $1.25 billion," the 
company wrote in a follow-up report. 
</P>
<P>
At present, the company is also planning major overhauls of several of the 
dozen pump stations that keep oil moving through the line. Corrosion has 
attacked internal piping at many of the facilities. Repairs are also targeted 
for the corroded Valdez terminal tanks. 
</P>
<P>
Estimates of repair costs vary widely. Howitt guessed that the Atigun 
pipe-replacement program alone would cost $180 million. Reis, a federal 
inspector on the line, said Alyeska staff had told him that the price tag would 
run conservatively in the area of $250 million. 
</P>
<P>
Baily, the Alaska attorney general, says he has been told that the entire 
repair and maintenance bill over the next five years could reach $1.8 billion. 
This is significant to the state because Alaska stands to lose money if repair 
costs are subtracted from the net value of crude oil shipped to the Lower 48 
states. Alyeska puts the five-year figure at a slightly more modest $1.5 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe we have a middle-aged pipeline that's getting up to old age," Howitt 
said. "It can last indefinitely if it's carefully maintained, but like a house 
or a car, the older it gets the more expensive it's going to be to maintain." 
</P>
<P>
Howitt said Alyeska never expected the pipeline to remain corrosion free, but 
some critics remember it differently. They say that when it was trying to win 
construction approval, Alyeska said the line's planning was so intricate and 
quality so good that there was little likelihood it would suffer serious 
problems until the North Slope oil fields began to play out. "It was the 
general understanding that the pipeline had a useful life of 30 years -- and 
that meant 30 years without major renovation," Baily said. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since its conception in 1969, the Alaskan pipeline project was nagged with 
doubts about safety, quality and ecological impacts. It was the largest and 
most technologically complex construction project of any kind ever attempted. 
Engineers had little experience building a pipeline in such a harsh and fragile 
climate. 
</P>
<P>
Because of court challenges from environmentalists and other opponents, 
groundbreaking didn't get under way until 1974. By then, an Arab oil embargo 
and soaring oil prices had exposed the nation's growing dependence on foreign 
fuel sources. That gave the Alaskan project a new sense of urgency. 
</P>
<P>
"Back in '76 and '77, the attitude was that we will build this line at all 
costs," said George Tenley, the Washington-based director of the pipeline 
safety office. "The operator and the public got caught up in that passion to 
get that line going." 
</P>
<P>
By 1975, serious doubts had already been raised about the Scotchkote protective 
epoxy. It began flaking and chipping off some stockpiled pipe cylinders. And, 
it was learned, other pipelines in the Lower 48 states had experienced similar 
problems with the product. Alyeska sued the manufacturer, but the case was 
settled out of court and the records of the litigation sealed.

Rather than scrape off the suspect Scotchkote and start fresh, Alyeska won 
federal approval to add an extra layer of moisture-resistant tape. Critics at 
the time complained that the tape had not been adequately tested. Even worse, 
they charged, taping over a "disbonding" layer of epoxy might create an effect 
similar to wallpaper buckling and popping after being slapped over peeling 
paint. That could permit moisture and corrosion-enhancing bacteria to seep 
under the tape and migrate to bare metal. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever controversy the corrosion safeguards were generating, there was some 
doubt that they were necessary. The company argued, and some experts agreed, 
that a pipeline buried in permafrost would not have problems because frozen 
ground is a poor conductor of the electromagnetic currents that promote 
corrosion. 
</P>
<P>
But because the pipeline carries oil heated to around 140 degrees, it altered 
the characteristics of the soil. Bill Wilson, who monitored the construction as 
a consultant for the U.S. Interior Department, said the hot oil flow gradually 
created a "thermal bulb" of thawed subsoil that does conduct electricity.

MAJORITY FAVORS REFORM OF U.S. HEALTH CARE SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT STEINBROOK, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A solid majority of Americans favor fundamental reforms in the nation's health 
care system, such as a comprehensive national health insurance plan, mandatory 
employer-based coverage and long-term nursing home insurance, even if such 
changes required an increase in taxes, the Los Angeles Times Poll has found. 
</P>
<P>
While more than 90% of the 2,046 Americans interviewed in the national poll 
expressed satisfaction with their personal health care, more than half said the 
entire system needs "many improvements" or "fundamental overhauling." 
</P>
<P>
The twin causes of this dissatisfaction appear to be skyrocketing costs of 
health care and a lack of insurance or inadequate coverage for millions of 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Despite these problems, 69% of those surveyed believe that medical costs "can 
be substantially reduced" without affecting the quality of health care. And a 
similar majority believe the government should take the lead in both 
controlling costs and improving coverage and access to care. 
</P>
<P>
"There is widespread exasperation with what is perceived as truly unmanageable 
health care costs," said Times Poll Director I. A. Lewis. "But the public still 
thinks that overall, Americans receive the best health care in the world." 
</P>
<P>
While about 37 million Americans, or about 15% of the population, lack health 
insurance, the nation spent close to $600 billion on health care in 1989, or 
about 11.5% of the gross national product. The total expenditure, about $2,400 
per person per year, is one of the highest in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Writing in the New England Journal of Medicine last year, health economists 
Alain Enthoven and Richard Kronick of Stanford University termed the situation 
"a paradox of excess and deprivation." 
</P>
<P>
To reform the system, 72% of those surveyed in the Times poll said they would 
favor a comprehensive national health insurance plan; 66% voiced support for 
mandatory employer-based health insurance supplemented by government-sponsored 
health insurance for small business employees and the unemployed. Support for 
the proposals was broad-based, with the highest favor found among blacks, 
Latinos, the uninsured and those with incomes between $20,000 and $40,000 a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
In January, Gov. George Deukmejian proposed employer-paid health insurance for 
every California worker. The plan would provide coverage to about 4 million of 
the estimated 5.2 million people without health insurance in the state today. 
Some of those not covered by the plan include the unemployed, homeless and 
students who are not dependents of their parents. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, 65% of respondents to the Times poll said they favor long-term 
nursing home care coverage for all people over 65 years of age, regardless of 
their wealth. 
</P>
<P>
Those interviewed said they would be willing to pay an average of $107 in 
additional taxes to support expanded health insurance coverage for all 
Americans and an average of $154 in additional taxes to pay for long-term 
nursing home care. 
</P>
<P>
Three-fifths of those polled said "good health care is something all Americans 
are entitled to receive from the government." One-quarter of respondents said 
health care was "something people ought to pay for themselves" and 14% said 
they did not know. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly three-fifths of the respondents said the federal government should spend 
more on health care; one-third said it should spend about the same as it does 
now, and 4% said it should spend less. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last decade, medical care leaders and politicians have frequently 
proposed restructurings of the health care delivery system, but relatively few 
of the proposals, such as changes in the way physicians and hospitals are paid 
under the federal Medicare program, have been enacted. And, last year, Congress 
repealed one of the most far-reaching reforms, catastrophic illness coverage 
for the elderly and disabled under the Medicare program, in response to strong 
protests from some senior citizens who balked at their higher tax bills. 
</P>
<P>
The Times poll, a nationwide telephone survey of 2,046 Americans ages 18 and 
older, was conducted Jan. 21 to 24. The sampling error for a survey this size 
is three percentage points either way. This means that the results could vary 
three percentage points in either direction if every adult in the country had 
been interviewed in the same way. 
</P>
<P>
The poll showed that although a majority of Americans believe they have some 
control over the quality of their health care, relatively few believe that they 
can control the cost of care. 
</P>
<P>
When asked "How much control do you feel you personally have over the cost of 
the health care you receive?" 58% responded "hardly any" and 21% "not much." 
Only 13% said "some" and 6% "a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Respondents cited a number of reasons why health care in the United States is 
so expensive. The most frequent explanation, cited 39% of the time, was 
malpractice suits, followed by large doctors' fees (34%) and high hospital 
costs (32%). Other frequent explanations, cited by about one-fifth of 
respondents, were inadequate cost controls and unnecessary treatments and 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
The poll results also reflected some apparently contradictory views about the 
American health care system. 
</P>
<P>
For example, nearly two-thirds of those interviewed said Americans receive 
health care that is the "best in the world" or better than in most 
industrialized nations. And when informed that the United States spends 
substantially more of its national wealth on health care than Canada, West 
Germany and Great Britain, a similar majority said it is "worth the extra 
money." 
</P>
<P>
But when furnished with a description of the Canadian system of national health 
insurance, 66% of respondents said they preferred that; 25% said they preferred 
the American system and 9% did not know. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Canadian system, the government pays most of the cost of health care 
out of taxes, and it sets fees charged by doctors and hospitals; people can 
choose their own doctors and hospitals. Per-capita health care spending in 
Canada is about two-thirds what it is in the United States, although life 
expectancy is longer and infant mortality less in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis said the poll was measuring "two fairly strong opinions" -- "national 
pride," including the belief that American physicians practice good medicine, 
and "costs which are driving people crazy." 
</P>
<P>
On a more personal level, respondents said that only about half of the time do 
doctors diagnose ailments correctly on the first visit to the office. By the 
second visit, four out of five doctors find out what is actually wrong, and by 
the third visit, nine out of 10 doctors have gotten it right. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, many people seem to lack confidence in their doctors' ability to 
treat ailments. More than half think doctors are too quick to prescribe drugs. 
One in 10 thinks a doctor too often withholds drugs. Only about 22% think 
doctors prescribe the right amount. 
</P>
<P>
In other findings: 
</P>
<P>
* Health care ranked fifth when respondents were asked to identify the most 
important problem facing the United States today. The most frequently 
identified problems were drug abuse, cited by 64% of respondents, and crime, 
cited by 26% of respondents. The federal deficit was cited by 19% of those 
interviewed, the economy by 16% and health care by 14%. 
</P>
<P>
* President Bush received substantially higher marks for overall performance 
than for his performance on health care issues. In total, 77% of respondents 
said they approved "strongly" or "somewhat" of "the way George Bush is handling 
his job as President." Fifteen percent voiced disapproval and 8% did not know. 
By contrast, only 34% of respondents voiced approval for Bush's performance on 
health care issues; 35% said they disapproved and 31% did not know.

$343 MILLION IN COCAINE SEIZED IN FULLERTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In what law enforcement officials said was the largest narcotics bust in Orange 
County history, more than two tons of cocaine were seized Friday night from a 
Fullerton warehouse described as a distribution center for the drug. 
</P>
<P>
No arrests were made in the raid, but FBI agents believe the 4,719 pounds of 
cocaine came from sophisticated drug cartels operating in South America. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities estimated the cache has a street value of $343.2 million. They said 
an investigation is continuing into the operators of the cocaine warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
While not as large as the record 21.4-ton cocaine seizure in Sylmar last 
September, Friday's raid underscores the fact that Orange County has joined Los 
Angeles County as a major drug trafficking area, local police officials said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation in the Fullerton case lasted more than a month and culminated 
Friday, when authorities obtained a search warrant for the warehouse, located 
in the 700 block of State College Boulevard near several auto shops and retail 
businesses, Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the warehouse, officials said they found the cocaine wrapped in boxes 
and stacked onto wooden pallets inside a white GMC truck. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities believe the drugs were about to be moved from the truck to two 
smaller vehicles that would have taken the cocaine to other locations. No one 
was inside the warehouse at the time of the raid, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas R. Parker, a Los Angeles-based assistant special agent, said the amount 
of cocaine seized suggests that the drugs were to be sold not just in Orange 
County, but throughout the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The cocaine packages bore distinctive marks, such as red stars and green 
blocks, which FBI officials say can be traced to cocaine cartels operating in 
parts of South America. But officials refused to specify which cartels. 
</P>
<P>
"These cartels work like major corporations. They have their own subsidiaries 
and their own markings (for the cocaine)," Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County and the rest of Southern California have seen an increase in drug 
traffic in recent years partly because of successful efforts to keep drugs out 
of the south Florida area, Parker said.

Salman Rushdie, in hiding for nearly a year since the Ayatollah Ruhollah 
Khomeini of Iran ordered his death, said in an interview published Saturday 
that he misses ordinary pleasures like driving a car and going to the movies. 
</P>
<P>
In a 90-minute telephone interview with Newsweek, Rushdie also said he feels 
that if his novel "The Satanic Verses" is not issued in paperback, then the 
death order and the campaign against the book will have succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
Khomeini ordered Muslims a year ago to kill Rushdie for blaspheming Islam in 
the surrealistic novel. The Indian-born author went into hiding in Britain last 
Feb. 14. Khomeini died last June 3, but Iran did not lift the order, and 
Rushdie has remained in hiding under police protection. He has refused 
interviews until agreeing to call Newsweek from his hiding place.

BULGARIAN ECONOMIST REPLACES HARD-LINE LEADER

SOFIA, Bulgaria 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Parliament on Saturday elected an economist to replace a hard-line Communist as 
prime minister, and the new leader promised immediate reforms to combat 
Bulgaria's "social and economic crisis." 
</P>
<P>
Petar Beron, a leader of the emerging democratic opposition, described the new 
prime minister, Andrei Lukanov, as "a good choice" and left open the 
possibility that some opposition members might join a coalition government. 
</P>
<P>
The election, the latest development in a wave of changes, came one day after 
the Communist Party expelled many of the old orthodox Communists and picked 
another advocate of change as party chief. 
</P>
<P>
Lukanov's government is scheduled to hold power until free elections are held 
in May. 
</P>
<P>
The National Assembly unanimously chose Lukanov as prime minister after 
accepting the resignation of Georgi Atanassov and his 22-member Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
Lukanov, a 51-year-old economist with years of experience in government and 
Communist Party politics, said he is accepting the post at a time of "moral and 
economic crisis." 
</P>
<P>
He later told reporters that his new government will liberalize the news media. 
He asked for "constructive criticism by the press" and "complete objectivity." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently to underline the new leadership's more open media policy, Filip 
Bokov announced his resignation as head of state radio and television, a 
position he has held for less than three months. 
</P>
<P>
The official news agency BTA said the reason for his resignation was his 
appointment to the new Communist Party Presidium. 
</P>
<P>
Lukanov and his reform-minded colleagues -- new party chief Alexander Lilov and 
President Petar Mladenov -- face public skepticism about their commitment to 
reform, as well as their ability to handle a flagging economy hobbled by 
unprecedented labor unrest. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to make fundamental economic reforms, and we have to do it 
immediately," he said. "The social and economic crisis is now the most 
important thing, and it is the most important task to come out of the crisis." 
He said he will detail his recovery plan in a speech to the National Assembly 
on Thursday.

BAKER TO OFFER NEW ARMS PROPOSALS; 
</P>
<P>
DIPLOMACY: THE PACKAGE WILL INCLUDE A COMPROMISE ON AIR-LAUNCHED CRUISE 
MISSILES. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III will take "a good package" of arms 
proposals to Moscow this week, including ideas that go beyond the agreed 
agenda, in an effort to complete the START nuclear weapons treaty this year, 
U.S. officials said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Baker, who leaves Monday for East Europe and the Soviet Union, will spend three 
days with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze discussing the START 
treaty, which would cut by half the number of offensive nuclear warheads in the 
superpower arsenals. 
</P>
<P>
In talks beginning Wednesday, Baker will offer a compromise to settle the 
longstanding issue of how to count air-launched cruise missiles and will 
propose a limit on the number of warheads that can be carried on mobile, 
land-based ballistic missiles, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon also wants Baker to propose counting some of the warheads on 
Soviet mobile missiles against the warhead limit on Soviet fixed, silo-based 
ICBMs -- the weapons most threatening to the United States in a nuclear war, 
according to officials. 
</P>
<P>
Whether President Bush and his top Cabinet officers agreed to the Pentagon 
proposal when they met Thursday was not known. But the consensus among 
officials and non-government experts familiar with the concept is that Moscow 
is unlikely to accept it because the restraints would affect only Soviet 
forces. The United States has no such mobile missiles at present. 
</P>
<P>
Baker, moreover, has opposed general calls by conservative politicians and arms 
experts to make radical new demands on the Soviets in the belief that they are 
"on the run" and would now accept offers they previously rejected. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he has shunned proposals that might threaten to derail or delay 
significantly the START -- Strategic Arms Reduction Talks -- treaty. Both Bush 
and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev want to have the pact settled in 
principle at their next summit in June and fully completed by the end of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The correct approach, Baker has said, is to "lock in" the treaty, already 
almost 90% completed, "while we have the opportunity," a reference to 
Gorbachev's apparent willingness to finish the process. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast with some previous negotiating sessions, the American team hopes to 
avoid disclosing many of its new ideas if they are unacceptable to the Soviets, 
in order not to create new obstacles or poison the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
"The aim this time will be to get results, not to demonstrate any 'bold new 
thinking' to the public," one official said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
While strategic nuclear arms will be the main topic of the trip, Baker also is 
expected during his four-day stay in Moscow to provide greater detail about 
Bush's new proposal to slash U.S. and Soviet troop strength in Central and 
Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
In his State of the Union address, Bush proposed ceilings of 195,000 troops for 
each nation in Central and Eastern Europe, but he also said the United States 
would retain an additional 30,000 troops in Britain, Turkey and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin, as expected, expressed opposition to the inequality built into the 
scheme even though, in principle, the Soviets could station 30,000 troops in 
southeastern European nations such as Romania and Bulgaria in addition to the 
195,000 in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
That possibility, however, is considered unrealistic because those nations have 
never had Soviet forces and because of the ousting of pro-Soviet governments in 
the region's current upheaval. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, according to one source, the Bush proposal would not bind the United 
States to a ceiling of 30,000 outside the so-called central zone in Europe. 
That figure is considered a "force projection," meaning an expectednumber that 
could be increased at will. 
</P>
<P>
Baker, who will meet with Gorbachev and appear before a foreign affairs 
committee of the Supreme Soviet legislative body later in the week, also is 
expected to discuss with Soviet leaders the implications of the continuing 
upheavals in former Soviet Bloc nations. 
</P>
<P>
German reunification, to which Gorbachev now appears to be less opposed than 
last month, will be a prime topic as both superpowers seek to keep the process 
of bringing East and West Germany together both gradual and peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his sessions with Soviet officials, Baker will confer briefly 
with French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas during a refueling stop in Ireland, 
spend a day in Prague meeting with President Vaclav Havel and other leaders of 
the new government in Czechoslovakia, and stop in Ottawa, Canada, to attend a 
conference of North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Warsaw Pact officials. 
</P>
<P>
But the centerpiece of the secretary of state's diplomatic excursion will be 
the START negotiations, where significant differences remain despite the large 
degree of agreement already achieved. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides already have agreed to a limit of 6,000 nuclear weapons, such as 
warheads, for each side. Of these, a maximum of 4,900 could be carried on 
ballistic missiles, with the rest on air-launched cruise missiles (ALCMs) and 
in bombers. 
</P>
<P>
Several other sub-limits of significance have been set. No more than 3,300 
warheads could be carried on land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles 
(ICBMs), and no more than 1,540 could be on very large ICBMs. Only the Soviets 
have these "heavy" ICBMs, each of which carries 10 warheads. 
</P>
<P>
Baker is expected to propose another sub-limit of between 700 and 1,000 
warheads on mobile land-based missiles. The Soviets already have rail-mobile 
and road-mobile missiles, while the United States is preparing to build both 
types. But in case Congress allows neither, the Pentagon wants Baker to propose 
that all multiple warheads on land-based missiles be counted against the 1,540 
limit on "heavies." 
</P>
<P>
Baker also will seek to nail down what has been a very elusive "counting rule" 
for ALCMs carried on bombers. The United States wants to attribute a fixed 
number of ALCMs to all bombers of a certain kind, such as 10 ALCMs on every 
B-52. The Soviets, in contrast, want to count all the ALCMs that each bomber is 
equipped to carry, such as 20 for the B-52. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon strongly favors the U.S. counting proposal, in part because 
bombers seldom carry their maximum payload. Moreover, it does not know how many 
B-2 Stealth bombers Congress will allow it to buy. Those planes were to be used 
for penetration missions inside the Soviet Union. If significantly fewer B-2s 
are bought than initially planned, the military wants the flexibility to load 
more ALCMs on B-52s to make up for any B-2 shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
Baker is expected to propose a compromise in which, if the Soviets accept the 
U.S. counting principle, the United States would accept Soviet demands for a 
greater limitation on the range of the ALCMs. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow wanted all nuclear ALCMs with a range of more than 600 kilometers (375 
miles) to be counted, while Washington wanted the range limit set at 1,500 
kilometers (925 miles). A possible outcome, an official said, would be a 
slightly higher ALCM count, such as 12 for the B-52, in exchange for a range 
limit of 1,000 kilometers (500 miles) or even less.

Mayor Sidney Barthelemy won a second term in a primary election Saturday over a 
white challenger after a campaign marked on both sides by accusations of 
race-baiting. 
</P>
<P>
With 425 of 465 precincts -- 91.3% -- reporting, Barthelemy had 71,716 votes, 
or 55%, to 57,066, or 44%, for his fellow Democrat Donald Mintz. 
</P>
<P>
Two other candidates drew votes of 1% or less. 
</P>
<P>
Barthelemy avoided a runoff by winning more than half of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
"We are in difficult times. We have laid the foundations for the future. But we 
cannot build a great city divided," said Barthelemy, 47. "We all must work 
together." 
</P>
<P>
The black mayor, who spent 16 years in politics without losing an election, 
faced a strong challenge from Mintz, who was making his first run for office. 
The vote was expected to split along racial lines. 
</P>
<P>
Barthelemy's easygoing, conciliatory style contrasted with the hard-hitting 
intensity of Mintz, who resigned as head of the city's dock board to enter the 
race.

NORIEGA ATTORNEYS FAVOR SEVERING TRIAL OF 5 OTHERS;

DRUG CHARGES: THE DEFENSE TEAMS OF THE EX-DICTATOR AND OF HIS CO-DEFENDANTS 
WANT CASES HANDLED SEPARATELY.

<P>
Attorneys for Manuel A. Noriega are privately encouraging a move by five of his 
co-defendants to obtain a separate, earlier trial on grounds that they should 
not suffer from the adverse publicity that has surrounded the deposed 
Panamanian dictator. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega's former associates have asked a federal judge to sever them from the 
main narcotics conspiracy case on grounds they would be unfairly exposed to 
prejudice if they were tried along with an "internationally notorious figure," 
as one attorney put it. 
</P>
<P>
But according to lawyers for two of the co-defendants, Noriega's defense team 
has its own reasons for favoring severance, an issue that U.S. District Judge 
William M. Hoeveler is expected to decide sometime this month. 
</P>
<P>
A separate and presumably earlier trial of the general's five former associates 
could work to Noriega's advantage by exposing weaknesses in the testimony of 
government witnesses who later would be called upon to testify against Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
One such witness is Floyd Carlton-Caceres, a pilot and one-time confidant of 
Noriega who has claimed he flew cocaine shipments from Colombia to Panama and 
brought bundles of U.S. currency to Noriega from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Carlton also would be a key witness against Lt. Col. Luis A. del Cid, a former 
high-ranking friend of Noriega in the Panama Defense Forces and the most 
important co-defendant presently in U.S. custody, according to Del Cid's 
lawyer, Samuel I. Burstyn. 
</P>
<P>
"I guarantee you I will score some hits on Carlton," Burstyn said in an 
interview. "I would plan to keep him on the witness stand three or four days to 
develop inconsistencies in his testimony." 
</P>
<P>
Carlton said in testimony before the U.S. Senate in 1988 that he delivered more 
than $200,000 to Del Cid at PDF headquarters for transmission to Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
Burstyn said he also might call Jose I. Blandon, who once worked for Noriega as 
U.S. consul general, to testify about the limits of Del Cid's knowledge. 
Blandon is considered a key prosecution witness against Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
Two lawyers in the case who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that 
Noriega attorneys Frank A. Rubino and Steven Collin are hoping that the 
co-defendants will obtain a severance and have promised specific help to some 
of them. 
</P>
<P>
That help would include an affidavit or testimony from Noriega attesting to 
their lack of criminal involvement, the attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
Burstyn and Richard A. Sharpstein, who represents co-defendant Brian Alden 
Davidow, an accused American cocaine smuggler, said they are asking for 
severances to avoid the "spill-over effects" of adverse publicity about Noriega 
and because their defenses are "antagonistic" to that of Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to be part of that three-ring circus, especially if the general 
is planning to admit to all the crimes and say he did it with the sanction of 
the U.S. government," Burstyn said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our defenses are going to be very distinct (from Noriega's)," Sharpstein 
added, referring to Davidow and other co-defendants. "We're going to deny the 
crimes." 
</P>
<P>
Noriega's lawyers have said they plan to base their defense on the general's 
former status as an informant for the CIA and Drug Enforcement Administration 
and evidence that Noriega's allegedly illicit activities were approved by U.S. 
intelligence agencies. 
</P>
<P>
To establish such evidence, Rubino and Collin plan to seek access to top-secret 
U.S. government files, a process that is expected to take many months of court 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
Burstyn and Sharpstein said their clients, and, they believed, the other 
co-defendants, could be ready for trial by next month -- long before the time 
that Noriega's legal team has said it would be prepared. 
</P>
<P>
The other co-defendants are pilots Daniel Miranda and Eduardo Pardo, and 
William Saldarriaga, an alleged smuggler. 
</P>
<P>
On the issue of severance, Noriega's lawyers have not taken a public position. 
They could not be reached last week for comment.

WHO SHOULD PAY FOR HEALTH CARE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sharon Bernstein, Sharon Bernstein is a free-lance journalist 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For years, the concepts of universal health insurance and public funding for 
health care were the sole province of the left. But with the cost of care 
skyrocketing -- with rates for some types of insurance rising as much as 50% 
per year -- business leaders such as Chrysler Chairman Lee A. Iacocca as well 
as conservative politicians have begun to join such liberals as Sen. Edward M. 
Kennedy (D-Mass.) in calling for a national health-care program. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, Gov. George Deukmejian is the latest conservative leader to 
take up the cry, proposing last month that employers should be required to 
provide health insurance for their workers and that government should lend a 
hand. An estimated one in five Californians lacks coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 For a debate on national health policy, free-lance journalist Sharon Bernstein 
interviewed a leading proponent of health-care reform, Walter B. Maher, 
director of federal relations for Chrysler's human relations office. 
Interviewed for the opposing view was Devon Blaine, head of the California 
chapter of Small Business United, a national organization of small firms. In 
separate interviews, they responded to the same questions and were allowed to 
rebut each other's views. 
</P>
<P>
 * Do California and the nation need a coordinated health-care policy? 
</P>
<P>
Maher: Yes. We have never established any type of policy. We have a very 
fragmented system, totally uncoordinated, and the result is just an appallingly 
high rate of expenditures. Even the medical academics agree with this. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. spends 40% more per capita for health care than the second most 
expensive country, Canada. Not 40% more than the average country, 40% more than 
No. 2. Were we to get our costs in line with our wealth, we would be spending 
over $100 billion a year less than we are currently spending, and that makes 
this peace dividend pale by comparison. 
</P>
<P>
Blaine: I don't think we need anything beyond what we have. There are some 
things to be resolved, but I'm not sure what is possible, and I like to see as 
little government intervention as possible. 
</P>
<P>
* If there is to be government intervention in health care, what form should it 
take? 
</P>
<P>
Blaine: Government certainly cannot afford any additional burden, so looking at 
them providing care or paying for it is not an alternative. If anything, it 
should look at ways to control costs, such as limiting awards in malpractice 
suits or defective-product suits. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the government should intervene in those hardship cases where people 
truly cannot afford insurance and have the need. 
</P>
<P>
Maher: The government can establish standards for public and private programs 
so that everybody is playing by the same general rules. And when setting rules, 
part of the objective should be to keep the costs of health care reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
In the public sector, that would mean that Medicaid should pay fairly, and no 
less than a private-sector program pays for a hospital stay. Otherwise, that 
unpaid cost gets shifted to people using private-sector plans. Also, Medicaid 
should be expanded to cover all of the poor. We should have uniform Medicaid 
programs nationwide. And we can expand Medicaid or some of the other publicly 
funded programs to permit the nearly poor to buy into that program on some sort 
of a subsidized basis. It may make sense to consider having these public 
programs available for anybody who wants to buy into them. 
</P>
<P>
If they're not going to do that, then the only role for government is to assume 
a more dominant posture in the administration of health care, such as you see 
in Canada or France. In those countries the government, either centrally or in 
partnership with provinces, directly administers the program. I don't see any 
other choice if we are to address the cost-control end, the need to provide 
access to care for all citizens while maintaining quality of care. 
</P>
<P>
* Should businesses be required to provide health care for employees? 
</P>
<P>
Blaine: Small business does not need one more financial burden. Cash flow is 
extremely tight. 
</P>
<P>
Let's assume that it is required. How is it going to be policed? They're going 
to have to have lots of people checking up on employers. It's expensive to 
implement, and if it's not implemented, then it's a meaningless law. In the 
state of California it's required that drivers have automobile insurance, but 
we all know that not everyone does. 
</P>
<P>
For some of us, requiring health benefits will do nothing because we already 
provide it. A lot of enlightened employers realize that providing benefits such 
as group medical insurance is one of the ways to be competitive where hiring is 
concerned. On the other hand, there are a number of companies that do not have 
a policy of providing health care for their employees. If they are required to 
do so, that could result in a financial hardship that could result in loss of 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Maher: Sure, companies can reduce their health-care costs by laying off 
employees. But California and the U.S. government can't put a bunch of people 
on boats as a way of reducing our health-care costs; at least we shouldn't do 
that. 
</P>
<P>
Under any system that the country ends up with, business is going to be a major 
contributor. In Germany and Japan, business is a major contributor. It's just 
not appropriate for American companies to wash their hands and expect some kind 
of government fairy godmother to take care of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Blaine: I believe in people assuming responsibility for themselves. Buying 
one's own insurance is an option if the employer doesn't provide it, and there 
already are government programs to help people who can't afford that. And some 
employers are giving employees money to use for health plans. Some use it to 
buy insurance, and others just keep the extra money. 
</P>
<P>
Assuming this is mandated, what's next? If employers are asked to be Mama and 
Papa or Big Brother by providing health insurance, what will we be asked to do 
next for our employees? 
</P>
<P>
I also think government needs to run the government well before it attempts to 
run other businesses. And I also am not a supporter of the government competing 
with privately owned businesses. 
</P>
<P>
* All of the proposals for universal health insurance involve some sort of 
government expense or subsidy. Where will the money come from? 
</P>
<P>
Maher: Obviously there will be a need for some dollars. Government-run programs 
don't pull money out of thin air; they collect it from people. 
</P>
<P>
In France, they have a centralized program. The taxes are collected 
predominantly by employers and employees in the form of a payroll tax. In 
Canada, the system is supported through income and sales taxes. Either way, 
business is a major contributor. 
</P>
<P>
* Is it really necessary to do something about this now? What's the next step? 
</P>
<P>
Blaine: It's not a crisis. It's an issue of grave concern. I really believe 
there is a need to thoroughly study the issue. I have not heard of a study that 
has thoroughly explored it. I think we need to look at history to indicate how 
we got to where we are today and how to correct it. 
</P>
<P>
The government ought to conduct the study. They're masters at conducting 
studies. I would probably suggest that whoever is working on this issue go back 
five or 10 years and look at what was occurring then and how it differs from 
today. This was not a major issue 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Maher: We've been working at this problem for all of the '80s -- actually, 
before that. We've been able to do a lot of analysis. We've been able to 
implement a lot of policies. But we are still far away from containing these 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
This problem is so insidious. It has crept up over 30 years. It's obviously 
impacting the costs of goods and services. It's impacting taxes. It's impacting 
the fact that government is strapped for money and unable to pay for schools 
and infrastructure. It's impacting our standard of living. Companies don't have 
the money for pay raises, so people feel it that way. 
</P>
<P>
And there's a distressing amount of apathy. For example, in the State of the 
Union message, the very last issue addressed by the President was health. 
</P>
<P>
It gets to the fact that most people are still pretty well off in this country 
and just aren't really raising holy hell about health care. And unless there's 
some holy hell raising on the other side, why irritate the doctors and 
hospitals and providers, all of whom are big powers? We've got to educate the 
public as to how important this is.

TIMES BOARD OF ECONOMISTS: WHY BASHING THE FED DOESN'T PAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN H. MELTZER, ALLAN H. MELTZER is John M. Olin Professor of Political 
Economy at Carnegie Mellon University and a visiting scholar at the American 
Enterprise Institute.

<TEXT>
<P>
Inflation has been stuck in the 4% to 5% range since the mid-1980s. At this 
rate, prices double about every 15 years and the purchasing power of the 
public's cash balances is cut in half. The loss in value is transferred to the 
government just as if a direct tax had been levied on cash balances. 
</P>
<P>
Also with inflation, corporations replace their machinery and other productive 
capital at ever higher prices. Since corporate depreciation allowances that 
provide for the replacement of productive capital are not corrected for 
inflation, inflation also acts as a tax on productive investment and raises the 
cost of capital. The problem is most acute for manufacturing firms that have 
little debt outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
These are among the many ways that inflation transfers wealth and harms 
producers and consumers. If U.S. inflation is higher than inflation in other 
major centers, such as Germany and Japan, the dollar becomes a less stable and, 
therefore, less desirable international currency. 
</P>
<P>
The only way to avoid these costs is to reduce inflation until prices are 
stable and then keep them stable. Absolute stability is not possible in a free 
economy and, fortunately, it isn't necessary. As a nation, we can achieve 
nearly all the benefits of price stability if, on average, prices fluctuate 
modestly from month to month or year to year and are widely expected to remain 
stable. Stability, in this sense, should be our goal. 
</P>
<P>
To achieve that goal under current conditions, the Federal Reserve must keep 
the growth rate of the money that it directly controls -- called the monetary 
base -- about equal to the maintained average growth rate of real output. 
Unless that happens, long-term control of inflation will not be achieved. 
Recently, Federal Reserve officials, including Chairman Alan Greenspan and 
President Lee Hoskins of the Cleveland Fed, have taken the remarkable step of 
advocating price stability as the Fed's main goal. Just as important, the Fed 
has brought the annual growth of the money base into the range that is 
consistent with stable prices. If the Fed keeps money growth where it has been 
for the past year, we will be close to price stability in about two years. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration favored a return to price stability when the President 
took office. Recent statements, however, suggest that much of what was said 
then has been forgotten. First the President's spokesman and then the President 
have taken turns urging the Fed to lower interest rates. Translated, that means 
faster money growth, a "temporary" setting aside of the goal of price 
stability. The Administration, facing congressional elections next November and 
a possible recession this winter, seems willing to defer the return to price 
stability, perhaps indefinitely. It would like more monetary stimulus now, 
lower interest rates and, perhaps, a lower value for the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
This is a mistake -- an often-repeated one -- but a mistake nonetheless. Faster 
money growth now will not permanently lower long-term interest rates and may 
not lower them at all. As soon as people recognize that the Fed has turned from 
its commitment to achieve price stability to pursue other objectives, interest 
rates on long-term securities will rise. The rise will reflect the belief that 
inflation will continue and may even increase. 
</P>
<P>
Experience here and in other countries bears this out. Countries with the 
lowest rates of inflation have the lowest market interest rates, and countries 
with the highest rates of inflation have the highest interest rates. The way to 
bring interest rates down, therefore, is to stick to the monetary policy that 
the Fed has followed. If the President wants interest rates to fall and remain 
lower, he should support, not oppose, the Fed's anti-inflation policies. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s, criticisms of the Fed -- known as Fed bashing -- became a major 
activity of government. President Lyndon B. Johnson was so disturbed by a small 
rise in interest rates in 1965 that he summoned then Chairman William McChesney 
Martin to his Texas ranch for a bashing. At the time, interest rates on 
long-term home mortgages were about 5% and inflation was about 2%. The Fed 
caved in, possibly without intending to do so. Money growth increased, and 
interest rates rose. In large measure, the higher rates of inflation 
experienced since 1965 are a result of mistaken attempts to keep interest rates 
from rising. 
</P>
<P>
There is a paradox. The more effort the Fed (or the President) gives to trying 
to hold interest rates down by raising money growth, the higher the interest 
rates are likely to be. If the Administration and the President truly want 
lower interest rates, they should stop bashing the Fed. 
</P>
<P>
They would be wise to do so. Recent Fed policy has been remarkably good. Since 
Greenspan became chairman in the summer of 1987, year-to-year money growth -- 
measured broadly or narrowly -- has been reduced to a modest, non-inflationary 
rate. Early in Greenspan's tenure as chairman, the Fed moved to offset the 
inflationary monetary policies of 1985-86, part of the Fed's and Treasury's 
mistaken efforts to lower the value of the dollar. Because the effects of money 
growth on inflation operate with a lag of two to three years, the mistaken 
policies of 1986 contributed to the rise in inflation last year. By the time 
inflation began to rise, however, the Fed's disinflationary monetary policy had 
been in place for two years, so the 1989 increase in inflation was modest. 
</P>
<P>
With midterm congressional elections, Administration anxiety, a possible 
recession and rising unemployment in the next few months, Fed bashing is bound 
to increase this year. If the Fed gives in to the political pressure and lets 
money growth increase, we will have returned to the stop-and-go policies of the 
1960s and 1970s that produced even higher inflation and unemployment each 
cycle. Long-term interest rates will rise, and the dollar will depreciate 
against the currencies of countries with lower inflation, such as Germany and 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Which way will we go: toward price stability or higher inflation? Recent money 
growth has been higher than last year's average. One can only hope that this is 
a temporary bulge, not the start of a trend toward a higher rate of increase. 
If money growth remains at last year's annual rate, this year will be the 
beginning of the end for the inflation of the past 25 years. Much of the work 
has been done. A recession, if it should occur, is likely to be short and, in 
any case, cannot be avoided by monetary actions taken now. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the costs of getting inflation down have been paid or soon will be. 
Some pain must still be borne as real estate prices and other inflation hedges 
adjust to reflect lower expected inflation. The benefits are within reach. It 
would be a shame if they are thrown away once again.

LEGAL ON THE OUTSIDE, SCAM ON THE INSIDE

<TEXT>
<P>
Because of the F. D. Roberts Securities case, investigators are getting a 
unique opportunity to see how a typical penny stock scam is put together. And 
what they are finding is enlightening: The people who operated F. D. Roberts 
were on the up-and-up in their handling of prospectuses and other documents 
that went to the Securities and Exchange Commission. But they were anything but 
truthful with the public. 
</P>
<P>
"They went through all the motions," said one investigator familiar with the 
case. The only trouble was that "very few people who invested ever got a 
prospectus," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
The only things that investors got were slick sales pitches, some high-pressure 
sales tactics, maybe a deceptive brochure and a lot of lies. Even the most 
naive investor probably wouldn't have sent F. D. Roberts a dime if he or she 
had seen what the brokerage firm was telling the SEC. 
</P>
<P>
Take Innovative Business Corp. as an example. 
</P>
<P>
Through F. D. Roberts, the company sold to the public 2,000 units -- with each 
unit consisting of 10,000 shares of company stock plus 10,000 common stock 
purchase warrants. Each unit was priced at $500 -- making the total offering 
worth $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
F. D. Roberts took a generous 10% fee from the money raised. And of the 
$900,000 earmarked for the company -- which was supposed to be in the market 
for corporate acquisitions -- another $100,000 would be gobbled up by expenses. 
</P>
<P>
That left Innovative Business with $800,000, which the prospectus clearly 
stated "may not be sufficient to complete one acquisition." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said they don't believe that Innovative Business ever made an 
acquisition. But the company's stock, they said, still rose shortly after the 
initial public offering. And F. D. Roberts made a fortune. 
</P>
<P>
Integrated Business Corp. was an even crazier scheme. 
</P>
<P>
Its prospectus said the company had obtained an option to acquire a franchise 
from the U.S. Basketball League Inc. to operate a team in Tampa, Fla. Through 
F. D. Roberts, the company sold 12.5 million units at 2 cents each. Of the 
$250,000 raised, the prospectus said, only $210,000 would probably go to the 
company. And $30,000, or 13.5% of the total proceeds, would go to pay company 
executives. 
</P>
<P>
But that wasn't the worst part. The prospectus also stated that there were 
already 32.5 million shares outstanding -- presumably held by company insiders 
who cooked up the scheme. 
</P>
<P>
That meant that as soon as the initial offering was completed, the value of the 
units being sold to the public would automatically decline from the original 2 
cents to half a cent. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, through market manipulation on the part of F. D. Roberts, the 
company's virtually worthless shares were being quoted at prices far exceeding 
the level of the initial public offering, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
But F. D. Roberts wasn't content just to make a sizable fee from taking these 
companies public. The companies typically would have friends and relatives of 
F. D. Roberts officials in top positions, drawing nice salaries. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors have also charged that F. D. Roberts and its brokers reaped huge 
commissions by trading excessively in clients' accounts. And, in manipulating 
the price of these stocks higher, F. D. Roberts was guaranteeing itself a 
bundle since Roberts officials have also been charged with illegally purchasing 
shares for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
F. D. Roberts, moreover, made it very difficult for the public to sell its 
stock. F. D. Roberts officials, their friends and relatives, on the other hand, 
had no trouble selling their stock holdings, officials said. This essentially 
created a pyramid scheme in which only a chosen few could capitalize on the 
manipulation of a stock's price. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, F. D. Roberts was in the habit of granting to itself, at 
virtually no cost, warrants to purchase shares in most of the companies that it 
took public. This gave F. D. Roberts yet another way to cash in on its 
manipulation. JOHN CRUDELE

<P>
When Scotty Lyons answered a tiny help-wanted advertisement for a stockbroker 
that he saw in his local Florida newspaper, he wouldn't have guessed that he'd 
end up working for the Mob. 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't too long after getting that high-paying job at F. D. Roberts 
Securities Inc. in Boca Raton, Fla., that Lyons -- whose name has been changed 
here -- realized that the stocks he was peddling to gullible investors 
nationwide were worthless and that, more ominously, he had unknowingly become a 
participant in one of organized crime's hottest new schemes -- securities 
fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Even the most naive employee apparently knew of F. D. Roberts' underworld 
affiliation -- a connection that certain officials of the now-closed brokerage 
have admitted in court. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the low-level employees didn't care that they were working for the Mob, 
Lyons says. Others were such novices in the securities business that perhaps 
they didn't realize that what they were doing was very illegal. 
</P>
<P>
But all of the workers knew one thing. "Everybody knew not to screw with them," 
says Lyons now, months after having quit the "brokerage" business. "The 
intimidation factor was tremendous." 
</P>
<P>
Lyons agreed to discuss how he was recruited into a seemingly legitimate 
brokerage that federal prosecutors allege was nothing more than a business 
subsidiary of the New York-based Gambino organized crime family, which is 
reputedly headed by John Gotti. In return, some of the details about Lyons' 
past have been disguised, so that he doesn't have to have a reunion with his 
old employers. 
</P>
<P>
To start with, nobody really knows how deeply organized crime has infiltrated 
the business of selling penny stocks to the public, but several of the major 
crime families are believed to dabble in the business. There have been hearings 
before Congress about the matter, and investigators say the link between the 
Mob and the selling of worthless securities has been growing in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Why? "It's such a fertile field," says Joseph G. Braunreuther, assistant U.S. 
attorney in Newark, N.J., where penny stock fraud prosecutions have become a 
specialty. "There is a lot of money to be made in the financial markets," he 
adds. 
</P>
<P>
Members of organized crime, of course, are not the only ones selling worthless 
stocks in bogus companies. There are thousands of enterprising thieves around 
the nation who -- with the aid of a printing press, a telephone and a deft 
sales pitch -- are selling securities that give new meaning to the phrase "junk 
market." 
</P>
<P>
Not all penny stocks are worthless. Some legitimate companies do start out 
small, with their stocks worth a fraction of what an established company's 
shares would be worth. 
</P>
<P>
But the case of F. D. Roberts -- which is being prosecuted successfully in New 
Jersey, the company's state of incorporation -- provides a unique peek into the 
role of the Mob in penny stock frauds. (The company formerly had branches in 
Los Angeles and Desert Hot Springs.) 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors say organized crime brings a special talent to the stock fraud 
business -- intimidation. The muscle isn't used against the investors. Believe 
it or not, people voluntarily surrender millions of dollars a year to the 
smooth-talking operators of penny stock frauds, as Lyons explains. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Mob's muscle comes in handy if any of the co-conspirators in a 
stock fraud decide that they no longer feel comfortable stealing from 
investors. "Not much (muscle) is needed," says Braunreuther, explaining that an 
implied threat is usually enough to make any white-collar criminal buckle. 
</P>
<P>
Most penny stock frauds are similar to the age-old pyramid schemes. Here's how 
the Mob, for instance, would put one of these scams together: 
</P>
<P>
First, the mobsters would launder illegally obtained money by bankrolling the 
start of a new company that, let's say, will purportedly own shopping centers. 
The company wouldn't be given a whole lot of capital -- just enough so that it 
can buy a property or two and be able to promise convincingly in legal 
documents that it plans to buy more buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Then, a large amount of stock that far exceeds the company's actual worth is 
sold by a small number of closely related "brokerages" that specialize in penny 
stocks. The sales are made over the telephone, with names of potential clients 
coming from mailing lists and referrals. 
</P>
<P>
The company never really plans to purchase more buildings. That's just a ruse. 
</P>
<P>
What the company -- which is usually run by close associates or relatives of 
the mobsters -- and its brokers really intend to do is manipulate the price of 
the shares upward so that investors will continually be enticed into buying 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
This way, not only do the schemers sell their personal stock holdings in the 
company at inflated prices as the stock rises, but the brokers and their firms 
also make fortunes from excessive trading commissions generated from the stock 
purchases. 
</P>
<P>
The key to all this is that nobody can be allowed to break with the conspiracy. 
If one of the brokerages stops trading the manipulated stock at the falsely 
inflated price, then the whole deceit unravels. That's where the Mob comes in: 
It keeps everyone in line. 
</P>
<P>
But, as Lyons explained, it wasn't all that difficult for the folks running F. 
D. Roberts to keep its troops loyal. There were, after all, plenty of economic 
incentives. 
</P>
<P>
Lyons said he personally made more than $100,000 in sales commissions in his 
first two months on the job, and it wasn't unusual for office managers to pull 
in $100,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
That's big money for anyone, but it is especially enticing when you consider 
that F. D. Roberts had a habit of recruiting lesser-paid workers -- like 
bartenders barely out of their teens -- into its version of the brokerage 
business. "One guy was sleeping in a laundry room" before he was hired by F. D. 
Roberts, Lyons said. 
</P>
<P>
As if that weren't enough to ensure loyalty, there also was the French chef 
hired by Roberts to provide sustenance for its troops during business hours; 
the evening beer blasts that went on even as brokers were making calls to 
clients on the West Coast, and "phenomenal" parties at the Boca Raton Resort 
&amp; Club. 
</P>
<P>
But F. D. Roberts also expected a lot of its brokers. 
</P>
<P>
Lyons said the 60 or so brokers at the Boca Raton office were required to be at 
work before 9 a.m. each day or be fined $100. At 9:30 a.m. they'd be given a 
pep talk that would have made a Big 10 college football coach proud. 
</P>
<P>
At that meeting, the managers would tell the brokers which stocks would be 
manipulated higher in price that day. They'd be encouraged to sell, sell, sell. 
A manager might fling a piece of gold jewelry to the previous day's most 
successful salesman. 
</P>
<P>
One manager even ushered his brokers to the office window so they could be 
inspired by the sight of the manager's new Rolls-Royce Corniche being delivered 
on cue in the parking lot. That car sells for more than $140,000, and the 
brokers were well aware that the manager also had a Mercedes and a Porsche at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
Lyons said the message was: "You do your work, and see what you can get." 
</P>
<P>
The brokers would spend their entire day calling clients from coast to coast. 
Some used scripts prepared for them by F. D. Roberts; other brokers would wing 
it. All were specially trained in high-pressure sales techniques. 
</P>
<P>
If a prospective client said, "I can't make that sort of investment without 
consulting my spouse," the broker would typically deride him or her by saying, 
"Who's the boss in your family anyway?" 
</P>
<P>
If the client's objection was that the money was being set aside for a child's 
education, the broker might say, "Do you really think you'll be able to afford 
a good college education investing the way you are now?" 
</P>
<P>
And if an investor insisted that he needed more time to think it over, the 
broker would offer to fill out the forms to buy stock now, "and you can always 
cancel the order later." Later, if the client did try to cancel, he would be 
told that it was too late. 
</P>
<P>
His protests would be cut short when the broker told him that the price of the 
stock he bought had already risen. (The stock, of course, actually did go up 
because the brokerage was manipulating it higher.) 
</P>
<P>
The brokers weren't above a little play acting, either. On more than one 
occasion, a broker's confederates would create background noises of ticker tape 
machines by tapping on their staplers. "Oh, oh," the broker would tell his mark 
over the phone, "another 100 shares of XYZ stock just traded. You'd better 
hurry or you'll miss out." 
</P>
<P>
Brokers in the Boca Raton office were expected to stay on the phone for hours. 
"If you weren't on the phone, they'd pull your chair away and make you stand up 
to get motivated," Lyons says. 
</P>
<P>
The sales staff was really pumped up, Lyons said, whenever the brokerage was 
starting a new scam. "They'd have an emergency meeting at 2 p.m. and say, 'This 
stock is coming out; have everyone buy it.' They guaranteed that the price 
would go up," Lyons says. 
</P>
<P>
But only certain clients -- mostly close associates of the brokerage's owners 
-- would ever be permitted to sell their stocks once the price did go up. 
Often, a broker was told that he had to deliver two new clients to buy a stock 
at a higher price for every one client who wanted out. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, Roberts just wouldn't let a client sell. One client, according to 
Lyons, was told that sell orders for a particular stock were being taken in the 
alphabetical order of the clients' last names. Since this particular client's 
name began with "W," he'd just have to wait his turn. 
</P>
<P>
If a client persisted, the broker would simply "fire" the client, said Lyons. 
The broker would mail the client the worthless stock certificate. Of course, 
the client would never be able to sell the stock anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
So far, New Jersey prosecutors have gotten 17 guilty pleas in the F. D. Roberts 
case. And New Jersey securities regulators have filed a civil complaint against 
more than a dozen officials of the firm, alleging that it made $65 million in 
illegal trading profits. Additional criminal charges are likely to be filed as 
well, according to law enforcement sources.

THE BEAUTY OF WARSAW; 
</P>
<P>
THE BEAUTIFUL MRS. SEIDENMAN BY ANDRZEJ SZCZPIORSKI TRANSLATED FROM THE POLISH 
BY KLARA GLOWCZEWSKA (GROVE PRESS: $18.95; 194 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Elaine Kendall, Kendall is a regular reviewer for The Times' View section. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first chapter of this vibrant book will convince American readers that 
author and translator are perfectly matched talents. A passionately committed 
and supremely ironic writer, Szczpiorski has had the good fortune to see the 
nuances of his native language turned into lyrical and idiomatic English. 
</P>
<P>
"The Beautiful Mrs. Seidenman" is more than a collection of short fiction but 
not quite a traditional novel; an elegant amalgam of distinct and separate 
tales linked by a few recurrent characters and a common setting. Each story has 
a distinct plot, though some are mere vignettes and others almost novellas in 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the book, every separate incident and personality has been 
thoroughly incorporated into a literary mural of life in Warsaw during World 
War II. Szczpiorski introduces us to aristocrats, students, artisans and 
soldiers; to mothers, widows, nuns and wives; to the Jews already sealed into 
the ghetto and the Gentiles living in uneasy limbo on its edges; every story 
illustrating how inextricably the various lives touch, clash and mesh. Often, 
we are introduced to a character before the war and follow that person for an 
entire lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
There are accidental heroes and inadvertent villains; surprising and unexpected 
switches that lend the book its extraordinary originality. As in classical 
drama, the horrors take place off-stage, leaving the reader to devise his own 
graphics. Though Szczpiorski writes from a profoundly Catholic sensibility and 
an abiding patriotism, his characters never slide into the stereotypes common 
even to the finest war novels. Here the war is background, exaggerating the 
contradictions and paradoxes in human nature without subsuming them. These are 
chronicles of accommodation and adjustment rather than of transformation. 
</P>
<P>
Szczpiorski begins with the story of an ordinary Polish tailor paying a call 
upon a distinguished judge. The vagaries of war have reversed the normal social 
order, inflating the value of well-tailored breeches and devaluing a university 
education and a noble name. Every few weeks, the judge sells his visitor 
another family heirloom, for which the tailor happily overpays "just so he 
could sit again on the threadbare little couch in this living room, with its 
odor of old objects and the dust from many books," discussing military strategy 
with the judge as if they were old friends and colleagues instead of two men 
brought together by grim necessity. 
</P>
<P>
Pawelek Kyrnski is 19 years old, and "already he understood well the difference 
between the sexes and was losing his faith in immortality." Kyrnski will 
reappear several times in the course of the book; arguing with his brilliant 
but reckless Jewish friend Henio; alone with his youthful hopes and dreams; 
enacting his crucial role in the salvation of Mrs. Seidenman. Her beauty, which 
would be mere prettiness in ordinary times, becomes a matter of life and death 
during the war, provoking the reactions that give these stories their necessary 
cohesion. 
</P>
<P>
She herself is not actually introduced until the third chapter, after having 
been denounced and imprisoned for masquerading as the widow of a Polish 
officer. By morning, the fair and winsome Mrs. Seidenman has been released, her 
life saved by a chain of fortunate encounters with Polish friends and neighbors 
who interceded because they believed her fiction. Spared by their efforts, she 
dedicates herself to preserving the scientific work of her late husband, the 
Jewish radiologist Seidenman. When we see her last, she's an elderly exile 
living out her days in Paris; a survivor who gave others the opportunity to be 
heroic without being in any way remarkable herself. She is a catalyst, 
illustrating the random workings of fate. 
</P>
<P>
Sister Weronika is a nun who once dreamed of becoming a missionary in Africa 
but who has settled instead for service in Warsaw, where her goal is "to bring 
to God all of earth's children -- the near and the far away, the white, the 
black, the yellow and those even more exotic. If there was any coldness in her 
heart, then it was only toward Jewish children, for it is one thing to have 
never come to know God, and something altogether different to have known and to 
have crucified him." Yet despite her prejudices and misgivings, Sister Weronika 
saves scores of children from the Nazis. She drills them in new rituals and 
tirelessly rehearses them in their strange new identities, having convinced 
herself that God has merely changed the locus of her mission. Imperfect but 
splendid, Sister Weronika lingers in the mind long after a conventionally 
saintly figure would have faded. 
</P>
<P>
Though the author has clearly attempted to present his Nazis as subtly as he 
portrays his Poles and Jews, evil has fewer guises than good. Despite a 
conscientious effort to explain the character of Stuckler, the son of a poor 
miller who becomes an officer in the SS, Szczpiorski is far more successful 
with his own countrymen. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally idealistic but made cynical by a tormented history, the enduring 
spirit of Poland is revealed here in all its complexity by a writer whose love 
for his country is tempered by a profound understanding of its every strength 
and weakness.

It is difficult, often impossible, to render understandable the brutal 
ambiguities of South African life and politics. That has not stopped people 
from trying, and the results, too often, are merely worthy or simplistic. South 
Africa is a well of self-righteousness where the world comes to drink. 
</P>
<P>
Now along comes Rian Malan, a member of the white master tribe of Southern 
Africa. He writes the story of his life and the history of his family in a 
fusion of heart-searching memoir, political analysis and philosophical 
investigation. "My Traitor's Heart" strips aside hypocrisies and simplicities 
and casts a harsh, brilliant light on that lovely, surreal land. 
</P>
<P>
Malan grew up as a fairly typical example of an urbanized Afrikaner. His French 
Huguenot forebears settled in South Africa in the 17th Century; since then, one 
or another member of the family has been woven into the history of the country. 
</P>
<P>
It was as a teen-ager in the early '70s that the young Rian became a convert to 
"communism" -- less an ideology than a way of cocking a snook at his 
middle-class Afrikaner family. His predicament -- yearning for solutions, yet 
unable to act -- was shared by many white South African liberals. Contemplating 
the gulf between themselves and the black masses who had no choice but to 
endure, they questioned their own identities: Were they preachers or killers? 
Tourists or marksmen? Masters or victims? 
</P>
<P>
Malan's youthful revolutionary chic culminated in an enormous slogan he daubed 
on a roadside embankment: "Say It Out Loud, I'm Black &amp; I'm Proud." The 
response of his illiterate black maidservant to this piece of street theater 
was salutary. She told him to get lost. 
</P>
<P>
And that, in a sense, is just what he did. Malan became a reporter, a 
profession that has always attracted lunatics and liberals (and in South 
Africa, it is not always possible to tell the difference). But the blood and 
guts of crime reporting in the black townships -- where murders far exceed the 
uncertain example of cities such as New York -- together with the 1976 uprising 
in Soweto, got too much for even a hard-nosed reporter. Then there was the 
looming threat of military service, so Malan did a bunk. He fled overseas, and 
became, he confesses, one of those dinner-table liberals to be found in many 
foreign cities, singing for their suppers by telling well-disposed foreigners 
what they already know. 
</P>
<P>
But the half-life of semi-exile in affluent Los Angeles simply would not do. In 
the mid-'80s, Malan returned to find Africa anything but maternal. Those who 
hated her, she destroyed. She did the same for those who loved her, only it 
took a little longer. 
</P>
<P>
His old illusions died one by one. The battle lines were drawn: "If you were 
white in the wrong place at the wrong time, you were a target." Thus a 
"liberal" uncle is beaten up for trying to do a favor for an old employee. An 
altruistic white doctor is murdered by blacks who only a few days before may 
well have been his patients. Visiting French dignitaries are stoned in the 
squatter camp of Crossroads, outside Cape Town. 
</P>
<P>
When the smoke clears and the dead are buried, the eternal war, ferocious and 
implacable, between indigenous black and interloping white continues in the old 
and deadly tradition, a struggle that the first Malan, back in the 17th 
Century, would have recognized immediately. 
</P>
<P>
It is one of the distinctions of this extraordinary book that Malan is as 
clear-eyed in analyzing his own moral posturing as he is in attacking the 
lunacies of apartheid. Nor does he spare the reader. At one point in his 
anguished, riveting narrative, he cries out: "Am I upsetting you, my friend? 
Good. Do you want to argue? Do you want me to tell you about the evil of 
apartheid? Do you want to talk about democracy and the allied civil and human 
rights that fall under the umbra of its name? OK. Let's open my bulging files 
of tales of ordinary murder. You choose your weapons and I'll choose mine, and 
we'll annihilate the certainties in one another's brains." 
</P>
<P>
His "files" are indeed disturbing. There is the mysterious "hammerman" who 
terrorizes a white town in the heart of Zululand, falling on white couples in 
the dead of night and smashing in their heads with a claw hammer. Dirt-poor 
black farmers murder each other in ancient tribal vendettas. Black children 
execute each other. Whites cultivate the spiritual "deformity" of black hatred. 
Yet well-disposed whites who turn from hate to love often are struck down. 
</P>
<P>
"My Traitor's Heart," a relentless survey of African love and horror, closes 
with the story of a white couple, the Alcocks, who come as close to being South 
African saints as that benighted country is ever likely to produce. 
</P>
<P>
The Alcocks' mission was one of unconditional love in a bitterly impoverished 
rural slum hard by the Tugela River in Zululand. In this "ecological 
Hiroshima," the Alcocks successfully established a rudimentary survival 
station. They failed, miserably. Neil Alcock was killed by the people he gave 
his life to save; his widow was nearly destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
Malan's book is not a Greek tragedy. There is no catharsis, no saving grace. 
Instead, there is a kind of sustaining paradox. If "My Traitor's Heart" offers 
little cause for hope, it does not admit despair either. It is a passionate, 
blazingly honest testament to the way things are, a white-hot book of 
revelations punctuated by murders, confessions, deceits -- and saintliness. 
</P>
<P>
Those who read it will never again see South Africa in quite the same way.

A SPEECHIFIER IN HER OWN WRITE; 
</P>
<P>
WHAT I SAW AT THE REVOLUTION A POLITICAL LIFE IN THE REAGAN ERA BY PEGGY NOONAN 
(RANDOM HOUSE: $19.95; 346 PP.; 0-394-56495-2) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David Klinghoffer, Klinghoffer, formerly assistant literary editor of 
National Review, now writes about popular culture for the Washington Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even among conservatives, Peggy Noonan, the celebrated Reagan speech writer, 
continues to draw mixed reactions. Was she a sinner or a savior? Opinions 
differ. 
</P>
<P>
When excerpts from this memoir appeared last October in the New York Times 
Magazine, the ensuing publicity earned the author an immediate censure in 
National Review -- possibly Reagan's most loyal supporter in all of journalism. 
As the magazine's anonymous editorial writer put it: "There is a stern moral 
here for present and future Presidents . . . when you hire a speech writer of 
this moral character, lock up the silverware and keep your hand on your 
wallet." Reading "What I Saw at the Revolution" will give you a pretty clear 
idea of what it is that makes Noonan such an ambivalent figure. And not just 
for conservatives, either. 
</P>
<P>
Keep in mind, first, that political speech writers are supposed to do their 
jobs quietly and without notice. After all, when a speech writer takes credit 
for his efforts, the man he works for necessarily loses some degree of 
credibility. This is bad form. 
</P>
<P>
During her two years in the Reagan White House, and a later stint as a 
free-lancer for President Bush, Noonan found her way around that old-fashioned 
ethical code. She was, for example, the first working speech writer to score a 
celebrity profile in Esquire magazine -- under the headline, "Who Puts the 
Words in the President's Mouth?" And now the follow-up: a full-blown 
celebrity-style memoir taking credit for most every noteworthy ink mark to 
emerge from her word processor -- from speeches for Reagan marking the 
Challenger disaster and the anniversary of D-Day to such phrases for Bush as 
"kinder, gentler," "read my lips" and "a thousand points of light." 
</P>
<P>
"What I Saw at the Revolution" tells you a lot of things you probably never 
wondered about Noonan: about her vintage '60s childhood on Long Island, her 
failed marriage to a distinguished gentleman with an eye patch. Unfortunately, 
she never quite explains how a speech writer like herself managed to become an 
inside-the-beltway star nearly on the order of big-name insiders like Michael 
Deaver and Donald Regan. 
</P>
<P>
Her former White House colleagues will tell you (or anyway they told me when I 
was researching a story on the subject a few months ago) that Noonan courted 
the press, regularly lunched with reporters, on occasion gave off-the-record 
advance notice that she had written a speech a day before the speech was 
actually given. How else to explain those mysterious leaks to the press that 
have, in Noonan's account, repeatedly linked her name with some of the most 
successful presidential utterances of the last few years? 
</P>
<P>
Noonan's reluctance to be completely candid is probably the most irritating 
thing about this book. There's always something you feel she's neglected to 
tell you. Like why it was she became such a reviled figure around the West 
Wing, harassed at her every step, she says, by Nancy Reagan, Maureen Reagan, 
Don Regan, Don Regan's aides (whom she tells us she called "the mice," an 
epithet that -- surprise! -- found its way into Newsweek) plus fellow speech 
writers, members of the National Security Council, and others? 
</P>
<P>
What's likely is that her colleagues found her, as will her readers, a somewhat 
difficult personality. There are really at least two Peggy Noonans at odds 
here. One is a kind of shivering jelly of resentments and insecurities, 
alternately decrying the "movement" conservatives in the Administration 
("creepy little men with creepy little beards"), railing against the 
foreign-policy Establishment's legion of "Mr. Harvardheads," etc. The other is 
Peggy Noonan the self-styled policy-maker. This one suffers from what, in 
others, she calls "the attitude." A person with "the attitude" sees the 
politician he works for as a mere front man for the more intelligent members of 
his staff. Or, as Noonan puts it, "A speech writer is obviously not free to 
invent out of whole cloth, but -- by articulating the policy he invents it ." 
This is a little high-handed. 
</P>
<P>
Happily, though, an angry, arrogant writer also can be a terrifically 
entertaining one. In fact, if you're not the type to get too worked up over the 
hard-packed details of White House policy-making (in which Noonan clearly was 
not involved), then this may be the Reagan memoir you'll want to read. 
</P>
<P>
What separates Noonan from competing White House memoirists -- Donald Regan, 
Michael Deaver, Nancy Reagan, Larry Speakes -- is that she indicts her enemies 
not on the usual charges of venality and ineptitude but above all, for their 
failures of taste. 
</P>
<P>
These arise principally in what's called the "staffing" process, about which 
Noonan has a great deal to say. All speeches submitted to the President, we're 
told, must first pass through staffing, during which as many as 50 tone-deaf 
policy hacks are encouraged to edit the work of professional speechwriters. 
This creates innumerable frustrations. Like bad writers everywhere, White House 
bureaucrats adore cliches (one "pudgy, young NSC mover" ordered Noonan to 
change the last words in the Challenger speech from "touch the face of God" to 
"reach out and touch someone -- touch the face of God," plus cheesy rhetorical 
tricks of all kinds (Deaver couldn't resist alliteration, and favored the 
letter p, as in 'prepared for peace,' 'pride and purpose,' etc."). 
</P>
<P>
In time, the President's poll-takers began offering advice too. One of them, 
Dick Wirthlin, deputized groups of citizens (called "focus groups") to listen 
to the President recite his State of the Union speech, and, while they 
listened, to press a button if they heard a phrase they liked. Wirthlin then 
instructed the President's speech writers to take the most popular phrases and 
make sure to include them in subsequent speeches. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, what brings out the nastiest, and the best, in Noonan is 
language-abuse -- in particular, language-abuse on the part of federal 
bureaucrats. The two Reagan Administrations are supposed to have worked a 
revolution in government. Certainly, though, they left the values and parlance 
of bureaucracy intact. 
</P>
<P>
Thus Noonan observes of National Security Adviser Robert C. (Bud) McFarlane: "I 
had a hunch McFarlane decided long ago, as young people sometimes do, that 
intelligent people speak in an incomprehensible manner. He adopted the style. 
In time, he was no more capable of a simple public utterance than of a private 
one, so that when dining with his wife, he presumably would not say, 'Pass the 
butter' but rather 'The stationary oleaginous object which is now not within my 
grasp or the grasp of others within this administration would be desirable, 
though not necessary, within my sphere and on my muffin.' " Likewise 
McFarlane's colleague, Oliver North, who we're told said things like "And don't 
forget this (memo) is in accord conversation Casey-North approximately fifteen 
hundred this date ." 
</P>
<P>
In one respect, Noonan seems to be asking us to consider whether the Reagan 
revolution ever really happened. It was one of the great promises of Ronald 
Reagan's presidency that it would clear out the culture of Washington 
bureaucracy -- of which the language of Bud McFarlane and Oliver North has been 
a principal underpinning. Viewed from this perspective, the revolution failed. 
Noonan's peculiarities aside, her book is a lively portrait of that failure.

TALKING WAR TO THE PEOPLE; 
</P>
<P>
THE ROCKETS' RED GLARE WHEN AMERICA GOES TO WAR: THE PRESIDENTS AND THE PEOPLE 
BY RICHARD J. BARNET (SIMON &amp; SCHUSTER: $24.95; 496 PP.; 0-671-63376-7) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Alex Raksin, Raksin, an assistant editor of the Book Review, studied the 
historical role of American public opinion in graduate work at the Annenberg 
School of Communications. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Having never forgotten the "extraordinary" town hall meetings he would attend 
with his father, John Adams entered public office convinced that "the only 
moral foundation of government is the consent of the people." A representative 
assembly, he wrote, "should think, feel, reason, and act like them." After 
years of trying to quiet Americans' "hysterical" cries to join in the war 
against the French aristocracy, however, the President left office most proud 
of ignoring that public will: "I desire no other inscription over my 
gravestone," he wrote, "than 'Here lies John Adams, who took upon himself the 
responsibility of the peace with France in the year 1800.' " 
</P>
<P>
Today, American Presidents and their advisers remain no less torn between the 
Populist ideals they learned in school and the elitist temptation to "maintain 
the interest of the American people against their opinions," as Edmund Burke 
put it. 
</P>
<P>
Publicly, of course, they are devout Populists, well aware of the longstanding 
antipathy of Americans toward those who govern them in monarchal isolation. 
This was reflected most recently in the televised Iran-Contra hearings, where 
secret government was not so much investigated as ritually denounced. But in 
private, once the hearings had concluded, the senators went back to practicing 
a form of government almost as secretive as the one they had been vilifying. 
</P>
<P>
As Richard Barnet illustrates in "The Rockets' Red Glare," America's top 
leaders have tended to chart foreign policies on their own, presenting them as 
faits accomplis to the public, as "commodities to be sold rather than a set of 
facts to be debated." Agreeing with Alexis de Tocqueville that "democracy tends 
to obey its feelings rather than its calculations," America's foreign-policy 
elite long has believed that our nation's security can be assured only when 
decisions are made independently of imprudent and irrational public pressures. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, pre-election rhetoric often bears scant resemblance to 
post-election policy. As Barnet writes, "Wilson, Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson 
all campaigned on the implied promise to stay out of war; in each case, 
thousands of Americans were dying in battle within a year of their 
inauguration. Richard Nixon pleaded for votes by hinting that he had a 'secret 
plan' to end the Vietnam War with honor, a plan that did not exist. At the same 
time no one who voted for him could know that they were voting for 
normalization of relations with China." 
</P>
<P>
But have the policy makers actually been more prudent and rational than the 
people? Generally not, Barnet convincingly argues in this sophisticated 
revisionist history. As in his 1973 classic, "The Roots of War," he draws on 
his own experiences as an adviser in the Kennedy Administration to illustrate 
how the State Department's hermetic way of thinking has left it out of touch 
with geopolitical realities. 
</P>
<P>
Barnet's targets range from foreign-policy strategies that underestimate the 
significance and durability of indigenous cultures to a masculine ethic that 
makes retreat an unacceptable option. (Against the advice of its own military 
advisers, for instance, the Reagan Administration insisted on installing 
missiles in Europe because not doing so would be seen as "backing down" from 
European protests.) 
</P>
<P>
But unlike Barnet's previous books -- urgent responses to crises of the present 
or recent past -- "The Rockets' Red Glare" travels back to the founding of the 
republic to determine how the policy-makers came to be so far removed from the 
people. This distancing began when George Washington, trying to avoid an 
economically crippling war with Britain, claimed that the Constitution had 
given treaty-making powers exclusively to him and the Senate. The public 
initially rejected the argument, forming democratic "societies" to debate 
policy, but as the western continent beckoned and the population surged in the 
19th Century, vox populi became less dissonant. Turning inward, to the business 
of nation-building, Americans began to seek freedom on the frontier rather than 
in the town-hall debate. 
</P>
<P>
In a shift that created the modern campaign, political parties began 
simplifying issues rather than debating them, and candidates became 
personalities to be followed rather than ideologues to be challenged. Barnet 
recounts, for example, how a crowd trailed Andrew Jackson as he rode his horse 
to the White House after winning the scurrilous 1828 election. The crowd kept 
following, surging into the East Room, spilling punch, breaking glasses, 
putting muddy boots on damask chairs. Forced to escape his admirers by a rear 
window, the President took refuge in a nearby tavern. Lamented Charles Carroll, 
the last surviving signer of the Declaration of Independence, "The tradition of 
cultivated manners is lost. Society is less brilliant and more prosperous." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson's successors weren't always blessed with such enthusiastic followers: 
James Polk had to drum up support for the war with Mexico; William McKinley had 
to launch foreign adventures to prevent the spread of domestic strikes. But not 
until the end of World War I, when Woodrow Wilson failed to muster public 
support for the League of Nations, did domestic opposition truly cripple a 
President's foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
The public's failure to rise to Wilson's noble vision of a world peacekeeping 
force is commonly cited by elite historians to attack precisely the kind of 
participatory democracy that Barnet is trying to affirm. Barnet's response is 
persuasive. The League was a victim not so much of public ignobility, he 
writes, as of Senate-Executive Branch rivalries and, ironically, of government 
propaganda: U. S. attempts since the 1890s to discredit "foreign-inspired" 
labor activists had left Americans suspicious of all dealings with "wily" 
Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
Barnet is only partially successful at challenging the other principal argument 
of elite historians: that American pacifism prevented Franklin Roosevelt from 
standing up to Hitler before the German dictator made his first aggressive 
moves. He convincingly argues, as Clare Boothe Luce did, that Roosevelt would 
have been able to win the people's support had he led them into war through 
reasoning rather than lied them into it through bobbing, weaving rhetoric. But 
Roosevelt's concern over the vein of anti-Semitism in his own country, which 
discouraged him from bombing the Nazi gas chambers, is one indictment of public 
opinion's power that Barnet is unable to explain away. Barnet rightly blames 
the New York Times for burying on Page 12 the story of 750,000 deaths and 
Father Coughlin for fanning fears of a "world Jewish conspiracy." But the 
Times, Jewish-owned, also was responding to existing prejudices, just as the 
demagogue from Detroit exploited the public's need to hear facile explanations 
for social injustice. 
</P>
<P>
Such irrationalities, together with a rising body of theory propounding a 
"human need" to barter away freedom for social order, were enough to diminish 
the faith in human reason which had inspired the Founding Fathers. And so, as 
illusions of pure democracy faded, postwar intellectuals began to assent and 
even to collude in the use of propaganda for purposes they deemed beneficent. 
They enlisted in the fight against isolationism, an American tendency following 
wars. Political and cultural propaganda eventually displaced anxiety about the 
Bomb onto the Soviets, and the Cold War was born. As Barnet writes, in the name 
of battling the Closed Society, the Open Society closed down on dissent. 
</P>
<P>
Barnet hails the reopening of American society in the 1976 elections. They were 
"a populist counterattack against the imperial presidency," he writes, giving 
"a burst of new energy for greater participation in decision making." But what 
Barnet sees as a lively period of participatory democracy, conservatives saw as 
a demoralizing era of "social disorder." Barnet blithely dismisses this view, 
deriding the New York Times for warning in its Bicentennial essay of "a wild 
disorientation about the style of American life, as though the national compass 
had been lost." 
</P>
<P>
But the view may well have had some truth to it, for statistics gathered in the 
'80s demonstrate that voter participation began declining precipitously in the 
post-Watergate, post-Vietnam era. It seems clear that as Americans grew more 
critical of their government, they also grew less enthusiastic about its 
policies and plans. It is ironic that Barnet does not recognize this 
relationship, for his book so eloquently illustrates its converse: When war 
propaganda has led Americans to uncritically accept their leaders' myths -- 
e.g., Stalin was bent on world conquest; it was the American Indian's "destiny" 
to be conquered -- the national sense of mission has become more energized and 
directed. 
</P>
<P>
Accurately observing that for the first time in our history we have no clear 
manifest destiny, Barnet suggests that we might well succeed in adopting a new 
mission: "mobilizing the energetic power of America to help save the planet." 
But Barnet's optimism is based on the unsupported assertion that Americans "are 
less dependent on stereotypes for simplifying reality" and more aware of 
foreign cultures than they were in the '50s and '60s. More problematically, it 
assumes that the challenge of global intercooperation will be enough to renew 
American nationalism, when his book has shown that nationalism grows primarily 
as Americans unite against others. 
</P>
<P>
Barnet's call for global unity might meet the same fate as the controversial 
1970s public-school textbooks that depicted American culture as but one of 
many, neither better nor worse than other ways of life. Eighties conservatives 
such as Allan Bloom saw these texts as undermining national morale. American 
students "must be taught that American culture is better than others," as 
former Secretary of Education William Bennett put it. 
</P>
<P>
All of this suggests some important questions we have yet to grapple with 
seriously: Can our nation remain stable and energized when its citizens 
question it from differing perspectives, or must it use propaganda to encourage 
a common perspective? Can a patriotic society be brightened by a thousand 
points of critical light, or must it inspire a more emotional devotion to a 
common set of colors, such as the red, white and blue, or the rockets' red 
glare?

May I express my indignation? Allegedly Bill Kenkelen, West Coast correspondent 
for the liberal National Catholic Reporter said that Mahony is "a church 
political animal." 
</P>
<P>
Further: "He was liberal in the '60s, when it was profitable to be liberal. And 
now under this Pope, it's advantageous to be conservative." 
</P>
<P>
I do not know who Kenkelen is, but I am sure that he is a not-well-educated 
Catholic. He should know that there are basic doctrines in the Catholic faith 
that do not depend on who the Pope is. Another quotation, from Father Thomas 
Reese, that "bishops are not liberal Democrats -- they are coming out of a 
Christian perspective" is the right judgment in this question.

The highly charged emotional issues of abortion and cigarette smoking in public 
places have this in common: They restrict population growth, one by 
forestalling the birth of unwanted children and the other by escalating the 
death rate; and they polarize perfectly nice, reasonable people instantly into 
bitter enemies, ready to do bodily harm at the least provocation! Take good 
Archbishop Mahony, for instance. A pleasant regular guy -- jogs, flies his own 
helicopter, says "geez," talks just like you, me and the other fellas down at 
the health club. 
</P>
<P>
But when the subject of abortion comes up, watch out! This mild-mannered Dr. 
Jekyll metamorphoses -- in a trice -- into fire-breathing Mr. Hyde! Never mind 
that overpopulation causes most of the world's problems, and that most Latino 
families live in squalor. "There is no such thing as a pro-choice Catholic 
public official." To perpetuate such archaic, arbitrary, dilatory dogma, the 
archbishop (and the Vatican) must be running scared. And with good reason!

JACK SMITH ON SUNDAY: IT'S AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE;

IF WHAT YOU LOSE IS IMPORTANT ENOUGH, CHANCES ARE YOU'LL NEVER FIND IT

NARDI REEDER CAMPION first appeared in this space some time ago when I quoted 
from an essay she had published in the Boston Globe listing the things her 
Wellesley Class of 1938 had been before. 
</P>
<P>
Her list astonished the young, who could not believe that their parents or 
grandparents had grown up without such taken-for-granteds as television, nylon, 
frozen foods, credit cards, ballpoint pens, antibiotics, polio vaccine, 
penicillin, panty hose and the Pill. 
</P>
<P>
Campion is a free-lance writer. She lives in Hanover, N.H. Last Thanksgiving, 
while visiting a daughter in Altadena, she asked if she could visit me on Mt. 
Washington, and she did. She is bright, quick, curious, likable and energetic 
and seems to have overcome the deprivations of our youth. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, she sent me a column she had written some time ago for the New York 
Times. It is about losing things: 
</P>
<P>
"Over the years, I have lost keys, birth certificates, silverware, gloves, 
lists, checks, cash, glasses, engagement calendars (that's the worst). I have 
also lost one dog, two cats, a leg of lamb (cooked), ration books (World War 
II), critical phone numbers, a fur hat, an automobile, and, naturally, my 
temper. I even lost a child once, but he was returned by the floorwalker. I 
also lost my husband in the Moscow metro, but that's another story." 
</P>
<P>
Once again, Campion touches a common chord, not only for our generation, but 
for all. Do you know anyone who doesn't lose things? 
</P>
<P>
I have lost everything Campion has lost except a cooked leg of lamb and a fur 
hat. I even lost my wife in London's Victoria Station, but thanks to the fact 
that most Englishmen speak a kind of English, I was able to find her. 
</P>
<P>
I lose my key ring at least once a week. Naturally, I am aware that I have lost 
the keys only when I need them; we often end up taking my wife's car. 
</P>
<P>
I have lost my swimming trunks, my coffee cup (full of coffee), my shoes, the 
book I am reading, the section of the newspaper I am reading, the TV 
remote-control box, my wallet, my hat. 
</P>
<P>
Campion says that her husband, as a boy, lost a New South Wales stamp worth 
$800. I lost 40 shares of Times Mirror stock that had been sent me when the 
stock split. It was then worth about $2,500. I never found it. I have lost two 
shares of American Airlines stock I acquired years ago. 
</P>
<P>
I go on losing ordinary things, but in recent years I have concentrated on 
losing correspondence. I receive many letters every week. I bring them home 
from the office in a briefcase, sit in my swivel chair in the living room and 
open every one, keeping in mind the lost stock. 
</P>
<P>
I sort the personal letters into little piles, according to their subject 
matter, as possible column ideas. Once categorized as ideas, they go into a 
kind of limbo, never to be answered. Some are to be answered at once -- when I 
can find the time. A few, if too ill-natured, are discarded. Toward all the 
others, my intentions are good. 
</P>
<P>
I read every one. I treasure letters. They sustain me. Some, I place about the 
floor of my den in piles. Some go into bins on my desk. Theoretically, I know 
where every letter is, what every pile is about. 
</P>
<P>
The next day I can't find the ones I want. It seems that any I want to refer 
to, and put in a special place, are hopelessly lost. I spend hours every week 
going through piles of letters in search of one that I must have. Many times I 
have gone down to the row of trash barrels behind the garage and emptied them, 
one by one, searching among their contents for some critical piece of mail. 
Never have I found it in this way. 
</P>
<P>
There is a law at work. Correspondence will be lost in direct ratio to its 
importance. Really important correspondence will never be found. 
</P>
<P>
Campion says she and her husband have decided to quit looking for lost things. 
Cold turkey. "Life is too short to spend it hunting. Now we either wait for a 
lost object to turn up or make do without." 
</P>
<P>
I can't do that. I was brought up to believe that if someone wrote to you, you 
answered. Alas, I have not always kept to that rule. 
</P>
<P>
Every now and then I get an indignant letter from some person who has written 
me and failed to receive an answer. She will say, "President Truman answered my 
letter," or "Governor Deukmejian answered my letter." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe he answers all his mail, but I'll bet Gov. Deukmejian loses his car keys 
like the rest of us, and it wouldn't surprise me if he had lost his wife.

FICTION IN BRIEF: SHADOWS OF A SOUND STORIES BY HWANG SUN-WON (MERCURY HOUSE:

This collection spans five decades of work by Korean novelist, poet and 
short-story master Hwang Sun-Won. The early pieces were written under a 
Japanese-occupation ban on writing and were hidden for a seemingly distant 
future when publication might be possible. The secret stories seem to have set 
Hwang on a path to intimate writing; they have a private quality, as if the 
author were whispering to himself. "Snow," written at the end of World War II, 
begins with a return to the narrator's native village. He spends evenings with 
the men: "Our talk is limited to ordinary subjects. The season being what it 
is, our conversations tonight concerned production quotas of rice. The men all 
talked as if everyone else's worries were their own and their own worries were 
everyone else's." The prosaic talk, however, only frames the main story of the 
evening: a parable-like tale of how hard it snows in the province of which one 
of the old men is a native. A traveler is forced to spend a long blizzard in a 
house he passes; when the roads are finally passable, he meets at an inn the 
man whose house has sheltered him. The host is returning home, having been 
similarly prevented by the storm from reaching his destination. Upon hearing 
that his wife has survived the winter, the host is unable to express his 
appreciation for the good news. Returning to the real time of winter, 1944, the 
narrator's simple story concludes: "The great flakes of snow continued to 
tumble down outside. 
</P>
<P>
The men who had gathered here earlier had quit talking and were sitting 
quietly, as if contemplating how they might survive the winter, piecing 
together threads of hope for the coming year's unrewarding crop. Once again I 
stirred up the dying embers in the earthen brazier." 
</P>
<P>
In the extremely painful story "Clowns," Hwang distills in a few pages the 
despair of a refugee family shunted from house to house as they seek shelter. 
Their dignity is first affronted when the mistress of the house where they have 
taken a room bars them from using the toilet. When a child's shoe disappears, 
they fear that the owners of the house are performing folk magic at the refugee 
family's expense. The misunderstandings and humiliations grow more profound as 
the family is passed from house to house, each time becoming more burdensome. 
At every new misfortune, they feel they must have sunk as low as possible, but 
each time another depth opens. In the end, when they take shelter under a 
bridge and the young son demonstrates how easy it is to barter with the GIs, 
the narrator in quiet hysteria sees his family as a pitiable circus troupe, 
performing their tricks in the open road. 
</P>
<P>
Hwang's stories, rendered in English by various translators, make the language 
transition with uniform grace; they all read beautifully.

FICTION IN BRIEF: PARTING IS ALL WE KNOW OF HEAVEN BY MOLLY MOYNAHAN (HARPER

<P>
A smart-alecky novel of contemporary life in New York, "Parting" concerns 
29-year-old Cordelia, who can talk about T. S. Eliot in one breath ("April is 
not the cruelest month," she concludes, as she tries to get out of bed in 
February) and "Poltergeist" and "The Twilight Zone" in the next. Her realism is 
from the pages of women's magazines: A friend congratulates her on hitting the 
Big Three-Oh when she's only turning 29; momentary deep depression ensues. 
She's a sucker for beautiful men, which might make her job as receptionist at a 
health club a tad difficult, but an obvious choice for earning rent while she 
waits for her big acting break. One of Cordelia's lovers is a Hungarian 
musician "with the moral integrity of Fritz the Cat." 
</P>
<P>
Into this normally neurotic world comes disaster. Her eldest sister, Cynthia, 
is raped and murdered. Cordelia, the youngest, is thrown into despair. The 
story becomes a psychological study of bereavement, as Cordelia fights to 
re-establish her balance. There are intelligent and moving observations about 
how people come to terms with inexplicable loss. But the pervasive humor in 
"Parting" is a bit difficult to read: How much tongue is in cheek? The silly 
choice of names for the sister trio, for instance -- Cordelia, Amelia, Cynthia 
-- undermines the observation of a family dealing with tragedy. The author 
packs in at least a dozen too many of the ills known to young upwardly mobile 
women, from abortion to eating disorders to rough sex. In addition, it's 
difficult to take "Parting" seriously as a study in grief and self-loathing -- 
as it seems to want to be taken -- when the story is filled with too much witty 
New York banter and stories like the following: Cordelia and her best friend 
pick up young Wall Street types at a trendy club: "They had a pretty dull time 
except for one hysterical trip to the ladies,' where they discovered that 
neither of them knew which banker was named Doug and which was Brad. They 
solved their dilemma by calling one Boug and the other Drad. The men were not 
amused, and they finally left for the South Street Seaport in search of more 
upwardly mobile, well-behaved young women."

Alice Ghostley always has been a favorite actress of mine, and I've been very 
happy to see her appearances as Bernice on "Designing Women." Modeling a 
Christmas-tree skirt or singing the blues over a fast-food restaurant 
microphone, Ghostley adds a delightful touch to an already outstanding series. 
Here's hoping we'll see more of her in future episodes.

Thanks a lot, NBC, for moving "Dear John" from Thursday to Wednesday nights 
opposite "Anything But Love." 
</P>
<P>
It was perfectly placed on Thursday nights just before "L.A. Law," and now 
you've put it on at a time where it will get lost. I just don't understand the 
networks or why they do what they do. Can't they just leave things alone and 
let us enjoy what we have come home to watch at the end of a busy day?

How exciting it was to see hockey on network TV for the first time in 10 years. 
But what a disappointment it was to have Marv Albert call the play-by-play for 
NBC on Jan. 21. With all the good hockey announcers available, couldn't the 
network find a more competent announcer?

A DIAGNOSIS OF THE CURIES; 
</P>
<P>
GRAND OBSESSION MADAME MARIE CURIE AND HER WORLD BY ROSALYND PFLAUM (DOUBLEDAY: 
$22.50; 496 PP, ILLUSTRATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Bettyann Kevles 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rosalynd Pflaum's "Grand Obsession: Marie Curie and Her World" is a series of 
overlapping biographies of Marie and Pierre Curie, their daughter, Irene, and 
her husband, Frederic Joliot-Curie. All Nobel Laureates, they dominated the 
field of radioactivity in France during the first half of this century. 
</P>
<P>
Feminists will be disappointed. Despite the lip-service Pflaum pays to the 
slights and institutional obstacles that being female visited upon the distaff 
Curies, she writes about scientists who happened to be women, rather than women 
scientists. Moreover, she describes both Marie and Irene Curie in the contexts 
of their marriages. She does not even elaborate on the matter of nomenclature 
-- the apparently painless transformation of Manya Sklodowska, a fervent Polish 
nationalist -- to Marie Curie when she married the French chemist. In contrast, 
a generation later, Frederic Joliot, enamored of his wife's lineage, went the 
extra mile to hyphenate her name with his, becoming Joliot-Curie. 
</P>
<P>
Pflaum has set herself a difficult task in this thoroughly researched book. She 
presents four separate biographies, explains the lives of her subjects in the 
context of the science as well as the social history of their times, and 
addresses earlier biographers and critics in an effort to set the record 
straight. The result is uneven, a book rich in detail, scientifically literate 
but occasionally naive. 
</P>
<P>
Pflaum focuses on issues that dominated contemporary headlines, including the 
alleged affair between Marie Curie and her colleague Paul Langevin in 1911 and, 
a generation later, on the turmoil over Frederic Joliot-Curie's activities 
during the German occupation (when he had the opportunity to escape France and 
refused to leave). Pflaum reflects on these issues, recapitulates the old 
gossip as well as the evidence, but sheds little new light. 
</P>
<P>
She is at her best in her cameo portrait of Dr. Eugene Curie, Pierre's 
free-thinking father, who lived with them and who remained, after Pierre's 
horrific death beneath the wheels of a wagon on the rue Dauphine, to care for 
their small daughters. Later, Pflaum presents a vivid picture of the World War 
I front to which Marie, with her then-teen-aged daughter Irene at her side, had 
lugged her X-ray machine to help treat the wounded. 
</P>
<P>
Pflaum follows the early years of nuclear research in the makeshift laboratory 
where Marie single-mindedly and patiently separated a few grams of radium out 
of the literally tons of pitchblende she had had dumped in the yard outside. 
Never, it seems, did the Curies seriously question the wisdom of working with 
radioactive materials, not even after each of them in turn showed symptoms of 
extreme fatigue and unhealing sores that signal disease. 
</P>
<P>
The Curies believed that the discovery of radioactivity would enhance human 
life, and in its early years, X-rays did seem only a boon to medicine; 
radiation therapy had not yet revealed a dark side. A generation later, with 
the explosions over Japan, Frederic and Irene Joliot-Curie felt betrayed by 
their American colleagues. To them, science was unequivocally a force for good, 
and they did not seem to comprehend how their work could be interpreted as an 
evil genie released to wreak universal havoc. 
</P>
<P>
Pflaum captures the international spirit of science in a world before people 
needed passports to travel and Nobel Prizes, still new, were accepted in the 
spirit of pacifism. The Curies, not alone, believed in "pure" science. Their 
ambitions took the form of a desire for recognition, for professorships, 
appointments, and financial subvention of their research. But they did not seek 
patents or the creation of personal fortunes. Even their Nobel money, never 
inconsequential, was spent on their work, or on domestic assistance so that 
they could work even harder. 
</P>
<P>
Pflaum projects mixed feelings about her subjects. In one paragraph, she 
admires Marie: "An amazing, brilliant woman, whose doggedness and stubbornness 
had overcome immense hardships." Then she adds, gratuitously, "But she was 
never the genius Pierre was." 
</P>
<P>
Brilliant but not a genius? How does one measure the difference? Perhaps Pflaum 
is registering distaste for the woman she portrays as monomaniacal and 
humorless, whose children were saved from neglect only by their good fortune in 
having a benevolent grandfather. Yet both daughters seem to have matured into 
productive women with deep affection for their mother. 
</P>
<P>
Biographers do not have to like their subjects, but Pflaum wavers between 
making judgments and making excuses for hers. Discussing the Langevin affair, 
she feels obliged to remind the reader that Marie was only 39 when she was 
widowed, and had a healthy interest in men. When documenting Marie's arranging 
for Irene to get a position at the Curie Institute, Pflaum dismisses the 
irregularity, writing that "Scientists are not saints." Few of us think they 
are. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to Frederic's actions during the Nazi occupation when he worked with 
German scientists in his laboratory by day and, a Communist, fought with the 
Resistance by night, she asserts, "But those who never lived in an occupied 
country cannot, especially in retrospect, pass judgment on those who have." 
This is a peculiar statement on two accounts: She does not make any sort of 
case for Joliot-Curie's culpability, and if there was one, surely historians as 
well as all people of good will have the right, and perhaps the obligation, to 
judge human behavior in difficult times. 
</P>
<P>
With the Curies now gone, it is a good time to review the special role they 
played in the creation of a nuclear-shadowed world. Pflaum presents a generous 
portrait that they probably would have accepted as fair. 
</P>
<P>
I suspect that they would have objected, however, to the jacket copy, which 
says that the family won three Nobel Prizes in two generations. The number is 
five. Individuals who share the award do not receive half a prize, even when 
they happen to be married to each other.

O, HAPPY DAYS! ; 
</P>
<P>
WHEN WE WERE VERY YOUNG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY , Charles Perry is a free-lance writer living in Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES is kaput, they say. The quality of life has gone to the dogs. In 
the city that was for so long the fastest-growing in the world, you can hear 
natives talk about moving out, to Portland or Seattle or somewhere. The Golden 
Age of L.A. was the decade of "the good war," followed by the optimistic '50s. 
And now all the good times are gone. 
</P>
<P>
Every age romanticizes the past, of course -- usually the age before the last 
because memories have had longer to mellow. We're right to hold a vision of the 
past: It steadies our views on life. Still, it should be an accurate vision. In 
these harried times we need some detailed nostalgia, a closer look at the 
Golden Age. 
</P>
<P>
In the early '40s, I had no idea I even lived in Los Angeles. My home was a 
little farm town called Van Nuys, and so far as I could tell, it was the dusty, 
ragtag, tail end of the world. Everything on the radio was happening somewhere 
else, like the war in the South Pacific, or whatever it was that went on in a 
mysterious land called Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Though the San Fernando Valley was all about to change beyond recognition, my 
street was still full of chicken and turkey ranches, and there were commercial 
cornfields within a mile or two. Whatever else they might have done, everybody 
on my street raised a couple of acres of walnuts. Every fall, a family of 
braceros would come and shake down our walnuts with long pruning hooks and camp 
out in the orchard at nightfall. These were the only non-Anglos we ever saw. 
</P>
<P>
To the north, my world practically ended at the Southern Pacific tracks a few 
hundred yards from our orchard. Beyond the tracks, there seemed to be nothing 
but dirt roads and an occasional sunburnt paved road patched with tar, all in a 
vast sea of orange groves. For years, oranges were so important that when a 
frost was expected, the weatherman would tell orange growers to light heaters 
called smudge pots in their groves. 
</P>
<P>
We were so remote that the mailman made only one pass down our street a day, so 
all the mailboxes had to be on the same side of the street. That's the way a 
lot of our neighbors liked it, the Midwesterners who had achieved the great 
'30s dream of retiring in California and raising chickens. There was a strong 
Midwestern flavor to Los Angeles in those days, even some lingering dry 
sentiment. One local supermarket chain didn't start selling beer and wine until 
well into the '50s. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe I remember Van Nuys as dusty and ragtag because it was dusty and ragtag. 
After all, there was a war going on. All the cars were old, and the tires were 
worn down to fabric because of the rubber shortage. I remember my mother making 
soap from bacon drippings. 
</P>
<P>
She was sturdily patriotic about the war, and whenever she was asked to spell 
Van Nuys, she'd begin, "V, as in victory." However, she hated rationing as much 
as anybody and sometimes bought black-market hamburger meat in North Hollywood. 
Needless to say, it was injected with water to increase the weight, and when 
you put it in the pan, boiling droplets would skid everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
The war was actually changing Los Angeles in ways I couldn't see. It brought a 
lot of people, many of them black and Mexican, from out of state to work in the 
war industries. And they were just the beginning of the boom. After the war, 
there was a popular song titled "I'm Gonna Make the San Fernando Valley My 
Home." I couldn't believe my ears; a song about this old place? I almost 
blushed. 
</P>
<P>
It turned out people had started moving to L.A., and particularly to the 
Valley, in unbelievable numbers. There were whole industries catering to the 
newcomers. At Christmas, a company called Mission Pak would send boxes of 
exotic California fruit to your friends and relatives back East -- gloating 
souvenirs from the land without snow. 
</P>
<P>
After the war, there was a terrific housing shortage, and at one time an 
estimated 162,000 families were living in tents, garages and other makeshift 
dwellings. A poor family whose kids always had the sniffles moved into a 
converted chicken coop down the block from us. The city lumbered into action 
and maintained some Quonset huts left over from the war as cheap public 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
But the problem solved itself with amazing speed. Instead of going into a 
tailspin, as experts had predicted, L.A. started building houses at a dazzling 
pace. To me, the smell of the late '40s is a combination of pine, gravel and 
plaster. And what strange houses they were! One-story stucco houses without 
fireplaces, the kitchen counters topped with Formica in a peculiar pattern of 
tiny boomerangs. And all these little tract houses were advertised as "estates" 
or "ranchos" or "villas." 
</P>
<P>
For years on end, we were told the Valley was the fastest-growing place on 
earth. The flood of newcomers diluted the rural quality of Van Nuys. By the 
time I was in junior high, it was considered a stylish insult to call somebody 
a "dumb farmer." Even so, in the late '50s, Van Nuys High School still made a 
great fuss over its senior classes, a tradition from the days when few, if any, 
of its graduates went on to college. 
</P>
<P>
There was an industrial boom, too. Overnight, there were businesses everywhere, 
at first small, hopeful, undercapitalized places, and then major manufacturing. 
The words prices slightly higher west of the Rockies started disappearing from 
advertisements. The vacant land north of the Southern Pacific tracks, where my 
sister and I used to pick cattails, became the General Motors plant and called 
into being a place called Panorama City. 
</P>
<P>
Television finished off the isolated quality of the Valley. The big year was 
1949, when the number of TV sets in Los Angeles went from 80,000 to 354,000. By 
1951, when I was 10, if your family didn't have a set, you really couldn't get 
away with the excuse "we're waiting for color," and your parents finally had to 
buy one. This introduced you to the ordeal of doing without TV whenever your 
set was being repaired; there were no transistors yet, and a tube would blow 
every couple of months. 
</P>
<P>
There wasn't any satellite transmission, of course, so apart from some fuzzy 
recordings from New York called kinescopes, most of the programming originated 
locally. We were shocked when we finally saw "Howdy Doody," the New York 
children's show. How lame and patronizing it was compared with our own "Time 
for Beanie," the work of a bunch of hotshots straight from the Warner Bros. 
cartoon factory! I figured New Yorkers must be a bunch of dumb farmers. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, television undermined Hollywood's position as the center of the 
universe by siphoning off the general-interest audience that had been the 
mainstay of the old studios. Of course, by that time, Hollywood was already 
deglamorized for us -- it was just that place over Cahuenga Pass, and we 
accepted the presence of show people in our midst quite casually. Across the 
street from the Crystal Plunge, where if you went swimming too often your hair 
would turn green from the chlorine in the water, lived the comic cowboy actor 
Andy Devine, the "unofficial mayor of Van Nuys"; his son went to public schools 
with us. Jane Russell's family lived down at the end of my street, and later 
on, band leader Frank DeVol lived there, too. His daughter went to Fulton 
Junior High, so he wrote the school song for it. 
</P>
<P>
Even after TV, we went to the movies a couple of times a week, either to the 
Fox or the Bijou (I forget which one we called the Flea Bag). We were pretty 
blase about them, though. I had a friend whose father worked for a cartoon 
studio, and he would loftily critique the animation in the "Superman" serial as 
we watched. After a while, his family suddenly disappeared from sight, and we 
heard they'd been found out as Communists. 
</P>
<P>
My father worked downtown, which meant about an hour's commute for him. Then 
came the freeways; for years we saw maps with dotted lines that indicated where 
freeways were going to go. First came a short patch over Cahuenga Pass, and 
then, in spurts, the Ventura and San Diego freeways. Now my father could go to 
work without having to mess with surface streets, but it was still about an 
hour's commute. Everybody knowingly said the freeways were all obsolete as soon 
as they were built. 
</P>
<P>
Mayors Fletcher Bowron and Norris Poulson, who both looked like school 
principals to me, presided over a pretty placid time. Nearly all the issues 
revolved around the city's growth. The freeways: They were never built fast 
enough and were always too expensive. The Dodgers: Why, my father demanded, did 
he have to pay extra taxes to bring them here when he never watched baseball? 
</P>
<P>
And smog, which was much worse than it is today: Once or twice a year it was so 
bad that the schools would be closed. In the '50s, the County Air Pollution 
Control District didn't issue smog alerts, but it did measure what was in the 
air, and on the smoggiest day of 1955, it found an ozone level of 0.69. These 
days, they call a third-stage smog alert if the level ever gets above 0.50, 
something that hasn't happened in more than 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
For a long time, nobody was sure what caused smog. On Oct. 1, 1957, burning 
trash in a home incinerator became a crime, and everybody had to get an extra 
trash can just for non-combustible rubbish. The smog didn't go away, though 
particulate matter, which had sometimes been so bad that I saw strings of soot 
trailing from goldfish gills, got a lot better. At least the incinerator ban 
showed that the automobile was the chief culprit. 
</P>
<P>
The California car culture had been in bloom since the '40s. I remember my 
older brothers customizing a Model A Ford, tearing off the fenders and 
blowtorching the springs to lower the rear so that the car seemed to be leaping 
out of the road. By the '50s, cars were a full-fledged life style, and we all 
knew the cars to customize were old Mercs and '39 or '40 Fords. 
</P>
<P>
We '50s kids were more polished than the '40s kids with their wolf-whistle 
horns and loud "Hollywood" exhausts. We were into gorgeousness. We painted cars 
with flame designs or the fine outline patterns of a car painter named Von 
Dutch (both styles have long since been reduced to decals you can just stick 
on). We went to Tijuana to get plush "tuck and roll" upholstery. You had to 
remember to bring stout American thread for the workmen, or your upholstery job 
would come out after a couple of months. 
</P>
<P>
By now, it was a teen-ager's right to spend most of his non-sleeping and 
non-school hours in his car. A lot of kids' social lives revolved around 
cruising Van Nuys Boulevard and hanging out at Bob's Big Boy or Curry's ice 
cream shop. The hope was that two guys in customized hot rods would challenge 
each other to a drag race. 
</P>
<P>
To many grown-ups, this obsession with cars and rock 'n' roll smelled of 
juvenile delinquency. There certainly were young hoods around, but their 
criminality was pretty mild. They weren't on drugs, and their most fearsome 
weapons were the switch-blade knife and occasionally a primitive, homemade zip 
gun. 
</P>
<P>
Cars also made it possible for us to hit the beaches, where we discovered the 
car culture paralleled the surf culture, which was already a total way of life 
but as yet unknown to the rest of the country. A filmmaker named Bruce Brown 
was showing his home movies of surfing up and down the beach towns -- for 
instance, in the public shower room at San Clemente State Park. Eventually, 
he'd make feature films that would create a nationwide surf craze. My cousin 
was one of a number of Valley boys who thought of becoming professional 
surfboard makers. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the '50s, it was obvious that things were going to change even 
more. The first low-rise apartment building arose on my street. One of my 
teachers at Van Nuys High predicted commercial jet airplane flights, and 
another told about an amazing drug he'd tried, under doctor's orders, called 
LSD. 
</P>
<P>
Amid this growth, we lost a lot of things, of course. Much of what we lost was 
what every small town loses when it becomes a city: a ready neighborliness and 
a certain amount of innocence. By the '60s, you'd have to have been crazy to 
leave your house or your car unlocked for very long, or to accept anybody's 
check without ID. We also lost a certain small-town attitude of local pride. 
For a long time, there was a famous rivalry between L.A. and San Francisco, but 
only San Francisco is interested in keeping it up. 
</P>
<P>
But nostalgia for that time is not for everybody. The population of Los Angeles 
today is five times what it was in 1940, and that means there are about 6 
million people living here to whom the '40s are dim or blank. Old-timers always 
tend to glamorize the past, too. The Red Car trolleys, for instance; I remember 
them as scary. You had to stand out in the middle of traffic to catch them, and 
sometimes people got hit. And Red Cars didn't go everywhere. If you were near 
one of the stops, they were a pretty good deal, but if you weren't, you really 
wanted a car. 
</P>
<P>
And while some things may not have changed -- GTE was notorious for bad service 
even 40 years ago; it's nickname was "Drip, Drip and Tinkle" -- much has 
improved. The people who complain that the Los Angeles River is a "cement scar 
in the landscape" just don't know what it was like before our waterways were 
tamed. Every time there was a big rain, the Pacoima Wash would overflow and 
stores on Van Nuys Boulevard would have to be sandbagged. 
</P>
<P>
This is the bottom line: I don't remember a single bookstore in Van Nuys in the 
'50s, and at the same time there was a restaurant that used the slogan "Tough 
Steaks and Dull Knives." Altogether, with all its faults, I prefer the present.

Guy Dyer McGonagill retired as a lifeguard in 1980 but believes that he never 
really stopped being one. Now 63, he lives in an apartment above a garage in a 
wooded glen in Santa Monica Canyon, just east of Will Rogers State Beach. Every 
wall is covered with photographs of the ocean, and the bathroom still houses 
his diving gear. He was born in Santa Monica and was a member of the wrestling 
team at Santa Monica High School. 
</P>
<P>
 I grew up in Ocean Park, and Muscle Beach was great. All those big guys that 
were out there, they were hustling the chicks. The little guys were learning 
horizontal bars and rings and things like that. And the lifters were around. 
The lifters were a small, select group that stayed by themselves. But they 
never hesitated to teach you, and they were very patient with us kids growing 
up down there. 
</P>
<P>
During the war, some guy in Redondo Beach rode a heavy board and gave 
exhibitions -- picked it up in Hawaii. That was the start of surfing out here. 
Surfers were always considered oddballs. There was an old guy named Mr. 
Crawford that made paddle boards down opposite the gas tanks at Sunset and 
Washington (in Venice). And guys learned to ride 'em. Then they put a little 
skeg on 'em. I think Tom Blake was the guy who learned the skeg trick. Up in 
Malibu, there were guys who put their horses out in the sand and started 
whittling away with an awl, and clamping the wood together, making custom 
boards for guys like Dale Velzy and Hobie Alter. A lot of guys got a lot of 
scars from being hit by those heavy boards. You couldn't steer them, and there 
weren't any leashes either. You lose your board, you're in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
I started out at Brooks Street in Venice. Bodysurfing, board surfing -- I was 
on the beach all the time, diving off the pier for pennies. I didn't start 
lifeguarding until '49. You had to swim a thousand meters in under 20 minutes, 
and you had to be aware of the water. You made rescues; you learned how to 
paint towers; you learned first aid; you learned CPR, which was very crude. On 
the beaches, you always learned to watch people and see what trouble they were 
going to get into in the water. There were fewer people, and they obeyed 
authority in those days. 
</P>
<P>
Everybody on the beach knew each other and kind of got you in on it. Lot of 
dancing girls around, lot of parties, lot of luaus. There was a big Hawaiian 
group out here in the '50s. The city of Santa Monica would throw some luaus 
once in a while. Once we stole the pig, working one of these luaus, and we had 
some of Governor (Earl) Warren's kids with us, Honey Bear or somebody, and we 
all went up to the Uplifters club, which is now called Rustic Canyon Park, and 
we all sat up there and skinny-dipped and ate the pig. 
</P>
<P>
Surf was a lot better in those days, too -- bigger, higher. You had bigger and 
longer rides -- more power to it, it seems. The beaches were shorter; there 
wasn't as much sand. I think they started to build all those groins, like small 
piers, in there to retain the sand. All these bright marine engineers somehow 
never really figured it out, but an old rule of thumb is, you take something 
out of the ocean someplace, the ocean's gonna put it back in someplace else. 
</P>
<P>
The water was pristine clean. You could stand out at the end of the Santa 
Monica Pier and look straight down into 35, 40 feet of water, and you could see 
bottom. Look what they've tossed into the water now. 
</P>
<P>
Lifeguards are people who have sand in their toes. The best thing I ever heard 
was, "He's got sand in his toes." You like the beach, you like the sunrises, 
you like the sunsets. You like walkin' the beach. To this day, I can't go down 
to the beach and sit there and enjoy reading a book with my headphones on. In 
my time, the rules were: Don't turn your back to the sea, always watch the 
water, and never trust the lady. She's an unforgiving old lady. You learn to 
live with the ocean; it doesn't learn to live with you. 
</P>

Loren Miller Jr., a second-generation judge in Los Angeles County Superior 
Court, is the grandson of a slave. His father, who went to law school at 
Washburn University in Topeka, Kan., came to south Los Angeles to practice law 
in 1932. Miller, who was born in 1937 and now lives in the Wilshire District, 
attended the University of Oregon in Eugene, and received his law degree from 
Loyola Marymount. 
</P>
<P>
When I was a child, I went to Jack and Jill, which was an elite social 
organization for the kids of middle-class blacks. They used to take us to the 
Philharmonic to hear music, and they would have little social parties. The high 
school kids went horseback riding and had wienie bakes at the beach. In those 
days, Jack and Jill mostly consisted of light-skinned blacks. As prejudices go, 
that was one. The light-skinned blacks tended to be the people that got 
educated. They were obviously related to the slave owners, and when the 
opportunity presented itself after the Civil War, they got to go to college. If 
you look back at the people who were in the positions of leadership -- Roy 
Wilkins of the NAACP, Lester Granger, Thurgood Marshall -- they're all very 
fair-skinned. 
</P>
<P>
Middle-class blacks lived along Country Club Drive, between Pico and Olympic, 
west of Western going to about Arlington, and they lived along Jefferson 
Boulevard, say between Jefferson and Exposition, and into the avenues, and a 
little bit into Leimert Park. 
</P>
<P>
Right after the war, they built the Pacific Town Club. It was made up of 
professional people. It had a pool and a bar and a place where you could hold 
parties and such. It was on the corner of Montclair and Adams. In those days, 
there weren't a lot of social opportunities for blacks, you know, before the 
civil rights revolution, and the social life was pretty confined. 
</P>
<P>
A large number of our neighbors were Japanese, and they got relocated during 
the war. I remember visiting one family at the camp at Santa Anita race track. 
Soldiers with guns wouldn't let me go on the other side of the table, and they 
wouldn't let me play with my friends. 
</P>
<P>
My life was kind of protected because I'm sure my parents shielded me from lots 
of things until I went back to Kansas City with my father in 1948. I found 
segregation there for the first time. I saw a black movie house. From the back, 
the screen looked like a postage stamp. You could only go swimming one day a 
week. There was a particular day to go fishing, and we went in the park and a 
cop ran us off 'cause it wasn't our day. 
</P>
<P>
When I think back about it, Los Angeles was a segregated city. We didn't have 
legal segregation. I knew that. But all blacks knew you couldn't go to Bimini 
Baths, a very fancy bathhouse just east of Vermont on Bimini Place between 1st 
and 2nd streets. 
</P>
<P>
My dad handled some of the really big civil rights cases that the U.S. Supreme 
Court handed down at that time, especially dealing with restrictive covenants. 
In other words, you could always buy a piece of property, but there were 
covenants restricting the occupancy. The Supreme Court decided that was 
unconstitutional, and he handled that case. I remember my mother showing me the 
clipping from the Examiner because at that time, as I remember it, the L.A. 
Times did not print anything about blacks. If you were black, and accomplished 
something other than on the sports page, it was not going to make the L.A. 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
As teen-agers, we knew not to drive into Compton, to Inglewood, not to drive 
into Glendale 'cause you would just be out, with your hands on top of the car, 
filling out those white cards. LAPD did the same thing. You got too far south 
on Western, they would stop you. 
</P>
<P>
I went to high school, not on the west side of town where the (black) social 
strivers lived, but downtown, with the not-so-well-to-do. I think that it 
shaped my life a great deal in terms of knowing people and having compassion 
for people. There were some bad guys at Belmont; there were some gang bangers 
-- but school was neutral territory. 
</P>
<P>
There was something about L.A. in those days. There seemed to be always things 
to do. You could go to Beverly Hills to a little theater called the Hitchin' 
Post that showed nothing but cowboy movies or to the beach 'cause you could get 
there on the streetcar even when you were in junior high school. I'd walk to 
Griffith Park, but mostly we would ride our bikes there and go swimming. Then 
we'd ride up to the zoo, there by the merry-go-round, and play on the freeway 
they were building. 
</P>
<P>

The yearbook entry for Marian Saxon might have read: "Whittier High School 
Class of 1958. Class Song Leader, Freshman; Class Council, Freshman, Sophomore; 
Hi Jinx Variety Show, Sophomore. Future Business Leaders of America. Spanish 
Club. Favorite school lunch: spaghetti and pie. Cutest guy at Whittier: Ron 
Line. Or maybe Rod Gilliland." Bramlett, 49, lives in Hacienda Heights, where 
she is married and has a grown daughter. She oversees personnel for the 
Whittier High School District. 
</P>
<P>
I came to Whittier from Iron River, Mich., when I was 7. Before we left, my dad 
bought a brand-new 1947 blue Nash. Oh, I remember, that was luxury. We traveled 
2,500 miles straight through. When we came into Whittier, all of Whittier 
Boulevard was just solid orange groves. It was the first time I'd ever seen an 
orange tree, and we stopped and picked an orange. 
</P>
<P>
My mother was a fantastic cook. She was of the old country (Finland). We always 
had homemade bread and pies and cakes. For breakfast, she'd make anything any 
of us wanted. If someone wanted a waffle, they'd have waffles. If the other one 
wanted bacon and eggs, she'd fix that one bacon and eggs. If another wanted 
oatmeal, then they'd get oatmeal. I can't imagine latchkey kids now, coming 
home to an empty house, because I came home to a mother who said, "What would 
you like for a snack?" 
</P>
<P>
My life was school and my friends. I remember going to an all-girl assembly. 
Seventh grade was when you saw the movie -- the movie -- that told you about 
menstruation. They talked about the reproductive organs, and how babies -- 
although it wasn't clear to me at all what they were talking about. And I 
remember seeing little old sperms. I said, "What are those polliwogs doing 
there?" I remember coming home and asking my mother, "What is all this stuff 
about?" My mother said, "We don't want to talk about that. You'll learn when 
you get older." Well, I thought, my goodness, if my mom can't tell me about it, 
it must be something really different and strange, and so for years I didn't 
know what to make of all that. 
</P>
<P>
I was academic. I did belong to -- they called them service clubs, but as I 
look back now, we blackballed people. They were sororities. They were very big 
on the Whittier High School campus. I belonged to a club called Taimos. I 
remember Bedecs, Rianns -- about five clubs on campus. You pledged them. This 
was all forbidden on campus. In fact, I was looking through a stack of old 
newspapers, and right on the front page of the Cardinal and White was a little 
article on how it's against the education code of California to have secret 
sororities on campus. But we met once a week at somebody's house. 
</P>
<P>
Balboa Island during Easter week -- that was the place to go, and that's where 
all the teen-agers were. We rented a house and stayed there for a week. We had 
parties and we danced, ballroom dancing and the jitterbug. God, I met Ricky 
Nelson. He was "in" at that time. "Ozzie and Harriet" was on. He came into the 
house where I was staying -- brought his bongo drums. He sang and played the 
bongos until everyone learned he was there, then the police had to escort him 
off the island. Oh, well, now him. He was good-looking. 
</P>
<P>
We cruised Whittier Boulevard. That was the thing to do on Friday night. On 
Friday afternoon, we'd go to a ballgame. After the game, you'd just grab 
something to eat at somebody's house, then you'd hit the boulevard. There'd be 
four or five girls in the car, and Whittier Boulevard would be bumper to 
bumper, starting down near Washington, all the way back up to, gosh, where 
Bob's Big Boy drive-in was, which is California Street. And they'd come from 
all over -- Montebello, Fullerton, Pico Rivera, Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
You dressed up for this. We wore Angora sweaters with matching Angora socks -- 
that was "in." Or cashmere sweaters, with detachable Peter Pan collars that 
slipped inside them. Your hair was just perfect. I had long blond hair, flipped 
up on the ends, and bangs. 
</P>
<P>
And then the guys. A lot of them would park their cars and sit in front of the 
restaurants -- the main ones were Bob's Big Boy and Nixon's. It was owned by 
Richard Nixon's brother, Donald. Nixon's had the girls on roller skates who 
delivered the food on trays and hooked 'em on your cars. And the boys would sit 
on the brick wall in front and hoot at the girls as they went by, and we'd yell 
back and wave. I don't know when it ended. It had to be well into the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
When I was in school, kids really turned out for activities. I remember one 
prom was a spaceship theme. Back then, we decorated for days. We would hang 
white fabric, like clouds, to hide the gym. Proms were always held in the gym. 
School was it. I remember there being so many things to do. And everything was 
so much fun. 
</P>
<P>
</P>

Kurt Niklas began his restaurant career as a boy in Germany and came to Los 
Angeles in 1949 when he was 23. He landed a job as a captain at Romanoff's, an 
exclusive Beverly Hills dining spot of the stars, and moonlighted to make ends 
meet. After Romanoff's folded in 1963, Niklas opened the Bistro later that year 
and the Bistro Garden in 1978. Now 63, he lives in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
I recall that when I came here I had one job at the Mocambo. In those days, 
there was the Mocambo, Ciro's; the Trocadero had just burned down. Those were 
the three big nightclubs on Sunset. And the owner of the Trocadero was a 
legend, the founder of the Hollywood Reporter, William R. (Billy) Wilkerson. 
The Mocambo was owned by Mary and Charlie Morrison. Ciro's was started by 
Wilkerson also, then bought by Herman Hover in the '40s. 
</P>

I don't know exactly what year the Mocambo opened, but the war years were the 
good years. At its height, all the names, from Lana Turner to Betty Grable to 
Clark Gable, were there. But when I came, business was already declining. The 
fame of Sunset Strip was, of course, before TV. 
</P>
<P>
The Mocambo had -- in fact, they all had in those days -- some palm trees. Very 
tacky. Sort of Polynesian, I would say. It looked like a medium-size firetrap. 
On Monday nights, they had a Charleston contest. They had the Dixieland band, 
five firehousemen that came with the fire engine and parked it. . . . Ah, the 
Firehouse Five Plus Two. That was the big night. Louella Parsons would be 
interviewing some celebrity from the Mocambo. Then when things got even worse, 
famous entertainers like Frank Sinatra, Johnny Ray -- they all did free 
performances to help the house, to help Charlie Morrison pay the rent. But even 
they didn't help. The Mocambo just had to close in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
Nightclubs didn't serve dinner. You went to dinner first -- either to 
Romanoff's, to Chasen's, to Perino's or to LaRue, on the corner of Sunset Plaza 
Drive. There were four restaurants in town. Period. LaRue was more elegant and 
had better food than any restaurant at the time. The good people went there. 
The good people means the people who are not connected with the movie business, 
just well-to-do. I couldn't say professionals because doctors and lawyers are 
not the ones who keep a restaurant open. 
</P>
<P>
Romanoff's opened in '41. Before that, (Mike) Romanoff was a daily guest at 
Chasen's. He had no money at the time. He was the most charming liar since 
Baron Munchausen. (Dave) Chasen would most of the time feed him for free. He 
was with a group of single guys, and single guys are a pain in the ass: "Get me 
my check," "Put it on his check" -- something that waiters throughout the world 
don't like. Anyway, this group felt unwanted at Chasen's, and they said, "Mike, 
you're going to open your own joint." And that's how Romanoff's started. 
</P>
<P>
I remember that one night (show-business lawyer) Greg Bautzer and Joan Crawford 
spent $51 at Romanoff's for a four-pound tin of caviar, a bottle of 100-proof 
vodka, a bottle of Dom Perignon, and with the main course, a bottle of 
Romanee-Conti. So, you see, the value has changed. And I remember other people 
who were Romanoff's customers, who were well-dressed and you could see that 
they never worked a day in their life; they had money from their parents and 
they had a home either in Pasadena or in Bel-Air, and I'd say to myself, "I bet 
they must own $100,000." That was wealthy then. 
</P>
<P>
In a well-known restaurant -- I don't care if you are in Rome or Munich, or New 
York or here, or you have many millions -- there's two things that are 
universal. Number one, if you don't get the table that's supposed to be the 
table, no one, not a billionaire, will have the self-assurance to say, "Well, I 
say this is a good table." They all have to sit in the pecking order that makes 
it the good section in any restaurant. That's number one. Number two, if the 
owner sits with them, you can always see them looking around to see whether the 
others see that the owner sits with them. 
</P>
<P>
The social attitude of the '40s and '50s was very cliquish, just like it is 
today. You know, you have your A group, your B group, your C group. If you are 
A group, it's like a fortress; you cannot penetrate it. There is the A group of 
the movie people, mixed with the A group of the business people. But there's an 
A group of the social people that don't give a damn about movie people or 
business people. 
</P>
<P>
There are very few "normal" people that are not impressed by superficial 
values. Normal means not a celebrity. I'm sure there are some very accomplished 
people that couldn't care less. I think it's enviable, their life, that these 
people are not trapped by these superficial values.

Louise Sheffield was born in 1933 in Cambridge, Mass., where she began working 
at the age of 5 to help support her family. They moved to Silver Lake in the 
early '40s. Sheffield graduated from Marshall High School in 1950 and became 
one of Los Angeles' first women police patrol officers. A job in the Monterey 
Park detective bureau led to her career as an undercover investigator for the 
Internal Revenue Service and the Justice Department under Atty. Gen. Robert F. 
Kennedy. Now 56 and retired, she lives just outside Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 I started in with the California Rangers in junior high. It was a group of 
kids who got together around horses. We wore military uniforms and learned to 
do military formations with the horses at the old Sleepy Hollow stables over on 
Riverside Drive. I remember teaching marksmanship at the age of 12 with a .22 
bolt-action rifle. 
</P>
<P>
I think the Rangers were a factor in my joining the Marine Corps Reserve after 
high school. I was the first woman -- allegedly -- on the rifle and pistol 
team. Later I was brought into the intelligence unit, and I was the only woman 
in it. They started out teaching us Russian and the rest of it, the spying. 
</P>
<P>
I've always preferred being around men. Even when I was going to L.A. City 
College, I worked as a bouncer in a bar called the Sambah Room on Sunset near 
Virgil. 
</P>
<P>
As a woman, my main problem was my idealism. One evening I went out with a pro 
football player. We were going over to the old College Grill, near City College 
at Santa Monica and Vermont. As we approached the restaurant, there was this 
old man -- a tall, skinny, rickety old man on crutches -- and there were a 
couple of teen-age boys, big ones, pushing him around. I thought, "That's 
terrible!" So I said to the football player, "Look, you go break it up, and 
I'll make a phone call to the police." 
</P>
<P>
"What do you mean?" he says. "I can't get involved in that." So I went over and 
broke it up. That set me. I thought, "I want to be a cop so I can keep people 
from being hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Clifton's Cafeteria! They had lemonade springs in there. They had neon and gas 
lighting that was absolutely outrageous, and it was flowing throughout 
Clifton's. And -- this was proper then -- the police got their meals for 
half-price. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the Case Hotel, down on Broadway near Olympic, and they had the 
Marine Corps League Club meetings in there, and they had dances on the weekends 
for the servicemen, primarily Marines. I used to go there. We'd play games like 
checkers and cards, and dance and have refreshments. Elsewhere in the hotel, 
there was a swimming pool high above, and the idea of a suspended swimming pool 
was very exciting. 
</P>
<P>
When they had the opening of Curry's ice cream parlor on Riverside Drive, Bud 
Abbott and Lou Costello came. They were big then. I remember it as one of the 
thrills of my life. Mr. Costello had just lost a son who died under tragic 
circumstances. And, gee, he could relate to children, and children could relate 
to him. He bought me an ice cream cone, the most exciting one I've ever had. It 
was layered at an angle with all these different flavors. It had so many layers 
of ice cream I could hardly hold the darn thing. And he gave it to me.

Ruth Simon, a university lawyer for 11 years, has been associate campus counsel 
at UCLA for the past two. The daughter of a retired merchant, she was born in 
Chicago in 1937 and moved to Los Angeles in 1941. She grew up in Westwood and, 
at 52, still remembers her fifth-grade music teacher's name: Glorus S. 
Chambard. The Beverly Hills High School graduate earned her law degree at Boalt 
Hall at UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
When I was a kid, we walked to school with our lunch pails and sweaters that 
our mother knitted for us, which we lost with great regularity. We knew 
everybody. You'd walk by their houses, and then you'd pick people up -- a 
snowball effect. We knew kids back up to Sunset, down all the way to Holmby 
Park, down all the way to school. My neighborhood looked the same in 1946 as it 
does now. 
</P>
<P>
Where I lived was very secure. Our mother bought our clothing at Vera Eigner in 
Beverly Hills. I took dancing lessons at Miss O'Kane's in the Beverly Hills 
Hotel. We had a very strong sense of neighborhood. The milkman came around, the 
Helm's Bakery -- we knew all those people. You have a feeling when you're 
little that you don't ever have to go out of it. Everything you need is there. 
But the fact is, I did go out of it. Our parents didn't drive us places. 
</P>
<P>
I remember when I was still in grammar school, I went with two of my friends, 
Billy Orcutt and Ricky Bond, who both liked music, and rode the bus downtown to 
the L.A. Philharmonic to go to the children's concert -- from Westwood. Which 
would be unthinkable now. We met our school music teacher, who we were all very 
fond of. Then, on the way home, we got off at MacArthur Park and took a boat 
ride. Then we got back on the bus and came home together -- when we were maybe 
9. 
</P>
<P>
So many kids now don't go to neighborhood schools. They go to private schools; 
they're driven places. They don't get to go places alone because people are 
fearful, so they're coddled in a way we were not. I grew up in an affluent 
environment, and in many ways I was spoiled, but I wasn't wrapped in cotton. I 
didn't feel there was someone in my life who was fearful for my safety. Which 
means I didn't get fearful.

Frank Romero, 57, lives in West Covina, where he owns Frank's II Hair Salon, a 
39-chair hair salon in the West Covina Fashion Plaza. He also owns La Plazita, 
the Mexican restaurant upstairs, and several rental properties. As each of his 
four children marries, he helps the newlyweds buy a house. 
</P>
<P>
I was raised up in Phoenix. My mom died in 1940 when I was 7 years old, and my 
dad, well, just him and I were living together, and he had an alcohol problem. 
I was on the street, shining shoes, cleaning bars. 
</P>
<P>
When you don't have anyone to say, "Do this," you know, you usually don't do 
it. The teacher said, "If you don't do this, you'll never pass," so I flunked 
the seventh grade and never went back to school. 
</P>
<P>
In Phoenix, I got involved with whatever you want to call it, gangs. At the 
time, that was the thing to do, you know, join a gang. It was the pachuco era. 
We're talking about '46, '47, up to '49, and you know how it is, you get 
involved with a group here, and there's an enemy over there, and you start 
talking back and forth. Whatever it takes, you do. 
</P>
<P>
In those days, we used to wear those real baggy pants and the shiny black shoes 
with double soles, the big ducktail and long coats and the big chain. I never 
wore a hat, the Stetson hat, 'cause I couldn't afford one. 
</P>
<P>
There were a lot of fights, a lot of killings. I couldn't live that life. That 
was going nowhere for me, and I figured, I'll go into the service and go to 
school in there. Six months later, I was at the front lines in Kyongwon, North 
Korea. I was like a first scout for the platoon, and I was out in the front and 
somebody else stepped on a land mine and that's how I hurt my hand and my back. 
I got out a disabled vet in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
I didn't have a home to go to, and I had an older brother living in L.A., so I 
stayed with him until I started looking for work. I was just making enough to 
survive. Myself and two other guys, we rented an apartment downtown on the 
corner of First and Hope, which is now the Music Center, right there on the 
corner. There was a lot of gangs, a lot of prostitution, alcohol, drugs in that 
area. We just wanted to go out drinking and dancing. 
</P>
<P>
There used to be a ballroom called the Zenda Ballroom right across the street 
from the Hilton Hotel down on 7th and Figueroa. Latin people used to have 
players like Tito Puentes, Tito Rodriguez, Perez Prado. El Sombrero was 
another. The Rutland Inn. There were six or seven more. They were mostly places 
where you had to have a tie to get in, unless you rented or bought one at the 
doorway. 
</P>
<P>
I met my wife at the Zenda Ballroom in '55. I was sitting at the bar, she 
walked in, and I told this guy, "See that girl, yeah, I'm going to marry her." 
She was just something special. 
</P>
<P>
All I wanted was one thing: to go straight ahead on the path. And I couldn't 
find my way quite yet, how to get into that path, until I got married. So 
that's when I went to the VA, and they sent me down to USC to take all kinds of 
tests. I said I want something that I can get into now, and they mentioned the 
barber college. I said, "I'll be a barber then." 
</P>
<P>
I lived in East L.A. back then, and it was rough. Dames, drugs -- I would catch 
kids smoking grass in front of my yard. They were always loaded and partying 
and having their personal fist fights. If I had never changed, my kids would 
grow up thinking that's part of life. And I didn't want that. 
</P>
<P>
I go visit East L.A. once a week now to buy my chorizo. The place I go to makes 
it delicious. I go see my mother-in-law; she lives in one of our rentals. I 
visit one of my wife's nieces; she lives in one of our rentals. I love East 
L.A. because it seems like I never left the place. The environment, the 
Spanish-speaking people. They haven't changed. They see how I changed. They 
look up to me in a way.

THE GREATEST POLITICAL EXECUTIONER OF THE DECADE; 
</P>
<P>
IN THE NAME OF GOD THE KHOMEINI DECADE BY ROBIN WRIGHT (SIMON &amp; SCHUSTER: 
$19.95; 284 PP.; 0-671-67235-5)

</HEADLINE>

By Mansour Farhang, Farhang, currently professor of politics at Vermont's 
Bennington College, served as revolutionary Iran's first ambassador to the 
United Nations. His latest book, U.S. Press and Iran: Foreign Policy and the 
Journalism of Deference (University of California Press), is co-authored with 
William A. Dorman. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the contemporary world, the first draft of popular history is composed by 
journalists. When a distinguished journalist who has covered a landmark story 
for 10 years writes a book about the event, the result can add depth, scope and 
perspective to her original dispatches. Robin Wright is such a journalist, and 
her account of the Iranian revolution surpasses the expectation. 
</P>
<P>
The title of the book, "In the Name of God," signifies the centrality of 
religion (Shii Islam) in revolutionary Iran, and the subtitle, "The Khomeini 
Decade," recalls the Ayatollah's dominant role in defining the concrete 
dictates of the faith from the birth of the Islamic Republic on Feb. 11, 1979, 
to the day of his death on June 3, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
A chronology as well as an interpretive portrayal of events during this 
tumultuous period, this book is intended for general readers but does not avoid 
or impose labels or complex phenomena. Wright aims at explaining the degree to 
which the Iranian revolution has succeeded or failed in pursuit of its 
self-proclaimed goals. 
</P>
<P>
Wright, a reporter for the Los Angeles Times, begins her lucid narrative by 
placing Iran's grievances against the Shah's regime in historical perspective, 
and by doing so makes the Islamic revolution intelligible. Pointing out that 
the sudden fall of the Iranian state was a surprise not only to foreign 
specialists but also to native revolutionaries themselves, Wright shows that 
Alexis de Tocqueville's remark on the French Revolution -- "Never was any such 
event so inevitable, yet so completely unforeseen" -- is equally applicable to 
the Iranian cases. Thus when the Shah was forced into exile, his successors did 
not have a practical plan for the new Iran. 
</P>
<P>
What united the diverse elements of the spontaneous mass movement was more 
negative than affirmative. For a variety of sociohistoric reasons, the vast 
majority of Iranians had come to believe that the destruction of the monarchy 
would necessarily improve their lives. The kind or the degree of this supposed 
gain was not a matter of serious concern. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, in the early days of the victory, disagreements among the 
revolutionaries were so basic that calls for compromise invariably fell on deaf 
ears. Disputed issues included the name of the republic, the structure of 
authority, the role of the state in the national economy, the origin of 
political legitimacy, the nature of foreign policy, women's rights and the 
extent of autonomy for the national minorities: In the midst of a multifaceted 
clash of ideas over such questions, Khomeini remained the uncontestable source 
of appeal and arbitration. In the beginning, he seemed to be above 
factionalism, but as time went on, his close ties with the fundamentalist 
clerics became evident. 
</P>
<P>
The militant fundamentalists were determined to transform Iran into an Islamic 
state, but they had no clear idea of what the institutions and laws of such a 
state would be like. Even Khomeini, whose writings were more specific about 
political matters than were those of any of his colleagues, merely assigned to 
the government the traditional duties of protecting Islam, defending the 
frontiers, administering justice and collecting taxes. 
</P>
<P>
As Wright correctly observes, for months after the fall of the shah, "it was 
not at all clear that Khomeini intended for the Islamic Republic to become a 
theocracy, or a state ruled by the clergy." Indeed, evidence supports Wright's 
view that at first "Khomeini seemed content to leave the workings of government 
in the hands of the Tehran technocrats, while his role was at first limited to 
guide or counselor during disputes." 
</P>
<P>
The rise of Khomeini as the ruler of a theocratic Iran was as unimaginable to 
him as it was to the Iranian people. In fact, few even saw him as a threat to 
the progressive aspirations of the revolution. Precipitating the birth of the 
Iranian theocracy were: 1. the capacity of fundamentalist teachers (mullahs) to 
galvanize the urban poor and control the network of mosque-centered committees 
throughout the country, 2. the pathetic fragmentation of the secular forces and 
3. the lure of absolute power to Khomeini. Of these three factors, Wright 
thoroughly analyzes the first, makes some perceptive comments on the second and 
virtually ignores the third. 
</P>
<P>
The seizure of the American embassy in Tehran on Nov. 4, 1979, was the first 
pivotal moment in the post-revolutionary power struggle because it produced an 
irreversible advantage for the militant fundamentalists, drew Khomeini to the 
center of decision-making in the daily affairs of the state, checkmated the 
radical-left groups and put the liberal forces on the defensive. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrations in front of the American embassy compound that immediately 
followed the shah's admission to the United States on Oct. 22, 1979, were 
organized by the radical-left competitors of the clerics. This development 
deeply worried Khomeini and his lieutenants because it was the first occasion 
since the fall of the shah that leftists had taken the initiative in a major 
public mobilization. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan and the liberal forces he represented were 
opposed to such confrontation with Washington, but given the general public's 
perception of the shah's admission to the United States as a hostile act toward 
the revolution, they could not mobilize much support for their position. 
</P>
<P>
The militant fundamentalists responded to this volatile situation by stealing 
the issue of anti-Americanism from the radical left. They sent a group of their 
supporters to occupy the embassy to take the U.S. diplomatic personnel hostage. 
This was one of the shrewdest moves Khomeini made in his political career. 
</P>
<P>
Wright has done an excellent job of explaining the dramatic impact of the 
episode on Iran's domestic politics. She shows how Khomeini used the ensuing 
hostage crisis to consolidate his power and disarm or discredit his opponents. 
The dividends he gained from the situation convinced him that America was more 
useful to him as an enemy than as a friend. 
</P>
<P>
Wright also demonstrates how the Iran-Iraq war played into the hands of the 
militant fundamentalists and paved the way for the expansionist phase of the 
Islamic revolution. For the Iraqi invasion of Iran on Sept. 22, 1980 provided 
Khomeini with an opportunity to attempt to export the revolution in the name of 
defending Islam and Iran. In June, 1982, when Iran gained the upper hand in the 
war, Khomeini rejected any suggestion of settling the conflict through 
negotiation. 
</P>
<P>
The Ayatollah and his lieutenants were so mesmerized by their successes that 
they actually came to think that there was no limit to what their religious 
zeal could achieve. The clerics' intoxication finally was ended when the Iraqis 
managed to reverse the military balance and made it imperative for Khomeini to 
accept U.N. Security Council Resolution 598, which called for a cease-fire and 
peaceful resolution to the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
The guns fell silent at the end because both sides were exhausted, morally and 
economically, and because the Reagan Administration, in a reversal of its 
policy during the first seven years of the war, saw more benefit in ending the 
feud than in fueling it. A million deaths, 2 million wounded, hundreds of 
billions of dollars in material destruction and the immense suffering of the 
people could not move the 88-year-old spiritual leader of the Islamic Republic, 
but an actual threat to his regime was altogether a different matter. 
</P>
<P>
Wright's assessments of the Islamic Republic's performance are as valid as they 
are painful. It seems that the achievements of the "government of God" are 
limited to its own survival and the sharing of political power "beyond the 
wealthy, Westernized elite." The cost of this accomplishment, it must be noted, 
has been massive repression and the spread of terror among dissidents. In the 
decade of Khomeini there have been nearly 15,000 confirmed political executions 
in Iran -- far more than the combined number of such killings in the rest of 
the world combined. 
</P>
<P>
As for the Ayatollah's ambition to spread his message abroad, evidence shows 
that "Tehran's brand of Shi'ite extremism never took hold except in 
neighborhoods of chaotic Lebanon and among handfuls of Gulf Arabs." Even in 
Lebanon, the so-called pro-Iranian Hezbollah have been reduced to the mercenary 
types. Khomeini's fanatic followers in Lebanon came to a rude awakening with 
the revelation of the Ayatollah's secret contacts with Washington and Tel Aviv. 
</P>
<P>
In the economic sphere, the ruling clerics brought chaos and misery to Iranian 
society. Even the urban poor, their supposed constituency, were "more 
impoverished during the revolution's first decade than under the shah, with 
little to show for the 'dignity' that Khomeini had promised." And in the realm 
of dictating "moral" conduct, the Islamic regime's record is equally as dismal. 
While people were whipped in public for drinking alcohol, underground 
bootlegging became a multimillion-dollar trade in the theocracy. Similarly, 
even after nearly 2,000 drug-related executions and incarceration of 50,000 
addicts in labor camps, official statistics put the number of addicts at 1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Before the revolution, opium dominated drug use in Iran. Today heroin has 
displaced opium -- a vengeful victory for modernization in the Islamic 
Republic. As Wright concludes, when Khomeini died on June 3, 1989, his legacy 
included an uncertain future, a deeply polarized society, an increased 
dependency on the outside world for the nation's basic necessities, a cruel 
machinery of repression, Iraqi occupying forces on Iranian soil, a pariah 
status for Iran in the international community, a devastated economy and a 
pervasive feeling of disillusionment or betrayal for millions of Iranians who 
thought the revolution would produce some civility in their political life. 
</P>
<P>
Given Wright's realistic portrayal of what the decade of Khomeini did to Iran, 
it is puzzling that she chooses the religious honorific imam for Khomeini and 
presents him as a man of holy qualities. He did use such words as faith, vision 
and dream to characterize his motives and sensibilities. And after all, he was 
not the only national leader to have dragged God into war and politics; nor was 
he the first to leave the fighting to Him when the shortages of weapons, money 
and men became critical. 
</P>
<P>
But we cannot forget the fact that it was his ignorant and inchoate view of the 
world that prolonged an internecine war for six years and directed Iran's 
revolutionary energy toward the delusion of grandeur. In the words of Mahmud 
Dowlatabadi, Iran's foremost novelist: under Khomeini's guidance, "The word 
'war' became sanctified. The revolution, we were told, would flower in war." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it was not religious faith but psychopathology of power that shaped 
Khomeini's choices and turned him into a despot. He personally approved mass 
executions of political prisoners and never made an attempt to reason with his 
critics. He was a credible moral opponent of the shah, but once in power he 
became a shrewd connoisseur of intrigue and an extremist practitioner of the 
"ends justifying the means" game. 
</P>
<P>
He might have begun his career with wholesome intentions, but after 10 years 
ruling Iran, he demonstrated to us all that the exercise of absolute power can 
infect the prayer mat with more plague than it did the peacock throne.

In 1840, three years after the publication of "The Little Mermaid" and "The 
Emperor's New Clothes," Hans Christian Andersen received a royal grant that 
enabled him to travel to the Mediterranean and the Balkans. The diary from that 
journey has the unassuming appeal of his better stories. 
</P>
<P>
Andersen had a sharp eye for the details of daily life in other countries, but 
his observations are restricted to a personal level. He attends a concert by 
Franz Liszt and notices a fat woman in the audience, lolling on a couch "like a 
walrus with a fan," but never considers the significance of the composer's 
music. The diary includes four stories that Andersen wrote during his travels: 
"The Pact of Friendship" and "A Rose From Homer's Grave" seem a bit too 
self-consciously "adult," but "The Bronze Boar" and "My Boots" are genuinely 
charming.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE SEVEN LAMPS OF ARCHITECTURE BY JOHN RUSKIN (DOVER:

Originally planned as a study of the Gothic style, "The Seven Lamps of 
Architecture" (1849) emerged as a treatise combining religion, economics, 
morality and aesthetics. 
</P>
<P>
(The "Lamps" in the title represent principles that Ruskin believed were 
essential to good architecture.) Although his convoluted, Victorian prose may 
put off modern readers, Ruskin's arguments remain cogent. Los Angeles circa 
1990 would undoubtedly move him to despair. What other city so carelessly 
violates the tenet of the Lamp of Memory, "There are two duties respecting 
national architecture whose importance it is impossible to overstate: the 
first, to render the architecture of the day historical; and, the second, to 
preserve, as the most precious of inheritances, that of past ages"?

OUTTAKES: FELIX AND OSCAR II?

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, writer Neil Simon and producer Howard W. Koch -- 
last seen together in 1968 working on the hit film "The Odd Couple" -- recently 
powwowed at the Beverly Hills Tennis Club. Subject of conversation: an "Odd 
Couple" sequel. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a sequel like 'Police Academy 5,' " Koch told us. "We would pick 
up their lives 20 years later. They're older people now, not old men, but 
older. They have families and children. The comedic values are there, plus the 
dramatic values are there." 
</P>
<P>
Prior to the meeting, Matthau said of a possible sequel: "I'm sure (Koch) would 
prefer to call it 'The Odd Couple 2' to cash in on the words 'Odd Couple.' I 
was never for sequels, myself. Always avoided them. But I'm open to anything. I 
certainly wouldn't close my mind to fellows like Neil Simon, Jack Lemmon and 
Howard Koch." 
</P>
<P>
Simon's "The Odd Couple" has resurfaced in several forms since premiering on 
Broadway with Matthau and Art Carney in 1965, including a hit TV series and a 
female stage version. 
</P>
<P>
"We've always talked about doing a sequel through the years," Koch said. "It's 
been bothering me that we hadn't done it." So Koch asked for the meeting. "We 
came up with an idea for a story that we all agreed on. Neil said he would do 
it as soon as he can get some free time to write it, and then we'll go from 
there." Daniel Cerone

Richard Gere's latest turn is as a truly nasty cop in "Internal Affairs." And 
he'll be seen, come March, in director Garry Marshall's "Pretty Woman," as a 
wealthy New York businessman who attempts a Pygmalion-like transformation of an 
L.A. woman of the streets. 
</P>
<P>
But the role he would really like to play is a far cry from either. 
</P>
<P>
"There hasn't been a movie made in English about the Buddha," says the actor 
who is a devotee of Buddhism. "This is amazing, for he's one of the two most 
widely revered religious leaders ever. I've discussed the possibility of a film 
about the Buddha with the Dalai Lama (Tibet's exiled spiritual leader)." 
</P>
<P>
Gere says that Christopher Isherwood wrote a script for such a film before his 
death in 1986, adding, "I'm scouting around to find out if there is sufficient 
interest, financially speaking. . . . 'Gandhi' proved that Westerners are 
interested in world figures from other cultures who have eternal messages to 
give us, messages urgently needed today." 
</P>
<P>
And who might play Buddha? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm the right age," Gere says. "He began his ministry at about 30 and lived to 
be about 80. Besides, the Buddha (born Siddhartha Gautama, an Indian prince) 
was Caucasian. Everyone thinks, from the statues, that he was Oriental, but he 
wasn't." Boze Hadleigh

<P>
FOR THE RECORD 
</P>
<P>
In an item in last week's Outtakes, Richard Gere was quoted as saying that he 
would like to get a film project going about the life of Buddha and portray the 
religious leader in that movie. 
</P>
<P>
Gere, through his publicist, has denied speaking with the author of the item 
and says that he would never consider casting himself in such a role, which he 
feels should be played by an Asian. Gere, in fact, was never interviewed.

real-life All American Girls Professional Baseball League, which played from 
1942-53.

After quite a career splash with "The Fabulous Baker Boys" (a Golden Globe for 
best actress in a drama) and a starring role opposite Sean Connery in the film 
adaptation of John le Carre's "The Russia House" wrapped for fall release, 
Michelle Pfeiffer's about to hit the road in "Love Field." 
</P>
<P>
Pfeiffer will play a frustrated young woman who heads for the 1963 funeral of 
assassinated President John F. Kennedy -- hoping the historic event will 
somehow change her mundane life. 
</P>
<P>
En route to Washington, she has a chance encounter with a black man and the 
young daughter he's snatched from an abusive stepfather. Turns out they'll 
change the direction of her life. 
</P>
<P>
Midge Sanford -- who'll produce with partner Sarah Pillsbury -- declined to 
discuss the project with us ("It's too premature"). But she confirmed that 
they'll be reteaming with director Jonathan Kaplan ("Immediate Family"), and 
that the script marks the film debut of prolific TV series writer Don Roos. 
Casting's under way, and shooting is set for April in North Carolina, Virginia 
and D.C.

The title of the Orion project is also the name of the Dallas airfield where 
J.F.K. arrived for his fateful 1963 visit. Pat H. Broeske

'I LEARNED ALL THE traditional ways of creating flower arrangements," Chris 
Slack says, "but I never wanted to do them like anyone else." No chance of 
that. 
</P>
<P>
Slack doesn't create flower arrangements but rather natural still-life 
sculptures, with a magnificent bloom or spray of orchids as the focal point. 
"The Package" is a giant banana leaf folded to resemble a large green pocket 
book. Inside is an orchid, or perhaps chocolate truffles or champagne. "The 
Flower Wall" seemingly holds a bloom afloat in midair. Roses in "The Bamboo 
Log" look as pretty dried as they do fresh. For those who want to learn how to 
create such untraditional arrangements, Slack also teaches classes.

WITH MORE THAN 100 million Americans now spending most of their waking hours in 
offices, the workplace is emerging as the new frontier of contemporary design. 
But what is good office design? From pencil holders to computers, it means 
products that blend aesthetic appeal with functional efficiency, products that 
take advantage of solar power, ergonomics and the constraints of time and 
space. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena's Art Center College of Design presents "Good Offices," some 150 
examples of the best-designed office equipment and products in the world -- 
from such old chestnuts as the IBM Personal Computer Model 30 and the "NeXT" to 
the high-tech Canon Faxphone 8 Personal Desktop Transceiver and the lowly 
pushpin, now transformed into a sculpted steel-and-rubber supergizmo.

STAGE WEEK: 'DEATH' ONE-ACT IS CLASSIC WOODY ALLEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Play it again, Woody. Hollywood's Attic Theatre is about to present its second 
annual Woody Allen one-act play. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, Allen's "God" had a successful run there. Now comes the companion 
piece, "Death" (1975), opening Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"Kleinman is your classic Woody Allen schlemiel character," explained Attic 
artistic director James Carey. "He's awakened one night by a gang of vigilantes 
in search of a murdering fiend who's knocking off 6 to 12 people a night. The 
police can't stop him; no one knows who he is. The vigilantes say they have a 
plan -- although they never tell us what it is. Kleinman is pulled into the 
chase totally unwillingly. He says things like 'Maybe my boss will be there; I 
should dress for the occasion.' " 
</P>
<P>
The ending is equally irreverent. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very much a Woody Allen-type play -- looking at life, death, God and 
sex," Carey emphasized of the hourlong piece (which will play at 8 and 10 
p.m.). "Dark, yes. It's a very black comedy, and we're doing it very broadly. 
The script really lends itself to a slapstick, Marx Brothers, almost burlesque 
style. So the set is two-dimensional cutouts on a pulley system, and as the 
characters walk across the stage, stagehands move the scenery. It's very 
cartoonish and yet realistic. It has his sense of humor." 
</P>
<P>
THEATER BUZZ: Things have been hopping at the Mark Taper Forum, where the 
demand for sold-out performances of Kenneth Branagh's Renaissance Shakespeare 
Company has resulted in lines at the box office beginning at 8:30 a.m. on 
Saturday (the box office opens at 10 a.m.) and at 2 p.m. for the evening 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the line-dwellers also have taken up a practice used by next-door 
"Phantom of the Opera" hopefuls: "borrowing" chairs from the adjacent Music 
Center Plaza to ease the long wait. As a result, mid-day picnickers at the 
plaza now do their lunching standing up. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, over at the Taper press office, the publicists have been busy 
fielding complimentary ticket requests from an endless stream of would-be 
theatergoers. Like: the out-of-town journalist, whose play reservations hadn't 
been confirmed, but nonetheless called to announce that her airline 
reservations were set and that she'd be arriving that weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Or the writer from a late-night talk show who called one of the publicists many 
times each day for a week, offering "special" passes for the free tapings of 
his show as reciprocation for tickets. Or the friends (and friends of friends) 
who hadn't been heard from in years. Or all the callers claiming to be 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Said the publicist: "I've certainly found out about a lot of newspapers, radio 
programs and cable TV shows I'd never heard of before." 
</P>
<P>
CRITICAL CROSSFIRE: In spite of the public clamor, local reviewers were mixed 
in their appraisal of the Renaissance's Company's repertory program of "King 
Lear" and "A Midsummer Night's Dream." 
</P>
<P>
Said Sylvie Drake in The Times: "What's lacking all around is substance. 
Penetration. Subtlety. Branagh's world is a place without nuance, a long drink 
of cold water, limpid, refreshing, healthy but without aftertaste. The 
productions . . . explode. They don't dig deep and don't touch us deeply." 
</P>
<P>
In the Hollywood Reporter, Ed Kaufman said of "Lear": "What the talented and 
inventive Branagh has done is to make Shakespeare accessible for all; yet in so 
doing, he has virtually stripped the figurative quality (and so the 
metaphysical 'overview') from a tragedy that questions everything.." 
</P>
<P>
In reviewing "Lear," Daily Variety's Jim Farber wrote: "Branagh, as director, 
shows himself a young man willing to take on the biggest challenges, able to 
give 'Lear' a sense of grit and violence, but not ready to instill the 
experience with the multiplicity of layers that complete the drama."

RECORDING A CRITICAL 'RIGOLETTO'

<TEXT>
<P>
Both of these recordings purport to use the recent critical edition, but only 
Muti's is the real thing. No official mention of an edition of any kind is made 
in the actual London release. Apparently, such reference is too complicated for 
American consumers. British purchasers, however, get a program note from 
Chailly explaining that he consulted with the singers before deciding to keep 
in certain "performance traditions." Translated, that means if Pavarotti, 
Anderson and Nucci didn't want to learn new passages and wanted to keep 
accustomed high notes, they were given permission. 
</P>
<P>
Chailly offers a brisk, no-nonsense performance with strong dramatic accents. 
Anderson's Gilda shows both purity of tone and bravura brilliance. She commands 
Sutherland-like solidity in the middle and lower ranges, if not her 
predecessor's perfect trill. Pavarotti gives his most thoughtful, nuanced and 
imaginatively characterized singing on records in years. Nucci's contribution 
is generally monochromatic, hard pressed in the climaxes. Verrett's Maddalena 
is tentative (she sounds as if she's sight-reading) and barely audible in the 
middle register. Ghiaurov remains a smoothly effective Sparafucile. 
</P>
<P>
Muti's grasp of the score is masterly, and the splendid Scala orchestra 
responds with brio, but "Rigoletto" is not just a conductor's opera. No high 
notes here, and considering his cast, it's just as well. 
</P>
<P>
Although Zancanaro's suave baritone is superior to Nucci's, Dessi is a rather 
acidic Gilda whose soprano turns ugly when pressure is applied. La Scola's dry, 
constricted tenorino might be appropriate for Arturo in "Lucia," certainly not 
for the elegant Duke. Senn is an ordinary Maddalena, but Burchaladze's bass, 
though wobbly, creates a subtly menacing assassin. 
</P>

The occasion for this potpourri concert, the Met's spring 1988 visit to Japan, 
summoned superlative sonics in Tokyo's Bunka Kaikan and gleaming performances 
from all participants. Domingo's attempts to fill Don Giovanni's baritonal 
shoes remain as bewildering as ever, but he and Battle infuse duets from "La 
Traviata," "L'Elisir d'Amore," "The Merry Widow" and "Romeo et Juliette" with 
considerable poise and style. Levine's traversals of the overtures to "La Forza 
del Destino" and "L'Italiana in Algeri" are spit-and-polish affairs, and the 
audience reaction is understandably vociferous. ALLAN ULRICH

This is a live recording made in 1988 from the stage of Moscow's Bolshoi 
Theater, in celebration of the millennium of Christianity in Russia. The choir 
gives an expressive performance, but the high points of the hour-long concert 
of 12 selections are the solos by the rich-voiced Arkhipova. Inadequate program 
notes. WILLIAM RATLIFF

<TEXT>
<P>
The century's last decade has just begun. A nation long regarded as a world 
superpower seems at the apogee of greatness, flaunting its wealth and prestige 
like a bedizened courtesan. 
</P>
<P>
A strata of self-doubt lurks just beneath its rhinestone encrusted surface. A 
humiliating defeat in a war with a third-rate power still rankles and 
everywhere there are fissures in the frosting -- government is wracked with 
scandal, drug and alcohol use escalate alarmingly, conservative forces harden 
position while radicals plant bombs or drift into mysticism. 
</P>
<P>
A country proud of its cultural modernity hoists one more glass of bubbly while 
glancing covertly at two threatening peoples -- the Germans and the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
Familiar as it all sounds, the scenario is not about the United States in the 
1990s. It is about France in the 1890s -- the Franco-Prussian war, not Vietnam; 
the Dreyfus affair, not Iran-contra; La Belle Epoch, not "The Bonfire of the 
Vanities." It is particularly about a historic exhibition opening to the public 
Wednesday at the Museum of Fine Arts. 
</P>
<P>
"Monet in the '90s" is a singular art event reuniting the largest number of the 
artist's renowned "series" paintings to be assembled since they were executed 
</P>
<P>
and dispersed a century ago -- 90 of them, just so we don't lose the theme. 
These nuanced variations on such landscape motifs as poplar trees, grain stacks 
and the facade of Rouen Cathedral have multiple happy properties. 
Postcard-popular with the general public, they are also awesome icons for 
cognoscenti who regard them as seedbeds of modern art and the source of 
contemporary serial painting, which involved everybody from Andy Warhol to 
Frank Stella. 
</P>
<P>
In short, the museum has a blockbuster that even the fussiest connoisseur 
cannot disdain. It will surely pull big crowds until it closes here April 29. 
It then travels to Chicago's Art Institute and London's Royal Academy, which 
co-organized the event. No, it won't go to Los Angeles, and more's the pity. 
</P>
<P>
C'est dommage, because it is not only a superb, revealing show but because the 
title is a significant pun. "Monet in the '90s" means what is says but it also 
means the way the 1990s look at Monet. 
</P>
<P>
By now, alert readers may be asking themselves about the connection between 
Monet -- the quintessential art-for-art's-sake Impressionist -- and social 
upheavals in France at the fin de siecle. Didn't the artist known as 
just-an-eye-but-what-an-eye simply do his dappled thing while Paris wallowed in 
enticing decadence? 
</P>
<P>
Well, not according to the compelling catalogue written by the show's 
organizer, Paul Hayes Tucker of the University of Massachusetts, Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker -- a Monet specialist -- thinks in a radical revisionist art historical 
manner much abroad in academia. The method goes beyond traditional questions of 
style, school and individual artistic psychology to link art and artists to 
larger social, political and economic issues. It tends to demythologize 
comfortable, romantic notions about the artistic character. Tucker paints a 
portrait of Monet as a shrewd, self-promoting entrepreneur with a sharp eye on 
the competition, the market and public taste. 
</P>
<P>
The artist was pushing 50 -- and working in an Impressionist manner that even 
his contemporary, Pissarro, called "rancid" -- when he did his first series 
paintings. According to Tucker, different suites intended to counter the 
competition of the radical young Seurat prove the old dog could still absorb 
the new tricks of decorative Symbolism, soothe the rattled nationalism of his 
audience with reassuring traditional rural themes and -- finally -- express 
utter disgust with the rapacious anti-Semitism of the Dreyfus case. After that, 
Monet retired to his garden at Giverny. There he painted the "Japanese 
Footbridge" series, presumably as an encouragement to emulate Oriental 
reverence for nature and private meditation. 
</P>
<P>
Whew! To believe all that is to believe artists are capable of conducting their 
careers as a kind of three-dimensional chess game. 
</P>
<P>
But Tucker's text, although often highly circumstantial, frequently rings true. 
During this period, Monet made the final transition from scruffy bohemian to an 
artist of immense wealth and the stature of a national hero. Critical response 
to his exhibitions was so ecstatic that newspapers like Le Gaulois devoted 
whole supplements to his art. He must have been doing something right, even if 
much of this putative French nationalist art sold to Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, we know artists like this. In California alone, people like Robert 
Irwin or Robert Graham are almost as admired for their career tactics as for 
their work. With Monet, as with them, it remains an open question whether their 
amazing astuteness arises from intuition or calculation. Whichever, Monet is 
characterized very much in the mold of the artist going into 1990s -- the canny 
pro rather than the visionary seer. 
</P>
<P>
One thing is certain. When we come to actually look at the Monets, tactical and 
sociological questions give way to issues that are universal and poetic. 
</P>
<P>
These are still the paintings that make us hear Debussy in the background. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker has simply proven again that you can slice art many ways without 
wounding it. 
</P>
<P>
The first suite on view is a group of eight canvases done in the Creuse Valley 
in 1889. Each depicts a mounded landscape cradling a section of river under 
changing light. "Sunlight Effect" approaches the rugged naturalism of Courbet, 
"Evening Effect" muffles tone and shape so closely as to point to abstraction. 
</P>
<P>
Curious. We are so accustomed to associating Monet with the dappled delicacy of 
stereotypical Impressionism that it is a surprise to feel this work burly and 
somewhat inert under its surface texture. 
</P>
<P>
The effect goes away in half a dozen graceful views of fields at Giverny but 
returns in 15 pictures from the famous "Grain Stack" suite, with its humble 
conical piles enduring the heat and snow of the seasons. 
</P>
<P>
(The French like to complain, "En ete on crame, et on hiver on caille" -- "In 
summer we boil and in winter we freeze.") 
</P>
<P>
If we want to have unaccustomed thoughts about Monet based on the pictures, it 
is their revelation of a quality not unlike Expressionist anguish. Fairly 
subtle most of the time, it is most obvious in mountain paintings he did on a 
visit to Norway. We suddenly find him predicting the neurotic tensions of an 
Edvard Munch. 
</P>
<P>
There is something phantasmagoric about the grain stacks -- they look scruffy 
and defensive, like dwarf Abominable Snowmen ready to mount a crazy attack on 
anybody who disturbs their elemental hibernation. 
</P>
<P>
Monet worried and complained about his art so consistently that his wife once 
said that being disgruntled was part of his nature. When he was painting the 
now-revered Rouen Cathedral suite, he had nightmares about the building. "It 
fell on me," he wrote, "and seemed to be pink or blue or yellow." 
</P>
<P>
So much for the serene patriarch of Giverny. This sounds more like the 
visionary disturbance of a Van Gogh. 
</P>
<P>
The "Cathedrals" series -- seen here in 10 versions -- creates an odd, even 
upsetting tension between the stout solidity of the building and Monet's 
liquefying light. His struggle with them shows. They exist somewhere between 
noble failure and narrow triumph. 
</P>
<P>
One is left convinced that Monet made his art in a state of struggle against 
depression. 
</P>
<P>
But only half the time. 
</P>
<P>
The artist was grumpy and obsessive. He could turn the latter quality to good 
use in the real world, as when he mounted a successful subscription campaign to 
have Manet's "Olympia" given to the nation, or fought tenaciously to build his 
Giverny water garden or save the poplar trees on his property line. He was 
bear-like and formidable. 
</P>
<P>
But his favorite painting was Watteau's exquisite "Embarcation for Cythera." 
His favored colors were green and lavender -- said to be the hues of the pure 
aesthete. 
</P>
<P>
The suites of series paintings virtually alternate between moody downers like 
the grain stacks and lyric celebrations like the "Poplars." The trees stand 
like serpentine rows of slender girls in pale green dresses, billowing hair 
united by mischievous winds. 
</P>
<P>
If we want to fool around with fashionable theories about what makes artists 
tick, we could do worse than to explain Monet as a manic-depressive. Like most 
analysis, that's too gross but it sets some useful parameters. 
</P>
<P>
Monet was really a blender and rectifier -- a very French seeker of harmonic 
compromise, a very individual pioneer of new frontiers carefully gained. 
</P>
<P>
The most useful metaphor for Monet is the idea of the cinematic lap-dissolve. 
His work demands that the viewer make subtle distinctions. We find ourselves 
wishing they could all be projected on one spot to more clearly show his 
caressing light, lengthening shadows and changing seasons. 
</P>
<P>
With Monet, everything dissolves into everything else. Illumination on a 
hillside changes furrowed earth into choppy water. The act of depicting the 
land dissolves into pure painting. His melancholy dissolves into his joy to 
produce the poignant "Mornings on the Seine." Talk about harmony. No wonder he 
liked Whistler. 
</P>
<P>
The final suite on view is the lovely "Japanese Footbridge" set. Poor 
installation does not diminish either its sense of fulfillment or its symbolic 
message. In most versions, the bridge leads out of the canvas to new 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
One wanders backwards through the exhibition to be struck by the overriding 
common property of the paintings. Almost without exception, they want to be 
bigger. They strain uncomfortably at their frames like Samson in the Temple. 
</P>
<P>
Monet died in 1926 at age 87. He still had more than a quarter-century to paint 
in his garden after the footbridge suite. The result was the magnificent, huge, 
waterlily paintings that burst his final limitation, size. Of course he grumped 
the whole time. 
</P>
<P>
Monet's work does send a message to the 1990s. When the world lets you down, 
cultivate the inner garden and let no man trample its fruits.

ART NEWS: 'MARGINS' PROGRAM WILL CONTINUE AT SANTA BARBARA 
</P>

<P>
The University Art Museum at UC Santa Barbara plans to continue "Margins," a 
program showcasing new directions in art, presenting a total of four shows each 
year, said curator Phyllis Plous. 
</P>
<P>
The "Margins" program, which began with the museum's current show, "Fred 
Fehlau: A Pictorial Installation" (through Feb. 25), was financed this year by 
a $7,500 grant from the South Pasadena-based Flintridge Foundation. Plous said 
the foundation has invited her to reapply for a grant next year, and that she 
will also seek awards from other foundations and the National Endowment for the 
Arts to continue the program on a yearly basis. 
</P>
<P>
"This is something that we've been wanting to do for years," said Plous, adding 
that "now with the security of this funding, (our exhibitions) don't have to be 
regional. We can go beyond the security of (artists from) California, and 
that's important to me." 
</P>
<P>
Plous said the program will focus on emerging artists, but will also feature 
"mid-career artists who start to do something totally different from what 
they've done before." Already scheduled are shows by Oakland painter Rick 
Arnitz (March 6-April 29), and Los Angeles installation artist Megan Williams 
(in November and December). Those under consideration for future shows, Plous 
said, include French sculptor Patrice Caire, East Coast installation artist 
Steve Appleton, New York sculptor Dean McNiel and Los Angeles artists Maura 
Bendett and Sarah Seager. 
</P>
<P>
Plous said that with the exception of the summer months, the museum's 
15x30-foot South Gallery will be devoted entirely to "Margins" shows. That way, 
she said, the artists will be able to work with a contained space "where they 
can do anything they want -- as long as the walls still stand." 
</P>
<P>
" 'Margins' really formalizes an irregular program that we've been doing on an 
under-funded basis for sometime," said Plous. "It's exciting for us." 
</P>
<P>
LATINO GALLERY: A new downtown gallery dedicated to the vision of Chicano and 
Latino artists opens Saturday with an inaugural show of works by the gallery's 
co-owners, Chicano artists Linda Vallejo and Ramses Noriega, as well as works 
by self-taught newcomer Daniel B. Salazar. 
</P>
<P>
"The Chicano and the entire Latino community are behind us," said Consuelo F. 
Norte, administrator of Galeria Nueva. "They really want to have this take off, 
not only because it will open the door to their own personal art, but because 
it will better communication between (Latinos) and the international community. 
Art speaks to all nationalities." 
</P>
<P>
Consuelo said that the inaugural show will run through April 7, during which 
time the gallery would "gather a bank of Latino artists" for future shows. An 
invitational show will be held in the coming months, she said, as will shows by 
both emerging and established artists of Latino descent. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a wealth of art and a wealth of artists that have never been 
addressed because there has been no forum for them," said Norte. "We want to 
provide a forum for these incredibly talented artists. 
</P>
<P>
Galeria Nueva's grand opening reception will be held Saturday from 6:30-9 p.m. 
The gallery is at 312 E. 3rd St. 
</P>
<P>
ART IN THE THEATER: Painter and sculptor Richard Artschwager has designed the 
scenery for the West Coast premiere of Orson Welles' adaptation of Christopher 
Marlowe's "The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus." The play, the inaugural 
production of USC's new Contemporary Artists in Theater series, will be 
performed at USC's Bing Theatre Thursday-Saturday and Feb. 15-17 at 8 p.m.; and 
next Sunday and Feb. 18 at 2 p.m. The Contemporary Artists in Theatre series, 
which will consist of one production each year, matches visual artists with 
drama classics. The visual artist selected that year will then create his or 
her own personal vision of the play through the scenic design. According to 
USC's Division of Drama, artists under consideration for future productions 
include sculptor and painter Jim Dine and conceptual artist John Baldessari. 
Tickets: (213) 743-7111. 
</P>
<P>
PRINTMAKING: The Fine Arts Foundation of Scripps College today will present 
"Hands On," a printmaking festival, from noon-4 p.m. in the rear courtyard of 
the Claremont Graduate School Art Building, 251 E. 10th St., Claremont. Prints 
on display will include limited editions by artists such as Millard Sheets, 
Phil Dike and Alan Blizzard. Artists will demonstrate the processes and the 
equipment used by contemporary printmakers, and children will be able to make a 
print to take home. Proceeds from the $8-per-person ($4 for children) event 
will go to the Millard Sheets Scholarship fund. (714) 941-8566 or (714) 
624-1778). 
</P>
<P>
COLLECTIONS: Sixty-four percent more corporations started art collections in 
the 1980s than in the 1970s, according to the 1990 edition of "The ARTnews 
International Directory of Corporate Art Collections." According to the 
directory, whereas only 139 corporate collections were begun in the '60s, and 
245 in the '70s, the '80s saw the start of 403 new corporate collections, 
including 121 in the decade's final three years. "As we enter the '90s . . . 
corporate collecting is expanding dramatically on a global basis," said the 
directory's editor, Shirley Howarth. "Not only have the number of collections 
grown, but we're seeing the development of important collections in such new 
areas as photography, contemporary crafts, tribal arts and folk art." 
</P>
<P>
KUDOS: The Tate Gallery in London has awarded the prestigious 1989 Turner Prize 
to British artist Richard Long. The award, which includes a 10,000 prize, 
(about $15,700 U.S.), is given annually to the contemporary artist who has 
contributed the most to British art through the year. Previous winners include 
Tony Cragg, Richard Deacon and Malcolm Morley. Long's most recent Southern 
California show was "Richard Long," at the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art 
last fall. 
</P>
<P>
NOTES: "Art in Public Buildings, 1978-89," a documentary exhibit of artworks 
commissioned for state buildings by the California Arts Council and the State 
Architect's Office is on display in Redding, at the Old City Hall Gallery, 1313 
Market St. Many of the state's most prominent artists, such as Laddie John 
Dill, Robert Hudson and Claire Falkenstein, have participated in the Art in 
Public Buildings program, and are included in the exhibition. . . . Those who 
thought they wouldn't have time to catch the National Gallery of Art's 
"Frederic Edwin Church" show now have an extra seven weeks in which to do so. 
The extended closing date for Church's 19th-Century landscapes is March 18.

ANNOYANCE II -- THE WINE LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The waiter, in his haste, poured the bottle of wine into the glass and splashed 
red wine on the patron's white sweater. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, look," she said, in mock humor, "I now have a sweater decorated with 1983 
Barolo." 
</P>
<P>
The waiter never saw his faux pas, didn't hear the woman, and never saw her 
hastily whisk at the wine before it was absorbed into the fleece. 
</P>
<P>
The incident was only one of several I witnessed and experienced at Bice, where 
the wine program is one of the worst I have encountered in recent years. 
Service is condescending and the wines you can get are extremely limited. 
Moreover, the owners don't even know the laws, so you are prohibited from 
taking an open bottle of wine, one you have paid for, home with you, as 
permitted in California. 
</P>
<P>
My own experiences there were unnerving and, finally, frustrating because of a 
wine menu that has a lot of wine listed but, apparently, not much of it 
actually in stock. This necessitated a little game with the staff when I: 
</P>
<P>
* Ordered a bottle of 1978 Gattinara ($35). A manager came over to inform me 
they were out of this wine. I asked for the wine list again. 
</P>
<P>
* Ordered the 1983 Aldo Conterno Il Favot ($33). The waiter brought us the 1985 
Il Favot and hoped I wouldn't notice the wrong vintage. I noticed. He said the 
restaurant was out of the 1983. I asked for the wine list again. 
</P>
<P>
* Ordered a 1981 Brunello from Fattoria dei Barbi ($35). The waiter brought the 
1981 Brunello from Lisini ($45), showed me the bottle and hoped I wouldn't 
notice the difference. I noticed. He then said he was out of the other Brunello 
and that this one was just as good. I asked for the wine list again. 
</P>
<P>
At this point a manager came over and told me: "When we opened, most of the 
good vintages were unavailable." (Actually, most of the wines listed on the 
Bice list are available from various suppliers.) 
</P>
<P>
So why did Bice list these wines if they never had them? Or, if they had only a 
bottle or two of them, why do they persist in using a list now so incorrect? 
</P>
<P>
The answer comes from the bottom of each page of the list. This is not the wine 
list from Bice in Beverly Hills; it is the wine list from Bice in Chicago that 
was merely transported to Beverly Hills. What the owners did was simply mail 
their Chicago wine list to Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
But without shipping the wines. They covered themselves by printing this 
disclaimer: "We apologize if some of these wines are not always available since 
market conditions are fickle and at times thwart our effort . . . " Market 
conditions don't change that much, how else could Valentino, Trattoria Angeli, 
Joss and a dozen other places offer wines as good as Bice's listed wines? 
</P>
<P>
Back to my travails of trying to find a wine. Next, the manager suggested a 
bottle of wine that sold for $50. Now, until this point I had been ordering 
wines that sold for about $35. I asked to see the wine list again. At long 
last, from a most frustrated and exhausted waiter, I ordered the 1982 Badia a 
Coltibuono Sangioveto ($35, which actually is reasonably priced since the wine 
retails for $23.50). 
</P>
<P>
The waiter brought the right bottle (!) but upon opening it, he never presented 
us the cork. Once it was out of the bottle and off the corkscrew, he put it in 
his pocket, another faux pas. Then the waiter poured the glasses nearly full, 
making it impossible to swirl the wine. While he poured, he shouted over his 
shoulder at a passing busboy, splashing wine down the side of my glass. 
</P>
<P>
Then he placed the bottle right next to the candle, so the wine would get nice 
and warm. (I moved them apart.) 
</P>
<P>
It was an evening when I wanted to sip a small amount of wine and take the 
remainder home. With about one-third of the bottle yet to be consumed and 
dinner over, I asked to take the rest of the bottle with me. 
</P>
<P>
The waiter shuddered, left and was rapidly replaced by another manager. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sorry, we can't let you take the wine with you," he said. "It's against 
the law." He said it was legal in New York, where he was from, but not in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
After a lengthy discussion in which I told the manager that it was flatly 
illegal in New York but perfectly permissible in California, he made some lame 
excuse about having been fined over some issue and left, making it clear that I 
could not take the bottle with me. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is that Senate Bill 1262, the so-called Wine Doggy Bag Bill, was 
passed, signed into law on April 23, 1980, and went into effect Jan. 1, 1981, 
permitting patrons to take a "partially consumed bottle (of wine) from the 
premises upon departure" from "a bona fide eating place." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently the folks at Bice are not acquainted with this law. Nor are they 
acquainted with the fact that Californians do not like being sloppily served by 
waiters with condescending attitudes.

A TALE OF NOISE AND ANNOYANCE; 
</P>
<P>
ONE OF MILAN'S OLDEST RESTAURANTS STOOPS TO CONQUER L.A. 
</P>

Bice, 301 N. Canon, Beverly Hills. (213) 272-2423. Open for lunch and dinner 
daily. Full bar. Parking in building. All major credit cards accepted. Dinner 
for 2, food only, $50-$90. 
</P>
<P>
Bice is the kind of restaurant where two people can have an awful argument at 
the other end of your own table and you won't even find out about it until the 
next morning. 
</P>
<P>
It happened to me. But then, I was pretty busy fending off a waiter who missed 
his calling as a used car salesman. While my friends were deciding never to 
speak to each other again, my waiter was trying to talk me into buying wines I 
couldn't afford. And that was just his opening act. 
</P>
<P>
He began by happily informing me that he didn't think the $25 bottle of wine I 
had ordered was in the cellar. It wasn't. I chose another at the same price. He 
didn't think I'd like it very much. Pointing to a different wine he said, "Try 
this. It's a much better bottle." 
</P>
<P>
"At $40," I replied, "it should be." 
</P>
<P>
"OK," he said, "here's a $35 wine that's not so expensive and is really good." 
I shook my head. He tried again. "I really think you'll be much happier . . ." 
</P>
<P>
I said I thought the $25 wine would bring me sufficient happiness. 
</P>
<P>
This didn't bring him happiness, but he did bring us the wine. Having poured it 
he doled out menus, suggesting that we might have a little bite, maybe some 
antipasti, while we decided what to eat. I said I thought that would be nice. 
This decision, I was later to discover, set me back $72. 
</P>
<P>
How did this make me feel? Like an idiot touring Italy 20 years ago, when 
Americans were rich, ugly and convinced that they were being taken for a ride. 
It's the kind of treatment we used to take for granted in French restaurants in 
America, back in the days when we still believed that the waiter's main job was 
to make us feel inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
It's rare for a waiter in an Italian restaurant to make you feel this way. But 
then, these waiters have been imported especially from Italy. Perhaps this is 
how they behave back home in the original Bice? I doubt it; Bice has been a 
popular Milanese meeting place since 1926, and the Italians have never been 
known for masochism. 
</P>
<P>
The service is not the only thing that seems designed for America. So does the 
space; visually Bice is pure Beverly Hills. It is a vast theatrical room where 
people enter and exit on a sort of stage, often pausing to pose on the ramp as 
they make their descent from bar to restaurant. Even those who go up to the 
restrooms can be seen preening on the glass balcony that floats above the 
dining room. Clothes are important here: the more casual, the more up-to-date 
and the more expensive, the better. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's the noise factor. Would an Italian diner put up with this din? 
It's unlikely. This must be one of the loudest restaurants in a town filled 
with loud restaurants. Eating dinner with six friends one night, I found it 
virtually impossible to hear what was being said at the far end of the table. 
(This was a blessing, but I didn't know it at the time.) And while I'll admit I 
once watched a man pull a phone out of his briefcase and attempt to make a call 
while eating dinner, he had the phone pressed tightly against one ear and a 
finger pressed tightly against the other. And I'd bet money he still couldn't 
hear what was being said on the other end. 
</P>
<P>
But you came to eat, right? Well, probably not. There is better Italian food in 
lots of other restaurants in town. 
</P>
<P>
Consider that antipasto the waiter unloaded on me. Each plate contained the 
following: one large, chilled and totally tasteless shrimp with a little bit of 
endive and avocado; a slice of bresaola with very acidulated shavings of raw 
artichoke and very delicious chunks of Parmesan cheese; slightly bitter 
mozzarella served on top of cottony slices of tomato. Over the past few years 
I've come to trust waiters, but this particular plate made me remember the days 
when I was wary of asking for recommendations because I knew that the waiter 
would just tell me to order whatever the kitchen wanted to get rid of. 
</P>
<P>
But the dishes we chose ourselves weren't much better. There was a rather 
ordinary plate of penne alla arrabbiatta. And an equally ordinary plate of 
penne with eggplant. I'll admit a dish of risotto with spinach and mascarpone 
was delicious, but at $19 it has to be the most expensive risotto in town. (You 
probably won't notice the little line on the menu which says that pasta served 
as a main course costs an additional $5. You will, however, notice when the 
bill comes and your $10 pasta has made the leap to $15.) 
</P>
<P>
The entrees themselves are rather reasonable -- most are under $20. But in the 
course of four visits to the restaurant, few of them tasted very good. Pheasant 
with liver sauce was dry. Roast veal arrived in a sauce that tasted as if it 
had come out of a bottle. Swordfish was so smothered in capers you couldn't 
taste the fish. Grilled flattened chicken was dry. In fact, of all the entrees 
I've tried at Bice, the only two which really impressed me were something 
called "Robespierre" -- thin rare slices of steak topped with arrugula -- and a 
simple breaded veal cutlet Milanese. 
</P>
<P>
I did have one other impressive dish at Bice; unfortunately it has gone out of 
season for another year. When the restaurant opened, the menu featured a truly 
spectacular white truffle risotto. It was served in a large shallow dish so 
that the creamy, slightly al dente rice spread out into a thin layer. All 
across the top were slices of truffle shaved so thinly they were almost 
translucent. The result was that the proportion of truffle to rice was 
practically perfect: each spoonful brought a powerful jolt of flavor. 
</P>
<P>
The dish was so good that I'd gladly go back for it. I'd put up with the noise, 
the rude waiters and the high prices. I'd put up with fighting friends. I'd 
even put up with feeling like a callow tourist. 
</P>
<P>
But I can't say I'm sorry that I'll have to wait a year until I do it.

TWO LEADING LADIES OF THE SCREEN LEAVE BEHIND SWEET MEMORIES

<TEXT>
<P>
At a 1947 forum at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel, a brash young friend asked me to 
keep his seat while he was off being brash. 
</P>
<P>
A woman, almost formless under layered sweaters, approached to ask me if the 
seat was taken. 
</P>
<P>
I replied, "Yes, I'm sorry," and I've been sorry ever since. Because when I 
looked at her face, I saw it was Ava Gardner. 
</P>
<P>
If I had allowed myself a quota of mistakes, turning down this glorious beauty 
surely would have used up my quota far into the future.

I was distressed to encounter the rabbit slaughter in "Roger &amp; Me" and the 
goose decapitation in "Story of Women." Since so many people have begun to 
extend the circle of their compassion to include other creatures, why doesn't 
Calendar begin to list those movies that include obvious cruelty to animals?

"Ava Gardner Is Dead." I read the headline, and as those things happen 
sometimes, my mind instantly printed out a freeze-frame moment, from long ago 
and far away: Ava Gardner as the goddess Venus, gazing at Robert Walker with 
eyes that sang and danced. 
</P>
<P>
Beckoned and promised. It's a good thing the film was in black-and-white. Had 
it been in color, I don't know what those sparkling green eyes would have done 
to me. 
</P>
<P>
I earn my living as a television writer now. And I've had the good fortune of 
writing for some of the biggest actresses in the industry. Some better at their 
craft than Gardner. Some as beautiful. But none have ever affected me quite in 
the same way. 
</P>
<P>
I'm sure it had something to do with being 15 in the 1950s. Teen-age sex was 
for the privileged few. Coke was something you drank out of a glass. 
</P>
<P>
And something else -- in the movie, the Robert Walker character was so far out 
of her league that it gave a skinny, cow-licked teen-ager hope. I mean, if she 
could love this bumbling fool, there was certainly a chance for me!

<P>
Really, Wilson, why all the fuss? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it's because Mapplethorpe had an intense courage to photograph his world 
and present it to the public instead of leaving it in some crowded closet to be 
discovered after he was dead. 
</P>
<P>
I don't think it had anything to do with Jim Morrison, Andy Warhol or a 
6-year-old Almodovar film. I think Mapplethorpe was a genius, now a casualty 
who will be missed.

Mapplethorpe's life as a sexual individual and his attraction to our revolving 
identities is enough to create more than just a "small cult following." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Mr. Wilson, he dangled the dramatics of sexual deviation in front of us. 
</P>
<P>
And such leather-bound deviation is rife with varied interpretation. But 
homosexuality and sexual experimentation are no rare experiences, and those of 
us who are flagrantly and proudly gay support any and all expressions of open 
individuality -- or social deviance. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson tries to define human diversity as segregated "special interest groups." 
But the empathy he is seeking in Mapplethorpe's work is evident in 
reproductions of the human face, the human form. 
</P>
<P>
What I am shocked at is the great deal of fear in Wilson's review, much akin to 
the hysteria surrounding this exhibit. The fear that, without constraints, 
freedom can be a dangerous thing. 
</P>
<P>
But I respect the strength of the individual to interpret the questions that 
Mapplethorpe's images arouse in such a way as to solidify a life-embracing 
morality and to lighten the seriousness with which man confronts his own fears, 
sexuality, role playing and death.

RESTAURANT REVIEW: MODERN ALIENATION, ROCK VIDEO STYLE, ENCOUNTERS MEE KROB AT 
THAI HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At last, a Bohemian Thai restaurant, full of the glamour/squalor of youth and 
art. At Thai House the front door is sheathed in steel, as if this were not a 
restaurant but an apartment in a high-crime neighborhood. Inside, the walls are 
either black or pointedly half-painted. A warehouse ceiling looms cavernously 
overhead, and the floor is evidently colored by corrosive liquids spilled on it 
in its previous warehouse days. 
</P>
<P>
Under each of the lamps that hang from the ceiling is a welded metal tray of 
uncertain function, and there's metal, sculpture-like stuff lying around, 
mostly in the proper bleak style. However, in the middle of everything, a boxy 
structure with a pyramidal copper roof houses a handsome Oriental brass vase, 
the only bright color within these walls. 
</P>
<P>
Thai House can be busy, the echoey bar crawling with young people dressed in 
dark clothes who looked as if they might have been there for the sound track. 
The music, by the way, sounds like a radio station, only it probably isn't, 
since you might hear "Lean on Me" (the new version) four times in one hour. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, though, it's nearly empty. Once there was only one other party in 
the whole place, a couple who had come down to thrash out their relationship in 
legalistic detail -- in low voices, fortunately. Empty or full, it was pretty 
much the same. At Thai House, alienation and the whole ambience of modernity 
meet jolly old mee krob. 
</P>
<P>
It is a jolly mee krob at that, a bit plain but not too sweet or sticky, and 
the noodles are still crisp. The rest of the menu is in the same line, the old 
Thai specialties pretty nicely done. The restaurant has your deep-fried fish 
cake mixed with green beans. It has your angel wings, a very decent version, 
with the good, crisp chicken wings and a savory pork, chicken and black 
mushroom filling. 
</P>
<P>
Some things that may not sound too exciting actually work quite well. The 
vegetable soup is very light and fresh tasting, a neutral broth with snow peas, 
Chinese cabbage, mushrooms and green onions. The vegetables are thrown into the 
broth just before serving -- they are just losing their color as the soup is 
set on the table. 
</P>
<P>
The panang is also extremely aromatic, redolent of the concentrated coconut 
milk and curry sauce in which the beef is cooked. There are several dishes with 
the broad and rather thick noodles usually seen in lard nah. For instance, kai 
kuwa: fried broad noodles mixed with chicken, squid and peanuts instead of the 
lard nah business of meats and brown gravy. 
</P>
<P>
The list of specialties has a slight Cantonese coloring, but it also includes a 
duck marinated in honey, black pepper, garlic and curry powder. This doesn't 
taste quite as exotic as the ingredients might sound, but the dipping sauce is 
exotic, honey-like and loud with ginger flavor. 
</P>
<P>
The menu stars the spicy dishes, of course, but they are rarely very hot by 
L.A. standards. One needlessly starred dish is naked shrimp, which tastes 
rather naked indeed -- the mint and lemon grass leave as little impression on 
them as the red pepper. Another is the yellow curry, where chicken and potatoes 
come in a curry sauce of a rather Indian cast, heavy on the turmeric, cardamom 
and cumin. 
</P>
<P>
OK, the seafood combination is sort of hot. It's a large plateful of scallops, 
shrimp, squid and fish mixed with mint and lemon grass in a thin, astringent 
sauce where you can definitely taste some hot pepper. Basically, though, Thai 
House is the classic Thai restaurant with pad thai and all its playmates. 
</P>
<P>
And rather restrained versions of those -- the garlic and pepper chicken, like 
many another, is a little on the sweet side and only faintly garlicky. The 
barbecued ribs are marinated in a homemade sauce, says the menu, but the effect 
is essentially that of many a Cantonese barbecued rib, only a little more 
chewy. There's a dipping sauce for this one that definitely is hot, the sort 
that is nothing but a light orange puree of red peppers. 
</P>
<P>
There's only one dessert: coconut-banana ice cream topped with cashews. It's 
pretty good, actually, though I don't remember being warned about those 
bananas. In the dim light I worried a little about what the yellow lumps might 
be until I recognized the flavor. 
</P>
<P>
So there you are. Set up a fog machine in Thai House and it would look like the 
set for a rock video. It's the Thai restaurant for those times when you feel 
the need to eat spicy and sour shrimp soup in an atmosphere of adventure and 
despair. 
</P>
<P>
Recommended dishes: vegetable soup, $2.75; kai kuwa, $6.95; panang, $6.50; 
banana-coconut ice cream, $2.50.

"SHE WAS THE last of the great movie stars," says Al Morley, owner of Matinee 
Idol, an intriguing shop in West Hollywood that specializes in film and theater 
collectibles. Morley is referring to the late Bette Davis, and he recently 
devoted an entire window display to her: movie posters, autographed letters, 
signed photographs and sheet music (also signed) from some of her many movies 
such as "Now, Voyager" and "Dark Victory." 
</P>
<P>
Davis often boasted that nothing went out of the studio that she did not 
personally sign. 
</P>
<P>
When Davis died last fall, people were in the shop the next day looking for 
autographs and other memorabilia. "It's something that didn't happen when some 
other great stars died," Morley says, "stars like Cary Grant and Fred Astaire 
and Lucille Ball." He attributes this to Davis' stature as the ultimate movie 
star. Even for those who aren't Davis fans, a trip to Matinee Idol will prove 
worthwhile for playbills, posters, souvenir programs (including "Birth of a 
Nation" and "Wings"), signed photographs of Errol Flynn (looking quite pleased 
with himself) and a $3,000 press kit (called a "campaign book") for "Gone With 
the Wind." The rarest and most expensive pieces deal with Marilyn Monroe, 
Humphrey Bogart, James Dean, Laurel and Hardy and Charlie Chaplin -- or 
anything to do with Rick's cafe in "Casablanca." Matinee Idol, 8650 Melrose 
Ave., West Hollywood, (213) 659-5569. SAM BURCHELL

APARTHEID: PRESIDENT DE KLERK MAKES A HISTORIC CONCESSION IN THE BLACK 
MAJORITY'S STRUGGLE FOR FREEDOM. THE MOVE IS HAILED AS GREATLY COURAGEOUS.

<TEXT>
<P>
President Frederik W. de Klerk legalized the African National Congress on 
Friday and promised to free Nelson Mandela, a historic concession to the epic 
struggle for freedom by the nation's black majority. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of blacks filled the streets of several cities to celebrate the 
announcements by De Klerk in a speech that was widely hailed as courageous. 
</P>
<P>
But black activists and several countries said that despite the move to 
legalize the ANC and dozens of other anti-apartheid groups, the white-run 
government must now follow through. De Klerk did not act dismantle the 
foundation of the apartheid system that would give South Africa's 28 million 
blacks a direct voice in running the country. 
</P>
<P>
Activists, white businessmen, liberal politicians and foreign governments 
praised the courage of De Klerk, who scrapped many other restrictions on 
opposition activity in a bid to draw the ANC into negotiations on South 
Africa's future. 
</P>
<P>
"It's incredible. What he said has certainly taken my breath away," said 
Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize for his 
opposition to apartheid. "We could say that we are probably seeing history in 
the making in South Africa." 
</P>
<P>
President Bush called the move "quite positive" and said he will review U.S. 
sanctions on South Africa. An aide said De Klerk and Mandela will be invited to 
the White House when the black leader is released. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain described De Klerk's announcement 
as "a historic landmark," and lifted cultural and academic embargoes. 
</P>
<P>
The exiled ANC said De Klerk's announcements "go a long way to creating the 
climate conducive to negotiations." But the Zambia-based organization, which 
has been fighting a guerrilla war almost 30 years, said more changes were 
needed before talks could begin. 
</P>
<P>
If the two sides begin negotiations, quick breakthroughs appear unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
The ANC and all leading anti-apartheid groups demand a one-person, one-vote 
democracy, which De Klerk opposes, saying it will result in the 28 million 
blacks dominating the 5 million whites. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk, since taking office in August, has said he envisions some type of 
system in which no single racial group would dominate. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela, 71, the country's best-known black leader, would be freed shortly, De 
Klerk said. But he said "personal circumstances and safety" were among the 
factors delaying the release. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to put it plainly that the government has decided to release Nelson 
Mandela unconditionally," he said. "Unfortunately, a further short passage of 
time is unavoidable." 
</P>
<P>
Tutu agreed with De Klerk's assessment, saying, "There may be people, a lunatic 
fringe, who would want to subvert the process by liquidating him. I think that 
we have to accept that there are certain constraints." 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk said he would lift bans on more than 30 outlawed groups and scrap 
restrictions on a similar number. He pledged to free most prisoners jailed for 
belonging to these groups, declared a moratorium on executions, and lifted most 
of the restrictions imposed during a 43-month-old state of emergency. 
</P>
<P>
These were the principal steps demanded by Mandela and the ANC as conditions 
for negotiations on a new constitution that would end the black majority's 
exclusion from national politics. 
</P>
<P>
"The season of violence is over. The time for reconstruction and reconciliation 
has arrived," De Klerk said in his speech, greeted with cheers from supporters 
and silence from the right-wing opposition. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk said his Cabinet unanimously agreed on the decision and the action on 
legalizing the groups requires no action from Parliament or any other branch of 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Andries Treurnicht, leader of the pro-apartheid Conservative Party, challenged 
de Klerk to call an immediate election for white voters to see whether they 
backed his decisions. 
</P>
<P>
"We say he has no mandate for doing the drastic things he intends doing," 
Treurnicht said. 
</P>
<P>
At the perimeter of the parliamentary buildings, about 5,000 demonstrators, 
many chanting "ANC! ANC!" joined a march demanding Mandela's release. 
</P>
<P>
In Cape Town, Johannesburg and Durban, the three largest cities, thousands of 
blacks sang and danced in the streets to celebrate the ANC's legalization. 
</P>
<P>
Police said marchers threw stones at them in Johannesburg and ordered the crowd 
to disperse. They then fired tear gas. No arrests or serious injuries were 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
The groups to be legalized, in addition to the ANC, include the smaller 
Pan-Africanist Congress guerrilla movement, the South African Communist Party 
and the United Democratic Front, a nationwide multiracial anti-apartheid 
coalition. 
</P>
<P>
The United Democratic Front, which is aligned with the ANC, welcomed De Klerk's 
changes but called for sanctions to remain in place. 
</P>
<P>
"To lift sanctions now would be to run the risk of aborting the process to 
democracy," it said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk said he was lifting restrictions imposed on 374 activists after their 
release from detention. 
</P>
<P>
He said state-of-emergency detentions would be limited to a maximum of six 
months and emergency restrictions on the media would be scrapped except for 
some unspecified controls over photographic and television coverage of unrest. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela, 71, has been jailed since 1962 and is serving a life sentence for 
helping plan the start of the ANC's sabotage and bombing campaign. He has met 
with De Klerk, other government officials and anti-apartheid leaders over the 
last several months in talks aimed at clearing the way for negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
The ANC was outlawed in 1960 after 48 years of nonviolent campaigning for black 
rights. In 1961, it launched its sabotage campaign. 
</P>
<P>
In the last year, the guerrilla campaign has subsided markedly. The ANC's 
exiled leadership has acknowledged that its military options were limited and 
that it favored negotiations if De Klerk was willing to allow unrestricted 
black political activity. 
</P>
<P>
"The allegation has been that the government did not wish to talk to them (the 
ANC and the Pan-Africanist Congress) and that they are deprived of their right 
to normal political activity," De Klerk said. 
</P>
<P>
"The unconditional lifting of the prohibition . . . places everybody in a 
position to pursue politics freely," he added. "The justification for violence, 
which was always advanced, no longer exists." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DE KLERK'S PROPOSED REFORMS 
</P>
<P>
Here are highlights of the concessions to the black majority made by President 
F. W. de Klerk on Friday in a speech to Parliament: 
</P>
<P>
* Legalization of the African National Congress, outlawed since 1960, and more 
than 60 other banned and restricted organizations including the Pan-Africanist 
Congress, the South African Communist Party, the United Democratic Front and 
the Azanian People's Organization. 
</P>
<P>
* Release in the near future of Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners -- 
except those who have committed ordinary crimes. 
</P>
<P>
* Moratorium on hangings, until the government rewrites the death-sentence law 
to apply only to extreme cases. Death Row prisoners henceforth will have an 
automatic right to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
* Repeal of the Separate Amenities Act promised during the current session of 
Parliament, ending the right of local authorities to segregate public 
facilities by race. 
</P>
<P>
* Lifting of emergency regulations regarding education and the press, except 
the restrictions on photography and filming of political unrest. 
</P>
<P>
* Ending emergency restrictions on freedom of speech, movement, assembly and 
work that were imposed on 374 freed detainees, and the emergency regulations 
which allowed such restrictions to be repealed. 
</P>
<P>
* Retaining detention without trial, but limiting it to six months. Detainees 
will have the right to legal representation and a doctor of their own choice.

CALIFORNIA SEN. MONTOYA FOUND GUILTY ON 7 OF 10 FELONY COUNTS

<P>
State Sen. Joseph Montoya, snared in an elaborate FBI sting operation against 
political corruption, was found guilty Friday of seven of 10 counts of 
racketeering, extortion and money laundering in the first felony conviction of 
a state legislator in 35 years. 
</P>
<P>
The seven-woman, five-man jury heard eight weeks of testimony and deliberated 
four days before finding the 50-year-old Democrat from Whittier guilty of 
accepting money from a bogus company to help ram a bill through the 
Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya will be sentenced April 26. The maximum penalties are 20 years in 
prison for each count. He also faces $2 million in fines and could forfeit 
$8,000 prosecutors said he accepted illegally. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Michael Sands said he would appeal the verdict "on every 
ground we can find. We think there are quite a few." 
</P>
<P>
Juror Greg Coumas, a car dealership employee, said the trial left him with 
misgivings about the state of California politics. 
</P>
<P>
"It bothers me," he said. "There were other legislators that came up (during 
the trial). It seems likely it doesn't end here." 
</P>
<P>
Montoya was convicted on five counts of extortion, one count of racketeering 
and one count of money laundering. The jury found Montoya innocent on three 
counts of extortion. 
</P>
<P>
A stoic Montoya sat between his lawyers at the front of the heavily guarded 
courtroom packed with relatives and reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he would resign from the Legislature, defense lawyer Sands said: "I 
cannot comment on that at this time. We will have our discussions." 
</P>
<P>
"This case struck a chord with a lot of Californians," said U.S. Atty. David 
Levi, who headed the prosecution team. "People care about a case like this." 
Other than to say the investigation of Capitol corruption is still under way, 
Levi refused to discuss the likelihood of indictments against other lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
But he added, "We felt it was very important to win the first case." 
</P>
<P>
Montoya's conviction leaves his colleagues facing the sticky legal and 
political problem of whether to expel him from the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Senate leader David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) said he has called an emergency 
meeting of the Senate Rules Committee for Monday to determine Montoya's fate in 
the Legislature. He could be expelled from the Senate on a two-thirds vote. 
</P>
<P>
No lawmaker has been expelled by his colleagues since 1905, when four senators 
were removed from office on the same day after they were implicated in a 
bribery scheme. 
</P>
<P>
Since his indictment on May 17, 1989, Montoya has remained in the Senate as 
chairman of its Business and Professions Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The last time a sitting legislator was convicted of a felony was in 1954, when 
Assemblyman Charles Lyon, a Beverly Hills Republican, was found guilty of 
bribery in a scandal involving the sale of liquor licenses. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya's former top aide, Amiel Jaramillo, was indicted along with his boss. 
He is due to go on trial on March 5. 
</P>
<P>
During the elaborate sting investigation, the FBI formed two companies seeking 
special legislation that would have allowed it to obtain cheap state-backed 
financing for a proposed shrimp processing plant in West Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Undercover agents, posing as company executives, won easy passage of bills in 
1986 and 1988. Both were vetoed by Gov. George Deukmejian, who had been tipped 
off by the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
In September, 1987, a Democratic legislative aide, John Shahabian, was caught 
extorting a $20,000 campaign contribution from agents in behalf of his boss, 
Sen. Paul Carpenter, who is now a Board of Equalization member. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for immunity from prosecution, Shahabian agreed to help agents by 
wearing a hidden tape recorder while he helped shepherd the 1988 bill through 
the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
The jury heard a taped conversation of Shahabian asking Montoya to support the 
bill and the senator's agreement to accept a $3,000 honorarium from the FBI's 
sham company. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors also saw a secretly videotaped breakfast meeting in which Montoya 
stuffed an envelope containing a $3,000 check in his coat pocket. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya contended during four days on the witness stand that California law 
permitted him to accept an honorarium for attending the breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation came to light Aug. 24, 1988, as FBI agents searched the 
offices of Montoya and three other legislators. 
</P>
<P>
The other three, Assembly members Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles), Pat Nolan 
(R-Glendale), and Frank Hill (R-Whittier) remain targets of the investigation, 
along with Carpenter. No other lawmakers have been charged. 
</P>
<P>
After the search, a federal grand jury continued investigating Montoya. Besides 
the sting, he was accused in seven other instances of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors portrayed Montoya as a man driven to become a millionaire any way 
he could. 
</P>
<P>
The jury acquitted Montoya on three extortion counts dealing with charges that 
he attemped to extort money from actor Ed Asner and the Screen Actors Guild, a 
recycling company in his district known as the Allan Co., and the California 
Independent Producers Assn., a trade group of natural gas producers. 
</P>
<P>
But the jury convicted Montoya on counts of trying to extort money from 
prominent sports agent Mike Trope and the National Football League Players' 
Assn., who were opposing each other on legislation in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya was also convicted of extortion for demanding money from 
lawyer-lobbyist Gene Livingston, who wanted Montoya to carry a bill protecting 
the graduates of foreign medical schools. 
</P>
<P>
An official of the California Oil and Gas Assn. said Montoya, after voting in 
favor of a bill the association wanted passed, asked a lobbyist to make sure 
that a campaign contribution had been made. But the jury acquitted Montoya of 
extortion in that incident.

WHISTLE BLOWS FOR HISTORY ON ANCIENT TRAIN 
</P>

<P>
DAMASCUS, Syria 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Railway carriages that escaped Lawrence of Arabia's desert raids in World War I 
are again clattering along the old Hejaz railway, built by the Ottomans' last 
caliph to carry pilgrims to Mecca. 
</P>
<P>
The peeling wood and rattling windows of the 80-year-old carriages testify to 
the history of the line and to the regional turmoil that has kept modernization 
at bay. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Syria resumed a weekly service on the 138-mile stretch between Amman 
and Damascus in October after an eight-year interruption. 
</P>
<P>
The engines are modern diesels. But the Belgian-built carriages and most of the 
track are the ones that were used when the line was built. 
</P>
<P>
They are some of the oldest still in use for a regular passenger service, 
rather than as a tourist attraction. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no other one like it," said Friedrich Pichler, a widely traveled 
Austrian railroad consultant who made the eight-hour trip to Damascus just to 
ride the train. "When you travel on this railroad, it's like people felt in the 
'20s." 
</P>
<P>
The fare, too, can prompt nostalgia: about $3.50 for first class and $2.10 for 
second class. 
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Sultan Abdel-Hamid conceived the line to ferry Muslim pilgrims on 
the annual hajj, or pilgrimage to Mecca, birthplace of the Prophet Mohammed, as 
well as to cement his rule over the Ottoman Empire's restive Arab provinces. 
</P>
<P>
Construction on the German-engineered line started in 1900 in Damascus. It 
ended in Medina, in what is now Saudi Arabia, eight years and 810 miles later. 
</P>
<P>
The Turks matched a unique 105-centimeter, narrow gauge used accidentally on an 
earlier French line from Beirut to Damascus. 
</P>
<P>
"It should have been 1,065 millimeters, but someone cut the track supports to 
the wrong width and for reasons of saving money it was decided to build the 
line to fit them instead of sending for new ones," says Geoffrey Freeman Allen, 
editor of Jane's World Railways in London. 
</P>
<P>
Turmoil in Turkey and the outbreak of World War I ended plans to extend the 
line to Mecca. 
</P>
<P>
And marauding Arab rebels accompanied by the British officer T. E. Lawrence, 
the legendary "Lawrence of Arabia," repeatedly raided the line during the war 
to block Turkish supplies. 
</P>
<P>
British Maj. Sir Hubert Young, who accompanied Lawrence, later wrote: "Nothing 
seemed to give him greater pleasure than to squat down less than 200 yards from 
the railway line . . . and watch with complete unconcern the slow approach of a 
train full of Turkish soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as the engine was over the undiscovered mine, he would jam down the 
knob of the exploder, retire to his waiting camel and ride away, hotly pursued 
by the fire of any soldiers who might have escaped from the rear carriages." 
</P>
<P>
Damaged bridges and wrecked trains derailed by Lawrence, remarkably preserved 
in the dry desert air, can still be found along the old line, mainly in 
southern Jordan and Saudi Arabia, where passenger service on the Hejaz stopped 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The track that once carried pious pilgrims now ferries phosphate on rebuilt 
lines through southern Jordan to the port of Aqaba. 
</P>
<P>
The original track north of Amman forces engineers to hold speeds to 31 m.p.h. 
on straight stretches and 21 1/2 m.p.h. on curves as the train traces the edge 
of the vast Arabian desert. 
</P>
<P>
It rattles through empty vistas of arid land, past encampments of goat-hair 
Bedouin tents fragrant with brushwood smoke from fires for brewing tea, past 
ruined Ottoman watering stations built of stone. 
</P>
<P>
In towns, the rare passage of a train briefly halts normal life. Men and women 
wave from balconies. Soccer players interrupt their games. Mobs of shrieking 
children dance and race the horn-blaring train -- and sometimes even throw 
stones at it. 
</P>
<P>
The trip is still a novelty as well to the unusually friendly customs and 
immigration officials. 
</P>
<P>
At the Syrian entry station of Deraa, no bankers awaited foreigners for the 
mandatory exchange of currency. So cheerful police packed the only two 
Westerners into the back of a jeep and raced them 3 1/2 miles to an exchange 
post. The officers had to push-start their vehicle on the return leg. 
</P>
<P>
The future of the eccentric service is in doubt, however: History is at war 
with economics. 
</P>
<P>
Railroad officials say it would be too expensive to renovate the weather-beaten 
wooden cars, whose squeaking wall panels sometimes wiggle independently of 
their neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
The odd, small size of the track also makes it impossible to carry much freight 
or trains from standard-gauge tracks used elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Marwan Hadawi, general director of Syria's branch of the railroad, says 
Damascus is already preparing the roadbed for a new standard-gauge track to the 
Jordanian border. 
</P>
<P>
The Syrians also are considering using more modern Hungarian passenger cars to 
replace the ancient Belgian cars on the run to Amman. The Hungarian cars 
already serve Damascus and Deraa daily. 
</P>
<P>
A 1981 study by German consultants proposed replacing the whole system with a 
modern, standard-gauge line. But the $3-billion to $4-billion price tag means 
that project is at best far in the future.

GRASSINGTON, England 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This village, with its old stone houses gathered round a cobbled square under a 
gentle dusting of snow, is a picture-postcard scene. But the tranquility of 
this apparently timeless place in Yorkshire, in the north of England, hides 
serious human problems caused by rapid social change. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors usually fall in love with the place in summer when Wharfedale's slopes 
are green and lush and the skies are blue. Those with money may buy a weekend 
cottage. Those with not so much may sell their home in Bradford (an industrial 
town) or London when they retire, and move in. 
</P>
<P>
Villages like Grassington -- population 1,000 -- on the western edge of 
Yorkshire and within reach of the scenically beautiful Lake District, are being 
transformed. Nearby Kettlewell has become a ghost village. Most of its houses 
are now second homes, empty for most of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Grassington has expensive shops. Expensive, at least, in local terms. Not so 
expensive for the wealthy "off-cumdens," local parlance for those who have come 
from far off. 
</P>
<P>
Local people, with resignation born of low expectations, tend to play down 
their problems. Most are affected, however, by the shortage of affordable 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
Prices in the estate agent's window are not much less than those in the crowded 
South, with plenty in the 100,000 to 200,000 bracket -- a range of $175,000 to 
$350,000. 
</P>
<P>
The resultant forced migration of young couples breaks up the strong family 
networks which have hitherto sustained rural people in the absence of welfare 
services, often located in distant large towns. 
</P>
<P>
"There are far too many old people and far too few young people living in this 
dale. We're getting a seriously imbalanced area. I think it distorts the whole 
place," said Peter Walbank, chairman of the Chamber of Trade and a local 
shopkeeper. "Often young people can't buy houses. They have to move down to 
Skipton, where houses were until recently considerably cheaper. Part of Skipton 
is called Little Grassington because young people live there who couldn't get 
houses here." 
</P>
<P>
Grassington is trying to interest a housing association in taking over part of 
the old hospital site to build cheap new homes specifically for young people 
who want to stay near their families. "People get married and would like to 
live in the village," Walbank said. "I can think of a dozen folk at the moment. 
But they can't, and they move out." 
</P>
<P>
"It's becoming an old folks' home in Grassington," said Edgar Darwin, sheep 
farmer and chairman of the parish council. "There's no point building houses if 
people haven't got jobs. . . . It's sad that the young people have to move out. 
Two of my sons have moved away." 
</P>
<P>
Farming has seriously declined. "About 40 years ago there would be about 10 
families living on small farms around Grassington," Darwin said. "There are 
three left. The quarries used to employ loads of men, but now it's all 
machinery. We had a firm of builders that used to employ quite a lot, but it's 
just about wound down." 
</P>
<P>
Tourism provides seasonal jobs, but Darwin is opposed to further expansion. "If 
you saturate the place and play all the time to what tourists want, you 
probably destroy what they are coming for. I'm not in favor of building big 
hotels." 
</P>
<P>
If the young people have problems, so do the increasing numbers of the old. "We 
do know there is a lot of loneliness here," Walbank said. 
</P>
<P>
George Rhodes, director of the Samaritans in Bradford, said his office receives 
many calls from lonely people in rural areas like Grassington. "Generally from 
all the information we have had, the rural communities do get forgotten. It's 
not just the elderly. Farmers and farm laborers are very desperate and lonely 
people. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of pride among farmers, and when they have a problem they are 
frightened of losing face," Rhodes said. "They will go into a pub at the 
weekend, and not one of them wants to admit that they have problems with their 
stock or whatever. We have known of people who have got so lonely they have 
taken their own lives. There's quite a high suicide rate in rural areas." 
</P>
<P>
Altogether different problems beset Rita Ward, a young mother originally from 
St. Albans, near London, who moved to Grassington in 1983 when her husband 
landed a job with the national parks. 
</P>
<P>
"Transport is a terrible problem," she said. "Very often I don't have the car. 
Skipton is nine miles away and the buses are infrequent and expensive. The fare 
is more than 2 pounds to return. On Sundays there's virtually no service." 
</P>
<P>
Catrin Maby, development officer with the Yorkshire Rural Community Council, 
bears this out: "Public transport is a massive problem. It raises a question of 
equal opportunities. What transport there is is likely to be the family car, 
but they only have one. Whoever goes to work has the car. The mother or elderly 
people or teen-agers are disadvantaged." 
</P>
<P>
Farther north in tiny Horton-in-Ribblesdale -- a few rows of white-painted 
terraced cottages gathered round a hump-backed bridge at the foot of fields of 
sheep -- Sandra Millman is one of the lucky few. She and her husband bought 
their terraced cottage for 17,000 -- about $30,000 -- four years ago. Today it 
would cost 55,000 -- about $96,000 -- well beyond their range. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband is a wagon driver, transporting limestone from the local quarry. 
They have a 7-month-old son, James and, with family on hand to help out, they 
are happy with their lot. But theirs is the old pattern of life, which social 
change is destroying. 
</P>
<P>
"There are not many people of my age," she said. "There used to be loads of 
young ones." The cottages on each side of hers are now holiday homes. "There 
was a young lad who got married this year. They would have liked the top house, 
but it went for a vast amount." 
</P>
<P>
Sheila Haywood, a retired college lecturer, believes that Horton is in 
jeopardy: "If all the farming subsidies were removed and the farmers could no 
longer farm sheep, and if the quarries were closed -- there is a strong feeling 
that they are tearing the hillside apart -- it would mean a whole batch of 
young people, with no work, having to move." 
</P>
<P>
In the 18th Century, Horton had its own grammar school. Now there is only a 
primary school; after that, children must travel to other towns for education. 
</P>
<P>
"More and more of the life of the young people is taken out of the village and 
farther and farther away," Haywood said.

YOUNG AFGHANS ORPHANED BY LONG CIVIL WAR FACE HARSH LIFE IN PAKISTAN

MOUNDA CAMP, Pakistan 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On many days, 12-year-old Safiullah and his brother, Dilagha, 7, begin 
scavenging after school. 
</P>
<P>
The two Afghans wander the roads and fields near this massive refugee camp in 
the desert, 35 miles north of Peshawar. They look for twigs, scraps of paper -- 
anything to fuel a fire and help their adopted family survive. 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago their father, a moujahedeen resistance fighter, was killed in 
battle. Their mother died in a bombing. The orphans were taken in by their 
uncle, aunt and three cousins and brought to Pakistan, where the family scrapes 
out a living. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to collect wood and leaves to help our uncle," said Safiullah, a thin 
boy dressed in a ragged clothes. "Sometimes the Pakistanis don't allow us to 
leave the camp and gather wood. But on other days, we're lucky and can sneak 
out." 
</P>
<P>
For thousands of Afghan orphans, life is a harsh struggle. Islam-based Afghan 
society considers a child to be an orphan when his father dies. The child and 
the mother are usually taken in by relatives. Sometimes an uncle accepts the 
widow as a second wife. If a child has no family members, friends or others 
from his village will adopt him. 
</P>
<P>
However, the decade-long civil war has overburdened the traditional system with 
orphans and widows, Afghan and Western observers say. More than 1 million have 
been killed in the conflict and, by some private estimates, 1 million children 
have been left fatherless. 
</P>
<P>
Often, a widow has no one to turn to and cannot provide for the family herself 
due to the custom of confining women to the home. The burden then falls to the 
children to obtain what they need. 
</P>
<P>
For children without parents, an adopted family often can give no more than 
basic subsistence. Relief workers say it is increasingly difficult to register 
children as refugees, which would entitle them to assistance. As a result, a 
family's sustenance is stretched thin. 
</P>
<P>
Even without the war, growing up as an Afghan has always been perilous. For 
years, Afghanistan has topped the list of 131 countries ranked by the United 
Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) in incidence of child mortality. 
</P>
<P>
The child mortality threat has eased since 1960. Still, 198 of every 1,000 
Afghan children die before age 1, and 329 die between the ages of 1 and 5, 
according to 1989 figures from an internal UNICEF report. In the United States, 
only 10 children in 1,000 die before the age of 1, and 13 between the ages of 1 
and 5. 
</P>
<P>
Afghan children also lead the world in suffering from a lack of food, drinking 
water, schooling, immunization and a high mortality rate among mothers. 
</P>
<P>
UNICEF said 6.8 million Afghans are under the age of 16, about half the 
population. 
</P>
<P>
The growing number of orphans is creating dilemmas in a society that has no 
institutionalized approach to caring for them. Proud of their traditions, 
Afghans strongly oppose adoption of Afghan orphans overseas, even in other 
Muslim countries. 
</P>
<P>
Often, though, the traditional system has failed to respond to the realities of 
war. 
</P>
<P>
Sashai, a young woman with four children, fled Afghanistan last summer. She had 
been turned out by her husband's relatives who, four years ago, had adopted the 
family when her husband died. 
</P>
<P>
Bibi Hawa, an elderly woman with long braids and a deeply lined face, brought 
her eight grandchildren to Pakistan eight years ago when her son was killed in 
the fighting. One of his two wives also died. When the other wife remarried, 
the grandmother was forced to take the children. 
</P>
<P>
"She has remarried an older man who already has children and says he can't take 
care of her children too," said the woman, who relies on handouts from relief 
agencies. "Only Allah will take care of these children now." 
</P>
<P>
Some Islamic organizations have taken on the task of rebuilding Afghan 
families. In Peshawar, the Saudi-supported Islamic Relief Agency sends teams 
into nearby refugee camps to search for relatives of children and widows. The 
agency runs the area's only orphanage, where 1,000 children and widows live and 
receive an Islamic education. 
</P>
<P>
"There are many children who are completely alone," said Sayed Ishaq Gailani, a 
former moujahedeen commander. "There are many others who stay with relatives 
who are not prepared to give them good support and an education. The children 
remain illiterate." 
</P>
<P>
Gailani heads the Afghan Relief Foundation, which plans to establish a network 
of orphanages in Peshawar. Two or three widows can live there with their 
children and also care for three or four other unwanted youngsters. The 
children would be educated in the homes. If the plan works, he hopes to extend 
it to Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
"They were children when the war started, and they lost their parents. They 
never got a chance for an education and to enjoy life inside Afghanistan," he 
continues. "Now when they go back, there will be no time to get schooling. This 
problem will go on. Someone must take responsibility."

4-LANE HIGHWAY WILL CUT INTO DOVER'S WHITE CLIFFS; CONSERVATION GROUPS ANGRY

<P>
Fifty years after Adolf Hitler's armies threatened to destroy them, England's 
famous White Cliffs of Dover are in danger again -- from a road. 
</P>
<P>
Transport Secretary Cecil Parkinson and Environment Secretary Chris Patten 
decided a four-lane highway should run along the famous cliffs, at one point 
just 200 yards from the edge. 
</P>
<P>
The highway is intended to improve access from Dover to the entrance of the 
Channel Tunnel, linking France and Britain, which is due to open in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
The two ministers turned down plans for an alternate route farther inland 
because it would have cost an extra $17.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
The chalk-white cliffs on Britain's southern coast can be seen for miles from 
the English Channel. The rolling grassy countryside above the cliffs is favored 
by hikers. 
</P>
<P>
Conservation groups were angered. 
</P>
<P>
"There are times when the national vision must come before short-term financial 
considerations," said Dame Jennifer Jenkins, chairwoman of the National Trust, 
which cares for most of Britain's historic sites and monuments. 
</P>
<P>
"We are extremely disappointed. The landscape will be totally destroyed, both 
visually and in terms of its tranquility." 
</P>
<P>
Angus Stirling, director general of the trust, said: "It is extremely 
disappointing that the government was not prepared to save a landscape of such 
great symbolic significance by paying the extra $17.6 million, which would, in 
a few years' time, have seemed a trifling sum." 
</P>
<P>
The money would have gone to build a .75-mile-long tunnel beneath Dover's 
Western Heights and to widen a road. 
</P>
<P>
The White Cliffs dispute follows several controversies over road building in 
Britain. Plans for additional four- and six-lane roads in central London have 
sparked debate about spending on roads.

CHINESE SOOTHSAYERS WARN OF CIVIL WAR

<TEXT>
<P>
China will teeter on the brink of civil war, the United States and Japanese 
currencies will fluctuate wildly and Hong Kong residents should wear white this 
summer -- at least that's what the soothsayers predict for the Year of the 
Horse. 
</P>
<P>
The horse, which took over from the snake on Jan. 27, the lunar New Year's Day, 
will offer a rough ride but will handsomely reward anyone who is able to take 
the calculated risk. 
</P>
<P>
Calculations and risks are very familiar to the British colony's gambling-mad 
Chinese population, but the writings of its sages surged in popularity 
following Beijing's brutal crackdown on China's pro-democracy movement in June. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to avoid talking about politics, but after June 4 people changed the 
way they think and they really want to know what will happen," writes Lam Kwok 
Hung, who credits himself with predicting the brutal military crackdown in 
Beijing's Tian An Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
The horse comes seventh in the Chinese zodiac of 12, each with different 
characteristics and a different animal as its symbol. The Chinese believe the 
horse signifies speed, strength and vitality. 
</P>
<P>
For about $1 one can purchase a red booklet sporting the photograph of 
fortune-teller Lam. It contains specific instructions on how to get through the 
Year of the Horse without annoying the spirits and demons. 
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong residents wondering if they should join a steady stream of people 
trying to leave the colony before it is handed back to China in 1997 can be 
told if and when they should emigrate or whether it is worth staying. 
</P>
<P>
Lam says they should wait, arguing that by 1993 China will be embroiled in a 
civil war between the north and the south. 
</P>
<P>
"So there is no need to emigrate and become third-class citizens abroad, 
because when fighting breaks out, Hong Kong will become more important to China 
and China will then ask Britain to administer Hong Kong for another 30 years," 
Lam says confidently. 
</P>
<P>
And, according to another fortune-teller, the negotiators who have been trying 
to work out the details of Hong Kong's future political system may as well take 
early retirement. 
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong's political prospects are not good because there will be no major 
breakthrough in diplomatic talks," says Lee Kui Ming. He adds, however, that 
Hong Kong will escape a major disaster as long as its citizens take adequate 
precautions. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope people will wear white clothes during the summer to reduce the violent 
atmosphere which will prevail then," he writes. 
</P>
<P>
Many predict that thousands will take to the streets this summer, as they did 
last year, in support of the democracy movement in China. 
</P>
<P>
"In the ninth moon (Oct. 18 to Nov. 16) democratic pioneers will come out again 
and shout loudly their slogans, endangering relations between China and Hong 
Kong," writes Lam Chan. "I warn those democracy activists in Hong Kong to 
control themselves and not to provoke China." 
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Chinese soothsayers also give financial advice. 
</P>
<P>
"This year is not good for speculation, so keep away from buying gold and 
stocks and avoid the foreign exchange market," says one. 
</P>
<P>
Lam advises cautious investment and adds that smaller companies on Hong Kong's 
stock exchange will collapse. "They will not be a good buy, even if they appear 
sound," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Massive foreign currency fluctuations are predicted for May and June as well as 
December and January. 
</P>
<P>
China will approach economic ruin, Britain will perform badly but West Germany 
will go from strength to strength, according to some of the soothsayers. 
</P>
<P>
But in the next year, bold investors can take heart. 
</P>
<P>
"By year's end," one soothsayer concludes, "the faint-hearted will be out of 
the race while those with the stamina will be rewarded with runaway success."

ENGLISH BUTLER TRAINS HONG KONG CHINESE IN JOB THAT CAN BE A TICKET OUT

<P>
Ivor Spencer is that quintessentially English phenomenon, a butler. 
</P>
<P>
But Spencer -- soft-spoken and ingenious -- is no ordinary butler. He is a king 
among butlers and has his own school in London to teach the long-time art. 
</P>
<P>
That isn't all. Like the fictional ideal gentleman's gentleman -- P. G. 
Wodehouse's debonair manservant Jeeves -- Spencer is something of a schemer. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent trip to Hong Kong, he explained a project that would have made 
Bertie Wooster, Jeeves's bumbling upper-class boss, drop his monocle. 
</P>
<P>
This teeming British colony, capitalist home to more than 5 million people, is 
due to be turned over to communist China in less than eight years. As a result, 
thousands are desperate to escape, especially since Chinese troops crushed 
student-led demonstrations in Beijing's Tian An Men Square last June. 
</P>
<P>
Spencer, 57, is helping a selected few get out. 
</P>
<P>
"We like to please," he said with a slight inclination of the head. 
</P>
<P>
He instructs would-be butlers on how to carry bottles of champagne on silver 
trays and iron newspapers so that readers avoid getting inky fingers. Then he 
helps them get jobs as butlers abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Butlering -- especially old-style English butlering -- is in demand and is such 
an unusual skill that usually there is not much trouble getting a working visa 
to go abroad. 
</P>
<P>
"After Tian An Men Square, we had so many calls and letters from Hong Kong 
about the course," Spencer said in an interview in a plush Hong Kong hotel. 
"But I didn't realize until I got here their actual feelings. They are very 
scared and very worried, and I would certainly like to help them." 
</P>
<P>
Out of the original inquiries, Spencer -- who is as accomplished at dealing 
with the media as he is at mixing a dry martini -- chose 20 applicants for 
interviews. Among these were a doctor, a banker, a pilot and a stockbroker. 
</P>
<P>
Being the soul of discretion, Spencer would not identify the applicants, but 
said the doctor was a general practitioner who feared that it would be 
difficult to get a passport and wanted a backup occupation. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Canadian Consulate here -- Canada is a favorite destination 
for Hong Kong Chinese -- said that for immigration purposes a butler would be 
classified as a domestic servant and there is considerable demand for servants 
in Canada. After working two years in Canada, a butler would be eligible to 
apply for landed immigrant status, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Spencer stressed that he does not guarantee that trainees will find a job or 
get a work visa, but he said the chances are good. 
</P>
<P>
The classification "domestic servant" is anathema to him. 
</P>
<P>
"The modern butler is more a manager," he said. "It is all about running 
someone's household in great style." 
</P>
<P>
Would-be butlers, who pay $4,800 for his seven-week course, learn everything 
from keeping the household finances to how to book a round-the-world cruise. 
</P>
<P>
Spencer's graduates are working at several royal homes in England. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, butlers can expect to earn between $35,000 and $55,000 a 
year, with medical care, a car, food and lodging often included. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a fascinating job, but very demanding -- no room for clock-watchers, 
especially in America," he said. "You become a confidante and friend." 
</P>
<P>
Before World War II, there were more than 30,000 butlers in England but now 
there are only 70, Spencer estimated. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps because of their rarity, most people have no idea of how to deal with a 
butler, which is why Spencer also runs brief courses for employers. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a couple of rich Americans from Dallas who were going to take one 
of my butlers," Spencer said. "They were arguing and the woman was saying she 
was sure you tipped the butler after every meal. 'No, no,' said the man, 'you 
only tip him after dinner at night.' " 
</P>
<P>
Spencer had to explain to them that you never tip a butler. 
</P>
<P>
For Americans in particular, he said, an English butler is a status symbol. 
</P>
<P>
Although Spencer trains modern "butler-administrators," the essential service 
is traditional. "In the morning you lay out your employer's clothes and run the 
bath," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Would he, like Jeeves, object to a loud Bertie Wooster-style waistcoat? 
</P>
<P>
"We do, by suggestion, often get our way," he replied. 
</P>
<P>
"You may find that a rich Oklahoma oil millionaire is used to coming down to 
dinner in his jeans and hat," he said, "but we generally find that after a few 
weeks he is wearing black tie to dinner at least once a week." 
</P>
<P>
Spencer has come a long way from his roots in working-class East London. In 
addition to teaching and organizing private parties, he is a toastmaster in 
great demand for glittering London galas. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way he has acquired a taste for the good life and now wears 
impeccably tailored suits and hand-made shoes and shirts. He has even thought 
about employing his own butler at his home in Dulwich, London. 
</P>
<P>
It would serve the dual purpose of giving a trainee some experience and taking 
a load off his wife, Estella. 
</P>
<P>
She isn't ready for that, however. 
</P>
<P>
"Too grand for us," she said. "What would the neighbors say?"

You spell it easy, he spells it eezi. You want quick results, he wants kwik 
rezults. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to call the whole thing off, language buff and activist Ted W. Culp 
probably would tell you to wait becuz victori is inevitabel in this linggwistic 
endevor. 
</P>
<P>
Culp is the president and founder of the Internasional Union for the Canadian 
Langwaje, which campaigns for reforming English into Canadian -- he says 
Canadean -- as an international language. 
</P>
<P>
"Half the battle is already won because people know that reformation needs to 
be done," he said. "There's a universal recognition that there's a problem with 
the English language." 
</P>
<P>
Culp declined to say exactly how many people belong to his admittedly small 
organization, but he insists that he has members and contacts scattered around 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
And, if you're wondering why a reformed English should be called "Canadean" -- 
well, why not? 
</P>
<P>
"All the other languages of the world are linked to a nation," Culp said. "When 
they're linked to a nation, it removes any sense of fear. The world needs an 
international language, but it needs one that's rational." 
</P>
<P>
Talking over coffee at a neighborhood fast-food restaurant, Culp detailed why 
he thinks the soft "c" in English should be changed to "s" as in "sentense," 
why Czechoslovakia should have been changed long ago to Checkoslovakia, why 
"Fast as Flite" on trucking slogans reads just fine to him and why the large 
American toy-store chain should change its name to "Tois Ar We." 
</P>
<P>
He puts out regular nuzeletters and has started a small nuzepaper, The Times Ov 
Toronto, that has made it through three four-page issues. 
</P>
<P>
"We urj all owr reeders tu abandon the obsolete, anoying english langwaje, and 
tu adopt the emerjing, rasional canadean langwaje," an editorial calling for 
linggwistic chanj said. "It iz so eezi. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Culp, a gray-haired secondary-school teacher, said he always was interested in 
language and created his Canadian in 1987, the centenary of the artifical 
language Esperanto that had been touted as the way to an international 
communication. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no sense creating a language that no one speaks," he said of Esperanto 
and its late founder, the Polish philologist Ludwig Zamenhof. "That's the fatal 
weakness from which it will never recover. . . . It was just the wrong 
strategy." 
</P>
<P>
"Canadean," on the other hand, would take advantage of the prominence of 
English as an international language but make it easier for foreigners learning 
English who often are confused by its spelling and grammar. 
</P>
<P>
"Using the world's No. 1 language, you can read and understand this," he said. 
"In 'Canadean' you must say what's there." 
</P>
<P>
Culp said the rules for Canadian appeal to those who have problems spelling as 
well as those with scientifically educated minds who prefer their systems to be 
rational. The increasing use of computers and computer languages can only help 
the move to develop a more rational language, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the rules for "Canadean" are an alphabet with 25 letters, eliminating "q" 
from the current Latin-English alphabet; the addition of a verb "tu must," as 
in "yu must tu work," and the elimination of all silent and extra letters. 
</P>
<P>
Culp conceded that his language work would have to be developed over the long 
term. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a tendency to linguistic conservatism," he said of those reluctant to 
change. "People say it's the richness of the language, but it's very rich 
nonsense."

FROG DIE-OFF CREATES A TROUBLING ENVIRONMENTAL MYSTERY 
</P>

Toads and frogs are dropping like flies. 
</P>
<P>
Zoologists say a mysterious, precipitous decline in the world's amphibian 
population raises troubling questions about the future of humans and the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
"What we've got here is a global early warning system and that system is the 
frog," says zoologist Michael Tyler of Australia's University of Adelaide. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the evidence of a massive die-off of the world's amphibian population 
is largely anecdotal, but zoologists say it should not be ignored. 
</P>
<P>
"Amphibians have a perpetually moist skin, and they live both on land and in 
water, so they are constantly sampling their environment in ways that we 
don't," says David Wake, an evolutionary biologist at UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
"They are going to sense things before we do, and if they're going to go, 
there's a message there for us," says Wake, former president of the American 
Society of Naturalists. 
</P>
<P>
If, after further study, it is determined that the threat to amphibians is only 
a local problem, or part of some natural cycle, then there is nothing to worry 
about, Wake says. 
</P>
<P>
However, if it is determined that the problem is worldwide, then something must 
be done, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Without question something is going on in some places. What we don't know is 
if it's general. If it is a global phenomenon, this really is an important 
discovery," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At Wake's suggestion, the National Academy of Sciences in Washington has 
decided to sponsor a conference on the phenomenon next month in Irvine, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
The goal of the session, which Wake will chair, is to determine if there is a 
problem and, if so, what to do about it, said National Academy staff member 
Donna Gerardi. 
</P>
<P>
A decade ago, when Wake walked through the meadows of California's High Sierra, 
"It used to be frog heaven," he said. "They were so thick on the ground you 
would step on them. 
</P>
<P>
"Now they are almost absent from the area," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He found a similar decimation of salamander and toad populations on a recent 
visit to Costa Rica's Monte Verde rain forest, raising suspicions that the 
problem is widespread. 
</P>
<P>
It was then that he started a "frog log" in his computer. 
</P>
<P>
When his concerns began to circulate in zoological circles, the phone calls and 
letters started pouring in. 
</P>
<P>
Areas so far reporting dwindling or disappearing amphibian populations include 
Denmark, Hungary, southern Ontario and Southern California as well as 
Australia, Wake said. 
</P>
<P>
Along Australia's east coast alone, about 20 different amphibian species have 
been affected "and some have disappeared entirely," Tyler said in a telephone 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
In Australia, New Zealand and New Guinea, "a large number of species have 
either disappeared totally or have disappeared from a large part of their 
range," Tyler added. 
</P>
<P>
While areas such as Yellowstone National Park in northwest Wyoming, central 
Panama and Sarawak in northern Borneo, report no apparent changes, even 
zoologists from these regions are unanimous in their support for a worldwide 
conference on the topic, Wake said. 
</P>
<P>
"An investigation now is better than a funeral later," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Zoologists say there is no ready explanation for the apparent amphibian 
die-off. 
</P>
<P>
They speculate that the causes could include pesticide residues, acid rain, a 
gradual disappearance of the ponds amphibians require to breed, and growing 
salinity in wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
Other possible explanations include the contamination of wetlands with heavy 
metal toxins, higher doses of ultraviolet radiation from the sun (caused by a 
thinning of the atmospheric ozone layer), and even a lethal frog virus. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a phenomenon that can't really be explained yet," said Gerardi of the 
National Academy of Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
"If the population is weakened in some way, then any of a number of things 
could knock them over the edge," Wake said.

N. HOLLYWOOD RETIREMENT HOME EVACUATED BY FIRE; 
</P>
<P>
ARSON: RESIDENTS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD BELIEVE THE BLAZE IS THE LATEST IN A 
SERIES OF ARSONS IN THE AREA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
About 65 residents of a North Hollywood retirement home were evacuated early 
Saturday after an apparent arson fire broke out in a storage area. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said the fire is the latest in a series of blazes set intentionally 
in the area. 
</P>
<P>
There were no injuries in the fire, which was started about 4:25 a.m. in an 
unlocked storage area of the Royal Bellingham home at 12229 Chandler Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
The fire activated automatic sprinklers, and firefighters were able to put the 
blaze out within minutes, said Greg Acevedo of the Los Angeles Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
Blowers set up by the Fire Department cleared the building of smoke in about 45 
minutes. Many of the home's 66 residents went back to bed. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the fire worried residents of the neighborhood around Bellingham 
Avenue and Chandler Boulevard, which has been plagued by arson fires in recent 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a scary thing because there have been so many fires around here," said 
Theresa Carnese, assistant administrator of the retirement home. 
</P>
<P>
An arson investigator said, "We are aware of the fires and they are under 
investigation." He would not elaborate, nor would he say whether the fires were 
related to a recent rash of similar blazes in the Reseda-Northridge area. Many 
of those fires broke out in rubbish bins and storage areas, as did many of the 
North Hollywood blazes. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of the area have formed a Neighborhood Watch group, led by Stephanie 
Tapper, a free-lance artist and writer. Tapper said she was compelled to act 
after an arsonist set two fires in the garage of her apartment building on the 
same night. 
</P>
<P>
"It became fairly clear to me that we had something going on here that was not 
the norm," she said.

POINT / COUNTERPOINT : DEBATING DRUG BARRICADES: REMOVING RIGHTS OR PROVIDING 
PROTECTION? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Fed up with a steady stream of drive-by drug buyers in residential 
neighborhoods, police have barricaded a 20-square-block area in Sepulveda to 
deter narcotics traffic. 
</P>
<P>
No organized opposition has surfaced to the concept, which reportedly is the 
first such effort on a large scale in the nation. Since November, when police 
first set up wooden sawhorses around a Pico-Union neighborhood, at least three 
more neighborhoods have been barricaded in other parts of the city: Sepulveda, 
South-Central Los Angeles and Koreatown. 
</P>
<P>
FOR 
</P>
<P>
JOEL WACHS 
</P>
<P>
Joel Wachs, 50, has been a member of the Los Angeles City Council for the past 
19 years. He represents the Sepulveda neighborhood where barriers have been 
installed and says they have curtailed drive-by drug traffic and should be 
erected anywhere police and residents think they are necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What evidence is there that the barricades work? 
</P>
<P>
A. There are four ways to judge it. You can judge it by police crime 
statistics, which show a substantial drop in drug-dealing and related crimes 
since the barricades were erected. 
</P>
<P>
The second indication, which is the most significant, is the impact on the 
residents. Everyone that I have heard from both directly and from media 
accounts feel it has had a tremendous positive impact. They see less crime, 
they feel infinitely safer walking in the area. They feel like the area has 
been given back to them. 
</P>
<P>
Third, as an outside observer, I have driven through those areas, and there are 
not the kind of blatant drug dealings on the street. There are far fewer people 
just sort of congregating and milling about. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth thing is that it has actually lessened the need for intense police 
manpower in the immediate area and freed the officers to police other areas. 
Ironically, it's turned out to be very cost-effective. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Signs posted in one of the two barricaded neighborhoods say: "Secure Area -- 
Residents Only." Isn't this restriction a violation of the civil rights of 
those who merely wish to visit the neighborhood? 
</P>
<P>
A. Legally, they can go in and no one will stop them. The only way you can 
legally restrict them from going in is by withdrawing the streets from public 
use, which we have not done. 
</P>
<P>
It's too soon to tell if it will be necessary to remove the streets from public 
use and restrict entry. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, it's like having a sign on your house that says "Beware of Dog," but 
you don't really have a dog. It sends a message. I'm open to changing the 
wording of the signs, but I have yet to hear of one example of someone who had 
a lawful purpose to go in there that was denied entrance. Obviously, we don't 
get calls from drug buyers complaining about not being able to go in and buy 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Won't the barricades simply drive drug dealers into adjacent areas or into 
some of the San Fernando Valley's other 30 or so drug hot spots? 
</P>
<P>
A. We have yet to see a spillover from the entire 20-square-block area into 
nearby neighborhoods because there's the natural barrier of the San Diego 
Freeway to the west and single-family homes in the other directions. The hope 
is there will be a scatter effect and the dealers will not be able to establish 
themselves in new areas because the police will be on the lookout for them. 
</P>
<P>
I don't know if there has been an increase of drug activity in the other hot 
spots. I would have to find out. I haven't heard of it, but I'm not saying yes 
or no because I don't know. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Should we try this technique in other Valley neighborhoods beset by drive-by 
drug buyers? 
</P>
<P>
A. We may. It doesn't bother me one bit if the result is working with the 
residents to liberate neighborhoods in the way that we have liberated this one. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Critics blast the barricades as analogous to the Berlin Wall. Are they? 
</P>
<P>
A. I get really angry when someone uses that analogy because it's a cheap shot. 
The Berlin Wall was a government putting up a wall to restrict the freedom of 
its citizens. This is a government working with its people to put up a barrier 
for the protection of the people. 
</P>
<P>
Societies from the beginning put up barriers to keep invaders out, to keep 
people safe. You had walled cities. Today, people have security measures in 
their homes, and this is the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Does this preserve neighborhoods or stigmatize them? 
</P>
<P>
A. The long-term result of this is that it preserves the neighborhood and makes 
it much safer. So, in the long run, it does make it a more desirable place to 
live. It is true that it does call attention to the fact that there are 
problems there. But I'd rather get the problems out in the open and get rid of 
them so that in the end you've got an area that has got a great reputation, 
rather than one that has continually festering, underlying problems. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What happens when you take the barricades away? Isn't there a chance that 
the problem will return? 
</P>
<P>
A. We'll just have to wait and see. It's not uncommon in war, and we are in a 
drug war, to keep adjusting your strategies. For instance, we could put the 
barricades back if the drug traffic returned. The point is that what you have 
here is a police captain and a councilman and a neighborhood saying, "We're not 
going to let up on this. We're going to do what the situation demands and 
respond accordingly to keep this area a safe haven." 
</P>
<P>
We're not saying this is the magic solution or professing that it will solve 
the drug problem. But you don't ignore a problem because you don't have the 
total solution. Let the critics come up with the magic answer. I'd be happy to 
hear it.

EFFECT OF CALCIUM, EXERCISE, ESTROGEN IN PREVENTING OSTEOPOROSIS STUDIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANCES GRANDY TAYLOR, THE HARTFORD COURANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
HARTFORD, Conn. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the help of a color computer monitor and a machine called a dual photon 
absorptiometer, Gail Dalsky, an exercise physiologist, can tell women things 
about themselves they probably never knew, or even thought about. 
</P>
<P>
The machine measures bone density, yielding important information that can 
determine whether a person is at risk of developing osteoporosis, a potentially 
disabling disease that primarily strikes women after menopause. 
</P>
<P>
Osteoporosis is caused by the loss of bone density resulting from the sharp 
decline of estrogen production after menopause, which usually occurs between 
age 45 and 55. Bones are weakened and become susceptible to fracture. 
</P>
<P>
Dalsky and Dr. Jo-Anne Smith, director of the Osteoporosis Center at the 
University of Connecticut Medical Center in Farmington, are conducting a study 
on the effects of calcium, estrogen and exercise on bone density and are 
looking for evidence that osteoporosis can be prevented. The study is being 
conducted on women who had their final menstrual period more than three months 
earlier, but less than five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We know that estrogen stops bone loss. And we know that in certain 
populations, exercise will help to a small extent," said Dalsky, who has a 
doctorate in exercise physiology from Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. 
"What hasn't been done, especially in the early post-menopausal woman or in any 
study, is to use both treatments." 
</P>
<P>
While it is recommended that women get the recommended amount of calcium in 
their diet, taking calcium supplements alone will not prevent osteoporosis. 
When calcium supplements are combined with estrogen supplements, they seem to 
make the estrogen more effective in strengthening bone, Dalsky said. 
</P>
<P>
An unrelated study of osteoporosis by Yale University researchers shows that 
women taking the hormone Calcitonin by nasal spray are maintaining bone mass. 
</P>
<P>
The women in the University of Connecticut study will be placed in four groups. 
One group will receive calcium only, another will receive calcium and will 
exercise, another will take estrogen and calcium and the fourth will get a 
combination of calcium, estrogen and exercise, Dalsky said. The researchers 
hope to have 120 volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope that by combining exercise with the estrogen, a woman who is low in 
bone mass upon entry into the study can maintain her bone mass, and that with 
the combination of exercise and estrogen, we can reduce her risk of fracture by 
making her bones stronger. That's the goal," Dalsky said. 
</P>
<P>
The gradual loss of bone is painless until a fall or bump causes a fracture. 
Nearly 250,000 hip fractures occur each year that are related to osteoporosis, 
according to the National Osteoporosis Foundation. These fractures can leave a 
person permanently disabled. 
</P>
<P>
The disease is also responsible for the "dowager's hump" that some elderly 
women have, which is the result of numerous small fractures of the vertebrae. 
Since bone is lost as a result of the aging process, men can also develop the 
disease, but for them it does not usually occur until they reach their late 70s 
or 80s. 
</P>
<P>
Bone density is measured using the dual photon absorptiometer. The patient lies 
flat on her back while a mechanical arm moves along her body, pausing at 
certain points. A camera emits a small amount of radiation, the same amount of 
background radiation that occurs naturally in this area. 
</P>
<P>
A computer printout shows the distinct outline of a hip bone socket known as 
the proximal femur, and another shows the lower vertebrae that intersect with 
the pelvis. These areas are of particular interest to the researchers. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the type of bone that is predominantly in the spine, it is more 
susceptible to the loss of estrogen," Dalsky said. "Often we will see decreases 
in the spine before we see decreases in another body part." 
</P>
<P>
Even though it is normal to lose some bone mass with age, she said, "in 
athletes and people who exercise, we've found they tend to have a higher bone 
density at the hip than they do at the spine. In people who don't exercise, the 
density in each is about the same. 
</P>
<P>
"For instance, my bone density at the spine is 96-97% (normal), and at the hip 
it's about 10% above normal because I exercise," she said, adding that 
weight-bearing exercise such as walking, jogging, stair-climbing and 
weight-training have been shown to have beneficial effects on increasing bone 
mass. 
</P>
<P>
Dalsky said bones respond to exercise the same way that muscles do. "If a 
muscle isn't exercised, it atrophies. If it is exercised, it gets stronger and 
so does bone. It becomes stronger by adding more mineral to the bone," Dalsky 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our study is interested in not only keeping good bone in the spine, but also 
in the hip, because hip fracture is what causes a lot of disability in people. 
About 50% of people who suffer hip fractures do not resume a normal life. They 
are wheelchair-bound or unable to live alone, so we are interested in building 
bone, both at the spine and the hip," Dalsky said. 
</P>
<P>
There are other factors that are believed to make a person susceptible to 
osteoporosis, according to the osteoporosis foundation: Women who are thin and 
small-framed are at greater risk than heavier women. Women who experience early 
menopause may be more likely to develop osteoporosis than other women. Asian 
and Caucasian women are more prone to developing the disease than black women, 
although it is not known why. Calcium deficiency in childhood and early 
adulthood can also increase the risk. Heredity also plays a role. 
</P>
<P>
Angenette Rienow, 49, a financial secretary who lives in Farmington, Conn., is 
a volunteer in the University of Connecticut study, which began this past 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never had any health problems whatsoever, and the little I know about 
osteoporosis is that slender people are more affected, and I've been slender 
all my life," she said. 
</P>
<P>
So far, she has had her bone density examined and her cholesterol checked. She 
has undergone stress tests on a treadmill to determine her level of fitness and 
kept a diary of her eating habits, and she is taking calcium supplements. In 
the next few weeks, she will be assigned to a test group. 
</P>
<P>
"I just thought this would be a good opportunity to find out my physical 
condition, as well as hopefully prevent (disease) from occurring," Rienow said. 
</P>
<P>
She is not particularly worried about developing the disease, and she has never 
known anyone who has it. "But I don't exercise at all. I hear all the things 
about the importance of exercising, and I am just not self-disciplined enough 
to do it. I'm hoping that I get in the exercise group because I really want to 
exercise. I'm a very committed person so if I get in the exercise group, I will 
be there three or four times a week to exercise." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said regular exercise for younger women will help keep bones strong, but 
she stressed that overdoing it can have serious ramifications. 
</P>
<P>
"We've all heard about women who exercise so strenuously that their menstrual 
periods stop for some time. And that's dangerous because they lose the 
protection of estrogen and they become susceptible to fracture much earlier in 
life," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The study may ultimately show that women who use a moderate exercise program up 
to and beyond the age of menopause can offset bone loss. 
</P>
<P>
The women in the study will have a program of brisk walking and climbing stairs 
three times a week in a supervised setting, Smith says. "We have a feeling that 
will be enough to maintain bone mass, something that is definitely doable for 
women in that age range," she said.

KUDELSKI'S GOAL STUNS FLAMES, 4-3; 
</P>
<P>
HOCKEY: KINGS RALLY FROM 3-1 DEFICIT IN THIRD PERIOD TO DEFEAT STANLEY CUP 
CHAMPIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Nobody ever mentioned Bob Kudelski. 
</P>
<P>
Not the people who criticized the trading of Bernie Nicholls to the New York 
Rangers for Tomas Sandstrom and Tony Granato. 
</P>
<P>
Nor the people who praised the deal because of what it would mean to Wayne 
Gretzky to have Sandstrom on his right. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody talked about Kudelski, the man on the left side in this new line. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Kudelski has become the biggest beneficiary of the different alignment. 
</P>
<P>
For the second time in as many games, Kudelski scored two goals Saturday night, 
including the game-winner as the Kings came from behind in the final period to 
shock the Calgary Flames, 4-3, before a sellout Forum crowd of 16,005. 
</P>
<P>
Kudelski has skated past the bigger names into the spotlight on offense, and 
the same can be said for Mario Gosselin on defense. 
</P>
<P>
After playing only four periods in January in relief of the No. 1 goalie, 
slumping Kelly Hrudey, Gosselin came on in relief Thursday night during an 
offensive explosion by the Chicago Blackhawks and was then given a rare start 
Saturday. He responded by stopping 25 of the 28 shots he faced. 
</P>
<P>
"I think when you're not playing a lot, the toughest thing is in your head," he 
said. "I was mad at myself for those three goals." 
</P>
<P>
Kudelski called his game-winner "probably the biggest goal I've scored as a 
King." 
</P>
<P>
It has been a strange season for Kudelski. He missed 15 games after breaking a 
knuckle in a fight, then had to work his way back into the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Mikko Makela was on Gretzky's line. 
</P>
<P>
"But when I saw that wasn't clicking, I knew he (Kudelski) was available," 
Coach Tom Webster said. 
</P>
<P>
Webster's move paid off Saturday in a game the Kings didn't figure to win. 
</P>
<P>
The Flames have been as hot as their name, showing the form that won them the 
Stanley Cup last season. The Smythe Division leaders were undefeated in their 
last eight games and had won four in a row. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings were as cold as the surface they play on, having gone 2-9-2 since New 
Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
And to make matters worse, they trailed 3-1 after two periods. 
</P>
<P>
But after a John Tonelli goal early in the final period, Luc Robitaille tied 
the score at 14:49, and Kudelski's slap shot from the slot, his 17th goal of 
the season, won it at 16:01. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings got the first scoring opportunity of the game, but Calgary took 
advantage of it. 
</P>
<P>
A holding call against the Flames' Al MacInnis gave the Kings the power play 
early in the first period. 
</P>
<P>
But Theoren Fleury got the puck away from Marty McSorley at the point, skated 
down the right side on the breakaway, slid across the middle and faked a pass 
back outside. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Fleury, who ended the Flames' last game with a goal nine seconds 
before the end of overtime, backhanded the puck in just inches outside the goal 
line, past the glove of Gosselin at the 5:35 mark. 
</P>
<P>
It was Fleury's 20th goal, but his first short-handed score this season. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings got even 51 seconds into the second period. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky took the puck off the boards on the right side in the Flames' zone and 
passed it to Kudelski in the slot. 
</P>
<P>
With Calgary goalie Rick Wamsley screened by his own man, Kudelski was able to 
whip the puck past him on his stick side. 
</P>
<P>
Then MacInnis took over. 
</P>
<P>
The Flame defenseman pushed his team into the lead with a pair of goals. 
</P>
<P>
On the first, Sergei Makarov, operating on a power play, passed from behind the 
net to MacInnis in the slot. 
</P>
<P>
From 45 feet out, MacInnis fired a slap shot at Gosselin. The goalie caught a 
piece of the puck, but not enough to divert it from its path into the net. 
</P>
<P>
The goal, coming at 11:08, was MacInnis' 10th on a power play. 
</P>
<P>
At 17:25, he came back with his second goal of the night and 20th of the 
season, scoring on another slap shot, this one from the bottom of the right 
circle. 
</P>
<P>
MacInnis has six points in his last three games and 17 in his last 11. 
</P>
<P>
With the score 3-1 early in the third period, Joel Otto was called for roughing 
and was sent to the penalty box with a double minor. 
</P>
<P>
In the first two minutes of the power play, the Kings managed only two 
unsuccessful shots on goal. 
</P>
<P>
But, then they finally broke through after Robitaille had taken a shot that was 
blocked by Wamsley. 
</P>
<P>
The goalie's momentum left him spread out on the ice. Retrieving the puck by 
the left post, Tonelli shoved it in at the 4:05 mark. 
</P>
<P>
The Flames got one last power play with 2:03 remaining in the game, but failed 
to get a shot on goal. 
</P>
<P>
When it was over, Webster, still ailing, managed a smile. 
</P>
<P>
"A big burden was lifted off our shoulders today," he said. 
</P>
<P>
By Kudelski and Gosselin, of all people, two guys who didn't even figure to be 
there. 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
Coach Tom Webster again watched his team on television from the clubhouse. 
Still bothered by flu symptoms and the effects of a mild concussion suffered 
during a fall in the shower, Webster has been advised to stay off his feet as 
much as possible. . . . This is the start of a home-and-home series with the 
two clubs meeting again Tuesday night in Calgary. . . . Flame left winger Stu 
Grimson is out indefinitely with a cracked cheekbone. Right winger Mark Hunter 
is out for the season after knee surgery. . . . The NHL has named its man of 
the year nominees. One player from each team is selected for the honor, the 
criteria being on-the-ice leadership and community involvement. Dave Taylor is 
the Kings' nominee.

PACERS FEEL SMITS COULD ELEVATE GAME INTO EWING CLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HUBBARD, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
INDIANAPOLIS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At first, Rik Smits approaches the subject cautiously, almost as if he is 
driving into a congested intersection. Will his favorite activity be discussed 
at length, or only in passing? 
</P>
<P>
As he lists his acquisitions, he detects genuine interest, and that is 
exciting. Finally, his friendly demeanor reflects unrestrained happiness. 
</P>
<P>
The subject is not basketball, but that is not an offense in itself. There's 
more to living than basketball, which has been an important part of Smits' life 
for only the last six years. 
</P>
<P>
But if Smits, 23, can develop the passion for basketball that he has for his 
collection of 13 cars -- mostly old Cadillacs -- then look out. 
</P>
<P>
Pacer assistant Bob Hill, a former Knick coach, said of Indiana's 7-4, 
250-pound center: "Rik has every bit as much talent as Patrick Ewing. And as he 
grows in this league, I think we'll see that he'll do for Indiana what Patrick 
does for New York." 
</P>
<P>
Big words, yet Hill's opinion is credible. He was a Knick assistant during 
Ewing's rookie season in 1985-86, and when Hubie Brown was fired 16 games into 
the next season, Hill was head coach for the final 66 games. 
</P>
<P>
Hill seems comfortable in making the comparison between Ewing and Smits. The 
Knicks won the first meeting on Jan. 12, 101-96 in overtime, as Smits outscored 
Ewing 22-20 but Ewing outrebounded Smits 11-7. As a rookie last season, Smits 
was outscored by Ewing 96-55 in five games, but Ewing held only a 42-37 edge in 
rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
Hill qualifies the comparison between Smits and Ewing by noting Smits still 
must develop, particularly in two areas. 
</P>
<P>
"Confidence level and aggression," Hill said. "Rik's still apologetic on the 
floor when he shouldn't be. It's going to take time." 
</P>
<P>
That is evident when one watches and listens to Smits. He seems far more 
delighted in discussing his cars than in speculating about being a dominating 
center. Establishing a career high of 32 points and tying a career high of 15 
rebounds this season was nice, but, man, wouldn't it be great if one of his 
cars could win a demolition derby? (He purchased two "derby" cars last year.) 
</P>
<P>
"They were two old Cadillacs," Smits said. "We entered (a demolition derby), 
but we made a slight mistake. The battery and cable were too close to the 
exhaust manifold, so the cable melted." 
</P>
<P>
That is the rough equivalent of what Smits sometimes does in the heat of 
competition. Part of being a great center is handling the attention from 
opponents. When the Pacers opened the season with a 19-9 record, Smits was 
averaging 15.1 points and shooting 54 percent from the field. But in the next 
15 games, when defenses paid more attention to him, Smits averaged 13.7 points 
and shot 45 percent. 
</P>
<P>
Smits also seems uncomfortable projecting how good he can be. When 
contemplating his potential, he almost visibly melts. "I don't know," he said. 
"To see Patrick Ewing and to see me . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Big difference. Yet Pacer Coach Dick Versace noted it was not until this season 
that Ewing regularly dominated games the way he was supposed to from the 
beginning. 
</P>
<P>
"It's interesting that Patrick is in his fifth year, and they're now giving him 
the accolades and the status that I think everybody expected sooner," Versace 
said. "In Rik's case, it's going to be a similar path." 
</P>
<P>
It will be if Smits can develop the confidence Ewing has had from the 
beginning. But it will be more difficult for Smits, because Ewing entered the 
NBA as a "franchise" center. He was born in Jamaica, but he moved to the United 
States when he was 11. He benefited from high school coaching and helped 
Georgetown win a national championship. 
</P>
<P>
Smits, however, did not even touch a basketball until he was 15. He played on a 
club team in his hometown of Eindhoven, The Netherlands, but was not exposed to 
sophisticated coaching until six years ago, when he arrived at Marist College 
in Poughkeepsie, N..Y., where he received a scholarship because of his size 
alone. No one from Marist had ever seen Smits play in a game. 
</P>
<P>
By the ninth game of his freshman season, Smits was starting. And he improved 
faster than Mario Andretti blasting down a straightaway. In the last game of 
his sophomore season, Smits matched up with Georgia Tech's John Salley, a 
senior who would become a first-round draft choice. Although Tech defeated 
Marist in the NCAA Tournament, Smits outscored Salley 22-9 and, for the first 
time, understood how good he could be. In fact, he celebrated during the summer 
by purchasing his first Cadillac -- a 1976 Coupe de Ville. 
</P>
<P>
"When I held my own against Salley," Smits said, "I figured I could go to the 
pros." 
</P>
<P>
He underestimated himself. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1988 draft, the Pacers selected Smits with the second pick in the first 
round. They were excited. Everything about him was impressive. He was a 
legitimate 7-4. When he stood flatfooted, he could reach 9-9. He had a vertical 
leap of 32 inches. And, most important, despite his late start, he was an 
outstanding shooter. 
</P>
<P>
"The one thing you can't take away from him is that he's got the most amazing 
shooting touch," Versace said. "This is not something that has to evolve as 
well as all the other things. And Ewing did not have that great shooting touch 
when he came in." 
</P>
<P>
The Pacers also were impressed by Smits' demeanor. He is a nice person, which 
makes him enjoyable to be around, but it is not a good disposition to have 
around the basket. Despite his size, Smits, who is averaging 14.6 points this 
season, is not a good rebounder. He averaged 6.1 last season and is averaging 
6.1 this season. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing you've got to understand," Pacer forward LaSalle Thompson 
said, "is that being under the basket is not a walk through the garden. You 
have to learn to hit somebody or be hit. I think he needs to get meaner, but 
that is part of maturing. I think he'll get meaner. He's not naturally an 
aggressive person, so he has to teach that to himself." 
</P>
<P>
Smits chuckled when he heard he was being criticized for being too nice. "I try 
not to be nice," he said, "but that's the way I am." 
</P>
<P>
The Pacers can accept Smits' being nice, but they don't want him to be passive 
about basketball -- on or off the court. Versace says Smits has the potential 
to be one of the top eight centers in the league by the end of next season and 
can be even better. Yet there is a price to pay -- a price that Ewing, an avid 
weightlifter, has paid. Versace wants Smits to bulk up to 270 pounds but said 
Smits was passive during the off-season about weight work. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a little problem with him in that regard," Versace said. "He didn't do 
a lot of weight work, but he did some. He needs to get stronger. The thing that 
is going to make him a great player is his own desire to be a great player. 
That's entirely up to him. 
</P>
<P>
"He's had some nights where you think he's going to be one of the top three or 
four centers in the league. And he's had some other nights where he looks like 
he's going to be a backup center. That's part of the normal process."

MORNING BRIEFING: IT HASN'T BEEN SMOOTH SAILING FOR SOVIET YACHTING VENTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARR KLUENDER

<TEXT>
<P>
First, an American cola company dropped its sponsorship of their yacht because 
of protests about abetting communism. Then, the crewmen of the Soviet yacht, 
Fazisi, learned that their skipper, Alexei Grishencko, had committed suicide by 
hanging himself from a tree in Punta Del Este, Uruguay. And with the fourth leg 
of the Whitbread Round the World Race, 7,190 miles from Auckland, New Zealand, 
to Punta Del Este starting today, the Soviet crew spent the week trying to 
raise money. 
</P>
<P>
"We need new sails for the voyage around Cape Horn," said the new skipper, Skip 
Novak, a professional sailor from Chicago who had volunteered as a consultant 
for the 37,950-mile race that has two legs to Uruguay. 
</P>
<P>
New Zealanders have taken the Soviet crew's plight to heart. One company 
donated a BMW; it was hoped a raffle for the car would raise $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
New Zealand yachtsmen organized a party for 1,000 in a boatyard and raised 
$7,200. A local radio station threw a $60-a plate dinner and a fashion show 
Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Also helping raise funds are sales of red T-shirts with the hammer-and-sickle 
emblem of the Soviet Union emblazoned above the yacht's name. 
</P>
<P>
Novak said he expects the money raised in New Zealand to get the Fazisi to 
Uruguay. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know what we do when we get there," he said. "We are hoping that we 
can pick up some American sponsorship for the leg to Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., so 
we can finish the race. We need another $400,000, but we are philosophical and 
keen to finish." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: If the New York Knicks had held on to the Eastern Conference's 
best record for one more week, Stu Jackson would have become the fourth rookie 
coach in NBA All-Star game history. Name the others. 
</P>
<P>
Perfectly streamlined: Joe Gergen of Newsday paid this tribute to the Lakers' 
Magic Johnson: "Whereas a host of Magic imitators have succeeded mostly in 
making the easy look difficult, Johnson has refined his own game to the point 
where he appears not even to be laboring. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of emphasizing flamboyance, he is doing the simple things better than 
they have ever been done. It is as if he had conducted tests in a wind tunnel 
and discarded all the excess baggage that has hampered him and his team from 
the swiftest possible trip to the basket." 
</P>
<P>
Fire still burns: Jack Nicklaus, on competing at 50: "When I tee it up, I play 
it as a game. It doesn't make any difference whether it's for 10 cents or a 
million dollars. You go out, pull the club back and see if you can do it better 
than anyone else. But I just can't do it as well as I used to. I want to be 
competitive. I don't want to go out there and embarrass myself. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that I'm 50, there is nothing I can do about it. And I'm happy to be 
there, incidentally." 
</P>
<P>
Rink of pain: Defenseman Tom Kurvers of the Toronto Maple Leafs, on why there 
are so many goals scored in Maple Leaf Gardens: "We've got a rink suited for a 
high-scoring game. The ice is real hard, and there are a lot of strange 
bounces. The boards are very lively. That creates a lot of mistakes. We get a 
few goals early, and teams hang their heads. We've had so many games like that, 
we're better suited to an 8-6 game than the teams we're playing." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Ed Macauley, St. Louis Hawks, 1959; Billy Cunningham, 
Philadelphia 76ers, 1978; Pat Riley, Lakers, 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Richie Adubato, coach of the Dallas Mavericks, on the resurgence of 
the Phoenix Suns: "They won 57 games last year, and they're better this year. 
(Tom) Chambers, Mark West and (Kurt) Rambis . . . get 35 rebounds every night."

RIVERS MAKES HIS POINT IN CLIPPER VICTORY; 
</P>
<P>
PRO BASKETBALL: WITH GRANT OUT WITH LONG-TERM INJURY, RESERVE TAKES OVER AND 
LEADS CLUB PAST ORLANDO, 113-110.

<TEXT>
<P>
Between a 126-91 debacle of a loss to Miami Friday night and a 113-110 victory 
over Orlando Saturday night, a lot of things happened for the Clippers. Sleep 
wasn't one of them. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Don Casey didn't sleep well, mulling the plight of his team -- and no 
doubt his own future -- after point guard Gary Grant fractured his ankle 
against the Heat. David Rivers, knowing he would take Grant's place in the 
starting lineup, tossed and turned. 
</P>
<P>
Rivers earned more than 40 winks with his play against the Heat on a day that 
started with the news that Grant would need surgery and is probably out for the 
season, and that finished so full of positives. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In his first start of the season, Rivers had 10 points, nine assists and 
eight rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He also impressed on defense, with five steals. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rivers began the night averaging 10.4 minutes a game and had played in only 
25 games. But he ran an offense that committed only 12 turnovers, tying the 
Clipper season low from Nov. 11. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't totally happy with my performance," Rivers said. "We sort of 
struggled the last few minutes, but that's to be expected. We had a new point 
guard out there directing traffic. It will get better as time goes on." 
</P>
<P>
Except that no one is sure if Rivers will continue to get the time. General 
Manager Elgin Baylor said Saturday he expects to have a point guard from the 
Continental Basketball Assn. signed by Wednesday, in time to play at Washington 
Thursday in the final game before the all-star break. Baylor wouldn't say who 
the Clippers are considering, but Jim Les and Corey Gaines are good bets. 
</P>
<P>
And then there's the possibility of a trade, which continues to loom as the 
Feb. 22 deadline nears. Baylor says nothing is imminent, but such names as 
Danny Ainge of Sacramento and Jeff Malone of Washington continue to circulate. 
</P>
<P>
The general manager makes it policy not to comment on such speculation. 
However, a Sacramento source confirmed that the teams had discussed a deal that 
included Ainge for a No. 1 pick and Joe Wolf, but that the Clippers didn't want 
to surrender so much for someone they figure will be a reserve by this time 
next season. Also, the King official cautioned, talks have fallen dormant the 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
Baylor said Grant's injury, 17 days after Ron Harper went out with cartilage 
and ligament damage in his knee, has made it even tougher to make a deal. Other 
teams figure the Clippers will jump at a deal in hopes of correcting what a 
month ago was such a promising situation, he said, and are holding out for more 
than ever. 
</P>
<P>
Rivers said he wouldn't be surprised if the Clippers made a deal, especially 
after learning that Grant will miss a minimum of three months after it was 
determined he will need pins and a plate inserted to help the left ankle heal 
properly. But Rivers would also like to think Saturday's showing meant 
something. 
</P>
<P>
It did to Casey. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy with David Rivers," the coach said. "He came in with a lot of 
pressure and ran the team." 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to make things easier for the new point guards, Rivers and Tom 
Garrick, the Clippers tinkered with the offense. For the time being, up-tempo 
has come down. There are more half-court setups, compensating for the loss of 
Grant, the player they traded for on draft day 1988 specifically to run the 
fast-break offense. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to minimize the push and just do the opportunity break instead of 
a forced break until we see what Rivers and the others do," Casey said. 
</P>
<P>
Casey also met with Rivers and Garrick. The emphasis was on control and not 
trying to do too much. 
</P>
<P>
"He was concerned about controlling the tempo," said Garrick, who played 16 
minutes after having missed the previous five games with tendinitis in his left 
knee. "He told us to relax the tempo a bit. It worked." 
</P>
<P>
Staying in a half-court game most of the way, the Clippers (20-25) led at the 
end of the first quarter, 33-25, and trailed at intermission, 53-52, after 
being held to 19 points in the second quarter. They took control in the third, 
using an 18-9 run over the final 5:12 to open an 88-78 gap. 
</P>
<P>
With 8:10 remaining in the game, Orlando (13-32) had cut the deficit to 90-88. 
Then the Magic went dead again, falling behind an insurmountable seven points 
with six minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers turned the Magic offense into free throw practice: 11 points from 
the line, but only two field goals in the final 5:19. When Orlando needed one 
more in a 113-110 game, a three-point attempt at the buzzer by Otis Smith from 
the left corner, it hit short. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers survived. The point guards, interim or otherwise, did better than 
that. 
</P>
<P>
Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
Gary Grant will be operated on Monday by Dr. Tony Daly, the team physician, at 
Saint John's Hospital in Santa Monica. . . . Tom Garrick, who had six points, 
two assists and two rebounds in 16 minutes, on his return: "I didn't feel real 
tired. I guess I was so excited to be back." . . . The Jeff Malone trade rumor: 
A package from the Clippers that includes one of their two No. 1 draft picks in 
1990 and the two second-rounders from 1989, Jeff Martin and Jay Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
Benoit Benjamin had a season-high seven blocked shots, adding 22 points and 
eight assists, but only five rebounds. . . . Danny Manning and Charles Smith 
led the Clippers with 23 points each, and Manning also had a team-high 11 
rebounds. Sam Vincent had 26 points and 13 assists for Orlando.

IT'S NOT EASY WHEN YOUR NAME IS GRETZKY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB GLOSTER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SOLIHULL, England 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The player with GRETZKY on his uniform and a somewhat familiar face steals the 
puck in front of his own goal, skates swiftly to center ice and unleashes a 
slap shot that sails into the net. 
</P>
<P>
That's about where the similarities end between this Gretzky and his older 
brother. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Gretzky, 22, is playing for a mediocre Scottish team that doesn't even 
have a home rink. Wayne Gretzky, 29, is adding to his NHL-record scoring total 
for the Los Angeles Kings. 
</P>
<P>
While Wayne is known as "The Great One," Keith has been nicknamed "The Good 
One" by teammates and is trying to establish himself as a player. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't compare Keith to Wayne," said former NHL journeyman Rocky Saganuik, 
now Keith's coach with the Ayr Raiders. "For many years he's been stuck in a 
Wayne Gretzky shadow and he hasn't been able to develop as Keith Gretzky. He's 
deteriorated, he's rusted out a bit." 
</P>
<P>
Ayr has the same black-and-white uniforms as Los Angeles and Keith resembles 
his older brother. His style on the ice is similar and he is more apt -- like 
Wayne -- to try to poke a puck away than lower his shoulder and apply a hard 
check. Both are centers. 
</P>
<P>
But Keith lacks the quickness of his sibling and is smaller at about 5-foot-8 
and 160 pounds. Once voted the smartest player in Canadian junior hockey, he 
simply has not been big enough to survive in the brutal North American game. 
</P>
<P>
The name recognition is lower in Britain. As he took the ice recently for the 
opening faceoff against the Solihull Barons, a local fan asked, "Who's this new 
Canadian they have?" 
</P>
<P>
His anonymity did not extend to everyone in the crowd, however. Sitting a 
couple of rows behind the Ayr bench was 17-year-old Samantha Walker, wearing a 
Kings jersey with Wayne's No. 99 on the back. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's good, but it must be pretty difficult trying to live up to 
expectations," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The younger Gretzky was not surprised when a journalist asked the customary 
question about being Wayne's brother. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course that's a problem, people expect a lot," he answered. "I've gotten 
used to it -- sometimes it's a pain, sometimes it's not." 
</P>
<P>
Keith scored 59 points in 68 games last season bouncing between Rochester of 
the American Hockey League and Flint of the International Hockey League, but 
asked for a move to Finland at the end of the season so he could get more ice 
time. 
</P>
<P>
He had six goals and six assists in 23 games for the Phoenix Roadrunners of the 
IHL this season when he requested the transfer to Ayr. Still suffering from jet 
lag, he had five goals and four assists in his first two games for the Raiders 
in mid-January. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky said his hardest adjustments have been to British refereeing, which 
players say tends to favor the home team, and to the lack of games. 
</P>
<P>
British teams have only a 36-game league schedule and practice far less than 
North American counterparts. Ayr is awaiting the opening of a new home rink and 
now manages only one practice a week. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough getting used to your teammates when you don't play together that 
much. Now I'm mentally getting into it," he said, tucking a pinch of snuff 
under his lip. "And I don't know who I'm playing against. When you play against 
guys eight times a year that really helps a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Saganuik said Gretzky's on-ice savvy will be better rewarded when his teammates 
get used to his slick passing, but refused to speculate on whether Keith has an 
NHL future. 
</P>
<P>
"His life in hockey is in Europe for now and maybe for the next couple of 
years," the coach said. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky is not thinking about the future, only about Ayr's struggle to grab the 
last spot in the six-team British playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
On Super Bowl night he helped the Raiders score two goals in the final 89 
seconds to defeat Solihull 5-4 on ice that had to be shoveled between periods 
because the Zamboni machine was broken. 
</P>
<P>
After a brief celebration in a locker room the size of a kitchen, the player 
with the famous name was reminded again that he is not in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
"C'mon, Keith, we'd better go," Saganuik said. "The bus has to be returned by 5 
a.m."

NHL NOTES;

<P>
NORTH STARS WOULD COME FULL CIRCLE IN MOVE TO OAKLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM SMITH, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The North Stars' plan to relocate is no idle threat. It is likely they will not 
return to Bloomington, Minn., next season and will play in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the North Stars applied to the NHL for permission to transfer 
their franchise to an unspecified location after the season. Brothers George 
and Gordon Gund co-own the team. Gordon told the St. Paul Pioneer Press 
Dispatch, "Oakland is our choice. It's the fourth-largest market in the U.S. 
and it's where George lives." 
</P>
<P>
If the North Stars want to move, in the wake of Al Davis' legal victory over 
the NFL, there is no way the NHL can prevent it. The North Stars say they will 
lose $4 million this season for a total of $16 million in losses from 1987-90. 
They have demanded that $15 million in improvements be made at their 
15,093-seat Met Center, including the doubling of luxury suites from 20 to 40. 
The Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission, which owns the arena, is 
expected to offer a compromise at its next meeting Feb. 21. 
</P>
<P>
Its director of operations, Dennis Alfton, told Newsday, "They want us to spend 
$15 million so they can get $13 million in additional revenue over the next 
four years. That's hard to agree to." Alfton said the commission received the 
proposal Wednesday and is digesting it. 
</P>
<P>
Bloomington Mayor Neil Peterson said, "I think the commission will try to do 
something. If not, the North Stars are gone and it's their fault." 
</P>
<P>
The NBA's Timberwolves, drawing 24,000 fans a game at the Metrodome, will move 
into a new 18,000-seat arena in Minneapolis this fall. On Wednesday, they 
offered the North Stars three years rent-free in it. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon Gund rejected that offer. He said he paid only $126,000 in rent last 
year, so free rent is no big deal. Gund said if his team moved to the new 
arena, where it would not share parking, concession, advertising and luxury-box 
revenue, it would lose $18 million in the next four years instead of the $10 
million he projects if it stays put. 
</P>
<P>
Alfton said, "We want to keep the North Stars," but added the commission might 
let the debt-ridden team go and seek an expansion franchise. "That probably 
will be one of the alternatives we'll review," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a good area," Alfton said. "A lot of good hockey is played here. But 
the North Stars have not put a good product on the ice. Improvements need to be 
made (to Met Center). But that isn't the reason people aren't going there." 
</P>
<P>
The North Stars say they are selling fewer than 11,000 tickets per game and 
their tickets-used average is 7,800, the NHL's worst. NHL spokesman Gerry 
Helper said franchise relocations require an amendment to the league 
constitution plus a unanimous vote from its Board of Governors. Such amendments 
and votes were obtained by the Atlanta Flames when they moved to Calgary in 
1980 and the Colorado Rockies in 1982 when they became the Devils. The board 
meets Feb. 19-20 in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
If the move is approved, the North Stars franchise will have come full circle. 
It was one of six expansion clubs that joined the NHL in 1967. Eleven years 
later, it merged with the Cleveland Barons, who lasted two winless seasons 
after having been transplanted from Oakland in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland never had a winning season in nine years and was the NHL's worst 
drawing team. George Gund was a one-third owner of the Oakland franchise when 
it shifted to Cleveland and bought out his partners. The North Stars had five 
straight winning seasons from 1979-84 but have had only one in the past five. 
</P>
<P>
NHL President John Ziegler, who seems sympathetic, said, "It is imperative that 
each (club) has maximum revenue opportunity from the area in which the team 
plays. It is well-recognized that the Met Center at the present time does not 
provide the type facilities which will be needed for the North Stars to compete 
in the '90s." 
</P>
<P>
Can Oakland support a team? Groups in San Francisco and San Jose are vying for 
an expansion franchise. If the North Stars move, they would be co-tenants at 
the 15,039-seat Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum with the NBA's Golden State 
Warriors. A new arena is expected to be built nearby soon. 
</P>
<P>
The Coliseum is owned by the city and county and run by Coliseum, Inc., whose 
president, George Vukasin, referred questions to the North Stars. The Gunds did 
not return calls to Newsday. 
</P>
<P>
Remember last spring when goaltending seemed the least of the Blackhawks' 
worries? Alain Chevrier had a 2.61 goals-against average in 16 playoff games, 
leading them to series victories over Detroit and St. Louis before they were 
ousted by Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago has the NHL's fourth-best record (29-19-4) after Thursday night's 7-4 
win over the Los Angeles Kings in Inglewood, Calif., but goaltending now is its 
biggest problem. Coach Mike Keenan has yanked his starting goalie 12 times this 
season. The Blackhawks are 4-8 in those games. Saturday he used Chevrier and 
Jacques Cloutier twice each in a 6-4 loss in Hartford. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Blackhawks General Manager Bob Pulford and assistant Jack Davison 
flew to Czechoslovakia to try to sign goalie Domenic Hasek, their 10th-round 
1983 draft pick. Chicago's first-round choice in 1987, goalie Jimmy Waite, is 
playing with Indianapolis of the IHL. 
</P>
<P>
To prepare for the Kings, Keenan held a three-day mini-camp at a ski resort at 
Lake Arrowhead East of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In a 7-4 home win over the Kings last month, three French-speaking Maple Leafs 
were chosen as stars of the game, a rarity in English-speaking Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
"There hasn't been many French guys play here," said left wing Vincent 
Damphousse, who was named first star. The others were Daniel Marois and Gilles 
Thibadeau. They played on a line until Jan. 19, when Thibadeau was sent to 
Newmarket of the AHL. 
</P>
<P>
"I was the first French guy they drafted in the first round (in 1986)," 
Damphousse said. "I was born and raised in Montreal. We're all hockey players. 
In Quebec, most of the players are playmakers and scorers. Hopefully, they'll 
realize there's some good players in Quebec and draft more." 
</P>
<P>
Former Red Wings left wing Bob Probert is to be released from prison next week, 
but his problems are not over. He pleaded guilty to importing cocaine and was 
convicted after being arrested in March with 14.3 grams. 
</P>
<P>
A Chicago immigration judge on Jan. 2 ordered Probert, a Canadian citizen, 
deported, citing the conviction and his history of alcoholism. Probert has 
appealed. 
</P>
<P>
The appeal process could take a year. In the meantime, he is not permitted to 
leave the United States. So, if the Red Wings reinstate him, he could not play 
in Canada. No date has been set for hearing his appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit Coach Jacques Demers said of Probert, "Even if he wins, I would think 
it will be a year or more before he comes back. We need a tremendous commitment 
from Bob Probert before we'll let him anywhere near the team."

COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
IT'S NOT PRETTY, BUT KANSAS GETS 85-74 WIN OVER OKLAHOMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After helping No. 2 Kansas to a sloppily played, 85-74 victory over 
ninth-ranked Oklahoma at Lawrence, Kan., Kevin Pritchard glanced at a score 
sheet and shook his head in disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
"We shot 38%," he said. "That's kind of mind-boggling." 
</P>
<P>
Coming into the rematch of the 1988 NCAA finalists, the Jayhawks (22-1, 5-1 in 
the Big Eight) led the nation with a field goal percentage of 54.3%. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think this team could shoot that bad," Pritchard said. 
</P>
<P>
But the Sooners (15-3, 4-2) were held almost 40 points below their season 
average of 112.5 points by a Kansas defense that kept switching and 
experimenting throughout the game. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Oklahoma was without its No. 2 scorer and No. 1 rebounder, William 
Davis, who did not make the trip because of disciplinary action. 
</P>
<P>
There were 55 fouls in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Pritchard and Rick Calloway led a Kansas run that halted Oklahoma's lone rally 
in the second half and assured the Jayhawks of their 14th consecutive win at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
The Sooners cut Kansas' lead to 53-48 with about eight minutes left, but 
Pritchard's two free throws ignited a 15-6 run that put the game out of reach. 
Calloway, who led the Jayhawks with 20 points, scored eight in that stretch and 
Pritchard had four. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
OTHER TOP 25 TEAMS 
</P>
<P>
No. 4 Michigan 77, Wisconsin 63 -- Both teams were missing key players, but the 
Wolverines' superior depth enabled them to win the Big Ten game at Madison, 
Wis. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan (16-4, 6-3) was without third-leading scorer Sean Higgins, who 
sustained a stress fracture in his left foot in a 91-72 loss to Purdue last 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Badgers were without second-leading scorer Willie Simms, who was declared 
academically ineligible by the NCAA Friday. Simms dropped a class during the 
week, which put him below the NCAA minimum of 12 credits. He later added a 
class, making him eligible for Thursday's game at Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Mills scored 20 points for the Wolverines and Loy Vaught added 18. 
Wisconsin's Danny Jones had 25 points. 
</P>
<P>
No. 6 Georgetown 74, No. 18 St. John's 67 -- The Redmen lost their third game 
in a row, but they also lost power forward Jayson Williams, who reinjured his 
right foot three minutes into the Big East Conference game at Madison Square 
Garden. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, St. John's second-leading scorer and leading rebounder, missed the 
first 10 games of the season because of a fracture in his right foot suffered 
in the first week of practice. He averaged 15.7 points and 8.3 rebounds since 
returning from the injury in October. 
</P>
<P>
Georgetown (17-2, 7-2), remained tied for the Big East lead, took advantage of 
Williams' absence, fouling out starting center Rob Werdann and his backup, Sean 
Muto, with more than six minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
Georgetown made just four baskets in the final eight minutes, but the Hoyas 
made 11 of 16 free throws, three of the misses coming in the last two minutes 
when the outcome was apparent. St. John's (17-6, 6-4) led, 37-32, at halftime 
after closing the half with a 10-1 run. 
</P>
<P>
No. 7 Syracuse 90, Florida State 69 -- Billy Owens scored 23 points, including 
12 during a decisive 10-minute stretch in the first half, as the Orangemen 
routed the Seminoles at Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
The Orangemen (16-3) have won four in a row, three on the road. Florida State 
(13-10) has lost six of its last eight games. 
</P>
<P>
Owens sparked a 24-11 run that gave Syracuse a 42-27 halftime lead. Derrick 
Coleman scored nine points in the first four minutes of the second half as the 
Orangemen extended the lead to 55-32. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan State 64, No. 8 Purdue 53 -- Steve Smith made seven free throws in the 
final two minutes at West Lafayette, Ind., to help the Spartans deal the 
Boilermakers their first Big Ten loss of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Purdue (16-3, 8-1), made only 29% of its shots, but rallied from a 14-point 
deficit to pull to within four points on Woody Austin's three-point shot with 
1:33 left. Smith, who had 22 points, then made two free throws. After Austin 
missed a three-point shot, the Spartans (17-5, 6-3) got the rebound and Smith 
made two more foul shots with 1:09 left to make it 61-53. 
</P>
<P>
No. 13 Connecticut 92, Providence 77 -- The Huskies extended their winning 
streak to nine games with an easy Big East victory at Providence, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Smith, who led Connecticut with 21 points, and John Gwynn helped the 
Huskies (19-3, 7-2) take a 21-point lead with 9:55 left. The Friars (12-7, 5-5) 
could get no closer than 13 the rest of the game. 
</P>
<P>
No. 15 La Salle 89, Iona 73 -- The Explorers, led by Doug Overton, scored 24 of 
the game's final 32 points to win the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference game 
at New Rochelle, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
La Salle (16-1, 7-0) led at halftime, 47-37, but Iona (8-12, 3-6) fought back 
and took its first lead at 59-58 on a steal and dunk by Joey Johnson with 12:28 
left. Kevin Cooper's tip-in extended the Gaels' margin to 61-58. 
</P>
<P>
Overton ended a 3:52 scoring drought for La Salle with a basket that cut Iona's 
lead to 61-60 with 9:20 left. With the score tied at 65, he keyed a 13-2 run 
with seven points. He made two free throws, a three-point shot and made both 
ends of a one-and-one, giving the Explorers a 78-67 lead with 2:59 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
No. 17 Georgia Tech 90, Maryland 84 -- Dennis Scott scored 17 of his 26 points 
in the second half and the Yellow Jackets twice rallied from 11-point deficits 
in the Atlantic Coast Conference game at College Park, Md. 
</P>
<P>
The Yellow Jackets (14-4, 4-4) trailed, 41-30, in the first half and 55-44 with 
17:56 remaining before winning their second consecutive ACC game. 
</P>
<P>
Scott scored eight points, including two three-point shots, in the second-half 
run. Maryland (13-8, 3-4) got to within 82-78 with 1:39 left, but Georgia Tech 
made its final eight free throws. 
</P>
<P>
No. 23 Xavier (Ohio) 88, Dayton 81 -- Jamal Walker made six free throws in the 
final 75 seconds to give the Musketeers a Midwestern Collegiate Conference win 
at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
Xavier (17-2, 6-1) trailed, 44-40, at halftime as Dayton (11-8, 4-3) shot 56% 
and Walker made just one of five shots and committed five of 14 Xavier 
turnovers. But Walker made two layups early in the second half to put the 
Musketeers ahead to stay.

EAST 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 94, Villanova 82 -- Darelle Porter and Brian Shorter led a pair of 
second-half runs that carried the hot-shooting Panthers to their third 
consecutive victory in a Big East game at Pittsburgh, despite a Big East record 
15 three-point baskets by Villanova. 
</P>
<P>
Porter, who finished with 21 points, scored four points and had three assists 
during a 10-2 run early in the second half that saw Pitt turn a 45-44 deficit 
into a 54-47 lead with 14:33 to play. 
</P>
<P>
Shorter, who had 24 points, scored seven of those during a 17-5 run that gave 
Pitt (9-10) a 77-63 lead after Villanova (12-11) rallied to within 60-58. 
</P>
<P>
Pitt shot 60.7%, including 68.9% in the second half, against a Villanova 
defense that was limiting its opponents to 38.9% shooting, third-best in NCAA 
Division I. 
</P>
<P>
Boston College 78, Seton Hall 65 -- The Eagles rallied in the second half at 
Boston to win their first Big East game of the season. 
</P>
<P>

with 1:27 left. Mark Macon had 27 points for Temple. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SOUTH 
</P>
<P>
Kentucky 88, Georgia 77 -- A swarming defense that forced the Bulldogs into 
committing a season-high 33 turnovers, and two free throws by John Pelphrey 
with 1:11 left gave the Wildcats the Southeastern Conference win at Lexington, 
Ky. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia (13-6, 6-4) rallied from a 75-65 deficit to within 79-75 on Jody 
Patton's two free throws with 1:36 remaining. But Kentucky (10-10, 6-5) 
countered with Derrick Miller's three-point play and Pelphrey's free throws to 
take a 84-75 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Auburn 89, Tennessee 83 -- Chris Brandt scored a career-high 28 points at 
Auburn, Ala., to help the Tigers knock the Volunteers out of a four-way tie for 
the SEC lead.

Auburn (7-13, 4-6) opened the second half with a 20-8 run that put the Tigers 
ahead, 50-36, and they never trailed after that. Tennessee (11-8, 6-4) could 
come no closer than eight points until 1:35, when they cut the lead to six. 
</P>
<P>
Alabama 65, Vanderbilt 56 -- Robert Horry scored 23 points and Melvin Cheatum 
added 17 at Nashville as the Crimson Tide took over sole possession of first 
place in the SEC. 
</P>
<P>
The victory gave Alabama (16-5, 7-3) a half-game lead over LSU and a one-game 
lead over Georgia and Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
Vanderbilt (13-6, 5-5) cut the lead to 54-47 with 4:49 to play, but the Tide 
went on a 7-1 run to take a 61-48 lead with 1:03 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Mississippi 83, Florida 63 -- Forward Gerald Glass scored 26 points at 
Gainesville, Fla., as the Rebels handed the Gators their worst home defeat in 
10 years. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC loss was the worst for Florida (6-11, 2-8) since a 21-point setback to 
Mississippi State. The Gators have lost six in a row for the first time since 
1981-82. 
</P>
<P>
Mississippi (7-12, 4-6) took a 10-1 lead three minutes into the game as the

four-game losing streak for the Cornhuskers (8-11, 1-5). 
</P>
<P>
Jean Derouillere scored 29 points for Kansas State (12-10, 2-4). 
</P>
<P>
Virginia 96, Marquette 91 -- Bryant Stith scored eight of his 35 points in 
overtime and the Cavaliers made 10 of 11 free throws in the extra period to 
beat the Warriors at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
Stith's two free throws with 1:57 left in overtime gave Virginia (13-6) the

Santa Clara 70, Portland 57 -- Ron Reis scored 20 points to lead the Broncos to 
a West Coast Conference win at Santa Clara. 
</P>

REBELS FORGET THEIR TROUBLES, 88-82; 
</P>
<P>
UNLV: DESPITE RECENT PROBLEMS AND SUSPENSIONS, 12TH-RANKED TEAM BEATS NORTH 
CAROLINA STATE. 
</P>

LAS VEGAS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nevada Las Vegas Coach Jerry Tarkanian said he was pleased to pull out an 88-82 
victory over North Carolina State Saturday -- considering. 
</P>
<P>
After an ongoing hassle with the NCAA that brought the one-game suspension of 
10 of his players, and a brawl Thursday night that brought suspensions for two 
others, he was ready to play basketball, not dodge off-court problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Overall I thought we played very well, considering what's been going on," 
Tarkanian said. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Johnson scored 24 points, including four free throws in the closing 
seconds, to lead No. 12 UNLV. 
</P>
<P>
The Rebels (16-4) held the Wolfpack scoreless for a four-minute span in the 
closing minutes, scoring 10 points in a row to turn a 69-68 deficit into a 
78-69 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Tarkanian said the events of the past week may have made his Rebels a little 
timid. 
</P>
<P>
"We told the guys how important it was to play hard, but not to commit any 
aggressive fouls," he said. "We stressed not to foul, but we played so timid. 
Defensively we didn't create the game I wanted." 
</P>
<P>
Wolfpack Coach Jim Valvano said his club executed its game plan "almost to 
perfection" until the final minutes when they were handcuffed by the UNLV 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
Valvano wasn't happy with an intentional foul call with 37 seconds remaining 
that gave the Rebels two free throws and the ball back. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe we should go back to the old NBA rule where they allowed you to go up 
and nicely hug the guy and get the foul," Valvano said. 
</P>
<P>
Rodney Monroe scored 31 points for N.C. State (15-6) and Brian Howard, Tom 
Gugliotta and Brian D'Amico had 10 each. Stacey Augmon hit 16 for Las Vegas and 
David Butler and Greg Anthony had 15 each. 
</P>
<P>
The Runnin' Rebels led at halftime, 43-42, fell behind by five, then went on a 
14-4 run to pull ahead, 61-56, midway through the second half. 
</P>
<P>
N. C. State regained the lead, 69-68, on baskets by Mickey Hinnant and Chris 
Corchiani, but then came their scoreless streak. 
</P>
<P>
The Wolfpack pulled within 80-77 with a minute remaining on a three-point shot 
by Gugliotta. But Anthony and Johnson hit four free throws each to put the game 
away. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams have been in NCAA trouble this season. N. C. State has been barred 
from the NCAA tournament as part of sanctions resulting from violations 
involving the sale of complimentary tickets and shoes by players. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA has ordered 10 UNLV players suspended for a game each for violations 
ranging from failure to pay incidental expenses at hotels where the team stayed 
for road games to one case where a player failed to keep current on a student 
loan. The suspensions were imposed on a two-players-per-game basis, with 
reserves Barry Young and James Jones sitting out Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, reserve center Chris Jeter was ordered by the university to sit 
out three games, including Saturday's, for his role in a brawl at the end of 
Thursday's game against Utah State. 
</P>
<P>
Seven UNLV players and three from Utah State were placed on probation for the 
remainder of the season by the Big West Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Security at the 19,000-seat Thomas and Mack Center was tightened for Saturday's 
game and players exited from different routes.

MUTOMBO: ZAIRE'S BASKETBALL AMBASSADOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM LAYDEN, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yes, things do look different from where Dikembe Mutombo stands, some 7 feet, 3 
inches (at least) in the air and several thousand miles from his home in Zaire. 
</P>
<P>
The rim looks lower, the crowds more daunting and the language more 
complicated, and in this case, one player's perspective doesn't stop until it 
has touched everything within its reach. Blocked shots are only the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
Mutombo, quite innocently, has pushed open the door to the most insular program 
in the land and let just a crack of light pass through. This is no ordinary 
Hoya, this 21-year-old who speaks five languages (not including several African 
dialects) and who without so much as a shred of effort resists the 
gray-shirted, stonefaced stereotype that has existed since Patrick Ewing 
delivered his first scowl. This is an ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
"His entire personal presentation, the way he speaks, the way he acts, is not 
in any way what you would expect from a basketball player," said Betsy 
McCormick, academic counselor in Georgetown's school of language and 
linguistics. "I think he connects with the students here, personally, as much 
as they see him as a symbol for the basketball team. He gives them something 
back for supporting him." 
</P>
<P>
Said Mutombo, "All of the students, they like me a lot. My teachers, they all 
like me a lot, too." 
</P>
<P>
Students who know him well address Mutombo by the cuddly nickname "Deekums." 
His teammates, meaning no disrespect, call him, simply "Mutombo," as much 
because it falls rhythmically into line with "Alonzo." That would be Alonzo 
Mourning, the Hoyas' 6-10 sophomore forward, who plays alongside Mutombo after 
playing in front of him a year ago, when Rejection Row, in honor of their 244 
blocked shots, was christened at the Capital Centre. 
</P>
<P>
What Mutombo has brought to Georgetown is an engaging and fascinating mix of 
the naive and the learned. As much as he was mystified by opponents woofing at 
him ("I think I am not too comfortable with this stuff," he said), he is on 
solid ground where other college athletes, anywhere, are not. 
</P>
<P>
"We were sitting at dinner before we played Villanova," said Georgetown Coach 
John Thompson. "It was myself and Alonzo, one of the managers and Dikembe. We 
were talking about some recent developments in Africa. Now, there's no way we 
would have been talking about that if Dikembe hadn't been sitting there." 
</P>
<P>
The story of his immigration is no less fascinating than you would expect. 
Consider: Mutombo didn't play basketball until he was 16 years old and a 
student at Institute Boboto in Kinsasha, Zaire. His older brother, Ilo, was the 
best player in the country, but less than a year after Dikembe began playing, 
that changed. 
</P>
<P>
Herman Henning, a former Chicago high school coach working for the U.S. 
Information Agency in Africa, told Thompson about Mutombo. Thompson hears all 
the time about the next Akeem Olajuwon. He gets photographs of young kids 
hanging from the rim, but the pictures never show their feet, which are often 
on a stepladder. Thompson was able to determine two things: "That this kid was 
big and mobile." Which was enough to take a shot. 
</P>
<P>
Mutombo arrived in the fall of 1987 and was introduced to Thompson 20 minutes 
after hitting the runway. He was duly intimidated by his future coach, who 
stands 6-10 and weighs considerably more than Mutombo's 235 pounds. "I saw him 
and I thought 'Oh no, this guy is going to be my teammate,' " Mutombo said. 
"Then I heard he would be the coach. It was scary, very scary, to have a coach 
so big like that." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson relished the role, telling Mutombo that if he hadn't been all of 7-2, 
he was going to send him home. "I remind him of that all the time," Thompson 
said. "He still doesn't know if I was kidding. I like it that way." Lest 
Thompson be cast as a tyrant, consider that where Mutombo is concerned, the 
coach betrays a genuine softness. It has been necessary to grind Mutombo in 
practice, but in sum, Thompson said, "A kid like this, he's got the whole 
package, intellectually, athletically." 
</P>
<P>
Mutombo leads the Big East with four blocks a game and is fifth with 8.9 
rebounds. "He's big, and I mean big," said Syracuse's Derrick Coleman. "But the 
thing is, he can run the floor, too. He gets up and down. You have to play him, 
and with him and Alonzo both in there, it's just tough to get anything off." 
</P>
<P>
The offensive package is less refined. Mutombo is slowly transforming himself 
from a shot-blocking curiosity into a weapon, but still averages only 6.8 
points, up from 3.9 a year ago. "I think I'm working very hard to improve my 
offense," Mutombo said. "I know I have a long way to go." 
</P>
<P>
There is always room in the NBA for a very tall man with athletic skills, so 
his future is virtually assured. Equal time, however, is given to the matters 
of adaptation and homesickness, each of which find a place in Mutombo's 15-hour 
days. "The cultural gaps have been hard for him to bridge," McCormick said. 
</P>
<P>
Though his older brother plays at Southern Indiana and his younger brother is 
playing for a high school in Philadelphia, Mutombo is still essentially alone. 
"I miss my family very much," he said. One older brother died last year, and 
Mutombo could not return home for the funeral. And of course, he is a constant 
source for the inquisitiveness of others. "People are so curious about me, the 
way I speak so many languages and where I come from," Mutombo said. But then, 
"I like it, you know. I'm not afraid of people asking about me."

IRVINE HAS CHANCE TO WIN, BUT LOSES 13TH IN A ROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A victory for UC Irvine was dangling, closer than at any time in recent weeks, 
against the University of the Pacific Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters still lost, though, 76-75, before 1,823 at the Bren Center. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine, which had lost 12 consecutive games but was playing as well as it had 
all season, trailed Pacific by one point with five seconds left. The Anteaters 
inbounded the ball at midcourt. 
</P>
<P>
Dylan Rigdon, who had made six of 10 shots from the field, including five of 
eight three-pointers, took the pass and dribbled toward the basket. Rigdon, a 
freshman guard, pulled up 10 feet away and launched an awkward-looking jump 
shot with the Tigers' Dell Demps hounding him with three seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
The ball clanged off the back of the rim and into the hands of Jeff Von Lutzow, 
whose hurried follow hit the side of the backboard. 
</P>
<P>
And Irvine (2-18 overall, 0-11 in Big West Conference play) had lost its 13th 
consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I should have taken it to the hole instead of pulling up," Rigdon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure I'll be thinking about this for days, weeks, months." 
</P>
<P>
Rigdon had a career-high 22 points as Irvine seemed primed for its first 
victory since a 75-62 win over San Diego State on Dec. 16. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters built a 14-point lead after a dunk by Von Lutzow with 5:10 left 
in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
But Pacific (12-8, 5-6) chipped away at the lead, trailing just 35-33 at 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
The lead changed hands in the second half with Pacific taking control for good, 
68-67, on Demps' three-pointer with 3:36 left. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Irvine cut the lead to 76-75 on a three-pointer by Rigdon with 11 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Demps had 26 points on 11-of-14 shooting for Pacific.

Gary Gray scored 18 points to lead UC Santa Barbara to a 78-57 Big West 
Conference basketball victory over Fresno State Saturday night at Goleta. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
Tod Bernard scored 15 points for Fresno State (8-11, 3-7).

Santa Barbara led, 37-28, at the half, but the Bulldogs scored the first four 
points of the second half to make it 37-32 with 18:34 left. 
</P>
<P>
But Fresno State was held scoreless for the next 3:06 while the Gauchos scored 
17 points in a row. The Gauchos built their largest lead, 54-37, with 10:06 
left to play when Carrick DeHart scored on a layup.

NEW MEXICO STATE GETS EVEN WITH LONG BEACH, 104-91 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
LAS CRUCES, N.M. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The big rematch was over early. With about nine minutes left in the first half 
Saturday, the raucous, revenge-minded 12,599 New Mexico State fans at the Pan 
American Center were already shouting toward the Cal State Long Beach bench, 
"Go start the bus." 
</P>
<P>
It seemed reasonable advice for the 49ers, who had just gone through a 
four-minute nightmare in which they were outscored, 17-0. 
</P>
<P>
That run increased a 23-18 New Mexico State lead to 40-18, and from there the 
Aggies eased to a 104-91 victory over the only team that has defeated them in 
the Big West Conference this season. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't like losing to them down there," New Mexico State Coach Neil 
McCarthy said, referring to the 49ers' 72-56 victory Jan. 15 in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Aggie guard Randy Brown, who converted a steal into a breakaway dunk during 
that stunning stretch midway through the opening half, pinpointed the reason 
for the Aggies' success: "We just ate their press up, slicing through for easy 
baskets. I'm surprised they kept it on. I guess that's their bread and butter." 
</P>
<P>
Before the run was over, Brown added four consecutive free throws after Long 
Beach Coach Joe Harrington was assessed two successive technical fouls for his 
complaints about the officiating. 
</P>
<P>
"When a game gets out of control, it's hard to regain control," Harrington 
said. "I thought a quick technical might help. It didn't, so I got another 
one." 
</P>
<P>
The Aggies, who never trailed, were just getting started. They sped to leads of 
58-29 and 60-31 before settling for a 63-31 halftime lead. It was the most 
points New Mexico State had scored in a first half in 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
The many easy shots the Aggies got were reflected in their 64% field-goal 
shooting in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
"New Mexico State played like a nationally ranked team tonight," Harrington 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Aggies, who have not broken into the top 25 this season, are 18-2 overall 
and 9-1 in the Big West. They are 12-0 at home and have a four-game winning 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
And they won without center James Anderson, their leading scorer and rebounder, 
who had returned to East Chicago, Ind., for his grandmother's funeral. 
</P>
<P>
But Jason Trask and Chris Hickman filled in for Anderson and combined for 19 
points and 12 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
William Benjamin, who made 13 of 16 free throws, led the Aggies with 18 points. 
Brown and Keith Hill each scored 16, Michael New had 15 and Reggie Jordan 14. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach used a flurry of three-point shots to get within 10 twice in the 
last minute. 
</P>
<P>
"We were too far behind," said Harrington, whose team fell to 13-6 and 6-5. 
"It's hard to get something going when they go to the line so much." 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico State made 32 of 52 foul shots, but the game got somewhat closer 
because the Aggies made only 17 of 33 from the line in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"When we get up on a team we keep the score down by missing free throws," 
McCarthy said. "If we have a weakness, it's that we don't have a killer 
instinct." 
</P>
<P>
Lucious Harris, despite eight-of-23 shooting from the field, led the 49ers with 
18 points. Kenny Jarvis and Mike Masucci each scored 16. 
</P>
<P>
The Aggies, who had claimed they were tired from playing four games in eight 
days when they lost at Long Beach, were still fresh at the end this time, 
becoming the first team this season to score more than 100 points against the 
49ers.

49ERS' GREATNESS IS A PRODUCT OF THE SYSTEM, NOT PLAYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Before he left the game for good with 11 minutes to go, Joe Montana and the San 
Francisco 49ers had 11 offensive possessions in Super Bowl XXIV. On eight of 
those possessions -- including four in a row in the second half -- they scored 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
The three times the 49ers punted, they did so without getting a first down. 
Each time they started a drive with a first down, they ended it with a 
touchdown. A textbook example of no wasted effort, no wasted opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
But then, the 49ers are a textbook example of how to turn 45 individuals -- 
only two of whom are shoo-ins to make the Hall of Fame -- into an awesome 
football machine. 
</P>
<P>
And they never stop refining it. Even when it comes to the crown jewel. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1988 season, which the 49ers capped by winning Super Bowl XXIII, 
Montana threw only 11 interceptions in 487 passing attempts, a criminally low 
2.3% interception ratio. 
</P>
<P>
Almost impossible to improve on, right? The key word here is almost. In the 
off-season, 49ers coaches watched film of every pass Montana threw in 1988, 
noted his tendency to be slightly more interception-prone on certain pass 
patterns, and eliminated those routes from the 1989 playbook. 
</P>
<P>
The result? Montana threw only eight interceptions in 443 attempts this season, 
an interception ratio of 1.8%. The best just got better. 
</P>
<P>
If only assessing Montana's and the 49ers place in history were so clear-cut, 
so easy. But if it were, what would fans argue about? 
</P>
<P>
The sweat was barely dry on their uniforms after the most lopsided (55-10) 
victory in Super Bowl history when some were already downgrading the 49ers 
place in NFL history, despite their four Super Bowl wins in as many 
appearances, a mark matched only by the Pittsburgh Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
It is hardly the 49ers' fault that none of their American Football Conference 
Super Bowl opponents were A Team For The Ages, but it's true. Twice the 49ers 
beat the Cincinnati Bengals in very close games in Super Bowl XVI and XXIII, 
but neither of those Bengals teams were marked for greatness. The same with the 
Dan Marino-led, defenseless Miami Dolphins the 49ers flattened in Super Bowl 
XIX, or the pathetic Denver Broncos the 49ers humiliated Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
But the Steelers were revered almost as much for who they beat as who they 
were. In Super Bowl IX, they beat the Minnesota Vikings with Fran Tarkenton and 
a superb Purple People Eaters defense led by Carl Eller, Alan Page and Jim 
Marshall. In Super Bowl X they beat a Dallas Cowboys team quarterbacked by 
Roger Staubach and led on defense by Ed "Too Tall" Jones, Randy White and 
Harvey Martin. 
</P>
<P>
In Super Bowl XIII, they beat a defending Super Bowl champion Cowboys team that 
had added Tony Dorsett. So what if the Vince Ferragamo-Wendell Tyler-Jack 
Youngblood-Fred Dryer Rams the Steelers beat in Super Bowl XIV were no great 
shakes. Those Rams were probably as good as any Super Bowl opponent the 49ers 
have faced. 
</P>
<P>
The other rap against the 49ers is they are not so much great players as they 
are products of a great system. The 49ers have won four of the past nine Super 
Bowls, yet who from their defense will make the Hall of Fame? Possibly safety 
Ronnie Lott, and that's it. From their offense, Montana is a lock, and so, if 
he keeps it up a few more seasons, is Jerry Rice. You can hold off on that new 
construction in Canton, Ohio. The 49ers won't need their own wing. 
</P>
<P>
Rice and Montana are the 49ers' best, but is Rice any better than Hall of Fame 
Steeler receivers John Stallworth and Lynn Swann? Is Montana that much better 
than Terry Bradshaw? And does anyone think Roger Craig is as good as Franco 
Harris? 
</P>
<P>
On defense, it isn't even close. Hall of Famers Jack Lambert and Jack Ham are 
two of the greatest linebackers in history, and they played next to each other 
on the Steelers. Hall of Fame defensive tackle Mean Joe Greene is much better 
than any 49ers defensive lineman, and Dwight White and L.C. Greenwood aren't 
far behind. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers' lack of superstars gives credence that credit goes more to Bill 
Walsh's system than it does 49ers players. Walsh's system, based on a multiple 
receivers, low-risk short passing game that overloads anything but perfect 
defense, has worn much better than Walsh's abrasive personality. 
</P>
<P>
The greatest service Walsh rendered to the 49ers in their successful bid to 
repeat as Super Bowl champion was to leave them after Super Bowl XXIII, leaving 
his brilliant system in the hands of bright, Walsh-trained assistants. This 
season proved that while Walsh and some of the tension his personality fostered 
may have outlived its usefulness, his system certainly had not. The 49ers may 
have been directed by George Seifert this season, but it was Walsh who had 
authored the book and the screenplay. In Hollywood, he would be owed residuals. 
</P>
<P>
Therein lies the problem when it comes to rating the 49ers in general and 
Montana in particular. In baseball, there would be no denying Sandy Koufax's 
supremacy, no matter who he pitched for. In basketball, there is no denying 
Magic Johnson's supremacy. A diamond gleams wherever it is displayed. 
</P>
<P>
But comparisons are so much trickier in football, because football is the 
ultimate team game. A quarterback who flourishes in one system might not fare 
so well in another. Could you imagine Johnny Unitas or Joe Namath dropping a 
certain pass out of the playbook for fear it would be intercepted? Montana did 
it without complaint, because he is the product of a system, and the system 
works. 
</P>
<P>
You can say that Montana is the greatest quarterback of all-time, and people 
will argue that Walsh's system and, to a lesser extent, NFL rule changes in the 
1970s that opened up the passing game have made it so. You can argue Montana 
vs. Unitas or Otto Graham or Slinging Sammy Baugh all night. 
</P>
<P>
But here's one thing you can't argue: Even if you made all the all-time greats 
forever young again, nobody could have stepped into the 49ers offense and run 
it any better, or been as awesomely effective in big games, as Joe Montana has. 
It's simply not possible.

BRONCOS GO NOWHERE IF THE PLAYOFFS ARE SEEDED

The National Football League playoffs should have been seeded: 1. San Francisco 
49ers, 2. Los Angeles Rams, 3. New York Giants, 4. Minnesota Vikings, 5. 
Philadelphia Eagles, 6. Denver Broncos, 7. Cleveland Browns, 8. Buffalo Bills, 
9. Houston Oilers, 10. Pittsburgh Steelers. Denver, as no better than the sixth 
best in the 10-team field, wouldn't have made the semifinals if form held true. 
</P>
<P>
With all due respect to Byrum Saam, who did baseball for 38 years in 
Philadelphia and goes into the broadcasters' wing of the Hall of Fame this 
summer, he was no Chuck Thompson, and Chuck still has his rather prominent 
proboscis pressed against the window. 
</P>
<P>
OK, if you must know, my "greatest" quarterback is Harry Agganis. And as far as 
all the accolades being heaped on the 49ers are concerned, when they have 
produced back-to-back unbeaten seasons like the Canton Bulldogs did, I'll 
concur. 
</P>
<P>
It was on Nov. 22 that Kirby Puckett became the first $3 million-a-year 
ballplayer. And despite a half-dozen guys signing for more since, Kirby has not 
demanded his contract be renegotiated. Quite a guy. 
</P>
<P>
Earl Weaver reached a personal milestone in decorum while managing in the 
Seniors League in Florida: He grabbed and tossed an umpire's hat into the 
stands while arguing his ejection. "Never happened during the 96 times I was 
tossed out in the major leagues," he said proudly. 
</P>
<P>
It was during the recent Vinny Pazienza-Eddie Van Kirk fight in Providence, 
R.I., that Hector Camacho leaped into the ring, grabbed a round card from one 
of the ring girls, bared his chest and pranced around the ring. Yes, the 
Pazienza-Camacho bout in Atlantic City, N.J., Saturday should be a real wowser. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Williams not only changed schools, Maryland to Arizona, he changed 
majors, communication to history. Kid doesn't know what he wants. 
</P>
<P>
Strange sight in Philadelphia the other day: the hulking 10-foot bronze statue 
of "Rocky," jack-hammered out of its moorings at the Spectrum, moving up Broad 
Street on the way to the Museum of Art for filming in "Rocky V." 
</P>
<P>
Gee, a weightlifter failed a drug test at the Commonwealth Games in New 
Zealand, huh? 
</P>
<P>
The Miami Heat is in the running to become only the 11th team in pro hoops 
history to have more victories on the road than at home. The 22-60 Nets of 
1976-77 won just 10 times at the Nassau Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
They don't make Continental Basketball Association all-star games like they 
used to. The score of this year's contest was 107-105. Last year, the lads shot 
the lights out (literally), 182-168. Power in the gym cut off and the teams had 
to return the next day to conclude. 
</P>
<P>
There were 1,162,033 ballots cast in NBA All-Star voting, and Michael Jordan 
came away with just 321,114, less than 28 percent. Is this some sort of joke or 
was Isiah Thomas doing the counting? 
</P>
<P>
Is it possible the NCAA can't see that Nike logo on both the shirts and warmups 
of Georgetown, a clear violation? 
</P>
<P>
The list of the top heavyweights of all-time in a recent Boxing Illustrated 
issue, not done in jest, had Sonny Liston and Larry Holmes 4-5 in front of Jack 
Johnson (6), Jack Dempsey (7) and Rocky Marciano (8). Muhammad Ali, Joe Louis 
and Mike Tyson are 1-2-3. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Montana tosses a three-yard pass over the middle and Jerry Rice runs four 
miles for a score. Yet Joe gets credit for the yardage and his passing 
statistics go through the roof. This is as bad as some of Wilt Chamberlain's 
rebound totals. Time was when no one contested Stilt for missed free throws 
when he was on defense.

ROCKETS STILL HAVEN'T LEFT THE LAUNCH PAD

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To Don Chaney's horror, the Houston Rockets have gone from envisioning a 
championship to plugging holes in a sinking ship. 
</P>
<P>
Mayday: The Rockets are two percentage points ahead of Seattle and one-half 
game behind Golden State in the race for the final spot in the Western 
Conference playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Mayday: The same team Chaney predicted before the season would win 50 games is 
on a pace for 39. 
</P>
<P>
Mayday: Houston is 4-19 on the road after a 98-91 loss at Dallas Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
One of the few victories Chaney got in December, when the Rockets went 3-12, 
was a moral one. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't get any finger-pointing," Chaney said. "And one reason, maybe, is a 
because we all played poorly. You couldn't point without pointing at yourself." 
</P>
<P>
Akeem Olajuwon, who averages 23.3points and leads the league with 13.4rebounds 
and 4.1blocked shots per game, has been one of the few bright spots. But he too 
has been frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
"We know this team cannot win a championship," Olajuwon told a Houston TV 
station last month. "There's no reason deceiving ourselves now because in the 
league you have to play seven-game (playoff) series. There's no luck. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to have the team to win, and it's going to take a lot more to win a 
championship. So we are not close." 
</P>
<P>
An 8-5 record in January has helped calm Olajuwon. But the Rockets played eight 
of those games at home. 
</P>
<P>
"Our championship focus is not on this year," Chaney said. "We're building for 
the future. You can't build and talk about a championship at the same time and 
be very realistic. 
</P>
<P>
"To focus on a championship, you've got to be in the playoffs. Our main focus 
is to get to .500. Then climb above .500. Then get a playoff spot. Then when 
you get in the playoffs, maybe." 
</P>
<P>
During the preseason, however, Chaney said that the Rockets "on paper" had the 
makings of a 50-victory team. The Rockets were coming off a 45-victory season. 
</P>
<P>
They had signed rebounding fiend Larry Smith and playmaker John Lucas as free 
agents. Off-guards Mitchell Wiggins and Lewis Lloyd both were back from 2 
1/2-year drug suspensions. Forwards Otis Thorpe, Buck Johnson and Derrick 
Chievous (average age: 25) would do nothing but improve. 
</P>
<P>
On paper. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we put pressure on ourselves to start out so well," Lucas said. "The 
expectations were so high. It kind of hurt us. We lost a lot of confidence when 
we lost the first game of the season." 
</P>
<P>
The Rockets opened the season Nov. 2 with a 102-88 road defeat to the Los 
Angeles Clippers. Because of a blood clot in his left calf, Olajuwon sat out 
all the exhibition games and was not at full speed at the beginning of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The Rockets were 9-6 entering December. But they lost at home to Dallas and New 
Jersey and on the road to Charlotte. During that stretch, Wiggins sprained his 
left knee and missed 16 games. Smith missed six games with a back injury. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're having those things happen, you have a tendency to feel sorry for 
yourselves," Chaney said. "You let a team like New Jersey beat you, Charlotte 
beat you, and you're at an all-time low. The Clippers had injuries and were 
short of talent, but they had plenty of confidence. They were taking open shots 
and just not making them. This team went out there with their heads down, and 
that scared me." 
</P>
<P>
The Rockets have been unable to provide consistent support for Olajuwon. In the 
last two months, the Rockets lost games in which Olajuwon had point and rebound 
totals of 41 and 14, 32 and 20, 33 and 17, and 34 and 12. 
</P>
<P>
With inconsistent outside shooting, defenses have sagged on Olajuwon and Otis 
Thorpe (16.5 points per game) in the Rockets' half-court offense. 
</P>
<P>
Chaney wants the Rockets to push the ball up the court, but they still rank 
only 19th in the NBA in scoring (103.6 ppg). 
</P>
<P>
"When we're running, we're in games," Chaney said. "When we're standing, we're 
in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Wiggins, 30, has been a pleasant surprise. He averages 19.8points on 
50.7-percent shooting. Before his suspension, he averaged 9.6 points on 
46-percent shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had come back and averaged four or five points a game, people would have 
said, 'Seeing how he he has been out 2 1/2 years, that's about right,' " 
Wiggins said. "Nobody has ever come back like that. It's a lot better than I 
expected." 
</P>
<P>
Wiggins may serve as a reminder that there's always hope. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, the Rockets still have Olajuwon, whom Lucas refers to as "our Joe 
Montana. Without 'The Dream,' we would already be sitting up in New York 
(awaiting the draft lottery) saying, 'Number, please.' "

LOS ALAMITOS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The story sounds familiar, one that is right out of a Bing Crosby vehicle of 
the 1930s or '40s. Going My Way, maybe? 
</P>
<P>
The characters include a young boy who loves animals, horses in particular. 
Then there is the local priest who is presented a horse by a wealthy 
parishioner. Naturally, the beast is uncontrollable until the youngster is 
given the opportunity to care for him. 
</P>
<P>
And the priest takes the kid to the track, yes, the racetrack, and everyone 
lives happily ever after. 
</P>
<P>
Well, in the case of Marc Aubin, it may indeed have been that good father who 
instilled a love for racing horses that hasn't diminished in more than 40 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"We only went once," says Aubin today of that trip to see the trotters and 
pacers in his native Quebec City. Once, in this case, was enough. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Aubin, 56, has established a reputation as one of standardbred (harness) 
racing's finest horsemen. 
</P>
<P>
And after an absence of more than three years, he has returned to Los Alamitos 
with seven horses for the spring meet that continues through April 14. 
</P>
<P>
The reason? That's easy. It's the same one that is pointed to time and time 
again by newcomers competing at Los Alamitos these nights. 
</P>
<P>
"When Lloyd Arnold bought the place, he didn't have to call me about coming 
back. In fact, I called him when I heard the news," says Aubin. "He's an 
excellent promoter and the man for us. 
</P>
<P>
"The outlook for us is better than ever," he enthuses. "I foresee us getting 
back on top again." 
</P>
<P>
The newly-found optimism at Los Alamitos takes different shapes. For instance, 
Aubin has been approached by potential new clients who wish to purchase racing 
stock. And twice he has claimed -- attempted to buy a horse out of a race for a 
stipulated price -- only to lose a "shake" to another claimant. 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, any claim at a Los Alamitos harness meeting was about as 
common as a local summer thunderstorm. 
</P>
<P>
The star of the Aubin shedrow is a three-year-old colt named Tommy Mohawk, who 
won five of seven races in 1989. It is possible the young pacer will compete 
before the Los Alamitos stand concludes, but the main objective is a rich 
series of races for Illinois-breds later in the year at Sportsman's Park, near 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Aubin purchased the colt at a yearling auction for just $3,000. It took 
precisely two minutes -- the time Tommy Mohawk required to record a win in his 
first start -- to convince one Chicagoan to offer Aubin $150,000 for the horse. 
There was no deal, and the colt will carry a rich reputation into action this 
year under Aubin's direction. 
</P>
<P>
That early trip to the races with the priest and his affinity for horses 
notwithstanding, the racing bug didn't bite Aubin right away. This is not the 
story of a kid who hung around the track. Instead, he opted to join the 
Canadian Air Force while still in his teens and remained there for 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
Aubin stayed close to horses whenever possible while in the service. He showed 
horses for friends at county fairs, but his career path was determined during 
another eventful trip to the racetrack. 
</P>
<P>
"There was an old man, trying to sell a mare," he recalls. "I bought her and 
was on my way." 
</P>
<P>
The racing newcomer obtained his driving and training licenses and began 
competing in the sulky world of the mid-1960s -- in Quebec during the summer 
and Montreal during the spring and fall. 
</P>
<P>
Aubin crossed the border into the United States for good in 1971, traveling to 
Florida, Michigan and Chicago with noted horsemen Billy Haughton and Henri 
Filion. 
</P>
<P>
Striking out on his own, he came West in 1972 and his red, white and blue 
colors were a Southern California staple for more than a dozen seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Of the many fine pacers and trotters campaigned by Aubin over the years here, 
he calls Spry Sam the best. Another pacer, La Valaise, also was double-tough 
against invitational stock, the best horses competing at the track. 
</P>
<P>
But hard times hit the sulky industry in Southern California and Aubin left in 
1986. "I just couldn't make a living here," he explained, and back to Chicago 
and other environs he went, seeking a year-around schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Now, plans call for him to split time between California and Illinois. After 
the current meet ends, he'll take his stock to Maywood Park for about a month, 
"to let the horses acclimate." Then comes a summer assault on Sportsman's Park, 
a five-eighths oval like Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
Then back here for the second harness meeting, scheduled to begin in 
mid-August. Hopefully by then Tommy Mohawk really will have made a name for 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
Aubin has started something of a family tradition in the game. Son Matt works 
alongside his father while brother Gene and his son John toil for competing 
barns here. Marc's wife Kimberly edits an Illinois standardbred magazine and 
has her own trotter, which she drives in competition. 
</P>
<P>
Those patriotic colors keep turning up in the bike, and as long as harness 
racing thrives somewhere, fans figure to be seeing them for some time yet.

THEY'RE BELIEVING IN THE LEAFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
These days in Toronto they're talking about reviving the tradition of the Maple 
Leafs, one of the NHL's proudest franchises. 
</P>
<P>
On the ice, the Maple Leafs are doing it more directly: They're winning games 
with one of the most dramatic one-year turnarounds in league history. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess everybody is surprised but us," says Gary Leeman, the Maple Leaf right 
wing who is in the middle of the resurgence. "We always knew we had a lot of 
talent. We've got so much confidence right now, we feel we can win every game." 
</P>
<P>
The muscular Maple Leafs haven't backed down from many this season -- quite a 
change for a team that had lapsed into a 10-year losing streak. This is a team 
that virtually wrote off the eighties. That's when the Maple Leafs became 
widely known as the "Maple Laughs" or the "Make Beliefs", finishing with the 
overall 20th record in the league and giving up the most goals for the decade. 
</P>
<P>
They're still giving up a lot of goals -- but they're scoring more, too, with 
one of the league's most potent offensives. At the All-Star break, they led the 
NHL in that department. 
</P>
<P>
"We do get into the firewagon style some nights," said coach Doug Carpenter. 
"But what am I going to do -- restrict my players' assets?" 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter, a refugee from the New Jersey Devils, is generally regarded as a 
defensive coach, as are his assistants. But you'd never know it by the Maple 
Leafs' high-powered offensive style. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, offense is our strength," Leeman said, "and we've never been told 
not to play offense. But I think we can play better defensively when we have 
to. I think we'll be able to adjust to it, because we've been able to adjust to 
different styles of play so far -- a rough game or a fast game. 
</P>
<P>
"We seem to have different characteristics that make this team happen." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Maple Leafs didn't happen at all. They finished out of the 
playoffs with a 28-46-6 record, which was a distant 20th in the league. 
</P>
<P>
This year, they not only have a legitimate shot at a playoff berth but also 
first place in the Norris Division and a chance to break the team record for 
most wins in a season (41). After their first 51 games, they had a 27-23-1 
record and could finish a season above .500 for the first time since 1978-79. 
</P>
<P>
"There seems to be stability and we have a coach who knows his game," veteran 
left wing Mark Osborne said. "Carpenter coming here was a big thing. He knows 
hockey. A lot of us are impressed. 
</P>
<P>
"He comes into each game and practice really prepared. He has everybody playing 
within themselves. We're playing sound, systematic hockey and each player has a 
defined role. For the first time since I've been here, there is a positive 
approach to getting the most out of the team and getting the players to play to 
their best abilities." 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter, who coached for nearly four years in New Jersey before taking over 
the Maple Leafs this year, wasn't the only fresh breeze in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Maple Leaf owner Harold Ballard, before his recent illness, hired Floyd Smith, 
a former Toronto player, as general manager and approved changes such as the 
appointment of a captain -- Rob Ramage. The moves helped bring a sense of 
respect to the team and a sense of passion to Maple Leaf Gardens that had been 
absent since the glory years of the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
The Maple Leafs have 13 Stanley Cup championships to their credit, second only 
to the Montreal Canadiens, but none since 1967. 
</P>
<P>
Ramage, along with Lou Franceschetti, are among recently-acquired players who 
are generally credited with adding elan to the Maple Leafs. Brad Marsh, who 
came over from Philadelphia last year, is another one. 
</P>
<P>
"These people are all from organizations that were team-oriented," Carpenter 
said. "Ramage played in Calgary, Marsh in Philadelphia, Franceschetti in 
Washington. These people have really added character." 
</P>
<P>
And physical presence. Franceschetti, especially, has given the Maple Leafs the 
kind of hitting that has long been absent from their game. 
</P>
<P>
"Franceschetti," said Carpenter, "has been superb, a real spark." 
</P>
<P>
Osborne said the newcomers have nurtured a strong team atmosphere and a Three 
Musketeers mentally. 
</P>
<P>
"The leadership of some of the older players has put pride back into the 
dressing room," Osborne said. "Rob has demanded respect -- and he's gotten it. 
We've had some sour apples pulling in the wrong direction, but they've brought 
them over to their side." 
</P>
<P>
With Ballard critically ill in a hospital, a board of directors is running the 
team these days. They've given carte blanche to Smith and Carpenter. Off the 
ice, they're trying to recapture some of the old team pride which Ballard had 
slowly stripped away over the years. 
</P>
<P>
If anything, Ballard was never accused of sentimentality. Outspoken and 
sometimes irreverent and profane, Ballard consistently flew in the face of 
tradition since taking over controlling interest in the hockey club in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
Showing little regard for history, Ballard didn't see any reason to have any of 
the team's Stanley Cup flags hanging in Maple Leaf Gardens, or for some of the 
old photographs to hang in the Gardens' hallowed halls. 
</P>
<P>
He was vindictive enough to rip some photos off the wall when they included 
players he didn't get along with -- such as Darryl Sittler, a Hall of Famer who 
was one of the most popular in Maple Leafs' history. 
</P>
<P>
But now with Ballard out of touch, the board of directors has decided to bring 
back some memories, including those championship banners. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going ahead with the banners," said board chairman Paul McNamara. "We've 
heard from a few companies that make them." 
</P>
<P>
The board of directors has also decided that some restoration is in order. 
Board members have decided to start an alumni club for former players, put in a 
game room for them in Maple Leaf Gardens and make improvements in the dingy 
wives' lounge for players. 
</P>
<P>
These improvements have just happened to coincide with the improvements of the 
current team on the ice. 
</P>
<P>
And winning has made it all the sweeter for Al Iafrate, one of the NHL's top, 
young defensemen. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to be frustrating going to the rink," Iafrate said. "Even if we won, 
they used to say we were lucky. Now the fans are rallying behind us, and they 
think we can win every game." 
</P>
<P>
More importantly, so do the Maple Leafs themselves.

DAVIS SEES HIS DREAM SLIP AWAY; 
</P>
<P>
SOCCER: HE WAS ONCE AMERICA'S FINEST PLAYER. NOW, AT THE AGE OF 31, HE'S 
RECOVERING FROM A KNEE INJURY, HOPING TO MAKE THE WORLD CUP TEAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Rick Davis was 6, he got his first look at soccer -- a closed-circuit 
showing of the 1966 World Cup final. 
</P>
<P>
From that moment on, Davis dreamed of the United States playing in the World 
Cup -- with him leading the way. 
</P>
<P>
Now with half of his dream completed, Davis may never get to see the second 
part of his vision fulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
At 31, Davis is trying to return from a knee injury which at first seemed minor 
but has required three operations in less than nine months. It has kept him out 
of soccer for more than a year and likely will keep him out of the one thing he 
has dedicated his life to -- the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
"I look at Ricky and the guy's done everything in the game in America," said 
teammate and friend Brent Goulet. "And it would be a shame if someone like him 
couldn't play in the World Cup. But that's the reality of it, you never know 
what's going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Davis played on the U.S. youth national teams and by 18 was playing in the 
North American Soccer League with the Cosmos next to international superstars 
Pele, Franz Beckenbauer and Giorgio Chinaglia. 
</P>
<P>
Not much later he was named captain of the U.S. national team and kept that 
title for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Davis has scored more goals (nine) and played in more full internationals (43) 
than any player in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
But all that means is he's been around a long time and now he's getting old. 
</P>
<P>
Davis' last appearance with the U.S. team was in September 1988, at the 
Olympics in South Korea, where he captained the squad to a respectable 0-1-2 
showing. 
</P>
<P>
Three months later at his daughter's grammar school near their home in the 
Seattle area, Davis was teaching a gym class. During a stretching exercise he 
felt a pinch in his right knee. 
</P>
<P>
Two days before Christmas he had arthroscopic surgery to repair a slight 
cartilage tear. He missed the United States' appearance at the first FIFA 
indoor tournament in January but was expected to make the U.S. team's training 
camp in late January. 
</P>
<P>
But the knee kept swelling. On March 1, he had more surgery, but still the knee 
wouldn't heal. On August 21, he had to have a third operation, all the while 
missing eight crucial World Cup qualifying games. 
</P>
<P>
Now, after captaining the United States for 10 years, he is fighting for one of 
22 spots to go to Italy in June for the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
"What Rick is trying to do is going to be extremely difficult," said U.S. Coach 
Bob Gansler, who will make the roster decision. "You just can't put the game 
aside for a year and half and now in a couple of months get it back to a level 
where you can play on the national team. 
</P>
<P>
"As I told him, certainly my heart says, 'Go for it, and pursue your dream.' 
But my mind says, 'This is going to be extremely, extremely difficult.' It is 
possible? Yes. Is it probable? No." 
</P>
<P>
Davis had been training on his own and wasn't invited to the team's early 
January or current training camps, the first since the qualifying victory over 
Trinidad and Tobago in November that put the United States in the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Gansler) explained that he needs me to be training in a regular training 
environment and playing some games before he wants to bring me in to work out 
with the team and see about the possibility of me rejoining the team," Davis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Having not played with a club since the 1987-88 season, when he played with the 
Tacoma Stars of the Major Indoor Soccer League, Davis had to find a new team. 
</P>
<P>
An outdoor club would have been best, but the U.S. outdoor leagues don't start 
training until March. 
</P>
<P>
He had several offers to train with teams abroad, but with three small children 
and his wife expecting a fourth, Davis had no interest in leaving the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 10, he signed a contract with the Stars to play indoors. 
</P>
<P>
"I realize that the MISL, as told to me by Bob Gansler, is not the ideal 
solution," Davis said. "It's not outdoor soccer and it's not the ideal 
preparation." 
</P>
<P>
Still Davis plays with Tacoma hoping to get an invitation to one of the four 
remaining U.S. team training camps scheduled between now and April. 
</P>
<P>
Davis' dream may not only be frustrating, it will be costly. Sources have said 
that because of the MISL's salary cap, Davis' contract from Jan. 10 to Jan. 25 
was for $1. From Jan. 25 to Feb. 25 it will be for another $1. And for the two 
to three months the season continues, he will make the league minimum $2,500 
per month. 
</P>
<P>
Since joining Tacoma, the knee has done "pretty well," Davis said. "Better than 
I thought it was going to. At this point I feel like I'm, I guess about as 
recovered as I'm going to be. I feel great. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not getting any reactions at all. It doesn't swell. It doesn't bother me. 
I get up in the morning on cold days and it aches a little, but so does just 
about every other joint in my body." 
</P>
<P>
But nothing matches the ache inside when he thinks of missing the World Cup. He 
couldn't bear to watch the team play during qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
"There isn't anything verbally that I could say that I think anybody would 
understand," Davis said. "The emotions were so powerful and so strong within me 
and yet so opposite of one another. It's the epitome of being pulled in 
opposite directions." 
</P>
<P>
Davis still believes he can help the U.S. team, but a spot for old times' sake 
will not be forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot choose this squad using sentimentality as a criterion," Ganlser said. 
"It's got to be who can produce. Who can augment the squad we already have. Who 
can make us a better team." 
</P>
<P>
Davis may know if it's time to step back by spring. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have a timetable, but he (Ganlser) must," Davis said. "I would say as 
a deadline I would look at April as being about the last time that I might be 
willing as a coach to bring in people." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his competitive urge, Davis realizes after 13 years as a professional, 
the end is near.

THE HOUSE THAT BRET BUILT; 
</P>
<P>
CEREMONY: THE ENCINO FIELD WHERE CY YOUNG AWARD WINNER SABERHAGEN PLAYED BALL 
AS A YOUTH IS BEING DEDICATED TO HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH TOSCHES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a cold and stormy Saturday morning early in February of 1973, a skinny 
8-year-old named Bret Saberhagen strolled confidently onto a Little League 
diamond in Encino and, with nearly 200 other youngsters and dozens of adults 
peering on in utter amazement, proceeded to put on a baseball clinic. 
</P>
<P>
The clinic was divided into four segments: 
</P>
<P>
How to field ground balls like a blind man. In this drill, the boy had someone 
hit four grounders to him at shortstop. He missed all four, although witnesses 
recall that on one he nearly got close enough to have touched the ball with a 
10-foot pole, which, unfortunately, he did not have with him. The other three 
he missed badly. 
</P>
<P>
Playing first base like a hockey goalie. In this demonstration, the kid showed 
the crowd -- which at this point was absolutely spellbound -- that because 
actually catching a thrown baseball was far too difficult even to imagine, 
knocking it down or deflecting it was enough. He repeatedly showed his 
technique of allowing the fast-moving sphere to strike one or more parts of his 
body before it fell harmlessly to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
How to throw a baseball as if it were an accident. In this display of skill, 
the kid moved back to shortstop and began throwing balls with uncanny accuracy 
at unconventional targets, connecting repeatedly with the dirt 20 feet in front 
of first base and another spot 15 feet up the chain-link fence behind first 
base. Some of the spectators, apparently bored with this drill, left quickly 
and returned to their vehicles, where they lunged inside, rolled up the windows 
and dived onto the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Treating fly balls as if they were live hand grenades. In this segment, the 
youngster went to the outfield and began darting away from high-arcing 
baseballs. He easily eluded the first three, but on the fourth attempt he 
apparently misjudged the flight of the ball and it landed smack in the middle 
of his glove. Fortunately, it did not go off. 
</P>
<P>
The onlookers were gasping. 
</P>
<P>
"It was terrible," said Little League baseball coach Mike Morris of Reseda, who 
witnessed the entire show. "He was the lousiest player of the day. It was just 
terrible." 
</P>
<P>
Today at noon, almost 17 years to the day after he brought his Larry, Curly and 
Moe Baseball Clinic to Encino, Saberhagen -- now a 25-year-old man -- will 
return to the same field. 
</P>
<P>
And, in an elaborate ceremony, the field at Oxnard Street and Louise Avenue 
will be dedicated to him and will be named in his honor. 
</P>
<P>
By whom, you might ask -- the Red Cross? 
</P>
<P>
No. Saberhagen, the two-time Cy Young Award winner of the Kansas City Royals 
and inarguably one of the top pitchers in the major leagues, will be honored by 
the Mid-Valley Baseball Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"That day was just a bad day," Saberhagen explained Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed. 
</P>
<P>
Of the nearly 200 boys who attended that Little League tryout, Saberhagen was 
chosen last by the coaches who had gathered to scout the players. He lost out 
at a chance to be picked next-to-last when two coaches flipped a coin and the 
winner took the other kid. 
</P>
<P>
The day was, however, a fluke. Saberhagen was already, at age 8, a solid 
baseball player. He was so good, in fact, that adults had been telling him just 
how good he was. And he believed them. So he stopped practicing. In one winter 
of non-use, his young skills had rusted. 
</P>
<P>
He became the star on that Little League team in 1973 and continued to be the 
standout on every team he played on, including those at Cleveland High. 
</P>
<P>
The trend has continued into adulthood. His 1989 Cy Young Award as the American 
League's best pitcher will sit beside his 1985 Cy Young Award. 
</P>
<P>
"By the time he was 10 and 11, he was way above everybody else on his team," 
said Jack Jackson of Reseda, another coach who guided Saberhagen's early 
career. "He was just an exceptional player, as a shortstop and as a pitcher. He 
was really something special to watch, even back then." 
</P>
<P>
That horrible February day in the drizzle might have been the best thing that 
could have happened to Saberhagen. 
</P>
<P>
"For months leading up to that Little League season, I asked Bret if he wanted 
to practice," said his mother, Linda, who was a main force in her son's 
baseball life after a separation from her husband when Bret was 5. 
</P>
<P>
"But he didn't want any part of practicing. He told me, 'Mom, I don't have to 
practice. I'm good enough that I don't have to. Everyone tells me that.' 
</P>
<P>
"On the way home after that tryout, Bret cried. He said he hated baseball and 
that he would never play baseball again." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for American League batters who spend much of their time trying 
to get even a small chunk of his sizzling fastball or snapping curve, 
Saberhagen was persuaded by his mother to give it another chance. 
</P>
<P>
And the embarrassing lesson that Saberhagen learned stays with him today. 
</P>
<P>
"I use that story a lot when I talk to kids," he said. "I learned that even if 
you have some talent for something, you can't just walk in and expect to be 
good at it. I mean, I couldn't throw a single ball to first base that day. I 
knew my capabilities. I knew I could play as well as anyone else. But I didn't 
work at it. 
</P>
<P>
"From that day on, I realized that I couldn't coast. If you want something, you 
have to work for it." 
</P>
<P>
And work he did. Within days, a tire hung from a tree in the family's back yard 
and a crude pitcher's mound was marked off 60 feet, 6 inches away. And within a 
couple of years, that 13-inch tire might as well have been a hula hoop as the 
kid began buzzing strikes through the center. 
</P>
<P>
Saberhagen's father found out the expensive way that his son had been 
practicing. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to have bets," Bob Saberhagen said. "We'd each throw 10 baseballs. 
Each one through the tire was worth a quarter. We'd throw all day long. One 
day, when he was 10 years old -- and remember, I was a healthy 35-year-old man 
-- he won $60 from me. Sixty dollars! 
</P>
<P>
"That was the day we stopped playing that game."

Antelope Valley lost an eight-point lead in the final eight minutes of 
regulation play but came back to take a 66-60 overtime victory over Desert in a 
women's Foothill Conference basketball game Saturday at Paraclete High. 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley's Denese Prince sank a free throw with 35 seconds remaining to 
send the game into overtime. Sophomore forward Molly Jonnum (20 points and 13 
rebounds) scored six points in the overtime period. 
</P>
<P>
With the win, Antelope Valley (13-10, 8-1 in conference play) improved its 
hopes for a conference title, pulling even with Desert (17-6, 8-1) for first

CLU RENEWS TALKS WITH SHOUP

<P>
Cal Lutheran has renewed negotiations for a settlement with fired football 
Coach Bob Shoup in an effort to avert a lawsuit, a member of the university's 
board of regents said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Shoup has rejected previous proposals, including one that would have paid him 
$183,000 as a buyout of his contract, and instead filed a grievance that 
claimed he held tenure as a coach as well as a faculty member. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 23, the regents' executive committee upheld a faculty decision denying 
the grievance. A meeting of the regents is scheduled Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"The executive committee wants to avoid a lawsuit," said Jim Tyner, a CLU 
regent. "I know that people at the school would very much like to get this 
resolved before the regents' meeting Friday." 
</P>
<P>
Shoup said that he is not personally participating in the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no agreement or anything close to an agreement from what I 
understand," he said. BRENDAN HEALEY

<TEXT>
<P>
When I was in elementary school, Luther Burbank Elementary in Altadena, I was 
taught that this great country of ours was a melting pot. For the last 40 
years, I have thought the meaning of that was that people from many different 
countries came to the United States, became united in their beliefs, and also 
united in their language. 
</P>
<P>
My grandfather, who is now 97 years old, was one of those people who came here, 
or rather escaped to this country, and learned to speak the English language. 
He was not babied and coddled in school; they did not speak to him in his 
native Armenian. Perhaps if they did he would not have learned to speak English 
so well. 
</P>
<P>
I have my children in a private school. The main reason: I do not want them to 
have an inferior education. I feel that by going to a bilingual school they 
would have just that. I don't enjoy paying a hefty tuition, in addition to 
taxes that support my local school. I feel I am being wronged much more than 
Mrs. Quezada and her students.

A major problem in the U.S. today is that so few people are willing to suffer 
anything painful, so we tolerate taking drugs, "dumbing down" our education, 
and, in general, making ourselves weaker and weaker. 
</P>
<P>
Although Leticia Quezada suffered pain having to learn English in our schools, 
the fact is that it made her a stronger, more successful person. 
</P>
<P>
What is her complaint about the way she turned out? If she really cared about 
immigrant children and their future in this country, she'd say to them, "Sure, 
I know it's painful, but you can do it, and in the long run, you'll be better 
off."

WHEN 'JAVA JOINTS' WERE DIME A DOZEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I don't know how long Kevin Allman's been around Los Angeles, but coffee houses 
(not shops) were plentiful as weeds in the '60s ("Java Joints," Jan. 28). 
</P>
<P>
There were at least two in one block at one time on the strip. They were like 
bat caves, with games and weird art and everything the current ones offer. 
Granted, the music was more of the "We Shall Overcome" variety. 
</P>
<P>
It's fascinating how each batch of young people think they invented coffee 
houses. I expect they'll be around forever.

NOT IMPRESSED WITH THE 'DESIGNER-DRESSED' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have just finished reading Jeannine Stein's article of Jan. 21, titled 
"Designer-Dressed to Impress." 
</P>
<P>
In this age of conspicuous consumption, I don't know when I have ever been so 
disillusioned and disgusted by an article. 
</P>
<P>
Those women who are so active in raising money for the arts and many other 
charities are the very people who set the worst examples for the children of 
today. No wonder children are killing each other for designer label shoes and 
clothes.

ZAN THOMPSON: MOVE TO THE DESERT WAS FOR THE DOGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN THOMPSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I haven't told you this before because I am not sure that Peaches can't read. 
Peaches is my small dog, named for her color, that of a juicy summer peach. She 
is what is called a mixed breed. You cannot call her a mutt or a mongrel 
because she is far too refined. 
</P>
<P>
There was talk when I picked her up from a floor full of puffballs the same 
color that her mother had been a bichon frise and her father a runner for a 
bookie. The bichon frise is a small white dog with the long hair covering its 
ears in the style of Elizabeth Barrett Browning. They're often pictured on the 
laps of elegantly gowned court ladies of the 16th and 17th centuries. 
</P>
<P>
I have just about given up the idea of the bichon frise mother, even though I 
was assured of this by the dog groomer who called me when he fell heir to the 
litter. He knew that my beloved schnauzer had died and that I would take 
anything with fur and a tail. 
</P>
<P>
Peaches has been a successful dog and, to my stunned surprise, her medical 
records show that she is 9 years old. That means the move to the desert was as 
hard on her as it was on me. She hated moving. 
</P>
<P>
First we stayed with Jean Erck, and Peaches soon enjoyed it. She liked, 
especially, the silk velvet Oriental rugs and the velvet-covered couch. She 
does like a touch or two of elegance around her. This is not a dog who would 
happily curl up on a gunnysack. 
</P>
<P>
To my intense relief, she did not commit a gross social error during our 
three-month encampment -- and this in spite of the fact that she was used to 
having a dog door in Pasadena so she could come and go at will. 
</P>
<P>
Jean has a patio area that adjoins her sliding glass door, and then there is a 
generous strip of verdant lawn between the patio and the fence surrounding one 
of the La Quinta golf courses. 
</P>
<P>
She also has an excellent knack for suggesting just the right moment for 
Peaches to leave the room. Jean will say, "Come on, Peaches, let's go," in a 
bubbly voice suggesting that they are going to do something wonderful. Peaches 
happily trots behind her and accomplishes the mission. 
</P>
<P>
When our house was finally ready, Peaches and I moved into the dirt. The back 
yard is a paved patio area and plain dirt. Peaches went outside and turned 
smartly around and came back in. She looked at me as if I were out of my mind 
to even suggest attending to her personal needs in this place. 
</P>
<P>
My friend Walt Wagner installed a dog door and Peaches bit him when he tried to 
encourage her through. It is the first time she has ever bitten anyone. She bit 
me, too. In a couple of days, she was going in and out of the dog door, with 
her shoulders slumped and her attitude poor. 
</P>
<P>
During this period, we went to call on Jean and Peaches happily followed Jean 
out on to the nice, fresh, green grass. 
</P>
<P>
One evening, we were out when the wind was blowing straight down from the 
snow-topped mountains, and it was even hard to stand up. Peaches refused to get 
in the car with me, shattering what little faith I had left in my judgment for 
having moved. 
</P>
<P>
But, now all is well, although Peaches still thinks we were ill-advised to 
leave Jean's beautiful house. 
</P>
<P>
Now, I have grass in the front, applied in squares like big green crackers. I'm 
thinking of having some put in the back yard, at least in one corner. I think 
Peaches might accept that, although I still think it's Jean's party voice that 
does the trick.

LANDMARK WHITTIER THEATER TO BE SOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
WHITTIER 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The owner of the rundown Whittier Theater is selling out because he is tired of 
fighting with the city and conservationists over the fate of the Depression-era 
landmark, according to an associate. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Doerkin will put the theater up for sale this week, making way for a 
buyer to either restore or demolish it, said Don Gerstein, an executive and 
spokesman for Doerkin Properties Inc. of Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
"We're tired of dealing with Whittier," Gerstein said. "We're going to put our 
tail between our legs and go on to something else." 
</P>
<P>
Gerstein would not disclose how much Doerkin is asking for the theater, which 
he purchased for about $1.1 million from the Pacific Theater chain in 1987. "We 
are not asking an excessive amount," Gerstein said. "We want enough to recover 
our costs." 
</P>
<P>
The historic film palace at Hadley Avenue and Whittier Boulevard has been at 
the center of debate since before the Oct. 1, 1987, earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
When Doerkin purchased the theater in June, 1987, he told the council he was 
going to restore it and convert it to a performing arts center. But several 
months later, he asked the city for permission to replace the theater with a 
$14-million shopping plaza because, he said, fixing up the theater would be a 
losing proposition. 
</P>
<P>
The council had not yet acted on Doerkin's request when the 5.9-magnitude 
earthquake rocked the area in October, 1987, severely damaging the historic 
building. 
</P>
<P>
City building inspectors ordered that the theater be demolished because they 
said the earthquake had made it unsafe. A wrecking crew worked on the theater 
for about 45 minutes in November, 1987, before lawyers for the Whittier 
Conservancy -- which had successfully argued in court that the city had to 
obtain an environmental impact report before razing the theater -- arrived with 
a restraining order to stop the destruction. 
</P>
<P>
The city completed the environmental impact report in October and voted to tear 
the theater down because no one wanted to restore it. The conservationists 
vowed to stop the city's wrecking ball and asked the court not to lift the 
restraining order. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Doerkin is loosing $15,000 a month on the theater while waiting for 
the fight to end, Gerstein said. 
</P>
<P>
He asked the Los Angeles Conservancy to help find a buyer for the theater. So 
far, a few people have expressed interest, Gerstein said. 
</P>
<P>
Helen Rahder, spokeswoman for the Whittier Conservancy, said local 
preservationists also are scrambling to find a buyer. 
</P>
<P>
"This opens a whole range of possibilities," Rahder said. "This is a viable 
piece of property that could be restored." 
</P>
<P>
But City Manager Tom Mauk was less optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
"It (Doerkin's decision to sell) does not make any difference," Mauk said. "The 
place is a mess and it needs to be demolished. Anyone who considers buying it 
is going to have his hands full."

GANG ATTIRE WEARING THIN AT AREA SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE HAMILTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Baseball caps are forbidden at some schools. At others, caps are OK but 
bandannas are out. Then there's the junior high school where boys can't wear 
earrings. 
</P>
<P>
Confusing? Perhaps, but necessary, say educators in the San Gabriel Valley, who 
increasingly are joining their urban counterparts in drawing up dress codes to 
keep gangs at bay. 
</P>
<P>
The trend reflects a concern that gangs and gang-related activity are on the 
rise in many San Gabriel Valley school districts. 
</P>
<P>
"This year, gang activity is more than we have seen in the last few years," 
said Stephen Kornfeld, dean of students at San Gabriel High School. 
</P>
<P>
In districts from Pomona to Baldwin Park, the message has gone out to students: 
The wearing of gang-related clothing won't be tolerated. 
</P>
<P>
But what exactly qualifies as gang-related? The list varies from school to 
school and from gang to gang. And for some youngsters, the clothes may merely 
reflect MTV rap fashion. As lines between fashion and bona fide gang clothing 
blur, some parents appear downright frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
"One mother told me, 'My goodness, I paid $150 for that outfit and my son's not 
a gang member,' " said Pat DeLong, assistant superintendent of educational 
services at the Baldwin Park Unified School District, which adopted a dress 
code nine months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, San Gabriel Valley school administrators say parents support their 
efforts to keep schoolyards free of gangs. Educators usually outline the new 
policies during parent-teacher meetings or in letters that students take home. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, parents are shocked to learn that Johnny's red baseball cap, red 
shoelaces and red T-shirt might signify something ominous. 
</P>
<P>
Other times, parents go through "strong denial" of their children's activities, 
Kornfeld said. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers say they look for certain trends. For instance, a student who wears 
nothing but blue might be trying to show an affiliation with a particular black 
gang. 
</P>
<P>
Both black and Latino gangs favor Los Angeles Raiders jackets and caps. 
</P>
<P>
In years past, Asian youth gangs sported distinctively styled tattoos. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to keep current about what police and other agencies tell us, and we 
watch for students who only wear certain colors or certain combinations of 
clothing," said Judi Wiggins-North, principal of South Hills High School in 
West Covina. 
</P>
<P>
But school officials say they also rely on common sense. An A student on the 
varsity track team who wears all black once every couple of weeks probably 
wouldn't get pulled aside, educators say. On the other hand, known or suspected 
gang members who wear all black on a regular basis might be told to liven up 
their color schemes. Often, the schools work hand in hand with local police 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
Some districts, such as Pomona Unified, have well-defined dress codes that 
spell out a long list of forbidden clothing. 
</P>
<P>
Since November, 1987, Pomona has prohibited scarfs; blue or red farmer 
neckerchiefs; single gloves; sagging, baggy pants, and colored shoelaces, 
according to spokeswoman Nancy York. 
</P>
<P>
Other communities opt for a more narrow focus. Last fall, Monrovia Unified 
banned all hats. The district "doesn't have a severe gang problem . . . but 
felt we needed to take steps before those problems occurred," said Louise 
Taylor, associate superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
But not everyone agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing is just wrong," said Jesse Romero, 17, the student body 
president of Monrovia High School, who launched an unsuccessful attempt to 
fight the ban. 
</P>
<P>
"If something's a clear and present danger, sure they have a right to take away 
anything, but I don't see a clear and present danger," Romero said. "There's 
probably more danger for a student walking to school to get hit by a car than 
someone looking at someone's baseball cap and shooting into the school." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, parents join their children in protest. "It's just ridiculous how 
everything represents something," said Helen Nishijima, who has a son at South 
Hills. "Is the school going to give me money to buy new clothes?" 
</P>
<P>
School officials who attempt to censor what students wear also face accusations 
of discrimination. Edgar Sanchez, 17, a junior at South Hills, said teachers 
zeroed in solely on black students, telling them that certain colors and styles 
were off limits. 
</P>
<P>
"I know of a lot of Caucasians who wear Raiders hats, and they don't get 
anything said to them," Sanchez said. "It's not fair. If you do it for one, you 
should do it for all." 
</P>
<P>
Wiggins-North denied that the school targeted minority students and said that 
all students, regardless of race, are warned about wearing symbolic gang 
clothing, especially if the same outfits show up on a regular basis. 
</P>
<P>
"We ask parents, 'Do you notice he's only wearing blue,' " Wiggins-North said. 
"We ask them to be aware if they are only buying blue clothes." 
</P>
<P>
Teachers say the difficulty of their work is compounded by television, which 
often shows teen idols dressed in attire that could be construed as 
gang-related. 
</P>
<P>
"When they see kids on MTV in gang apparel, they think it looks cool," said 
Baldwin Park's DeLong, who called her job "very difficult." 
</P>
<P>
In DeLong's district, which mainly has Latino gangs, teachers watch for 
students wearing baggy khaki pants several sizes too big or Pendleton shirts 
with only the top button fastened. A color scheme of gray, beige and brown 
could also signify gang membership, DeLong said. 
</P>
<P>
In some districts, the dress codes have even trickled into the junior high 
school level. At Washington Middle School in northwest Pasadena, Principal 
Willis Charles has banned gloves, as well as hats and visors, except on rainy 
days. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, "boys can't wear any earrings," Charles said. "In many instances, 
it can have gang connotations." 
</P>
<P>
Not every school district in the San Gabriel Valley has adopted a dress code. 
Some say they don't need to because they have no gang activity on campus. 
</P>
<P>
"We've not had to deal with that," said Ben Ramirez, the principal at South 
Pasadena High School. 
</P>
<P>
But most educators say gang activity plagues all but the toniest schools, even 
in the suburban San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Said DeLong, of Baldwin Park: "Everybody has gangs of one kind of another; you 
can't go anywhere without seeing them."

The stage looks warm and intimate, with russet wood walls and a piano gleaming 
in a pool of light. In 45 minutes, veteran concert pianist Eugene Istomin will 
walk to the piano and fill the Ambassador Auditorium with nimble-fingered 
trills and runs in a program of Beethoven, Schubert and Chopin. 
</P>

Mark Morris, performance stage manager, gives stage and empty seats a critical 
once-over. "After the concert, this will all be just an empty, hollow space," 
he said. "I'm always amazed at it."

<P>
From the outside, the Ambassador in Pasadena is the Rock of Gibraltar of 
concert halls. Columns, square cornices and a flat half-acre of a roof give it 
a solid, monumental look. But inside the hall, the Ambassador can be as 
changeable as an itinerant swap meet. 
</P>
<P>
In minutes, acoustic panels can be tucked away, banks of curtains hauled into 
place, batteries of spotlights switched on or off, rows of seats added or 
subtracted. 
</P>
<P>
Administering a major concert hall such as the Ambassador, which began a 
cultural boom in Pasadena when it opened in 1974, is a theatrical roller 
coaster. Few handle the curves as well as the Ambassador staff, visiting 
artists have said. 
</P>
<P>
"A fabulous hall, the best that money can buy," flamboyant Yugoslav pianist Ivo 
Pogorelich told an interviewer, "and there's a lot of money in Pasadena." 
</P>
<P>
There are 100 or more events in the hall's nine-month season. Piano soloists 
give way to jazz bands, chamber orchestras follow on the heels of pop singers. 
Each event has its own peculiar staging requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Take the hall's convertible acoustics. The crisp, brilliant sound that the 
Ambassador's house staff has programmed for Istomin's lyrical piano pieces 
won't work for the Toshiko Akiyoshi Jazz Orchestra, the big band scheduled to 
play in the hall the next evening. 
</P>
<P>
"With all of that sound bouncing around the room, it would start coming back to 
the microphones," said Peter Eddington, the Ambassador's technical and lighting 
supervisor. "After a while, it starts sounding like you're in a toilet bowl." 
</P>
<P>
To "deaden" to sound, the Ambassador staff will fold away the teak sidewalls, 
remove the gold-leaf-covered acoustical panels (the "gold clouds") that hang 
above the piano and swath the stage in black curtains. 
</P>
<P>
"With the piano, the hall approaches about two seconds of reverberation time," 
Eddington said. "For a big band, you want to get below one second." 
</P>
<P>
Every Monday morning, the house staff gets together in the orchestra of the 
1,262-seat hall to work out technical requirements for the week's events. 
</P>
<P>
Last week's events began with an opera-in-concert on Monday, complete with 
orchestra, chorus and soloists. That was followed by the Istomin recital on 
Wednesday and the jazz concert on Thursday. The cycle ends tonight with a 
performance by Mummenschanz, the Swiss mime, dance and puppetry troupe. 
</P>
<P>
Each event requires radical restructuring of the Ambassador stage. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday morning, lighting technicians tinker with some spotlights as 
Istomin, a studious-looking man in wire-rimmed glasses, rehearses a Beethoven 
sonata, his fingers ruminatively exploring a dense adagio passage. 
</P>
<P>
The challenge for the concert pianist, Istomin said, is conveying a 
19th-Century composer's intent while performing in a 20th-Century concert hall. 
"All of these pieces were written to be played in a place which was about 
one-quarter the size of this hall," Istomin said. "There are subtleties -- 
perfumes -- that can only be communicated through a kind of stage whisper." 
</P>
<P>
Eddington is gratified to hear Istomin talking about music instead of staging. 
"When he walks onto the stage," Eddington said, "there should be nothing to 
worry about as far as the facility or the crew are concerned. He should only 
worry about the piece of music." 
</P>
<P>
The Ambassador is run by the Ambassador International Cultural Foundation, an 
arm of the Worldwide Church of God. Ambassador College, on whose elegant 
Pasadena campus the concert hall sits, is another arm of the church. The church 
plans to relocate the college later this year to another facility in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
But there's no way that the church would give up this gem, church officials 
say. In just 16 years of operation, the hall brims with musical lore. Here's 
the backstage elevator that was installed ahead of schedule so that Italian 
tenor Luciano Pavarotti wouldn't have to climb the 28 stairs from dressing room 
to stage level. "He said that climbing the stairs would interrupt his breathing 
patterns," Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
An electric eye was subsequently installed in the elevator so Mstislav 
Rostropovich wouldn't worry that his cello would be smashed by the closing 
door. 
</P>
<P>
Here and there are some extraordinary features of the edifice itself, including 
its pinkish lobby walls, from basement to balcony, which used up Turkey's 
entire export quota of rose onyx for a year. 
</P>
<P>
"Even that much wasn't quite enough," Snyder said, pointing to a single 
six-foot panel of grayish marble at the balcony level. 
</P>
<P>
By early evening, the recital shell is in place and lights are set for the 
performance. Istomin arrives, tense and unsmiling in a black tuxedo. He tells 
technicians not to turn on the "bow lights" when he walks on stage. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want any spots on me, none of that show biz stuff," said Istomin, who 
has been performing since 1943. "Make it boring. The glamour should take place 
in the sound." 
</P>
<P>
A warmly appreciative audience, marveling at Istomin's light-fingered facility 
at the keyboard, applauds enthusiastically and demands two encores. As audience 
members trickle away into the night, Morris and three assistants begin to strip 
the stage. 
</P>
<P>
The teak walls, folded up into five panels, are winched toward the ceiling, 60 
feet above the stage. There's a loft full of catwalks and folded equipment up 
there -- a dark, cavernous space hidden from the audience by slatted ceiling 
panels -- that is almost as big as the performance hall itself. 
</P>
<P>
The golden clouds are lowered to the stage, turned on their sides and hauled 
up; the same with banks of lights. Each piece of movable equipment is 
counterbalanced with lead weights, so that stage assistants can move them up or 
down just by pulling on ropes. 
</P>
<P>
In just 41 minutes, the four men have stripped the stage. The next day, rows of 
black curtains would be lowered into place, putting the stage into what is 
called a "theater black" mode, and risers and microphones would be installed 
for the jazz band. 
</P>
<P>
But for now, the stage is just a forlorn, empty space, waiting for technology 
and magic to convert it into a place where musicians can somehow be intimate 
with a crowd of more than 1,200 strangers.

BINGO CONTROVERSY SPLITS CUDAHY COUNCIL; 
</P>
<P>
GAMBLING: A BINGO OPERATOR'S REQUEST FOR A 3-YEAR LICENSE STARTS A TUG OF WAR 
IN WHICH THE ACTING CITY MANAGER'S JOB MAY BE AT STAKE.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A political tug of war has broken out among City Council members over a 
proposal that would grant bingo operators three-year licenses. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy began two weeks ago when Acting City Manager Jack Joseph denied 
a request by Compton businessman John Mgrdichian for a three-year extension of 
his license to operate bingo games in Cudahy. Mgrdichian's one-year license 
expires in August. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Bill Colon then proposed an ordinance change that would allow the 
three-year license. He also proposed that the City Council hire a city manager 
-- a move that critics say is aimed at ousting Joseph from his job. 
</P>
<P>
Both proposals are on the council agenda Monday night. They have provoked 
criticism from Councilmen Joseph Fregeau and Joseph Graffio, who question 
Colon's motives, saying he wants a different city manager because Joseph 
refused to extend Mgrdichian's license. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman John Robertson has joined Colon in supporting the proposal for a 
three-year license. Councilman Tom Thurman, who would have cast the deciding 
vote, resigned unexpectedly last week. 
</P>
<P>
Thurman denied that the coming vote on the bingo proposal was the reason he 
resigned just 2 1/2 months before his term would have expire. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not the main reason," Thurman said. "After a while I got tired of 
putting up with the baloney from month to month. But if it was just that 
(bingo), it would have been easier for me just not to show up at the meeting 
and continue to get paid." 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Mgrdichian formed the Social Service Foundation, a charitable 
organization that was to host bingo games to support the fledgling Cudahy 
Social Service Agency, funded by the city. 
</P>
<P>
The Social Service Agency no longer exists, but last August Mgrdichian was 
granted a one-year license to operate a 450-seat bingo parlor on Santa Ana 
Street. Two months ago he asked the city for the three-year extension. 
</P>
<P>
After meeting with the city attorney, Joseph wrote Mgrdichian that he could not 
legally renew a license until 30 days before its expiration date, and that even 
then he could renew it for only one year. 
</P>
<P>
Although Colon put his proposal to hire a city manager on the council agenda 
soon after Mgrdichian's request was denied, he said there is no connection 
between the two. Colon said he has been asking for months that Mgrdichian 
receive a three-year license. 
</P>
<P>
Colon said Joseph does not have enough experience to be a city manager. "He is 
in way over his head," the councilman said. 
</P>
<P>
Fregeau disagreed: "I believe Jack is well qualified to do the job, and I would 
like to see him become the permanent city manager." 
</P>
<P>
Joseph was named acting city manager in September after Gerald Caton resigned 
to become city manager of Downey. 
</P>
<P>
Fregeau said he thinks Mgrdichian is seeking a three-year license to pave the 
way for a card casino. 
</P>
<P>
Mgrdichian denied that he wants to start a card casino. "I don't even see what 
one has to do with the other," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph said that even if Mgrdichian did decide to open a card casino, he could 
not do so without council approval. 
</P>
<P>
Mgrdichian said the Social Service Foundation has borrowed more than $1 million 
to demolish the building at 4610 Santa Ana St. and begin building the bingo 
parlor. 
</P>
<P>
"We're investing quite a bit of money," he said. "Too much money for just a 
one-year license. I just want to make sure my investment is secure." 
</P>
<P>
Once the bingo games are running, sometime late this year, Mgrdichian said, 
some of the profits would be donated to the foundation to repay the loans and 
some would go to other charitable organizations. One percent of monthly profits 
over $5,000 would go to the city. 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, all profits from bingo games, minus operating costs, must go 
to charitable organizations.

RENEWAL PROJECT FOR HOLLYWOOD WINS 2ND BATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state Court of Appeal has ruled that the city of Los Angeles properly 
considered the environmental implications of the 1,100-acre Hollywood 
redevelopment project when the City Council approved it in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
A ruling against the city on Jan. 30 would have brought the $922-million 
renewal effort to a halt and forced the Community Redevelopment Agency to 
undertake a lengthy new environmental review. 
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased as all get out," said R. Bruce Tepper, an attorney for the 
redevelopment agency. "Environmental compliance in the context of any land-use 
decision is critical. It can knock you out." 
</P>
<P>
This was the second setback in less than a week for critics of Hollywood 
renewal. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 24, the city and redevelopment agency won a separate court battle over 
the project. A Superior Court judge let stand a decision allowing the city to 
replace a citizens advisory committee controlled by redevelopment critics with 
a new group favoring the project. 
</P>
<P>
The Hollywood redevelopment plan calls for investing $922 million in public 
funds in central Hollywood over 30 years to spruce up old buildings, construct 
new ones, address traffic and housing problems and provide public amenities. 
The project area includes about 35,000 residents and covers an area bordered 
roughly by La Brea Avenue on the west, Serrano Avenue on the east, Franklin 
Avenue on the north and Santa Monica Boulevard and Fountain Avenue on the 
south. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood businessman David Morgan, who filed the suit challenging the city's 
environmental review of the redevelopment project, said he will ask the 
appellate court to reconsider the case. If he loses again, he said, he will 
appeal to the state Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
"I will keep fighting," said Morgan, who runs a camera shop on Sunset 
Boulevard. "I am not giving up on this. It is too important an issue." 
</P>
<P>
In the ruling released Tuesday, a three-judge panel rejected Morgan's claim 
that the project's environmental impact report was flawed because it did not 
discuss the medical effects of potential relocation on residents. Morgan 
contended that medical research shows forced relocation causes "severe 
emotional stress . . . upon the human spirit and body often leading to illness 
and death." 
</P>
<P>
The panel also rejected Morgan's claim that the Community Redevelopment Agency 
did not follow proper procedures in holding public hearings and releasing 
information to the public about the report. Morgan said the agency's actions 
deprived him and others of "due process" under the law. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan, who lives in Los Feliz, has been one of the most diligent critics of 
the 3 1/2-year-old redevelopment project. Although originally represented by an 
attorney, he acted as his own lawyer during the appeal, writing his own brief 
and arguing the case in court. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan has also joined several other Hollywood activists in a separate lawsuit 
challenging the validity of the redevelopment plan, a blueprint for renewal 
approved by the City Council in 1986. A Superior Court judge ruled against the 
group last year, but Morgan and the others have appealed. 
</P>
<P>
Tepper, the redevelopment agency attorney, said last week's ruling "sets a good 
framework" for the Court of Appeal to consider the second lawsuit, which he 
predicted will be resolved "fairly quickly."

COUNCILMAN WON'T RUN AGAIN; 
</P>

POLITICS: HENNES' DECISION NOT TO SEEK REELECTION TO HIS HUNTINGTON PARK SEAT 
IS SEEN GREATLY IMPROVING CHANCES FOR THE ELECTION OF THE FIRST LATINO COUNCIL 
MEMBER.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Councilman Herbert A. Hennes Jr. has decided not to seek reelection in April, 
greatly improving the chances that a Latino will be elected to the City Council 
for the first time in this city, which is more than 90% Latino. 
</P>
<P>
Incumbents William P. Cunningham and Jim Roberts officially entered the race 
for three council seats last week. Three other candidates, two of whom are 
Latino, also filed as candidates in the April 10 election, a city spokeswoman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The incumbents and the two Latino challengers appear to be the strongest 
candidates. But the political odds could change. The filing deadline for the 
election was extended to Tuesday when Hennes decided not to seek reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Hennes, 65, had served on the council since 1970. He could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
Candidate Raul Perez, who has called for Latino representation on the council, 
said he is confident. "Definitely one of us is going to get in now," said 
Perez, a loan officer who has run unsuccessfully for the City Council five 
times. 
</P>
<P>
The other two candidates are Luis Hernandez, a financial analyst and local 
political activist, and Alan Kartsman, who ran unsuccessfully for city 
treasurer in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
A prominent Latino businessman and Huntington Park civic leader decided not to 
enter the race. Rudy S. Griego, a former Chamber of Commerce president, said he 
would have been tagged a "carpetbagger." Griego, who now lives in Granada 
Hills, considered moving back to Huntington Park to qualify for the April 
election. 
</P>
<P>
Griego had obtained the endorsement of Councilman Jack W. Parks on Thursday 
morning, hours before he decided not to enter the race. Griego said he will 
support Perez, but is undecided about other endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
The election campaign is expected to focus on the city's financial problems, 
which forced the layoffs of 25 municipal employees last October. The council 
also made substantial cuts in city services, such as closing City Hall on 
Fridays and virtually eliminating recreation programs at two city parks. 
</P>
<P>
But a strong undercurrent is likely to be generated by the lack of Latino 
representation on the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Perez and Griego, in particular, have said in recent weeks that a 
Spanish-speaking Latino would be better able to communicate with and and 
represent the city's residents. The incumbents do not speak Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
The incumbents also have drawn criticism because none of the city's nine top 
administrators are Latino, and just two of Huntington Park's 18 appointed 
commissioners are Latino. 
</P>
<P>
The incumbents respond that they would have hired or appointed more Latino 
department heads and commissioners had there been qualified applicants. 
</P>
<P>
The margin of victory between the incumbents and their Latino challengers has 
been narrowing over the years. Perez came closest to winning a council seat in 
1988, losing by just 21 votes. 
</P>
<P>
Local political observers say that Latino voters apparently are getting more 
involved than ever before in city politics. In 1988, for example, Latinos 
accounted for 53.3% of the city's registered voters, compared to about 30% in 
1980, according to an independent surveys.

POLITICAL BATTLE OF THE POTHOLDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have read that the candidates for William Campbell's state Senate seat are 
involved in a mudslinging fight. Another image comes to my mind when I think of 
the upcoming special election. 
</P>
<P>
I prefer to call it "The Battle of the Potholders." 
</P>
<P>
At first I had little reaction when I received potholders in the mail from two 
of the candidates' wives along with letters of support for their husbands. I'm 
used to getting potholders and jar openers and refrigerator magnets from the 
local realtors. 
</P>
<P>
Then my amusement changed to indignation. What an insult to the women in this 
district -- to think that a potholder would have an impact on our votes. We are 
intelligent enough to vote based upon real issues that concern us. 
</P>
<P>
Should I vote for the potholder with the pretty flowers or for the potholder 
with the nice image of the state Capitol? Give me a break! Or better yet, give 
me a real candidate for state Senate.

SHELTER'S AIM IS TO LIBERATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In recent days, Catholic Charities' Long Beach Family Shelter for the Homeless 
has come under fire by the newly formed Homeless Organizing Committee, which 
claims the shelter is oppressive in its treatment of residents and its policies 
and procedures (Times, Jan. 25). 
</P>
<P>
It is unfortunate that the committee perceives the shelter in this manner when, 
in fact, the aim of the shelter, its policies and procedures, is to liberate 
residents from the cycle of homelessness. It is not now, nor has it ever been, 
the intent of Catholic Charities to add further burden to people who are 
already struggling with the trauma of homelessness and unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
Catholic Charities today finds fewer and fewer organizations willing to commit 
to the financial and administrative tasks of running a shelter. We need the 
support of our homeless guests as much as they need our shelter. 
</P>
<P>
Lupe Macker, Catholic Charities regional director in Long Beach, has unjustly 
come under fire for her administration of the shelter and been accused of 
lacking a true concern for the plight of the residents. Nothing could be 
further from the truth. Not only has she shown great concern and compassion for 
the needy persons in her region, but she is often their advocate without 
promoting other personal agendas. This is clearly evident by the strong support 
she has received over the years from the community, the city and county. As 
executive director of Catholic Charities, I fully support and applaud Mrs. 
Macker's leadership and guidance in administration of the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
Since Catholic Charities began administration of the shelter in 1984, our 
underlying philosophy has been to help families stay together while seeking 
permanent housing and employment. The Long Beach Family Shelter is one of the 
very few shelters in California that houses families together during the crisis 
of homeless. 
</P>
<P>
The Long Beach Family Shelter for the Homeless has been successful in helping 
families mainstream into society largely because of its organization, structure 
and procedures. Any social service agency, in order to be effective, must 
maintain standards that not only ensure clients success and betterment, but 
protect them and their children from any abusive situations which might occur. 
</P>
<P>
Catholic Charities further acknowledges the residents' right to voice their 
opinions and grievances not often heard. We welcome an open, honest dialogue 
with the Homeless Organizing Committee to address their questions and needs. We 
strongly believe that community input is vital to maintaining quality care for 
those we seek to help. 
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to be homeless. It is difficult to be in a homeless shelter no 
matter how good the shelter may be. It is difficult to administer a shelter 
with ever-diminishing funds. However, despite these difficulties, Catholic 
Charities wishes to make this commitment and seeks partnership and support from 
the homeless we care for and the community we serve.

CANDIDATES DON'T SHOW LEADERSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have been following with great interest the special election race in the 
Republican Party for the 31st Senate District vacated by Sen. William Campbell. 
Like most residents of this district, I have been amused, entertained, bored, 
surprised and even shocked at the cruelty in words that grown men use to 
deprecate each other. 
</P>
<P>
What I have not heard or seen in the literature that I have received is any 
cadence of leadership from any of the candidates. One would think that this 
special election would be the opportune moment where a candidate could 
distinguish himself by his rhetoric and character, thus showing the public the 
first fruits of a promising political leader. What I got instead were "wimps" 
that have tried to sound like leaders. 
</P>
<P>
What I want is to know that the candidate I select could not only lead our 
district, but in time would be part of a pool of future political leaders that 
would eventually provide leadership for the state in the next century. With the 
choices presented to me, I do not feel that the future of my generation stands 
on solid ground. Often, I feel like a voter being courted by suitors that do 
not entice or excite me. Perhaps I am asking too much. But as a voter, I just 
wish that one of the candidates would satisfy my hunger for leadership. 
</P>
<P>
The literature that I have received has been insulting. I would never vote for 
or against someone based on accusations, innuendoes or potholders. I am 
indignant over those candidates that believe that my intelligence is at the 
level of one of Pavlov's dogs. They may drag their character and intelligence 
in the sewers, but I will not join them. It is too bad that I have to choose 
the future senator of this district based on this kindergarten rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
Californians are known to produce great wines. The grapes that produce these 
wines are nurtured and are not taken from the vine until they are ready for the 
public. I feel that most of the current assemblage of candidates for the 31st 
Senate District are not ready for the public. They should remain on the vine 
until they mature, because the challenges that we will face in our senatorial 
district in this decade will most likely temper a man and forge a future leader 
for California.

SETTLING DIFFERENCES OVER HOLLYWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding an article on the Project Area Committee in Hollywood (Times, Jan. 
18): 
</P>
<P>
Councilman (Michael) Woo's declaration that his "community representatives" are 
there to "serve at his discretion" and "whose views" on redevelopment "are 
compatible with my (Woo's) own," is the problem in a nutshell. They are Woo's 
representatives, not the community's, as the elected PAC has stated all along. 
Recent events in Eastern Europe have shown the fallacy of such claims that 
appointed community representation is better than elected representation. 
Unless, of course, you have something to hide. 
</P>
<P>
The PAC took on immediate issues of concern, challenging projects presented by 
large campaign contributors because of their impact on the community. We 
didn't, and still don't, bury our heads in the sand dreaming about "plans" for 
10 to 20 years from now when the real issues in Hollywood are being decided 
now. Long-term goals and plans are needed, but rarely followed. Hollywood has 
been studied to death, while implementation and action has either been with 
smoke and mirrors, or a sledgehammer. 
</P>
<P>
The PAC made over 130 specific recommendations for the plan, but discussion and 
implementation has been stifled by the Community Redevelopment Agency, which 
prefers to see no evil, hear no evil and speak no evil of redevelopment. I've 
attended over 250 public meetings in the past four years regarding "cleaning up 
Hollywood," listening to the same problems and the same officials pointing 
fingers. 
</P>
<P>
What is Councilman Woo's "vision" for Hollywood? More studies that are almost 
two years late and hundreds of thousands of dollars over budget? 
</P>
<P>
I am encouraged by Woo's comments to The Times that he would like the two 
advisory groups to "make amends somehow." Our conflict is not between the two 
groups, but in his attempts to silence elected community representatives when 
they oppose him. For the record, we have always been open to "make amends" if 
the councilman is willing to talk to us about it (as I have told him). 
</P>
<P>
Let's quit the petty politics in Hollywood and get on with restoring the 
world's most famous community in a fair and open manner benefiting everyone.

AROUND THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY / MARY R. HEFFRON: 'IT'S REALLY AN IMPOTENT 
FEELING, TO SIT AND WRITE LETTERS TO THE EDITOR.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mary R. Heffron 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Each morning, Edward T. Bagley gets on his bicycle and pedals out of his 
driveway, down Rancho La Puente Drive and onto Valley Boulevard for his 
newspaper run. 
</P>
<P>
Then he spends the day reading. Or rather, poring. Devouring. Critiquing. 
</P>
<P>
And sometimes -- pretty often, actually -- Bagley gets angry. Angry with 
politicians, angry with bureaucrats, angry with pomposity, angry with the 
newspapers themselves. 
</P>
<P>
That's when Bagley, a retired auto-body shop worker whose friends call him Tom, 
sits down at his computer and writes letters to the editors. 
</P>
<P>
Editors of the Orange County Register, the San Gabriel Valley Tribune and The 
Times all have heard from Bagley. Until a couple of months ago, the Los Angeles 
Herald Examiner was on the list. In addition, there's Newsweek, Time, Financial 
World, Reader's Digest, American History and Civil War Times magazines. 
</P>
<P>
"I buy stamps $25 at a time," said Bagley, whose long hair and graying beard 
make him seem older than his 47 years. "I'm a regular gadfly." 
</P>
<P>
He estimates he sees about one letter a week in print, somewhere; he has a 
thick scrapbook bulging with the published evidence of his work. 
</P>
<P>
Week before last was a banner one with The Times: Bagley hit pay dirt on the 
editorial page, in The Times Magazine and in the San Gabriel Valley section. 
</P>
<P>
What made Bagley angriest that week was a story about a talk humorist Steve 
Allen gave at Caltech. Allen was expounding on "dumbth," his term for spreading 
incompetence, illiteracy and gullibility. 
</P>
<P>
Bagley, however, thought it was rather elitist for Allen to take this message 
to an audience of college professors and scientists. As his letter put it, 
"that's like coaching the extremely rich on how to make a fortune. . . . Why 
not take his humor to the middle schools, where there is still time enough to 
make an impression?" 
</P>
<P>
At his kitchen table in La Puente, over a cup of coffee and a smoke one 
afternoon last week, Bagley said he's liked Allen ever since he caught Allen's 
cerebral jokes on the old "Tonight Show" when his friends didn't. "He's pretty 
smart," Bagley said of Allen. "That's what made me mad, for him to pull a stunt 
like that." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, though, Bagley is sorry about what he writes in his letters. "You 
fire them off in anger. . . . Then I'll go through my scrapbook and say, 'Oh, 
Tom, how could you say that?' " 
</P>
<P>
Why read so many papers? "You don't get the truth out of one," Bagley said. 
"You guys will make (some) guy sound like a hero, and I'll read somewhere else 
that he got a $100,000 campaign contribution to be a hero." 
</P>
<P>
Bagley started reading the Steubenville, Ohio, Herald-Star as a child, but he 
got his love for the medium from a 1944 publication called "News of the 
Nation," a tabloid-size publication that told history lessons, starting with 
Columbus discovering America, in daily newspaper format. 
</P>
<P>
His family moved to California in 1959; Bagley graduated from Downey High 
School. He went to take an entrance exam at Cerritos College but left because 
the waiting line was so long "and then there was a rainstorm and a tree fell on 
my car and I never got back." 
</P>
<P>
Bagley, who said he's been "beating fenders and painting cars" since he started 
helping his father at age 12, retired after he crushed a nerve in his elbow. 
He's studying small-engine repair and does that as a sideline. He is writing a 
novel about a family of sisters who are incompetent witches, and a short story 
about future gang warfare, set in 2017 in Rancho Cucamonga. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he just keeps writing letters, hoping to change things but realizing 
he probably won't. "It's really an impotent feeling, to sit and write letters 
to the editor," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He wishes newspapers would take on more social issues rather than political 
ones. Most of the people who live in the mobile home park where Bagley lives 
are elderly. One neighbor is a military retiree who can't afford his $88 gas 
bill; another has no transportation except Dial-a-Ride. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no idea that older people have so much trouble till I moved here," he 
said. "You don't write enough about the problems of the elderly. I like 
(newspapers) so much, but it does seem they stay above certain issues that are 
important to people. . . . If they'd get down and wallow in it a while, they'd 
get it fixed." 
</P>
<P>
Newspaper editors debate constantly over how to draw people into the paper, how 
to present the news so the most readers possible will want to read as much as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
Bagley, with his prodigious reading habits, would certainly be one to poll on 
this question. So how does he tackle his daily stack? "I look at the Page 2 
(table of contents)," he said, "and find the one that makes me the angriest, 
and I turn to it."

CLASS TRANSLATES HOME SAFETY TIPS FOR LATINO SITTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AURORA MACKEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like many Southern Californians, Ismelda Durazo was jolted by the 1987 Whittier 
earthquake. But that was nothing, she said, compared to the jolt she received 
when she saw her Guatemalan baby-sitter's reaction to it. 
</P>
<P>
"I was upstairs with my son when the quake hit, and my baby-sitter was 
downstairs with my daughter. I yelled for her to get under a table, but she 
still ran outside with my daughter," Durazo recalled. 
</P>
<P>
"When I asked her later why she didn't listen to me, she told me it was what 
she had been taught to do. She said: 'In my country, you run outside during 
earthquakes, because if you don't, the house will fall on top of you.' " 
</P>
<P>
From that experience, Durazo began to wonder if there might be other cultural 
differences that could affect her baby-sitter's response to emergencies. The 
conclusion she reached, she said, was not a comforting one. 
</P>
<P>
"My baby-sitter is very bright," Durazo said, "but when she told me how people 
in her country treat things like burns and fevers, that's when it hit me that 
my children were at risk. 
</P>
<P>
"Our beliefs here are so different than in the Latin American countries. Still, 
no one was addressing it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Filling the Gap 
</P>
<P>
Convinced that there was an information gap that needed filling, Durazo left 
her job as an insurance company clerk in 1987 and founded Safekids, U.S.A., a 
one-day course designed for Latino housekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
Conducted in Spanish, the six-hour class addresses topics such as infant 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation, treatment of shock, accidental poisoning and 
kidnaping awareness. At the completion of the class, each participant receives 
American Red Cross certification in CPR from Durazo, who is a certified 
instructor. 
</P>
<P>
The American Red Cross itself holds a CPR class in Spanish in downtown Los 
Angeles that costs $15. A Red Cross spokeswoman, however, said that the Red 
Cross course does not address all the other safety issues covered in Durazo's 
class. 
</P>
<P>
Since Durazo first offered her course, several hundred housekeepers have taken 
it at sites in Encino, West Hills, West Los Angeles and Manhattan Beach, she 
said, adding that she plans to expand to Pasadena, Malibu and Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Although many of the misconceptions she confronts are held by people 
everywhere, Durazo begins each class by addressing the ones she encounters most 
often among women from Latin American countries. For housekeepers who are 
working in the United States illegally, that often means dispelling a mistaken 
belief regarding the consequences of dialing 911. 
</P>
<P>
After one Salvadoran housekeeper attended a class held recently in West Hills, 
she said in Spanish: "Before, I would have been afraid that if I called someone 
in an emergency, immigration would come." 
</P>
<P>
Only two of the 11 women in the class said they were legal residents. 
</P>
<P>
Durazo, whose parents are from Mexico and who speaks fluent Spanish, said: "You 
wouldn't believe how many women have said to me, 'Oh yes, I have heard of 911. 
The lady told me to call 911 in an emergency.' But when I asked them what 911 
is, they have absolutely no idea. The term 911 means nothing to them." 
</P>
<P>
In most cases, Durazo said, housekeepers sign up for the $50 class at the 
request of employers, who view the cost as an investment in precaution. "One 
mother just wrote and said her housekeeper came back and wanted to know where 
the flashlights and gas-shut-off valve were in case of an earthquake," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
We All Have Pools' 
</P>
<P>
Lesley Salisbury Thompson, a Los Angeles feature writer for British 
publications, said she heard about the class from two neighbors who planned to 
enroll their housekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the reasons I wanted her to take the class in Spanish was that I think 
there is a reluctance for many Hispanic women to admit they don't always 
understand you," Thompson said. "We all have pools that pose a safety problem, 
and the housekeepers spend a lot of time with the children, and so there really 
is the need for basic information." 
</P>
<P>
Lorena Gonzales, a housekeeper from Mexico, said her employer had an even 
stronger personal reason for asking her to take the class. 
</P>
<P>
"She asked me what I would do if her infant were choking, and I told her I once 
pulled food from the throat of a little boy. She said: 'That was good, but in 
most cases it wouldn't help,' " Gonzales said. "Then she told me that when she 
was a child, on Christmas, her 1 1/2-year-old brother choked on food and died." 
</P>
<P>
"If my mother had known the Heimlich maneuver, he might still be alive today," 
said Christian Gilbert, a civil engineer in Glendale who hired Gonzales to care 
for her 3-month-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
For Sharon Piehl, a banking administrator who lives in Pacific Palisades, 
enrolling her housekeeper in the class represented an attempt to deal with the 
after-effects of tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
Piehl was at home last March when a fire broke out in her neighbor's house 
across the street and claimed the lives of three children who had been left in 
the care of a Spanish-speaking baby-sitter. 
</P>
<P>
The baby-sitter, who inadvertently caused a fire by draping a cloth over a lamp 
to help one child sleep, ran outside screaming for help. By the time she and 
some neighbors tried to enter the house to get the children, the home was 
engulfed in flames. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone was so traumatized by this, including all of the housekeepers, we had 
to do something," said Piehl, who organized a group of 11 housekeepers in the 
neighborhood to take the Safekids course. "When I talked to my baby-sitter the 
next day, I told her that if anything like that ever happened, everything was 
replaceable except the children. This other baby-sitter thought she had time to 
go back for the children. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Handling Crises

"I was told that in Mexico, many of the buildings are made of brick, and so if 
there is a fire, it doesn't burn the same way," Piehl said. "They wouldn't 
think a house could burn down so fast." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Piehl said, she takes no chances when it comes to the children's safety. 
</P>
<P>
"I have emergency numbers hanging right next to the phone, along with my 
address," she said. "My baby-sitter may know where I live now, but not know" 
the address "if there were a crisis." 
</P>
<P>
Durazo, who teaches the course to about 40 women each month, said she believes 
that kind of awareness could well be used by many other parents. Although she 
said it is not uncommon for housekeepers to be unable to give the last name or 
address of their employers -- at a recent class, for example, nine out of 11 
women did not know their employers' last name -- that lack of information also 
works both ways. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I'm really shocked by the things the mothers tell me," Durazo said. 
"I ask them about their housekeepers, and they don't even know their last names 
or where they live. God forbid they should hire a nut and she should take off 
with their children." 
</P>
<P>
Durazo said she recommends that employers ask for at least three references 
from potential housekeepers and that, once hired, the employers make a 
photocopy of a current form of picture identification. 
</P>
<P>
In classes, Durazo also makes an effort to determine which housekeepers have 
been informed about what to do in an emergency, and which ones have been told 
nothing. 
</P>
<P>
"I ask how many of them have been given a first-aid kit, and maybe two people 
will raise their hands," she said. "Even then, no one has explained to them 
what it is for. 
</P>
<P>
"What that means to me," she said, "is that even if they have it, they don't 
know how to use it." 
</P>
<P>
The next Safekids classes will be held Feb. 10 in Encino and Feb. 16 in West 
Hills. For more information, call (818) 884-7311.

<P>
Councilman Bill Colon has placed two proposals on the agenda that would outlaw 
the involvement of city staff and City Council members in political and smear 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Colon also has asked that the city take possession of the Cudahy Social Service 
Agency, which occupies a city-owned building and recently was served with an 
eviction notice. 
</P>
<P>
He has requested that the agency's controversial director, James Graham, be 
given a five-month contract for $14,900. 
</P>
<P>
A similar proposal by Councilman John Robertson was passed by the council at 
its last meeting in January, but was ruled invalid several days later by City 
Atty. Glenn Watson. Colon said he is requesting urgency ordinances prohibiting 
staff, under threat of termination, from engaging in political or smear 
campaigns because of "constant political games" in City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"It's time the city grew up and stopped playing kid games," Colon said. 
</P>
<P>
Under Colon's proposal, council members involved in smear campaigns would be 
fined at least $5,000.

<P>
VOLUNTEERS: DR. DALE HOYT LEADS A GROUP TO BAJA EACH MONTH TO TREAT THE SICK -- 
28 YEARS AFTER HE FOUNDED THE 1,400-MEMBER FLYING SAMARITANS.

PUNTA PRIETA, Mexico 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ruddy-cheeked man in the brown leather bomber jacket clambered out of the 
Cessna 210 and glanced across the forsaken plain, the dusty view broken only by 
occasional clumps of cacti and scrubby underbrush. 
</P>
<P>
Eager to check on a baby he had helped treat for a brain abnormality, Dr. Dale 
Hoyt waited for three gun-toting soldiers in camouflage to finish inspecting 
the plane. Then he hurried across the small military landing strip and hoisted 
himself onto the back of a rusty, orange cattle truck heading toward the 
100-person village of Punta Prieta. 
</P>
<P>
But bad news waited there for the 68-year-old Oxnard doctor who founded the 
Flying Samaritans, an organization that has provided medical services in remote 
areas of Baja for 28 years. 
</P>
<P>
The 15-month-old baby had been dead for a week. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard," Hoyt said, shaking his head slowly back and forth. "It's really 
hard." 
</P>
<P>
Kay Hoyt, 55, the doctor's wife and assistant for 14 years, struggled against 
her tears as did some of the other 20-odd volunteers who had traveled for three 
hours in private planes to host their monthly medical clinic. 
</P>
<P>
But the doctors, nurses, dentists, pilots and errand-runners had little time 
for grief. 
</P>
<P>
It was 1 p.m., and in just a few hours the sun would dip behind the mountains, 
making it impossible for the five private planes transporting the group to fly 
to the next town, Bahia de Los Angeles, where there are no lights to illuminate 
the small landing strip. 
</P>
<P>
The team members -- some along for the first time, others seasoned veterans of 
the expeditions -- hurried into a light-blue building that had been set up for 
medical services. 
</P>
<P>
The outside walls were pockmarked by jagged holes. Inside, particle-board 
partitions smudged with dirt and buckling away from their frames separated 
three examining rooms and a dental office, in which two antique chairs faced 
each other. 
</P>
<P>
In the pharmacy area, seemingly limitless bottles of pills and creams, most 
donated by doctors from the United States, crammed makeshift plywood shelves. A 
cardboard box served as a trash basket. 
</P>
<P>
Outside, townspeople gathered around. The arrival of the Flying "Sams" is about 
the biggest social event in town, drawing people from outlying communities who 
are eager to see the doctor or the dentist. 
</P>
<P>
The clinic is the only means of medical treatment for many of the people in and 
near Punta Prieta, a town that was built as a compound for road workers during 
construction 15 years ago of the two-lane highway that extends the length of 
Baja's finger-like peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
People still live in the barracks-like structures, which include a communal 
eating hall and a recreation room. The outlying area is dotted with houses, 
built mostly of cinder blocks, and interspersed with abandoned cars rusted to 
their chassis. 
</P>
<P>
To this and other poor communities, the Samaritans provide a scholarship 
program to encourage children to stay in school. On this trip, they also hosted 
a Christmas party, for which kids lined up to choose from hundreds of toys. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a steady stream of people swarmed around the entrance to the medical 
clinic, where Flying Sams sorted records at a card table. 
</P>
<P>
Hoyt waited in an examination room along with his wife and a nurse. 
</P>
<P>
As he mused about his observations -- "Little bit of redness in left ear canal 
. . . OK, they're both red" -- Kay Hoyt took copious notes. 
</P>
<P>
She read them back to him, whereupon he made a diagnosis and called out an 
appropriate prescription. 
</P>
<P>
To most of the people he sees, Hoyt is just another doctor with the group. 
</P>
<P>
Even new Flying Samaritan volunteers often ask chatty questions about his 
background, not realizing he is responsible for the international organization 
that boasts about 1,400 members. 
</P>
<P>
The idea for the organization took form in 1961 after two American pilots 
flying from La Paz to San Diego were forced to make an emergency landing on an 
isolated mesa during a dust storm. People from the nearby village of El Rosario 
fed and sheltered the two women before finding more fuel for their plane and 
sending them home. 
</P>
<P>
Impressed by the kindness of the townspeople, the two women, Polly Ross and 
Ailene Mellott, organized an airlift of food and toys to the 1,200 people in 
the fishing village. Hoyt, a pilot with the Civil Air Patrol, joined the 
effort. After the deliveries had been made, the villagers were asked whether 
they wanted to see a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
On that first visit, Hoyt held office hours on a kitchen table as another pilot 
held a flashlight for him to see. He examined only 22 people -- some with 
hernias or tonsillitis, one woman with cancer of the uterus -- before he ran 
out of supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Drawn again and again by the needs of the people, Hoyt has continued flying 
back to the remote town. 
</P>
<P>
"I was frustrated," Hoyt said. "Walking off and leaving somebody was kind of 
rough." 
</P>
<P>
Within months he had established a monthly clinic that ultimately became the 
Flying Samaritans, a nonprofit organization with nine chapters in California 
and others in Arizona and Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
The largest chapter is called the Foothill Chapter and has about 300 members 
from around Los Angeles and Ventura counties. Hoyt joined this chapter when he 
moved to Oxnard from Orange County two years ago to begin a personal injury 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
Although he was very active in the Flying Sams in the past, Hoyt has begun to 
slow down in recent years, content to fade into the background and leave the 
leadership of the group to others. 
</P>
<P>
On his trips to Mexico, he concentrates only on treating those who come to see 
him, his ego seemingly uninflated by the kudos given to the service that helps 
people in more than 20 Mexican towns. 
</P>
<P>
"It is of great significance to our lives," said Margarita Cota, 42, Punta 
Prieta's unofficial mayor. "They have done a great many helpful things." 
</P>
<P>
If a medical emergency arises between the periodic visits from Hoyt and his 
colleagues, residents must make their way to Ensenada or Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, they wait for the Flying Samaritans. 
</P>
<P>
Maria Sanchez, 38, wanted to see the dentist about a sore tooth that has hurt 
her for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
"I can eat nothing too cold and nothing too hot," Sanchez said. "I am not able 
to eat on the left side of my mouth." 
</P>
<P>
Indolecio de Perez, 72, and his wife, Germana, 60, walked for four days to get 
to the clinic. The old man, wearing a soiled blue dress shirt and black shoes 
scuffed to a dull gray, was told he needed surgery for a hernia. His sight also 
is failing. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to make saddles," Germana de Perez explained. "Now, he cannot see. He 
is not able to cut the leather." 
</P>
<P>
In halting Spanish, a nurse explained that Germana de Perez must also seek 
further tests and treatment at a Baja medical clinic for an abdominal infection 
caused by unsanitary drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
But the Samaritans could do nothing more that day for the couple. They had 
treated about 40 people, and it was time to board their planes and head to 
Bahia de Los Angeles, a coastal fishing village of about 500 people. 
</P>
<P>
Dale and Kay Hoyt stayed near the back of the cattle truck. She exchanged 
pleasantries while Dale, a quiet man with a wry sense of humor, studied the 
others on the trip. 
</P>
<P>
Dale Hoyt, with his calm blue eyes and slate-gray hair, spoke in a slow and 
measured manner as he recalled his first visits to Mexico. When he began the 
clinics, he would bring his family, putting them to work. His brother 
interpreted for him. His wife held a flashlight during surgery. 
</P>
<P>
The villagers were not used to the ways of the Americans, Hoyt said. 
</P>
<P>
Nurses on the trip were warned by the local residents that wearing shorts was 
improper. The modest townspeople were reluctant to submit to exams. 
</P>
<P>
"There were so many gowns and slips that to do a pelvic exam in those days it 
was difficult to get all those clothes off," Dale Hoyt said. 
</P>
<P>
They spent one night in a room with goats, he recalled. They also slept in 
sleeping bags under the wings of their plane. 
</P>
<P>
As he reminisced, it became apparent how much the organization has meant to 
him. For Kay Hoyt, also, the group is as important as family. 
</P>
<P>
"We eat together and work together for 24 hours, and we are four to six little 
people up in a plane all together," Kay Hoyt said. "You go down with strangers, 
and you leave hugging." 
</P>
<P>
Hoyt disengaged himself from the Samaritans for five years when he and Kay 
moved to Northern California, where they started a farm raising exotic animals 
and he lived the life of a country doctor. 
</P>
<P>
But a nostalgic trip back to El Rosario in 1984 illustrated to Hoyt how much he 
missed his work in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
As Dale walked through the town where he had held the Samaritans' first 
clinics, people came down from the hills to welcome him, Kay Hoyt said. 
</P>
<P>
"They would say, 'Don't you remember you delivered my baby?' " she said. " 
'He's 21 now.' " 
</P>
<P>
He rejoined the Flying Samaritans, treating everything from leprosy to cleft 
palate. He has amputated a gangrenous foot and removed part of a cancerous ear. 
He has seen a woman, her cancer metastasized, seemingly cure herself with doses 
of an Indian tea made from local plants. And he has arranged surgery in the 
United States that allowed a girl to regain her sight. 
</P>
<P>
Now, though, the Hoyts and other Flying Samaritans are turning their attention 
to the future. 
</P>
<P>
Dale and Kay Hoyt are anticipating their next trip. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been fun as well as a challenge," Dale said.

DEDUCTING MORTGAGE INTEREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. BRUSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most homeowners have heard about the changes Congress made to the home mortgage 
interest-deduction rules that became effective for the 1988 tax year. 
</P>
<P>
But there is still considerable confusion about which interest is immediately 
deductible, what must be deducted over the life of the home mortgage and which 
interest is not deductible as residence interest. 
</P>
<P>
Home buyers who purchased their primary or secondary personal residence after 
Oct. 13, 1987, can fully deduct interest on their "acquisition mortgage" 
financing up to $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Such financing includes home loans secured by the residence that are used to 
buy, build or substantially improve the owner's home. 
</P>
<P>
Interest on pre-Oct. 13, 1987, home mortgages is "grandfathered" and considered 
to be an acquisition mortgage. Similarly, refinancing of such pre-Oct. 13, 
1987, loans also qualifies as acquisition mortgage if the new amount does not 
exceed the old loan's balance. 
</P>
<P>
Funds borrowed and secured by your principal or second home within 90 days 
before or after acquisition are considered acquisition debt. 
</P>
<P>
This means that if you paid cash for your new home but later change your mind 
and obtain a home loan within 90 days after purchase, you can deduct the 
mortgage interest on acquisition debt up to $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
If you paid a loan fee, often called "points," to obtain an acquisition 
mortgage from a lender who customarily charges such fees, the loan fee is 
deductible as itemized interest if you paid the loan fee by separate check and 
did not let the lender subtract it from the loan proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
However, if you did not pay the loan fee by separate check to the lender, then 
the loan fee must be amortized (deducted) over the life of the mortgage. To 
illustrate, if the lender subtracted a $1,000 loan fee for your 30-year loan, 
you can deduct $33.33 each year for the next 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Tax Court that ruled in the recent Huntsman case, loan fees 
paid to obtain refinancing to pay off a balloon payment home-acquisition 
mortgage are tax-deductible over the life of the mortgage and cannot be fully 
deducted in the year of obtaining the refinanced mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to deducting interest on acquisition debt, homeowners can deduct 
interest on up to $100,000 of home-equity debt secured by the residence, 
regardless of the loan's purpose. 
</P>
<P>
However, interest on loans secured by residences exceeding their market value 
are not deductible. 
</P>
<P>
This rule prevents homeowners from over-financing by converting non-deductible 
consumer debt, such as an auto loan, into a deductible home-equity loan. 
</P>
<P>
For purposes of deducting qualified residence interest, IRS Temporary 
Regulation 1.163-10T(p) defines a residence as a house, condominium, 
cooperative apartment, mobile home or boat that provides basic living 
accommodations, including sleeping space, toilet and cooking facilities. 
</P>
<P>
It can be the owner's principal or secondary residence. However, if a secondary 
residence is rented to tenants during part of the year, to qualify, the owner 
must use it for personal purposes for the greater of at least 14 days, or 
during 10% of its rental days. Otherwise, it does not qualify as a secondary 
residence. 
</P>
<P>
If you are building a new home with help from a construction loan, the 
construction loan interest is fully deductible if paid within 24 months before 
the home is finished and occupied. 
</P>
<P>
But the $1-million acquisition debt ceiling also applies to home construction 
loans. You have up to 90 days after construction completion to obtain an 
acquisition mortgage to replace the construction loan.

"Kirk-Alloway was drawing nigh, 
</P>
<P>
Where ghaists and houlets nightly cry." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Robert Burns 
</P>
<P>
A better setting for a ghost story would be hard to imagine. 
</P>
<P>
Hemmed in on all sides by crumbling gravestones, a roofless church broods under 
towering beech trees. This is Kirk-Alloway, picturesquely derelict since 1766. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody can say why it was abandoned. But like the weeds that ran riot in the 
empty nave, rumors flourished -- grisly, eerie rumors. For years the local 
people gave the place a wide berth, especially at night. 
</P>
<P>
Today this modest ruin is one of Scotland's top tourist attractions. Loch Ness 
may draw more visitors in the monster-hunting season, but Kirk-Alloway offers 
its ghost hunters something more: the certainty of finding at least one ghost. 
</P>
<P>
An average of 50,000 visitors a year walk these grassy aisles. Most of them are 
drawn by the same force that drew me: the spirit of Robert Burns. Dead these 
200 years, Burns is still a living presence throughout this lovely corner of 
Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
"Alloway's auld haunted kirk" is the setting for the comically macabre witch 
orgy in "Tam o' Shanter," the poet's masterpiece. 
</P>
<P>
Burns played among these stones as a boy. From here you can retrace his ghostly 
footprints to other places -- cottages, farms, pubs, fields and streams -- that 
still bear the imprint in some way of his short, intense, uproarious and tragic 
life. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Burns was born in this village on Jan. 25, 1759, the eldest son of an 
impoverished farmer. The humble thatched cottage, now a museum, is a mile north 
of the haunted church. 
</P>
<P>
The county is Ayrshire -- green country of gentle hills, deep woods and clear 
streams in the southwestern corner of Scotland. (Ayr, the county seat, is 33 
miles from Glasgow and 73 from Edinburgh.) 
</P>
<P>
With its scenic charms and ubiquitous bed and breakfasts, Ayrshire is a fine 
place to get away from it all. Except that right here, in the district of Kyle, 
you never quite get away from Robert Burns. Not that anyone wants to; he is 
precisely the reason why so many visitors come here from all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
Within hours of arriving in Burns country you can see the poet quite clearly 
with your eyes closed. That darkly handsome face is hard to avoid; it gazes at 
you from the wall of every pub and from crockery, dish towels and hearth rugs 
in every gift shop. 
</P>
<P>
But he is more than just a one-man tourist industry, more than every Scot's 
favorite dead poet. Two centuries after his death he is more loved and revered 
locally than any living celebrity. When I asked questions about him, the mere 
mention of his name was usually enough for the traditional Scots restraint to 
begin to evaporate. Eyes light up, tongues loosen. 
</P>
<P>
Alec Agnew, whom I spoke to at the Alloway Monument across from the church, had 
a typical viewpoint: "An awful wild man at times," he admitted. "But aren't we 
all occasionally?" 
</P>
<P>
Agnew, 41, retired after 20 years in the Glasgow police force, has been a 
self-described "Burns nut" all his life. As a child he won a national contest 
by reciting "The Two Dogs," a poem of more than 250 lines. His job as 
supervisor at the Monument gives him plenty of opportunity to talk about his 
obsession and to quote flawlessly, and with great relish, hundreds of lines of 
Burns, including, of course, "Tam o' Shanter." 
</P>
<P>
"The attraction of Burns," Agnew explained, "is that he is us. Everyman. With 
all our faults and virtues. You can open his works at any page and find 
something about yourself." 
</P>
<P>
George Bernard Shaw was as admiring and as forgiving. He wrote that Burns "had 
the Scottish gift for making his vices more amiable than other people's 
virtues." 
</P>
<P>
Scots slip easily into the present tense when talking about their national 
poet. At times the sense of Robert Burns as a living presence hereabouts is 
uncanny. In the collective Ayrshire mind, "oor Robbie" is still around 
somewhere, steering a plow, leaning at a bar or flirting with a lassie down 
some country lane. 
</P>
<P>
Yule Lithgow, aged 65, lives in tiny Tarbolton, where Burns started a 
"Bachelors' Club" and learned how to dance. He thinks of Burns as a neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
"He's very much alive to me," Lithgow said. "I walk the same streets, see the 
same places he wrote about, speak the same language. Burns is a part of this 
whole area and always will be." 
</P>
<P>
Gen. George Custer and Abraham Lincoln read Burns avidly. Ralph Waldo Emerson 
praised him lavishly. Washington Irving's "Legend of Sleepy Hollow" was 
strongly influenced (to put it politely) by "Tam o' Shanter." 
</P>
<P>
Knowingly or not, virtually every adult American quotes Burns at least once a 
year when they sing his song "Auld Lang Syne." 
</P>
<P>
Burns is arguably the most celebrated poet the world has ever known. Yet he was 
shamefully neglected in his lifetime, dying in 1796 at the age of 37. 
</P>
<P>
All of Burns' genius and hard work were not enough to break the trap of poverty 
that ruined his health. Death transformed the legend of Burns into an instant 
cottage industry. Lovers of literature began flocking to Ayrshire to take the 
"Burns Tour." 
</P>
<P>
They still do. 
</P>
<P>
Today the Scottish Tourist Board promotes the "Burns Heritage Trail." From its 
headquarters in Edinburgh the board supplies -- free -- maps and brochures for 
guiding visitors around Burns country. 
</P>
<P>
Guided bus tours are also available locally, and from companies based in 
Glasgow and Edinburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Ayrshire is not a large county; the two extremes of the tour -- Alloway and 
Dumfries (where Burns is buried) -- are only 60 miles apart. But even the 
hardiest Burnsians balk at tackling the whole tour at one time. 
</P>
<P>
The poet's footsteps can lead you through hundreds of miles of country roads to 
dozens of small museums, exposing you to many beautiful views. 
</P>
<P>
The village of Alloway is a perfect place to start exploring. Several important 
sites are within walking or driving distance. 
</P>
<P>
Across the street from "Alloway's auld haunted kirk" is the Alloway Monument. 
The lovely "banks and braes o' bonnie Doon" lie a few hundred yards south. 
Spanning the river is old Doon Bridge, over which the hapless Tam escaped the 
vengeful witches. 
</P>
<P>
Halfway between the bridge and the church, flanked by Tam's escape route on one 
side and the limpid river on the other, is the Burns Monument Hotel. Emblazoned 
above the main entrance are a holly bush and a shepherd's pipe: the coat of 
arms Burns designed for himself. 
</P>
<P>
This fine Tudor-style building has been a base camp for Burns hunters since 
1827. Its ambience has no surprises. The reception area is carpeted in tartan 
and engravings of Burns scenes are everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
The Scots call the hours between sundown and dark "the gloaming," and no other 
word suits it better. The dusk deepens gradually, stealthily, into a darkness 
that, even at midnight, is never black. 
</P>
<P>
The gloaming has a way of confusing the internal clock, and not just for the 
jet-lagged. Long after sunset a thrush was still singing in the tree above the 
roofless church. Bats flickered against a violet sky. The soft radiance 
illuminated the inscriptions on the headstones, some dating from the 16th 
Century. 
</P>
<P>
Facing the iron entrance gate is a large but not ostentatious stone marker 
where the parents of Robert Burns -- William Burnes (the "e" was dropped when 
Robert was a child) and Agnes Broun -- lie buried. 
</P>
<P>
Robert was often at odds with his father. He loved to dally with the village 
lassies, cutting a dashing figure with a showy plaid on one shoulder and his 
hair tied back with a ribbon. 
</P>
<P>
Robert spoke of his father with loving respect. On the obverse of William 
Burnes' tombstone is the epitaph that his son wrote for him: 
</P>
<P>
 "The friend of man, to vice alone a foe; 
</P>
<P>
 For even his failings lean'd to virtue's side." 
</P>
<P>
The roofless church at Alloway is a mere shell with small, oddly placed windows 
and a modest campanile. The interior is closed off by stout iron gates. Peering 
into the mossy gloom you'll see two iron catafalques, looking like medieval 
beds of torture, and above them a small, deeply cut window. 
</P>
<P>
Here is certainly the most famous window seat in literature -- the "winnock 
bunker," in which the devil himself perched, playing the bagpipes for the 
dancing witches in "Tam o' Shanter." 
</P>
<P>
As night fell slowly in Alloway churchyard I was half hoping to feel some kind 
of spooky tingle. I was alone but for the bats, owls and the serried ranks of 
the dead. Then I noticed a strange quality to the light around the church. The 
darker it grew, the more lurid the lights became. 
</P>
<P>
The distance from the church to the bridge is roughly 200 yards. Tam's route is 
easily traced. I walked back toward the hotel and turned left just before it. 
Rising majestically above the trees on the left is something that neither Tam 
nor Burns ever saw: the Alloway Monument, a three-sided, domed edifice in the 
Greek Style opened as a permanent memorial in 1823. 
</P>
<P>
The Monument maintains a small Burns museum where you can see originals of many 
poems and love letters he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
The beautifully maintained gardens contain statues of "Tam o' Shanter" and his 
best friend "Souter Johnnie." 
</P>
<P>
The road that leads past the Monument is Greenfield Road -- constructed by the 
poet's father. It parallels the river for a hundred yards or so before reaching 
the old bridge of Doon. 
</P>
<P>
Tam's eagerness to reach the bridge was understandable. It is a "universally 
known fact," wrote Burns in a letter, "that no diabolical power can pursue you 
across a runing stream." 
</P>
<P>
The old bridge has been restored to its original cobbled state. You can stand 
on the very spot, above the keystone, where the witch with the cutty sark 
caught the old mare by the tail. 
</P>
<P>
Burns finished his poem with an admonition that was surely directed at himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whene'er to drink you are inclin'd 
</P>
<P>
 or Cutty-sarks rin in your mind 
</P>
<P>
 Think! ye may buy the joys o'er dear 
</P>
<P>
 Remember Tam o' Shanter's meare." 
</P>
<P>
When you are leaning over the bridge wall with Kirk Alloway glowing in the 
trees, the words have an intimacy and freshness, as if written yesterday and 
spoken by a good friend. It's as if the author was leaning over the wall beside 
you, enjoying with you the dark blue of a Scottish midnight. 
</P>
<P>
To get to Alloway from Glasgow, take the A77 South to Ayr, then the B7024 
Ayr/Maybole road. Alloway is virtually a suburb of Ayr. 
</P>
<P>
Burns country has thousands of havens for the weary traveler, ranging from 
converted country mansions to farmhouse bed and breakfasts. In the countryside, 
it seems that every second farmhouse displays a B&amp;B sign. 
</P>
<P>
Farmhouse B&amp;Bs are an experience not to be missed. The hosts are almost 
always charming, and your breakfast menu of bacon, eggs and fresh milk often 
originates no more than a few yards from the dining room. 
</P>
<P>
The Burns Monument Hotel is the only hotel in Alloway proper. It's a short walk 
from Kirk-Alloway, the Burns Monument and the old Brig o' Doon. Burns Cottage 
is a mile and a half up the road. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel has nine rooms. Prices are per-person, breakfast included, and range 
from 28 to 48. If you stay from four to seven days, the price goes down 10%. 
Stay longer than eight days and you get a reduction of 20%. The hotel's food is 
excellent. 
</P>

The poor reputation of English cooking does not extend across the border into 
Scotland. Fresh local produce and centuries of cultural contact with France 
ensure that dining in Scotland can be a satisfying and civilized experience. 
</P>
<P>
Ayr offers a wide variety of cuisines. Most major hotels have good restaurants. 
Farmhouse breakfasts are justly famous. Fish-and-chip shops are everywhere, as 
are a startling number of East Indian restaurants. As a rule, avoid Chinese 
restaurants unless you are starving. 
</P>
<P>
If you want the true Burnsian feeling, The Stables Restaurant, Queens Court, 41 
Sandgate, Ayr, offers the kind of food that the Bard himself might have eaten 
-- dishes inspired by 17th- and 18th-Century recipes. 
</P>
<P>
Specialties include roast lamb with rowan and rosemary, venison and juniper 
pie, fresh Doon salmon and a number of items that must be tasted even to be 
understood, including Rumbledethumps, Cranachan, Hramsa and Dunsyre blue. 
</P>
<P>
Another restaurant famous for local cooking is Fouters Bistro, 2A Academy St., 
Ayr, offering Scottish produce cooked in the French style. Fish comes direct 
from Ayr harbor. Charbroiled beef is from Aberdeen Angus cattle, and guinea 
fowl and duck are locally reared.

THE SAVVY TRAVELER: SOME SHIPS' DOCTORS MAY NEED TO BE EXAMINED; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: CRUISE LINES MAY STRESS THAT THEY HAVE A DOCTOR ON BOARD, BUT IN SOME 
CASES THESE DOCTORS ARE IMPROPERLY TRAINED, IMPROPERLY LICENSED AND IMPROPERLY 
SUPERVISED.

<P>
How serious is the problem of obtaining competent, qualified medical care 
aboard cruise ships? 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, it's quite scary," claimed Charles Lipcon, a Miami-based personal 
injury lawyer specializing in admiralty law. "Most of the cruise lines boast 
that they have a doctor and an on-board clinic. But many of the cruise lines 
I've investigated have foreign doctors not licensed in the United States. And 
the ones I've looked at couldn't even get their licenses in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"Cruise passengers are misled. They think they're going to get good medical 
care on board, and they don't. Personally, I love cruising; I think it's a 
great vacation. I just don't ever want to get sick on board a ship." 
</P>
<P>
Lipcon is one of a number of Florida lawyers who specialize in handling 
wrongful death and injury cases involving cruise lines. He represents both 
passengers and crew members. 
</P>
<P>
Invariably, Lipcon's cases are settled out of court. Why? Some legal observers 
believe that the cruise lines settle these cases not just to avoid the undue 
publicity of a trial but to avoid setting legal precedent. 
</P>
<P>
Under current law, shipping companies are not liable for the conduct of the 
ship's doctor relative to the ship's passengers. The shipping company can be 
held liable for the crew, however. 
</P>
<P>
"This is where the cruise lines are misleading the public," Lipcon said. "In 
their brochures they boast of their doctors, put them in ship's uniforms, like 
the 'Love Boat,' but when something goes wrong, the cruise line claims that the 
doctor is an independent contractor and not an employee of the line." 
</P>
<P>
In recent court cases, investigators have discovered that some cruise ship 
doctors are improperly licensed, improperly trained and improperly supervised. 
These same doctors have been charged with improper record-keeping, 
misdiagnoses, prescribing the wrong medications and, in some cases with 
contributing to the deaths of passengers and crew members, deaths that might 
have been avoided. 
</P>
<P>
There are no published statistics (nor will any cruise line make them 
available) that indicate how many passengers get sick, or die, aboard cruise 
ships each year. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually," said Dr. Carter Hill, medical director for Holland America Lines, 
"the number is exceedingly low. But that doesn't mean we're not concerned about 
the problem of care aboard our ships." 
</P>
<P>
Holland America is one of the lines with a reputation for maintaining high 
medical standards for its ships' doctors. All Holland America doctors must be 
licensed in North America and trained in emergency medicine and family 
practice. A majority of them must be in active practice when not serving on the 
ship. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, each Holland America ship has three nurses (most ships have one). 
And, while there is no U.S. regulation requiring Holland America -- or any 
other cruise line -- to always have a doctor on board, it is corporate policy 
that no Holland America ship will sail without one. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had instances where a doctor was late getting to a ship," Hill said. 
"The ship waited." 
</P>
<P>
"Providing proper medical care has not been a problem for us," said Roderick 
McLeod, executive vice president of Royal Caribbean Cruises. "Traditionally, 
most of our medical cases involve sunburn, colds and the requisite amount of 
seasickness. Historically, most people don't get sick on cruise ships. If they 
did, we wouldn't be in business. 
</P>
<P>
"But industry-wide, medical care is a problem, because if one line looks bad, 
then we all look bad. On-board medical care is an area we pay strict attention 
to because it's the one area you can't afford to compromise. Our doctors are 
not only properly certificated but well-equipped for emergency medicine and 
trauma care. 
</P>
<P>
"Passengers need to be responsible, too. Some need to be reminded why they are 
traveling with us. They are taking a cruise vacation, not boarding a hospital 
ship to continue the treatment they received on land." 
</P>
<P>
Most cruise ship doctors are hired as independent contractors. With the 
exception of dispensing seasickness tablets, which is usually free, passengers 
pay the doctor -- not the cruise line -- for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Understandably, cruise lines try to protect themselves and limit their 
liability. Virtually every cruise ship brochure explicitly states that 
passengers with pre-existing medical problems or those requiring special 
medical treatment must disclose these conditions to the cruise line before 
boarding. The line then can refuse to accept these passengers, or require a 
liability waiver. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Royal Caribbean's McLeod argues that care "goes beyond the issue of a 
waiver or the facilities of any one ship. After all, no cruise ship is equipped 
with the resources of a hospital intensive care unit and most cruise ship 
doctors are usually at a disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
"In an emergency, they don't know the patient or his/her medical history," 
McLeod said. "They have to make a diagnosis based on the situation they're 
presented. 
</P>
<P>
"We strongly encourage each of our passengers to always travel with the name 
and telephone number of his or her personal physician, and also to carry a 
clear written record of any needed prescriptions or drug allergies. 
</P>
<P>
"In an emergency the ship's doctor can phone that physician over the marine 
satellite phone. It often makes a big difference in diagnosis and treatment." 
</P>
<P>
Holland America's Hill agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't do the proper job in encouraging travel agents to tell passengers how 
important this is," he said. "A lot of them don't discuss medical preparedness 
with their clients because they don't want to bring the subject up." 
</P>
<P>
"We always encourage travel agents to tell their clients about travel medical 
insurance," said Carnival Cruise Lines spokesman Tim Gallagher, "but most 
travel agents don't sell it. People just don't anticipate a medical problem on 
board cruise ships, and that's understandable. Statistically, very few people 
do get sick on board. 
</P>
<P>
"But passengers also need to know that the minute they leave the borders of the 
United States and sail into international waters, they are not covered by most 
insurance plans, including Medicare. We do recommend the extra insurance, 
especially the policies that cover medical evacuations." 
</P>
<P>
Such evacuations can be costly, ranging up from $5,000, a charge that is levied 
against the passenger. 
</P>
<P>
Carnival, like most cruise lines, offers a Cruise Vacation Protection Plan, 
which is described in its brochures. The insurance policy covers everything 
from trip cancellation and delay to medical expense and medical transportation.

JUST DROPPING IN FOR A FIELD DAY ON THE SLOPES

GOLD BRIDGE, Canada 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The helicopter took off, spraying a fine snow-dust on six skiers crouched in 
praying-mantis position on a mountain ridge, deep in the heart of British 
Columbia's Southern Chilcotin Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
It might as well have sprinkled us with stardust. Skiing would never be the 
same again. 
</P>
<P>
That was the day we became hooked on extraterrestrial skiing via Tyax Heli-ski. 
We had escaped to a world of lost horizons, silent snowscapes and untracked 
snow fields. 
</P>
<P>
Our launching pad for several days of this outer limits experience in skiing 
was the Tyax Wilderness Lodge, 124 miles north of Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
Once the clackety-clack-clack of the helicopter faded away, there was a mad 
scramble to find our skis while we were lowered by basket down one side of the 
helicopter into the snow. 
</P>
<P>
Transmitters which had been issued each skier were checked. This is the most 
important precaution for heli-skiing. 
</P>
<P>
The transceiver, which fits into the inside pocket of a ski parka or underneath 
sweaters, gives off a constant signal that can be picked up by the other 
transceivers when they are set to receive. 
</P>
<P>
All heli-skiers are briefed in its use. If a person is buried in an avalanche, 
he or she can be located by the other skiers in the group in a matter of 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Groups of seven to 13 skiers and a guide are transported by a Bell-212 
helicopter from the lodge to the skiing areas. Groups average 100,000 vertical 
feet of skiing per week. That is about 35 runs down Mammoth from the Cornice to 
Warming Hut I. 
</P>
<P>
At lunchtime, a wicker picnic basket comes from the tail of the helicopter and 
eating is at the bottom of a run, often near a glacial waterfall or beside a 
frozen lake. 
</P>
<P>
The same run is never skied twice. The helicopter lands on many remote mountain 
tops, and the band of skiers follows a guide down miles of untracked snow. 
There is such an adrenaline rush that you forget about the cold and the 
inevitable falls in the powder. 
</P>
<P>
There is nothing more on your mind than making the next turn down the 
mountainside. You own the Canadian mountains and all the snow for as far as 
those Vuarnet-shrouded eyes can see. You are hooked, and your ski life has 
changed forever. 
</P>
<P>
Tyax heli-skiers return each day to a lakeside wilderness lodge where fireside 
dinners and soaks in the sauna or Jacuzzi await. The Tyax Lodge has a 33-foot 
ceiling in the dining room and eiderdown comforters on beds in suites that have 
private balconies viewing the surrounding mountains, woods and lake. 
</P>
<P>
Each morning there's the smell of freshly baked bread from an oven built into 
the dining room fireplace. 
</P>
<P>
A Western-style bar off the dining room provides dancing and apres-ski talk, 
but the thought of tomorrow's ski adventures in the great unknown sends many to 
bed early. 
</P>
<P>
The lodge, with 28 guest suites, is the dream of Gus Abel, a former sea captain 
and wilderness guide, who teamed up with Swiss-Canadian businessman Urs 
Villiger to produce what skiers have been calling "the Deer Valley of 
helicopter skiing" since it opened two years ago. (The reference is to the 
elite ski resort of Deer Valley near Salt Lake City, Utah.) 
</P>
<P>
The lodge sits facing Lake Tyaughton, high in the wilds of Canada's coastal 
mountains. It is the largest log structure on Canada's west coast. 
</P>
<P>
Antiques from the area's gold mining days are on the walls but no paintings. 
The paintings couldn't compete with the views from the windows facing the 
10,000-foot mountains. 
</P>
<P>
To enjoy heli-skiing, people should be intermediate skiers or above and in good 
physical condition. The guides are prepared to assist skiers with their powder 
techniques. Groups are divided according to skiing ability. 
</P>
<P>
Three- and seven-day packages are available that include transportation to the 
remote lodge from Vancouver or Whistler Ski Resort, meals, accomodations, 
heli-guide and helicopter ski lift. Prices are $1,302 for the three-day package 
to $3,000 for the seven-day package. 
</P>
<P>
The heli-ski operating season is from January to May. If Tyax Lodge guests are 
reluctant to commit an entire stay to heli-skiing, a one-day introduction to 
heli-skiing is available for about $250 U.S. a day. 
</P>
<P>
The resort caters to family groups, and not everyone heli-skis. There are 
cross-country ski trails around the lake, toboggans, snowmobiles, children's 
sleds and ice-fishing equipment for use at no extra cost to lodge guests. 
Cross-country ski equipment can be rented for $13 per day. 
</P>
<P>
Heli-skiers may use the lodge's powder skis at no extra cost. Head guide and 
Tyax Heli-ski owner Mike Jakobsson recommends that heli-skiers who wish to 
bring their own equipment bring the skis they are most comfortable with. 
Another recommendation is that skiers bring soft luggage and limit themselves 
to 40 pounds as space is limited in the helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
On days when weather precludes helicopter flight, there is a nearby ghost town 
to explore. Near the town of Bralorne, buildings of the old Pioneer Mine stand 
abandoned after reigning more than 40 years as one of the largest gold 
producers in British Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
It is a trip back to another time to explore the ruins on cross-country skis 
and relive the glory days of Canada's Coast Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
For reservations for Tyax Heli-skiing, write P.O. Box 849, Whistler, B.C. VON 
1BO, or call (604) 932-7007. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Tyax Heli-skiing operation has its offices in the Delta Mountain Inn 
at Whistler Village, many skiers opt to combine a heli-ski vacation with lift 
skiing on Whistler and Blackcomb. 
</P>
<P>
The two mountains compose a mega-resort connected by a single base village. 
Blackcomb Mountain has North America's largest vertical drop -- one mile. 
</P>
<P>
The run is from the mountain's summit, called "Seventh Heaven," to its base. 
New to Whistler Mountain last year was a 10-passenger, high-speed gondola. 
</P>
<P>
The 18-minute ride that ends at the Roundhouse restaurant gives skiers access 
to five bowls at the top of Whistler Mountain and North America's 
second-largest vertical drop -- 5,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Scattered among the mountains are 29 lifts including T-bars, double chairlifts, 
triple chairlifts, covered quad chairlifts, a four-passenger gondola and the 
new 10-passsenger gondola. 
</P>
<P>
Daily lift tickets for Blackcomb Mountain are $29; for Whistler Mountain, $28. 
A three-day ticket for the two mountains is $88. 
</P>
<P>
Ski runs end at Whistler Village, a blending of Canadian materials and modern 
architecture built around pedestrian malls. The streets are not only for 
walking. People sing, dance and play musical instruments there on sunny 
afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
The last run of the ski day most often ends around a popular piano bar at the 
Nancy Green Lodge, where the day's adventures are relived to background music. 
</P>
<P>
Some recommended accommodations: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Delta Mountain Inn. Reservations: toll-free (800) 268-1133. A 
multi-storied modern lodge with restaurants, mountain shops, and health club. 
Rates: $115 to $120 for a standard double room per night. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Nancy Green Lodge. Reservations: (604) 932-2221. A European-type family-run 
lodge. The owner may take time out to ski with guests or explain some of the 
trophies on display from an impressive racing career that includes top Olympic 
and World Cup victories. Rates about $100 a night, double occupancy. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
Mexico's Riviera: A.J. of San Clemente asks for the name of a hotel "with 
atmosphere" in Zihuatanejo. This is the popular little Mexican village on the 
Pacific (near upscale Ixtapa). My bid goes to Hotel Sotovento. Overlooks Playa 
de la Ropa (an excellent beach). Hotel Catalina provides the same low-key 
atmosphere next door (same owners). Rates: $65/$70. On the beach, the Villa del 
Sol gets high marks (with considerably higher rates). You can fly direct from 
Los Angeles to Zihuatanejo. For hotel/airline reservations, contact your travel 
agent. Other details from the Mexican Government Tourist Office, 10100 Santa 
Monica Blvd., Suite 224, Los Angeles 90067. Telephone (213) 203-9335. 
</P>
<P>
A few notes on Zihuatanejo: The village is framed by the Sierra Madres, 150 
miles north of Acapulco. This is one of those jeans-and-T-shirt towns. Take a 
boat across the bay to Las Gatas Beach. Good sunbathing. Outdoor restaurants 
serve fresh fish. 
</P>
<P>
(I'm going back to Z soon for an update on this popular Mexico resort.) 
</P>
<P>
Arizona: We've had good reports on a new B&amp;B at Sedona called A Touch of 
Sedona. Four rooms with antiques and contemporary furnishings: the Eagle, the 
Kachina, the Hummingbird, the Roadrunner. Rates: $65/$75 with a full breakfast. 
Hosts are Dick and Doris Stevenson. Their inn is six blocks from the Old Town, 
only minutes from Oak Creek Canyon. Vacationers take in Tlaquepaque (40 shops 
featuring paintings, jewelry, etc.). Other visitors book Jeep tours into 
Sedona's back country (some of Arizona's finest scenery). 
</P>
<P>
A Touch of Sedona, 595 Jordan Road, Sedona, Ariz. 86336. Call (602) 282-6462. 
</P>
<P>
Note: Motorists driving from Phoenix can detour to Jerome, a lively old ghost 
town with loads of atmosphere. A couple of excellent restaurants (particularly 
the House of Joy) and a saloon that's been pouring spirits since 1885. 
</P>
<P>
Catalina: Speaking of B&amp;Bs, the Inn on Mt. Ada on Catalina Island grabbed 
off a four-star award from Mobil Travel Guide's inspectors. This is the 
original Wrigley mansion. Built in 1921, it's listed in the National Register 
of Historic Places. Magnificent views of the ocean/Avalon Bay. Not one of your 
ordinary run-of-the-mill B&amp;Bs. Dinner is served most evenings (snacks 
served throughout the day). Innkeepers Susie Griffin and Marlene McAdam provide 
complimentary golf carts for transportation to the village. Six guest rooms. 
Rates from $140. (If you want to party, you can rent the entire mansion for 
$1,800.) 
</P>
<P>
The Inn at Mt. Ada, P.O. Box 2560, Avalon 90704. Telephone (213) 510-2030. 
</P>
<P>
Country Vacations: The 40th-anniversary edition of Pat Dickerman's 224-page 
book, "Farm, Ranch &amp; Country Vacations," is available from the author. 
Filled with descriptions of destinations across the United States that provide 
riding, fishing, Jeep excursions, hay rides, square dancing. A chance for city 
kids to gather eggs, bottle-feed lambs, milk cows. Vacations that appeal to all 
ages. Besides farms, Dickerman lists dozens of dude ranches. Properties are 
scattered from New England to the Far West. 
</P>
<P>
Dickerman also publishes a newsletter. Send her a stamped, self-addressed 
envelope and she'll mail you a copy. The book sells for $12. Write to Pat 
Dickerman's Farm, Ranch &amp; Country Vacations, 36 East 57th St., New York 
10022, or call toll-free (800) 252-7899. 
</P>

Bus Bargain: Greyhound's advance-purchase requirement for its popular $68 
money-saver fare has been reduced to 14 days. Previously, passengers were asked 
to buy tickets 30 days before departure. Money-saver fares apply to more than 
10,000 destinations throughout the United States. One-way $68 fares are good 
for travel Monday through Thursday. Round-trip tickets: $118. What this means 
is that the passenger can travel with Greyhound from the West Coast to the East 
Coast for $68/$118 round trip. With airline fares on the rise, Greyhound 
reports a big increase in its passenger mileage. 
</P>
<P>
Rail Tour: A bargain for railroad buffs: A four-night tour to New Mexico for 
the Memorial Day weekend ($299). Passengers will leave Los Angeles' Union 
Station on a Thursday, returning the following Monday. The price includes the 
trip on Amtrak's Southwest Chief, accommodations at the Albuquerque Hilton, a 
welcome dinner, an all-day motor-coach excursion to Santa Fe (with a visit to

A BIRD IN THE LENS IS WORTH A NIGHT IN THE BLIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
TULE LAKE, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hunched in a makeshift photography blind, 70 feet from a roost tree, I aimed a 
camera with a 200-to-500-millimeter zoom lens at a group of about 15 bald 
eagles. 
</P>
<P>
It was snowing hard, and the snow was being blown into the blind. Every few 
minutes I had to turn the camera and clear snow out of the lens hood. 
</P>
<P>
The dawn temperature was about 11 degrees and, although well-layered, I began 
to shiver. Putting photography on hold, I took a swig of hot tea from a 
thermos. 
</P>
<P>
It had taken almost eight hours to drive the 360 miles from Oakland to Tule 
Lake in northeastern California, and almost two hours to climb the steep, 
snow-covered mile up to Sheepy Ridge in Tule Lake National Wildlife Refuge. 
</P>
<P>
But when you enjoy wildlife photography and you've lived most of your life on 
the East Coast and have never seen a bald eagle in the wild, you're motivated. 
</P>
<P>
So I picked up a set of chains for the car, rented the camera lens for a week, 
bought plenty of film and set off to see the largest concentration of wintering 
bald eagles in the lower 48 states. 
</P>
<P>
Eagles keep returning to Tule Lake because it's a funnel for huge numbers of 
waterfowl on the Pacific Flyway. Many waterfowl die from natural and man-made 
causes, providing easy pickings for the eagles. 
</P>
<P>
They prefer fish, but will gladly accept an easier meal -- a scavenging trait 
that caused Ben Franklin to object to making the bald eagle our national 
symbol. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, between December and March about 500 bald eagles journey annually 
from Alaska to the warmer and abundant feeding grounds of northeastern 
California and south-central Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
For 10 years the Audubon Society has sponsored an annual conference on the bald 
eagle that has drawn professional and amateur naturalists from throughout the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
The 11th annual Klamath Basin Bald Eagle Conference will be held in nearby 
Klamath Falls, Ore., in February. There will be workshops, a photo contest, 
field trips and a banquet. (Contact the Klamath Basin Audubon Society at 
503-883-5732 for registration information.) 
</P>
<P>
I was in the blind for about four hours. It was basically a rock structure 
covered with brush and canvas. Judging from its condition, it had also served 
as the supply depot for every rodent in the area. 
</P>
<P>
I had planned this photo expedition carefully, remembering film, (I prefer ASA 
64 to minimize grain, while giving enough speed to allow the use of faster 
shutter speeds to stop any action), an extra camera battery, a cable release, a 
tripod to support the long lens, a thermos of hot water, tea bags, food and 
warm gloves. 
</P>
<P>
The other thing I took, which in some ways was more important than any of the 
above, was information. 
</P>
<P>
The day before I had met a very helpful U.S. Forest Service ranger who pointed 
out the roost tree from the road that passes below Sheepy Ridge. 
</P>
<P>
A permit is required to use any of the photo blinds at Tule Lake (get one at 
the headquarters building the day before your excursion), which, in addition to 
the north and south blinds on Sheepy Ridge, include two other more accessible 
ones near the lake and a third area where tent blinds are permitted. 
</P>
<P>
During December, January and February, you have to be in the blinds before 7 
a.m. to minimize disturbance to the eagles. 
</P>
<P>
The blinds on Sheepy Ridge are by far the best vantage points. You'll be hiking 
in the dark, rising at least 1,000 feet on a trail you blaze yourself. Toting 
30-plus pounds of pack, it was no picnic. 
</P>
<P>
The snow was up to my knees in places and the rocks beneath could only be 
guessed at. 
</P>
<P>
It was a truly tough hike, and you should be in good physical condition before 
attempting it. 
</P>
<P>
The south blind is just right for one person, but as the refuge instruction 
sheet points out: "Two people can work from this blind, but you have to be 
friends." 
</P>
<P>
It is quite dark, so you may need a flashlight to read your meter and find your 
tea bags. And because the blind is nearly level with the top of the roost tree, 
the eagles can be sensitive to your presence. 
</P>
<P>
Because of this, the refuge staff advises against using a motor-drive camera 
and recommends at least a 300-millimeter lens. 
</P>
<P>
But I found that even a 500mm lens was not enough, and next time I'll try to 
rent a 600mm to fill more of the 35mm film frame. 
</P>
<P>
A fast lens with a maximum aperture of F/4 or wider is preferable but not 
absolutely necessary, because the birds are flying in and out of the area all 
day and the light is sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
But in the early morning and early evening a fast lens would be great. Such a 
lens would also allow you to use faster shutter speeds and slower film to catch 
any action, with less grain on the final slide or print. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the advice of the ranger, it took almost 30 minutes to find the blind 
once I reached the roost tree. It's very well camouflaged and tucked under a 
pine tree about 70 feet south of the tree. 
</P>
<P>
On the third day, I tried to find the other Sheepy Ridge blind but was 
unsuccessful. Again the ranger had pointed it out, but was, herself, mistaken 
in its location. 
</P>
<P>
The hike that day was particularly long and steep, and as it turned out, 
extremely frustrating. So check and recheck where the blinds are before making 
the climb. 
</P>
<P>
Remember, too, that since you'll be parking your car in the dark, on the day 
before you plan to photograph, mark the mileage from the refuge headquarters 
building to your photo site, as well as other landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
The blinds are just south of Hotel Rock, a monolith of crags and peaks the 
eagles perch upon as they survey the feeding grounds below. 
</P>
<P>
Whether you just drive around the refuge's auto route (where you'll also see 
several species of hawks, as well as herons, egrets, ring-necked pheasants and 
Canada geese, not to mention coyote and mule deer) or you make the trek up to 
Sheepy Ridge, you will see, and possibly photograph, bald eagles. 
</P>
<P>
And once you watch that magnificent bird in the wild, you may make this trip a 
yearly migration of your own. 
</P>
<P>
To get to the Tule Lake National Wildlife Refuge from Los Angeles take 
Interstate 5 north past Redding and Mt. Shasta to Weed, then take California 97 
north to 161 east. Drive until reaching Hill Road and the sign for the refuge 
headquarters to the right. 
</P>
<P>
Take Hill Road four miles to the headquarters on the right, just past East-West 
Road. The headquarters has an excellent interpretive museum, lots of 
information and a six-minute slide show. 
</P>
<P>
As for accommodations, there are two motels in the town of Tule Lake and 
several in the small city of Klamath Falls, Ore., about a 30-minute drive 
north. 
</P>
<P>
Also, there's a year-round campground in Lava Beds National Monument just south 
of the wildlife refuge.

THE TIMES SHOPPER: NEW YORK AND OLD CLOTHES MAKE FOR BARGAINS

<P>
Vintage clothes are a good buy in New York City, where top dealers offer a wide 
range of styles for a fraction of the cost of contemporary clothing. 
</P>
<P>
Harriet Love the most famous of the city's vintage stylists and author of 
"Guide to Vintage Chic" (Holt Rhinehart, 1982), set the standards for 
retro-chic fashion. Her shop at 412 W. Broadway in Soho is the leading showcase 
for this marriage of old and new. 
</P>
<P>
"When I began in 1965, I really focused exclusively on vintage clothing, much 
of it Victorian in look," Love said. "The '60s were the big costume era. But 
now customers have a more contemporary, practical vision and need. So I've 
become much more eclectic. This gives customers a lot of fashion options; they 
can merge the romance of the past with modern convenience." 
</P>
<P>
Love's shop is filled with merchandise that has been collected by 150 "pickers" 
-- buyers who scour the nation's yard sales, flea markets and estate closets 
for pieces that are not only of stylistic interest but in near-mint condition. 
The shop is small, and every square inch is used for display. 
</P>
<P>
Love usually shows 250 to 300 pieces of clothing bearing the labels of such 
designers as Worth, Hattie Carnegie, Schiaparelli. Stock changes constantly, 
but there are always '30s and '40s dresses ($125 to $175) with bold print 
designs, as well as a good selection of beaded blouses ($145 to $195), some 
with buttons down the back. A black cashmere Ballentine sweater with 
multicolored beading costs $175. 
</P>
<P>
Jackets are in rayon, gabardine and wool, and many have beading around the 
collar and cuffs. A mauve gabardine '40s jacket with a cinched waist, white 
buttons and some white beading on the collar costs $200, and is displayed with 
eggplant-colored silk pants ($112). 
</P>
<P>
The highly stylized jackets bearing the label of Lilli Ann of San Francisco are 
priced from $150. They include gabardines with satin piping, black velvet and 
black faille combinations and a jacket of black silk patterned with a 
turquoise-and-white design and lined with red silk. 
</P>
<P>
For men, there are fabulous '40s ties priced at $45 to $55, as well as terrific 
Hawaiian shirts, vintage '40s to '60s, priced at $125 to $250. 
</P>
<P>
Love is also known for her extraordinary collection of costume and estate 
jewelry. The shop has three showcases filled with about 1,000 pieces, ranging 
from men's cufflinks for $35 to a $600 pair of Victorian earrings in gold , 
emerald and pearl. 
</P>
<P>
There are also accessories, including Bakelite or beaded ($85 to $110) and 
alligator ($175 to $450) purses. The newer clothes in the shop include Mary 
Jane Mariafiano and Anne Mieke sweaters, Equipment shirts and Zelda jackets. 
</P>
<P>
Victoria Falls (451 W. Broadway, Soho), the shop belonging to designer and 
stylist Rina Gill, was founded in 1976 and created a craze for Victorian 
lingerie worn as street garb. The shop still features the Victorian romantic 
look, but now augments its stock of authentic turn-of-the-century linen and 
lace petticoats ($75 to $400), camisoles ($60 to $250) and nighties ($120 to 
$400), with Gill's own line of Victorian-look contemporary linen camisoles 
(from $90) to be worn with silk gabardine skirts and jackets (about $600 a 
suit). 
</P>
<P>
Both the originals and Gill's adaptations are delicate and delightful, ranging 
from the rather simple country look to elegant and sophisticated designs 
covered with embroidery. 
</P>
<P>
There is also a selection of exquisite high-neck, dropped-waist, gauzy, 
hem-stitched dresses dating to the turn of the century (from about $450), to be 
worn at weddings or fancy afternoon lawn parties, as well as beaded dresses 
from the '20s ($250 to $850). 
</P>
<P>
Accessories include antique hats, handbags (including a '40s alligator purse 
for $140 and a 1910 lacy crocheted silk wedding bag for $120) and 
handkerchiefs, vintage '30s and priced at $10 each. 
</P>
<P>
Liza's Place (132 Thompson St., Soho), now in its sixth year, specializes in 
vintage evening wear. This large shop shows all the fashion flair of its 
Brazilian owner. The place is painted a pleasant light lilac, and the stock -- 
about 800 pieces of clothing at any given time -- hangs on the walls or from 
the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
The clothes, in perfect condition and rather expensive, are the sort that might 
be seen in the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Collection. 
</P>
<P>
There are '20s flappers' dresses in gold and covered with beads (about $1,000), 
and dramatic turn-of-the-century capes in red velvet with gold trim (about 
$1,200), as well as a rich selection of wedding dresses from the 1900s through 
the 1930s, priced from about $1,200. 
</P>
<P>
Liza also has fabulous hats from the '20s, '30s and '40s and shoes (priced at 
about $250) from the '30s and '40s, plus fine silver jewelry by Chanel and 
Schiaparelli, from about $200 and up. 
</P>
<P>
Alice Underground (481 Broadway, Soho, and 380 Columbus Ave., Upper West Side) 
has rack after rack of women's '40s print rayon dresses (from $40), '50s cotton 
dresses (from $12) and vintage prom and party dresses, including tulles, 
failles and laces (from $25). 
</P>
<P>
Men's items include brocade smoking jackets and rayon robes (from $20), plus 
ties, jeans (from $6) and baggy trousers (from $15). There are also vintage 
leather flight jackets (from $125) and a vast selection of tweed jackets and 
coats (from $30). Stock changes constantly. New stock is usually put on the 
racks on Fridays. The merchandise is usually in good condition, but check 
carefully for rips, missing buttons and other damage before buying. 
</P>
<P>
Reminiscence (74 Fifth Ave., Greenwich Village) mixes inexpensive vintage 
clothes with its own line of moderately priced contemporary copies. The dresses 
include boldly patterned numbers with cap or no sleeves, square neck and circle 
skirt (priced from $12 to $100). 
</P>
<P>
Men's baggy pants in rayon and linen cost about $38 to $48. Men's '50s and '60s 
boxy tweed coats cost $28 to $70, and '50s raincoats are priced from $18. When 
the shop's supply of original '40s World War II era overalls, dyed in vibrant 
colors, were sold out, Reminiscence began to manufacture copies. These sell for 
$18. 
</P>
<P>
Off the tourist trail but promising for dedicated shoppers, Domsey's (431 Kent 
Ave., Williamsburg, Brooklyn) is a two-square-block repository of vintage and 
remaindered clothing. The store receives hundreds of thousands of pounds of 
clothing a week from charity drives and warehouse close-outs across the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Everything is dumped into bins and sold by weight ($2 to $3 per pound). Picking 
through the bins can be a challenge even for the most dedicated bargain hunter. 
</P>
<P>
Those with less stamina can shop in the adjacent four-floor Annex (the entrance 
is around the corner at 488 Whyte St.), where items are displayed on racks and 
have price tags ($2 to $15 per item). Be prepared to spend several hours 
sifting through miles of dresses, skirts, shirts, slacks, vests, suits, 
trousers and shoes that date from the '20s through the '70s and are not 
arranged by size. 
</P>
<P>
The search can be rewarded with superb buys, such as two-tone wing-tip men's 
shoes for $10 a pair or a stunning black wool '50s cocktail dress with cut-out 
back, in perfect condition, for $6. 
</P>
<P>
To get to Domsey's by subway, take the J, M or Z train to Marcy Avenue, then 
walk down Broadway toward the river until you reach Kent Avenue. Of course, 
what you save on clothes should easily cover the cost of a cab.

AN AUTO-MATIC WAY OF SEEING THE NETHERLANDS

<TEXT>
<P>
Much has been made of how easy it is to get around the Netherlands by train. 
It's true. 
</P>
<P>
But it's just as easy, and in many ways more rewarding, to see the country by 
car. 
</P>
<P>
Dutch roads are excellent and very well marked. Distances between sights are 
short, so that you can cover several areas in even a one-week visit. Most 
important, you have the option of stopping whenever you wish. 
</P>
<P>
Car travel in the Netherlands is especially rewarding during the spring tulip 
season. A suggestion: Follow the tulip trail on a weekday. Weekend traffic is 
slow going because every Amsterdamer is making the same jaunt. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest surprise to a foreign motorist in the Netherlands is how short the 
distances are made by expressways linking major cities. 
</P>
<P>
The two of us in our rental car took turns as navigator and pilot. We left the 
rental office at 9:15 a.m. with a detailed road map, planning a brief detour to 
Haarlem 15 miles west of Amsterdam. 
</P>
<P>
You might also arm yourself with "Tourist Menu Restaurants," a free Netherlands 
Board of Tourism booklet that lists restaurants throughout the country that 
offer specially priced tourist menus, with three-course dinners for about $9.95 
per person. 
</P>
<P>
It took only 20 minutes from central Amsterdam over a super-fast highway. Then 
we discovered that the Franz Hals Museum didn't open until 11 a.m., giving us 
more than an hour to wander through Haarlem, browse for antiques along Kleine 
Houtstraat and wander through the Great Market and the 14th-Century cathedral, 
the Church of St. Bavo. 
</P>
<P>
We even discovered a new museum, the Corrie Ten Boom House, used by a Dutch 
Christian family as a hiding place for Jews and Nazi refugees during World War 
II. 
</P>
<P>
The Franz Hals Museum in a 17th-Century almshouse was well worth the wait. In 
addition to many paintings by Hals it has fine works by other 17th-Century 
Dutch masters. A quick lunch in the museum's coffee shop and we were on the 
road again. 
</P>
<P>
It was a brief drive on N208 to the turn-off to Lisse and the Keukenhof flower 
garden. Along the side roads we stopped to photograph brilliant red, yellow and 
purple tulip fields. Keukenhof was a feast of color, with beautifully 
landscaped flower beds full of bulbs we had never seen. A devout gardener could 
spend an entire day wandering the 70-acre parkland, gardens and greenhouses. 
</P>
<P>
Later we cruised through Leiden for a once-over-lightly precis of the old 
university town's cobbled streets, canals and red tile-roofed buildings before 
returning to the E19 and continuing south. 
</P>
<P>
We spent our first night at the Delta Hotel on a waterway in Vlaardingen, a 
suburb west of Rotterdam. The eye level close view of ships cruising up the 
waterway, visible from the dining room, lounge and bedrooms, made up for the 
hotel's rather pedestrian food. 
</P>
<P>
Our second day began with Delft (just off a major artery, E19), a town 
interlaced with canals and so post-card pretty that it seems almost unreal. 
Delft has ancient churches, but its principal charm is its Dutch village 
character. 
</P>
<P>
You can spend hours just walking over canal bridges and sitting at a sidewalk 
cafe on Markt Square with its 14th-Century Nieuwe Kerk (New Church), or 
shopping for the famous Delft china. Delft has two four-star hotels, the De Ark 
and Museumhotel, and several fine restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
From Delft we headed east on E19, avoiding Rotterdam's industrial center, to 
the Lek River, a narrow scenic waterway dotted with 19 windmills, one of which 
is open as the Kinderdijk Windmill Museum. By late afternoon we reached Gouda, 
a short hop off a main superhighway, E25. 
</P>
<P>
With its Market Square, Gothic town hall, stone churches, canals and cheese 
shops, Gouda is another quintessential Dutch town. Its market days -- Thursday 
and Saturday -- are especially colorful. 
</P>
<P>
North of Utrecht we stayed at at the Hotel Residence Vinkeveen, again with 
views of canals. We found several very good restaurants; our dinner at the 
French Buitenlust was one of the best during our trip. 
</P>
<P>
The final day we backtracked to Utrecht to visit the Catharijne Convent Museum, 
with its European medieval art in a 17th-Century convent. 
</P>
<P>
We spent our last night at the Apollo Hotel near the Amsterdam outskirts, in 
order to drive with ease to Schiphol Airport for our departure the following 
day. 
</P>
<P>
It was a tulip tour with lasting memories. 
</P>
<P>
 Major U.S. rental car agencies have Amsterdam offices, as do many local Dutch 
agencies. The best current Avis deal is a five- to seven-day rate of $244 (plus 
18 1/2% tax) on a two-door, stick-shift Ford Fiesta with unlimited mileage and 
all liability insurance included, to be booked in the United States with at 
least two days' advance notice. Call toll-free (800) 331-1212. 
</P>
<P>
If you book two weeks ahead, you receive a free Avis Travel Planner, 35 pages 
of detailed driving directions, offbeat locations, recommended routes and 
helpful hotel and restaurant suggestions.

THE MATURE TRAVELER: NO GAMBLE FOR TOURISTS ON THIS NEVADA ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL HUGHES, Hughes is a 30-year veteran travel writer living in Sherman 
Oaks. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
ELY, Nev. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The search for new tour destinations for mature travelers had brought Bill 
Siefke to an old two-lane highway straddling Robinson Summit, just west of 
here. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll love it," Siefke said. "It's got everything . . . great scenery, 
history and a dash of adventure. Add a stop at the new national park and toss 
in a casino resort, and I'll bet we can still do a six-day motor coach from Los 
Angeles for under $400." 
</P>
<P>
The road Siefke was referring to was U.S. 50, the Nevada portion of the old 
Lincoln Highway, the nation's first transcontinental highway. 
</P>
<P>
From the 7,606-foot-high pass we could see for miles in either direction. There 
was hardly another vehicle in sight on the bright, sunny afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"A few years ago Life magazine called this the 'loneliest road in America,' " 
Siefke said. "The article said Route 50 had no tourist attractions and so few 
highway facilities that drivers needed survival skills to travel the route. 
</P>
<P>
"They were wrong about no tourist attractions, or at least they simply didn't 
have their eyes open. This is one of the most scenic, most historic routes in 
the West. And sure, tourist facilities are still on the short side. But for a 
self-contained motor-coach tour, it's a fantastic trip." 
</P>
<P>
After checking out the route with Siefke, I agreed. Not only is it one of the 
most historic corridors of the West -- it roughly follows the old Pony Express 
route and the old Overland Stagecoach tracks -- but it's a terrific drive. 
</P>
<P>
From Fallon, U.S. 50 provides an easy-to-take route over Nevada's corrugated 
terrain of mountain ranges and broad valleys, a seemingly endless and 
constantly changing panorama of shapes and colors. You pass through or skirt 
close by more than 20 of Nevada's 140 mountain ranges. 
</P>
<P>
Add in the vivid colors of the mountains, the golden sage and aspen against the 
green willows and cottonwoods, and it's downright poetic. 
</P>
<P>
You still see very few cars. Even fewer people. Those you do see are apt to be 
cowboys out looking for cattle that roam free over the open range. 
</P>
<P>
Folks in small towns such as Austin, Eureka and Ely (pronounced E-lee) seem 
delighted when people drop in for a visit. The Nevada Commission on Tourism has 
passed out 25,000 tongue-in-cheek "Highway 50 Survival Kits" to adventurous 
visitors. 
</P>
<P>
Among notable sights are Sand Mountain, an unexpected 600-foot sand dune a 
half-hour's drive east of Fallon. Constantly changing in size and shape from 
prevailing winds, it was known to early pioneers as "Singing Sands" due to the 
humming sound of the wind over the sand at sundown. 
</P>
<P>
There are ruins of old Pony Express stations, where almost 130 years ago young 
riders dashed in and out on their 10-day, 1,800-mile ride from St. Joseph, Mo., 
to Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
In Austin, in addition to three century-old restored churches that once served 
miners, there's an architectural oddity called Stokes Castle. The three-story 
Roman villa was built from local stone by the wealthy and eccentric Anson 
Phelps Stokes, who lived there just one summer. 
</P>
<P>
Ely is 10 times bigger than Eureka and Austin, with about 5,000 residents. The 
historic copper-mining town lacks the laid-back charm of Eureka and Austin, but 
makes up for it with more motels and restaurants and several small casinos. 
</P>
<P>
There are many smaller motels in Ely, the best of which are the Jailhouse Motel 
and Casino (which features a pleasant dining room where you dine in "cells") 
and the Copper Queen, a well-operated 64-room facility with a casino and the 
area's best dining in its restaurant across the street. 
</P>
<P>
Top attraction in Ely is the great Nevada Northern Railway, which features a 
beautifully restored 1909 depot, roundhouse and machine shops, in addition to 
vintage rolling stock. Tours are available for $1, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily from 
Memorial Day to late September. 
</P>
<P>
But the big treat is a 90-minute ride on one of the best-preserved shortline 
railroads in the country. During summer, excursions are provided mostly by 
diesel-powered engines, and on special occasions by the grand old 10-wheel 
steam engine known as the Ghost Train. 
</P>
<P>
From Ely it's another 90-minute scenic drive on U.S. 50 to America's newest -- 
and Nevada's only -- national park. Great Basin National Park is 77,100 acres 
of magnificent scenery, both above and below ground. 
</P>
<P>
The park is capped by 13,063-foot Wheeler Peak. On the mountain's slopes are 
ancient bristlecone pines and gnarled small trees more than 3,000 years old. 
There's an easy-to-handle, 12-mile scenic drive to view Wheeler Peak that 
reaches the 10,000-foot level. 
</P>
<P>
For most visitors the highlight of the park is underground in Lehman Caves, an 
extensive series of formation-filled limestone caverns than can be seen on a 
well-illuminated and guided 90-minute tour. 
</P>
<P>
Admission to Great Basin National Park is free, but there is a $3 charge for 
the cave tour, $1.50 for Golden Age Passport holders of age 62 or over. (Siefke 
says he has made the cave tour an option on his tour, especially for seniors, 
some of whom might find the half-mile, 10-stairway hike a bit strenuous.) 
</P>
<P>
Siefke, of Pasadena's Great Western Tours &amp; Travel, has put all of these 
U.S. 50 attractions into his tour and added others. There's a two-night stay in 
the Carson Valley Inn at Minden just south of Carson City, and still more 
sightseeing in the Nevada capital, as well as historic Genoa nearby. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to two nights at the Cooper Queen in Ely, the six-day tour includes 
an overnight at the 815-room Peppermill Resort and Casino in Mesquite. The 
resort has long been popular with senior tour groups. 
</P>
<P>
Ten departures are planned for Great Western's six-day motor-coach tour, 
starting in early June and running into mid-October. Cost is $398 per person, 
double ($498 single), with nine meals, including a barbecue dinner and show at 
the Spirit Ranch in Carson Valley and a "survival" dinner at the Peppermill. 
For more information, call toll-free (800) 344-7090 or (818) 578-1161. 
</P>
<P>
If you prefer to see the "loneliest road in America" on your own, you can 
easily enjoyed it by car or RV on a four- to six-day jaunt from Los Angeles. 
Information is available from the Nevada Commission on Tourism by calling 
toll-free (800) 237-0774.

TRAVEL VIDEOS: A TRIP TO HAWAII WITHOUT LEAVING YOUR CHAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY MARTIN, Martin is a former staff member of the Travel Section. Her 
column on travel videos appears monthly. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Switch on your VCR and join us on a journey to Hawaii that could take days in 
person. 
</P>
<P>
On this armchair trip we'll eavesdrop on the major islands and sneak a glimpse 
of developing attractions on Molokai. 
</P>
<P>
So roll the tape. 
</P>
<P>
"HAWAII" (Rand McNally VideoTrips, Best Films and Video Corp., 55 minutes, 
1986). This is a noble effort to show the highlights of the four major islands 
of Hawaii -- Oahu, Kauai, Maui and the Big Island of Hawaii, plus a brief 
overview of Molokai -- in less than an hour. Some attractions are given just a 
brief glance, but the good film quality and narration sprinkled with humor, 
legend and history make it a pleasant hour for the armchair traveler and a 
helpful tool for the first-time visitor. 
</P>
<P>
Oahu, the most-visited island, is shown first with familiar scenes of crowded, 
high-rise Honolulu and Waikiki Beach, "where boy meets girl, grandmas meet the 
hula and middle-aged men suffer through days of holding their stomachs in." 
Other sights include Diamond Head, Iolani Palace (the only royal palace in the 
United States), Bishop Museum, Punchbowl Cemetery, Sea Life Park and the U.S.S. 
Arizona Memorial at Pearl Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
A drive across the island takes viewers to visit the Polynesian Cultural 
Center, the North Shore surfing beaches and Waimea Falls Park. Throughout, 
there are the requisite scenes of shoppers and souvenirs, luaus, hula dancing 
and night life. Information is given on many golf courses and their 
availability. 
</P>
<P>
Kauai, the Garden Isle, with more than 400 inches of rain a year on its peaks, 
is the most verdant of the islands. The video visits three major resort areas 
-- Poipu/Lihue, Wailua/Kapaa and Princeville/Hanalei -- and takes a helicopter 
ride through "the Grand Canyon of the Pacific," magnificent Waimea Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Other highlights include a boat ride on the Wailua River to the Fern Grotto, a 
stop at Kokee State Park, Kilauae Lighthouse and aerial views of the isolated 
beaches along the majestic Na Pali Coast. 
</P>
<P>
Maui offers still another face of Hawaii. Most of the action is in the historic 
whaling town of Lahaina. Low-rise shops, restaurants and discos line the main 
street. Other sights include the Pioneer Inn, built in 1901; the old whaling 
ship, Carthaginian II, with its small museum, and the Whaler's Marketplace. The 
Lahaina &amp; Pacific Railroad, a restored relic of the sugar-cane era, is 
shown carrying passengers six miles to the high-rise hotels at Kaanapali. 
</P>
<P>
Viewers visit beautiful gardens and accompany bike riders down the side of the 
dormant volcano, Mt. Haleakala. They also drive past the Iao Needle and visit 
the town of Hana and the nearby Seven Sacred Pools. Lahaina also is where 
viewers take off for a brief visit to Molokai. 
</P>
<P>
The Big Island of Hawaii combines a bit of everything found on the other 
islands, plus a few extras of its own: active volcanoes, mountains with snow 
for skiing and Porter Ranch, the largest privately owned cattle ranch in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Other sights include a visit to orchid gardens, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, 
black-sand beaches and a marlin fishing trip. Across the island at Kailua-Kona 
there are stops at the King Kamehameha Royal Compound and a drive along the 
Kona Coast to the Capt. James Cook Monument. 
</P>
<P>
The final segment of the video is a roundup of travel information on 
transportation, weather and accommodations. The film shows a selection of 
hotels, with descriptions of their special features. These are not paid 
commercials. Though of little concern to the armchair traveler, trip planners 
should be reminded that these hotel selections were made in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Tapes are available from Best Films and Video Corp., P.O. Box 1179, Gillette, 
Wyo. 82716, toll-free (800) 248-7477. Price: $19.99. 
</P>
<P>
"HAWAII" (Fodor's Video Travel Guide, 1988, 75 minutes). Fodor's video format 
follows the style of its travel guidebooks. 
</P>
<P>
The first of three segments (about one-third of the video) is a typical 
travelogue giving the viewer a look at many of the islands' popular tourist 
attractions. Most can be seen in any video on Hawaii, including Rand McNally's 
"Hawaii" (see above). 
</P>
<P>
What makes this video different is that it emphasizes practical information 
provided by authorities in the field. It gives tips on such things as the care 
of valuables, exchange rates, use of credit cards and traveler's checks. 
Another segment helps business people master communications devices such as fax 
machines and telexes. This is followed by facts on weather, clothes, 
inter-island transportation, package tours and photo opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the information provided is general to all Fodor videos and not 
applicable in this case. For example, railroad information provided is 
irrelevant as Hawaii has no railroad system. 
</P>
<P>
The video concludes with an extensive guide to hotels, from moderate to 
super-deluxe. The list provides hotel location and information on amenities 
such as restaurants, wheelchair access and pools. These are not paid 
commercials. 
</P>
<P>
Also provided is a helpful pocket guide that indexes items on the videotape. It 
contains maps and a glossary of Hawaiian terms. 
</P>
<P>
Tapes are available from Doro's Video Guides, Random House Inc., Order Entry 
Department, 400 Hahn Road, Westminster, Md. 21157. Call toll-free (800) 
733-3000. Price: $19.95. 
</P>
<P>
"DESTINATION MOLOKAI" (Destination Molokai Assn., 15 minutes, 1989). The beauty 
and attractions of the relatively undeveloped Hawaiian island of Molokai are 
given comprehensive, if brief, coverage in this tourist promotion video. For 
travel planners, the narration provides information on transportation to and on 
the island, and maps locate the principal sites. (Note: Air Molokai has 
discontinued service since the video was filmed.) 
</P>
<P>
There are scenes of lush tropical foliage, waterfalls, nearly deserted beaches, 
open plains and aerial views along the 3,330-foot sea cliffs, the world's 
highest. 
</P>
<P>
Viewers also are shown a selection of hotels, cottages, inns and condominiums, 
given information on their amenities as well as some of the activities 
available. These include helicopter tours, boat cruises, horseback rides, a 
mule ride down to Father Damien's old leper colony on Kalaupapa Peninsula and a 
hike to Hawaii's tallest waterfall in the lovely Halawa Valley, where trekkers 
cool off in the pool at the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
Other sights covered are the 13th-Century fish ponds, the royal coconut grove, 
petroglyphs, a macadamia nut farm and Molokai Ranch Wildlife Park. 
</P>
<P>
The video concludes with a quick tour of the main street of Kaunakakai, 
Molokai's largest town. 
</P>
<P>
The film quality is very good and the video is a useful source of information 
for those considering a visit to Molokai, "The Friendly Isle." 
</P>
<P>
Tapes are available from Destination Molokai, 1600 Kapiolani Blvd., Suite 923, 
Honolulu, Hawaii 96814, (800) 367-4753. Price: $9.95.

Feodor Mikhailovich Dostoevski came here last century to "take the waters," but

Founded in about 80 AD by the Romans, Baden-Baden began to attract European 
royalty to its waters in the late 18th Century. By the time Germany became a 
unified state in 1871, the fetching little village had become a bastion of the 
belle epoque, and was known as Europe's summer residence of the rich. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Baden-Baden has maintained its status as one of the continent's 
most elegant and luxurious small resorts, a place where the "beautiful people" 
try to stay that way. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from the curative baths and drinking waters, Baden-Baden has much to 
recommend it. It sits in a garland of vineyards and wine villages; there's a 
horse racing track on the edge of town; Black Forest day-trips are popular, and 
the casino is open all night, taking bets of from $3 to $30,000 on just about 
any game of chance imaginable. 
</P>
<P>
Getting here: Fly Lufthansa or Delta into Munich, Lufthansa or one of several 
American carriers into Frankfurt. From either city it's a train ride to 
Baden-Baden. Air France will get you to Strasbourg, just 35 minutes across the 
Rhine from Baden-Baden. 
</P>
<P>
How long/how much? A couple of days will do for the town, unless you're here 
for spa treatments or are using Baden-Baden as a base for seeing the Black 
Forest. Lodging-dining costs run from high moderate to expensive. 
</P>
<P>
A few fast facts: The deutsche mark recently traded at 59 cents, about 1.69 to 
the dollar. Baden-Baden is protected from harsh weather by surrounding small 
mountains, so the season runs from Easter until late November, with skiing in 
the Black Forest during winter. 
</P>
<P>
Getting settled in: Der Quellenhof (Sophienstrasse 27; $115 low-season B&amp;B 
double, $136 high) is a contemporary hotel in the middle of town near most of 
the spas, and a member of the Best Western chain. It has all the big-hotel 
amenities, two restaurants (one vegetarian) and, while bedrooms are modern, the 
restaurants and public areas pick up a colorful feeling of the Black Forest. 
</P>
<P>
Gasthaus zum Adler (Klosterbergstrasse 15; $65 B&amp;B double) sits outside 
town in the pretty wine village of Varnhalt, overlooking rolling vineyards. 
It's a traditional house with a great deal of warmth. Typical gasthaus bedrooms 
have fluffy feather beds, cheerful blue curtains, showers only. There's a TV 
lounge for guests. 
</P>
<P>
Der Kleine Prinz (Lichtentalerstrasse 36; $118 to $162 B&amp;B double) is a 
little jewel set in a century-old building at the heart of town. While it has 
been open only four years, the elegant traditional furnishings create a 
boutique-hotel atmosphere that's very inviting and luxurious. Service is 
outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
Regional food and drink: Freshwater fish are more than plentiful in these 
parts, with brook trout a particular favorite. Hechtklosschen is a delicious 
croquette made of pike and noodles, served with a Riesling or dill sauce. Local 
kitchens also do marvelous fresh herb soups. 
</P>
<P>
With the Black Forest at hand, you'll usually find venison on menus, frequently 
pheasant. Rehrucken, Black Forest-style, is a saddle of venison larded with 
bacon and served in a cream sauce with mushrooms, cranberries and noodles. And 
the Schwartzwalder kirschtorte (Black Forest torte) is a cherry tart loaded 
with chocolate, cherry brandy, cream and butter. 
</P>
<P>
Riesling wines are the choice here, while kirsch is a sneaky cherry schnapps to 
reckon with. 
</P>
<P>
Dining well: Das Susse Lochel (center of town) has been a popular cellar 
restaurant since 1831, turning out typical regional food such as venison 
medallions with mushroom-stuffed crepes, turbot in a creamed paprika sauce and 
a superb gemuseplatte (vegetable plate). The atmosphere is intimate and 
charming; dried wildflowers on tables, huge fireplace, rustic regional 
furniture. 
</P>
<P>
Gasthaus Adler (Varnhalt) draws a loyal crowd of locals for its great food and 
terrace views of the vineyards. Try the venison ragout with a juniper-cream 
sauce, red cabbage and homemade noodles; trout poached in Riesling, or pork 
tenderloin with mushrooms, grapes and cherries. Gasthaus Adler has the flavor 
of the Black Forest, with an English menu to help you along. 
</P>
<P>
Munchner Lowenbrau at the center of town just as surely captures the Munich 
spirit with its simple furnishings, meandering rooms and tree-shaded, outdoor 
beer garden. The menu whisks you to Bavaria with lots of sausages, hearty 
soups, kraut, liver dumplings and grilled pork knuckles. You'll also find the 
delectable Munchner weisswurst, served with sweet mustard, great breads and a 
frosty Lowenbrau. 
</P>
<P>
Going first-class: Brenner's Park Hotel (Lichtentaler Allee; $118-$407 double, 
low season, $130-$443 high) has ranked as one of Europe's most beautiful and 
luxurious hotels for more than a century. 
</P>
<P>
It's known for the tranquillity of its garden, appointments and indoor pools, 
dining and Brenner's Spa treatments. The spa's seven-day beauty and health 
regimen costs about $2,200. 
</P>
<P>
On your own: Jump right into the better-health scene and take the waters at 
Caracalla Therme's (Roman Emperor Caracalla came to Baden-Baden to cure his 
rheumatism) seven pools and saunas. Or step next door to Friedrichsbad, built 
in 1869, for a 15-stage treatment. Then stop in the Trinkhalle (drinking hall) 
and let a few glasses of the magical waters work their wonders. 
</P>
<P>
Lichtentaler Allee along the River Oos is probably one of the continent's most 
delightful promenades, with oaks, magnolias, silver poplars and tulip trees in 
profusion. 
</P>
<P>
Sporting types will find bliss and perhaps a bit of luck in the palatial Casino 
Baden-Baden, where the sparkling chandeliers, gilded ceilings and statuary, 
mirrored halls and lush carpeting have earned it acclaim as the world's most 
beautiful gaming house.

HER WORLD: HOW TO SPICE UP A TRIP TO SANTA FE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH MORGAN, Morgan, of La Jolla, is a magazine and newspaper writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The handsome native in the long black braid carefully slit the side of the 
Fritos bag. She poured freshly made hot chili inside and topped it with grated 
Longhorn cheese. 
</P>
<P>
She handed the concoction -- with napkins and a plastic spoon -- over the 
counter to me and said: 
</P>
<P>
"That's a Frito pie. You haven't been in Santa Fe until you've had one." 
</P>
<P>
This was at the Woolworth store by the Santa Fe plaza, one of the great 
five-and-dime locations in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Take-away Frito pie originated here more than 40 years ago, a local told me. 
The tradition is to sit on a park bench in the plaza and enjoy the treat. But 
the chili is spicy with peppers. It's smart to pick up a cold drink from 
Woolworth's soda fountain. 
</P>
<P>
Store Manager Gary Anderson said that the Woolworth chain tried the recipe in 
other stores but it didn't catch on. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be in the right place for it and Santa Fe is the place," he said 
with a smile. "In summertime we sell 400 Frito pies a day. In winter, maybe 50 
to 100." 
</P>
<P>
Though Frito pie is an oddball favorite, there is splendid subtlety to the 
native New Mexican cuisine that thrives in about half of Santa Fe's plentiful 
restaurants and cafes. 
</P>
<P>
The fire is there, thanks to fresh salsas of red and green chile peppers, but 
also a robust earthiness from the good tastes of blue corn tortillas, roasted 
pinon nuts and a hominy stew called posole. 
</P>
<P>
Even if Santa Fe did not boast lavish history, scenery, art and music, the 
dining experience -- at 7,000 feet -- would be reason enough to visit this 
charmer among state capitals. 
</P>
<P>
New Mexican cooking is based on the chile pepper, but the culinary influences 
are a mix of Spanish, Mexican and American Indian. Dishes in Santa Fe may be 
ordered with either red or green chiles. Some who want both say "Christmas." If 
you want the milder chiles, ask when you order. On any day the red chiles may 
be hotter or milder than the green. 
</P>
<P>
My favorite lunch, on a recent day when snow crunched underfoot, was at The 
Shed in a courtyard off Palace Street, just steps from the Plaza. I ordered No. 
11, I think it was, a blue-corn enchilada and a taco in a wondrous sauce. There 
was nothing on the menu that did not tempt me. 
</P>
<P>
The Shed is a simple huddle of adobe rooms, painted in bold pink and blue and 
lime green. It is lunch only and no reservations, thus lines can grow long. 
</P>
<P>
A notice to customers is printed on the menu: "We are a very small restaurant. 
We are not competing with mass-produced food. We are sorry that we are 
sometimes unable to accommodate you, but we are determined not to permit the 
wildly increasing demand to affect the quality of our cooking." 
</P>
<P>
Another splendid destination for New Mexican cuisine is La Tertulia, in a 
converted convent on Agua Fria, just across from the Santuario de Guadalupe. 
The many-roomed atmosphere of this family shrine is as remarkable as the chiles 
rellenos. 
</P>
<P>
Since I was last in Santa Fe, the Pink Adobe, on the Old Santa Fe Trail, has 
added a nonsmoking dining room to its adobe warren. This room was thick with 
Santa Fe leaders when I dropped in for lunch. They were at home -- and looked 
it -- in their handsome sweaters and open shirts and jeans. They were ordering 
tamales and Pink Adobe burgers. 
</P>
<P>
Locals also swear by Josie's Casa de Comida on Marcy Street and Tomasita's Cafe 
in the old Denver &amp; Rio Grande railroad station on Guadalupe Street. Both 
brag of their sopaipillas, those fluffy pillows of fried bread. 
</P>
<P>
Hearty breakfasts are a Santa Fe tradition. The best may be the Santa Fe omelet 
or a breakfast burrito at Tecolote Cafe on Cerillos Road. For a simpler 
pastry-and-coffee start I like the Palace Bakery (under the purple Haagen-Dazs 
sign) across from the Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
On a day when one New Mexican meal is enough, you can break out for elegant 
pasta or fish at the handsome Santacafe, in a 200-year-old hacienda on 
Washington Avenue. Or go for a New York steak at The Palace. 
</P>
<P>
The most extraordinary dining experience I had in Santa Fe was on my last 
night, when friends took me to Vanessie on West San Francisco Street, a 
relative newcomer known for grilled steak, chicken or fish. 
</P>
<P>
We arrived at 6 p.m. to avoid the crush, and found a place to park not far from 
the door. The restaurant had a wonderful aroma and fine music. The lighting was 
subdued. 
</P>
<P>
But what was that blonde doing crouched on the bar? And why was the piano laden 
with votive candles? As for the upturned chairs . . . 
</P>
<P>
A man came from the next room to greet us. He explained that the restaurant was 
closed for two nights of refurbishing. 
</P>
<P>
The music was from a workman's tape. The girl on the bar was polishing the 
rail. 
</P>
<P>
The aroma that I loved was varnish.

DRAWING FINE POLITICAL LINES FOR EUROPE'S FUTURE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Whatever the evolution of Germany, existing security arrangements based on the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact are eroding. The 
collapse of Soviet power in Central Europe coincides with a declining fear in 
the Western democracies of military threat. Hence, President Bush's proposal to 
reduce superpower troops on the Continent. 
</P>
<P>
One political approach is to accelerate arms-control negotiations. But 
upheavals in Europe have not only overthrown communist regimes but also some of 
the premises of traditional arms-control theory. The attempt to negotiate a 
balance on both sides of the existing military line in the center of Germany is 
no longer realistic. When the current stage of conventional-arms negotiations 
began, the military and political demarcation lines were identical. And because 
the current stage of negotiation is confined to thinning out U.S. and Soviet 
forces, it does not depend so critically on the location of dividing lines. 
When that negotiation is completed, attention must turn to designing 
comprehensive security systems. Then a fact must be faced: Military and 
political dividing lines are no longer congruent. The military line runs 
through Germany; the political one is located at the Soviet-Polish frontier. 
</P>
<P>
A line through the center of Germany can no longer be appropriate after the two 
German states have held elections later this year. Two democratic states 
drawing ever closer together, governed by parties professing comparable 
ideologies, cannot possibly belong to two opposing alliance systems for any 
length of time. Such an incongruity would make the West -- in the name of arms 
control -- a partner in the division of Germany and put at risk Germany's 
pro-Western orientation. 
</P>
<P>
The simplest approach would be to move the dividing line for European 
arms-control arrangements from the frontier between the two German states to 
the German-Polish frontier. The obstacle is that nations of Eastern Europe 
would be extremely reluctant to be grouped with the Soviet Union. NATO and the 
Warsaw Pact are simply not symmetrical institutions today -- if they ever were. 
The Warsaw Pact has lost military rationale and will lose political purpose 
with the advent of democratic governments. 
</P>
<P>
How can symmetrical force levels be established along a dividing line that 
includes Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary, which have already demanded 
withdrawal of Soviet forces? Must NATO be dismantled to keep pace with 
disintegration of the Warsaw Pact? That would turn pact weakness into a 
rationalization for dissolving NATO -- a goal the Warsaw Pact failed to achieve 
when it was still relatively cohesive. 
</P>
<P>
In future arms-control negotiations, the United States must not legitimize a 
larger Soviet military presence in Central Europe than the Soviet Union could 
maintain on its own. At the same time it must not encourage the impression that 
a complete Soviet withdrawal will have to be matched by a complete American 
withdrawal from Europe. Geographic proximity enables the Soviet Union to be a 
major military factor in Central Europe, while an American withdrawal across 
the Atlantic would destroy the possibility of a balance of power on the 
Continent. 
</P>
<P>
A new European security system should reassure the Soviet Union with respect to 
its historic nightmare of invasion from the West; ease Western Europe's fear of 
Soviet invasion; protect the countries of Eastern Europe against Soviet 
aggression and German resurgence; reflect the reality -- demonstrated by two 
world wars -- that a balance on the Continent requires U.S. participation, and 
be compatible with some reasonable process of German unification. 
</P>
<P>
Establishment of such a system is primarily a political issue, not one of arms 
control. The key is the future evolution of Germany. There are in fact only 
three possible political outcomes: that Germany remain divided along the 
existing military demarcation lines; that Germany be unified as a neutral state 
with a status similar to that of Austria or Finland; that Germany be unified 
within NATO. 
</P>
<P>
The permanent division of Germany would produce a chronic crisis by tempting 
outside powers either to exploit or to stimulate intra-German conflict. 
</P>
<P>
The concept of a unified and neutral Germany has a surface plausibility but 
grave underlying problems, perhaps especially for the Soviet Union. 
Neutralization is most easily verifiable in countries that do not yet possess 
state-of-the-art technology. The larger the state and the more complex its 
economy, the more difficult to determine its real military potential. Japan, 
for example, could approach military superpower status soon after deciding to 
do so. 
</P>
<P>
A free-standing, unified Germany would be in much the same position. Indeed 
after a few years it might repeat Germany's historic mistake of attempting to 
achieve its own independent security, an enterprise that twice in this century 
produced global catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
But Germany as part of NATO would be under the arms-control umbrella of allies 
with a vested interest in observing agreed limitations. 
</P>
<P>
An Austrian-type solution for Germany would create a single bloc from the 
French-German frontier to the Polish-Soviet border, of states with similar 
international status and therefore propelled toward joint diplomacy. Surely 
there is no better formula for eventual German hegemony over Central Europe or 
a long-term German-Russian conflict. 
</P>
<P>
Ideally, a new security system for Europe should possess the following 
elements: 
</P>
<P>
* The countries of Eastern Europe -- with the exception of the German 
Democratic Republic -- would be given a status similar to Austria or Finland. 
They would be politically neutral and agree to a regime of limited armaments 
specified by treaty and guaranteed internationally. 
</P>
<P>
* Germany would begin the process of unification with a confederation; its 
first task would be to negotiate a peace treaty acknowledging current external 
frontiers. 
</P>
<P>
* Germany would remain in NATO if it wished, but the territory of the current 
German Democratic Republic would be demilitarized and all German military 
forces limited by agreement. 
</P>
<P>
* Foreign forces on German soil would be dramatically reduced. 
</P>
<P>
* Nuclear weapons and foreign forces on West German soil would be pulled back 
west from the East German border to an agreed line nearer the French-Benelux 
borders. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously such a scheme is illustrative, permitting numerous permutations. A 
five-year transitional period during which some Soviet forces remain in Central 
Europe seems entirely reasonable. But the basic objectives need to be 
established soon, before the existing politically incongruous military 
demarcation lines are again frozen in place. 
</P>
<P>
In my view, the scheme outlined here would meet everyone's political and 
security concerns to some extent. Such an outcome would bring about coincidence 
between political and military demarcation lines. An agreed, managed process of 
German unification would ease an otherwise festering crisis. The Soviets would 
acquire a buffer glacis of about 800 miles; a zone of limited armaments between 
the Rhine and the Elbe; a significant reduction of U.S. forces; a demilitarized 
area on territory of the current German Democratic Republic, and a neutral belt 
in Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary. Western Europe would gain the same 
glacis in reverse. 
</P>
<P>
Many thoughtful policy-makers shrink from tackling the German issue because, 
while recognizing its complexity, they fear that tackling it head-on might 
overthrow Mikhail S. Gorbachev. I believe procrastination would produce the 
most dangerous consequences. Gorbachev surely deserves great respect for his 
willingness to confront the crisis of his society. 
</P>
<P>
But the West does neither Gorbachev nor itself a favor by pretending that the 
structural changes Gorbachev's policies have impelled can be calibrated by 
arcane analysis of his domestic position. One way or another, the process now 
under way will proceed on many fronts: In an election year for both Germanys, 
the drive for unification will surely develop its own momentum; various 
parliaments will be reducing NATO defense budgets, and different national 
leaders will push individual arms-control proposals. Hence waiting on events is 
an invitation to chaos and to the unilateral dismantling of institutions that 
have brought us this far. 
</P>
<P>
Another school of thought holds that even if Gorbachev's domestic position is 
less precarious than feared, neither he nor any successor could ever agree to a 
security system that retains U.S. forces in Europe and does not require the 
dissolution of NATO. Yet so many recent events were regarded as inconceivable 
until they actually occurred, one should be careful not to assume certainty 
about Soviet conduct. 
</P>
<P>
It may be that no security system will be able to contain the process now under 
way. In time Germany may become neutral -- by its own choice or in response to 
a Soviet offer. Improbable as it now seems, a German initiative cannot be ruled 
out if German disillusionment with Western lack of support for its national 
aspirations continues to grow. And sooner or later the Soviet Union may play 
its "German card" -- exchanging unification for neutrality -- reckless as it 
would be for Soviet security in the long run. Whether Germany would accept it 
would depend not so much on exhortations as on the strength of its ties with 
the West. 
</P>
<P>
Painful as I would find such a development, the United States would have no 
reason to panic. Instead it should offer to preserve NATO for whatever core 
group of the Atlantic Alliance wishes it. In my view, that offer would be 
accepted with alacrity by Western Europe as a hedge against German revanchism 
or renewed Soviet aggressiveness. 
</P>
<P>
In short, NATO is needed for the internal West European balance and as a 
guarantee of European security. While U.S. deployments in Europe and the 
overall strength of NATO should take account of the declining military threat, 
abolishing NATO cannot be a quid pro quo for the ailments of the Warsaw Pact. 
What NATO must do is redefine the threat it is supposed to deal with, the 
strategy appropriate to it and the organization needed to reflect the changed 
roles of Europe and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The security system outlined here implies an important change in NATO doctrine. 
But the status quo is certain to be undermined by the random moves on arms 
control, German unification and legislative defense budget-cutting throughout 
the West that the absence of a coherent Western approach invites. 
</P>
<P>
History does not produce automatic results. It requires conscious action -- a 
recognition of the historic moment. Our arrival time can be flexible but 
agreeing on the destination brooks no delay.

COSTA RICA CAMPAIGN CAUGHT IN DRUG TRAFFIC; 
</P>

CHARGES THAT DRUG MONEY HELPED FUND BOTH CANDIDATES.

SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Costa Ricans go to the polls today to choose a successor to President 
Oscar Arias, they will be among the most expensive voters in the world. 
</P>
<P>
The two major political parties, the incumbent social-democratic National 
Liberation Party (PLN) and the conservative Social Christian Unity Party (PUSC) 
have spent a combined total of about $12 per voter to capture the presidency of 
Latin America's most stable democracy. 
</P>
<P>
The pressures of an increasingly expensive campaign -- foreign funding is 
permitted and unregulated -- have led both parties to accept funds from 
questionable sources. 
</P>
<P>
An experienced Costa Rican political analyst said, "The mobsters and gangsters 
of the international drug cartels are always looking for a small country as a 
haven. They practically controlled Panama and they're moving in on Costa Rica . 
. . . The fact is both political parties have been indirectly in touch with 
people who are laundering money or have actually been smuggling drugs." 
</P>
<P>
In truth, the connection between prominent Costa Rican politicians and 
functionaries of the drug cartels has not been exactly "indirect." 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, front-runner Rafael Angel Calderon, the conservative PUSC 
candidate, saw a comfortable lead over PLN candidate Carlos Manuel Castillo 
almost evaporate, in part because of evidence that PUSC has received nearly $1 
million from two sources now hostile toward each other -- Gen. Manuel A. 
Noriega and the U.S. Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
Interviews, sworn congressional testimony and documents indicate that since 
1985 both Noriega and two Republican administrations backed Calderon, the man 
perceived as more willing to support their regional interests. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1986 elections, Washington saw the pro-peace PLN candidate Oscar Arias 
an obstacle to pursuing its proxy war against Nicaragua. Calderon, on the other 
hand, threatened to break diplomatic relations with Nicaragua, send Costa Rican 
guardsmen to fight the Sandinistas and forge closer U.S. relations. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega allegedly had other motives for helping Calderon, a 
wheeling-and-dealing politician who might more likely turn a blind eye to 
drug-related activities in Costa Rica. 
</P>
<P>
More embarrassing for Calderon was testimony presented to a U.S. Senate Foreign 
Relations subcommittee in 1989. In a sworn declaration, Jose Blandon, a former 
Panamanian diplomat, said that during 1985 Noriega made two cash donations of 
$250,000 each to Calderon's campaign, one directly to the candidate. The funds 
were not party-to-party, but came from a special military account controlled 
personally by Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
Until January, Calderon enjoyed a comfortable 10-point lead over Castillo, in 
part because the Liberation Party had been tainted, early in the campaign, with 
ties to drug traffickers. Last July, the Special Commission on Drug Trafficking 
of Costa Rica's Legislative Assembly issued an explosive report implicating a 
former PLN president, Daniel Oduber, and other party officials in drug 
trafficking and money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
PLN aspirant Castillo, an experienced but rather colorless economist, 
immediately plummeted in the polls, although the legislative report produced 
scant evidence that he had personally accepted drug money for his campaign. In 
testimony to the commission, however, Castillo admitted that while running in 
the Liberation Party primaries in 1985, he had received two checks, totaling 
about $2,000, from a Cuban subsequently implicated in drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
Calderon told the commission that during the last campaign, he accepted 
political loans totaling about $100,000 from two wealthy foreigners later 
linked to drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
But the drug charges stuck more firmly on Liberation, which has been in power 
for the past eight years. 
</P>
<P>
For the 1990 campaign, Calderon's chief ad man and image-maker is Roger Ailes, 
the Republican media consultant who worked on George Bush's presidential 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Luis Manuel Chacon, who handled Calderon's two previous unsuccessful 
presidential campaigns, says Ailes has recommended many changes and "has given 
a lot of confidence to Mr. Calderon." 
</P>
<P>
The Ailes-inspired changes are apparent. Gone are Calderon's controversial, 
hawkish statements about Nicaragua and arming Costa Rica. Few interviews are 
granted and public appearances are carefully controlled. The 1989/90 PUSC 
campaign has been long on image, short on substance. 
</P>
<P>
Republican efforts to put Costa Rica in more conservative hands began several 
years ago. The Association for the Defense of Liberty and Democracy in Costa 
Rica, a PUSC political think tank, promoted Calderon's candidacy and opposed 
Arias' peace policies. Since 1986, the think tank, according to its critics, 
has received $434,000 in U.S. government funds from the National Endowment for 
Democracy (NED). Documents show this included almost $50,000 in salaries to 
Calderon, its executive director for two years. The grants have been channeled 
via the National Republican Institute for International Affairs, a Republican 
Party entity set up to receive NED funds. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. contributions raised eyebrows on Capitol Hill, since NED is 
specifically barred from involvement in partisan politics. Rep. Jim Leach 
(R-Iowa) called it "mind-boggling" -- that U.S. taxpayer money would fund "the 
opposition of the strongest democracy in Central America." 
</P>
<P>
Association President Luis Chacon denies that funds have been improperly used, 
noting the seminars, conferences and public-opinion polls designed "to do 
political upgrading of the country." He adds that his association is now 
concentrating on monitoring "democratic processes" in Nicaragua and Panama and 
that NED funding is being phased out. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout Latin America and much of Europe, it is common for political parties 
to make donations to sister parties in other countries. But it is quite another 
matter for U.S. government funds to be applied in the partisan politics of a 
friendly country. 
</P>
<P>
Between elections, cocaine trafficking through Costa Rica, and other Central 
American countries, has soared. 
</P>
<P>
Whoever wins this time will have to deal with that problem over the next four 
years.

AL DAVIS A GREEDY MEANY? SOME STADIUM PERSPECTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robert Guskind, Robert Guskind is a staff writer for the National Journal. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So you think Al Davis is one of the meanest guys in sports? Wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, it's hard to teach the uninitiated in the dalliances and wanderings of 
Davis and his Raiders. The easy part is explaining why the Raiders left Oakland 
and ended up in Los Angeles with a contract that put the Coliseum in the red 
following the Rams move to Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
It's harder fathoming why Irwindale offered the Raiders a $115-million stadium 
in a gravel pit and let Davis keep $10 million when the deal fell through. And 
it's ironic that after all its litigation with Davis, the Los Angeles Coliseum 
Authority is contemplating giving him more than $60 million and tearing down 
the Coliseum to keep the Raiders from returning to Oakland or going to 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
But you can always count on someone being worse off. 
</P>
<P>
Take St. Petersburg, home of the new $85-million Florida Suncoast Dome, notable 
mainly for its lack of a baseball team. St. Pete spent a year making passes at 
the Chicago White Sox, residents of Comiskey Park. Florida even promised the 
Sox a $30-million bonus to show up. That's why Chicago is spending $150 million 
to build the baseball team a stadium that could require a taxpayer subsidy of 
$657 million over the next 20 years. Even so, the owner of the Sox later 
implied that staying in Chicago was an act of civic generosity. 
</P>
<P>
Al Davis is almost starting to look like just another reasonable 
free-enterpriser trying to make a buck. He is not asking for anything that 
hasn't been done since AD 97, the year the publicly financed Coliseum opened 
its gates in Rome (capacity 50,000, no skyboxes). That venue did a land-office 
business in gladiator fights, chariot races and match-ups between lions and 
Christians. 
</P>
<P>
Don't laugh. Maryland officials cited Roman precedent in 1987 when they tried 
to prevent citizens from voting on a new publicly financed $160-million 
ballpark for the Orioles. Wrote state Atty. Gen. J. Joseph Curran Jr.: "Rome in 
the zenith of her power not only constructed the Coliseum at Rome, but caused 
similar structures to be erected and maintained in various large cities . . . 
for the entertainment and edification of the public." 
</P>
<P>
Around the country, about 20 cities are considering, planning or building new 
stadiums or domes. In addition to the Raiders, four other football teams are 
angling for new stadiums or renovations. Seven major-league baseball teams want 
new ballparks or will soon move into them. 
</P>
<P>
Most stadiums operate at a public loss. Pro football stadiums host eight home 
games a year, one or two exhibition games and -- for the lucky few -- a couple 
of playoff games. Baseball stadiums host 81 home games a year. The rest of the 
time, stadiums depend on rock concerts, monster truck matches and religious 
revivals to pay the bills. Mostly they don't. 
</P>
<P>
When New Orleans built its Superdome in 1970s, costs ballooned from an 
estimated $35 million to $163 million. A hoped-for baseball team never came and 
the dome has required annual public subsidies of up to $12 million. New Orleans 
became a fiscal basket case, laying off cops and dropping to a four-day work 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Still, New Orleans may be lucky. The dome has attracted Super Bowls and, in 
1988, the Republican National Convention. A University of New Orleans economic 
study estimated that the dome has been worth $2.5 billion to the local economy 
since 1975, a return of $96 for every tax dollar invested. 
</P>
<P>
Such estimates pivot on the "economic multiplier effect," written in quicksand. 
When Jacksonville was trying to land a football team (it offered the Houston 
Oilers $100 million), the city produced a study showing that eight home games 
would bring in $60 million a year. Denver estimated a baseball team's 81 home 
games would produce $70 million annually. The White Sox say they're worth $100 
million a year. 
</P>
<P>
No way, says Robert A. Baade, a Lake Forest College economist who studies 
public stadiums. He concludes that, in general, stadiums make no difference to 
a local economy. Stadiums are really built to satisfy "civic ego." 
</P>
<P>
In 1977, when the stadium-building boom was in its infancy, a congressional 
committee concluded that public financing of a stadium is "a subsidy for 
wealthy owners and a select group of citizens." The congressional report 
suggested that "a new approach to financing" stadiums was needed. 
</P>
<P>
Sports fans may, in fact, be losing their zeal for the old-fashioned approach. 
In 1984, Cleveland voters said no to a $200-million dome financed by property 
taxes. Last fall, San Francisco voters gave a second ixnay to a new ballpark 
for the Giants who, arguably, can make the best climatic case in pro sports for 
a new home. 
</P>
<P>
But cities will, can and do find ways around reluctant voters. Cleveland is 
back with a baseball stadium that would cost $120 million, to be financed by a 
quarter-cent county sales-tax increase, the largest tax hike that doesn't need 
voter approval. 
</P>
<P>
Many recent stadium proposals, however, do contain some private financing. 
Toronto's Skydome cost the public $50 million, but the private sector kicked in 
$310 million. San Francisco's defeated stadium would have raised $85 million 
from private sources and $30 million from the city. 
</P>
<P>
And then there's the late Miami Dolphins owner Joe Robbie, perhaps the patron 
saint of private financing. After losing three public votes to replace the 
Orange Bowl, Robbie did it himself and financed a $100-million stadium by 
selling 180 luxury skyboxes and 10,500 VIP "club seats" in advance. The stadium 
opened without a penny of direct subsidy. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe someone will take Davis to Miami on a fact-finding mission. Should Davis 
call movers, however, there's no need to worry. Odds are, Davis will come 
knocking again or another team will auction itself off. They might even want to 
play in a Roman Coliseum.

REFORMS FAILED THE TEST OF FAULTS AND CONSEQUENCES; 
</P>
<P>
ETHICS: THE PROPOSAL FOR PUBLIC FINANCING OF MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS WAS FLAWED. 
THE CITY COUNCIL WAS RIGHT TO DEEP-SIX IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Zev Yaroslavsky, Zev Yaroslavsky is a member of the Los Angeles City 
Council. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council did the right thing in refusing to be stampeded 
into endorsing the public financing of political campaigns that was proposed by 
Mayor Tom Bradley's Citizens Ethics Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The panel's proposal fell far short of its stated goals: curbing the influence 
of special interests on the city government, capping the cost of city election 
campaigns and opening up the election process to a broader range of candidates. 
In fact, the plan would have served instead to further entrench incumbents and 
further empower the affluent, while doing nothing to curb special-interest 
money. 
</P>
<P>
Under the commission's plan, a portion of the private funds raised by 
candidates for city office would have been matched with taxpayer dollars. In 
exchange, overall limits would have been placed on the amount that could be 
spent in a citywide or council district election. 
</P>
<P>
Let's analyze this proposal in the context of its stated objectives: 
</P>
<P>
* Would it have limited the influence of "special-interest" money on the 
political process? The answer is a resounding "No!" 
</P>
<P>
Candidates would still have been permitted to solicit and receive funds from 
persons or companies doing business with the city or its agencies -- the very 
definition of "special interest" money. Mayoral candidates would have been able 
to receive up to $1,000 from such donors, and council candidates up to $500. 
That is precisely what current law allows. 
</P>
<P>
If those laws fail to provide the necessary controls, there are more-effective 
ways to stop special-interest contributions than the proposal put forth by the 
Ethics Commission. One is to prohibit elected officials from voting or acting 
on matters affecting their contributors. Such a law is in effect in Orange 
County and was proposed for Los Angeles by Councilman Joel Wachs and me during 
the ethics debate. Another is to have campaigns completely financed by the 
taxpayers, thus prohibiting all private contributions. Oddly, the Ethics 
Commission chose not to propose either of those options. 
</P>
<P>
* Would the proposal have placed a meaningful cap on the amount of money that 
is spent on city elections? Again, no. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the proposal allowed for a level of spending per campaign is so high 
that it has only been exceeded twice in City Council elections and never in a 
citywide election. 
</P>
<P>
* Would the proposal have opened up the process to a broader range of 
participants? No. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's proposal required that in order for any candidate to qualify 
for public funds, he or she must raise at least $25,000 in amounts of $250 or 
less. Failure to reach that threshold automatically disqualified that candidate 
from any form of public financing. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1989 elections for the City Council, only two challengers raised more 
than $25,000. What the commissioners failed to realize was that, for most 
candidates, it is still exceedingly difficult to raise that amount of money. 
This is a particular hardship on candidates for office in less affluent parts 
of our city, or for candidates who don't have access to people with lots of 
discretionary income. 
</P>
<P>
Election-financing laws affecting the city have already changed twice in the 
last five years. 
</P>
<P>
Ernani Bernardi, one of the council's most outspoken reformers, won 80% voter 
approval in April, 1985, for one of the strictest campaign-financing laws in 
the country. Then, in 1988, the voters of the state passed Proposition 73, 
which further restricted fund-raising and which is still being tested in court. 
Those laws have been in effect only for a short time and they deserve a chance 
to prove themselves before we junk them for yet another change. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of public financing have other gripes about the concept. It limits 
freedom of speech for a candidate. It carries a $27.4-million price tag at a 
time when the city's budget is strained and demands for service are at an 
all-time high. And it arouses the resentment of some voters who aren't 
comfortable with the notion that their tax dollars would finance the campaigns 
of candidates with whom they fundamentally disagree and for whom they would 
never vote -- like Lyndon LaRouche, who has twice qualified for federal 
matching funds in his campaigns for the presidency, even though he has barely 
garnered enough votes to be noticed. 
</P>
<P>
This is not to argue that all aspects of the old system were better than the 
current or proposed systems; it is to say that no system is without its faults 
and consequences. And the faults and consequences in the commission's plan made 
it a well-intentioned but ill-advised proposal that was rightly rejected by the 
City Council.

NONPARTISAN CITY ELECTIONS PRODUCE A LEADERLESS SHIP; 
</P>
<P>
LOS ANGELES: THE COUNCIL'S EVISCERATION OF THE ETHICS CODE IS A SYMPTOM OF THE 
LEADERLESS STATE OF CITY GOVERNMENT. A RETURN TO PARTISAN POLITICS WOULD HELP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Los Angeles City Council, in a defeat for the forces of good, clean 
government, last month gutted public financing of political campaigns, a major 
segment of the proposed ethics reform package. Council members intentionally 
side-tracked critical points of the plan, delving instead into minutiae about 
the legality of gifts of candy and fountain pens. 
</P>
<P>
This was supposed to be the council's finest hour. A fallen, wounded mayor and 
the swirl of ethics scandals in Sacramento were to propel Los Angeles to the 
vanguard of urban political reform, next to other progressive cities such as 
Seattle and New York. But the council's rejection of the key element of an 
independent commission's ethics proposal, public financing, has turned the 
tables. Now the council, with its self-serving pay raise, appears to be what is 
truly "tainted" in city government. 
</P>
<P>
We are also left with the conclusion that there is a more systemic crisis going 
on in municipal government -- a vacuum of leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Michael Woo, chairman of the ad-hoc ethics committee, bemoaned the 
fact that trying to secure and hold a majority of council members behind the 
Los Angeles Ethics Act was like "herding a bunch of cats." The situation is a 
testimonial to the lack of leadership, of coalition-building and of grass-roots 
party organizing that could have prevented this demise. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council is really 15 fiefdoms ruled by feudal barons who find that 
appeasement of and serving local constituents are their ticket to reelection. 
Look only to the defeat of former council President Pat Russell, who strayed 
beyond her Venice/Westchester base into the grander issue of city 
transportation needs. A light-rail system designed for the San Fernando Valley 
and stretching across five council districts never got off the drawing board. 
In this political structure, the parts of democracy do not equal the whole and 
the city suffers -- be it in transportation gridlock or in ethics reform. The 
solution is not at-large elections: These only breed under-representation of 
minorities. What we do need is to return to partisan elections in the existing 
district system, and rekindle party organizational checks that would prevent 
the Balkanization of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The current system came about as a much-needed reform. The election of Hiram 
Johnson as California governor in 1910, the peak of the Progressive Era, 
brought back popular control of government after the corruption of the 
railroads and their corporate allies. Far-reaching reform legislation, 
including nonpartisan municipal elections, was hammered through in 1911 and 
1913. Conditions today, however, call into question the validity of these 
nonpartisan elections. The weakening of local party grass-roots organizations, 
as mandated by the state election codes, means that the party leadership is 
unaccountable to the greater body politic and that major public policy 
decisions (such as ethics reform) have no particular "carrier constituency" 
across partisan/ideological lines and geographic district lines. Any reformist 
ground swell in Los Angeles must first do away with nonpartisan local 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
On another point -- the role of the individual leader -- James MacGregor Burns 
once wrote that "leadership is one of the most obscure and least understood 
phenomena on Earth." But democracy in America is built on the theory that 
leadership is individually tested in crisis management. While our universities 
do an excellent job of imparting "textbook governance," the notion that future 
leaders might absorb the ethos of public responsibility in a pragmatic setting 
has been largely ignored. To correct this, the City of Los Angeles should 
create an urban fellows program like those of the California Legislature and 
the cities of New York and Chicago. This program would serve as a municipal 
training ground, putting our best and brightest minds at work on urban issues, 
from homelessness to city planning. 
</P>
<P>
The participating fellows ideally would be paid a decent stipend from the 
general fund, be supervised from outside the structure of City Hall to prevent 
politicization of the program, and learn the structure, governance and 
administration of the city. 
</P>
<P>
In combination, the restoration of partisan municipal elections and the 
establishment of an urban fellows program would greatly benefit the city, 
providing external accountability for politicians and a training ground for a 
new breed of urban leaders.

Alarms are being sounded about the perils of complacency regarding the AIDS 
pandemic. The new warnings come from the State AIDS Leadership Committee and 
the National AIDS Commission during meetings in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Geographical shape of the epidemic is changing: 
</P>
<P>
 No end to the continuing increase in new AIDS cases in California is foreseen 
in studies that look as far ahead as 1993, four epidemiologists told the state 
committee. The epidemic is spreading from San Francisco, where new cases peaked 
last year, and Los Angeles, where new cases will peak later this year, to the 
rest of the state, where a majority of the new cases will occur commencing in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
Any leveling off of new cases will depend on controlling the disease in the 
intravenous drug community as it has been controlled in the homosexual 
population. Leaders of the National AIDS Commission were skeptical about 
avoiding an outbreak from the drug community, pointing to New York City and 
Bangkok, Thailand, which have witnessed almost explosive spreads of the disease 
among drug users, and from them to the general population. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Complacency is putting new populations at risk: 
</P>
<P>
 Heterosexual complacency is a continuing problem. In San Francisco, new 
infections in the gay community were quickly reduced through educational 
programs, but among heterosexuals in San Francisco, there has been no general 
behavioral change, according to health officials. Many, perhaps most, 
Californians take the risk of engaging in sex without using condoms. There has 
been a slight decline in sexually transmitted diseases, with the exception of 
the resistant strain of gonorrhea, which could indicate a modest increase in 
condom use. But the gonorrhea annual case load is still around 80,000, and 
syphilis has increased in two of the last three years, indicating widespread 
behavior that places people at risk of AIDS as well. The risk of a further 
spread is indicated also in an ominous increase in AIDS among women and 
children. While homosexual and bisexual males continue to constitute the great 
majority of cases, the most rapid increases have been perinatal cases, up 113%, 
and women, up 86% last year. Women constitute only 3% of the total AIDS cases 
in the state, but the risk varies by region. In San Bernardino County, 10% of 
the AIDS cases, and 25% of those infected with HIV, are women. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Containment is crippled by fund shortages: 
</P>
<P>
 The state's health system drew criticism from Dr. David Rogers, vice chairman 
of the national commission, which heard some very dismaying testimony. Los 
Angeles County reported that it has available only 1% of the funds required to 
undertake early intervention programs that can extend by years the lives of 
persons infected with HIV. And there are waits as long as eight weeks for the 
outpatient clinic at the County-USC Medical Center. San Bernardino County, 
which has chosen to spend no county funds on HIV programs, relying on state and 
federal money instead, has no outpatient clinics for the county's more than 
7,000 HIV-infected persons. San Diego, reporting 500 new AIDS cases in each of 
the last two years, is desperately short of funds, in part because of its 
limited share of state money. By 1992, more people will be living with AIDS in 
San Diego, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties combined that in 
either San Francisco or Los Angeles. Orange County relies on federal grants to 
mount a coordinated program for the more than 14,000 thought to be 
HIV-infected. The epidemiologists forecast a peak in new cases this or next 
year in Orange County, barring an outbreak from the intravenous drug community, 
now accounting for 5% of cases. 
</P>
<P>
The message of the hearings adds up to a warning that the worst is yet to come. 
But most public health facilities are unprepared. And that lack of preparedness 
inevitably will impair the ability of the entire health system to serve all the 
sick, not just those infected with HIV.

PRESERVING YOSEMITE

<P>
Robert Jones was right in his column ("Preserving the Progress at Yosemite," 
Part A, Jan. 23): All of us want the status quo in Yosemite. But he was wrong 
about how to keep it. 
</P>
<P>
Since the summer of 1967, when Jones discovered the wonder that is Yosemite, 
the annual number of visitors at Yosemite has climbed from 2.2 million to 3.4 
million. Though regular visitors may not notice the year-to-year change, the 
congestion at Yosemite brought about by that more than 50% increase in 
visitation certainly has worsened over the past 23 years. As Jones 
acknowledged, at certain times the west entrance to the valley has had to be 
sealed. 
</P>
<P>
Yosemite is such an extraordinary place that we have not yet ruined it. But if 
the trends of greater congestion and commercialization are not checked, then we 
surely will. Recognizing the threats posed by these trends, the National Park 
Service drew up a management plan 10 years ago. It was ambitious. Automobile 
traffic would be scaled back. Facilities would be placed outside the park. 
Armies of administrative personnel would no longer be kept in the heart of 
Yosemite Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, not a single one of these ideas has been implemented. And now, as 
the Park Service reviews that 1980 plan, there is concern that the document may 
be scaled back. But a retreat would be a colossal mistake. A primary reason why 
cars and exhaust have not yet destroyed the valley is the shuttle bus system 
that was put in place in 1970 and subsequently expanded. As visitation grows, 
so must the shuttle. The last thing that Yosemite needs is the added parking 
lots proposed by the Park Service and the concessionaire, the Curry Co. 
</P>
<P>
Because Yosemite is facing the problem of congestion before almost any other 
national park, the actions taken there will provide guidance for the others. 
</P>

After reading Richard Reeves' column (Op-Ed Page, Jan. 24) on the Bush 
Administration's misuse of the Social Security tax, I finally understand what 
conservatives are talking about when they say that they want a "meaner, leaner" 
government: They want the rich to get meaner so the poor can get leaner.

SOCIAL SECURITY: THE EFFECTS OF CHANGE; 
</P>
<P>
AND NOW, EVEN MORE TAXES; 
</P>
<P>
IF MOYNIHAN GETS HIS WAY, WE ARE HEADED FOR HUGE PROBLEMS, INCLUDING 
INTERGENERATIONAL CONFLICT.

<P>
A public debate has focused on Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan's bill to cut the 
Social Security payroll tax rate. Many have concluded that the New York 
Democrat has seized the political high ground by proposing to cut the tax on 
labor while President Bush is proposing to cut the tax on capital with a lower 
capital gains tax rate. 
</P>
<P>
The many people offering their opinions are apparently unaware that Moynihan's 
payroll tax cut is temporary and that his bill contains provisions to raise the 
Social Security tax rate by 30% in the future. Suppose President Reagan had 
proposed a bill that initially cut our tax rates but provided for even higher 
rates in the future. Everyone would have been up in arms. 
</P>
<P>
Moynihan's critics have said that he is sneaky and that his motive is to 
deprive President Bush of Social Security revenues in order to force him to 
break his pledge against a general tax increase. Few realize that Moynihan's 
Social Security tax cut is not a tax cut at all, but the truly sneaky aspect of 
Moynihan's bill is that it disguises the economic crisis that Social Security 
is brewing. 
</P>
<P>
Social Security is a pay-as-you-go system. As the proportion of 
workers-to-retirees shifts, Congress has to periodically make adjustments to 
the tax rate and benefit payments. Normally, Congress raises the tax rate a 
little and cuts back, not on benefits, but on the scheduled growth in future 
real benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, Social Security actuaries alert Congress to looming imbalances before 
they occur, thus providing the political process time to head them off. 
Moynihan's bill, however, disrupts this mechanism for maintaining a balance 
between the burden on taxpayers and the benefits of retirees. 
</P>
<P>
By building in automatic Social Security tax increases through the year 2045, 
Moynihan's bill guarantees that the Social Security tax rate will rise 
inexorably to fund a continual growth in real Social Security benefits. Since 
automatic tax increases will prevent future Social Security deficits, the 
actuaries will have smooth sailing. Future Congresses will never be called upon 
to make the political trade-offs between taxing workers and paying benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Should Moynihan's bill pass, two big problems will result. Unless the formula 
that determines the growth of Social Security benefits is adjusted, future 
retirees will receive up to three times the purchasing power of today's 
retirees. This represents a huge burden on tomorrow's workers, especially since 
their numbers are expected to be fewer in relation to the number of retirees 
than today. 
</P>
<P>
Projections show that in the future there will be only two workers to support 
each retiree, a burden that, with the growth of benefits, would leave workers 
unable to support their own families. Not even guilt-ridden American taxpayers 
are likely to become wage slaves for retirees. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Moynihan's plan guarantees a future political blowup. 
</P>
<P>
The other problem that Moynihan's bill would cause is unemployment. American 
labor, which is still the most productive in the world (Japan's growth of 
productivity is faster but our level is higher), is already finding it 
difficult to compete in markets at home and abroad. Moynihan's 30% hike in the 
tax on employment would simply price American labor out of the market, 
resulting in either mass unemployment or a totally protected and isolated 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
Moynihan's plan would deprive future politicians of warnings signaling both a 
buildup in unemployment and intergenerational political conflict. We should not 
have to wake up one day and find that these two monsters have sneaked up on us 
as a result of legislation that cancelled our warning system.

SOUTH AFRICA: DE KLERK RECOGNIZES THE FAILURE OF APARTHEID. CREDIT WHAT HE HAS 
DONE, BUT THE STRUGGLE GOES ON.

<TEXT>
<P>
South Africa is standing on the threshold of a new era after the opening 
address of the state president, Frederik W. de Klerk, to Parliament Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Apartheid, the system of legalized racism introduced in the late 1940s, which 
we have long condemned as being as evil as Nazism or Stalinist communism, has 
outlasted even the repressive regimes of Eastern Europe dating from the same 
era. 
</P>
<P>
Now De Klerk faces the challenge that confronted the leaders of Eastern Europe 
last year: He must move quickly to dismantle apartheid completely and allow the 
emergence of government for the people, by the people. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk's speech has not met all the demands that the disenfranchised have 
made of his government, but we must give him credit for those he has met. 
</P>
<P>
Personally, I was astounded at some of his announcements and I am thrilled at 
the confirmation that the South African government is committed to releasing 
Nelson Mandela, the South African leader who has become a legend in his 
lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
When I and two other church leaders, Dr. Frank Chikane, general secretary of 
the South African Council of Churches, and Dr. Allan Boesak, president of the 
World Alliance of Reformed Churches, held discussions with De Klerk in Pretoria 
last October, we called on him to take the following immediate steps: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Lift the nationwide state of emergency. He has not done this, although he 
says he will "as soon as circumstances justify it." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Lift restriction orders imposed on political activists. He appears to have 
gone a considerable way toward doing this. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Release all people detained without trial. He has not met this demand, but 
has set a limit on the period of detention without trial. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Lift restrictions on the activities of political and other organizations. 
He has done this, most importantly by unbanning the two longest-established 
liberation movements, the African National Congress and the Pan Africanist 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Release all political prisoners. He has not done this, although he says 
people jailed simply because organizations they supported were banned will be 
released. He has, of course, released key ANC and PAC leaders, and we hope 
Mandela will be free within days or weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Grant reprieves for all those sentenced to death, and declare a moratorium 
on the imposition of the death penalty. He has not met this demand, but has 
suspended the imposition of the death penalty pending changes in the law that 
can be expected to reduce the number of death sentences handed down by the 
courts. 
</P>
<P>
We also called on him to take various other steps within six months of that 
meeting, only one of which he has met: the scrapping of the Separate Amenities 
Act, which allows for the segregation of public facilities. 
</P>
<P>
We said that, if he took all the steps we were urging, we would reconsider our 
advocacy of sanctions. He has obviously not met them, but I nevertheless want 
to discuss the sanctions issue further with political organizations, other 
church leaders and the bishops of my church. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk now has implicitly recognized that apartheid has failed and that his 
government has no legitimacy among the majority of the country's people. 
</P>
<P>
This does not mean that our struggle is won. Far from it. Although De Klerk 
talks about granting a universal franchise, he is still talking about "minority 
rights" and volksregte (group rights), which implies that the white minority 
will still have the power to veto government decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Because of racism, members of the government have no true understanding of the 
forces at work among most of the people in our country. Suspicion and mistrust 
thus dominate their interaction with us. 
</P>
<P>
In this situation, De Klerk may have enormous military power at his command. 
But if we distinguish influence from power, Mandela wields more authority. 
</P>
<P>
This is why it is imperative -- for stability and for orderly change in South 
Africa -- that Mandela be released quickly, and released in circumstances in 
which he retains both his credibility and authority, and can maintain a 
negotiating relationship with the government. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela holds the key to South Africa's future. In fact, for two reasons he has 
a better chance of leading the country away from disaster than does De Klerk. 
</P>
<P>
First, our country is fragmented and torn apart, and not just between black and 
white. Even in the black community we fight each other. Mandela seems to have 
the ability to relate to a very wide range of people without compromising the 
most important parts of his own creed. He is perhaps the only hope we have for 
uniting the disparate elements of those committed to real democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Second, Mandela has demonstrated a capacity for letting whites know that there 
is a place for them in the sun in South Africa, that despite all they have done 
to us, our people ultimately are a forgiving people.

SOCIAL SECURITY: WHOSE BURDEN?;

<TEXT>
<P>
Among other things, America was founded on the idea of fair taxes. At the 
Boston Tea Party, we fought a revolution against a system of unjust taxation. 
</P>
<P>
A fair tax is based on the ability to pay. But the current tax system is 
backward and irrational, filled with illusions and tricks for the unwary. 
Today, as our tax system's most perceptive critic, multimillionaire Leona 
Helmsley, told her former housekeeper: "Only the little people pay taxes." 
</P>
<P>
This year, Congress faces a crucial test. By passing President Bush's plan to 
cut taxes for those who have capital and are already making gains, it could 
return to the dried-up wells of trickle-down economics. This would be a major 
mistake for the American people. 
</P>
<P>
Alternatively, Congress can move forward to a fair tax policy for all Americans 
by passing Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan's proposal to roll back Social Security 
taxes. This plan would reduce the tax burden on 110 million working Americans 
by $55 billion next year and begin to restore fairness to our tax system. 
</P>
<P>
A high Social Security payroll tax is especially unfair because it taxes all 
employees, whether they are earning $10,000 or $1 million a year, at the same 
flat rate, now set at 7.65%. 
</P>
<P>
This George Bush approach is what I call ham-and-egg economics. It looks as if 
everybody, the hens and the hogs, are contributing equally to make the 
sandwich. The ham and the eggs, after all, are both between two slices of the 
same bread. The smell is blended and they are jointly advertised. 
</P>
<P>
But the hens and the hogs are really giving up very different things. While the 
hen lays an egg and keeps on squawking, the hog gives up a leg and then stops 
walking. One drop for the hen, a total sacrifice for the hog. 
</P>
<P>
With the Republican ham-and-eggs payroll tax, the hens are making out like 
bandits while the hogs are getting slaughtered. The unfairness and backwardness 
of the flat tax is made even worse by the fact that the tax is imposed only on 
the first $51,300 of wages. This means that someone earning $51,300 a year and 
someone earning $10 million a year each pay $3,924. 
</P>
<P>
Moynihan's bill is responding to the fact that the revenues from the federal 
payroll tax, which are supposed to be dedicated to the Social Security trust 
funds, are in fact being used to pay the general expenses of government. 
</P>
<P>
To correct the misuse of the payroll tax, Moynihan proposes that Congress 
repeal the recent rate increase and then cut the rate effective Jan. 1, 1991, 
to 5.1% (6.5% including Medicare). This plan would preserve the integrity of 
the Social Security system and place it back on the pay-as-you-go basis under 
which it operated for decades before 1983. 
</P>
<P>
This proposal is fiscally sound and morally right. It is neither sensible nor 
just to steal from Social Security, which is the solemn promise of one 
generation to the next, to pay for government services or military technology 
that we do not have the will to pay for honestly or the courage to do without. 
The working people of America should not be giving up their hard-earned wages 
to pay for the government's own fiscal irresponsibility. 
</P>
<P>
And yet, we cannot stop there. If the Moynihan proposal goes through, we will 
have to make up the difference between government revenues and expenditures 
that the Social Security surplus has been used to hide. The Reagan and Bush 
Administrations have used the trust fund surpluses to mask the true size of the 
federal deficit. In 1989, for example, President Bush said that the deficit was 
$152 billion but, without all of the Social Security reserves, it was really a 
staggering $248 billion. Cutting the capital gains tax now for fewer than 10 
million Americans who already have capital, as President Bush proposes, would 
simply swell the deficit and compound the present irresponsibility. 
</P>
<P>
To bring the deficit down, we need to preserve only necessary military spending 
and require wealthy Americans and corporations to pay their fair share of 
taxes. In the 1980s, the Reagan-Bush Administration cut taxes on the wealthy 
and raised taxes on working- and middle-class families by systematically 
shifting the tax burden. This was a fraud on the majority of the American 
people. As Moynihan recently observed, "The United States almost certainly now 
has the most regressive tax structure of any Western nation." 
</P>
<P>
But there are ways to close the gap. We can restore the 1987 income tax rate on 
the top 600,000 taxpayers to 38.5%. We can impose luxury taxes and a securities 
transfer excise tax. We can tax corporate polluters, limit the business meals 
deduction to 50% and close other corporate loopholes. If we combine sensible 
tax measures like these with at least a freeze in real military spending, we 
can stop the destructive cycle of deficit spending. 
</P>
<P>
We need a new democratic direction for our fiscal policy, and Moynihan's 
proposal is a step in the right direction. Congress should decide to take a 
stand with the working people of America and put and end to ham-and-egg 
economics.

WHO OWNS THE BOWERS MUSEUM? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Santa Ana ran the Bowers Museum for 51 years until 1987, when it 
appointed the nonprofit Charles W. Bowers Museum Corp. to manage the 
institution's day-to-day affairs. The city still owns the museum and gives it 
an annual $1-million stipend, but the eventual goal is to make the corporation 
support itself. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile -- "inadvertently," according to Bowers board President Arthur V. 
Strock -- "there were some clauses in the agreement between the board and the 
city that puts long-term grants at peril. (In 2008), all the assets of the 
museum, present and future, revert to city ownership. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to go to an individual or institution and say, 'Gee, we'd like you 
to give us $1 million to build a gallery or to buy a painting, with the 
knowledge that we can't assure control of it for the indefinite future. It was 
a mistake on everybody's part." 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Edward J. Cooper, however, said the agreement between the city and 
the Bowers Corp. "protects the continuing operation of the museum" by providing 
"an incentive for the corporation to prove itself." 
</P>
<P>
The 20-year agreement works like this, Cooper said: 
</P>
<P>
For the first 10 years, the Bowers receives the same operating budget from the 
city (basically, the amount it received in 1987, plus a cost-of-living 
adjustment). For the succeeding 10 years, the city handout will be reduced by 
10% yearly, until the museum is running completely on money from other sources. 
</P>
<P>
If the corporation is unable to run the museum, control will revert to the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper said the city "would probably know by the 15th year whether or not the 
Bowers was able to stand on its own two feet. I think it's reasonable to say 
that the Bowers Corp. would then receive a very long-term lease" from the city. 
</P>
<P>
But in the meantime, Cooper added, donors should have no qualms about the 
long-term future of their gifts. A donor may specify that any gift be used only 
by the Bowers Corp. and that it be returned if the museum reverts to city 
control. 
</P>
<P>
"We would encourage donors to become actively involved," he said, "and simply 
make that a term or condition of the donation." CATHY CURTIS

A routine jog for three Los Angeles police officers turned into a 1 
1/4-mile-long foot, bicycle and golf cart chase that ended with the capture of 
a suspect in an attempted rape, police said Saturday. Alan Sorkness, Charles 
Heim and Gary Morgan were out for a training run in the Sepulveda Dam 
Recreation Area about 4:30 p.m. Friday when a 25-year-old woman crawled from 
thick brush on the side of the jogging path "screaming for help," Sgt. Joseph 
Brazas said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman told police that she had been jogging when a man dragged her from the 
path and tried to rape her. As the officers spoke to the woman, she spotted the 
suspect 200 feet away and the chase began, Brazas said. They ran into Balboa 
Golf Course, where the officers ran into actor Scott Baio, who loaned them his 
golf cart. One officer also commandeered a bicycle. Both had to be abandoned 
finally because of rough terrain, but the suspect was caught in an open field 
in the undeveloped recreation area, Brazas said. The 16-year-old suspect was 
taken to Sylmar Juvenile Hall on suspicion of attempted rape.

DIANNE KLEIN: BABY'S FUTURE HINGES ON COURT'S VIEW OF MOTHERHOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Jodi Argleben, 19 years old this month, was born to an Aleut Indian woman and a 
Russian man in the tribal village of Akhiok, on Alaska's Kodiak Island. 
</P>
<P>
This heritage is very important to many people -- strangers to Jodi Argleben -- 
in the United States and Canada and maybe even in other places too. 
</P>
<P>
These people say that Jodi's baby, 7-month-old Rebecca, who is one-quarter 
Aleut, belongs with the tribe. The Indians have bestowed tribal membership on 
her in absentia. 
</P>
<P>
Jodi Argleben finds this shocking, terrifying and wrong. She says that her 
blood has no hold on her, that her life as the adopted daughter of a non-Indian 
family is the only one she has really known and that it fits her well. 
</P>
<P>
Now Jodi wants her daughter, born of an unmarried union with her high school 
sweetheart, to remain with the Canadian couple who hope to adopt her. She says 
she wants Rebecca to have a chance. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel right here," Jodi told me as we sat in the living room of her parents' 
home in Cypress the other day. "I felt out of place when I went there. And my 
baby is not going there either." 
</P>
<P>
There, of course, is Akhiok, about 5,000 miles away, and until Jodi and her 
sister Janice traveled there with the baby last summer, it was just a harsh, 
forgotten memory in a toddler's mind. 
</P>
<P>
Jodi and Janice, also adopted by the Arglebens, were taken from their parents 
after allegations of abuse. Jodi was 18 months old and her sister three years 
older than that. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember we landed on this gravel runway," Jodi said of last summer's trip. 
"And I was thinking all we needed to do was hit a rock and we would flip over. 
Then we went to some clinic. We had sandwiches and chips. We met the couple who 
want to adopt Rebecca and the chief and his wife. 
</P>
<P>
"They were nice and all, but they didn't seem too excited to see the baby. By 
this time, I had made up my mind. I wanted to leave and I didn't want my baby 
there. The houses were old, with no carpet and no heaters. The bathrooms stunk. 
. . . We didn't stay more than three hours." 
</P>
<P>
As Jodi and I talked -- about her predicament, the legal attempts to resolve 
it, and her steely determination to spare her child what she feels would be a 
life of dead-ends -- incredulity, mixed with sarcasm, crept into her young 
voice. 
</P>
<P>
"None of this makes sense," she said. "If they wanted children so bad, why 
didn't they fight to keep me and my sister there? Here, years later, they want 
to take my baby." 
</P>
<P>
When I mentioned the Indian Child Welfare Act, the 1978 law that aims to 
preserve American Indian culture by granting tribal jurisdiction over adoptions 
of Indian children, Jodi told me that she just didn't get it. 
</P>
<P>
What she understands is that strangers, misguided or hypocritical, want to 
control what is rightfully hers to decide. Rather than allow these people to 
guide Rebecca's future, Jodi says she will reclaim her daughter and raise her 
on her own. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Jodi, I can understand the rationale behind the Aleuts' decision to 
fight for custody of Rebecca Argleben. In the past, and undoubtably in the 
present, Indian children have been uprooted from their people and their 
culture. And any society will eventually wither without its young. 
</P>
<P>
But on another level, practical and prosaic, I have mentally put myself in this 
young mother's place. 
</P>
<P>
My own daughter was born in Mexico City, where my husband and I were residents. 
That makes her, according to the laws of that country and our own, a citizen of 
both nations. 
</P>
<P>
But what if my husband and I had decided that we did not want to raise our 
child? Would it be up to the government of Mexico to tell us who could? 
</P>
<P>
Jodi Argleben's Aleut heritage may show through her eyes, in the warm glow of 
her skin, but her assimilation into American culture is complete. 
</P>
<P>
Rational people would be appalled, I believe, if another nation were to 
intervene in the adoption of a different American child, one without Indian 
blood. So, too, should they be concerned here. 
</P>
<P>
Like so many other young women, Jodi was jolted and confused by an unplanned 
pregnancy. She considered an abortion, she says, but by then it was too late. 
She dropped out of high school and on her 18th birthday, her boyfriend 
proposed. 
</P>
<P>
But she turned him down, Jodi says, because she knew it wouldn't work. They 
broke up a few months after that. 
</P>
<P>
Jodi says that when Rebecca was born, her boyfriend seemed hardly to care. But 
now, months later, he too has hired an attorney in an attempt to play a role in 
Rebecca's life. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately the courts, in Vancouver or in Orange County or perhaps in both 
places, will issue a final edict on Rebecca Argleben's future. 
</P>
<P>
If the tribe wins, it will no doubt be because of the Indian Child Welfare Act. 
If Jodi wins, it may be because someone believed that the Aleuts' right to 
preserve their culture cannot supersede a mother's right to protect her child.

TENSIONS OF COSTA MESA MIRRORED IN FAMILY FEUD 
</P>

COSTA MESA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At first glance the fight between Chester Gamboni and Pat Dolan, two Costa Mesa 
neighbors and former friends, seems straight out of the files of Judge Wapner. 
</P>
<P>
They are engaged in a lawsuit over the placement of a back-yard fence. But it 
is only the latest battle in a war that has seen such mudslinging over the 
years as to put the Hatfields and McCoys to shame. 
</P>
<P>
Both parties have filed for restraining orders against the other. They and 
their families have traded accusations of verbal harassment, threats, even 
physical attacks, as well as spying, the injuring of pets and the poisoning of 
trees, according to documents on file in Orange County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
In the next few months, the courts are expected to sort out the allegations and 
decide who has legal right to what amounts to a 14-inch-wide section of grass. 
</P>
<P>
But Gamboni vs. Dolan may represent more than just a seamy squabble between 
individuals. Some observers say it reflects a tension wrought by change on 
Costa Mesa's west side and, more broadly, in Orange County, as increasing 
numbers of Latino and Asian immigrants enter the community. 
</P>
<P>
In Costa Mesa, observers point to a string of recent City Council actions -- an 
attempt to withhold city money from groups aiding illegal aliens, an ordinance 
aimed at Latino dayworkers and a general opposition to longstanding social 
programs -- as signs of a backlash among non-Latino residents. 
</P>
<P>
Significantly, Dolan is ardent and public in his criticism of illegal aliens 
and what he regards as the intrusion into the residential west side of 
organizations serving the homeless and other needy. In contrast, Gamboni, of 
Latino and Italian heritage, supports those causes with nearly equal zeal. 
</P>
<P>
Their differences are played out in a six-inch stack of court records. 
</P>
<P>
Gamboni, 42, alleges in those records that the case is all about the Dolan 
family's hatred of non-whites and their attempts to run his family out of their 
Mesa West neighborhood. Dolan, 47, counters in the lawsuit that the dispute is 
nothing but an inexplicable vendetta launched against his family by Gamboni. 
</P>
<P>
Their five-year feud has culminated in a court dispute over who has rights to a 
strip of land that is technically on Dolan property but that the Gambonis have 
stepped across for years to get to a city park. 
</P>
<P>
The most ironic twist to date came in November when a judge, ruling on one 
subsidiary issue, ordered Dolan to contribute $250 to the charity of Gamboni's 
choice. The group Gamboni chose was Share Our Selves -- whose mission and 
founder are among Dolan's favorite targets. 
</P>
<P>
Dolan's cashier's check was delivered to SOS in January -- after he and other 
neighbors persuaded the City Council to evict the charity from its west side 
home in the Rea Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, neighbors have lined up on both sides, providing a briefcase full of 
accusatory court declarations that have not gone unnoticed in the community. 
</P>
<P>
"If either one of them were living next door to anyone else, it would tend to 
be quieter," said Sid Soffer, a city government-watcher who knows both men, 
"but Pat Dolan is radical in his thoughts, and Chester is about the same -- 
they are not a very good match." 
</P>
<P>
Gamboni says his motivations are pure. "This is the land of the free, but 
sometimes you have to fight for your freedom and the freedom of others," he 
declared in one court document. "I also fought for many others in the 
neighborhood and community that have been wronged, falsely accused or attacked 
because of the color of their skin. I have felt very oppressed at their (the 
Dolans') hand." 
</P>
<P>
Both Gamboni and Dolan own several properties in the city. Gamboni's residence 
on 20th Street is flanked on both sides by property owned by Dolan. Dolan's own 
residence is two doors from Gamboni's. 
</P>
<P>
Gamboni asserts in court records that Dolan has generated a community uproar 
with his sentiments against illegal aliens, in part for the purpose of 
obtaining more property in the area. That allegation sparked an animated 
response from Dolan. 
</P>
<P>
"I could talk for three hours on how bizarre this thing is," Dolan said in an 
interview last week. "I am a man who has tried to improve conditions on the 
west side . . . and he has accused me of being racist and anti-Semitic. I would 
dispute all of those allegations." 
</P>
<P>
As to Gamboni's allegation that Dolan wants to buy up the neighborhood, Dolan 
replied: "I can't buy every house in Costa Mesa. I'm not a rich man, and I 
certainly don't want his house." 
</P>
<P>
Gamboni also pointed to Dolan's participation on a 1986 city panel that 
recommended ways that the city could deal with dayworkers who congregated in 
city parks. 
</P>
<P>
Dolan and three other panel members broke with the majority and wrote a 
minority report that decried the "invasion of Costa Mesa by illegal aliens" and 
enumerated several "negative impacts" purported to be caused by undocumented 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
Latino groups such as Hermandad Mexicana Nacional and Los Amigos of Orange 
County, and some civic leaders such as former mayor Donn Hall and Councilwoman 
Mary Hornbuckle, branded the minority report as racist, which Dolan vehemently 
denies. 
</P>
<P>
Dolan said his quarrel with Gamboni has nothing to do with the social issues 
that have divided the community. But some people familiar with the quarrel 
indeed see broader implications. 
</P>
<P>
"There seems to be (in this dispute) a reaction to the changing demographics 
caused by fear of those who are different," said Rusty Kennedy, executive 
director of the Orange County Human Relations Commission. "Mr. Dolan would seem 
to represent that." 
</P>
<P>
That view is nonsense, responded Jeffrey Evans, a friend of Dolan's who also 
sat on the dayworker panel and co-signed the minority report. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't agree 100% with the minority report, but there was nothing racist 
about it," he said. "I have heard people call Pat Dolan every name in the book, 
but what it boils down to is that when people don't get their way, they start 
name-calling." 
</P>
<P>
In the early stages of the fence dispute, Gambomi filed a complaint with the 
Human Relations Commission, but the two sides were urged to seek mediation. By 
then, however, the legal fur was flying. 
</P>
<P>
According to Gamboni's court declaration: "In the past three years we have 
received anonymous phone calls, violent threats to my son and me, false code 
enforcement complaints, assaults on my pets, damage to my trees, my mail has 
been tampered with and various other harassments." 
</P>
<P>
In a 1986 incident, a dispute over a flyer placed in Gamboni's mailbox ended 
with Dolan's wife, Judy, being cited by police for allegedly brandishing a 
handgun at Gamboni and disturbing the peace. However, the charges were dropped 
after 60 days "in the interests of justice" after Judy Dolan, 43, agreed that 
police had probable cause to arrest her. 
</P>
<P>
The fighting escalated in May, 1989, when the Dolans bought the house next to 
the Gambonis. According to the Dolans, the Gambonis' chain-link fence extends 
14 inches onto their property. They accuse the Gambonis of repeatedly 
trespassing through a gate in the fence. 
</P>
<P>
The Gambonis contend that they have openly used the fence gate since they 
bought the home in 1977 and have established a legal right or easement that 
includes the northwestern tip of the Dolan lot. 
</P>
<P>
Events came to a head when the Dolans began building their own six-foot-high 
wooden fence in front of the Gambonis' gate to block its use. The Dolans allege 
that when Gamboni saw that, he knocked out the fence posts and used one to take 
a swing at Judy Dolan. 
</P>
<P>
The Gambonis deny that but allege that Judy Dolan threw a clump of dirt at 
Gamboni, grazing his face and injuring his eye, according to lawsuit records. 
</P>
<P>
In June, the Dolans filed a civil harassment suit seeking a permanent 
injunction and won a temporary restraining order restricting the Gambonis from 
tampering with the fence or trespassing. 
</P>
<P>
In July, the Gambonis filed a $1-million countersuit that accused the Dolans 
of, among other things, assault and battery and infliction of emotional 
distress. The suit sought a permanent injunction against the Dolans' alleged 
activities and legal title to the disputed patch of property. 
</P>
<P>
In August, Superior Court Judge William F. Rylaarsdam denied the Dolans' 
petition for a permanent injunction, finding that "it appears the Dolans have 
been the primary instigators of the outrageous behavior which has characterized 
the relationship of the parties." 
</P>
<P>
The judge granted the Gambonis an injunction, restricting the Dolans from 
harassing, threatening, following, telephoning or keeping the Gambonis under 
surveillance. The judge ordered the Dolans to stay at least five yards away 
from the Gambonis. As a condition of the injunction, however, the Gambonis were 
ordered not to communicate with the Dolans or keep them under surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them that when this is all said and done, both are still going to be 
living in the same place, their attorneys are going to have a lot of money and 
they won't have accomplished anything," Soffer offered. 
</P>
<P>
But both sides say they have come too far not to see the court case through to 
its end. 
</P>
<P>
"I have got much better things to do with my time, but I have to defend 
myself," Pat Dolan said. 
</P>
<P>
Gamboni said the dispute has cost him more than $20,000 in legal fees, and he 
has had to take a second mortgage out on his home. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been here for 12 years, and I have a lot of friends in the neighborhood," 
he said. "I am not going to be forced to pull up and move somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TAKE THAT! 
</P>
<P>
In their lawsuit over the placement of a back-yard fence, the Gambonis and the 
Dolans have traded accusations ranging from bizarre to bitter: 
</P>
<P>
CHESTER GAMBONI: 
</P>
<P>
"Judy Dolan has threatened my life over 10 times. She has repeatedly stated 
that if I step on her property that I'm going to die and they will get my 
property." 
</P>
<P>
"Judy Dolan verbally assaulted . . . Hispanic men who sought only to reclaim 
articles from her trash and when confronted with this injustice, she swore 
violently at me and stated, 'Well, at least I'm not a (expletive) Mexican.' " 
</P>
<P>
"My small pedigreed dog has been attacked by someone who sprayed a chemical in 
her face. . . . Now the dog won't go around the corner when Judy Dolan is near. 
The dog goes into a barking frenzy in reaction to Judy talking on her side of 
the fence." 
</P>
<P>
PAT DOLAN: 
</P>
<P>
"In late 1984, (Gamboni) commenced a campaign of constant harassment against my 
family, including my elderly mother . . . contacting pro-Mexican groups and the 
Jewish Defense League, among other groups, calling me a racist . . . regular 
parking in front of my mother's home to intimidate and annoy her . . . 
contacting my last two places of employment, making false accusations in an 
attempt to get me fired . . . almost daily surveillance (i.e. binoculars, 
photographs, eavesdropping) . . . regular hang-up calls, which I substantiated 
by calling back and hearing the same background noise." 
</P>
<P>
JUDY DOLAN: 
</P>
<P>
"Defendant's son and his friends are encouraged to harass my family in 
particular by bouncing baseballs off our car and using foul language." 
</P>
<P>
"Every time we enter the back yard at the rental property (next door to the 
Gambonis), defendant turns floodlights into our back yard, (and) he stands 
behind his fence swearing and glaring at us."

ABORTION, ETHICS TURN SENATE RACE TOPSY-TURVY; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTION: THERE ARE NO CLEAR FAVORITES IN THE BATTLE FOR THE 31ST DISTRICT. 
INCUMBENT LAWMAKERS SEEKING THE VACANT SEAT ARE BEING STUNG BY CHALLENGERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Conventional political wisdom said that Assemblyman Frank Hill, who had climbed 
the ranks and gained the right endorsements, was best positioned as the heir 
apparent to the 31st State Senate District seat left vacant by William 
Campbell's resignation in December. 
</P>
<P>
The prospects brightened for Hill (R-Whittier), the best-financed and 
best-known candidate in the district, when Gov. George Deukmejian in late 
December scheduled a Feb. 6 special election to fill Campbell's seat, making 
the campaign one of the shortest ever in California. 
</P>
<P>
But the campaign for the heavily Republican seat -- which straddles the 
boundary between Los Angeles and Orange counties -- is being watched closely in 
Sacramento because, in the politics of 1990, conventional wisdom is getting a 
thorough review. 
</P>
<P>
In this campaign, two independently wealthy Republican candidates are expected 
to spend almost a combined $1 million of their own money to pound two other 
Republican candidates, Hill and Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach), 
with some of the most thorny issues of the year to confront state-level 
officeholders. 
</P>
<P>
The two Republican challengers are Ron Isles, a Brea city councilman and former 
owner of an electronics manufacturing company, and Gary Miller, a Diamond Bar 
city councilman and owner of a land-banking business. 
</P>
<P>
Both have battered Hill and Ferguson on an issue that might be used against 
many state legislators this year -- ethics. Isles and Miller have campaigned 
hard on an anti-incumbency theme, telling voters that Sacramento is so plagued 
with corruption that they should elect an entirely new Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Polls have shown that the public is receptive to such a message in the wake of 
a series of corruption scandals, including an FBI investigation in Sacramento 
that resulted in the conviction Friday of state Sen. Joseph Montoya 
(D-Whittier). 
</P>
<P>
Hill has been most heavily attacked because he is still a target in that same 
FBI investigation. But Ferguson complained that "they tar the brush over and it 
gets on my name too." 
</P>
<P>
"You could have a guy with impeccable credentials, and if he's in politics 
today, it's to these two guys' (Isles' and Miller's) advantage that they can 
say these guys are all bad," Ferguson said. 
</P>
<P>
Another issue that could play a major role in the outcome Tuesday is abortion. 
</P>
<P>
The pro-choice movement, which was a major factor in two recent state-level 
upset victories, has been working on behalf of Isles, the only pro-choice 
Republican in the race. Pro-choice groups from both Orange and Los Angeles 
counties endorsed Isles, believing that a Democratic victory is unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Isles is using the same formula that Assemblywoman Tricia Hunter 
(R-San Marcos) employed in her victory last summer by appealing to Democratic 
voters to cross party lines and cast their votes on the abortion issue. 
</P>
<P>
"In a low turnout race, a candidate who is pro-abortion and Republican . . . 
can pick up enough Democratic votes on that single issue . . . to tip the 
scales," Ferguson said. "The potential is strong" for a repeat of the Hunter 
race, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Skinner, a Republican leader with Pro-Choice Orange County, said: "I see 
no reason why this should not be a major factor. The people who are working 
with me are people who have never been involved in politics before. It's that 
kind of energy I'm feeling all through Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
Because the candidates are relying almost entirely on direct mail, the campaign 
has been invisible to many, making it hard to predict the outcome. Most 
believe, however, there is no clear front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said a recent poll by state Republicans found the four GOP candidates 
bunched in a tight pack, with Isles and Miller holding a slight edge over 
Ferguson and Hill. However, the poll also showed a large bloc of undecided 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson is counting on Republican-rich South Orange County to make the 
difference for him. And Hill's edge is in his Los Angeles-based Assembly 
district, where he won reelection in 1988 with 63% of the vote even after the 
FBI's investigation was announced. 
</P>
<P>
If none of the candidates receives more than 50% of the vote on Tuesday -- as 
experts predict -- a runoff is scheduled April 10 between the top vote-getters 
in each party. 
</P>
<P>
The 31st Senate District stretches from West Covina and Whittier in the north 
to Laguna Beach in the south. 
</P>
<P>
There are three Democrats in the race and one American Independent Party 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Democrat Janice Graham, who ran unsuccessfully for the 31st Senate seat against 
Campbell in 1988, is hoping to reach the runoff and defeat the Republican 
candidate on either abortion or ethics. 
</P>
<P>
Graham, a former schoolteacher from Laguna Hills who is pro-choice, said she 
would use the abortion issue against any of the candidates with the exception 
of Isles. However, on Friday, she held a press conference to blast Isles for 
purportedly unethical behavior in his business dealings. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate race has been dominated by mudslinging in the mail, at press 
conferences and in an angry exchange at a recent candidates' forum. Hill and 
Ferguson were originally the main targets. But in a possible indication of 
their unexpected strength, the attacks have turned to Isles and Miller. 
</P>
<P>
Isles and Miller have been criticized by their foes for their campaign-reform 
proposals. Both are financing their own campaigns and don't have to solicit 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
And while Isles has blasted his opponents for unethical behavior, he was 
criticized this week for allegedly abusing a tax loophole. Isles is involved in 
a court battle with the Internal Revenue Service about how much he should pay 
in taxes for a company that he located in the Virgin Islands. 
</P>
<P>
Isles' critics have charged that the location of the company was intended to 
avoid taxes. He said, however, the dispute is over different interpretations of 
the tax law. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, opponents of Miller accused him this week of misconduct related to 
his land-banking business. 
</P>
<P>
Miller was accused of profiting on a land deal as a result of his negotiations 
as a city official for a new road in Diamond Bar. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said, however, that he told officials about the property he owned before 
he was appointed negotiator. He said the property has since been sold and that 
he did not profit from the decision. 
</P>
<P>
Miller attributed the charges to his emergence as a threat to Hill and 
Ferguson. He said that they and other legislators should fear his campaign's 
theme of running against the government in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
"I shined the light on something here," he said. "It's going to be a tough year 
in Sacramento for incumbents. If I win this thing, they better doggone start 
shaking."

TEENS TAKE SIDES IN POLITICAL ACTIVIST CLUB;

<P>
When it comes to politics, Irvine High School sophomores Felicia Bleecker and 
Rita Ravindra don't agree on much. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, it was after a series of impassioned arguments in a history class 
during the 1988 presidential election that the pair set aside their differences 
and came up with the idea for a high-school club designed for students 
interested in politics and government. 
</P>
<P>
Six months after Activists for Political Awareness was born, Ravindra and 
Bleecker still spar about everything from family planning to Eastern Europe. 
But they do so as co-presidents of the club. 
</P>
<P>
Now 30 members strong, the club attracts a solid lineup of speakers. Last 
month, it sponsored a special school assembly during which Rep. C. Christopher 
Cox (R-Newport Beach) spoke and answered students' questions. 
</P>
<P>
While members admit having fierce political opinions, the club attempts to 
remain nonpartisan. To this end, each office is held by two people -- one 
conservative and one liberal. 
</P>
<P>
Bleecker is a die-hard conservative whose stationery boasts American flags and 
elephants; she hands out business cards that read: "Republican Felicia 
Bleecker." 
</P>
<P>
Ravindra, who has liberal leanings, bravely displayed a Michael Dukakis bumper 
sticker during the last presidential election, despite the snickers from some 
classmates in the heavily Republican community. 
</P>
<P>
Although the club's weekly discussions are often emotional, members insist 
there are rarely any hard feelings. 
</P>
<P>
"We get dirty in our debates. . . . Sometimes, I want to rip her head off," 
Bleecker said of Ravindra. "But we always remain friends." 
</P>
<P>
When the pair began planning for the club's first meeting, their biggest fear 
was that only a few students would show up. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of people around here who don't know what's going on," said 
June Fang, a junior and the club's Democratic vice president. "They don't know 
who the chief justice of the Supreme Court is, but they do know who Judge 
Wapner is." 
</P>
<P>
To the organizers' surprise, 20 to 30 students attended the first meeting, and 
400 heard Cox's speech last month. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot of people who are interested in politics are isolated on 
campus," Bleecker said. "This is the first club of its kind. . . . Something 
more than football and cheerleading." 
</P>
<P>
Other activist clubs such as Amnesty International exist on the Irvine campus, 
but unlike those groups that are involved in a specific cause or issue, 
Activists for Political Awareness deals specifically with government and 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
"There isn't a lot of interest generally in partisan politics right now," said 
Greg Gray, social science teacher and club sponsor. "That's what makes this 
different." 
</P>
<P>
The paths that brought club members to the political beliefs they now hold are 
diverse. 
</P>
<P>
Fang, for example, said her parents are open-minded and tolerate her liberal 
views, even though her father works in the defense industry and supports 
Republican candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Bleecker's situation is the opposite: Her parents are Democrats while she holds 
conservative beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
"They're the biggest bleeding-heart liberals. Oh, they were hippies. It's so 
scary, I can't even describe it. They're for peace and freedom and liberty," 
Bleecker said. "At the dinner table, we're always kicking around some issue." 
</P>
<P>
Bleecker credits her grandmother for getting her interested in Republican 
politics, but acknowledged that her parents thought it was important "for me to 
be my own person." 
</P>
<P>
While club members strive for a nonpartisan atmosphere, they are the first to 
admit that the community they live in is overwhelmingly conservative. This 
makes it easier for the group to attract Republican guests than ones from the 
Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
At the Cox assembly, the issues that most concerned students were the 
environment, the invasion of Panama, changes in Eastern Europe, abortion, 
homelessness and the federal deficit, Bleecker said. 
</P>
<P>
Bleecker and Ravindra agree that teen-agers need to become better informed and 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
"In the next decade, people are going to have to be aware of what's going on," 
Ravindra said. "If not, things are going to get bad." 
</P>
<P>
Added Bleecker: "Society looks down on high-school students as not caring, 
being on drugs and all that. But we're the next generation. We're the future."

CHILLY RAINSTORM FROM ALASKA DUE TO SOAK SOUTHLAND TODAY 
</P>

A series of winter storms that began moving into Southern California overnight 
is expected to keep the Southland damp and chilly through the early part of the 
week, meteorologists said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
By dawn today, rainy weather is expected to hit much of Southern California, 
said Coralie Cushny, a spokeswoman for WeatherData of Wichita, Kan., a 
meteorology service that provides forecasts to The Times. 
</P>
<P>
The storm is expected to linger throughout the day and could drop more than a 
half inch of rain in the Los Angeles basin and more than a foot of snow in the 
local mountains. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a pretty big storm for Southern California," Cushny said. "It's pretty 
dry there and you don't normally get that much rain in one storm." 
</P>
<P>
Following a pattern similar to the storm that blew through Southern California 
last week, the weather system "came diving down from the Gulf of Alaska," 
Cushny said. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the storm is expected to keep temperatures throughout the day in 
the high 50s and the low 60s, Cushny said. Overnight temperatures for tonight 
are expected to dip to the low 40s. 
</P>
<P>
After experiencing a clearing on Monday, Cushny said, the area is expected to 
receive more rainfall on Tuesday and Wednesday as the jet stream pulls more 
cold, moist air from the icy waters off Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
Snow levels in the Tehachepi Mountains are expected to drop to 4,000 feet as a 
result of the series of storms. Gusting winds, drifting snow and areas of dense 
fog are expected to further complicate mountain travel. 
</P>
<P>
The forecast calls for partly cloudy skies on Thursday, Cushny said.

As drill team girls stamped their tasseled boots to the pounding rhythm of a 
Compton drum squad, Toni Jackson hooted her approval at the jumping, twirling, 
clapping, red-and-white-skirted marchers. 
</P>
<P>
"Get down! All right!" she shouted and waved her arms amid a throng of cheering 
spectators lined along Main Street Saturday for the 11th annual Black History 
Parade. 
</P>
<P>
"All this shows that not all blacks are in gangs or homeless," said Jackson, 
45, of West Covina. "We're making something of ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
The Black History Parade commemorates the contributions of American blacks and 
the progress that blacks have made. The street procession and a Unity Festival 
afterward is one of the few celebrations for black pride countywide. 
</P>
<P>
Police estimated that 2,000 turned out for the marching bands, rifle-twirling 
Junior ROTC cadets and convertible-riding black celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
A robed gospel choir, seated on hay bales on the back of a 50-foot truck, sang 
their way to first place in the float awards. Motley-haired clowns in 
fluorescent garb bicycled in circles. Sequined and feathered cheerleading 
squads danced and cartwheeled to the thumping rhythms of drum teams and blaring 
portable stereos. 
</P>
<P>
With few other large activities locally to attend together, blacks scattered 
thinly all over Orange County rarely have a moment to reflect collectively on 
their common heritage, many said. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to show that I'm proud of my people," said Diedra Barber, 16, of 
Tustin. "We can do more than play basketball and football. It's nice to see 
other black people from Orange County active in the community." 
</P>
<P>
Many parents said they brought their children not only because youngsters like 
parades, but because they believed the kids would take pride in their race's 
culture and see role models. They said they hoped their children would learn of 
the contributions of black Americans that often are glossed over in school 
history classes. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hoping to give the kids in the black ghetto hope that you can come out of 
the ghetto, that dope dealing is not the only thing," said Roy Fegan, 29, who 
acted in director Robert Townsend's movie "Partners in Crime," and who rode in 
the parade. 
</P>
<P>
Parade Grand Marshal Robin Harris, who was featured in three Spike Lee movies, 
including "Do The Right Thing," yelled jovially at children on the curb from 
his green convertible.

DRIVER GOING 'EXTREMELY FAST' ON FREEWAY IS THE SOLE FATALITY IN FIERY 5-CAR 
PILE-UP

A 23-year-old Beverly Hills man was killed after his speeding car struck a 
center divider on the San Diego Freeway in a spectacular crash that triggered a 
five-car pile-up and closed the southbound lanes for nearly two hours Saturday 
morning, the California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
"We figure he was going 80-plus (m.p.h.), probably closer to 90," said CHP 
Officer Lyle Whitten. 
</P>
<P>
The man, identified by the Orange County coroner's office as Arthur J. 
Bautista, was driving just south of the Springdale Street exit in a Subaru 
coupe about 6 a.m. when he sideswiped a Mitsubishi Mirage driven by Lisa 
Toumajian, 19, of Hermosa Beach, Whitten said. 
</P>
<P>
Both drivers lost control, and the Subaru veered to the left and slammed into 
the center divider just north of the Garden Grove Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
"He was going at such a rate of speed that he rolled up onto the center divider 
wall, went airborne and hit an 18-inch-diameter freeway signpost, head-on, 
about 10 feet above ground level," Whitten said. "He was going extremely fast. 
. . . The car almost wrapped its way around the post." 
</P>
<P>
Bautista apparently was killed instantly, a spokesman for the coroner's office 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Seconds later, Whitten said, the Subaru slid down into the car pool lane and 
exploded in flames. 
</P>
<P>
A passing motorist, Brandon Newcomb, 29, of Buena Park, stopped, saw that 
Bautista was still inside, and pulled him from the burning car, Whitten said. 
</P>
<P>
As Newcomb was carrying Bautista away from the fiery wreck, a van drove up, 
swerved to avoid Newcomb, but struck the burning Subaru, Whitten said. The 
family in the van was not injured, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Next, a Ford pickup drove up behind them. That motorist managed to avoid 
hitting the burning wreck and the van, but failed to see Toumajian's 
Mitsubishi, which had skidded 200 feet down the freeway and was stopped in a 
middle lane, Whitten said. 
</P>
<P>
"He hit her broadside," Whitten said. "Then his pickup overturned." 
</P>
<P>
The pickup was sliding down the freeway on its side when it was struck by a 
fifth car, a Toyota van. Neither of the drivers was injured.

EDUCATION IS THE KEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County leaders would do well to carefully study the results of a recent 
survey of the county's Latino community. While many areas of concern were 
examined, including housing, employment and health, the bottom line was this: 
Education is the most important way to bring the Latino community into the 
county's economic and political mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the survey outlined severe shortcomings -- ranging from 
language problems in elementary schools to student-dropout rates -- in 
providing the know-how Latinos need to compete in this area's ever more 
technological marketplace. The failure to adequately address these educational 
problems affects not only the Latino community but all of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The comprehensive two-year study, the first of its kind in the county, was 
conducted by the nonprofit Tomas Rivera Center in Claremont. In all, 400 
residents and 120 Latino leaders were interviewed. Finally, groups of leaders 
participated in "focus groups" aimed at assessing the needs and priorities of 
the county's Latinos. The findings are expected to be used as a resource by 200 
county public and private policy-setting agencies in dealing with the county's 
440,000 Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
The survey revealed some interesting findings. For example, it found that 
discrimination was felt more strongly among Latinos who had spent more time in 
the educational system, although no explanation was given for this. It noted 
that, while the number of poor Latinos is extremely high, the county is also 
home to some of the wealthiest Latinos in California -- a reflection of the 
area's general affluence. And the survey found that traffic congestion, a 
nearly obsessive concern among Orange Countians in general, was of minor import 
to Latinos. They simply had more pressing things to think about. 
</P>
<P>
But the most compelling results outlined by the survey touched on education. 
Less than half of the Latinos in Orange County surveyed said they had completed 
the 12th grade, while 7% indicated they have never attended school at all. On 
the average, Latinos completed the freshman year in high school. 
</P>
<P>
The survey also noted that many minority children are not prepared to enter 
schools whose environment and language are foreign to them. 
</P>
<P>
While calling upon additional help from government, charities and private 
enterprise, the Latinos leaders surveyed looked to themselves as part of the 
solution. They saw that more Latino representation on local school boards was 
needed, as well as a continuing demand for teachers who are better prepared to 
deal with a multi-ethnic school population. 
</P>
<P>
Latino leaders also came up with many noteworthy recommendations, particularly 
those that emphasized that educational intervention should take place in early 
childhood. Specifically, they suggested increasing bilingual education, 
starting dropout- prevention programs at the lower grade levels and increasing 
early intervention programs designed to improve student achievement. 
</P>
<P>
The survey is a thorough and serious look at the county's largest minority 
population. It should be used as a guide for future programs aimed at opening 
up opportunities to all of Orange County's residents.

CHILDREN SHOW THE WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
South County's severe water shortage can hardly be solved by children. But it's 
still encouraging to see that third- and fourth-graders at six schools in San 
Clemente study ways to save water. 
</P>
<P>
Partly because of rapid growth and water-delivery problems, San Clemente has 
been hard hit by a water shortage. The City Council on Wednesday will consider 
an ordinance that would encourage -- and if the situation worsens, require -- 
residents and businesses to conserve water. Elsewhere in Orange County, the 
state's drought conditions are lowering reservoirs. 
</P>
<P>
To emphasize the value of conservation, the San Clemente schools are staging 
art and essay contests. The prizes: $50 savings bonds. It's a small step, but 
an important one. Conservation is a lesson that must be learned by young people 
if water is to continue to flow freely for the next generation.

TERM IN LEASE AGREEMENT IS QUESTIONED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On Dec. 12, the Laguna Beach City Council voted to change the zoning of all 
mobile home parks in Laguna Beach to "mobile home park zone only." Also, they 
put a 70-day moratorium on the rents to give the tenants and owners time to 
work out the terms of a lease. 
</P>
<P>
The lease that has been offered to us has a covenant that states, "Each tenant 
is not to engage in activities in opposition to the park owners application for 
development approvals." The term "activities" includes a tenant's participation 
at a public hearing, study session or other public forum . . . and attendance 
at meetings or conversations with public officials and the press in which 
sentiments in opposition to the development approvals are expressed. 
</P>
<P>
My wife and I believe it is more important that we retain our right to be heard 
publicly concerning the development of the park than that we live in Treasure 
Island or are forced out by a 20% rent increase if we don't sign. 
</P>
<P>
The people of Laguna Beach have elected a City Council and a mayor to make 
decisions concerning development that would be good for the entire community. 
If the developers can muzzle the opposition to their development, then elected 
officials will have a difficult time making a decision that is best for the 
entire city because they have not heard both sides.

FOUR WAYS TO LOOK AT DEUKMEJIAN'S EMPLOYEE HEALTH INSURANCE PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLEN SEVERONI, Ellen Severoni is president of California Health Decisions. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Deukmejian Administration recently proposed a plan that would require every 
business -- extending even to the self-employed -- to provide health insurance 
to its workers. If implemented, the proposal would give California one of the 
most ambitious state-mandated health insurance programs in the nation. The 
Times asked four Orange County residents who are either knowledgeable about the 
health-care field or who would have a vested interest in the implementation of 
such an all-encompassing program to share their opinions -- positive and 
negative -- about the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
At least 5 million Californians are without health insurance; an unknown 
additional number are underinsured. Although some of these people manage 
without health care, the costs of caring for the rest are shifted to taxpayers 
in a variety of ways. Other significant costs to society are lost productivity 
and a drain on other social services as a result of lost earning power and 
increased dependence by these families on government. 
</P>
<P>
By addressing the issue of access to health care, the governor has joined those 
of us who are working to find solutions. I applaud his initiative and think 
this proposal is a move in the right direction. Focusing attention on the issue 
is a necessary first step. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, by mandating business to provide health insurance to its 
employees, will inject new dollars into a complicated "system." Past experience 
teaches us that funds alone are not a solution, that these funds have tended to 
lead to an upward spiral of health-care costs. It is not clear how costs will 
be monitored and constrained while physicians and hospitals will be encouraged 
to participate in Medi-Cal in increasing numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Additional funding seems a necessary but not sufficient step toward universal 
access to cost-effective care. Furthermore, a way to track utilization of these 
new benefits to ensure that they are used appropriately will be needed. 
</P>
<P>
A critical issue is the definition of what care these newly insured will have 
access to. Who will set the priorities for these benefits, and by what 
mechanisms? Agreement on what constitutes adequate or even basic benefits is 
best achieved on a local or county level, rather than on a statewide basis. I 
believe that the state should support local efforts to reach such consensus and 
the counties should be assured their fair share of funding and freedom in the 
administration of the governor's program. 
</P>
<P>
The governor's desire to address the plight of the medically uninsured is most 
welcome. 
</P>
<P>
His proposal is neither comprehensive nor a panacea, but it deserves careful 
study. The concept of a public-private partnership is increasingly accepted as 
a means of creating innovative solutions to a "system" that has had too little 
systematic planning to earn respect from those who are its consumers.

OPPOSING SIDES STATE CASE: TO SPRAY OR NOT TO SPRAY?

<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding the protests by Co Long Pham and others that agricultural officials 
have failed to adequately warn the Vietnamese community (in their own language) 
in Orange County's Medfly spraying area, (Jan. 25), I have two questions: 
First, why have they lived in Orange County for more than a decade and not 
learned English yet; and secondly, are Pham and Yudelson aware that we voters 
established English as our official language a few years ago via Proposition 
62? 
</P>
<P>
I have no grudge against members of any racial or ethnic group who come to live 
in America. But if you want to be aware and informed, then buckle down and 
learn the language!

RILEY'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE QUALITY OF LIFE

So Supervisor Thomas F. Riley's name is to adorn the new passenger terminal at 
Orange County Airport. How fitting that this man, who has single-handedly done 
more to overpopulate Orange County and obliterate natural open space as an 
Orange County supervisor, should be so honored. 
</P>
<P>
As passengers stream out of this new terminal to the inevitable traffic jam in 
any direction from the airport, may they pause a moment (there will be many) to 
reflect on this man's "contribution" to Orange County's quality of life.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Chinese Students Issue 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 390 to 25, the House overrode President Bush's veto of legislation 
(HR 2712) to prevent the deportation of up to 40,000 Chinese students when 
their visas expire. But the veto held when the Senate failed to muster the 
two-thirds majority it needed to join the House in defeating it. 
</P>
<P>
Congress passed the bill last year after the Tian An Men Square massacre of 
pro-democracy demonstrators. The President countered with an executive order to 
achieve the same goals. Congressional critics said a law, not an order that can 
be instantly lifted, is needed to protect the students against being returned 
home to face possible persecution. 
</P>
<P>
James Traficant (D-Ohio) said: "Maybe our President is going to kowtow to a 
repressive Chinese government, but this Congress should not. It's time to put 
your vote where your rhetoric is." 
</P>
<P>
Minority Leader Robert Michel (R-Ill.) said: "President Bush knows China as 
well if not better than any member of this House . . . " and "must be given the 
room to make the foreign policy moves he feels are in the long-range best 
interests of our country." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes wanted to override the veto.

To Delay Veto Vote 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 137 to 276, the House refused to send President Bush's veto of the 
Chinese students bill to the Foreign Affairs and Judiciary committees. The GOP 
motion sought to delay a floor vote the President appeared certain to lose. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Leach (R-Iowa), who supported the committee referral, said: "What is at 
issue today is not a question of indignation, but of judgment -- how America 
can play a constructive role in moderating Chinese institutions and 
liberalizing their policies." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) said, "This is not a time to temporize, this is 
not a time to delay."

Members voting yes wanted to delay a veto vote.

UCI COMES CLOSE, BUT SUCCUMBS TO PACIFIC

<TEXT>
<P>
A victory for UC Irvine was dangling there, closer than at any time in recent 
weeks, against the University of the Pacific Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
A Bren Center crowd of 1,823 sensed a victory was close at hand. The Anteaters 
seemed to sense it too. Even Pacific appeared worried it would be the team that 
lost to Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Irvine blew a 14-point lead that it had built in the first half, 
missed two shots in the final five seconds and lost, 76-75. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine, losers of 12 consecutive games but playing as well as it has all 
season, trailed Pacific by a point. Five seconds remained as the Anteaters 
inbounded the ball at midcourt following a timeout. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters' Dylan Rigdon, who had made six of 10 shots from the field, 
including five of eight three-pointers, took the pass and dribbled toward the 
basket. Rigdon, a freshman guard, pulled up 10 feet from the basket and 
launched an awkward-looking jump shot with the Tigers' Dell Demps hounding him 
and three seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
The ball clanged off the back of the rim and into the hands of Jeff Von Lutzow, 
whose hurried follow hit the side of the backboard at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
And Irvine (2-18 overall, 0-11 in the Big West Conference) had lost its 13th 
consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I should have taken it to the hole instead of pulling up," Rigdon 
said. "I was counting in my head. I had a good idea (how much time was left)." 
</P>
<P>
The play was designed to go to Rod Palmer, Rigdon said, "but they took it away, 
so I cut to the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure I'll be thinking about this for days, weeks, months." 
</P>
<P>
Rigdon had a career-high 22 points as Irvine seemed primed for its first 
victory since a 75-62 triumph over San Diego State Dec. 16. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters built a season-high 14-point lead, 30-16, after a dunk by Von 
Lutzow with 5:10 left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
But Pacific (12-8, 5-6) chipped away and trailed at halftime, 35-33. 
</P>
<P>
The lead changed hands in the second half with Pacific taking the lead for 
good, 68-67, on Demps' three-pointer with 3:36 left. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Irvine cut the lead to 76-75 on a three-pointer by Rigdon with 11 
seconds left. The Anteaters then fouled Anthony Woods, who missed a 
one-and-one, setting up Rigdon's unsuccessful shot. 
</P>
<P>
"We stole that game," said Demps, who had 26 points on 11-of-14 shooting from 
the field. "They (the Anteaters) were winning practically the whole game. They 
played well enough to win." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Coach Bill Mulligan has grown weary of that familiar refrain. 
</P>
<P>
"That's nine of 11 (Big West) games we should have won," he said. "It's the 
same old B.S. Nobody wants to hear that . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Then, picking up steam, he said, "It's like, 'How are we gonna lose this one?' 
</P>
<P>
"They blow the one-and-one. I thought we got a pretty good shot and everybody 
in the arena thought Rigdon got fouled. Notice I didn't say I thought he was 
fouled." 
</P>
<P>
The last-second play was executed well enough, Mulligan said. 
</P>
<P>
"The ball ended up with a guy who's a big-time free throw shooter and who makes 
three-point shots in games." 
</P>
<P>
Three other Anteaters scored in double figures. Palmer added 17 points, Von 
Lutzow 14 and Ricky Butler 11. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific's Don Lyttle had 19 points and Daryl Wolfe added 16. 
</P>
<P>
Anteater Notes 
</P>
<P>
This date in Anteater history or where have all the good times gone? A year 
ago, playing before a sellout crowd of 5,000 at the Bren Center, Irvine rallied 
from nine points to beat Nevada Las Vegas, 99-98. Ricky Butler had a then 
career-high 25 points, hitting 17 of 19 free throws. Jeff Herdman added 24 
points as the Anteaters shot 76% from the field in the second half, 56% for the 
game. The Anteaters also made 36 of 43 (84%) from the line. The victory gave 
Irvine an 8-12 record on the way to a 12-17 finish. 
</P>
<P>
If the season ended today, Irvine and Pacific would play in the opening round 
of the Big West tournament March 7.

Cal State Dominguez Hills pulled away in the second half to defeat Chapman, 
56-47, in a California Collegiate Athletic Assn. men's basketball game Saturday 
night in Hutton Center.

seconds into the second half, but the Panthers failed to score a point over the 
next 7:40. Chris Martin made a three-pointer to bring Chapman within five 
points at 30-25, but the Panthers then went another five minutes without 
scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Reyes made two free throws with 5:52 remaining, but Chapman was behind, 43-28. 
The Panthers made a mini-run in the game's final minutes, with Martin and Kevin

had four three-pointers in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent Washington scored 16 for Dominguez Hills, and Brian Johnson held 
Chapman's leading scorer, Roger Middleton, to 11 points -- only one of which 
came in the second half. MARTIN BECK

Rancho Santiago College's Mike Hunter made four consecutive key plays late in 
the second half to help the Dons to an 83-75 victory over Saddleback Saturday 
in an Orange Empire Conference basketball game at Saddleback. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago led, 55-34, with 15:45 to play, but Saddleback rallied to pull 
within 68-66 on a reverse layup by Matt Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago moved ahead, 70-66, on two free throws by Matt Lein, then 
Hunter went to work. He had a steal and later made two free throws to put the 
Dons ahead, 72-66, with 2:59 left. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback then came downcourt but Hunter intercepted a pass again. He later 
got the ball on the baseline, made a short jumper and was fouled. He made the 
free throw and Rancho Santiago led, 75-66, with 2:03 left. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter, who is normally first off the bench, started Saturday for Corie Blount, 
who has been ill the past week. Hunter finished with 14 points for Rancho 
Santiago (24-2, 7-1).

DEVELOPMENT: KOLL'S WINNING WAYS APPEAR TO BE CONTINUING THESE DAYS. DESPITE A 
DOWNTURN IN THE REAL ESTATE BUSINESS, THE COMPANY ROLLS ON AT A BREAKNECK PACE.

NEWPORT BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 16-acre wasteland in the heart of Anaheim's downtown had become something 
of an embarrassment for civic leaders. The dusty vacant lots beckoned 
developers, yet more than a decade passed without solid prospects for a renewal 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Now comes The Koll Co. 
</P>
<P>
After scrutinizing the property for years, the Newport Beach-based development 
firm interested Pacific Bell in a new office tower on the Anaheim site. The 
Koll Co. announced last month that it hopes to construct a $200-million complex 
including a hotel, movie theater and other office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to wait for the right pieces to fall into place," explained Richard 
Ortwein, president of Koll's Southern California division. "It was a win for 
everyone." 
</P>
<P>
Such successes appear to be coming easily these days for Koll. Despite a 
downturn in the real estate business, Koll continues to develop, build and 
lease its buildings at a breakneck pace. 
</P>
<P>
"Their growth has been nothing short of phenomenal," said Jim Kruse, senior 
vice president for Schneider Commercial Real Estate in Anaheim. "They are a 
top-drawer developer." 
</P>
<P>
The company, founded by Orange County contractor Donald M. Koll, has emerged as 
one of the largest commercial developers in the nation. The company's 
construction subsidiary alone is ranked 16th nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Much of its success is tied to its strategy of putting the entire development 
process -- site acquisition, construction and leasing -- under one roof. 
</P>
<P>
Another reason is that the firm's prosperity was built from other people's 
money. Instead of obtaining bank loans for projects, Koll finds pension funds, 
insurance companies or other entities to kick in the cash for a deal. Koll 
contributes the company's building and development expertise. 
</P>
<P>
When the building is completed and occupied, the joint-venture partner 
generally gets paid back first. Then Koll Co. and the partner split the 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
The joint-venture arrangement allows Koll to become involved in larger projects 
than would normally be possible through bank borrowing. And unlike a bank, 
well-financed joint-venture partners do not demand a mortgage payment every 
month, so they can be more patient during periodic real estate market 
downturns. 
</P>
<P>
The credit for these strategies generally goes to Koll, a low-key, dapper man 
in his 50s with a Donald Trump-like love of deal-making. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Trump, however, Koll disdains the limelight. Two years ago, after Forbes 
magazine listed him as one of the 400 richest people in America, he called up 
the magazine's editors and convinced them he really wasn't so wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
"Make the company the story. I'm just a team player," Koll implored a reporter 
during an interview for this article. 
</P>
<P>
The Newport Beach developer is tackling projects as diverse -- and potentially 
risky -- as a shopping center in economically depressed Texas and beach resorts 
in Baja California. Swank office buildings are still being built at the 
$1-billion Koll Center Irvine, the company's largest project. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, Koll Co. is building an office tower on the site of the old 
Church of the Open Door that became known for its "Jesus Saves" neon sign. 
</P>
<P>
Besides construction and development, Koll Co. is moving into the land 
business. Clinching the biggest deal in its 28-year history, the company 
announced plans last month to buy parcels in 19 states from Union Pacific Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Union Pacific's decision to unload 15,000 acres and 30 buildings to Koll for 
$532 million was viewed by analysts as a positive step toward consolidating the 
many diverse operations of the railroad-dominated company. 
</P>
<P>
The transaction easily topped Koll's previous biggest deal: the $300-million 
acquisition last July of industrial and office properties from Wells Fargo 
Mortgage &amp; Equity Trust. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the massiveness of Koll Co.'s recent undertakings, the firm's record 
has proven so reliable that few industry observers question its ability to 
manage so many different projects. 
</P>
<P>
"The most interesting thing that sets (Koll) apart from the rest of the pack is 
his uncanny ability to get through difficult times with a minimum of effort," 
said Bill Russell, senior vice president for Aetna Realty Investors Inc. in 
Hartford, Conn., a longtime Koll joint-venture partner. "You hear about the big 
boys gasping for air. Koll gets through." 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Koll was the envy of Orange County developers in 1986 when a new, 
11-story tower at its Irvine complex was 90% leased while competitors were 
struggling to lease half of their new buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"The good buildings rent even in the bad times," Koll said. 
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, Koll Co. has doubled the amount of building space under 
its wing to 38.2 million square feet. The value of its property holdings has 
doubled to $4.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the tough market for new buildings, Koll has leased nearly 80% of one 
new high-rise in Koll Center Irvine and more than half of a second tower, 
according to Ray Wirta, president of Koll's leasing and property management. 
</P>
<P>
The Koll Construction Co. subsidiary has doubled its volume over the same 
five-year period to an estimated $725 million in 1990. Now, it has set a goal 
of $1 billion within five years, which its managers say they hope to achieve by 
courting more business outside of the Koll Co. 
</P>
<P>
Koll could have hardly ever dreamed of such a company back when he first 
arrived in Orange County in the late 1950s after a stint as an Air Force pilot. 
He worked in a cousin's house-building business for a while, then started his 
company as a general contractor in 1962. Soon, he hit upon the idea of small, 
multi-tenant industrial buildings set in landscaped, campus-like settings. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew there was a market for a little guy," he explained. One of Koll's first 
moves was getting himself known to Orange County's "big guy," The Irvine Co., 
which sat on the lion's share of developable land. 
</P>
<P>
"The dress in this town used to be Topsiders and blue denim and Hawaiian 
shirts, believe it or not. Even the bankers wore that," Koll said. "And all of 
a sudden the Irvine Co. brought all these guys in three-piece suits and black 
shoes . . . and the locals were frankly scared. "I said to myself, 'I don't 
know anybody. Maybe I ought to work with these guys.' " 
</P>
<P>
It was the Irvine Co. that sold Koll 100 acres in the shadow of John Wayne 
Airport, where he built the Airport Business Park, his firm's first big 
development success. 
</P>
<P>
In 1972, the company obtained another 125 acres on the east side of the airport 
for construction of Koll Center Newport. The project marked the realization of 
a prediction that Koll has reportedly voiced long before: that MacArthur 
Boulevard would become the Wilshire Boulevard of Orange County. The story stuck 
around largely because no one at the time believed the builder-turned-prophet. 
</P>
<P>
"I had difficulty sharing the vision," acknowledges Tim Strader, an early Koll 
partner who went on to form his own real estate-development concern. 
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, the boulevard, from the San Diego Freeway past John Wayne Airport, 
has become a thicket of mid-rise office buildings and hotels cloaked by parking 
lots and trees. If it lacked the glitter and urban grit of L.A.'s Wilshire 
District, it was a reasonable Orange County approximation. 
</P>
<P>
Koll plays down his role as a prognosticator. It was a simple matter of 
deduction, he said. The Irvine Co. had planned for the business hub of the area 
to be closer to the beach, but a planned freeway to the site never was built. 
That left the airport area, which was close to the San Diego Freeway and a 
natural for office development, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Koll Center Newport was a hit with investors. 
</P>
<P>
"Koll Center Newport is one of the original developments in what now looks like 
one of the great meccas of California real estate. . . . It's been an 
enormously successful project," Aetna's Russell said. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, Koll's company was expanding. He did not just hire his top 
executives, he took them on as partners. With a slice of the profits, he made 
many of them wealthy. Some are now retired; others started their own companies, 
often in the image of Koll Co. 
</P>
<P>
"It was fun and it was tiring. It was absolutely exhilarating," said Strader, a 
Koll Co. partner and legal counsel from 1972 to 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Koll has prospered, but don't try to ask him just how much. 
</P>
<P>
A buddy of billionaire Irvine Co. owner Donald L. Bren, Koll was listed by 
Forbes Magazine in 1987 as being worth an estimated $300 million, placing him 
277th on the list of the 400 richest people in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
By 1988, when Koll Co. reported the value of its holdings had risen by $600 
million over the previous year, Koll disappeared from the Forbes list. He said 
he talked to the list's compilers in New York and tried to explain that he is 
not as rich as he might appear. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked to the guy the next year (1988). I said, 'Look, if you buy a house 
for $100,000, does that mean you are worth $100,000?' I own a smaller share of 
it," Koll said. 
</P>
<P>
Koll, in fact, seems to drip with modesty. "We should put all these guys' names 
on the door instead of mine. I just happened to have been the first one here," 
he said. But others, both inside and outside the company, describe Koll as "a 
legitimate Wunderkind" with "an uncanny ability to read markets," as real 
estate executive Kruse puts it. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Koll Co. remains very much a decentralized organization. Its 
branch-development offices are run as largely independent operations. Koll said 
it is in keeping with his belief that real estate must be conducted at the 
local level by representatives who know the area. 
</P>
<P>
Since Koll owns his own construction company, it is easier for the development 
staff to work with the builders. "It is a tremendous advantage to be able to 
walk three doors down and talk to the guys who are going to build your 
building," said Rick Stephens, president of Koll's Los Angeles division. 
</P>
<P>
Koll points to the development, construction and leasing combination in his 
company as one of its strongest assets. 
</P>
<P>
"You control it all," Koll said. "You control the cost of construction and we 
control the cost of property management, and we actively manage our properties 
instead of just collecting the rent and hoping somebody's going to be there." 
</P>
<P>
The construction end of the Koll Co. has become increasingly important as the 
real estate market has tightened. While Koll said that development activity is 
off by about 25%, the company has the construction company as an added buffer 
against bad times. 
</P>
<P>
Having already tackled tasks ranging from constructing 35-story office 
buildings to the Independence Hall replica at Knott's Berry Farm, the firm 
wants to expand its market by building hospitals and other health-care 
buildings, said Vic Laidlaw, senior vice president of Koll Construction. 
</P>
<P>
The development arm, too, is headed in new directions. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, the company is trying to develop more medium-sized shopping 
centers built around one or more low-overhead, high-volume discount centers, 
such as a K mart or a Circuit City Superstore, Koll said. Called "power 
centers," they are planned or under development by Koll in Rancho Santa 
Margarita, San Jose, Ft. Worth, and Bellingham, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
The Koll Co. has also undertaken downtown redevelopment projects, such as the 
recently announced Anaheim project, which is already winning kudos from the 
city planning staff. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Koll is one of the best developers we've worked with," said Anaheim 
Community Development Director Elisa Stipkovitch. "They don't have an overly 
burdensome, decision-making process. They try to make everyone a winner in the 
deal and that's positive." 
</P>
<P>
Besides making inroads as far east as Texas, Koll Co. is also looking south of 
the border to Mexico. Already, the firm has built what it hopes will become a 
successful industrial park for companies doing business in the United States 
that want to take advantage of plentiful -- and low-cost -- Mexican labor. 
</P>
<P>
In Cabo San Lucas in southern Baja California, Koll has plans to develop the 
Hotel Palmilla into a world-class resort with 200 rooms and two championship 
golf courses. He also has another 3,000 hotel rooms in mind for another resort 
on 2,000 acres of oceanfront property. 
</P>
<P>
"I just like Mexico a lot," Koll said. "I've been flying down there for years 
and I like the place and it seems so logical to have a resort there." 
</P>
<P>
While he continues to branch out, Koll said, there are limits. He said he plans 
to continue to follow the market, switching the company's strategies to fit. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to be the biggest company in the world. We don't want to be 
nationwide. We just want to provide quality work," he said. 
</P>

FIRM'S SOFTWARE OFFERS ELECTRONIC EFFICIENCY FOR TAXING TIMES; 
</P>
<P>
TAXES: SOFTVIEW INC., AN OXNARD MAKER OF TAX PREPARATION SOFTWARE, HOPES TO 
CASH IN ON THE IRS PUSH TOWARD ON-LINE TAX FILING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MEDEARIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Kathleen Lane, president of Softview Inc., an Oxnard computer software company, 
is wagering that her company will make a bundle on the Internal Revenue 
Service's campaign to encourage taxpayers to file their tax forms 
electronically, instead of by mail. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, Softview, with $3.8 million in sales last year, has grown nicely by 
becoming the only company that makes a complete tax preparation software kit 
that works on the popular Apple Macintosh home computer. Its tax software, 
called MacInTax, costs about $100. 
</P>
<P>
Tax preparation software is a promising field, with more than 100 firms in the 
business. Instead of taking their taxes to an accountant, people with 
Macintoshes can use MacInTax to calculate their debt to Uncle Sam. The software 
puts simulated tax forms on the computer screen, calculates an individual's 
taxes based on information that is punched in on the keyboard, and prints out 
finished tax forms, which the taxpayer then mails to the IRS. 
</P>
<P>
Softview is hoping to double its sales this year by getting into the electronic 
tax-filing business. The IRS, in hopes of becoming more efficient, is urging 
taxpayers to file their forms electronically. In 1989, about 1.2 million 
taxpayers filed their forms electronically, but the IRS hopes to lure about 100 
million people by 1994. The IRS says electronic tax filings cut down on errors: 
About 16% of tax returns filed through the mail have mistakes, compared to 
about 3% of electronic filings. Part of the reason, the IRS says, is the 
electronically filed reports are more likely to have their math 
computer-checked. 
</P>
<P>
Why would taxpayers bother with electronic tax filings? Simple: It might speed 
up their tax refunds. A spokesman for the IRS said electronic filings could 
reduce the turnaround time for a refund to four weeks, from the current wait of 
up to three months for those who file by mail. The IRS has only begun to 
experiment with electronic filing for taxpayers who owe the government money 
because of the difficulty of taxpayers making electronic payments. 
</P>
<P>
Softview has teamed up with a San Diego firm called InstaTax, which for a $30 
fee, will take the information sent by Softview's customers and have it 
electronically dispatched to the IRS. InstaTax has been transmitting tax forms 
to the IRS since last year, whether they were calculated using tax preparation 
software or just the old calculator method. 
</P>
<P>
Softview's deal with InstaTax calls for it to receive a percentage of that $30 
transaction fee. And Lane said, "Electronic filing will be a big impetus to tax 
preparation software. You have to key it in somehow." 
</P>
<P>
As an extra service for electronic tax filing, for another $70 or so, InstaTax 
will arrange an advance tax refund of up to $3,000. The advance refund is 
handled by a banking subsidiary of Sears that lends taxpayers the amount they 
expect in a refund from the IRS -- so taxpayers get the refund in about three 
days instead of about four weeks. When the IRS refund is sent out, it goes to 
the Sears subsidiary, which deducts the "refund anticipation loan" and sends 
the rest, if any, to the taxpayer. 
</P>
<P>
InstaTax, which last year transmitted about 9,000 forms to the IRS, expects to 
transmit as many as 9,000 forms each day until the April 15 tax deadline. 
</P>
<P>
But Softview isn't alone among software companies looking to capitalize on the 
electronic filing of tax forms. Softview's biggest competitor in tax software 
for home use is San Diego based ChipSoft Inc., which makes TurboTax, a program 
for IBM-compatible personal computers. Two years ago, ChipSoft began to sell 
software that allows tax accountants to reformat their tax forms for electronic 
filing by a Green Bay, Wis. company called Nelco. 
</P>
<P>
But while ChipSoft and Nelco specialize in tax preparation professionals, 
InstaTax President Donald Cook said his company is the only one in the country 
offering people who do their own taxes the opportunity to file electronically. 
</P>
<P>
In part, that is because ChipSoft is not as excited about the electronic tax 
market as Softview and InstaTax. "It's an immature industry," said Rik Barnes, 
ChipSoft's marketing director. "I think it's real hard to predict how fast it's 
going to grow." If the market grows fast though, Barnes said, ChipSoft won't 
have any problem getting a bigger share of it. 
</P>
<P>
ChipSoft already dominates the tax software market for IBM-compatible 
computers, and projected last year that it would do more than $10 million in 
sales in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
But Softview has been thriving as well and is the leading seller of tax 
software for Macintosh computers. According to MacUser magazine, Softview is 
the only maker of software that by itself allows users to do their taxes on a 
Macintosh. Other companies make software that can be used to supplement 
"spreadsheet" programs, making them work like tax preparation software. 
</P>
<P>
The InstaTax and Softview electronic tax filing works like this: Taxpayers who 
have completed their own tax forms will mail or send a facsimile of the return 
to InstaTax. Then InstaTax, using Softview software, key-punches the tax 
returns into a computer. InstaTax will ship the tax data to another firm, which 
electronically relays the information to the IRS. 
</P>
<P>
Softview owes its existence, at least in part, to a $4,000 mistake by Burroughs 
Corp. In 1984, Burroughs paid one of its programmers, Susan Morgan, about 
$4,000 more than she expected in maternity benefits. Morgan decided to use the 
money to buy a Macintosh home computer. (She eventually repaid Burroughs). 
</P>
<P>
Morgan's husband, Michael Morgan, a programmer for Northrop Corp., came up with 
the idea of Macintosh software that would display and print out realistic 
versions of IRS forms. After he had worked on the idea for a few months, he 
quit his job at Northrop and worked on the software full time. 
</P>
<P>
In the next few months, Susan Morgan made the rounds of computer clubs and 
persuaded members to invest about $80,000 in the Morgans' idea through limited 
partnerships. Meanwhile, the Morgans raised $20,000 to $30,000 from relatives. 
That was enough to produce 500 sets of the software to sell in the spring of 
1985. After several years as president, Susan Morgan brought Lane on as 
president of Softview in 1988 so she and her husband could concentrate on 
software development.

POPULATION OF LAKEWOOD IS AGING; 
</P>
<P>
DEMOGRAPHY: BUSINESS MUST ADAPT TO THE OLDER POPULATION IF THE COMMUNITY IS TO 
STAY ECONOMICALLY HEALTHY, A CITY OFFICIAL ADVISES.

<TEXT>
<P>
The city's population is aging, and business must adapt to the demographic 
change if the community is to stay economically healthy, said Chuck Ebner, the 
city's director of community development. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an older, grayer population than we've ever had and this is going to 
change the way we do business," Ebner said Thursday at the annual Economic 
Forecast breakfast held by the city and the Greater Lakewood Chamber of 
Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Four years from now, 14.5% of the city's population is expected to be 65 or 
older, according to projections from Donnelly Demographics, a marketing 
research firm that supplies census projections. In 1980, 7.6% of the 74,654 
residents were 65 or older, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time that much of the community is graying, Ebner said, the 
percentage of the population between 16 and 24 years old is shrinking. "There 
are less people for entry-level jobs in the labor force," said Ebner, one of 
four speakers at the breakfast, which drew 140 people. 
</P>
<P>
Census projections supplied by Donnelly show that the percentage of people in 
Lakewood between the ages of 15 and 19 will drop from 9.2% in 1980 to 6.2% in 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
Ebner said later that he emphasized the demographic changes because he wants 
local businesses to think about how they are going to adjust to an older market 
and a shrinking labor pool. Help-wanted signs have become permanent fixtures in 
some store windows, he said. Fast food outlets in the city, he said, are 
adjusting to the labor shortage by recruiting senior citizens as employees. 
</P>
<P>
The graying population will also put a greater demand on City Hall for such 
public services as transportation and Meals on Wheels, Ebner said. Other 
speakers expressed confidence in the city's economy. 
</P>
<P>
The sprawling Douglas Aircraft Co. plant, which straddles the Lakewood-Long 
Beach border, may add another 1,000 workers this year to its 45,000-person 
payroll, said David A. Conlon, a Douglas senior staff executive. Employment at 
the plant is the highest it has been since World War II, when 52,000 workers 
worked at the plant, Conlon said. 
</P>
<P>
The company's payroll is $28 million a week, he said. "We obviously expect that 
to continue. That's a lot of purchasing power," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The plant is producing the C-17 military transport plane and commercial 
aircraft for a domestic airline industry that is trying to replace an aging 
fleet. 
</P>
<P>
Conlon said the company remains confident that Congress will continue its 
commitment to the C-17, although Secretary of Defense Richard Cheney said last 
week that he might recommend that the government cancel some of its orders. 
Such a change would have to be approved by Congress and the President. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon initially said it wanted to buy more than 200 of the planes, 
Conlon said. The first C-17, a model expected to account for roughly 30% of 
Douglas' earnings, is expected to roll off the assembly line later this year. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas' overriding concern, Conlon said, is to stay competitive and generate 
profits in an area with high labor and production costs. The median price for a 
house in Seattle, headquarters of Boeing Co., is substantially less than in the 
Southland, Conlon said. The state tax bite here is 38% higher for individuals 
than it would be in Seattle, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"All of these things drive labor costs up, so we have to work harder to be more 
competitive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another speaker said sales at the Lakewood Shopping Center, which generates 
half of the city's sales tax revenues, increased 11% last year and are expected 
to go up again this year. 
</P>
<P>
But Mervyn's and Bullocks department stores may move more slowly on plans to 
construct new buildings at the center, said Skip Keyzers, senior vice president 
of MaceRich Co. of Santa Monica, the center's owner. The stores, which already 
are at the center, were forced to lower their prices last year to compete with 
price reductions by Federated and Allied stores, two chains that were acquired 
by Campeau Corp. The lower prices drove down profits, Keyzers said.

Chinese Students Issue 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 390 to 25, the House overrode President Bush's veto of legislation 
(HR 2712) to prevent the deportation of up to 40,000 Chinese students when 
their visas expire. But the veto held when the Senate failed to muster the 
two-thirds majority it needed to join the House in defeating the veto. 
</P>
<P>
Congress passed the bill last year after the Tian An Men Square massacre of 
pro-democracy demonstrators. The President countered with an executive order to 
achieve the same goals. Congressional critics said a law, not an order that can 
be instantly lifted, is needed to protect the students against being returned 
home to face possible persecution. 
</P>
<P>
James A. Traficant Jr. (D-Ohio) said: "Maybe our President is going to kowtow 
to a repressive Chinese government, but this Congress should not. It's time to 
put your vote where your rhetoric is." 
</P>
<P>
Minority Leader Robert H. Michel (R-Ill.) said: "President Bush knows China as 
well if not better than any member of this House . . . (and) must be given the 
room to make the foreign-policy moves he feels are in the long-range best 
interests of our country." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes wanted to override the veto.

To Delay Veto Vote 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 137 to 276, the House refused to send President Bush's veto of the 
Chinese students bill to the Foreign Affairs and Judiciary committees. The GOP 
motion sought to delay a floor vote the President appeared certain to lose. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Leach (R-Iowa), who supported the committee referral, said: "What is at 
issue today is not a question of indignation, but of judgment. How America can 
play a constructive role in moderating Chinese institutions and liberalizing 
their policies." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) said: "This is not a time to temporize, this is 
not a time to delay." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes wanted to delay a veto vote.

NEW ORLEANS' GRAVE TRADITIONS UNEARTHED;

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Red X's scrawled with lipstick, crayons and red bricks cover the Greek revival 
tomb of Marie Laveau, New Orleans' most widely known voodoo queen who died in 
1897. 
</P>
<P>
The red X's are always there. They're voodoo wishes. 
</P>
<P>
They're also only a part of the voodoo mystique -- including coins, flowers, 
candles, an unopened can of beer and a decapitated chicken -- that visitors 
leave at Laveau's last resting place, the Wishing Tomb. 
</P>
<P>
Rock singer Mike Magnette, 30, and his friend Melissa Miller, 25, both of Long 
Beach, Calif., placed a string of beads on the spot "for good luck. We came to 
New Orleans to learn more about voodoo, to visit Marie Laveau's tomb," Magnette 
said. 
</P>
<P>
New Orleans cemeteries -- filled with above-the-ground tombs -- are so 
fascinating that the National Park Service has a ranger-led daily walk through 
St. Louis Number One, the oldest cemetery in the city, established in 1789. 
</P>
<P>
Owned and operated by the Catholic church, St. Louis Number One is in the 
French Quarter, the 70-block historic area in downtown New Orleans. Although 
private property, the French Quarter is also part of the Jean Lafitte National 
Historical Park. 
</P>
<P>
Ranger Jake Garrity, 38, stood at Laveau's tomb, telling visitors the story of 
the voodoo queen. 
</P>
<P>
"It might seem odd to find a voodoo queen's grave in a Catholic cemetery, but 
in New Orleans, voodoo brought from Africa and the Caribbean was fused with 
Catholicism by many members of the church," he explained, adding, "There is 
always voodoo paraphernalia at Marie's tomb, and often unexpected surprises. 
</P>
<P>
"On three separate occasions, when I led a cemetery walk and stood before her 
tomb, a calico cat came up and rubbed against my legs. I'm not quite sure what 
that all means," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Many visitors also troop to Metairie Cemetery, the showplace of New Orleans' 
graveyard architects. Many of the city's wealthiest families are buried there. 
</P>
<P>
It's also the spot to see Josie Arlington's 1911 red granite tomb. It features 
a life-size bronze figure of a young woman holding a bouquet of roses in her 
hands and rapping at the tomb door. 
</P>
<P>
Arlington was New Orleans' most famous madam; she also designed her own tomb. 
The statue symbolizes one of her standing rules: that a virgin never be 
permitted to enter her bordello. 
</P>
<P>
The 150-acre immaculately manicured Metairie Cemetery, where several of the 
modern tombs cost $500,000 to $1 million, is laid out in an oval. That's 
because it was a race track before it became a cemetery in 1872. 
</P>
<P>
Many who played prominent roles in history are buried in Metairie Cemetery. 
Here lies William C. Claiborne, Louisiana's first governor. While in Congress, 
he cast the deciding vote for Thomas Jefferson in the deadlocked 1800 
presidential election between Jefferson and Aaron Burr. 
</P>
<P>
In its early years, New Orleans had numerous malaria, yellow fever and cholera 
epidemics, which accounted for thousands of deaths. Many parts of the city were 
once cemeteries. The Superdome sits on a former cemetery. When road 
construction occurs and new structures are built, coffins and human bones often 
are unearthed. 
</P>
<P>
Above-ground tombs originally were used because New Orleans lies below sea 
level on a former swamp. 
</P>
<P>
"Floods were common, and the dearly departed would often dearly depart 
downstream," explained ranger Garrity. "The water was so close to the surface 
that coffins and bones would pop up and flow through the city during heavy 
rains. The land has been stabilized for years, but the custom of 
above-the-ground tombs continues." 
</P>
<P>
New Orleans continues a unique cemetery tradition: unlimited burials in tombs 
and plots. Families have used the same tombs in many instances for more than 
150 years. 
</P>
<P>
"You can put as many relatives, friends or whoever you wish in a single tomb or 
single grave in New Orleans," explained Johnny Braniff, 66, sexton for the 
Firemen's Charitable &amp; Benevolent Assn.'s Greenwood Cemetery, founded in 
1852. 
</P>
<P>
"When someone dies," he said, "the oldest coffin in a tomb or grave is removed 
and destroyed. The remains of the dead person in that coffin are put in a body 
bag in a corner of the tomb or grave." 
</P>
<P>
Many tombs and graves will list all those buried at the site over the years. 
But on some tombs and graves, families often do not bother to list every name. 
"It costs money to add each name. The families know who is there. They save 
money by not inscribing all the names," Braniff said. 
</P>
<P>
At the Sbisa plot in Greenwood Cemetery, for example, there are 23 people 
listed as being buried in the one grave. The names are on a large upright 
headstone, on smaller upright headstones and on two headstones lying flat. 
</P>
<P>
There are large "society" tombs where members of organizations are buried. The 
Swiss society has a tomb, so do the Italian and Portuguese societies, the Elks 
Club and the New Orleans Typographical Union, and many more. 
</P>
<P>
Many people visit the cemeteries to marvel at the sculptures. One cemetery has 
a life-size statue of a man holding a copy of his marriage license. His widow 
had the statue created to let everyone know that, despite gossip to the 
contrary, they had indeed been lawfully married. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress Grove and Greenwood cemeteries are owned and operated by 340 
descendants of the volunteer firemen who organized the Firemen's Charitable 
&amp; Benevolent Assn. in 1834 and later started the cemeteries. John C. Freese 
Jr., 44, secretary-treasurer, is the great-grandson of a volunteer fireman. 
There haven't been volunteer firemen in New Orleans for years. 
</P>
<P>
There are a number of other cemeteries run by organizations in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Tailgate funeral processions following Dixieland jazz bands are another New 
Orleans cemetery tradition. 
</P>
<P>
But that's another story.

<P>
The 16-acre wasteland in the heart of Anaheim's downtown had become something 
of an embarrassment for civic leaders. The dusty vacant lots beckoned 
developers, yet more than a decade passed without solid prospects for a renewal 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Now comes Koll Co. 
</P>
<P>
After scrutinizing the property for years, the Newport Beach-based development 
firm interested Pacific Bell in a new office tower on the Anaheim site. Koll 
announced last month that it hopes to construct a $200-million complex 
including a hotel, movie theater and other office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to wait for the right pieces to fall into place," explained Richard 
Ortwein, president of Koll's Southern California division. "It was a win for 
everyone." 
</P>
<P>
Such successes appear to be coming easily these days for Koll. Despite a 
downturn in the real estate business, Koll continues to develop, build and 
lease its buildings at a breakneck pace. 
</P>
<P>
"Their growth has been nothing short of phenomenal," said Jim Kruse, senior 
vice president for Schneider Commercial Real Estate in Anaheim. "They are a 
top-drawer developer." 
</P>
<P>
The company founded by Orange County contractor Donald M. Koll has emerged as 
one of the largest commercial developers in the nation. The company's 
construction subsidiary alone is ranked 16th nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Much of its success is tied to its strategy of putting the entire development 
process -- site acquisition, construction and leasing -- under one roof. 
</P>
<P>
Another reason is that firm's prosperity was built from other people's money. 
Instead of obtaining bank loans for projects, Koll finds pension funds, 
insurance companies or other entities to kick in the cash for a deal. Koll 
contributes the company's building and development expertise. 
</P>
<P>
When the building is completed and occupied, the joint venture partner 
generally gets paid back first. Then Koll Co. and the partner split the 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
The joint venture arrangement allows Koll to become involved in larger projects 
than would normally be possible through bank borrowing. And unlike a bank, 
well-financed joint venture partners do not demand a mortgage payment every 
month, so they can be more patient during periodic real estate market 
downturns. 
</P>
<P>
The credit for these strategies generally goes to Koll, a low-key, dapper man 
in his 50s with a Donald Trump-like love of deal making. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Trump, however, Koll disdains the limelight. Two years ago, after Forbes 
magazine listed him as one of the 400 richest people in America, he called up 
the magazine's editors and convinced them he really wasn't so wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
"Make the company the story. I'm just a team player," Koll implored a reporter 
during an interview for this article. 
</P>
<P>
The Newport Beach developer is tackling projects as diverse -- and potentially 
risky -- as a shopping center in economically depressed Texas and beach resorts 
in Baja California. Swank office buildings are still being built at the 
$1-billion Koll Center Irvine, the company's largest project. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, Koll Co. is building an office tower on the site of the old 
Church of the Open Door that became known for its "Jesus Saves" neon sign. 
</P>
<P>
Besides construction and development, Koll Co. is moving into the land 
business. Clinching the biggest deal in its 28-year history, the company 
announced plans last month to buy parcels in 19 states from Union Pacific Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Union Pacific's decision to unload 15,000 acres and 30 buildings to Koll for 
$532 million was viewed by analysts as a positive step toward consolidating the 
many diverse operations of the railroad-dominated company. 
</P>
<P>
The transaction easily topped Koll's previous biggest deal: the $300-million 
acquisition last July of industrial and office properties from Wells Fargo 
Mortgage &amp; Equity Trust. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the massiveness of Koll Co.'s recent undertakings, the firm's record 
has proven so reliable that few industry observers question its ability to 
manage so many different projects. 
</P>
<P>
"The most interesting thing that sets (Koll) apart from the rest of the pack is 
his uncanny ability to get through difficult times with a minimum of effort," 
said Bill Russell, senior vice president for Aetna Realty Investors Inc. in 
Hartford, a longtime Koll joint venture partner. "You hear about the big boys 
gasping for air. Koll gets through." 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Koll was the envy of Orange County developers in 1986 when a new 
11-story tower at its Irvine complex was 90% leased, while competitors were 
struggling to lease half of their new buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"The good buildings rent even in the bad times," Koll said. 
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, Koll Co. has doubled the amount of building space under 
its wing to 38.2 million square feet. The value of its property holdings has 
doubled to $4.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the tough market for new buildings, Koll has leased nearly 80% of one 
new high-rise in Koll Center Irvine and more than half of a second tower, said 
Ray Wirta, president of Koll's leasing and property management. 
</P>
<P>
The Koll Construction Co. subsidiary has doubled its volume over the same 
five-year period to an estimated $725 million in 1990. Now it has set a goal of 
$1 billion within five years, which its managers say they hope to achieve by 
courting more business outside of Koll Co. 
</P>
<P>
Koll could have hardly ever dreamed of such a company back when he first 
arrived in Orange County in the late 1950s after a stint as an Air Force pilot. 
He worked in a cousin's house-building business for a while, then started his 
company as a general contractor in 1962. Soon, he hit upon the idea of small, 
multi-tenant industrial buildings set in landscaped, campus-like settings. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew there was a market for a little guy," he explained. One of Koll's first 
moves was getting himself known to Orange County's "big guy," Irvine Co., which 
sat on the lion's share of developable land. 
</P>
<P>
"The dress in this town used to be Topsiders and blue denim and Hawaiian 
shirts, believe it or not. Even the bankers wore that," Koll said. "And all of 
a sudden the Irvine Co. brought all these guys in three-piece suits and black 
shoes . . . and the locals were frankly scared. "I said to myself, 'I don't 
know anybody. Maybe I ought to work with these guys.' " 
</P>
<P>
It was Irvine Co. that sold Koll 100 acres in the shadow of John Wayne Airport, 
where he built the Airport Business Park, his firm's first big development 
success. 
</P>
<P>
In 1972, the company obtained another 125 acres on the east side of the airport 
for construction of Koll Center Newport. The project marked the realization of 
a prediction that Koll has reportedly voiced long before: that MacArthur 
Boulevard would become the Wilshire Boulevard of Orange County. The story stuck 
around largely because no one at the time believed the builder-turned-prophet. 
</P>
<P>
"I had difficulty sharing the vision," acknowledges Tim Strader, an early Koll 
partner who went on to form his own real estate development concern. 
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, the boulevard running from the San Diego Freeway past John Wayne 
Airport has become a thicket of mid-rise office buildings and hotels cloaked by 
parking lots and trees. If it lacked the glitter and urban grit of L.A.'s 
Wilshire District, it was a reasonable Orange County approximation. 
</P>
<P>
Koll downplays his role as a prognosticator. It was a simple matter of 
deduction, he said. Irvine Co. had planned for the business hub of the area to 
be closer to the beach, but a planned freeway to the site never was built. That 
left the airport area, which was close to the San Diego Freeway and a natural 
for office development, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Koll Center Newport was a hit with investors. 
</P>
<P>
"Koll Center Newport is one of the original developments in what now looks like 
one of the great meccas of California real estate. . . . It's been an 
enormously successful project," said Aetna's Russell. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, Koll's company was expanding. He did not just hire his top 
executives, he took them on as partners. With a slice of the profits, he made 
many of them wealthy. Some are now retired; others started their own companies, 
often in the image of Koll Co. 
</P>
<P>
"It was fun and it was tiring. It was absolutely exhilarating," said Strader, a 
Koll Co. partner and legal counsel from 1972 to 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Koll has prospered, but don't try to ask him just how much. 
</P>
<P>
A buddy of billionaire Irvine Co. owner Donald L. Bren, Koll was listed by 
Forbes Magazine in 1987 as being worth an estimated $300 million, placing him 
277th on the list of the 400 richest people in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
By 1988, when Koll Co. reported the value of its holdings had risen by $600 
million over the previous year, Koll disappeared from the Forbes list. He said 
he talked to the list's compilers in New York and tried to explain that he is 
not as rich as he might appear. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked to the guy the next year (1988). I said, 'Look, if you buy a house 
for $100,000, does that mean you are worth $100,000?' I own a smaller share of 
it," Koll said. 
</P>
<P>
Koll, in fact, seems to drip with modesty. "We should put all these guys' names 
on the door instead of mine. I just happened to have been the first one here," 
he said. But others, both inside and outside the company, describe Koll as "a 
legitimate Wunderkind" with "an uncanny ability to read markets," as real 
estate executive Kruse puts it. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Koll Co. remains very much a decentralized organization. Its branch 
development offices are run as largely independent operations. Koll said it is 
in keeping with his belief that real estate must be conducted at the local 
level by representatives who know the area. 
</P>
<P>
Since Koll owns his own construction company, it is easier for the development 
staff to work with the builders. "It is a tremendous advantage to be able to 
walk three doors down and talk to the guys who are going to build your 
building," said Rick Stephens, president of Koll's Los Angeles division. 
</P>
<P>
Koll points to the development, construction and leasing combination in his 
company as one of its strongest assets. 
</P>
<P>
"You control it all," Koll said. "You control the cost of construction and we 
control the cost of property management, and we actively manage our properties 
instead of just collecting the rent and hoping somebody's going to be there." 
</P>
<P>
The construction end of Koll Co. has become increasingly important as the real 
estate market has tightened. While Koll said development activity is off by 
about 25%, the company has the construction company as an added buffer against 
bad times. 
</P>
<P>
Having already tackled tasks ranging from constructing 35-story office 
buildings to the reproduction of Independence Hall at Knott's Berry Farm, the 
firm wants to expand its market by building hospitals and other health-care 
buildings, said Vic Laidlaw, senior vice president of Koll Construction. 
</P>
<P>
The development arm, too, is headed in new directions. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, the company is trying to develop more medium-sized shopping 
centers built around one or more low-overhead, high-volume discount centers, 
such as a K mart or a Circuit City Superstore, Koll said. Called "power 
centers," they are planned or under development by Koll in Rancho Santa 
Margarita, San Jose, Ft. Worth, Tex., and Bellingham, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
Koll Co. has also undertaken downtown redevelopment projects, such as the 
recently announced Anaheim project, which is already winning kudos from the 
city planning staff. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Koll is one of the best developers we've worked with," said Anaheim 
Community Development Director Elisa Stipkovitch. "They don't have an overly 
burdensome decision-making process. They try to make everyone a winner in the 
deal and that's positive." 
</P>
<P>
Besides making inroads as far east as Texas, Koll Co. is also looking south of 
the border to Mexico. Already, the firm has built what it hopes will become a 
successful industrial park for companies doing business in the United States 
that want to take advantage of plentiful -- and low-cost -- Mexican labor. 
</P>
<P>
In Cabo San Lucas in southern Baja California, Koll has plans to develop the 
Hotel Palmilla into a world-class resort with 200 rooms and two championship 
golf courses. He also has another 3,000 hotel rooms in mind for another resort 
on 2,000 acres of ocean-front property. 
</P>
<P>
"I just like Mexico a lot," Koll said. "I've been flying down there for years 
and I like the place and it seems so logical to have a resort there." 
</P>
<P>
While he continues to branch out, Koll said there are limits. He said he plans 
to continue to follow the market, switching the company's strategies to fit. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to be the biggest company in the world. We don't want to be 
nationwide. We just want to provide quality work," he said.

NOMINEE ARABIAN CALLED IN THE MOLD OF GOVERNOR'S CHOICES 
</P>

<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian's newest nominee to the state Supreme Court is a 
pragmatic, moderately conservative but sometimes unpredictable judge who seems 
much in the mold of the governor's previous appointees, legal analysts said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
State Appeal Court Justice Armand Arabian, 55, of Los Angeles could provide key 
votes in close cases -- as did the man he is succeeding, Justice Marcus M. 
Kaufman, some experts said. 
</P>
<P>
The governor formally named Arabian as his choice for the $115,161-a-year job 
on Saturday. Kaufman, who officially left the court on Wednesday, proved to be 
a judicial maverick who sometimes parted company with the four other Deukmejian 
appointees on the court and joined the court's liberal minority in some key 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
"Arabian has a real streak of chutzpah," said Santa Clara University law dean 
Gerald F. Uelmen, a close observer of the court. "I think he may display an 
independent streak that might make him a good replacement for Kaufman." 
</P>
<P>
Ellis J. Horvitz, an Encino attorney who appears often in civil cases before 
the court, described the new nominee as a judicial moderate and pragmatist -- 
and a potential court maverick, like Kaufman. "Nobody will ever doubt where 
Arabian stands," the lawyer said. "He's very up front." 
</P>
<P>
"The court now is not made up of ideologues or academicians, but justices who 
want to know how their decision will affect people -- they're concerned with 
practical effects," Horvitz said. "Arabian will fit right into that." 
</P>
<P>
Another court authority, UC Berkeley law professor Stephen R. Barnett, 
expressed doubt that Arabian would fill Kaufman's shoes as a frequent and 
sometimes outspoken dissenter. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a solid, workmanlike and conservative judge who respects constitutional 
rights, but he is unlikely to bring much balance or diversity to the views of 
the court," Barnett said. "But he seems to be more predictably conservative 
than Kaufman." 
</P>
<P>
A review of some of the highlights of Arabian's 18-year career on the bench 
reveals a mixture of judicial results. In criminal cases, for example, there is 
no evidence that he is heavily inclined toward either the prosecution or 
defense. Arabian served both as a prosecutor and defense lawyer earlier in his 
career, and as a judge he has proved tough on criminal defendants but also has 
reversed convictions when a significant procedural error has occurred. 
</P>
<P>
In civil cases, a recent study by Fred J. Hiestand, counsel to the Assn. for 
California Tort Reform, showed that Arabian often has ruled to protect 
defendants from damage awards, but the study also revealed instances where he 
has upheld the claims of plaintiffs. For example, in one instance, he ruled for 
a widow who sought more than $300,000 in damages from a group of investors for 
failing to provide her with proper advice. 
</P>
<P>
Whether issuing an opinion for the majority or raising a dissent, Arabian has 
sometimes exhibited a colorful writing style. 
</P>
<P>
In limiting an award to a waitress for sexual harassment by an employer, 
Arabian held that under the law, the state Fair Employment and Housing 
Commission was no more entitled to order compensatory and punitive damages than 
it "could order sterilization, castration or lobotomy." 
</P>
<P>
When the majority ruled that a convenience store could be sued by a customer 
who was assaulted by thugs after he had left the premises, Arabian vigorously 
objected. It was improper, he said in a dissent, to cite as evidence of the 
store's liability the fact that previously it had occasionally summoned police 
to protect customers. 
</P>
<P>
"A caring society is ennobled and enriched when citizen observers sound the 
alarm which seeks a protective response," he wrote. "The majority view has the 
practical effect of discouraging activities which benefit the victims amongst 
us. Do they seek to sanction the deafening silence which responded to the cry 
of Kitty Genovese?" 
</P>
<P>
In other notable Court of Appeal cases, Arabian has: 
</P>
<P>
* Refused to allow a candidate for public office to sue the Los Angeles County 
Bar Assn. for libel for saying he was unfit for the job; the Bar was entitled 
to its opinion, and the candidate had made himself a public figure open to such 
criticism, he said. 
</P>
<P>
* Affirmed the right of non-Christians to place advertisements in a publication 
called the Christian Yellow Pages. 
</P>
<P>
* Refused to exclude evidence from a surreptitiously recorded conversation 
between a 17-year-old murder suspect and his mother in which the boy admitted, 
"we did it, but I didn't pull the trigger." Arabian held there was no 
reasonable expectation of privacy in such conversations, adding, "indeed, in 
the jail house the age-old truism still pertains: 'walls have ears.' " 
</P>
<P>
* Ruled unconstitutional a state law that limited personal injury awards to 
uninsured motorists, finding that the statute violated the right to due 
process. 
</P>
<P>
* Upheld a state law aimed at preserving the matrimonial family and refused to 
grant an unmarried man visitation rights to a young girl he claimed was his 
daughter. The law presumes the co-habitating husband of the mother is the 
father, and although the unmarried man submitted a blood test indicating that 
he probably was the father, he was not entitled to visitation rights, the court 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Arabian has had wide experience on the bench -- a characteristic common of the 
seven appointees Deukmejian has made to the high court since he became governor 
in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing the appointment on his weekly radio address, the governor said: 
"During his tenure on the municipal, superior and appellate courts, he has 
earned a reputation for well-reasoned legal opinions, intellectual honesty, 
open-mindedness and a great ability to analyze tough legal problems." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian also took note of the nominee's sense of humor -- a quality cited by 
others who have known Arabian. One lawyer told how he has sometimes mis-dialed 
the Court of Appeal clerk's office and reached Arabian by mistake. The first 
time, Arabian quickly corrected him but in subsequent incidents the justice has 
playfully deceived the lawyer into a longer conversation, and, when the joke 
had played out, revealed his identity and told the attorney, "You've done it 
again!" 
</P>
<P>
Arabian, believed to be the first person of Armenian heritage named to the 
state high court, grew up in an Armenian community in New York and later, after 
moving to California, continued to display a vigorous interest in Armenian 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Los Angeles Daily Journal legal newspaper in 1983, 
Arabian remarked: "Being a member of an oppressed minority has sensitized me to 
certain positions in society. My family was a victim of Turkish oppression. My 
grandfather was shot by a firing squad. My family was put on a death march. 
They struggled to these golden shores in America." 
</P>
<P>
He also has been a longtime friend and supporter of Deukmejian -- and his name 
has been mentioned repeatedly in recent years when vacancies have arisen on the 
court. 
</P>
<P>
But authorities on Saturday discounted the suggestion that cronyism led to the 
nomination. "The appointment is fully justified on the merits of experience and 
ability," said attorney Horvitz. "If the governor wants to appoint an old 
friend who is also a first-rate jurist, more power to him." Added Uelmen: 
"There is no suggestion he is any less qualified than anyone else in the field 
from which he was selected. 
</P>
<P>
As a trial judge, Arabian won wide attention when in 1973 he refused to give 
jurors a then-required instruction to view a rape victim's testimony with 
caution. Two years later, the state Supreme Court struck down the instruction. 
</P>
<P>
Arabian wrote several legal articles on the subject that were used in attempts 
to overturn similar instructions in other states. He also worked closely with 
then-state Sen. Deukmejian and other legislators for mandatory prison sentences 
for rapists. 
</P>
<P>
In another case as a trial judge, Arabian once moved the entire court -- 
including the jury, lawyers and defendant -- to the small home of an 
83-year-old burglary victim who was unable to come to the courthouse to 
testify. 
</P>
<P>
Arabian's name also made the headlines in 1979 when then-Lt. Gov. Mike Curb 
sought to appoint him to the Court of Appeal while Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown 
Jr. was traveling out of state. When Brown returned, he rescinded the 
appointment. 
</P>
<P>
Later, the state Supreme Court held that while Curb did hold appointive power 
while Brown was out of state, Brown also had authority to pull back the 
nomination when he returned.

RAP-THE POWER AND THE CONTROVERSY; 
</P>
<P>
CHUCK D. -- THE INTERVIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chuck D. was interviewed by pop music critic Robert Hilburn in a New York 
recording studio as Public Enemy finished work on its third album, "Fear of a 
Black Planet." Rap's most acclaimed and controversial figure speaks candidly 
about the uproar surrounding his group, his music, his personal politics and 
the role of rap music in America. 
</P>
<P>
Hilburn: How fairly do you think you have been portrayed in the media -- the 
accusations of anti-Semitism in the band and so forth? 
</P>
<P>
Chuck D.: Everybody's not here to like you. . . . I think the key to being a 
wise black man in this hemisphere is in knowing that what you do is going to 
turn some people off because your perspective is different from others. You've 
got to (tell yourself), "No matter what I do, they're not going to see it from 
my eyes." 
</P>
<P>
Let's look at your perspective. What first got you interested in music? Who 
were your heroes as a kid? 
</P>
<P>
My heroes and role models came from sports. . . . Basketball . . . baseball . . 
. football. . . . People like Hank Aaron, Willie Mays, Willis Reed, Gale Sayers 
. . . a lot of black heroes. 
</P>
<P>
But my main man was Muhammad Ali. He was one of the first black men to come 
along and speak his mind. He'd go like, "Yo, not only did I whip this kid's ass 
(in the ring), but I'm smart. I look good. You can't push me around." Some 
people didn't like the fact that after he won, he thanked God and his religion. 
It was something they didn't understand. 
</P>
<P>
I think that a lot of people in America are really happy that Muhammad Ali is 
in the condition that he is in (Ali has been diagnosed as having Parkinson's 
syndrome) because back when he was in top-notch condition, yelling and stuff, 
(a lot of white people) didn't like him. They'd say, "I wish he would shut up." 
Reggie Jackson was another articulate brother who not only would beat you on 
the field, but he would (speak up in interviews) and say, "Yo, this is the way 
I did it." 
</P>
<P>
Did watching them inspire you -- and tell you about the dangers of being 
outspoken? 
</P>
<P>
Sure, it showed what happens when you rock the boat, but I think that if we sit 
still in the boat, we ain't going to get nowhere. The thing I saw in these 
sports heroes was that they were men. My father was my number one hero because 
he was a man, too. That's why all this that comes down today (around Public 
Enemy) doesn't bother me because I'm a man. Respect me as a man and I'll 
respect you. 
</P>
<P>
There's a lot of social commentary in your music. When did you start thinking 
about the world in those terms? 
</P>
<P>
My mom was active in lots of community-oriented things (on Long Island), and 
she put me into these special summer school (programs) when I was around 11 or 
12 and they taught us a lot about black history. In the beginning, it was fun 
because we were getting free sandwiches and apples and going to the pool, but 
we learned all kinds of other things that were helpful to me later . . . about 
the black community pulling together. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Rappers can do a lot of good because we have control of the media and that's 
why we're not liked because never before has the black man or so many black 
males spoken their opinion on so many things. 
</P>
<P>
Before (the message to blacks was), "You can do all kinds of crazy (expletive) 
on the basketball court, on the baseball field, then you can be a white boy's 
hero." 
</P>
<P>
Today, the problem is that people like Ice Cube or BDP are white boy's heroes, 
but they aren't just dealing from a physical thing, but a mental thing. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the problems your group went through last year, did you identify 
with the controversy involving N.W.A and the FBI's attack on their music? 
</P>
<P>
I understood what they were going through because it was the same thing most 
black people go through. If you have a (door) to the media and people don't 
understand what you are saying, people are going to come at you in all 
directions . . . and all (we both were doing) was addressing what is going on 
in our minds, what we see . . . asking questions. 
</P>
<P>
What were your goals in the first album? 
</P>
<P>
I tried to relate, "This is how we are thinking and how we are living on the 
block." If someone wants to know what the problem is with black America today, 
they'll go to some kind of social analyst who is making about $100,000 a year, 
living in a certain neighborhood and he's going to try to come from a point of, 
"This is what I see is wrong with the black situation." 
</P>
<P>
What were you saying in the lyrics on the first album? 
</P>
<P>
I was tackling issues, things I thought needed explaining. I remember back at 
that time, the media threw a lot of (expletive) at Run-DMC for the gang 
violence at the Long Beach concert. They blamed rap for violence and I thought 
that's crazy. How in the hell can they blame a music for violence when this is 
a situation that was festering in that area for years? It's a social situation. 
It ain't got nothing to do with rap. . . . 
</P>
<P>
That's when I decided to get involved in this and go head on head and toe to 
toe with the media because the media took a smack at rap music and Run-DMC 
because they didn't understand what was really going on in black life. 
</P>
<P>
So, I decided to play a little game on the media. I set traps for them. When I 
wrote, "My Uzi Weighs a Ton," I wanted to see people come out and say, "Damn, 
he's talking about Uzis" and start thinking about people walking around with 
real Uzis -- and they did it. Lots of people thought it was irresponsible, us 
talking about arming blacks and marching around with Uzis. 
</P>
<P>
Isn't there danger in that? Shouldn't you try to say things that people 
understand, rather than say things that confuse them? 
</P>
<P>
No, because I might say things that the media understands or the average white 
man understands, but then I might not be communicating with the black audience, 
which is my main audience. 
</P>
<P>
When people started asking about Uzis, did you feel you were able to explain 
your feelings? 
</P>
<P>
I know the message got out to my audience. There might have been a few brothers 
who thought, "Hell, yes" and liked the idea of carrying a gun, but I know that 
85 to 90% felt, "Yo, we know what he's saying." I know people keep saying, "Why 
don't you be perfectly clear?" Well, that's not rap because black society isn't 
perfectly clear to the white world. If you are speaking primarily to the black 
community, you are going to always run into problems with the white world. 
</P>
<P>
Why the military outfits on stage and the imitation Uzis? 
</P>
<P>
The idea came partly from the Black Panthers, which remains such a strong image 
in the black community. You've got to understand, the Black Panthers were 
looked upon as terrorists by the white community, but much of the black 
community looked upon them as heroes. 
</P>
<P>
The guns on stage symbolize why black people are in the situation they are in 
today. . . . the Europeans had the guns and took us out of Africa and sent us 
to America. The guns are us saying, "OK, never again is our culture going to be 
snatched away from us the way it was before." 
</P>
<P>
What about the second album? Which themes were most important to you in "It 
Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back"? 
</P>
<P>
That album was addressed right at the black community, the need to get our 
(expletive) together, to network, because no one is going to do it for us. The 
next album, which is "Fear of a Black Planet," is going to talk about what 
Caucasians believe about themselves. 
</P>
<P>
For me, I don't believe in black and white. There is no such thing. I believe 
that the original black man from Africa was the original seed and everything 
sprouted from there. If you want to look into genetics, the black man is able 
to reproduce everything on the color wheel . . . blond hair, blue eyes, light 
skin. 
</P>
<P>
The only reason people talk about separation is because the white world 
supremacists keep saying the white race is pure and that anything that mixes 
with it contaminates it. It's rooted in a lot of religions today and even in 
the law. If you decide to be with a black woman, your child is black. 
</P>
<P>
That second album was also information for the white audience to check out. The 
idea wasn't to exclude the white audience, but the title shows who it was 
addressed to. . . . The thinking: Our strength is in ourselves. The challenge 
is working against the people who want to hold us back. 
</P>
<P>
How did you feel when it was hailed by critics? 
</P>
<P>
For a lot of "white" people to say, "Damn, I've learned something about the 
black perspective," it was gratifying. I'm hu-man, I feel good when someone 
says, "Great job." 
</P>
<P>
But you must realize some people just respond to the music, not the themes. Is 
that enough for you? 
</P>
<P>
I think music should be regarded No. 1 as communication. That's what all us 
rappers are -- communicators. That's why a lot of people react so strongly 
against us. 
</P>
<P>
But pop music and soul music have a history of artists who have stressed 
socially conscious themes. What about Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, Curtis 
Mayfield? 
</P>
<P>
But all that was just singing. It's not as direct. With rap, there is no way to 
miss the point of the song. 
</P>
<P>
What about the Griff situation and the Washington Times interview? 
</P>
<P>
I felt something was going to come down. I think Griff was disillusioned about 
a lot of things going on with his position (in the group). In the interview, he 
was trying to deal with this guy, talking about capitalistic exploitation of 
black people in South Africa and the involvement of different governments and 
he didn't have his facts down to a T. He was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
But why not remove Griff and just do away with the whole racism and 
anti-Semitic image, which is going to detract from the positive message that 
you feel is in your music? 
</P>
<P>
Because, you don't remove it as an issue by getting rid of Griff. You might 
remove it as an issue with you or with the Jewish constituency or the white 
public, but I told you I am mainly talking to my community, the black 
community, and they look at us a some kind of a hero. 
</P>
<P>
So when you fire Griff, they go, "Yo, you gave in to the white boy. . . . 
You're no different than everybody else. What kind of a leader are you?" The 
important thing to me was to make it clear that I thought what Griff said was 
wrong, but to also show that we can forgive. Griff was called for traveling, so 
he had to be penalized, but that doesn't mean he had to be cut off the team. 
</P>
<P>
So, how do you comment on what Griff said? What do you say when someone asks if 
you're racist or anti-Semitic? 
</P>
<P>
"NBC Nightly News" asked me that the other night and they wanted to see me 
sweat, but I don't feel any guilt. I'm not racist. I'm not anti-Semitic. I 
think it is a waste of time being anti-anything. 
</P>
<P>
But I also won't let this (controversy) keep me, as a black nationalist, from 
talking about problems of the black people and asking questions about how these 
problems came about. What is happening now is that people are looking at the 
Griff comments and reading racism or anti-Semitic thoughts in everything we do, 
like the "Terrordome" single. 
</P>
<P>
I'm not a racist, but I am inquisitive and I hope that when I keep asking 
questions, people don't respond to them by saying it's a racist question 
because there is no such thing as a racist question. There are only racist 
answers. 
</P>
<P>
What does it mean to you to be a black nationalist? 
</P>
<P>
Black nationalist means that since we are viewed upon as a separate 
constituency that is judged by our characteristics instead of our character, it 
means we have to network among each other. 
</P>
<P>
If we were able to say, "Hey, I'm black and I'm American, but an American 
first," white people are not going to see us that way. They see us first as 
black and then deal with us from there. In view of that, we have to network 
with other black people for our own protection and self interest. 
</P>
<P>
Is your dream an equal society? 
</P>
<P>
That'll happen once whites have a better understanding of blacks. Now you have 
a problem of white people running away, like we are aliens or something. 
</P>
<P>
Are you calling for separatism? 
</P>
<P>
I'm looking for separate development so that we can get to the level of the 
rest of society. We've got to create our own businesses and future so that we 
don't always have to be in the position of going to the white man for a job. 
</P>
<P>
What was the message of "Terrordome'? 
</P>
<P>
It was my perspective on what happened in 1989 in black America and also what 
happened to Public Enemy. 
</P>
<P>
The most controversial line in the song is the reference to crucifixion. Didn't 
you realize that you would rekindle the whole anti-Semitic controversy and also 
get accused of taking yourself too seriously by comparing what you went through 
to Christ? 
</P>
<P>
I'm an artist and that's my imagery. You can't let your artistry be intimidated 
by the fear that people are going to misinterpret you. To me, there's a bit of 
paranoia going on here. I was talking about a media crucifixion. 
</P>
<P>
In light of the attack on the record, would you have taken the crucifixion 
lines out of the record if you were making it again today? 
</P>
<P>
Hell no. There's nothing offensive in that record at all. But the media keeps 
asking me about the Jewish community, hoping I'll say something that gives them 
another good story. But how can I blame the Jewish community? There are certain 
factions in the community that are looking out for the best interests of the 
whole community. They are doing what they are supposed to do. 
</P>
<P>
If black people were to get hostile at implications and assumptions, hell man, 
white people would be on the edge every second. 
</P>
<P>
What's the new album's message? Is it going to make white people edgy? 
</P>
<P>
The thing I'm asking is, "Why do whites run from blacks?" I call it the Jackass 
Theory: Just acting Caucasian kills a simple solution. As long as white people 
believe they are white and pure, they will treat us as something different. My 
great-grandfather is white, but I'm black and what difference does it make? But 
in white eyes it means my great-grandfather and his kids were contaminated so 
they was basically knocked out of the game. 
</P>
<P>
The day that white people stop acting white and start acting more human, in the 
sense that we are all in this (expletive) together, we will come to some point 
where everybody will get a piece of the pie. 
</P>
<P>
Did you get any pressure from CBS Records about the lines in "Terrordome?" 
</P>
<P>
They try to give me pressure, but I say, "You don't like me, you cut me off and 
I'm out of here tomorrow. My next album will go bootleg gold." But they don't 
want to cut off a million-plus sales. 
</P>
<P>
CBS understands what I'm doing. If I went to the company and said, "White 
people need to die tomorrow, Jews are (messing in our affairs)" . . . if I had 
a twisted mentality like that, I would expect CBS to react differently. 
</P>
<P>
I know they are under pressure from some groups, but the only thing they can 
point to about the anti-Semitism issue is the Griff interview and their 
interpretation of four lines in a song. I have explained those lines, but still 
some people refuse to accept it. 
</P>
<P>
Do you get strength from the black community? 
</P>
<P>
I'm very proud of what I get from the black community because I think once I 
told people, "Don't believe the hype no matter how much news the white media 
throws at 'em," the kids know not to believe that bull. The point of "Fear of a 
Black Planet" is like, hey, we are all in this together. My great-grandfather 
was white. It wasn't like his kids died. His kids were just considered black. 
The so-called white male wants to see the image of himself. If he doesn't see 
the image of himself, he thinks, "Oh man, my family tree is poisoned." 
</P>
<P>
The racist view of white people in the Western world is the same Aryan 
principle, where Aryan people used to check the bloodline. If you had any kind 
of Jewish infiltration in your blood, you weren't pure. Black people didn't 
have anything to do with that. But people seem to want to blame black people 
for some (things) that white people did in Germany and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
My No. 1 question in "Fear of a Black Planet": Is white America ready to deal 
with the rise of black male intellectualism and black male capitalism? Because 
once a brother gets into hustling, they are going to win. Once a brother gets 
into anything, because it's that extra drive we've got because we get beat down 
in so many areas. 
</P>
<P>
Did you think there was a time when you thought you might not be able to battle 
back? 
</P>
<P>
I understand it's all an intellectual game (dealing with the media and 
criticism). . . . The minute you wilt intellectually, you lose. You can't get 
intimidated. You've got to fight for what you believe in as long as you're 
right.
