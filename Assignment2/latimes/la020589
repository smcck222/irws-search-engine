Listen to the changing consciousness of a culture: It is the 1940s. We are in 
the home of a family of physicians, light-skinned African-Americans in Detroit. 
Lilly, the visiting granddaughter of the family has discovered "while 
eavesdropping on their housekeeper, Dorothy, and her friends that they were 
colored. The 'Wednesday girls,' as the maids were called, were playing cards 
and preparing food in Dorothy's carriage house. Lilly overheard one of them 
refer to the doctors as 'hankdie niggers.' Lilly asked her grandmother what a 
'hankdie nigger' was. 
</P>
<P>
" 'That's a Negro who thinks he's above other Negroes.' 
</P>
<P>
" 'Are you a Negro?' she asked, sounding as innocent as baby Jesus. Her cousin, 
Amir, had put her into colored-consciousness training an hour after they'd met. 
Dorothy, who was black, was almost a pure Negro. Amir didn't know that Dorothy 
was as much Seminole-Creek-Choctaw as she was African. As a child in the South, 
Dorothy had learned not to talk about her Indian heritage. Possessing that 
blood made you a 'hankdie nigger' too." 
</P>
<P>
This passage, from Nettie Jones' slim new novel, "Mischief Makers" -- a 
sensuous, often poetic compression of America's history of color and class 
conflict and racial amalgamation -- suggests a broadening ethnic consciousness 
among black writers, a willingness to acknowledge and affirm their complex 
ethnic and racial heritage in America. 
</P>
<P>
The story begins with a cliche character: Raphael de Baptiste, young, beautiful 
with but a "chocolate drop" of Negro blood in her veins. This passing beauty 
leaves her comfortable Detroit home, her physician father and her black lover 
in the 1920s to become a "white" nurse in northern Michigan. There, she meets 
and falls in love with Mishe Masaube, a Chippewa Indian, with whom she has 
three daughters (of whom Lilly is one). 
</P>
<P>
Raphael and Mishe are, in a word, hot. The sexual heat is portrayed with a 
straightforward earthiness that also teeters close to "Me Tarzan. You Jane," 
dialogue, punctuated with lines like: "Following her wishes he stroked her 
until she knew, he knew, that he'd seeded her." (Really, Ms. Jones.) 
</P>
<P>
More often, the book has the sound of music: razor-sharp riffs, and measures of 
words -- very short measures -- that call to mind the sonorous wail of the 
blues from a tenor saxophone. 
</P>
<P>
Mishe speaks when he and Raphael first meet: 
</P>
<P>
" 'Been out in the woods yet with a man?' A tiny smile rested at the corner of 
his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Never!' She got into this game with him. 'Never. Except for with my father. 
He loves trees and birds.' 
</P>
<P>
" 'Would you? With an Indian?' 
</P>
<P>
" 'Before I would anyone else. That's for sure. Long as you promise me that 
berries or flowers are all we're gonna hunt.' She felt naughty. Her eyes 
fastened upon his belt, thick and black. The buckle was bone." 
</P>
<P>
Mishe proves to be as passionate a father as he is a husband. The portrayal of 
this Chippewa man's sacred connection to nature and the spiritual bonding with 
his children are among the most beautiful in the book. They converge in this 
passage about the birth of the couple's first child: 
</P>
<P>
"All her life this child was called by both her names as if one were 
inseparable from the other, as if they were one sound: Blossom Rose. Never 
Blossom. Never Rose. 
</P>
<P>
"The first mother she knew was Mother Earth. Mishe had taken her out of (the 
attendant's) arms the moment she was cleaned and bundled, and run outside with 
her. No one made any attempt to stop him as he held her up to the glow of the 
moonlight. She herself did not make a sound. (The doctor) watched as Mishe lay 
her down for a moment on the muddy earth. The little dance that he performed as 
he brought her back into the house amused no one, for it was not a dance of 
amusement. It was joyful. Mishe's eyes blazed as he reentered the bedroom with 
the now muddy bundle. He ripped the blanket off, exposing his naked baby. 
Slowing down, he placed her onto his wife's tit. As he watched, he himself 
undressed, got into bed with them. (The doctor) felt that if Mishe could have, 
he would have fed her himself." 
</P>
<P>
Jones lingers long on nothing, leaving the reader tantalized and hungry for 
more. At times, this book seems almost a skeleton of a novel. The author's 
cut-to-the-bone prose style is emotionally effective -- in this book as well as 
her first novel, "Fish Tales." But I felt short-changed on the story. I wanted 
to know more about the lives of her characters: Mishe, Raphael, their three 
daughters and secondary characters introduced with some fanfare but put to 
little use -- a black collegiate football star invited to a society dance by 
his rich, white friend and a black chauffeur from the Carribean who mentions, 
to Mishe's confusion, that he has ancestors from France. If you a bring a 
2,000-pound elephant onto the stage you better use him. 
</P>
<P>
But the swift-paced sensuality of the novel provides an accessible context for 
the book's main themes of race and class. These are perennial issues in 
African-American literature. Increasingly, however, "black" writers are 
portraying the multiracial reality of their heritage as a source of pride 
rather than shame, an affirmation of their Americanness. For in what other 
country have so many of the planet's people merged? Among what other American 
ethnic group has the blood of so many others blended? 
</P>
<P>
The act of rape, the sexual brutalization of black women by white men during 
and after slavery, is the shame that fuels the African-American's rejection of 
her white ancestry. But that, of course, was and is not the only source of the 
group's mixed genetic pool. (And rape was not always the context for sexual 
relations between African-Americans and European-Americans.) The genes of 
millions of Native Americans have been absorbed into the so-called black 
population. That particular amalgamation was not a source of shame, but of 
pride for many African-Americans in the past -- so much so they set themselves 
apart from other blacks and thought themselves "hankdie," as Jones writes. A 
class apart. And the lighter the complexion, the straighter the hair, the 
keener the features, the more they were a class apart. They and other "blacks" 
who physically approximated the "white" ideal formed much of the early 
African-American bourgeosie until the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
But there's more amalgamation mischief going on in Jones' book than class and 
color tensions among African-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
What's the obvious consequence of "black" people passing? They get married to 
people who don't know they are black. Sometimes they marry into prominent 
"white" American families, like the captains of industry who reside in 
Michigan. Or they marry ordinary folks, like the real-life Susie Guillory 
Phipps did, a Louisiana woman who looked Caucasian, thought she was Caucasian. 
In the early 1980s, she found out her birth certificate identified her as 
"colored," because of an 18th-Century black relative. The state of Louisiana 
refused to change her racial designation. 
</P>
<P>
There are millions of Phippses in America, with and without colored on their 
birth certificates. And there have been millions of "blacks" who looked like 
Raphael de Baptiste who either passed or, like her daughter Lilly in the novel 
embraced her African ancestry but was rejected by darker-skinned "blacks." In 
either case, the pain they experience is deep, sometimes deadly, Jones shows 
us. 
</P>
<P>
Jones' book is being touted as a "visionary novel of color and class in 
America" by its publisher. Hyperbole, but not purely promotional blather. 
Articulating the sentiments of millions, Jesse Jackson has called for "blacks" 
to reclaim the name African-American. What does this mean? 
</P>
<P>
As the 21st Century breathes down our necks, prods us to wake up to the 
expanding melange of races and cultures shaping the nation, interacting with 
each other, will the term African-American be as much of a racial and cultural 
obfuscation as the term black? Or will it be an ethnic label describing people 
with a shared culture descended from Africa, transformed in America and 
genetically intertwined with the myriad ethnicities of the United States? 
</P>
<P>
If Afro-Americans can't embrace the totality of who they are, and if 
Euro-Americans who maintain socio-political control refuse to acknowledge it, 
there is much tragic cultural mischief still to be made.

FICTION IN BRIEF

<P>
THE DREAM OF A BEAST by Neil Jordan (Random House: $12.95) 
</P>
<P>
Like "Blue Velvet" and "Parents," two recent films about the domestic 1950s, 
this inspired, surrealistic novel reveals the emotional currents swirling 
beneath the calm surface of suburban life. But rather than depicting these 
feelings as a dark, dangerous underworld best suppressed with a smile, as the 
films have done, Jordan, director of the 1986 film "Mona Lisa" and one of 
Ireland's preeminent fiction writers, presents them as sources of great energy 
and creativity. By relating to our environment more viscerally, Jordan 
suggests, we can overcome the alienation that arises from stultifying routine. 
</P>
<P>
The novel begins with portents of change and decay hanging in the air. A heat 
wave envelopes the narrator's community and strange blooms begin to grow from 
cracks in the pavements, easing their way along the shop fronts and covering 
plate-glass windows with "thick, oily, unrecognizable leaves." The mysterious 
"changes" begin to transform the narrator as well, who becomes acutely 
sensitive to his neighborhood for the first time, noticing "the extraordinary 
scent" of its gardens, "moist and heavy, like a thousand autumns, acres of hay 
longing to be cut. . . . All the gardens seemed to sing at once, a symmetrical 
hum of praise to (the) afternoon." As his sensitivity to the natural world 
grows, however, his connection with human society becomes more tenuous; soon, 
he loses hold of even language's tether, hearing only the underlying patterns 
in cocktail party chatter, from the "soft, conch-like" voice of his wife, 
"falling like a wave, as if to protect me," to the hum of a timid friend, like 
"an insect beating its wings fiercely, to escape." 
</P>
<P>
The narrator then undergoes a symbolic journey, brilliantly portrayed with 
vivid, thoughtful imagery, which ultimately brings him closer to his wife and 
daughter than he had been when the "changes" began. His odyssey might be called 
a dream, but it is actually more reminiscent of a journey back to childlike 
consciousness, where colors, textures and sounds surprise and evoke intense 
feelings. The narrator's journey suggests that this state of consciousness can 
be far more revelatory than adulthood, an abstract state of mind based on not 
being surprised (and thus endangered) by the environment. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, then, "The Dream of a Beast" is an eloquent testament to the value 
of listening to the poetry of everyday life, something the narrator appreciates 
one night as his daughter sleeps in a nearby room: "The house was silent now 
but for a rustling of bedclothes somewhere and the tiny hum of Matilde's 
breath. I stood on the landing, listening to the new quality of this silence. 
Slowly it came to me that silence was not what for years I had supposed it to 
be, the absence of sound. It was the absence, I knew now, of the foreground 
sounds so the background sounds could be heard. These sounds were like breath 
-- like the breath of this house, of the movement of the air inside it, of the 
creatures who lived in it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WIND Stories by Leigh Allison Wilson (William Morrow: $17.95) 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the bleakness of so much contemporary American fiction isn't 
entirely reflective of the national mood, for in periods of complacency such as 
the 1950s and '80s, authors often gravitate toward malcontents, overlooking 
those who gain some satisfaction simply from endeavoring to carry on. One 
writer who hasn't forgotten these ordinary folk, however, is Leigh Wilson, who 
portrays them with admiration in this quiet and sensitive collection. 
</P>
<P>
At moments, underlying anxieties penetrate the calm reserve of Wilson's 
characters and their emotions briefly spiral into panic: One woman, for 
instance, looks out her window at castles of ice and reflects, "I thought maybe 
I was dying." Wilson's characters are also, despite their natural 
gregariousness, strangely unable to connect with others; the short story form 
seems to make it difficult for Wilson to provide a context for their isolation. 
</P>
<P>
By and large, however, Wilson's protagonists persevere as optimistically as 
possible, having achieved a sense of equanimity despite their diminished 
expectations. One particularly representative character, for instance, a UPS 
truck driver by day and pool player by night, has accepted these "simple 
facts": "Maps are flat; cities are not. Obstacles are everywhere, but the good 
driver knows where they are and how to avoid them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TALES OF NATURAL AND UNNATURAL CATASTROPHES by Patricia Highsmith (Atlantic 
Monthly: $16.95) 
</P>
<P>
The catastrophes actually are all "unnatural," prompted when Patricia 
Highsmith's bizarre, blundering characters attempt to defy nature: the defense 
tactics of a high-rise crumble against a crawling army that fumigation can't 
kill; the Nuclear Regulatory Commission finds that its hiding place for nuclear 
waste isn't so sporting after all; a Japanese whaling ship gets its due after a 
day harpooning whales. 
</P>
<P>
While best known as a writer of thrillers, Highsmith, a Texas-born author now 
living in Switzerland, is primarily concerned with crafting stories to evoke 
the human comedy. Her wry portrayals of human folly sometimes lack sympathy, as 
in the tasteless piece "Rent-a-Womb," which trivializes the abortion debate. 
But Highsmith condescends wittily and without favor, and so we soon cease to 
take offense, enjoying stories we might otherwise have dismissed as prejudiced. 
</P>
<P>
"Mabuti," for example, satirizes the dictator of a small African nation, who 
frantically tries to prepare for the arrival of a United Nations delegation, 
burning everything from garbage to corpses and trying to transform Government 
House, a brothel with "a couple of rooms holding papers with which the country 
gained its independence," into a "building like the Parthenon." Everything goes 
awry, of course: The city is shrouded in smoke from the burning when the 
delegation arrives and the Government house erupts in a conflagration when 
Mabuti soldiers try to "properly" cremate people who had died in an elevator. 
The U.N. members are less-than-pleased -- so Bomo has them shot. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FROM A DISTANT PLACE by Don Carpenter (North Point Press: $17.95) 
</P>
<P>
A credible depiction of the dark side of a much-heralded American dreamland -- 
Marin County -- "From a Distant Place" focuses on Jackie Jeminovski, a 
45-year-old former stewardess whose emotional stability and mental 
self-assurance stem wholly from the perception of others that she "has 
arrived." Jackie's image, projected by her trim figure and huge house, is just 
that, for her house is both too expensive for her budget and too expansive for 
herself (she is divorced and her children are living on their own). 
</P>
<P>
Refreshingly, though, "From a Distant Place" doesn't moralize. An alcoholic, 
Jackie avoids any real intimacy; one night, for example, she leaves a room 
where she had been talking with two male friends and reemerges wearing only her 
high heels. Beaming, she tells her friends "I love you." Instead of offering 
portentous judgments about Jackie's blithe, superficial spirit, though, 
Carpenter suggests that in some ways it helps her fill the "big empty space" 
she feels "between housewife and grandmother" and encourages her to accept 
others more readily than she accepts herself. She forgives her 20-year-old son 
Derek, for example, when he comes home after being in jail for the first time: 
"She did not want to pry the truth out of him. She didn't really care. She felt 
too good, just having him back. None of it made any sense anyway. Just like the 
rest of her life." 
</P>
<P>
Derek is Carpenter's most intriguing character, as self-critical as his mother 
is self-deluding. Once a boy of fragile self-esteem, he cultivates an inner 
confidence in the course of these pages that allows him to take a low-status 
job in a shoe-store and not "care when former classmates come into the store 
and are patronizing. Let them. He would grin and look shy and sell them shoes." 
As unconventionally as many of Carpenter's earlier characters, Derek comes of 
age after participating in a robbery, emerging from it "if possible even more 
confused than before. But at least he knew one thing by now, he could take his 
cowardice in his hands sometimes and control it, get past it, and find himself 
in a world where nothing mattered but what he wanted."

JACK SMITH ON SUNDAY: A MEMOIR SENT CROSS-COUNTRY SHOWS A GRANDSON'S PROMISE AS 
ESSAYIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
AFTER OUR TRIP to New England last fall, we arrived back at the Waldorf-Astoria 
in New York City to find a long, faxed message waiting for us. 
</P>
<P>
It was the story of my 9-year-old grandson Casey's life. 
</P>
<P>
Faxing is a facet of the new technology that I don't yet understand. 
</P>
<P>
Evidently, my son had taken his son's memoir to The Times, and my secretary had 
faxed it to me. 
</P>
<P>
My grandson's memoir reminded me of one of those long Christmas messages that 
people write to bring their friends up to date on everything that has happened 
to them in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
Most of them could use a bit of editing, and my grandson's message was no 
exception. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, it is interesting that a 9-year-old would look back on his life 
as a life and think of encapsulating it in an essay, a summation, an 
autobiography. 
</P>
<P>
I get the impression from his tone, however, that he has a large capacity for 
life -- a zest -- and that when he is 90, his memoirs will look back on a life 
of fulfillment and accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, his life did not begin at the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
"It all started," he tells us, "at the 1986 Dodger game against the San 
Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the first Dodger game I 
</P>
<P>
ever went to. When I got into the stadium, we ordered our food and went to our 
seats in the reserved level on the right-field side. I enjoyed watching 
Dodgervision on the screen and singing 'Take Me Out to the Ballgame.' 
</P>
<P>
"Innings past very quickly until the game was over. 
</P>
<P>
"Then we left the stadium." 
</P>
<P>
As you can see, his spelling, grammar and syntax are excellent. Writing past 
for passed is a common error, English being as exasperating as it is, and he 
will soon correct it. 
</P>
<P>
He does show a beginning essayist's tendency to put in details that the reader 
may not care about. 
</P>
<P>
For instance: "Then we left the stadium." The reader can assume that they left 
the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, knowing what to put in and what to leave out is the hardest task a 
writer has. It undoubtedly bothered Mark Twain and Robert Louis Stevenson, and 
I have an idea it bothers George Will and John Updike. 
</P>
<P>
We soon see that Casey is not devoted only to spectator sports. "About a week 
later I started going to a summer camp called Mar Vista Camp. I had lots of fun 
at the camp playing caroms, battle ball, baseball and lots of other games." 
</P>
<P>
I was happy to see that his interest is divided between the playground and the 
classroom: 
</P>
<P>
"At school I found out what room I was in, went there and met my teacher. Her 
name was Mrs. Pecora. 
</P>
<P>
"She was a pretty nice teacher. When spelling started, Mrs. Pecora played a 
game with us with two teams. She'd ask a person from one of the teams to spell 
a word. If you got the word wrong, you would be out. Every time she asked me a 
word, I got it right except for one word." 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't say what that one word was. It might have been passed. 
</P>
<P>
"Months passed by," he then writes, proving that he mastered that little 
problem and demonstrating that he knows how to condense time, as every good 
writer must. 
</P>
<P>
He takes us through his tribulations in Little League, and finally the school 
year is over. We are approaching the climax: The Dodgers are heading for the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"Every game passed by and the Dodgers were getting closer and closer to the 
playoffs. Dodger pitcher Orel Hershiser had 59 scoreless innings to break Don 
Drysdale's record. Finally the end of the season came and the Dodgers made it 
to the playoffs. I was so happy when I found out the Dodgers clinched the 
division title, I woke up my dad to tell him the news. That was the best time 
of my life! 
</P>
<P>
"I was never so happy in my intire life." 
</P>
<P>
I think he deserves an A-minus for spelling. There was only past and that 
little slip on intire. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously his memoirs were written before the Dodgers won the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
He must have thought it was the best of all possible worlds.

<P>
Terry Gilliam's warped and wonderful 1981 Time Bandits (Channel 5 Sunday at 6 
p.m.) fairly bristles with wit, invention, a wry and fey intelligence and a 
conjurer's chest of dazzling effects. It revolves around a bright, endearing 
British 11-year-old (Craig Warnock) who takes off with a six-pack of dwarfs who 
have stolen a map that charts a few dropped stitches in the fabric of the 
universe -- virtual trips through time and space. 
</P>
<P>
Conan the Barbarian (Channel 13 Sunday at 6 p.m.) revives the heroic epic in 
all its innocent pleasures on a spectacular scale and with a sophisticated 
style. Directed and co-written (with Oliver Stone) by John Milius from a 
character created by writer Robert E. Howard over 50 years ago, it's a classic 
struggle between good and evil. Also an homage to illustrator Frank Frazetta, 
it stars that Frazetta superman come to life -- Arnold Schwarzenegger. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Hartman and Vanessa Williams stars in the new TV movie Full Exposure: The 
Sex Tapes Scandal (NBC Sunday at 9 p.m.), a mystery centering on an 
investigation of a murder in the Los Angeles underworld. 
</P>
<P>
The 1986 Abrahams, Zucker and Zucker Ruthless People (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.) is 
that delicious L.A. satire in which the lives of a nouveau riche Beverly Hills 
couple (Bette Midler, Danny DeVito) are turned upside down when a desperate 
young couple (Judge Reinhold, Helen Slater) kidnap Midler -- only to discover 
DeVito doesn't want her back at any price.

The 1985 Red Sonja (Channel 5 Monday at 8 p.m.) is a misfired attempt to reteam 
Arnold Schwarzenegger and his Conan the Barbarian co-star Sandahl Bergman in 
another Robert E. Howard tale. 
</P>
<P>
In Going Ape! (Channel 11 Monday at 8 p.m.) the humans act more like a bunch of 
baboons than the simians. In this numbskull 1981 comedy, Tony Danza inherits $5 
million with the proviso that he keep -- and protect -- three prize orangutans 
for at least five years. 
</P>
<P>
The ads for The Beastmaster (Channel 5 Tuesday at 8 p.m.), a pleasant 1982 
variation on "Conan the Barbarian," proclaimed that its athletic hero (Marc 
Singer) was "born with the courage of an eagle, the strength of a panther and 
the power of a god" -- and that pretty much sums him up. 
</P>
<P>
Rear Window (Tuesday at 8 p.m.) is the first of four of Hitchcock's finest to 
screen on Channel 13's 8 p.m. movie slot. The others: Vertigo (Wednesday), 
North by Northwest (Thursday) and 1956's The Man Who Knew Too Much (Friday). 
</P>
<P>
The 1980 Borderline (Channel 5 Wednesday at 8 p.m.), one of the first Hollywood 
movies to deal with the plight of illegal aliens, stars Charles Bronson as a 
border patrol chief. It's a sympathetic portrait of a shrewd old pro who does 
his job well, if unwillingly. 
</P>
<P>
If the 1984 Joy of Sex (Channel 11 Wednesday at 8 p.m.) is good for anything, 
it's as a screen test for several charming young actors (Lisa Langlois and 
Cameron Dye in particular) getting the better of this dumb, gross and offensive 
coming-of-age tale. 
</P>
<P>
Directed by Don Siegel, Telefon (Channel 5 Thursday at 8 p.m.) is a diverting, 
sleek but nevertheless routine and slight spy thriller, starring Charles 
Bronson and Lee Remick. 
</P>
<P>
The Final Countdown (Channel 11 Thursday at 8 p.m.), the aircraft carrier 
Nimitz zips 40 years across time to intercept the Japanese war fleet en route 
to Pearl Harbor. Weak on special effects, this 1980 film gets by on the 
cleverness of its story. 
</P>
<P>
The White Buffalo (Channel 5 Friday at 8 p.m.), an offbeat 1977 Western, stars 
Charles Bronson as a Wild Bill Hickock for whom the image of buffalo is a 
symbol of death. 
</P>
<P>
The Black Stallion (Channel 5 Saturday at 6 p.m.) is one of the most 
irresistible movies ever made about a boy and a horse, and Excalibur (Channel 
13 Saturday at 10 p.m.) is one of the most engaging renderings of Arthurian 
legend. 
</P>
<P>
A Taste of Honey (Channel 28 Saturday at 10 p.m.) is that engaging 1961 movie

HER FATE IN HIS REVOLUTION;

EVA LUNA BY ISABEL ALLENDE; TRANSLATED FROM THE SPANISH BY MARGARET SAYERS

This novel is a striking departure for Isabel Allende: not the well-heeled clan 
of "The House of Spirits," nor the declining gentry of "Of Love and Shadows," 
but a lone girl's childhood and coming of age. Eva Luna knows her father only 
as legend; her mother dies when Eva is only 6 years old, leaving her in the 
hands of a succession of caretakers who nourish and encourage her. It is a 
picaresque tale of a South American child who likes to tell stories and who 
grows up to write novels. 
</P>
<P>
"My imagination took wing when I saw that corridor of locked doors," Eva 
writes, "behind every one I thought I heard whispers, moans, laughter. At first 
I put my ear to the doors and peeked through the keyholes, but soon I found I 
did not have to do that to divine the universes hidden there. . . . It took 
only the slightest effort of imagination to pass through the door and enter the 
extraordinary stories unfolding on the other side of the walls." 
</P>
<P>
Eva's introduction to politics comes from Huberto Naranjo, a 9-year-old boy who 
lives on his own and who meets Eva when she first runs away from her 
housekeeping job. "At 16 he would be the leader of a street gang, feared and 
respected . . . he would be the hero of the whores in the red-light district, 
and the nightmare of the guardia." With his help, Eva lives for some time at 
the home of one of his friends, a Madam (La Senora) who is forced to flee when 
the military cracks down on the red-light district. 
</P>
<P>
The caretaker who changes Eva's life is Riad Halabi, who finds her on the 
street during the tumultuous days of the Revolt of the Whores. The 
compassionate Arab shopowner adopts Eva -- and hires a teacher to instruct her 
to read and write. 
</P>
<P>
Allende's descriptions of Eva's burgeoning writing talents are enormously 
moving, and the reader will wonder to what degree they are autobiographical. 
"Writing was the best thing that had happened to me in all my life; I was 
euphoric," Eva writes. "I read aloud, and walked around with my notebook tucked 
under my arm so I could use it at any moment; I jotted down thoughts, the names 
of flowers, birdcalls; I made up words." 
</P>
<P>
Years later Eva recounts her own life story: "Characters stepped from the 
shadows where they had been hidden for years into the light . . . each with a 
face, a voice, passions, and obsessions. . . . I recalled the tales my mother 
told me when we were living among the Professor's idiots, cancer patients, and 
mummies; a snake-bitten Indian appeared, and a tyrant with hands devoured by 
leprosy; I rescued an old maid who had been scalped as if by a spinning 
machine, a dignitary in a purple plush chair, an Arab with a generous heart. . 
. . Little by little, the past was transformed into the present, and the future 
was also mine." 
</P>
<P>
Eva re-encounters Huberto Naranjo now an adult -- he has become the leader of a 
guerrilla movement, Comandante Rogelio -- and she becomes his lover. But while 
she is seduced by his rhetoric and even collaborates in an attempt to free 
political prisoners, his world is exclusively a man's turf, and Naranjo an 
"ingrained macho": "He believed that because I had been born a girl I was at a 
disadvantage, I should accept my limitations and entrust myself to others' 
care. . . . His revolution would not change my fate in any fundamental way; 
under any circumstances, as long as I lived I would still have to make my own 
way." 
</P>
<P>
When Allende focuses on Eva's story she is on terra firma, but for reasons that 
are unclear, she shoehorns a major subplot -- that of a young cameraman who 
ultimately will become Eva's life companion. The result is a superfluity of 
incident, extraneous and intrusive, all in the service of an artificially neat 
ending. 
</P>
<P>
Such qualifications aside, "Eva Luna" is an inventive and feverish political 
fable from one of South America's most interesting writers.

A VIETNAM WAR MEMOIR 
</P>

<BYLINE>
<P>
By LE LY HAYSLIP and JAY WURTS, This is adapted from When Heaven and Earth 
Changed Places: A Vietnamese Woman's Journey From War to Peace by Le Ly Hayslip 
with Jay Wurts, copyright 1989, which will be published in May by Doubleday.

<TEXT>
<P>
For the first 12 years of my life, I was a peasant girl in Ky La, now called Xa 
Hoa Qui, a small village near Da Nang in Central Vietnam. My name was Phung Thi 
Le Ly, but I was called Bay Ly because I was the sixth-born -- bay means six. 
</P>
<P>
My father taught me to love God, my family, our traditions and the people we 
could not see: our ancestors. He taught me that to sacrifice oneself for 
freedom was a very high honor. From my love of my ancestors and my native soil, 
he said, I must never retreat. 
</P>
<P>
From my mother, I learned humility and the strength of virtue. I learned that 
it was o disgrace to work like an animal on our farm, provided I did not 
complain. "Would you be less than our ox," she asked, "who works to feed us 
without grumbling?" She also taught me that there was no love beyond faithful 
love and that ,in my love for my future husband, my ancestors and my native 
soil, I must always remain steadfast. 
</P>
<P>
for the next three years of my life, I loved, labored and fought steadfastly 
for the Viet Cong against American and South Vietnamese soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
I WAS 13 THE FIRST time I saw a Viet Cong fighter up close. It was 1963, and I 
was in our kitchen. It was just about dark and I happened to gaze out the 
window at the house next door, which belonged to Manh, my teacher. While I 
watched, a half-dozen strangers scampered into the house and shouted, "Nobody 
move!" Manh's house was often used by villagers for gambling, and at first I 
thought it was Republican soldiers on a gambling raid. Then Manh was led out, 
at gunpoint, with his hands atop his head. 
</P>
<P>
I could hear his familiar voice: "But -- I don't know what you're talking 
about!" and "Why? Who told you that?" As I leaned out the window to get a 
better view, I saw one of the strangers standing just outside. He wore black 
garments, like everyone else, and a conical sun hat, even though it was already 
dark. His sandals were made from old tires, and his weapon had a queer, curved 
ammunition clip that jutted down from the stock like a banana. He was so close 
to me that I was afraid to run away or even duck for fear that he would see or 
hear me. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, one of the strangers barked an order in an odd, clipped accent (I 
found out later that this was how everyone talked in the North), and two of his 
comrades prodded Manh to the edge of the road. I could hear him begging for his 
life when two rifle shots cut him short. Then the strangers ran a Viet Cong 
flag up the pole that stood outside our schoolhouse. "Anyone who touches that 
flag will get the same thing as that traitor!" their leader shouted. 
</P>
<P>
The guard by my window glanced over and gave me a wink. He knew I had been 
there all the time, and he knew I had learned the lesson he had come to teach. 
He followed his troop into the night. 
</P>
<P>
"Manh was Catholic," my father said later. "And a follower of President Diem. 
He talked too much about how Buddhists were ruining the country." 
</P>
<P>
"But we're Buddhists, Father! He never said bad things about us!" 
</P>
<P>
"No," my father explained, "but what he said endangered others -- and some of 
those people lost their lives. I am sorry for Manh and his wife and children. 
But Manh's own careless words got him into trouble. We'll give him a decent 
burial, but you remember what you've seen -- especially when you think about 
talking to the soldiers." 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Republicans brought steel girders and cement and barbed wire to 
Ky La. They cut down the Viet Cong flag and told the farmers to build defenses 
around the village. Ditches from the French occupation, now overgrown with 
weeds, were made deeper, and bamboo trees were cut down to make spikes and 
watchtowers. As soon as the sun went down, the Republicans set up ambushes 
around the village and waited for the dogs to bark -- a sure sign of intruders. 
</P>
<P>
But nothing happened. After awhile, the Republican troops pulled out and left 
us in the hands of the Popular Force, the Dan De -- local villagers who had 
been given small arms and a little training in how to use them. Because the war 
seemed to leave with the soldiers, the PF officials declared peace, and we 
villagers, despite Ky La's new necklace of stakes and barbed wire, tried very 
hard to believe them. 
</P>
<P>
A few nights later, the Viet Cong cadre and many of the villagers piled onto a 
huge bonfire everything the Republicans had given us to defend the village. "On 
this night," the cadre leader told us, "Ky La was saved." He gestured to the 
black-uniformed troops around the fire. "We are the soldiers of liberation! We 
are here to fight for our land and our country. Help us stop the foreign 
aggression, and you will have peace. Help us win, and you will keep your 
property and everything else you love. Ky La is our village now -- and yours. 
We have given it back to you." 
</P>
<P>
Another soldier ran yet another Viet Cong flag up the pole. And as the troop 
left, the leader turned and told us:"Down the road you will find two traitors. 
I trust they are the last we will see in Ky La. We must leave now, but you will 
see us again." 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, we heard gunshots on the road to Da Nang. My father helped 
bring back the bodies. One was Manh's younger brother -- a victim because of 
his family connections. The other was a village busybody who had become known 
as a government informer. Now the informer had been informed against, and I 
felt that he, like Manh, had gotten what he deserved. It was my first taste of 
vengeance, and it was sweeter than I expected. It made even a little farm girl 
feel like someone important. 
</P>
<P>
EVERYTHING I knew about the war I learned from the North Vietnamese cadre 
leaders at midnight meetings near the swamps outside Ky La. I assumed what I 
heard was true because it matched the beliefs we villagers already had. 
</P>
<P>
We learned that Vietnam was con rong chau tien -- a sovereign nation that had 
been held in thrall by Western imperialists for more than a century. It was a 
lesson that came on the heels of the French war (which began in 1946 and lasted 
on and off until 1954, when Vietnam was divided, North and South). 
</P>
<P>
The cadre leaders said the partition of our country was nothing more than a 
ploy by the defeated French and their Western allies, mainly the United States, 
to preserve what influence they could in our country. "Why should outsiders 
divide the land and tell some people to go north and others south? If Vietnam 
were truly for the Vietnamese, wouldn't we choose for ourselves what kind of 
government our people wanted?" 
</P>
<P>
Those who favored America quickly occupied the seats of power formerly held by 
the French, but the North stayed pretty much on its own. The leader in the 
South, President Ngo Dinh Diem, America's ally, was Catholic like the French 
and idealized by many who said he was a great patriot. The leader in the North 
was Ho Chi Minh, whom we were encouraged to call Bac Ho, Uncle Ho -- the way we 
would refer to a trusted family friend. We knew nothing of his past beyond 
stories of his compassion and desire for an independent Vietnam. The choice of 
which leader best represented the hopes of our ancestors was, for us, a 
foregone conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
The Viet Cong cadre leaders organized the village. The able-bodied men who were 
excused from duty with the guerrilla militia were ordered to dig tunnels that 
would allow the Viet Cong to pass in and out of the village without being seen. 
Families were told to build bunkers and to have coffins ready for Viet Cong 
casualties after a fight. 
</P>
<P>
Children were to watch for informers and to run messages between the villagers 
and Viet Cong in the field. We also prepared booby traps and decoys. On the 
paths used most frequently by the Republicans, the Viet Cong hid cartridge 
traps (bullets held over a nail that discharged when stepped on) and 
tripwire-grenade traps of every type. Although we knew how deadly these devices 
could be, we children helped the Viet Cong put them in place. To us, war was 
still a game, and our "enemy," we were assured, deserved everything bad that 
happened to him. 
</P>
<P>
Cadre leaders taught us revolutionary songs and told us how to act when 
Americans and their "Republican lap dogs" were around. 
</P>
<P>
"What will you do when the enemy sleeps in your house?" a leader asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Steal his weapons!" we answered. "Steal his medicine! Steal his food!" 
</P>
<P>
"And what will you do with what you steal?" 
</P>
<P>
"Give it to you!" We laughed and applauded our answers. Whenever we turned 
something in to the Viet Cong -- such as a mess kit or pocketknife -- we were 
given handmade medals and our names were entered on the Blackboard of Honor. 
Because my family's house was on a rise of ground and the Republican soldiers 
felt safe there to the point of carelessness, my name rose quickly on the list. 
</P>
<P>
It was nearly dawn when I got home from the first meeting. My parents, still 
awake, asked what I had been doing. I told them proudly that I was now part of 
the "political cadre," although I had no idea what that meant. I said we were 
to keep an eye on our neighbors and make sure the liberation leaders knew if 
anyone spoke to the hated Republicans. I told my mother to rejoice: Her son, my 
brother, Bon Nghe, who had gone to Hanoi in 1954 when the country was divided, 
would return to be a leader in the South, just as the leaders of our own cadre 
had been trained in Hanoi. 
</P>
<P>
My father wore an expression I had never seen before. He said nothing. It was 
as if he had seen, in my shining, excited, determined little face, the first 
casualty of our new war. 
</P>
<P>
THE PULL AND tug of the war around Ky La soon settled into a kind of routine: 
Viet Cong attack, government counterattack, period of calm, then Viet Cong 
retribution and another round of fighting. Because the Viet Cong were always 
low on ammunition, they seldom attacked unless they were sure of victory. 
Because they had so much of everything, the Republicans seldom counted their 
shots and called most attacks a victory. In between, Republican and American 
soldiers were everywhere, trying hard to "pacify" our village. They distributed 
food and took wounded civilians to GI hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
As time went by, many Ky La children my age were "drafted" as Viet Cong 
fighters. But because I was my parents' last child at home, and because my 
father had worked so diligently to build bunkers and tunnels for the Viet Cong, 
and because my older brother had gone to Hanoi, I was allowed to stay. I was 
inducted into the secret self-defense force; my assignment was to watch a 
stretch of jungle between Ky La and the neighboring village. 
</P>
<P>
On a February morning in 1964, my shift started at sunrise. It was unusually 
chilly and a heavy mist hung in the valleys on three sides of the village, 
causing the world to collapse at my feet. As the sun rose, the ground opened 
around me -- 10 meters, 20, finally a hundred and more. Looming out of the mist 
was a mass of soldiers -- Republicans, hundreds of them. 
</P>
<P>
I panicked. The troops were almost in the village. I forced myself to walk 
toward the road and the soldiers. Every few paces, I bent to pick a sweet 
potato or berries and put them in the bucket we sentries carried to mask our 
activities. Surely, I hoped, the soldiers must think there is no more loyal 
Republican than this farm girl. 
</P>
<P>
When I was past the troops, I dropped my bucket and peeled off two of the three 
shirts I always wore. The top shirt -- the one I wore all day if nothing 
happened -- was brown. Any Viet Cong seeing it would know conditions were clear 
in my sector. The second shirt was white, which I showed if anything suspicious 
had happened. The bottom shirt, the one I wore now, was black and symbolized a 
major threat. 
</P>
<P>
I recognized a Viet Cong scout coming down the road. She stopped when she saw 
that I was not at my station. Slowly, she looked around until she spotted me, 
then scuttled back down the road. I had given my signal in time. 
</P>
<P>
When the Republicans found no Viet Cong, they suspected that someone had warned 
the enemy and rounded up young village women who fit my description. I was 
arrested and put on a truck bound for Don Thi Tran district prison. It was an 
unpleasantly familiar ride. I had been there once before, picked up during a 
demonstration outside of Ky La. 
</P>
<P>
That time, a young Vietnamese soldier had made me squat on the floor of an 
interrogation room. He asked simple questions: "What were you doing so far from 
your home in the middle of the night?" I answered like a terrified child, 
remembering my mother's advice: If you're too smart or too dumb, you'll die. 
Play stupid, eh? That shouldn't be too hard for a silly girl who lets herself 
get caught. I told the soldiers I had sneaked away from home to follow what 
seemed like a feast-day parade. 
</P>
<P>
A blow had stopped my story and almost knocked me out. The questions, my answer 
and the beatings alternated, until I went limp. The next day, I was questioned 
again, but by a different soldier and with no beatings. For two more nights, 
they asked fewer and fewer questions and beat me longer. In the mornings, the 
kindly soldier showed horror at my wounds and asked about village life, hoping 
to discover through my grateful, casual conversations what the beatings did not 
reveal. On the third morning, I was led toward a shaft of daylight where I 
found my mother and my sister Ba's husband, a policeman from Da Nang, who had 
negotiated my release. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as the truck bumped toward the prison, I hoped that my old tormentors 
would not be on duty and that Ba's husband could be summoned before the 
interrogation began. My wishes came true. I was in and out of Don Thi Tran in 
one night. Outside the prison, my brother-in-law yelled at me: "I'm finished 
risking my job for you and your family!" 
</P>
<P>
It took me an hour to walk home. When I got there, the village was buzzing. 
"You're a hero, Bay Ly," my mother said. "The Viet Cong are calling a meeting 
tonight in your honor." 
</P>
<P>
That night, the woman scout testified that I had risked my life by walking 
through the enemy column to give my signal. The cadre leader proclaimed that 
his band of fighters would probably have been wiped out if the Republican 
attack had succeeded. "To honor you, Miss Le Ly," he said, "we will teach all 
the children in the village to sing the Sister Ly song in your honor." 
</P>
<P>
The original Sister Ly was a Viet Cong fighter who was famous for killing many 
enemies. It was Viet Cong practice to dedicate songs to a hero's namesake when 
that person distinguished herself -- but it had never happened in Ky La. 
</P>
<P>
The cadre leader led the singing, and the villagers clapped and cheered. My 
mother beamed proudly and, although my father smiled, too, I could see he was 
worried. He knew such attention often brought more danger than it was worth. 
</P>
<P>
Within days, Republican Rangers -- special forces -- returned to our area. For 
weeks, they bombarded the region, including Ky La, and after one particularly 
intense bombing, I was rousted from a trench with my friend Thien. As soon as 
we climbed out, I knew we were in trouble. "Didn't we arrest you a few weeks 
ago? You're the girl with the filthy VC songbook!" the soldier said, shining a 
flashlight in my face. 
</P>
<P>
"No, not me," I protested. 
</P>
<P>
He shined the light at Thien. "Then maybe it was you -- " 
</P>
<P>
"No, not her either!" I interrupted. "She's from Bai Gian. She's only been in 
the village a little while!" 
</P>
<P>
"Bai Gian!" the soldier spat. "That hole is full of VC!" He called to his 
corporal. "Two more Charlie for My Thi." 
</P>
<P>
A pair of Rangers put us on the ground, frisked us and tied our hands, but cold 
terror had already rendered us helpless. My Thi torture camp -- the 
maximum-security POW prison near China Beach outside Da Nang -- was run by the 
army, not the district police. Even the toughest Viet Cong couldn't talk about 
it without wincing. 
</P>
<P>
In the morning, in my cell, I was awakened by screams. I got off my 
plywood-board bed and crouched on the cement floor, covering my head to block 
the sound. The cell door banged open, and two guards pulled me into the 
corridor. They bounced me against the walls and punched me with their fists, 
shouting threats and accusations as we went. Inside the interrogation room, on 
a table, were scissors, razor blades, surgical knives and a hand-cranked 
generator hooked to wires. 
</P>
<P>
The interrogator ordered me to put my hands on the table. The guards strapped 
down my wrists and the interrogator clipped a wire to each thumb, turned the 
crank a few times and flicked the switch. A jolt of electricity knocked my legs 
out from under me, and the entire room went white. A second later, I was 
hanging from the straps, clambering to stand. My lips were tingly, and my 
fingers twitched in the harness. 
</P>
<P>
"Tell me quickly," the interrogator said, "why were you and the other girl 
hiding in the trench?" 
</P>
<P>
"To escape the explosions -- " 
</P>
<P>
"Liar!" The interrogator slammed the table. "There was a battle going on. You 
are phu nu can bo -- VC cadre girl. You were carrying supplies. Where is the 
ammunition hidden?" 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know anything about ammunition!" 
</P>
<P>
His hand hovered near the crank, but he picked up a short-bladed knife. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you know what this is for?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes." 
</P>
<P>
"Good." He put down the knife. "Release her." 
</P>
<P>
To my amazement, the guards unbuckled the straps. 
</P>
<P>
"Go back to your cell," the interrogator said. "Think about what these things 
could do to your body. Perhaps I'll cut some skin off your ass for some 
sandals, or maybe throw a few of your fingers to the guard dogs. When you're 
called again, Miss Viet Cong hero, come prepared to tell me everything you 
know." 
</P>
<P>
The next morning, I was taken with two other girls and tied to a post. Then a 
guard brushed something sticky on our feet. When I looked down, I saw that the 
ground was covered with anthills and the small black ants whose bites sting 
worse than bees. Within minutes, the girls beside me were screaming and 
struggling against the rope. For some reason, I stood still. The ants want the 
honey, not me, I thought, as if it all made sense. I will stand here and let 
them have it. The more the other girls struggled, the more the ants attacked 
them. The longer I stood still, the higher I could feel the ants climb on my 
body but the fewer times I was bitten. 
</P>
<P>
Several hours later, the guard came back with a bucket of water. He fished 
around in it and brought out a glistening water snake about half the length of 
his arm. He dropped it into my shirt and did the same to the other girls. I 
knew the snakes weren't poisonous, but their bite was painful and their 
slithering was, in its own way, worse than the ants. It was all I could take. I 
screamed at the snake, then at the guard, then at the sky. I screamed until the 
noon blue turned black and my voice was reduced to a squeak. 
</P>
<P>
After sundown, the guards untied us and threw water all over us to retrieve the 
snakes. I was again taken to the interrogator's room where the previous day's 
encounter was repeated. "Where do the Viet Cong hide?" he asked. "I don't 
know," I answered. And on and on. In the end, he threw up his hands and had me 
taken to my cell. 
</P>
<P>
When the door slammed shut, I found myself in darkness with a hollow heart, 
sick stomach and itchy legs. I tried to make sense of what was happening. I 
truly believed that this interrogator was at last convinced that I had nothing 
to hide, but his realization was no guarantee of release. 
</P>
<P>
The next morning, however, I was taken neither to the interrogation room nor to 
the torture post but to the front gate. I was escorted through fences and 
barbed wire and told to go home. 
</P>
<P>
Dumbfounded, I stood and watched the soldiers return to the compound. Then I 
ran for the road to Da Nang and my sister Ba's. 
</P>
<P>
My mother was waiting for me. 
</P>
<P>
"How did you know I'd be here?" I asked. "Nobody gets out of My Thi in three 
days." 
</P>
<P>
"It cost me half your dowry," she said. "Wash up. I'll take you home before 
anything else can happen." 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, there was no more dangerous place for me to be. 
</P>
<P>
THE NEXT TIME the Viet Cong held a rally, the messenger didn't come to our 
house. They couldn't believe that anyone got out of My Thi so quickly, even 
with a bribe. Because the Viet Cong (and because of them, the villagers) no 
longer trusted us, we no longer got warnings about Republican raids or Viet 
Cong reprisals. To make matters worse, our estrangement from the villagers made 
us more trustworthy in Republican eyes, and our house was often spared while 
other homes were ransacked. Even my father's attempts to protect me increased 
our danger. He was certain I would not survive another arrest (Thien still 
hadn't come back from My Thi) and forbade me to go to the fields. He did all my 
work, even those chores I did for the Viet Cong -- delivering rations and 
making up first aid kits. My absence, however, only convinced them that I was 
cooperating with the Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
One evening, two callers appeared at our door. It was Loi and Mau*, two Viet 
Cong fighters who had been my sentry supervisors. "Miss Ly," Loi, the older 
one, said formally. "Moi chi di hop. You must come to a meeting." 
</P>
<P>
My first reaction was gratitude. I was being accepted back by my comrades! -- 
or at least I was being given a chance to tell my side of the story. 
</P>
<P>
We walked through the darkened street, Loi in front and Mau in the rear, as 
guards would escort a criminal, not a hero. Finally, it dawned on me. I am 
going to my trial. The people's court followed only one script and had only one 
ending -- usually a bullet in the head. Somehow, the cold efficiency of My Thi 
seemed more just than this. At least the government kept you alive to give you 
pain, and where there's life, I had learned, there was hope. 
</P>
<P>
We were headed for a thatched cottage where educational meetings were held. 
Inside, about 20 people were seated in a circle. One of the cadre leaders, a 
strident woman named Tram, was in the middle of a speech. Loi stopped me at the 
door, and I felt Mau grab my hands and tie them behind my back. 
</P>
<P>
"So, I ask you, what should we do with a woman who betrays our revolution? What 
should be done with a woman who spies for the enemy and betrays her comrades in 
the field?" 
</P>
<P>
"Execute her! Kill her!" voices piped back. "Teach her a lesson all traitors 
will learn from!" 
</P>
<P>
Then it struck me that Tram never once mentioned my name. And I had not been 
thrust into the center of the room -- the usual place for the condemned. Did 
the people at Tram's meeting know it was me she was denouncing? Had I been 
summoned merely as a warning? Or had Tram and Loi and Mau simply decided to 
take the people's justice into their own hands? 
</P>
<P>
"There, do you hear that, Miss Ly?" Loi whispered in my ear. "The sentence is 
death." 
</P>
<P>
Then I was hustled away, down a narrow path toward the swamp. This, too, was 
unusual. Executions were always done in front of a crowd. Who would profit from 
the lesson if my body simply disappeared? We splashed across swampy ground and 
plowed through brush to a clearing, where there was a hole -- a grave -- with 
two shovels stuck into the loamy soil. All I could think of was my mother and 
father. Maybe they're on their way to save me right now! Loi pulled me sharply, 
and I fell to my knees beside the grave. 
</P>
<P>
I heard the bolt slide up and down in his rifle, chambering a round. I swayed 
on my knees, trying to think of something to say -- anything -- that would keep 
me alive. I also wondered about my ma ruoc hon -- the ancestral ghost who would 
escort me to hell. Would she be beautiful, like the Christian death angels I 
had seen in Catholic picture books? Or would she be harsh and painted, like the 
Buddhas that guarded the sanctuaries at Marble Mountain? I concentrated on my 
breath. As long as I could feel it, I'd know that I was alive. I took in a 
deep, quivering lungful of air and -- 
</P>
<P>
Loi's heavy sandal kicked me onto my side. "What's this?" Loi asked 
sarcastically. "Our hero, Miss Ly, is afraid to die?" His rifle barrel bit into 
my temple like a drill. 
</P>
<P>
My heart shouted silently into the night, Why don't you do it -- bastard! What 
are you waiting for? I prepared for the shattering explosion that would return 
my spirit to the well of souls. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, the pressure of the gun barrel went away, and Loi turned around. I 
heard him whispering with Mau, then his shadow fell over me again. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, hero! Do you want to live?" 
</P>
<P>
My eyes flickered open. Then I prayed that I would find the right words. 
</P>
<P>
"I won't ever talk to the enemy," I said. "I have been shamed enough in the 
village." 
</P>
<P>
"You hear that, Mau?" Loi turned, and I heard Mau laugh. Loi jerked me to my 
feet like a puppet. He removed his peasant's hat and tossed it to the sand. His 
rifle was gone, but a knife gleamed in his hand. Leaves rustled at the edge of 
the clearing, and I noticed Mau had disappeared. What's happening? 
</P>
<P>
Loi knocked me flat again. When I opened my eyes, his face -- inches away, 
grotesque and distorted -- blotted out the stars. His rough hands tore down my 
pants. His weight went away, and he stood astride me in the moonlight, 
frantically unbuttoning his pants. 
</P>
<P>
I wriggled like a crab toward the grave, but Loi's legs held me and I couldn't 
move. His hand covered my mouth, then went to my neck to stop me from sliding. 
I went limp and prayed that, when it was over, Loi would kill me. What choice 
would he have? In Viet Cong eyes, he was now as much a criminal as I was. I 
prayed that my father would find my grave. Certainly, my lingering, shrieking 
spirit would guide him to it, and I would get the funeral I deserved. But not 
this. 
</P>
<P>
Loi's hand relaxed, and breath flowed back in my body. He pulled away, 
staggered to his feet and raised his pants. Mau was next to me. He untied my 
hands and gently turned me over. "Le Ly," he whispered, as if afraid to be 
overheard, "listen to me. If you live, do you promise to never tell anybody 
about what happened?" 
</P>
<P>
I pulled up my pants and stared into the younger man's face. "I didn't deserve 
this, Mau," I said bitterly. I saw Loi across the clearing, urinating into the 
bushes. Loi called over his shoulder, "She's going to tell her family, isn't 
she?" 
</P>
<P>
"No," Mau shouted. "She's too ashamed. Aren't you, Le Ly?" 
</P>
<P>
I didn't say anything. Loi came back and picked up his rifle. "We could have 
killed you, but we didn't," he said. "Consider yourself lucky. If you ever say 
anything about this, we'll wipe out your whole family. Do you understand?" 
</P>
<P>
I nodded sullenly. 
</P>
<P>
They decided to take me to my cousin's house, which lay across the river, for 
the night. Loi knocked on the door, and my cousin Thum answered it with a baby 
in her arms. They spoke a moment. Thum's eyes got big, and Loi and Mau turned 
and went into the jungle. "Remember," Loi said over his shoulder, "we'll come 
for her in the morning." 
</P>
<P>
Thum took me inside and poured water for me to wash. I didn't tell her what had 
happened -- I was too ashamed and I assumed that Loi had lied about it anyway. 
I wrapped myself in a blanket and lay on the bed. Just as I was about to go to 
sleep, someone knocked on the door. I heard a male voice. Mau came into the 
room and said, "Miss Ly, you must come with me." 
</P>
<P>
Like a zombie, I got up and trudged after him. When we were just beyond sight 
of Thum's house, he whirled and pushed me down on the ground. I screamed and 
covered my face; he sat on my stomach and aimed his rifle at my head. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sorry, Miss Ly," he said. "but this is something I have to do." 
</P>
<P>
I swallowed hard and closed my eyes. I tilted my head up to give him a better 
shot. I didn't want him to miss or just wound me. I wanted it all to be over -- 
to have peace. But Mau didn't fire. Instead, rough male hands again tore down 
my pants. I opened my eyes to see Mau struggling feverishly with his belt, the 
rifle crooked absently in his arm. It would have been easy to disarm him and 
shoot him -- but what then? Would hunting down Loi and killing him, too, 
restore my virginity? Would accusing two Viet Cong who wronged me make the 
cadre think I had wronged the Viet Cong any less? 
</P>
<P>
Drugged by hate and fear and confusion, I just lay back and let Mau do what he 
had to do. When he was done, he got up, buttoned his pants and offered me his 
hand. Dizzily, I put on my pants and got up without his help. He walked me back 
to Thum's house, then ran when she opened the door. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing." I said. I didn't even care enough to give her a decent lie. 
</P>
<P>
I went back to bed, and Thum put out the lamp. While I began the endless wait 
for sleep, I tried to plan what to do in the morning. Either Loi or Mau would 
come, or they would not. Either I would be raped again, or I would not. I might 
be arrested again by the Viet Cong, or perhaps by the Republicans -- but what 
did it matter? The bullets of one would just save bullets for the other. Both 
sides in this endless, stupid war had finally found the perfect enemy. A 
terrified peasant girl who would endlessly and stupidly consent to be their 
victim -- as all of Vietnam's peasants had consented to be victims, from 
creation to the end of time. 
</P>
<P>
From now on, I promised myself, I would flow only with the strongest current 
and drift with the steadiest wind -- and not resist. To resist, you have to 
believe in something. 
</P>
<P>
* The names of these Viet Cong fighters have been changed.

POSTMODERN CHILDREN AND 'IN THE BEGINNING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I would like to respond to the Endpapers by Jack Miles on Barry Moser/Virginia 
Hamilton, "In the Beginning" (Book Review, Jan. 8) as well as to the article by 
William Pfaff cited by Miles (Times, Dec. 30). Despite differences, both 
writers appear to regard the current critical and philosophical "postmodernist" 
vogue as, a particularly pernicious relativism. In this light, Miles seems to 
wonder whether children of tender years ought to be exposed to such a shocking 
fact as that there are a number of different creation myths abroad in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
What postmodernism has tried to do is unmask those "moderns" who claimed a 
uniquely privileged position to survey and judge all such myths and values from 
the standpoint of reason, science, and "general truths" to which we today are 
especially privy. Aided by deconstructionism, postmodernism says that all 
language is metaphor and "mythical," that is, works out of a presupposed 
value-laden worldview. 
</P>
<P>
Does this mean nothing but know-nothing relativism? Not at all. Postmodernism 
does not say traditional beliefs are right or wrong, or true on one level and 
not on others, only that we are human beings no different from those in other 
times and places who have affirmed them, that we are myth-makers and 
myth-thinkers like them. 
</P>
<P>
The thing to do, then, is to discover (note I did not say choose) your own myth 
and live it wisely. In this journey of discovery, it seems to me that a book 
like "In the Beginning" -- and comparative mythology generally -- can be 
nothing but a help.

I bought "In the Beginning" from the bookstore where I work but was somewhat 
disappointed with the selection of myths. I do agree that the comparative 
nature of the book asks a lot of 8-year-olds.

Multi-media exposure to science in all its forms, but especially to such fields 
as paleontology which bear on the evolution controversy and astronomy which 
generates its own godless cosmology, pushes kids into relativistic positions no 
matter what their storybooks contain; and of course a lot of storybooks deal 
with that kind of subject matter as well. My hunch is that books dealing with 
creation myths would be a drop in the proverbial bucket. 
</P>
<P>
To take this another step, isn't it probably true that we live in a secular, 
relativist age largely because traditional forms of religious training have 
simply failed the challenges posed by science? Most Sunday schools are still 
highly traditional, my ecclesiastical friends tell me, and pretty dull. Also -- 
at least in many urban areas -- doesn't the sheer variety of religious and 
other cultural life experiences in schools and neighborhoods push observant and 
thoughtful children toward relativism? Of course I'm revealing my own biases, 
but how can it be otherwise? Just about all frontier areas of scientific 
research, and much else in the culture besides, seems pointed in that 
direction.

I would like to tell you about my own meeting with myth. As a young child, I 
liked many kinds of make-believe stories. I think I was about 10 when I 
discovered mythology, dipping into Edith Hamilton, checking Padraic Colum's 
"Northern Myths" out of the school library innumerable times, and later moving 
into the Eddas. My parents taught me, in effect, that religion provides an 
outline and a reason for creation and that science explains the details. The 
differences among the "reasons" didn't bother me a bit; I don't think I thought 
about them. 
</P>
<P>
As an adult, I understand that the distinction between myth/religion and 
science, between the play -- space and the "real world" is not absolute, and 
that primordial dark is the same as primordial light: each is a field which 
becomes a ground as its opposite is created. 
</P>
<P>
My point is that, on the surface, healthy kids get into myths as stories, not 
as competing world views. At a deeper level, the psyche is absorbing what it 
can, on its own terms. Only much later will a few children, or adults, look at 
myth from the outside, whether with positivist condescension, fundamentalist 
outrage or humanist interest.

HOLLYWOOD CHAIRS; 
</P>
<P>
PHILIP'S CHAIR BY DALE EUNSON (MERCURY HOUSE: $18.95; 437 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By William Dozier, Dozier is a veteran film and TV producer and executive. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the mid-'40s, Dale Eunson wrote a touching and heartwarming novel, "The Day 
They Gave Babies Away." He followed with two or three others, and now has 
produced "Philip's Chair," a crowning achievement for him or any novelist. 
</P>
<P>
It tells the story of two boyhood pals, John Ewing and Philip Pearson, who were 
reared in a very small town which the author calls Cottonwood, Mont. As the 
tale unfolds, one becomes increasingly aware that John is an extension of the 
author, and Philip his best friend and inseparable buddy. 
</P>
<P>
If you have ever lived or spent much time in a typical American small town, 
really small, you will identify with and totally relish Eunson's delineation. 
In John's home is an antique bergere chair, always located in the kidney of the 
baby grand piano, and to which Philip gravitates whenever he visits the Ewings. 
When John later moves to New York, the chair follows, and when Philip moves to 
New York, he follows the chair. So now you know he did not become either an 
archbishop or an Oxford don. 
</P>
<P>
Philip's father, Sam Pearson, is Cottonwood's baronial banker; John's father a 
struggling farmer. But Sam Pearson is not Philip's biological father. It seems 
his mother was somewhat errant in her choices of sexual partners. Philip, of 
course, is kept primly unaware of his male parentage, if, indeed, his mother is 
unerringly aware thereof. 
</P>
<P>
Farming was a precarious occupation prior to World War II, just as it is today, 
and inevitably small farmers like John's father frequently went belly up, and 
small- town bankers like Philip's father took a beating on defaulted loans. So 
John soon moves to Los Angeles where his mother has a sister, and is promptly 
followed by Philip. Both find their way into the emerging motion picture 
industry. Before long, they become studio writers and in time, adroit and 
highly paid ones. 
</P>
<P>
The time is the '20s and Eunson cleverly weaves in such luminaries of the time 
as Mae Busch, Gloria Swanson, Carmel Myers and Ramon Novarro. 
</P>
<P>
John and Philip remain close pals, with unavoidable intermittent fights and 
strained relations, but never for long. John is slow to manifest much prowess 
with girls, but after age 19, he begins to compensate for lost time. Philip, on 
the other hand, remains somewhat aloof from the gentler sex. Today, any 
discerning observer would tag him as incipiently gay. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, to support himself between script writing assignments, John 
becomes secretary to distinguished novelist, playwright, and film director, 
Rupert Hughes, and it is he who first takes John with him on a business trip to 
New York. John takes to Gotham as a fly to honey, settles there, finds love 
with Elizabeth who soon becomes his wife, and together they produce daughter 
Amy. 
</P>
<P>
Philip's health deteriorates, but when World War II engulfs the world, he 
rushes off to enlist and is accepted in a special sort of unit. 
</P>
<P>
The story comes to a shocking, yet also satisfying, conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
Eunson writes fluently, highly literately, with delightful and often sly humor, 
and with painstaking insight. This is a rich, detailed story, a far cry from 
the many minimally etched novels emerging in the late '80s. Trust me, "Philip's 
Chair" will enthrall you.

EPILOGUE; 
</P>
<P>
LE LY HAYSLIP'S AMERICAN LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN EVANS, Karen Evans is a San Francisco writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHUNG THI LE LY OF KY LA, Vietnam, is now Le Ly Hayslip of Escondido. The 
one-time teen-age Viet Cong collaborator is now an American citizen living in a 
ranch-style house, high atop a hill, surrounded by palm trees and the dry, 
rolling California landscape. She is worlds away from the rice paddies of 
war-torn Ky La. 
</P>
<P>
The memories, however, are never far away. Indeed, as Hayslip writes in the 
forthcoming book "When Heaven and Earth Changed Places: A Vietnamese Woman's 
Journey From War to Peace," "for a daughter growing up on the Central Coast, 
there is almost too much to remember." 
</P>
<P>
 Now 39, Hayslip has a serene countenance that belies the grueling life she 
chronicles in her book. Her giggle still sounds girlish; her emotions are close 
to the surface, and her tears break through as easily as her laughter. Sitting 
in her living room, wearing a powder-blue suit and a red silk flower in her 
dark, curly hair, she speaks with a softly impassioned voice. She is a natural 
storyteller. Words come easily -- poetic Buddhist metaphor one minute, American 
vernacular the next. 
</P>
<P>
Around her, overstuffed sofas and the Encyclopaedia Britannica mix with touches 
of Oriental decoration -- small lacquer and mother-of-pearl plaques on a wall, 
a straw tea basket on a table. In the dining room, bookshelves have become a 
family altar. A statue of Buddha, as large as a toddler, sits serenely among 
incense and pieces of paper bearing the names of her deceased loved ones. The 
white, late-model Toyota in the carport, and the house -- which Hayslip shares 
with her two youngest sons (her eldest son is away at college) -- are the 
trappings of her new American life; the altar is the bridge to the old. 
</P>
<P>
In a small office off her living room is a computer, at which she dictated her 
memories to Jimmy, her eldest child. The events came spilling back. "My mind," 
she says, "was like a computer when you call it to come up." 
</P>
<P>
Her story, polished with the help of co-author Jay Wurts of San Francisco, is 
about a side of the war not written about before; it is an unflinching account 
of a peasant family and an entire people caught in the cross fire of a war 
waged first by the French and the Viet Minh, and then by the Diem regime, the 
Viet Cong and the Americans. For Hayslip, coming of age was a fight for life 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
The book is a survivor's tale, and Hayslip was a survivor from the start. She 
was born in December, 1949, the youngest and smallest of the six children in 
her family. "Suffocate her!" are the first words of the first chapter of the 
book. That's what the midwife who delivered her said to her mother. "I weighed 
only 2 pounds and looked just terrible." 
</P>
<P>
The end of her childhood comes at the end of the excerpt published here. It was 
1965, and Hayslip was 15. She had been arrested three times by the Republicans. 
The Viet Cong suspected that she had become a traitor. She was shunned, 
condemned to die and then raped. She fled to nearby Da Nang. 
</P>
<P>
In Da Nang, Hayslip found a job as a housekeeper and wandered between the city 
and Ky La, returning finally to find her family still under suspicion. 
Eventually, her father petitioned the Viet Cong for a pardon; in return, she 
and her mother were exiled from Ky La. In November, 1965, they headed for 
Saigon. Both found jobs as servants for a wealthy family. But when Le Ly became 
pregnant by her employer, they were out on the streets again. Mother and 
daughter returned to Da Nang, where Jimmy was born in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
With three mouths to feed, Hayslip ventured into the wartime black market -- 
selling Vietnamese crafts to GIs, buying American products with the cash and 
selling these, in turn, on the Vietnamese black market. Her "business" lasted a 
little more than two years, but she became too good at what she was doing. "I 
realized I had come to worship at the shrine of the street-smart and shrewd, 
the tough and canny, and not at the altar of my ancestors. I had become my own 
worst enemy." At one point, she even agreed to one act of prostitution, because 
the fee, $400, was enough to support her family for a year. 
</P>
<P>
She longed for her village, and she feared for her father. When she sneaked 
back to visit him, the village she remembered no longer existed; much of it had 
been leveled by the Americans. She found her father, badly beaten by the Viet 
Cong, lying in the ruins of her childhood home. As she nursed him, he told her: 
"Don't make vengeance your god because such gods are satisfied only by human 
sacrifice. Go back to your little son. Raise him the best way you can. That is 
the battle you were born to fight." 
</P>
<P>
As Hayslip recalls his words more than two decades later, she breaks into 
tears. It was the last time she saw him alive. Less than a week later, in April 
of 1968, her father killed himself. His message was a turning point for her. "I 
was no longer confused with where my duty lay," she writes in her book. "With 
the Viet Cong? With the legal government and its allies? With the peasants in 
the countryside? No -- my duty lay with my son, and with nurturing life, 
period." 
</P>
<P>
She returned to Da Nang bent on finding a better way to survive. She found work 
at the American hospital and at an enlisted men's club, and fell into several 
hapless liaisons with U.S. servicemen. One tried to turn her into a topless 
dancer, another tried to strangle her -- but other Americans came to her aid. 
"Some of my best protectors (were) Americans . . . some of my worst antagonists 
were Vietnamese . . . the dividing line between friends and enemies -- 
spiritual kinsmen and barbarian disrupters . . . became a blur." 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, she began to look to the United States for her survival. "If 
(Jimmy) and I and my father's family name and the things he stood for were to 
survive the death of Vietnam, we should have to turn our eyes elsewhere -- the 
West." By 1970, she had met and married an American civilian contractor from 
San Diego named Ed Munro. Her second son, Tommy, now 18, was born in Da Nang. 
When Munro's contract expired, he took his new family out of Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
HAYSLIP'S BOOK IS ACTUALLY THE STORY OF TWO JOURNEYS. HER PERILOUScoming of age 
in Vietnam is intertwined with an account of her return to Vietnam in 1986, in 
search of her family and her past. The 16 years in between, spent in Southern 
California, are only hinted at. 
</P>
<P>
Her first intimation of American freedom, Hayslip recalls, came when she was in 
a car on a Southern California freeway and she realized that she could sing all 
the songs she'd learned growing up in Vietnam. Among the other things drowned 
out by the war had been music; it had not been safe to sing, lest the songs, 
many of them about suffering or hardship, be interpreted as political 
sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Hayslip stayed home, learning the ways of washing machines and 
dishwashers, keeping house and caring for her sons. "Because of the way I 
thought and was 
</P>
<P>
brought up," she recalls, "I was more a servant than a wife." 
</P>
<P>
She watched American accounts of the war on television, and her question was 
always the same: What about the Vietnamese people? No one seemed to be 
reporting their side of the story. "I read books by GIs, and some of them were 
true, but it only told their side." She and her husband discussed the idea of 
collaborating on a book about Vietnam. But "Ed had two sons in the Navy in 
Vietnam," she explains. "We didn't see things the same way." 
</P>
<P>
She was devastated by cultural collisions, and she longed for Vietnam. So Munro 
arranged for another civilian contract, and they went back in 1971. A year 
later, they returned to San Diego, and seven months after that, Ed Munro died 
of emphysema. That period, she says, was her most difficult in this country. In 
Vietnam, she explains, she would have stayed with relatives for a few months. 
But on the way home from Munro's burial, she remembers, "My sister-in-law 
dropped me off at the door and drove away." 
</P>
<P>
She was on her own in a country so strange to her, she recalls with a laugh, 
that she thought Taco Bell was "some kind of temple" and that the Jack in the 
Box figure was a version of the happy Buddha. 
</P>
<P>
Her first paying job was cleaning houses. She took classes in English. "Little 
by little, I learned about the American way of life." By 1973, she had 
discovered country-western dancing; she met her second husband, Dennis Hayslip, 
at a dance spot. They were married in 1975, and a third son, Alan, was born 
that year. In April of 1975, Hayslip, a U.S. customs officer, made a trip to 
Vietnam and managed to get Le Ly's sister, Lan, and her two children out the 
day before the Communists took over. 
</P>
<P>
At about the same time, she found work in an electronics assembly plant in San 
Diego. "That's when I started to learn how America worked," she says. She 
hadn't forgotten about writing her story, but once again, she got little 
encouragement from her husband. "What do you know?" she remembers his saying 
when she brought it up. "You're a communist." 
</P>
<P>
"We had a lot of problems in our marriage," she says, among them a conflict 
between her husband's rigorous Baptist views and her own Buddhist traditions. 
They were in divorce proceedings when he died in an auto accident in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
No longer forbidden to pay tribute to her ancestors and burn incense, she set 
up a family shrine, added Hayslip's name to her list of relatives to honor and 
began to unravel and record her past. In 1985, before Jimmy left for college, 
the two finally went to work on her book. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, she raised Tommy and Alan and managed a Chinese restaurant in 
Rancho Bernardo for a while and, in 1984, opened her own Chinese-Vietnamese 
restaurant with partners in Temecula. She took business classes at Mesa College 
and made a few profitable real estate deals. She had gained a foothold in her 
new country. 
</P>
<P>
IN THE BACK OF HAYSLIP'S MIND LINgered a desire to return to Vietnam. Hayslip 
had not seen her mother, or her sisters Hai and Ba, or Ba's husband, Chin, for 
more than a decade. She had not seen her brother Bon Nghe, who had become a 
party official in Da Nang, since he had gone to Hanoi in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
She returned in March of 1986, filled with trepidation, knowing that her past 
troubles with the Viet Cong or her work in the black market could endanger her 
and her family. And she wondered whether her family would accept her at all. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, the survivors of her family, and Jimmy's father, with whom she had 
corresponded, at last sat down together for a meal. Across the gulf of years 
and turmoil, the family slowly mended its broken ties. Only her brother Sau Ban 
-- believed killed by an American land mine in 1963, and Lan, in San Diego, 
were absent. 
</P>
<P>
That trip back, Hayslip says, "completed the first cycle" of her life. She 
returned to the United States a different person. She sold her share in the 
restaurant and finished the book she'd been thinking about for 20 years. The 
book's message, despite its descriptions of death and destruction, is one of 
forgiveness and hope. "If you were an American GI," she writes in the prologue, 
"I ask you to read this book and look into the heart of one you once called 
enemy. I have witnessed, firsthand, all that you went through. I will try to 
tell . . . why almost everyone in the country you tried to help resented, 
feared and misunderstood you . . . if you have not yet found peace at the end 
of your war, I hope you will find it here." 
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. is ready for the book," she believes. "There are signs of people 
looking for answers, lots of veterans wanting to speak out and go back to 
Vietnam." Then, in her curious amalgam of Eastern poetry and Western jargon, 
she says: "Souls are hungry. If the car is empty, you go for the gas." 
</P>
<P>
BORN INTO WAR, HAYSLIP IS NOWsomething of a one-woman peace movement. She made 
a second trip to the new Vietnam in February, 1988 -- the 20th anniversary of 
the Tet Offen sive. Her album from that visit contains no photos of smiling 
tourists. Instead, there are pictures of war victims and inadequate medical 
clinics. 
</P>
<P>
So affected was she by the lack of medical facilities to care for the thousands 
still hurt by the war, that a year ago, Hayslip founded the nonprofit East 
Meets West Foundation to support rural clinics in Vietnam. Her plan calls for 
"re-enlisting" Americans who served in a medical capacity in Vietnam or in 
other wars. One such group, the Vietnam Restoration Project, based in 
Garberville, Calif., has received approval to build a clinic, she says, and 
Hayslip is attempting to raise funds for that project. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives me an opportunity to be a bridge," Hayslip says. For one generation 
of Vietnamese, such aid would be a chance "to see Americans as human beings, as 
civilians, with compassion -- to change the old image." She'd also like 
American veterans to see a more compassionate side of the Vietnamese -- "to 
have a bowl of rice, a cup of tea and sit down and talk." 
</P>
<P>
In the Chinese astrological system, Hayslip was born in the year of the water 
buffalo and therefore destined, she says, to be a "servant of mankind." But 
family honor also motivates her. The words of her father echo in her mind. 
"Through him, I learned that although great love alone cannot remove all 
obstacles, it certainly puts no new ones in the path toward peace. 
</P>
<P>
"You come here to do things, to grow and serve," she says simply. "If you 
complain, you miss the point.'

After getting dismal ratings for a hacked-up version of "Brazil," KTLA-TV 
Channel 5 figured it would do its own editing of the steamy "9 1/2 Weeks." 
</P>
<P>
The reason: According to general manager Steve Bell, MGM/UA was distributing a 
cut of Adrian Lyne's film that was "unintelligible." Ray Cipperly, the 
station's supervisor of program editing, called it "sterile to the point that 
there was not much of interest left." 
</P>
<P>
Example: A key scene involving Mickey Rourke blindfolding Kim Basinger, and her 
response, was so severely edited that their ensuing relationship made no sense. 
So KTLA execs restored much of the scene, along with other material. 
</P>
<P>
End result: "9 1/2 Weeks" was a ratings bomb for KTLA. Worse: the original, 
"unintelligible" version pulled better numbers in other markets! 
</P>
<P>
"In hindsight," Bell said of KTLA's special editing job, "it really wasn't 
worth it." Kevin Brass

OUTTAKES: 'WIZARD OF OZ' ANNIVERSARY: DOWN THE YELLOW BOOK ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The observance of the 50th anniversary of the premiere of "The Wizard of Oz" is 
nearly seven months away -- it's Aug. 9. But publishers already have several 
illustrated books set to cash in on nostalgia, like . . . 
</P>
<P>
The search for the genuine ruby slippers worn by Judy Garland in "Oz," subject 
of a Calendar series last March, will be the focus of a trade paperback due out 
in June. "The Ruby Slippers of Oz: The Power, Passion and Pursuit of the 
World's Most Famous Shoes," by Rhys Thomas, will be published by Tale Weaver 
Publishing, Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In his Calendar articles, Thomas uncovered several existing pairs, one of which 
sold for $165,000 in an August auction. The late Kent Warner, a studio costumer 
who saved many of the shoes, will be a central figure in the book, among other 
zealous collectors. 
</P>
<P>
The slippers are the focus of the book, but "it's really about the weird 
underworld of Hollywood memorabilia," Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
In July, Delta will reissue Aljean Harmetz's "The Making of the 'Wizard of Oz,' 
" originally published in 1977, a history of the picture's production and the 
MGM era. New York Times reporter Harmetz said new information in the Delta 
trade paperback was partly inspired by Thomas' discoveries about the ruby 
slippers. She also publishes -- for the first time -- the names of 122 of the 
124 actors who portrayed the Munchkins. 
</P>
<P>
 Helping Harmetz put together the Munchkin cast list was Stephen Cox, whose 
"The Munchkins Remember 'The Wizard of Oz' and Beyond" -- interviews with 28 
surviving little people from the movie -- will be published by E.P. Dutton in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their importance in the film, the individual Munchkin actors were never 
given screen credit, Cox said -- just the collective "Munchkins played by 
Singer's Midgets." 
</P>
<P>
"Now," said Cox, "they finally get some of the recognition they deserve, and 
the opportunity to tell their stories." John M. Wilson

PRIVATE LIVES: WALK LIKE A MAN...OUT OF MY AEROBICS CLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN LITTWIN, Susan Littwin is a feature writer for TV Guide. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I'M MIDDLE-AGED and middle-class and have no history of violence. In fact, the 
only thing I do with any physical force at all is exercise, and I do that in a 
fancy health club in the Valley. So I surprised myself a few weeks ago when I 
nearly came to blows with a half-naked man in my aerobics class. 
</P>
<P>
The man had planted himself front and center in a fast-paced class and refused 
to budge when the class began moving back and forth across the room. He just 
stood there, doing his own little duck paddle. When I crossed what he 
considered to be his territory, he pushed me -- hard. This was no warning 
nudge. This was an outright mean shove. 
</P>
<P>
I turned on him like a kid in a schoolyard fight. The music stopped; luckily, 
no fists flew. We stood toe to toe, eyes blazing. "Don't you ever push me 
again!" I said, teeth clenched. "You'd better watch out!" he lashed back, jaw 
jutting. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind that I felt foolish. What matters to me now is why I was so angry 
with this otherwise unprepossessing middle-aged man. At the time, I just felt 
that he was an intruder, an intolerably male and self-important intruder. 
</P>
<P>
The truth is -- and I'm fully aware I'll be called a reverse sexist, but I've 
lived with direct sexism a long time, and now it's my turn -- I'm highly 
annoyed by men in aerobics classes. This is simply because, in my experience, 
men -- with the exception of professional athletes and the Chippendales dancers 
-- are not good at aerobics. Their movements are too big, too lumbering, too 
uncoordinated. No aerobics teacher will admit this publicly because men are 
paying customers, and fitness people tend to be evangelical. Instead, teachers 
offer special (meaning "slow") classes to introduce men to aerobics. (I even 
read somewhere that a gym was using martial music for men's classes, the theory 
being that they respond to it better.) 
</P>
<P>
But men seem to like aerobics, and more and more of them are showing up at my 
health club's crowded advanced workout at 5:15 p.m., wearing their gym shorts 
and tank tops, swinging their arms and perspiring heavily. They don't notice 
the women around them edging a few extra inches away. And it doesn't occur to 
them that they are annoying, maybe even, well, unwelcome. 
</P>
<P>
I hasten to say I'm not suggesting that men be banned from aerobics classes -- 
not now anyway, when the Jonathan Club and the California Club have finally 
admitted a few women. I just wish men would understand that they are entering a 
woman's domain and learn how to behave acceptably. 
</P>
<P>
After all, women have always struggled to live in a man's world. As children, 
we were tossed out of games for "throwing like a girl," or even worse, "running 
like a girl." As adults, some of us wear suits and neckties to enter business 
and politics and straight-hipped pants to join the police and fire departments. 
We labor valiantly to act like men, to be more competitive, to hide our tears, 
to hold our liquor. We spend a good part of our lives trying one way or another 
to be one of the boys. 
</P>
<P>
But men never have to be one of the girls. When they enter what they consider 
female territory -- the produce section of the supermarket, for instance -- 
they turn adorably bumbling. "What are baking potatoes?" they ask aloud, 
clutching a list prepared by a woman, until a clerk or a female shopper comes 
forward to help them. It's a subtle form of slumming, a way of saying, "I don't 
need to know this." 
</P>
<P>
I got angry in that exercise class because I realized that men are so 
comfortably at home in the world that it never dawns on them to act like women. 
For instance, women are self-conscious, a little self-effacing, about their 
physical abilities. A woman who couldn't keep up with the class would tuck 
herself discreetly in the back or to the side of the room. Men don't seem to 
mind not keeping pace with their companions, at least not in aerobics. They 
blithely stand up front, blocking everyone else's view of the instructor, and 
step to music only they hear. One man does odd yogalike stretches while the 
rest of us are following the warm-up routine. Another jogs monotonously from 
side to side. 
</P>
<P>
Women also use space humbly. Notice the way men and women sit. He sprawls over 
both armrests in the movies; she keeps her knees together and elbows close to 
her side. In the gym, women mentally cordon off enough territory to raise their 
arms and keep repositioning to make room for others. Men stand where they 
please and expect others to watch out for them. 
</P>
<P>
And physically, women have better control and coordination. We can remember 
steps and keep the beat. Maybe it's a matter of hormones. A recent study 
connects greater verbal skills and muscular coordination with high estrogen 
levels. But it's also a matter of values. Some men (the ones who don't just 
duck-paddle in place) think that the benefit of aerobics comes from the sheer 
hurtling of the body. They heave and flail, sometimes with weights precariously 
clutched in their slippery hands. Gasping for air and dripping lakelets on the 
floor, they'd be a serious distraction even if they weren't out of step and off 
beat. 
</P>
<P>
One man at my health club pins his locker key to his shorts so that it jingles 
off beat with him. A friend who works out at a famous Westside studio says a 
man there once sweat so profusely that six women shouted in unison, "Get a 
towel!" Minutes later, he lost his grip on a weight and sent it flying into 
someone's face. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, men can't trade in their large muscles for our small ones; they 
can't control their sweat glands, and they probably shouldn't take estrogen. 
But they could emulate us and strive for grace, rhythm and control, instead of 
sticking to the masculine ethos that all exercise is a show of force. And if 
they can't keep up with the class, they can do their modest jog in the back of 
the room until their stamina and coordination improve. 
</P>
<P>
They might also dress like women. This is a touchy point, I know, because men 
feel funny about wearing tights. But a man in shorts, spread-eagled on a mat, 
is no sight for strangers. Anyway, tights are useful garments. They absorb 
perspiration; there's no way to pin a locker key to them. 
</P>
<P>
Men could think of it as dressing for success.

<P>
ROSE TARLOW REWRITES THE HISTORY OF FURNITURE DESIGN FOR HER ADAPTED 'ANTIQUES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Virginia Gray, Virginia Gray is an associate editor of Los Angeles Times 
Magazine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
THERE'S NOTHING AUTHENTIC about Rose Tarlow's furniture designs, and she's 
proud of that. What began five years ago as an experiment in producing 
reproduction-cum-adaptation fur nishings has developed into a successful 
business. "I don't reproduce furniture," says Tarlow, who once paled at the 
thought that she might become known for furniture reproductions. "I simply 
adapt designs until I find them pleasing." 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles antique dealer since 1975, Tarlow frequented European antique 
auctions each year to buy furniture for her store. By the early '80s, she 
discovered that the most appealing pieces at these auctions were no longer 
authentic period works, but what she terms "decorative" pieces. At about the 
same time, the Los Angeles market for truly costly antiques hit bottom. Few 
collectors were willing to pay $50,000 to $100,000 for a piece of furniture 
that in the mid-1970s would have sold for $8,000 to $10,000. Tarlow recognized 
that fine antiques had become far too expensive and that decorative pieces, 
while having less intrinsic value, possessed visual appeal. She then began to 
capitalize on her insight, producing "new" decorative traditional furniture in 
custom sizes, styles, finishes, fabrics -- providing interior designers with 
high quality at lower prices (from about $1,000 to $15,000) than those 
commanded by true decorative antiques. 
</P>
<P>
Interior designer Jarret Hedborg, who recently decorated the home of Bette 
Midler, describes Tarlow's furniture as being "in the best tradition of the 
English eccentric. It's personal, stylish, often whimsical, and, unlike the 
competition, her chairs are comfortable. Although it's very high style 
furniture, I usually downplay it and use it in a country home sort of way." 
</P>
<P>
One of Tarlow's trade secrets is that she can take any piece of her furniture 
and change its appearance simply by using a different base, arm or leg, then 
give it additional individuality by varying the finish -- wood, gold or silver 
leaf, paint or veneer. It isn't unusual to find a Tarlow piece that contains a 
blend of traditional elements -- Chippendale styling, neoclassical motifs, 
maybe some rococo influences, and a finish of an unexpected patina. "I take 
bits and pieces from basic period designs -- an arm, a leg, a decorative motif, 
a certain type of hardware -- and mix the components," Tarlow says. "These 
designs are my own fantasies of what antique furniture should have looked like 
when first made." 
</P>
<P>
Take, for instance, a dark-finished game table with distinct flavors of 
18th-Century French designs, Oriental overtones and graceful cabriole-style 
legs with wide knees that taper gradually to a claw foot. "This table looks 
old, but it isn't," she says. "What makes this one nice is that if you were 
looking for an antique, you could never find a game table as large as this one 
or in such good shape." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, many of the designs seem grand in scale compared to their antique 
predecessors. "California and Texas designers like to use furnishings with 
larger proportions. They often make design statements with size," Tarlow 
explains. "For the most part, I scale things differently for various parts of 
the country. Take New York, for example. It's just not practical to try to fit 
overscaled everything into a classic New York brownstone or other tight 
apartment-sized space." 
</P>
<P>
The Rose Tarlow-Melrose House line is now sold in showrooms in 12 metropolitan 
areas, including Randolph &amp; Hein at the Pacific Design Center in Los 
Angeles and Tarlow's Melrose Place showroom, Melrose House. Tarlow runs Melrose 
House much like a private boutique ("an atelier," she calls it). Here, she 
controls the exclusivity of the furniture and can sell only a limited number of 
a particular piece if she feels so inclined. 
</P>
<P>
Next, Tarlow has decided to try her hand at designing contemporary furniture. 
"I've got some prototypes in the works," she says, "but nothing is completed 
yet. But soon." 
</P>
<P>
It's unusual that such an inveterate classicist would be interested in 
contemporary furniture. Today's ubiquitous concrete, Formica and chrome aren't 
part of her new, modernist vernacular; her basic media will be stone, steel and 
wood. Will she rely on her background in classic design to produce her new 
pieces? "No," Tarlow insists. "My contemporary work will have no resemblance to 
anything living or dead."

A SNEAK PREVIEW OF THE RECENTLY INTRODUCED -- AND QUITE RARE -- JAPONICA 
CAMELLIAS INCLUDES A NEW, ALMOST-YELLOW FLOWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Magazine.

<TEXT>
<P>
THESE ARE CAMELLIAS that you have never seen before -- and that you won't see 
in very many places. Most nurseries have other fine camellias in bloom now, and 
respectable ca mellias also are sold at chain stores at tempt ing prices (last 
year, one store offered gallon-sized camellias for less than $3). Nevertheless, 
these new camellias, the latest efforts of hybridizers, are available only at a 
Southern California camellia (and azalea) specialist, the family-operated 
Nuccio's Nurseries in Altadena. Many of these new plants are Nuccio's own 
introductions, the results of an active breeding program. 
</P>
<P>
February is considered the middle of the camellia-flowering -- and 
camellia-planting -- season. That's one excellent characteristic of camellias: 
Unlike bare-root roses and many other flowering shrubs, camellias can be 
planted when they are in bloom, or soon afterward, so you get to see exactly 
what type of flower you are planting. 
</P>
<P>
The big camellia news a few years ago was the discovery of a small, 
yellow-flowered wild camellia in China. Now Nuccio's is selling a hybrid of the 
large-flowered japonica type with a touch of yellow in it. This new camellia -- 
alas, in very short supply -- was bred in Georgia and named Dahlohnega. It is a 
slow grower; the plant remains compact, and the flowers are "formal double" 
(one of six camellia flower forms). 
</P>
<P>
Dahlohnega flowers usually emerge cream-colored, and only occasionally is there 
a pale-yellow flower. "We thought this was going to be the first yellow 
camellia," explains Tom Nuccio, one of the owners. However, he says, "it is 
definitely not just another white camellia; it is cream. It's a color break." 
</P>
<P>
Another new camellia from Nuccio -- this one in abundance -- sounds promising 
for small gardens. An "under-the-window" camellia, as it's described by Nuccio, 
it grows only 3 or 4 feet high, so it literally will grow under a typical 
window without blocking the view. The foliage is dark, and the plant is 
slow-growing, has an upright shape and remains compact. Its name, Prima 
Ballerina, very much fits the delicate white flowers that are flared and 
ruffled like a ballerina's tutu. 
</P>
<P>
Katie, a Nuccio seedling in good supply, has huge flowers measuring almost 6 
inches across. Some plants have variegated flowers (red streaked with white) 
and leaves (streaked yellow). The plant is upright in habit and of medium size 
(6 feet plus). 
</P>
<P>
Cherries Jubilee is one of the first dark-red camellias with white petals in 
the center -- a striking combination. However, Nuccio warns, only about half of 
the flowers on any Cherries Jubilee plant will have white centers, a 
characteristic that can vary from year to year. A tall grower, Cherries Jubilee 
becomes somewhat leggy, so the top should be pruned out to encourage fuller 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
Nuccio's Carousel is a refreshing, simple pink. One of the earliest camellias 
to flower -- beginning in December -- and longest in bloom, Carousel grows 
fast. The foliage is a handsome dark green. 
</P>
<P>
Also in reasonable supply is the prim Spring Formal, which flowers at the 
latter part of the camellia season, mostly in March. This plant grows to more 
than 6 feet tall. Even when young, Spring Formal produces lots of buds and 
flowers. 
</P>
<P>
Royal Velvet is an elegant dark camellia with "flowers that look up at you" -- 
blooms do not droop or hang down. It is a tall plant, growing more than 6 feet 
high, and is fairly narrow in stature. 
</P>
<P>
When photographed last year, Grand Marshal was named simply No. 8209, a large 
peony-flowered camellia with medium-green leaves. It is still in limited 
supply. A plant of medium height, it will not produce many flowers until it has 
been in the ground for a few years. 
</P>
<P>
The smallest flower of the new Nuccio camellias belongs to a species of 
camellia that was discovered growing wild in China's Yunnan province. Camellia 
collectors bought up all of the Camellia yunnanensis in the fall, but plants 
will be available again next year. This new species has a distinct, somewhat 
lemony fragrance, something not found in other camellias. Nuccio claims that 
the scent can be detected from some distance, although his nose may be more 
finely attuned to this delicate scent than most. He recommends Camellia 
yunnanensis as a hedge because it grows to 6 feet and has small leaves and 
flowers similar to those of a sasanqua. He calls it "White Yuletide," comparing 
it to one of the more popular sasanquas that flowers in late December with 
Rudolph-red petals. 
</P>
<P>
Camellia fanciers might be put off by the buds of this new camellia, which, 
according to Nuccio, are either a wonderful brown "like a Winter Nelis pear" or 
look "dry and about to blow away." The buds are quite brown, but they open to 
reveal pristine white flowers. 
</P>
<P>
Camellia yunnanensis prefers shade, but as with many other camellias, it will 
grow in shade or partial sun. Many plants mentioned here grow at the Altadena 
nursery directly in the sun with little in the way of protection -- and even 
survive the Santa Ana winds that sweep down from the nearby mountains. Nuccio 
suspects C. yunnanensis is one of the more sun-tolerant camellias. 
</P>
<P>
What does the future hold for camellias? So many new species are coming out of 
China by way of Japan, Nuccio reports, that almost anything is possible -- the 
crossing of species is likely to turn up all sorts of interesting new plants. 
Some early crosses have already produced camellias with fragrance, camellias 
almost yellow in color, camellias with wavy foliage and some with bell-like 
flowers and a form that, according to Nuccio, "looks like a Ficus benjamina 
with flowers." He expects to see these species contributing some rather 
uncamellialike traits to the next crop of camellias. Nuccio's Nurseries is 
located at 3555 Chaney Trail, Altadena; telephone (818) 794-3383.

THE CRUELTY QUESTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the screenwriter of "Project X," I want to thank you for your in-depth 
article exploring the trainers' side of the cruelty controversy ("Animals in 
Hollywood -- Actors or Victims?" by Vicki Hearne, Dec. 11). 
</P>
<P>
I know Hubert Wells and Mark Hardin, and I find them to be decent, 
compassionate and intelligent men. I was on the set for a good part of the 
movie, and I never witnessed them or the other trainers abusing any of the 
chimpanzees. It's a cruel irony to make an animal rights film and have it 
condemned for the very issues that it speaks out against. 
</P>
<P>
In my opinion a fanatical witch hunt was waged against the film and these 
trainers. If the people behind this campaign had spent half the time and energy 
investigating military animal experimentation and abuses, there would probably 
have been no need for a movie like this. Thanks to this article, the public has 
at least been able to hear the trainers' side of the story. It's not the 
vindication one would have hoped for, but it's justice enough.

THE CIRCUS AS ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding "The Circus as Serious Art" (Dec. 11): Just what qualifies a circus 
to be compared to ballet or opera as "art"? No singer or dancer is beaten or 
tormented to do totally unnatural acts; no one forces an artist to perform. 
</P>
<P>
The animals forced to do acts that violate nature and their dignity are not 
given a choice. I hate circuses because of the suffering, physical and 
emotional, the animals endure.

May I nit-pick a bit? Reference is made several times to a Marshall eagle. The 
eagle shown with Hubert Wells is a martial eagle. I have seen several of them 
in Africa, and I guess that martial in this sense means warlike, for they are 
highly effective killers of smaller birds.

COSTELLO OPENS FLOODGATES IN 'SPIKE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

ELVIS COSTELLO 
</P>
<P>
"Spike." Warner Bros. *** 1/2 
</P>
<P>
Caustic sketches of schemers and losers. Portraits of dissolution and 
dissipation, treachery and isolation. An anti-Thatcher broadside and a scenario 
of video voyeurism. Murder ballads and protest songs. Jealous laments and a 
face-to-face with the Big Cheese Himself. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Elvis is alive. No, not that Elvis. Elvis Costello. Remember? Glasses. 
Used to put out like three albums a year. Couldn't shut him up. Now, after a 
two-year silence, the floodgates are open. "Spike" bristles with renewed 
invention, energy and expression. 
</P>
<P>
It's all unmistakable, undiminished Elvis in its tunefulness, in its 
revelations of character and situation through metaphor, in its downbeat 
political observations and in its main musical precincts: British pop-rock, 
Celtic folk and cocktail/torch music. Familiar, true, but Costello restlessly 
advances it all into fresh territory. 
</P>
<P>
His major step was hiring on the Dirty Dozen Brass Band, the tradition-bending 
New Orleans hornblowers whose sweetly sour voicings provide both avant-garde 
edge and evocations of a timeless rural South -- sort of Otis Redding meets 
George Gershwin. Whether oblique funk, Band-like soul or a wild '30s cartoon 
big-band spook-house workout with Costello's Irish lineup, the Dirty Dozen 
emerge by a nose as "Spike's" predominant presence. 
</P>
<P>
Costello mixes and matches other players to keep things moving. On ". . . This 
Town . . . ," Roger McGuinn and Paul McCartney contribute to a richly textured 
pop-rock tapestry, full of starburst chimes and unexpected melodic alleys. In 
"God's Comic," a crew that includes bassist Buell Niedlinger lays out a 
cocktail shuffle behind a sly, restrained vocal in this account of a decidedly 
strange visit with God. 
</P>
<P>
Off-center rockabilly clatter propels "Pads, Paws and Claws," a sketch of a 
real fun couple, while the stately Irish folk of "Tramp the Dirt Down" builds 
to scary intensity during a long litany of shame about Thatcher's Britain. In 
the courtroom narrative "Let Him Dangle," an anti-execution message is set 
against music that snaps and sways with vengeful glee, like a trap door 
springing and body swinging. 
</P>
<P>
The variety of the arrangements and themes encourages Costello's most versatile 
vocal performance yet. Whether tough, sure-footed, fast-paced deliveries or 
aching, underplayed confessionals, it's a commanding display. From a whisper to 
a scream, indeed. RICHARD CROMELIN

HOT COPY: The always unpredictable (dare we say erratic) ex-New York Dolls 
guitarist Johnny Thunders is back with a new album, teamed up with vocalist 
Patti Palladin. Called "Copy Cats," the record features a host of cover tunes, 
ranging from the Seeds' "Can't Seem to Make You Mine" and Roy Head's "Treat Her 
Right" to the Chamber Bros.' "Uptown to Harlem" and the Shirelles' "Baby It's 
You.". . .Our Album Title of the Week goes to folkie Cindy Lee Berryhill's 
upcoming, Lenny Kaye-produced album, which is titled "Naked Movie Star.". . . 
And Our Joke of the Week goes to Dr. Bubba from the Scott's Tissue tip-sheet 
whose rock predictions for 1989 include this highlight: "Roseanne Barr, the Fat 
Boys and Sam Kinnison will form a band called the Traveling Pillsburies."

ROLL THE VIDEOTAPE: Morton Downey Jr. always tackles the tough topics, so it 
comes as no surprise to hear that he's due to turn his toothy glare on . . . 
groupies! In a two-part show scheduled for Feb. 27 &amp; 28, Downey will 
harangue such pop luminaries as Pamela Des Barres, the recently married Ted 
Nugent, Dee Snyder and members of Ratt, Anthrax, the House of Lords and 
Christmas. . . . The new Joe Henry video marks the directorial debut of Sean 
Penn, who shot the clip last fall, using cinematographer Juan Ruiz Anchia (who 
shot Penn's film, "At Close Range") and donating his own Chevy Impala for key 
stunt scenes in the video. According to clip producer Pam Tarr, Penn's concept 
for the video was to "outline a destructive, unhappy relationship between Henry 
and a girl." Hhhmmmm! . . . Psychedelic hip-hop? For the freshest rap sound of 
the year, check out "3 Feet High and Rising," the new album from De La Soul, a 
trio of cheeky 19-year-old Long Islanders who've dubbed themselves "public 
speakers" (not rappers) and seem just as much influenced by Devo as by 
Parliament Funkadelic. (Of the group's two MC's, one is named Trugoy the Dove 
-- trugoy is yogurt backward -- while the other goes by Posdnuof, a moniker 
assembled from Pos -- an inverted acronym for Sire of the Phones -- and Dnouf, 
which is found spelled backward.) Out this week on Tommy Boy Records, De La 
Soul's album features 24 songs -- some full-length numbers, some game-show 
routines and some mini-raps the group calls "bug-out pieces." Using 
rhythm-track sampling from such unlikely sources as the Turtles, Steely Dan and 
children's multiplication records, the group offers such witty material as 
"Cool Breeze on the Rocks," "Trasnmitting Live From Mars," "The Magic Number," 
"Say No Go," "De La Orgee" and last year's cult hit, "Plug Tunin'."

It's hard to imagine anyone better equipped to celebrate the incandescent highs 
-- and the dreary lows -- of Southern California's hedonistic youth culture 
than Danny Sugerman. 
</P>
<P>
At age 12, after hitting a home run to win his Little League game, his umpire 
rewarded him by taking him to see the Doors. 
</P>
<P>
At 14, Sugerman was skipping school and working for the Doors, keeping tabs on 
the band's fan mail and getting drunk with Jim Morrison at the Whisky-a-Go-Go. 
</P>
<P>
At 19, he says he was popping Quaaludes and snorting heroin with his 
15-year-old girlfriend, getting so high he once drove his car off Mulholland 
Drive, crashing through someone's roof into their living room. 
</P>
<P>
Soon Sugerman was a loony Hipster from Hell with a $400-a-day heroin habit, a 
diseased liver and a cozy bed in a mental hospital. It took him nearly a decade 
-- and "probably 10" different detox stays -- before he finally kicked his 
habit. 
</P>
<P>
Co-author of the best-selling Jim Morrison biography, "No One Here Gets Out 
Alive," Sugerman has chronicled his rock adventures -- and his druggy 
misadventures -- in "Wonderland Avenue: Tales of Glamor and Excess," due out 
next month from William Morrow &amp; Co. Populated with celebrities (Morrison, 
Iggy Pop and MacKenzie Phillips) and scuzballs (scores of conniving drug 
dealers), it's a sobering, scarily exhilarating and often heartbreakingly sad 
account of a '60s teen rebel rocketing off into a self-destructive frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
At 34, Sugerman still has shoulder-length hair and an infectious boyish 
enthusiasm. Drinking coffee and smoking Kool Milds (his sole surviving vices) 
he sat at a favorite West Hollywood haunt, discussing the self-destructive 
allure of drugs, rock's Dyonesian power and his struggles to regain control of 
his life. 
</P>
<P>
"I always wanted to write this book. Whenever my girlfriend would get mad at me 
about something crazy I'd done, I'd say, 'Don't worry, this'll make great 
material for the book.' Once we were in the middle of this weird drug deal and 
had to dive out the second-story window of a house and roll under a car, scared 
out of our minds -- but still hanging onto our drugs -- and she said to me, 'I 
hope you're taking notes!' " 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody wanted to write the great coming-of-age rock 'n' roll novel. But I 
could never invent any characters better than Morrison and Iggy. If I couldn't 
improve on real life, I realized I should just tell the story about myself. It 
took me so long to kick drugs that I started writing -- it was the only thing I 
could do. Eventually I figured -- hey, rock 'n' roll and drug addiciton -- it's 
the one story I'm ideally qualified to tell. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the names are changed. (Laughter.) To protect the guilty. A couple of 
characters are composites. Instead of having four drug dealers, I'd roll them 
all into one. But there were so many of 'em. . . . At first, I tried a 
collaborator, but I had to build up my confidence so I could write it by 
myself. It wasn't like being afraid to jump. I'd already jumped. It was simply 
a matter of wondering what would happen to me when I'd land." 
</P>
<P>
"If rock was a religion, then drugs were the sacrament. Rock always had this 
tradition of self-destructiveness, just as there's the tradition of writers 
going crazy drinking, of Byron and Baudelaire taking their lives to excess. 
It's simple -- when I was a kid, everyone told me, 'Stop. Stop. STOP!' And Jim 
Morrison was the first person to say, 'Go. GO. GO!!!!' " 
</P>
<P>
"Until heroin, I'd never found a drug I liked. I hated acid. I wanted my 
consciousness restricted, not expanded. I wanted that false sense of 
well-being. But the reality was -- the drugs stopped working. No one I trusted 
had told me that. Nobody told me the consequences. I got off heroin onto 
methadone. And it took me 10 years to get off that. If I write a sequel, it'll 
be 'A Boy and His Drug.' (Laughter.) Or maybe 'A Consumer Guide to Detox.' I 
never had a vacation. Whenever I had a holiday, I went to detox. 
</P>
<P>
"After my first book came out, I had enough money to kill myself in style. I 
never told people I was an addict. I was just too ashamed. I bottomed out on 
self-loathing. It actually helped when I started admitting I was an addict. I'd 
just had this ice block inside me. Finally, I learned it wasn't something you 
could conquer with willpower. Drugs were just something you didn't do. Ever. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I'm in bed by 10 p.m. I take naps. I drink Evian water. But my health's 
OK. I didn't know getting old would be this nice. You know, I was afraid to 
finish the book. So many people I knew had died -- I was worried that God was 
only keeping me alive to write it. Now I feel better about myself. (He 
laughed.) Now I tell myself God at least wants to keep me alive long enough to 
promote it!"

The real issue is to what degree blacks are inclined to accept rock. There are 
literally hundreds of black groups. The fact that only a few play rock music is 
certainly due to preference, not racism.

The toxic waste that Jeff Koons' "work" represents is not merely a symptom of 
the troubled art world but also a cause. 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging him as an "artist," however ambiguously, with your Jan. 22 
article, "The Art World Is Ripe for Me," has aided his marketing and 
manipulation. Because he is such a media monger, the only antidote against the 
Koons disease is suppression of all his media coverage.

HIS DANDRUFF'S UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As president of the men's chapter of the Society for the Preservation of Big 
Hair in America (SPOBHIA), I was hard-pressed to control my disgust while 
reading Gregory Farmer's Jan. 15 letter, in which he complained he had to sit 
behind an "old thing with this antiquated beehive" at the movie theatre. 
</P>
<P>
I can see this man (sic) so clearly, sitting in theater, his hair greased and 
combed tight against his scalp, looking for some innocent minority to 
pigeonhole. 
</P>
<P>
Well, those of us with Hair Abundance won't stand silent before such rantings: 
</P>
<P>
I pile my hair with pride, Mr. Farmer, as does my family and 7,000 SPOBHIA 
members nationwide. Buy a VCR and stay home, you small-haired prig!

Watching stage critic Dan Sullivan and Mark Taper Forum executive Gordon 
Davison duke it out in The Times is like watching two white guys go one on one 
in basketball because they own the court (Sullivan's Jan. 8 "And a Humbug in a 
Pear Tree" and Davison's Jan. 22 letter). 
</P>
<P>
Come on, Calendar, aren't there any non-white reviewers on your staff? Does 
Kevin Thomas have to review every Japanese film? 
</P>
<P>
Come on, Gordon, are the only blacks on your staff the janitor and 
receptionist? Why the white-only practice regarding directors, i.e. "Green 
Card," "The Wash" and now "Sansei"? And "Dutch Landscape," which takes place in 
South Africa but deals with a white family from Malibu yet?

Come on, guys, stop being so self-righteous. You're a joke to all Third World 
Americans.

PAINT, THE MOST versatile and affordable decorating tool, can be used in 
traditional, contemporary, artful, whimsical or zany applications. Here's a 
comprehensive guide for those who may attempt their own decorative painting on 
walls, ceilings, woodwork or furniture. Each technique is clearly illustrated 
step-by-step in color photographs. What the authors call basic finishes -- 
sponging, mutton clothing, ragging, color washing, combing, spattering -- are 
dealt with first. Then comes information on more advanced techniques -- gesso, 
marbling, porphyry, granite, moire, tortoise shell, wood finishes, wood 
graining, and gold leaf. A glossary further explains terms and techniques.

TOWER ACCUSED OF RECENT INTOXICATION; FBI CHECKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. BRODER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In its renewed investigation of defense secretary nominee John Tower, the FBI 
is checking allegations that Tower was recently involved in an episode of 
public drunkenness, sources said Friday -- allegations that call into question 
his insistence that he has no current drinking problem. 
</P>
<P>
Tower testified in confirmation hearings earlier last week that his problems 
with alcohol are behind him. But a senior member of the Armed Services 
Committee said Friday that the allegation, if true, suggests that the former 
Texas senator's drinking problem "may be ongoing," and said his confirmation 
remains in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
The charge received Wednesday by the committee was very specific, giving the 
date and place of the alleged incident, and was made by an informant who 
identified herself, a knowledgeable source said. The episode allegedly occurred 
within the last year at the Monocle, a Capitol Hill restaurant frequented by 
lawmakers, lobbyists and congressional aides. 
</P>
<P>
Two other allegations under scrutiny by the FBI's special inquiries unit, which 
is working around the clock this weekend on the Tower matter, involve 
assertions of another incident of public intoxication and of a recent affair 
with an unidentified Dallas woman. 
</P>
<P>
If the new charges should be verified by the FBI, Tower's nomination is doomed, 
an authoritative committee source said. 
</P>
<P>
FBI agents spent two hours at the Monocle Friday, interviewing the owner, the 
maitre d', bartenders and waiters, The Times learned. The agents were told that 
Tower, when he was in the Senate, "used to drink martinis." 
</P>
<P>
But one source said no one on the staff could contradict Tower's statement that 
in recent years he has moderated his once-heavy drinking and now only drinks an 
occasional glass of wine. In fact, in recent weeks, the staff told agents, he 
often has ordered tonic water. 
</P>
<P>
None of the staff could recall any recent incident of improper behavior by 
Tower at the restaurant, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The Armed Services Committee was set on Thursday to approve the Tower 
nomination, but chairman Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) abruptly canceled the vote 
because of the new charges, which he referred immediately to FBI Director 
William Sessions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Extensive Investigation 
</P>
<P>
The bureau already had conducted an extensive background investigation of 
Tower, a 24-year Senate veteran who headed the Armed Services panel from 1981 
to 1985. The background check went over numerous allegations of personal 
impropriety as well as potential conflicts of interest involving Tower's work 
as a highly paid consultant to a several major defense contractors after 
leaving the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
When he nominated Tower, President Bush said he was "totally satisfied" with 
the FBI check. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn said he did not expect the latest FBI inquiry to be completed until at 
least Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Tower on Friday declined to comment, as he has throughout the confirmation 
inquiry. "I'm embargoed" until after the Senate votes, he said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
No date has been set for a resumption of confirmation hearings, but Virginia 
Sen. John W. Warner, the committee's ranking Republican, said Friday that GOP 
members would press for a vote next Tuesday or Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Some Tower supporters complained that committee Democrats were turning the 
confirmation process into a "circus" for partisan political reasons. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bush Stands Pat 
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that President Bush, who has 
stressed the need for ethical conduct by all of his appointees, is not 
considering withdrawing Tower's nomination. 
</P>
<P>
A senior White House staff member, who asked not to be identified, said 
Administration officials were getting impatient for Tower's confirmation to be 
completed. "Everybody kind of wants to get our Cabinet in," the aide said. 
</P>
<P>
House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin (D-Wis.) said that the 
controversy has already hobbled Tower's ability to lead the Pentagon 
effectively. 
</P>
<P>
And two influential defense industry trade magazines on Monday will call for 
Tower to withdraw from consideration for the Pentagon post. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Attacked in Editorial 
</P>
<P>
In an editorial prepared for Monday's issue, Defense News, a trade paper widely 
read by defense contractors and on Capitol Hill, says, "Withdrawal is necessary 
because the record of Mr. Tower's professional life raises substantive doubt 
that he can perform with utmost effectiveness at a time when defense priorities 
and the Defense Department each are undergoing periods of vital, but delicate, 
change." 
</P>
<P>
The paper describes Tower as "abrasive" and uninterested in reforming the 
troubled Pentagon acquisition system. It criticizes the former Texas senator as 
blind to the appearance of conflict of interest in having accepted more than $1 
million over the last three years from firms doing business with the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
Army Times, another prominent defense community publication, says Tower is 
unsuited for the Defense Department post because of his work as a consultant to 
defense contractors shortly after leaving government service in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
It said, "the speed and greed with which Tower spun through the revolving door 
is appalling." 
</P>
<P>
The charges against Tower "undeniably create the impression of a man much too 
cozy with the Pentagon's worst ways of doing business. Indeed, he is almost a 
caricature of how most people see the Defense Department, a kind of Mr. 
Military-Industrial Complex." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concerns Raised 
</P>
<P>
Tower's lucrative consulting work raised concerns among a number of members of 
the Armed Services Committee, but did not appear to threaten his nomination. 
</P>
<P>
Tower's personal conduct, however, became an issue in the hearings on Tuesday 
when conservative critic Paul Weyrich charged that the former senator was 
morally unfit for the post because of a history of drinking and womanizing. 
</P>
<P>
After a lengthy closed session in which Tower was allowed to respond to 
Weyrich's charges, Nunn asked the nominee publicly whether he had a problem 
with alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
"I have none, senator," Tower replied. "I am a man of some discipline." 
</P>
<P>
Tower, despite his confirmation troubles, met Friday with top aides and 
Pentagon officials to discuss the defense budget, transition officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Tower said the meeting had been scheduled for a week "and had 
nothing to do with the proceedings before the Senate Armed Services Committee." 
</P>

Times staff writers Ronald J. Ostrow, Robert L. Jackson, Melissa Healy and

GENERAL TAKES OVER IN PARAGUAY AFTER OUSTING PRESIDENT IN COUP

ASUNCION, Paraguay 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gen. Andres Rodriguez was sworn in as president Friday after ousting President 
Alfredo Stroessner in a coup that reportedly left scores dead. Rodriguez 
ordered the dictator out of the country he had ruled for 34 years. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez, who had been Stroessner's second-in-command in the army and whose 
daughter is married to Stroessner's son, took the oath of office and then swore 
in a nine-member Cabinet composed of seven civilians, an active general and a 
retired general. 
</P>
<P>
Paraguayans poured into the streets to celebrate the bloody military coup and 
to gape at damage left by hours of heavy fighting between rebel soldiers and 
police and troops loyal to Stroessner. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez was cheered by several thousand citizens as he took the oath of 
office and swore in a Cabinet. About 15,000 accompanied him to the Colorado 
Party headquarters and cheered again when he appointed Juan Ramon Chaves, 87, 
as party president, replacing pro-Stroessner militant Sabino Montonaro. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have a true democracy!" shouted Domingo Laino, president of the 
National Accord group of four opposition parties and Paraguay's best-known 
human rights advocate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Era at End 
</P>
<P>
"I think that the era of terrorism and corruption that affected our country for 
so long has come to an end, thanks to the armed forces," said Aldo Zuccolillo, 
publisher of ABC Color, the country's biggest newspaper at the time Stroessner 
closed it in 1984 for printing news the government didn't like. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez, however, said nothing about elections nor how long his provisional 
presidency would last. He spoke at his swearing-in ceremony and in a nationwide 
address hours earlier in which he declared he was "taking command of the 
country from this moment." 
</P>
<P>
Stroessner, 76, was put under house arrest at an army base. About 30 of his 
followers and aides were detained, and the hierarchy of the government and 
ruling Colorado Party were replaced. Sources said Rodriguez acted after being 
told to resign. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ordered Out of Country 
</P>
<P>
Stroessner, who was the Western Hemisphere's longest-ruling leader, was 
eventually ordered out of the country, and he was reportedly en route to 
Santiago, Chile. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in a khaki and green uniform and wearing the red, white and blue 
presidential sash, Rodriguez, 64, swore to uphold the presidency and observe 
the constitution during a short ceremony at the National Palace overlooking the 
Paraguay River. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Roadblocks Manned 
</P>
<P>
Sirens sounded for several minutes in the city and on boats anchored in the 
harbor. Armed soldiers manned roadblocks outside the building and at 
checkpoints throughout the city of 900,000. 
</P>
<P>
Between cars with tires shot flat, several large bloodstains dried in the 
oppressive heat. The gray, colonial-style police headquarters was pockmarked 
with bullet holes, its windows shattered. 
</P>
<P>
The death toll was uncertain. About a dozen bodies of soldiers loyal to 
Stroessner lay outside the headquarters of the presidential guard. 
</P>
<P>
Radio Caritas reported at least 18 soldiers dead and perhaps as many as 82 but 
gave no source. Earlier, Radio Caritas press director Benjamin Fernandez said 
the death toll "could be more than 100." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Civilians Died 
</P>
<P>
Laino estimated the death toll at about 100. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said witnesses 
reported that "many soldiers and a few civilians" died. He said there were no 
reports of injuries to the 1,800 Americans living in Paraguay. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats and political sources said shortly before the coup that Rodriguez 
apparently was ordered to give up his command of the elite First Army Corps and 
retire or accept the post of defense minister. He refused. 
</P>
<P>
The rebellion also followed a dispute within the Colorado Party between a 
militant pro-Stroessner faction and traditionalists who wanted to distance the 
100-year-old party from the aging dictator. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 5,000 people gathered in downtown Asuncion to cheer the ouster of 
Stroessner, who was accused of brutal repression and who allowed Nazis, ousted 
dictators and drug traffickers to take refuge in Paraguay. The list included 
Auschwitz death camp doctor Josef Mengele; the ousted Nicaraguan dictator, Gen. 
Anastasio Somoza Debayle; and heroin trafficker Joseph August Ricorde. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Police Stayed Away 
</P>
<P>
Police, who under Stroessner frequently used clubs, tear gas and electric 
cattle prods to break up such gatherings, stayed away. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if we're going to have democracy and liberty now, but we've taken 
the first step," said Humberto Rubin, owner of Radio Nanduti, forced to closed 
in 1987 for its criticism of the government. "Our fight has not been in vain." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy that this man (Stroessner) is gone for good, but I'm sad about the 
dead," said one young woman, who spent the night huddled in a restaurant near 
the police headquarters to avoid the street battles. 
</P>
<P>
Stroessner's arrest followed a night of gunfights and cannon fire in the 
capital's streets between rebel soldiers backed by tanks and mortars and forces 
loyal to Stroessner. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'They Opened Fire' 
</P>
<P>
A member of the presidential guard, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said 
"there was practically no battle. They didn't even ask us to surrender. They 
just opened fire and battered down the gates with small tanks." 
</P>
<P>
Radio Itapiru reported that 32 government officials, including Stroessner's 
longtime private secretary, Mario Abdo Benitez, were arrested and being held at 
a naval base. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday morning, Rodriguez addressed the nation on the radio in a clipped, 
authoritarian voice, saying order had been restored "and with it, all the human 
values of our entire constitution will be respected." 
</P>
<P>
"I communicate to you that Gen. Stroessner has surrendered and finds himself in 
perfect health, deprived of liberty, being shown all human rights, at a 
residence within the First Army Corps," he said.

CERVICAL CANCER VIRUS LINKED TO PROMISCUITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

CARACAS, Venezuela 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A study of women with radically different sex lives -- prostitutes and 
monogamous Indians -- has found new evidence linking promiscuity to 
transmission of a virus that can cause cervical cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Jose Azocar compared pap smear samples from the prostitutes with those of 
Piaroa women, part of a strictly monogamous group living in villages scattered 
in this South American nation's Amazon jungle. 
</P>
<P>
"With this study the relation between the HPV virus and cervical cancer is 
strengthened, as is the hypothesis that the mode of transmission is sexual," 
said Azocar, a virologist with the Venezuelan Scientific Research Institute. 
</P>
<P>
As early as the 1950s scientists observed that higher levels of cervical cancer 
seemed to be associated with promiscuity. A solid link between the human 
papilloma virus (HPV) and cervical cancer wasn't made until the early 1980s by 
Harald Zur Hausen of Germany and Ralph Richart of Columbia University. 
</P>
<P>
Using genetic engineering to manipulate infected DNA, they found that the 
viruses most related to cervical cancer were certain strains of HPV. Later 
research using genetic material from the viruses confirmed their results. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Azocar began a similar study using viral genetic material in cell 
samples from Caracas hospitals and found that nearly 80% of cervical cancers in 
Venezuela were associated with HPV. Cancer is the No. 2 killer in Venezuela, 
and cervical cancer is the most common form in women. 
</P>
<P>
"It is widely accepted among scientists that HPV causes cervical cancer, but it 
is thought that other factors are involved, including many births, early onset 
of sexual activity and promiscuity. I wanted to see to what point these other 
factors were involved," Azocar said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
Further study required control groups at the extremes of sexual activity. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to find a control group of monogamous people, and with the Piaroa 
the girls are married off for life as soon as they get their first period," 
Azocar said. "The only thing they required was that all the examinations be 
done by women gynecologists." 
</P>
<P>
Getting to the Piaroa, who had participated in an earlier AIDS study, was 
difficult. The 7,000-member tribe lives in an area the size of Austria roughly 
between the Parguaza River in southwest Bolivar State and the town of Tama-Tama 
in Amazonas Federal Territory. 
</P>
<P>
Most still live in villages of less than 100. They fish, hunt small animals and 
birds and cultivate tubers and bananas, as they have for hundreds of years. 
Those in less remote villages may have outboard motors for their canoes and 
wear Western-style clothes, but their limited exposure to modern society 
ensures that their monogamous life style is intact. 
</P>
<P>
Men of status may have two wives, but most have only one. There is no one from 
outside the village to fool around with, and tribal women are kicked out if 
they sleep with someone other than their husbands. 
</P>
<P>
Azocar and his colleagues were flown by army helicopter to three villages near 
the Parguaza River, 290 miles south of Caracas, where they took samples from 
125 women. No evidence of HPV or cervical cancer was found. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Promiscuous Group 
</P>
<P>
Examining a promiscuous group was easier. He conducted a two-month campaign 
among prostitutes in several cities nearest Piaroa territory for a cervical 
screening program and free treatment. Police helped spread the word. 
</P>
<P>
A team of gynecologists took pap smears from 130 prostitutes. Between 25% and 
40%, depending on the city they lived in, had HPV, and among these there was a 
high incidence of different grades of precancerous tumors. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Piaroa and prostitutes began having sex early, had multiple births, 
have similar blood lines, live in the same climate, eat similar foods and are 
exposed to roughly the same frontier-style living conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"We showed that women who had many children and who started sex at an early age 
didn't necessarily have HPV," Azocar said. "This provides solid data that 
cervical cancer is a sexually transmitted disease -- that the virus is the most 
important factor causing it and that promiscuity is the form of infection."

'THE BIRD STOPS HERE,' RESCUER SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
HIS HOBBY HATCHED A HOSPITAL FOR RAPTORS AND OTHER FEATHERED FRIENDS

<TEXT>
<P>
It is hard to say just when a man decides to turn his yard into a repair shop 
for wrecked birds. 
</P>
<P>
For Leonard Soucy, it probably happened 20 years ago, when someone left a 
red-tail hawk with a broken wing in a cardboard box on his front stoop. 
</P>
<P>
It was a challenge Soucy couldn't resist. He still can't. 
</P>
<P>
That is why his home is an intensive-care facility full of cages -- some the 
size of boxcars -- where he endeavors to restore to the wild sick and injured 
owls, hawks, eagles, falcons, songbirds -- and the occasional lame duck. 
</P>
<P>
In earthy terms appropriate to a pirate's parrot, Soucy tells how the birds 
have taken over his home, his bank account, his job and even his wife, Diane. 
</P>
<P>
"Birds have eaten me up. They've consumed my life." 
</P>
<P>
These are the birds who came to dinner, as it were. For their convalescence, 
Soucy buys 10,000 crickets a week from a Tennessee breeder, millions of 
grubworms from California, grasshoppers galore from Georgia and 150,000 rodents 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
"I have 10,000 mealworms here right now, and they're just snacks!" he said. 
"This cost $100,000 last year. If the food wasn't donated, it would have cost 
$250,000. Just one rat costs $2.50. A mouse is $1.09 . . . but I have to do it. 
No one else is going to." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Owls, Eagles, Hawks 
</P>
<P>
Soucy may have as many as 500 recovering birds at a time in his 100,000 cubic 
feet of cages. There's a barred owl on the mend from an entanglement with a 
kite string, a golden eagle with a broken wing, and hawks shot by what Soucy 
calls, with unprintable modifiers, "slobs." Orphaned birds are raised from 
infancy. An oriole must winter over because it did not recover until after the 
last flight south. 
</P>
<P>
Soucy still tries to sandwich his work as a self-employed tool-and-die pattern 
maker around a hobby that was once a Sopwith Camel and is now a B-52. This 
sometimes requires him to go to his paying job at 2 a.m. There are emergency 
calls at all hours. 
</P>
<P>
"A bird gets hit, falls out of the nest. It doesn't belong to the police. Not 
the dog warden. Doesn't belong to anybody. So they say 'Call Soucy.' " A 
screech owl flies down a chimney and catches fire. Call Soucy. A goshawk 
crashes through a picture window and lands, dazed, on a coffee table. Call 
Soucy. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nobody else to pass them to. The bird stops here." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Year for the Birds 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Soucy's busiest ever, 1,485 wild birds ended up on his doorstep. 
They included 240 raptors, the carnivores that are his specialty. About half 
the birds recovered and were returned to the wild. Repairs are not cheap. 
</P>
<P>
"To do an intramedullary fusion of a bird's wing bone with a pin can cost $400 
for the operation. Post-op care can approach $1,000." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Soucy has two understanding veterinarians nearby -- Dr. Andrew 
Major in Plainfield and Dr. Ken Jacobsen in Basking Ridge -- who donate their 
surgical services. 
</P>
<P>
"We can keep a bird alive 90% of the time, but can we restore it 100%? The bird 
won't make it in the wild if it's only 75%, so we keep about 100 for 
educational lectures at schools and such, and euthanize the rest." 
</P>
<P>
Soucy's preoccupation with raptors is evolutionary. He was born in Cedar Grove, 
N. J., 57 years ago when it had some open land and nothing like the 40,000 
people who pack it today. He learned about nature from an uncle who was a 
hunter -- a species with whom Soucy has no quarrel, despite the many 
gunshot-maimed birds he's treated. 
</P>
<P>
"No competent, moral hunter will shoot hawks and owls. The (bleeping) slobs 
do." 
</P>
<P>
His interest was piqued years ago when he read an article on hawks in Audubon 
magazine. He and Diane went out to Hawk Mountain in eastern Pennsylvania to see 
the migration of autumn, when thousands of raptors may fly by in a day, riding 
the thermals south. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't imagine 1,000 hawks in the whole world, much less overhead." 
</P>
<P>
Gunners used to shoot hundreds of birds in a day at Hawk Mountain, just for 
target practice. This was ended in 1934, when Rosalie Edge, a wealthy New 
Yorker, bought the mountain and made it a refuge for the birds and bird 
watchers. Cape May, an even bigger migration junction at the southern tip of 
New Jersey, was also a hunting ground, but this stopped when the federal 
government outlawed shooting of raptors in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
By then, Soucy and Diane had been in the bird-repair business 4 years. They had 
rehabilitated that first red-tail and released it. One thing led to another. 
They bought a house in the country next to the Great Swamp Wildlife Refuge 
here. It all started as a back yard hobby, a way of righting some of the wrongs 
committed by the most deadly predator of them all, man. 
</P>
<P>
"The stupidity of man not doing better gradually enraged me. All things on 
Earth are valuable to us because they help stabilize the darn thing. I was 
raised to think man owned the world. We've got to get out of this idea, because 
we're a part of it. It's all our world. We've got to take care of Momma Earth." 
</P>
<P>
He had no illusions about it being easy. 
</P>
<P>
"Historically, this country has a love-hate relationship with raptors. We put 
the bald eagle on our national seal, but there used to be a bounty on them. 
People don't care if a robin kills a worm, but it's what's being killed that 
matters. A fox that kills a chicken is a bad fox. If it kills a snake, it's a 
good fox. To hunters, a hawk that killed a rabbit was a bad thing, so they 
killed the hawk, and then the rabbit. Farmers thought raptors were vermin, but 
very, very, very few hawks will kill chickens . . . but that's a hard sell." 
</P>
<P>
Soucy accepts raptors for what they are, meat-eaters in nature's scheme, just 
like the folks at Burger King. 
</P>
<P>
"Raptors are truly remarkable animals. An owl can see a lighted match a 
half-mile away. A hawk 2 miles up can see a rabbit and know it's a rabbit. They 
probably have the best eyesight in the whole world." He admires the birds for 
trying to adapt to a world not of nature's making. 
</P>
<P>
As Soucy's reputation grew, so did the number of cages out back. He is a 
realist, however. He will not turn away a tearful youngster who shows up with a 
young phoebe that has fallen out of the nest, but his eye cannot be on every 
sparrow. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously," he said, "there are limits." 
</P>
<P>
He and Diane learned as they went along, designing cages and treating their 
patients so as not to make permanent welfare cases of them. There have been 
triumphs. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1982, which happened to be the national year of the bald eagle, one of them 
fell out of the sky. It ended up here. I took it to Bill Hobby, a local vet, 
and he got an IV into the bird. He found it had too much mercury in its blood. 
Six weeks later, we flew him down to Chesapeake Bay in a donated Learjet with 
an NBC-TV crew, and returned a healthy eagle to the sky." 
</P>
<P>
In time, the big birds began running into big money. "It costs $175 to 
air-freight a recovered osprey down to Florida after migrating season. I've 
shipped ferruginous hawks to Arizona. When it looked like Diane was going down 
in a heap and I couldn't afford it anymore, a friend said we should 
incorporate." 
</P>
<P>
They are now The Raptor Trust, eligible for tax-exempt donations. A local 
lumber company donates wood for cages. AT&amp;T, which has huge office 
complexes in the area, gave $7,000 for a new cage. In summer, the Soucys have 
five full-time staffers and 25 volunteers. Their hobby has become one of the 10 
biggest-bird recovery operations in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"We took a 5-day vacation this year, the first in 16 years. I hired Jean Stamy, 
an ex-teacher, to show school groups around. I told her she'd work harder and 
be paid less if she came to me. I kept my promise. 
</P>
<P>
"The reality is, how big can we get? We don't charge for our services -- to 
whom do you send a bill? So we have to beg. That's what I've become, a beggar." 
</P>
<P>
Soucy has raised $185,000 to buy the property next door for more space and an 
educational center. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to think we're setting an example. In the last 20 years, Americans have 
gone back to being more intolerant of nature, gone back to their computers and 
Porsches. If they had more sympathy for the planet that sustains us, maybe they 
wouldn't puke on their world so much. 
</P>
<P>
"I figure I've put 100,000 hours into all this, and I've never taken a dime 
out," said Soucy, strolling among the cages under the penetrating stares of his 
patients.

NEPALESE ANTHROPOLOGIST DISILLUSIONED; 
</P>
<P>
WEST SEEN AS HAVING LITTLE TO OFFER

<TEXT>
<P>
Nepalese anthropologist Rajendra Pradhan believes the developing world has 
little reason to copy Western culture, which he studied extensively during two 
years of living in the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
Born in the Himalayas and a resident of India, Pradhan says he is one of the 
first anthropologists from a developing country to study the West in the same 
way that Western anthropologists have studied Third World society for decades 
-- by living with the natives. 
</P>
<P>
He came here as part of a Dutch government-sponsored project to allow India to 
study how the Dutch welfare state takes care of its elderly and see what India 
can learn from it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Visit Not Very Relevant 
</P>
<P>
"I doubt whether my stay here was as relevant for Indian policy-making as Dutch 
officials hoped it would be," he said, noting that India could probably never 
afford the Dutch welfare state and should be wary about imitating it. 
</P>
<P>
"India and Nepal have long been brainwashed by the idea that modernization 
equals Westernization. . . . But we are realizing more and more that that idea 
is perhaps wrong," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that in 20 years India would have problems caring for the elderly as 
more people move to cities, where cramped quarters and changing social habits 
erode traditions of the extended family. 
</P>
<P>
"At the moment (in India), parents who live separately from their children are 
still exceptions. But there will be more," Pradhan said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Elderly Kept at Bay 
</P>
<P>
But the privacy-minded Dutch welfare state, in which the elderly receive 
generous state welfare but are often kept at bay by their children, does not 
seem to provide the answer to that problem, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"In India, you always talk to other people, even in the street. Here, 
everything happens indoors. Old people are often very lonely because of that." 
</P>
<P>
Pradhan came to Amsterdam in early 1987 to learn Dutch. He moved to 
Schoonrewoerd, a village of 1,500 less than an hour south of the capital, where 
he lived for about a year. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many contradictions here. People claim they're all equal, but 
they aren't," Pradhan, 34, said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Free but Selfish 
</P>
<P>
"People are more independent, but only at the expense of relying more on the 
state. People have more freedom but tend to be more selfish," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He went to church services to get to know the villagers, who are split into two 
separate Protestant sects. 
</P>
<P>
"In India, people live face to face. They communicate with each other, and they 
fight each other. Here, people live back to back. There is peace but no 
contact," he said. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday mornings, he prayed with the Protestants, conservatives who split 
from the mainstream Netherlands Reformed Church last century. In the afternoon, 
he went to a service with the Reformed Unionists, an even more stern group. 
</P>
<P>
"Western anthropologists often offend people by being rude, like making notes 
during religious services. . . . I always prayed during service here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Some villagers first thought I was the new vicar. Others thought I came from 
Africa," he said. "When I said I was an anthropologist, it didn't mean much to 
them, but when I said I was a student or a trainee, they could place me." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Each to His Own Circle 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone had his own circle, even young people. . . . When you asked them if 
they knew someone from the other church, they said they didn't. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't belong to one of the churches, it is difficult to belong at all. 
. . . They read different newspapers and they have separate schools. Every 
church has its own Bible club, women's coffee club and youth clubs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, some villages like this one even had separate bakery shops, 
butchers and grocery stores," Pradhan said. 
</P>
<P>
Although aware that he was studying an unusually conservative village, he still 
played down differences between towns and villages. "Towns seem open and 
spontaneous, but that is often only an appearance," Pradhan said. 
</P>
<P>
"At large, religious parties in Nepal, everybody participates and each has his 
own task. . . . At parties in Amsterdam, they only invite people who think 
alike." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Recalls Apartheid 
</P>
<P>
It reminded him of apartheid, South Africa's system of racial segregation set 
up by Dutch-descended Afrikaners. 
</P>
<P>
"Apartheid is a Dutch word . . . what is different has to be separate. You can 
see it in the neat arrangements of the houses here. Photographs of the children 
are displayed separately from those of the elderly. Everything has to have its 
place." 
</P>
<P>
People were friendly but formal, he said, noting their habit of leaving the 
curtains of the living room open in the evening created a deceptive image of 
openness. 
</P>
<P>
"I always felt that, whenever I was on a visit, there were unspoken limits as 
to how long I could stay and the sort of things I could ask. . . . People never 
talked about sex or money but a lot about the weather," Pradhan said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Personal Bonds 'Fragile'

"Here, you can always choose not to have relationships. Personal bonds are more 
fragile. . . . Perhaps there is too much privacy," he said, adding that he left 
with a feeling that he had not learned all he wanted about Dutch society.

SINGAPORE OFFICIALS FEAR POPULATION PLUNGE IN CHINESE ZODIAC'S YEAR OF THE 
SNAKE

With the Year of the Snake approaching with the lunar new year, officials 
worried about a population plunge are emphasizing that many of history's finest 
were born under the sign of the slithery reptile. 
</P>
<P>
"Snakes make great people," pleads Health Minister Yeo Cheow Tong to Chinese 
couples reluctant to start a family in a less than auspicious astrological 
period. 
</P>
<P>
Hospitals that brimmed over with babies during the outgoing Dragon year -- with 
its portents of wealth and prosperity -- are preparing for empty beds in Snake 
year. Stores are stocking less maternity and infant clothing. 
</P>
<P>
For 1,000 years Chinese astrology has revolved around 12 mythical or real 
animals, each conveying personality and character traits to those born within 
its 12-month cycle. Depending upon the year of birth, a newborn is either an 
ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, goat or sheep, monkey, rooster, dog, 
pig or rat. 
</P>
<P>
The snake ranks among the least desirable. Snake babies are thought to produce 
adults equated with double-dealing, scandal and disreputable behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"Many still believe the zodiac is not a bunch of mumbo jumbo," said Paul Wee, 
who would like to become a father but perhaps not in the Year of the Snake. 
</P>
<P>
During the last Year of the Snake in 1977, births declined by 12%. 
</P>
<P>
"There are great people born under every one of the zodiac signs," said Yeo, 
whose population planners fear that a badly needed baby boom is about to 
fizzle. 
</P>
<P>
"The world would be a sadder and poorer place if the capable were born only 
once every 12 years." 
</P>
<P>
He said snake babies include U.S. Presidents John F. Kennedy and Abraham 
Lincoln, the late Chinese leader Mao Tse-tung, Singapore's Deputy Prime 
Minister Goh Chok Tong and Chief Justice Wee Chong Jin. 
</P>
<P>
Singapore needs five years matching 1988's 50,000 births to reverse a shrinking 
population. If a lower birth rate resumes, officials predict that the current 
population of 2.6 million will start shrinking precariously in the year 2010 
and nose-dive thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
"We must change our thinking," said Yeo. "We should not consider the other 
zodiac signs as being less favorable than the dragon." 
</P>
<P>
So elaborate ceremonies welcoming snake year were planned for the start of the 
lunar new year on Monday, Feb. 6. The Singapore River is to be transformed into 
a carnival with fireworks and giant lotus flowers spraying colorful water jets. 
There will be a display of 600 snakes, including such rarities as the white 
cobra, double-headed versions, gold-ringed, bamboo and water species. 
</P>
<P>
Government matchmakers touting the joys of matrimony and progeny are stressing 
the positive aspects of the snake personality. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Chan, deputy director of the Social Development Unit, said snake types 
often make their way to the top, ensure that they are in the right place at the 
right time and demonstrate an aptitude for research and academics. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just going to forge ahead in our programs" encouraging singles to marry 
and start families, Chan said.

EMPEROR OF THE MOSSI TRIBE; 
</P>
<P>
IN BURKINA FASO, MOGHO NABA LIVES ON

<TEXT>
<P>
Every Friday at dawn, a crowd gathers outside a dilapidated palace here in 
Burkina Faso's capital to attend a ritual faithfully repeated for centuries. 
</P>
<P>
The ceremony involves traditional chiefs bearing the title of "Ministers," a 
lavishly-bedecked stallion and a mighty monarch called the Mogho Naba, or 
emperor of the Mossi tribe. 
</P>
<P>
His great influence over local chieftains has survived French colonial rule and 
even the revolution initiated since 1983 by left-wing soldiers in this West 
African state. 
</P>
<P>
The Mossi, Burkina Faso's majority tribe, built one of the oldest and most 
prestigious kingdoms of West Africa, dating back to the 12th Century. 
</P>
<P>
The ritual derives from an old legend that each week the emperor asks for a 
horse to be prepared to fetch his favorite wife who has gone up-country to 
visit her father. 
</P>
<P>
The brief ceremony, which allows a rare sight of the Mogho Naba, flanked by 
pages and young girls, ends when the saddled horse is taken back inside the 
walled compound, banned to visitors. 
</P>
<P>
Nobles wearing richly embroidered caps, court drummers and minstrels seated in 
the dust at a respectful distance from the scarlet-robed Mogho Naba burst into 
applause when two shots are fired from a musket. 
</P>
<P>
The emperor, revered as "the Rising Sun" by the Mossi people, is assisted by a 
court made up of Naba (chiefs, in the More language). They include the Gouaga 
Naba, head of the imperial infantry, and the Kamsogho Naba, the chief eunuch in 
charge of the harem. 
</P>
<P>
So-called ministers in flowing robes -- traders, dentists or teachers in 
private life -- arrive at the Friday ceremony in battered cars, on mopeds or 
even bicycles to pay allegiance to the Mogho Naba, a burly man in his early 30s 
and the 37th emperor of the Mossi. 
</P>
<P>
Regarded as a semi-god by his people, he cannot be addressed directly and 
speaks through the Widi Naba (literally the commander of the imperial cavalry) 
and his de facto prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
Mossi warriors fought French army columns with spears and poisoned arrows until 
the then-Mogho Naba fled into exile into neighboring Ghana in 1897. 
</P>
<P>
But his successors retained considerable influence over peasants, who make up 
90% of the population. 
</P>
<P>
Relations between the chieftaincy and the government of independent Burkina 
Faso, formerly Upper Volta, deteriorated sharply after radical president Thomas 
Sankara came to power in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
He tried to break the powers of elders and chiefs, regarded by him as feudal 
lords keeping the peasants in slavery. He antagonized them by giving extensive 
power to grass-roots militia. 
</P>
<P>
The government also stopped paying part of the Mogho Naba's expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Sankara was slain in October, 1987, by fellow officers. "The late president 
humiliated the Mogho Naba and local chiefs by denying them all consideration. 
Today, his successors are trying with some success to win back their hearts," 
an Ouagadougou-based diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
"Sankara waged an unnecessary battle against the traditional chiefs. One cannot 
make a revolution against them in Africa," President Blaise Compaore 
acknowledged in a recent interview.

PRINCETON SCIENTISTS DREAMING OF SPACE CITIES BUILT WITH MOON ROCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In an office set in central New Jersey's farmland, researchers are drawing 
blueprints for space communities built from moon rock and powered by huge solar 
satellites. 
</P>
<P>
It may sound like science fiction, but Gregg Maryniak says such dreams could 
become reality at the start of the next century. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to change from thinking of space as a void to thinking of it as a 
font of energy and material resources that makes it a good place for people," 
says Maryniak, executive vice president of the Space Studies Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Maryniak and Gerard K. O'Neill, a nuclear physicist and professor emeritus at 
Princeton University who founded the institute in 1977, are among those driven 
by the belief that man is rapidly consuming the Earth's natural resources and 
making it uninhabitable with pollution and garbage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
See Solution in Space 
</P>
<P>
They believe new energy sources could be developed in space. 
</P>
<P>
"I see this kind of activity as one of the few bright rays of hope in a 
situation that otherwise appears to be hopeless," Maryniak said in an interview 
at the institute, which is housed at a former rocket engine plant. 
</P>
<P>
Since it's too expensive to carry materials into space, scientists must develop 
construction materials that are already available there, he said. The closest 
source is the moon. 
</P>
<P>
The private, nonprofit institute already has developed three prototypes of a 
"mass driver" -- a machine used to launch baseball-size fragments of mined moon 
rock to a central collection place in space. Maryniak describes the collection 
spot as a "celestial catcher's mitt." 
</P>
<P>
He says moon rock, composed mainly of oxygen, silicon and metals, can be broken 
into building materials and fuel using solar energy. 
</P>
<P>
The latest mass driver is a tube 1 1/2 feet wide and 500 feet long that propels 
material into space at a rate of 1 1/2 miles per second. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Turning Out Electricity 
</P>
<P>
The moon rock could be used to build solar power satellites that would collect 
sunlight, convert it to electricity and beam it to Earth. 
</P>
<P>
Such satellites, up to 5 miles long and 1 1/2 miles wide, could produce as much 
electricity as three or four nuclear reactors and provide all the energy needs 
of a city the size of New York or Chicago, Maryniak says. 
</P>
<P>
Totally self-sufficient space cities could be built with agricultural areas, 
controlled atmosphere, water supplies and gravitational field. Such cities 
would house tens of thousands of people and have trees, rivers and birds. 
</P>
<P>
Ivan Bekey, special assistant at the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration's office of exploration in Washington, said the institute's 
projects are possible but probably won't be reality for 20 to 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
Maryniak said people will choose to live in space because of the clean 
environment, greater security and the possibility of customizing cities to fit 
specific needs. 
</P>
<P>
"At first . . . they are going to be in places where the inhabitants are real 
pioneers," he said. "The second generation of people will think it's very 
normal and won't be particularly interested in going back to see old Mother 
Earth." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Search for Lunar Ice 
</P>
<P>
Maryniak said the first step probably will be much smaller, and could come in 
three years. Plans are under way to send a prospecting capsule to the moon to 
determine whether there is ice at the poles. Finding water would be a major 
breakthrough because it is needed for life and rocket fuel. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neill worked with NASA in the mid-1970s to study the feasibility of space 
colonies, Maryniak said. The space agency also considered solar generators 
during the Arab oil embargo but abandoned them as too costly. 
</P>
<P>
Maryniak said a solar generator can be built from moon rock at a fraction of 
the cost of building one with materials shipped from Earth. 
</P>
<P>
In December, Maryniak traveled to the Soviet Union and signed an agreement with 
the Moscow Aviation Institute, the country's leading aerospace training 
institution, to perform joint research on the effects of gravity, energy 
transmission and a lunar probe.

MIDSHIPMEN'S CLUB AIDS RACE RELATIONS, TEACHES BLACK CULTURE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Midshipman 1st Class John Duvall III recalled the time his roommate asked him 
why he wore a do-rag to bed at night. 
</P>
<P>
"I explained to him that black men use it, that you can tie it up and it holds 
your hair down, keeps the ends down," Duvall said of his old cloth headwrap. 
Duvall is black and his roommate is white. "Now he wears one." 
</P>
<P>
Conversations about black culture, concerts by soul musical groups and 
observances honoring Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. are increasingly becoming a 
part of the U.S. Naval Academy experience, almost as much as the military balls 
and classical performances by the glee club. 
</P>
<P>
The change is partly because of an increase in the number of black midshipmen 
from about a dozen 20 years ago to a high of 250 this year in the 4,500-member 
brigade. But another factor has been the Midshipmen's Black Studies Club, about 
216 black midshipmen and a few whites, who said they have taken on the teaching 
of black history and culture as a crusade. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Began 1 Years Ago 
</P>
<P>
The club was founded by black midshipmen 14 years ago. Such a black 
organization had not existed before because there were not enough black 
midshipmen to form one, said Samuel P. Massie, a chemistry professor who became 
the first black faculty member in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
In its early years, the club's purpose was to provide social alternatives to 
academy functions, members and faculty said. But in the last three years, the 
club's focus has changed. It now offers the entire brigade glimpses of black 
culture, such as song, dance and tribal history, to supplement the two courses 
the academy teaches, black literature and black-white relations. 
</P>
<P>
"We teach midshipmen about black contributions, male and female, past and 
present, and their positive effect on life in America," said Midshipman 1st 
Class Dondi Edwards, the club's president. 
</P>
<P>
Club members, however, do not just stick to textbook history. They have been 
called on by other midshipmen to explain the phenomenon of comedian Eddie 
Murphy, the logistics of the Cabbage Patch (a popular dance) and the secrets of 
fashionable dressing as well. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aid in Acceptance 
</P>
<P>
Some midshipmen say the club events have helped black and white midshipmen 
accept one another. At the academy, which produces the cream of the Navy and 
the Marines' officers and technical experts, fitting in is sometimes as high a 
priority as passing the 40-minute swimming test, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, in this arena where performance and rank determine power, success is 
often measured by classmates' and officers' impressions. 
</P>
<P>
Take Midshipman 1st Class Joseph Smith, who graduated from a prominent 
Shreveport, La., school for high achievers. 
</P>
<P>
He came to the academy with a 4.3 high-school grade-point average and his 
"father's arrogance," he said. But his first remembrance on arriving four years 
ago was being the only black person on the bus. That feeling of isolation 
sometimes continued in classes and activities, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have 100 marbles and 95 are clear and five are black, you're going to 
notice the black ones," he said. "If he is an outstanding performer or if he is 
a poor performer, he's going to stand out. That's the difference." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Comment on Welfare 
</P>
<P>
Smith said feelings of being different show up anywhere, even in friendly 
discussions among friends of other races. 
</P>
<P>
"We were discussing welfare reform," Smith recalled. "I remember somebody 
making a comment: 'Well, why don't they just go out and get jobs?' 
</P>
<P>
"Well, my family's been on welfare before. So I understand everyone on welfare 
is not some lazy bum who's sitting around collecting a check because he doesn't 
want to work. It bothered me that they would think that." 
</P>
<P>
The Black Studies Club does not limit its activities to the academy. It has 
been praised by black community leaders and city officials for its work with 
black youths. 
</P>
<P>
Club members tutor students from public housing in math and science, the 
midshipmen's best subjects. They sing as part of the U.S. Naval Academy Gospel 
Choir at area colleges and along the East Coast. They serve as ushers and 
escorts for civic social functions. And they have become a growing source of 
support in Annapolis' network of black churches. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Models for Black Youths 
</P>
<P>
The black midshipmen say they want to serve as models for the city's black 
youths at a time when the number of black teen-agers arrested for involvement 
in illegal drug activity is rising. 
</P>
<P>
"Those midshipmen are examples of something attainable. It's right within 
reach," said Bertina Nick, head of Energizing Self and Community, a civic 
organization that promotes black youth achievement. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to reach out to the youth," said Edwards, who grew up in a Philadelphia 
housing project. His mother borrowed money to send him to private schools. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to show them that the only difference between them and us is we've had 
. . . opportunities, and we wear the uniform here at the academy because we've 
had those opportunities," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Black Studies Club is the only such group at the nation's military service 
academies and provides support that the midshipmen cannot get anywhere else, 
said Lt. Cmdr. Ruby Miller. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives them a sense of direction," said Miller, who oversees the club's 
activities. "A lot of times people tend to be quiet, withdrawn. Not these 
guys." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Help With Test Preparation 
</P>
<P>
The black midshipmen are drawn to each other by their shared backgrounds and 
stick together to increase black attendance at the academy, club members said. 
Every Saturday, club members recruit minority students by phone from the 
admissions office, and they help each other prepare for academic and physical 
examinations. 
</P>
<P>
Club members -- black and white -- say participating in the group's functions 
has changed their attitudes about racism and cultural differences. 
</P>
<P>
"Before I came to the academy, I didn't know that many black people that well," 
said Midshipman 1st Class Christopher Thomas, 22. "This is the first time I've 
ever been interested in their backgrounds, be it African stuff or where they 
live . . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, who grew up in Potomac, Md., became one of the club's few white members 
two years ago and regularly tutors black students. He said he considers the 
club activities a part of his training. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of my sailors are going to be black," he said. "It will give me a chance 
to know about the people I'll be leading."

MARIE SYRKIN; AUTHOR, VETERAN; 
</P>
<P>
U.S. ZIONIST MOVEMENT LEADER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marie Syrkin, an author and for five decades a leader in the American Zionist 
movement, is dead at age 89. Miss Syrkin, a native of Berne, Switzerland, died 
Wednesday at St. John's Medical Center in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
After graduating from Cornell University, she taught in the New York public 
school system for 25 years, and wrote her first book, "Your School, Your 
Children." In 1950, she joined the faculty at Brandeis University, staying 
there until retirement in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
Her book, "Blessed Is the Match," includes interviews with several Holocaust 
survivors and is believed to be the first work in English about Jewish 
resistance under the Nazis. "Golda Meir: A Biography," released in 1969, was 
based on her friendship with the Israeli prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
She also wrote "Nachman Syrkin: A Memoir," a book dedicated to her mother; 
"Gleanings: A Diary in Verse;" and her most recent work, "The State of the 
Jews," released in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
As a journalist, Miss Syrkin helped found and edit The Jewish Frontier, was 
editor of the Herzl Press, and was on the editorial boards of Midstream and 
Middle East Review. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s, she served on the World Zionist Executive as the American 
representative of the Labor Party. For five years, she served as honorary 
president of the Labor Zionist movement in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Golda Meir once called her "one of the very best and most eloquent, thorough 
and lucid interpreters of Zionism and Israel." 
</P>
<P>
Miss Syrkin moved to Santa Monica in 1976 after the death of her husband, poet 
Charles Reznikoff.

ACTOR WILLIAM FORREST, 86; PLAYED IN 200 MOVIES, TV'S 'RIN TIN TIN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
William Forrest, the immaculately groomed, stern but pleasant military officer 
in a series of World War II films who appeared in almost 200 pictures over 30 
years, has died in Santa Monica. Forrest, whose final appearance was believed 
to have been in "The Marriage of a Young Stockbroker" in 1971, was 86. He died 
last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Forrest was a star athlete at Princeton University who started acting at 
Pasadena Playhouse in 1938. His first film credits came in 1940, when he made 
"Lone Wolf Meets a Lady" and three other pictures. 
</P>
<P>
For many years he averaged five or more films a year. The sophisticated 
character actor usually was cast in various positions of authority or as second 
romantic leads in such pictures as "Here Comes Mr. Jordan," "Life Begins for 
Andy Hardy," "Meet John Doe," "Sun Valley Serenade," "They Died With Their 
Boots On," "Laura," "Wilson" and "Anchors Aweigh." 
</P>
<P>
Others were "The Jolson Story," "Till the Clouds Roll By," "Miracle on 34th 
Street," "Fort Apache," "Dead Reckoning," "The Story of Will Rogers," "The 
Eddie Cantor Story," "Court Martial of Billy Mitchell" and dozens more. 
</P>
<P>
On television he was seen as the fort commander on "The Adventures of Rin Tin 
Tin," the 1954-59 series. He is survived by his wife, Wilhelmina, two sons, a 
daughter and four grandchildren.

PROSECUTOR GIVES MOB-BUSTING TIPS TO SOVIETS

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was perestroika, more or less, that brought Vladimir Kikilo to U.S. Atty. 
Rudolph W. Giuliani in search of government secrets. 
</P>
<P>
Back in the U.S.S.R., one expression of the new entrepreneurial spirit is a 
wave of bribery, extortion and other organized crime. Soviet mobsters throw 
lavish funerals and use the chain saw as a persuasive device, just like their 
American counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
Late last summer, the Moscow headquarters of Tass, the Soviet government news 
agency, asked its New York bureau to write a long report about how the U.S. 
government is fighting organized crime. Kikilo drew the assignment. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to start from the scratch, as you say," he said in an interview at Tass' 
office in Rockefeller Center. 
</P>
<P>
He knew enough to realize that he should interview Giuliani, who successfully 
prosecuted the leaders of New York's Mafia families as well as members of the 
"Pizza Connection" heroin-smuggling conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Has Difficulty Connecting 
</P>
<P>
But Giuliani works for the same Justice Department that keeps an eye on Kikilo 
and his colleagues, and for a while it seemed Kikilo was destined to be the 
only reporter in New York never to have gotten a word with the voluble 
mob-buster. 
</P>
<P>
Kikilo, 36, called Giuliani's office for an interview and, after it was learned 
who was calling, was referred to Justice Department headquarters in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
There, his calls were passed from office to office. Finally, someone told him 
Giuliani -- who appears on off-hours cable TV shows and lingers long after news 
conferences to do interviews with college radio stations -- would not be able 
to see him for months, if ever. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kikilo had been reading a book on the Pizza Connection case by New 
York Times reporter Ralph Blumenthal. One night, while driving home, Kikilo 
heard Blumenthal plugging his book on the radio. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sets Up Interview 
</P>
<P>
The next day he called Blumenthal, who discussed the case with him -- and 
helped set up an interview with Giuliani. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his misgivings, Kikilo found the shirt-sleeved Giuliani to be friendly, 
candid and helpful. Although the newsman pronounced the interview "a real 
scoop," the prosecutor did not tell him anything he has not been telling anyone 
else with a pencil or tape recorder for the last six years. 
</P>
<P>
"First, before you prosecute, you have to gather intelligence," Giuliani 
explained. "You try to develop informants, people within the organization 
willing to tell you how it functions. They can tell you the weak points, the 
legitimate people who are victimized -- that's the way you start." 
</P>
<P>
Over the next 45 minutes Giuliani went on to spill the rest of the beans, how 
to seize mob property, tell a boss from an underboss, etc. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Use the Tools 
</P>
<P>
Such tactics are of more than academic interest to Soviet authorities. In 
national security matters, they enjoy investigatory powers that can safely be 
described as broad. But they cannot prosecute an entire organized crime group 
or use videotapes as criminal evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Kikilo said it might be good if Giuliani spoke directly with Soviet 
prosecutors. "I think it could be an excellent thing to talk about," Giuliani 
said. If he did so, however, it would have to be as a private citizen: Giuliani 
resigned last week, amid speculation that he may soon challenge Mayor Edward 
Koch. 
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by Blumenthal, Kikilo also visited Knickerbocker Avenue in 
Brooklyn, an area that had been the turf of some Pizza Connection Mafiosi. 
Kikilo, however, couldn't understand why anyone would frequent such a shabby 
area. He was particularly struck by the sight of a pothole big enough to 
accommodate two large trash cans. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I realized the Mafia is reluctant to demonstrate their riches." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Views Murder Scene 
</P>
<P>
He walked into what once was Joe and Mary's restaurant, where mobster Carmine 
Galante was gunned down in 1979 while eating lunch. Although the place is now a 
Chinese restaurant, Kikilo was able to get a look at the courtyard out back 
where Galante died, a cigar still clenched in his teeth. 
</P>
<P>
"You feel some excitement," he said, his face becoming animated. "You can read 
about it, but when you actually see it, you start to grasp a little bit of 
something you need for the story." 
</P>
<P>
But Kikilo's piece is not primarily atmospheric, dealing as it must with the 
finer points of Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control Act of 1968 and the 
Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act of 1970. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clutter Lingers On 
</P>
<P>
The article is finished -- all 10,000 words of it -- but his desk still looks 
like a mob reporter's. There is a Mafia family organization chart tacked on the 
wall; three huge volumes of background from Robert Blakey, a Notre Dame expert 
on organized crime; videotapes of mob TV programs; an old U.S. Information 
Agency folder bulging with yellowing newspaper clips. 
</P>
<P>
Kikilo also has a gift from one of Giuliani's assistants -- a computer printout 
of the disposition of each defendant in the Pizza Connection trial, one of the 
longest and most complicated in American history. 
</P>
<P>
"This was my savior," he said.

ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OPINION PLACES LAWNDALE'S GENERAL PLAN IN DOUBT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA BAIRD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lawndale will soon have to contend with the "very significant legal 
implications" of a recent state attorney general's opinion that raises 
questions about the adoption of the city's General Plan, City Atty. David J. 
Aleshire told officials last week. 
</P>
<P>
Aleshire is expected to deliver a formal analysis of the opinion, and the 
city's possible responses, at the Feb. 22 meeting of the Planning Commission. 
The matter will then be submitted to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The fate of the General Plan, which outlines development goals for the city, 
may ultimately be decided by the voters of Lawndale. 
</P>
<P>
The new opinion, which jolted city officials when it became public a few weeks 
ago, reverses a 1974 attorney general's opinion that had guided city officials 
for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
In 1974, the attorney general's office said that Ordinance 82, a Lawndale 
initiative law that required a citywide vote on the General Plan, was 
unconstitutional. Relying on that opinion, the council did not put the plan on 
the ballot and adopted it by a 4-1 vote in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
But in a letter dated Dec. 20, 1988, Deputy Atty. Gen. Rodney O. Lilyquist 
labeled the 1974 opinion erroneous. 
</P>
<P>
That was a victory for local activists Steve Mino and Herman Weinstein, who 
participated in the successful petition drive for Ordinance 82. They have, over 
the last year, argued that the city was wrong to ignore Ordinance 82 on the 
basis of the 1974 opinion. They argued that a legal opinion, even from the 
state attorney general, cannot override an initiative ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
At the urging of Mino and Weinstein, the council asked the state attorney 
general to re-examine the 1974 opinion. 
</P>
<P>
At Thursday's council meeting, Mino called the current General Plan an illegal 
document and asked the council to rescind it. He contends that the plan and all 
its amendments must be submitted to the city's voters. 
</P>
<P>
Aleshire advised the council to proceed cautiously because of litigation that 
could result if the General Plan was declared invalid. He said this, in effect, 
would create a moratorium on all development in Lawndale until a new plan could 
be prepared and put on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
If the council rescinds the plan, Aleshire said, the city would probably face 
lawsuits from developers who could argue that their property rights had been 
violated. 
</P>
<P>
Rescinding the plan would have "a very dramatic effect," he said.

CRITICS SAY CHEERLEADERS' ANTICS WERE BLUSHERS; 
</P>
<P>
POWDER-PUFF GAMES VANISH AFTER MAKEUP IS CHANGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
After months of fretful study and consultation with attorneys, the Los Angeles 
Unified School District has made a ruling: Boys will be boys. 
</P>
<P>
District officials this year issued a rule prohibiting high school boys from 
dressing up as female cheerleaders at powder-puff football games. As a result, 
the once-popular games -- where the girls battle it out on the field while the 
boys lead the cheers -- have all but died out. 
</P>
<P>
What's become clear in the months following the district's ruling is that 
students simply are not interested in taking part in a watered-down version of 
tradition. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided it's no fun if the guys can't dress up as girls," said Paul Geller, 
El Camino Real High School senior class president. 
</P>
<P>
Geller said his class organized an ice-skating party last week instead of 
holding its annual January powder-puff game. "But you can't really compare the 
two things," he said. "Everyone was really upset that we couldn't have the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
District officials said having boys dress up as female cheerleaders violates 
Title IX, a federal law that bans schools from discriminating on the basis of 
sex. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling, in a memo sent to high schools in September, allows the games but 
forbids boys from dressing as girls and especially from "using props under 
their clothing which represent female anatomical features," the memo said. It 
was prompted by a complaint about a powder-puff game held during the 1987-88 
school year, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Use of Balloons 
</P>
<P>
"We received a complaint that at one school in particular, the boys were 
imitating women, using balloons to make their breasts extremely large and 
behaving in a manner that some would call humorous but others could view as 
offensive and even obscene," said Connie LaFace-Olson, director of the 
district's Commission for Sex Equity. 
</P>
<P>
School administrators had been uneasy about the games, which in recent years 
have become increasingly raucous, LaFace-Olson said. But the last straw was the 
complaint that boys were squeezing each others' balloons, LaFace-Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
The incident sparked several months of study and deliberation by the district's 
Title IX office and the 29-member Commission for Sex Equity, which advises the 
district on sexual harassment and other forms of discrimination, LaFace-Olson 
said. This year, the commission also prohibited schools from allowing boys and 
girls to wear different colored graduation gowns because of a complaint last 
year, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Title IX, passed by Congress in 1972, has been used to force the expansion of 
women's athletic programs. The law gets its name from a section of the 
Education Amendments of 1972 passed to prohibit discrimination in schools that 
receive federal money. 
</P>
<P>
But in the case of powder-puff football, district officials say the law also 
prohibits school-sponsored events that cause humiliation based on gender. 
</P>
<P>
"If girls going to school are subjected to this activity, and they are 
ridiculed and made to feel like second-class citizens, then I think that 
constitutes discrimination," said Ada R. Treiger, a school district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
The district also has rules to protect the civil rights of disabled and 
minority students, district officials said. "It's not OK to have one gender 
stereotyped by another," said Richard Browning, a senior high schools division 
administrator. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is that girls were being put down by boys wearing anatomical props 
. . . mimicking cheerleaders by putting balloons under their shirts," Browning 
said. 
</P>
<P>
District officials won't identify where the complaint originated. "It was from 
a parent and student," LaFace-Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
But students said the new rule is just another example of adults 
misunderstanding and interfering in high school social life. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's ridiculous," said Allen Porter, senior class president at Canoga 
Park High School, which decided to cancel its powder-puff game rather than 
comply with the district regulations. "It's been blown totally out of 
proportion." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Popular Games 
</P>
<P>
In January, 1988, more than 300 students at El Camino Real went to the school's 
lunchtime powder-puff game, the last one played at Los Angeles schools in the 
San Fernando Valley, Geller said. Students this year were willing to fight the 
district rule to save the popular event but were told by an attorney "that we 
didn't have a chance against the district," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Just because some of the teachers and people at the district are offended, 
students don't feel that way," Geller said. "We weren't going out purposely to 
make fun of anybody; it was just a joke." 
</P>
<P>
One of the few remaining holdouts in the district is Lincoln High School, where 
student adviser Ben Wadsworth said the annual powder-puff game will take place 
this month despite the new policy. He said his students have grumbled about it 
but have taken no action. 
</P>
<P>
"Guys can participate as yell leaders and still do all the yelling and stunting 
and goofing around and even borrow sweater tops from girl yell leaders, but 
they'll be wearing slacks instead of skirts and no makeup," Wadsworth said.

PRESSURE PAYS OFF: JETS WON'T TURN OVER EL SEGUNDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Score one for El Segundo in its war against noisy planes that take off from Los 
Angeles International Airport and, according to city officials and residents, 
fly over the community. 
</P>
<P>
Federal Aviation Administration officials said last week that under a new 
policy effective by early April, air traffic controllers will tell pilots not 
to turn their aircraft until they are a mile out over the ocean. Currently, 
pilots are permitted to turn when they reach the shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Davies, the FAA's control tower chief at LAX, conceded in an interview that 
pressure from angry El Segundo officials is responsible for the agency's 
decision to alter the policy. 
</P>
<P>
For years, city officials have complained that pilots have turned too quickly 
to the south after taking off from LAX, putting their aircraft over El Segundo. 
Fed up with the problem, the officials in December erected a sign -- visible 
from the air and illuminated at night -- that reads: "UNSAFE AREA FOR JETS." 
</P>
<P>
The idea behind the sign, which has attracted national attention, is to deter 
pilots from flying over the city, lest they unnerve their passengers. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the FAA's action, Davies steadfastly maintained in an interview that 
the problem of aircraft turning too early is more a perceived one on the part 
of El Segundo officials and residents than a real one. 
</P>
<P>
Only on rare occasions do controllers instruct pilots to turn before reaching 
the shoreline, he said, for example when a pilot trying to land misses his 
approach. Also, if a plane were taking off on an adjacent runway, it might be 
instructed to turn earlier to ensure a proper distance between itself and the 
other aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
But Davies said the FAA wants to be a good neighbor and that is why it decided 
to take "that extra step" to show El Segundo officials that it cares. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are trying to do is work with them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo City Manager Fred Sorsabal said the FAA's decision to make pilots 
fly farther from the city before turning is "probably one of the first positive 
" steps taken by the agency to solve the problem. The city receives a handful 
of complaints every day about aircraft flying over their homes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think if they are sincere in enforcing it, then it will work," Sorsabal 
said. "But if they don't enforce it, it is just another one of those nice 
things on the books." 
</P>
<P>
For the time being, Sorsabal said, the city's sign will stay in place.

5 BAY LAWMAKERS SPENT $2 MILLION ON '88 RACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Five South Bay legislators spent more than $2 million last year to win 
reelection to legislative positions that pay $40,816 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Final year-end campaign finance statements filed last week with the secretary 
of state show that the four local Assembly members and one senator up for 
reelection last November raised $1.85 million in campaign contributions in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
The gap between the amount raised and the amount spent was closed by tapping 
campaign reserves or by borrowing from other legislators or outside sources. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to a salary, lawmakers receive $88 a day in tax-free expense 
payments during the legislative session, plus such perks as office expense 
allowances, auto lease payments and state gasoline credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Gerald N. Felando (R-San Pedro) spent $649,703, more than any other 
South Bay lawmaker, to win reelection from his heavily Republican 51st Assembly 
District. The veteran had to fight off a bitter and expensive Republican 
primary challenge last spring from Deane Dana III, son of Los Angeles County 
Supervisor Deane Dana, before coasting to victory last November. 
</P>
<P>
Felando raised $589,493 in contributions and made up the difference by 
borrowing from some of his Assembly Republican colleagues. He listed debts of 
$53,500 at the end of December, all but $10,000 of which was owed to the 
campaigns of fellow Republican lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
During the latest filing period from Oct. 23 to Dec. 31, Felando also received 
direct contributions from some of his legislative colleagues, including $5,000 
checks from Assemblywoman Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley) and Assemblyman Stan 
Statham (R-Oak Run). Felando also collected contributions from commercial 
fishing interests in his native San Pedro and from special interest groups in 
Sacramento. The California Assn. of Realtors political committee gave $450 
during the reporting period, boosting its total contribution for the year to 
$4,600. The Insurance Men's political committee gave $300 during the period and 
$2,650 for the year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Father's Loans 
</P>
<P>
In an unusual twist, incumbent Felando was outspent by GOP challenger Dana, a 
former official in Gov. George Deukmejian's Administration, who spent $777,106. 
The younger Dana's insurgent campaign was almost totally financed by his 
father, the supervisor, who resented Felando's successful effort in 1986 to 
oust Dana allies on the Republican county committee. He loaned his son $712,500 
in an unsuccessful effort to break the assemblyman's lock on the district, 
which runs from the beach cities to San Pedro, including Torrance and Lomita. 
The loans were forgiven. 
</P>
<P>
Running a close third in spending was Assemblyman Richard E. Floyd (D-Carson), 
the only other South Bay legislator to face a well-financed challenger last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd, a Hawthorne city councilman, raised $616,994 and spent $581,081 to 
assure his victory in the 53rd Assembly District against Republican challenger 
Charles Bookhammer. 
</P>
<P>
As chairman of the powerful Assembly Governmental Organization Committee, which 
handles all legislation dealing with alcoholic beverages, horse racing, the 
lottery and gambling, Floyd received large contributions from card clubs and 
horse-racing interests. 
</P>
<P>
Card clubs, including the Normandie Club of Gardena, gave $6,000 and the 
Commerce Club of Commerce gave $5,500. The Pacific Racing Assn. of Albany gave 
$3,700. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before the November election, Floyd received a $20,000 no-interest loan 
from Sacramento developer and horse-racing figure Christo D. Bardis. The 
assemblyman later repaid $5,000, leaving a $15,000 balance. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd also owes $15,000 to the campaign committee of his former boss, Sen. 
Ralph Dills (D-Gardena), and $2,000 apiece to Assemblyman Dave Elder (D-Long 
Beach) and Rep. Marty Martinez (D-Monterey Park). All the loans date back to 
Floyd's first race for the Legislature in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd, a member of the leadership of Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San 
Francisco), received $36,580 in cash contributions from Brown's political 
committee. He also received $48,345 in campaign postage from the Democratic 
State Central Committee, which can send campaign mailers at a lower postal rate 
than candidates. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Donations to Floyd 
</P>
<P>
Labor unions and trial lawyers also continued their historic practice of making 
large donations to Floyd. The California Applicants Attorneys Assn. gave $5,750 
during the latest reporting period and a total of $17,750 for the year. The 
California Trial Lawyers Assn. gave $2,000 during the reporting period and 
$17,000 for the year. 
</P>
<P>
The State Building and Construction Trades Council gave $3,000 in the last 
reporting period and $6,500 for the year, the same amount as the United Auto 
Workers. 
</P>
<P>
In the final days before the November election, Floyd gave $19,520 to John 
Vollbrecht, the Democratic challenger to Assemblyman Pat Nolan of Glendale, who 
was then Republican leader in the Assembly. Floyd and Nolan have been bitter 
adversaries for years. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Curtis R. Tucker (D-Inglewood), who died of cancer last October, 
raised $302,938 and spent a total of $327,593 on his primary and general 
election campaigns in 1988. Tucker easily defeated Inglewood City Councilman 
Daniel Tabor in a Democratic primary contest last June and made history in 
November by being reelected after his death. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before he died, Tucker transferred $28,000 from his campaign treasury 
reserves to that of his son, Curtis Tucker Jr., a candidate in Tuesday's 
special election for the open 50th Assembly District seat. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Tucker's year-end campaign statement shows a final payment of $234 
for the lease on his state car, a 1986 Cadillac, that was later purchased by 
his widow, according to Bob Connelly, chief administrative officer for the 
Assembly Rules Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Robert G. Beverly (R-Manhattan Beach) spent $210,185 to win a fourth term 
against token opposition in the 29th Senate District. He raised $141,832 in 
contributions and covered the difference by reducing a massive campaign 
surplus. Even so, Beverly still had $339,275 left in his treasury at year's 
end. 
</P>
<P>
His largest contribution during the reporting period came from the California 
Medical Assn., which gave $3,000, boosting its total for the year to $7,000. 
The California Optometric Assn.'s political committee donated $1,500 during the 
period. 
</P>
<P>
A political committee of California Retailers gave Beverly $1,200 just before 
Christmas, boosting its total contributions for the year to $3,200. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reimbursement for Gifts 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Elder, who faced only minor opposition in the 57th Assembly 
District, raised $208,163 and spent $287,645 on his reelection campaign. The 
difference came from a reduction in his campaign reserve to just under $15,000 
at year's end. 
</P>
<P>
His largest contributions during the reporting period came from the California 
State Council of Service Employees, which donated $1,500, and IDM Corp., a Long 
Beach developer, which gave $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Among the more unusual expenses that Elder reported was $4,460 to repay himself 
for Thanksgiving and Christmas gifts to his staff, for Christmas cards and 
child-care costs for a Sacramento campaign worker.

Imagine how strange and surprised Tim Moyle must have felt two months ago, 
still groggy from all that scotch but able to move around and even talk on the 
telephone, right after shooting himself in the head. 
</P>
<P>
Moyle, 22, is blind in the eye that was nearly blown out of his head by the 
.22-caliber bullet. He has blurred vision in the other eye. His sinuses were 
destroyed. He has no sense of smell. 
</P>
<P>
"By the width of a bobbie pin," his mother says, there was no brain damage. 
</P>
<P>
Moyle not only still has his brain, along with his friendly demeanor and gift 
of gab, but he appears determined and positive about using them all. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Root of Problem 
</P>
<P>
He talked to students at Sonora High School about his life in the fast lane, 
his suicide attempt and what he regards as the root of his problems -- alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids were enthralled," said Carol Avey, the teacher in a class Moyle 
visited. "Every time he paused, there was another question. They were asking 
graphic and personal questions, and he was giving candid answers." 
</P>
<P>
Larry Maucere, another teacher and school board member, said Moyle gets through 
to students because "he's street-wise and he talks their language." 
</P>
<P>
"I just B.S. with them like I did in school," Moyle said. "I like talking. And 
with my eye the way it is, they can see what alcohol did." 
</P>
<P>
Moyle hopes to get invitations to talk to young people elsewhere. For 
transportation and room and board, he said, he will go anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
He also wants to open a local youth entertainment club and is trying to 
negotiate a lease for it in east Sonora. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not going to be a stoner haven," he said. "No drugs, no alcohol, inside 
the building or out. We'll have a dress code, people will pay to get in, and it 
will be so much fun they'll want to keep coming back." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Attracted to Alcohol 
</P>
<P>
He said such a club might have attracted him when he was a Sonora High student. 
As it was, his favorite attraction was booze. 
</P>
<P>
Moyle was outgoing, happy and popular in school. He played on a championship 
football team, and his premature bald spot made it easy for him to buy liquor 
for himself and friends. 
</P>
<P>
When he was a junior, his parents bought him a Datsun 300ZX sports car, which 
didn't hurt his popularity any, nor his appetite for excitement. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd go to Tahoe and gamble every chance I got," he said. "If I wanted to do 
something, I did it." 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, he got away with it. He held a job at a feed store, and another 
one part-time serving papers for private investigator Dennis Raymond. He liked 
his work. He was engaged to be married. Life was great. 
</P>
<P>
Then his fiancee broke up with him. He lived with a friend for a while, and in 
late September moved in with his mother and stepfather, Barbara and Bill Tolar 
of Tuolumne City. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Decided on Suicide 
</P>
<P>
The Tolars had gone out of town Sunday, Oct. 2. Moyle kicked back with a fifth 
of scotch. He watched the 49ers beat the Lions on television, went through 
about half of the bottle and decided to kill himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I never got depressed when I drank before," he said. "This time -- it was 
weird -- something went click. It was like I was getting back at my 
girlfriend." 
</P>
<P>
Moyle loaded the pistol and called his closest friend to tell him his plan. The 
friend tried to talk him out of it, but by now this was like a trip to Tahoe. 
Moyle had decided to do something and he did it. 
</P>
<P>
But with second thoughts in his head, and also a bullet, Moyle called 911. The 
ambulance arrived about the same time as the friend. Moyle was flown to a 
hospital in Modesto and from there to another one in San Francisco. Surgeons 
removed the slug, and he was home again within two weeks, making plans for the 
rest of his life. 
</P>
<P>
They don't include alcohol.

BLOCK GRANT BUDGET APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Lawndale City Council voted 3 to 1 last week to approve a budget for the 
city's 1989-90 Community Development Block Grant funds. The budget includes 
$45,731 for public service projects, $377,107 for a residential property 
rehabilitation program, and $64,716 for improvements such as curbing and 
underground utilities at the city's senior housing project, to be built at 
153rd Street and Condon Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Acting Mayor Harold E. Hofmann opposed the city taking responsibility for the 
improvements at the senior project, but after some discussion he voted with 
Councilmen Larry Rudolph and Dan McKenzie to approve the budget. Councilwoman 
Carol Norman voted against the allocations, urging that some funds be set aside 
for a truancy program. 
</P>
<P>
Following the recommendation of a Citizens Advisory Committee, the council 
approved funds for graffiti removal, a senior nutrition program, the Center for 
Independent Living, South Bay Free Clinic, a center for the homeless called 
House of Yahweh and the South Bay Youth Service Center.

COST-CUTTING UNDERMINING U.S. WEAPONS PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

When Rockwell International won a contract in 1987 to develop a new gunship for 
the Air Force, it appeared that the big aerospace firm had broken into an 
important business and had succeeded in at least partly offsetting the decline 
of its B-1 bomber program. 
</P>
<P>
But today the company is mired in a colossal cost overrun -- reportedly about 
$90 million -- and has fallen behind schedule as it attempts to complete the 
first of the gunships, The Times has learned. The Air Force has notified 
Rockwell that it intends to withhold contract payments on the program. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rockwell has retained the defense industry law firm of McKenna, 
Conner &amp; Cuneo to conduct a legal review of its contract with the Air 
Force, based on concerns that the contract might be flawed, Rockwell executives 
said in a recent interview. Among the issues under review is whether the 
contract fails to specify all the work necessary to develop the gunship. 
</P>
<P>
The troubled program to produce the gunship, an aircraft known as the AC-130U, 
appears to be a case study of how the Pentagon's efforts in recent years to 
create aggressive competition and to drive down the price of weapons have 
created costly trauma, not only for industry, but also for the military 
services. 
</P>
<P>
The legacy of the Reagan Administration's effort to drive down contractor 
prices and profits is a trail of sick weapons programs across the nation. Even 
though the Pentagon recently has moderated its adversarial methods, the 
contract pipeline is full of programs carrying significant liabilities for the 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
"The defense industry is not like a department store, where you can take a few 
loss leaders," said retired Rear Adm. Stuart Platt, who helped set the 
competitive policies for the Navy. "The government is dealing with too powerful 
a hand. It has to remember that it has responsibility for stewardship of this 
industry." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, some defense contractors have become desperate to obtain new 
business in an era of tight Pentagon budgets, leading them sometimes to make 
fixed-price bids that are unrealistically low in their price projections and 
risky on technical issues. 
</P>
<P>
"It shows what happens when you have aerospace companies without any business 
-- they are willing to bid anything to get a contract," said Paine Webber 
aerospace analyst Joseph Campbell, who estimates that the defense industry 
faces more than $6 billion in losses on fixed-price development contracts. 
</P>
<P>
For example: 
</P>
<P>
* Former Navy Secretary John F. Lehman Jr. once boasted that he cut the 
development cost of the T-45 trainer aircraft in half with aggressive 
negotiating. But, as a result, McDonnell Douglas had to forgo wind-tunnel tests 
of the aircraft, among other things. Now, the Navy has discovered that the 
aircraft is unstable and needs engine modifications to even land on an aircraft 
carrier. 
</P>
<P>
* Grumman, a Long Island aircraft builder, agreed to develop a new version of 
the F-14 fighter plane without any profit and under a fixed-price contract. It 
suffered a $120-million cost overrun, though it ultimately persuaded the Navy 
to absorb half the loss. 
</P>
<P>
* The Norden unit of United Technologies was stung with a loss of several 
hundred million dollars on a fixed-price contract to develop new radar. 
</P>
<P>
* Hughes Aircraft suffered a $250-million loss on a new tactical missile for 
the Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
* Five major aircraft companies, organized in two teams, will collectively lose 
an estimated $2 billion on a project to develop a new Air Force fighter, which 
now faces delays because the government does not have enough money to keep it 
on track. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, the Pentagon has no administrative system to even monitor such 
losses, even though it so often expresses concern about its industrial base. A 
study by the Defense Science Board, a government advisory panel, concluded last 
year that "investors' skepticism has caused a virtual closure of the equity and 
debt markets to all but a few major contractors." 
</P>
<P>
"These losses are weakening considerably the industrial base for national 
security," said Paul Nisbet, an analyst at Prudential Bache Securities. "It is 
a bad way of doing business, and it is government shirking its responsibility. 
They are shifting as much risk as possible onto the industry." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hughes Official's Complaint 
</P>
<P>
In today's competitions for defense contracts, companies sometimes go to 
extremes to get business. A few months ago, Hughes Aircraft bid a fixed price 
of $1 to win a position as a second supplier for a Navy electronic warfare 
program known as the SLQ-32. Although the future payoff may be substantial, the 
company is expected to lose as much as $10 million in qualifying as the second 
supplier. 
</P>
<P>
"This is what we are forced to do," a Hughes official complained. "We don't 
like to make $1 bids." 
</P>
<P>
The tortured case of the AC-130U illustrates how competitive bidding and tough 
Pentagon negotiating can turn a relatively small contract carrying a modest 
profit into a nightmare involving a major loss. 
</P>
<P>
The gunship would carry a crew of 13 into commando-type raids, such as the 
invasion of Grenada, and operate something like an airborne artillery system. 
It could safely circle a target at up to 10,000 feet altitude and blast away 
even at targets obscured by clouds. 
</P>
<P>
Under the contract, Rockwell takes a standard C-130 Hercules cargo aircraft 
built by Lockheed and mounts a 105-millimeter howitzer into the fuselage, along 
with two smaller guns. The guns are aimed by a sophisticated airborne radar, 
the same one used on the F-15 jet fighter, and the entire aircraft is protected 
by sophisticated electronic defenses. 
</P>
<P>
In July, 1987, Rockwell signed a $155-million fixed-price contract, which 
included a profit of $14 million, to develop the technology and produce the 
first AC-130U gunship. When Rockwell bid on the program, it looked deceptively 
simple. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Misunderstanding Cited 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we understood what the Air Force wanted at the time, and I don't 
think the Air Force understood what we were proposing," said John J. Pierro, 
president of Rockwell's North American Aircraft unit, in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
"This AC-130U is going to be a pretty lethal weapon," Pierro said. "But (the 
program) is harder and more complex than we thought." 
</P>
<P>
The contract required Rockwell to meet a "performance specification" on the 
gunship's capabilities, which Rockwell thought allowed some degree of freedom 
on detailed design issues. In practice, however, the Air Force took control of 
planning the configuration of the system. 
</P>
<P>
The changes demanded by Air Force officials have caused delays, and the service 
declined to exercise a contract option to start production of the gunship. 
Rockwell must still pass a "critical design review," which has been postponed 
from February to May. 
</P>
<P>
"What Rockwell did was underestimate the complexity of this thing," said Col. 
Paul L. Beggs, director of the group of programs that includes the AC-130U at 
Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. "It sounds pretty simple, especially to 
a contractor who has just come through the B-1 program. It is not pressing the 
state of the art. But Rockwell discovered they were behind the eight ball and 
so we agreed to slip the schedule." 
</P>
<P>
The problems started before Rockwell even signed the contract. 
</P>
<P>
In selecting Rockwell, the Air Force used a bargaining technique known as a 
"best and final offer" to haggle for a good deal. In its request for a best and 
final offer, dated May 29, 1987, the Air Force said that it had only $438 
million to spend to buy 12 gunships and that bidders for the program were 
required to fulfill all of the requirements that the Air Force wanted or their 
bids would be thrown out. 
</P>
<P>
The other bidder was Lockheed, which had built previous generations of gunships 
and knew something about the business. It thought the Air Force was asking too 
much for the amount of money it had to spend. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Hungry' for Business 
</P>
<P>
"We could never come up with the same capability as Rockwell for the amount of 
money the Air Force wanted to spend," recalled John McLellan, vice president 
for programs at Lockheed's Ontario operation. "We probably knew too much. That 
is what it amounted to. 
</P>
<P>
"Rockwell was very hungry for business. They were laying off large numbers of 
people on the B-1, and they bid aggressively. It is going to be a costly lesson 
for somebody, either the company or the government." 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force also got Rockwell to accept something called "total system 
performance responsibility," a Pentagon policy that essentially shifts all the 
technical risk onto a contractor. 
</P>
<P>
"It is an interesting contract," Pierro said. "We have learned some things 
about those kinds of contracts." 
</P>
<P>
One lesson is that total responsibility means total liability rather than total 
authority. It did not free Rockwell to design the gunship on its own terms, 
even if it met the performance requirement. The Air Force has insisted on 
changes that Rockwell had not anticipated when it bid on the program, Pierro 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell, for example, has had vigorous negotiations with the Air Force on 
something called a system integration laboratory, which is a mock-up of all the 
gunship's computers, software, radar and electronic boxes. The laboratory is 
supposed to make sure that the whole system works before it is put into the 
aircraft. Rockwell wanted to do less laboratory testing, but the Air Force 
believed that it was less risky to do more testing. 
</P>
<P>
Another major additional expense occurred when the Air Force decided against 
Rockwell's plan to use an electronic warfare system -- a radar and 
communications jammer -- mounted on a pod outside the aircraft, which is 
standard for most tactical aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Air Force decided last year that it wanted an internal system and 
selected the very fancy one used on the B-52 bomber. Although Rockwell did not 
have to pay for the electronic warfare system itself, the more complicated 
internal system required additional wiring, antennas and structural 
modifications to the airframe. It also will need five months of flight testing 
that Rockwell had not expected, Pierro said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Details Called Fuzzy 
</P>
<P>
Even small items, such as the type of knobs on radar consoles, became a 
negotiating issue. The Air Force was not happy with the type of intercom that 
connects the cockpit with the battle management center in the belly of the 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything was specified in the contract, but details were fuzzy," said one 
Rockwell engineer who spoke off the record. "There was a lack of depth in the 
contract on the requirements." 
</P>
<P>
Concerns were raised even before the contract was signed, but "the whole thrust 
of the effort was to win the contract," this engineer said. 
</P>
<P>
Beggs, the Air Force official, disagrees that the Air Force was aggressive in 
its contracting practices. He said the Air Force simply asked, "Mr. Contractor, 
you tell us what you can do with this much money. We selected Rockwell because 
at the time they offered more for the amount of money we had to spend." 
</P>
<P>
Beggs also blamed some of Rockwell's cost overruns on the company's failure to 
firmly tie down supplier prices before it signed the contract. Pierro, however, 
said the modifications demanded by the Air Force have caused the suppliers to 
push up their prices. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the cause, costs have been mounting. The company took a writeoff on 
the program in the fourth quarter but declines to say how much it reserved for 
potential losses. Under its $155-million incentive contract, the government 
absorbs 75% of any overrun up to $177 million and then Rockwell takes 100% of 
the loss. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the writeoff, the gunship was expected to cost $50 million more 
than the $155-million target price. But since then the expected overrun has 
grown considerably. It is now said to be about $90 million over the target, 
authoritative sources in industry and government said. One securities analyst 
also estimated the overrun at about $90 million, but Pierro said the amount is 
still uncertain and that $90 million is "on the high side." 
</P>
<P>
Pierro denied that Rockwell low-balled the bid. Rather, the company sought to 
offset its declining B-1 bomber business by getting into weapons modernization, 
in which the military services update equipment rather than develop new 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Planned to Spend Full Amount 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't expect to lose money," he said. "Philosophically, we would never bid 
a contract that way. We think good business, well performed, deserves a 
profit." 
</P>
<P>
But the Air Force was not so sure that Rockwell would make a profit. In fact, 
it planned from the beginning to spend the full $177 million, Beggs, the Air 
Force official, said. 
</P>
<P>
"Did (Rockwell) buy in knowing they were going to lose their shirt?" Beggs 
said. "I don't know. My personal opinion is that they bid this program 
expecting very little profit or possibly a small loss. But I doubt they bought 
in expecting to go $90 million over target." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rockwell's hiring of McKenna Conner Cuneo may be laying the 
groundwork for an eventual claim against the government or an effort to 
restructure the contract. Asked if the gunship contract is legally flawed, 
Pierro said, "It could be. 
</P>
<P>
"In a case where we feel that we have a work requirement that is out of the 
scope of the contract, we would feel obligated to proceed with that (a legal 
effort). 
</P>
<P>
"If we have legal issues, we are going to take those off to the side and not 
let those interfere with performance on the contract. We are maintaining very 
close liaison with our legal people." 
</P>
<P>
Then he said, "It doesn't mean that we are running the program with lawyers." 
</P>
<P>
If Rockwell ends up with a large loss on the gunship, the diversified 
industrial firm is big enough and has enough profitable defense programs to 
afford it. But other firms are being jeopardized by such losses and many are 
leaving the industry. 
</P>
<P>
Eaton, Unisys, Goodyear, Gould, United Technologies, Lockheed and Honeywell, 
among others, are selling some or all of their defense operations. 
Allied-Signal, IBM and Motorola have said they will not attempt to expand their 
defense businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"The longer-term effect of these losses is that it drives the better people out 
of the industry," said Michael N. Beltramo, a consultant and former Rand 
research analyst. "In the name of competition, the government is unleashing big 
anti-competitive forces that are going to result in an industry contraction." 
</P>
<P>
Although a shrunken defense industry may be inevitable in any case as defense 
budgets fall, the Pentagon lacks a policy or a scheme for managing the 
approaching shakeout, Beltramo said. So far, the Pentagon appears to be 
managing its industrial base by saddling contractors with losses, then seeing 
which ones are driven out. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I can tell, this is all happening by default," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But the alternative is equally abhorrent to the industry, which is opposed to 
the idea of the Pentagon being able to decide to put specific firms out of 
business in segments of the industry that have excess capacity, such as 
aircraft manufacturing.

"That's not in the free enterprise system that we have in the U.S.," said 
Lockheed Vice Chairman Robert H. Fuhrman, who led the Defense Science Board 
study. "We are big boys, and we win some and lose some. If we lose too many, 
then we aren't going to be around anymore."

JAMES FLANIGAN: HEAT IS ON IN WORLD MARKET FOR LIGHT BULBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You hear it everywhere these days, talk of the "global economy." It's the 
latest buzzword of business, and even Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev 
referred to a "single" world economy in his speech to the United Nations last 
December. 
</P>
<P>
That sounds good, but what does it mean? Is the "global market" anything more 
than hype? Does it benefit anybody? 
</P>
<P>
The answer is as near at hand as your light bulb -- the everyday product of an 
industry suddenly stirring with competition. 
</P>
<P>
General Electric, the leading U.S. producer of light bulbs, has just formed a 
joint venture with Toshiba of Japan that will increase GE's business in the Far 
East. Philips Industries of the Netherlands is intensifying its assault on the 
U.S. lighting market. The Sylvania division of GTE is battling for market share 
as light bulbs flood in from West Germany, South Korea, Taiwan, Hungary and 
Poland. 
</P>
<P>
Everybody, it seems, is reaching out for a piece of a world market that totals 
$8.5 billion in lighting sales. And the best part is that their competitive 
battles work for you. 
</P>
<P>
Competition is bringing light bulb prices down and new products to market in an 
increasing stream. 
</P>
<P>
GE is pooling research efforts with Toshiba, Japan's light bulb leader, and the 
two are building a $25-million plant near Cleveland to make fluorescent lights 
-- half of which will be exported to Japan. GE also has an energy-saving light 
bulb so impressive that Southern California Edison is recommending and 
distributing it to customers. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Philips -- which leads in Europe and sells in Japan through a joint 
venture -- is pushing light bulbs here with a $12-million ad campaign, 
incentives for supermarket operators, and a special-offer bulb that lasts 
one-third longer than standard light bulbs. 
</P>
<P>
Sylvania is responding with advanced technology long-life bulbs, and 
fluorescent lights that screw into lamps as incandescent bulbs do -- providing 
an easier-to-use product for business customers. (Residential customers 
generally prefer softer, incandescent light.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Such a Wonderful Business' 
</P>
<P>
So, clearly, global competition is the mother of invention. But the business 
wasn't always so competitive. Legend has it that GE and Philips long ago had an 
informal agreement to split the world, Philips selling in Europe and GE selling 
here. But legends aside, the reality was that distance and war kept markets 
separate until five years ago when Philips bought Westinghouse's lighting 
business. 
</P>
<P>
"It's such a wonderful business," a GE vice president mused at the time, "I 
don't see how Westinghouse could have let it go." The Dutch giant has since 
built U.S. lighting sales to roughly $500 million -- which trails GE's roughly 
$1.5 billion U.S. sales. 
</P>
<P>
Light bulbs are a highly profitable business -- with automated, volume 
production. "GE's operating profit margins are over 20%," estimates analyst 
Albert Turner of Chicago's Duff &amp; Phelps research firm. That means that the 
humble light bulb, invented 110 years ago by Thomas Edison, is as profitable as 
the newest gee-whiz computer. 
</P>
<P>
But the technology didn't stop with Edison, and that's the key to lighting's 
potential today. Look no further than the fluorescent lights that glow in 
offices, but not in American homes. Homes in Europe and Japan use more 
fluorescent lighting than American houses do because it's a big energy saver. 
</P>
<P>
A fluorescent bulb lasts 20,000 hours, compared to 1,000 for an incandescent 
bulb, and provides three times the light for the same amount of power. The only 
problem is that fluorescent light is harsh to the eye and makes people look 
funny. But bulb makers are working on the problem, and Americans will see new 
types of light on to market. 
</P>
<P>
And there is opportunity elsewhere as others begin to light up their lives as 
Americans have. (U.S. light usage, 37% of the world's total, is greater than 
all of Europe or Asia.) For most of this century, the business has grown 
through the introduction of artificial light -- a thought put poetically by an 
old man in Ireland's remote Aran Islands who, when asked the most important 
change he had seen in fourscore years, replied: "Oh, the coming of the sudden 
light." 
</P>
<P>
In the 1990s, the global market will spread that light.

SUPPORT GROUPS -- WHERE CEOS HELP CEOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM SCHACHTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bob Morris, chief executive, was talking about his goals. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time I write down my fundamental life purpose, it comes out different," 
he said. "But they all have the word 'harmony' in them." 
</P>
<P>
His light blue eyes looking from face to face around the room, Morris explained 
his difficulty finding a rewarding role in his months-old company, which 
operates a child-care center in Cypress and plans to open several more. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, the sandy-haired 44-year-old said, he wants to earn $300,000 a year. But 
other things are just as important. "I need to find the niche where I get to 
come forth completely as a human being," Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
Group therapy? No -- and yes. This was a meeting last week of the Summit Team, 
one of a growing number of forums in which top corporate executives gather in 
small groups, drop their facades of omnipotence and, in styles that range from 
strait-laced to funky, seek out the frank counsel of their peers. 
</P>
<P>
At dozens of conference tables across the country -- including nearly 50 in 
Southern California -- these chief executive and near-CEOs, mostly of small- 
and medium-sized firms, are sitting down once a month to bare their hidden 
personal vulnerabilities, test business plans and build leadership skills in an 
atmosphere that combines support with surgically sharp criticism. 
</P>
<P>
How do I go about firing my controller and making sure the new one doesn't 
fail, too? What do I do about a son who got straight A's in high school but 
won't stop partying at college? Can I give my franchisees more say in corporate 
policy without diluting my authority? How do I meld my values and my business? 
These are the kinds of questions chief executives are paying as much as $10,000 
per year to run by other chief executives. 
</P>
<P>
"Only kings know the affairs of kings," explained Bill Williams, president of 
the Executive Committee, the oldest and largest of the organizations that 
package and coordinate executive support groups. "They can come expose their 
downsides, their frailties, their concerns, their worries." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Learned More at Parties 
</P>
<P>
TEC, as Williams' group is known, was founded in 1957 by a Milwaukee 
businessman who realized that he learned more during the cocktail parties at 
management seminars than at the formal sessions. Most of the nation's 150 TEC 
groups, including 37 in Southern California, are run by Williams' company in 
San Diego, while the original organization in Milwaukee runs groups in 
Wisconsin and Michigan. Participation has doubled to 1,600 chief executives in 
the past three years, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
TEC pioneered the format that other support groups have adapted. A TEC group of 
up to 14 chief executives, chosen to represent diverse industries, meets once a 
month for a full day at one of the member's firms. In the morning, an outside 
expert makes a presentation on financial planning, marketing, taxes, investing, 
team building, current affairs or some other topic of interest to the group. 
</P>
<P>
The heavy-duty work begins after lunch. Members present their "issues," the 
business and personal challenges about which they have nowhere else to turn for 
advice. Their colleagues then drill them with questions, offer parallels from 
their own businesses and suggest solutions or, more often, the paths to take to 
find solutions. 
</P>
<P>
In a typical exchange, James H. Furry, president of Grand American Fare, a 
Santa Monica company that operates 33 restaurants with total revenue of about 
$30 million, needed feedback on a management issue from his TEC group, which 
met in Lawndale recently. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reason Questioned 
</P>
<P>
The problem: Furry wanted his restaurants' general managers to maintain a 5 
1/2-day work week, but the managers wanted to cut back to five days. 
</P>
<P>
"What is your fear about the five days?" asked Samuel K. Freshman, chairman and 
president of Standard Management Co., a real estate company in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's just another lowering of standards and expectations," Furry 
replied. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't care if my general manager worked one hour a day or one hour a 
week, as long as his supervisors were doing the job," said Aaron Cohen, 
president of United Education &amp; Software, a troubled chain of trade schools 
based in Encino. "A manager's job is to make sure other people do their job." 
</P>
<P>
Michael W. Arthur, executive vice president of Los Angeles-based Sizzler 
Restaurants International, disagreed. "It's incredible, the difference between 
when the general manager is in or not," he said. "You can go in as a customer 
and see it." 
</P>
<P>
On this issue, Furry, a husky 40-year-old whose restaurants include the Saddle 
Peak Lodge in Calabasas and the Oar House in Santa Monica, acknowledged that he 
was not ready to change his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"Why am I holding on?" he said. "It's because it's one of the reasons we've 
been successful." 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Freshman reflected on the value of such repartee. 
</P>
<P>
"Anywhere else," he said, "everybody has an ax to grind or deal with. If you're 
dealing with a consultant, they're trying to sell more consulting services. If 
you're dealing with your board of directors, it's usually your relatives, your 
stockholders, your attorney, your key employees. They're influenced in the 
advice they're giving you by their relationship to you. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unhelpful for Some 
</P>
<P>
"TEC is the only place I've ever found where I get truly unbiased advice and 
sincere advice," Freshman said. "It's sort of a mutual exchange. You get out of 
it what you put into it. These people are more frank with you than even your 
spouse." 
</P>
<P>
Executives uncomfortable with give-and-take find groups such as TEC unhelpful. 
</P>
<P>
"For the person who's not willing to take a stand or take a risk, it's not a 
good place to be, and if you're not a good listener, it's not a good place to 
be," said Judith Segal, a Los Angeles management consultant who has worked with 
several support groups. "For the person who thinks they know everything, it is 
for them, but they won't enjoy it." 
</P>
<P>
Each TEC group is led by a "chairman," a management consultant who coordinates 
all the meetings and conducts monthly one-on-one coaching sessions with the 
members. A poor chairman may mean that a group goes over the same issues 
endlessly, Segal warned. Executives pay $7,200 per year to participate. 
</P>
<P>
Similar rewards can be had for less. After Lon H. Records, president of Target 
Specialty Products, an agricultural chemical company in Cerritos, read about 
TEC in a financial publication in 1985, he decided to recruit a support group 
of his own. 
</P>
<P>
Three and a half years later, the Roundtable -- a dozen top decision makers, 
from a high school principal to other corporate presidents -- is still meeting 
for two hours once a month to address members' business and personal concerns. 
The dues are about $25 quarterly. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a big believer in networking," Records said. "I am definitely not bright 
enough to be able to solve all the problems I'm faced with. Why should I try to 
reinvent the wheel all the time?" 
</P>
<P>
At the Summit Team, members are intent on inventing whole new ways of 
conducting business. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Emotional Drain 
</P>
<P>
Founded two years ago by Santa Monica management consultant Doug Kruschke, a 
former TEC chairman, the group has a decided "new age" focus. Many of the 
corporate chiefs who pay $9,800 annually to participate are veterans of 
therapy, est or other human potential programs. They hug and cry. When they 
understand a colleague's comment, they say, "I hear you." When they don't, they 
say, "I'm not getting it." 
</P>
<P>
The 12-hour monthly meetings can be an emotional drain, careening from 
revealing descriptions of foundering love relationships to intense assessments 
of personal and business goals to heated discussions of participants' corporate 
crises. The process of learning to peel back layers of armor and share openly 
with others in the group is as important, members say, as what is shared. 
</P>
<P>
"We're helping people to ask the question and answer the question, 'What is 
real success for me?' " Kruschke explained. " 'What's the best way for me to 
achieve that? What do I have to learn and develop to be able to do that?' If 
people are interested in that kind of thing, they fit in our program. If those 
are weird questions, they don't belong with us." 
</P>
<P>
While more introspective than a typical Summit Team program, the goal-setting 
exercise Bob Morris and six other chief executives undertook one morning last 
week at a hotel in Culver City demonstrated the group's unconventional 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
Morris talked about his personal goals -- "to play a lot," to stop smoking, to 
drop 15 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"I am about creating intimacy, more and more, with each person with whom I have 
a relationship," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And he read aloud the mission statement he had drafted for his new child-care 
company: "To serve the children, the parents, the community and the staff in a 
self-esteem-based child-care organization while providing an excellent ROI 
(return on investment) to the investor." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Welcomed Reunion 
</P>
<P>
Richard S. Lapine, president of Signature Housewares, a Camarillo firm with 
$7.5 million in revenue last year, was in tears. For months, Morris, busy with 
selling his successful photo processing lab and starting his new firm, had not 
brought any enthusiasm to the Summit Team. But now Lapine felt he had. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to shout, 'Welcome back!' because, all of a sudden, I recognized the 
person who I've spent so many years with who was gone the last six months," 
Lapine said. 
</P>
<P>
Others in the group were moved by Morris' description of his vision for better 
child care -- so moved that Morris seemed to get more excited about his 
business as he listened. 
</P>
<P>
"I just up-leveled the whole thing, the child-care deal," he said. "I think 
that's the only place meaningful work can be done." 
</P>
<P>
Kruschke smiled. His lecture, earlier, on the difference between pursuing goals 
that others consider important and goals that bring genuine satisfaction had 
been neatly illustrated. "The important thing is," he told Morris, "you're 
hooking up with your love." 
</P>
<P>
It isn't easy. Mark H. Shaw, chief executive of the 190-congregation United 
Church of Religious Science, headquartered in Los Angeles, was joining the 
group for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a public speaker," Shaw said as he introduced himself, "but the topic I 
never talk about is myself." 
</P>
<P>
Then, for more than an hour, he stripped himself bare, talking about the 
troubles of his childhood, his shortcomings as a leader and his doubts about 
his career. 
</P>
<P>
As Shaw ended, the other executives sighed and shook their heads. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to acknowledge," Lapine said, "that's an awful lot of sharing for 
someone who said they didn't want to." 
</P>

WALL STREET / JOHN CRUDELE: TIPS TO AVOID LURE OF CLEVER PONZI SCAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CRUDELE, JOHN CRUDELE is a financial columnist for New York magazine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Suppose a stranger called you on the telephone and suggested that you invest in 
a company that refined sand from a Costa Rican beach into gold. 
</P>
<P>
Would you give him money? Probably not. 
</P>
<P>
Well, what if an executive from an oil and natural gas exploration company that 
you've never heard of asked you to hand over some of your hard-earned money so 
his company could drill for oil in the Appalachian Mountains? 
</P>
<P>
This executive proves to you that he's found oil once already -- and he really 
has -- and that his first group of investors made out pretty well. 
</P>
<P>
This one you might go for. 
</P>
<P>
Both were scams -- the first a pretty transparent one; the second ended up as a 
cleverly disguised Ponzi scheme in which a couple of groups of investors got 
what looked like a return but really all they were getting was some of the 
money being invested by subsequent generations of investors. 
</P>
<P>
Investors lost a lot of money before the government shut the scams down. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, regulators have been shutting down lots of so-called penny stock and 
commodity scams lately. And just last week the Justice Department and other 
government regulators stepped up their vigilance by establishing a task force 
in six major U.S. cities to combat fraud. 
</P>
<P>
The only problem, experts say, is that unsavory characters, including organized 
crime figures (see below), seem to be creating new investment scams faster than 
the old ones can be eradicated. 
</P>
<P>
Since regulators seem to be making only a little headway on the supply side of 
the fraud equation, experts say that controlling the demand for these shady 
investments seems to be the best way to reverse the trend. 
</P>
<P>
This won't be easy, of course, since a lot of investors get caught up in scams 
because they're greedy. "There's very little a consumer can do except stay 
away," says Philip Feigin, Colorado's securities commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
Investors can also watch for certain clues that a scam is in the works. Here 
are a dozen tips from Joseph Goldstein, associate director of the Securities 
and Exchange Commission's enforcement division (who has even received calls 
from probable scam artists while at work), and Sarah Ackerson, assistant 
director of market regulations, that might help even the greediest investor 
avoid getting scammed. 
</P>
<P>
* Rule 1: Be wary of any investment promise that seems too good. And if the 
"broker" guarantees that an investment will yield a certain amount, ask him to 
put it in writing. Chances are, says Goldstein, that a crooked broker will 
balk. 
</P>
<P>
* Rule 2: Don't be lured into buying penny stocks just because you think it 
would be cool to own 10,000 shares of anything. 
</P>
<P>
* Rule 3: Don't trust any broker you don't know. Chances are he got your name 
off a list of several hundred potential investors that he's calling that day. 
There's a second thing to be wary of here, says Ackerson. Some unscrupulous 
brokers will try to develop a rapport with an investor by calling him several 
times over a short period of time. But he won't try to sell you anything until 
the third phone call or so. 
</P>
<P>
* Rule 4: If you don't understand an investment, don't invest in it. 
</P>
<P>
* Rule 5: Be wary of out-of-town calls. Why would a broker in Florida be 
calling your home in Kansas City? Some regulators say that if you can't walk 
across the street and shake the broker's hand, why would you trust him with 
your money? (A lot of scam artists work out of Florida, according to the SEC. 
Since they don't want to meet their prospective customers anyway, the con men 
figure they might as well live someplace warm.) 
</P>
<P>
* Rule 6: Before writing that check, investors should investigate the brokerage 
firm's history and get a copy of its most recent financial statement. Another 
warning: Some scam perpetrators will acquire a legitimate brokerage firm and 
assume its identify, so even this precaution isn't foolproof. 
</P>
<P>
* Rule 7: If a broker tries to sell you stock in a company whose price you 
can't follow in any of the usual places, be careful. Some legitimate 
over-the-counter stocks are listed on what's called the "pink sheets." But if 
you can't find price quotes on a stock (except through the broker who sold you 
the security), it could mean that the stock and the company don't really exist. 
</P>
<P>
* Rule 8: Ask a regular brokerage like Merrill Lynch whether it would be able 
to sell the stock you're thinking of buying. If a regular brokerage firm can't 
execute a sell order, you might be stuck with the stock for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
* Rule 9: If a broker you don't know says you have to buy a stock quickly 
because something good is going to happen soon, hang up. The typical trick, 
says the SEC, is to tell an investor that another customer just canceled a buy 
order for some stock that has already gone up in price. The broker then tells 
an investor that he can have part of the trade that the other investor 
canceled, but only if he moves quickly. "The urgency of the situation is 
another red flag," Goldstein says. 
</P>
<P>
* Rule 10: If a broker you are not familiar with tells you he has some hot 
information about a company -- for instance, that it is about to be acquired -- 
chances are you're being set up, Ackerson says. 
</P>
<P>
* Rule 11: Check out the brokerage representative that calls you to see if he 
has a record of securities violations. Most states keep tabs on this sort of 
thing, as does the SEC. The North American Securities Administrators Assn. in 
Washington acts as a liaison with state regulators. Another warning: Most scam 
artists are now hiring salespeople right out of college, so the person who 
called you last night might not have a record yet. 
</P>
<P>
* Rule 12: Remember that brokers from these scam firms use scripts. So just 
because the guy can answer all your questions without stumbling doesn't mean 
that he's on the up and up. "They will put you at ease," Goldstein says. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody knows for sure how many stock scams are going on at this time, and even 
the experts won't venture a guess as to how much money is taken from defrauded 
investors around the country each year. But experts sense that scams are 
growing in both number and complexity. 
</P>
<P>
"The criminal element has become more sophisticated," says John Arterberry, who 
works on stock frauds at the Justice Department. "They take some of the old 
schemes and dress them up." 
</P>
<P>
Consider this: Last summer, regulators in Florida alone inspected 17 brokerages 
and found serious violations at 15. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Harper, associate regional administrator at the SEC's Miami office, 
says the successful penny stock salesperson can earn between $20,000 and 
$30,000 a month. An office manager for an unscrupulous brokerage can rake in 
over $2 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
The salespeople work hard, probably each making hundreds of calls a day. One 
questionable brokerage operation working out of a motel in Jacksonville, Fla., 
was generating 900 phone calls a day. "They sell nationally," Harper says, "but 
a lot of it is sold in Florida because there is a lot of wealth in this state." 
To be a success, a salesperson probably only has to get five or so new 
customers a day. 
</P>
<P>
Not all crooked stock dealers live in Florida. Feigin, the securities 
commissioner in Colorado, says his office's case load has increased 575% since 
1982. 
</P>
<P>
The First National Bank of Louisville (Ky.) may be out $10 million and Credit 
Suisse may have been taken for $5 million in the Haas Securities scandal, say 
sources familiar with the case . . . 
</P>
<P>
Tax experts have suggested that one way to help balance the federal budget 
deficit would be through an increase in the so-called sin taxes on liquor and 
tobacco. But the Beer Drinkers of America, a 50,000-person strong organization 
headquartered in Costa Mesa, thinks that idea is nothing but a lot of froth. 
The group -- which says it got some initial funding two years ago from 
Anheuser-Busch and Miller Brewing -- is initiating a national petition drive 
campaign to keep Congress' hands off its mugs.

We often use the terms "reining in" and "letting out" to describe the political 
climate in China. The fact is that what we mean by "letting out" is lifting up 
the bird cage cover, and what we mean by "reining in" is lowering the same 
cover. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Wang Ruowang, autumn, 1988 
</P>
<P>
Exactly two years have passed since the Chinese Communist Party launched its 
latest political campaign against intellectuals it perceived as too 
liberal-minded and anxious for political democratization. In January, 1987, the 
party expelled three controversial but eminently popular figures: Fang Lizhi, 
the internationally known astrophysicist who recently wrote an open letter to 
Deng Xiaoping asking for the release of Chinese political prisoners; Liu 
Binyan, the reporter/whistle-blower on party corruption, and Wang Ruowang, the 
satirical essayist, who is scorned by the authorities for his exceedingly 
audacious broadsides against the party and its pace of reform. All three are 
veterans of political persecution, having earlier been victims of China's much 
more noxious campaigns, and all have enjoyed the fruits of political 
rehabilitation under Deng Xiaoping's regime. Since Deng's resumption of power 
in the late 1970s, however, all have been equally subject to periodic, if 
relatively minor, campaigns against intellectuals critical of the status quo. 
</P>
<P>
Despite or because of this continuing victimization, Liu Binyan has gained a 
hero's status among the Chinese populace for his courageous exposure of the 
dark side of party ethics. Fang Lizhi has built an almost universal respect 
among Chinese students and other intellectuals for his liberal political 
philosophy, expressed openly during his vice presidency of one of China's 
leading science universities. Wang Ruowang, too, has had his audience, mainly 
in literary magazines, legal journals and newspapers, and by the mid-1980s, at 
the podiums of standing-room-only university halls. 
</P>
<P>
World reaction to the 1987 expulsion of these three men for their alleged 
encouragement of university student demonstrations in December, 1986, was swift 
and effective. In response to the international outrage that took Chinese 
government leaders by surprise in 1988, the authorities permitted Fang and Liu 
to travel abroad. Wang has been consistently denied permission to leave China, 
despite invitations from groups in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Wang is the oldest of the three and had been a party member longest -- 50 
years. Since his satirical criticism of the Kuomintang government in the 1930s 
(he was imprisoned as a youth of 16), Wang has always taken great pleasure in 
launching direct, humorous attacks against authority, speaking out for the 
underdog, advocating good over evil, "truth" over fiction and a change from the 
status quo. 
</P>
<P>
Liu became known outside China, in part, from the English translation of his 
reportage in the early 1980s by American China scholars, most notably E. Perry 
Link Jr. of UCLA. Fang was a noted figure to American scientists who worked 
with him during his 1986 research stint at Princeton's Institute for Advanced 
Study, among other places. Thus, Chinese leaders felt great pressure to be 
lenient with these two individuals. Wang, on the other hand, is less a 
household name to the general China-watcher; although this author has begun to 
introduce his views to an American audience, Wang's critical essays and pungent 
wit have not been given much international exposure. 
</P>
<P>
Wang's great popularity in China and Hong Kong has protected him from any sort 
of punishment even mildly resembling the prosecution of the Cultural 
Revolution. He is living comfortably in Shanghai, free to speak with foreigners 
and to publish once again, although he must still resort to publishing anything 
of a political nature outside of China. 
</P>
<P>
What follow are translated excerpts from a lengthy interview Wang recently 
granted to Chen Yige of the Nineties (a Hong Kong monthly magazine, December, 
1988). Here, he dispenses with his usual humor and wit, choosing instead to 
spell out a no-nonsense critique of the Chinese political and economic scene of 
the 1980s. The excerpts focus on Wang's view of the inevitable demise of the 
Chinese Communist Party and how the present government might even take a lesson 
from Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Does Wang advocate the demise of the Communist 
Party? One suspects not, but rather that he puts forth extreme views as a way 
to prod the Chinese leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Wang Ruowang is now 71 years old. These excerpts suggest that the youthful Wang 
who poked vicious fun at the nationalist government of Chiang Kai-shek in the 
early 1930s is very much alive -- in his own words, still "the naive" person he 
has always been, compelled to speak out despite the odds against him and his 
convictions. 
</P>
<P>
For clarity, I have grouped these excerpts topically; the subtitles are my own. 
</P>
<P>
The Advantages of Capitalist Democracies and the Hypocrisy of Socialism: 
</P>
<P>
Capitalist political democracy is an intelligent and noble system. It has the 
function of regulating contradictions among different classes and it bestows 
upon each political party equal rights to free elections and free activities. 
Yet in socialist countries ruled by proletarian dictatorship, these superior 
features not only do not exist, they are perceived as reactionary and are 
summarily rejected. 
</P>
<P>
The character of the Russian and later the Chinese Revolution was not actually 
proletarian at all. The proletariat in these two countries has not obtained any 
of the rights accorded to masters of one's own country, since even the labor 
unions are run by the state. 
</P>
<P>
Wherever the socialist model of state ownership has been implemented, people 
have become destitute and the nation backward. We must have the courage to 
discard this harmful model. Ready-made models are all around us . . . . All we 
have to do is let go of two premises: that the leadership of the Communist 
Party is infallible, and that socialism is wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
 The Party's Road to Self-Destruction: 
</P>
<P>
I think the Chinese Communist Party is in the process of accelerating its own 
decline. Perhaps it's more accurate to say that it is in a crisis of being down 
on all fours, neither dead nor alive. There is a new concept, new for China, at 
least, that asks, "Why should a whole nation and a whole people die because of 
the degeneration and deterioration of one party?" In a multiparty nation, if a 
party has lost the support of the people, its organization disintegrates, but 
this does not affect the everyday political and economic workings of the 
country. The party doesn't get elected and no longer participates in politics 
and that's the end of it. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back at the wounds left by Mao on modern Chinese history, one must 
agree that his series of perverse acts and policies paved the way for the death 
of the Chinese Communist Party. Even today, what we have is the implementation 
of the Maoist line without Mao Tse-tung. The regime won't tamper with the 
Mao-era system of one-party, one-man rule. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing that people are very dissatisfied with is the fact that the party 
leaders can't be trusted to tell the truth. They say one thing and do another. 
Take this year's National Day editorial, for example. Recognizing how alienated 
they've become from the masses, the editorial was entitled "Our strength is in 
the masses." On the very same day . . . the Public Security Bureau entered 
university and college campuses to set up police stations and permanent 
public-security organizations. This was a clear case of deeds betraying words. 
</P>
<P>
 The Problem with the Current Reform Strategy: 
</P>
<P>
 To regulate the economic environment without attempting to improve the old 
political system of one-party dictatorship is like walking on one leg, like 
sending an isolated force into enemy territory. 
</P>
<P>
After five years of purging within the party ranks, there are still no results. 
Can corruption be conquered by relying on the Maoist practice of sending down 
work groups, survey groups, price investigators and the like? Making this a 
temporary task by ferreting out a few corrupt elements and making a big deal 
about nabbing one or two major cases and imposing heavy sentences on these few, 
while not dealing with serious corruption at the roots, only creates the 
following: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Loud thunder, small rain: things get better for a while, then spout up 
again as soon as the rain tapers off. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The bottom gets purged while the top is left alone; a few living targets 
are nabbed as an example, a few companies whose papers are not complete are 
decapitated while large powerful companies that perpetrate outrageous crimes go 
their merry way. 
</P>
<P>
Honest advice is grating on the ears. I suspect that these words from the heart 
of an expelled former party figure will not sit well with the higher-ups. I 
would be forever grateful if only they do not censure me for inciting student 
demonstrations again. 
</P>
<P>
 In Reform, Learn From Gorbachev: 
</P>
<P>
 I think Gorbachev's reform strategy is worth emulating. The Soviet Union is 
under a socialist system whose source is the same as our own. Its bureaucratic 
system of stagnant cadres, leader worship, extreme leftist thinking and corrupt 
perversions of the law are particularly deep-seated and are much more serious 
than our own. 
</P>
<P>
The difficulties of Soviet reforms are much greater than China's, and they 
began their reforms six to seven years later than ours. But Gorbachev . . . has 
clearly laid out the aims of reform and defined the unavoidable ideological 
struggles. Second, he is purging the top rather than the bottom . . . in stark 
contrast to our reforms, which have purged those below rather than those at the 
top -- the feet rather than the head. 
</P>
<P>
Third, Gorbachev is stressing political openness and encouraging public 
participation in policy-making and unrestrained criticism and discussion, 
relying first on intellectuals and granting large-scale freedom to previously 
shackled newspapers, television, film, literature and art. 
</P>
<P>
Fourth, he is thoroughly repudiating Stalin's wholesale murder of Bolsheviks 
and rehabilitating all wronged victims. 
</P>
<P>
China, too, has rehabilitated the unjustly accused. This good deed cannot be 
overlooked. But at the same time, we protect the very instigators of these 
trumped up cases and we do not punish the inhumane accomplices who helped 
fabricate them to begin with. This perpetrates the impression that bad people 
are, as always, in the right, and human-rights abuses are nothing to be ashamed 
of.

WHEN THE U.S. DROPS ITS DEFENSES

<TEXT>
<P>
When Japan began to overtake the United States as the West's leading financial 
power in the 1980s, Americans consoled themselves that U.S. military and 
defense-industry leadership, at least, was undisputed. Japan and West Germany 
couldn't challenge us there. Not with the constraining memories of World War II 
-- of Messerschmitts over the white cliffs of Dover and Mitsubishis over 
Corregidor. 
</P>
<P>
The extraordinary probability of the 1990s, however, is that the company 
manufacturing Messerschmitts may be the world's largest aerospace corporation, 
and the firm making Mitsubishis may not be far behind. The larger U.S. 
predicament is just as unnerving: a slow global decline going beyond individual 
perils -- lost electronics markets, slumping military exports and threatened 
worldwide U.S. military base closings -- to the infrastructure of U.S. defense 
preparedness. 
</P>
<P>
The domestic and international consequences of this dislocation could be huge. 
Jobs, technology and even future U.S. elections may be at risk. Aircraft and 
weapons systems now built in Burbank, Calif., and Bethpage, N.Y., may be 
replaced by others built far, far away. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. defense industry is beginning to suffer from adverse international 
trends not unlike those whipsawing other U.S. industries. Foreign competitors 
have been taking over overseas military and aerospace markets. Between 1982 and 
1987, for example, military exports dropped by about 60% -- from $22 billion to 
just $9 billion. "Large sales agreements . . . have virtually disappeared," 
retiring Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci admitted in a recent report to 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Countries such as Brazil and Israel have built a good business with Third World 
nations that would rather not buy from a great power like the United States. 
The United States is also losing international leverage from foreign military 
aid cutbacks: Countries getting less U.S. aid buy less U.S. equipment. There's 
also no denying rising overseas disenchantment with local U.S. military bases 
and operational tie-ins with the U.S. military. Portugal, Spain, Greece, Turkey 
and the Philippines are all squeezing or terminating U.S. base arrangements -- 
which usually means less reliance on U.S. equipment. It's a little bit like the 
pullback of the Roman Empire 1,500 years ago. Rome, too, probably started 
losing local armor, chariot and catapult markets. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the threat doesn't end there. Countries that gained economic 
clout in the 1980s, such as Japan and West Germany, are getting interested in 
military production and commercial markets. They will let the United States 
carry the strategic and financial burdens of Atlantic and Pacific defense, but 
they want more of the commercial profits. If that sounds like a bad deal for 
the United States -- it is. 
</P>
<P>
But it's also the emerging reality. West Germany's Daimler-Benz, already in the 
aircraft business through its Dornier unit, is now acquiring 
Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm, the country's leading aerospace concern. Taking 
over MBB would make Daimler a $46 billion-a-year firm, much larger than the top 
U.S. aerospace giants -- Boeing and United Technologies. And that's just the 
beginning of Daimler's ambitions. Company chairman Edzard Reuter recently said 
he would like to build ties and even cross-shareholdings with French, British 
and Italian defense contractors -- such as British Aerospace, Aerospatiale and 
Dassault. The objective? To promote European integration and outpace U.S. 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
Even the Japanese, limited by their constitution to defense outlays of just 1% 
of gross national product, are getting bigger ideas. It's not that Tokyo wants 
a large Pacific military role; Uncle Sam can keep furnishing -- and paying for 
-- the defense umbrella, thank you. It's the neo-mercantile potential. Japanese 
strategists are starting to suspect they might be able to take over military 
equipment markets the way they've grabbed global consumer electronics markets. 
</P>
<P>
The numbers are scary. Back in October, several U.S. media published highlights 
from a confidential private sector memo circulating in Tokyo. Its author 
concluded that if manufacturing giants such as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, 
Toshiba and Ishikawajima-Harima were to start exporting the aircraft and 
weapons they now build for Japan's small armed forces, the economic payoff 
could be enormous. In less than a decade, the memo said, Japan could control 
45% of the world's tank and motorized artillery market, 40% of military 
electronics purchases, 30% of the aerospace market and 60% of warship 
construction. Nervous U.S. policy-makers privately worry that any such Japanese 
emergence in armaments would not only jeopardize American defense capabilities 
but would threaten the already thin U.S. edge over foreign rivals in basic 
technologies. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon, for its part, is so concerned about defense production based in 
the United States migrating overseas -- like other manufacturing -- that it's 
relaxing the unofficial rules regarding foreign takeovers of U.S. defense 
contractors. Up to a point, they will now be permitted -- except where West 
German and Japanese firms are involved. Besides lingering World War II 
sensitivities, U.S. policy-makers -- and voters -- have been offended by two 
recent episodes: a subsidiary of Japan's Toshiba Corp. sold secret military 
technology to the Soviet Union, and a small West German chemical firm, 
Imhausen-Chemie, was helping Moammar Kadafi build a chemical warfare plant in 
Libya. 
</P>
<P>
None of this, however, is stopping one of Messerschmitt's U.S. subsidiaries -- 
Conventional Munition Systems Inc. -- from emerging as a prime subcontractor to 
General Dynamics on key missile programs. Its president, a retired U.S. 
general, recently said U.S. subsidiaries of foreign companies would be allowed 
to take over defense subcontracting because, "Congress is afraid of the same 
thing I'm afraid of -- the migration of our technology and skills overseas." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Congress is simultaneously afraid of giving away U.S. technology as the 
unacceptable cost of negotiating joint military production deals -- like the 
one just made between General Dynamics and Mitsubishi to co-produce Japan's new 
jet fighter. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, alas, is there may not be any real "best interest" left after the 
financial recklessness and false "Morning Again in America" of the 1980s. The 
Japanese won't just buy U.S.-made fighter planes -- being our principal 
creditor, they no longer have to. As a concomitant of lending the United States 
so much money to fund its various deficits, Tokyo can demand better commercial 
arrangements -- conceivably insuring that disadvantageous U.S. technology 
transfer will be yet another ramification of Reagan-era budget deficitry. 
</P>
<P>
In a direct military sense, of course, Japan can't displace the United States 
as the leading Pacific military power -- and scarcely wants to. The longer the 
United States maintains that role, going deeper into debt to Tokyo to protect 
what is becoming a Japanese commercial sphere of influence, the more Japan can 
consolidate its emergence as the world's leading financial and trading power. 
Some Americans recognize this. One expert, Clyde V. Prestowitz, former 
counselor to the Commerce Department in the Reagan years, lamented, "This is 
surely the first time in history that a territory in the process of being 
colonized (the United States) has actually paid for the right to defend the 
colonizer (Japan)." 
</P>
<P>
Exactly. And until today's U.S. economic and strategic laxity changes, defense 
and aerospace power, together with its supporting commercial infrastructure, 
could well ebb away just as surely as the manufacture of televisions, toasters 
and textiles. 
</P>
<P>
Back in the early '80s, when hard times devastated Pennsylvania steel towns and 
Carolina textile mills, top Reagan Administration officials all but shrugged 
off that pain as the price of progress. The United States wasn't in trouble. 
America's future lay in high-tech, so low-tech industries had to downsize. Six 
or seven years later, however, it's these high-tech future industries that are 
squirming as laissez-faire U.S. capitalism goes head-to-head with the 
state-guided -- or state-supported -- capitalism of Europe and East Asia. Too 
many industries have been strangling in the Adam Smith ties worn by Reagan 
free-marketeers; now they're openly calling for Washington help or research 
collaboration -- in semiconductors, biotechnology, superconductors, 
supercomputers and even high-definition TV. 
</P>
<P>
It all adds up to a threat the new Administration has to take serously. Without 
tough-minded economic strategic thinking, there's the possibility that morning 
again for Messerschmitt and Mitsubishi could turn out to be sunset for Santa 
Clara and bedtime for Burbank.

TALKING PEACE AND TRADING GOODS: A FORMULA FOR U.S. MIDEAST POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Howard R. Teicher, Howard R. Teicher was on the National Security Council 
staff, directing political-military and Middle Eastern issues, from 1982 to 
1987.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite the understandable desire to move cautiously in formulating foreign 
policy, the Bush Administration's early priority will almost certainly be the 
Arab-Israeli conflict. 
</P>
<P>
With escalating tension between Israelis and Palestinians, pressure for a U.S. 
peace initiative is growing. The U.S. dialogue with the Palestine Liberation 
Organization has already set in motion political forces that will test 
bipartisanship between the President and Congress. Israeli and Arab leaders 
both seek early meetings with the Bush Administration; the European allies push 
their own peace initiatives. Meanwhile, the grisly resurgence of Middle East 
terrorism, aimed at disrupting the peace process, has begun. 
</P>
<P>
To contain these pressures and move the peace process forward, the United 
States must ensure its two fundamental interests in the Middle East: the 
deterrence of war and peaceful relations between Egypt and Israel. No peace 
initiative can hope to succeed without these cornerstones of U.S. policy. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration must assume that Arab radicals will do all they can to 
sabotage the process -- for peace in the Middle East always seems tentative. 
</P>
<P>
Syria remains the Arab state most capable of preventing peace -- whether by 
overt military means or its support of international terrorism. Although 
Damascus has softened its rhetoric -- perhaps reflecting new signals from 
Moscow -- deterrence can never be taken for granted. Washington should have no 
doubts about Syria's ability to undermine any peace process it does not 
support. Though President Hafez Assad has always been careful to preserve a 
peace option, he has never been ambiguous about resisting any initiative he did 
not approve. It is worth recalling the U.S. experience in Lebanon to ensure 
mistakes are not repeated. 
</P>
<P>
Assad was consistent and determined to defeat U.S. policy in Lebanon in 
1983-1984. During Secretary of State George P. Shultz's shuttle diplomacy after 
the April, 1983, bombing of the U.S. Embassy, the Lebanese foreign minister 
reported, with grim foreboding, having failed to convince Assad that the 
agreement between Lebanon and Israel would benefit Syrian interests. On the 
contrary, Assad warned, "there was nothing good in the agreement, and that the 
Lebanese government should just remember what happened to (Anwar) Sadat." 
</P>
<P>
In fall, 1983, Syrian-backed military and terrorist pressure against Beirut 
culminated with the bombings of the U.S. and French barracks. Caught up in a 
political struggle in Washington, the United States talked tough but failed to 
act. So Syria grew bolder -- firing surface-to-air missiles at U.S. 
reconnaissance aircraft while increasing the level of combat in Beirut and its 
environs. 
</P>
<P>
By February, 1984, the multinational force had left Beirut. Damascus resumed 
its pre-eminent position. 
</P>
<P>
It had taken less than one year for Assad to defeat U.S. policy in Lebanon and 
fulfill his earlier warning. Syria fought and won a limited war with the United 
States. Now as then, the United States cannot afford to overlook Syrian 
interests and Assad's capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
Today, though seemingly bogged down in Lebanon, the Syrians have, in fact, 
improved their military capabilities qualitatively and quantitatively. Advanced 
MIG-29 aircraft, a modernized and expanded surface-to-air missile network, 
expanding inventories of accurate SS-21 ballistic missiles and thousands of 
T-72 tanks contribute to Assad's declared goal of "strategic parity" -- Syria 
would be able fight Israel without any Arab partners. 
</P>
<P>
Syria's relationship with its principal patron, the Soviet Union, has changed. 
Most significant, Michael S. Gorbachev recently advised Assad that strategic 
parity between Syria and Israel is not obtainable for political and economic 
reasons. Damascus now grumbles that Moscow no longer fulfills all its equipment 
requests -- and acts as it sees fit. 
</P>
<P>
For example, when the Soviet Union refused Syria's request for equipment to 
manufacture chemical weapons, the Syrians turned to West Germany. Yet Syria 
remains Moscow's most important ally in the region. 
</P>
<P>
As in Lebanon, Syria will not hesitate to use force to advance its political 
objectives against Yasser Arafat or other Arabs, Israelis or whomever. 
President George Bush, together with Congress, must determine how to persuade 
Syria to desist from its spoiler role. Washington should not assume that the 
Soviets alone can discourage Assad from using violence. 
</P>
<P>
Several steps should be taken to advance U.S. interests. First, the United 
States should resume a high-level dialogue with Syria. While making the U.S. 
interest in cooperation with Syria clear, there can be no ambiguity regarding 
Washington's readiness to use whatever measures are needed to deter violence. 
Second, U.S.-Soviet Middle East talks should be narrowly focused, both to 
ensure that every effort is made to avoid an Israeli-Syrian war and to 
determine an acceptable format for an international peace conference. Third, 
the United States must maintain arms sales and economic support for Israel, 
while reinforcing bilateral strategic cooperation. Similarly, U.S. arms sales 
to Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia should proceed, enhancing these states' 
confidence in U.S. steadfastness and their own ability to defend against 
radical threats. 
</P>
<P>
The second cornerstone, peace between Egypt and Israel, is a vital U.S. 
interest. The restoration of Egypt's historic leadership role in the Arab 
world, when combined with peace with Israel, provides Washington with important 
political advantage in efforts to broaden the peace process. Indeed, Arafat's 
recognition of Israel vindicates Egypt's 10-year peace policy, creating new 
opportunities for U.S. and Egyptian diplomacy in the Arab world and Israel. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most important postwar achievements, peace between Egypt and Israel, 
excited hopes that stability and prosperity would encourage other Arabs to join 
the peace process. Unfortunately, Egyptian and Israeli expectations of how the 
other should act -- politically and economically -- have gone unfulfilled, and 
relations continue to deteriorate. This situation weakens the ability of 
Americans, Europeans and others to convince Israelis that compromises for peace 
are worth the risks. 
</P>
<P>
From the Israeli perspective, occasional acts of violence by Egyptians against 
Israelis, the Egyptian media's generally harsh treatment of Israel and the 
minimal scale of Egyptian-Israeli trade and commerce have reinforced Israeli 
skepticism about the value of political agreements with Arab states. 
</P>
<P>
From the Egyptian perspective, however, Israel has no cause for complaint. 
Israel was never promised a special relationship and, to Cairo's way of 
thinking, does not deserve it. In the years since the signing of the peace 
treaty, Israeli policy in the West Bank, Gaza, Lebanon and other places has not 
endeared Israel to the Egyptian government or people. 
</P>
<P>
Many Americans and Israelis hoped that the economic area, in particular, would 
blossom with the normalization of relations. It has not -- though the potential 
for business cooperation is huge. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration must try to break down Israel-Egypt economic barriers to 
halt further erosion of relations. Trade can help cultivate trust and offer 
greater economic achievement to each country. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of trade is only partially a result of politics. The two economies are 
in very different stages of development, further exacerbating prospects for 
cooperation even where there are complementarities -- such as in tourism, 
agriculture, energy and some technical service and product manufacturing areas. 
Neither the Egyptian nor the Israel national economies have been restructured 
with a view toward doing business with the other, but certain problems could be 
overcome with sustained effort. 
</P>
<P>
In the financial area, it is difficult for both Egyptians and Israelis to 
arrange credit facilities to finance trade and other projects. But financial 
problems are subject to government intervention. The United States could 
encourage steps in both countries to enhance availability and terms of credit 
for conducting business. For example, more Egyptian banks could be authorized 
to finance Israeli imports. There is only one bank in all Egypt now authorized 
to do this. 
</P>
<P>
In the political arena, Egypt could relax visa requirements for Egyptian 
businessmen traveling to Israel, while expediting import licenses for Israeli 
products into Egypt. For their part, Israelis could offer incentives to 
Egyptian manufactureres who work with Israelis, taking advantage of the 
U.S.-Israel Free Trade Agreement and Israel's membership in the European 
Economic Community. 
</P>
<P>
Although the international community has grown used to peace between Egypt and 
Israel, neither country's citizens have grown used to each other. The low-key 
steps outlined here could change this situation while encouraging others in the 
Middle East to realize that peace makes economic sense. 
</P>
<P>
The deterrence of violence against the proponents of a peaceful settlement of 
the Arab-Israeli conflict and the improvement of Egyptian-Israeli relations 
require a sustained U.S. effort for the next few years. The ability to bring 
Palestinians, Israelis and others to the negotiating table is tied to the 
achievement of these two objectives. For not only will the foundation of the 
U.S. position in the Middle East be reinforced, Washington's ability to deal 
effectively with the challenges of the peace process will be much improved.

A SHAKY SHIITE TRUCE AND SYRIA'S QUEST FOR RESPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

DAMASCUS, SYRIA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The peace accord in Lebanon's civil war is not likely to endure, for this 
intra-Shiite struggle between the Amal and Hezbollah militias is dominated by 
tendencies and interests reaching far beyond Lebanon. As one cynical realist 
put it: "Such accords in Lebanon are signed with special slow-drying ink to 
give the enemies a long rest period." 
</P>
<P>
The resumption of fighting between the pro-Syrian Amal and the pro-Iranian 
Hezbollah is all but inevitable, even though the accord, executed in Damascus 
on Jan. 30, was signed in the presence of the Syrian and Iranian foreign 
ministers who sponsored it. This is an old, deep and bitter conflict between 
brothers in which a lot of blood has been spilled: Indeed one of the most 
contentious, though unwritten, items in the agreement was the exchange of 
gunmen accused of recently killing top leaders on the other side. 
</P>
<P>
The elaborate eight-point agreement will fail because under its terms neither 
side has to disarm or leave entrenched positions in the southern slum suburbs 
of Beirut and the hills southeast of Sidon in southern Lebanon. The accord 
stipulates that Amal will "assure security responsibilities in south Lebanon," 
but each side would have the right to initiate "individual operations" against 
Israel -- meaning that Hezbollah retains its separate military presence in the 
south, the one thing Amal tried to destroy. 
</P>
<P>
The dictum once laid down by Chou en-Lai applies: "You will not get at the 
conference table more than you have gained on the battlefield." And Amal, which 
claims victory, did not defeat Hezbollah because the Hezbollah militiamen are 
prepared to fight to the death, unlike their Amal enemies. This is but one of 
the many fundamental differences between the two groups. 
</P>
<P>
Amal is a large popular movement, devoted primarily to the social and economic 
uplift of the Shiite community -- now Lebanon's largest at 1.2 million persons. 
Amal's members are devout Shiites, but as Lebanese nationalists they are 
prepared to be one element in a balanced, pluralistic country. That makes them 
allies of Syria, which wants the same sort of Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah is a much smaller grouping of fiercely militant Shiites whose main 
objective is to set up in all or part of Lebanon a replica of Iran's Islamic 
revolutionary regime. Amal is led by civilians, like the lawyer Nabih Berri; 
Hezbollah's leaders are turbaned, bearded clerics and the custodians of mosques 
and prayer halls. 
</P>
<P>
Berri, in an editorial in his party newspaper last week, violently denounced 
Iran's minister of interior, Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, whom he accused of being the 
creator and present leader of Hezbollah. Mohtashemi founded the group, Berri 
said, on the same lines as Savak, the shah's notorious secret police; he had 
recruited criminals into its ranks and they had committed armed robberies, 
kidnapings and murders and, worst of all, acts of terrorism. In Lebanon, Berri 
concluded, Hezbollah's sole aim was to destroy Amal and not, as claimed, to 
defend Islam or to fight Israel. 
</P>
<P>
The Amal-Hezbollah agreement cannot endure because its sponsoring powers, Syria 
and Iran, formerly and formally allies, are now increasingly at odds. This 
became especially apparent after Iraq defeated Iran in the Gulf War, when Iran 
was obliged to accept a cease-fire last July. 
</P>
<P>
Syria soon afterward began to feel uneasy in its alliance with non-Arab Iran, 
which had made it unpopular with fellow Arabs. A link with a seemingly 
victorious friend was one thing; an alliance with a defeated country was 
something else. Syria has been slowly distancing itself from Iran. 
</P>
<P>
What is worse for Syria is that there are important sections of Iran's regime 
-- led by Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri, the designated successor to the 
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and Mohtashemi -- that refuse to accept defeat and 
continue efforts to export the Islamic revolution, which is why they continue 
to support Hezbollah in a final desperate attempt to expand Shiite power beyond 
Iran. 
</P>
<P>
This adventurism from a defeated Iran has not been to Syria's liking, because 
after the heavy blow of Iran's defeat and its inability to impose a Pax Syriana 
on the fractious Lebanese -- in short because of its increasing isolation -- 
Syria has turned to moderation. It has been trying to achieve a position of 
world respectability, abjuring terrorism and attempting to obtain the release 
of Western hostages in Lebanon held by the Hezbollahis who refuse to release 
them without a substantial Western quid pro quo. Syria's ultimate objective now 
is to be seen as so conciliatory that it would qualify as a full member of an 
international peace conference on the Middle East, which might return the 
Israeli-occupied Golan Heights to Hafez Assad's government. 
</P>
<P>
There are also elements in the Khomeini regime that, after the defeat, have 
become relatively moderate and pragmatic, under the leadership of Hashemi 
Rafsanjani, the Speaker of Parliament. But they are not in complete control and 
are having a difficult time maintaining their policy line in Tehran against the 
militants. The negotiations in Damascus were much delayed because the 
contending factions in the Iranian delegation often had to consult with Tehran, 
where the government's position was hashed out. Syria and Amal can never be 
certain that the activists in Tehran may not occasionally prevail over the 
moderates and, despite the fragile Damascus agreement, reactivate Hezbollah in 
Lebanon. So the release of the more important of the Western hostages will not 
come soon. 
</P>
<P>
Syria's new-found quest for respectability and moderation has brought a strange 
alliance between the Palestine Liberation Organization, Amal and, through Amal, 
Syria. The PLO, after declaring its Palestinian state and its peace offensive, 
has for the time being eschewed violence outside Israel. So like Syria and 
Amal, but unlike Hezbollah, the PLO does not want attacks on Israel from 
southern Lebanon; it has quietly sided with Amal during the past few weeks. A 
year ago it was Hezbollah that backed the PLO when Amal, aided by Syria, was 
pursuing its prolonged and brutal war against the Palestinian camps in Beirut 
and the south. The PLO has also learned that there are no permanent friendships 
-- only permanent interests.

MISINFORMATION ON AIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The criticism arrayed against an AIDS anti-discrimination ordinance pending 
before theLos Angeles County Board of Supervisors demonstrated, if there were 
any lingering doubts, the importance of the new protections. Clearly, 
misinformation and prejudice are still rife. 
</P>
<P>
In election after election a large majority of the voters of the county and of 
California have demonstrated understanding of the disease, generally rejecting 
extreme measures like Proposition 102 in the general election last November. 
But a small group in the community has continued to encourage prejudice and 
discrimination -- often out of ignorance, sometimes out of hostility to 
homosexuals and intravenous drug users, two of the groups most affected by the 
deadly disease. 
</P>
<P>
Some who have challenged the county ordinance have argued that its protections 
for those with the human immunodeficiency virus in effect would force others to 
become exposed. Others, including some health-care providers, have asserted 
that the ordinance would force doctors and nurses to be exposed to the disease. 
</P>
<P>
That is simply not true. The protections afforded under the ordinance would 
affect work, housing and access to public places -- none of which would risk 
infection to others. HIV is hard to transmit. It can be transmitted only by an 
exchange of bodily fluids or blood, as in sexual intercourse or a transfusion 
of contaminated blood or the sharing of intravenous drug needles that carry the 
infection. All of the responsible professional health-care organizations have 
affirmed the responsibility of professionals to provide care to those with the 
virus. The ordinance would do nothing to change that. Furthermore, the 
established safeguards mandated for health-care workers to guard against 
accidental infection also are protections against hepatitis, which in fact 
takes a far greater toll of professionals than the extremely small number who 
have been infected with HIV through accidental exposure. 
</P>
<P>
Protections against discrimination were recommended by the Presidential 
Commission on the Human Immunodeficiency Virus Epidemic because they are 
essential to effective public-health programs. People at risk will not 
cooperate with prevention programs if they are not provided protection against 
discrimination. The city of Los Angeles already has in place an even more 
effective ordinance. Other cities and counties have done the same. The need in 
Los Angeles County, with the second-highest incidence of the disease in the 
nation, is the more urgent in the absence of adequate state and federal 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
A majority made up of Chairman Ed Edelman, Deane Dana and Kenneth Hahn are 
supporting this measure before the Board of Supervisors. They are making an 
important contribution to the effort to control the spread of the disease.

'STANDING FIRM ON MEDICARE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We hope congressional leaders do stand firm on the Medicare expansion laws. 
</P>
<P>
We cannot understand the blindness of our fellow-Medicare recipients. The 
additional services, added to the comparatively generous Medicare coverage, 
should be financed by the beneficiaries themselves. And this is being handled 
in an equitable manner based on ability to pay, and will not unfairly burden 
the indigent. 
</P>
<P>
If these dissenters would stop and compare costs of the new law against prior 
Medicare coverage along with private supplementary insurance, or even the total 
private medical insurance without Medicare, they would realize what a bargain 
this plan is. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, we hope that the American Assn. of Retired Persons, who initially 
instigated this legislation, does not back down because of the yammering of 
some malcontents who demand too large a slice of the shrinking American 
economic pie.

'STANDING FIRM ON MEDICARE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite your editorial ("Standing Firm on Medicare," Jan. 30) support for the 
Catastrophic Medicare Act, it needs to be amended in several respects. 
</P>
<P>
It does not address the real problem of long-term nursing care -- in fact, it 
exacerbates it. Physicians will be pressured by patients and their families to 
keep them in hospitals (at no cost) instead of releasing them to nursing homes 
or home care. In other words, services follow money. 
</P>
<P>
It destroys the basic concept of Social Security and Medicare that all employed 
persons and all taxpayers share the costs of these programs. 
</P>
<P>
Disability beneficiaries under age 65 pay nothing. 
</P>
<P>
While Congress is talking of increasing taxes to reduce the federal deficit, it 
has already imposed a 15% income surtax on the aged this year, increasing to 
28% in 1993. Only if all their medical providers accept Medicare assignment, 
however, will their costs be limited to this staggering increase. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Los Angeles) wrote an article, "Neglecting What 
the Elderly Need Most," which appeared in the June 7, 1988, issue of the 
Washington Post. He wrote, in part, "Congress ought to go back to square one 
and take a good hard look at what our nation's most pressing health care needs 
really are and what options we have for paying for them." 
</P>
<P>
I agree.

Sen. Bentsen claims that the complaints about his Catastrophic Tax Act come 
from "wealthier people who . . . want to be subsidized by the rest of the 
taxpayers." 
</P>
<P>
Not at all. As usual, it's the middle class who are not happy about subsidizing 
both the poor and the rich. This surtax on the elderly begins with people who 
make only about $14,000 a year. It goes up to about $45,000 a year and then 
stops. 
</P>
<P>
Above that level, thanks to the cap, as your income increases your surtax rate 
decreases. That is, if you make $90,000 a year, you will pay the exact amount 
paid by the man whose income is $45,000; so your surtax rate is half as much as 
his. If your income is $180,000 a year, your surtax rate is one-fourth as much 
as that of the man with $45,000 because you pay the same number of dollars that 
he must pay. 
</P>
<P>
During the recent campaign, Bentsen told the middle class he was "on our side." 
As it turns out, he was really behind our back.

THE SHOCKING CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The tragic case of Lisa Steinberg cries out for closer attention to other cases 
of child abuse, one of the most shocking crimes in America. The victims are so 
young, so dependent on the ability of adults to restrain rage, and so 
defenseless when mental illness, drugs, alcohol or other pressures render 
adults incapable of that restraint. Lisa Steinberg's father, convicted of 
manslaughter in her brutal death, seemed outwardly a successful person. The 
case is an all-too-vivid reminder that child abuse obeys no economic 
boundaries. It occurs in middle-class apartments, even when neighbors suspect 
what is happening, as well as in urban slums or isolated farmhouses where no 
one is watching. 
</P>
<P>
Americans are more aware of child abuse today than they were a decade or two 
ago, but the ability of social services to cope with the problem has not kept 
pace with awareness. Social workers often have such heavy caseloads that they 
cannot pursue every report or watch out for every child. 
</P>
<P>
Even when social workers are aware of potential or actual child abuse, they 
must contend with society's basic belief that children belong with their 
parents and that aberrant behavior can be changed. If they don't act, they risk 
the life of the child and possible lawsuits. Sometimes they do act based on 
potential risk, as occurred when a 2-month old child was taken away from his 
parents in Polk County, Iowa, last year. But in those cases government is in 
effect judging some people as unfit parents based on past behavior that may 
indeed have been changed. Social agencies can't possibly remove all the 
children in homes where parents abuse drugs or alcohol; where does one draw the 
line? 
</P>
<P>
When a social worker's instinct says that a child should be removed from his 
home, and from harm's way, it is often impossible to find proper alternative 
shelter. Los Angeles County, for example, has too few foster-care homes. In 
fact, across the country the majority of the 1.6 million children abused in 
1986 did not receive protective services because local agencies didn't have 
enough money to provide them, according to a report by the House Select 
Committee on Children, Youth and Families. 
</P>
<P>
Communities and individuals around the country do what they can to supplement 
government efforts. In Santa Monica, for example, Stuart House coordinates 
medical, psychological and law-enforcement aid for children who have been 
sexually abused. These efforts require dedicated individuals and compassionate 
financial donors. Imitation would be more than flattery; it would mean hope for 
children whose lives may otherwise be hopelessly marred. 
</P>
<P>
There is no apparent quick cure for a national plague that afflicts so many 
young people and kills too many like Lisa Steinberg. But governments, 
individuals and foundations must continue to strive where they can to curb the 
causes and ease the pain. Shining the spotlight on the dark corners of life, as 
the Steinberg trial has done, exposes sickness but may have a healing effect as 
well.

CATS IN CAIRO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Cat's Meow Drives Cairo to Distraction" (Part I, Jan. 24) -- a most 
interesting article -- but with a little misinformation. 
</P>
<P>
Cats may not be held in the same high regard today as they were once by some 
Egyptians, but Egyptians who own pets are pet lovers. Just ask any camel, dog 
or cat. Numerous shops in the bazaar of Cairo have their own cat -- and they 
are well-groomed and fat. 
</P>
<P>
Along the Nile, horse-drawn carriages all have clover for the horses. Every 
camel, every animal of the field, all are well-fed, washed daily and all are 
considered a member of the family. 
</P>
<P>
As for the "kitten on the keys" who disrupted the piano recital. I read this 
portion of your report to my own cat, an Abyssinian (who thinks she is 
descended from early Egyptian cats -- a fact yet to be verified) and she 
reminded me that centuries ago many Egyptians believed in reincarnation. Many 
of those who left their first life returned -- and in many cases -- returned as 
a cat. 
</P>
<P>
The kitten at the piano recital was not a stray intruder -- not a prowler in 
the night. That kitten, as my cat reminded me, was probably a music critic in 
its former life.

DEATH PENALTY AND ABORTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to Conrad's cartoon regarding the "supposed" inconsistency of an 
individual who is both pro-life and pro-capital punishment (Jan. 26), as one 
such individual, it seems apparent to me that the entire debate surrounds one 
single issue -- responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
An individual who is convicted of killing another human being and is sentenced 
to death must accept the consequences of his behavior. He made the decision 
before committing the crime and must not be allowed to shirk all responsibility 
for his actions. 
</P>
<P>
In a similar way, before a man and a woman engage in sexual intercourse they 
know there is a chance that the woman might become impregnated. Yet abortion is 
so often used as a way of avoiding responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, there is a major difference -- an individual who commits murder had a 
choice, babies in the womb have none. They should be given the right to choose 
and nobody has the right to decide for them.

CALIFORNIA HIGH COURT NEEDS FEMALE PERSPECTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE KAMENIR-REZNIK, Janice Kamenir-Reznik, an attorney in Sherman Oaks, 
is president of California Women Lawyers, a statewide women lawyers 
organization. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The vacancy on the California Supreme Court caused by Justice John A. 
Arguelles' pending retirement has sparked concern among many Californians 
relative to the lack of female presence on the state's highest court. Gov. 
Deukmejian is well aware of this concern -- he has placed two women on the list 
of four final candidates he is considering to fill this vacancy. Female 
representation on the California Supreme Court is important because of power 
that is endemic to that institution. 
</P>
<P>
The California Supreme Court's power is not merely an issue of academic 
concern, and its opinions are important not only to the community of lawyers, 
judges and legal scholars. Rather, the impact of the court's opinions reaches 
to the grass roots and, indeed, governs each of our lives on a daily basis. The 
court's holdings affect blacks, Latinos, Asians and whites; the rulings affect 
the young, the middle-aged and the old; the law governs the behavior of men and 
women. 
</P>
<P>
Few would disagree that the court should be sensitive to the varying needs and 
experiences of all of the diverse groups that make up the society governed by 
its laws. When one of the so-called minorities to be governed -- namely, women 
-- constitutes more than 50% of the state's population, there exists the fair 
expectation for participation in the governing and decision-making process. And 
such participation is fundamental both to the integration of women into society 
and for the very integration of society itself. Moreover, participation by 
women in government, at all levels, is the only manner to ensure women's 
equality in society. 
</P>
<P>
Men and women are different. The differences are not only a biological axiom; 
the important differences between men and women emanate from sociological and 
environmental factors. While we might strive to eliminate these sociologically 
and environmentally caused sex differences, they exist. When a baby girl is 
born, the nurses place her in a pink bassinet. Generally, as the child matures, 
girls practice ballet or gymnastics while boys play football and basketball. 
</P>
<P>
The color of a baby's bassinet or the particular physical activity in which a 
child is engaged may appear to be insignificant issues. However, for better or 
worse, boys and girls are treated differently, and they carry these differences 
with them as they mature into adulthood. 
</P>
<P>
The perspective of a woman, whatever her particular political outlook, will be 
different from the perspective of a man, just as the perspective of a black 
will be different from the perspective of a white, or the perspective of a Jew 
will be different from that of a Christian or Muslim. 
</P>
<P>
Why is it important that this difference of perspective be represented on the 
state's highest court? Because the opinions of a court that has been exposed to 
discussion and debate in which people of differing backgrounds and perspectives 
have participated will be more likely to interpret the law in a manner that is 
more compassionate, sensitive and fair. 
</P>
<P>
The reason for seeking female appointments to the state Supreme Court is not to 
promote one political or social ideology over another. Sandra Day O'Connor's 
appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court was applauded by women and men alike, and 
not because of O'Connor's position on various issues of the day. Indeed, women 
come in all political flavors. 
</P>
<P>
The notion of "diversification of the bench" is a principle that seeks to 
ensure that the perspective of individuals who are not white males will be 
considered by the decision-makers. The only way to guarantee the enactment of 
that principle is to add women and minorities to the court. Currently 
California Women Lawyers is advocating the appointment of one female to the 
state Supreme Court. It is with a sense of enthusiasm and optimism that we can 
look forward to the day when all of our courts are reflective of the society 
that they serve.

NEIL SOLOMON: FACTS ON IRON-FORTIFIED INFANT FORMULA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. NEIL SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I've heard that if a baby is given formula that has had iron added to 
it, the baby will have more problems than if the formula did not have added 
iron. Is this true? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: There is a commonly held belief that iron-fortified formulas are 
responsible for digestive disorders in infants, and cause them to be fussy; 
however, this was not substantiated in a study of 42 infants. 
</P>
<P>
In the study, the infants received either an iron-fortified formula or one that 
did not contain added iron. The investigators found that the reactions of the 
infants were similar regardless of which formula they received. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have been getting hot flashes, but I'm not surprised because I'm at the 
age where this is to be expected. In talking with other women my age, I find 
that those who have the same problem are taking estrogen. Is that what everyone 
takes, or are there any other ways to treat this condition? 
</P>
<P>
A: Estrogen is not the only treatment for the hot flashes associated with 
menopause, but it is the treatment against which all others are measured. Other 
suggested treatments include antidepressant medication and tranquilizers, but 
the effectiveness of these other measures has not been compared with placebo 
therapy. 
</P>
<P>
Oral estrogen is prescribed most often, but an estrogen skin patch and other 
routes of administration are also possible. One beneficial by-product of 
estrogen therapy is improved sleep. Hot flashes often awaken postmenopausal 
women; once the symptom is eliminated, sleep becomes more normal. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Sometimes the medication that a doctor prescribes for an illness seems to be 
worse than the illness. Since I've been on medication, my mouth feels so dry 
that I can hardly talk. Is there anything that can be done about this? 
</P>
<P>
A: If you experience dry mouth as the result of medication, try drinking lots 
of water and chewing sugarless gum. Brushing the teeth should also prove 
helpful. In addition, any unusual side effects you may experience should be 
brought to the attention of your physician. It's possible that a change in 
dosage may eliminate the problem, or some other medication may be substituted 
for the one you're taking. 
</P>
<P>
Q: My brother has been placed on antidepressant medication. Isn't it possible 
that he will become addicted to it? 
</P>
<P>
A: Antidepressant medication is not habit-forming; however, monitoring is still 
essential to assure that the patient is getting the right dose. 
</P>
<P>

Baltimore, Md. 21285-6184. Dr. Solomon cannot give personal replies but will 
answer as many questions as possible in his column.)

ROGER SIMON: HOT ON TRAIL OF A STORY CALLED GEORGETTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Roger Simon 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was raining. Gray clouds hung heavy in the sky like dirty bags of laundry. I 
sat at my desk and lit a cigar. 
</P>
<P>
That was breakfast. The most important meal of the day. 
</P>
<P>
I'm a reporter. It's my job to know what's going on. My paper's motto is: "If 
It Happens in the World, It's News to Us." 
</P>
<P>
The Chief called me into his office. "Kid," he said, for that is what they call 
me, "what story did I assign you two months ago?" 
</P>
<P>
I tried to think. "Was it a series?" I asked. "Potholes: Threat or Menace?" 
</P>
<P>
The Chief exploded. "Georgette Mosbacher!" he screamed. "She's the hottest 
story in this country right now and we're months behind on it." 
</P>
<P>
I pushed back the fedora that sat on my head like a squashed hen and scratched 
my head. "Georgette Mosbacher," I said. "A titian-haired beauty. Wife of the 
guy George Bush picked to be Commerce secretary. Keeps marrying rich guys. And 
is beginning to rival Donald Trump as the Most Written About Person You Really 
Don't Want to Read About." 
</P>
<P>
The Chief scooped up a bunch of clippings and threw them at me. One from 
Reuters landed on my nose: 
</P>
<P>
"WASHINGTON -- Georgette Mosbacher, the flamboyant wife of President Bush's 
nominee for Commerce secretary, did not attend her husband's confirmation 
hearings Tuesday, apparently not wanting to outshine the meeting." 
</P>
<P>
The chief tossed clipping after clipping at me. There was a magazine article 
from a Washington newspaper in which she was called "gorgeous" with an "ample 
cleavage" on "her drop-dead, Size 6 body" that was stuffed into 
"figure-hugging" gowns. She was "sexy" and had a "real, sexual marriage," 
looked like "Rita Hayworth" and in high school "even then filled out her angora 
sweater." 
</P>
<P>
(Needless to say, a woman wrote all this. Had a man written it, he would have 
been slapped with a sexual harassment suit before the story cleared the copy 
desk.) 
</P>
<P>
And during the inaugural festivities never a day went by without a mention of 
Georgette in the press: 
</P>
<P>
Jan. 19: A story about the "unabashed neck-craning" for the "red-haired" 
Georgette at a Marilyn Quayle luncheon. While Mrs. Quayle spoke, "half the 400 
people in the room turned to stare" at Georgette and her husband. 
</P>
<P>
Jan. 20: ". . . Texas socialite Georgette Mosbacher, in jewels and evening 
gown, was out walking her dog on M Street near the Jefferson. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
And, in another story, Georgette was mentioned for not being somewhere. About 
500 people attended a reception for the Bush children, but there were "some 
notable no shows -- James Baker, Sen. John Warner (R-Va.), Bob and Georgette 
Mosbacher." 
</P>
<P>
Bob, by the way, is the Texas oil baron who raised $60 million for George Bush 
during the campaign, "and was suitably rewarded with the Cabinet post of 
secretary of Commerce," according to one article. According to another, he 
"raised millions for Bush and has been rewarded with this big new job." 
</P>
<P>
The buying and selling of Cabinet posts used to be considered a felony in this 
country. But, hey, c'mon, the guy is married to a woman with "a freewheeling, 
nouvelle style," who is "nervy, sexy, flashy" and had "her eyebrows permanently 
darkened by a Gary, Ind., tattoo artist." 
</P>
<P>
And who's gonna prosecute the husband of a dish like that? 
</P>
<P>
Jan. 21: "In general, a leading topic of conversation seemed to be Georgette 
Mosbacher, the social bombshell . . . who struck this amazing pose for the 
camera. . . . 'All the ladies are jealous, yet there's no animosity toward 
her,' one woman said." 
</P>
<P>
Jan 22: At a series of post-inaugural parties, "people just crowded all around" 
Georgette and her husband and "with each one she took the time for a real 
discussion, and she was warm and direct and down-to-earth in a way you seldom 
see in this town. She's an energetic conversationalist and she has an easy, 
throaty laugh that breaks the ice right away." 
</P>
<P>
At an ABC party, "first and foremost" among the guests was that Commerce 
secretary guy and Georgette, "a vision in lavender." 
</P>
<P>
Then at another that same night, Georgette, wearing "a hip-hugging black 
Balmain (What? She changed from lavender to black in the limo?) stayed close to 
her husband, who . . . managed to look gray next to his eyeball-riveting wife." 
</P>
<P>
" 'I am going to love Washington,' cooed the red-haired Georgette Mosbacher. 
</P>
<P>
"Robert Mosbacher then quietly moved his magnet of a spouse away from 
reporters. 'We are going to love it here. I am ready to get to work,' he said, 
though it looked as if he might spend all his time diverting attention away 
from his diverting wife." 
</P>
<P>
"See?" the Chief yelled at me, snapping me back to reality. "The guy is already 
trying to divert attention away from Georgette!" 
</P>
<P>
I stood up and ground out my cigar on the Chief's desk. "No way the press is 
going to be diverted from this story, Chief," I promised. "Because if there's 
one thing we know in this business, it's news."

ON VIEW: THINGS ARE HUMMING AT MUSIC CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU LOPER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Those awaited invitations for the Music Center's 25th anniversary galas are in 
the mail, and the teal-blue folders offer four exciting choices -- as Platinum, 
Sterling, Silver or Gala patrons. 
</P>
<P>
But co-chair Nancy Olson Livingston and coordinating chair Deborah Tellefsen 
are cautioning for early reservations for the September event. Says Nancy: 
"Three of the four possibilities -- Platinum, Sterling and Silver -- are 
limited to 50 reservations for two. 
</P>
<P>
Gala patrons, at $2,000 a couple, will be available to 1,000 for a post party 
on the plaza after the celebration performance in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion 
on Sept. 24. 
</P>
<P>
The supreme attraction, however, will be for Platinum Patrons -- at $25,000 a 
couple. They'll be entitled to spend three magical days over Labor Day weekend 
on the Hawaiian island of Lanai, guests at the exclusive opening of David 
Murdock's new luxury resort, the Lodge at Koehle. 
</P>
<P>
Co-chairs Gloria Holden, Arianna Huffington and Ginny Ueberroth promise three 
days of boating, scuba diving, golf, tennis, beach partying and both formal and 
informal dining with celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling Patrons, at $10,000 a couple, will opt for black-and-white or color 
portraits and a personal statement about the Music Center in the Music Center's 
25th anniversary commemorative book. Co-chairs Keith Kieschnick, Margaret 
Buckley Parker and Joni Smith are standing by to assist. 
</P>
<P>
Silver Patrons ($5,000 a couple) will attend an intimate dinner Sept. 23 with 
members of the International Council, performers and celebrities. Co-chairs are 
R. Stanton and Ernestine Avery, Robert and Lois Erburu and Earle and Marion 
Jorgensen. 
</P>
<P>
Gala Patrons ($1,000) will be among the 3,200 attending the Sept. 24 
performance featuring the Los Angeles Philharmonic and works from the Mark 
Taper Forum and the Ahmanson Theatre, the Los Angeles Music Center Opera, Los 
Angeles Master Chorale and The Joffrey Ballet LA/NY. The post-gala for patrons 
-- this includes Platinum, Sterling, Silver, and Gala -- is bound to glitter 
under the tutelage of Bettina Chandler, Carole Cook, Anne Douglas, Annette 
O'Malley, Terry Stanfill and Edie Wasserman. 
</P>
<P>
But not only galas will be glittering. On March 20, Zubin Mehta will be a 
special guest at the 25th Anniversary Luncheon honoring the Music Center's 
historical founders whose donations made the building a reality. Other major 
donors and community leaders will be saluted also. 
</P>
<P>
And more: The Blue Ribbon will add an innovative gift to its Children's 
Festival (which annually brings 35,000 to the Music Center) through a videotape 
of the creation process of "Billy the Kid." The video will prepare students for 
the Joffrey Ballet performance they will see. 
</P>
<P>
Then, celebrating Los Angeles' multicultural heritage, the plaza will vibe the 
weekend of July 15-16 with performances, workshops and exhibits. And, Dec. 6, 
the actual anniversary of the Music Center opening, the public will reel in a 
grand party on the plaza with birthday cake, fireworks and rotating 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
Anniversary innovations also include the establishment of an International 
Council of corporate leaders from around the world and the creation of The 21st 
Century Arts Award, which will be awarded in music, theater and dance 
categories to young master artists. 
</P>
<P>
THE IDES OF MARCH: Pulitzer Prize-winning humorist and satirist Art Buchwald 
will be the honoree at USC's School of Public Administration's Ides of March 
VII Dinner on March 1 in the Grand Ballroom of the Regent Beverly Wilshire. 
</P>
<P>
Bank of America executive vice president James P. Miscoll (also executive 
officer for Southern California for the bank) is chairing the dinner and will 
be master of ceremonies. To date, co-chairmen and patrons include include 
Carolyn and Dr. Carl M. Franklin of USC, Dennis F. Holt, William M. Keck II, 
Angelo R. Mozilo and Miscoll. 
</P>
<P>
The $300 tickets will benefit scholarships. Since 1983, more than $1 million 
has been raised through the dinners. 
</P>
<P>
Buchwald enlisted in the Marines at age 17, served from 1942-45, then attended 
USC under the GI Bill of Rights. He was managing editor of Wampus, the campus 
humor magazine, and wrote a column for the Daily Trojan. 
</P>
<P>
PLAUDITS: Thomas Larkin thinks the California Pediatric Center &amp; Family 
Medical Center is one of the city's best-kept secrets, and he wants word of the 
center to reach more low-income families as well as potential donors. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, the Women's Auxiliary presents "Hollywood Nites" on Saturday at the 
Hollywood Roosevelt's Blossom Room. It will honor guitarist Jose Feliciano as 
Humanitarian of the Year for overcoming physical obstacles and for giving 
benefit concerts for the Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
Also, corporate leadership awards will go to Thomas E. Larkin, past president 
of the board and managing director of the Trust Company of the West in downtown 
Los Angeles; John T. Malloy, head of John T. Malloy, Inc., and Ernest Gett of 
Latham &amp; Watkins law firm. 
</P>
<P>
Maria Sanchez, 3 1/2, will receive the Most Inspirational Patient Award; she 
was born with cerebral palsy and spastic paraplegia. At the center, she has 
learned to walk, run and jump. 
</P>
<P>
Lainie Kazan will entertain and Mario Machado is the master of ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
PAST PERFECT: Bob Eberle's elegant surprise dinner dance at the Hotel Bel-Air 
honoring wife Debbie's birthday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Jay and Susan Stein's wonderful dinner honoring Mayor Bill Frederick of 
Orlando, Fla., and his wife, Joanne, and including guests Richard Swann, Lynn 
Wasserman, Ed Haddock, David and Joan Weitzer, Herb and Carrie Steinberg, Tony 
and Caroline Young, Dan and Grace Slusser, Mark Hales and more. . . . Ada Gates 
and Anna Muggia's preview of artists at the San Marino home of Ted and Deedie 
McCarthy and including Santa Barbara dog portraitist Connie Coleman, floral 
painter Susan Hazeltine Connell, sculptor Nina Kaiser and race horse painter 
Celeste Susanny. 
</P>
<P>
$100,000: Last year after their Geoffrey Beene fashion luncheon, the Luminaires 
were able to hand Doheny Eye Institute a check for $100,000. Members are at it 
again, under the leadership of Luminaires president Nancy Payne and chairman 
Ruth Harbour, known for their volunteer successes. They have chosen couturier 
Michael Novarese to spice up aperitifs and luncheon with a fashion show in the 
newly redecorated Regent Beverly Wilshire ballroom. Bobbie Galpin will 
transform the room into a burst of spring and Ginny Gaspar will take 
reservations and hopefully not turn away bids for one of the choicest luncheons 
in the city. 
</P>
<P>
VALENTINE AIM: Cupid's bow will be aimed at Los Angeles' most eligible 
bachelors at the Big Brothers Bachelor Auction on Thursday at the Beverly 
Wilshire. Bachelors will be auctioned to highest bidders. Actress Lee Purcell 
is chairing the affair and actress Barbara Bain is honorary chairman. Bids 
start at $100, but guests will be encouraged to pool financial resources, then 
draw straws to see who gets him. 
</P>
<P>
GOOD NEWS: Kelsey Hall will take on the presidency for another year of the 
Pasadena Guild of Childrens Hospital. She will introduce new members including 
Cherry Bianchi, Nancy Krueger, Debby Mielke, Suzanne Miller and Kathy Ryan on 
Feb. 16 at the Valley Hunt Club. More on the board will be Lois Matthews (she's 
also the only woman member of the Huntington Memorial Hospital board), Doris 
Ann Williams, Veva McKee, Kathern Gillespie, Carol McGhee and Jane Odell. 
Barbara Guglielmo will be June Debutante Ball chairman. 
</P>
<P>
INTERESTING ALLIANCE: The Los Angeles Pops Orchestra will benefit Tuesday from 
the Baseball Hall of Fame Celebrity Dinner at the Biltmore. Baseball 
hall-of-famers Jack Lang and Ralph Kiner are supposed to welcome Los Angeles 
Dodgers. Tickets are $150.

ZAN THOMPSON: THERE'S ROOM AT THE INN -- ENOUGH FOR A SMALL ESCAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN THOMPSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first night, there was a chocolate-chip cookie the size of a Frisbee 
wrapped in clear plastic and tied with a sky-blue bow on my pillow. The next 
night, there was a nest of pastel Jordan almonds tied with a pink bow. I 
associate Jordan almonds with my grandmother and silver tea caddies. And every 
night, there was a fire in the fireplace casting a flickering light on the 
peach-colored walls. 
</P>
<P>
If you can work it, this is the time of the year to take a small escape. The 
Christmas bills come in every mail like a flight of ravens, tugging at your 
conscience, crying at your bank balance. 
</P>
<P>
My young friend Kevin Finch called and asked me to come to the Sonoma Mission 
Inn for a quiet few days in the wine country. He is manager of a restaurant and 
store at the inn and a delight of a person whom I have known since he was a 
gangly kid. He has grown into a handsome man with the same blue eyes, alive 
with intelligence and the knowledge that the world is a wonderful place to be. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin came to San Francisco to pick me up. I was glad to see him because I had 
just been through a stimulating hour circling San Francisco Airport. 
</P>
<P>
First, the pilot said, "We are unable to land at San Francisco Airport because 
of the fog. We have tried once. We have 20 minutes' worth of fuel left so we 
will try one more time and then go to San Jose." 
</P>
<P>
I thought that that was intelligence he might have kept to himself. I have 
never had an airline captain confide the amount of fuel he has. Maybe it's part 
of the new truth in advertising rules, but he overshot. The woman behind me had 
never flown before and announced in tones like those of a distraught macaw that 
she never would again. 
</P>
<P>
We landed on the third pass after having been in the air 45 minutes. I don't 
know about the 20-minute limit. Maybe the pilot coasted the last half hour. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin looked like money from home when I saw him leaning against the pillar, 
grinning. 
</P>
<P>
On the drive to the Sonoma Mission Inn, we caught up and he told me he loved 
being there. He's the manager of the Big Three, a restaurant, delicatessen and 
a treasure trove of a store, full of local jams and jellies, Italian plates 
shaped like fat fish and 250 things you can live without but covet wildly. 
</P>
<P>
The Sonoma Mission Inn was built in the mid-1800s and has been through a number 
of ownerships by volatile people, the most stable of whom were the original 
tribe of Indians who discovered the hot springs that still gurgle away 
underground and provide the sparkling water served at the inn. 
</P>
<P>
The inn was rebuilt in California mission architecture in 1927, with arched 
walkways and towered buildings around a grassy courtyard. In 1980, a spa was 
built, with every health and beauty accouterment known to the seekers after 
inner peace and outer svelteness. Massages, facials, aerobics, exercise 
machines, water massages, herbal wraps, everything for the fitness pilgrim of 
both sexes. 
</P>
<P>
One evening, Kevin and I had dinner with Peter and Susan Henry. Peter is 
director of the inn and Susan is his pretty wife. 
</P>
<P>
The food in the grille where we ate is created by chef Richard Saunders and 
it's wondrous to behold. Richard is a graduate of the Culinary Institute of 
America, and studied in Switzerland. He spent eight years in Switzerland 
working at prestigious restaurants and ended with a flourish by becoming the 
first American chef to be chosen to head the kitchen at the U.S. Embassy in 
Bern for three years. 
</P>
<P>
His family is Romanian and he went to law school until the money ran out. He 
said a friend gave him the best advice he ever had: "You need a roof over your 
head and a few bucks in your pocket. Be a waiter." 
</P>
<P>
He worked at Broussard's in the French quarter of New Orleans and his 
philosophy of fine meals came from that job. He told me: "If you don't have 
much money but if you can buy your food, fish and meat wholesale, and a good 
bottle of wine retail, you can get a good meal." 
</P>
<P>
He loves Sonoma and so does his wife, Yvonne, who is Swiss. "She gives me an 
evenness. There's a professionalism and a work ethic here that reminds her of 
Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
"There is sincerity and dedication to the job whether it's a mushroom grower, a 
wine maker, or a fisherman in Bodega Bay. They care about fineness. The chicken 
and duck growers have the same attitude toward their work. 
</P>
<P>
"Our veal is not raised in boxes and the beef we serve is without hormones. 
Everything is natural." 
</P>
<P>
He served a delicious dinner ending with an unbelievably good coffee ice cream, 
made without cream. It's one of his gourmet spa recipes. 
</P>
<P>
There was also a Swiss cappuccino torte and a creme brulee for which no caloric 
counts were mentioned. They were satiny, delicious and should be forbidden. 
</P>
<P>
At the Big Three at the inn, which Kevin manages, I had Italian sausage, sweet, 
spicy and tasting of Tuscany, served with polenta. 
</P>
<P>
When Kevin and I were driving to San Francisco the day I left, we were talking 
about clearing out books and how hard it is. He said: "Last time I tried, I 
threw away three. I picked up a paperback of 'The Iliad' and, Zan, you know you 
can't throw that away." 
</P>
<P>
Just when you think there is scant hope for the world, you find again that 
young people like Kevin know the best of the good old stuff and are still 
reaching for the rainbow and having the good sense to hang on to paperbacks of 
"The Iliad." 
</P>
<P>
I came home to the same bills and a computer that had been made immobile by a 
visit from the telephone repairman for whom I waited all one day last week. I 
did not kill anyone because I had a backlog of fresh air, wonderful food, 
people I would want as friends anywhere, anytime, good conversation, a facial, 
a massage and Jordan almonds on my pillow by firelight.

TITLE COMPANY 'STING' LEADS TO PAIR'S ARREST; 
</P>
<P>
SUSPICION AROUSED BY FORGED DOCUMENTS IN LOAN APPLICATION 
</P>

<P>
A title insurance company may not seem a likely setting for a "sting" 
operation. But, such is not uncommon today in an industry plagued by a 
proliferation of forged title documents. 
</P>
<P>
H. Collyer Church, vice president and chief counselor for Glendale-based World 
Title Co., is part lawyer, part sleuth. 
</P>
<P>
He is a former assistant attorney general for the state of Washington and a 
specialist in insurance underwriting law. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Successful 'Sting' Operation 
</P>
<P>
Last December, Church and others at World Title brought together a mortgage 
broker, the conservator for the estate of a West Los Angeles widow, her 
attorney, a banker, a title security guard and bunco and forgery detectives of 
the Los Angeles Police Department. The successful sting operation, involving 
World Title personnel and Sgt. Doug Mahoe and his partner, Det. Charlene 
Reming, led to the arrest in December of two suspects in a forgery-embezzlement 
scheme, who are out on bail awaiting trial. 
</P>
<P>
Tell-tale signs of fraud in the case surfaced when the title company was asked 
to insure title to a single-family residence in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The request involved a home-equity loan application for $95,000 through a 
private loan broker. The house was valued at about $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
Records showed that the house had been purchased in 1929 by the previous 
owners, Harry and Rose Meyers, and that they had executed a community oil and 
gas lease in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
So far, nothing unusual, Church said. "But our role as a title insurance 
company is to spot the exception. A title search requires an examination of 
public records, laws and court decisions to disclose all facts, current and 
past, concerning ownership. 
</P>
<P>
"A further look through the documents revealed a grant deed from Harry and Rose 
to the new party, recorded on Nov. 4, 1988. But there was one suspicious detail 
-- a 10-month gap between the date of the deed and the recording date, with 
taxes on the deed indicating a sale price of $50,000 in January of 1988, well 
below the market value of comparable Westside properties." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Commission Issued 
</P>
<P>
Another inconsistency: The signatures of the owners on the 1964 oil and gas 
lease did not match those on the 1988 notarized deed, which was apparently 
uninsured and handled without an escrow, Church said. A check with the 
California Secretary of State's office revealed that no notary commission had 
been issued in the name used for the notary's signature on the deed. 
</P>
<P>
"After calls to Harry and Rose, answered by a phone machine, and a check of the 
assessor's rolls and telephone directory, we learned from neighbors that Rose 
had been taken to a convalescent home a few months before and that Harry had 
been deceased for three years," Church said. "Rose's nephew-conservator was 
contacted and a quiet-title action was initiated for a lis pendens notice (a 
pending suit that would block any transaction on the property)." 
</P>
<P>
The mortgage broker told the loan applicant that he would have to deliver a 
statement of confirmation from the sellers to World Title, before the money 
would be paid. A detective posing as a title officer arrested the suspects when 
the money exchanged hands. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very satisfying experience for all of us," Church said. "It saved the 
widow the expense of clearing her property and saved the loan broker $155,000." 
</P>
<P>
Title insurance can provide important protection to the homeowner and it is 
important for the seller or buyer of a property to understand what it does, 
Church said. 
</P>
<P>
"For one thing, it does not insure against errors, such as boundary lines; it 
is the responsibility of title officers to check for any discrepancies as to 
boundary lines. I've done work on farmland, for example, where property lines 
followed rivers and were marked by trees. 
</P>
<P>
"But over the years, the rivers had changed and the trees had been chopped 
down. Often we have to get statements from neighbors on either side, agreeing 
to what is assumed to be a rightful boundary," Church said. 
</P>
<P>
World Title has identified the following as danger signals that the consumer 
should be alert to: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A deed, mortgage or deed of trust is usually insured today and if it is 
not, it should be examined closely. 
</P>
<P>
 -- To increase the apparent equity in the property, a forger will place on 
record a forged release of mortgage or reconveyance of deed of trust. A release 
of this type will usually occur independently of any other real estate 
transaction. 
</P>
<P>
"We also look carefully at drop-in customers, excessive demand for speed by the 
customer and a property that is vacant, in which case we require additional 
verification of the identity of the seller," Church said. 
</P>
<P>
Fraud can be treated either as a misdemeanor or felony. A misdemeanor 
conviction can lead to a sentence of not more than one year in county jail; a 
felony sentence could be a year or more in a state penitentiary. 
</P>
<P>
Church said he plans to submit proposals to strengthen legislation dealing with 
possession and control of notarial seals.

DICK TURPIN: BURBANK IN POSITION TO CORRECT PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dick Turpin 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over the years, the city fathers of Burbank, admirably imbued with fiscal 
caution but constantly hampered by narrow vision, have consistently missed 
opportunities to create what some historians might call a model city within the 
San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Blessed with a combination of valley and hillside real estate and supported by 
a great tax base -- motion picture, television, aviation and defense industries 
and all their related branches as well as an airport -- the city fell far short 
of its potential during the post-World War II years. 
</P>
<P>
Following the war, a housing construction boom of historic proportions overtook 
vast portions of the valley and Burbank, at its eastern end, enjoyed the 
convenient proximity to downtown Los Angeles for commuters and automatically 
became a highly desirable place to live and work. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, the regional shopping center as we know it, was in its beginning 
stages. The first of its kind was established in the Crenshaw area in 1947 and 
just recently has been rehabilitated with considerable civic fanfare. 
</P>
<P>
The May Co. chain saw the great potential for suburban shopping centers when it 
placed a branch at that site. Another likely location seemed to be the Burbank 
area, with plentiful developable land and a population of 90,000. 
</P>
<P>
It got an unwelcome response from the City Council, the Chamber of Commerce and 
the town's daily paper, the Burbank Review. The rationale was: We want to 
remain a small city. We don't want all the commotion of a big business 
district. The big store would kill off the little businesses lining San 
Fernando Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Turned away, the May Co. soon established (Sept. 12, 1955) a pioneering branch 
in North Hollywood, at Laurel Canyon Boulevard and Oxnard Street. That location 
now contains the headquarters for May Co. California. 
</P>
<P>
A Times account of the opening noted at that time that it "was the fifth link 
in the chain of May Co. stores" in the Los Angeles area and that it gave the 
"San Fernando Valley the largest suburban store in the West" with its 452,000 
square feet of floor space and parking for 3,000 cars. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, that rejection became the first in a series of several major 
enterprises that were not established in Burbank in the bustling postwar era 
and the following years and became descriptive of the city's official attitude. 
</P>
<P>
Other potential civic customers included a midget auto race track sponsored by 
war veterans, Disneyland itself, and over the last 20 years, Carnation Co. 
offices and a string of developers whose plans to build a major shopping 
complex -- including Ernest Hahn, nationally known builder/developer and Disney 
interests again -- for various reasons slipped off the track. 
</P>
<P>
(In one memorable arrangement, the long-since defunct St. Louis Browns baseball 
club spent its spring training at the Olive Recreation Center diamond.) 
</P>
<P>
But regardless of past reluctance to expand and develop the city, Burbank's 
brightest spot is its Media District, in its southern sector, made up of 
various entertainment industry firms and the NBC complex. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, last week the Burbank City Council voted unanimously to negotiate with 
a major Southland developer to bring about a long-awaited shopping complex on a 
redevelopment site just west of "beautiful downtown Burbank," the disparaging 
misnomer that has identified the city for so long. 
</P>
<P>
This news will not alarm neighboring Glendale, which over the same period of 
time, has become a suburban financial center with a respectable skyline and a 
profitable and enviable shopping complex, the Galleria. 
</P>
<P>
The Burbank redevelopment site, on the north side of the Golden State Freeway 
between Burbank and Magnolia boulevards, covers 41 acres. For about two 
decades, various attempts to transform it into a commercial showcase have 
failed frustratingly. 
</P>
<P>
This time around, the council has chosen to negotiate with Alexander Haagen Co. 
on plans for a $160-million enclosed, two-level mall with offices, hotel and 
restaurants. Anchoring the complex would be Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. and 
Buffums department stores and an Ikea furniture store. City officials and the 
Haagen organization are to iron out the details and financial arrangements 
within the next 60 days and present a final plan for adoption. 
</P>
<P>
Incidentally, the Haagan firm was involved in the newly completed renovation of 
the pioneering Crenshaw complex. 
</P>
<P>
From an old Burbank hand, one who knows where Turkey Crossing is, let's hope 
this time around that the long-delayed and jinxed project will come alive very 
soon.

SOME LENDERS NOW OFFERING 40-YEAR LOANS; 
</P>
<P>
ADJUSTABLES AIMED AT QUALIFYING BUYERS IN HIGH-COST AREAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID W. MYERS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sooner or later, it had to happen: The 40-year mortgage has arrived. 
</P>
<P>
A small but growing number of lenders are offering 40-year loans, in part 
because skyrocketing home prices have made it impossible for many borrowers to 
qualify for 30-year mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
Stretching payments out over an extra 10 years lowers the loan's monthly 
carrying costs, which makes it easier for cash-strapped borrowers to qualify 
for the loan and lets well-heeled buyers get a bigger loan to buy a nicer 
house. 
</P>
<P>
But while these longer-term loans may appeal to some borrowers, they're clearly 
not for everyone. The longer repayment schedule dramatically increases interest 
charges over the life of the loan, and equity buildup is much slower. 
</P>
<P>
Some lending experts say those two drawbacks offset the benefits of a 40-year 
term's lower monthly payments. 
</P>
<P>
"A 40-year term can lower your monthly payments a little bit, but you're giving 
up an awful lot for the privilege of making those smaller payments," says 
Dennis Casey of Home Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn., a San Diego-based lender 
that doesn't offer the stretched-out loans. 
</P>
<P>
Lending giants Great Western Bank and the Home Savings of America unit of H.F. 
Ahmanson &amp; Co. are among the institutions offering 40-year mortgages 
nationwide. A relatively small number of other lenders are offering them on a 
regional basis. 
</P>
<P>
So far, all of the 40-year loans currently offered are adjustable-rate 
mortgages. Introductory rates stand at about 8 1/4%, roughly the same as rates 
on 30-year adjustables. 
</P>
<P>
Initial principal and interest payments on a $100,000, 40-year ARM at 8 1/4% 
would total $714, or $37 less than the monthly payment on a 30-year, 8 1/4% 
loan for the same amount. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, monthly payments on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage at the going 
rate of 10 1/2% would be $915. That's $201 a month more than the payment on the 
40-year ARM. 
</P>
<P>
A 40-year loan's lower payments can make a big difference for many first-time 
buyers. The savings free up cash to meet other financial obligations, and also 
make it easier to qualify for the loan. 
</P>
<P>
For example, cutting the monthly payment by just $37 reduces the amount of 
annual income needed to qualify for a loan by more than $1,200. In high-cost 
areas where larger loans are needed, the savings can have an even more dramatic 
impact. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, though, the 40-year loans aren't just appealing to struggling 
first-time buyers: They're also drawing interest from affluent people. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills-based Great Western started making the 40-year loans last 
December, after getting hundreds of appeals from realtors doing business in the 
Southland's high-cost coastal communities. 
</P>
<P>
Although it's too early to tell whether the program is catching on with the 
public, says Great Western's Michael Cichon, "the realtors say there's good 
demand for it." 
</P>
<P>
By choosing a 40-year loan instead of a 30-year term, home buyers can borrow 
more money because their monthly payments won't be as high. 
</P>
<P>
But while the 40-year mortgage lowers monthly mortgage payments, it also raises 
the long-term cost of the loan dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
Since the 40-year loans have adjustable rates, it's impossible to calculate 
exactly how much more in interest charges the extra 10 years will generate. 
Some lenders say finance charges over the life of a 40-year can be as much as 
40% higher than interest charges on a 30-year loan, primarily because nearly 
all of the monthly payments in the first 15 or 20 years of a 40-year loan go 
toward principal, not interest. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, a borrower who takes out a $100,000 loan could easily wind up 
paying an extra $80,000 to $100,000 in interest if the loan is paid off over 40 
years instead of 30. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, few borrowers actually keep their loans for the entire term; they 
usually sell their house and pay off the loan long before then. Borrowers who 
intend on staying in a house for a relatively short time -- say, five or six 
years -- will probably pay less than $2,000 in additional interest charges by 
choosing the 40-year plan over the 30-year term. 
</P>
<P>
Paying an extra $2,000 or so in finance charges over five years isn't a problem 
for buyers in areas where home prices are rising fast, because their eventual 
resale profits will easily offset their extra financing costs. 
</P>
<P>
But $2,000 can be important to buyers in markets where prices are advancing 
slowly, holding steady or dropping. Even if the value of the house goes up a 
few thousand dollars, the resale profit will have been eaten up by the extra 
interest costs. Add to that the cost of any sales commissions, and the home 
could wind up being a money-losing investment. 
</P>
<P>
Casey at Home Federal admits that borrowers who can't quite qualify for the 
higher payments on a 30-year loan may be tempted to choose a 40-year mortgage. 
"If it's the only way you can get the money, then you might want to take it," 
Casey says. 
</P>
<P>
"But the truth is, if your finances are so tight that you have to take 40 years 
to pay off your mortgage, you should probably start thinking about buying a 
less expensive house, or wait a little longer to save up more money for the 
down payment. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't want things to be so tight that you can't afford to take your family 
to dinner every now and then," Casey adds.

'UNNECESSARY' MONEY SPENT BY DEVELOPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The developer of Chatelaine, a community of 236 townhouses in Torrance, 
reported the sale of 42 units in its first two increments, without models, 
brochures or other merchandising tools. Yet, Watt Homes went ahead and 
furnished models, finished a brochure and invested in a sales office. 
</P>
<P>
Why? Robert A. Perlberg, a spokesman for the development, said: 
</P>
<P>
"First, it was not a one-phase product, and the developer can't predict what 
the economy will be like (as future phases are released), but basically, Watt 
spent well over $100,000 more than was really necessary because the company is 
planning other projects in the area." Watt has built a number of residential 
communities in Torrance during the past 30 years.

HOME IMPROVEMENT: ASK THE TIMES;

<P>
VINYL WINDOWS TOPS IN SOUND CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: What do you think of vinyl windows, as opposed to wood and aluminum? 
Please go over the pros and cons, especially in the areas of durability, 
maintenance and cost. Are there grades of vinyl, or are they all the same? Do 
all window dealers carry vinyl? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: This is a big subject and there's only enough room here to touch on 
some salient points., Allen L. Lowith (Lowith Metal Window Co., 10905 Peach 
Grove Ave., North Hollywood 91601), said that vinyl-frame sound-control windows 
are now available on the West Coast market, comparable in cost to quality 
aluminum-frame windows. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his company name, Lowith installs vinyl windows for customers who want 
them. Because vinyl windows accept the thicker sound-control glass and because 
vinyl is superior to aluminum in resistance to sound transmission, vinyl 
windows are increasingly popular in retrofits in noisy areas. Lowith said that 
aluminum windows are still the most durable. 
</P>
<P>
Wood windows are available from manufacturers such as Pozzi, Marvin, Andersen 
and Pella in finished wood, primed wood, bare wood and vinyl clad. We're 
talking serious money for wood windows, but the look is distinctive and should 
be considered for certain architectural styles. Mill-finish aluminum windows 
are not recommended in a room addition of a house that has double-hung wood 
windows. However, you should consider vinyl windows -- either hollow-core or 
solid -- that match the existing wood windows. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to know more about the advantages and disadvantages of various 
window materials, read Chapter 5 of "The Low-Maintenance House" by Gene Logsdon 
(Rodale Press Books, Emmaus, Pa. 18049). Logsdon describes the various 
materials, their heat-loss indexes and the aesthetics of various materials. 
This is a highly readable book, by the way.

VIDEO, BOOK TEACH HOW TO BUILD KITCHEN CABINETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID M. KINCHEN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Books are great for home improvement projects, especially if they come from a 
quality source like The Taunton Press. 
</P>
<P>
The publisher of Fine Homebuilding, Fine Woodworking, Threads and other 
magazines and books is a class act, producing magazines with great layouts, 
good color photos, excellent sketches and well-written articles. 
</P>
<P>
As if that isn't enough, Taunton produces a line of high-quality 
home-improvement videos. It was only a matter of time before Taunton combined 
the videos with the books; the first effort of this type is called "Making 
Kitchen Cabinets" by Paul Levine ($39.95 for the set, $29.95 for the video only 
(Beta or VHS format), $17.95 for the book only, The Taunton Press, 63 S. Main 
St., Box 355, Newtown, Conn. 06470). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Building Your Own 
</P>
<P>
Levine has simplified the construction of frameless (Euro-style, 32-millimeter) 
kitchen cabinets as much as possible and he describes his techniques 
comprehensively (in the book) and quickly (in the video). 
</P>
<P>
Making kitchen cabinets isn't for everyone, but if you're a reasonably skilled 
woodworker with a table saw, a drill press and the usual assortment of portable 
power tools, you shouldn't have any trouble making a good-looking cabinet at a 
fraction of the cost of the factory-made unit. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the traditional face-frame cabinet common to the United States and 
Canada, frameless cabinets are simple to construct. Levine doesn't like 
particle board, which is often used for cheap cabinets of both types, 
recommending hardwood plywood. 
</P>
<P>
Levine's frameless cabinets come with hidden hinges that allow the doors to 
open almost flat, they have drawer slides that allow the drawer to open all the 
way and they have a clean look that many homeowners prefer. 
</P>
<P>
If you're a professional cabinetmaker who wants to learn about the frameless 
system of construction, this would be an excellent book/video combo. It would 
also be good for an industrial arts teacher who wants to add this style of 
construction to his or her repertoire. 
</P>
<P>
One caution: Don't order the video only; it isn't nearly as comprehensive or 
detailed as the book and leaves a lot of informational gaps. The price for the 
set is fair, considering the amount of information Levine supplies.

REAL ESTATE AND TAXES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Why the modesty in Dick Turpin's column (Jan. 22)? Nearly everyone knows that 
the Los Angeles Times is indirectly behind every real estate movement that 
takes place in the Southern California area. Mr. Kyser of the Los Angeles 
Chamber of Commerce may have put together a list of the pros and cons of the 
growing ownership of Los Angeles real estate by foreign nationals and 
companies, but his list is superfluous to the beliefs (and holdings) of the Los 
Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, I doubt his list mentions one of the largest contributors of all 
to the development of the real estate now being sold to foreign interests. I 
refer, of course, to U.S. taxpayers. For years, real estate has been subsidized 
by extraordinary tax breaks given to developers and their investors. (Remember 
the bold giveaways written into President Reagan's 1981 Tax Act?) 
</P>
<P>
I wonder if U.S. Congress members would have been so generous with real estate 
if they had realized at the time that the ultimate beneficiaries of their 
largess would be foreign nationals -- not U.S. citizens. But then this isn't 
the first time that we deficit-burdened taxpayers have been taken for a ride, 
is it?

'LETTER' TO EX-PRESIDENT PRAISED FOR ITS HONESTY

<TEXT>
<P>
Mr. Kaplan strays far from his area of expertise when he chastises Mr. Reagan 
for not orienting eight years of decision-making as President around Mr. 
Kaplan's pet projects. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Kaplan holds Mr. Reagan singularly accountable for the budget deficits, 
while simultaneously chastising him for seeking to cut $100 million from the 
Los Angeles Metro Rail project, clearly one of the biggest boondogles ever to 
come down the pike. You can't have it both ways, Mr. Kaplan. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Kaplan seeks to lay the blame for every ill of Los Angeles and of society 
in general at the feet of Mr. Reagan. This approach deserves three responses. 
First, it is clearly wrong. This nation is in far better position economically 
and vis-a-vis the rest of the world due to Mr. Reagan's efforts. Second, Mr. 
Kaplan should stick to what he knows and leave the editorial writing for 
someone else. Third, as a matter of pure ethics, Mr. Reagan ceased to be fair 
game for personal attacks at noon on Jan. 20.

Sam Hall Kaplan's column (Jan. 22) on ex-President Reagan was a breath of fresh 
air, truth, honesty, etc. after the stifling accolade given to this, our worst 
President in the history of our republic. 
</P>
<P>
Thank God that the infamous Ron and Nancy dog and pony show has closed its run. 
He can no longer veto sound legislation that fails to fit into his shallow, 
inhumane ideology. 
</P>
<P>
I hope that you will continue to write on the subject of Reagan's illusions. 
The American people are being cruelly deceived by this amiable dunce.

THREE BLACKS, ONE MEXICAN SING OUT: READ THEIR LIPS

<TEXT>
<P>
For Z'Looke, the local R&amp;B/dance-music band whose single, "Can U Read My 
Lips," is a big hit on the Billboard black chart, the look is very important 
</P>
<P>
On their debut album, "Take U Back to My Place," the four musicians wearing 
dark shades and dressed in black look like a corps of hit men. "Mysterious and 
a little mean -- that's how we want to look," keyboardist/guitarist Mikel Cee 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
But guitarist Art Z, a Mexican, didn't look anything like that when Riverside 
natives Cee and bassist Eric Jerome, both black, first saw him a few years ago. 
This was even before they found lead singer Wayne Cockerman (also black). They 
were organizing a band and were in the market for a guitarist. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want him in the group," Cee recalled of Z. "He looked weird and very 
straight. I thought he looked like a jerk." 
</P>
<P>
Art Z chuckles about it now, but back then he didn't think the rejection was so 
funny. "I thought I was hip, but I guess I wasn't hip enough for them," 
recalled the guitarist, who had been studying jazz at Cal State L.A. "I grew up 
in this lower-class neighborhood in Pasadena. I grew up on R&amp;B, but jazz 
was my preference. But I had to eat so I was trying to get into R&amp;B. 
There's more opportunities to play and more money in it." 
</P>
<P>
When Cee and Jerome met up with Art Z a year later, he had acquired the look. 
"He had become quite funky," Cee said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
"I had gotten hipper," Art Z confirmed. "I had quit school and started playing 
music around town. I threw away those Beethoven and Bach records I had been 
listening to and started listening to Prince." 
</P>
<P>
Cee noted, "He was one of us. It was like he had been on a diet of nothing but 
chitlins for a year." 
</P>
<P>
Laughing and obviously appreciative, Art Z leaned over and extended his hand to 
Cee. They shook hands -- hip-style. 
</P>
<P>
Rock 'n' roll -- like athletics -- has been given a lot of credit for bringing 
the races together in America. Yet it's still hard, more than 30 years after 
the birth of rock, to find integrated bands. 
</P>
<P>
That's why the composition of Z'Looke is still bound to draw second glances. 
Though relations between those two minorities are often stereotyped as 
strained, Cee, 21, sat next to Z, 22, one evening in the Hollywood office of 
their label, Orpheus Records, and claimed there have been no problems. 
</P>
<P>
"We never think about it -- the racial thing. We never think about what Art is, 
other than he's Art and a musician -- a damn good musician." 
</P>
<P>
It was obvious that Cee didn't like the line of questioning. Art Z didn't seem 
to like it either -- but that was less obvious since he's rather reserved and 
somewhat hard to read. 
</P>
<P>
"That racial stuff shouldn't matter," Cee said. "Blacks and Mexicans get along 
fine. That's the way it is." 
</P>
<P>
Art Z smiled. 
</P>
<P>
Cee continued: "The fact that Art's not black hasn't been a factor with this 
band. It just hasn't mattered." 
</P>
<P>
But it might have mattered to record companies, which are concerned with 
marketing artists and getting their records played on radio. Noted Cee: "With 
this kind of band, with blacks and a Mexican, there are things we probably 
couldn't do. If we were playing country music, we'd have a problem. Those 
(people) wouldn't want to deal with two minorities." 
</P>
<P>
Securing a record deal was quite a chore for this quartet, which writes and 
produces most of its own music. "But the problem was the music, not race," Art 
Z insisted. "Companies didn't think the music was quite right." 
</P>
<P>
Both said the band might still be chasing a record contract if it weren't for 
the efforts of their attorney, Bill Lewis, who worked out deals with Hush 
Productions -- for management -- and Orpheus Records, a new label. 
</P>
<P>
Z'Looke's music is high-tech hip-hop, showcasing up-to-the-minute rhythms that 
set the street crowd rocking. The vocals aren't terribly distinctive, but the 
musicianship is exceptional. That pulsing beat and the irresistible hooks are 
luring listeners to "Can U Read My Lips." There are some cuts on the debut 
album that are equally magnetic -- like "Sneak Preview" and "Love Sick," which 
is the next single. 
</P>
<P>
"Orpheus didn't care what we are," Art Z said. "They signed us because they 
heard potential hits in our demos. That's the bottom line."

A COZY IRANIAN CAFE IN WESTWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Do you like Iranian dancing?" shouts the singer. It's a rhetorical question, 
since she's asking in Farsi and rhythms are already being tapped out on a 
goblet-shaped drum. 
</P>
<P>
Even before the shouts of assent die down she's started jiggling around from 
table to table, sometimes singing, sometimes joking and flirting, sometimes 
coaxing men to get up and dance themselves. It's a dance with a lot of hand 
movements around the face; a little like belly dance, maybe, but she's wearing 
an evening dress and it's really more an easy-going cousin of flamenco, without 
flamenco's histrionics. 
</P>
<P>
The place is packed. ("Snuggle in the Cozy Restaurant," says its business 
card.) Whole families are here at 11 p.m. on Saturday, from grandmothers in 
scarfs to babes in arms. Some, though surely not the families with small 
children, will stay until the 4 a.m. closing time. 
</P>
<P>
Four a.m., big deal. The Cozy Restaurant was once open around the clock. Owner 
Bruce Jalili says he only cut back the hours because he's so busy these days 
trying to break into Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
The Cozy Restaurant is not as wild or crowded as this most of the time, though, 
because the singer-dancer (who also tells a million jokes in Farsi) only 
performs Thursday through Saturday. Most nights a smaller audience comes to 
hear Iranian pop songs and the sobbing, melodramatic, highly embellished 
improvisations of Persian classical music, played on either of two sorts of 
long-necked lute. 
</P>
<P>
And during the day, from 10 a.m. until the music starts 12 hours later, it's 
usually quiet. There will be just a few people who come to eat or chat and 
drink glass after stubby glass of tea. 
</P>
<P>
The Cozy is right down in "Persian Gulch," that stretch of Westwood Boulevard 
from Santa Monica to Wilshire where a lot of Iranian restaurants and shops are 
found, both because of the Iranian students at UCLA and the numerous Iranian 
families living in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The decor runs to genre paintings and old-country cooking utensils on the 
walls, red track lighting and a TV in the corner. One wall is grandly mirrored, 
to be sure, but another slants and consists of panes of glass, giving the 
suggestion of a greenhouse. And the Cozy would seem to suffer from a most 
peculiar location, buried behind a tiny seven-spot parking lot which it has to 
share with three other businesses. 
</P>
<P>
It gets an upscale Iranian crowd anyway; the late Shah's brother has had a 
birthday party here. The music may have something to do with it, but there are 
also foods that can't be found elsewhere. Iranian restaurant menus tend to be 
pretty much the same; you'd probably have to go to the Cozy Restaurant for fish 
pilaf or the spinach and walnut frittata called kuku sabzi, or some of the 
specials of the day such as Iranian-style grilled liver or lamb's tongue. 
</P>
<P>
You would certainly have to come for dizi. The restaurant's name may be Cozy in 
English, but in Farsi the sign out front says Dizi, after the house specialty. 
Dizi a dish of lamb, potatoes, beans, some tomato paste and aromatic preserved 
lime peel stewed together for seven hours. 
</P>
<P>
It comes to the table in a little aluminum pot four inches high. You press the 
liquid out of this using a big wooden pestle and mix the thick, lamby broth 
with a lot of paper-thin lavash bread to make soup. Then you (or your waiter) 
take up the pestle again and pound the solid part of the stew into a puree, 
which you eat with a fork and lemon juice, a solid, peasant-like counterpoint 
to the rather elegant soup. This is a dish of the ghahveh-khanehs or teahouses 
of Tehran, and although it's a unique specialty, it's also the cheapest entree 
on the menu. 
</P>
<P>
Owner Bruce Jalili, who looks a like a younger, cuter Michael Nouri, is an 
authentic self-starter. He first opened a wholesale Iranian book store in this 
location four years ago. Then he started having readings by Iranian and Afghani 
poets on Tuesday nights, then tripled the size of the place and put in a 
kitchen and bingo, it was a nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
While plunging into Hollywood (there's a photo of him with Sly Stallone on the 
wall), Jalili is sticking with the Cozy, and working to reinforce his Iranian 
heritage. He's starting a new Iranian theater, and he plans to open a 
zur-khaneh, a sort of gymnasium where you work out not to Jane Fonda tapes but 
to recitations from the Iranian national epic.

A first-rate Filipino meal in the United States? Until recently it was almost 
impossible to get. Family-oriented Filipinos are so accustomed to entertaining 
at home that, even in Manila, dining out is a relatively recent phenomenon. And 
unlike many other immigrants, most Filipinos arriving in the U.S. speak English 
and can easily find work. This means few of them end up working in restaurants 
or opening eating places of their own. 
</P>
<P>
But immigration has been so brisk that Filipinos are now the second-largest 
Asian ethnic group in the United States (Chinese rank first), and the largest 
in California. Many are hungry for a taste of home, and as the surge of 
immigrants continues, enterprising Filipino restaurateurs are starting to reach 
a ready market. 
</P>
<P>
Right now the clientele is primarily Filipino. Americans have taken to Thai, 
Vietnamese and spicy Chinese dishes with enthusiasm, but most know very little 
about Filipino food. Political unrest in the islands has inhibited tourism, and 
few Americans have encountered the food first hand. 
</P>
<P>
Paradoxically, this is the one Asian cuisine that should be the most acceptable 
to Westerners. More than 300 years of Spanish occupation and almost 50 years 
under the American flag have strongly marked Filipino culture and cuisine. 
Paella is as popular as pancit (the Tagalog word for noodles). And steak, 
barbecued chicken and macaroni salad share the table with such indigenous 
dishes as lechon (roast suckling pig served with liver sauce), daing na bangus 
(fried milkfish) and pinakbet, a vegetable combination that includes eggplant, 
bitter melon and a heady shrimp paste called bagoong. 
</P>
<P>
There is, of course, a more adventuresome side to Filipino food. Filipino 
cooks, for instance, are famous for wasting nothing, hence dishes such as 
tripe, pig ears and others from assorted internal organs. 
</P>
<P>
Some dishes remain totally Western. Flan, the most common dessert, is like flan 
anywhere. Others incorporate a Filipino touch. Steak might be seasoned with 
garlic and soy sauce. Fruit salad might include translucent palm seeds or 
shreds of buko (young coconut). And a chiffon cake might be tinted a startling 
lavender because of the use of a purple yam called ube. Exotic contributions 
also come from the Chinese, Malays and Indonesians. But chiles are used so 
sparingly that Filipinos have the mildest food in Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
How good is Filipino food here? Manila-born Cecilia De Castro, who conducts 
training classes for chefs, misses the fresh taste of just-caught fish and 
shrimp. "It's very hard to translate the flavor without the freshness," she 
said. All restaurateurs miss the luscious, buttery-smooth mangoes of the 
Philippines. Without them it is impossible to make such entrancing desserts as 
mango jubilee, a flaming fruit concoction that is spooned over ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
We also can't get tangy-sweet green mango juice, a common aperitif in the 
Philippines. Manuel and Corazon Ongpauco Tamayo of Barrio Fiesta in Los Angeles 
apologize for using tomato instead of green mango in a relish that accompanies 
a platter of barbecued meats and seafood. On the other hand, Manuel Tamayo 
thinks some dishes taste better in the United States because Philippine-made 
ingredients here are of export quality (superior to what is sold in the 
islands). 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't stop the Tamayos from bringing in bagoong made by a Manila 
restaurant chain, because it tastes better than the brands sold here. Their 
cooks insist on peanut butter from the Philippines. And Manila is the only 
place they can get the Chinese brand of banana flavoring that they use in sago 
and gulaman, a sweet drink made with gelatin cubes and sago pearls. 
</P>
<P>
One of the first Filipinos to enter the market was veteran Manila restaurateur 
Rey Bautista, who opened Tito Rey of the Islands in 1984 in Daly City, near San 
Francisco. His clientele there is 90% Filipino, and he serves them the more 
exotic sorts of Filipino foods, including the aforementioned tripe and pig's 
ear, as well as pork fat, liver, shrimp heads and dinuguan, which is composed 
of pork meat and internal organs simmered in blood. But when Bautista opened a 
West Los Angeles branch of his restaurant (11829 Wilshire Blvd.; (213) 
479-7008) in 1987, he changed the menu to suit the non-Filipino area. 
Westernized creations that he introduced here include a "Filipinized" Caesar 
salad -- crisp-fried pork skin and dried shrimp replace croutons, and a touch 
of bagoong flavors the dressing. A tiny bit of bagoong also goes into the dip 
that accompanies an appetizer of batter-coated, deep-fried kangkong (water 
convolvulus) leaves. 
</P>
<P>
Lorna and Ben Halili, founders of the Mommy's Best eating places in Manila, 
arrived in L.A. in 1984 and the next year started a chain called Manila Sunset 
(2815 W. Sunset Blvd.; (213) 484-5161). Now there are Manila Sunsets in West 
Covina and Sepulveda, as well as Chicago, New Jersey and Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
Manila Sunset's menu is limited to a handful of dishes that would not commonly 
be prepared at home. The chief attraction is bibingka, a rice-flour cake that 
is traditionally baked in an earthen container with charcoal at top and bottom. 
Lorna Halili searched until she found a commercial oven that duplicated this 
effect. She soaks rice overnight and grinds it -- the old-style way of making a 
more traditional flour. Then she lines the baking dishes with banana leaves and 
tops the batter with a salted duck egg and cheese. The cake comes to the table 
brushed with butter and sprinkled with sugar and grated fresh coconut. 
</P>
<P>
Another specialty is puto bumbong, small purple rice cakes steamed in bamboo 
tubes and topped lavishly with sugar, coconut and melted butter. A dark rice 
called pirurutong produces the color naturally. Still another special is pancit 
malabon, rice noodles in an annatto-colored sauce topped with hard-cooked egg, 
shrimp, pork and pork cracklings. 
</P>
<P>
Many Filipino restaurants offer Continental, American and other types of Asian 
food in hopes of broadening their appeal. Mario's, named for owner Mario 
Benitez, opened in Santa Ana under the name Calesa (2106 N. Tustin Ave.; (714) 
541-6585) so that Californians wouldn't expect an Italian menu. (Calesas are 
horse-drawn carriages that still operate in the Philippines, and one sits 
perched on the restaurant roof.) Calesa played it safe by adopting "Around the 
World Dining" as his theme and offering Continental food in addition to 
Filipino dishes. Thus one can have French onion soup, crisp duck legs with 
orange sauce or Maryland crab cakes along with adobo (chicken and pork cooked 
with vinegar, garlic and soy sauce), fried lumpia (egg rolls), shrimps in 
coconut sauce and lengua (tongue) in red wine sauce. 
</P>
<P>
The Aristocrat, Manila's oldest major restaurant, opened in 1936 and grew to 
eight branches. Its American offshoot, The Aristocrat of the Orient in Los 
Angeles (400 S. San Vicente Blvd.; (213) 657-0581), got off to a rather 
faltering start in August. The menu here is as heavy in Japanese and Chinese 
dishes as in Filipino food, which is downplayed. Kalbi chim, a Korean beef-rib 
soup, has been written into the menu, but the highly popular Filipino sinigang, 
which incorporates vegetables and meat or seafood in a sour broth, has been 
relegated to the specials announced by waiters. It is, however, available 
daily. In January, the restaurant opened a sushi bar, which is manned by a 
Japanese-trained Filipino chef. 
</P>
<P>
Mami King (4321 W. Sunset Blvd., L.A.; (213) 669-1078. 21209 Hawthorne Blvd., 
Torrance; (213) 540-3326) leans toward the Chinese side of the Filipino 
heritage. It features noodle soups and fluffy siopao, the Filipino version of 
Chinese barbecued pork buns. Max's restaurant (3575 Wilshire Blvd.; (213) 
384-3043) is the first American branch of a famous Filipino chain that based 
its success on fried chicken (its motto: "The House That Fried Chicken Built"). 
</P>
<P>
Manila's leading caterer, Glenda Barretto, is involved in Via Mare (3377 
Wilshire Blvd.; (213) 480-1223), a restaurant and adjacent coffee shop in the 
mid-Wilshire district. The coffee shop, which features traditional Filipino 
dishes, opened recently. The dining room, which is not yet open, will offer 
Continental seafood. Barretto is president of Via Mare Catering Services, which 
operates the original Via Mare restaurant and several coffee shops in Manila. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, restaurants here paid little attention to ambiance. Then, in 1987, 
the ambitious Barrio Fiesta (3821 W. 6th St.; (213) 383-9762), which has 16 
branches in the Philippines, unveiled a tropical setting imported entirely from 
the Philippines, right down to the pale narra-wood flooring. The response was 
resounding applause from the Filipino community and prolonged waits for a 
table. The menu is exclusively Filipino. One top-rated dish is crispy pata, 
pig's knuckles deep fried to produce crisp outer skin and succulent meat. A 
Barrio Fiesta opened in October in South San Francisco, and another is planned 
for San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles also has a scattering of turo turo restaurants, where the food is 
set out in steam tables for quick service (turo turo means "point point"). A 
good example is Greenhills Restaurant (2745 W. Beverly Blvd.; (213) 487-4224), 
near downtown Los Angeles. Here the large selection of dishes, which changes 
daily, might include catfish cooked with coconut milk and spinach, pinakbet, 
barbecued chicken, adobo, longaniza (Filipino-style sausage), pancit canton 
(fried noodles), kare kare (oxtails in peanut sauce) and sinigang. In addition, 
there are desserts such as sapin sapin, a coconut-flavored rice flour cake 
composed of orange, purple and white layers. Like most Filipino restaurants, 
Greenhills serves halo halo, a soda glass filled with sweetened beans, 
jackfruit, coconut shreds, palm seeds, sweetened ube paste, ice, milk and a 
spoonful of flan. 
</P>
<P>
Filipino food clearly appeals to this nation's large Filipino population -- but 
the new breed of restaurateur hopes for a wider audience. "I think there's a 
big future," says Fil Benitez, manager of Calesa. "The Philippines is really a 
cross of East and West."

The Atomic Safety and Licensing Board gave the operator of the Three Mile 
Island plant in Pennsylvania approval to boil off 2.3 million gallons of 
radioactive water -- part of the legacy of the nation's worst nuclear accident. 
About 260,000 gallons of the water has been sitting in the reactor building 
basement since the 1979 accident. The rest of the water has accumulated during 
cleanup operations. General Public Utilities Nuclear, the plant operator, 
proposed to get rid of all the water by boiling it into steam released from a 
100-foot-high stack, and packaging impurities for shipment to a waste dump. 
Pennsylvania citizens' groups have challenged the decision, expressing concern 
about the release of radiation into the atmosphere.

Representatives of the nation's black mayors approved a resolution condemning 
the Supreme Court's ruling that minority set-aside programs are 
unconstitutional unless discrimination can be proven. The draft resolution 
drawn in Atlantic City, N.J., by the executive committee of the National 
Conference of Black Mayors said the decision implies that set-asides are 
"simple racial politics" and is an attack on minorities. The Supreme Court 
struck down last month a Richmond, Va., ordinance that set aside 30% of public 
construction projects for minority-owned businesses. The opinion by Justice 
Sandra Day O'Connor said discrimination must be proven before such programs can 
be constitutional. The resolution notes that many jurisdictions have similar 
ordinances and urged that they be kept intact.

More than 200 Soviet Muslims marched from a mosque through Tashkent, capital of 
Uzbekistan, to press the government to take up their religious demands, the 
Soviet news agency Tass reported. It said the demonstrators from the Central 
Asian republics of Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Tadzhikistan demanded state 
intervention in certain religious matters. Tass said Uzbekistan Premier Gayrat 
K. Kadyrov told 25 of the demonstrators their demands should be addressed by 
the clergy, not the government. Regional religious leaders are to discuss the 
demands Monday, Tass said.

GULF COMBAT PAY MAY END 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

The general in charge of the U.S. Central Command has recommended the 
suspension of combat pay for sailors in the Persian Gulf, Pentagon sources say. 
The request by Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, under review by the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff, is the strongest indication yet that U.S. defense officials believe the 
truce in the Iran-Iraq War will hold. The bonuses are worth $110 a month and 
have been paid to military personnel working in the Persian Gulf since August, 
1987. The United States now has 14 ships in the gulf, including six 
minesweepers, and Navy officials estimate that 4,000 sailors are receiving the 
payments.

President Bush and his top advisers discussed the savings and loan crisis but 
the President made no decisions, the White House said. The advisers -- 
including Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, Budget Director Richard G. 
Darman and Chief of Staff John H. Sununu -- traveled to the presidential 
retreat at Camp David, Md., and conferred with the President for 3 1/2 hours, 
said B. Jay Cooper, a presidential spokesman. Federal Reserve Board Chairman 
Alan Greenspan joined the group for lunch. Among the proposals that were to 
have been discussed were plans to raise $54 billion over three years through 
financing arrangements based on boosting deposit insurance premiums paid by 
institutions, according to the New York Times. The plan would call for banks to 
pay 18 cents in insurance premiums for every $100 in deposits, while savings 
and loans would pay 25 cents per $100, the paper said. Banks now pay 8 cents, 
while S&amp;Ls pay 21 cents.

Vice President Salvador Laurel returned to the Philippines after a visit with 
ailing former President Ferdinand E. Marcos and appealed to President Corazon 
Aquino to let the man she succeeded die in his homeland. Aquino, however, 
refused Laurel's request for a meeting, saying he should "share with the 
Filipino people" the results of his visit with Marcos, a presidential statement 
said. "President Aquino felt that there should be nothing secret in what Mr. 
Marcos sought to convey to her," the statement said. Meanwhile, William Craig, 
the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service district director in Hawaii, 
visited the 71-year-old exiled leader and confirmed that he appears to be 
"gravely ill."

A blue-ribbon panel recommended it. President Bush and former President Ronald 
Reagan gave it their blessing. But the vast majority of Americans feel members 
of Congress do not deserve a $45,500 pay raise, according to the Gallup Poll. 
Boosting congressional salaries from $89,500 to $135,000 a year, as proposed by 
a nonpartisan commission, is favored by 15% of the public and opposed by 82%, 
even when tied to a ban on speaking fees, or honorariums. Only 20% knew what 
congressmen are paid, while 12% believed legislators earn more than what they 
actually do and another 12% believed the lawmakers earned less. More than half 
(56%) were unable to specify any figure at all. The raise affects U.S. senators 
and representatives, as well as other top federal officials, judges and Cabinet 
members.

Three anti-apartheid South African political parties announced they have merged 
in anticipation of national elections this year. The formation of the new 
party, to be known as the Democratic Party, is an attempt to broaden the 
political base of white liberals, who are widely seen as being in a state of 
disarray. The party will be launched formally in Johannesburg on April 8, but 
"concerted planning and action begin today," the organization said after a 
meeting. The Democratic Party will have three leaders who presently are serving 
as the heads of the merging parties. They are Zac de Beer of the Progressive 
Federal Party, Wynand Malan of the National Democratic Movement, and Denis 
Worrall of the Independent Party.

Egypt and Israel will resume talks on the disputed Taba border area today and 
have agreed to try to resolve all pending issues by early next month to 
expedite an Israeli withdrawal. A statement issued in Cairo by Egypt, Israel 
and the United States said two committees will meet to discuss the issues 
holding up an accord: Egyptian compensation for an Israeli-built luxury hotel 
and beach cabana complex, access for Israelis to Taba and location of the 
border line in the area where tourist facilities are. Washington is a partner 
in negotiations over the 250-acre patch of beach overlooking the Gulf of Aqaba, 
which was awarded to Egypt by arbitrators last September.

LONG SHOTS FIGHT ODDS AGAINST UPSET

One is a minister who is also a stockbroker. Another is a former stripper who 
last ran for mayor -- and lost. And another is a firefighter who earned the 
Fire Department's Medal of Valor for rescuing three police officers involved in 
a shooting. 
</P>
<P>
They are among 23 long-shot challengers to five entrenched Los Angeles City 
Council members who represent parts of the San Fernando Valley. Candidates had 
until Saturday to submit 500 signatures and pay a $300 filing fee to qualify 
for the April 11 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Ernani Bernardi faces eight challengers; council members Joy Picus 
and Mike Woo, six each; Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, two, and Councilman Marvin 
Braude, one. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the challengers, such as slow-growth activist Laura Lake, who is 
opposing Yaroslavsky, and Picus challenger Peter Ireland, an aide to a county 
supervisor, say they are running because they are concerned about crime, 
development and other issues in the community. 
</P>
<P>
Others have different reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"You get to learn a lot selling hot dogs on the street and talking to people," 
said vendor Mort Diamond, who is challenging Picus for her $58,592-a-year 
council job. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bucking the Trend 
</P>
<P>
History, however, is not on the side of the challengers. 
</P>
<P>
Only three times in the last 12 years has a council member failed to win 
reelection. In all three cases, the challengers had raised money in the 
six-figure range. And the incumbents had angered large numbers of constituents. 
</P>
<P>
This year's challengers to Picus and Yaroslavsky hope to take advantage of 
growing homeowner discontent with the incumbents' record on development. Just 
two years ago, another political newcomer, Ruth Galanter, ousted veteran 
Councilwoman Pat Russell on a wave of anti-growth sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi, the council's senior member with 28 years of service, faces a large 
field of challengers because of the 1986 council reapportionment, which put him 
in a largely new district with a Latino majority. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
3rd District 
</P>
<P>
In the West Valley's 3rd District, Picus' potentially strongest opponents are 
Ireland, the son of actor John Ireland and a deputy to County Supervisor Deane 
Dana, and Jeanne Nemo, a Republican activist who is backed by County Supervisor 
Mike Antonovich. 
</P>
<P>
Nemo, a former teacher who sells real estate, ran against Picus in 1985 and 
finished second in a field of five with 21% of the vote. Picus won with 56% of 
the vote. Candidates need more than 50% of the vote to win the April election. 
Otherwise, the top two vote-getters will meet in a June runoff. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Ireland, 42, and Nemo, 59, Picus is opposed by Diamond, 57; Ron Rich, 
40, a car salesman; Todd Landis, 36, a restaurant manager and co-owner of the 
Country Club in Reseda, which the council recently stripped of its liquor 
license with Picus' support in response to neighbors' complaints, and Paul 
McKellips, 29, marketing director of an executive search firm. 
</P>
<P>
The district extends roughly from Balboa Boulevard to the western city limits 
between Roscoe Boulevard and the Ventura Freeway. It includes Canoga Park, 
Reseda, Tarzana, Warner Center, West Hills, Woodland Hills and west Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unhappy With Picus 
</P>
<P>
"In all of the homeowner meetings that I have attended, and I've gone to many, 
there is widespread discontent with Picus over the development issue," Ireland 
said. Dana has not decided what role, if any, he will play in the race, said an 
aide to the supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
Nemo contends that Picus' political stock has fallen since the last election, 
but she has not taken a formal poll. Antonovich has sent a letter to his 
supporters urging them to contribute to Nemo's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowner leaders who have clashed with Picus say the 12-year councilwoman is 
vulnerable because of her vacillation on whether portions of Canoga Park should 
be renamed West Hills, her support for development of cultural facilities in 
the Sepulveda Basin and Warner Park, and her slowness in coming out against the 
proposed Warner Ridge office project. 
</P>
<P>
"I definitely think she's slipped on the popularity scale," said Milena Miller, 
president of the Reseda Community Assn. Miller said she has voted for Picus 
three times, but this year plans to vote for one of her opponents, though she 
has not decided which one. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said Picus has lost support in Reseda because of her unwillingness to 
rule out the building of a ground-level light-rail line that roughly parallels 
Chandler and Victory boulevards between North Hollywood and Warner Center. The 
proposed route, one of five under consideration, has drawn strong opposition 
from residents. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks to a lot of the people along that route as though she is a lot more 
concerned about development of Warner Center than residents who would be 
affected," Miller said. Picus said she wants to wait for a study on whether the 
environmental impacts of building such a line could be mitigated. 
</P>
<P>
However, Joel Palmer, president of Tarzana Property Owners Assn., said he 
expects Picus to win reelection "because none of the opponents have seized on 
any issue" that has angered large numbers of constituents or "shown how they 
could do a better job." 
</P>
<P>
"As of today, I would support Joy," he added. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Incumbent Confident 
</P>
<P>
Picus, 58, said she is confident of winning reelection. She said a poll she 
commissioned shows that she is viewed favorably by a majority of her 
constituents. She declined to release the survey, however. 
</P>
<P>
But she is taking no chances. She has hired professional political consultants 
to conduct a full-fledged campaign on her behalf. 
</P>
<P>
"I have always taken my challengers seriously," she said. "I once surprised a 
guy who didn't take me seriously. I'm not going to let that happen to me." She 
was alluding to the late Councilman Donald Lorenzen whom she defeated to win 
election in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
As evidence of her credentials as an environmentalist, she points to her 
support of Proposition U, the 1986 slow-growth initiative; her opposition to 
oil drilling in Pacific Palisades, and her vote to ban new billboards in the 
city. She has also been endorsed by Galanter. 
</P>
<P>
"Jack Spound doesn't think I am pro-development," she said, referring to a 
developer whose Warner Ridge office project she has sought to block. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ties to Growth 
</P>
<P>
She points out that Ireland and Nemo, while attacking her for being too cozy 
with developers, have ties to supervisors who have generally pro-growth 
records. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue isn't who I work for," Ireland said. "The issue is what Joy Picus 
has allowed to take place in the district." Miller said Ireland, who is a board 
member of the Reseda Community Assn., has worked hard to slow growth in the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
In the northeast Valley's 7th District, Bernardi's potentially strongest 
challengers are Lyle Hall, 48, a former president of the Los Angeles 
firefighters union and a recipient of the Medal of Valor, and Jules S. Bagneris 
III, 28, president of the Lake View Terrace Home Owners Assn. and a former aide 
to state Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Van Nuys). 
</P>
<P>
Hall's campaign is being run by Harvey Englander, who engineered Woo's 1985 
victory over former Councilwoman Peggy Stevenson. Hall, who has been endorsed 
by the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor's political arm, served as United 
Firefighters president from 1976 to 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Hall, who is on leave from his job to campaign full time, refuses to say 
anything bad about the incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that he's bad," Hall said. "I'm running because I'm a better 
candidate." Hall, however, has not spoken specifically on what changes he would 
make at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Bagneris, the son of a prominent Pacoima minister, is a minister with the 
African Methodist Episcopal Church and works as a stockbroker. "That's how I 
make my money," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I consider my running for office to be part of my ministry as well," he added. 
"It's all about feeding the hungry, sheltering the homeless and setting the 
captives free. Here in the San Fernando Valley, we've been held captives to 
landfills and to inappropriate uses, such as the Phoenix House." Phoenix House 
is a drug treatment facility proposed for Lake View Terrace that has drawn 
strong neighborhood opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi opponents also include Irene Tovar, 50, a former head of the Hispanic 
Caucus of the state Democratic Party, and Al Dib, 54, a produce wholesaler who 
is president of the Arleta Chamber of Commerce and ran unsuccessfully for the 
old 1st Council District seat in 1973 and 1977. 
</P>
<P>
Also challenging Bernardi are Frederick Taylor, 50, a member of the county 
Childrens' Services Commission who runs a religious music store in Pacoima; 
James Braun, 29, office manager for a construction firm; Richard Yanez, 28, a 
county mental health worker, and Barry Gribs, 49, a drug therapy student at 
Glendale College. 
</P>
<P>
The district is made up of Arleta, Pacoima, Sylmar and parts of Lake View 
Terrace, Mission Hills, Panorama City, Sepulveda, North Hollywood, Sun Valley 
and Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi's challengers will be trying to benefit from a new development in the 
district -- reapportionment -- which cut away large portions of white 
working-class Van Nuys from the district and added predominantly low-income 
black and Latino Pacoima. Only about a third of the old district was left in 
Bernardi's new territory. 
</P>
<P>
The 1986 redistricting also established a Latino majority in the district. But 
Latinos have a way to go to win the seat simply on the strength of numbers. 
Less than one-fourth of the district's Latinos are registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he is in a tough race," said independent political consultant Steve 
Afriat. "There is a large number of constituents who are unfamiliar with him 
because of reapportionment." 
</P>
<P>
However, Bernardi has worked hard to win over his new constituents, hiring 
staff members who speak Spanish and instituting programs to rid the community 
of crime, abandoned vehicles and graffiti. If he is reelected and serves at 
least two more years, he will have served on the council longer than anyone in 
city history, surpassing the late council President John S. Gibson Jr., whose 
30-year career ended in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Bernardi's opponents have sought to make the 77-year-old councilman's 
age an issue. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi, former President Ronald Reagan's junior by eight months, said he has 
a better attendance record than most of his younger colleagues. "I still play 
18 holes of golf, and I carry my own bag," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the 5th District, Yaroslavsky's potentially strongest opponent is Lake, 41, 
a slow-growth activist and UCLA professor of environmental sciences who is 
being helped by some of the same people who engineered Galanter's upset of 
Russell. Also in the race is Ryan Snyder, 33, an urban planner. 
</P>
<P>
The district was extended from the Westside in the 1986 redistricting to 
include North Hollywood, Sherman Oaks and Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
Lake has accused Yaroslavsky of failing to slow development in the district, a 
charge that he denies. 
</P>
<P>
Jack McGrath, who spent $7,500 on television commercials promoting himself as 
the only Valley challenger to Yaroslavsky, failed to qualify for the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"I screwed up," McGrath said Saturday. He fell 150 signatures short of the 500 
required. He said he still plans to run as a long-shot write-in candidate. 
</P>
<P>
McGrath, who managed Yaroslavsky's first successful campaign in 1975 and served 
as the councilman's chief deputy, said he was too busy with his real estate job 
to collect signatures. He hired a firm to gather the signatures last week but 
never heard from them. 
</P>
<P>
To qualify as a write-in candidate, McGrath, who lives in North Hollywood, has 
until March 28 to pay $300 or gather 500 signatures. 
</P>
<P>
In the 13th District, Woo faces six challengers, including former school board 
member Tony Trias, 56, and Bennett Kayser, 42, a former president of the 
Federation of Hillside and Canyon Assns. who finished fifth in a field of six 
candidates in the 1985 race. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the race is Venus De Milo, a former stripper who refuses to reveal her 
age -- she is 49, according to public records. She works as a computer 
consultant and has run unsuccessfully for mayor and county supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
Other candidates are Howard Obata, 39, a postal clerk; Zahrina Machadah, 58, a 
business consultant, and Berndt Lohr-Schmidt, 45, an attorney. 
</P>
<P>
The challengers contend that Woo has allowed too much development in Hollywood. 
None of the candidates lives in the Valley. The district extends from Hollywood 
to most of Studio City and part of Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
In the 11th District, Braude's lone opponent is Irwin Kaplan, 54, an urban 
planner. The district extends from Pacific Palisades to include the Valley 
south of the Ventura Freeway from the San Diego Freeway to the western city 
limits. It includes Encino and parts of Tarzana, Van Nuys and Woodland Hills.

THE WAIT GOES ON;

<P>
LONG LINES CONTINUE AT DMV OFFICES DESPITE APPOINTMENTS, COMPUTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Linda Haim, a Northridge social worker, had taken the morning off from her job 
to renew her driver's license and car registration at the state Department of 
Motor Vehicles office in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
After a frustrating 1 1/2 hours -- including 55 minutes in a slow-moving line 
for her written license test -- she left with only her temporary driver's 
license and frayed nerves. 
</P>
<P>
"Ridiculous," Haim fumed. "I'll have to come back." 
</P>
<P>
Haim's experience is hardly unique. Despite the much-heralded statewide 
computerization and adoption of an appointment system four years ago, residents 
are still creeping along in DMV lines that seem to mirror freeway gridlock. 
Officials acknowledge that an occasional patron even passes out in the process. 
</P>
<P>
The average waiting times in San Fernando Valley offices are well above the 
statewide averages, according to DMV figures. In addition, those who want to 
bypass the lines by making appointments often are deterred by multiple busy 
signals and recorded messages. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Growth in Population' 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the advantages we have in automation have kept up with the 
growth in population," said Yolanda Ericsson, who manages the Canoga Park 
office. "We cannot accommodate all of the customers." 
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging that the ideal of no waiting remains utopian, DMV officials 
still maintain that some things have improved and that further progress is 
expected this year. 
</P>
<P>
Those who are able to use the appointment system can dramatically reduce 
waiting time. Express boxes in DMV offices provide a 48-hour turnaround for 
those who drop off their forms, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Computers have allowed the oft-maligned agency to cut in half the amount of 
time that it takes to process driver's licenses and titles. This used to take 
60 to 90 days; it now takes four weeks, said Diane Ward, Van Nuys office 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the DMV opened an office in North Hollywood in November and plans to 
open two more -- in Reseda and Simi Valley -- later this year, a substantial 
increase in the number of Valley-area offices. DMV officials say this reflects 
the seriousness of local bureaucratic congestion and their determination to 
relieve it. 
</P>
<P>
To speed the process, the DMV is leasing the new offices from businesses or 
individuals rather than building them, DMV spokesman William Gengler said. This 
has reduced planning, budgeting and construction time from as long as five 
years to six to eight months. 
</P>
<P>
The Valley area was chosen for two of the 16 offices scheduled to be opened 
statewide this year because it has experienced an influx of residents, 
particularly immigrants, in recent years. Last year's federal amnesty program 
for illegal immigrants significantly increased the number of those seeking 
licenses and vehicle registrations, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The Van Nuys office, for example, had a 29% jump in driver's license 
applications in 1988, Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
The impact is visible at each of the Valley offices, where long lines are 
dominated by Latinos. At the Arleta office, consumers speak Spanish more 
frequently than English. 
</P>
<P>
The new facilities will reduce the driving time for those who live near them. 
But here too, there is a downside. Due to budget constraints, staff members are 
being transferred from existing offices to the new branches. The Arleta office, 
where the driver's license line sometimes stretches out the front door, will 
lose five of its 50 employees to the Reseda office. 
</P>
<P>
"This should take some of the load off an office that is overburdened now," 
Gengler said. "Our offices are still able to function effectively." 
</P>
<P>
Figures for average waiting times indicate that consumers can avoid the DMV 
blues by making an appointment. Appointments for a written or behind-the-wheel 
license test or registration usually can be made at Valley offices within one 
to 10 days, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, the average wait for transactions without appointments was 14 
minutes in November, the most recent period for which figures were available. 
The average wait for those with appointments throughout California was 4.2 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The time logged in the Los Angeles region -- which had average waits of 18.6 
minutes for no appointments and 5.4 minutes for appointments -- was the highest 
in the state. 
</P>
<P>
The figures for three offices surveyed by The Times last week generally were 
higher than the statewide average and, in some instances, well above the Los 
Angeles numbers. 
</P>
<P>
For the Van Nuys office, the average wait for those without appointments was 24 
minutes for the license test and 22 minutes for registrations, Ward said. The 
longest waits were 55 and 40 minutes, respectively. The same day, those with 
driver's license or registration appointments waited two to three minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The numbers were similar for Arleta and Canoga Park. The shortest average wait 
at any of the offices was 17 minutes for a driver's license test at Canoga 
Park. During peak periods at Arleta, the average wait for a license test was 41 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"Complaints from motorists are down compared to what we used to get," said 
Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), who is chairman of the Assembly 
Transportation Committee and whose 39th District includes Arleta. But, informed 
of the recent waiting times for the Los Angeles area and the Valley, he 
responded: "That's obviously not acceptable." 
</P>
<P>
At the crowded Van Nuys facility, Janie Ortuno and Marque Coy recently 
personified the contrast between the appointment and no-appointment experience. 
</P>
<P>
Ortuno, 33, a clinical audiologist from Sherman Oaks, had made a 9:40 a.m. 
appointment to get her license plates. The clerk helped her immediately. She 
had paid her fees and was out the door by 9:50. "Piece of cake," Ortuno said, 
her face beaming. 
</P>
<P>
Coy, 34, a sound engineer from Sherman Oaks, had made a driver's license 
appointment but had been forced to cancel it. The result: one hour in line. 
</P>
<P>
"I can get a passport quicker than a driver's license," Coy said as he inched 
forward in a line with 28 others. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, someone stops in their tracks. 
</P>
<P>
"In every office I've worked in for the DMV, I've had somebody faint in the 
lobby for one reason or another," said Ward, a 14-year DMV veteran. "It may be 
a pregnant woman or someone who does not like standing in line." 
</P>
<P>
DMV office managers said a major roadblock to shorter lines has been the 
public's failure to take advantage of the appointment option. 
</P>
<P>
Ericsson estimated that only 10% to 15% of Canoga Park office customers make 
appointments. Drew said the figure is 15% to 20% in Arleta. At Van Nuys, where 
more than one in three customers make appointments, Ward said, "we have a lot 
of repeat customers who realize the appointment system works." 
</P>
<P>
Some consumers maintain that the appointment system simply does not work 
because they are unable to get through on the phone lines. This appears to be a 
particular problem at the Arleta office. 
</P>
<P>
Veronica A. Koncilya, an Arleta secretary, said she tried for 2 1/2 weeks to 
make an appointment to renew her registration. She said she gave up after being 
put on hold with a recorded message for five minutes or more 20 times. So she 
simmered for 34 minutes at the Arleta facility recently. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very poor system," Koncilya said as she waited. "I think I'll write to 
Gov. Deukmejian and ask him if he stands in line." 
</P>
<P>
(Donna Lucas, George Deukmejian's deputy press secretary, said he handles his 
personal vehicles "just like any other citizen." He was out of the country last 
week, so Lucas said she could not determine whether he mails in his DMV forms 
or stands in line.) 
</P>
<P>
Koncilya's experience is neither unique nor new. A Times reporter who tried 
five times to reach the Arleta appointment number during a three-hour period 
was greeted with a busy signal. Efforts over two days to reach the Thousand 
Oaks office on the appointment line were also unsuccessful. The line was busy 
five times one day and 10 times the next during a six-hour period. 
</P>
<P>
Overworked phone lines apparently have been a problem since the appointment 
system was instituted with great expectations in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"Give us another two or three months," then-acting Arleta manager Frank Smith 
told The Times in March, 1985. "If we aren't there, we will be close to it." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Drew, who has run the Arleta office for the past three years, acknowledged 
recently that backed-up phone lines for appointments "is a problem statewide. . 
. . A horrendous amount of calls do come in and we have a recording and it is 
frustrating to wait." 
</P>
<P>
In Arleta, one or two employees generally staff the four appointment lines. In 
Van Nuys, three and sometimes four employees handle the four appointment lines. 
Ward said callers are generally helped within five to 10 minutes. And a Times 
reporter got through to a clerk at Van Nuys on several tries. 
</P>
<P>
DMV spokesman Gengler said the Sacramento office had sought to alleviate the 
telephone gridlock by upgrading the phone system. He said the department is 
exploring the feasibility of designing a computer modeled on those used for 
reservations by airlines. This would allow consumers to call a single number 
and make appointments at any DMV office in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of businesses that benefit from the long lines and appointment snafus 
maintain that their experience indicates that the DMV has hardly made a dent in 
driver backlog. 
</P>
<P>
"You go . . . on any given day and there's still going to be a tremendous long 
line," said Richard Slobin, president of the California Automobile Registration 
Service, which charges a fee to act as a middleman for consumers. 
</P>
<P>
Slobin said his Tarzana-based company's sales have increased 20% in the last 18 
months to $360,000 annually. The firm handles 10,000 to 15,000 license and 
registration transactions a year. 
</P>
<P>
"We deal with the educated customer who has had a bad experience or does not 
want to deal with DMV," Slobin said. 
</P>

Bette Harper, who runs a registration service out of her Sylmar home, agreed 
with Slobin's appraisal. "They are totally understaffed in the offices," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
There are some things worse than waiting in a DMV line once every few years 
with your temper overheating. Ask Penole George. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital technician brought 18-year-old Tanisha Farrington, who lives with 
her, to take the written driver's license test at Van Nuys. She said she had 
called for an appointment but was told that Farrington would have to wait eight 
days. 
</P>
<P>
George, who lives in Sepulveda, impatiently leaned against a counter while 
Farrington crept forward in line. 
</P>
<P>
"If you've got to wait for a period of time, that's fine," George said. "But 
this here's ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
An hour later, Farrington had taken the test. But as George walked out with 
her, she was already anticipating their return. "She failed," she said.

TIPS FOR CONSUMERS: HOW TO AVOID DMV GRIDLOCK 
</P>
<P>
Renew your driver's license or registration early enough to do it by mail. Call 
the general information or appointment numbers to find out what forms are 
needed; DMV will send you an information packet on request. 
</P>
<P>
If you don't have time to use the mail, drop forms and documents off at 
"Express Box" at branch offices. Turnaround time should be 48 hours. 
</P>
<P>
If you must handle a transaction in person, call for an appointment. This can 
save you a half hour or more. Appointment times are generally available within 
one to 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
If you cannot make an appointment, try to go to the offices during the middle 
of the week; avoid Mondays and Fridays. Lunch hour and late afternoon tend to 
be the busiest times.

THE SAVVY TRAVELER: EXTENDED-RANGE PLANES ALLOW LONGER NONSTOPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER S. GREENBERG, Greenberg is a Los Angeles free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every time someone mentions a particularly long flight, I'll ask them: Was it 
on United Flight 806? Or Air France Flight 275? Or Qantas Flight 12? Or British 
Airways Flight 28? 
</P>
<P>
If they didn't travel on those flights, then I'll tell them that their flights 
weren't really long at all. 
</P>
<P>
Give or take a few minutes, the four flights are about the longest you can 
take. United Flight 806 is nonstop between Hong Kong and San Francisco, Air 
France Flight 275 nonstop between Tokyo and Paris, Qantas Flight 12 nonstop 
between Los Angeles and Sydney and British Airways Flight 28 nonstop between 
Hong Kong and London. 
</P>
<P>
Each flight lasts a minimum of 11 hours. And the Los Angeles-Sydney and Hong 
Kong-San Francisco runs push 14 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Those who have taken those flights, including myself, know that you have never 
truly suffered jet lag until you've taken a long-haul flight. 
</P>
<P>
And in a few months many long-haul flights will get even longer. A new 
generation of aircraft is about to come on the market that will, in many cases, 
turn one- and two-stop flights into nonstop marathons. 
</P>
<P>
Soon the Boeing 747-400 series will be operational. This extended-range version 
of the 747 is a phenomenal piece of equipment, incorporating the latest 
technology. It can carry 410 passengers and has a range of 7,340 nautical 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Horizons 
</P>
<P>
It promises to revolutionize how we travel. 
</P>
<P>
For example, no aircraft today can fly nonstop between Los Angeles and Hong 
Kong. Similarly, no aircraft can fly nonstop from New York City to India. Or 
San Francisco to Buenos Aires. Dozens of other routes require stops or changes 
of aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Although some long-haul flights are billed as "nonstop," there are still stops, 
because the aircrafts used weren't designed for the true lengths of the 
flights. 
</P>
<P>
Maximum flight range (with weight and fuel consumption taken into 
consideration) may barely equal the exact length of the flight, assuming 
everything is perfect en route. 
</P>
<P>
However, any significant head wind or weather problem often forces planes to 
make an unscheduled -- but not unanticipated -- stop. This is particularly true 
on U.S.-Hong Kong flights (planes divert to Okinawa or Taipei) and Asia-London 
flights (with stops in Bahrain or Dubai). 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the introduction of the 747-400, airline schedules and routes 
surely will be amended in our favor. 
</P>
<P>
Today, if you want to fly between the United States and Bangkok, many of you 
have to fly through Tokyo, Taipei and Hong Kong. Soon, if various governments 
approve the route, you could fly nonstop from Los Angeles or San Francisco to 
Thailand, a flight that could take 16 hours or more, depending on the weather. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to fly from San Francisco to Buenos Aires, the only airline serving 
the route is Pan Am, with a three-stop service. That, too, can change. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes a long haul is defined by the range of the aircraft, and not just the 
distance involved. An example is the weekly flight between Honolulu and 
Christmas Island in Kiribati. A few years ago the flight was handled by an old 
727, the only aircraft belonging to Air Tungaru. 
</P>
<P>
It was a tough trip for the single plane, and it wasn't long before the 727 
began to experience mechanical problems -- so many that the plane was sold and 
the airline ceased to exist. But the plane wasn't properly maintained. It has 
been replaced by a specially modified 737 operated by Aloha Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Outfitting the Planes 
</P>
<P>
In order for the 737 to make the trip, Aloha had to equip the two-engine 
aircraft with avionics and over-water safety equipment, and specially modify 
the jet to carry cargo ranging from food supplies to trucks. Soon the 737 could 
be replaced by a new generation of aircraft such as the Boeing extended-range 
767 or the Airbus 320. 
</P>
<P>
In the next two years the number of long-distance nonstop flights will zoom. 
Heinz Ruhnau, chairman of the executive board of Lufthansa, predicts that by 
the end of next year there will be almost 100 nonstop, regularly scheduled 
international legs. 
</P>
<P>
The good news about all of the new nonstop service is that single-plane nonstop 
service tends to minimize the "schlep" factor of travel. It also tends to 
minimize landing and takeoff stress to the aircraft, and reduce the number of 
mechanical problems and ground and weather delays associated with long-distance 
flying. 
</P>
<P>
But there is some potentially bad news. Other than Charles Lindbergh and a few 
other determined aviation pioneers, no one has really wanted to sit inside a 
metal cylinder for 16-plus hours. 
</P>
<P>
Even now, crew and passenger fatigue is constantly studied on long-haul 
flights. 
</P>
<P>
An essential part of long-haul flights is long-range planning. 
</P>
<P>
"From our point of view," says Mike Hardy, Cathay Pacific's director of flight 
operations, "there's a real need for precision in balancing our fuel, range and 
payload, as well as for anticipating crew needs." 
</P>
<P>
In anticipation of the new aircraft, crew fatigue is being studied. On 
long-haul flights, airlines such as Cathay Pacific carry one extra pilot and 
flight engineer in addition to the normal three-person cockpit crew. 
</P>
<P>
They're needed, too. Hong Kong-London flights take the airplane over the Soviet 
Union. "The position-reporting points over Russia are sometimes only three 
minutes apart," says Mike Hardy, director of flight operations for Cathay 
Pacific. "Life in the cockpit can get very busy." The flight also bypasses 
Syria, which adds an extra 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
KLM's Long Flights 
</P>
<P>
KLM has three long-haul flights: Amsterdam to Los Angeles, Amsterdam to Rio and 
the trans-Siberian route between Amsterdam and Tokyo. On each of these flights 
the airline carries an additional pilot and flight engineer. KLM flights bypass 
Iran. 
</P>
<P>
The new 747-400 is designed for only a two-member cockpit crew. Extra pilots 
will still travel aboard, because of the length of the flights. And new crew 
rest areas are being designed -- bunks that will give pilots rest time. 
</P>
<P>
However, a number of problems still have to be worked out. Humidification 
inside the plane is a major source of discussion among pilots and airline 
executives. 
</P>
<P>
The dehydrating effects of the circulating air inside aircraft cabins on long 
flights is already well documented. Some work has been done to increase the 
humidity in the cabin, but so far technology hasn't solved the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"In order to properly humidify the cabin, or even the cockpit," says one 
airline executive, "you need to carry a lot of water. That adds significant 
weight. What's worse is there isn't a humidification system that can do the job 
without causing intermittent showers in the passenger cabin. In the cockpit, 
that could corrode the sensitive equipment." 
</P>
<P>
Although the new aircraft will get you where you're going nonstop, there's less 
assurance that you'll arrive in better shape. For the moment, if you do plan on 
taking one of these flights, take along two or three good books, a large 
selection of stereo cassettes and an ample supply of bottled water. You'll need 
all of them.

IT'S A DOG'S DAY WHEN THE MASTER'S AWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB O'SULLIVAN, O'Sullivan is a travel writer based in Canoga Park. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When my wife and I first started traveling, we still had offspring at home who 
took care of our pets. So, at first, our problem had an easy solution. 
</P>
<P>
That didn't last. It wasn't long before our children were out on their own and 
we had to find another answer. 
</P>
<P>
"It can't be that hard," Joyce said. "What do other people do when they go away 
for a few days?" 
</P>
<P>
I checked with a friend who travels a lot. 
</P>
<P>
"It's no big deal," said Burt, stroking the big gray cat nestled in his lap. "I 
just run old Tom over to this hotel for cats. He loves it. Don't you, big 
fella?" 
</P>
<P>
But when Burt brought out his "kitty carrier" to show me how he transports the 
big fella to the "hotel," Old Tom, who had been relaxed and purring, suddenly 
went as rigid as if somebody had stuck his tail in a wall socket. The big gray 
went straight up in the air and then almost instantly disappeared under the 
sofa. 
</P>
<P>
"Loves it, huh?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Wonder what spooked him," Burt said. "Would you hand me that broom out of the 
closet? Here, kitty, kitty." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Three-Legged Dog 
</P>
<P>
When I left, Burt was still trying to fish the big fella out of the couch 
springs. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce was disturbed by my report. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it's different for dogs," I said. Since I'm allergic to cats, we didn't 
have any, but we were sure long on dogs. We had three. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, that's a slight exaggeration. We really had 2 3/4, one of our 
daughters having brought home Kubro, a mixed shepherd who had only one hind 
leg. It was this particular animal that posed our major problem. 
</P>
<P>
As the lowest common denominator in our herd, or pack, we figured that if we 
found a kennel that could cope with Kubro, our other two dogs -- Snickers and 
Josie -- wouldn't present any problems. 
</P>
<P>
Kubro had lost one back leg and had a few stabilizing steel pins inserted in 
the other as the result of a driveway accident he suffered as a puppy. 
</P>
<P>
Catherine, one of our daughters, said he followed her home. When nobody seemed 
to be buying that, she admitted that she got him from a musician friend who was 
just no longer able to cope. 
</P>
<P>
She also announced, chin quivering, that "we just have to take him because he 
hasn't got anywhere else to go and somebody's just got to turn this dog's luck 
around." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bark Worse Than Bite 
</P>
<P>
"Well," Joyce said, "is what we see all that's wrong with him?" 
</P>
<P>
Catherine looked up at the ceiling. "There is just the slightest touch of 
arthritis when his bullets bother him?" 
</P>
<P>
"His bullets?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," she explained. She scratched the dog behind the ears. "And he has an 
unusual bark, but he's sweet. Aren't you?" 
</P>
<P>
As if in answer, Kubro barked. It was so loud and sharp, the dog himself shook 
his head as if trying to clear the ringing. Then, to prove it was no accident, 
he did it again and pawed his ears. I also pawed mine; it didn't help. 
</P>
<P>
"I think his mouth is too close to his ears or something," Catherine said. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce is a "mark," a sucker for anything small and furry. And a double mark for 
anything small, furry and hurt, but she put on a show of firmness. "You'll take 
care of him? Feed him, bathe him and take total control?" 
</P>
<P>
"Of course," Catherine said. "Naturally. I promise." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Amorous Nature 
</P>
<P>
Two years later, she got an apartment closer to her work . . . and Joyce and I 
got Kubro. 
</P>
<P>
Besides having a short count in the leg department, Kubro also had one lop-ear, 
indeterminate coloration and a shaggy coat that came out in clumps in the 
presence of dark clothing or carpeting. If you combed that dog once a week, 
you'd get enough fur to make another dog. 
</P>
<P>
Kubro acquired his bullets when he was shot by someone for raiding garbage cans 
in the alley in the middle of the night, also in his puppyhood. 
</P>
<P>
There were, however, two other problems. First, he was possessed of an amorous 
nature. 
</P>
<P>
But we figured that a dog with only one back leg would be playing the game of 
romance with enough of a handicap, so we kept putting off having him fixed. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the lightning. 
</P>
<P>
But I didn't even consider telling anyone about Kubro's problems with lightning 
when I started checking around for a kennel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seller's Market 
</P>
<P>
In the Yellow Pages there were listings such as The Pet Hotel, Waggin Tails Pet 
Resort (I figured that had to have a dude-ranch motif) and The Barking Lot. 
</P>
<P>
The kennel search was surprising. First, I found that most of the operators 
considered it a seller's market. They had lists of requirements regarding 
would-be clients. 
</P>
<P>
Potential "guests" had to have shot records indicating they'd been inoculated 
against rabies, distemper, parvo (which I had always thought had something to 
do with kosher foods), kennel cough and another affliction that sounded like 
the name of a Mafia family. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the kennel operators cared not a fig if Fido was a barkaholic or stone 
crazy, as long as he was in perfect health and could come up with $10 a night 
(which would be 70 in doggie dollars). 
</P>
<P>
I only visited the places that advertised having "dog runs," not just cages. 
Though I imagined a dog run would be a place where the dog could run, in most 
instances it amounted to a few extra square feet of space in addition to a 
protected sleeping area. 
</P>
<P>
I was a little disappointed until the last place. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Good Omen 
</P>
<P>
The office was closed because it was a Sunday, but since it advertised "outside 
runs," I climbed up on a ledge and looked over the fence. There were dozens of 
small 5-by-10 chain-link fence enclosures with dog houses at the end of each 
and a tent over the whole compound. 
</P>
<P>
A caretaker was talking to the dogs as he cleaned up, and they were listening. 
That seemed like a pretty good omen, so the following day I visited the place. 
</P>
<P>
A pair of Chihuahuas in the same run were barking at nothing, while a couple of 
Dobermans, also together, were pacing. So what else is new? 
</P>
<P>
The proprietor introduced the Chihuahuas as Cheech and Chong, and the Dobermans 
as Hannibal and Hamilcar. Since the historical Hamilcar's family name was Barca 
and Hannibal was his son, they sounded like pretty good names for dogs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Comforts of Home 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," said the proprietor, "makes you wonder, though, what the dogs call 
themselves." A cocker spaniel was sitting in the next cage, staring through the 
fence, looking worried. 
</P>
<P>
"That's Florence. She's not really upset, she's just a cocker. They're only 
happy when they worry." We moved on past the runs. 
</P>
<P>
"The trouble with most people," the proprietor went on, "is that they look at 
kennels from the human standpoint. Your average dog owner wants the place to 
have all the comforts of home. Like there should be a sofa in each run and 
someone to come along and yell at each dog to get the hell off the sofa a dozen 
times a day. Don't laugh, it's almost come to that. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to look at a kennel through your dog's eyes. Dogs run in packs. 
They like to be around other dogs. It's their nature. I think a lot of these 
dogs are happier here than they are at home. 
</P>
<P>
"Dogs love to smell things. Can you imagine the smells these animals are 
enjoying now? Most of them don't know they're in a kennel. They think they're 
in Disneyland or they've been sent to camp for the summer." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Members of the Family' 
</P>
<P>
A little exaggeration maybe, but three months later when a trip came up, Joyce 
and I booked space for our dogs at the kennel. 
</P>
<P>
When Catherine heard about it, she had an attack of conscience and took Kubro 
to live with her while we were away. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks later we picked up Snickers and Josie. Both were healthy, happy and 
freshly bathed "to remove that kennel odor." Sure enough, the kennel odor was 
gone, replaced by a fragrance a neighbor said made both dogs smell like they'd 
spent the two weeks in a Bessarabian brothel. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, Catherine brought Kubro home to us. Being confined to her 
apartment while she was at work had not suited him too well. 
</P>
<P>
Once, when he had "fallen in love," he had eaten a part of her front door to 
get out. She assumed he had gotten lucky because when she bailed him out of 
jail (or the pound) three days later, he was filthy, relaxed and wagging his 
tail a lot. 
</P>
<P>
Another time, while reacting to a minor electrical storm, he had gone through 
the window. Unfortunately, the window was closed at the time. 
</P>
<P>
"He cost me a fortune," she said. "You know, keeping animals can be expensive?" 
</P>
<P>
"Zat so?" I said. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce's response was better. "When you take them in, you're making them members 
of the family. You don't think of them as an expense. Think of them as an 
investment."

TRIP OF THE WEEK: HISTORIC STATE PARK INCLUDES ELK RESERVE, FARM 
</P>

ALLENSWORTH, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's no reason to be bored on a drive through the San Joaquin Valley. 
Instead of following the freeways that speed through California's food basket, 
detour on California 43. 
</P>
<P>
That rural two-lane road will lead to an unusual state historic park, a farm 
where visitors can pick their own vegetables, a reserve for the rare tule elk 
and a recreation area that's popular with fishing folk and campers. 
</P>
<P>
From California 99 north of Bakersfield, take the Ducor/Alpaugh exit at 
Earlimart and go west on Tulare County road J22 (56 Avenue) to California 43. 
Turn left and head south about two miles to Palmer Avenue, a road that crosses 
the Santa Fe railway tracks to Colonel Allensworth State Historic Park. 
</P>
<P>
Park boundaries encompass the center of Allensworth, the only town in 
California founded by blacks. 
</P>
<P>
Today, ranger Phil Jenkins and a groundskeeper and their families are the only 
residents of Allensworth, which exceeded 200 people in its heyday. 
</P>
<P>
The town owes its name and beginning in 1908 to a former slave and U.S. Army 
chaplain, Lt. Col. Allen Allensworth. He envisioned an agricultural colony in 
which blacks could be economically and politically independent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Town Prospered 
</P>
<P>
With good soil and water wells, the town prospered. It had two general stores, 
a bakery, a barber shop, a livery stable, a drugstore, a machine shop, a hotel, 
a school and a library. 
</P>
<P>
Allensworth's demise began in 1914 with the death of its leader in a Los 
Angeles traffic accident, followed by a declining water supply. Residents moved 
away. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the town had disappeared by 1976, when the site became a state historic 
park as a monument to its black pioneers. Since then several structures have 
been restored or reconstructed. 
</P>
<P>
Head first to the visitor center to view a 30-minute video about the town. Buy 
a park map (75 cents), then walk or drive to various buildings on the flat and 
almost treeless town site. 
</P>
<P>
Signs describe past use of restored structures. Push a button at the elementary 
school, Grosse's Drug Store and Singleton's General Store for taped 
commentaries about those buildings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prefabricated House 
</P>
<P>
Visit the furnished home of Col. and Mrs. Allensworth. Their prefabricated 
house was brought in in sections by the railroad and constructed in 1910; the 
ranger will open it upon request. The school and the Smith and Hindsman houses 
will be opened if requested. 
</P>
<P>
Plans include a display of livestock and replanting of the town's experimental 
garden. The former hotel is to be reconstructed as an eight-room inn. 
Meanwhile, visitors can overnight in a campground with 15 sites (no hookups). 
There are shaded tables for picnics. 
</P>
<P>
The visitor center is open daily from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. On May 13 docents will 
give guided tours of the town during the annual Allensworth Jubilee. The park 
phone is (805) 849-3433. 
</P>
<P>
Continue south on California 43 through Wasco and Shafter and their fields of 
roses to Stockdale Highway due west of Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
Turn right and go west three miles to entrance signs for the Al Bussell Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
The Bussell clan has been growing fruits and vegetables on their farm for 29 
years, and they let visitors pick in the fields. This is the first season the 
farm has been open to the public in winter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vegetable Picks 
</P>
<P>
You'll find ripe carrots, radishes, broccoli, cabbage and turnips. Those 
vegetables are also sold in the farm shed. Oranges, pears and apples are 
available, too. Open daily, 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Youngsters can pet the farm animals and play in a maze created with bales of 
hay. Sandwiches and beverages are available at a refreshment stand. For an 
update of what is ripe for picking, call the Bussell Ranch at (805) 589-2324 or 
(805) 589-0595. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of tule elk once roamed California's valleys, but hunters and loss of 
grazing lands to agriculture almost destroyed this subspecies. Forty-nine of 
the rare animals still roam in the 350-acre Tule Elk State Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
Continue west on Stockdale Highway more than a mile past the Interstate 5 
overpass and turn left on Morris Road. At its end, go right on Station Road to 
the reserve headquarters. When there has been little rain, the elk frequently 
come to a watering hole near the viewing area; take binoculars to help see 
these shy animals. 
</P>
<P>
Continue west on Station Road, turn left on Tupman Road that follows the 
California Aqueduct to Taft Highway/California 119, and turn left again to 
reach Enos Lane. Then turn right (south) to the Buena Vista Aquatic Recreation 
Area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Boaters, Campers 
</P>
<P>
In summer this Kern County park overflows with boaters, swimmers and campers 
trying to beat the valley's heat. This time of year, however, there is plenty 
of room to enjoy its two man-made lakes. 
</P>
<P>
In 1973 water was pumped into the dry Buena Vista Lake bed to create Lake Webb, 
a favorite of boaters, and the smaller Lake Evans, where fishermen try for 
trout. 
</P>
<P>
Camping is available without reservations; it's $12 to $15 per vehicle per 
site, $14 to $18 with full hookup. Day-use entry is $3 per vehicle. Trout 
fishing costs $3.50 extra per person, $1.50 for ages 8 to 15. 
</P>
<P>
Return to Los Angeles by going north on Enos Lane to California 119/Taft 
Highway and turning right to Interstate 5. 
</P>
<P>
Round trip between Los Angeles and the San Joaquin Valley is 328 miles.

DINING IN HAWAII; 
</P>
<P>
NEW WAVE OF SPECIALTY CUISINE HITS BIG ISLAND

KAMUELA, Hawaii 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once a week Mrs. Lu hikes a treacherous trail to the bottom of the Waipio 
Valley to gather fern shoots -- luscious, fiddle-headed vegetables used in 
salads. 
</P>
<P>
On the slopes of Mauna Kea, Nancy Lindsey grows poha berries -- tart berries 
similar to a Cape gooseberry, and combines them with pineapple or papaya to 
create delectable preserves. 
</P>
<P>
And in the green, eucalyptus-studded countryside of Honokaa, Richard and Laura 
Spiegel process a delicate white honey from nectar gathered by bees in 
oceanside kiawe groves. 
</P>
<P>
These entrepreneurs are part of a growing creativity of food and flavor that 
has hit the Big Island of Hawaii. Encouraged by bright young chefs in the 
hotels and restaurants along the Kona/Kohala Coast, farmers on Hawaii are 
growing such specialties as Waimea lettuce and Kamuela spinach in the 
mineral-rich volcanic soil. 
</P>
<P>
Lamb and veal are organically grown, and abalone is farmed in the waters off 
the Kona Coast. Long famous for its macadamia nut orchards and Kona coffee 
plantations, the Big Island is now at the center of an emerging Hawaiian 
cuisine that combines innovative techniques with the best of locally produced 
ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rave Reviews Earned 
</P>
<P>
Chief exponent of the new cuisine is Peter Merriman, who served a three-year 
stint as chef at the Gallery restaurant at the Mauna Lani Racquet Club. In 
December he opened his own restaurant, Merriman's, in Waimea. 
</P>
<P>
"I describe what I do as American regional cuisine that comes from Hawaii," he 
said as workers put the finishing touches to the Hawaiian Art Deco decor of the 
new establishment. "It's not the traditional island dishes such as poi and 
chicken luau. But I take ingredients that are grown here on the island and give 
them a new twist." 
</P>
<P>
One new twist that was a favorite at the Gallery and is also served at 
Merriman's is wok-charred ahi, an appetizer of fresh tuna, raw in the center 
and lightly charred on the outside. It was served here before being copied by 
mainland chefs. Other appetizers are kalua pig pate and pineapple poki -- raw 
tuna marinated in soy sauce and spices and served with pineapple and nori 
(fresh seaweed). 
</P>
<P>
"They're growing fresh seaweed here now that is wonderful," Merriman says. "In 
fact, the local farmers provide us with almost everything we need -- fresh 
vegetables and herbs. There's a farmer in Waimea who is raising veal the 
old-fashioned natural way, and Kahua Ranch is providing me with excellent fresh 
lamb. And catfish is being raised off the Kohala Coast." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Four Ways With Fish 
</P>
<P>
Whether it's mahi-mahi, opakapaka or any of the seafood that is caught locally, 
the fresh fish of the day can be prepared any of four ways. On our visit the 
choices were baked in filo and served in a saffron/dill sauce, broiled and 
served with a fresh tomato/herb sauce, steamed in ginger or sauteed with lemon 
and capers. Desserts feature such local ingredients as macadamia nuts and fresh 
coconut. All of the entrees are under $20. 
</P>
<P>
Other chefs on the island are also making the most of Hawaii's bounty. Daniel 
Thiebaut, executive chef at the Mauna Kea Beach Hotel, features local produce 
in The Garden restaurant, a quietly elegant room decorated with hand-carved 
wooden bowls from South Pacific islands. 
</P>
<P>
We began with a Waimanu breadfruit soup, similar to a squash soup but smoother 
and richer. Waimea lettuce was crisp and fresh, and a smoked chicken salad was 
topped with Mrs. Lu's fernshoots. Roast loin of wild boar in a pineapple and 
ohelo berry glaze was flavorful without being overly strong. And Mauna Kea 
lau-lau, fresh fish flavored with ginger and steamed in ti leaves, was tender, 
slightly sweet and heavenly. 
</P>
<P>
Dessert highlights were a chocolate haupia, a pudding-like combination of 
chocolate and coconut, and a strawberry gratin, a creamy concoction layered 
with fresh strawberries and topped with a passion fruit glaze. Entrees from $20 
to $32; appetizers, soups and desserts $4 to $9. 
</P>
<P>
Other hotels along this coast also feature regional specialties. Meals at Kona 
Village are for resort guests only, but the Friday night luau -- one of the 
best and most authentic in the islands -- is open to the public at $46. The 
Kona Provision Co., in the new amusement park-like Hyatt Regency Waikoloa, 
serves salads, sandwiches and local seafoods in a setting overlooking the 
Pacific, from $7 to $14. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Casual Treatment 
</P>
<P>
For a casual treatment of local specialties there's We're Talk'N Pizza, a pizza 
parlor in Kawaihae. Plants and changing art exhibits decorate the room. Started 
last year by David L. Palmer, a former chef at the Mauna Lani Bay Hotel, the 
restaurant features such pizzas as Di Mare, with scallops, bay shrimp, clams 
and calamari; Greek, with black olives, sweet peppers, feta cheese and wilted 
spinach, and Al Pesto, with fresh basil pesto, sun-dried tomatoes and eggplant. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer's wheat flour crust -- made with virgin olive oil and local honey -- is 
the best we have had. Desserts -- a mango cheesecake and pecan pie -- were 
exceptional. Pizzas cost $4.95 to $9.95 (small), $7.95 to $15.95 (medium) and 
$11.95 to $21.95 (large). 
</P>
<P>
For breakfast there's the Terrace restaurant at the Mauna Lani Bay Hotel. Order 
malasadas, deep-fried Portuguese doughnuts that are light as a cloud and 
habit-forming. They're served every day but Sunday and Monday when Horio, the 
malasadas chef, is off. (He won't share his recipe.) 
</P>
<P>
Or try the Kamuela Bread Depot in Waimea, where local ranchers and business 
people gather in the morning to drink coffee and devour Georges Amtablian and 
Louise Belt's paniolo bread and huge, sticky cinnamon rolls. 
</P>
<P>
Also popular with residents is the Edelweiss, where chef Hans-Peter Hager, who 
used to work at both the Mauna Kea and the Mauna Lani, serves such German 
specialties as Wiener schnitzel and roast pork with sauerkraut. Most entrees 
are under $20. Another former hotel chef, Bree Bernd from the Mauna Kea, has 
just opened Bree Gardens, also in Waimea. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Most Memorable Meal 
</P>
<P>
Yet of all the meals we had on the Big Island our most memorable was at 
Teshima's, a small Japanese restaurant on the side of Highway 11 near Kona. Red 
lanterns were hung around the room and the sultry air was cooled by ceiling 
fans. We sat at a formica-topped table decorated with anthurium blossoms and 
listened as the restaurant's owner, 82-year-old Mary Teshima, reminisced. 
</P>
<P>
"During the war the American soldiers would come here and I would make sukiyaki 
for them," she said. "They were all homesick, and my husband and I were like a 
second family to them. 
</P>
<P>
"I would write to their mothers on the mainland, and they would write back; of 
course, we couldn't mention anything about the war. Now some of the soldiers 
still come back. They come to the window and say, 'Is Mary still living?' Well, 
here I am." 
</P>
<P>
Mary, known to everyone as "Granny Teshima," is about four feet tall and has 
the energy of a volcano. She sat and talked with us while her granddaughter 
Trudy brought out plates of sashimi. 
</P>
<P>
"During the war it was difficult to get salt and rice," Granny said. "I had to 
give all the rice to my customers, and my children had to eat potatoes. But 
they learned to like them." 
</P>
<P>
While listening to her stories we ate some of the best Japanese food we've ever 
had. The sashimi, freshly caught and flavorful, was followed by crisp, light 
tempura. The flavors in the sukiyaki were rich and the tofu was perfect. 
</P>
<P>
Granny told us the secret of the tofu: "They make the tofu across the street. 
It's fresh every day." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Special Dessert Treat 
</P>
<P>
After we finished the meal, which cost about $15 each, Granny announced that 
she had a special treat for dessert: chocolate mousse. We were doubtful, but 
not wanting to appear rude, we said we'd love to try some. 
</P>
<P>
It was incredible -- rich, dark, thick chocolate mousse that could hold its own 
in the finest French restaurant. It seems that a young woman named Jane, one of 
Trudy's tennis partners, makes mousse and always brings some by for Granny 
Teshima to serve. 
</P>

NONSMOKERS SPEAK OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was distressed and frustrated to read Dirlam's article. My husband and I are 
nonsmokers and travel a fair amount of miles. Due to my husband's illness (post 
open-heart surgery), we seek nonsmoking areas everywhere. It is not just a 
matter of preference, but of life and death! Why wasn't the airline named? Why 
should they be protected if the story was true? Please do not protect companies 
that have no regard for their customers. And do not publish such articles again 
unless companies are named.

NONSMOKERS SPEAK OUT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Thank you for Sharon Dirlam's article, "A Nightmare Flight Leaves Nonsmokers 
Fuming" (Jan. 15). I could relate some other horror stories concerning groups. 
I have "no smoking" coaches on my tours, so I seldom have smokers on the trips. 
Also, I always book 28 no-smoking seats with the airlines when I plan the 
tours. 
</P>
<P>
However, on departure I have had many passengers placed in the smoking section. 
I no longer book the two air carriers that have let me down, and I let them 
know why. Airlines of other nations are the worst. I'll keep letting airlines 
know why I no longer book them for groups. Maybe we'll prevail.

A SPECIAL KINDNESS

<TEXT>
<P>
Anyone who could read "An Act of Kindness in 1933 Is Still Remembered" (Jan. 
22), by Bob O'Sullivan, and not be moved would be hard-hearted, indeed. That 
one act on the part of the manager of the Harvey House restaurant should have 
earned him a special visa through the pearly gates.

Thank you, thank you, thank you for having the courage to speak out. The 
groveling and genuflecting to the Reagans is an anathema, disheartening and 
disgusting to me.

It is wonderful to find a person gutsy enough and not afraid to speak out and 
tell it like it is.

The car cruised through a dimly lit north Pomona neighborhood known as "the 
Islands" on a recent Sunday night. A young gang member aimed a semi-automatic 
military assault rifle through an open window and pulled the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the shooting stopped, five people had been injured and a sixth, 
19-year-old Guadalupe Carrillo Garcia, was dead from a bullet wound to the 
stomach. Police don't believe that any of the victims were gang members. They 
were just unlucky enough to be on the streets when a gang from elsewhere in the 
city came to settle a score. 
</P>
<P>
The night before, Charles Bradford Thomas, 30, a suspected gang member, was 
killed in a drive-by shooting as he stood on the street in a northwest Pomona 
neighborhood known as "Sintown." Police said the shooting was apparently the 
result of a dispute between two rival gangs over drug-dealing territory. 
</P>
<P>
A 17-year-old suspected gang member, whose name was not released because of his 
age, was arrested on suspicion of murder in connection with the retaliatory 
shooting spree. Police said they have not identified any suspects in the 
shooting that triggered the violence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bloods or Crips 
</P>
<P>
Police refused to name the gangs involved because they did not want to glorify 
their exploits. However, they said most black gangs are affiliated with either 
the Bloods or Crips, two Los Angeles-based gangs marked by their display of the 
colors red or blue, their involvement in the drug trade, and their violent 
antipathy for each other. 
</P>
<P>
According to residents of northern Pomona, the Islands belong to a gang 
affiliated with the Bloods, while Sintown is Crips territory. And either 
neighborhood can be the site of bloodshed at anytime. 
</P>
<P>
Both areas have been relatively peaceful since the shooting spree on Jan. 22, 
but police and residents are bracing for the next round of confrontations and 
pay-backs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been quiet since then," said Sgt. Gary Elofson, who heads the Pomona 
Police Department's Crimes Against Persons Unit. "We don't expect it to stay 
that way." 
</P>
<P>
Last month's shootings started the year off ominously in Pomona, which had only 
two homicides involving black street gangs last year. Police are reluctant to 
describe the incidents as symptomatic of increased activity by gangs affiliated 
with Bloods and Crips, but others who monitor youth crime in the city are not. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really gotten out of hand," said Joe Barbosa, a deputy probation officer 
with the Los Angeles County Probation Department. "They're more aggressive 
right now, the Crips in particular. I have a lot of juveniles, a lot of Crips, 
getting busted left and right. A lot of it has to do with the dealing of crack 
cocaine." 
</P>
<P>
In areas where Bloods and Crips are active, residents have grown accustomed to 
the sound of gunfire and routinely keep children indoors when they hear rumors 
of an incident brewing. 
</P>
<P>
"When I hear shooting, I stay in the house," said a resident of the Islands who 
asked not to be quoted by name. 
</P>
<P>
"What's making it worse is all these drugs and (the gangs) trying to take over 
each other's territories. . . . Don't print my name in the newspaper. I don't 
want nobody shooting us up." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Latino gangs that have waged turf wars in Pomona for decades, gangs 
in predominantly black areas are less prone to territorial violence. Instead, 
they are more likely to be fighting for a share of the market in the booming 
crack cocaine trade, police said. 
</P>
<P>
And while police, working in conjunction with Catholic churches, have had some 
success in cooling tensions among Latino gangs through summit meetings, no such 
avenue to peace exists with black gangs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'More Traditional Gangs' 
</P>
<P>
"The Hispanic gangs are the more traditional gangs, protective of turf and 
territory," said Police Chief Richard Tefank. "The black gangs are also 
protective of turf and territory, but mainly as it relates to areas in which 
they sell drugs." 
</P>
<P>
The intense rivalry among drug traffickers has been exacerbated, police said, 
by the easy availability of semi-automatic assault rifles. Originally designed 
for use by the armies of the United States, Israel and the Soviet Union, the 
rifles have become the weapons of choice in street warfare. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that makes this violence so much more critical to a community is the 
weaponry that these people, who have no regard for human life, have access to," 
Tefank said. "The last incident was tragic because it was an example of the 
firepower these individuals possess as they drive through a neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
In light of a shooting incident last month in which a gunman fired into a 
crowded playground at a Stockton elementary school with an AK-47 assault rifle, 
killing several children, bills have been introduced in the state Legislature 
to restrict the sale of such weapons or ban them outright. 
</P>
<P>
The Pomona City Council has drafted resolutions urging the Legislature to 
prohibit semi-automatic rifles and asking members of Congress to cut off 
foreign aid to countries in which illegal drugs are produced. However, not 
everyone on the council approves of a ban on assault rifles. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm against that," said Councilman C. L. (Clay) Bryant. "It's like the 
(National Rifle Assn.) says: 'Guns don't kill people -- people kill people.' . 
. . The bad guys love to see the good guys being disarmed." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Weapons Ban 
</P>
<P>
Tefank argued that a ban of such weapons is a crucial first step toward 
controlling gang violence in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
"The ridiculousness of letting someone purchase a weapon like that across the 
counter immediately needs to be addressed," Tefank said. "Then, simply the mere 
possession of the weapon would be an arrestable offense. You wouldn't have to 
wait for someone to use it." 
</P>
<P>
But until -- or if -- the Legislature takes action, the weapons are readily 
available at gun stores. Purchasers may take assault rifles home immediately, 
unlike handguns, for which there is a 15-day waiting period during which 
authorities check the buyer's background. And police fear some of those 
customers are gang members. 
</P>
<P>
"It definitely makes us out-gunned," Elofson said. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona police are also overmatched. There are an estimated 1,300 gang members 
in the city, but the police force has only 152 sworn officers, Tefank said. 
Because of budget constraints, the department has increased its size by eight 
officers over the last 10 years. During the same time, Pomona's population 
jumped from 85,000 to 119,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arrest Rate Rising 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Pomona police arrested 9,672 people, an increase of 26.4% over the 
number arrested in 1987. More than 30% of those arrests were related to gang 
activity or drug dealing. Police said 135 gang members were arrested for 
drug-related offenses last year. Arrests of juvenile offenders suspected of 
felonies rose 61%. 
</P>
<P>
Police last weekend mounted an intensive "sweep" in an attempt to stifle gang 
activity in north Pomona. Officers in the department's Major Crimes Task Force 
arrested 30 suspected gang members for offenses ranging from parole violation, 
which can include simply associating with gang members or sporting gang colors, 
to drug dealing and gun possession. 
</P>
<P>
"The pressure's going to continue," said Lt. Charles Heilman, one of two 
detectives specializing in gang activity. "One of (the gangs') primary 
functions is cocaine dealing, and the more heat we put on them, the more 
difficult it is for them to sell their drugs." 
</P>
<P>
Tefank has asked the City Council for funds to hire an additional 25 sworn 
officers and 10 "paraprofessional" officers who would fill out accident reports 
and perform other routine duties to free police to spend more time on the 
street. 
</P>
<P>
However, City Administrator A. J. Wilson has advised the City Council that the 
expansion, with an expected cost of more than $1.4 million a year, is not 
feasible given Pomona's lean budget. Wilson had suggested that the council 
could add some officers if it delayed a cut in the city's unpopular 11% payroll 
tax, but the council declined to take this politically dangerous step. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said that in light of the most recent spate of shootings, council members 
may now have to "bite the bullet" and take whatever measures are necessary to 
provide more police. But, she said, even a major increase in the number of 
officers would not bring gang violence to an end. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Solution Is Education 
</P>
<P>
"We could put 30, 40, 50 more officers on the street and throw a lot of money 
at the problem and still not stop it," Smith said. "The problem is larger than 
Pomona." 
</P>
<P>
Tefank agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"More officers are part of the solution, but the reality is you can't have 
officers everywhere 24 hours a day," he said. "The long-term solution is 
education for the young people not to be involved in gangs and a job level 
where they won't have to get involved with drug-dealing." 
</P>
<P>
City officials and community leaders agree that education and economics are at 
the root of the city's gang and drug problems. 
</P>
<P>
Gang members are often dropouts or poor students who are unqualified to work at 
anything but minimum-wage jobs. They are attracted to gang life by the easy 
money to be made selling crack. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as they're making $500 a day dealing drugs, there's no way they're 
going to take a $3.65-an-hour job," Bryant said, repeating a truism. "There has 
to be more in life for them than standing on the streets dealing drugs. That's 
a hell of an environment. And we're providing that kind of environment." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said the city is working with civic organizations to provide recreation 
programs for younger teen-agers and is receiving help from local companies to 
give gang members job skills and opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Out of Gangs, Into Jobs' 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to get these people out of gangs and into jobs," she said. "We're 
trying to show people that belonging to a gang is not glamorous, and if you get 
involved in that way of life, you're going to pay the consequences." 
</P>
<P>
Willie White, outreach director for the Pomona YMCA, is among those who must 
try to persuade gang members to give up their lucrative but dangerous life 
styles. The proliferation of single-parent households subsisting on welfare and 
the dearth of job opportunities make that task all the more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the kids are supporting their families by selling drugs," White said. 
"I don't blame the kids for a lot these things. I blame the parents, I blame 
the elected officials and I blame the educators. Until our leaders make up 
their minds that they really want to do something about these drugs and 
weapons, we're still going to have them." 
</P>
<P>
The task of correcting large-scale social problems of poverty and poor 
education, like efforts to stem the flow of drugs and arms, seem beyond the 
scope of community organizations, city councils and local law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Fighting for Our Lives' 
</P>
<P>
"As cities, we're fighting for our lives and we're just not getting the help 
and support from the higher levels of government," Smith said. "We cannot do it 
alone." 
</P>
<P>
Until the answer to the gang dilemma is found, White will keep trying his sales 
pitch on the jaded teen-agers who earn their livelihoods while risking death on 
the streets of north Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
Said White: "A lot of these young people try to tell me how well they're doing 
and how much money they've got in their pockets. I turn around and tell them: 
'The guy who's taken the minimum-wage job may be struggling, but at least he 
doesn't have to look over his shoulder every time he hears a car backfire. A 
lot of people in your line of work don't live past 35.' "

THE EMINENT BATTLE OVER CITY'S POWER TO CONDEMN

MONTEBELLO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Registered voters are coveted and courted these days outside a Ralphs market on 
Whittier Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Activist Larry Salazar asked a shopper to sign petitions aimed at recalling 
City Council members Arnold M. Glasman, William Nighswonger, Art Payan and 
Kathy Salazar (who is not related to the activist). "They're not interested in 
listening to the people," he told the shopper. 
</P>
<P>
But supporters of the council members did not let that pass. "You should go (to 
a council meeting). You'd learn firsthand," said passer-by Maria Rodriguez, who 
assured the shopper that the targeted politicians are sensitive to residents. 
</P>
<P>
The shopper walked away without signing Salazar's petition, saying she needed 
to consider the matter further. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Decision Polarized Activists 
</P>
<P>
Community activists seldom have been as polarized in Montebello as they are now 
over a Nov. 28 decision by the council majority to give the city's 
Redevelopment Agency condemnation power to spur redevelopment in two areas of 
South Montebello. 
</P>
<P>
Just a few weeks ago, the South Montebello Area Residents Together group used 
the same parking lot to gather signatures for a successful petition drive that 
prompted the City Council last week to schedule a special election. Voters will 
decide the eminent domain issue May 2. In the meantime, the two eminent domain 
ordinances have been suspended. 
</P>
<P>
"With all of the controversy that's taken place, . . . I want the people to 
decide," Payan said last week. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides say the city's future is at stake, but they could not disagree more 
over how the condemnation power would affect that future. 
</P>
<P>
The four council members, most of their supporters and city staff members said 
the measures would give the city the tools it needs to attract modern, cleaner 
industry and business that would provide tax revenue needed to pay for adequate 
public services, including police and fire protection. 
</P>
<P>
Residents Together and a recently formed coalition of businessmen and residents 
called Montebello Cares oppose the ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
Residents said the use of eminent domain would make their neighborhoods 
unbearable because the city has not planned properly to protect them from 
increased traffic, noise and pollution that would result from increased 
development. 
</P>
<P>
Businessmen who belong to Montebello Cares said it could be financially 
devastating and unfair if they are forced to give up property so another 
business can move in, even if that business would provide more revenue for city 
government. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Zones Mostly Industrial 
</P>
<P>
The two redevelopment zones, which cover about 620 acres, are mostly 
industrial, with some commercial businesses and spots of residential areas. In 
some cases, homes abut such industrial operations as truck yards. Modern 
buildings are mixed with aging industrial and residential structures. 
</P>
<P>
Recall proponents said they have long been dissatisfied with the four council 
members, but the issue of eminent domain triggered the drive. 
</P>
<P>
But many Montebello residents seem to be split on the recall and eminent domain 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
Some members of Residents Together, such as Larry Salazar, are participating in 
the recall bid organized by activist Shirley Garcia, also a member of the 
group. Others have chosen to work only on the campaign to invalidate the 
eminent domain ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side, prominent local developer Phillip Pace has joined 
anti-recall forces, while strongly opposing the use of eminent domain for 
redevelopment. "They're two completely separate issues," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At first, the eminent domain foes consisted almost entirely of residents of 
South Montebello. But recently, business owners in the affected areas joined 
the fray. They supplied most of a $95,000 legal war chest for Montebello Cares, 
the recently formed coalition of Montebello business people and residents. 
</P>
<P>
The group has sued in a bid to block the eminent domain ordinances even if the 
city's voters do not strike them down May 2. 
</P>
<P>
"In 30 years, this has probably been the most intense issue," said Councilman 
Edward C. Pizzorno, who opposes the bid to give the redevelopment agency 
condemnation power and is the only council member not targeted for recall. 
</P>
<P>
Forces both for and against using eminent domain have not completed plans, but 
they have pledged strong campaigns that could rival those waged for City 
Council seats. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Salazar, the council's most vocal advocate of the ordinances, said 
she will do "whatever it takes" to get voter approval. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dairyman's Fears 
</P>
<P>
Raymond Broguiere, chairman of Montebello Cares and a member of Residents 
Together, said he was busy last week arranging for posters to be made to urge a 
vote against the eminent domain measures. He said eminent domain foes will put 
out flyers describing their position and may hire an election consultant. 
</P>
<P>
More than 60 people, mostly businessmen, have contributed to the Montebello 
Cares legal fund, said Broguiere, who owns Montebello Sanitary Dairy. 
</P>
<P>
"Eminent domain -- it's just wrong," Broguiere said. "When eminent domain is 
there, you no longer own your property. You're stripped of your ownership 
rights." 
</P>
<P>
Broguiere, a third-generation dairyman, said his business produces little tax 
revenue for the city, so he figures that his property would be vulnerable if 
the Redevelopment Agency is given condemnation power. He said a move could cost 
him his business, because he counts on sales to customers who come to buy milk 
at a dairy they have patronized for decades. Broguiere's grandfather founded 
the dairy in 1920. 
</P>
<P>
"They could move me to another place and I'd slowly go broke," Broguiere said. 
"I'd like to see my son one day take it over -- the fourth generation." 
</P>
<P>
Redevelopment officials said no properties have been targeted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Attract Development 
</P>
<P>
The four council members are adamant. Like the city's redevelopment staff 
members, the council members said the Redevelopment Agency needs eminent domain 
so that it can quickly piece together sizable parcels of land to attract new 
commercial and industrial developments. 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, a redevelopment agency equipped with the power of eminent 
domain can force unwilling property owners to sell property to the agency at 
fair market value. Owner-occupied, single-family homes would be exempt from 
eminent domain under the ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
Without eminent domain, a single property owner could stall a project and cost 
the city future jobs and tax revenue to pay for government, proponents say. 
This year, the city expects to spend about $1 million more than it will take in 
for general services. The city will draw from reserves to make up the 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
"Montebello has to grow," Councilwoman Salazar said. "Montebello has to 
progress, and we need the money to do that. The people demand certain services, 
a good fire department, a good police department. Eminent domain and the 
Redevelopment Agency are ways of being able to have an income to satisfy the 
needs of the community." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Cities Have It 
</P>
<P>
Montebello redevelopment officials have long said they need the power of 
eminent domain to compete with surrounding cities, such as Pico Rivera, whose 
redevelopment agency has condemnation power. 
</P>
<P>
Pico Rivera Assistant City Manager David Caretto said eminent domain was used 
to assemble parcels for five major commercial and residential projects along 
Whittier Boulevard, which has been transformed into a modern commercial hub. 
</P>
<P>
Montebello Assistant City Administrator Victor Grgas said the city has received 
several inquiries from "substantial" industries that heard the city would have 
condemnation power and are interested in moving to Montebello. Grgas declined 
to identify the firms. 
</P>
<P>
But Montebello Cares members said city officials should live within the budget 
and not try to generate more tax income at the expense of unwilling property 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
Eminent domain foes said the city has been able to attract businesses to its 
redevelopment areas without having to condemn property. Broguiere said the city 
could offer grants or other incentives to help renovate run-down properties. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Previous Successes 
</P>
<P>
The city has had redevelopment successes, having participated in seven sizable 
projects since 1984, said Linda Payan, manager of economic development and wife 
of Councilman Payan, one of the supporters of eminent domain. 
</P>
<P>
The largest of those projects, the $100-million Montebello Town Center mall, 
was built on vacant land in a redevelopment zone in North Montebello. The 
Redevelopment Agency has condemnation power in the 997-acre zone, but it has 
not used it, Linda Payan said. 
</P>
<P>
But the power could be helpful in the South Montebello zones, which are more 
densely developed, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Residents Together, the homeowners group, and Montebello Cares would appear to 
be strange allies. Many contributors to the Montebello Cares legal fund own 
trucking and trash-hauling firms. Residents Together members have complained 
about noisy, smoking trucks running through and near their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Two lawsuits recently filed by Montebello Cares accuse city officials of 
approving environmental impact reports that greatly understate the traffic, 
pollution and noise that would result from accelerated development if eminent 
domain were used. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Advisory Committee 
</P>
<P>
The suits also accuse the city of violating many provisions of state law during 
the months-long process to approve the ordinances. One of the alleged 
violations is that the city did not properly form an advisory citizens' 
committee to consider the ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
The residents' concerns over pollution were apparently heard. 
</P>
<P>
After the council tentatively approved the ordinances Nov. 14, Glasman 
addressed the members of the business community: "If your business is clean, if 
you provide jobs, if you provide sales tax revenues and you don't create air or 
noise pollution and you don't represent a danger to our community, then we want 
you in Montebello." 
</P>
<P>
The councilman later said he favors fewer trucking firms and fewer companies 
that deal with hazardous materials. 
</P>
<P>
Trucking and trash-hauling firms feel particularly vulnerable to eminent 
domain, said Gary Hairabedian, a Montebello Cares organizer who runs G. H. 
Disposal, a small trash-hauling firm on South Maple Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"They're already classifying us as unclean," Hairabedian said. 
</P>
<P>
He also noted that trucking firms produce relatively little tax revenue for the 
city. "They're basically saying we don't want you here, because we're not 
making money off you," he said. "What gives them the right?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Support From Others 
</P>
<P>
Even though foes of eminent domain collected enough signatures to force an 
election, the council majority's approval of the eminent domain ordinances 
enjoys strong support from many city leaders. 
</P>
<P>
City Treasurer Phillip M. Ramos has spoken for the eminent domain proposal, as 
have 12 city commissioners, who are appointed by council members. Former 
Councilwoman Elaine Kirchner and former Fire Chief Bob Metz also added their 
support. 
</P>
<P>
While a group has not yet been formed to campaign for the council position, the 
foundations of such an organization have been established. 
</P>
<P>
The four targeted council members and Rick Salazar, Councilwoman Salazar's 
husband, have formed a political action committee to fight the recall. Its 
chairwoman, Irene Lopez, said the group has about 160 members, with about 40 
people attending an organizational meeting last week. 
</P>
<P>
Recall organizer Shirley Garcia said last week her forces have gathered more 
than 2,500 of the 4,520 signatures they need to qualify a recall election on 
the four council members. Recall proponents have until March 9 to gather 
signatures.

MCGRATH LEVELS ATTACK OVER YAROSLAVSKY FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Assuming the role of political provocateur in the Los Angeles City Council's 
sluggish 5th District race, Jack McGrath accused Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky of 
violating campaign finance laws and dodging debates at a freewheeling press 
conference Thursday in front of Yaroslavsky's City Hall office. 
</P>
<P>
McGrath, a former Yaroslavsky campaign manager and aide, said the councilman 
has failed to return $1.8 million collected when he considered running for 
mayor. McGrath also said Yaroslavsky has yet to repay a $100,000 loan he 
received when he was promoting Proposition O, the successful citywide ballot 
measure that outlawed oil drilling in Pacific Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
"Zev has serious financial problems," McGrath said. "Have any of these checks 
been returned? . . . I think that Zev is in deep doo doo." 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky's office immediately rebutted McGrath's charges. Campaign manager 
Karin Caves said McGrath is "absolutely off the wall." She said Yaroslavsky has 
already started returning his mayoral campaign money. 
</P>
<P>
"More than 4,000 checks have to be hand written," Caves said. "That's 
unprecedented. No one has had to do that before. Everyone has been working on 
it. We've been working on it for a week, and we're moving as fast as we can." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, McGrath was one of Yaroslavsky's 4,000 contributors. He has asked 
that his $500 be forwarded to the Salvation Army, Caves said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Loan Outstanding 
</P>
<P>
On the matter of Yaroslavsky's $100,000 loan, Caves said the money came from 
Bill Haber, an entertainment agent who is a longtime supporter. 
</P>
<P>
Caves confirmed that the loan is still outstanding. She said Yaroslavsky 
intends to repay it out of his "Friends of Yaroslavsky" campaign treasury. 
Caves would not say how much money Yaroslavsky has on hand, not counting the 
funds raised for his mayoral bid, but she denied he is in financial trouble. 
</P>
<P>
McGrath, however, said Yaroslavsky needs to be more forthcoming with the 
voters. He said thecouncilman has ignored invitations to a series of forums. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Yaroslavsky has got to come out of the Rose Garden," McGrath said. "Zev 
has got to come and meet his maker." 
</P>
<P>
McGrath, who ran Yaroslavsky's first campaign, said he was referring to himself 
as Yaroslavsky's maker. "I made him in 1975," McGrath said. "And I want to tell 
Zev that it's time for him to return to the private sector." 
</P>
<P>
Once again, however, Caves said McGrath was playing fast and loose with the 
facts. She said Yaroslavsky has agreed to debate his four opponents whenever he 
can make the time. "We have priorities, but we do expect to engage in debates 
whenever Zev's schedule permits it," Caves said. 
</P>
<P>
McGrath, 43, a late entry in the 5th District council race, is seen as a long 
shot. Yaroslavsky's other opponents include Westwood activist Laura M. Lake, 
traffic consultant Ryan Snyder and artist Henry Hill. 
</P>
<P>
At his Thursday press conference, McGrath said he has raised about $7,000 so 
far, most of which has gone to pay for a political advertisement on cable 
television. The North Hollywood resident, who is on leave from his real estate 
job during the campaign, said he expects to run a grass-roots campaign. 
</P>
<P>
McGrath said the 5th District has gone to seed under Yaroslavsky. He pledged to 
slow commercial growth and generally improve the quality of life for 5th 
District residents who are burdened by heavy traffic congestion and commercial 
development. McGrath said he would limit himself to two terms. 
</P>
<P>
"My message is obvious," McGrath said. "It's time for a change."

EL MONTE FACING PARAMEDIC 'GAP'; 
</P>
<P>
OFFICIALS FEAR TRAUMA PATIENTS MAY SUFFER BECAUSE OF INSUFFICIENT LEVEL OF 
SERVICE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
City officials are trying to cope with what they call a "critical gap" in the 
emergency care system when the city's only paramedic unit is in service, often 
leaving the city without paramedic coverage. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest problem, according to El Monte Fire Chief Leslie E. George, is that 
El Monte's paramedic team takes a majority of its trauma calls to County-USC 
Medical Center, about 12 miles away near downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Also, many local emergency rooms sometimes refuse to accept patients because of 
overcrowding, forcing the paramedics to transport non-trauma patients to 
County-USC or hospitals out of the area, George said. 
</P>
<P>
"Almost daily, we get incidents where we need paramedics and we don't have 
them," George said. "It can take them 20 minutes to get in (to County-USC) and 
an hour and a half to get back," George said. 
</P>
<P>
Although paramedics are on duty 24 hours a day, only one team is in service at 
any one time. 
</P>
<P>
When the paramedic team is tied up, critical-care and trauma calls are handled 
by less-trained emergency medical technicians. The technicians, either city 
firefighters or ambulance operators, can perform basic life-support procedures, 
such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation, but lack the advanced training and 
equipment to adequately deal with critical trauma cases, said El Monte 
Battalion Chief Ernest Jensen. 
</P>
<P>
"The paramedics can do almost anything that can be done in the emergency room, 
and they are supervised by a doctor," George said. "(The technicians) can only 
do so much. . . . It's a critical situation." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deepening Crisis 
</P>
<P>
El Monte's problem is caused in large part by the deepening crisis faced by the 
county's emergency medical network. The Jan. 1 closure of the trauma center at 
Methodist Hospital in Arcadia may have brought the situation to a head, fire 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena's Huntington Memorial Medical Center, the only trauma center in the 
San Gabriel Valley, expanded some of its territory after Methodist Hospital 
dropped out of the system but cannot provide all the needed care. 
</P>
<P>
Emergency rooms at local hospitals, including Greater El Monte Community 
Hospital, Arcadia Methodist and Terrace Plaza Medical Center in Baldwin Park, 
have occasionally refused to accept more patients in recent weeks. In addition, 
Santa Teresita Hospital in Duarte closed its emergency room permanently this 
month, a move expected to increase the load at surrounding hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like pond ripples," George said. "Once one closes, it becomes more 
critical." 
</P>
<P>
Although no deaths have been attributed to the current problems, officials such 
as Mayor Don McMillen are concerned about the effect the longer rides and 
response times have on the patients' chances of survival. 
</P>
<P>
"(Paramedics) can't drive around all night long with somebody dying in the 
back," he said. "I really don't understand how all these hospitals got so busy 
so quickly, but we've got to be able to take (patients) into the emergency 
rooms." 
</P>
<P>
Under county guidelines, paramedics, who provide advanced care during 
transport, can be sent to hospitals farther away when local emergency rooms are 
filled. By contrast, emergency medical technicians cannot be diverted except 
under extraordinary circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Routine Diversions 
</P>
<P>
Officials say diversions have become almost routine for both county and city 
paramedic units. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike county paramedic units in South El Monte, Temple City and Baldwin 
Park, El Monte does not have a backup unit. 
</P>
<P>
El Monte contracts with Medevac Emergency Medical Service to provide the 
paramedic service along with basic ambulance service. Medevac officials say the 
unit routinely takes its trauma patients to County-USC now that Arcadia's 
trauma center is closed. 
</P>
<P>
"Without traffic, we can be there in 20 minutes," said Karen Pointer, Medevac 
operations manager. "If there's any traffic, that kind of blows it out of the 
water." 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 31, paramedics could not respond to four of their 16 calls because they 
were tied up either treating patients or in transport outside the city, 
according to Fire Department logs. On a previous night, paramedics responded to 
22 of 27 calls, leaving five potentially critically injured patients in the 
care of emergency medical technicians. 
</P>
<P>
"In those cases, (the firefighter or ambulances drivers) do the best that they 
can until the paramedics arrive," Jensen said. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Price-Hastings, chief of the county's paramedic and trauma hospitals 
program, said most cities that cannot afford to have a unit on standby have 
made stopgap arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
"In most other areas, the city has some kind of backup, whether it be from the 
county or from the (ambulance) provider," she said. "But there are costs 
associated with that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unfeasible Option 
</P>
<P>
For El Monte, the cost of adding a second unit would be $400,000, a figure 
George says makes that option unfeasible. 
</P>
<P>
El Monte pays $1 a year to Medevac for the paramedic service. As part of the 
agreement, Medevac is the sole provider of ambulance service within the city, 
charging patients for hospital transportation. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, El Monte has occasionally received help from county paramedics 
when it has more calls than Medevac can handle, George said. El Monte's 
paramedics have reciprocated, but on a more infrequent basis, he said. 
</P>
<P>
George said he hopes new equipment will help ease part of the problem. The Fire 
Department wants to equip each of the city's five fire engines with an 
automated heart defibrillator unit. The unit, which costs about $5,000, would 
increase the firefighters' ability to respond to cardiac arrests, a frequent 
occurrence in a city with a high concentration of senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council authorized $16,000 toward the purchase of defibrillators and 
necessary training, and George has been appealing to the community to donate 
about $10,000. Properly used, George estimated, the portable defibrillators 
could increase a patient's chances of surviving a heart attack by 30% or more. 
</P>
<P>
But with more emergency rooms turning paramedics away and the lack of available 
funding to open more trauma centers, the defibrillators will solve only part of 
the problem, George said. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials cannot quantify how the lack of immediate paramedic response has 
affected patient recovery rates, but the assumption is that any delay is 
detrimental. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, George said, dispatchers deal with apprehensive calls from fire 
captains in the field asking for paramedics to treat critically injured 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
"You an hear it over the radio -- the tension in the captain's voice as he 
keeps asking when the paramedics are going to get there," George said.

MURRAY'S WAR CHEST $118,000 FULLER THAN ZELTNER'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In winning his Assembly seat in November, Willard H. Murray Jr. (D-Paramount) 
raised $118,000 more than former Assemblyman Paul Zeltner (R-Lakewood), 
according to final campaign reports for the 1988 election. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, incumbent lawmakers attract more contributions than challengers, but 
Murray, a former congressional aide and longtime political activist, parlayed 
his Democratic Party ties into an unusually formidable fund-raising operation. 
</P>
<P>
In statements filed last week with California's secretary of state, Murray's 
campaign reported raising $636,000 in cash and other services; Zeltner's raised 
$518,000. Murray received about 3,300 more votes than Zeltner. 
</P>
<P>
In southeast Los Angeles County's hard-fought state Senate election, incumbent 
Cecil N. Green (D-Norwalk) reported raising more than $1.5 million in 
contributions; his Republican challenger, Don Knabe of Cerritos, reported $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Spending totals for Green and Knabe also reached about $2.5 million, which 
ranks the race among the state's most expensive but short of the record for a 
legislative contest, according to the state Fair Political Practices 
Commission. The record of more than $2.9 million was set in the 1982 campaign 
between Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) and Republican Bill Hawkins, 
according to the commission. In a 1987 special election, Green and his 
Republican opponent, then-Assemblyman Wayne Grisham (R-Norwalk), fell just shy 
of the record. 
</P>
<P>
Campaign statements for the third major race in the Southeast area -- in which 
Democrat Robert D. Epple of Norwalk narrowly beat Grisham -- were not 
available. 
</P>
<P>
Allan Hoffenblum, Zeltner's campaign consultant, said he was not surprised that 
his candidate was outspent. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffenblum said Murray's longtime ties to the Berman &amp; D'Agostino campaign 
consulting firm and other Democrats helped him to attract contributions. The 
Los Angeles firm, which received $50,000 from Murray for consulting, is headed 
by Michael Berman and Carl D'Agostino. The firm is closely associated with the 
Democratic political organization of Berman's brother, Rep. Howard L. Berman of 
Panorama City, and Rep. Henry A. Waxman of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffenblum maintained that Zeltner could have raised and spent more money "but 
he just had a strong feeling that he didn't want to flood the mailboxes with 
mail, and he was quite concerned about sending out too much negative mail." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Flood of Mailers 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Zeltner managed an upset victory even though he spent just $170,000, 
to $820,000 for his Democratic opponent. 
</P>
<P>
In analyzing Murray's victory, Hoffenblum said Murray "just flooded the 
district at the end of the campaign" with mail. 
</P>
<P>
"The overwhelming majority of it was in the last 10 days" of the campaign, he 
said. The district includes Bellflower, Compton, Lakewood, Paramount and parts 
of Willowbrook and Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
In one piece of Democratic mail, a letter carrying Sen. Alan Cranston's 
signature accused Zeltner of voting for a credit card interest rate bill that 
Zeltner said he had not voted for. Shortly before the election, Cranston's 
chief of staff, Roy Greenaway, said that while Cranston endorsed Murray, the 
senator did not authorize the letter and, in fact, disapproved of it when 
contacted by Murray's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview last week, Murray said that as far as he knows, Cranston 
authorized the letter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Faced Stiff Challenge 
</P>
<P>
Murray also said he raised more money than Zeltner because he faced a stiff 
challenge in the Democratic primary, while Zeltner had no opposition in the GOP 
primary. "I had a primary opponent, and the amount in the final report reflects 
both campaigns," Murray said, adding that he spent $250,000 in the June 
primary. 
</P>
<P>
In Murray's view, his campaign in the general election "was relatively modest," 
compared with others. 
</P>
<P>
He said the escalating cost of campaigns does not disturb him: "It's a fact of 
life. It's the case all over the country." 
</P>
<P>
Murray acknowledged that his political ties enabled him to raise enough money 
to win the election: "Yes, the fact that I have been in politics for 25 years 
was helpful." 
</P>
<P>
Murray's campaign reported receiving in-kind donations worth more than $56,000 
from the state Democratic Central Committee for postage, mailings, printing and 
other services. 
</P>
<P>
He also reported receiving nearly $18,000 from Assembly Democrats, the 
political action committee of the Assembly's 46 Democratic members, for in-kind 
services. Among his other contributors were the Teamsters political action 
committee, $4,000; Rep. Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles), $4,000, and Rep. 
Richard H. Lehman (D-Sanger), $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
Zeltner was heavily supported by Republican elected officials, including 
Assemblyman William P. Baker (R-Danville), $35,000, and Assemblyman Dennis 
Brown (R-Los Alamitos), $25,000. In addition, he received $3,000 from Chevron 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hottest Contest 
</P>
<P>
The Green-Knabe race was the most hotly contested Senate contest in the state. 
As a result, Green received a major boost from Senate President Pro Tem David 
A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles). Roberti's largest single expenditure was $642,749 
in cash, services and loans to help reelect Green to the 33rd Senate District, 
which straddles the Los Angeles-Orange County line. The district includes 
Artesia, Bellflower, Cerritos, Downey, Hawaiian Gardens, Lakewood, Norwalk and 
Santa Fe Springs in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Green reported major contributions from the California Medical Assn., $38,500; 
United Auto Workers Region 6, $12,160, and California Trial Lawyers, $28,250. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Sheingold, a consultant to the Green campaign, said large amounts of 
money had to be spent in the district to reelect Green. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're in a race and your opponent is spending a million dollars or more, 
you've got to do everything to counter that," Sheingold said. 
</P>
<P>
Green won by fewer than 3,000 votes, prompting Sheingold to note: "Obviously 
from the margin of the victory, we didn't spend any more than we needed to." 
</P>
<P>
Knabe received almost $396,000 in services, primarily mailings, from the state 
Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
Knabe, a deputy to Los Angeles County Supervisor Deane Dana, also received 
$57,500 from Dana.

TEACHERS ASSAIL SCHOOLS CHIEF FOR REDECORATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The superintendent of the Mountain View School District, which is in a contract 
dispute with employees, has come under criticism over what disgruntled teachers 
say is a lavish bill for redecorating his office. 
</P>
<P>
A partial bill of $11,909 for furniture and carpet installation in Supt. Julian 
T. Lopez's office was approved by the school board this month. At the same 
time, the district is stuck in a labor impasse involving the amount of annual 
pay increases for teachers and program cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
A state-appointed fact finder has been called in to review the district's 
financial situation and will eventually make a non-binding recommendation to 
the school board on resolving the pay dispute. At the same time, a group of 120 
elementary school teachers have filed grievances against the district over the 
reassignment of three physical-education instructors, which teachers say has 
left them overworked and jeopardized student safety. 
</P>
<P>
The leader of the teachers' union criticized Lopez for lacking financial 
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not a Luxury 
</P>
<P>
"What we object to is not the fact that he is redecorating the office but that 
he is redecorating at the students' and teachers' expense," said Kathleen 
Hoolihan, president of the 314-member Mountain View Teachers Assn. and a 
teacher at Cogswell Elementary School. "There are three or four (purchase 
orders) which total about $13,000, and we don't think that's all of the cost of 
redecorating his office." 
</P>
<P>
Lopez, who became superintendent in July, bristled at the suggestion that 
redoing his office was a luxury. 
</P>
<P>
"It's ridiculous," Lopez said of the teachers' charges. "We are bargaining and 
negotiating. What does that really have to do with buying furniture?" 
</P>
<P>
Robert Beavers, the district's associate superintendent for business services, 
said the changes were made to accommodate Lopez, a nonsmoker, moving into an 
office occupied by the previous superintendent, who chain-smoked. 
</P>
<P>
Defending the changes for health reasons, Lopez said: "There's not enough money 
in the world to subject myself to that kind of exposure." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Priorities Shifted 
</P>
<P>
The superintendent acknowledged that the district's financial priorities have 
shifted since he took over but argued that the changes have benefited students 
with increased educational activities. The cuts the teachers are objecting to 
have diverted funds to new programs that directly benefit the 8,484 students in 
the district, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things I've done is pump money into the schools and encouraged them 
to take field trips," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides field trips, Lopez said, the district is moving to replace temporary 
trailers with permanent portable buildings on the district's crowded campuses. 
</P>
<P>
As part of a pay adjustment for the last year of a three-year contract, the 
district had offered a 2% increase for the school year that started in 
September, contingent upon the teachers surrendering 30 minutes of class 
preparation time during the week. The teachers -- who have asked for an 8.5% 
increase -- refused, and the district implemented a 1.5% increase and 
restructured preparation time for elementary teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Under the contract, elementary teachers are allowed two hours a week to prepare 
for their classes. Thirty minutes of that free time was guaranteed when the 
district provided three physical-education teachers in 1987-88 to take over 
each elementary teacher's physical-education class for one period a week. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Double-Size Classes 
</P>
<P>
But those physical-education instructors were reassigned this year, and the 
classroom teachers have had to double up their physical-education classes with 
a colleague's once a week to keep the 30 minutes as preparation time, Hoolihan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
District officials said that classroom aides were added this year to help 
teachers supervise the double-size physical-education classes. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez said that the district made the change in an attempt to find more 
efficient ways to operate and that he does not believe in having 
physical-education specialists supervise an elementary teacher's 
physical-education class. 
</P>
<P>
In September, the teachers began doubling up on classes once a week. Since 
then, one student suffered a broken arm, and a teacher broke a leg. In each 
case, Hoolihan said, a single instructor was supervising a class of up to 70 
children. 
</P>
<P>
"One teacher out there with all those children isn't safe," Hoolihan said. 
"This may happen in any (staffing) situation, but the teachers feel it was the 
lack of adequate planning. We feel this program was arbitrarily cut to save 
money." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Playground Safety 
</P>
<P>
Because of the injuries, Hoolihan said, teachers at Cogswell have given up the 
preparation time to teach their own physical-education classes, five days a 
week. Hoolihan said the teachers' grievances against the district over the loss 
of the physical-education specialists will go before an arbitrator in March. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez denied that the changes have had any effect on playground safety. 
</P>
<P>
The physical-education specialists often taught more than one class at a time 
last year, Lopez said. "The only difference is it was someone else doing it 
other than the classroom teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez took umbrage with the teachers' allegations, which he said were unfounded 
and unbecoming.

QUESTION FOR COUNCIL: IS BIGGER BETTER IN BEVERLY HILLS? 
</P>

<P>
When Penny Bloch and Robert J. White bought their home on South Palm Drive, 
they had no idea that their block of Spanish-style bungalows would become the 
scene of house-by-house fighting for the future look of Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The battle is not limited to South Palm Drive. Starting with the construction 
of two bulky mansions on a hillside over Coldwater Canyon three years ago, a 
trend of building big houses has spread to many blocks across the city, often 
to neighbors' dismay. 
</P>
<P>
"Across the street, down the street and farther down the block, people are 
tearing down these nice little Spanish houses and building these huge square 
blocks," Bloch said. "They're so big that people think they're apartment 
houses." 
</P>
<P>
While residents like Bloch feel that such houses will ruin the character of 
their neighborhoods, others say city zoning rules should let people make the 
most of their properties. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anyone can keep things the way they are," said Shelley Kravit, a 
homeowner in the southeast sector of the city. "We're getting more families 
with children, and families require more rooms. We should not be deprived of 
homes that are sufficient for our needs just because we live in the southeast 
of Beverly Hills." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Public Hearing 
</P>
<P>
The issue, which has been argued before the Beverly Hills Planning Commission 
for more than a year, goes before the City Council next week, when a public 
hearing will be held on sweeping new changes in the city's zoning ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
"The public has been telling us that these houses are too big and we need to 
limit them," said MeraLee Goldman, chairwoman of the Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new rules, she said, "you will be able to build yourself quite a 
house, one that's suited to the neighborhood, without coming in to apply for 
anything special. If you want to do something unique, you can do it (by 
appearing before a special board). We think, we hope, that we've met the needs 
of all the community and that's why we're so enthusiastic." 
</P>
<P>
In a report to the council, the Planning Commission said that people want to 
build bigger houses not only to make room for computers, exercise equipment and 
other accouterments of the modern life style, but also because land prices have 
been soaring. Planners said that many purchasers of lots that cost more than $1 
million feel that they are not getting their money's worth if they can't build 
a luxurious home on the site. 
</P>
<P>
"This trend, however, is often in conflict with the existing neighborhood 
fabric in terms of heights, setbacks (the required distance that houses must be 
set back from streets, alleys and neighboring homes), landscaping, driveway 
patterns and bulk, as well as the availability of light, air and privacy," the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
"While some controls appear to be necessary, it is also desirable to encourage 
personal expression and variety." 
</P>
<P>
To that end, city planners are proposing a sliding scale that will limit the 
floor space of single-family homes. Houses on smaller lots will be limited to 
1,500 square feet plus no more than 35% of the lot size, while those on bigger 
properties will be limited to 1,500 square feet plus no more than 40% of the 
lot size. 
</P>
<P>
Smaller lots are defined as those that are less than 50 feet wide or do not 
have a driveway on one side. 
</P>
<P>
An interim ordinance now in effect limits construction to no more than 55% of 
lot size. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a sliding scale that allows a larger percentage of house on a smaller 
lot, but scales it down a bit on larger lots," said Alan E. Berlin, chairman of 
the board of governors of the Beverly Hills Municipal League. 
</P>
<P>
He said the residents organization has endorsed the proposal because "we don't 
want (the city) to look like a row of brownstone houses in New York, for 
example. We want to maintain the greenery, the beauty, the setbacks and the 
privacy which are inherent in Beverly Hills houses." 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth A. Goldman, a representative of the newly founded Southwest Beverly 
Hills Homeowners Assn., agreed, saying that those who oppose the ordinance 
would like to see 6,000-square-foot homes built on the small lots in the south 
of the city "and that's simply absurd." 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, there's a demand for bigger houses. Hey, I'd like a yacht," Goldman 
said. "But for someone on a small lot to say you've discriminated against me 
because a guy up north (in areas of the city where lots are larger) can have a 
6,000-square-foot house and I can't, that's a non sequitur. If you want to have 
a home, it has to be in sync with the size of your lot." 
</P>
<P>
But Kravit said that those who live on the smaller lots of south Beverly Hills 
are already deprived of privacy, and that more space indoors is essential. 
</P>
<P>
While the proposed guidelines would limit floor space in her area to 3,900 
square feet for a typical house, she said that 4,500 square feet would be more 
desirable. She said at least 75 residents organized in a group called the 90211 
Organization, named after their ZIP code, support her position. 
</P>
<P>
While two-story houses have replaced one-story bungalows on her street, the 
block now looks better because the original houses were 60 years old and many 
of them were in need of repair, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Another group, called the Committee to Save the South Part of Beverly Hills, 
also plans to argue for the right to build bigger houses. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed limit for smaller lots "adversely impacts choices regarding size 
of family, the nature of life style and the security of financial investment," 
its recommendation to the City Council said. 
</P>
<P>
They asked for a maximum of 4,000 to 6,600 square feet depending on lot size.

CUSTOMER SUES L. B. BANK IN $100 DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jeffrey Johnson of Lakewood is mad at his bank. He has filed a small claims 
suit against it. He says he has persuaded several of his friends to close their 
accounts there. And at a recent business seminar, he urged others to avoid 
doing business with that bank. 
</P>
<P>
All because he says the bank cheated him out of $100. 
</P>
<P>
"What they did isn't right," said Johnson, 35. "I think that business 
institutions need to act in good faith with the people doing business with 
them. They need to learn that if they act against that good faith that they 
won't stay in business long." 
</P>
<P>
The object of his wrath is Farmers &amp; Merchants Bank of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Counted the Money Twice 
</P>
<P>
The dispute began early last month when Johnson, a computing consultant from 
Lakewood, went to the bank's Seal Beach branch to cash a $100 check. To hear 
Johnson tell it, all went well. He said he took his money, counted it twice to 
make sure he had received the correct amount, and then went home. 
</P>
<P>
But that night, Johnson says, he got a call from the teller asking if he had 
noticed an extra $100 in his wallet. A few days later, he says, he received a 
letter from the bank informing him that he had been given an extra $100, an 
assertion Johnson vehemently denies. To make things right, the letter went on 
to say, the bank had withdrawn the additional $100 from his account. 
</P>
<P>
"We apologize for our error and appreciate your cooperation with the action 
necessary," said the letter, signed by Jeffrey C. Hagan, assistant vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
Hagan said the letter was based on a close reading of the teller's audit tape, 
a computer printout that automatically records every transaction at a teller's 
window. Included in the material he sent Johnson was a copy of the tape showing 
a dispersal on the date in question of $200 -- ten $20 bills -- to Johnson. 
Also included was Johnson's canceled check for $100. "I am sorry he feels that 
we're in the wrong," Hagan said in an interview, "but I am required to go by 
what our paper documentation shows us." 
</P>
<P>
Denise Hatfield, the teller involved, said she definitely remembers handing 
Johnson $200, but declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Six Similar Cases 
</P>
<P>
Senior Vice President and Cashier John Henrichs characterized the teller's tape 
as a "very complex and highly reliable" method of recording bank transactions. 
"The teller can't take a dollar out of the drawer without putting it on the 
tape," Henrichs said, adding that the bank has experienced about six such 
disputes over the last 15 years, all of which were decided in its favor. 
</P>
<P>
He said a state law allows banks to seize the assets of customers to offset 
verified financial obligations. 
</P>
<P>
After punching a series of numbers on a computer keyboard and thereby recording 
the transaction, bank officials say, tellers remove the money from a drawer and 
generally count it twice before giving it to a customer. 
</P>
<P>
In Johnson's case, said Senior Vice President Charles Hagan, who is Jeffrey 
Hagan's father, there were "some unique characteristics . . . that caused the 
error." He said he could not reveal them because of the pending litigation. He 
also said the teller who handled the transaction has been with the bank for 
several years and is highly regarded. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel that the customer in this case is making this claim in innocence," he 
said. "He really doesn't believe that he got the money." 
</P>
<P>
After receiving the bank's letter, Johnson immediately fired off a letter 
demanding repayment of the $100. "What I don't understand," he wrote, "is why 
you insist on victimizing me when you can't possibly demonstrate that I 
received this money. It can't be demonstrated because it never happened." 
</P>
<P>
When he did not receive a response, Johnson filed a suit in the Small Claims 
Division of Long Beach Municipal Court asking that the money be returned. A 
hearing is scheduled Feb. 27. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Customer Is 'Outraged' 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Johnson is closing his account at the bank. "I am outraged," 
he said in an interview last week. "I think it's terrible what they've done. 
The bank shouldn't bill customers for its own clerical errors; having such a 
policy is destructive and not good business." 
</P>
<P>
Charles Hagan, calling Johnson's response vindictive, said the bank has not 
experienced a flurry of account closures as a result of the incident. "There's 
nothing we can do about that kind of behavior," he said of Johnson's 
determination to be a walking bad advertisement for the bank. "It's part of the 
emotions that get involved in these transactions." 
</P>
<P>
But he also said that the bank intends to vigorously defend its position to the 
legal limit, including an appeal if necessary. "We will defend on principle," 
he said. "Our processes are reliable and trustworthy. There has to be some 
authority in these transactions." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson recently returned to Farmers &amp; Merchants to cash some new checks 
before closing his account. However, he said that this time he brought a friend 
along to act as a witness, and asked for a copy of the teller's audit tape 
verifying the amount of the transaction.

WHERE IS THE JUSTICE IN RENT CONTROL LAW? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Poland almost 50 years ago, they put me in a concentration camp, took away 
my property and created a government where justice was denied to me because I 
was a minority and easily exploited. 
</P>
<P>
My neighbors all said: "This is wrong, but what can we do? It's the law." 
</P>
<P>
So, I came to America to live where the Constitution says that government is 
not able to take away the rights and property of a minority in order to satisfy 
political lusts. I started with nothing, worked hard, saved and 20 years ago 
bought property on Wilshire Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
But in Santa Monica, I am again a minority -- a landlord, and the power-hungry 
government has bought the majority tenant vote by forcing me and others to keep 
our rents ridiculously low. This city says it's legal for a majority to vote 
themselves a monetary benefit at the sole expense of the minority. Think about 
that, how could that be constitutional? 
</P>
<P>
Here in Santa Monica for 10 years, the local government has used legions of 
lawyers and endless complex and costly maneuvers to effectively take my 
property away. This city has prevented me and other landlords from using our 
own land or from getting out of the rental business unless we pay huge fees 
that are almost as much as the value of the land itself. In other words, in 
Santa Monica as a landlord, I am a slave -- forced to work against my will 
unless I buy my freedom at the expense of losing much of what I worked for. 
Some choice. 
</P>
<P>
This city won't let me and others just get out of the business of subsidizing 
rents for tenants who "enjoy" radical rent control, even though many of those 
tenants are rich. This city's rent board continues to expand its budgets, its 
number of lawyers and its disregard for constitutional rights. This city's 
political leaders find it profitable to exploit and take away the rights and 
property of a minority to gain political power. My neighbors all say: "This is 
wrong, but what can we do? It's the law." 
</P>
<P>
In 50 years, nothing has changed. 
</P>
<P>
The rent control people fear that if we landlords should win our fight for 
justice . . . then their base of power would crumble. I am not trying to end 
rent control, I just want my constitutional rights restored and (to) end this 
legal blackmail scheme. 
</P>
<P>
Those outside this city who have the power to bring justice here find it 
politically unpopular to help landlords. It is also very profitable for many 
people to keep landlords struggling forever against this legal stalling 
process. 
</P>
<P>
Where is the true light of freedom I sought so long ago? Where is the true 
meaning of this country's Constitution I once admired? Where is the "justice 
for all" I sought in America? It's been hidden by legal gobbledygook and 
political lusts. 
</P>
<P>
In 50 years, nothing has changed, and now, as it was then, it is beneficial for 
the majority to just look the other way and pretend this injustice doesn't 
exist.

'LAID-BACK' RAILROADER 'GOES IN SPURTS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYBIL BAKER, Times Staff Writer

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An adventuresome mouse would have the trip of a lifetime if it hopped aboard 
one of Monte Chambers' trains. The tracks run alongside Chambers's back-yard 
swimming pool in Glendora through an Austrian village, over a bridge, under a 
cable car, in and out of a tunnel and past a waterfall. 
</P>
<P>
Everything to do with the railroad and its adjacent buildings, all from 
Germany, is done to scale. 
</P>
<P>
Every little window, light and rivet on the engine (where the wheel assembly is 
articulated to handle tight corners) is exactly the right size. The Sagewerk 
sign on the sawmill is in proportion to the building; at the Lowenbrau Zue 
Post, a little terrace features a tiny barbecue. The tiny porter outside the 
hotel pushes a baggage cart bearing tiny suitcases and an even tinier hatbox. 
</P>
<P>
Poinsettias and mammoth yellow pansies loom over the tracks, out of scale with 
the miniature railroad. Although some nurseries specialize in miniature plants 
for model train buffs, Chambers does not take his hobby to that extreme. 
</P>
<P>
If there are two broad categories of model train buffs -- the obsessed and the 
mellow -- Chambers is the latter. Describing the first category, Chambers' 
wife, Marilou, observes with a chuckle, "Some people even have the trains bring 
in their drinks at night." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Goes in Spurts 
</P>
<P>
But Chambers' hobby is less all-encompassing. "I go in spurts," he said. 
"Sometimes I don't run it for weeks at a time. I like to build 'em; I don't 
particularly like to play with 'em." 
</P>
<P>
Being laid-back about it all seems to run in the family. The Chamberses have 
four grandchildren by their two daughters. Are the youngsters fascinated with 
the trains? Not really, his expression indicates. "But they see it all the 
time. They like to show their friends, though," Chambers said. 
</P>
<P>
He is tall, lanky and laconic at 57, and a retired superintendent of heavy 
transmission lines for Southern California Edison Co. "You know, building those 
big steel towers across the desert," he said, describing his former job. He 
came a long way by staying put, and was able to retire early because he started 
early, he explained. 
</P>
<P>
He is a second-generation Californian; his father was born in Redlands in 1895. 
"And my mother lived here on this property. It was a big orange ranch," he 
said. He met his wife at Covina High School, and joined Edison after serving in 
the Korean War. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Started as Youngster 
</P>
<P>
"Like most kids, I had a small electric train," he said. As an adult, he 
progressed to the HO model around the Christmas tree and eventually to the 
L.G.B. model in the back yard that he started assembling four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Models by L.G.B., which stands for Lehmann Gross-Bahn, (Lehmann Big Train in 
English) are sometimes called garden railways. L.G.B. is the last word in this 
hobbyist's train of thought. And he is not alone. The Los Angeles Garden 
Railway Society, where Chambers says "you can pick up some good ideas," has 
about 70 members, who write to the Ernst Paul Lehmann Patentwerk in Nuremberg 
for their equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrating the railroad's layout and explaining its features make its 
creator's face light up. 
</P>
<P>
Chambers has seven engines and 30 cars in his pool-side railway. Four trains 
can run on the tracks simultaneously. The system is fully automated so that 
collisions are impossible. When one engine passes over a magnetized tie, it 
trips a switch that causes the arm of a signal to drop and the next train to 
stop. 
</P>
<P>
"If you give it 20 volts, it'll really move," Chambers said, "probably in 
excess of 100 m.p.h., in scale speed. The normal operating speed is 14 volts." 
</P>
<P>
The trains will run in rain or snow. At night, the headlights on the engines 
light up the tracks. The windows of the hotel, the stations, the church and the 
farmhouses glow. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
He Uses Kits 
</P>
<P>
Chambers assembles the buildings from kits made by Pola, another German 
company. 
</P>
<P>
"Normally, most people will lay out all their track first, then start adding 
buildings," Chambers said. He started with the hotel. "Then you start putting a 
farmhouse here, a church there, a this and a that." He ended up with 14 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
L.G.B. engines can cost "from $160 to $600 apiece, and the cars from $30 to 
$200," he said. The building kits are usually a couple of hundred dollars each, 
also. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm better off than a lot of people just getting into it," he said, because 
"the dollar against the mark is so bad now." 
</P>
<P>
He learned some hydraulic engineering by installing the waterfall. And next 
year he wants to put a cog railway running up a slope. 
</P>
<P>
The rails -- solid brass, a good conductor of electricity -- feel warm in the 
sunlight. And in fact, the train "runs over a lizard now and then" that comes 
to bask, Chambers said. 
</P>
<P>
A more common hazard is corrosion. "You can develop bad joints, shorts," he 
said. But he added happily, "I enjoy fiddling with it." 
</P>

'SHORTCUT SHARKS' TAKE BITE OUT OF TRAFFIC JAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD LEE COLVIN, Colvin is a Redondo Beach free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you're content to be a member of The Pack -- that huge mass of drivers 
willing to be led by their license plates down the jammed highways of life -- 
then driving for the next four months on the Ventura Freeway will call for 
patience. 
</P>
<P>
As of Feb. 21, the state Department of Transportation will jam the freeway's 
legendary 267,000 cars a day onto the south side of the center divider during 
the widening and reconstruction of 3,200 feet of pavement between Warner Center 
and Calabasas; when the westbound lanes are completed, all six lanes of traffic 
will be diverted to the north side. 
</P>
<P>
To add to the confusion, the construction project will shut down five off- and 
on-ramps for the duration. And if an accident occurs, there's no way to clear 
it to the side of the road because all available space will be taken up with 
live-action, use-it-or-lose-it traffic lanes. 
</P>
<P>
So be prepared to listen to your books on tape, do your taxes with one eye on 
the road or whatever else it is that keeps your mind off the time you are 
wasting. If, however, you drive to a different downshift and your transmission 
transcends such slug-like non-activities as patiently enduring traffic, there 
are alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Roberts and Richard Schwadel, Southern California natives and 
self-described "shortcut sharks," highway hackers of the first order whose 
motto is To move is to live, to stop is to suffocate and die, are ready to 
point you the way. 
</P>
<P>
Authors of a book called "L.A. Shortcuts" that they will publish this summer, 
Roberts and Schwadel say breaking free from highway hell is as easy as heading 
for an off-ramp. There are more than 21,000 miles of surface streets in Los 
Angeles and, especially in the San Fernando Valley, many of them are more wide 
open than the highways. 
</P>
<P>
"The shortest distance between two points is never a straight line," said 
Schwadel, 32, who uses his penchant for pavement pathfinding to get to 
free-lance film editing jobs from his home in Marina del Rey. "That's what 
separates shortcut sharks from the rest of the pack." 
</P>
<P>
Roberts, 30, a film editor and director who lives in Hollywood, said some of 
the 90 shortcuts compiled by the partners, including 13 for the valley, don't 
save a lot of time. But they will keep you moving while others are riding the 
brake. "The point is to get away from where everybody else is," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts and Schwadel anticipate that disclosing their street secrets will anger 
some of their friends. "People who are shortcutters will think of us as 
traitors," Schwadel said. 
</P>
<P>
But, they say, everybody has some tricks for getting around and all they are 
doing is compiling them. "It's like modern folklore," Roberts said. "Everybody 
knows it, but nobody's ever written it down." 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans officials have acknowledged the potential for tie-ups in this phase of 
the three-year project to widen and improve the Ventura Freeway between 
Calabasas and Universal City. 
</P>
<P>
They have come up with what they think is the most ambitious traffic diversion 
and public education effort in highway construction history. It involves 
observation cameras to monitor traffic, an automated traffic signal system that 
can be altered to deal with the traffic flow on Ventura Boulevard, construction 
of a new frontage road, new signals, more traffic cops, a fleet of tow trucks 
to clear disabled vehicles and financial incentives for drivers to take up 
ride-sharing and van-pooling. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Kilmurray, the Caltrans engineer who designed the plan for managing the 
traffic snarl, said no acceptable alternate routes skirt the area that will be 
torn up starting this month. So a new local access route was needed. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the eastbound traffic is headed for the Warner Center area, Kilmurray 
said, and if a few hundred motorists each hour use the alternate exit at 
Parkway Calabas as and the new frontage road on the north side of the freeway, 
traffic should keep moving. 
</P>
<P>
Westbound traffic headed for the Calabasas area will be encouraged to exit at 
Shoup or Woodlake avenues, cross the freeway at Valley Circle Boulevard and 
recross to the north on Parkway Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
"The real test is going to be this next segment of work," said Kilmurray, who 
is now chief of design for the Century Freeway and Harbor transitway projects. 
A similar traffic diversion plan will be used there. 
</P>
<P>
But Roberts and Schwadel take the idea that there are no alternative routes as 
a challenge to find some, and they offer two basic east and west routes that 
actually could be traveled in either direction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clear Sailing on Burbank 
</P>
<P>
Their plan for westbound drivers is to duck off the Ventura Freeway at the 
first sign of brake lights, head north to Burbank Boulevard in the east valley, 
or Oxnard or Topham streets if drivers are west of Reseda Boulevard. Burbank 
often offers clear sailing while The Pack is barely moving. 
</P>
<P>
At Topanga Canyon Boulevard, head south to Avenue San Luis and turn west. 
Although Avenue San Luis will be part of the local access route between Valley 
Circle and Parkway Calabasas, you, shortcutter, go left at Rigoletto Street, 
right at Calabash Street, left on Deseret Drive, a quick right at Mulholland 
Drive, left at Valmar Road, right at Park Ora, right at Park Sienna, right at 
Park Capri, left at Park Granada and then down Parkway Calabasas into the belly 
of what is likely to be a beastly traffic tie-up. 
</P>
<P>
The eastbound escape hatch is easier to follow: Use a temporary off-ramp to 
exit early onto Calabasas Road, go right at Parkway Calabasas, thread your way 
through the Parks but then stay on wide-open Mulholland all the way to Topanga. 
Go north on Topanga and the whole valley opens up to you. (Travel time east or 
west between Parkway Calabasas and Topanga Canyon is slightly more than eight 
minutes.) 
</P>
<P>
Rather than re-entering the freeway at Topanga, go east on Victory Boulevard, 
turn right on Topham Street just before you get to the railroad tracks and stay 
on it as it turns into Oxnard Street, all the way to Louise Avenue, where you 
turn right. That's a shortcut they call "Kick in the Oxnard" for its quick 
access to the west valley. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Follow to Freeway 
</P>
<P>
Louise takes you to Burbank Boulevard, one of Rogers and Schwadel's highly 
recommended east-west roadways, and you can follow it all the way to the San 
Diego Freeway or beyond. 
</P>
<P>
One of their rules of the road is that "residents take precedence." Speeding 
and squealing will cause complaints, and complaints will bring police 
surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
There is nothing magic about these routes, Schwadel said. The partners 
consulted Caltrans and Los Angeles traffic-flow maps, learned about the timing 
of traffic lights and surveyed friends, cab drivers, television news crews and 
bar-stool compatriots for advice. Then they drove the shortcuts, checking for 
hazards, such as school crossings, and timing them. 
</P>
<P>
But whether drivers will use the routes has little to do with knowing that they 
exist, the authors said. "It all has to do with your attitude and state of 
mind," Schwadel said, and shortcut sharks rebel rather than stew in someone 
else's exhaust. 
</P>
<P>
"It's anarchy out there," they write. "The cardinal rule is there are no rules. 
But there are shortcuts."

CREOLES' LIFE IN SOUTHLAND

<P>
Officially Mardi Gras is Tuesday, but for the folks at Aubry's barber shop, it 
comes twice a week. 
</P>
<P>
Barber Leon Aubry, his family and about 30 loyal customers have partied there 
regularly for the last 54 years, "just for the hell of it," they say. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the group, mostly men over 50, meticulously cook spicy foods like 
alligator gumbo, hog-head cheese and red beans and rice on a stove in a back 
room of the barber shop. 
</P>
<P>
Others dance like teen-agers out front, waving polka-dot umbrellas or white 
handkerchiefs, singing songs like "When the Saints Go Marching In," played on a 
wood and aluminum washboard. 
</P>
<P>
They are from Louisiana and many of them are related -- somehow -- or their 
families have been friends for generations. 
</P>
<P>
The Aubry clan consider themselves Creoles. Actually, they are descendants of 
Creoles -- Frenchmen and Spaniards who settled in Louisiana, Mississippi, 
Alabama and Florida, where they often bore children with black slaves, 
beginning in the late 1700s. (The term, which comes from the Spanish word 
criollo, meaning "native to the place," technically refers to the European 
settlers, but their mixed-race descendants have claimed it for their own.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Second to New Orleans 
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that Los Angeles has the second-largest community of Creole 
descendants in the country, after New Orleans. More than 15,000 migrated here 
after World War II, in search of better jobs and educations that were not 
available in the South, where the economy was stagnant and segregation was 
widespread. 
</P>
<P>
But Creoles never severed the ties to their Southern homeland and culture -- 
even though more of them are marrying people who are not Creoles and moving 
farther away from their parents. They have remained devoutly Roman Catholic and 
send their children to Catholic schools. They still enjoy zydeco music and 
dance a French polka at their La Las, a Creole term for parties. 
</P>
<P>
"You can take the Creole out of Louisiana, but you can't take Louisiana out of 
the Creole," said Aubry, 72. 
</P>
<P>
French and Spanish settlers ruled the south until the Louisiana Purchase of 
1803, said Prof. Mark T. Carlton, who specializes in Louisiana history at 
Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. He said the settlers began having 
children with slave women because there were few French and Spanish women in 
the territory. 
</P>
<P>
"Later, after America bought the territory from the French, the French and 
American aristocracy kept black mistresses in the city and white wives out on 
their plantations," Carlton said. 
</P>
<P>
Creoles, whose fair skin and light brown eyes distinguished them, were not 
completely accepted by whites and segregated themselves from blacks, often 
traveling dozens of miles to socialize. They spoke a French dialect and married 
their cousins to perpetuate their culture. 
</P>
<P>
Marion Olivier Ferreira, 63, remembers those times. 
</P>
<P>
As a child in Louisiana, she said, there was an unwritten rule that forbade her 
from attending the same social functions, churches or schools as blacks. Some 
of her relatives denied that they had any black ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a social scourge," said Ferreira, who moved to Los Angeles in 1966 and 
works as an elementary school teacher. "To be black was to be nothing. You were 
half a man, and nobody wants to be half a man." 
</P>
<P>
But no matter how strongly Creoles denied being black, they weren't white 
either. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't matter how light your skin was, or how blue your eyes were, the 
whites in the South knew where Creoles came from, and they victimized you like 
any other black man," said Bishop Carl Fisher, of the Los Angeles Diocese, who 
was raised in Pascagoula, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
However, Marie Leday said that outside the South, Creoles could "pass for 
white" and get jobs, decent housing and an education. They moved to Houston, 
Chicago and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"When we came out here, people couldn't tell if we were white or black," said 
Leday, 64, who has lived in Los Angeles for 45 years. "I was looking for a job 
and I passed a restaurant with a 'help wanted' sign in the window. The sign 
said, 'whites only apply,' but I walked right in anyway, and got the job." 
</P>
<P>
The majority of Creoles who migrated to Los Angeles settled along Jefferson 
Boulevard between Arlington and 10th Avenue -- an area they called Little New 
Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
Its center was Holy Name Church, and several Creoles, like Aubry, opened 
businesses in the area. Besides the barber shop, there was the New Orleans 
Grotto, Merlin's Restaurant, the St. Bernard Market, Marine Cleaners and the 
Big Loaf Bakery -- the only place in town to get New Orleans-style French 
bread. 
</P>
<P>
Once in Los Angeles, some Creoles became fierce advocates for civil rights in 
the 1950s and 1960s -- most notably Dr. H. Claude Hudson, who started the Los 
Angeles chapter of the NAACP. 
</P>
<P>
Marrying people of different cultures also became more acceptable among 
Creoles. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Hawkins 28, said, "My generation is a lot more open-minded, especially in 
California, where you see a lot of interracial relationships." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Creole-Creole marriages are rare and most Creoles have moved out of 
Little New Orleans. But few Creoles seem concerned that the culture will die. 
</P>
<P>
"We will never let go of our culture," said Meritta Angelain Hawkins, Linda's 
mother. "We try to bring people of other cultures in, but we never let go of 
our own heritage." 
</P>
<P>
Creoles insist that their children learn trades or go to college and become 
professionals. Aubry said they take pride in being cultured "city people," 
unlike the Cajuns, who tended to live in the backwoods of Louisiana. The 
Cajuns' ancestors also came from France, by way of Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Spicy foods are an important part of the Creole culture. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spicy Fare 
</P>
<P>
Al Honore, a manager at Harold and Belle's Creole restaurant on Jefferson 
Boulevard, said the food is a mixture of French, Spanish and black cuisines -- 
with the main ingredients being chicken, spicy hot sausage and seafood. 
</P>
<P>
Dance and music are also important parts of the Creole culture, said Meritta 
Hawkins, founder of the Jolly Jokers social club, a local Creole women's 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
At La Las, zydeco bands, which generally consist of an accordion player, a 
violinist and someone playing the washboard and spoons, play their polka-type 
music. 
</P>
<P>
To advertise Creole parties and restaurants, Louis Metoyer's family began 
publishing Bayou Talk, a monthly newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
The first year's editions of "Bayou Talk" look and read like a family album, 
with photos of clan gatherings and stories about social clubs and profiles of 
prominent Creoles. 
</P>
<P>
Creole businesses advertise in the paper, which also serves a bulletin board 
for upcoming social events -- like the La Las held almost weekly in different 
Catholic churches. 
</P>
<P>
But the most elaborate celebrations occur during Mardi Gras -- "the last blast 
before the fast," said Bishop Fisher. 
</P>
<P>
Mardi Gras, which means "Fat Tuesday" in French, is the final celebration for 
Catholics before Ash Wednesday and the beginning of Lent. Some Los Angeles 
Creoles return to New Orleans for the rowdy gala, but others stay in town for 
the numerous parties here. 
</P>
<P>
Aubry said, "I get a little homesick for New Orleans this time of year, but 
this is home to me now."

SKIRMISH OVER GROWTH; 
</P>
<P>
LAKE MIRAMAR PROVIDES NEXT BATTLEGROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A nasty intra-community conflict over the future of the undeveloped hills on 
the northern shore of Lake Miramar, now primarily a picturesque backdrop for 
boaters, fishermen, hikers and joggers, is emerging as the next test of the 
city's beleaguered slow-growth movement. 
</P>
<P>
A handful of slow-growth leaders, working in concert with a local 200-member 
volunteer commitee, have seized on the debate over the lake's future as a rare 
opportunity to attack a large developer and incumbent San Diego City Councilman 
Ed Struiksma simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
By allying themselves with a referendum campaign to block construction of homes 
and an industrial park scheduled to be built on the hillsides, slow-grow 
leaders say they can force another citywide test of voters' slow-growth 
sentiments at the same time that Struiksma, the council's most pro-development 
member, must run for re-election in the city's first district-only election. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Back at the Table' 
</P>
<P>
Eager for a more narrowly focused scrape with the development industry after 
being clobbered in city- and countywide referenda on growth management last 
fall, some slow-growthers have donated money and time to the Save Miramar Lake 
Committee petition-gathering campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that many of the environmental community leaders see that 
qualification of this referendum puts us back at the table regarding growth 
management policy and shows that we still have the strength and grass-roots 
network to participate in the political process," said Bob Glaser, co-chairman 
of San Diegans for Managed Growth and political consultant for the Save Miramar 
Lake Committee. 
</P>
<P>
One candidate who has her eye on Struiksma's seat, Linda Bernhardt, once an 
aide to Councilwoman Abbe Wolfsheimer, has participated in campaign strategy 
sessions as an "adviser," and is likely to look to opponents of the planned 
Miramar Ranch North housing development for support if she runs. 
</P>
<P>
Another possible candidate, attorney Mike Eckmann, said he has attended three 
Save Miramar Lake Committee meetings and three other meetings on the issue, but 
has taken no position in the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
Former City Councilman Floyd Morrow, an undeclared candidate for Struiksma's 
seat, said, "I don't think I need (the issue), but I will be using it, just as 
I will be using other land-use issues where (Struiksma) has sided with 
developers against the citizens." 
</P>
<P>
Bernhardt declined to comment on her activities. 
</P>
<P>
Struiksma and his advisers are not yet losing sleep over the citizens group, 
which claims it has gathered 31,500 signatures, enough to force a citywide 
referendum on the 3,360 homes that the council authorized BCE Development to 
build north of Lake Miramar. 
</P>
<P>
City Clerk Charles Abdelnour will not determine whether the referendum 
qualifies until next month at the earliest. Even if it does, the council has 11 
months to schedule a special citywide election. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Uncharted Waters 
</P>
<P>
Although Abdelnour has recommended the Sept. 19 council primary as the most 
logical and economical date for a 1989 citywide election, the four Republican 
council members diving into the uncharted waters of district elections will 
have ample incentive to oppose placing the referendum on the ballot beside 
their names. A citywide referendum would increase voter turnout, which 
historically means a larger Democratic turnout. 
</P>
<P>
Struiksma, who overwhelmingly won reelection in 1985 and runs particularly well 
in Scripps Ranch, can also point to a rival petition-gathering campaign, 
financed primarily by BCE Development, that has collected 20,000 to 25,000 
signatures in support of the development project. 
</P>
<P>
"If that's the best thing that (Miramar Ranch North opponents) can reach out 
for, I'm not at all worried," Struiksma said, "because I am, frankly, very 
pleased with the fact that I have represented the wishes of my planning groups, 
whether in that community or any other community." 
</P>
<P>
"We are watching it," added Jim Johnston, Struiksma's political consultant, who 
said he does not believe the initiative will qualify for the ballot. "Right 
now, we're just looking at the smoke. We're going to wait and see if there's 
any fire." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Struiksma does not deny that the campaign is a magnet for slow-growthers 
and his political opponents. He charges, in fact, that they have orchestrated 
the movement from the outset. 
</P>
<P>
However, J. Gary Underwood, co-chairman of the Save Miramar Lake Committee, 
said that his organization's effort is dominated by volunteers from the lake 
area, who have done the bulk of the fund-raising and leg work. 
</P>
<P>
Some leaders of 1988's unsuccessful slow-growth campaign, working with Save 
Miramar Lake Committee include Richard Carson, Citizens for Limited Growth's 
economic adviser. Carson contributed $750, the second-largest donation, as well 
as organizing expertise, Underwood said. 
</P>
<P>
Bernhardt, who recently moved to Scripps Ranch, was campaign manager for 
Citizens for Limited Growth's unsuccessful effort on behalf of slow-growth 
Propositions D and J last November. Lonna Smith, co-chairwoman of the Save 
Miramar Lake Committee, was a volunteer in that campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Glaser, who is exploring a run for City Council against incumbent Gloria 
McColl, represents San Diegans for Managed Growth. The Sierra Club endorsed the 
effort, and Alan Sakarias, chairman of its conservation committee, has been an 
active campaigners. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Surprised by Support 
</P>
<P>
The Save Miramar Lake Committee was founded when Smith cranked out a flyer on 
her home computer in November and began to distribute it in a local shopping 
center. Underwood became co-chairman when he was one of the first to sign up. 
</P>
<P>
The committee actually opposes only 658 of the 3,360 homes planned for 1,200 
acres north of the lake. The homes, an industrial park and a road that will 
come within 75 yards of the lake, will destroy the peaceful, almost rural 
quality that makes Lake Miramar a popular urban retreat, Smith and Underwood 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a lovely, scenic area that thousands of San Diegans come to each 
year," Smith said. "This proposed development would destroy the beauty and 
aesthetic nature that make it so special for so many people." 
</P>
<P>
They also condemn developers' plans to slice off the tops of hills and fill in 
canyons in a sizable grading effort that will require the movement of about 17 
million cubic yards of earth, according to William Rick, president of Rick 
Engineering. About 20 million cubic yards of dirt were moved to create what is 
now Scripps Ranch, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Smith and Underwood also claim that runoff from chemicals used on the lawns of 
the new homes will contaminate Lake Miramar drinking water, consumed throughout 
San Diego. City officials say that builders have protected the reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
Although construction is years away, the committee had just 30 days from the 
council's Jan. 9 vote on the project to qualify a referendum for the ballot. 
Because BCE Development was awarded a development agreement guaranteeing it the 
right to build all 3,360 homes, the committee reluctantly called for repeal of 
the entire project. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Exempted the Area 
</P>
<P>
The city attorney's office opposed the agreement, advising that the contract 
would exempt BCE from any environmental controls enacted by the city. At 
Struiksma's urging, the council in 1987 exempted the area from its current, 
interim environmental protections. 
</P>
<P>
With about 200 volunteers and Glaser's paid petition circulators splitting the 
effort, Underwood estimates that the group will collect 40,000 signatures by 
its deadline at 5 p.m. Wednesday, more than enough to ensure that it has the 
25,593 valid signatures needed to qualify for the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
But a rival petition effort, launched by Miramar Ranch North Planning Group 
member Bob Dingeman, has collected an estimated 20,000 to 25,000 signatures of 
city residents who back the development, Dingeman said. Although the campaign 
has no legal validity, the petitions will be presented to the council in a show 
of support, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Financed by developers, primarily BCE, Dingeman's Committee to Protect Your 
Community also hired a petition-gathering firm, American Petition Consultants. 
</P>
<P>
The squabble has been nasty. The Save Miramar Lake Committee, alleging that its 
circulators had been harassed and intimidated, sought an injunction from a 
Superior Court judge to allow it to gather signatures unhindered. The two 
groups also became involved in a competition for circulators, driving up the 
price of each signature, Glaser alleged. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Settled Out of Court 
</P>
<P>
The legal battle was settled out of court when American Petition agreed to keep 
its circulators at least 10 feet from Glaser's workers, and Smith and Underwood 
retracted their allegations. 
</P>
<P>
Dingeman, who has spent nine years helping plan the Miramar Ranch North 
development, believes that the planning group and city officials drove a 
terrific bargain with BCE Development. 
</P>
<P>
Under the development agreement, the developer has agreed to build part of 
Alternate 8A, the desperately needed highway that will divert traffic off 
Pomerado Road in Scripps Ranch; contribute $2 million toward construction of a 
library in Scripps Ranch, and build the Mercy Road interchange to Interstate 
15, two parks and a fire station. 
</P>
<P>
He also notes that 25% of Miramar Ranch North will be preserved as open space 
and that homes on the lake's northern shore will be no closer to the lake than 
those on the lake's southern and eastern shores. 
</P>
<P>
"Development is inevitable under our American law and under the City Council's 
directives," said Dingeman, a retired Army colonel. "My aim over the years is 
to shape it in the best and most environmentally sensitive way that I can." 
</P>
<P>
BCE and the "8 to 10 other developers" Dingeman says contributed to his 
organization have already shown their ability to finance an expensive campaign 
in favor of the project, if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ever Optimistic 
</P>
<P>
Besides paying American Petition, the committee hired one of the city's most 
expensive public relations firms, Stoorza, Ziegaus &amp; Metzger, and financed 
the private phone-banking firm Competitive Edge to campaign against the 
referendum. It is also using direct mail. 
</P>
<P>
The building industry made heavy use of Competitive Edge phone banks in its 
victorious $2.4-million campaign against the slow-growth initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
Ever optimistic despite last November's drubbing and the near-certainty that 
they would be heavily outspent again, slow-growthers say a referendum covering 
a small, local area faces better prospects than the citywide and countywide 
slow-growth initiatives that lost by 11 to 17 percentage points last fall. 
</P>
<P>
They liken the upcoming battle more to the successful 1985 campaign for the 
Managed Growth Initiative, when just one referendum was on the ballot, than 
last year's loss. Unless the council or Dingeman places a competing referendum 
on the ballot, they said, the vote will note be split as it was last year. 
</P>
<P>
Glaser estimates that a successful campaign will cost about $100,000 
</P>
<P>
"It won't matter how much the development industry spends," he said. "They can 
spend their $2.5 million. It'll be a single issue." 
</P>
<P>
"This is very specific," added Linda Martin, co-chairwoman of Citizens for 
Limited Growth. People "can look at this, they can see what the local impact is 
on the community, and they can also see what the regional impact is."

HOPEFULS HIT THE HOME STRETCH IN RACE FOR DEL MAR LEASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For nearly two decades, the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club has comfortably presided 
over the annual 43-day horse-racing meet at the famed track, where turf meets 
surf. 
</P>
<P>
Manned by such notables as supermarket magnate John Mabee, former North County 
Congressman Clair Burgener and Democratic Party bigwig Robert Strauss, the 
nonprofit organization has carefully steered the Del Mar track from its 
scandal-plagued days of the late 1960s to a position today near the forefront 
of American horse racing. 
</P>
<P>
But that reign is being challenged by two feisty contenders for a new 20-year 
lease on the track. Both the Ogden-Nederlander partnership and John Brunetti, 
operator of the Hialeah track near Miami, argue that they could manage the Del 
Mar facility just as smoothly and deliver far more revenue to state coffers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Entering Home Stretch 
</P>
<P>
Now the race for the new lease has entered the home stretch, with a hearing 
before the state commission that will select a new operator set for Thursday at 
the fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
Perched anxiously at the rail are residents and officials of surrounding 
communities, who say the selection could have a dramatic impact on their lives. 
In particular, local leaders have chafed at the Ogden-Nederlander proposal, 
which calls for as many as 40 concerts, ranging from classical music to rock 
'n' roll, in addition to horse racing. 
</P>
<P>
Buffeted by that prospect, some odd alliances have formed of late. Del Mar 
leaders, worried that the concerts will cause nighttime traffic and noise, have 
joined hands with their traditional foes on the Del Mar Fair Board, who worry 
that the Ogden proposal could erode their jealously guarded control of the 
grounds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
On Inside Track? 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, state Finance Department officials have been busy sifting 
through the proposals, crunching enough numbers to give a supercomputer 
indigestion in an effort to determine which group offers the best deal. It has 
not been an easy task. One beleaguered state budget analyst suggested the 
process goes beyond comparing apples and oranges: "This is like a Waldorf 
salad." 
</P>
<P>
Although all bets are off on who will emerge the victor, many local officials 
say the Thoroughbred Club has the inside track for the lease. Most obviously, 
the club could benefit from the presence of three Fair Board directors on the 
state Race Track Leasing Commission, the six-member body that will decide the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, some Fair Board members on the commission seem to be leaning decidedly 
toward the Thoroughbred Club. 
</P>
<P>
"Not to sound trite, but why do you change horses if the horse has done a hell 
of a job for you?" asked Jan Anton, a fairgrounds director and commission 
member. "I think the Thoroughbred Club has done a good job and their lease 
proposal is the best in my mind for the state of California. They put all the 
money back into the facility." 
</P>
<P>
The commission, which exists for the sole purpose of handing out the Del Mar 
track lease, was created by state lawmakers in the midst of controversy over 
the award of the multimillion-dollar track contract in 1966 to John Alessio, a 
Tijuana racing and bookmaking operator later jailed for income-tax evasion. 
</P>
<P>
Dubbed the Alessio scandal, the affair also resulted in the Thoroughbred Club 
winning rights to the 20-year operating lease, which began in 1970 and expires 
next year. By most accounts, the club has done an effective job managing the 
track, which has seen steady growth through the years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Power Base 
</P>
<P>
The club has been dominated by some of the most wealthy and powerful men in San 
Diego County, leaders of commerce and politics who stand for nothing short of 
success. Among the 10 directors are Burgener, Strauss, North County 
construction mogul Werner Lusardi and local financier Thomas Stickel. 
</P>
<P>
By most accounts, however, the driving force has been Mabee, patriarch of the 
Big Bear grocery store chain and a devout horseman with his own 560-acre 
thoroughbred ranch in Ramona. For 10 years, Mabee has been president of the 
Thoroughbred Club. 
</P>
<P>
Although the track is rife with lore, among the most memorable tales is how 
Mabee came to the rescue one day in 1977 when the money needed to open the Del 
Mar betting widows had been inadvertently locked in a safe with no available 
key. Mabee put up the greenbacks by raiding the cash drawers of local Big Bear 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
The challengers point to such stories as proof that the Thoroughbred Club is 
little more than an aggregation of San Diego County good old boys, men who have 
grown fat and lazy in the role of running the track, men who have failed to 
utilize the facility to its fullest extent. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sort of like the cattlemen's club on the TV show 'Dallas,' " said one 
critic, who spoke on condition his name not be used. "They sort of sit around 
and say, 'I'll trade you a grocery store for an oil well.' It's an appendage to 
their personal prestige and personal wealth. I think that was nice and fine in 
its time, but today you've got to look at running this as a business." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scoff at Criticism 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the club scoff at such talk, saying it's to be expected in these 
competitive days. 
</P>
<P>
"If these are the kind of good-old boys that have made racing in California a 
success, then I guess we need even more of them," said Joe Harper, the club's 
general manager. "None of these guys make a cent, not one cent off being a 
director. There's no dividends or paid salaries. And, if you call sitting in 
the director's room at the track a perk, then that's what they get." 
</P>
<P>
Burgener also snorted at the criticisms. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really not like that," the longtime state legislator and former U. S. 
congressman said. "You get to go to the races for free, but, good Lord, it 
costs a heck of a lot more to get out of the place. I go maybe three or four 
days a year. A guy like John Mabee is there every day, but he has horses." 
</P>
<P>
More to the point, leaders of the club say, is the organization's steady 
performance in pushing Del Mar from its past, as little more than a hayseed 
track down in the sticks of San Diego County, to a position as one of the most 
lucrative and successful operations in the country. 
</P>
<P>
"When we took over the lease 19 year ago or so, the place was run-down and 
dilapidated," Harper said. "You couldn't get a $1-million average daily handle 
down there. But, by turning the profits back, by letting success foster itself, 
the track proved to be a winner. Now the average handle is more than $6 million 
a day. And I think it will continue to work." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nonprofit Versus Profit 
</P>
<P>
The track has won the support of groups ranging from the Jockey's Guild to 
local homeowners' associations. Moreover, since it is a nonprofit group, the 
club does not drain revenue, returning it instead to the operation or to the 
state, Harper said. 
</P>
<P>
"Ogden is a very successful, very well-run corporation," Harper said. "They 
don't go into ventures without a very clear-cut profit in mind. In looking at 
their figures . . . it becomes clear that they would take over $80 million out 
of the facility in profits. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good deal for them, and I don't blame them for wanting to get into 
that. I don't think, however, that it best serves racing or the state, and it 
certainly doesn't help the local people in Del Mar and Solana Beach, who will 
have to put up with those concerts." 
</P>
<P>
But officials with the Ogden-Nederlander partnership see it very differently. 
Although the company is, indeed, a for-profit operation, officials contend that 
the Del Mar track can be better utilized by offering the concert series. Under 
their scenario, revenues to the state would far exceed those expected by the 
Thoroughbred Club. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lure of New Grandstand 
</P>
<P>
The group has dangled another inviting plum in front of the Race Track Leasing 
Commission, promising to finance and build a 20,000-seat grandstand to replace 
the existing 9,600-seat complex, which is suffering the infirmities of old age. 
The facility could be built by 1991, with construction performed quickly so 
that racing would not be interrupted, the group promises. 
</P>
<P>
Officials with the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club acknowledge that the grandstand 
needs to be replaced, but say that task can be accomplished with publicly 
issued bonds. (A 15,000-seat grandstand costing about $85 million is in the 
design stages.) Whether the grandstand is built privately or with public 
financing, they argue, the money will come from the same primary source -- 
racing revenues. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, officials with the Nederlander partnership argue that, in these 
days of fiscal uncertainty for the state, only their proposal can deliver a new 
grandstand. 
</P>
<P>
"In the best interests of the state and the people of California, it's clear 
which bid is the best," said Neil Papiano, a Los Angeles attorney representing 
the partnership. "There is some provincialism on the part of some of the Fair 
Board members, who seem to favor the people who have been their friends and 
associates for a considerable period of time, but the fact is our offer is the 
best." 
</P>
<P>
The partnership is composed of the Nederlander Corp., an entertainment firm 
that operates several theaters in Los Angeles and puts on Broadway shows in New 
York, and the Ogden Corp., a multifaceted Fortune 500 company that owns a 
construction company, runs food concessions around the country and has operated 
several race tracks, including Suffolk Downs in the Boston area and Fairmount 
Park near St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
The partnership's board includes legendary jockey Bill Shoemaker and notables 
such as Buzzie Bavasi, former general manager of the San Diego Padres baseball 
team. Papiano breeds horses and was legal counsel to Hollywood Park for 15 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Papiano contends that the Del Mar facility has been under-utilized, a situation 
he would like to rectify by providing an eclectic concert series, ranging from 
symphony performances to nights with headliners. 
</P>
<P>
"At the peak of the summer tourist season, many people in the area are looking 
for things to do at night," he said. "We would bring in the best entertainment, 
make it the best sort of resort atmosphere, with state-of-the-art facilities." 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors have balked at the idea of nighttime concerts, fearing a crush of 
traffic and noise. They point to legal problems the outfit has run into with 
neighborhood activists around the Orange County Fairgrounds, which filed suit 
over concerts sponsored by Nederlander. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care what kind of concerts they would put on," Del Mar Councilwoman 
Brooke Eisenberg said. "It's just the additional noise, traffic and pollution 
we don't welcome." 
</P>
<P>
Papiano argued that critics are overstating the potential problems. Most of the 
concerts would draw 5,000 to 15,000 patrons, far fewer than attend the track on 
a typical weekday and a fraction of the weekend gate, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the group envisions few rock concerts, and even the sound generated 
by those events would require "an incredible set of atmospheric conditions" to 
reach the ears of nearby homeowners, Papiano maintained. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not talking about year-round at all," he said. "We're talking about 
principally during the racing season (usually mid-July through the end of 
September). We wouldn't do anything during the fair or the Grand Prix." 
</P>
<P>
The third contender for the Del Mar crown, New Jersey construction magnate and 
horse racing impresario John Brunetti, does not offer the possibility of 
concerts, but does promise horse racing -- lots of horse racing. 
</P>
<P>
Rod Blonien, a Sacramento attorney representing Brunetti, noted that the net 
return to the state from the Thoroughbred Club has declined in recent years and 
argued that a private operator could do better. 
</P>
<P>
Brunetti, who summers in Carlsbad, would accomplish that by offering more 
promotional days -- such as free binoculars, T-shirts or coffee mugs -- and by 
actively pushing the sale of tickets to groups in the region, Blonien said. 
</P>
<P>
He also proposes adding a 10th race to the daily card, a move that would 
undoubtably add revenue, the attorney said. Finally, Brunetti would try to 
persuade owners of top-flight thoroughbreds to bring their animals to Del Mar, 
sparking more attention to the track. 
</P>
<P>
Something of a controversial figure in racing, Brunetti has been involved in a 
number of squabbles with other Florida track owners over race dates in recent 
years. Moreover, some critics say Hialeah remains a second-rate facility. 
</P>
<P>
Blonien, however, said Brunetti has performed wonders at Hialeah, taking a 
track that consistently lost money and turning it into a profit-maker while 
investing more than $10 million in improvements. 
</P>
<P>
"People can criticize him for being sometimes outspoken, sometimes 
super-energetic, but no one can question his ability to handle a facility or 
what he's done at Hialeah, which is just short of a miracle," Blonien said. 
</P>
<P>
Brunetti would like to do the same at Del Mar, he said.

A VERY WORTHY NAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What's in a name? Shakespeare's question comes up again with the San Diego City 
Council's decision to name the not-yet completed convention center for Dr. 
Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Synchronous with the vote was the warning that commissioners of the San Diego 
Unified Port District, who have the final say, might refuse to approve the new 
name. 
</P>
<P>
Why? We are puzzled. Since naming public facilities after public, and some not 
so public, figures seems to be an ingrained habit, and a harmless one at that, 
the objection can hardly be on that score. 
</P>
<P>
Is it that the convention center itself, problem-plagued and unproven, seems an 
unworthy object to bear the name of a Nobel Peace Prize winner, a man who gave 
his energies and finally his life in the cause of freedom, brotherhood and 
justice? Perhaps. 
</P>
<P>
But the committee that spent months holding public hearings on this matter and 
the council have concluded that, at present, San Diego has nothing better to 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
Is a convention center named for Dr. King marketable? The center is a business 
enterprise, after all. What's in this name that can actually burnish the appeal 
of the new center? 
</P>
<P>
For a city long plagued by its insular image, the answer should be obvious. 
Martin Luther King became an American hero because he embodied the nation's 
highest values. The fact that San Diego wishes to attach his name to the 
convention center indicates a social awareness, a willingness to look beyond 
our own borders and a sophistication that ought to increase the undoubted 
attractiveness of the city in the minds of convention planners around the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
What's in the name of Martin Luther King, whom we honor in a national holiday, 
that makes it "inappropriate" for the convention center? Do the port 
commissioners fear that, even though they themselves are free of racial 
prejudice, other people in other places are not, and that the name of a black 
American will influence those people to stay away? 
</P>
<P>
They may resent the fact that, because the voters rejected the naming of Market 
Street for Dr. King, they now face an unwanted responsibility. Such feelings 
are not unreasonable. But they must be balanced against the need -- which Dr. 
King and the civil rights movement so eloquently demonstrated -- for people 
somewhere, sometime to take a stand for liberty and equality, risky though that 
may be. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, the risk appears minuscule and the benefits great. The City 
Council should be applauded for recognizing this. We hope the port 
commissioners will be equally foresighted. Taylor Branch's prize-winning new 
biography of King, "Parting the Waters," might help them make up their minds.

COMMENTARY;

<P>
IT WILL BE A COLD DAY WHEN SAN DIEGANS TELL TRUTH ABOUT WEATHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNY J. CANTOR, Jenny J. Cantor is a free-lance writer who lives in San 
Carlos. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was cold, so cold that Saturday night we slept in jogging suits and thick, 
wool socks. Out on the patio, the plants we forgot to take in turned black from 
the frost. The next morning it was a long, cold run down the driveway to pick 
up the Sunday paper, and it was not much warmer in our kitchen. We huddled at 
the breakfast table, clutching mugs of hot tea in one hand, turning the pages 
of the newspaper with the other. 
</P>
<P>
Something in the magazine supplement caught my attention. "Listen," I said. 
"Listen to this." I read a description of our winter weather: In a semitropical 
climate where January sometimes feels like July . . . and passed around the 
picture of a pretty model in a sleeveless, white, linen dress. 
</P>
<P>
The age-old myth persists: Southern California is a winter wonderland of 
near-tropical temperatures, balmy nights, and soft, gentle breezes wafting 
through the fronds of the palm trees -- a myth that moves along year after year 
fueled by the bald-faced lies told by you and me. 
</P>
<P>
I learned how to tell them at my daddy's knee. Forty years ago, Midwestern 
relatives would telephone to complain about the icy winds that blew drifts of 
snow against their homes, sending heating costs soaring. My parents would 
sympathize, say all the right words and then tell San Diego's biggest seasonal 
lie: Heat? Here? We haven't turned ours on at all this year. 
</P>
<P>
No one ever told those relatives about the cold mornings when we argued -- in 
those days before automatic thermostats -- over who would get out of bed first 
to turn on the heat-we-never-used. 
</P>
<P>
Today I continue to keep the myth alive. I can complain to my neighbor of how 
cold my feet become and of how often my toes turn blue, but I will not speak of 
it to outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
When Dan calls from Kansas City to complain of chilblain and frostbite, I 
counter with a sad story of sunscreen rash . . . and touch the tip of my nose 
to see if, like Pinocchio's, it grew. 
</P>
<P>
When Julie in Sioux Falls moans about the cost of a winter coat, I say all the 
right words in sympathy but add, "We rarely wear wool out here," and check the 
length of my nose once again. 
</P>
<P>
Each of us does it. In the middle of a record cold snap the Los Angeles Times 
writes "semitropical weather." Travel brochures are illustrated with full-color 
pictures of bikini-clad women on the beach. Hotel advertising features couples 
tanning side-by-side on chaise longues while sipping tall, cool drinks. To the 
tourists who believed the brochures, who walk the zoo in shorts, sandals and 
midriff-length T-shirts asking why it is 57 not 75 degrees, each of us answers, 
"Just a fluke. It's sure to warm up tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Warm up to what? To 59 degrees? 
</P>
<P>
I imagine the myth began when San Diego was a small town far from the 
hurly-burly of Los Angeles and the bigger cities to the east; at a time when 
local boosters thought they had nothing to boast of and developers thought they 
had nothing to sell but good weather and a zoo. 
</P>
<P>
The myth continues because San Diegans now have nothing but the weather to 
boast about. The zoo is touched by scandal. Sea World is too. Our beaches are 
often closed by pollution. Smog is in our air. Homeless live on our streets. We 
have crooked politicians, violent and white-collar crime. We are no longer 
America's Finest City but the meth capital of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Everything we could boast of, including the weather, has let us down. But the 
weather is capricious. Today's bitter cold may be a fluke. Tomorrow? Tomorrow 
it might be 75 degrees. So, just as the newspapers, the advertisements, and 
other San Diegans do, I continue to fudge the truth. 
</P>
<P>
When Lee from Omaha sighs and says over the telephone, "I suppose you're all 
set for a dip in the pool?" I answer back, "You bet." 
</P>
<P>
I never confess that morning attire in my kitchen is the long underwear that 
was bought to be worn on a ski trip.

GETTING AN UNFAIR RAP? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After reading the Jan. 10 edition of The Times, I was somewhat puzzled with one 
of your headlines. While not finding anything wrong with the basic content of 
the article, I did find the title rather offensive. The article I am referring 
to is "A La Jolla Life on a Mira Mesa Income." 
</P>
<P>
Although I recognize that your intent was not to insult the Mira Mesa 
community, the title seemed to imply that we are living in some sort of ghetto 
of San Diego. While it may not be La Jolla, I am very happy to live in Mira 
Mesa as are many of the naval officers that live around me. We all take pride 
in our community and hope that many of the unfair raps the area gets cease.

REFLECTIONS: 'I STILL HAVE THE BROWN ENVELOPES MY PAY CAME IN.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Caroline Lemke, Times staff writer 
</P>

How many secretaries can boast that they've sold antiques to Lana Turner, and 
seen Salvador Dali throw a temper tantrum -- and a bathtub -- through a display 
window at one of New York's most chic clothing stores? Dorothy Hay of San 
Marcos can. For almost 50 of her 70 years, Hay has been a secretary, never 
tiring of filing, typing and taking dictation. But excitement seems to 
gravitate toward her like lint to blue serge. In 1939 she worked for Bonwit 
Teller, New York City's elegant dress and accessories shop and arch rival to 
Bergdoff Goodman. It was at Bonwit's that Hay saw such celebrities as Dorothy 
Lamour, the Bennett sisters and Gloria Vanderbilt. An independent woman before 
it was fashionable, Hay moved to California alone during World War II to find 
work. She fell in love with "paradise" and has been here ever since. Times 
staff writer Caroline Lemke interviewed Hay at the Antique Mart in Leucadia, 
and Bob Grieser photographed her. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
I was born in Bristol, Conn. I just couldn't wait to get out of high school and 
go to New York City. That was where all the action and excitement was. When I 
was a sophomore in high school, I met an artist who took a liking to me. When 
Easter vacation came, she invited me to come to New York. My parents let me go. 
My father always said she ruined my life. I don't think she did; she opened 
this great big door. 
</P>
<P>
I answered an ad in the paper for a messenger position at Bonwit Teller. Within 
three weeks I became a secretary to the buyer of handbags. Bonwit's was the 
elegant shop on 5th Avenue in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
I worked six days a week for $15 a week. And I had to pay $10 a week to live at 
the Ferguson House. If you were late five minutes, or if you were sick a day, 
they docked your salary. I still have the brown envelopes my pay came in. We 
were paid in $2 bills and change. It was hard, but it was fun and exciting. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, the president of the store decided to give all the illustrious 
artists a window to decorate. One of the artists he chose was Salvador Dali. 
</P>
<P>
Each artist was told they could do their window any way they wanted. What Dali 
did was take one of those old-fashioned standing bathtubs, line it with real 
black Persian lamb fur -- sporadically, not completely, so there was some white 
of the tub showing -- and in the bottom of the tub, where the water should be, 
he had blazing red hot coals. They looked like they were really on fire. And on 
top of the coals he had placed this nude mannequin. 
</P>
<P>
The windows were finished Saturday night, and on Sunday morning the president 
of the store was walking down 5th Avenue to preview the windows, sees Dali's 
window, and he calls up the display manager and says: "Sunday or not, you've 
got to come down here and change this window. It's disgraceful. It's shocking." 
</P>
<P>
You should not fool around with an artist's work. On Monday, Dali came down to 
admire his wonderful creation and saw it changed. It incensed him so much that 
he just sneaked in behind the cosmetic department, slid the doors back and went 
into the front window, picked up his creation and threw it out the window. I 
never forgot that. 
</P>
<P>
When I came to California, I didn't know a single, solitary soul. It was still 
wartime and you couldn't find a place to stay or a hotel or anything. I ended 
up in Laguna Beach and got a job as a secretary for an antique shop, the 
Treasure Chest. 
</P>
<P>
One day when the owner was very busy with a customer, I saw Lana Turner get out 
of her gorgeous pale-blue Cadillac convertible and run up our stairs. She said, 
"Do you have something for a man who smokes a pipe?" Well, I did so much 
dusting and polishing between typing letters that I said: "Yes, I have 
something wonderful. I have a match safe." I went into the display case and got 
out this sterling silver match box. It's a narrow box to put Blue Diamond 
matches in, and on the bottom there's a little scratcher made of riveted lines. 
She thought that was wonderful. We went through this whole thing, and, before 
she got through, I had gotten about $750 written up on the sales slip and the 
owner never even got to see her. 
</P>
<P>
When I showed her the sales slip, she said: "Dorothy, you are no longer a 
secretary. You are a salesperson."

TYSON BEATABLE IF NOT TAKING CARE OF BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Frank Bruno was having little problem battering sparring partner James 
Pritchard, much to the delight of the retirees who crowded inside a makeshift 
tent to watch the workout. 
</P>
<P>
Pritchard, a compact heavyweight, was supposed to be emulating Mike Tyson, who 
Bruno will fight for the heavyweight title. Except he didn't fight much like 
Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
"Tyson throws a lot more punches than I do," Pritchard admitted. "And he throws 
them awfully hard." 
</P>
<P>
Bruno is likely to find that out the hard way Feb. 25 when he steps into the 
Las Vegas Hilton ring an overwhelming underdog against Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
The hulking British challenger -- who hasn't fought in 16 months -- is a 9 
1/2-1 underdog against Tyson. Oddsmakers say it is even money whether the fight 
will last a full four rounds. 
</P>
<P>
Even Pritchard, Bruno's own sparring partner, admits his employer may be in 
over his head. 
</P>
<P>
"I give Frank one of the best chances because of the controversy in Tyson's 
life," Pritchard says. "But without the controversy, Tyson is basically 
unbeatable." 
</P>
<P>
The turmoil in Tyson's life is also on Bruno's mind as he trains daily before a 
bleacher filled with spectators in this planned community in the hills outside 
of Phoenix. Bruno came here in early January to set up his camp well away from 
his British followers and the media. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a peak time to beat Mike Tyson," Bruno insists. "What he is going 
through -- I don't think his mind is 100 percent on the job." 
</P>
<P>
That Bruno is pinning some of his chance of winning the title on Tyson being 
distracted by his marital and managerial problems may be an indication that 
this fight will be as much a mismatch as most of Tyson's fights have been. 
</P>
<P>
"After the fight you ask Frank Bruno whether it was such a peak time," Tyson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Bruno is upbeat and confident as he enters his final week of training 
before breaking camp for Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm actually looking forward to the fight," he said. "The pressure is not on 
me. He's got everything to prove to everyone." 
</P>
<P>
The normally affable contender bristled recently when a reporter asked him if 
he was fighting Tyson just for the $3.8 million payday, with no hope of 
winning. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a crazy question," he shot back. "I've made money before and this ain't 
about money. I've got a nice life, a good home, a family. I'm content with my 
life. But I'm not going to let the cherry pass me by again." 
</P>
<P>
Bruno, despite his 32-2 record and No. 1 ranking by the World Boxing 
Association and World Boxing Council, enters the fight with somewhat less than 
sterling credentials. 
</P>
<P>
He was stopped in his first try for the heavyweight title in the 11th round by 
Tim Witherspoon in July 1986, and has not fought since October 1987 when he 
stopped an aging Joe Bugner in the eighth round in London. 
</P>
<P>
Bruno's chin is also suspect, as evidenced by his knockout losses to 
Witherspoon and James "Bonecrusher" Smith. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a young man when I fought Smith and Witherspoon," the 27-year-old 
challenger said. "I matured late, Mike Tyson matured early. I'm a man now, I've 
got a couple years on my chest." 
</P>
<P>
Bruno does have power, with 31 of his wins coming by knockout, but at 6-foot-3 
and 240 pounds he has the body more of a weightlifter than a fighter and his 
punches are often slow in reaching their mark. 
</P>
<P>
That could be a fatal flaw against the 22-year-old champion, who throws punches 
from everywhere and possesses the quickness of few heavyweights before him. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a windmill sort of guy," Bruno said. "I'm conditioning myself for that. 
My punches will also be coming from everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Bruno talks vaguely about a "plan" he has to beat Tyson, but says he can't 
reveal it. His manager, Terry Lawless, though, is more forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
"The key to beating Tyson is getting him to go backwards," Lawless says. "He 
can't do anything fighting backwards." 
</P>
<P>
Lawless sees Bruno keeping Tyson at a distance with a stiff left jab, then 
backing him up with combinations until he at some point hurts the champion. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the theory, but of course he'll have to do it the night of the fight," 
Lawless admits. 
</P>
<P>
Bruno, who has fought outside of England only three times, was supposed to have 
met Tyson in London last September. 
</P>
<P>
But the fight was postponed six different times and finally moved to Las Vegas 
at Tyson's request. Instead of 60,000 hometown fans cheering him on, Bruno will 
rely on the support of about 3,000 of his countrymen who are scheduled to make 
the trip for the fight. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand I'm the underdog, but I get strength from it," Bruno said. "Being 
in America I'm an underdog. Being British means I'm another underdog."

IRWIN, COUPLES JOIN BATTLE FOR TOP SPOT; 
</P>

PAIR PLUS LYLE, CALCAVECCHIA AT 8 UNDER WHEN DARKNESS HALTS PLAY

Hale Irwin advanced into a four-way tie for the lead Saturday as rain and 
darkness forced third-round play of the $1 million Los Angeles Open to be 
suspended. 
</P>
<P>
Irwin, 43, a two-time U.S. Open champ, completed only nine holes before 
darkness settled over the rain-soaked Riviera Country Club course halting play 
for the day. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, halfway through the round, he was tied with Masters champion 
Sandy Lyle of Scotland and Mark Calcavecchia for the lead at 169, eight under 
par for 45 holes. Fred Couples, playing in front of them, birdied the 11th hole 
and also was eight under. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll come back early Sunday morning to finish the third round, then start the 
final round about 10:30 (a.m., PST)," said Mike Shea, Tournament Director for 
the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
Shea was aware, however, that his weather worries may not be over. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a forecast for a 50% chance of more rain," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Should further delays occur, the possibility exists for a Monday finish, Shea 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"If half the field completes fourth-round play, it's an official round. And 
that means we come back Monday," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The weather problems began Friday when a drizzling rain turned to steady 
showers, flooded some greens on the Riviera Country Club course and forced an 
overnight delay in completing the second round. 
</P>
<P>
Almost half the field, 71 players, were forced to finish their rounds Saturday 
morning in a chilly rain and winds strong enough to knock branches off trees. 
</P>
<P>
Couples did the best job in those dreadful conditions, finishing off a 68 and 
moving to within three shots of the lead at 137. 
</P>
<P>
Lyle, Calcavecchia and Irwin all completed second-round play on Friday. Lyle 
and Calcavecchia shared the top spot at 134. 
</P>
<P>
Irwin, who narrowly avoided serious injury when he was struck in the forehead 
by a ball during pro-am play Wednesday, was at 137. 
</P>
<P>
Continued bad weather delayed the start of the third round. It was after 3 p.m. 
when the leaders began play. 
</P>
<P>
"The waiting around, the uncertainty of whether we were going to play, is the 
most difficult part of it," Irwin said. 
</P>
<P>
Irwin began three shots back of Lyle and Calcavecchia and birdied four of the 
first six holes, including a 70-foot putt on No. 3. He played the front side 
3-under-par 32. Lyle and Calcavecchia each reached the turn in par 35. Couples 
was out in 33, then got a share of the lead with his birdie on the 11th hole . 
</P>
<P>
Steve Pate was next at 6-under par for the tournament through 10 holes. 
</P>
<P>
Tied at 5 under par were Nick Faldo of Britain, Donnie Hammond, Mark Brooks, 
Mike Reid and Gene Sauers. Reid and Sauers were through nine holes, Brooks 
through 11, Faldo 13 and Hammond 16. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Watson was one of only nine men who completed third-round play. He had a 73 
and was at 215, 2-over par. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Magee, Tommy Armour III and D.A. Weibring were the clubhouse leaders at 
213. Each shot a third-round 71.

FLACH, SEGUSO HELP U.S. PUT DOWN PARAGUAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL DWYRE, Times Sports Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
FT. MYERS, Fla. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shortly after completing the exorcism of the Ghost of Jimmy Arias Past, the 
dashing duo of American tennis, Team Flach and Seguso, did their Comedy Store 
routine Saturday. That proved that although no doubles team in the world is 
safe against this pair, Johnny Carson is. 
</P>
<P>
Flach and Seguso had just beaten Paraguay's Francisco Gonzalez and Victor Pecci 
for the clinching point in this first-round Davis Cup matchup at the Sonesta 
Sanibel Harbour Resort Stadium, before an enthusiastic sellout crowd of 5,500, 
whose only complaint might have been that it ended so quickly. Flach and Seguso 
won, 6-1, 6-3, 6-4, in a match that took 1 hour 26 minutes, hardly more than a 
warm-up in Davis Cup play. 
</P>
<P>
And their victory, added to singles victories Friday by Michael Chang and Andre 
Agassi, brought about the desired pay-back to Paraguay, which had sent the U.S. 
Davis Cup effort reeling with a 3-2 stunner in Asuncion, Paraguay, in March, 
1987. In that one, Arias was leading Hugo Chapacu, 5-1, in the fifth set of a 
match that would have won it for the United States. But that match, not to 
mention America's immediate Davis Cup future, disintegrated into an ugly scene 
of bad line calls and loud catcalls. 
</P>
<P>
When Arias eventually lost, 9-7 in the fifth, and teammate Aaron Krickstein 
went out in straight sets to Pecci in the deciding match, the U.S. players kept 
special spots in their hearts for Paraguay. Or perhaps it was other parts of 
their anatomy. 
</P>
<P>
As Flach said in a news conference Thursday, his fondest memory of Paraguay was 
"the flight out." To which Seguso added that his was "the death threat." 
</P>
<P>
So when the World Group Draw for Davis Cup was made last October, and the U.S. 
team had clawed its way back into that elite company after nearly a 2-year 
absence caused by the defeat at Paraguay, there was great delight when Paraguay 
came out of the hat. The word "revenge" suddenly got big play. 
</P>
<P>
When all that talk became reality Saturday, the prevailing mood was mellow and 
fun -- at least for those from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Flach and Seguso were the fun leaders. Rowan and Martin they weren't, but that 
didn't stop them from trying. Normally, a news conference with Flach and Seguso 
resembles a tryout for the Improv. Shoot out some one-liners and see how they 
fly. Touch on tennis only in passing. Get some laughs. 
</P>
<P>
And so it was Saturday, only more so. 
</P>
<P>
 -- At one point during the rout, Flach double faulted twice in a row to give 
Gonzalez and Pecci two break points. A reporter, noticing Seguso had given a 
hand-signal at that point to Flach, asked if the thumbs-up was meant to be a 
gesture of encouragement. Seguso said, "No, it meant, just get the damn thing 
in this time." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Another reporter, making the observation that the rap against Flach and 
Seguso has been that they tend to lose concentration during matches, asked them 
to comment. Seguso pointed to Flach and said, "Obviously, that question is for 
you." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The network tennis commentator, Bud Collins of the Boston Globe, asked them 
what had happened in the Masters tournament late last year, when they played 
badly. Seguso said, "It was a long year, Bud." Flach added, "We lost a couple 
of matches at 7-6 in the fifth. Plus, we went to the Olympics and that took 
something out of us. Geez, when you think of it, we lost all those Grand Prix 
points, gosh darn, and all for that stupid little gold medal." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Flach was asked about his ongoing feud with Gonzalez. He had allegedly said 
something harsh to the Paraguayan during their '87 doubles match, and Gonzalez 
had allegedly spat at him. Here, they have exchanged thinly veiled niceties. 
Flach said: "When we did the gift exchange today, everybody had handed out 
their gifts and all that was left was Gonzalez and me. So Francisco and me, 
there we are. So we exchange gifts and shake hands. We're big buddies. We'll 
probably be going out to dinner a lot now." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Asked to speculate about how Arias might have felt as he watched this, 
Seguso said: "I'm sure he enjoyed that. He and Aaron are still part of our 
Davis Cup family." And Flach said: "I'm sure he liked it for us to go out and 
rub them out." Seguso: "Yeah, like a couple of bugs." Flach: "Pretty big bugs. 
Yeah, 6-foot-4 bugs." 
</P>
<P>
One of the 6-4 bugs, Gonzalez, may have outdone Flach and Seguso without even 
trying in his portion of the news conference. In answer to a question about 
when he realized that it was over for Paraguay, Gonzalez went through a long 
explanation of how you never know until the end and how Paraguay had once come 
back from 2 matches down and 2 match points against it in the doubles to win. 
</P>
<P>
"You know what they say," he said in somewhat broken English. "It's never over 
until the fat lady sings." 
</P>
<P>
The American expression coming out of the mouth of a Paraguayan, although a 
somewhat Americanized Paraguayan, struck a funny chord with many. Well, perhaps 
you had to be there. 
</P>
<P>
One person who wasn't there and wished he were was Arias, who was playing in an 
exhibition tournament at Amarillo, Tex. When reached by the Ft. Myers 
News-Press, Arias said that he was happy to see the victory, but that nothing 
would ever completely wipe out the memory of Paraguay, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
For Arias, the fat lady will always be Paraguayan. And will never sing. 
</P>
<P>
For Flach and Seguso, who have won all 9 of their Davis Cup matches, 7 of them 
outside the United States, the memory of all this will be a bit different. It 
will merely be a time when they got the last laugh. 
</P>
<P>
Notes 
</P>
<P>
Because the team victory has been clinched, today's matches, pitting Michael 
Chang against Hugo Chapacu and Andre Agassi against Victor Pecci, will be cut 
to best-of-three sets. ESPN will televise the matches, starting at 9 a.m. . . . 
Aaron Krickstein, the other U.S. loser in that 3-2 Paraguay upset in '87, was 
also contacted by the Ft. Myers newspaper and said that he felt he should have 
been selected by captain Tom Gorman to play here, rather than Chang. . . . The 
most revealing statistic of Saturday's doubles match was the number of points 
won by each player returning first serves. Robert Seguso, perhaps the world's 
best at doubles return of service, won 15. His partner Ken Flach, plus 
opponents Pecci and Francisco Gonzalez, totaled 15. . . . Flach and Seguso were 
not broken once in their quick 3-set victory.

MORNING BRIEFING: HE CAN HONESTLY SAY HE'S WORTH A MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dwayne Schintzius, a junior at the University of Florida, can sleep nights now 
that he has insured his future -- even if he doesn't have one in the National 
Basketball Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The 7-foot 2-inch center recently took out a $1-million insurance policy with 
Lloyd's of London for protection in case he is injured before he gets a chance 
to play professionally. 
</P>
<P>
"From now until I turn pro, if I can't pass an NBA physical, I get a million 
dollars," Schintzius said. 
</P>
<P>
Schintzius' policy makes life easier on the Florida basketball program, too, 
because it increases the likelihood that he will return to Florida next year. 
</P>
<P>
However, Linda Schintzius, Dwayne's mother, said he was planning to remain at 
Florida regardless so he could play with his brother Travis, a high school 
senior who signed a letter of intent to play at Florida next season. 
</P>
<P>
The younger Schintzius has yet to contact Lloyd's. 
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press interviewed 36 members of its All-American football team 
in the wake of the recent debate over the merits of the National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. requirements for scholarship athletes. 
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that good players and good grades go together, and some of 
the athletes explained the reasons, or in some cases, the motivation 
responsible for that finding: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Oklahoma's Tony Phillips: "On the average I think most of your better 
football players are the more intelligent ones. Sometimes you can make up for a 
lack of talent with intelligence." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Arkansas' Kendall Trainor: "Coach (Ken) Hatfield knows if you don't go to 
class. Sometimes I think he has people following us around. And if you miss a 
class, you have to do a series of 300-yard runs at 6:30 a.m. called the 
Razorback Reminder." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Washington State's Mike Utley: "I probably would have been a manual laborer 
if it hadn't been for football, but now I'll get a degree." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Alabama's Derrick Thomas: "I will graduate, and football was my ticket." 
</P>
<P>
Donald Trump may be new to boating, but when faced with registering his new 
luxury yacht, the Trump Princess, he wasn't too hard-pressed to figure a way 
around the 6% sales tax on the $29-million price tag. 
</P>
<P>
Trump formed an out-of-state corporation to buy the yacht, closed the sale in 
London, took possession of the vessel in international waters off the coast of 
France and painted "Bahamas" on the stern. 
</P>
<P>
This didn't sit well with New Jersey tax agents, who sued for a $1.74-million 
"use tax" because the ship is used mainly in New Jersey waters. 
</P>
<P>
Trump, however, got around the use tax, saying that the Trump Princess is used 
for promotional purposes and therefore New Jersey can tax only the $400,000 
lease payments. 
</P>
<P>
Only three people showed up last week at a golf course in Grand Island, Neb., 
to play in the "First Annual Groundhog Day Golf Tournament," and for good 
reason. 
</P>
<P>
The temperature was 2 below zero and the wind-chill factor made it feel like 46 
below. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to use the golf clubs as a hammer to drive in the tees," Steve 
Rasmussen said. Golf balls froze, plastic in the bottom of two golf bags broke 
out when clubs were dropped, "and the frozen greens were fast," Rasmussen said. 
</P>
<P>
"The golf balls became crystallized about the 18th hole," he said. "The shock 
on the elbows was about like hitting a rock with a baseball bat. We actually 
thought the balls were going to explode." 
</P>
<P>
Just being frank: Boxer Frank Bruno, on his chances of beating Mike Tyson for 
the heavyweight title Feb. 25 in Las Vegas: 
</P>
<P>
"This is a peak time to beat Mike Tyson," Bruno said, referring to Tyson's 
marital and managerial problems in recent months. "What he is going through -- 
I don't think his mind is 100% on the job." 
</P>
<P>
Tyson's response: "After the fight you ask Frank Bruno whether it was such a 
peak time." 
</P>
<P>

Louisville center Pervis Ellison, after being injured recently in a game 
against Ohio State: "I could just see dollar bills flying away. I guess that's 
why I couldn't say anything."

STARLING AND BRELAND WIN TITLES, NOW THEY'LL MEET AGAIN

A couple of former welterweight champions became champions again at Caesars 
Palace Saturday night, one in a near-classic brawl that looked like something 
out of boxing's bygone years and the other in a disgraceful mismatch. 
</P>
<P>
The bell-ringer was Marlon Starling's come-from-behind, 9th-round technical 
knockout of England's Lloyd Honeyghan, giving Starling the World Boxing Council 
welterweight title. 
</P>
<P>
The mismatch was Mark Breland's one-round destruction of an inept South Korean, 
Lee Seung-Soon, giving Breland the vacant World Boxing Assn. title. 
</P>
<P>
For reasons that remain part of the confused business of professional boxing, 
the WBA consistently ranks South Korean boxers higher than the sport's two 
other organizations. And almost every time a South Korean comes to the United 
States to fight for a championship, he loses. 
</P>
<P>
Breland had Lee on the deck in 40 seconds, and finished him in 54 seconds. For 
that, Lee made $85,000. 
</P>
<P>
For Breland (23-1-1), who earned $125,000, it was easy redemption. He had lost 
his WBA title to Starling in 1987, then had a disappointing draw with Starling. 
His original opponent Saturday was to have been WBA champion Tomas Molinares of 
Columbia, who withdrew -- and was stripped of his title -- because of "severe 
depression." 
</P>
<P>
Starling-Honeyghan was a memorable bout between two tough fighters. 
</P>
<P>
Starling (44-5-1) seemed to have won the first two rounds, when both fighters 
were throwing bombs. Both started fast, and Starling rocked Honeyghan with left 
hooks and short right uppercuts in the early going. 
</P>
<P>
He staggered Honeyghan early in the second with a long right hand to the 
forehead, but Honeyghan danced away from danger. 
</P>
<P>
In the third, Honeyghan suddenly caught fire. On the attack, he chased the 
unorthodox Hartford, Conn., boxer all over the ring. In the third and fourth 
rounds, Honeyghan was throwing about a hundred punches a round, a tiring pace. 
The most effective of the punches were thumping right hands to Starling's ribs. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, it was difficult to see Starling holding together. But that was 
the ebb. Then came the flow. 
</P>
<P>
Honeyghan seemed to have tired badly by the fifth, and he looked it. His right 
eye was closing, a big lump was growing over his right cheek and his nose bled. 
</P>
<P>
Starling, sensing Honeyghan was fading quickly, turned up the heat in the 
fifth. He worked him over on the ropes, and with a left hook knocked 
Honeyghan's bloody mouthpiece into the second row of the press section. 
</P>
<P>
In the sixth, Honeyghan was running and holding. Now the British champion was 
taking a brutal beating. His distorted face and the roar of the 4,069 in 
Caesars Pavilion evoked an earlier era in boxing, when fights such as these 
were held behind locked warehouse doors in the middle of the night, or on 
barges in the Hudson River. 
</P>
<P>
In the 7th, 8th and 9th, the beating continued. The end came at 1:19 of the 
9th. He simply crumpled over, not, seemingly, from any one punch, but from the 
accumulation of Starling's crisp blows. 
</P>
<P>
After the eighth, the ringside physician, Dr. Flip Homansky, checked to see if 
Honeyghan had a broken jaw. Satisfied that it wasn't, Homansky let him 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Honeyghan (33-2), who earned $650,000, went to the hospital for 
X-rays afterward. Starling made $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
Honeyghan, 28, must sit on the sidelines and watch Breland and Starling meet 
for the third time, a match Breland's co-manager, Dan Duva, began talking up 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Starling was asked whether the much-described bad blood between he and 
Honeyghan had now softened. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I'm not going to sleep with him," Starling said, straight-faced. 
</P>
<P>
He simply wanted to demonstrate who the champion was, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to show the world that there is only one welterweight champion in the 
whole, wide world," he said. "I went in there to get respect from Lloyd in the 
ring. He was ready to quit in the fifth round, I knew then it was only a matter 
of time." 
</P>
<P>
The battered Honeyghan, stopped by the interview tent to make a short 
statement, took no questions, then left for the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"Marlon gave me a great fight. . . .I wish him the best. He'll be a great 
champion. He beat me, so he has to be the true champion." 
</P>
<P>
At that, Starling stood up and hugged the former champion. 
</P>
<P>
Breland, who was 110-1 as an amateur, thinks he has acquired the fire many in 
boxing felt he lacked as a pro. 
</P>
<P>
"Things were easy for me for so long," he said, "I had to learn that you have 
to get mentally pumped up for this sport every time. Tonight, I felt real nasty 
in the dressing room, like an animal. I felt great."

STANFORD BEATS FLORIDA, 84-69, IN FIRST GAME AT ORLANDO ARENA

<P>
A crowd of 14,687 packed the Orlando Arena for its basketball debut, but 
20th-ranked Stanford spoiled the day by beating Florida, 84-69. 
</P>
<P>
"This is our first time on national TV, and to come into a place like this and 
win is great," Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery said. "It isn't Florida's home 
court, but it's almost like it is." 
</P>
<P>
Todd Lichti led the Cardinal, scoring 27 points, 17 in the first half. Howard 
Wright added 17 for Stanford, including 10 during the final six minutes of the 
first half, when Stanford (16-5) jumped to a 44-33 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"In the first half, I felt we really ran well," Montgomery said. "Lichti shot 
the ball like he always seemed to -- right through the hoop." 
</P>
<P>
Florida (11-10) cut the lead to 60-52 midway through the second half on 
Clifford Lett's 3-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
But Wright and Terry Taylor quickly stopped the rally, scoring all of 
Stanford's 15 points in the next seven minutes as Stanford took its biggest 
lead, 75-58. 
</P>
<P>
"In the second half, we started off by missing some easy shots, but Florida 
didn't shoot well either, so that helped," Montgomery said. 
</P>
<P>
Florida, led by Livingston Chatman with 14 points and Dwayne Schintzius with 
13, had foul trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't play well and they did," Florida Coach Norm Sloan said. "We had some 
spurts, but every time we got something going, they would do something to take 
us out of it. It was their day and not ours."

LOYOLA FINDS TOUCH, BEATS SAN DIEGO, 139-104

<P>
Loyola Marymount rediscovered its shooting touch Saturday night and Hank 
Gathers decided to add passing to his repertoire in a 139-104 runaway over the 
University of San Diego before a sellout of 4,085 at Gersten Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
With the victory, Loyola pulled into a second-place tie with St. Mary's in the 
West Coast Athletic Conference, one game behind Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
In its highest-scoring conference game of the season, Loyola took control in 
the early minutes. So for variety, Gathers -- the nation's scoring and 
rebounding leader -- went to work on his passing. He finished with 30 points, 
14 rebounds and 9 assists. 
</P>
<P>
"I could lead the nation in assists if I wanted to," Gathers said. 
</P>
<P>
Many of Gathers' assists came on 3-pointers. Loyola (13-2 overall, 6-2 in the 
conference) made 14 of 25 3-point shots, outscoring the Toreros from 3-point 
range, 42-9. Jeff Fryer, Enoch Simmons and Bo Kimble made 4 each. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego (6-14, 1-7) was outscored by only 20 points in its 7 previous WCAC 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Reserve Craig Cottrell had 26 points and 8 rebounds, Wayman Strickland added 21 
points and Gylan Dottin had 14 points for the Toreros. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola took control after a 21-20 lead with a 42-9 run to take a 63-29 
advantage with 5 minutes left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola got its 3-point shooting warmed up and made 7 of 15 on the way to a 
73-48 halftime lead. Fryer and Simmons combined for five 3-pointers and each 
had 17 points in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions made their first 14 free throws before missing one just before 
halftime. They made 19 of 26 free throws overall, to San Diego's 11 of 22. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola maintained 30-point leads the rest of the game, reaching the 100-point 
mark with nearly 12 minutes left, 101-64. The lead increased to 117-77 with 
8:25 left as Per Stumer made two consecutive 3-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
Fryer finished with 29 points, Simmons 25 and Kimble 22 as the Lions shot 55% 
for the game. San Diego was also hurt by 25 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice when we have it greased," Lion Coach Paul Westhead said of the 
team's accurate shooting. "At halftime I told the guys, 'Hank is giving up the 
ball.' That's a very bright sign. He has every reason to shoot. Every time he 
passes he can get an assist because he always has three people on him." 
</P>
<P>
Westhead was also pleased to see a good offensive effort on the heels of Friday 
night's 116-104 loss to St. Mary's, a defeat he felt came because of his team's 
scoring shortcomings rather than St. Mary's defense. 
</P>
<P>
"At the shootaround today we emphasized the break, no matter what," he said. 
"San Diego got 104. We can absorb (opponents') easy baskets. But we have to be 
up around 130." ALAN DROOZ USF 62, Gonzaga 50 -- Joel DeVortoli scored 20 
points and Mark McCathrion added 17 points and 12 rebounds to pace the Dons at 
San Francisco. USF is 12-9 and 4-4, and Gonzaga is 12-9 and 3-6. USF won with a 
tough defense by holding Gonzaga's two leading scorers, Jim McPhee and Doug 
Spradley, to a total of 21 points on 5-of-20 shooting from the floor. Gonzaga 
came into the game as the nation's leading 3-point shooting team, but made only 
1 of 10 shots. The closest Gonzaga got in the second half was 46-42 with 9:38 
left, but USF then had a 14-3 spurt over the next four minutes to gain a 
15-point lead and put the game out of reach. Santa Clara 72, Portland 65 -- 
Jens Gordon scored 24 points and had 10 rebounds to lead the Broncos past the 
Pilots at Santa Clara. Santa Clara (15-6, 4-4) scored the first 16 points and 
led, 34-27, at halftime. Portland (1-20, 1-7) cut the lead to 5 points with 
14:38 left on a layup by Josh Lowery. The Broncos extended the lead to 11 
points with 9:08 remaining on a layup by Jeffty Connelly. The Pilots never got 
closer than 5 points. The victory was the 300th for Santa Clara Coach Carroll 
Williams. Lowery was the leading scorer for Portland with 25 points.

The No. 1 jinx hit Oklahoma Saturday as the Sooners, in only their second game 
as the nation's top-ranked team, lost to Big Eight rival Oklahoma State, 77-73, 
at Stillwater, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
The Cowboys outrebounded Oklahoma, 55-43, outshot the Sooners, 43% to 39%, and 
blocked a Big Eight-record 16 shots compared to 5 for Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma follows Duke and Illinois as the latest team to lose after being No. 
1. The Sooners (18-3 overall, 5-1 in the Big Eight) moved up from No. 4 last 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"They did an outstanding job today," Sooner Coach Billy Tubbs said of the 
Cowboys. "They're physically as good as anybody we've played this year." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Dumas led the Cowboys (13-6, 4-2) with 19 points and 13 rebounds. 
Thomas Jordan added 15 points and 10 rebounds, and Byron Houston had 11 points 
and 12 rebounds. Jordan had 7 blocks, Houston had 6 and Dumas 3. 
</P>
<P>
"The big difference in the game, and to their credit, is they just beat us on 
the boards," said Tubbs. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma State didn't clinch the victory until freshman Darwyn Alexander made 2 
free throws with 22 seconds left for the final points. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Martin, who scored 22 points, gave Oklahoma a 73-72 lead on a basket with 
2:50 left. Houston, also a freshman, tied the score with a free throw 13 
seconds later. 
</P>
<P>
After Oklahoma's Terrence Mullins missed the front end of a one-and-one with 
2:14 left, Houston scored to make it 75-73 with 1:35 left. 
</P>
<P>
Mookie Blaylock had a chance to tie the score with 1:22 remaining, but he also 
missed on the first of a one-and-one. Jordan missed a jumper at the other end, 
but Dumas got the offensive rebound and passed to Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
Sooner center Stacy King scored 18 points, 6 below his average, and had only 4 
points in the final 18 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Missouri 73, Kansas State 68 -- Gary Leonard's 22 points helped the No. 5 
Tigers withstand a rally by the Wildcats in the Big Eight game at Columbia, 
Mo., to become the first Division I team to win 20 games this season. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers (20-3, 6-0) have won 11 straight and are 15-1 since losing to North 
Carolina Dec. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Two free throws by Byron Irvin put Missouri ahead, 71-66, with 28 seconds left. 
After the Wildcats (12-6, 3-3) turned the ball over, Irvin was called for an 
offensive foul, and Steve Henson made both free throws to make it 71-68 with 9 
seconds remaining. Doug Smith clinched the victory by making 2 free throws with 
7 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Louisville 101, Memphis State 85 -- Kenny Payne scored 20 of his 28 points in 
the first half and Felton Spencer took charge down the stretch to lead the No. 
7 Cardinals to the Metro Conference victory at Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals (16-3, 5-0) appeared in control after Payne led them to a 50-32 
halftime lead, but had to survive two Tiger rallies. 
</P>
<P>
Memphis State (14-8, 3-3) outscored Louisville, 13-0, at the start of the 
second half to cut the Cardinal lead to 50-45 and pulled to within 82-73 with 
5:05 left with a 10-0 run. 
</P>
<P>
Payne's basket early in the second half increased the lead to 56-49. Spencer, 
who finished with 22 points, scored 8 straight points later in the half to give 
the Cardinals a 90-75 lead with 3:23 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Florida State 66, Cincinnati 65 -- Tat Hunter's tip-in with 2 seconds left 
capped a rally that erased a 13-point deficit in the final 9 minutes and gave 
the No. 8 Seminoles the Metro Conference victory at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
Andre Tate scored 15 points in the first 10 minutes of the second half to give 
the Bearcats a 54-41 lead with 9:10 remaining. Florida State (17-2, 5-1) went 
on a 16-7 run to close to 61-57 with 3 minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
George McCloud made 2 baskets to give Florida State its first lead of the 
second half, 64-63, with 1:02 remaining. But Elnardo Givens' jumper put 
Cincinnati (10-8, 1-4) ahead with 20 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Seton Hall 105, Boston College 82 -- The No. 10 Pirates used their height 
advantage and accurate free- throw shooting to beat the Eagles in the Big East 
game at Newton, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Seton Hall (19-3, 6-3) made 33 of 40 foul shots, and Boston College was 15 for 
24 in getting its sixth straight loss. The Eagles (8-10, 1-7), beaten at home 
by Seton Hall for the first time since 1970, were forced to shoot from outside 
much of the time, and made only 9 of 28 from 3-point range. 
</P>
<P>
John Morton scored 20 points for the Pirates, who outrebounded the Eagles, 
49-28. Dana Barros, who extended his 3-point streak to 59 games, led the Eagles 
with 28 points. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan 82, Michigan State 66 -- Glen Rice scored 8 of his 29 points during a 
16-4 run late in the second half, and the No. 11 Wolverines overcame a 6-point 
halftime deficit to down the Spartans in a Big Ten game at Ann Arbor, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
The Spartans (12-7, 3-6) led, 31-25, at halftime, but Michigan (17-4, 5-3), 
with Terry Mills scoring 7 of his 17 points, went on a 15-8 run to take its 
first lead, 40-39, on a hook by Loy Vaught with 14:16 left. A 3-pointer by 
Michigan State's Kirk Manns tied it, 48-48, with 10:03 left when Michigan made 
its big run. 
</P>
<P>
Vaught made 2 free throws and Rumeal Robinson drove the length of the floor for 
a layup to start the run and Rice continued it with his 8 points, including a 
dunk on an alley-oop pass from Robinson to give the Wolverines a 64-52 lead 
with 5:20 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana 66, Minnesota 62 -- The No. 17 Hoosiers, whose final 6 points came on 
free throws, rallied from a 14-point deficit in the second half to get past the 
Gophers in a Big Ten game at Bloomington, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Edwards and Joe Hillman, who scored 14 of his 20 points in the second half, 
each made 2 foul shots to give Indiana (18-5, 8-1) a 64-59 lead. 
</P>
<P>
A 3-point basket by Kevin Lynch cut the lead to 2 points with a minute left. 
The Gophers had a chance to tie, but Melvin Newbern missed a shot, and Edwards 
was fouled. He made the final 2 free throws for a 4-point lead with 28 seconds 
to go. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota (12-7, 4-5) remained winless on the road in the Big Ten and lost to 
Indiana for the 14th straight time. 
</P>
<P>
DePaul 81, North Carolina State 74 -- Stephen Howard and Stanley Brundy each 
scored 19 points and the Blue Demons pulled away early in the second half to 
knock off the No. 13 Wolfpack at Rosemont, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
The loss was the second straight for the Wolfpack (14-4). It was the first win 
over a ranked team for DePaul (14-9) after 6 straight losses. 
</P>
<P>
DePaul led, 60-56, with 5 minutes left when Brad Niemann made two 3-pointers 
and Chucky Brown made 2 free throws to give the Wolfpack a 64-60 lead. Howard 
scored 6 points down the stretch to clinch the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse 103, Pittsburgh 80 -- Stephen Thompson, who missed only 1 shot from 
the field, scored 29 points, and Sherman Douglas had 25 points and 11 assists 
as the No. 14 Orangemen routed the Panthers in a Big East game at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, who made 14 of 15 shots, scored 11 points -- including 4 baskets on 
feeds from Douglas -- as the Orangemen (19-4, 5-4) ran away from Pitt (11-9, 
4-5) with a 22-5 run in the final 6 minutes of the first half to break open a 
tight game. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, who was only 1 of 5 from the free-throw line, made consecutive layups 
off Douglas assists to give Syracuse the lead for good, 34-31, during a rally 
that included runs of 8-0 and 12-0. 
</P>
<P>
Mississippi State 96, Louisiana State 79 -- The Bulldogs ended a 6-game losing 
streak by beating the No. 19 Tigers for the fourth straight time over the last 
2 seasons in the Southeastern Conference game at Starkville, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
Mississippi State (9-10, 3-10), which trailed by 9 points late in the first 
half, broke open the game with a 22-8 run midway through the second half to 
take a 71-61 lead with 8:03 left. LSU (15-6, 7-3) never got closer than 8 
points after that. 
</P>
<P>
Reserve guard Greg Boykin, who finished with 16 points, had 8 points in the run 
and Greg Lockhart, who scored 24, had 6. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman guard Chris Jackson, the nation's No. 2 scorer, led LSU with 23, but 
had only 4 points in the second half until the final 4:20. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Tech 107, Southern Mississippi 92 -- Bimbo Coles scored 42 points to 
help the Hokies beat the Golden Eagles and snap a 4-game losing streak in the 
Metro Conference game at Blacksburg, Va. 
</P>
<P>
Coles scored 6 points in a 12-4 run in the opening 3:39 of the second half that 
gave the Hokies a 62-49 lead. They took their biggest lead of the game, 94-71, 
with 5:11 left on a steal and dunk by Coles that capped a 14-5 run. 
</P>
<P>
But Southern Mississippi (7-10, 2-4) responded with a 13-0 run and pulled to 
within 94-84. Coles scored 8 points down the stretch as Virginia Tech (8-12, 
1-5) pulled away. 
</P>
<P>
The Hokies also got 18 points from Wally Lancaster, who continued his NCAA 
record streak by making at least one 3-point basket in 65 consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Tech 87, Maryland 74 -- Tom Hammonds scored 9 of his 31 points during a 
22-7 run early in the second half that helped the Yellow Jackets defeat the 
Terrapins in the Atlantic Coast Conference game at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Tech was leading, 46-42, when former St. Bernard High star David 
Whitmore started the run 3 minutes into the second half. Maurice Brittian 
capped it with 2 free throws 10 minutes later as the Yellow Jackets (14-6, 4-2) 
built a 68-49 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman Jerrod Mustaf scored 24 points for the Terrapins (7-13, 0-7), who have 
lost 10 of their last 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
Nebraska 74, Kansas 70 -- Clifford Scales made a key last-minute 3-point play 
to help the Cornhuskers win their first Big Eight game of the season at 
Lincoln, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
Nebraska (13-9, 1-5) had a 39-23 halftime lead, but Kansas (16-6, 3-4), behind 
the strong second-half play of Milt Newton and Mike Maddox, tied the score, 
66-66, with 1:32 left. 
</P>
<P>
After each team made a free throw, Scales drove for a the basket and was 
fouled. He made the free throw to give the Cornhuskers a 70-67 lead. Ray 
Richardson and Eric Johnson each made 2 free throws in the final minute to 
clinch the victory.

TAR HEELS TAKE THEIR LUMPS, BUT THEY KEEP ROLLING ALONG

<P>
For Dean Smith, the curse has become a blessing. For North Carolina, the run of 
bad luck has turned into a windfall of pleasant surprises. 
</P>
<P>
Three months ago, when his best player was scratched with a stress fracture, 
Smith talked of survival for the Tar Heels. Now, at the halfway point of the 
Atlantic Coast Conference season, he could dare to talk about destiny, if he so 
desired. 
</P>
<P>
Ranked third in the country, tied for first in the ACC, the Tar Heels (18-3) 
appear poised to make a postseason charge all the way to Seattle and the Final 
Four. Just ask Georgia Tech's Bobby Cremins. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought a month ago they were the best team in the country," Cremins said 
recently during the ACC's weekly conference call. "They're an excellent club. 
J.R. Reid is playing great. So is Scott Williams. They've got a lot of pieces. 
King Rice is an important part of that. They're playing with confidence and 
shooting the ball well. 
</P>
<P>
"They came within a game of going to the Final Four last year. I think they're 
capable, they've got to get the right breaks, but they're capable of going all 
the way. No question they can play with anybody in the country. They're tough, 
really tough." 
</P>
<P>
When Reid suffered a stress fracture of his left foot that required surgery 
last October, Smith worried about his team's chemistry. Then the Tar Heels went 
out and won eight of nine games before their 6-foot-9 All-American forward 
returned in mid-December. 
</P>
<P>
Next, they lost Williams to a sprained ankle in late December. The 6-10 center 
missed two games and all but eight minutes of another. The Heels won all three. 
Then point guard Jeff Lebo suffered a severely sprained ankle in a mid-January 
loss to Virginia. With Rice at the point, the Heels went 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of being decimated, they became a team with no irreplaceable parts. 
They have both quality and quantity in an awesome front line. And now they have 
supplanted Duke as the ACC team that could go the furthest come tournament 
time. 
</P>
<P>
It's the year of the manager in the ACC. First, North Carolina State suited up 
team manager Roland Whitley, a 5-11 freshman guard who never played high school 
basketball, to alleviate a player shortage. Then on Sunday, after Clemson Coach 
Cliff Ellis suspended seven players for violating team rules, he gave a uniform 
to freshman manager Dennis Hopf to fill out a depleted roster. 
</P>
<P>
When Hopf entered a 92-62 loss at Duke in the final two minutes, he received a 
big hand from Duke's notoriously irreverent fans. "I thought our students were 
fantastic about it," Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski said. "They cheered when he 
shot. It was a neat couple of minutes when everybody forgot about wins and 
losses. It was a neat experience." 
</P>
<P>
Hopf, who averaged 16 points as a high school senior in Clarkston, Ga., last 
year, was in long enough to get off an airball and to draw a walking violation. 
"I'm glad it wasn't 'Hoosiers' and they were close enough to win," Krzyzewski 
said. "When I saw him in warmups, I thought this would be a hell of a thing, 
for them to be close enough and him come into the game." 
</P>
<P>
Hopf was named player of the day on CNN Sports Sunday night, and Ellis said 
there might even be an encore performance down the road. 
</P>
<P>
Whitley has had a degree of success, meanwhile, with the Wolfpack. He has 
played in seven games, including Sunday's rout of Maryland, for a total of 18 
minutes. He has scored six points, going 4 for 4 at the foul line. 
Unfortunately, he failed his biggest assignment when he was sent in to take a 
foul at the end of a game against SMU. 
</P>
<P>
Yet North Carolina State Coach Jim Valvano isn't about to complain, especially 
considering how much trouble he's had with one of Whitley's predecessors. A 
former Wolfpack student manager, John Simonds Jr., is one of the principal 
sources for the as-yet-unpublished book, "Personal Fouls," which makes 
allegations about cheating in Valvano's program. 
</P>
<P>
After playing the 9:30 p.m. game on an ESPN doubleheader three times in the 
last four weeks, Indiana Coach Bob Knight said it wouldn't happen again. 
Monday's 104-89 victory over Iowa would be the last late night appearance for 
the Hoosiers, he promised. "We don't need this," he said. "It's ridiculous to 
be here at this hour." 
</P>
<P>
The Big Ten shares ESPN's Monday night spotlight with the Big East, which gets 
the early game. Not all Big Ten coaches share Knight's view, however. 
</P>
<P>
"It depends in what chair you're sitting," said Purdue's Gene Keady. "If you've 
won three national titles, you're not concerned. But the rest of us will take 
any recognition we can get." 
</P>
<P>
Michigan State's Jud Heathcote said he'd like to see every school on ESPN twice 
a year. Then, in afterthought, he said, "If Bobby doesn't want it, we'll take 
his spot." 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Sutton, whose coaching future at Kentucky is uncertain pending the 
outcome of an NCAA investigation of 18 allegations of wrongdoing, said he'd 
consider jumping to the NBA or finding another college job if he were fired. He 
also is threatening to write a book about the behind-the-scenes maneuvers at 
Kentucky in the wake of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Sutton's attorney, Terry McBrayer, played down the book idea, however. "He's 
not much of a kiss-and-tell kind of guy. He's more interested in coaching -- 
here," said McBrayer. 
</P>
<P>
The 10 players who bolted from the San Jose State basketball team in protest 
over the coaching methods of Bill Berry are paying San Francisco lawyer Melvin 
Belli $200 apiece to represent them. Belli already has labeled Berry "a regular 
Hitler." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, no fewer than five teams held the No. 1 ranking at various times 
(Syracuse, North Carolina, Kentucky, Arizona and Temple), but only Arizona 
reached the Final Four.

PATTERSON RESIGNS AT ARIZONA ST.

Arizona State basketball Coach Steve Patterson, whose coaching ability has been 
severely criticized by the media recently, resigned Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Patterson, 40, announced his resignation just 1 hour before the Sun Devils 
played California in a Pacific 10 Conference game. Patterson, who was in his 
fourth season, had a 48-57 record. This season, the Sun Devils were 10-9 
overall and 3-7 in the conference and had lost 7 of their past 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona State Athletic Director Charles Harris said that assistant coach Bob 
Schermerhorn will take over on an interim basis for the rest of this season and 
that the school will begin searching for a new coach. 
</P>
<P>
Schermerhorn, 44, a second-year assistant at Arizona State, was 68-42 in 4 
seasons as coach at Southern Utah State. 
</P>
<P>
He lost in his debut Saturday as Leonard Taylor scored 20 points and Keith 
Smith added 16 to lead California to a 73-63 win. 
</P>
<P>
Columnists for three of the state's largest newspapers criticized Patterson in 
the past week, and all said the program needed to go in a different direction 
with a different coach. 
</P>
<P>
However, at his weekly news conference Tuesday, Patterson said his job seemed 
secure and he had Harris' support. He said Saturday that the decision to resign 
was his own and was reached "just in the last 24 hours." 
</P>
<P>
Patterson, who was a center at UCLA from 1969-71, has a bachelor's degree in 
physical education from Sonoma State. He was a Sun Devil assistant when he was 
named head coach on Aug. 15, 1985, taking over for Bob Weinhauer, who was fired 
after going 44-45 in 3 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Patterson's only previous head-coaching experience was one season at Santa Rosa 
(Calif.) College in 1983-84. 
</P>
<P>
In his first season, Patterson led Arizona State to a 14-14 record, 8-10 in the 
Pac-10. The Sun Devils were 11-17, 6-12 in 1986-87 and 13-16, 6-12 last season. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA placed the program on probation for 1 year in January, 1986, for 
various violations during Weinhauer's tenure. 
</P>
<P>
"When I took over this program, it was a tough job." Patterson said. "It was 
almost a no-win situation. I believe I've brought a sense of stability, both 
athletic and academic."

LEFTY DRIESELL IS BACK DOING WHAT HE DOES BEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEN DENLINGER, The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In about every way possible, Lefty Driesell is back. He's back coaching, two 
years after being forced out at Maryland; he's back building a home, and 
rebuilding a team at an obscure basketball school; he's back in the area for 
two games this week, beginning Wednesday night at Navy. 
</P>
<P>
As he eventually did at Davidson, as he quickly did at Maryland, the Lefthander 
has James Madison aflutter with anticipation. Three terrific teams did the 
school proud several years ago but few beyond the campus gave much notice; the 
new coach, with his fresh start, brings national attention simply by being 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
To some, Driesell is seen as a sad figure forced to salvage a reputation at a 
fairly advanced age (57) in a second-level conference. History would have been 
very kind to him, with that 70-plus winning percentage in 748 games, had he 
stayed inactive. Also, each time Maryland retreats under Bob Wade, Driesell's 
tarnished image gets cleaner. 
</P>
<P>
To many (me included), Driesell's step was just short of noble, assuming he 
still cares deeply about athletics and athletes and brings to this job the 
intensity and integrity he did at Davidson and most of his years at Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
Driesell is "having fun," he said over the phone the other day, "with a great 
bunch of kids who have exceeded expectations." Reality could be sweet, that 3-4 
record in the Colonial Athletic Association something special had fate been 
more helpful and the foul shooting not so crooked. Two of those CAA losses were 
in overtime, the others by a total of seven points. 
</P>
<P>
Because he delivered so grandly at Davidson and so soon at Maryland, Driesell 
is supposed to boost James Madison into a conference champion and top-25 
contender nationally in another couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
JMU's immediate future has names. Two of them are William Davis, a freshman 
guard averaging about 15 points per game, and Jeff Chambers, a 6-foot-8 recruit 
from Maryland's Eastern Shore about whom Driesell gushes: "He'll be a super 
player." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for Driesell, times are not the same these days in college 
basketball as they were when he was lifting Davidson, in the early '60s, and 
Maryland, in the early '70s. New rules, many of them very good, conspire 
against underdog programs such as JMU's. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was at Davidson," he said, "I could see a kid any time I wanted. Take 
him out to eat. Get to know him. It was a pain (because of so much travel), but 
a way to get to know a kid personally and for him and his parents to get to 
know me. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd get a Fred Hetzel (from the Washington area) by shooting around with him. 
By taking his parents to dinner. By being around enough to get him to say: 'Why 
don't I sign with this guy?' ;; 
</P>
<P>
Those were the days when a workaholic such as Driesell could rise to the top 
almost on sheer energy. A former assistant at Boston College, for instance, saw 
a prospect two dozen times -- and never offered him a scholarship; Moses Malone 
and some other high school sensations visited so many colleges they became 
known as "America's Guests." 
</P>
<P>
Then came reform. Too much change, naturally enough, to suit Driesell in his 
present position. Too many restrictions, on the recruiters and on those being 
recruited. 
</P>
<P>
"I can only watch a player at certain times," Driesell said. "Some of those 
times I can't even speak to him, or to his parents sitting in the stands. I can 
visit only so many times in the home. 
</P>
<P>
"I can only have 15 kids (per season) visit campus. My first year at Maryland 
there were something like 40 visits. People were curious. I only have seven 
visits left; I have three or four scholarships left. Which means I've got to 
sign one kid for every two that visits." 
</P>
<P>
Another quirk in recruiting is this: If JMU signee Chambers wants to watch JMU 
play at Navy Wednesday night, he must buy a ticket. Or Navy must be the team to 
leave him a freebie. 
</P>
<P>
"I told (Navy Coach) Pete Herrmann if he left one (for Chambers), I'd do the 
same when he signed somebody (close to JMU)," Driesell said. 
</P>
<P>
To become nationally prominent, James Madison must attract at least a few of 
the players who might otherwise gravitate to one of the traditional powers. Or 
do a superior job of coaching overlooked prospects with potential. 
</P>
<P>
Intense basketball watchers know that Driesell at JMU actually has a fairly 
tough act to emulate, if not immediately follow. Before leaving for California 
after the 1985 season, Lou Campanelli had a string of NCAA tournament teams. 
One beat Georgetown (in 1981); another lost to eventual-champion North Carolina 
(in 1982). 
</P>
<P>
That plays on Driesell's mind. Knowing at least three terrific players will 
come flying ontothe scene next season is a comfort. Still, he recalls JMU's 
strong, though mostly ignored, performance in the early '80s and says, quietly: 
"So we have to get back there."

POLL SHOWS THE PARITY IN COLLEGE BASKETBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM O'CONNELL, Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The lastest AP college basketball poll caused quite a stir throughout the 
country. It furthered the claims of parity throughout the sport and also 
allowed many more people to claim their team was No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma became just the third team to actually hold the lofty ranking this 
season but two more had a chance for it last weekend and six were listed atop 
at least one ballot in the 66 cast by the nationwide panel of sportswriters and 
broadcasters. 
</P>
<P>
Duke was picked No. 1 in the preseason poll and the Blue Devils held that spot 
for nine straight weeks before suffering three straight losses and dropping to 
the more crowded air of the Second Ten. 
</P>
<P>
"I personally thought there were 10, 12, 20 teams that deserved to be ranked 
that high but we were ranked that high and we had to deal with that for a 
couple of months," Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski said. 
</P>
<P>
"Overall, I think it was good for our school and our program. But as far as the 
development of our team it hurt us in that we didn't really understand how hard 
we would have to play defense to be very successful and we were a different 
team than we were last year. These past two weeks have been eyeopeners for us." 
</P>
<P>
At least Krzyzewski was in the high rent district long enough to have enjoyed 
the view and get used to the air. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois followed Duke into the No. 1 spot. It was the Fighting Illini's first 
week there in 37 years and then they lost to DePaul four days later and didn't 
return until this season. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota was the 1989 nemisis, beating Illinois just four days after it 
assumed the No. 1 spot. Even a victory over Indiana that snapped the Hoosiers' 
13-game winning streak wasn't enough to keep the Fighting Illini from dropping 
to No. 2 behind the Sooners. 
</P>
<P>
As with Ferry's back injury, Illinois could point to the loss of starting guard 
Kendall Gill to a broken foot as a reason No. 1 was hard to keep. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope they at least have enjoyed it for one day," Henson said on the day 
Illinois assumed the top spot and the day Gill's broken metarsal was confirmed 
through X-rays. "Starting today, they won't have time to think about it because 
we have other things to do." 
</P>
<P>
When told his second-ranked team missed a chance to take over the top spot 
following a loss to LSU, Georgetown Coach John Thompson said: "Do you remember 
who was No. 1 last January? Nobody does but everyone remembers who was in the 
Final Four." 
</P>
<P>
Louisville was next in line for a crack at No. 1, but the Cardinals were 
defeated at home by Ohio State. In the first half of the game, the Louisville 
lost leading scorer Pervis Ellison. 
</P>
<P>
Billy Tubbs is altogether different in how he treats the No. 1 billing. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma followed the Cardinals in the poll and the Sooners used an impressive 
victory at Nevada Las Vegas to jump three places and become No. 1 for the first 
time in the school's basketball history. 
</P>
<P>
After his first game with a No. 1-ranked team, a 90-82 road victory over Kansas 
State, Tubbs started to sound like many other No. 1 coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure I ever thought about being number one during the game at all," he 
said Wednesday night. "That was exciting for us till about two p.m. Monday. I 
don't think our players or our staff really thought much about it. We knew we 
had business to take care of, so we just let it go at that."

Not even the Miami Heat has lost as many consecutive games as the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers' spiral continued Saturday night as Chris Mullin scored 24 points 
to lead the Golden State Warriors to a 116-107 victory. It was the Clippers' 
18th straight loss. 
</P>
<P>
Winston Garland, Terry Teagle and Mitch Richmond scored 18 points each and 
Larry Smith had 16 rebounds for the Warriors, who got their eighth straight 
home victory. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Norman scored 28 points for the Clippers (10-35), who surpassed Miami's 
previous National Basketball Assn. season high of 17 consecutive defeats. They 
are one shy of the franchise record and two short of the league single-season 
record set by the Philadelphia 76ers in 1972-73. 
</P>
<P>
Quintin Dailey, the Clippers' leading scorer, hit his head on the court with 
10:39 left in the second quarter and left the game with a mild concussion. 
Teammate Tom Garrick left early in the fourth quarter with a sprained ankle. 
</P>
<P>
Manute Bol came off the bench to block three shots and made a 3-pointer from 
the top of the key as the Warriors began to pull away during a 38-point second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Mullin scored 12 points in that period as Golden State built a 60-49 lead with 
2:18 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
Otis Smith's two free throws with eight seconds left gave Golden State its 
largest first-half lead at 66-53 before Norm Nixon made a 3-pointer with one 
second remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Norman scored 11 points in the third quarter, and the Warriors led 94-83 at the 
start of the fourth quarter.

The University of Kentucky, responding to National Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
allegations against its basketball program, will accept responsibility for a 
package of money that allegedly was sent to the father of recruit Chris Mills 
of Los Angeles' Fairfax High, the Lexington Herald-Leader reported. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also said that Kentucky will take responsibility for charges of 
academic fraud involving another basketball player, Eric Manuel. The 
Herald-Leader said its information came from two sources who requested 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
A package containing $1,000 reportedly was sent to Claud Mills last March. It 
came unsealed in transit, and several Emery Air Freight employees said they 
found money inside, prompting the NCAA allegation.

JILL TRENARY FAVORED IN U.S. FIGURE SKATING (- 5P8)

<P>
It's time to get serious, real serious, for Jill Trenary. 
</P>
<P>
Trenary, the 1987 national champion, barely missed a medal at the Calgary 
Olympics, finishing fourth. 
</P>
<P>
With all three medalists gone professional, Trenary not only is the top-rated 
American woman figure skater, but in line for the world championship, as well. 
</P>
<P>
This week, Trenary goes after her second crown in the U.S. Figure Skating 
Championships -- she also finished second to Debi Thomas in the 1988 nationals 
and was fifth in the worlds. 
</P>
<P>
"I know what it feels like to win and, obviously, I would love to win that 
back," says Trenary, 20, of Colorado Springs, Colo., who trains with 
world-renown coach Carlo Fassi. "I skated well at nationals last year, too. It 
just happens that Debi just edged me out a little bit. That was fine. That's 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
"Being that I did come in second last year, it would make winning all the more 
exciting this year." 
</P>
<P>
And expected. While the men's competition has no overwhelming favorite, Trenary 
clearly is the frontrunner among the women, who get started with the compulsory 
figures on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel it already," she says. "It's going to be a little more intense, a 
little bit more work. But I'm smart to recognize that and I'm ready. know what 
to expect, and if I know it and am prepared for it, I can just skate. I don't 
have to open a newspaper if I don't want." 
</P>
<P>
If she does some reading, she'll know that Caryn Kadavy, third in the last two 
nationals, is sidelined by a stress fracture of the left ankle. Jeri Campbell, 
fourth in the '88 nationals, also has a sprained ankle. 
</P>
<P>
The toughest competition could come from Kristi Yamaguchi, who began her season 
with a strong second place in Tokyo. Trenary calls Yamaguchi "technically very 
strong" and expects a "tough challenge from her." 
</P>
<P>
Yamaguchi also skates pairs with Rudi Galindo, with whom she won the world 
junior title in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Galindo also skates singles but shouldn't be a factor. The key to the men's 
competition could be Chris Bowman's leg injury. 
</P>
<P>
Bowman suffered a gash of his left ankle while performing a comical routine in 
an exhibition Dec. 1. The cut needed four layers of stitches and, according to 
Frank Carroll, Bowman's coach, the 21-year-old Californian's condition is 
"uncertain." 
</P>
<P>
"It was a serious injury, on the inside and outside of the ankle," Carroll 
says. "There was some muscle damage. 
</P>
<P>
"He hasn't had a lot of work -- Chris also had a pulled groin muscle. But he's 
been skating recently." 
</P>
<P>
Bowman was edged for second place in the nationals a year ago by Paul Wylie of 
Denver. Wylie won the Lalique Trophy in Paris last November but is not as 
spectacular a free skater as Bowman. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of like comparing apples and oranges," Wylie says. "Chris has one 
extra trick, but I have a program that I think is more moving than his. This is 
the brass tacks, the long-program analysis, because it's going to come down to 
the long program." 
</P>
<P>
If it does, Bowman might have an ace in the hole, a triple axel. 
</P>
<P>
"I hit it at Skate America and that was a big step for me," says Bowman, 21, of 
Los Angeles. "But I also might have focused too much on it; some of the later 
jumps were difficult because, by then, my mind was out in the parking lot." 
</P>
<P>
The men's battle could be spiced by former world junior champion Todd Eldredge, 
who also has been sidelined by physical probems. Eldredge has bruised cartilage 
in the back. 
</P>
<P>
Back problems forced Scott Gregory to retire and his ice dance partner, Suzanne 
Semanick, found a new sidekick in Ron Kravette. Semanick-Gregory had won the 
last two U.S. crowns, but Semanick-Kravette are considered longshots in the 
dance, where significant movement in the standings is unusual. 
</P>
<P>
The dance favorites are Susan Wynne and Joe Druar, who were runners-up in the 
'88 nationals. 
</P>
<P>
"We were just happy to make the Olympics," Wynne says of 1988. "Eveybody was 
asking us, 'Aren't you mad you weren't first?' I thought, 'We're in the 
Olympics. It's OK.' 
</P>
<P>
"This year, it's just as nerve-racking for us. This year, it's first place, 
just like last year it was the Olympics as a goal. If we come in second this 
year, we wouldn't be happy." 
</P>
<P>
April Sargent and Russ Witherby are the main challengers. 
</P>
<P>
In pairs, with Olympic bronze medalists Jill Watson and Peter Oppegard now 
professionals, 1986 national champs Gillian Wachsman and Todd Waggoner figured 
to move up. But they returned to school, leaving Olympians Kim and Wayne 
Seybold as the top duo. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we're the top-ranked team in the United States and we want to come 
here and prove that and win a gold medal," Wayne said. "We've been skating 
together 16 years and we've been junior national champions, we've been on the 
world team, the Olympic team, we've been second, third, fourth, fifth and ninth 
at senior nationals. We've won international competitions and things, but the 
one thing that's eluded us is the national championship. That's what this year 
is all about."

NEWSWIRE: GATAULLIN VAULTS INDOOR-RECORD 19-9 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Radion Gataullin broke his world indoor pole-vault record Saturday, clearing 19 
feet 9 inches at the Soviet Union's Winter Championships at Gomel, the news 
agency Tass reported. 
</P>
<P>
Gataullin, a silver medalist in the 1988 Olympics, broke the record of 19-8 1/4 
he set Jan. 22 at Leningrad. 
</P>
<P>
Gataullin, a student from Tashkent in Uzbekistan who will compete in the 
Times/Eagle Indoor Games Feb. 17 at the Forum, is threatening countryman Sergei 
Bubka's reign as the world's No. 1 vaulter. 
</P>
<P>
Bubka, the 1988 Olympic champion and a two-time world champion, held the world 
indoor record of 19-7 before this season. He holds the outdoor record at 19-10 
1/2.

NISSAN HOLDS LEAD AS FOG HALTS DAYTONA RACE

<TEXT>
<P>
A heavy shroud of fog rolled in off the Atlantic Ocean early Sunday morning, 
forcing IMSA officials to red-flag the Daytona 24 Hours Camel GT sports car 
race to a temporary halt after 10 hours 11 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The stoppage came at 1:50 a.m. EST with Geoff Brabham, the defending Camel GT 
champion, leading in a Nissan GTP by two laps. 
</P>
<P>
The race clock continued during the red flag period, with the event still 
scheduled to conclude at 3:38 p.m. EST Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Brabham, an Australian-born driver taking part in his first 24-hour event and 
driving at night for the first time in a race, drove the Nissan into the lead 
at 11:40 p.m. EST. 
</P>
<P>
He built a 90-second lead over the Jaguar of Jan Lammers, Davy Jones and Raul 
Boesel during the next hour, but made a scheduled pit stop at 12:40 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Jones drove past in the Jaguar, retaking the lead that the car, last year's 
winner, had held several times earlier. But, one lap later, he pulled into the 
pits with an engine problem. 
</P>
<P>
The Nissan, shared by Chip Robinson and Arie Luyendyk of the Netherlands, moved 
back into the lead at the end of the 289th lap on the 3.56-mile Daytona 
International Speedway road circuit. 
</P>
<P>
The fog began to drift over the track shortly before midnight and quickly 
became thicker, cutting visibility to less than 100 yards. 
</P>
<P>
A caution flag came out at 1:12 a.m. because of a car stalled in a dangerous 
position in the infield. But, with the thickening fog, the pace car stayed on 
the track until officials finally decided to stop the field.

POCKLINGTON'S MOTTO IS NEVER SAY NEVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEN RAPPOPORT, Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Edmonton Oilers owner Peter Pocklington has received a lot of abuse from fans 
at home for trading Wayne Gretzky. But he says he doesn't blame them for being 
bitter. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if I'd ever forgive me (if he was a fan)," Pocklington said 
recently. "If I was a fan I don't think I'd forgive me. If I weren't me, I 
don't know if I'd trust me or not." 
</P>
<P>
All this came up in the midst of a rumor that Pocklington was considering 
selling goaltender Grant Fuhr. Pocklington denied the rumor, adding he would 
never sell another player again like he sold Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
"I never say never about anything, but Wayne Gretzky was once in a lifetime," 
Pocklington said. 
</P>
<P>
Edmonton Coach Glen Sather, responding to a recent report that the Oilers were 
having difficulty filling the stands since trading Gretzky: 
</P>
<P>
"We've had 97 and 98 per cent capacity. I'd have used 99, but we're not using 
that number any more." 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Hull, the legendary left wing, will become the second player in history 
to have his number retired by two teams. 
</P>
<P>
Hull, whose number has been retired by the Chicago Blackhawks, will be honored 
by the Winnipeg Jets in March. 
</P>
<P>
Gordie Howe's number has been retired by Detroit and Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, Hull and Howe both wore No. 9. 
</P>
<P>
Winnipeg center Dale Hawerchuk is trying be positive, even though the Jets have 
been struggling of late. 
</P>
<P>
After a recent 9-4 loss to Edmonton that was one of the low points of the 
season, Hawerchuk said things could be worse. 
</P>
<P>
How so? 
</P>
<P>
"The low point of the season is when there are a couple of games left and you 
haven't got enough games to catch up for the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
Who can Mario Lemieux thank for taking over Wayne Gretzky's spot as the NHL 
scoring leader? 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
According to Chicago Blackhawks coach Mike Keenan, the main reason for 
Lemieux's improvement in Pittsburgh the last two seasons is Gretzky. Keenan was 
their coach on the Canadian team in the 1987 Canada Cup. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope Mario has sent Wayne a thank-you note," Keenan says. "There's no 
question he wouldn't be the player today if not for playing with Wayne in the 
Canada Cup. "Wayne taught Mario everything he knew about hockey, then he went 
out and met all the challenges from Mario on the ice. Your top players learn 
from and desire challenges like that." 
</P>
<P>
When the Soviet Red Army hockey team was in Hartford for a recent tour, the 
players went to see the movie "Naked Gun." A scene in the film shows a 
lookalike of Mikhail Gorbachev being grabbed by a guy, who rubs off the 
distinctive birthmark on the Soviet leader's head. 
</P>
<P>
"I was afraid they wouldn't like it," said Mike Hume, who was the NHL liaison 
to the Soviet team. "But they were laughing so hard, they were holding their 
sides." 
</P>
<P>
The Red Army squad was unable to practice at Hartford's Civic Center, and the 
players had to skate in an old, cold arena in the suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
"It was as close to Siberia as we could get for them," Hartford coach Larry 
Pleau said. 
</P>
<P>
The NHL is taking a tougher stance on criticism of officials. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, the league sent a memo to the 21 teams advising non-playing personnel 
they could be fined for criticizing referees. The memo, from NHL lawyer Gil 
Stein, says even the "spirit and implication" of a coach's comments will be 
considered a breach of the rules. 
</P>
<P>
"Thus, for example, if a coach says to a reporter: 'I will say nothing about 
tonight's officiating because I don't want to be fined by the league,' he'll be 
fined." 
</P>
<P>
The writing may be on the wall for New York Islanders veteran center Bryan 
Trottier. The New York Islanders have told Trottier that his ice time will be 
reduced in favor of younger players. 
</P>
<P>
Trottier and his agent, Bob Thornton, talked to general manager Bill Torrey 
about the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"He does not want to be a part-time player," Thornton says. "If his ice time is 
cut considerably, he doesn't want too be here anymore." 
</P>
<P>
A stumbing block to dealing Trottier is his $700,000 salary.

NOT ALL THE PRO GOLFERS CHOOSE TO GUT IT OUT AT RIVIERA -- SEVERAL QUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH TOSCHES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Riviera Country Club course has just turned you upside down and shaken all 
the dignity from your body. It is raining hard; your shoes, pants cuffs and 
ears are rapidly filling with water and you have just turned in a horrible 
round of golf. 
</P>
<P>
Some pro golfers who found themselves in that situation at the Los Angeles Open 
did the only responsible thing. 
</P>
<P>
They quit. 
</P>
<P>
Technically, PGA Tour rules require that a player be injured or ill or have a 
dire personal problem such as a death in the family for them to withdraw from a 
tournament without risking a fine or other sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
In reality, it is a rule the PGA does not enforce. If a player wants out, he 
simply calls the tournament office, tells an official that he doesn't feel well 
and cannot continue, and he is excused. No questions. 
</P>
<P>
One of the first to head out Friday was Payne Stewart, who complained of a bad 
back. He shot a 76 on Thursday and was 6-over-par on Friday when rain halted 
the second round. 
</P>
<P>
Others who withdrew because of "illness" were David Edwards, Brad Fabel, Doug 
Tewell, Tony Sills and Mark McCumber. All except McCumber had shot 75 or 76 in 
the opening round and had little chance of making the 36-hole cut. 
</P>
<P>
McCumber shot rounds of 70 and 74 and entered the press tent Friday night to 
check the scores of other players. He decided that he would probably not make 
the cut, heard the weather report that called for continued rain and told 
writers he was getting on the next plane back to his home in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
"I can watch the last two rounds from home," he said. 
</P>
<P>
If he did, he would have seen that the cut was 3-over-par 145 and that he had 
earned a spot in the field for the final two rounds, the money rounds. 
</P>
<P>
The PGA officially listed his absence as, "Withdrew-illness," an illness 
seemingly brought on by walking in mud while wearing wet shoes and made worse 
by missing several easy putts. 
</P>
<P>
Sills was sick, also. He became sick when he discovered that he was 11-over-par 
with 5 holes to play early Saturday morning to complete his second round. 
</P>
<P>
Bailing out of a tournament is not a common practice on the tour, however. Ken 
Green, for example, bravely thrashed his way through two full rounds and missed 
the cut before packing up his bag and heading home to see his father, who had 
suffered a heart attack on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Byrum staggered to a round of 82 on Thursday and clearly was not going to 
make the cut. But he showed up at 7 a.m. Saturday and finished his second round 
in a pounding rain, knowing he needed a 63 to qualify. 
</P>
<P>
Morris Hatalsky, who had trouble in the rain on Saturday also and missed the 
cut, said there's no excuse for quitting. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very difficult out there today, and I know how those guys felt," he 
said. "What they do is their business. I did it once. I withdrew from the 
Tucson Open a few years ago because I had played badly in the first round and 
wanted to get home to see my son play in his soccer game. But I felt bad about 
it, and I don't condone it at all. 
</P>
<P>
"Even when things get miserable like this sometimes, we're supposed to play. We 
are professionals. Once you tee it up in a tournament, you've got to finish. 
You've got to play until they tell you that you can't play anymore." 
</P>
<P>
And sometimes, lowering their head into a howling, wet wind and continuing to 
tee it up pays off. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Tennyson, a 26-year-old pro from Evansville, Ind., who finished 108th on 
the money list last year, began the L.A. Open with a round of 76, the same as 
Stewart, Tewell and Sills. But he came back and shot an exceptional 69 and made 
the cut by one stroke. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps McCumber will see him today on television.

HE'S NOT THE BERNARD KING OF OLD, BUT THEN, HE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE LITTWIN, The Baltimore Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On occasion, Bernard King gets in these zones where he's very nearly impossible 
to stop, and the temptation to measure him by the old standard is fairly 
irresistible. But it's unfair. And King knows it's unfair. Which is how he 
stays not only sane, but also actually happy. 
</P>
<P>
He's happy being who he is -- a healthy, productive member of NBA society. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't compare performances," he says. "I don't compare myself from year to 
year. I just try to do as well as I can each time I play." 
</P>
<P>
That's a pretty standard quote (you can look it up in the athlete's handbook 
under "Ways to Deflect the Idly Curious"), and anyone might have said it. But 
for King, it's more or less an ethos. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't compare. He can't afford to. 
</P>
<P>
For once upon a time, King did set the standard for scoring forwards, scoring 
alternately in great bursts and in great bunches, slashing to the basket, 
burying the jumper and averaging as many as 33 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
You remember the back-to-back, 50-point games? George Gervin could score like 
that. And David Thompson. Now, of course, Michael Jordan can. These are the 
people, the on-court havoc makers, King could run with, until the tear in his 
right knee, on a March night in 1985, ground him to a stop. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't just any torn knee. It was the kind that tears at your heart, too, 
and might well ruin a career in the process. 
</P>
<P>
For King, there were two years of enforced absence from the game, two years of 
long days and nights spent in rehabilitation, two years of doubts that he could 
ever make it all the way back. 
</P>
<P>
And so, he doesn't compare. 
</P>
<P>
Why should he? He's a good to very good player. He makes $1 million a year. At 
age 32, he is the star of the lowly Washington Bullets and, if he no longer 
sets a standard, he is in the upper half of small forwards in the league. 
</P>
<P>
And that's plenty. It's more than plenty. 
</P>
<P>
Happy? You bet. He can live with the losing, though he'd prefer it to be 
otherwise. He says, as long as the effort is there, that's all he can ask. He 
can live with the slow torture of NBA life, and in fact plans to live with it 
as long as he can. It was not for nothing that he spent those two years. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in the Bullets' dressing room after a recent game, an ice pack strapped 
to each knee, King discussed his game (a 36-point effort) and his future. When 
someone asked the inevitable question ("How's the knee?"), he provided the 
usual answer ("Fine") and went on from there. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no problem with the knee any more," he said. "But I'm not going to 
tell you I can cut as quickly as I used to, or if I can't. I don't think about 
those things. I feel good, and I play." 
</P>
<P>
Not only that, he plays hard. It's a defining facet of his game, this 
determination to perform. He can be a hard person at times, and it's that 
hardness, one supposes, that gave him the strength to overcome an injury that 
should have been the end of Bernard King, basketball player. 
</P>
<P>
We shouldn't underestimate what he has done. Already 28 years old when the knee 
gave way, King could merely have accepted that bad luck is a part of the game 
of life. After all, he had options. Bright and attractive, he has acted in 
movies and on television and has even helped underwrite a play. 
</P>
<P>
There will be life after basketball for King. But he's in no rush to get there, 
basketball being what he does best. 
</P>
<P>
And yet, you can give away very little in the NBA when you're a 6-foot-7 small 
forward who must rely on quick feet to get your shot. At 32, King should be 
slowing down anyway, if only because knees are not meant to withstand the 
punishment of years spent pounding the hardwood. But he's not slowing down. No, 
he has these nights that, if you close your eyes, you can picture him back in 
the Garden playing the game as few people ever have. In this season, he's had 
back-to-back, 37-point nights. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, this season will be over, and King could be an unrestricted free agent, 
meaning he could sign with anyone, and the Bullets would not have the option to 
match the offer. Meaning, the Bullets should move quickly. 
</P>
<P>
On a team that has little enough to offer, the Bullets need King, if only as an 
example to their younger players of what intensity really means. They also need 
points, and King can still provide them. 
</P>
<P>
If there's the problem of glut at King's position (John Williams plays there, 
too), it's probably the least of the Bullets' many concerns. But does King 
still want the Bullets? He dodges the question of his future with a feint and a 
smile. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think about it," he says, not really expecting you to believe it. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I'm going to be playing, somewhere," he says. "So, I don't really have 
to think about it." 
</P>
<P>
He is reassured by the certainly that someone will want him and that he made it 
happen himself. By whatever measure you employ, he knows he can still play. A 
couple of years ago, King's future was the great unknown, and, if you want to 
compare moments, that's where the comparison is valid. Not so long ago, King 
didn't have a career; now, against all reason, he does.

TESTED HAND AT CLAIMING JOINS GAME IN MARYLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW BEYER, The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For trainers who deal with claiming horses, some of the toughest competition in 
the country has traditionally been found in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
The circuit has produced such brilliant practitioners of the claiming game as 
Bud Delp, Dick Dutrow and King Leatherbury. Their art requires not only the 
skills of a horseman but of a poker player, for it takes strategy, guts and 
bluffing ability to be a good wheeler-dealer with cheap horses. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, many capable horsemen have tried and failed to break into the 
game in Maryland. But now a formidable new player has joined the game, pushed a 
big stack of chips in front of him and declared that he is not going to be 
intimidated. 
</P>
<P>
"I was the king of New England years ago," said Bob Klesaris. "In New Jersey I 
was dominant for years. I don't fear moving to Maryland. I'll play the game as 
tough as anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Racing fans at all the tracks where Klesaris operates can attest that he is one 
of the most astute members of his profession. Virtually every horse he puts on 
the track deserves respect, and over the years he has won with one of every 
four horses he has saddled -- a remarkable record. 
</P>
<P>
Klesaris broke into the sport on the decrepit New England circuit, where it was 
relatively easy to become a dominant trainer. Six years ago he split his 
operation and sent a division to New Jersey, and found that he was able to 
operate effectively on two fronts. He started sending a segment of his stable 
to Florida during the winter. Then he moved his better horses to New York. 
</P>
<P>
"I hadn't been very familiar with Maryland racing, and I don't have a single 
Maryland-based owner," Klesaris said. "But the word is out about Maryland 
racing, and everybody is thinking about Maryland now, because the purse 
structure is so exceptional." 
</P>
<P>
Laurel's management had expected that the phenomenal increase in purse money 
would eventually improve the quality of the day-to-day competition, and 
Klesaris' arrival is evidence of the transformation that is occurring. The 
trainer said he will send between 15 and 20 horses to Laurel initially, assess 
the results, and then possibly send an even larger contingent. If his past 
performances are any guide, he will quickly take his place with Leatherbury, 
Ron Alfano and Dale Capuano as a major force in Maryland racing. 
</P>
<P>
Like Leatherbury -- a master of this game -- Klesaris frequently operates his 
stable by remote control, leaving the day-to-day care of the animals to his 
assistants while he concerns himself with claiming the right horses and 
entering them in the right spots. 
</P>
<P>
"I tape the races at all the tracks where I run and look for horses I think 
might be able to improve," Klesaris said. "Maybe I'll see a rider make a 
mistake, or see a speed horse they haven't tried to take off the pace. Then I 
pay a lot of attention to what the trainer is doing with a horse. Trainers have 
patterns, doing certain things with horses at a certain level." 
</P>
<P>
For example, Klesaris will know if another trainer habitually moves a horse up 
in class after a victory. If one of this trainer's horses wins and runs back at 
the same level -- or even drops in class -- Klesaris will know to suspect that 
something is wrong with the animal physically. 
</P>
<P>
Klesaris said he also pays careful attention to the relative strengths of 
different classes of horses at different tracks. If the $20,000 claiming filly 
sprinters at Laurel are an exceptionally strong lot, while fillies with the 
same price tag are relatively weak at Garden State, Klesaris wants to know it 
so he can claim such horses in Maryland and ship them to New Jersey. "I'll move 
and transfer my horses constantly."

BOXING, ONCE BANNED IN CHINA, COMING BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AP 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
BEIJING 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Down an alleyway, lined with ancient houses, in a gym with no heat as the winds 
of winter swirl outside, Liu Xingjun jumps rope and thinks about world 
heavyweight champion Mike Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
"He's my hero," the 18-year-old boxer said, steam and sweat pouring from his 
face. "I have his pictures all over my wall. I hope one day to be able to 
battle like him." 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, Wang Yawei slams his fists in a body bag. 
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old gave up a promising career as a kung-fu movie actor to fight 
fulltime. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just beginning to learn again how to box," Wang said. "I wanted to be 
part of the change." 
</P>
<P>
Banned for 27 years because of safety concerns and politics, boxing is making a 
comeback in the People's Republic of China. 
</P>
<P>
In cities along the eastern coast, where the sport always was popular, boxing 
clubs are springing up and putting on competitions. Spectators by the thousands 
throng to these three-round events, crunching on sunflower seeds and sipping 
soft drinks, as boxers from one factory or another vie for purses worth about 
$20. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time since the communist revolution in 1949, China sent a boxing 
team of two to the Summer Olympics last September in Seoul. One fighter was 
eliminated in his first match, while the other made it to the second round. 
</P>
<P>
Another team is readying for fights in Indonesia in mid-February. And a bigger 
group of fighters is looking forward to the Asia Games in 1990, to be held in 
Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
"But we still have far to go," said Wang Guojun, the 57-year-old coach of 
China's national team who once was the flyweight champion of China. "We don't 
have any guys who've been fighting all their lives. Just a bunch of late 
starters." 
</P>
<P>
Wang had his boxing career cut short in 1959 when the government banned the 
sport. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like waking up one morning and the golden horizon had disappeared," he 
said. "Everything was black." 
</P>
<P>
The chain-smoking coach pulled out a photograph from his days in the ring -- 
washboard stomach, arms like anvils. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at that," he said, sighing. "A pretty tough customer." 
</P>
<P>
For decades, boxing was popular in the coastal cities, a cultural import from 
Western imperialists who brought their sports as well as their products to 
China. 
</P>
<P>
After the revolution in 1949, boxing continued its popularity in cities such as 
Qingdao, Shanghai, Hangzhou and Canton. 
</P>
<P>
But a series of fighting accidents which left several Chinese boxers dead, and 
a push by the government to rid itself of "aggressive" influences from the 
West, led to boxing's demise. 
</P>
<P>
Wang took up soccer and hockey and began his wait. 
</P>
<P>
"But students, athletes, all sorts of people kept coming to see me, and we'd 
always go a few rounds," he said, doing a quick two-step while he cut the air 
with a right jab. "I always kept up hope that the ban would be lifted." 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Wang's dream came true and he was given the go-ahead to start a 
national team. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was part of China's push into the world of international sports to 
better its image and provide a source of national pride. Since 1980, Beijing's 
athletes have broken more than 100 world records and won more than 1,000 
titles. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, sports in China is the reserve of an athletic elite. Indoor 
swimming pools and wood basketball courts are off-limits to everyone but 
state-sponsored professional athletes. Gymnastic instruction is limited to 
those with a professional future. 
</P>
<P>
Most Chinese get their excercise working on farms while others get theirs going 
to and from work on bicycles. 
</P>
<P>
Wang's boxing team is no exception. Promising members are borrowed from 
factories and sports institutes and brought to Beijing to be tutored under 
Wang's watchful eye.

It's called home video because you take it home, right? That may be generally 
true, but for hundreds of thousands of Southern Californians -- mostly 
foreign-born -- the home in home video means homeland. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of going to the Wherehouse or 20/20 or Tower, these video fans head for 
Bombay Spices or VIP Video -- or one of scores of other Los Angeles and Orange 
County shops that carry tapes from overseas. 
</P>
<P>
You want videos from Japan, Korea, Armenia, Egypt, the Philippines, Thailand, 
France or Greece? You can get 'em, if you know where to look.

FRENCH HITS FOR LE CINEMA BUFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGG BARRIOS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One recent Saturday afternoon in West Los Angeles, three French-speaking kids 
held a heated discussion in Video France's children's section over whether to 
rent a French-dubbed version of Disney's "Alice Au Pays Des Merveilles" ("Alice 
in Wonderland") or "Cendrillon" ("Cinderella"). They finally settled on "Alice" 
along with two Spielberg classics, "Fievel et le Nouveau Monde" ("An American 
Tale") and "E.T., L'Extra Terrestre." 
</P>
<P>
While it isn't de rigeur to speak or understand French to browse through this 
store located near the West Side Pavilion, it's almost imperative that one 
appreciate le cinema Francais. After all, nearly half of this video store's 
1,500 titles are French movies without English subtitles. 
</P>
<P>
Originally an apartment building, the small store has a quaint, almost 
provincial exterior that is fresh and inviting. Inside, rental videos are 
displayed on open shelves in a large (900 sq. ft) room. Tapes are categorized 
into comedy, children, drama, and directors -- notably Francois Truffaut and 
Jean-Luc Godard. Smaller sections are devoted to a sizable number of Italian 
films and general interest videos on French art, cuisine, history and language 
study. 
</P>
<P>
At the checkout counter, Jacques Decottignies returned a Louis de Funes tape. 
De Funes' brand of comedy is virtually unknown to American filmgoers, but his 
films and other Gallic comedies are the store's biggest draw. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Decottignies and his wife scanned the shelves for more videos -- 
"nothing too profound" -- for a long weekend. "I like to keep up with my native 
culture." he said. "I was born and raised in France, but I've lived here for 20 
years. I prefer the classic Godard and Truffaut. We come here as often as every 
other week." 
</P>
<P>
Myriam Lemarchand, who usually rents two tapes on weekends, voiced a similar 
preference. "My family speaks French. My children are bilingual. We come here 
to get a fresh breath of Paris air, so to speak. It's convenient." She finds 
comedians De Funes and Fernandel a bit old hat -- preferring new comedies or 
dramas that star the new wave of actors like Gerard Depardieu. "He's good; I 
use him as a barometer." 
</P>
<P>
A video catalogue and a computer-based list keep Video France customers abreast 
of its 1,500 titles and newest additions including "Le Gran Chemin," "Tenue de 
Soiree (Menage)," "Jean de Florette" and its companion film, "Manon Des 
Sources/Manon of the Spring" -- all of which were in the Gallic store in 
French-only versions months before their English-subtitled release on domestic 
home video. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of our customers have different tastes," Bernard Decaillet, Video 
France's owner and manager, said. "Quite a number of people love Alain Delon, 
Jean Belmondo and Brigitte Bardot, so we have many titles on them. A national 
fan club for Bardot in Kansas City even sends members to our store." 
</P>
<P>
According to the Algerian-born Decaillet, his customers fall into distinct 
categories. "Sixty percent are a cross-section of French people. The rest are 
American: either Francophiles who barely speak French but like our style and 
culture or film buffs who are usually students from local universities." 
</P>
<P>
He mused about some unusual browsers, "mostly producers looking for French 
films that they can remake as American movies. In fact, 'The Fugitives,' which 
we currently stock, was never released in the States, so that it could be 
remade as an American film." (The Francis Veber comedy, retitled "Three 
Fugitives" and starring Nick Nolte and Martin Short, is in current release.) 
</P>
<P>
While most classic French titles are available, a few aren't. Marcel Carne's 
"Les Enfants du Paradis," Godard's "La Chinoise," and Robert Bresson's 
"Mouchette" are among the most requested missing gems. 
</P>
<P>
"These films may be available in France, but the French video recording system 
isn't compatible with the U.S. system. It makes importing them quite 
difficult," said Decaillet. Video France has licensed several hard-to-find 
titles through its own home video subsidiary. The store also offers a mail 
rental service for schools and colleges and isolated customers throughout the 
U.S. In a similar vein, Decaillet is planning to place French videomat machines 
in outlying areas of the Southland to lure potential customers. 
</P>
<P>
Videos rented were good, clean copies. Most surprising was a black-and-white De 
Funes comedy, "Duke of the Derby," which had a shadow-box format and subtitles 
below the picture. Others such as "Therese" and "Et La Tendresse? . . . 
Bordel!," a Video France release, weren't recorded in VHS-hi-fi. Beta copies 
are available on some titles. 
</P>
<P>
While some customers have requested hardcore X-rated French films, Decaillet 
doesn't carry them. "At present, we carry only the tamer erotic titles like the 
'Emmanuelle' series." (These titles are listed in a "private collection" 
catalogue, out of reach and sight of children.)

LITTLE SAIGON'S VIDEO KICKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Danh Pham is a tiny man with the slightly sour look of a hard-working 
businessman who doesn't have time for nosy strangers. Arms crossed, he listens 
as Tony Lam, restaurateur and man-about-town in Orange County's Little Saigon, 
asks him to enlighten a reporter about his small video rental business. 
</P>
<P>
After much talk in Vietnamese, Pham remains noncommittal, even suspicious, 
behind the counter of Danh's Video, his shop in a mini-mall off Garden Grove's 
Bolsa Avenue. Lam is emphatic, but Pham just watches his customers, who listen 
bemusedly to the negotiations. Only when a Vietnamese-American teen-ager with a 
pomaded horn of hair breaks into the conversation does Pham loosen a bit. 
</P>
<P>
The young man all but shouts: "Kung fu movies, they are the best!" Pham, along 
5with everybody else, laughs. 
</P>
<P>
Pham adds in thickly accented but precise English, "Yes, kung fu is very 
popular, very. Many of the young men come in for the fighting (movies), they go 
for the action. Not like the girls, who all the time want romance. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
With that, Lam shakes Pham's hand, and turns to the reporter: "He will help you 
now. He is willing to trust you." The exchange is reflective of the Vietnamese 
community and its wariness of the media and outsiders; it also underlines how 
something as seemingly innocuous as video-rental preferences can open a little 
window on that community's identity. 
</P>
<P>
Pham now moves casually up the aisles, pointing to a crowded row of movies 
starring a mix of Vietnamese, Chinese and Taiwanese actors. All are filmed in 
Taiwan or China, usually in Chinese and later dubbed into Vietnamese. On the 
opposite wall is a stack of major English-language releases. The shop's 
interior is covered with posters, most touting the Vietnamese tapes. They are 
common for the genre -- romantic melodramas with a beguiling hint of soft sex 
or sword-fighting adventures featuring a hero rising up against evil. 
</P>
<P>
Pham says video is important to many Vietnamese-Americans for the same reason 
it is important to everybody -- easily accessible and inexpensive entertainment 
to be enjoyed at home. But he also points out that their interest can be more 
complex than most. 
</P>
<P>
The dubbed tapes provide older Vietnamese with a nostalgic link to their 
homeland, a catalyst for inspiring joyful and painful memories of a country 
thousands were forced to flee more than 10 years ago. They are reminded of what 
they were, and that helps to keep the old culture intact. 
</P>
<P>
The English-language videos, especially American releases, tend to be most 
attractive to the new generation -- for different reasons. Eager to assimilate 
and already fluent in English, hip Southeast Asian youngsters wearing the 
trendiest Western clothes find in these videos the world they know better. The 
other tapes are for their parents, their grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
"They come (and rent) for different reasons, many reasons," Pham says. "Some 
remember and feel woe, others just want to enjoy (them) like anybody else. 
There are many different choices here for many people." 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in front of an animated restaurant in Little Saigon, Jane Serna and her 
66-year-old mother, Muoi Pham, are like opposite bookends in a library of 
changing cultural attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
Serna, 32, crosses her legs under a black leather mini-skirt that is less 
high-school sexy than Vogue fashionable. She announces that she is ready to 
speak and does so in crisp English. Her mother, who speaks little English, is 
friendly but a bit uncomfortable with the reporter's questions. 
</P>
<P>
At first, the daughter is interpreter for the mother. "She says (she feels) sad 
when she rents a (Vietnamese) video. She feels a heaviness from remembering her 
life there. She doesn't watch them often because of that heaviness; she'd 
rather watch nature (programs) or comedies on (American) TV. She has trouble 
(with the language), but she still understands. 
</P>
<P>
"But most of her friends, who are her age, get the dubbed movies; they want to 
have an (emotional) experience; they want to remember what has happened to 
them, what Vietnam is like." 
</P>
<P>
But Serna, with a surprising staunchness, says she only watches big-release 
English-language movies, whether in theaters or on video ("Die Hard" and "The 
Last Emperor" are two of her recent favorites). She stresses that she has 
embraced American ways and has found a happy life in Westminster; assimilation 
has not been easy, but it has been valuable. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the restaurant, Harold Nguyen, a 54-year-old insurance adjuster, is 
merrily eating a large bowl of noodles crowned with pigs' feet. He agrees that 
the younger generation tends to avoid most of the Vietnamese-language movies, 
with one exception. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody goes for the kung fu, even my children," says Nguyen, who has a 
young son and daughter. "They, of course, like all the action, which really 
doesn't have anything to do with the language. 
</P>
<P>
"But for the older generation, there is something (more significant) going on. 
In the kung fu or sword movies, good always defeats evil (and) justice wins. 
That is satisfying to us because we came from a country where everything is 
unfair, where (you couldn't count on) getting justice." 
</P>
<P>
The attraction also has a dark shade. Most Vietnamese are able to identify with 
these films because of the non-stop violence. "We understand all that fighting 
and danger because we had so much of it before we came here," he says. "That's 
the unhappy part of it." 
</P>
<P>
It's obvious that Danh Pham is proud of his store's inventory: more than 200 
Vietnamese titles and close to 1,000 English-language releases. Gathering them 
requires much work, but Pham insists that it is necessary because his customers 
have varied tastes and demand what is current. He also has to keep up with the 
competition from other Vietnamese video stores scattered throughout 
Westminster, Garden Grove and Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Although major-studio releases are popular ("The Untouchables," "The Godfather" 
films and "The Last Emperor" are current favorites), especially with the 
younger crowd, Pham says more than 50% of the rentals are for dubbed tapes. 
Like their English-language counterparts, most are about 90 minutes long, 
although there is a thriving market for 30- to 60-minute cassettes featuring 
Vietnamese folk songs, folk dances and lounge acts. 
</P>
<P>
Scattered throughout the shop are a few X-rated tapes as well. Not sexually 
explicit material, but soft-core movies with titles such as "Sexy Sisters." 
Most are American-made and, according to Pham, not that popular among his 
patrons. 
</P>
<P>
"They like the (dubbed) movies because they have lots of kissing, lots of 
hugging, but nothing too dirty. They don't like it too dirty," he says, then 
pauses with a smile. "Well, most people don't like it too dirty; some do come 
in and rent the dirtier ones, though."

INDIA: ACTION, SONG AND DANCE

<P>
In Bombay Spices, a shop along Pioneer Boulevard in Artesia, the air is 
redolent with the scent of curry and sandalwood. Herbs, spices and other 
foodstuffs line the shelves, along with articles of traditional Indian dress 
and, as touted by a sign in the window, "knit sweaters, cardigans, tops and 
fancy shoes from England." 
</P>
<P>
The tiny shop also has more than 1,200 videotapes lining the wall behind the 
register. The titles are mostly in Hindi and Punjabi, with a few English titles 
-- "Hero," "Divorce," "Coolie" -- scattered throughout. One of the tapes, 
entitled "Bijliyann" (which translates roughly as Electric), is playing on a 
small, battered color TV near the back of the shop. 
</P>
<P>
In one scene, a number of tough-but-sexy women in Western dress fight off a 
throng of oafish male assailants. In another scene, the gang's leader does a 
slinky, MTV-style lip-sync to a bouncy disco tune. There is a hint of slapstick 
as well, as one character bumbles through a scene a la Jerry Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
To a Western eye, the film seems oddly jumbled. But according to shop owner 
Bhupinder Singh Batra (shown on Page 1 with his wife), the mixture of action, 
music and comedy is a formula in Indian cinema. 
</P>
<P>
"There is adventure, suspense, fighting," Batra explains. "Very few (films) are 
based on one particular theme." 
</P>
<P>
Then there is the music. Bombay Spices carries several shelves of audio music 
tapes, and nearly all, Batra says, are collections of film tunes. "There must 
be at least four or five songs" for a film to be successful, Batra says. "There 
was a time when it was more classical and such. But now you will find more 
disco songs." 
</P>
<P>
Artesia, originally settled by Dutch and Portuguese immigrants, is now home to 
a number of ethnic communities, including Latino, Vietnamese and Indian 
enclaves. The stretch of Pioneer between 183rd Street and the Artesia Freeway 
(California 91) contains what is probably the largest concentration of Indian 
businesses in Southern California, including restaurants, clothing stores, 
jewelry shops and markets. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes they call it 'Little India,' " Batra says with a chuckle. "It's 
nothing like the Chinese and Korean communities, though. It's just a few 
shops." Bombay Spices once had a monopoly on the local video business, but now 
several nearby markets rent Indian videos. 
</P>
<P>
Down the street, at Ganesh Groceries, a pair of customers browse the video 
shelves. "These have to do with social themes, the way society treats people," 
says Nagarajian R. of Los Angeles, holding up two tapes he had selected. 
</P>
<P>
He classifies the films as social dramas but adds that, typically, Indian 
movies always include elements of action, music and romance. But the Indian 
portrayal of romance, he emphasizes, differs from that commonly found in 
American films: "It's not based on sex. . . . You won't ever find nudity in an 
Indian film." 
</P>
<P>
While he enjoys Indian cinema, R. is also a fan of American films. His friend, 
Bijili B. of Culver City, says she prefers Indian movies -- not out of a sense 
of obligation, she explains, but because it gives her a needed cultural 
connection to the homeland. "It helps me see what is happening at home," she 
explains. 
</P>
<P>
"The new generation, the ones who are brought up here, don't have much interest 
in Indian movies," says Bishan Dutt, proprietor of nearby India Video &amp; 
Records. "The ones who were born and brought up in India prefer to see movies 
from India." 
</P>
<P>
His shop is set up like a typical English-language video or music shop, with 
empty video sleeves displayed on the walls and records and tapes in a rack 
running down the center of the floor. Dutt says his shop is the only one in 
Southern California that deals in Indian video and music exclusively. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, one of the hottest items in Indian video is "Ramayan," a made-for-TV 
adaptation of the "Ramayana," a Sanskrit epic written in the 3rd Century BC. 
India would literally shut down when the series was shown on television there, 
Dutt says. 
</P>
<P>
On video, "Ramayan's" 23 episodes total more than 50 hours. Dutt says it is 
actually more popular as a sale item than as a rental, because "people want to 
have it for their children." 
</P>
<P>
"Ramayan," though, is an exception. Most of the tapes Dutt stocks fall into the 
action/adventure/comedy/musical/romance category that Indian film makers seem 
to specialize in. "Fight, dance and songs" are elements of almost all Indian 
feature films, Dutt says, because reality doesn't sell in India. Moviegoers 
want escape. 
</P>
<P>
And part of that escape is music. "You will find that one (film) in 50 or so is 
not" a musical, Dutt says. The 50th he categorizes as an "art" film, one that 
deals more in reality, and it is here that India and Hollywood find their 
common ground. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't make money, here or in India," Dutt says of art films from his 
homeland. "They're made to win awards."

CRITIC'S NOTES: DIRECTORS GUILD OPTS FOR MOVIES ON THE SLICK LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last year was a stunning time for movies, something you might not have gathered 
from the puzzling and borderline outrageous list of nominations from the 
Director Guild of America: Charles Crichton "A Fish Called Wanda"; Barry 
Levinson, "Rain Man"; Mike Nichols, "Working Girl"; Alan Parker, "Mississippi 
Burning," and Robert Zemeckis, "Who Framed Roger Rabbit." 
</P>
<P>
At first the list seems only a triumph of style over content or commercialism 
uber alles. It comes a little more into focus when you remember that the large 
percentage of the guild are from television and its sheltering environs, or, to 
put it another way, the relatively small percentage who are in movies alone. 
</P>
<P>
Every one of the films nominated fit a TV sensibility comfortably; three of 
them are pleasant, funny, hilarious. None of them strains us overmuch. They 
reduce complex situations to easily assimilated bites. Visually, they have 
strongly composed surfaces, almost as slickly beautiful as commercials. 
</P>
<P>
If it were it not for the dentist's-drill intensity of Dustin Hoffman's 
performance which electrifies "Rain Man," its story would be perilously close 
to a disease-of-the-week television movie. The deep-seated, stubborn objections 
that many critics have raised to "Mississippi Burning's" perversions of the 
truth are regularly brushed aside when a serious subject is melodramatized for 
TV. If "Working Girl" turned up as episodic television, Staten Islander Tess 
McGill vs. the corporate world, it would probably surprise no one. 
</P>
<P>
At year end, each of the critics' groups came up with a different winning film: 
"Accidental Tourist" from the New York Film Critics Assn.; "The Unbearable 
Lightness of Being" from the National Society of Film Critics; "Little Dorrit" 
from the Los Angeles Film Critics Assn. and "Mississippi Burning" from the 
National Board of Review. What this suggested was that the crop this year was 
so varied and so unusual and favorites from it were so hotly held that 
consensus was impossible. And missing from those lists were such directors as 
Francis Coppola ("Tucker") Martin Scorsese ("The Last Temptation of Christ") 
Stephen Frears ("Dangerous Liasons"), David Cronenberg ("Dead Ringers") and 
Clint Eastwood ("Bird"). 
</P>
<P>
Pleasant though some of their individual choices might be, overall the DGA's 
list is safe and strikingly mediocre. You might tuck Nichols ("Working Girl") 
into the 5 slot on a strong, gutsy list. It's charming to see Charlie Crichton 
recognized after all these years, although you might think that "A Fish Called 
Wanda" was more a writer's than a director's film. It's nice that Zemeckis' 
febrile intensity and the pure magic of his and his cohorts' achievements on 
"Roger Rabbit" were recognized. 
</P>
<P>
You might not expect the DGA to go out on a limb with "Dead Ringers," or "Women 
on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown" or "The Last Temptation of Christ." But 
it's unsettling when a guild of what might be hoped to be leaders shies away 
from its strongest visionaries, the Scorseses, the Coppolas, the Cronenbergs, 
the Eastwoods, the Edzards. They have certainly embraced them in the past when 
they picked Bernardo Bertolucci, Steven Spielberg, Oliver Stone and, if you go 
back far enough, Francis Coppola. 
</P>
<P>
We won't really be able to tell which way the wind is blowing among the 
directors until the Academy nominations are announced on Feb. 15. But if 
slickness and an eye on the grosses is beginning to infect this body, it is a 
frightening portent.

IT'S VERY INVIGORATING AT PARK CITY FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
PARK CITY, Utah 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This year's United States Film Festival, whose final showings in the ski town 
of Park City, Utah, wound down last Sunday, had a bracing effect that went far 
beyond the single-digit temperatures or the nosebleed altitude. While a panel 
of film maker-critics wrangled before an SRO crowd about whether "independents 
have lost their social conscience," and decided, "well, sort of," the news 
thundering down was an exhilarating "no!" 
</P>
<P>
Social conscience also means the ability to challenge, and the best of these 
films were challenges, tackling traditions, expectations, our social and 
sometimes our political fabric, even our memories. This time, however, there 
was the feeling that independent no longer only meant "worthy" and "good for 
you," but films that were sexy, life-affirming and seeable, as well as about 
something. 
</P>
<P>
By the close of the festival, as audiences packed in to see the dramatic and 
documentary competition winners -- "True Love," a shrewdly observed comedy 
about young love and (gulp) marriage, Bronx style, and "For All Mankind," a 
documentary that made unified art from the NASA footage of our moon voyages and 
landing -- it was clear that 1989 marked a turning point. 
</P>
<P>
The fine stuff is a trickle, still, not a torrent; but there is the sense of 
something exciting going on, of serious themes beneath the appealing exteriors. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly since Robert Redford's Sundance Institute took a hand in the 
proceedings in 1980, the U.S. Film Festival is an event that Hollywood watches 
with an eagle eye and attends in force. When Paul Mazursky, emcee of the awards 
ceremony, cracked that as a conservationist, Redford, was shocked by the deal 
memos littering the ski slopes, it was barely an exaggeration. The rush by 
agents, distributors, even publicists to press their cards on debuting 
writer/director Steven Soderbergh, standing on the snow-banked street after the 
tumultuous response to his brilliant feature, "sex, lies and videotape", was 
almost parodic. 
</P>
<P>
If a film-making presence hung over the festival, it was the devilish, mocking, 
magnificent one of John Cassavetes, Regrettably, he was absent, yet you would 
swear not, after watching Michael Ventura's programming of all of his films as 
a writer-director and crucial examples of his acting performances. If you'd 
grown up with Cassavetes' films, the chance to revisit so much wild, insistent 
love was irresistible. To some of the younger film makers and filmgoers who had 
only heard of "Shadows" or "Faces," it was cataclysmic. Frankly, it wreaked 
havoc with good intentions and a tight schedule. Hooking into Cassavetes's 
dangerous, glittering confrontations, watching him shred every bit of the 
fabric of pretense or politeness was ruinously unfair to any ordinary film with 
the bad luck to follow him. 
</P>
<P>
If it could be said that any film here connects directly into the Cassavetes 
vein, it is Soderbergh's "sex, lies and videotape," a delicate, tension-ridden 
and sexually charged investigation of contemporary romantic dysfunction. To be 
sure, Soderbergh's visuals are more elegant, his writing is more controlled, 
less the gasping, jagged American Realspeech of "Minnie and Moskowitz" or 
"Husbands" but he's no less relentless, and his intentions -- to peer behind 
the careful facade to some unsettling truths beneath -- are a match for 
Cassavetes' own, as is his quartet of actors. 
</P>
<P>
You could pick up information on the real lot of the independent today from 
some of the production histories: The four years it took, for example, to 
assemble "The Lodz Ghetto," correctly described as an existential horror story 
of the quarter-million inhabitants of that Polish city, of whom 800 survived to 
the end of World War II. The film makers used tiny archival photographs as well 
as a cache of Nazi color footage, blew them up, combined them with muted color 
footage shot in contemporary Poland and letters from within the ghetto and 
orchestrated everything into a soaring whole that makes the still move and 
absorbs us into the daily lives of this slowly disintegrating community. 
Setting off the impeccable work of director Alan Edelson and co-director/editor 
Kathryn Taverna is a phenomenal "musical" score by Wendy Blackstone who has 
created an aural portrait so detailed and so inventive that the film seems 
three-dimensional. 
</P>
<P>
On the other end of the production spectrum, there was the wild story behind 
another of the festival's triumphs, "Gingerale Afternoon," which had a 
gestation period of three weeks from the time producer Susan Shapiro saw Gina 
Wendkos' play at the Cast Theater in Hollywood to the day director Rafal 
Zielinski began shooting. What lent the affair its particular urgency was the 
fact that Dana Andersen, who plays the trailer-court heroine sunning in a 
bikini for most of the picture, was approaching her ninth month of pregnancy. 
The entire film was shot in 10 days; Andersen worked three of them before she 
delivered her 9-pound, 9-ounce son, and four days a month later. 
</P>
<P>
Astonishingly, there is no rushed feeling to the film, a rasping, touching, 
enormously sensual triangle about a husband (John M. Jackson), unmanned by 
long-term unemployment and dubious about impending fatherhood; his wife, 
nagging, worried and loving by turns; and his bubble-gum-voiced teen-aged 
mistress (Yeardly Smith). This was a production to shop from: Picking up on a 
skillful, soulful director (Zielinski), an inspired cinematographer (Yuri 
Neyman, of "Liquid Sky" and "D.O.A"), on bluesman Willie Dixon's great, 
integral songs, or on Wendkos' screenplay, substantially let-out from its play 
form. 
</P>
<P>
Again and again, you found serious themes, deliberately made watchable and in 
some cases, irresistible. "Powwow Highway" (set to open here shortly) was one 
of those. Actually, it mixes the question of political activism with a 
spiritual quest by a pair of contemporary Cheyenne Indians, but the theme is 
floated on the lightly ironic touch of new director Jonathan Wacks ("Repo 
Man's" co-producer), the glowing camera work of Toyomichi Kurita (who shot 
"Trouble in Mind" for Alan Rudolph) and the extraordinary presence of Toronto 
theater actor Gary Farmer. In truth, the mammoth Farmer is possibly the most 
sweetly endearing screen presence since E.T., (no disrespect intended to a 
living, breathing, non-manipulated actor). 
</P>
<P>
Not everything was roses in the programming, however. "Heathers," a blatantly 
cynical, supposed black comedy about teen-age suicide, made with technical 
skill and absolutely no point of view, became the subject of furious debates. 
No amount of production sheen or acting skill seemed excuse enough for the 
film's scabrous morality or its unprincipled viciousness. (Interestingly 
enough, while other films scrambled for a distributor, this one came equipped 
with one: New World Pictures.) 
</P>
<P>
Hardly equal in terms of venality, but disturbingly manipulative was "Let's Get 
Lost," Bruce Weber's portrait of the great jazz trumpeter Chet Baker. Certainly 
the film maker's exploitation of the drug-wracked Baker had the wholehearted 
cooperation of Baker himself, who had no hesitation about spinning his stories 
one more time or of driving up Pacific Coast Highway, draped in friendly young 
models. Gorgeous as ex-fashion photographer Weber makes his images, this is a 
soulless film, with scant respect for the people involved or even for the 
soaring line of Baker's music. 
</P>
<P>
But there were antidotes to such bitter aftertastes: "84 Charlie Mopic," a 
terrifyingly personal portrait about an Army reconnaissance unit in Vietnam, 
told through the lenses of a military cameraman and in the heartfelt 
recollection of writer-director-Vietnam vet Patrick Duncan. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Jeffrey Noyes Scher's "Prisoners of Inertia," a languidly hilarious tour 
of a certain Sunday in Manhattan, experienced by a hip pair of newlyweds, 
marvelously played by Amanda Plummer and Christopher Rich. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Hoffman's enticingly beautiful fable, now titled "Some Girls," about 
three beautiful young sisters and the suitor who caroms among them may wander a 
little off-track, but it has so much that is off-beat and special to it, 
including Andre Gregory's performance as their father and Lila Kedrova's as 
their grandmother, that it survives as a delightful memory. And "Who Killed 
Vincent Chin," by Christine Choy and Renee Tajima, which goes into the tensions 
behind the baseball-bat killing of a young Chinese-American by a pair of 
laid-off Detroit auto workers, is complex, many-leveled and troubling, not the 
sort of film whose hard realities can be shaken off. 
</P>
<P>
Or, to end on a note of triumph and idealism, there is "John Huston," the 
magnificent portrait of an artist, film maker, lover, husband, raconteur and 
father, by director Frank Martin. 
</P>
<P>
John Huston, John Cassavetes and the discoveries that were here for the finding 
are enough to solace the movie-loving soul for more than a while. Let's see how 
long they take to reach a parched audience.

SOUTHLAND'S 'MINORITY' THEATERS REFLECT -- SOMEWHAT -- A CHANGING POPULATION

<P>
The idea of "minority" theater in Los Angeles sounds like an oxymoron. 
</P>
<P>
How can such a beast as "minority" theater exist in a city where Asians, 
African-Americans and Latinos constitute its new majority? How can these 
individually diverse communities persist outside the mainstream, when each lays 
claim to its own universal theater traditions? 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles, after all, is the Pacific Rim city, civic boosters and cultural 
attaches proclaim; the combinatorial where the peoples of Asia and the 
far-flung Pacific converge with descendants of European, African and Latin 
American immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
A quick glance of hometown theater marquees seems to reflect this diversity. 
</P>
<P>
Cuban-born Eduardo Machado's "A Burning Beach," a drama which revolves around 
Cuba's hero-poet Jose Marti, has just opened at the Los Angeles Theatre Center. 
And Machado's translation of "The Day You'll Love Me," by Venezuela's Jose 
Ignacio Cabrujas, recently closed at the Taper, Too, the Mark Taper Forum's 
second stage. 
</P>
<P>
Machado's sojourn at LATC is no fluke. "A Burning Beach" represents the fifth 
LATC co-directing stint for Jose Luis Valenzuela of the theater's 7-year-old 
Latino Writer's Lab, which develops and showcases the works of Latino 
playwrights. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, playwright George Wolfe's "The Colored Museum" earned praise from 
critics and laughs from theatergoers for its irreverent look at black cultural 
icons. Taper staffers are gearing up for the March debut of "Sansei," the 
culmination of a three-year project built around the lives of the 
Japanese-American rock-fusion group, Hiroshima. 
</P>
<P>
The city's multicultural vitality also manifests itself in a wild theater 
patchwork ranging from the bawdy burlesque of East L.A.'s Teatro Blanquita, 
overseas Kabuki at the Japan America Theater, to black experimental drama at 
The Corner Theater. 
</P>
<P>
Looking southward, San Diego's Old Globe Theater has begun to thrust Latinos to 
center stage with its Teatro Meta project, which is charged with developing 
playwrights and actors. And the South Coast Repertory in Costa Mesa is looking 
toward a fourth season of its Hispanic Playwrights Project in August. So far, 
the project has developed a pair of full-blown productions -- "Birds" by Lisa 
Loomer and "Charley Bacon and His Friends" by Arthur Giron. Several other plays 
have jumped from the project to other mainstream stages. 
</P>
<P>
"My whole push is to put (Latinos) on the American stage, and we are seeing 
that happen," said project director Jose Cruz Gonzalez. "You can feel it on a 
national level. Other theaters are constantly calling us about the playwrights 
we work with." 
</P>
<P>
All of this diversity would seem to reinforce the image of Southern California 
as a center of a thriving, pluralistic theater, right? Wrong. 
</P>
<P>
For many former "minorities," Los Angeles' promise of multicultural communion, 
of a new cultural synthesis, remains unfulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
While minorities have made great strides on the neighborhood and mainstream 
stages, ethnic theater leaders claim these feats are in no way proportionate to 
their numbers or impact upon other media such as TV and film. Instead, they 
say, local theater's dependence on upper class Euro-American patrons sustains 
an older, more provincial image of Los Angeles where class and cultural 
barriers as high as freeways still relegate the city's new, multiethnic 
majority to cultural marginality. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who control the purse strings are the mainstream people," said 
Jorge Huerta, a University of California, San Diego drama professor who 
recently directed "Burning Patience," a fictional account of Chilean poet 
laureate Pablo Neruda's last years, at the San Diego Repertory. "There are very 
few theaters controlled by this new majority." 
</P>
<P>
"The principal function of mainstream theater," adds C. Bernard Jackson, 
director/founder of the Inner City Cultural Center, a nonprofit theater that 
straddles the Pico-Union district's Latino, Asian and black communities, "is to 
serve a white, middle-class audience, and anything else they do is a secondary 
to that function." 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Albert, managing director of the Mark Taper Forum, the mother ship of 
Los Angeles theater, rejects all such contentions. The forum has not only been 
responsive to the city's ethnic diversity, Albert argued, but opened the door 
for minorities by commissioning works such as Luis Valdez' "Zoot Suit" in 1978, 
its longest-running hit. 
</P>
<P>
"We are all aware of the (ethnic) richness, and we are all attempting to mine 
it. But you can't go out every time and duplicate an experience like 'Zoot 
Suit.' It's like hitting a home run." The forum's obligation is to create 
world-class theater, instead of attempting to appeal to any one audience 
segment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our experience has been, when we have done things well, and had plays that 
speak to a particular audience, whether it's the disabled, gays, ethnic or 
religious groups, the audience will find the work." 
</P>
<P>
And LATC has recently formed Asian and black theater labs to take on the task 
of commissioning and developing new plays and playwrights with a view toward 
someday combining the efforts of each of its labs in single, multiethnic 
production. 
</P>
<P>
But if some ethnic theater leaders view the city's mainstream stage as unequal 
and unreciprocating, they also face their own special quandaries. No where has 
this been more evident than at East West Players, a 24-year-old, 
Hollywood-based theater that has found itself redefining its mission as an 
Asian-American theater. The catalyst for the debate was last month's 
resignation of Mako, East West's founding artistic producing director. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Wong, chairman of the theater's board of directors, said that one factor 
prompting the board to request Mako's resignation was a belief that he had 
focused too much energy in staging plays portraying the Japanese-American 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
Mako acknowledged that although he had tried to encourage productions about 
other Pacific Rim peoples, the works of Japanese-American playwrights have 
predominated. 
</P>
<P>
"We have produced more Japanese-American pieces," he said. "I don't know if 
that has to do with me being Japanese-American. We have made every attempt to 
present a wide diversity of Asian minorities. But we haven't been all that 
successful." 
</P>
<P>
But Mako wondered whether East West's problems go beyond his administration to 
the theater's tendency to favor a second- and third-generation immigrant 
audience at a time when the surge of new Asian immigrants has been too large to 
ignore. 
</P>
<P>
Wong doesn't worry about the new immigrants. He believes that the melting pot 
dynamic of assimilation will work its magic by prompting the kind of 
generational conflict earlier Asian immigrants endured with their parents. 
</P>
<P>
"They will not become part of our audience until their children go to our 
schools and start thinking like American kids. Then they will understand," he 
said. "We have to go after our younger audience because they are the ones going 
through this psychological and spiritual crisis. In any case, we can't change 
what parents think." 
</P>
<P>
Mako said that he has shared Wong's views about the great gulf that separates 
older and newer immigrants: "The old (Asian) immigrants came with nothing. They 
struggled for years to establish themselves against discrimination and racism. 
The new immigrants come with a handful of cash in their pockets. A lot of them 
see themselves as Chinese, not as Asian-American. It's a totally different 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
The plethora of Asian languages also makes these audiences difficult to entice. 
</P>
<P>
But it still may be wrong to write off an audience with strong ties to 
classical theater traditions and a willingness to view an uptown theater as a 
status- and class-affirming experience, he said. "When the Peking Opera or the 
Shanghai Acrobats come to this city, the Chinese immigrants will pay $200 a pop 
(for tickets) without a second thought. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it's high time we retraced our steps." 
</P>
<P>
East West isn't the only community ethnic theater to have its goals and purpose 
questioned. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Inner City Cultural Center helped launch the careers of artists 
like Mako, some community members wonder if the center hasn't lost sight of its 
ecumenical vision and begun to exclusively favor productions staged by 
African-American community groups. 
</P>
<P>
Rosa Maria Marquez, the center's publicity director, said that production 
activity at the three-theater facility must be placed in proper perspective. 
</P>
<P>
She acknowledged that the center has recently staged a number of successful 
black-themed plays such as "Checkmates," but it has also produced 
Latino-oriented works such as "Calavereando," a piece about Mexico's Day of the 
Dead celebration. She added that the center also integrates its productions 
through nontraditional casting. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the center's Jackson said, reaching out to a community in the midst of 
demographic turmoil and deteriorating social conditions hasn't been easy. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been witnessing a tremendous flux in a poor working-class community," 
he said. "You see waves of people from El Salvador, Guatemala, but their 
influence is short-lived. You don't have a viable community culture as yet." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Jackson maintained, the center is attracting multiethnic 
audiences by organizing open competitions in playwrighting, and eventually 
music, all without the benefit of large Latino and African-American 
middle-class patronage. 
</P>
<P>
Two groups east of the cement-lined Los Angeles River -- the Bilingual 
Foundation of the Arts, a nonprofit community theater dedicated to performing 
classic and contemporary Spanish and Latin American plays, and Plaza de la 
Raza, a performing arts center with fine dance and theater facilities -- have 
also come in for criticism. 
</P>
<P>
The knock against both organizations has been their conservative aesthetic 
outlook, said Gronk, experimental artist and now sought-after set designer of 
the just-ended Milcha Sanchez Scott play, "Stone Wedding," at LATC. 
</P>
<P>
"My connections with Plaza are almost nil," said Gronk, also a performance 
artist. "When you think of artists of my generation, when you see how many were 
nurtured at Plaza, you can't point to very many. It doesn't function as a 
showcase. Again, it's the conservative part of the community that has trouble 
with new ideas." 
</P>
<P>
And when it come to the foundation, Gronk added, he doubts whether it would 
have commissioned him to design the set for a play like "Stone Wedding." 
</P>
<P>
Carmen Zapata, foundation director, said the criticism is misdirected. The 
stage and screen actress contends that the foundation has produced some 
experimental works, including last year's staging of "Pedro Paramo," a mythic 
epic based on Juan Rulfo's classic novel. She said limited financial and 
technical resources restrict her options. 
</P>
<P>
Zapata also finds that excessively negative reviews can be especially damaging 
to the young writers she works with. "It doesn't help the writer. Because of 
that, I don't do that many new works," she said. "When I find something 
promising, I will take a chance. 
</P>
<P>
"We are still not where we should be with our writers," she said. "We need to 
help them along. We need to find funding for them. Just performing their plays 
is not enough. They need a dramaturge to work with them. If we had that kind of 
help we could go a long way." 
</P>
<P>
A community theater performing the works of Garcia Lorca or Lope De Vega in 
Spanish and English is as valid as one performing Shakespeare or Moliere, 
Zapata added. 
</P>
<P>
But the foundation, she dryly noted, has a hard time competing with the likes 
of LATC's Latino Lab: "Because of the reputation they have and their prestige 
and funding, any young writer will go to them and not to me." 
</P>
<P>
Jay Stephens Rodriguez, project director of Plaza's Nuevo L.A. Chicano Theatre 
Works, agrees with Zapata: neither Plaza nor the foundation can be blamed for 
the failures of mainstream theater. That's why Rodriguez plans to create a 
competition to draw out new playwrights. Manuscripts for one-act plays will be 
accepted beginning March 1, he said. Three winning plays will be selected and 
produced at Plaza's Margo Albert Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
The competition will only solicit the works of Chicano, or Mexican-American, 
writers from California. Rodriguez said the rationale for excluding other 
Latinos is simple. So far, he said, most playwriting competitions of this sort, 
have been dominated by non-Mexican Latinos who have benefited from a stronger 
East Coast theater tradition. 
</P>
<P>
Waiting for U.S.-born Latino playwrights will take time, warned UC's Huerta. 
Latinos therefore will go begging for scripts unless they can break down the 
mainstream theater biases against performing Latin American plays. 
</P>
<P>
"Only our novels have been translated, but not our dramatic literature," he 
said bitterly. "Mainstream theaters have continually put on bad or mediocre 
translations of European plays, but they will not accept mediocre translations 
of Latin American plays." 
</P>
<P>
And Huerta asserts that nontraditional casting is no panacea because ethnic 
communities would rather see plays about themselves than have a minority actor 
play King Lear. 
</P>
<P>
But does multicultural nirvana await beyond workshops, translations and 
competitions? 
</P>
<P>
LATC's Valenzuela believes that the cultural dynamic of Los Angeles requires 
new aesthetic sensibilities: its playwrights and directors must first invent a 
new language. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of it has to do with finding another voice that is not just the linear, 
European way of thinking about theater," Valenzuela said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are the most exciting city in the country, so our theater has to reflect 
that. We are going to have to dare to say, this is who we are. There's a lot of 
good energy and talent here. I am sure that they are going to make it happen."

WINNER IN MUSICAL PODIUMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Almost as soon as Georg Solti made it known late in 1986 that he would retire 
as music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in 1991, Daniel Barenboim 
headed the roster of rumored heirs. After all, the 46-year-old musician had 
first conducted the orchestra back in 1970, and has made more than 30 
recordings with the CSO. 
</P>
<P>
Reached at his home in Paris, Barenboim confirmed that he had signed a contract 
more than a year ago with the Chicago Symphony, which made the agreement public 
last week. Barenboim becomes music director designate immediately, dropping the 
designate portion of the title for the 1991-92 season. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a number of ideas about the role of the musicians, and the orchestra in 
general. It is time now to look back and see how the symphony orchestra has 
developed," Barenboim says. "We have made really tremendous progress in the 
last 50 years in improving the social position of musicians. However, because 
of the need for more concerts -- and more audiences -- the life has become a 
little too much based on routine. It is all too much in compartments." 
</P>
<P>
Barenboim's solution to the problem is to expand the activities of the 
orchestra, in collaborations with other arts institutions, citing in Chicago 
the opera, theaters, museums and music schools. "I would like for the Chicago 
Symphony to have a catalyzing influence," he says. "I would like to give the 
musicians of Chicago the widest possible opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
His ideas may seem familiar to followers of U.S. orchestras. Ernest 
Fleischmann, executive vice president of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, put 
forth similar proposals in a widely discussed article, "The Orchestra Is Dead. 
Long Live the Community of Musicians." 
</P>
<P>
Barenboim is not quite ready to say that the orchestra is dead, a statement 
seemingly used principally for shock value by Fleischmann. Nor does he believe 
the symphony orchestra is an elitist institution. 
</P>
<P>
"No, absolutely not," he says. Elitism, however, was one of the charges laid 
against Barenboim when he was fired two weeks ago from a $1.1 million job 
heading the new Opera de la Bastille in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a very inaccurate way of describing what I wanted to do with the 
Opera," Barenboim says. Nor is he plannning to go gently into operatic night. 
"We are going to court now." 
</P>
<P>
Even if the French courts disappoint him in his bid to remain as head of Opera 
Bastille, Barenboim will be a busy man. He is music director of L'Orchestre de 
Paris, succeeding Solti in the position in 1975, and will remain there until 
1990. He conducted the new "Ring" in Bayreuth last summer, and confirms that 
Bayreuth remains a long-term commitment. He also has other guest-conducting 
engagements, and intends to maintain active as a piano soloist and recitalist. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't forsee any problems," he says of this schedule. As music director 
designate, Barenboim is expected to be in Chicago for at least six weeks during 
each of the transitional seasons, and will share conducting duties with Solti 
during the CSO tour of Japan in April, 1990. When he takes over in 1991, his 
three-year contract calls for him to conduct a minimum of 12 weeks of concerts 
in Chicago per season and lead all major tours. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going into this position in Chicago with a great sense of joy," Barenboim 
says.

"Everyone quiet, please." 
</P>
<P>
The noise level in the KCRW-FM control room instantly subsided as closing time 
for "The African Beat" radio program approached. The strains of "Aki Special" 
by Prince Nico Mbarga suddenly went silent in the monitor speakers as C. C. 
Smith, co-host of the Saturday afternoon show, faded down the track and flipped 
open the mike. 
</P>
<P>
Smith and co-host Solomon Egbuho (who has acquired the on-air nickname of 
Solomon Solo), ran down the closing credits. But the moment Smith cut off the 
mike and the vibrant song again blared out of the studio speakers, a handful of 
studio guests and Solo -- who was wearing traditional white Nigerian robes with 
avocado green trim -- exploded out of their seats in an exuberant dance. 
</P>
<P>
"Seven days a week, we're going crazy," the ebullient Solo, 35, said after the 
show. "Hey, Saturday, 2 to 5, come on now. Let's get loose. Put your hand on 
the radio and get healed." 
</P>
<P>
Pop music sounds from around the world are fast becoming a more integral part 
of the American pop scene. But for most Angelenos, the first exposure to the 
vast variety of international pop styles will come from specialty radio 
programs like "African Beat" that are broadcast on local National Public Radio 
affiliates like KCRW, college stations and independent FM stations like 
KPFK-FM. 
</P>
<P>
The process of discovery that American pop fans often undergo is reflected in 
C. C. Smith's own experience. She had met Roger Steffens, founder and former 
co-host of KCRW's "Reggae Beat" program, at the 1981 Sunsplash Festival in 
Jamaica. She became the reggae show's telephone volunteer, and, one afternoon 
in 1981, Smith announced the program's calendar over the air. 
</P>
<P>
"I never had any plans of being on the radio and it knocked me out," said 
Smith, 40. "It was really exciting to hear your voice feeding back in the 
earphones, so I immediately signed up at Pasadena City College for a couple of 
radio courses." 
</P>
<P>
Smith went to KPFK-FM for a few shows before returning to KCRW and picking up 
experience behind the mike on some less-than-prime-time shows at the station. 
She had just settled into a blues programming slot when Nigeria's King Sunny 
Ade came through town on his first American tour early in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"(KCRW program director) Tom Schnabel saw him, said this is the next big thing, 
and bingo! C. C. is doing an African show," Smith said with a laugh. "I knew 
nothing about African music at all." 
</P>
<P>
Smith teamed up unsuccessfully with a pair of African co-hosts before Solo 
called one day and offered to bring some Nigerian records to the station. Solo 
had produced high school concerts in Nigeria and a cousin owned a record label 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Solo, who came to the United States in 1975 to attend the Aerospace Institute 
in Chicago and moved to Southern California three years later for graduate 
school, had maintained his musical interests here by working as a deejay at 
Nigerian social functions around Los Angeles. He officially became the show's 
co-host in 1983. The program currently runs from 2 to 5 p.m. Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said that selecting the material for the "The African Beat" is often a 
haphazard process. Smith sometimes just grabs a handful of records when she 
leaves her Glendale home, or supplements them with new selections she might 
purchase at Rhino Records in Westwood on the way to the studio on the Santa 
Monica College campus. 
</P>
<P>
Solo will bring in records he buys on trips back to Nigeria, and sometimes 
listeners help out. One fan who runs a safari company in eastern Africa picks 
up records from Zimbabwe, Tanzania and Zambia and comes on the show when he 
returns here. 
</P>
<P>
It is an expensive proposition. Even though American labels are starting to 
release more African pop material here, much of the music Smith and Solo 
program is only available on high-priced import albums -- and those expenses 
come directly out of their pockets. There is also the constant battle to keep 
abreast of current developments in Africa and to maintain a geographical 
balance of the music presented on the show. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to keep a perspective on what's happening all over the continent," Smith 
said. "Sometimes I'll do a show that's geared to a particular country -- an 
hour of Senegalese music, say, and then an hour of music from Kenya. Zaire and 
Nigeria are the two main producers of music right now in Africa so it's easy to 
program that." 
</P>
<P>
The focus of "The African Beat" has broadened in recent years to include zouk 
and other forms of Caribbean music. Smith's curiosity led her to travel to 
Guadeloupe and Martinique, the islands where zouk was born, and she also became 
fascinated with Haitian compas music. Both styles have strong links with much 
current African pop music. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really exciting when we first started learning about (leading zouk 
group) Kassav'," said Smith. "When I first heard their hit 'Zouk-La-Se Sel 
Medikaman Nou Ni,' that really changed my direction. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of African musicians are having the zouk influence now because all the 
people from the Antilles and Africa are meeting in the Paris studios. That 
musical form is changing African music and the cross-fertilization continues." 
</P>
<P>
That expansion in Smith's interests has also been reflected in her other 
international pop venture -- editing The Beat. The magazine started off in 1982 
as a one-page newsletter listing the records played on "The Reggae Beat" 
program. Now it's a respected monthly publication with some distribution in 
foreign markets, 3,000 paid subscribers, a 12,000-copy press run and an 
editorial policy that Smith claims makes it the the only magazine to cover 
reggae, African, Caribbean and world music on a regular basis. 
</P>
<P>
The Beat has developed a tougher, more analytical stance than many magazines in 
the international field. It recently published an extensive article on a New 
York City trial concerning an early Bob Marley publishing deal that brought to 
light the occasional use of strong-arm tactics by the late reggae giant and his 
friends that run counter to his heroic public image. 
</P>
<P>
Hosting the radio program and editing the magazine was so time-consuming that 
Smith quit her job as a law librarian three years ago to "sink or swim" with 
her international pop projects. She's hopeful that an investor will help put 
The Beat magazine on a fully professional footing that would allow its writers 
to be paid and enable the magazine to rent a proper office. But there is no 
question that Smith is in it -- both on the air and in print -- for the long 
haul. 
</P>
<P>
"It would take something really major to change me out of this path right now," 
she said. "It's wonderful to see the music catching on, considering that when 
we started five years ago we had a hard time finding records at all." 
</P>
<P>
The impact of the "African Beat" show cuts even deeper for Solo. He described 
it as taking a trip to Nigeria every week for three hours. And it's a 
particularly important cultural connection with their homelands for L.A.-based 
Africans who, like Solo, are raising children who were born in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever it takes to make sure this keeps going, I'll put in my 150% because 
this is the outlet that we have to preserve," said Solo. "What I'm getting out 
of it is like a rejuvenation. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if you've had a very rough week, you come in here and it takes away all 
the suffering. It takes me 15 minutes to come from Inglewood to this place and 
that's the greatest 15 minutes in my life. It's so fulfilling you can't believe 
it."

A HOME FOR FOLK MUSIC: GREEK, BALKAN, GYPSY AND MORE

Fielding a phone request for Mongolian "throat" music . . . sending off a mail 
order of five cassette tapes of Gypsy music to a woman in Texas. . . . 
</P>
<P>
It's all in a day's work for John Filcich, the owner of the Festival Foreign 
Records store in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Festival Foreign Records is a far cry from a typical contemporary record store. 
The spacious, homey store near Pico Boulevard and Normandie Avenue is jammed 
with record bins full of traditional folk and folk dance records from around 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
Festival specializes in Greek and Gypsy recordings as well as music from the 
Balkan nations. 
</P>
<P>
Such albums as "Le Mystere Des Voixs Bulgares" and "The Gipsy Kings," two 
recent left-field pop chart successes, are representative of the kind of music 
regularly available at the store. 
</P>
<P>
"I had them before they were known," said Filcich, 65, in a bemused tone. "I 
had the Chieftains before the Chieftains became popular and reggae music before 
you heard about reggae. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how many more things I've got here right now that people are 
going to be excited about 10 years from now. It just takes the right kind of 
exposure." 
</P>
<P>
Providing that exposure for international music has sustained Filcich through a 
career that began in the era of 78s, 40 years ago, and has now reached the CD 
age. Filcich's dislike of pop and rock music means that he doesn't stock many 
of the international pop records that are beginning to make inroads in the 
mainstream pop market, but he's not surprised that pop fans are showing more 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
"It certainly should be appreciated by everybody," he contended. "The music has 
a long heritage and tradition and the most beautiful aspect of any foreign 
culture is the music and dance. It's a universal language; you don't have to 
understand it to be able to appreciate it." 
</P>
<P>
Filcich's interest in international music was sparked after his father received 
an old phonograph and a stack of Bulgarian, Serbian and Macedonian records in 
exchange for painting a house. He gave the device to John, his eldest son, in 
1935. 
</P>
<P>
Filcich's interest in music was further fueled by growing up in the polyglot 
city of Gary, Ind., a steel industry town packed with immigrants from Eastern 
Europe who performed the music and dances of their native lands at picnics and 
church bazaars. 
</P>
<P>
Filcich opened the first branch of Festival Records in Oakland in 1949 and then 
expanded to a store in San Francisco. He opened the Los Angeles store 25 years 
ago across from St. Sophia's Greek Orthodox Cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
The Greek community is still the cornerstone of his business. An array of 
neatly marked cardboard boxes of cassettes and CDs lines the walls behind the 
register, and shelves around the store display religious icons, souvenirs and 
videos that Filcich stocks for his Greek Orthodox and Gypsy customers. 
</P>
<P>
The store was devoid of casual browsers late one recent afternoon, but Filcich 
indicated that was par for the course. Most of his regular customers drive in 
from their homes in the outlying suburbs or, in the case of the Gypsies, stop 
in when their travels bring them to Los Angeles. Filcich often loads up a van 
with merchandise to sell at church events or folk dance workshops and also does 
a healthy mail order business with his Gypsy customers. 
</P>
<P>
"I will always be able to say that I found the right niche in life in my work," 
Filcich observed. "When I was young, I was either fired out of every job that I 
had or hated it so much that I wished they did fire me. Once I got into this, I 
couldn't spend enough hours on it. I have enjoyed my business and enjoyed my 
life because of it."

OFFICIALS DEBATE WAYS TO REDUCE INFLUX OF ALIENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE MAY, Times Staff Writer

<DATELINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The federal government, in a quandary over how to handle the massive influx of 
Central Americans seeking political asylum, is debating a range of approaches, 
including detention centers, Bush Administration sources said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
One source said that idea, which drew immediate criticism from immigrant 
advocates, is at the "conservative end of the scale." At the "liberal end," 
officials within the Justice Department are advocating a special status called 
extended voluntary departure that would allow the immigrants to remain in this 
country until the situations in their homelands become stable. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stemming Immigrant Flow 
</P>
<P>
Also, officials said, the Administration is casting about for ways to press 
Mexican officials to help stem the flow of undocumented immigrants through 
Mexico en route to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking for Mexican help to cut them off," said an Administration 
official, referring to the Central American immigrants. However, the official 
acknowledged that this tack runs the risk of angering Mexicans who might view 
it as intervention. 
</P>
<P>
The other possible solutions also are fraught with problems, making the 
situation a proverbial political mine field for the new Administration. 
Meanwhile, a federal judge's order last week gives the government until Feb. 20 
to come up with a way to handle the continuing flow of immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
The Immigration and Naturalization Service reports that since July, 30,000 
Central Americans -- about half of them Nicaraguans -- have poured across the 
border into Texas. Activists say the focus on Texas is causing immigrants to 
turn increasingly to other routes. Once in the country, most of the immigrants 
disperse to Florida and California, with a sizable number settling here in the 
nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
What the Administration will do to handle the continuing influx "is still up in 
the air," said Loye Miller, director of public affairs at the Justice 
Department. "It's a damn tough problem." 
</P>
<P>
For the last seven months, immigrants from Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala 
and Honduras have fled their homelands in increasing numbers, joining hundreds 
of thousands already here. They enter this country mainly through South Texas 
and seek political asylum on grounds that they have a "well-founded fear" of 
persecution in their war-torn home countries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Judge Stays INS Rule 
</P>
<P>
The INS, asserting that almost all such claims from Central Americans are 
frivolous, last December issued rules that made the immigrants wait at the 
point of entry while their claims were processed. In Brownsville, Tex., last 
Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Filemon Vela issued a 20-day stay of the INS rule, 
making it possible for the immigrants to apply for asylum any place in the 
nation and avoid the possibility of being trapped in squalid camps in South 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the judge indicated that he is likely to allow the INS to 
begin holding immigrants in South Texas when the order expires in less than 
three weeks, saying the INS was within the law in issuing the rule last 
December. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the judge sides with them, INS officials realize they must find a way 
to handle the huge numbers of immigrants who would be concentrated in the 
Brownsville area. 
</P>
<P>
"Putting up some kind of detention centers (in the border areas) addresses the 
issue of meeting their human needs," one Administration official said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seen Violating Spirit of Law 
</P>
<P>
But the lingering criticism of the federal policy that put Cuban and Haitian 
immigrants in such centers after their arrival in 1980 weighs heavily against 
the plan. "The notion of alien detention centers on U.S. soil is disturbing 
because it violates the spirit if not the letter of the Refugee Act of 1980," 
said Wade Henderson, associate director of the Washington office of the 
American Civil Liberties Union. 
</P>
<P>
Carmen Monico, national coordinator of the Central American Refugee Committees, 
said activists would "start a campaign" to prevent the INS from operating the 
centers. "We don't need more detention centers," she said. "We need a fair 
refugee act, including every consideration of extended voluntary departure." 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, this status, granted at the President's discretion, has been 
applied to numerous countries deemed unstable and unsafe, revoking it when 
conditions return to normal. Currently, Ethiopians, Poles and Afghans are 
allowed to stay in the United States under this policy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Faces Attack From Right 
</P>
<P>
However, the conservative Bush Administration, like Ronald Reagan's before it, 
faces a barrage of criticism from the right if it offers refuge to Salvadorans 
-- that would be perceived as an acknowledgement that the Salvadoran 
government, a U.S. ally, is oppressive. (In 1987, then-Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese 
III took steps to make it easier for Nicaraguans to obtain refugee status, but 
immigrant advocates say the move was only "symbolic.") 
</P>
<P>
The Administration's dilemma has given new hope to advocates of congressional 
legislation that would halt deportations of Salvadorans and Nicaraguans for 18 
months while the government studies conditions that led to their immigration. 
</P>

Meanwhile, for President Bush, there seems no easy way out of a sticky 
situation. He strains Texas tempers and resources if the immigrants are held 
there. But if they are allowed to move on to Miami and Los Angeles, Floridians 
and Californians complain. 
</P>
<P>
"Bush has a tremendous following in Florida, and he's from Texas," said an 
Administration official, summing up Bush's geopolitical problem.

In theory, Edwin Markham Intermediate School is neutral ground. Crips territory 
stretches to the east, past a low, graffiti-slashed wall and the Southern 
Pacific railroad tracks. Bloods claim the turf to the west. Often they parade 
by the school on bikes or in cars, waving red bandanas -- their "rags." 
</P>
<P>
From both sides, more than 1,600 children arrive for class each weekday. Sixth- 
through eighth-graders, and a few dozen ninth-graders in special programs, pass 
abruptly from the troubled neighborhoods of Watts to 24 acres of classic campus 
architecture. 
</P>
<P>
But even at Markham, with its low-slung brick buildings and its grassy quad, 
the gangs cannot be left behind. At Markham, "Everybody gets confronted and 
everybody has to deal with it," says ninth-grader Arnold Gordon. (Like all of 
the current students in this article, his name has been changed.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Any Inner-City School 
</P>
<P>
This is the story of Markham's fall semester, which ended Friday -- a story 
that could have unfolded at any number of inner-city schools in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Life at Markham has been a daily campaign to preserve a bastion of civility 
amid the subtle tensions of gang culture, a constant game of 
what-might-happen-next. Teachers sermonize against gangs and try, with varying 
degrees of success, to get lessons across. Parents and neighbors escort 12- and 
13-year-old charges to and from school. Administrators struggle to sift real 
dangers from imagined ones. 
</P>
<P>
And students often opt for survival strategies that prevent them from taking 
full advantage of what school has to offer: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fear of Crips classmates propels Franklin Jenkins away from a physical 
education class and over a fence. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Teewana Miller refuses to eat lunch -- too much turmoil, too much risk -- 
at the cafeteria. She is fueled instead by candy from the school store. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Eighth-grader Alfred Hill says, "I get fails that I don't deserve," because 
he cannot concentrate in class. "Instead I think: Are they going to jump me 
after school?" 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dwayne McDaniel brings a screwdriver to class because a couple of students 
asked him if he was a Blood. "I have to defend myself," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Adolescent years are difficult for any child, but at Markham, the usual 
confusions are compounded. For most Markham students, who attended elementary 
school in their own neighborhoods, intermediate school is their first sustained 
exposure to children from other gangs' turf. At an age when many youngsters are 
making decisions about their relationship to the neighborhood gang, also known 
as a "set," there is suddenly a reason to join: a need for protection. 
</P>
<P>
"Gangbangers" make up a significant minority -- 10% by the administration's 
estimate; students put the figure closer to 30%. A typical Markham student 
would not belong to a gang but would certainly know and even be friendly with a 
classmate who does. Such relationships can be hazardous. 
</P>
<P>
In class, gangbangers whisper greetings ("Hey, Cuz" among the Crips or "Hey, 
Blood" among the Bloods). They hiss insults to rivals. They "throw signs" -- 
bending fingers to form "C," for Crip, or "CK," for Crip Killer, "B" for Blood, 
or "BK" for Blood Killer. Between classes, they threaten those in clothes that 
feature enemy gang colors, or those who simply live in enemy gang 
neighborhoods. They stare and shove and step on shoes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Campus Police 
</P>
<P>
The containment effort is omnipresent. Security aides clutch walkie-talkies; 
two school policemen carry .38-caliber revolvers and Mace. At the eighth-grade 
welcoming assembly, an assistant principal offers this advice: "It is insane to 
run over whenever there's some fight going on. . . . This is not a Saturday 
morning cartoon. . . . Are you aware that most of the people killed have not 
been in gangs, they have been innocent bystanders?" 
</P>
<P>
The principal, Hal Kimbell Jr., devotes a lot of time to gang control. Before 
and after school, he drives the streets near the campus and urges others in the 
community to do the same. Operation Safe Corridors, he calls it. He works out 
schemes to catch intruders and puzzles over the dress code. 
</P>
<P>
"If we didn't have to worry about this and could concentrate on education, 
think how much we could do," Kimbell says. 
</P>
<P>
But he does have to worry. Most tough-talking kids merely hope to gain a gang's 
acceptance; in general, they are too young to be gang leaders. But they still 
can be dangerous at school. Kimbell and his security staff wonder what the 
diminutive "gangsters" might do to impress the older Crips loitering on the 
tracks, the hard-core Bloods hanging out across the street. And they worry 
whether older boys will decide to avenge slights against their younger 
brothers, cousins and hangers-on inside the school fence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Innocent Victim 
</P>
<P>
Once, more than four years ago, the worst fears were realized. During morning 
nutrition break on May 7, 1984, a Blood fired at least five times through the 
fence into a knot of children -- "Crips and Crip associates," as court records 
put it. The gunman had earlier fought at Markham with a Crip student. 
Ninth-grader Ronzell Pointer, an innocent victim, was wounded and died 15 days 
later. 
</P>
<P>
It is impossible to know when students are pretending to be threatened by a 
gang as an excuse to change schedules, to stay out of class, to fight . . . or 
if serious harm -- maybe death -- is near. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, says Kimbell, "We have to stay on top of it. You have to be 
vigilant. You cannot let up." 
</P>
<P>
As 8 a.m. approaches on Sept. 14, children pour through the gate by the tracks. 
Many wear the purple of the Grape Street Crips from the Jordan Downs housing 
project or the blue of the PJ (for Pro-Jects) Watts Crips from Imperial Courts. 
A few wear the dark brown of a newer group, called Fudgetown. 
</P>
<P>
They also stream through the Compton Avenue gate, many in red for the Bloods 
sets -- the Bounty Hunters of Nickerson Gardens, the Hacienda Boys of Hacienda 
Village. 
</P>
<P>
In Room 6, Pat Rice is expecting a good semester. It will be her 27th year of 
teaching, her fourth at Markham -- English and music this time. Rice thinks she 
might be able to work against the influence of the gang sets. 
</P>
<P>
But her optimism is tempered by her husband's warnings. Though she grew up 
upper-middle-class in New Orleans, he attended Markham. "If they didn't have 
campus security, my husband wouldn't let me work here," Rice says. "He 
remembers from when he was growing up, how they looked at do-gooders, how they 
ripped them off." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Students' World 
</P>
<P>
Rice's first batch of essays offer a reminder of her students' world. "I 
watched 'Double Dare,' 'Treasure Wall,' 'Slime Time' and 'Finders Keepers' on 
TV and lots of other shows," 13-year-old Tarisha Martin writes about her 
summer. "I also was seeing a lot of gang-related fights in the project, 
shoot-outs and other things. We also had a family day at our gym." 
</P>
<P>
"What is your favorite color?" is another question. "Every Body Wares Blue," 
writes Alfred, 13, who lives in the Crip zone. Asked to finish the sentence: "I 
hate to," he writes: "Die." 
</P>
<P>
Fred Williams and Jim Goins, the drop-out prevention team known as Mr. Fred and 
Mr. Jim, sit in their office, a former science lab. They enroll students at 
elementary schools. But this year, for the first time, they will be based at 
Markham. 
</P>
<P>
Through the window they spy five young men along the tracks. "Hey, look who's 
here!" Williams calls. 
</P>
<P>
The boys wear the gangbangers' uniform of baggy khaki or black pants and white 
T-shirts. One of them, Marco Nolan, wears his trousers so low that the purple 
stripes on his boxer shorts signal his allegiance to Grape Street. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gang Styles 
</P>
<P>
Goins shakes his head. "They don't even know why (gang members) wear their 
pants like that," he says. "It's because they don't give you belts in prison." 
</P>
<P>
On Bradley Payne's back pocket is embroidered WBLC -- Watts Baby Loc Crips -- a 
sort of junior auxiliary to the Grapes. WVG, for Watts Varrios Grapes, is 
another name for the set. (Varrios is a corruption of barrios. With the Latino 
population burgeoning in Southeast Los Angeles, black gangs are integrating.) 
</P>
<P>
A purple bandanna hangs out of Khalil Collins' pants. "Put that rag in your 
pocket," Williams tells him. 
</P>
<P>
The group is escorted to the multipurpose room to register for classes. 
</P>
<P>
Later that day, Khalil's bandanna is back on display. It becomes the first of 
the term to be confiscated. 
</P>
<P>
The dismissal bell rings, and the children who had flooded in that morning flow 
back out. At the Blood gate, a girl rushes, agitated, up to a school policeman 
in plainclothes. Husky and bespectacled, his name is Calvin Bell. 
</P>
<P>
"Some Crips just come up and started messing with these little sixth-graders," 
the girl says, her words piling into each other. "The first day of school, Mr. 
Bell! 
</P>
<P>
"They called me a slob," she says. "Do I look like a slob?" 
</P>
<P>
"No, you don't," Bell says softly. "I'll check it out. You go on home." 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to make a Blood mad, you call him a slob," says Davita Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to make a Crip mad, you say E-ricket," Teewana Miller says. "Or 
they call you a crab. But we say that means, 'Crips Rule All Bloods.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Day Two. At 9:04 a.m., the public-address system crackles. In 72 classrooms, 
Kimbell's voice introduces Robert T. Thomas, assistant principal in charge of 
discipline. 
</P>
<P>
"Certain events occurred yesterday," Thomas begins. "Certain students wanted to 
start grouping, wanted to appear the big man, intimidating our new students. . 
. ." 
</P>
<P>
At lunchtime, some Crips had led about a dozen sixth-graders to tables where 
Bloods usually gather. Security aides stepped in to prevent a clash. 
</P>
<P>
"The three youngsters who wanted to be leaders, quote-unquote, are no longer 
with us," Thomas says. 
</P>
<P>
From this point on, he warns, "No wearing of colors, no showing of rags, red or 
blue. Boys, no earrings. Shoestrings: blue, red or purple -- not acceptable. No 
caps or hats and any other symbols that you thought of over the summer." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Principal's Warning 
</P>
<P>
Many of Pat Rice's seventh-graders gaze straight ahead. Others study their 
desktops. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, I want to tell you sixth-graders," Thomas continues. "We're going to make 
this a safe place for you to learn. If you are approached by anyone or any 
group, please let an adult know." 
</P>
<P>
He ends with a warning: "To you wannabees: Remain invisible." 
</P>
<P>
Later, Rice raises the subject with an eighth-grade English class. "I'm going 
to ask a question about Mr. Thomas and Mr. Kimbell's announcement. How many of 
you heard it?" 
</P>
<P>
Silence. 
</P>
<P>
She tells the class about one of her students last year who took bullets in 
both legs in a shoot-out at a pick-up football game at nearby Jordan High. She 
mentions her after-school helper, beaten last year on the way home because she 
had worn red, blue and purple all together. 
</P>
<P>
No one looks at Rice, but everyone is listening. In the back row sit two boys 
in khaki pants and white T-shirts. One boy nervously sticks a pen in his mouth, 
draws it out, sticks it back in again, over and over. The other sucks his 
thumb. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Teacher's Lecture 
</P>
<P>
"You cannot let these gangbanging people keep you from going to school and 
learning and going on with your life," Rice says, her voice rising. 
</P>
<P>
But it doesn't take long for gang tension to surface in her class. 
</P>
<P>
Eugene Kirk is short and slight, with close-cut hair and a deep voice. Dashonda 
Davis says she wants to be a nurse someday. They are friendly the first days of 
school; everyone who watches them thinks the friendship will ripen into 
romance. 
</P>
<P>
Then Eugene spoils it, reciting Grape Street slogans. He had been "courted in" 
during sixth grade with an after-school fight in the parking lot of a 
fried-chicken stand. He has a gang name, Gator. He claims to own a .22-caliber 
pistol. 
</P>
<P>
After school, he turns his black leather belt over, showing purple snakeskin. 
He plans to buy purple pants and a sweat shirt when he gets the money. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gang Affiliation 
</P>
<P>
This doesn't sit well with Dashonda. "I'm PJ," she says. The Grapes and the PJs 
don't get along despite a common affiliation with the Crips. 
</P>
<P>
Over the weeks, conversation between Eugene and Dashonda turns nasty. "Pissy 
J," Eugene whispers, showing disrespect for her set. "Peanut butter and jelly." 
</P>
<P>
"Fake Street," Dashonda responds. 
</P>
<P>
In math class, where the teacher has less control, their tiffs are even more 
disruptive. "In math," says Dashonda, "I never finish my assignments. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"(Today) I wrote 'PJ' on the floor real big. I wrote WVG and crossed it out. He 
pushed me and I slapped him." 
</P>
<P>
Eugene already has enough problems. He is trying to transfer out of gym class; 
he says it's full of Bloods wanting to fight. 
</P>
<P>
Now here comes Dashonda, saying to Eugene in front of her homeboys, "Didn't you 
say 'PJ Killer?' " 
</P>
<P>
He tells the girls from Grape Street how Dashonda is trying to get him beat up. 
He hopes they'll soon take care of her. 
</P>
<P>
Good things happen at Markham as well. The school won the prestigious citywide 
academic decathlon Super Quiz in 1987 and 1988; this year, 400 students tried 
out for 12 slots on the team. The health careers magnet program attracted 160 
students from around the city. The business of school -- grammar, algebra, 
music -- proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
But there are more troubles than triumphs. The attendance rate last year was 
just 79%; only 57% of last year's eighth-graders were eligible for graduation 
ceremonies. Test scores ranked well below the district average, except in the 
magnet school. And Markham ranked ninth among 64 junior high schools where 
district police reported incidents involving weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Gangs cannot be blamed for all of this. At least one Markham student, living in 
a garage, has done homework by candlelight. Others stay out of class to watch 
younger siblings while parents work, or because they are ashamed of their 
clothes. 
</P>
<P>
"If all of a sudden you just erased gangs and you brought (students) to school 
and you gave them the lessons, they would still go home to . . . problems," 
says Carol Wister, the eighth-grade counselor. "They would still not do as well 
as a student who comes from a nice middle-class home." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Difficulties Magnified 
</P>
<P>
There is no denying, though, that gangs magnify the difficulties by adding fear 
to the mix. 
</P>
<P>
On a classroom bulletin board, nine of 18 students list gangs as "what bugs me 
most about school." When a journalism teacher discusses editorials, three girls 
suggest writing one about gangs at Markham. "This is just getting out of hand," 
one says. 
</P>
<P>
Every move requires forethought. As simple a matter as staying after school, 
for clubs or teams or a talk with a teacher, can be dangerous at Markham. 
</P>
<P>
One day early in the term, for example, Michael Reardon and Frederick Johnson, 
who are brothers, decide to help a teacher with some chores. Michael cleans the 
blackboard; Frederick puts chairs on tables. 
</P>
<P>
They take only a few minutes, but that is time enough for the procession of 
other children to end, time enough for the gangbangers to run home and change 
into their colors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'They Have Guns' 
</P>
<P>
Heading home, to Fudgetown turf, the brothers see combatants on the railroad 
tracks, boys in red and boys in purple, throwing rocks and punches. A man tells 
the pair, "Don't go that way. They have guns." Michael and Frederick turn back. 
</P>
<P>
A security aide at the school unlocks a gate so they can call their mother for 
a ride. And Michael, a sixth-grader, says he won't stay late again, for any 
reason. 
</P>
<P>
Cousins Peter Casey and Gordon Terry leave on time each day with an escort. 
Their uncle, Frank Thompson, waits at the front entrance, his gangly, 
dark-suited frame a beacon of protection. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson started escorting his nephews after some Bloods threatened Gordon one 
day on the way home. Gordon wore a belt buckle with a "G" on it. The Bloods 
insisted it stood for Grape. 
</P>
<P>
This was a sign of trouble, and Thompson has had enough of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ex-Gang Member 
</P>
<P>
At 24, Thompson knows about gangs. He belonged to the Fruit Town Brims, a 
Bloods set, before becoming a Christian. Two years ago, Thompson's brother 
David, a Tustin minister, was shot to death in a South Los Angeles telephone 
booth. Three reputed gang members were charged in the killing. 
</P>
<P>
"I walk with (the two boys) so I can pray with them and so I can talk with them 
and so they feel safe," Thompson says. 
</P>
<P>
Most Markham students, however, don't have bodyguards. In December, Clinton 
Minnis, administrator in charge of Operation Safe Corridors, says, "I regret 
that we have not been able to get more people involved." 
</P>
<P>
He adds, "A lot of parents are a little bit afraid out there, too." 
</P>
<P>
Small-scale confrontations escalate. Four sixth-graders from Jordan Downs see 
some "red-shirt people" coming over the fence during gym class. One of the 
sixth-graders throws a Crip sign. The Bloods give chase. The sixth-graders seek 
help from older Grapes out on the railroad tracks. 
</P>
<P>
This is how new generations of gangbangers are born. "If this keeps up," says 
Williams, a former gang member himself, "somebody's gonna get dead." 
</P>
<P>
Williams and Goins want to hold a staff meeting. They say some security aides 
and teachers are using gang slogans or mentioning colors. They want 
administrators not to change students' schedules because of gang problems; 
segregating the gangs, the two believe, only makes things worse. 
</P>
<P>
They want to phone or visit families of gangbangers who cause trouble. They 
want a dress code. "The main thing," Williams says, "is the khakis, only 
because it's an intimidating factor. . . . Khakis is synonymous with Crips and 
Bloods." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Khakis No Fad 
</P>
<P>
Kimbell is floored. In his third year at Markham, he'd thought khakis were 
preppy. And sagging pants, why, that was a fad at Compton College when he went 
there in the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
Kimbell has been surprised before. He had to drop his habit of saying "A-OK," 
accompanied by the traditional gesture: circling the thumb and forefinger, 
leaving the other fingers upraised. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Kimbell," a student finally told him, "that means Blood." Without meaning 
to, he'd been "throwing" the sign. 
</P>
<P>
The teachers are still learning too. Their experiences are wildly divergent. 
</P>
<P>
One, who asks to remain anonymous, was punched in the back this fall term, his 
second year at Markham, when he tried to intervene after rival gang members 
chased some of his students into class. 
</P>
<P>
"It was hot. I had the door open. That was dumb. I won't do it again," the 
teacher says. 
</P>
<P>
Don Nelson, a former fabric shop manager in his first year of teaching, says 
his voice is hoarse at the end of each workday. He's been yelling for hours at 
his science students. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bleeding Girl 
</P>
<P>
He blames the gangs. "A girl's ear was bleeding and she was writing 'Blood' on 
her paper with her blood. She thought it was really cool. And kids are always 
slapping at each other over gangs," he says. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I tell the kids that the ones who misbehave are hurting their education," 
he says. " 'This guy's a goonbrain and you're not getting taught because of 
him,' I say." He says the gambit seems to work. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Alfee Enciso exerts control easily. In part because he teaches 
English this year in the magnet school. But he also has a tough reputation. He 
has chased gangbangers with a baseball bat. He tells kids who flash gang signs, 
"I'll break your arm." 
</P>
<P>
He is tall and thin, in coat and tie, sporting one tiny hoop earring. "I wear 
expensive clothes. I address the students as Mr. and Miss. I respect them," he 
says. "They should respect me." 
</P>
<P>
His latest crusade is for more after-school programs to give students an 
alternative to gangbanging. He coaches the academic decathlon team. He 
co-sponsors a football team. On the day of the first meeting, he fields lots of 
queries: "Are there going to be any Crips there?" "Are there going to be any 
Bloods there?" Yet 37 boys show up. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Little Punks' 
</P>
<P>
"People have to make a stand," Enciso says. "I know that one person, two 
people, three people can make a stand." 
</P>
<P>
Yvonne Hutchinson is one. She grew up in the neighborhood and graduated from 
Markham, returning to teach in 1966. She watched the rise of the gangs and 
never hesitates to say what she thinks: "They're little punks. They're 
quivering masses of jelly. They're fearful. . . . They're the scum of the 
Earth. They're trash." 
</P>
<P>
Her classes, she says proudly, would rather behave than hear her preach. One 
day after an anti-gang lecture, a student who missed the previous class flashed 
a sign. "Man, don't do that," a classmate says. "Don't do that. Please don't do 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Another time, Hutchinson and Enciso bought a paperback set of John Steinbeck's 
"The Pearl" to use in their classes. No problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I loaned the books to . . . a . . . beginning teacher," Hutchinson recalls. 
"My books came back. There are a lot of references in 'The Pearl' to blood and 
bleeding. Those little suckers went in and crossed out every reference to 
blood. We had to throw half the books out." 
</P>
<P>
Roger Babbitt wants out. A shy 13-year-old, he and his older sister transferred 
to Sutter Junior High School in Canoga Park when he was in sixth grade. He 
liked it. "The white people that go there, they have their little gangs, but it 
ain't like Crips and Bloods," he says. "They just bother the people that owe 
them money." 
</P>
<P>
He didn't mind getting up at 6:30 a.m. to catch the bus. But after school, it 
turned dark before the bus dropped Roger and his sister back at Imperial Courts 
projects, where they live. Someone snatched his sister's purse. 
</P>
<P>
In eighth grade this year, Roger knows he can get in trouble for friends he 
made back in the project. Some of his buddies were PJs, and that marked him as 
a target for Bloods and Grapes. 
</P>
<P>
He wants to return to Sutter. "(The buses) don't get back so late now," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
And he is trying to make arrangements for next year. "I'm never gonna go to 
Jordan," he says, echoing a sentiment popular among students from PJ and Blood 
neighborhoods. The high school is across from Jordan Downs, home of the Grapes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prays for Safety 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime at Markham, Roger says, "I ask God to watch over me so nobody 
will kill me." 
</P>
<P>
Autumn Ellis, on the other hand, is more lonely than frightened. 
</P>
<P>
She has plans to go to college and be a computer technician. They call her 
"Miss Fix-It" at home. 
</P>
<P>
She moved to Watts last year, from a part of town with little gang activity. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so stupid," she says of Markham's gangs. 
</P>
<P>
She ignores them. She makes the honor roll. "They call me a nerd," Autumn says. 
</P>
<P>
Her mother has told her the family probably will move again next year, away 
from the gangs. Autumn is more than willing to go. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Dalton, a "magnet girl" from Southwest Los Angeles, has problems with 
old friends. They took part in neighborhood plays her father, an actor, staged 
in Nickerson Gardens. At Markham, she's been shocked to find the same boys who 
wrote anti-gang scripts about pride have succumbed to the Bounty Hunters' 
allure. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, she tried to talk to them about it. An aspiring pediatrician, her 
grades faltered. Once, on the bus home, she started to cry. "I was just tired 
of black people fighting each other," she said. 
</P>
<P>
This year, she's given up on saving her friends. "I want to be a doctor, not a 
counselor," she says. 
</P>
<P>
In a conference room adjoining his office, Kimbell and his assistant principals 
agonize over the dress code. 
</P>
<P>
Parents, especially those on a welfare budget, would not be happy to hear that 
their children's blue shirts and red corduroys are unsuitable for school. What 
should Markham prohibit? 
</P>
<P>
"We ought to say flat out, the use of outfits that highlight red and blue 
colors," Jim Molina says. "And then every time a parent complains, deal with it 
on an individual basis." 
</P>
<P>
Lee Byrd thinks they need to be more general: ". . . That highlight gang 
colors," she says, writing on a note pad. 
</P>
<P>
But, what about California Raisins T-shirts, a new favorite of the Grapes? What 
about khaki pants? 
</P>
<P>
"What can a youngster wear? How can someone be neutral?" Kimbell asks. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe we should turn it into Markham Intermediate Nudist School," Cynthia 
Augustine suggests. 
</P>
<P>
That same day, in Rice's third period, Eugene wears his new purple jeans. 
Quintin Carroll -- who says he's a PJ in the projects but not at school -- is 
decked out in blue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Slang Slips Out 
</P>
<P>
Red sunglasses hang on the belt of a new boy, Robert Brooks. He leans over and 
says to a classmate, "Sharpen my pencil for me, Blood." The slang slips out 
before he is aware of it. 
</P>
<P>
He is overheard. 
</P>
<P>
About 10 minutes later, he gets nervous. In the middle of the lesson, Robert 
loudly complains, "They starin' at me." 
</P>
<P>
He says later, privately, that he has Bounty Hunter friends in Nickerson 
Gardens, but "I don't get in deep." 
</P>
<P>
Still, he says, "I'm going to let people know where I come from." And that 
means, he concedes, "I'm probably going to be fighting this year." 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to tell if he's involved in the melee that breaks out the next week. 
Dozens of children in a courtyard outside Don Nelson's class are suddenly 
punching and shoving. 
</P>
<P>
"It's over territory," eighth-grader Terrell James says, looking on. Nelson 
breaks up three fights. Security aides come running. 
</P>
<P>
Pandemonium continues into the next class. One girl mutters an insult to a 
teacher, who screams back: "What did you say to me?" A grinning girl in yellow 
pants runs in and out of classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Student Ousted 
</P>
<P>
Kimbell orders Hakim Lewis out of Nelson's room through the open door. The 
class loses interest in science. 
</P>
<P>
A teacher drops a pair of red shoestrings into Assistant Principal Thomas' 
outstretched hand. 
</P>
<P>
In the eighth-grade dean's office, a girl's slacks bear witness to an argument. 
Down a pant leg run ink scrawls: "PJ," then "BH" with the "H" crossed out and 
replaced with a "K," then "Slob." 
</P>
<P>
Another girl walks in and hands the dean, Doyle Iverson, a teacher's note. 
Iverson reads it aloud: "Andre Stewart walked out of class, waving a red 
scarf." 
</P>
<P>
Kimbell heads for the counselor's office, talking with Thomas over a 
walkie-talkie. Thomas recommends reassuring the students over the public 
address system. 
</P>
<P>
"You really think that's necessary?" Kimbell asks. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the feeling I'm getting," Thomas answers. "The emotional level is 
high." 
</P>
<P>
 Davita: "They need to get all the gangbangers out of the school. Let the kids 
that want to learn to do it without being distracted." 
</P>
<P>
 Teewana: "They should have a gang counselor. They should have kids talk to 
their own peers about stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Davita: "Young gangbangers, I will say this, they have time to stop and go to 
college because they're so young. 
</P>
<P>
 I tell them that.... But they will say, 'This is my life. I can mess it up if 
I want."' 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
By November, Andre Stewart stops wearing red. It happens after his mother is 
summoned to a talk with her son, Thomas, Williams and Goins. Overnight, his 
wardrobe changes to a mix of brown and gray. 
</P>
<P>
Derek Valenzuela, told he cannot come to Markham in red, decides he won't show 
up at all. He spends a few weeks at home in "the Nickersons." In khakis and a 
red belt, Derek rejects transfers, saying the other schools have too many 
Crips. But eventually a place for him is found in a San Fernando Valley school. 
</P>
<P>
Such changes are scored as victories at Markham. "It's a start," Williams says. 
</P>
<P>
But, as always, hope evaporates. Before Thanksgiving, disputes flare into 
fisticuffs on campus and after-school brawls down by the tracks. One day, 
Williams has to knock Eugene down to keep him from following older Grapes into 
battle. 
</P>
<P>
It takes two murders in the community to bring relief. On Nov. 22, a stranger 
is shot four times in the head across from nearby 102nd Street School, in full 
view of three kindergarten classes. 
</P>
<P>
In early December, a former Markham student, 10th-grader Tasu Odom, is killed 
in a drive-by shooting at a hamburger stand. One of Rice's students composes a 
poem about the boy. A former teacher's aide writes in a eulogy to be published 
in the school newspaper: "He worked very hard to stay away from drugs and 
gangs." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Funeral Delegation 
</P>
<P>
The campus calms. The morning of Dec. 16, the last day before Christmas break, 
a delegation of faculty and staff attends Tasu's funeral. The faculty holiday 
party is that afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
In January, the children return. Scuffles erupt anew. 
</P>
<P>
Kimbell arrives at work the last Monday of the month to find Blood slogans 
spray-painted in black across the bungalows near the gym. Until then, graffiti 
has been sporadic, small in scale, furtively marked in felt-tip or ballpoint 
pen. 
</P>
<P>
Kimbell assigns someone to come in at 5:30 a.m. every day to paint out 
graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
"The school district usually comes out within a day, but I don't even want it 
there that long," Kimbell says. "If someone from the opposite point of view 
sees it, they feel they have to respond." 
</P>
<P>
The anti-graffiti man starts his new shift Thursday as the semester draws to a 
close. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MARKHAM INTERMEDIATE: SCHOOL IN TURMOIL 
</P>
<P>
School name: Edwin Markham Intermediate School, named for the poet who wrote a 
tribute to the working class titled "The Man With the Hoe," sprawls across 24 
acres at 104th Street and Compton Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Attendance: Nearly 1,600 students attend the Watts school, along with 160 
students from other parts of the city who are enrolled in Markham's health 
careers magnet program. Last year, Markham had an attendance rate of 79%. 
</P>
<P>
Racial makeup: 63% black; 30% Latino. About 10% of the students have limited 
knowledge of English. 
</P>
<P>
Economic: More than 95% of the students come from families receiving Aid to 
Families with Dependent Children. Many come from the four housing projects that 
surround it -- Jordan Downs, Imperial Courts, Nickerson Gardens and Hacienda 
Village. 
</P>
<P>
Achievements: Won citywide academic decathlon Super Quiz in 1987 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Crime: During the 1987-88 school year, school district police reported 15 
incidents involving weapons, including 3 arrests. Of the incidents, 2 involved 
handguns, 6 knives, 1 a simulated weapon and 6 other weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Test Scores: On last year's California Assessment Program tests, Markham 
students scored well below state and district averages in all areas. Markham 
sixth-graders scored 174 on reading, compared to 228 for the average Los 
Angeles Unified School District student and 265 statewide. Markham 
eighth-graders scored 152 in math, compared to 220 for the district and 264 for 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MARKHAM: SCHOOL IN THE MIDDLE 
</P>
<P>
The campus of Markham Intermediate School sits on the dividing line between 
gang territories in Watts. Crips territory stretches to the east, past the 
Southern Pacific railroad tracks. Bloods claim the turf to the west. The school 
has been scene of several clashes.

U.S. BUREAUCRACY BLAMED IN CONFINED-SPACE DEATHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, Times Labor Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just before dawn on Dec. 5, a fellow worker found Dennis Claypool and Mark 
DeMoss lying dead on their backs in a large tanker-trailer they had been 
directed to clean at a trucking company 60 miles south of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The two young men had died in the same way as about 3,000 other workers in the 
last decade: by breathing unsafe air in enclosed work spaces. In this case, 
federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration officials have concluded 
that DeMoss, 18, and Claypool, 21, died because all the oxygen had been sucked 
out of the tanker during a chemical operation two days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Claypool's father, Philip, a Morris, Ill., carpenter, and occupational safety 
experts said the deaths of his son and DeMoss are symbolic of a striking 
failure by regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Every year, about 300 workers die in such incidents nationwide, and all of them 
die needlessly, according to John Moran, former director of safety research for 
the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many health and safety issues affecting the workplace, there is little 
disagreement over the need for federal standards to regulate work in what are 
referred to as "confined spaces." Some employer groups, as well as numerous 
unions, have been among those urging the government to adopt such standards. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, OSHA itself first acknowledged in 1975 the need to set safety 
standards for workers entering and working in confined spaces. 
</P>
<P>
That was 14 years ago, but standards still have not been issued. In the 
meantime, according to Moran's figures, more than 4,000 people have been 
asphyxiated, poisoned or died in explosions in boilers, sewers, refinery tanks, 
silos, airplane wings and other confined spaces. Many of those died trying to 
rescue their co-workers. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a clear example of the failure of OSHA to act in an area where people 
are getting killed," said Margaret Seminario, associate director of safety and 
health for the AFL-CIO. "It's such a clear hazard and there's no question that 
it's feasible to do something." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Outline Exists for 10 Years 
</P>
<P>
The formal outline of how federal OSHA could regulate "confined space" entries 
has existed since 1979, when NIOSH presented OSHA with a 68-page document 
describing the criteria for a standard. Since then, OSHA personnel have written 
several drafts but never took any action. 
</P>
<P>
Only a few days before Claypool and DeMoss died, OSHA finally finished its 
confined-space proposal and sent it to the Office of Management and Budget. The 
budget agency must approve the proposal before OSHA can formally present it for 
public hearings. 
</P>
<P>
A knowledgeable source in federal OSHA said the standard differs "very little" 
from the last major draft, completed in June, 1985. The source said that for 
the last three years Labor Department lawyers have been tinkering with the 
proposal and writing a lengthy preamble to the standard. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Seymour, OSHA's deputy for safety standards programs, acknowledged that 
confined-space deaths are a "serious problem" and that federal regulations are 
"long overdue." 
</P>
<P>
It should not have taken so long to get a standard written, Seymour said in a 
telephone interview. "Part of the problem (for the delay) has been priorities," 
he said, indicating that the agency considered other issues more pressing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Administration Opposition 
</P>
<P>
But union representatives and other safety and health officials asserted that 
much of the delay was due to the stated philosophical opposition of the Reagan 
Administration to adopting more regulations. "This reflects the Reagan 
Administration's knee-jerk, anti-regulation outlook which has obstructed all 
OSHA rule-making," said Frank Mirer, the United Auto Workers' health and safety 
director. 
</P>
<P>
Confined-space deaths are hardly a matter of concern only to union officials 
and safety engineers. At least some elements of corporate America say they have 
urged OSHA to act. 
</P>
<P>
"People are dying every year; industries recognize that," said Jo Anne 
Linhardt, a safety expert for Organization Resources Counselors Inc., a 
Washington-based consulting firm that gives professional assistance to numerous 
Fortune 500 companies. 
</P>
<P>
She said her organization had sent suggestions to federal OSHA on what should 
be in a confined space standard, as have several unions and professional safety 
groups, including the Water Pollution Control Federation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Characteristics Listed 
</P>
<P>
A "confined space" is described by occupational safety experts as a space with 
any of the following characteristics: 
</P>
<P>
* Small openings for entry and exit. 
</P>
<P>
* Unfavorable natural ventilation. 
</P>
<P>
* An area not designed for continuous worker occupancy. 
</P>
<P>
The two most commonly occurring hazards in confined spaces, according to Moran, 
are oxygen deficiency and potentially explosive conditions created by the 
presence of methane gas. The deaths generally occur when a worker enters a 
confined space not knowing that there is a lack of oxygen or that the air is 
pervaded by toxic chemicals that can swiftly be fatal. The recent Illinois case 
appears to be a classic example, as was an incident in Burbank in 1981 when two 
city workers were overcome by hydrogen sulfide gas when they entered a manhole, 
unaware of the hazard. 
</P>
<P>
In the Illinois case, there was insufficient oxygen in the tanker that Claypool 
and DeMoss entered because, two days earlier, a chemical company had used 
nitrogen to remove a shipment of dodane, a liquid used in making detergent, 
from the tanker, according to state and federal officials. Nitrogen, an 
odorless, colorless gas, sucks oxygen out of the air. There was no sign on the 
tanker warning that breathing could be difficult, according to a wrongful death 
suit filed by Claypool's parents. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most tragic aspect of the confined-space problem is that the vast 
majority of the calamities involve multiple fatalities. Generally at least one 
would-be rescuer perishes, as well as the original victim, according to 
government studies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Five Men Die 
</P>
<P>
For example, last June five young men died in a confined-space incident at 
Bastian Plating, a small company in Auburn, Ind. They were asphyxiated by 
hydrogen cyanide gas, which was created when Jeff Link was cleaning a 
5-foot-deep tank. Four of Link's colleagues died from the same fumes while 
trying to rescue him. Craig Fogle, 19, was the last. 
</P>
<P>
Fogle's mother, Brenda, a waitress, is now campaigning to get a federal law 
passed in hope that such tragedies will not recur. "The four boys tried to save 
the first one," she said. "It was such a waste." 
</P>
<P>
Ted Tomczak, a federal OSHA official who has been working on the confined-space 
issue for almost five years, goes further. "The core of the problem is 
rescues," he said. "To lose additional people trying to make an impossible 
rescue -- that borders on criminal." 
</P>
<P>
Moran agreed. He said that NIOSH's division of safety research did detailed 
investigation of 39 confined-space incidents from 1984 to 1987. The 
investigations took place in 17 states, ranging from California to Vermont, and 
covered a wide range of industries, including tanker trucks, aerospace and 
waste water treatment. 
</P>
<P>
The research revealed that 31% of the companies at which incidents occurred had 
written confined-space entry procedures but that none of the companies had used 
them. Only 15% of the companies had trained their workers on confined-space 
hazards; none of the companies had a rescue plan; 43% of the victims were 
would-be rescuers; 95% of the entries had been authorized by supervisors and 
29% of those who died were supervisors. None of the spaces were evaluated or 
tested (for oxygen or chemical content) before entry and none of the spaces 
were ventilated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deaths Were Avoidable 
</P>
<P>
"None of these fatalities would have occurred if the NIOSH confined-spaces 
recommendations in the 1979 criteria document had been followed," Moran said. 
</P>
<P>
And reports of individual NIOSH investigations describe a series of grim 
incidents: "Three sanitation workers and one policeman die in an an underground 
sewage pumping station in Kentucky"; "Truck driver suffocates in sawdust bin in 
Pennsylvania"; "Two workers die in underground valve pit in Oklahoma"; 
"Insufficient oxygen level in sewer claims the life of plumbing contractor in 
Georgia," and on and on. 
</P>
<P>
In their defense, federal OSHA officials said that they have not been powerless 
to respond to these tragic incidents. In numerous instances, they have cited 
employers responsible for confined-space deaths by using the "general duty 
clause," a catchall provision of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act 
designed to plug holes in instances where there has been a fatality or a 
serious life-threatening hazard. 
</P>
<P>
For example, federal OSHA's Long Beach office cited Continental Truck Wash on 
South Central Avenue and fined the company after a worker was killed there in 
an explosion on Nov. 10, 1987, while cleaning a truck tank that had recently 
contained aviation fuel. The fine was $1,400. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Wright, health and safety director of the United Steelworkers of 
America, one of the unions most actively advocating enactment of a 
confined-space standard, said that general duty clause citations were better 
than no action at all. However, he said that such citations are tougher to 
sustain, if challenged in court, than citations based on a specific standard, 
such as one regulating the amount of airborne asbestos that can be present in a 
workplace. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Primarily Punitive 
</P>
<P>
More importantly, Wright said, general duty clause citations are primarily a 
punitive tool rather than a preventive tool. He said that inspectors "rarely" 
are able to issue such citations on a routine inspection before an accident 
occurs. "They're generally used after serious accidents," which is important, 
he said. "But the whole purpose of OSHA is to prevent the accident, not just to 
penalize someone afterward. . . . I can't understand why it's taken them so 
long to write a standard." 
</P>
<P>
OSHA's Tomczak said the process of drawing up the proposed confined-space 
standard had been long and "very frustrating." He said he could not provide a 
copy of the proposed standard until it had been cleared by the Office of 
Management and Budget. However, he was willing to describe some of its 
components. 
</P>
<P>
"We are demanding that the employer have a program to identify the (confined) 
spaces, identify hazards, evaluate their severity, determine proper controls 
for all the hazards, entry procedures, training and permits," Tomczak said. 
</P>
<P>
The reason for having a written permit, he said, is to make sure that the entry 
has been authorized and that all the proper procedures have been followed. 
Tomczak said such a system was designed to ensure that "in case something goes 
wrong, everyone knows what to do, where to go for help and how to get the 
people out of the space." 
</P>
<P>
Charles Conner, director of safety for the Los Angeles County Sanitation 
District, also said it would be useful to have a federal standard that provided 
clear criteria on how confined-space entries should be handled. Conner said the 
use of proper safety procedures and good training of employees could vastly cut 
down these deaths. He said there were no confined-space deaths among county 
sanitation district workers in the last decade, even though waste water 
treatment work is quite hazardous. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Discussion Set Monday 
</P>
<P>
Officials of OSHA and the Office of Management and Budget will meet in 
Washington on Monday to have their first formal discussion of the proposal. 
OSHA's Seymour said there already are indications that OMB will oppose a major 
component of OSHA's proposal -- the requirement of a written permit system -- 
creating the clear possibility of further delay. Still, he said, he is hopeful 
that the proposal will be cleared by OMB "before summer" and that it can go 
into effect later in the year. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Claypool continues to grieve and has formed an organization called 
You're Not Forgotten, designed to provide moral support to the family members 
of victims of industrial accidents. "No one should have to go through what 
we're going through," said Claypool, referring both to his family's mourning 
and OSHA's failure to act. 
</P>
<P>
Claypool has been given moral support by Joseph Kinney, president of the 
Chicago-based National Safe Workplace Institute, an organization Kinney formed 
in 1987 after his brother died in a scaffolding accident. Kinney asserted that 
the long delay in enacting a confined space standard showed how the goal of 
improving workplace safety and health in this country had been perverted into 
an "abstract exercise in law and economics" by some government officials who 
set certain litmus tests that had to be met for regulations to go into effect. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's bias things in favor of safety and work backwards, rather than the 
opposite, which is what is done now," Kinney said. "If George Bush wants to 
make this a 'kinder and gentler nation,' one thing he could do is to get 
confined-space regulations enacted as soon as possible."

GANGS, CRIME TOP FEARS OF VIETNAMESE IN ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE EMMONS and DAVID REYES, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County's Vietnamese community -- one of the largest outside Southeast 
Asia -- sees gangs and crime as its worst problems and assistance in learning 
English as its greatest need. 
</P>
<P>
A sampling of the county's estimated 100,000 Vietnamese residents suggests that 
nearly two-thirds of them perceive at least some anti-Vietnamese prejudice 
here, although most say that they have not experienced it personally. On the 
subject of quality of life, 54% say their lives in Orange County are going 
"very well," and another 42% say they are going "somewhat well." 
</P>
<P>
These are among the findings of the most recent Times Orange County Poll, a 
survey of opinions and attitudes in the county's Vietnamese community. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Somewhat Insular 
</P>
<P>
The poll paints a picture of a somewhat insular community, where Vietnamese is 
the main language in 83% of the households, 76% of the population still has 
contact with friends and relatives in Vietnam and 61% spend their money mainly 
in Vietnamese stores and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a community with surprisingly strong ties to the people and traditions 
of their homeland," said Mark Baldassare, the UC Irvine professor whose firm 
conducted the poll. "It's also a community with little consensus about future 
relations with Vietnam or the course of assimilation here in the United States. 
Fears of victimization by fellow Vietnamese and of discrimination by whites 
dominate the concerns of this group." 
</P>
<P>
Those surveyed were almost evenly divided on whether renewing U.S. diplomatic 
ties with Vietnam would have a good effect on Vietnamese residents in this 
country. They also were nearly evenly split on whether they would visit Vietnam 
if relations between the two nations were to be normalized. 
</P>
<P>
"That's surprising," Baldassare said. "This is perhaps the most heated subject 
in the Vietnamese community today. To some extent, it's a political issue, but 
I think it's also a personal issue. Some members of the community see benefits 
of future ties while others cannot forget the past." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Findings 
</P>
<P>
Among the other findings of the poll: 
</P>
<P>
* Slightly more than half of those surveyed disapproved of the recent decision 
to lower the quota on Vietnamese refugees coming into the United States so that 
more Soviet refugees could immigrate here. More than one-quarter, however, 
favored continuing some sort of immigration restrictions on Vietnamese 
refugees. 
</P>
<P>
* Eight in 10 said they believe that, given the same grades, Vietnamese and 
white students have an equal chance for college admission. 
</P>
<P>
* Close to two-thirds said their households strongly adhere to Vietnamese 
customs and traditions, and another 35% said they adhere "somewhat." 
</P>
<P>
* Almost half said the children in their families are not expected to marry 
someone who is Vietnamese.

<P>
The Times Orange County Poll of 400 adult residents was conducted Jan. 21-26 by 
Mark Baldassare &amp; Associates of Irvine. The poll has a margin of error of 
plus or minus 5%. 
</P>
<P>
Those surveyed were asked what they thought was "the most serious problem 
facing the Vietnamese people in Orange County today." No answer was suggested 
in the interviews. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concern on Gangs, Crime 
</P>
<P>
Forty-one percent volunteered that gangs and crime constitute the biggest 
problems, and the concern was uniform regardless of age, income level or length 
of residency in the United States. The only variance was by gender; 50% of 
women considered gangs and crime the most serious problems, compared to 31% of 
men. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the most significant findings of this poll," Baldassare said. 
"When you find 4 out of 10 mentioning it, it's quite clearly a pressing problem 
in the Vietnamese community. The issue of crime and gangs in Orange County as a 
whole is not ever noted as a serious problem by more than 10% of the population 
(in other polls)." 
</P>
<P>
Said one Vietnamese resident who requested anonymity: "We have a tremendous 
problem with gang members. They extort money. At the restaurants, they eat 
free. The owners complain to other Vietnamese but don't tell police. If they 
tell, the police make arrests, but when these gang members get out on bail, the 
restaurant has trouble later. 
</P>
<P>
"In Vietnam we would have put them in jail already. We had secret police who 
could do that. We need them here. I know the law says you cannot stop them and 
that this is a free country, but they know that, too. That's why it's hard for 
police to stop them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Police Protection 
</P>
<P>
Despite the expressed concern about gangs and crime, the desire for better 
police protection was far down the list of what those who were interviewed 
thought were "government programs . . . most needed for the Vietnamese people 
living in Orange County." Only 17% listed police protection as the greatest 
need. 
</P>
<P>
Employment and business development programs were mentioned by 25% of those 
asked about the biggest needs of the Vietnamese community, but the largest 
single segment -- 33% -- said English language classes were the greatest need. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how much prejudice there is against Vietnamese people in Orange County, 
23% of those surveyed answered "a lot" and another 39% answered "some" -- a 
total of 62%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HOW THE POLL WAS CONDUCTED 
</P>
<P>
The Times Orange County Poll was conducted by Mark Baldassare &amp; Associates 
of Irvine, which interviewed 400 Vietnamese adults by telephone Jan. 21 to 26. 
Those surveyed were given a choice of being interviewed in English or 
Vietnamese. 
</P>
<P>
An equal number of men and women were interviewed in households selected at 
random throughout Orange County from telephone listings of common Vietnamese 
names. The sample reflects the age and geographic distribution of Vietnamese 
households in Orange County. The margin of error for a sample of this size is 
plus or minus 5%.

SHEVARDNADZE IN PAKISTAN FOR TALKS ON AFGHAN PEACE SETTLEMENT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In an 11th-hour attempt to reach a compromise in the growing crisis in 
Afghanistan, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze arrived in this 
diplomatically strategic capital early today for a day of meetings with 
Pakistani officials and, possibly, leaders of the Pakistan-based Afghan 
resistance. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze is the first Soviet foreign minister to visit Pakistan in more 
than two decades, and Pakistan has been the staunchest supporter of the Afghan 
guerrillas who have battled the Soviets for nine bloody years. 
</P>
<P>
At an airport press conference, he declined to tell reporters whether he was 
bringing new proposals to end the strife once the Soviet troops have gone home, 
according to news reports. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviet leadership has decided to consult with the government of Pakistan 
on how best to contribute to restoring peace and tranquility in Afghanistan," 
Shevardnadze said on arrival from Beijing, where he went to help arrange the 
first Sino-Soviet summit in 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
There are many problems between Pakistan and the Soviet Union, he conceded. 
</P>
<P>
"The most acute problem, of which you will be aware, is that of Afghanistan. I 
will be having intense negotiations with the foreign minister," he said, 
referring to his Pakistani counterpart, Sahabzada Yaqub Khan, who was seated 
next to him. 
</P>
<P>
Yaqub Khan also declined to say whether new proposals were likely to come from 
Pakistan in Shevardnadze's talks, which will include a meeting with Prime 
Minister Benazir Bhutto. 
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin official's meetings today are seen as the climax of a weeklong 
international effort to bring Afghanistan's warring factions together as the 
Soviet Union withdraws the last of its 115,000 troops in the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
Pakistani and Western analysts in Islamabad, however, said the visit may end up 
largely symbolic. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Afghan resistance, known as the moujahedeen, disagree completely 
from the Soviet-backed government of Afghan President Najibullah on the key 
issue of who should rule Afghanistan after the Soviets end their military 
involvement there. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the moujahedeen have insisted that Najibullah's ruling People's 
Democratic Party of Afghanistan be wholly purged from the government in Kabul 
before they agree to end the war. 
</P>
<P>
Najibullah himself was just as forceful in a press conference Thursday, saying, 
"No one can ignore the existence of the People's Democratic Party as a major 
power in Afghanistan, and it cannot be excluded (from a coalition government)." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the Soviet foreign minister's visit, one Western diplomat here 
said, "If Mr. Shevardnadze is still insisting on the PDPA, then it's just a 
non-starter." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Shevardnadze's meetings with Pakistani officials, which follow a week of 
intensive diplomatic efforts in Islamabad that included visits by officials 
from two other key moujahedeen benefactors -- Iran and Saudi Arabia, could help 
solve an even more critical impasse in the war -- the issue of arms supplies to 
the warring Afghan groups. 
</P>
<P>
As an adjunct of the Geneva accords signed last April providing for the Soviet 
troop withdrawal, the United States and the Soviet Union tacitly agreed to 
continue furnishing arms to the two sides, an understanding that has become 
known as "positive symmetry." 
</P>
<P>
Last week alone, Najibullah's regular army in Kabul has received large 
shipments of Soviet rockets and missiles to help his government survive an 
expected moujahedeen offensive, and eyewitnesses on the Pakistani-Afghan border 
have seen equally large arms shipments being taken by truck and pack mule in to 
the rebels, who so far in the conflict have received a total of about $2 
billion worth of U.S.-supplied arms under a covert CIA operation aimed largely 
at driving the Soviets out of Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, the moujahedeen's biggest benefactor, has been the conduit for the 
arms shipments, which have been coordinated by Pakistani military intelligence. 
Several Pakistani officials speculated that Shevardnadze may have with him a 
proposal for "negative symmetry," which would ban future arms supplies to 
either side. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze's visit comes at a critical moment for the divided moujahedeen 
leadership, which is trying to form a shura, or "national parliament," on 
Friday to claim leadership after the Soviets leave. But guerrilla leaders are 
split over composition of the shura. 
</P>
<P>
In his meetings today, Shevardnadze is expected to repeat Soviet demands that 
the shura include members of Najibullah's ruling party, a demand that rebel 
leaders have flatly rejected. The only compromise offered by the moujahedeen is 
the allocation of seats to what the rebels call "good Muslims" now in key 
positions inside Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
In related developments, British and French diplomats left Kabul on Saturday 
after their nations closed their embassies, joining an exodus of Western 
countries. Britain's 19 embassy staff members and the four French Embassy 
workers flew aboard a chartered plane to New Delhi and arrived there Saturday 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
Also leaving Kabul on Saturday was a convoy of about 40 Soviet military 
vehicles. On Friday, a huge column of tanks, armored personnel carriers and 
trucks slipped out under cover of darkness and headed up the Salang Highway, 
the only surface route between Kabul and the Soviet border. 
</P>
<P>
The chief Soviet negotiator on Afghanistan said Saturday that Soviet troops 
would complete their withdrawal within four days, well ahead of the Feb. 15 
deadline called for under the U.N.-mediated Geneva accords, Iran's official 
news agency IRNA reported. 
</P>
<P>
"Soviet forces are due to leave Afghan territory within four days," IRNA quoted 
First Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli M. Vorontsov as telling reporters in Tehran, 
where he is to meet with an Iran-based coalition of eight Afghan rebel groups 
as well as Iranian officials to discuss the Afghan situation.

A citizens group organized by Solidarity leader Lech Walesa nominated 13 people 
Saturday to be on a negotiating team for historic reconciliation talks with the 
government beginning Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The 128-member citizens committee, created Dec. 18 as a link between Solidarity 
and the communist government, also suggested nine subject areas for discussion 
at the talks, with the re-legalization of the banned Solidarity union heading 
the list. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen commissions of the citizens group have been meeting to formulate a plan 
of action for the talks aimed at working out social, economic and political 
reforms in a country facing a staggering $38-billion foreign debt, obsolete and 
inefficient industry and rampant inflation. 
</P>
<P>
The 13 nominations submitted Saturday must be approved today by the 
policy-making Solidarity National Commission, which will name Solidarity's 
representatives to the unprecedented talks. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Walesa, they are expected to include Jacek Kuron and Adam Michnik, both 
of whom had been initially rejected by the government. 
</P>
<P>
In the talks, 57 people, among them about 25 from opposition groups, including 
Solidarity, will sit down together Monday with representatives of the 
government, the Communist Party and the Roman Catholic Church. 
</P>
<P>
Both the government and Solidarity have said they recognize that a plan of 
action must be worked out to avoid more industrial unrest, or even worse.

SOVIETS, CHINESE DIFFER ON THE DATE FOR SUMMIT 
</P>

<P>
A new era of improved Sino-Soviet relations got off to a shaky start Saturday 
with conflicting statements by high Soviet and Chinese officials on whether the 
two sides have agreed on mid-May as the date for the first Sino-Soviet summit 
in 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze announced at a Beijing press 
conference Saturday: "We agreed on the date of the forthcoming Soviet-Chinese 
summit. The visit of (President) Mikhail (S.) Gorbachev to the Chinese People's 
Republic will take place in mid-May of this year." 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze went to the airport immediately after the press conference, and 
minutes after his plane was in the air, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Tian 
Zengpei contradicted him. 
</P>
<P>
The mid-May date is "a time frame proposed by the Soviet side," Tian told 
reporters at the airport. "But with regard to the specific timing of such a 
summit, it has yet to be decided. . . . The Chinese side wishes to study the 
time frame proposed by the Soviet Union and is ready to have consultations with 
the Soviet Union about the specific time." 
</P>
<P>
The two sides had announced Friday that China invited Gorbachev here for a 
summit meeting and that the Soviets had accepted. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's confusion did not appear to affect the basic accord that there will 
be a summit between Gorbachev and China's senior leader, Deng Xiaoping. But it 
was not clear whether Shevardnadze overstated the firmness of the mid-May date, 
or Tian was misinformed or China had some other motive for contradicting 
Shevardnadze. 
</P>
<P>
Possible motives for China to say that the time has not been firmly fixed could 
include a desire to maintain Soviet uncertainty about the summit and thus boost 
Beijing's leverage during talks about settlement of the conflict in Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev has actively sought a summit meeting, but Soviet support for 
Vietnam's decade-long intervention in Cambodia has been a key obstacle to 
improved Sino-Soviet ties. China has supported a Cambodian resistance coalition 
and demanded that Vietnam withdraw its troops from the country. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union and China have reached agreement on many issues concerning 
Cambodia, and both now advocate that Vietnam withdraw its troops by September. 
</P>
<P>
But in his airport talk with reporters, Tian said that China hopes the Soviet 
Union will make further efforts to facilitate a Cambodian settlement. Tian said 
that China still hopes the Soviet Union will agree that the Phnom Penh 
government should be disbanded as part of a political settlement and replaced 
with a provisional government of national reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Soviets Oppose Peacekeepers 
</P>
<P>
China also wants the United Nations to assign a peacekeeping force to guarantee 
any political settlement in Cambodia, but the Soviet Union has not agreed to 
this. 
</P>
<P>
Another possible motive for China to speak uncertainly about the date for the 
summit could be questions about Deng's health. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze met Deng in Shanghai on Saturday morning, and the 84-year-old 
Chinese leader appeared to be in good health. Some foreign press reports have 
said that China favors an early summit date because of concern about Deng's 
health. There have also been reports that Deng has a prostate problem. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze said Saturday that the summit meeting -- and the normalization of 
relations between the two Communist powers that it would achieve -- should 
contribute to economic development in both countries. 
</P>
<P>
"Let me emphasize that we are speaking of a complete normalization of our 
relations," he said. "When we speak of the norm for two great powers, for two 
permanent members of the United Nations' Security Council that have a lengthy 
common border, when we speak of two socialist countries, it is obvious that we 
have in mind a very high norm." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union looks forward to "a more large-scale and more efficient 
cooperation in the economy, trade, scientific research and development, and 
also in tackling environmental problems, which . . . have become rather acute. 
. . ." he added.

SHE BELIEVES DOG IS TELLING (THAT'S RIGHT) THE TRUTH

<TEXT>
<P>
When philanthropist Joan Kroc tries to find the owner of a lost dog, she 
doesn't just tack up a flyer on the neighborhood telephone pole. 
</P>
<P>
First, she sends the dog to an animal therapist to tap the canine's 
consciousness. Then, convinced the dog is truly homesick, she places ads in 
newspapers and offers a $100 reward for assistance in reuniting dog with 
master. 
</P>
<P>
The dog is a German shepherd-labrador mix. And this story is a cross between 
Disney and Donahue. 
</P>
<P>
Kroc, of course, has a bent for altruism. She has given $10 million to help 
build a hospice, $6 million to Notre Dame's International Institute for Peace 
Studies, $3.3 million to improve animal exhibits at the San Diego Zoo and $1 
million each for Ethiopian famine relief, for St. Jude's Childrens Hospital in 
Memphis and for the Democratic party. 
</P>
<P>
Now she's made up her mind to get Boots back home. 
</P>
<P>
Kroc saw the mutt outside a Rancho Santa Fe restaurant last November, bloodied 
and ragged. 
</P>
<P>
First she took Boots to her home. Then to a vet. Then, she took Boots to an 
animal therapist so the dog could tell her tale of woe. Convinced that Boots 
wants to go home, Kroc now has placed ads in San Diego newspapers offering a 
$100 reward for information that will reunite Boots with her master. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wary at First 
</P>
<P>
Kroc admits she was wary about taking Boots to meet with animal therapist 
Samantha Khury of Escondido, who has made a name for herself in the business of 
communicating with animals. She meets with six animals a day; some are regular 
clients who receive maintenance therapy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a mystery, and animals can't speak and I know that, but maybe in some way 
they can communicate with her," Kroc said. 
</P>
<P>
Kroc, the owner of the San Diego Padres baseball team and the widow of 
McDonald's fast-food empire founder Ray Kroc, had taken Boots to Khury to try 
to better understand why the dog was trying to run away from her Fairbanks 
Ranch estate in northern San Diego County. It's a wonderful home even for 
purebreds -- what with the fountain to romp in and all that grass -- so why was 
Boots the stray trying to run away? 
</P>
<P>
Khury had the answer after her meeting with Boots, face-to-face, or something 
like that. 
</P>
<P>
"The animal told me she misses her owner very much, that they had spent a lot 
of time together. She talked a lot about him," Khury said. 
</P>
<P>
Boots recalled falling out of a bright-colored pickup truck on either a 
Saturday or a holiday -- Boots knew it was so, because her owner wasn't 
following his normal work schedule, Khury said. 
</P>
<P>
"She tried to find her owner, but couldn't. She started hunting. Nobody wanted 
to touch or feed her until Mrs. Kroc came along," Khury said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Talk to the Animals 
</P>
<P>
Khury understood all this, she said, because she has an ability to communicate 
with animals, whether they be kittens or thoroughbred race horses. Sometimes, 
in extreme cases, Khury can simply see the animal's emotions in its eyes. 
Sometimes, for instance, an animal cries and, hey, how hard can it be to figure 
there's some grief here? 
</P>
<P>
Boots wasn't so easy to peg, though, because she was enjoying her life with 
Kroc. Still, she missed home even more, Khury said. 
</P>
<P>
Kroc might not have been so believing about Boots' story, Khury admits, if it 
hadn't been for the fact that Boots related the entire rescue episode to her 
during the therapy session -- of how Kroc picked her up and put her in a car, 
then took her home, then put her in a pickup truck and took her to a vet. These 
were facts that Kroc herself hadn't told Khury. But Khury told of the sequence 
of events to Kroc, and it all jibed. Hmmm. 
</P>
<P>
So then, why can't Khury simply put a map in front of Boots and let the two 
figure out where home is? Don't be silly, Khury says. Dogs can't spell or read.

A person already can buy a handgun in 16 of Nevada's mostly rural counties with 
no questions asked except "Do you want bullets with that?" police say. But 
officials in holdout Clark County are fighting a proposal by Assemblyman Danny 
Thompson (D-Henderson) to invalidate the local government's handgun control 
ordinances and give the state sole authority to regulate firearm sales, 
transfers, ownership and registration. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson said Friday he is seeking "uniformity in the law. Clark County is the 
only place in the state . . . with gun restrictions. I'm in favor of the idea 
that I have a right to bear arms no matter where I'm at in the state." 
</P>
<P>
But Clark County Sheriff's Capt. Paul Conner said if Thompson's proposal is 
approved, the result would be no gun control at all. 
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old ordinance in Nevada's largest county requires that guns be 
registered and imposes a 72-hour waiting period on first-time handgun buyers. 
The ordinance also prevents convicted felons, fugitives, narcotics sellers, 
"habitual drunkards," the insane and organized crime members, among others, 
from buying a handgun.

STARS STOP SOCKERS IN OVERTIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
TACOMA, Wash. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are two constants when the Sockers meet the Tacoma Stars: The game will 
be close, and it will be physical. 
</P>
<P>
So it was Saturday night at the Tacoma Dome. The Stars won the Major Indoor 
Soccer League game, 4-3, when Preki ripped in a 45-footer with his left foot at 
3:00 of the second overtime before 8,868. 
</P>
<P>
Godfrey Ingram got the assist with a perfect square pass from the right boards. 
</P>
<P>
Thus Tacoma, with a penchant for losing the close ones, ended its streak of 
one-goal losses at six against the last team it beat that way. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers fell to 13-12, failing for the third consecutive game to get Ron 
Newman his 500th career coaching victory. Tacoma (12-14) is back in fifth place 
and in the playoff hunt. 
</P>
<P>
Tacoma had the best of the early part of the overtime, but a couple of saves by 
Victor Nogueira of high drives by Preki and Ingram kept the Stars at bay. 
</P>
<P>
From the beginning of this game, the battle lines were apparent: Branko Segota 
versus the world. 
</P>
<P>
Segota started exchanging words with Tacoma's Neil Megson early, then jawed at 
the Stars' Gregg Blasingame and finally exchanged elbows with Tacoma's Bill 
Crook early in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, at 4:41, he tripped Blasingame to draw 2 minutes, and the 
Stars scored the go-ahead goal on a power play at 5:26. Ingram nicely slid a 
diagonal pass just in front of Nogueira, and Peter Ward flicked it in at the 
far post. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers tied it at 3-3 at 11:42 when Cacho's drive hit the crossbar and the 
rebound fell at the feet of Alan Willey, who finished it with a slide volley. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers' first lead was at 2-1, 43 seconds into the second half. Rookie 
Paul Wright, on right wing on a two-on-one break, took Cacho's pass on the run. 
Tacoma goalkeeper P.J. Johns came out, but Wright shot past him and inside the 
far post for his first MISL goal. 
</P>
<P>
Tacoma tied it 2-2 at 2:45 when Andy Schmetzer swiped an outlet pass from 
Nogueira that was intended for Gus Mokalis. Schmetzer's low drive from right 
wing was inside the far post. 
</P>
<P>
In a 1-1 first half, Tacoma scored first at 1:08 of the second quarter on a bit 
of magic created by Preki. 
</P>
<P>
The Stars midfielder blew past Chris Chueden on right wing and squared a pass 
to the feet of Schmetzer on the run. Schmetzer's low drive from 35 feet was 
just inside the near post. 
</P>
<P>
The Socks tied it at 9:45 on a power-play goal by Paul Dougherty after Tacoma 
was whistled for its sixth foul. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Zungul headed a ball through the box that Dougherty half-volleyed off the 
far post and in. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers then thwarted a Stars power play after Sockers' sixth foul, though 
a shot by Preki hit the post. 
</P>
<P>
Though there was no score in the physical early going, both Johns and Nogueira 
were called upon to make saves often in the first 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Johns choked off a one-on-one by Socker defender George Fernandez in the box 
and stopped rockets by Ralf Wilhelms and Mokalis. 
</P>
<P>
Nogueira saved shots by Preki and Star midfielder Nikki Ristic. 
</P>
<P>
Sockers Notes 
</P>
<P>
Socker Coach Ron Newman picked up a yellow card for dissent early in the 
overtime. . . . The Sockers played without Brian Quinn and Zoran Karic, who 
came down with a bruised right foot. Rookie Paul Wright played in place of 
Karic up front. . . . Tacoma radio broadcaster Dick Calvert will originate a 
veteran radio broadcast from the MISL All-Star game in Dallas, but XTRA (690 
AM), the Sockers' outlet, has no plans to carry the game, according to Sockers 
broadcaster Randy Hahn. . . . Steve Zungul received hoots and jeers for the 
Tacoma crowd in his first game here since leaving the Stars after last season.

MURPHY OFF TARGET BUT MOORPARK HITS MARK IN 79-59 WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Just when Steve Murphy was about to etch his name into the Moorpark College 
record book, Murphy's Law intervened. 
</P>
<P>
And everything that could go wrong did. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy, who was chasing Steve Ornelaz's record for consecutive free throws, 
stepped to the line with 13:23 remaining in Moorpark's 79-59 Western State 
Conference victory over Glendale on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy had made 25 free throws in a row over an 8-game span -- 2 shy of 
Ornelaz's mark of 27 set during the 1978-79 season. But Murphy had not shot a 
free throw in nearly 3 games, and he was feeling the pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't say it wasn't on my mind when I went to the line," Murphy said. 
"Everyone looked at me and kind of winked." 
</P>
<P>
Murphy bounced the ball twice, set, then swished the first free throw to give 
the Raiders a 50-40 lead. He followed the same procedure for the second shot, 
but it was long and off to the right. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt comfortable, but I knew when I released it, it was off to the right," 
Murphy said. "It had to end somewhere. I guess I'll start a new streak now." 
</P>
<P>
Eleven seconds later, Murphy fouled Glendale's Justin Lord and was whistled for 
a technical foul when he complained about the call. He eventually fouled out 
with 4:11 to play, after scoring 3 points. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy was about the only Raider who didn't have a good night. Moorpark (16-10, 
6-4 in conference play), playing what Raider Coach Al Nordquist called "one of 
our better games all year," broke open a tight game by shooting 64% percent in 
the second half while visiting Glendale (15-10, 6-4) struggled offensively. 
</P>
<P>
The Vaqueros, who trailed, 35-31, at halftime, made only 10 of 33 shots in the 
second half (30%). 
</P>
<P>
"We shot awful, we passed awful, and we executed awful," Glendale Coach Brian 
Beauchemin said. "If I could find the reasons for it, I'd bottle them, sell 
them, and I wouldn't have to do this crap." 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark, which was led by sophomore Alex Porter (a game-high 20 points and 12 
rebounds), got a big boost from its freshmen, 3 of whom scored in double 
figures. Sean Young scored 12 points on 5-of-7 shooting, including a pair of 
3-point shots, and swingman Damion Dicus added 12 points. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Cangelosi (11 points) and Greg Taylor (6 points, 7 rebounds), another 
freshman, also contributed.

NO. 1 RIVERSIDE SAVES FACE IN FINAL MINUTES TO DENY CSUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's an old adage, but, in this case, particularly appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
The bigger they are the harder they fall. 
</P>
<P>
And UC Riverside, ranked No. 1 in Division II basketball, would have made quite 
a divot on the floor of the Cal State Northridge gym. 
</P>
<P>
But it didn't. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, it was the expectations of Northridge players and fans that went splat 
in the final minutes of an 86-79 loss to Riverside in a California Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. game Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge (12-8, 3-4 in conference play) can take some solace in that it 
certainly didn't give the game away. It was taken from the Matadors. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside, which has won 14 in a row, shot 55.4%, including 63% (17 of 27) in 
the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Maurice Pullum led the way for the Highlanders, connecting on 5 of 11 3-point 
shots and finishing with 28 points. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Ceballos had 16 points and 9 rebounds for Riverside and Jimmy Shorters 
added 15 points in 17 minutes off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
Darren Matsubara scored a team-high 24 points for CSUN. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside, which has a win over Iowa to its credit, finished the first half of 
its CCAA schedule 7-0. The Highlanders are 18-2 overall, but only 1 of their 
losses came on the court. The other was a forfeit caused by the use of an 
ineligible player. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge is 3-4, but still in the hunt for a berth in the 4-team CCAA 
postseason tournament. The Matadors are tied for fifth with Cal State 
Bakersfield -- their opponent at home on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
But nobody was thinking about such things after letting a big fish off the 
hook. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're playing with such a slight margin of error you have to always be 
attentive," CSUN Coach Pete Cassidy said. "You need 40 minutes -- not 35." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the Matadors put in 32 Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge, which led by as many as 7 in the second half, led for the last 
time, 58-57, after a Jemarl Baker jumper with 8:09 left. 
</P>
<P>
The shot only temporarily slowed Riverside, however. The Highlanders, already 
on a 12-6 run, took off on a real tear, scoring their next 8 times down the 
floor to gradually pull away. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the run were 4 3-point plays, 2 on 3-point shots by Pullum and 
Shorters. The others came in a particularly frustrating fashion for the 
Matadors. 
</P>
<P>
Twice Riverside beat the Matadors' full-court press with a deep pass. And twice 
Shorters made layups with CSUN's Todd Bowser fouling -- too late and too light 
-- from behind. 
</P>
<P>
The last of Shorters' 3-point plays came with 3:18 left and gave Riverside a 
75-66 advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Cassidy couldn't fault his team's effort. 
</P>
<P>
Down, 76-69, and fading with 1:55 left, Northridge gave it a last-ditch try. 
</P>
<P>
A 3-point play by Bowser pulled the Matadors within 4. Then Baker stuck a 
3-point shot and Riverside's lead was 77-75 with 1:33 left. 
</P>
<P>
In the next minute, Riverside pulled away for good, making 7 free throws, 
including the front ends of 4 1-and-1 opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside, which had trailed at the half only twice this season, was even with 
Northridge at the break Saturday. A 3-point shot by Chris Jackson at the buzzer 
from beyond the top of the key enabled the Highlanders to tie, 36-36. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge trailed Riverside for most of the half before going on a 12-4 run to 
take a 31-29 lead on a 3-point shot by Derrick Gathers.

RAMS' GASTON GREEN IS STILL WAITING TO DELIVER ON THAT UCLA PROMISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN FLEISCHMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first time Gaston Green played in Anaheim Stadium, the results were so 
spectacular that giddy UCLA fans joked about adding green to the school colors 
of blue and gold. 
</P>
<P>
Green set what was then a major bowl record by rushing for 266 yards and three 
touchdowns for the Bruins in a game against Brigham Young in the 1986 Freedom 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The performance catapulted Green, then a junior, into the front-runner spot for 
the 1987 Heisman Trophy. During his senior season, the UCLA athletic department 
mounted an intense publicity campaign, complete with posters and weekly post 
cards to update the national media on his progress. 
</P>
<P>
Green was in the running for the Heisman until an injury kept him out of one 
game and parts of two others. Still, the graduate of Gardena High finished his 
collegiate career as the Bruins' most prolific runner and their No. 2 all-time 
scorer, behind kicker John Lee. 
</P>
<P>
Green's return to Anaheim Stadium in 1988 as a first-round draft pick of the 
Los Angeles Rams generated far less excitement. This time around, the only play 
on words his surname suggested was green as in inexperienced. 
</P>
<P>
The 14th player taken in last June's draft, Green saw limited playing time this 
season behind the tailback duo of Charles White, the NFL's leading ground 
gainer in 1987, and the surprising Greg Bell, who rushed for 1,212 yards and 16 
touchdowns in 1988. Green, whom the Rams selected with a draft choice acquired 
in the Eric Dickerson trade, played in only 10 games, rushing for 117 yards in 
35 carries. 
</P>
<P>
That's just two attempts more than he had in that Freedom Bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
Green, however, has no regrets about last season, and he defends the Rams' 
drafting him. Give him the ball, he says, and he'll show you what he can do. 
</P>
<P>
"Going into the season, I figured I'd carry the ball 10 to 15 times a game and 
catch some passes," said Green, who has gone back to UCLA to complete his 
bachelor of arts in history. "I was disappointed at first, because I expected 
to get more playing time than I did. . . . I didn't get an opportunity to show 
my capabilities, like I did at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"When your opportunity comes, you have to make the best of it. But I wasn't 
able to because I didn't get an opportunity really to play. . . . You have to 
be patient and wait for your chance to come." 
</P>
<P>
With White already established in the backfield after his best season, the 
Rams' plan all along was to bring Green around slowly. 
</P>
<P>
"You can make a big error, and I think everyone's done it," Coach John Robinson 
said during the preseason about Green. "You want a guy to be something. You 
draft him, recruit him to be that. He might not be able to be that for you. You 
have to take him where he's at and try to get the best out of him." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, when Green arrived at training camp, he wasn't all that impressed. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't as tough as I thought it would be, as when I was in college," he 
said. "It was tougher at UCLA as far as learning the system. (The Rams) do a 
lot of things the same way they do at UCLA, and that made it easier. 
</P>
<P>
"I was thinking they'd be hitting harder too. I didn't get to carry the ball 
that much, but the times I did, sometimes they'd hit me pretty good, but it 
wasn't as tough as I expected." 
</P>
<P>
The season started ominously for Green when he missed the Rams' first 
exhibition game with a bruised knee. But Green improved as the preseason went, 
rushing for 73 yards in 11 carries in the Rams' final exhibition game against 
San Diego. A showdown between the rookie and the veteran for the starting spot 
was expected. 
</P>
<P>
A changing of the guard, with Green replacing White, would have been a 
flashback of sorts. As a youngster, Green worked the sideline chains during the 
1977 Rose Bowl when White replaced the injured Ricky Bell in the USC backfield, 
signaling a new era in Trojan football. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been a fan of his ever since," Green said. 
</P>
<P>
As the season progressed, it was Greg Bell, however, not Green, who proved to 
be White's heir apparent. Green carried the ball five times in the Rams' opener 
at Green Bay, and his playing time dwindled even further until the sixth week, 
when Bell went out with a bruised shoulder in the third quarter of a game 
against Atlanta. Green carried 14 times for 61 yards. Two weeks later, Green 
missed the Seattle game with sore ribs, and he carried the ball just six more 
times the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Green thought he would have another chance to play when White was suspended for 
30 days for drug and alcohol problems. When Robinson kept the rookie on the 
sidelines, Green approached the coach. 
</P>
<P>
"(Robinson) told me that the way Greg had been playing, he didn't want to take 
out a running back who was playing as good as (Bell) was playing," Green said. 
</P>
<P>
On the brighter side for Green, his contract -- estimated to be worth nearly $2 
million over four years -- has given him some financial independence. He has 
purchased a house for himself in Tustin, assumed his parents' mortgage payments 
and bought them rings for their 25th wedding anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
And regardless of the lack of playing time, Green wouldn't have it any other 
way. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, I could be playing somewhere else, but who knows how good that team 
would be," he said. "This is where I grew up, and this is where I want to be. 
I'm happy where I'm at, playing for a winning team."

Patti Held scored a season-high 35 points and made 11 shots in a row to lead UC 
Riverside to a 72-68 upset of Cal State Northridge in a women's California 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. basketball game Saturday at Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Held embarked on her hot streak in the second half as Riverside staved off a 
last-minute rally by Northridge to record its first CCAA victory. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge, playing without leading scorer and rebounder Chris Cavalin, fell to 
15-6 overall, 3-3 in conference play. The Lady Matadors made only 34.3% of 
their field-goal attempts.

RAINS PUT END TO CSUN SOFTBALL TOURNAMENT

Softball Coach Gary Torgeson of Cal State Northridge officially canceled the 
Tournament of Champions because of rain Saturday. It was the tournament's only 
cancellation in 7 years. 
</P>
<P>
Six games were completed Friday before rain washed out the remaining 2 days of 
play. Northridge defeated Nevada Las Vegas, 1-0, in 8 innings Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Torgeson said that the tournament was canceled because the rain made the 
softball field at Northridge unplayable. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have wrecked our field to play on it and some of the other teams did 
not want to take that chance," Torgeson said. "Safety was the primary reason." 
</P>
<P>
The rain also proved troublesome for Valley-area baseball teams. Northridge's 
doubleheader at home against Cal Lutheran also was canceled because of rain. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark College's game against L. A. Mission on Saturday was rained out. The 
game has yet to be rescheduled but Friday's game against Antelope Valley, which 
also fell victim to the rain, will be played at 2 p.m. Monday at Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
Valley College's game at Fullerton College was postponed until Monday at 2. The 
Monarchs' Friday game against Long Beach City College was postponed until 2 
p.m. on Feb. 13 at Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce College's game at Long Beach, scheduled for Saturday, was postponed 
until 2 p.m. Feb. 27 at Long Beach. This weekend's Glendale-Citrus tournament 
was washed out. RALPH NICHOLS

When San Fernando High basketball Coach Dick Crowell dismissed starters Michael 
Wynn and Sean Williams from the team for violating team rules Friday, he 
hastened to add that both players appeared uninspired the past several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"I sensed that their hearts really weren't in it," Crowell said. "They weren't 
going to quit, but they were looking for a way out. And this was it." 
</P>
<P>
The way Wynn and Williams reacted to Crowell's action appeared to bear out the 
coach's assessment. Neither player seemed upset about the penalty and both said 
that although they enjoyed playing basketball their athletic futures lie with 
football. 
</P>
<P>
Wynn, a junior, and Williams, a senior, formed one of the Valley-area's most 
potent passing combinations during the past football season, but after Friday's 
announcement, it looks as though they have played their last game together. 
</P>
<P>
Wynn, a quarterback who completed 108 of 209 passes for 1,614 yards and 24 
touchdowns in the fall, was ousted from the basketball team because he missed 
Friday night's West Valley League game against El Camino Real to attend a 
family reunion in Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, a Times' All-Valley wide receiver who caught 43 passes for 770 yards 
(17.7 avg.) and 10 touchdowns, was dropped from the roster for numerous 
violations, according to Crowell, including missing 2 team meetings during the 
week. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him (Crowell) about the family reunion a week and a half ago," Wynn, 
16, said. "I tried all week to get out of it, but I couldn't. . . . I thought 
maybe he'd understand, but he took it just the wrong way." 
</P>
<P>
Williams, 18, who has made a verbal commitment to attend Utah in the fall, 
expressed similar sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to go downtown with my parents to take care of some family business," he 
said. "But he (Crowell) didn't understand. Sometimes he doesn't like to be 
wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Crowell, 48, defended his actions. He said that Wynn (who was averaging 9.4 
points a game) and Williams (10 points a game) had been playing uninspired 
basketball ever since San Fernando (8-12, 2-6 in league play) began to struggle 
the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Crowell added that neither player had shown enough respect for their coach. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't always there," he said. "I mean, my players don't have to like me, 
but I do want them to listen to me and respect me as a coach." 
</P>
<P>
Proud joker: Birmingham basketball Coach Elliot Turret is rarely at a loss for 
one-liners. 
</P>
<P>
Whether he's discussing the state of his team or the state of the nation, 
Turret consistently cracks jokes about the subject matter. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the topic was grades and 3 of his players -- forward Jason 
Wallace, guard Glenn Sucich and center Gabriel Kruchinski -- who received 
straight A's on their 20-week report cards. 
</P>
<P>
"Straight A's in all six classes," Turret said. "It's probably the first time 
this season they've been 6 for 6 in anything. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, the 4.0 in grades is better than what they've been averaging on the 
court." 
</P>
<P>
That might hold true for Kruchinski (3.1 points a game), but the statistics of 
Sucich (14.2 points, 5.9 rebounds) and Wallace (10.9 points, 7.2 rebounds) 
easily exceed that figure. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Turret is trying to transform excellence in the classroom into victories 
on the court. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got an idea," he said. "After every game, we'll have an academic 
decathlon. I'll take my three guys against any other team's top three and the 
winner gets the victory." 
</P>
<P>
Add grades: Report cards may have been a joking matter to Turret, but they were 
serious business for coaches Steve Miller of North Hollywood and Jeff Halpern 
of Reseda, whose playoff-bound teams lost players to academic ineligibility. 
</P>
<P>
Junior guard Duane Braxton of North Hollywood (13-4, 8-0 in Mid-Valley League 
play), the team leader in assists (5.8 a game), was ruled academically 
ineligible, as were starting forward Michael Hawkins, a junior, and senior 
reserve William Childs of Reseda (8-9, 6-2). 
</P>
<P>
All three will miss the rest of the basketball season. 
</P>
<P>
The Cleveland beat: Any fan sitting in the Cleveland gym during pregame 
warm-ups has been subjected to it -- a veritable auditory assault from 2 huge 
public-address speakers that rest on either side of the scorer's table. 
Blasting forth at high volume is music chosen by the Cleveland players. 
</P>
<P>
Monitoring the stereo system -- actually a portable tape player placed before 
the P. A -- is Coach Bob Braswell, who occasionally twists a knob to adjust the 
treble and bass. He also has been known to pump up the volume if he's in the 
mood. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids like it," Braswell said. "And we get a good reaction from our fans." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Cavalier fans have been known to break into spontaneous dance in the 
aisles of the grandstands, sometimes in groups of 10 or 15. Which, of course, 
only adds to the home-court atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
And advantage. 
</P>
<P>
The music is recorded by players on a cassette on Braswell's stereo system at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
"They're over there all the time," he said. "I pretty much let them tape the 
stuff they want to hear." 
</P>
<P>
Braswell said that given his druthers, he'd rather hear jazz. He has an 
extensive jazz collection, including numerous compact discs. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't even hear (jazz) in my car," he said. "Every time I have one of the 
guys in there, they change the station." 
</P>
<P>
Burnham update: Angela Burnham of Rio Mesa, Track and Field News' 1988 female 
high school athlete of the year, took a recruiting trip to USC this week and is 
scheduled to visit Nevada Las Vegas later this month. 
</P>
<P>
Burnham, who made previous trips to Tennessee (November) and Texas (January), 
won state titles in the 100 and 200 meters at Cerritos College in Norwalk last 
June and set a national age-16 record of 11.28 seconds in the 100 at the 
Olympic Trials in Indianapolis last July. 
</P>
<P>
Add Rio Mesa: When Burnham makes her 1989 outdoor debut in the Spartan Relays 
on March 4, she'll be running on Rio Mesa's new all-weather latex track. 
</P>
<P>
The track -- which will be identical to the one at Camarillo High -- cost an 
estimated $75,000, a bargain price in today's market where tracks frequently 
cost from $250,000 to $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
"We were able to cut down on a lot of labor costs because the new track can be 
laid down over the old one," Rio Mesa co-Coach Brian FitzGerald said. 
</P>
<P>
Tourney time: Patterning itself after many college conferences, the Westside 
League will hold a postseason basketball tournament to determine 2 of its 3 
qualifiers for the Southern Section Small Schools playoffs, which begin Feb. 
16. 
</P>
<P>
Grace Community, the regular-season champion, is guaranteed a berth in the 
playoffs, but the Hawks' seeding will be based upon how they fare in the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
If it wins the tournament, Grace Community will advance to the playoffs as the 
league's No. 1-seeded team. If it finishes second, it will go into the playoffs 
as the league's No. 2-seeded team and if it fails to advance to the tournament 
final, it would be the No. 3-seeded team. 
</P>
<P>
The 3-day league tournament will open with 2 games at Grace Community and 2 
games at West L. A. Baptist. 
</P>
<P>
The first-round winners will advance to the semifinals on Friday at Grace 
Community, site of the championship on Feb. 18. 
</P>
<P>
Add tournaments: St. Francis's 80-64 victory against St. John Bosco on Friday 
night finalized the pairings for the 5-team Del Rey League tournament. 
</P>
<P>
St. John Bosco, the league's fourth-place team in the regular season, will play 
host to Alemany (fifth) in a third-place semifinal Monday. The winner will play 
at St. Francis in the third-place final Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The third-place game originally was scheduled for Wednesday but was switched to 
Thursday because the St. Francis gym is used for bingo on Wednesday nights. 
</P>
<P>
Regular-season champion Loyola and runner-up Crespi automatically qualified for 
the tournament final at Loyola on Friday.

CLU BASEBALL PREVIEW;

HILL WANTS TEAM AS COMPANY FOR PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Rich Hill attended the National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics District 3 
baseball playoffs last year but not in the capacity he would have liked -- as 
coach of the Cal Lutheran baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
Hill was put in the awkward position of having to help administrate a 
tournament in which his Kingsmen had no involvement. Cal Lutheran failed to 
qualify for the district playoffs after finishing in a tie for third in the 
Golden State Athletic Conference. 
</P>
<P>
"Being there without my team was one of the toughest things I have had to deal 
with as a coach," said Hill, who is beginning his second season with Cal 
Lutheran. "We had the talent to be there, but we just did not execute in the 
last 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
"All I kept thinking was that I could not wait until next year." 
</P>
<P>
The Kingsmen will have to improve in several key areas this season if they are 
going to improve on their 20-23 record and compete with perennial Golden State 
Athletic Conference powers such as Westmont College. CLU was 13-11 in 
conference play last season. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for Hill, Cal Lutheran has a month of preseason games before 
opening conference play against Christ College on March 4. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran will need a month to solidify a pitching staff that is headed by 
senior right-handed reliever Jay Anderson, the Kingsmen's top returning 
pitcher. Joining Anderson, who had a 2-3 record and a 4.67 earned-run average 
last year, will be right-handers Mike Clark from Pierce College, Craig Anderson 
from Golden West College and Dean Martinez (7-5 at Saddleback College). 
</P>
<P>
The Kingsmen also picked up junior Devon Schutzler, a left-handed 
pitcher-infielder from Monterey Peninsula College. Returning left-hander 
pitchers include sophomore Tim Lewis, who batted .327 but pitched in only 1 
game last season, and junior Kevin O'Neill. Hill also has Greg Minick, a senior 
right-hander who compiled a 3-8 record and 5.47 ERA last year and is expected 
to be ready later this month after having undergone elbow surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran bolstered its outfield with the addition of Darnell Mitchell, a 
center fielder from Cuesta College. He will join returning outfielders Henry 
Campos, who also played third base last year, and first baseman-outfielder Dan 
Weis. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to get a center fielder to anchor the outfield because we had no speed 
out there last year," Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore second baseman Dave Leonhardt, who hit .420 in GSAC play last year 
and .311 overall, is Cal Lutheran's top returning infielder. Hill also has 
Daren Cornell, who is returning at shortstop after missing last season because 
of academic ineligibility, and junior Jeff Brouelette from Orange Coast College 
at third base. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Anthony Espitia, who batted .344 last season and was second on the team 
in home runs with 5, is back at catcher along with sophomore catcher-outfielder 
Jeff Chalmers. The Kingsmen added junior Leonard Matsumoto, a junior 
catcher-outfielder from Santa Monica College. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a nucleus of 10 or 11 guys who are going to be playing all year for 
us," Hill said. "Right now, it depends on which guys are swinging the bat the 
best." 
</P>
<P>
Hill expects that a tough preseason schedule, which includes 3 Division I 
opponents and 7 Division II teams, will prepare the Kingsmen for conference 
play. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel this year that there is a complete turnaround on this team," Hill said. 
"We have some guys who really want to work hard and win." 
</P>
<P>
CLU, whose season-opening doubleheader against Cal State Northridge was rained 
out Saturday, will play at The Master's College on Thursday at 2:30 p.m.

A ROCK FAN WHO MADE IT PAY OFF; 
</P>
<P>
BUT JIM GUERINOT STILL STEERS CLEAR OF SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jim Guerinot considers the most successful moment of his professional life to 
have been the day back in 1982 when he stopped going to work. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, he still reports to an office regularly, and he draws a respectable salary: 
These days, he carries the imposing title of executive director of artist 
development at A&amp;M Records in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
But ever since the wide-eyed, curly-haired rock 'n' roll fan from Fullerton 
left his job stocking groceries on the night crew at Vons, nothing that he has 
done for a living -- from independent concert promoting to band managing to now 
-- has really felt like work. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be doing this stuff for free," Guerinot said over lunch recently at a 
Fullerton restaurant near the family home where he visits his parents every 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The ambitious hotshot who always was in awe of the music industry's movers and 
shakers has a hard time accepting the notion that he is rapidly becoming one of 
them. So far, at least, he hasn't adopted the jaded tones of the typical 
privileged-but-bored power broker. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing a get-a-load-of-this expression, Guerinot described an average weekend 
after he went to work in 1985 for Avalon Attractions, the giant Southland 
concert promoter that books the Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre: 
</P>
<P>
"I would go down to Newport and body surf or hang out at the beach, then get to 
Irvine Meadows about 3 o'clock and play basketball (on a backstage court) for a 
few hours. Then I'd shower up, eat dinner and do the show." 
</P>
<P>
"That's Club Med," he said with a laugh. "That's what I would pay to do." 
</P>
<P>
For a recent presentation on the new artists and records he will be helping to 
promote at A&amp;M, label president Gil Friesen escorted him through a 
recording studio where he had an unexpected encounter. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'Take a look at this girl singer.' I was watching this female singer 
doing something, and I realized the guy sitting next to (producer Jimmy) Iovine 
at the mixing board was Bono (Hewson, U2's lead singer). I'm not a huge U2 fan, 
by any means, but it was still a kick. It's not the kind of thing that will 
make or break my life, but still. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
At 29, he still sounds like the kid who used to clip concert ads from 
newspapers and tack them up to a bedroom bulletin board along with his ticket 
stubs. 
</P>
<P>
Millions of people grew up loving rock 'n' roll; few have parlayed that love 
into as dynamic a career, and as quickly, as Guerinot. His first paying job in 
the musicbiz was as concert chairman at Fullerton College in 1981-82. After a 
similar position at UC Irvine, he went to Avalon as a booking agent. A booking 
job with MCA/Universal Concerts was next and led to his current post at 
A&amp;M. 
</P>
<P>
Two key factors in his rise well may be his unflagging exuberance and that 
genuine absence of any show-biz affectation: He arrives for an interview 
wearing the same unassuming black T-shirt and jeans in which he usually is seen 
at concerts -- or around the office. 
</P>
<P>
But the guileless grin and baby-faced demeanor can be deceiving: Guerinot is 
also a seasoned and, when necessary, nervy businessman. 
</P>
<P>
"The music business is simple: it's all about people," said Steve Rennie, 
Avalon's vice president. A former independent concert promoter, Rennie met 
Guerinot while he was handling concerts at UCI. When Rennie closed his own firm 
and went to work for Avalon, he brought Guerinot along. 
</P>
<P>
"If you can play people," Rennie continued, "you can do all right in this 
business. . . . Just knowing the music isn't enough, not to succeed at a high 
level. 
</P>
<P>
"When Jim went over to MCA, it was an absolute steal for them. You just don't 
get many guys with that kind of enthusiasm who understand music, who have an 
innate business sense, and who have the proper touch in any situation. There 
are times in this business when you have to be an absolute jerk and the next 
second you have to be a nice guy. Usually, you wind up being one or the other. 
Very few people can do both and be credible." 
</P>
<P>
Before he jumped to the record industry side of the fence last year, Guerinot 
was among a handful of key players who shaped Orange County's live music scene 
during the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
A tireless devotee and promoter of up-and-coming bands, Guerinot has pursued 
the shock of the new from Day One, when he signed punk band T.S.O.L. to play 
Fullerton College. That show was memorable not just as his maiden voyage as a 
promoter, but for the booking agent's nightmare it became: When a rowdy, 
over-capacity crowd showed up, police sealed off the campus and shut down the 
concert. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Guerinot soon was hired to book shows at Ichabod's, a crusty bar 
that once (before the compelling need for Burger King stand No. 4908 brought 
the wrecking ball down on the place) hosted such cutting-edge bands as Suburban 
Lawns, the Dickies, the Alley Cats and, in one of those 
you-should-have-been-there billings, R.E.M. as the opening act for the 
Untouchables. 
</P>
<P>
Guerinot presided over larger-scale concerts at UCI's 2,000-seat Crawford Hall 
back in the pre-Bren Events Center era. Meanwhile, he frequently staged shows 
in such oddball sites as a Boys Club in Placentia, where he showcased Fullerton 
punk heroes Social Distortion, the band he now manages. 
</P>
<P>
That concert drew several hundred animated (though minimally violent) punk 
fans, and when Guerinot applied for a permit to hold concerts there on a 
regular basis, city officials responded, not surprisingly, with a firm "No 
thanks." 
</P>
<P>
Undaunted, Guerinot went to a former disco in Orange and master-minded a 
concert series designed to provide the county with some of the sense of 
occasion and musical ground-breaking found in Los Angeles, at such hot spots as 
the Palace. Once a week during the summer of 1987, the Confetti nightclub was 
dubbed "Pretty Vacant," a nod to the Sex Pistols' song: Decked out like an 
underground post-nuclear bunker, it hosted concerts by such talked-about groups 
as Concrete Blonde, Red Lorry Yellow Lorry, The Mission U.K., Jane's Addiction 
and Erasure. 
</P>
<P>
But the series petered out when the club changed managers and its enthusiasm 
for adventuresome music dwindled. 
</P>
<P>
Guerinot laments the lack of an energetic club scene in Orange County these 
days and maintains that it is not because it is any harder to start the 
momentum rolling now. "It has to take that one person who wants to do it, who 
really enjoys it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the sorry state of the local scene notwithstanding, weekly pilgrimages 
to Orange County provide a connection with his roots that Guerinot relishes. 
</P>
<P>
Religiously every Sunday morning, Guerinot treks down from his house in Encino 
to Fullerton to play basketball with a group of former classmates from Sunny 
Hills High. After a couple of hours of that, he drives his Porsche ("my one 
indulgence") a few blocks to the home his parents bought in 1972 when he was 13 
and the family moved from Rochester, N.Y. This is where he spent his teen 
years, often in stereotypically wild style. 
</P>
<P>
"I had massive truancy problems. . . . By the time you're a junior in high 
school, you've had U.S. history nine times or something. I liked the subject 
and I knew it pretty well. So I would never go to class, except for tests. I 
got in a huge fight with the teacher because I didn't think it was fair that he 
gave me a C on my report card when I got an A on all my tests. 
</P>
<P>
"He said: 'If you're at a job and you don't come to work, you don't get paid.' 
And I said: 'Unless you get your work done.' That was it -- 'To the principal! 
Suspended.' " 
</P>
<P>
He still expresses some guilt over all that, even though he went on to receive 
an AA degree at Fullerton and a BA in English at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
"I was having a lot of fun, but I gave my parents a lot of grief, and it slowed 
me up," he said. "That's why it was so important to me to finish my college 
degrees." 
</P>
<P>
But Guerinot still views himself as an outsider looking in, not all that 
different from the kid who flaunted an anti-establishment sense of enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
"They had these time stamps that would re-admit you to class. I had gone out 
and gotten one and was selling stamped time cards in the parking lot for 50 
cents. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I don't ever want to be part of the system because as soon as I am part of it, 
I'm dispensable. As long as I'm still outside that and don't fit in, I'll be an 
alternative to something." 
</P>
<P>
He provided all kinds of alternatives while booking the Universal Amphitheatre 
and other MCA-owned facilities during a 10-month stint last year: The acts he 
presented included Public Image Ltd., Echo &amp; the Bunnymen, Love &amp; 
Rockets, Gene Loves Jezebel, R.E.M., Los Lobos and others that also helped 
infuse new life into facilities best known, as Guerinot puts it, "as places 
Frank Sinatra likes to play." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps his most inspired booking at the Universal Amphitheatre paired rock 
pioneer Jerry Lee Lewis with seminal L.A. punk band X -- which had released a 
hit version of Lewis' "Breathless" at the time. 
</P>
<P>
"That was one of the best shows I've ever seen Jerry Lee do -- he discovered a 
new audience that night," said Larry Vallon, executive vice president for MCA 
Concerts and the man who hired Guerinot away from Avalon. 
</P>
<P>
"On a flight over to London," Vallon recalled, "Jim and I were sitting on the 
plane talking about the amphitheater -- how we were trying to get more of a 
rock 'n' roll vibe going, and ways we could do so. He came up with the thought 
(of taking) the seats out of the orchestra pit. . . . That really was the 
beginning of turning the amphitheater into more of a rock 'n' roll room." 
</P>
<P>
But partly because the role of a booking agent was beginning to feel a little 
too familiar and comfortable ("I don't ever want to be part of the system"), 
Guerinot soon decided that it was time to tackle a different end of the music 
business, an area to which he had had little exposure. 
</P>
<P>
He went to A&amp;M, and sure enough, "every day it's something new. That keeps 
it real fresh and exciting. It also means that you make mistakes, and all of a 
sudden levels of expertise that you've held in other positions are no longer 
there. It's difficult not to feel like the in-house expert on something, to 
have to solicit assistance. 
</P>
<P>
"But that's all part of it. When the days are frustrating, that's when I have 
to sit back and say to myself: 'You're supposed to be learning. You've been in 
the record business for what -- 6 months? You aren't supposed to be the genius 
yet.' " 
</P>
<P>
He figures that the job can't help but prepare him for his next goal: opening 
his own management firm. He already has logged some experience in management, 
advising not only Social Distortion but Dramarama and the Vandals. 
</P>
<P>
Most of his managing efforts of the last 5 years, though, have been focused on 
Social Distortion, a band that has represented both the best of punk rock -- 
its liberating musical spirit -- and the worst, its glorification of personal 
excess. 
</P>
<P>
Lead singer Mike Ness' descent into and escape from the hell of heroin 
addiction also had Guerinot on a roller-coaster ride. At first, Guerinot 
dismissed all the indulgences as part of the wild-and-crazy life all 
adolescents flirt with; he recalls that his only concern about Ness' constant 
quest for drugs was that "he didn't steal the beer I was drinking." 
</P>
<P>
But soon, the magnitude of Ness' problem became clear. "I was driving him some 
place and he started shooting up in my car. He was such a chemist -- he would 
show you the whole process: you mix this and this -- and there was a dark side 
of me that was fascinated by the whole thing. And then I thought, 'What is 
this? He just shot up.' " 
</P>
<P>
Once, Guerinot saw Ness nearly die from an overdose. After that, he helped 
nurse the singer through recovery. The musical fruit of that period -- the 
group's 1988 album "Prison Bound" -- offered a powerful recounting of those 
dark days. 
</P>
<P>
And now that Ness has been clean for about 2 years, Guerinot sees a bright 
future for the band. In his office at A&amp;M, Guerinot (whom the band calls 
"the Colonel") keeps a large Social Distortion poster mounted over his desk. 
</P>
<P>
"Our relationship was a friendship before it was ever a manager-band 
relationship," said Social Distortion guitarist Dennis Dannell. "That's what's 
held it together this long. He's been like a brother; sometimes even like a 
dad. He's stuck his neck out a lot for us. Right after Mike got cleaned up, Jim 
let Mike live at his house for 6 or 7 months. We pretty much figure him like 
the fifth band member. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Like most teen-agers, Guerinot took up the guitar once. But he abandoned any 
fantasies of becoming a rock 'n' roll star after he signed up for an expensive 
music course at the Dick Grove Music School in the San Fernando Valley and an 
instructor told him, "I really think you may be tone deaf." 
</P>
<P>
"I skipped out and never came back," Guerinot recounted. "I didn't even ask for 
my money back." But he refused to relegate music -- the thing he loved most in 
life -- to sidelight status, the way many of his co-workers at the grocery 
store did. 
</P>
<P>
"You see the guys who right off the bat get the condominium and the Trans-Am 
and work night crew for the rest of their lives. I was thinking, 'Oh God, I 
don't want that to happen to me -- no way.' Like Boogie says in 'Diner': 'If 
you don't have good dreams, you have nightmares.' That to me was a nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
So he kept hustling leads until that memorable day when he was earning enough 
money through concert bookings to pay his rent. 
</P>
<P>
His philosophy for success? A rock 'n' roll analogy, natch: 
</P>
<P>
"I've often compared this business to the big concerts they used to have at 
Anaheim Stadium, with Rod Stewart or the Who: You're packed in, and as soon as 
somebody moves his feet forward a little bit, your feet are back at his heels. 
You just kept moving them forward constantly. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the way I see it in this business: You just constantly keep going 
forward, a little bit at a time." 
</P>

Erection of structural steel for the new John Wayne Airport passenger terminal 
is scheduled to begin Monday. The controversial expansion project, originally 
estimated to cost $39 million, was redesigned to cut costs when bids came in 
last year at $59.8 million to $66 million. The new terminal is part of a 
$300-million expansion of the airport, the largest public works project in 
Orange County history.

MUSHROOMS: The Los Angeles Mycological Society has a couple of activities 
planned for the county in the coming week. On Saturday, the group will hold a 
"fungus foray" into the Rancho Mission Viejo area. The purpose of the trip, 
which is open to the public, is to collect mushrooms for display at the wild 
mushroom fair to be held the next day, Feb. 12, at the Museum of Natural 
History and Science in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The fair will run from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and will include displays, 
demonstrations and lectures on common Southern California fungi. At 11 a.m., 
Mike Wells of the Oregon Mycological Society, co-editor of "Wild Mushroom 
Cookery," will give a step-by-step demonstration on the cultivation of oyster 
mushrooms. For $3, participants can take home a specially treated "log" that 
will sprout the edible mushrooms. 
</P>
<P>
At 2 p.m., Wells will give a cooking demonstration using wild mushrooms. A 
50-cent ticket will allow participants to taste the samples. Admission to the 
fair itself is $2, free for children under 12. 
</P>
<P>
The public is invited to bring wild mushrooms to the fair for identification. 
The museum is at 2627 Vista del Oro. For information on the fair, call (714) 
640-7120; for information on the Saturday foray, call (213) 292-1900. 
</P>
<P>
Locally, wild mushrooms can be found in the days following a rain. The best 
places to look are in the county's hills and canyons, especially under tree 
canopies and in meadows.

WOMAN MAKES BIG WAVES AFTER MOSTLY MEN CHOSEN FOR SURF CONTEST IN LAGUNA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM CARLTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marielle Leeds is looking for two good surfers -- female surfers, that is -- to 
compete in Laguna Beach's upcoming surfing contest and, it is hoped, quell what 
has become a hot local controversy over whether women belong on the waves. 
</P>
<P>
Winterfest, Laguna's first wintertime surfing contest, was almost canceled by 
Mayor Robert F. Gentry when complaints arose at a City Council meeting last 
month that organizers discriminated against women by selecting only one in a 
24-field invitational. Organizers contended that they selected what they 
thought were the 24 best surfers in Laguna Beach and only one woman made the 
cut. 
</P>
<P>
But after Leeds complained to the council, saying that she and other female 
surfers felt unfairly excluded, the male organizers backed down and agreed to 
add some female-only heats -- as long as Leeds finds seven other female surfers 
like herself. She has already found five and expects soon to find another two. 
</P>
<P>
The hitch is that they won't be eligible for the $2,000 in prize money. It will 
go to the men and the one woman, Alisa Schwarzstein, a professional surfer who 
is ranked sixth in the world among female surfers. 
</P>
<P>
Although the organizers say the controversy has been blown out of proportion, 
the female surfers complain that this is typical treatment in the 
male-dominated surfing world. 
</P>
<P>
"The guys usually think that girls are just in the way," said Leeds, 25, an 
amateur surfer and local waitress. "But the waves aren't male-only waves. 
They're for everyone to enjoy." 
</P>
<P>
The controversy began innocently enough, when the Laguna Beach Chamber of 
Commerce last year decided to include a surf meet in its annual Winterfest 
celebration. The Feb. 18 and 19 festival, now in its 25th year, is also to 
include a skateboarding contest, a 30-mile bicycle ride, a catamaran regatta, 
body-building competition, food fair and art contest. 
</P>
<P>
A committee of three male surfing experts was named to select the top 24 
surfers in Laguna Beach and invite them to the competition. The committee 
members made the selections based on their firsthand knowledge of the surfing 
community. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's pretty much general consensus who the top surfers are," said 
Douglas Bunting, a committee member. He owns the Equipe surf shop in Laguna, 
which is co-sponsoring the surf contest with Gotcha Sportswear of Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Because this will be a local meet, only surfers from Laguna were chosen. And 
because winter tides restrict the prime surfing period to 4 or 5 hours a day, 
competition had to be limited to what could be accomplished within that time, 
Bunting said. 
</P>
<P>
In professional meets, competitors are drawn from a pool of surfers listed by 
the Assn. of Surfing Professionals, said Bonnie Crail, spokeswoman for Ocean 
Pacific Sunwear, which sponsors the huge OP Pro surf contest every August at 
Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Out of 220 competitors in the last OP Pro contest, Crail said, only 32 were 
women. That ratio closely approximates the demographics of surfing, she said, 
noting that there are fewer sponsorships and contests for women. 
</P>
<P>
In Laguna, Bunting said, "I wasn't aware of any other women (besides 
Schwarzstein) who would be interested in the contest." 
</P>
<P>
But, besides Leeds, there were a number of others, including Julie Whitegon, 
24, a Laguna surfer. Whitegon said that she tried to enter the contest and even 
went to the trouble of sending in her own entry form when none were 
distributed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We Can Only Go Up' 
</P>
<P>
"It's unfair, but that's how surfing is right now," said Whitegon, who runs a 
surf shop in Laguna Niguel. "There are people working to make women equal in 
the surfing world, but right now we're kind of at the low level of it. We've 
been on the bottom for so long that we can only go up." 
</P>
<P>
Leeds said she too had waited anxiously for an entry form to arrive. Instead, 
she discovered by telephoning Bunting's shop last month that the meet had 
already been filled on an invitation-only basis. 
</P>
<P>
That's when she raised a ruckus before the Jan. 10 meeting of the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought that was really not fair. I wanted to be in the contest," Leeds 
said. 
</P>
<P>
She found an ally in Gentry, an acknowledged homosexual who is known for 
vigorously opposing all forms of discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Perceived as Discriminatory' 
</P>
<P>
"I am appalled at the fact that in Laguna Beach we would have anything that is 
perceived as discriminatory," Gentry said last week, adding that he had 
threatened to prohibit the organizers from using city beaches if they do not 
include women. 
</P>
<P>
Besides opening up part of the event to women, the organizers also issued an 
apology in the Laguna newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
"Our intention here was to pioneer an event that could become a tradition in 
our community. . . . We apologize for any misunderstandings and hope in the 
future that the surfing event and the Winterfest can accommodate all the 
citizens of Laguna Beach," Bunting and Marc Price, a manager of Gotcha 
Sportswear, said in an open letter. 
</P>
<P>
But Leeds is not confident that discrimination against women in the water will 
end with this. She expects that they will continue to get dirty looks for 
trying to share the waves. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of times, guys will drop in on the shoulder of your wave and make it 
difficult for you to enjoy your wave after you've waited your turn," Leeds 
said. "It's hard, especially being a girl."

DISCRIMINATION AND HOMOSEXUALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Times has long been a smug and pious defender of wrong ideas 
and narrow-minded people. Your editorial ("Pro-Family Initiative Rooted in 
Prejudice," Jan. 15) supporting the homosexual rights ordinance of Irvine is 
further proof of this. 
</P>
<P>
The Times calls me and my colleagues homophobes and guilty of "ignorant 
prejudice" because we happen to resoundingly support the heterosexual ethic, 
the traditional family. What we know is that mainstream, professional 
psychology, confirming the most fundamental of human instincts, views 
homosexuality as an acquired behavior and even "perverse" in the clinical 
sense. 
</P>
<P>
The American Psychological Assn. does accept homosexuality as normal, something 
homosexuals will point out, but this view ignores the political aggression of 
homosexuals as they terrorized the APA into submission on this issue back in 
1973. 
</P>
<P>
Americans are discriminating people. We do care who we work with, we do care 
who lives next door to us, we do care who sits next to us on a bus, we do care 
what we eat, drink, watch on television, and what clothes we wear. 
</P>
<P>
We recognize each of these concerns as legitimate because they fall within our 
realm of personal choice. On the other hand, Americans find discrimination 
based on race, sex, physical handicap, etc., as abhorrent because we are all 
born into these situations, we did not have a choice how we were to be born. 
</P>
<P>
Homosexuality is a personal choice, and a deleterious choice at that. Americans 
have the right to "discriminate," to wonder why they must be forced to legally 
and morally recognize one distasteful personal behavior when they are not 
obliged to do the same for other behaviors. 
</P>
<P>
To deny housing to an avowed homosexual is similar to denying housing to an 
alcoholic or drug abuser. A landlord should have the discretion to protect the 
integrity of his or her property when harmful personal behavior is in question. 
If homosexual behavior is not a problem to a landlord, then so be it. But if it 
is, then an ordinance such as the Irvine law becomes an offense. 
</P>
<P>
Homosexuality is but a symptom of the disease of moral decay that exists where 
citizenry deny God. Our fight to repeal the Irvine ordinance is really an 
appeal in support of traditional family values and the Judeo-Christian ethic. 
</P>
<P>
America is a place where even persons who choose adverse life styles can 
petition a citizenry for support. This right, however, does not make the 
substance of the appeal morally proper or even constitutional. The Times is 
wrong once again to lend its seemingly undying support in favor of 
homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
The goal of the homosexual movement is to hop from small city to small city and 
from town to town promoting ordinances of the type in Irvine. One of my goals, 
and that of others, is to stop them in their political advance. This is my 
right as a citizen of the United States and I intend to exercise it. 
</P>
<P>
If leaders in America, whether in business, news media, education, public 
health, or those in government, are unwilling to affirm the heterosexual ethic 
and the Judeo-Christian ethic, then we should be honest enough to recognize 
that homosexuals will succeed in tearing down the most fundamental values of 
Western civilization, our God-given heterosexual identities and our 
God-ordained traditional family unit.

BILLBOARD AD FOR LAGUNA AUDUBON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Have you noticed the billboard on the Santa Ana Freeway as you approach Laguna 
Canyon Road (California 133)? It depicts various wildlife on a hillside 
silhouetted against the night sky. It is an advertisement for Laguna Audubon, a 
development project by Katherine Thompson Land Developers. 
</P>
<P>
It gets pretty tiring being taken for a fool by these developers and their 
advertising tactics. How dare Thompson depict on her billboard the very life 
her company has destroyed? This sign is supposed to give us a sense that the 
Audubon is one with the land and animals. 
</P>
<P>
Are the developers really any different than the power-crazed governments that 
send us into war? No. Because developments such as Laguna Audubon, Laguna 
Laurel and Irvine Coast (to name a few) benefit only the developers and their 
"generals," i.e., Harriett M. Wieder. They are not solving any existing 
problems in our country, state, county or towns. They are not housing the 
homeless or providing truly affordable housing for our hard-working, 
middle-class American families. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately we have groups like the Laguna Canyon Conservancy and citizens 
working for slow growth to balance the scales of justice.

STANTON ANTI-PORN TACTIC COMMUNITY'S REAL THREAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sometimes the medicine is more deadly than the disease, which is usually the 
case in most misguided attempts to stamp out pornography. The situation in the 
city of Stanton's 4-year effort to drive an adult bookstore out of town was in 
that category. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the state's 4th District Court of Appeal on Wednesday put an end 
to Stanton's assault of the First Amendment by declaring the ordinance 
regulating the business to be unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was not so much a victory for the bookstore as it was for the 
First Amendment right of free speech. 
</P>
<P>
We can sympathize with the public officials, residents and clergymen who for 
the past 4 years have been trying to force out the bookstore they believe 
peddles pornography in the sexually explicit material it sells. 
</P>
<P>
But neither government nor any individual, no matter how well-meaning, has any 
business trying to determine -- or restrict -- what books or films adults can 
read or see. That decision must always be left to the individual. 
</P>
<P>
Whether or not the material the bookshop sells is pornographic is not the 
question, or the danger. The books, magazines, toys and videotapes that the 
store sells are available only to consenting adults who come to the store 
seeking it out. The material is not foisted on any unsuspecting adult and is 
not available to minors. The real issue, and biggest threat to the community, 
was the city's attempts at censorship and restricting freedom of speech and 
choice through a series of council actions that the appellate judges branded as 
a "Keystone Cop legislative chase of (EarMark Books owner Ginger) Cox's sex 
shop." 
</P>
<P>
Cities have the right to set zoning laws. But they cannot be allowed to make 
those laws so restrictive that they would make it virtually impossible for an 
otherwise legal operation to remain in business. That seemed to be precisely 
what Stanton was trying to do. And the appellate court rightfully would have no 
part of it. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, most of the public opposes that approach. In a Times survey last 
month, only 35% of the people polled favored a ban on the rental of X-rated 
movies in home video stores. Pornography is not very popular, but even less 
desirable are misguided efforts to restrict it through censorship.

SCHOOLS AND GAYS: WHERE SHOULD LINE BE DRAWN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Certain members of the community have expressed concerns regarding an 
instructional unit dealing with homosexuality that is presented in the 
psychology course at Corona del Mar High School. The initial expressions of 
concern now seem to be evolving into a pattern usually associated with attempts 
at censorship. That pattern involves first demanding the removal of the 
offending topic, book or idea from the curriculum and, failing that, demanding 
that the point of view(s) acceptable to the complainant(s) be added to the 
curriculum. Consistent with that pattern, the complaint/demands now being 
expressed in the controversy include: 
</P>
<P>
* That homosexuality is not an appropriate topic for discussion in high school 
and thus should be dropped from the psychology curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
* That if homosexuality is to be discussed in the classroom, then equal time 
should be provided for the heterosexual point of view. 
</P>
<P>
There is nothing intrinsically wrong with controversy. Honest people can and do 
have honest disagreements. The public has a fundamental, vested right to 
express concerns regarding the school curriculum; however, that right does not 
extend to censorship. 
</P>
<P>
If all of the topics that might be considered inappropriate by certain 
individuals or certain groups in the community were to be removed from the high 
school curriculum, then we would likely not teach about communism, religion, 
racial prejudice, the death penalty, Watergate or biological reproduction. The 
appropriateness of controversial subject matter is a complex issue involving 
the relevance of the subject matter to the total course, the intellectual and 
emotional maturity of the involved students, and the method of presentation 
used by the teacher. 
</P>
<P>
The operant questions regarding appropriateness in this case are: 
</P>
<P>
* Is sexual identity a topic that is relevant to an introductory psychology 
course? 
</P>
<P>
* Are 11th- and 12th-grade students intellectually and emotionally mature 
enough to discuss different life styles in general and homosexuality in 
particular? 
</P>
<P>
* Is the teacher of the course the best judge of the proper methods of 
presenting the subject matter of the course? 
</P>
<P>
If these questions are addressed in an objective and rational manner, I believe 
that each will be answered in the affirmative. 
</P>
<P>
The second complaint/demand "that if homosexuality is discussed in the 
classroom by homosexuals, then equal time should be provided for the 
heterosexual viewpoint," reflects the second part of the censorship pattern, 
i.e., if the school will not remove the targeted material from the curriculum, 
then material deemed appropriate by the complainants should be added. 
</P>
<P>
The presentation of opposing viewpoints on controversial issues does occur in 
classrooms. On some occasions, students are assigned to debate a certain issue. 
In other circumstances, guest speakers may be invited to present their partisan 
points of view in a discussion/debate format. This has occurred at the high 
school on various topics including political candidacies and issues, 
slow-growth versus pro-development, and right-to-life versus planned 
parenthood. But in all of the instances wherein two opposing viewpoints are 
presented, it is because each viewpoint is being expressed to persuade, 
indoctrinate or convince students of the merits of a certain partisan position. 
</P>
<P>
The protagonists are actively attempting to directly "teach" only one side of 
an issue. In those situations it is obviously incumbent upon the teacher to 
guarantee that both sides of the issue are presented. However, for a number of 
reasons, those instances wherein the "debate" approach is utilized are the 
exception rather than the rule. 
</P>
<P>
In far more cases the teacher presents the controversial topic in an 
informational context rather than a persuasive one. The teacher does not teach 
religion; rather, he/she teaches about religion. The teacher does not teach 
communism; rather, he/she teaches about communism. 
</P>
<P>
In those situations there is no attempt to persuade, indoctrinate or convince 
students of the merits of a particular point of view and thus, in the context 
of that type of lesson, there is no "other side." 
</P>
<P>
It is that approach that has been utilized in the psychology class at the high 
school. The instructional unit is about different life styles. The gay and 
lesbian guest speakers are there to discuss the impact of being "different." 
They discuss how their life style has affected family, friends and self. They 
are explicitly prohibited from trying to persuade, indoctrinate or convince the 
students of the virtues of the homosexual life style. 
</P>
<P>
That heterosexuality is the mainstream, preferred life style of the vast 
majority of the population is implicitly clear in the context of the 
instructional unit. In previous years, convicted felons have been brought to 
school to talk about the impact of their "different" life styles on family, 
friends and self. 
</P>
<P>
They did not extol the virtues of a life of crime. No one suggested that there 
was a need to provide "equal time" for proponents of the law-abiding life 
style. For similar reasons there is no need, in the current situation, to 
provide "equal time" for the advocacy of heterosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
Homosexuality is obviously an emotional issue with some people. However, it is 
important to remember that it is neither unlawful nor is it considered, in 
medical terms, to be an illness. While some individuals and some religious 
groups may condemn it as immoral, others do not. 
</P>
<P>
The approach that the teacher in this situation has taken, the presentation of 
the subject matter in an objective, rational manner and the avoidance of 
moralistic/sectarian judgments -- is both pedagogically and legally sound.

TITANS SILENCE GAUCHOS BY SCORING 74-69 UPSET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There was a horde of UC Santa Barbara fans doing a pretty fair job of turning 
Cal State Fullerton's 4,000-seat Titan Gym into a Thunderdome-South Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
They failed in one major respect. The Gaucho fans might have won the noise 
battle, but the Titans won the game, breaking open a 16-point lead and staving 
off a frenetic comeback for a 74-69 upset in front of 3,644 fans, a majority of 
them out-of-towners. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton's upset had its first stirrings in Wayne Williams' 35-foot shot at 
the halftime buzzer. It was a shot that Coach John Sneed called "a shot in the 
arm" -- and it put Fullerton up by 7 points and into a mode to win. 
</P>
<P>
Matter of fact, when Williams hit that shot and met teammate Derek Jones in an 
embrace at midcourt, you would have thought the Titans already had won. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," said Williams, who finished with 14 points, "it was pretty exciting." 
</P>
<P>
"We needed a boost, and Wayne's shot gave it to us," Fullerton Coach John Sneed 
said. "I think our kids have played well in some big games; it was nice to 
finally come up with a big win." 
</P>
<P>
The real celebration could only come later, after Fullerton survived a Gaucho 
comeback, led by the aggressive drives of guards Carlton Davenport and Carrick 
DeHart, the former Santa Monica High School backcourt tandem. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton had been up by 16 with 15 minutes to play. But DeHart put together a 
3-point play and a driving jumper to help cut it to 9. The teams traded baskets 
awhile, but with a chance to cut it to 7, DeHart took one giant, high-dribble, 
sweeping step around Mark Hill and drove in for a layup, cutting it to 58-51 
with 9 minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara cut it to 70-69 with 1 minute left on a 17-foot jumper by 
Davenport. But Cedric Ceballos, fouled on a drive with 16 seconds left and the 
shot clock down to 6, made both ends of a 1-and-1 for a 72-69 lead. 
</P>
<P>
On Santa Barbara's final possession, with time running out, Fullerton's Rashone 
Lewis saved the game with a block of Mike Doyle's 3-point attempt with 3 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
"I just went up with him on the shot," said Lewis, a sophomore who is playing 
his first college season. "Coach told us they'd go to him or DeHart." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he feared a foul whistle on the play, Lewis shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
"Besides, they needed 3 points, not 2." 
</P>
<P>
The possession on the jump ball went to Fullerton, and Mark Hill made 2 free 
throws when he was fouled with a second left. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a great win for us," said Jones, the team leader despite scoring only 
2 points and fouling out with 11 minutes to play. "It was what we needed after 
the loss to UCI. We let that one get away, and we were down. We came out and 
played our hearts out. . . . Their crowd was a little more boisterous than 
ours. We knew that we'd have to do something to get our fans into it. Wayne's 
shot and Cedric's dunks did that." 
</P>
<P>
It was Fullerton's play in the early going of the second half that got things 
really going. Ceballos drove for a layup and a 9-point lead on the first 
possession. After trading baskets, David Moody tipped the ball in off a miss by 
Ceballos, and as quick as that, Fullerton led 41-30, with just two minutes gone 
in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
But it was a couple of plays by Ceballos that made the lead emphatic -- a 
360-reverse dunk off a steal by Jones, and a high-lofting hook. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton's biggest lead came with 15 minutes left, 50-34, on two free throws 
by Williams. 
</P>
<P>
It was a game that began oddly, without Santa Barbara Coach Jerry Pimm on the 
bench. Pimm was so ill that he had contemplated staying in his hotel room. But 
20 minutes before the game began, he changed his mind. He walked into the gym 
with the game under way. 
</P>
<P>
When he arrived, he entered a gym that might have been two hours north of 
Fullerton, in the Gauchos' Events Center -- fondly dubbed the Thunderdome -- 
for all the support the Gauchos were getting. It was a night on which chants of 
"defense, defense," were no particular indication which team had the ball. 
Fullerton players were even subject to being razzed at the free throw line. 
</P>
<P>
But the result was one that couldn't have happened in the Thunderdome -- at 
least not so far this season. The Gauchos are undefeated there, but have lost 3 
Big West Conference games on the road, falling to 15-3. 
</P>
<P>
"The big point for us was the end of the half, when they got that lead," Pimm 
said. "And we couldn't guard Ceballos, he's just so much better offensively 
than us." 
</P>
<P>
Ceballos led all scorers with 26 points. Hill added 24 for Fullerton, and Mike 
Doyle led the Gauchos with 20. 
</P>
<P>
The loss -- coupled with UC Irvine's victory over Nevada Las Vegas -- 
diminishes the buildup for the Gauchos' meeting with the Rebels Monday night, 
the first game between the teams since Santa Barbara's two upsets last season. 
</P>
<P>
That game once appeared as if it would be for the conference title; that now 
looks less likely. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton is 9-10 overall, 4-6 in the conference.

MASTER OF THE MATS; 
</P>
<P>
HE'S THE REASON WRESTLING IS GRAND AT CANYON; 
</P>
<P>
COACH GARY BOWDEN HAS A DYNASTY ON HIS HANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE LOWERY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the banks of the Riverside Freeway, underneath the mega-dwellings that dot 
Anaheim Hills, stands Canyon High School. And in the Canyon High gym, in its 
cavernous wrestling room, is a partially bald, barrel-chested man who failed at 
virtually every sport he tried, including a two-day, eighth-grade stint as a 
tackling dummy. 
</P>
<P>
This is Gary Bowden, The Bear to his 100-plus kids, Master Manipulator to those 
who have seen him operate and architect/coach of the best wrestling team in 
Orange County this decade. 
</P>
<P>
His Canyon teams have won three Southern Section 4-A championships (1984, 1987 
and 1988) and are ranked No. 1 in that division this season. Overall -- that's 
varsity, junior varsity and frosh-soph -- Canyon has a combined dual-meet 
record of 399-30-2 in the 1980s, a winning percentage of .928. 
</P>
<P>
In the past nine years, the varsity has finished seasons ranked No. 1 in Orange 
County four times, No. 2 four times and No. 3 once. It has won nine consecutive 
Century League championships, and Tuesday, against Santa Ana Valley, it will 
very likely win its 50th consecutive league dual meet. 
</P>
<P>
"Canyon (wrestling) is the envy of the county," said Terry Lorentzen, Edison 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
And it's all because there is always some part of Gary Bowden, body and/or 
soul, in the gym. 
</P>
<P>
"He is Canyon wrestling," said Harris Oishi, a Canyon assistant for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
During the season, Bowden puts in 40 hours a week coaching and when he's not 
coaching, he's thinking about coaching -- a fact that has aggravated his 
chronic insomnia to the point that he has to take sleeping pills the night 
before a match. 
</P>
<P>
Bowden says he's learning to relax but that's news to his wife, Judy. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll be working in the yard but I'll know what's going through his mind is 
who's going to wrestle at 119 (pounds) next season," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Added assistant coach Mike Gayer: "The man is a stress monster." 
</P>
<P>
Bowden, 41, is the only wrestling coach Canyon has had. In 15 years, the man 
who never considered coaching as a career in high school or college has learned 
to do some things very well, but none as proficiently as recruiting 
non-athletes and transforming them into very good wrestlers. 
</P>
<P>
Here's typical Bowden: 
</P>
<P>
 "Pardon me, are you a wrestler? You're not? You look like a wrestler, did you 
know that? You're an athlete, I can tell that by the way you walk, but you also 
walk like a wrestler. I've been around wrestling 20 years and I know a wrestler 
when I see one. If you're not a wrestler, you should be one." 
</P>
<P>
 So maybe you've heard better lines at office parties, but the bottom line is 
this: Bowden got 110 kids to come out for wrestling this season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's incredible," Gayer said. "He gets kids who have no business being out for 
a sport or kids who are much better at basketball or soccer to come out and he 
makes them good wrestlers. He's to wrestling what Ronald Reagan is to 
politics." 
</P>
<P>
The fact is Bowden has turned numerous kids who had little background in sports 
into champions of one kind or another. 
</P>
<P>
Take Matt Shaff, whose most conspicuous physical feature was three scoops of 
brown hair piled on top of a 90-pound body when he caught Bowden's eye four 
years ago. Shaff was weak -- "If you had asked me to drop and give you one 
push-up, I couldn't have done it." -- and had little experience in organized 
sports. Still, Bowden promised that he would one day be a 190-pound "stud" if 
he came out for wrestling. 
</P>
<P>
The result? Shaff is a senior wrestling on the junior varsity, nothing to be 
ashamed of since Canyon's junior varsity is better than a good portion of the 
county's varsity squads. In 1984, the Canyon junior varsity went to a varsity 
wrestling tournament at Brea-Olinda High and won the championship. 
</P>
<P>
Shaff can now bench-press 160 pounds and is willing, bordering on frantic, to 
drop and give you 25 push-ups. 
</P>
<P>
His body, however, fell 70 pounds short of the 190-pound goal. 
</P>
<P>
"That doesn't matter, I feel like I'm 190 pounds," he said. "And I don't feel 
bad about not making the varsity. Our whole program is so strong, just to be a 
part of it makes you feel great. Anyway, I look up on the wall and I see the 
pictures of those wrestlers and a lot of them never made it to varsity and look 
where they are." 
</P>
<P>
Where they are is on the walls surrounding the wrestling room, Canyon's 
wrestling hall of fame. Now 80 members strong, it's a collection of young men 
frozen in awkward wrestling poses -- elbows drawn close to their bodies, 
fingers extended -- which makes it appear they are really into tickling. 
</P>
<P>
There is Rocky Flint, Canyon's only state champion, and Tim O'Neil, a state 
runner-up revered as the school's greatest wrestler because of his work ethic. 
There are the nine Southern Sections champions, as well as numerous league 
champions. 
</P>
<P>
But there are also the likes of Darrin Louder, another kid who never made it to 
the varsity, but who "had absolute integrity," according to Bowden. And there 
is Charlie Armendarez, a so-so varsity wrestler who was "trustworthy." 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a lot of very good wrestlers who never got on the wall," Bowden 
said. "Winning isn't what it's all about." 
</P>
<P>
No, joss is. Webster's dictionary defines joss as a Chinese god or idol. Bowden 
has added that it is the great ethical balance of the cosmos. If one is asked 
to do 10 push-ups and only does nine, joss will eventually get him. 
</P>
<P>
"He tells you, 'Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but in the last 30 seconds 
of an overtime match, joss will get you,' " said wrestler Brad Mugar. "He makes 
you scared to ever cheat." 
</P>
<P>
Once Bowden set off on a six-mile run, only to have his ankle quickly throb 
with pain. Bowden, in agony, finished the run, nearly collapsing at the end. 
</P>
<P>
"That's joss, too," he said. "Once you've set a goal, you have a moral 
responsibility to yourself to try and achieve it. That's what I'm trying to 
teach. 
</P>
<P>
"You look at the kids who come out for high school sports and very few of them 
are really championship athletic material. Most kids are average. The key is to 
get average kids to work like champions. If you work like a champion, you go up 
on the wall." 
</P>
<P>
Bowden knows a thing or two about being average since, growing up, it was 
something he could shoot for. 
</P>
<P>
Bad at sports? He quit football in eighth grade after a two-day pounding. He 
tried basketball. "I had no clue what I was doing; it was a joke," he said. 
</P>
<P>
So he quit. 
</P>
<P>
He tried baseball. "I might have liked it if I could ever have hit the ball," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
So he quit. 
</P>
<P>
Then, he tried wrestling. He liked it, he worked hard at it and as a 115-pound 
freshman attending high school in Loveland, Colo., he went 0-5 and was pinned 
all five times. 
</P>
<P>
The family moved to Long Island, N.Y., during his sophomore year, where he went 
a nifty 4-6-2, followed by a break-even, 6-4-2, his junior year. 
</P>
<P>
By the time his family moved to Fullerton, where he attended Sunny Hills High, 
Bowden had progressed to become a good 157-pound wrestler, finishing with a 
12-4-1 record. 
</P>
<P>
But the memory of those first three years seems to push him and will not allow 
him to cut a wrestler from the program, no matter how large the turnout. 
</P>
<P>
"If they want to come out, we'll always work to find them people and places to 
wrestle," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It's also why one of his fondest memories is of a wrestler winning his first 
match after going winless for two years. 
</P>
<P>
"I was jumping and yelling and whistling," Bowden said. "I picked him up when 
he came off the mat and ran around with this kid, whose record is now 1-29, but 
that was one of the most thrilling moments I've ever had. To see that smile on 
his face, I projected myself into that. I remember what it was like to be a 
loser." 
</P>
<P>
Remembering is important to Bowden, a history teacher, who puts together 
copious accounts of each season in book form. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes me four hours a day for at least a month to do it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The year in review contains team records, inspirational poems and newspaper 
clippings. It has pictures of the girls who belong to the wrestling service 
organization Bowden created and dubbed the "Mat Maids." The "Mat Maids" are so 
popular at Canyon that more girls (75) tried out for the group than boys (70) 
tried out for the football program. 
</P>
<P>
The book chronicling the 1987-88 season contains more than 60 pages and its 
highlight, as with the other books, is the year-by-year recounting of the most 
memorable matches in Canyon history. 
</P>
<P>
One can relive O'Neil defeating Lakewood's Ray Gullmatico, a state champion who 
had beaten him 10 times, in the 1980 Masters' Tournament. Or Flint, in his 
first varsity match filling in for an injured teammate, defeat a Southern 
Section champion. Who will ever forget when Art Bone made his legendary throw 
of El Modena's Fernando Santiago in 1985 or when Dan Tisone pinned an opponent 
after being down, 11-0? 
</P>
<P>
When members of the hall of fame return, practice is stopped and they are 
introduced along with their legend. Most of the kids already know the stories. 
Wrestlers are quizzed before each season about the highlights and stars that 
have come through the program. Those who fail "pay with some serious physical 
work," according to Bowden. 
</P>
<P>
History and tradition are important. So how long before Bowden himself is 
history? He says he's made a commitment of five years beyond this season. After 
that, "Who knows?" he says.

BOYS' BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSE KEYS OCEAN VIEW'S 52-38 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ocean View High School forced Huntington Beach to try something new Saturday -- 
outside shooting. 
</P>
<P>
The Seahawks went to a 2-3 zone, halting the Oilers' inside game and limiting 
them to nine field goals in a 52-38 Sunset League victory before a capacity 
crowd at Ocean View. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach (11-10, 7-2) made nine of 53 shots (17%) and didn't score from 
the field until almost two minutes into the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View (16-6, 6-2) kept the ball away from Jeff Long, who usually goes 
inside for easy layups. 
</P>
<P>
"Huntington Beach is excellent inside with their short baskets," Ocean View 
Coach Jim Harris said. "The idea was to not let that happen." 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View took a quick 12-3 lead in the first quarter, but at halftime, the 
Seahawks' lead was cut to two points, 23-21, thanks to the Oilers' 11 of 14 
free throw shooting. 
</P>
<P>
But Ocean View opened up a lead in the third quarter and coasted to the victory 
in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
"We just didn't put the ball in the basket," Huntington Beach Coach Roy Miller 
said. "I've never had a team shoot that cold. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know whether to attribute it to their defense or the fact that 
everyone decided to be cold. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the team that the pressure was on Ocean View. I told them to relax and 
have fun. But I was surprised at how tight we were." 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View didn't have a great shooting day either, connecting on 18 of 46 
attempts for 39%. 
</P>
<P>
But the Seahawks dominated the boards and got steady performances from Darren 
Ernst (11 points, 16 rebounds) and Greg Evans (game-high 15 points). 
</P>
<P>
Joey Kijewski led Huntington Beach with 11 points. 
</P>
<P>
LARRY NISTA 
</P>
<P>
Edison 48, Marina 46 -- Steve Thobe sank two free throws with 30 seconds left 
to put the Chargers up by six points as Edison (12-12, 5-3) withstood a late 
rally by Marina (2-6 in league play). Sean Hafelrig of Marina led all scorers 
with 13 points. 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley 66, Westminster 40 -- Mike Cook scored 15 points and pulled in 
10 rebounds to lead visiting Fountain Valley (17-5, 5-3). Don Shaw was 
Westminster's leading scorer with 14. 
</P>
<P>
In Olympic League boys' basketball: 
</P>
<P>
Orange Lutheran 83, Valley Christian 78 -- Pat Bagatourian led host Orange 
Lutheran (19-3, 12-0) with 30 points and teammate Daryl Cole added 24. Mike 
Blackstead was the leading scorer for Valley Christian (7-5, 16-6). 
</P>
<P>
Whittier Christian 99, Whitney 70 -- Whittier Christian had everybody score in 
a romp over Whitney at Sonora High School. Matt Riehm led the way with 27 
points and Paul McKinley added 21. Whittier Christian is 16-6, 9-3. Whitney 
(1-10 in league play) was led by Adrian Keller with 17 points. 
</P>
<P>
Ontario Christian 76, Capistrano Valley Christian 60 -- Jason Rodarmel led 
Capistrano Valley Christian (5-16, 2-10) with 15 points but it was not enough 
as the Eagles lost at home. 
</P>
<P>
Brethren 55, Santa Margarita 50 -- Dan Bathey led Santa Margarita (7-14, 2-10) 
with 18 points.

OLD TOWN IRVINE IS BRAND NEW; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPERS STAKING THEIR $20-MILLION RESTORATION ON NOSTALGIA AND A LITTLE 
SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL FLAGG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over in the corner of the Knowlwood restaurant at Old Town Irvine, there are 
some odd marks burned into a wooden wall. 
</P>
<P>
When this was a blacksmith's shop, those marks were the brands of the ranches 
hereabouts. The blacksmith used them for reference when making new branding 
irons. 
</P>
<P>
The shop was at the center of Irvine, when the city was a small farming 
community at the turn of the century. The railroad depot was here, near where 
the tracks met Sand Canyon Avenue; so was a school, a silo for the tons of lima 
beans harvested each year, a general store, a bunkhouse for the ranch's cowboys 
and later the first Ford dealership in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Now, most of the lima bean fields are covered with streets and pastel-colored 
subdivisions, low-slung industrial buildings and boxy office towers of tinted 
glass: A city of 98,000 that did most of its growing in just the last 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
And the buildings of Old Town, once ramshackle and derelict, have been spruced 
up to entice the yuppies of Irvine, the Marines from the nearby El Toro air 
station and passers-by on the adjacent Santa Ana Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Old Town is probably the largest restoration project in Orange County, a 
$20-million gamble that is too new to tell whether it will succeed. Will people 
want to stay at a hotel made from a concrete grain silo? Can the nearby 
corrugated metal warehouse find the right mix of tenants to keep shoppers 
coming back? Those are the sort of questions that pester Robert B. Smith. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Talk With Tenants 
</P>
<P>
On a recent weekday afternoon, Smith wheeled his Jaguar into the parking lot of 
La Quinta Inn at Old Town and got out to talk to his tenants. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, 43, is one of the general partners behind Old Town. He has a doctorate 
in psychology and teaches at Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa when he's not 
developing small real estate projects. Old Town is his largest project. 
</P>
<P>
Calling each tenant by name, Smith stops for a fresh-squeezed orange juice at 
the Orange Inn Cafe &amp; Market and for a shooter of tequila at Tia Juana's 
Long Bar &amp; Mexican Cafe -- "Longest Bar in Orange County" -- where a 
well-dressed, after-work crowd is just trooping in. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried not to have chains in here," said Smith as he shows a guest around 
Tia Juana's enormous, 9,000-square-foot restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a chance to make deals with people like Denny's, but we wanted our 
tenants to have a uniqueness." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Split Personality 
</P>
<P>
Still, Old Town seems to have a touch of retailing's version of the split 
personality. At the far end of the 6.5-acre project is Knowlwood, basically a 
fast-food joint, and at the other end is a snazzy, expensive wine shop called 
Sirus Cellars where customers can find unusual vintages and can store their 
purchase in their own rented wine cellar. 
</P>
<P>
The idea is to delicately balance the mix of stores and restaurants to appeal 
to the widest spectrum of customers, from the Marines at the nearby air base to 
Irvine professionals to older people from the Leisure World retirement 
community down the freeway, said Tim Sloat, a broker for Scher-Voit Commercial 
Brokerage Co., who is leasing the project. Yet the stores have to be unique 
enough to keep people coming back. 
</P>
<P>
And since there's room for only a few more stores or restaurants at Old Town, 
the choices had better be right, Sloat said. Bad choices could take the other 
retailers down with them. 
</P>
<P>
"The decision was to provide as wide a range of retailers as possible, 
excluding the typical neighborhood shopping center tenants like dry cleaners, 
frozen yogurt places and chain pizza operations," Sloat explained. 
</P>
<P>
"We also had to be careful not to run the risk of having a cheap imitation of 
Knott's Berry Farm, in which case people would laugh at us." 
</P>
<P>
There is actually a glut of store space in most of Orange County, but not in 
Irvine or, for that matter, in the whole southern half of the county. The south 
county is growing so fast -- that's where all the undeveloped land is -- that 
there are still plenty of customers. In the northern half of the county, where 
population growth is slower, video stores, pizza shops and convenience stores 
have multiplied so rapidly that they're stealing each other's customers. 
</P>
<P>
So even though two-thirds of the retailers who want to move into Old Town 
probably aren't suitable, Sloat says, there are still plenty left to choose 
from. 
</P>
<P>
Monthly rental rates are about average for Irvine, from $1.75 to $2.50 per 
square foot, plus the tenant's share of property taxes, insurance and 
maintenance. And so are the amounts of money Old Town grants tenants to 
decorate their stores, say other real estate brokers with experience in the 
Irvine market. 
</P>
<P>
While the restored buildings are fairly snazzy, one thing that keeps rents down 
is the fact that Old Town really isn't centrally located in Irvine -- it's on 
the eastern end -- and it isn't really on the way to anywhere in that part of 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Top Producer in Chain 
</P>
<P>
Still, Knowlwood -- one of a small, family-owned chain of five stores -- is the 
top producer in the chain, employees say. It's now doing $100,000 a month. 
Knowlwood is one of the older burger stores in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Tia Juana's, which just opened last fall, took in $7,000 one recent Friday 
night and hopes to do up to $200,000 a month this year, says Dan Neyenhuis, a 
casually dressed veteran of the restaurant industry who is one of the owners. 
His partners also own an interest in the Crazy Horse Steak House, a successful 
country and Western venue in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange Inn -- now doing business in what was once the Ford dealership's 
building -- is a historic eatery once located on Coast Highway near Corona del 
Mar. It was forced to move by the Irvine Co.'s plans to develop the coastal 
hills as a resort. The inn is still searching for its market, Smith says, but 
altogether the restaurants are doing quite well. 
</P>
<P>
Though the project still has a way to go, it is a far cry from 1984, when the 
buildings were tumbling down and the prospects for restoration seemed nil. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Moves to Save General Store 
</P>
<P>
In fact, one of them -- the old general store, now rehabilitated and soon to be 
leased by a gift shop -- was squarely in the way of an Irvine Co. project to 
widen Sand Canyon Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Irvine asked the company -- which was started by the Irvine family 
and is now the largest private landholder in the county -- if there were some 
way that the old store could be saved. 
</P>
<P>
The company contacted James W. (Walkie) Ray, president of J. Ray Construction 
Co. in Irvine, who had worked with the Irvine Co. before. Ray brought in Smith, 
the psychologist, whom he had met in the early 1970s when they were both young 
professionals living on the same street in Costa Mesa. Since then, Smith has 
been Ray's partner in several small developments. 
</P>
<P>
The builder and the psychologist walked around the weedy area looking at the 
broken-down buildings -- the blacksmith's shop was so ramshackle that a Santa 
Ana wind might have blown it down if its big front doors hadn't always been 
open -- and decided that they might as well have a go at the lima bean silo, 
the corrugated metal warehouse -- the whole thing. Smith had read about a grain 
silo in Ohio that had been converted to a hotel. Why not go for it? 
</P>
<P>
The two talked the Irvine Co. into becoming a partner in return for kicking in 
the 6.5 acres. The company won a guarantee of $1 million off the top if Old 
Town is sold and 25% of the project. That is essentially a subsidy of the 
project, since 6.5 acres on the freeway could be worth a lot more if you were 
building office towers there, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, Ray, brother Michael D. Ray -- executive vice president of the family 
construction company -- and a Pasadena tax lawyer named Bernice Anglea were the 
general partners, owning 50%. Anglea was familiar with the tax breaks generated 
by restoring the historic buildings and putting them on the National Register 
of Historic Places. And she also helped sell most of the 30 limited partners, 
who put up $2.5 million that got the project started in return for the other 
25% of the project and most of the tax breaks. The limited partners could not 
have been enticed -- and the vital $2.5 million raised -- without the tax 
advantages, the general partners say. 
</P>
<P>
After recouping their original $400,000 investment from the limited partners, 
the four general partners have not had to put anything but their time and 
expertise into the deal, not even a dime. But they do have to cover any losses 
if the project doesn't work. That's a typical structure for such a deal. But 
the problems you can run into rehabilitating old buildings are anything but 
typical, and there have been a couple of scary moments for the partners. 
</P>
<P>
"There were more twists and turns than the Ortega Highway," Michael Ray said. 
</P>
<P>
The 40-year-old lima bean silo, left over from a time when Orange County 
produced more lima beans than anywhere in the world, had 32, six-sided concrete 
chambers for storing beans. In order to turn the chambers into motel rooms, 
construction crews would have to cut through 6 inches of concrete to create 
doors and windows. When Ray's construction company -- as general contractor -- 
put the work out to bid in 1985, the lowest bid came back 20% over what Ray had 
budgeted, or about $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to close the deal on the land in a few days, but we were over budget 
for this huge amount," Michael Ray said. "All along, the Irvine Co. had two 
options: They could believe in us or they could terminate the project. They 
believed in us." 
</P>
<P>
The partnership eventually solved the problem by raising more money and cutting 
some construction costs. The Texas-based motel chain -- which has a separate 
deal with the partnership -- wanted desperately to be in Irvine, desperately 
enough to run a motel where many of the rooms have rounded sides with walls of 
rough gray concrete. The rooms are furnished with rough-hewn wooden furniture 
and iron-railed beds in a Western motif. 
</P>
<P>
The motel -- three stories, 148 rooms -- is about 65% occupied on the average, 
Smith said, or at about the break-even point after a year. 
</P>
<P>
In the warehouse -- which now shelters Tia Juana -- the roof and sides had to 
be removed so the builder could add structural reinforcements. The cost was a 
staggering $70 a square foot, or "about what you could build a first-class, 
high-rise office building for in Orange County," Michael Ray noted. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, much of the risk in rehabilitating old buildings comes from 
uncertainty about how much it is going to cost, Smith said. "You start tapping 
into old walls like these," he said, pointing to the silo, "and you don't have 
any idea what you're going to find." 
</P>
<P>
Between those kind of problems and the fact that there simply aren't that many 
old buildings in relatively youthful Orange County -- just celebrating its 
Centennial this year -- it is not likely that there will be many more of these 
big restoration projects. 
</P>
<P>
But at least these buildings were saved, and they're likely to stay that way 
for a long time. In return for additional tax breaks, the partnership granted 
the city of Irvine control over the building's facades. That essentially means 
the buildings are protected and won't be replaced by office buildings or 
shopping malls anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
"Just because they're on the National Register of Historic Places doesn't 
necessarily protect them from being torn down," Smith said. "But since we gave 
the facades to Irvine, you can't even paint them without city approval."

SUPERCHARGER GIVES SECOND WIND TO AUTOMOTIVE ACCESSORY COMPANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF YIP, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHATSWORTH 
</P>
<P>
Six summers ago, Jim Davis, president of B&amp;M Automotive Products, settled 
into the driver's seat of a 1970 Chevrolet Chevelle and stomped on the gas 
pedal. Under the hood was a supercharger, a pump that forces extra air into the 
engine and can boost the horsepower by 40% to 60%. 
</P>
<P>
He still remembers the exhilarating speed and raw power. "The first thing that 
impressed me was that when you just barely touched the throttle, you could 
literally feel the horsepower," said Davis, 54. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, B&amp;M needed some extra oomph. The 30-year-old company had found 
success selling sophisticated automatic transmission kits that helped turn 
ordinary sedans into weekend drag-racers, but plenty of competitors had sprung 
up during the past decade, and B&amp;M's sales were stuck in neutral. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, a former record-holding drag-racer and advertising executive, needed to 
rev up B&amp;M's sales, and the supercharger did just that. The privately owned 
company started selling its supercharger in late 1983. Since then, the 
company's total annual sales have more than doubled, and last year 
superchargers accounted for 18% of B&amp;M's $16.5 million in sales. 
</P>
<P>
In all, B&amp;M has sold about 12,000 of the units, which retail from $1,200 to 
$2,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
"I would never have predicted the size of the initial sales," said Pat Ganahl, 
editor of Rod and Custom Magazine. "It was astronomical -- totally unheard of 
in this industry. The total number of superchargers sold previous to that would 
be probably in the hundreds." 
</P>
<P>
B&amp;M has "the best-selling supercharger," said Marlan Davis, technical 
editor of Hot Rod Magazine. "B&amp;M has gone through the trouble of 
engineering different kits for different cars." 
</P>
<P>
B&amp;M is not the only manufacturer of superchargers, nor are B&amp;M's models 
the most high-tech on the market. But B&amp;M's superchargers are 
overwhelmingly the most popular, and they have been designed to fit on a wide 
variety of models, including various Chevrolet, Ford, Buick, Chrysler and 
Toyota engines. 
</P>
<P>
Before Californians rush out to buy superchargers, they should know that 
B&amp;M's superchargers are not legal for street use on any American cars made 
after 1965 because they have not been granted exemptions from emission control 
laws by the state Air Resources Board. 
</P>
<P>
Still, this doesn't deter the hard-core enthusiasts who buy them, promising 
that they will be used off-road, and then putting them on street cars. "We 
don't advocate it," B&amp;M's Davis said. He said B&amp;M plans to obtain Air 
Resources Board exemptions for an upcoming supercharger that will fit 
late-model cars and work with factory fuel-injection systems. 
</P>
<P>
B&amp;M's success boils down to a new application of a technology that was 
established in the 1920s. Superchargers were used on such vintage luxury cars 
as Cords and Duesenburgs, but the technology all but disappeared in the 1960s 
when Detroit found that it was easier to attain comparable power by simply 
making bigger engines. 
</P>
<P>
Superchargers, or blowers, as they are also known, are the under-the-hood 
equivalents of the blow dryer. Installed on top of the intake manifold where 
the engine "breathes" and linked to the crankshaft by pulleys and belts, the 
supercharger rams more air into an engine. 
</P>
<P>
The result can be dramatic. Adding a B&amp;M supercharger to a factory-stock, 
180-horsepower Camaro engine would boost its horsepower to 250 and trim the 
time that it takes to cover a quarter-mile by about 1.3 seconds, said to George 
Wallace, B&amp;M's director of engineering. 
</P>
<P>
There are two markets for superchargers: drivers between 19 and 45 years old 
who want their cars and trucks to look impressive under the hood and go faster, 
and those who need the added power to haul big loads, such as tradesmen and 
recreational-vehicle owners. 
</P>
<P>
One reason for B&amp;M's success is that it came up with a compact 
supercharger. For years, modified truck superchargers have been used to propel 
professional 2,500-horsepower drag-racing cars. But it was rare for a car on 
the street to have one, and it was necessary to cut a hole in the hood for the 
supercharger to fit. B&amp;M's superchargers, however, nestle comfortably 
underneath many hoods, affording drivers extra power without drawing unwanted 
attention from police. 
</P>
<P>
B&amp;M's superchargers come with 30 pages of detailed installation and 
maintenance instructions. Somebody who doesn't know how to change a spark plug 
isn't going to want to tackle the installation, but a mechanic can do the job 
for about $700. 
</P>
<P>
The supercharger's lure, of course, is speed. Robert Bartholomew, a 47-year-old 
welder from Minnesota, installed a B&amp;M supercharger on his 1979 Chevrolet 
show car last spring. He spent 2 1/2 hours bolting the supercharger onto the 
Camaro's 400-cubic-inch engine. 
</P>
<P>
"After I put the blower on, it was unimaginable," Bartholomew said. He once got 
the supercharged Camaro up to 150 m.p.h. before he backed off because the 
handling got so dicey, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Turbocharging, a technology similar to superchargers, has become a popular, 
factory-installed option on everything from $9,000 Chevrolet Sprints to $75,000 
Porsches. Turbos have small propeller-like compressor wheels driven by the 
exhaust flow that forces additional air into the engine. 
</P>
<P>
But there is concern about the reliability of turbos. The turbos' turbines spin 
at up to 120,000 r.p.m. and can generate temperatures of 350 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
B&amp;M had investigated making turbochargers, but Davis was underwhelmed. "The 
biggest drawback is that turbochargers work at higher r.p.m., and the reality 
is that 90% of the time, you're driving at under 3,000 (r.p.m.)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
B&amp;M discussed selling an existing supercharger made by another company. But 
"our chief engineer said we could build our own at half the cost and they would 
be twice as good," Davis said. So B&amp;M came up with its own design. 
</P>
<P>
For all of its merits, a supercharger can tax an engine because owners tend to 
drive the cars harder. The supercharger's Achilles heel is detonation, or 
"pinging," and a proper tuneup is a must. 
</P>
<P>
Although superchargers have boosted B&amp;M's sales, two-thirds -- or $11 
million -- of its sales last year stemmed from various automatic transmission 
products: torque converters, shifters and shift kits. Davis figures that 
B&amp;M has 90% of the market for automatic transmissions sold in the United 
States to the so-called "aftermarket," made up of car buffs who tinker with 
their cars. 
</P>
<P>
The company's hottest-selling automatic transmission shifter retails for about 
$170. Called the Megashifter, it is popular because it looks and works like the 
more traditional "four-on-the-floor" shifter found on manual transmissions. The 
Megashifter and other top-line B&amp;M shifters enable a weekend drag-racer to 
shift gears manually for optimum acceleration. Last year, B&amp;M sold $5.9 
million worth of shifters, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
B&amp;M's ties to drag-racing are nearly as old as the company. B&amp;M was 
started in Van Nuys in 1953 as an auto-repair garage by Bob Spar and Mort 
Shulman. Spar's brother, Don, bought out Shulman's share shortly thereafter. 
B&amp;M evolved into a transmission specialty shop after the Spar brothers 
began winning races with their Oldsmobile, which had a four-speed automatic 
transmission that they modified and later put on the market. 
</P>
<P>
The company kept growing, but by the 1970s, the Spars were investing nearly all 
of their time in a now-defunct motor-home company, and B&amp;M's business 
suffered. In 1973, the brothers asked Davis, a former National Hot Rod Assn. 
record-holder who ran his own Detroit advertising agency, to run things. 
</P>
<P>
Davis came up with snazzy names for the shifters and transmission kits and 
rewrote B&amp;M's instruction sheets to make them easier to understand. But his 
key move was shifting B&amp;M's marketing focus from drag-racers to street 
enthusiasts. "For every drag-racer, there's a thousand street freaks," he said. 
And in 1987, the company expanded its product distribution to such major retail 
auto parts chains as Pep Boys and Chief. 
</P>
<P>
"Jim brings a business approach to an industry that's probably made up of guys 
who are not businessmen but are designers and racers and are hands-on guys," 
said Richard Paul, an engineer and owner of Latham Supercharger Co. 
</P>
<P>
Anytime Davis and B&amp;M's executives want hands-on experience, they don't 
have to go far. "This is the toy room," Davis said with a smile as he opened 
the door to a spacious garage, just a few steps from his office. 
</P>
<P>
Davis shows off his company's newest project cars -- a low-slung Chevrolet 
Camaro IROC-Z, a 1932 Ford roadster and a supercharged Ford Mustang that is 
being developed in conjunction with Ford Motorsport. 
</P>
<P>
The secret to keeping B&amp;M rolling is a constant stream of new products, he 
said, and the company spends 3% of its sales on research and development. But 
Davis also relies on some seat-of-the-pants evaluation. He likes to take a car 
out and step on the gas.

<TEXT>
<P>
Charles R. Whitlock is a businessman who claims to have earned millions of 
dollars from starting several small companies. On March 3, 1985, he suffered a 
heart attack at age 42 while having dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Whitlock survived the attack, and while he recovered he searched for one book 
or magazine that had all the diet, exercise and psychological help that a heart 
attack victim would need to stay healthy. There was none. 
</P>
<P>
So as an inveterate entrepreneur, Whitlock last year started HeartCorps 
magazine, "a self-help journal" for heart patients. The bimonthly publication, 
which premiered last summer, is getting early raves from patients, doctors and 
insurance companies, said Whitlock, who is the magazine's publisher. No less a 
personage than Dr. Michael E. DeBakey, the famous heart surgeon in Houston, has 
lent his name to HeartCorps' advisory board. 
</P>
<P>
Things are going so well that another health-related magazine, Hippocrates, 
which is half-owned by Time, already has offered to buy HeartCorps for $2 
million, Whitlock said. 
</P>
<P>
The story of HeartCorps, in fact, would likely have made another chapter in a 
book Whitlock wrote 2 years ago, titled "10 Ways You Can Earn $1 Million This 
Year," in which he reveals his secrets of success. The book's cover shows 
Whitlock standing next to a limousine in front of his $1-million house. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a magic touch," said William L. Bush, a former hospital manager whom 
Whitlock hired as HeartCorps' editor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Other Side 
</P>
<P>
Maybe not. As Whitlock's book was coming out in 1987, he was filing for 
personal bankruptcy protection in federal court in Los Angeles. Meanwhile, a 
windmill-energy company he helped start a few years earlier also was filing for 
protection from creditors in bankruptcy court. And just as embarrassing, the 
house pictured on Whitlock's book doesn't belong to him anymore. His bankruptcy 
led to foreclosure on it. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't the first time Whitlock had stumbled financially. He had filed for 
personal bankruptcy in Green Bay, Wis., in 1969, although he neglected to 
mention that in his book. Whitlock said he "elected not to include it." 
</P>
<P>
And, Hippocrates says it has not offered to buy HeartCorps, it has only held 
exploratory talks with the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Although his financial setbacks aren't in his book, Whitlock said recently that 
"half the battle in this life is to be able to get back up and dust yourself 
off." In many ways, his hopes of returning to financial health depend on the 
success of HeartCorps magazine. 
</P>
<P>
How did Whitlock find himself in such a deep hole? His problems stemmed from 
Airtricity, a venture he helped start in 1982, which built and maintained 
powered windmills in the aftermath of the oil-shocked 1970s, when alternative 
energy was all the rage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tax Incentives 
</P>
<P>
The windmills were popular with investors, largely because of tax incentives, 
and Whitlock said about 3,000 of his windmills are among the wind farms that 
populate the desert near Palm Springs. Whitlock was president and owned 39% of 
Airtricity. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1986, the tax incentives were repealed, world oil prices collapsed from 
around $30 a barrel to $10, and interest in alternative energy waned. By May, 
1987, Airtricity had fled to federal bankruptcy court amid a flurry of lawsuits 
among the company, its management, creditors and investors. 
</P>
<P>
Whitlock said some Airtricity investors and creditors sought damages directly 
from him, and that most of his money had been invested in Airtricity, both of 
which led to his personal bankruptcy filing. 
</P>
<P>
Whitlock claims to have made millions, but according to the filing, the 
millions had vanished. He listed total assets of $1.22 million, but $1.2 
million of that was the market value of his 5,500-square-foot house in the 
exclusive North Ranch district between Westlake Village and Thousand Oaks. His 
debts totaled $986,946, including a $738,276 mortgage on the house, and more 
than $93,000 of bank and credit-card debt. 
</P>
<P>
After filing for bankruptcy protection, he hoped to sell the house, pay off his 
mortgage and use his $460,000 of equity in the house to pay off other 
creditors. But he discovered that the house was built on loose, shifting land, 
and he could not sell the property, Whitlock said. 
</P>
<P>
So Whitlock's lender, Glendale Federal Savings &amp; Loan, foreclosed on the 
property last August by purchasing it for the amount left on the mortgage. 
Proceeds to Whitlock? Zero. And "the builder had gone bankrupt, so there was no 
recourse through him," Whitlock said. 
</P>
<P>
Whitlock's book recounts how he started each of his businesses, along with 
advice and upbeat tips: "Be prepared to work hard, but be positive about your 
own capabilities." Chapter 2 is titled "The First Million(s)," and Whitlock 
lists in detail what "action steps" the reader must take to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
The book also portrays a man constantly searching for greener pastures. Born 
and raised in Chicago, Whitlock says he snuck into the Marine Corps at age 12 
by altering his birth certificate, took basic training and then was honorably 
discharged after admitting his true age. He claims to have done it again at age 
14, only this time he joined the Air Force and studied electronics. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next 25 years, Whitlock's resume fattened considerably. He says he 
started a firm that made printed circuit boards in Illinois, started a 
Chicago-area magazine devoted to the circuit board industry, briefly became a 
police officer in Lexington, Ky., revitalized another circuit board company in 
Eveleth, Minn., started a Green Bay, Wis., firm that serviced medical 
equipment, and spent brief stints as a medical marketing officer at such large 
industrial companies as Honeywell, Bendix and Baxter Travenol. 
</P>
<P>
Next, having moved to Southern California, he started a Woodland Hills company 
to sell add-on products for dialysis machines, started a company to extract 
silver from hospital X-rays, started a firm that provided security guards for 
hospitals and then started Airtricity. 
</P>
<P>
Whitlock said some of the firms he started were later sold to other 
corporations, giving him money to plow into his next venture. The security 
business, for instance, was sold to Bekins, he said. Others, such as the 
circuit board magazine, were unable to compete in their markets and were 
discontinued. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Poor at Maintenance' 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a concept man," he said. "I'm very poor at long-term maintenance. I'm very 
good at getting something launched and started and built up to a certain 
level." 
</P>
<P>
Whitlock says he got a bachelor's degree in business from LaSalle Extension 
University in Chicago and an MBA from American University in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Whitlock's personal bankruptcy case was formally discharged by the court in 
October, and, in the meantime, he managed to raise about $200,000 from 
consulting jobs and loans to help start HeartCorps magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Now, 125,000 copies of each HeartCorps issue are printed at a cost of $180,000, 
but paid subscriptions total only about 10,000, editor Bush said. An additional 
70,000 are being sent to hospitals, cardiac-rehabilitation centers and other 
medical facilities nationwide in the hope of luring subscribers. Another 55,000 
copies are handled by U.S. and Canadian newsstands and bookstores, with about a 
third being sold, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Life Style Questions 
</P>
<P>
HeartCorps addresses various life-style questions facing heart patients. Its 
stories provide diet and exercise help, describe which medicines are "heart 
healthy" and help family members cope with a relative who has heart trouble. 
The current issue's cover story asks the question, "Should recovering 
heart-attack patients have sex?" The answer: Yes, but carefully. 
</P>
<P>
There is no question HeartCorps' potential audience is big. About 60 million 
Americans have some sort of heart disease, and each year 1 million of the 1.5 
million Americans who suffer heart attacks survive, according to the American 
Heart Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Whitlock said his priorities changed after his heart attack. "I don't work for 
money," he said. "I work to enjoy my life style, to live a healthy life and to 
help others do that." 
</P>
<P>
Heart disease remains the nation's biggest killer, accounting for more deaths 
than cancer and AIDS combined. 
</P>
<P>
But that doesn't automatically build a magazine's circulation. Jim Martay, 
executive publisher of Hippocrates, an 18-month-old magazine based in 
Sausalito, Calif., said, "We probably could identify 20 million people 
interested in health, but we're doing well at 500,000" circulation. In 
November, Time paid $9 million to buy 50% of Hippocrates. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Selling Ads 
</P>
<P>
He said the hard part of making health magazines successful is selling enough 
advertising. "That's part of the question we have, whether HeartCorps has 
enough potential on the ad side to succeed," Martay said. 
</P>
<P>
Whitlock and Bush asserted that HeartCorps' advertising is off to a fast start. 
Although advertisers often agree to place ads in a magazine's first issue only 
if it is free, 18 of the 24 ads in HeartCorps' 74-page debut issue were paid, 
and paid advertising is now running about 30 pages, Bush said. The magazine 
needs about 40 pages of ads to make money and Whitlock says that the magazine 
will be making money in a year. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the start-up and operating costs not covered by ads or subscriptions 
are picked up by HeartCorps' printer, Amway Corp. in Michigan. Also, HeartCorps 
is saving money by paying Amway with stock in the magazine instead of cash. 
Whitlock and Bush each still own 25% of HeartCorps; the rest is owned by Amway 
and other investors. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, giving a printer stock in exchange for its services is one of the 
techniques Whitlock's book prescribes for budding publishers who want to save 
cash. So Whitlock is following his own advice in the hope of making a financial 
comeback. 
</P>
<P>
Which brings to mind what B.C. Forbes, the late founder of Forbes magazine, 
once said: "You make more money selling advice than from following it."
