ISSUE OF INCREASING STAFF BUDGET PUTS COUNCIL ON SPOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
With severe budget constraints forming a politically unattractive backdrop, the 
San Diego City Council is scheduled to decide today whether to increase 
spending for a majority of its own members' staffs and related costs by more 
than $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
Making that already sensitive topic even more so, City Manager John Lockwood 
has told the council that, in order to meet the staffing and other requests -- 
which would raise the council's budget by nearly 10% -- money for a new police 
substation would have to be delayed or other existing city programs cut. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with those unpopular choices, some of the six council members seeking to 
increase their office budgets have charged, somewhat defensively, that 
political gamesmanship has unnecessarily heightened the stakes over what they 
regard as a modest request needed primarily to provide effective constituent 
service. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, some suggest that Lockwood, perhaps taking his cues from Mayor 
Maureen O'Connor's disdain for raising the council's $3.1-million staff budget, 
has deliberately boxed the members in a politically embarrassing corner, 
forcing them to choose between more police or bigger personal staffs. Although 
Lockwood and the mayor's aides dispute that characterization, some council 
members question why their request was lumped together for consideration today 
with a handful of more costly proposals -- notably, $3.5 million in potential 
legal expenses. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody's playing games, as far as I can see," said Councilman John Hartley, 
who hopes to hire one more aide. "It seems a little funny that the only way to 
do this is to cut police. It just looks like one of those typical budget games 
people play." 
</P>
<P>
But Lockwood, insisting that he is not "scheming . . . to make anyone look 
bad," describes the council's dilemma as being illustrative of "the tough 
choices that have to be made when there aren't any easy ones left." 
</P>
<P>
The only revenue now available for the additional council staff and related 
expenses -- including the remodeling of the two newest council members' offices 
-- is the city's so-called unallocated reserve, Lockwood explained. Totaling 
only $1 million in the city's $956.5-million fiscal 1990 budget, the reserve 
has already been reduced by half by earlier funding requests. 
</P>
<P>
"I have requests for upwards of $4 million and have only $500,000 left," 
Lockwood said. "Something has to give. The council needs to make a decision. 
And, if it wants to fund all of these things, I have to identify a revenue 
source." 
</P>
<P>
The tensions and suspicions underlying today's debate are indicative of the 
political delicacy that usually surrounds public officials' office budgets. 
Indeed, next to matters affecting their own salaries -- an even more 
controversial subject -- there are few matters that politicians prefer to 
discuss less than the size and cost of their staffs. 
</P>
<P>
Admittedly, the $304,200 increase being sought -- which includes $118,000 in 
staff costs and an estimated $122,000 for the remodeling and furnishing of the 
offices of council newcomers Hartley and Linda Bernhardt -- is minuscule 
contrasted with the city's overall budget. The council members recognize, 
however, that even a small increase in their own budgets sends the wrong 
signal, symbolically if not economically, to the public at a time when fiscal 
limitations have curtailed city services and prompted serious consideration of 
new taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the budget requests run counter to widespread expectations that last 
year's shift to district elections -- which narrowed council members' 
jurisdiction to one-eighth of the city -- might reduce the council's budget. 
</P>
<P>
For those and other reasons, probably the only ones on the council dais who 
will not be squirming uncomfortably when the topic comes up today will be 
O'Connor and the two members who have not requested additional staff funds -- 
Ron Roberts and Judy McCarty. 
</P>
<P>
Five other council members -- Hartley, Abbe Wolfsheimer, Wes Pratt, Bruce 
Henderson and Bob Filner -- have each asked for amounts ranging from $8,500 to 
$25,000 to hire one extra staffer, and Councilwoman Linda Bernhardt is seeking 
$26,800 to pay for two positions that she has already filled. Without the 
additional money -- needed to pay the two aides' salaries through June 30, the 
end of the city's current fiscal year -- one or both of those aides would have 
to be laid off, Bernhardt said. 
</P>
<P>
Because those requests come with less than five months remaining in fiscal 1990 
-- and, therefore, represent less than half of an annual salary -- they would, 
if approved, set the stage for presumably bigger staff cost increases next 
year. Most council offices now have six or seven staffers, with the members' 
annual budgets ranging from a low of $307,362 in Wolfsheimer's 1st District to 
Filner's $358,490 8th District allotment. 
</P>
<P>
Like the other council members seeking an increase, Bernhardt feels that her 
staffing request is being subjected to unduly harsh scrutiny because of the 
manner in which it was linked -- unfairly, she argues -- to the city's budget 
crisis in general and the police issue in particular in a report that Lockwood 
sent to the council last week. Moreover, Bernhardt stressed that, following her 
defeat of former 5th District Councilman Ed Struiksma last November, she 
received authorization from the city manager's office to fill the two 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
"When I came on the council, I was told that the money was there, that it would 
be no problem," Bernhardt said. "And now they're trying to make it out like 
this would come at the expense of police? Uh-uh. I don't think we're going to 
play that game today, guys. If they want to do that, I'll suggest we reopen the 
whole budget to look for other options." 
</P>
<P>
Bernhardt and Hartley account for more than two-thirds of the overall council 
budget-increase request, though, in fairness to them, that is largely because 
of some expenses that usually occur after a turnover on the council. The 
estimated $122,000 remodeling bill, for example, covers the expense of 
reconfiguring their offices to their satisfaction, as well as the cost of new 
furniture, rugs and wallpaper. 
</P>
<P>
"When we got here, the wallpaper was ripped and the seams on the rugs showed," 
Bernhardt said. "I was almost embarrassed to have people come in here for 
meetings." 
</P>
<P>
The two council newcomers also are seeking more than $55,000 in "transitional 
expenses" to purchase office supplies and pay other related office expenses. 
Bernhardt's share of that money is $28,000; Hartley's is listed in Lockwood's 
report as totaling $35,400, but Hartley aide Raquel Beltran said that figure 
includes $8,500 being sought to hire an additional receptionist. 
</P>
<P>
Hartley had an especially urgent need for the additional funds because his 
predecessor, Gloria McColl, inadvertently neglected to include certain 
non-personnel costs in the budget that she prepared last summer and Hartley 
inherited after defeating her. Skeptical of whether McColl's omission was, in 
fact, an oversight, Hartley -- who suspects it may have been a conscious effort 
to reduce staff costs in an election year -- found himself "pretty much on 
empty" when he took office. 
</P>
<P>
"The funds in that office were deficient for that or any other district," 
agreed Patricia Frazier, director of the city's Financial Management 
Department. Similarly, Bernhardt complained that "we couldn't find a pen or 
paper" when she took over Struiksma's old office. 
</P>
<P>
The "transitional" funds also cover costs associated with paying off McColl's 
and Struiksma's former staffers for their accrued vacation time -- expenses 
technically listed on their successors' budgets. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, council members have been reluctant to intrude in their 
colleagues' internal office affairs. That may not be the case today, however, 
because of Lockwood's framing of the issue as a cops-versus-staff question in 
which a bigger council budget could delay land acquisition for a police 
substation in Pratt's 4th District. Another factor that could figure 
prominently in the debate is the concern of the members not seeking budget 
increases that they might encounter public criticism regardless. 
</P>
<P>
"This might be a case where the public blames the council as a whole," Roberts 
said. "We need to ask ourselves whether spending this money this way does more 
for the city than maybe restoring some other services. To me, it's a move in 
the wrong direction." 
</P>
<P>
Paul Downey, O'Connor's press secretary, added that some San Diegans might 
interpret the move as an effort by some council members to "pad their staffs to 
protect against possible future cuts" in the event that voters approve a 
two-seat council expansion in June. If that ballot proposition is approved, 
O'Connor has proposed that the expansion be accomplished within the existing 
council budget -- a plan that would force current members to scale back their 
own offices to fund the new members' staffs. 
</P>
<P>
Defending the proposed increases, some council members and their aides contend 
that district elections not only did not reduce their responsibilities, but in 
fact increased demands from constituents. 
</P>
<P>
"You still have to make decisions on citywide issues, and, with the greater 
focus on districts, people want more service than ever before," said Bernhardt 
aide Chris Crotty. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts, however, said there has been "no noticeable difference" in requests to 
his office since voters approved the establishment of district elections in 
November, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't have to be a genius at math to wonder why you'd need more staff to 
deal with one-eighth of what you used to -- and one-tenth if the council is 
expanded," Downey added. "The question is, do people in the neighborhoods want 
to put more staff on the 10th floor of City Hall, or do they want more police 
on the streets?"

HAT TRICK NEEDED TO MAKE ARENA A REALITY; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: HARRY COOPER HAS YET HAS TO BREAK THE ICE IN MEETING THREE GOALS 
THAT WOULD ASSURE A DOWNTOWN SPORTS COMPLEX. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the parlance of one of the sports that he hopes to attract to a new downtown 
sports arena that he wishes to build, Harry Cooper needs to score a quick hat 
trick. 
</P>
<P>
With a March deadline approaching, Cooper, the La Jolla millionaire who last 
year acquired the existing Sports Arena lease and announced plans to replace it 
with a new downtown facility, finds himself needing to score three impressive 
goals -- a feat known in hockey as a "hat trick." 
</P>
<P>
In Cooper's case, the goals involve three interrelated objectives: lining up 
investors to bankroll the estimated $120-million-plus project, obtaining the 
City Council's blessing and luring professional hockey and basketball 
franchises to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
There also is this notable difference in the challenge facing Cooper: Although 
a hockey player can be pleased with a one- or two-goal performance, Cooper 
knows that, unless he scores three times, the game is lost. 
</P>
<P>
"Each part depends on the others -- accomplishing one makes the other things 
possible," Cooper conceded in an interview. "Investors don't want to get out 
front on a project like this until they're sure it's going to happen. The city 
-- for reasons I understand -- isn't going to commit itself until it's 
confident about our financial plan. And the leagues won't make any moves until 
they're sure the city is behind us." 
</P>
<P>
Though none of those goals is yet in hand, Cooper can show tangible progress on 
each as he points toward a 1994 target opening date for his proposed new arena: 
</P>
<P>
* A financial package -- anchored by a variety of potential tax breaks and 
plans to have a corporate sponsor pay up to one-third of the construction cost 
to have the arena named after it -- is "slowly jelling," Cooper says. 
</P>
<P>
* Several basketball franchises -- the Seattle SuperSonics and the New Jersey 
Nets are most often mentioned -- have expressed preliminary interest in 
possibly relocating here, and professional hockey's expansion plans hold 
promising possibilities for San Diego. Last week, Cooper announced that he has 
secured commitments from investors willing to put up $50 million to try to buy 
one of the seven new hockey franchises that the league plans to award during 
the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
* The city, although unlikely to provide direct financial aid because of budget 
constraints, is providing Cooper with a combination of moral support and 
technical expertise that has helped narrow the search for a downtown site to 
the Centre City East area. 
</P>
<P>
"Overall, the picture is becoming a little clearer," said City Architect Mike 
Stepner, who serves on a task force overseeing the project. "The outline is 
there, and more is being filled in as we go along." 
</P>
<P>
Under a timetable set by the City Council, Cooper is scheduled to update city 
leaders by early spring on the progress that he has made in the nearly one year 
since he unveiled his ambitious proposal to build a 22,900-seat "sports palace" 
downtown to replace the 24-year-old Midway area arena. 
</P>
<P>
That meeting will begin to provide definitive proof of whether Cooper's 
frequent sanguine predictions about the new arena -- and its prospects of 
housing professional sports -- are realistic or an overly optimistic assessment 
heavy on hype but thin on specifics. In particular, the session will help city 
leaders better evaluate Cooper's best-case scenario, which calls for ground 
breaking in 1992 and completion two years later, with pro basketball and hockey 
teams perhaps playing in the current Sports Arena for several seasons before 
the new one opens. 
</P>
<P>
Simple prudence, combined with memories of past arena deals that collapsed 
after promising beginnings, dictates that judgments be withheld pending that 
report. Significantly, however, a growing number of people inside and outside 
City Hall -- many of them initial skeptics -- have become cautious believers in 
the project and in Cooper's ability to succeed where numerous others have 
failed. Notably, Cooper's willingness to spend several hundred thousand dollars 
of his money on feasibility studies has allayed some early apprehensions. 
</P>
<P>
"He's definitely given me a lot more cause for optimism," said City Councilman 
Ron Roberts, who proposed the concept of a downtown arena in his 1987 campaign. 
"He's invested a lot of his own money in trying to push this ahead and has put 
together a very professional team that's been making progress on a number of 
fronts. I'm still not 100% convinced, but he's moved me in that direction." 
</P>
<P>
With the characteristic blend of infectious enthusiasm and dogged determination 
that helped him parlay the computer technology innovations that he pioneered 
into a personal fortune, Cooper says flatly: "This thing is going to happen. 
Whatever problems there are, we'll find the solutions. . . . Within five years, 
I expect to be sitting in the Palace watching hockey and basketball games." 
</P>
<P>
But while more than 2,000 San Diegans already have paid $50 deposits on 
potential basketball season tickets, their prospect of ever seeing a game in a 
new arena is far from, to use that sport's terminology, a slam dunk. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Cooper's three major objectives -- financing the arena, winning city 
backing and attracting professional franchises -- are formidable in and of 
themselves, but actually understate the daunting challenges facing him. In 
particular, each of those overall goals encompasses several equally difficult 
tasks. 
</P>
<P>
The financing, for example, has been complicated by the fact that property is 
considerably costlier and more difficult to assemble in downtown than in the 
area that Cooper first envisioned as the site for the new arena -- Sorrento 
Valley, where he owns a 38-acre tract. Describing downtown land prices as "a 
moving target" launched skyward by some property owners' attempts to capitalize 
on his plans, Cooper concedes that a downtown arena could cost as much as $20 
million more than one built in the city's northern regions. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, in his courtship of National Basketball Assn. and National Hockey 
League franchises, Cooper must convince league owners that teams can flourish 
in a city where as recently as the early 1980s -- when the NBA's Clippers 
defected to Los Angeles -- they could not survive financially. Moreover, he 
must overcome city officials' lingering reluctance to embrace, at least in this 
early stage, a plan similar to others that never got off the drawing boards 
after being announced with identical fanfare. 
</P>
<P>
"History is not our ally," Cooper concedes. "But I think we're overcoming that 
problem. The leagues and owners are willing to close the door on the past. No 
politician wants to be embarrassed by getting behind this and then have it fall 
apart, so I think I've also gotten as much help as I can reasonably expect from 
the city. The rest is up to us." 
</P>
<P>
Because the other parts of his plan are contingent upon selection of a site, 
the search for a suitable eight-block downtown location has dominated Cooper's 
efforts in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
Recognizing that publicity about his plans has driven up property owners' 
asking prices -- "Land I could have picked up cheap last year, now I can't 
afford," he laments -- Cooper is understandably reluctant to identify a 
specific site. City officials, however, say the top prospect is an area near 
the Metropolitan Transit Development Board bus yard, bordered by 12th and 
Imperial avenues and by 17th and J streets. Occupied primarily by warehouses 
and surface storage lots, the site offers the easy freeway and trolley access 
essential to the arena. 
</P>
<P>
Typically not one to second-guess himself, Cooper says he regrets having been 
so publicly expansive about his plans over the past year. Doing so, Cooper 
argues, served only to tip off land owners who saw his arena proposal as the 
means to a quick, inflated profit -- and to raise the stakes, should the deal 
fail. 
</P>
<P>
"If I could do anything differently, at that first press conference I should 
have just said that I had bought the old Sports Arena and planned to operate it 
forever," Cooper said. "Then, after quietly buying up the land we needed 
downtown, that would have been the time to talk about a new arena. 
</P>
<P>
"That would have been quicker and cheaper, and if it didn't work, it would have 
been only a personal disappointment," Cooper added. "Now, I feel like I'd be 
letting the whole city down if I walked away. That's why I plan to see this 
through, whatever it takes." 
</P>
<P>
Though Cooper is in the process of acquiring the needed development options, he 
acknowledges that the city's assistance -- via its condemnation powers for 
private property and help with the acquisition of the MTDB parcel -- probably 
will be needed to assemble enough land at a reasonable price. Land available 
for $20 per square foot prior to his proposal now is on the market for up to 
four times that cost, though last fall's opening of the bayfront Convention 
Center also contributed to that price surge. 
</P>
<P>
"My biggest concern is being priced out of downtown," Cooper said. "We keep 
getting pushed farther east and south -- farther than I wanted to be." As a 
result, initial plans to surround the arena -- for both aesthetic and economic 
reasons -- with a 400-room hotel, a 13-story office tower and 150 condominiums 
have been scrapped, Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
Aware that his original interest in building an arena in Sorrento Valley has 
left some city leaders and others skeptical of his commitment to a downtown 
site, Cooper feels constrained when discussing his concerns about the financial 
gap between the two locales. The higher cost of a downtown site is attributable 
not only to land prices, but also to the need to construct expensive parking 
garages, as compared to the cheaper surface parking lots that would be feasible 
in a suburban setting. 
</P>
<P>
"When I talk this way, the city says, 'There goes Cooper trying to bait and 
switch again,' " Cooper said. "They think I'm still looking for an excuse to 
build this in Sorrento Hills. Really, I'm just looking at the numbers. I'm 
committed to downtown, even though that means it costs more. There's just no 
way around that." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper originally had said that he would look to the city to cover any price 
differential between downtown and other potential sites. Meetings with City 
Council members and top city administrators, however, quickly dissuaded him of 
that notion, with Mayor Maureen O'Connor perhaps framing the economic and 
political realities in the bluntest terms. 
</P>
<P>
"In terms of priorities, I certainly don't see this being near the top of the 
city's list," O'Connor said. The message from O'Connor, who could either 
expedite the project by championing it or delay, even scuttle, it with her 
doubts, seems clear: Find a way to build a new downtown "sports palace" with a 
minimum of public aid, or don't build it at all. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with the city's apparent unwillingness to budge on that critical point, 
Cooper now hopes for a partnership with the city in the form of indirect public 
financial assistance -- a possibility that city officials seem more willing to 
explore. Those options include restructuring the current Sports Arena lease, as 
well as tax breaks premised on the assumption that a new downtown facility and 
redevelopment of the existing arena site will generate higher lease and tax 
revenues for the city. 
</P>
<P>
Under the current Sports Arena lease, the city receives about $250,000 
annually, according to Deputy City Manager Maureen Stapleton. Cooper estimates 
that a new arena not only would raise the city's annual lease and property-tax 
revenue to at least $3.5 million, but would also produce additional revenue 
from increased consumer spending of up to $50 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
"The city has ways to help with the financing other than just reaching into its 
pocket," Councilman Roberts said. "If a new arena is going to give the city a 
much-better return, it's in our best interests to explore all those 
possibilities." 
</P>
<P>
As he has from the outset, Cooper continues to insist that he would prefer an 
entirely privately financed project, with the largest chunks of money coming 
from sale of luxury skyboxes and the proposed sign deal that would permit a 
company to incorporate its title into the arena's name. The latter plan is 
patterned after Los Angeles Lakers' owner Jerry Buss' estimated 
$1-million-a-year contract with Great Western Bank that resulted in the Forum 
being renamed the Great Western Forum. 
</P>
<P>
From Cooper's perspective, any indirect public aid ultimately offered would be 
a necessary -- and justifiable -- byproduct of satisfying the city's insistence 
that the arena be built downtown. 
</P>
<P>
"If the cost is higher because of where the city wants it built, . . . it's 
only fair that that be taken into consideration," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Assuming that the site and financing questions are favorably resolved, Cooper 
professes confidence that the final piece of the arena puzzle -- the basketball 
and hockey franchises -- will quickly fall in place once it is certain that a 
new facility will be built. 
</P>
<P>
In perhaps his boldest statement on the subject, Cooper has gone so far as to 
suggest that an NBA team could play here as early as this fall if the council 
"sends a strong enough signal" at the March meeting. At other times, however, 
he backs off that audacious scenario, conceding that he may be "anywhere from 
several months to a year or so" away from having the firm commitments on a site 
and construction financing needed to even make San Diego a serious contender 
for a franchise. 
</P>
<P>
Once hopeful of obtaining a new NBA team -- a possibility dimmed by league 
officials' consistent denial of expansion plans in the near future -- Cooper 
now concedes that acquisition of an existing basketball franchise is a more 
realistic, though admittedly difficult, goal. 
</P>
<P>
Since last summer, Cooper and Honeywell executive Mannie Jackson have been 
seeking investors for an NBA franchise even as they attempt to gauge teams' 
interest in possibly relocating in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper and his Sports Arena partner, Richard Esquinas, had joined forces with 
Jackson when they learned that they had a common goal by virtue of the former 
Harlem Globetrotter's interest in acquiring an NBA franchise. Recognizing that 
they were largely unknown outsiders in the basketball world, Cooper and 
Esquinas felt that Jackson had both the sports and business background 
necessary to lend credibility to San Diego's bid. 
</P>
<P>
Their relationship recently was strained, however, when Jackson, who felt that 
he had an exclusive arrangement to try to bring a team here, learned that 
Cooper himself was making behind-the-scenes inquiries to teams. Cooper, 
however, calls the disagreement a misunderstanding, adding that he still hopes 
that Jackson "plays a role in whatever happens here." 
</P>
<P>
Describing preliminary negotiations with existing franchises as "very fragile, 
very sensitive," Cooper declined to name the teams that either he or his 
representatives have approached. Others familiar with those talks, however, 
said that the teams include the NBA's Seattle and New Jersey franchises. 
</P>
<P>
"The interest in San Diego is very solid," one top city official said. "If we 
had a new arena to offer today, I think we'd also have a team." 
</P>
<P>
Similar feelers are under way in regard to professional hockey, where the 
National Hockey League's plans to add seven teams by the year 2000 create 
broader opportunities for San Diego than those available in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
Though Cooper has secured the needed investors, San Diego faces strong 
competition within California -- from Anaheim and San Jose -- for a hockey 
franchise. But the planned expansion, combined with feedback from existing 
franchises, leaves Cooper "even more confident" about the prospects of a hockey 
franchise than about basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Both hockey and basketball franchises have expressed a willingness to play 
several seasons in the existing Sports Arena pending completion of the new one, 
Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary financial projections compiled by Cooper's consultants show that a 
new arena could survive economically until 1997 with either a basketball or 
hockey franchise. Both, however, probably are necessary for the arena's 
long-range economic viability. 
</P>
<P>
And, just as he is convinced that his new arena will be built, Cooper has 
similar faith that both franchises will be in place when it opens. 
</P>
<P>
"Teams playing in old 14,000-seat arenas just love the idea of playing in a new 
22,900-seat arena in San Diego," Cooper said. "To a large extent, the Palace 
will sell itself. It won't be as hard to fill it as it is to build it." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper paused, then, chuckling wryly, added: "At least I hope not."

You and I think of sewage-treatment plants and we think of large, unsightly 
tanks where a very smelly brew is stirred and sifted. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Frauenfelder, a San Diego deputy city manager, thinks of sewage-treatment 
plants and he envisions greenbelts, lush landscaping and recreational 
facilities. He dreams of a plant in Laguna Niguel that resembles a horse ranch. 
</P>
<P>
It is good he is able to keep such soothing images in mind. 
</P>
<P>
It has fallen to Frauenfelder to persuade property owners in Poway, North City, 
Santee, Mission Valley, Otay River Valley and South Bay that treatment plants 
proposed for their communities can be "good neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
If you think a condo project raises hackles, try a sewage plant. 
</P>
<P>
As a way to win hearts and minds, Frauenfelder has authored one of the most 
relentlessly upbeat municipal reports ever issued: "Architectural Concepts for 
Aesthetically Pleasing Treatment Plants." 
</P>
<P>
Sample: "In addition to designing the visual appearance of the plant to fit 
adjacent land uses, other related aspects of designing to be a good neighbor 
include addressing potential nuisances such as odor, noise, lighting, dust, 
graffiti, litter and traffic." 
</P>
<P>
Frauenfelder sees jogging and walking trails and oodles of greenery kept lovely 
by reclaimed water. The water, however, presents a dilemma of Blue vs. Brown. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people find open water surfaces to to be more aesthetically pleasing than 
covered tanks, when viewed from above. On the other hand, the color of the 
water is generally brown, not blue, and this does not meet people's visual 
expectations." 
</P>
<P>
Frauenfelder will soon take his report to the City Council and the task force 
overseeing the $2.2-billion plan, and then to community meetings in North City, 
Mission Valley and Chula Vista. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not naive enough," he says, "to believe that, when we actually come down 
to picking a certain location, that the people closest to the plant won't have 
objections." 
</P>
<P>
Translation: NIMBY (Not in My Back Yard) is out there and waiting.

"Edison has a policy of: give 'em everything so long as it's not relevant or 
damaging," Shames said. "I ask for summaries of contracts; they give me the 
entire contracts, appendices to the contracts, addenda to the contracts,

Another question: "Should we continue the sound conservative policies of George 
Deukmejian or return to the irresponsible schemes of Jerry Brown?"

EXPERT KNOWS WHAT BUGS RESIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE YASUDA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trapped in jars, entombed in film canisters, stuck to tape, sealed in envelopes 
-- the bugs find their way to county entomologist David Kellum by one means or 
another. 
</P>
<P>
"People will send me an insect after they've taken a good whack at it," Kellum 
says. "I can't do much with a squashed bug." 
</P>
<P>
Every day, San Diego County residents send insects to Kellum and ask him to 
identify the strange critters they have found creeping up their walls or 
buzzing in their gardens. They want to know if it's poisonous, if it will hurt 
their dog, or why it's devouring their tomato patch. Sometimes it takes a 
while, but Kellum responds to each request. He identifies about 400 insects a 
month, sometimes as many as 600. 
</P>
<P>
The numerous identification requests often confine him to his lab -- a space 
cluttered with jars and test tubes filled with specimens such as the red 
imported fire ant, the banded garden spider and the Africanized honeybee. 
</P>
<P>
But when it comes to insects, spending long hours at the microscope isn't 
really a chore, Kellum says. 
</P>
<P>
He owes a lot to insects, the 41-year-old entomologist says. In addition to 
providing him with a livelihood, insects taught him how to walk. As an infant, 
Kellum says, he once crawled into a stream of biting ants. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother says that got me up and going," he says. 
</P>
<P>
As a young boy growing up in Alabama, Kellum recalls spending lazy afternoons 
chasing the multi-colored lubber grasshopper. 
</P>
<P>
"They were beautiful . . . green and yellow and red," says Kellum of his 
childhood fascination. "They looked like little toys." 
</P>
<P>
Quelling entomological fears is just one responsibility of the bug man of San 
Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Foremost, Kellum responds to the needs of the region's farmers and growers, 
helping them get rid of pests that could destroy crops and ravage fields. He is 
one of the county's leading advocates for biological control -- employing "good 
bugs" instead of pesticides to kill pests. 
</P>
<P>
He also serves as a state inspector when he makes rounds at Lindbergh Field to 
make sure that imported agricultural goods are pest-free. 
</P>
<P>
These days, Kellum is busy preparing the county's policy on how to deal with 
the much-publicized arrival of the Africanized honeybee, commonly known as the 
"killer bee." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Africanized honeybee, which is migrating northward to the 
U.S.-Mexico border, is easily agitated, its sting is no worse than that of a 
typical bee, Kellum says. But the Africanized honeybee's tendency to pursue 
prey over longer distances and to strike in hordes has earned the insect its 
nickname. 
</P>
<P>
While their threat to humans is limited, experts believe that the bee may 
endanger livestock and fear that, through mating, it will eventually take over 
domestic bees' hives. That concerns beekeepers because, although the 
Africanized honeybee produces about the same amount of honey as its domestic 
counterpart, it consumes more of the honey. 
</P>
<P>
Dealing with these potential problems is a major concern for Kellum, as is the 
need to create a public awareness campaign on the so-called killer bee. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had people call and say they're allergic to bee stings and want to know 
whether they should move from San Diego (to avoid the Africanized honeybee)" 
Kellum says. He receives several calls a week from residents worried about 
their safety and their loved ones, including pets. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Africanized honeybee is not expected to arrive in San Diego County 
until the mid-1990s, Kellum says he receives frequent calls from residents who 
swear they have spotted the insect. 
</P>
<P>
" 'I saw this humongous bee kill and eat another bee! It's the killer bee!' -- 
I've heard that from time to time," Kellum says. 
</P>
<P>
He soothes callers with the information that the bug they see is not a killer 
bee, but a "bee killer" that preys on honeybees. The Africanized honeybee is 
smaller than both the honeybee and the bumblebee, and, because it looks so much 
like its domestic counterpart, can be identified only by experts. 
</P>
<P>
But, by now, Kellum says he is accustomed to problems that arise from mistaken 
identities. 
</P>
<P>
About a year ago, Kellum received a call from one of the county jails, where 
inmates had told deputies that the facility was infested with the poisonous 
brown recluse spider. Indeed, one inmate was bitten by an insect, assumed to be 
the deadly spider, and became ill. The inmates panicked until Kellum examined 
the spider. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't poisonous," Kellum says. "It turned out to be just a cockroach 
predator. The spiders were just feeding on the cockroaches. There's a lot of 
them in the jail, you know." 
</P>
<P>
As the jail trip demonstrates, Kellum serves clients other than farmers and 
growers. Occasionally, he even makes house calls. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, Kellum received a phone call from a distraught elderly woman who 
complained that her house was infested with tiny insects that "were practically 
invisible." 
</P>
<P>
"She said that she had put up a screen on her door but that they were still 
getting in," Kellum said. "She said she called the exterminators, but they told 
her that they couldn't find anything." According to Kellum, the exterminators 
speculated that the house contained "no-see-ums," gnats that are difficult to 
see. 
</P>
<P>
"Well that didn't make her feel any better," Kellum said. "She pleaded that I 
come out to her house. She seemed like a nice old lady, so I went." 
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival, the woman showed Kellum her glasses, which were speckled with 
white dots -- proof of the insects' presence. 
</P>
<P>
The dots, however, weren't bugs, and after a bit of sleuthing, Kellum 
discovered the source: pollen from a nearby palm tree. 
</P>
<P>
"All in a day's work," said Kellum as he pushed back his chair to the 
microscope and picked up a jar with a note attached to it: "I've never seen 
anything like this before. Can you tell me what it is?"

DRIVE-BY SHOOTING HOSPITALIZES TEEN-AGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A teen-age boy was wounded Sunday in a drive-by shooting in North Hollywood, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the boy was walking in the 7200 block of Tujunga Avenue near 
Sherman Way about 5:30 p.m. when he was hit by shots fired from a passing car, 
Sgt. Christopher Vasquez said. Detectives were uncertain as to whether the 
shooting was gang related, Vasquez said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, who was not identified by police, was taken to Holy Cross Medical 
Center in Mission Hills. He was undergoing surgery late Sunday, a hospital 
spokeswoman said. The extent of his injuries was not immediately known, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
No arrests had been made, Vasquez said.

DISTURBANCE ERUPTS IN CHULA VISTA JAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A disturbance was reported at the San Diego County Jail in Chula Vista about 9 
p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Four patients were taken to Scripps Memorial Hospital in Chula Vista with minor 
injuries, said paramedic spokesman Tim Robinson of Hartson Medical Services. 
</P>
<P>
Details from the Sheriff's Department were sketchy, but a sheriff's spokesman 
said the disturbance occurred in Module 4B. The module was locked down, and 
inmates were confined to their cells by 9:23 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
A laundry-room fire was also reported Sunday at the County Jail in El Cajon. 
The fire was extinguished, and no injuries were reported.

I couldn't help noticing the irony of the photo you printed with the article 
"Getting a Grip on Graffiti" (Metro, Jan. 25). It showed a billboard with the 
message "HELP US CRUSH GRAFFITI" as backdrop for student volunteers in their 
effort to erase graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
By size and quantity billboards create more visual clutter than graffiti (not 
to mention the 10 top billboard advertisers are either tobacco or liquor). 
</P>
<P>
If cities really want to take care of their visual environment they should deal 
with billboards first. In recent years many enlightened cities across the 
country have done just that by banning the erection of more of this worst form 
of visual pollution. These include Santa Monica, West Hollywood, Tucson, 
Phoenix, Fort Worth, Little Rock, Charleston, Virginia Beach, Jacksonville, 
etc. Here in California, Beverly Hills, Santa Barbara and Palm Springs are 
among the many cities that never did allow billboards.

COLISEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We were shocked to read in Kenneth Reich's article ("Coliseum Rebuilding Plan 
Hits Snag," Metro, Jan. 26) that the private managers of the Coliseum would 
attempt an end run around existing state laws to allow them to hastily bulldoze 
the historic Coliseum. Everyone knows that it is unsportsmanlike conduct to 
change the rules in the middle of the game. 
</P>
<P>
The proponents of destruction must be afraid of public scrutiny. Or, perhaps 
they are afraid that an objective analysis will demonstrate that, for a 
fraction of the cost of building a new stadium, the existing structure can be 
reconfigured and adaptively used to achieve their specific goals. 
</P>
<P>
State law requires the preparation of a full environmental impact report before 
the Coliseum Commission can legally demolish (or allow others to demolish) the 
Coliseum. The purpose of this law is simply to provide an objective analysis of 
the alternatives and to provide the public the opportunity to review and 
comment on the proposal and alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
If a gravel pit in Irwindale deserves the due process of state environmental 
laws, certainly the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, a national historic 
landmark, is worthy of no less!

TURMOIL IN AZERBAIJAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We were rather surprised by the glaringly biased reporting of the events in 
Azerbaijan and Armenia by The Times. Most of what we read painted a picture of 
innocent Christian Armenians of Azerbaijan being expelled from that state by 
Muslim Azeris mostly because of their religious differences. Truth behind the 
Armenian-Azeri struggle, however, cannot be reached by such a simplistic 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
First, we should answer the question "how did these events start?" As the 
Moscow government declared a few months ago, the Armenian-Azeri conflict 
started when Armenian nationalists asked for the annexation of Azerbaijan's 
Karabakh region into Armenia. Anybody with a map of the region in question can 
see that what Armenians were asking for was a piece of land right in the middle 
of Azerbaijan. 
</P>
<P>
Armenians' justification for annexation was that they were the majority in 
Karabakh. They, however, conveniently were forgetting that Karabakh has never 
been ruled by Armenians in its history and Armenians were sent there as 
immigrants by the Russians to increase the Christian population of this 
Muslim-dominated area. As a result of actions of the Armenian nationalists, the 
Armenian majority of Karabakh and Armenia started attacking the Azeri minority 
in mid-1988. It should be recognized that the first victim of this conflict was 
an Azeri and that close to 160,000 Azeris were forced to flee Karabakh and 
Armenia to escape attacks by Armenian nationalists. 
</P>
<P>
What we see today in Azerbaijan is a response to the events that took place in 
Armenia and Karabakh. It is sad that both Armenian and Azeri lives were lost in 
this conflict. 
</P>
<P>
All of the Soviet Republics had demands from the national government under the 
open policies of President Mikhail Gorbachev but no nation except Armenia 
demanded additional land from a neighboring republic. This is not a religious 
war as Armenians would like the American public to believe. This is a war for 
land and Armenians started it.

SAVING HISTORIC LEONIS ADOBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I would like to clarify some of the statements made in Al Martinez's column "An 
Itch in Old Calabasas" (Jan. 16) regarding the historic Leonis Adobe and 
Caltrans' proposal for the Valley Circle Boulevard interchange with the Ventura 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
None of the historic Leonis Adobe property is in any way threatened by 
Caltrans' proposal. 
</P>
<P>
No property will be taken from either the National Register property (which 
contains the Adobe, barn and other structures) or from the adjacent Leonis 
Adobe Assn. property. 
</P>
<P>
The present right-of-way line that runs between the Ventura Freeway and a 
portion of the Leonis Adobe Assn.'s property (containing the corral, the adobe 
area, and part of a nearby restaurant's parking lot) will be maintained. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed project would require approximately 0.5 acres of property held by 
the Leonis Adobe Assn. Most of the property in question is located between 
Calabasas Creek and the Valley Circle Boulevard/Mulholland Drive intersection. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans is working closely with the Leonis Adobe Assn. on plans to construct a 
sound wall along the present right-of-way line to reduce the level of freeway 
noise in and around the adobe structure. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans is also working on plans to enhance the area with new landscaping and 
to relocate and replant some of the existing oak trees located on the property.

IDEA WHOSE TIME HAS COME -- BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Having shown its hand near the cookie jar of military base closings, the White 
House has a problem. It can either drop the whole idea or it can join Congress 
in reviving an approach that closed 86 assorted forts, camps and bases in 1988 
with barely a whimper. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration proposal to close 43 military installations and scale 
back others may have been made in all innocence, but it's hopeless to argue 
that to House Democrats. More than 90% of uniformed and civilian personnel who 
would be moved or mustered out live in Democratic districts. Arguing that the 
plan is not politically motivated because it would also embarrass important 
Republican senators just makes Democrats put their hands over their ears. 
</P>
<P>
Until 1988, Congress had for 10 years refused to close a single military base, 
fearing that voters would punish any member who let a base and its payroll get 
away, no matter how little it contributed to national security. Nor was all of 
the politics defensive. The Pentagon was not above using a threat of base 
closings to persuade members to vote for bigger defense budgets. Then Congress 
hit upon the idea of a bipartisan commission that could close bases and leave 
Congress blameless for the decisions. It worked. 
</P>
<P>
But now Congress seems to be right back where it was before 1988. With a 
crumbling threat of war in Europe and the opportunity to get rid of bases and 
forces that are no longer needed, the timing could not be worse. Congress 
created the commission in 1988 and the defense secretary appointed its members. 
The commission compiled a list of surplus installations that was not 
negotiable. Congress either accepted the list or rejected it. That meant that 
members could go home after a base closed and argue that they had done their 
best but other members of Congress would not listen to reason. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly this is an idea whose time has come -- back.

SOVIET JEWS: HAUNTED BY THE MEMORY OF POGROMS PAST AND FACING RENEWED 
ANTI-SEMITISM, THEY NEED WESTERN HELP TO GET TO ISRAEL WHILE THE RIGHT TO 
EMIGRATE IS STILL THAT.

Long before the rise of Hitler, anti-Semitism was alive and well in Eastern 
Europe. Whenever social or political or economic crises occurred anywhere in 
the region -- including Russia -- storms of anti-Semitism erupted replete with 
pogroms and suffering for the Jews. 
</P>
<P>
We may again be entering such a period. As the Soviet Union slips into anarchy, 
chaos and severe economic hardships, glasnost has allowed the anti-Semites to 
come out of the closet. Responding to deep emotional nationalistic feelings, 
they blame the Jews for the country's growing problems. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union's Jewish residents are close to panic. Even people who barely 
identified as Jews are suddenly clamoring to escape to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
The relatively free right to emigrate now exists. The problem is that the 
conveyances for bringing Jews to Israel is inadequate. Every available flight 
is currently booked through mid-September. Emigrants have taken to driving 
their cars to Budapest, where they abandon their vehicles and board flights to 
Tel Aviv. 
</P>
<P>
Given the political turmoil in Eastern Europe, no one can know how long the 
gates will remain open. There are many ways they could be closed. The 
Palestinians and Arab governments are urging the Kremlin to stop immigration to 
Israel, just as they pressured the British in the late 1930s to restrict 
immigration into Palestine. The rising tide of nationalism inside the Soviet 
Union could yield a new government disinclined to allow emigration, or 
conservatives could force Mikhail Gorbachev to change his policies. The recent 
bloodshed in Baku is a dark harbinger of the potential oppression that could 
befall many Soviet Jews if the situation inside the Soviet Union worsens. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, American Jews also seem strangely caught in a 1930s-time warp. Since 
the end of World War II, many have vowed never again to remain quiet when a 
community of Jews is threatened. Yet when history again calls upon American 
Jews to work to save their suffering cousins, people are strangely silent. The 
intifada in the Israeli-occupied territories, an uninspired Israeli leadership, 
the past struggles for Soviet Jews, fascination with the democratic revolutions 
in Eastern Europe, inability to assimilate the unbelievably quick pace of world 
events -- all these factors have combined to create an unnerving fatigue and 
cynicism that has swept through the American Jewish community and made it 
unresponsive to the cries of many leaders and organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Israel must prepare for an influx of Soviet Jews. A sense of excitement and 
challenge is sweeping the country. In turn, some Israelis have tried to link 
the plight of Soviet Jews with territorial claims on the West Bank. History 
will treat harshly any Israeli leader who endangers, through the use of 
grandiose and threatening rhetoric, the ability of Soviet Jews to flee to 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
Let us be frank, however. A minuscule number of incoming Soviet Jews now seek 
to live in the West Bank -- at the most 1% to 2%. This tiny number will have no 
impact on Arab or Israeli claims in a settlement process. 
</P>
<P>
The vehemence of the Arab outcry against Soviet Jewish immigrants, even into 
pre-1967 Israel, raises the most ominous questions concerning whether the Arabs 
oppose military occupation of the West Bank or the Jewish presence in the 
region completely -- hence Israel's right to exist. 
</P>
<P>
For Americans, there is a clear path of action that we must take: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Keep the pressure on Moscow to make sure that those Jews who wish to leave 
can, and that direct air links to Israel be expanded. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Keep the pressure on Israel to make sure that Soviet Jews being absorbed 
are not directed to the occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Communicate to Arab governments and Palestinian representatives that we 
oppose settlement in the occupied territories, but we strongly support the 
immigration of Soviet Jews into Israel and view the current Arab campaign 
against them as threatening to the integrity of efforts to shape an effective 
peace process. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Increase public and private assistance to Israel as it engages in the 
gargantuan task of absorbing the refugees. 
</P>
<P>
Concerted action now could avert potential disaster tomorrow. Do we have the 
wisdom and the courage to act more skillfully today than our predecessors 
behaved over five decades ago? So far, the portents have not been encouraging. 
Never again? Wanna bet?

THESE 'HIGHWAYS' ARE WIDE, UNDERUSED; 
</P>
<P>
COMMUNICATIONS:VAST ELECTRONIC NETWORKS ARE IN PLACE AND WORKING. BUT 
DATA-HANDLING TECHNIQUES LAG. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ignore the creaking of America's Rust Belt, the thud of her frost-bitten 
Florida oranges, the din of stalled freeway traffic. Don't despair over our 
crumbling infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
There is a hidden infrastructure that is building steadily: our public and 
private telephone networks. 
</P>
<P>
The giant AT&amp;T is a vast, growing resource ready to add to our nation's 
wealth. And its smaller rivals, mainly MCI and US Sprint, have developed 
electronic long-distance communications routes that parallel AT&amp;T's 
"highways" in much of the country. 
</P>
<P>
When AT&amp;T went on the fritz one day last month, calls could have been 
handled by the other carriers if a transfer mechanism had been in place. 
</P>
<P>
It has been estimated that today's long-distance line capacity is four times 
that of eight years ago. Another way to view this hidden infrastructure: 
AT&amp;T, with about 70% of interstate long-distance revenues, controls only 
about 40% of the nation's long-distance capacity. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike companies that simply buy circuits in bulk from AT&amp;T and resell them 
MCI, Sprint and others are building their own facilities. They are creating 16- 
and 32-lane communications "highways" where only four existed before. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of miles of private networks are also being created, such as those 
owned by Boeing and Westinghouse. And there are networks that duplicate those 
of local phone companies. These networks expedite data from private firms or 
access long-distance companies cheaply. 
</P>
<P>
In short, we have the capacity to transmit communications many times over what 
we use. This huge, under-utilized system can carry voice, data and fax 
transmissions -- in fact, anything but regular television pictures -- from 
anywhere to anywhere. Most important, it may provide a workable fuse to ignite 
the much anticipated information revolution in computing and communications. 
</P>
<P>
The gunpowder has been in place for awhile. That is, of course, the computer 
power behind information processing. Take microchips. Today the most 
sophisticated chips have 2 million electronic components. By the year 2000, 
they're expected to have 1 billion, 500 times the power at the same cost. 
</P>
<P>
But the communications end of the process -- moving data around quickly -- is 
the holdup. Like a donkey transporting uranium, communications developments 
have not kept pace with computing. 
</P>
<P>
As consumers, we experience this when we have to wait longer than we care to 
for bank-card machines to respond. The computation takes only a fraction of the 
time spent on the transaction. The time thief is the messenger, not the 
message. 
</P>
<P>
Multiply the small delays by the billions of information transactions made 
daily, and it's even more evident that we need to have communications networks 
move faster. That is the policy challenge of our communications network: Can 
our under-used capacity bring the transmission end of information processing up 
to our ever-accelerating computing capacity? 
</P>
<P>
At the very least, the networks, which are now under-used, should be encouraged 
to carry more traffic. How? Lower long-distance rates will encourage more 
long-distance calling. This is already being done to some degree. Since 1987, 
AT&amp;T's rates have declined nearly 30%, and MCI and Sprint have kept pace. 
Americans are making more toll calls than ever because of lower rates. 
</P>
<P>
We need to look at communications as an alternative to transportation. For 
example, an upsurge in the use of computer modems, which allow computers to 
talk to each other over phone lines, could reduce the need to transport 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
Even the ubiquitous fax machine can be replaced with data signals from a 
computer. Need a hard copy? Send the data, in seconds, then print it out on 
your machine instead of tying up the phone line with a fax transmission. 
</P>
<P>
We can encourage "telecommuting," in which employees work at home using a 
computer connected to the office. There is a turn-of-the-century irony in 
seeing a worker stalled in rush-hour traffic while unused cable that could make 
the trip unnecessary sits under clogged roads. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, and most difficult, we must find a way to make our under-used national 
communications resource and our computer power work together. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps harvesting all the benefits of our communications infrastructure is too 
big a job. Like desalinizing ocean water, it's a good idea that may prove too 
difficult to realize. But unlike sea water, man created communications 
networks. We ought to be able to find a way to direct them to their most 
productive ends.

AZTECS' VOLLEYBALL VICTORY A TOP 10 HIT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They're going to have to drop ASICS out of this thing and just refer to it as 
the WIVA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
All four teams that advanced to the semifinals of the ASICS Grand Prix 
volleyball tournament, after all, were Western Intercollegiate Volleyball Assn. 
teams: San Diego State, Hawaii, Long Beach State and UC Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Of those four, only San Diego State is not ranked in the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
Not now, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs may move up from their current ranking of 12th after their showing 
in the ASICS. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU not only made it to the championship game, but once there pulled off a 
10-15, 15-8, 15-11, 16-14 victory over No. 4 Long Beach State. It was the first 
time in the last nine matches between the two teams that the SDSU came out on 
top. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't easy. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs held the lead in the fourth game from the very beginning -- until, 
that is, Long Beach tied it at 10-10. But with the Aztecs still up, 9-7, a 
controversial officiating call seemed to deflate the Aztecs. One referee 
over-ruled another after the point had already been awarded to the Aztecs. 
</P>
<P>
On the play, Aztec Sean Clark spiked a ball over the end line, but the corner 
official ruled that the ball had been touched by Long Beach's Robert Kutsch, 
who went up at the net in an attempt to block the ball. 
</P>
<P>
The side official, however, overturned that ruling after Long Beach players 
voiced their complaints. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of putting the Aztecs up, 10-7, the 49ers had the ball -- and the 
momentum. They scored five of the next six points to forge a 12-10 lead. 
</P>
<P>
But the 49ers could not sustain the drive and the Aztecs came back to take six 
of the last eight points. 
</P>
<P>
The third game saw the lead change five times before the Aztecs scored the last 
five points of the game. Two key points in the run came via service aces, one 
by Tagore Evans -- the tournament's most valuable player -- and Douglas Potter. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs' kills were beginning to find the floor in the second game. One 
reason, why, perhaps, was that Mark Kerins, the 49ers' 6-foot-4 outside hitter 
whom many consider the top player in the WIVA, had to leave the match. 
</P>
<P>
Kerins only played in two tournament matches before the championship. It was 
the first action he had seen in two months because of a stress fracture in his 
left leg. 
</P>
<P>
In the match's first game, the 49ers jumped out to a 8-0 lead as the Aztecs had 
trouble getting their kills past Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Two consecutive service aces by Mike Mattarocci made it 8-2, and after that the 
49ers let the Aztecs back into the match by committing 5 service errors. 
</P>
<P>
That Long Beach State made it to the finals was somewhat of a surprise. The 
49ers had to beat No. 3 Hawaii, which was favored to win its second ASICS 
championship, in the semifinals, 16-14, 15-12, 2-15, 7-15, 15-9, in the women's 
gym at SDSU. 
</P>
<P>
A mild upset, to be sure, but nothing compared to what was going on 
concurrently at Peterson Gym in the other semifinal. There the Aztecs were busy 
working on their second victory over a top-10 team in the tournament. This time 
the victim was No. 8 Santa Barbara (the Aztecs had previously beaten No. 6 Ball 
State). 
</P>
<P>
It took five games, but the Aztecs prevailed, 15-8, 15-9, 4-15, 5-15, 15-13, 
despite making things difficult for themselves in games three and four when 
Coach Jack Henn decided to rest some regulars and see what a couple bench 
players could do. 
</P>
<P>
The substitutions ruined the Aztecs' chemistry and put USCSB back into the 
match. 
</P>
<P>
"We fell apart," said Douglas Moreland, who finished with a match-high 29 kills 
and a .491 hitting percentage. "That's exactly it." 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs also seemed to have a psychological block. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't been put in that situation (up 2-0) much," Henn said. "And we just 
waited for the other team to lose instead of going out to win."

JACK SMITH: AN IMPERIAL TRIP THROUGH A LITTLE-NOTICED COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Imperial County, which occupies the southeast corner of the state, is boxed in 
by Riverside County on the north, San Diego County on the west, Arizona on the 
east, and Baja California on the south. 
</P>
<P>
If we think of it at all in Los Angeles we aren't sure where it is, except that 
it's north of Mexicali, the Mexican border town east of Tijuana, that it grows 
vegetables, and that it's hot. Actually, that is a pretty accurate description 
of it, though not complete. 
</P>
<P>
Strangely, when we think of Southern California we think only of Santa Barbara, 
Ventura, Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino and San Diego counties. Imperial 
County is somewhere else. Part of Arizona, maybe. 
</P>
<P>
The other day my wife and I drove down to Brawley, in Imperial Valley, where I 
was to talk before the Friends of the Library. We had never been in Imperial 
County before, except when we crossed the border from Mexico at Mexicali and 
drove through Calexico on the way to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
It is a four-hour drive. You go east on the San Bernardino Freeway to Indio, 
then take California 86 south to Brawley, passing through miles of desert, date 
palms and golf courses. Then the Salton Sea comes into view on the east; it is 
light blue under the cloudless sky, an extraordinary body of saltwater, 235 
feet below sea level, 312 miles in area, with 95 miles of shoreline. It was 
formed in 1905 when the Colorado River overflowed its dikes and spilled into 
the Salton Basin. Nearby lies the Imperial Wildlife Area, a winter sanctuary 
for thousands of migratory birds. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the sea rose the lovely desert mountains to the east -- beautifully 
sculptured in pink, beige, gray and lavender. They should have been named the 
Pastel Mountains. We came to a town called Westmorland. If the only traffic 
signal hadn't turned red on us we could have passed through it in one minute 
flat. 
</P>
<P>
In Brawley we had been instructed by letter to go to the home of Abe and Helen 
Seabolt. She said we turned right at the first signal and it was the third 
house. So it was. 
</P>
<P>
She gave us a tour of the library. Like many California libraries, it showed 
the effects of financial starvation. It was too old, too small and too limited 
in its resources. But like most small libraries in the state, it was making a 
gallant effort to serve its community. 
</P>
<P>
I was to speak at a fund-raiser. With $190,000 from the state, and a matching 
sum from the City Council, the library will be enlarged and brought up-to-date. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike cities in the other five counties near Los Angeles, Brawley has not been 
affected by the explosive migration of Los Angeles residents to more rural 
areas. No vast tracts of new houses are swallowing its farmlands. But it has 
another problem. For years, winter visitors they call "Snowbirds" flock into 
the valley from colder climes, park their trailers and live from fall to 
spring, taxing the city's facilities but paying only sales taxes. There are 
14,000 of them, not included in Brawley's population of about 20,000. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of them live in "Slab City." It is a former military base, dismantled 
and abandoned except for the concrete slabs on which its structures rested. The 
Snowbirds roll in, park their trailers on the slabs and become instant citizens 
for the winter. How they survive without the basic facilities is a tribute to 
human ingenuity and fortitude. 
</P>
<P>
After the Friends of the Library meeting in the Senior Center we were guests 
for a dinner of pollo asada at the commodious home of Gene and Hetty Jordan. 
Jordan is an implement dealer and farmland owner. The other guests were also 
locals -- bright, engaging, and very much into politics at every level. They 
seemed to regard the Snowbirds with amiable resignation. At the moment, they 
were annoyed by a new federal ruling under which they receive prime-time 
commercial TV network shows two hours early, including news. 
</P>
<P>
We left Brawley loaded with gifts of farm-fresh asparagus, cauliflower, 
Brussels sprouts, onions, carrots, lettuce and spinach -- everything I love -- 
and drove back to San Diego over Interstate 8, a 65-m.p.h.-freeway through low 
desert mountains that are piles of huge, erosion-rounded boulders -- pyramids 
older than Egypt's. 
</P>
<P>
I've been a vegetarian for a week.

Sighting Dollars: "What do you call people who make money off a dead man?" 
asked columnist Elaine Viets caustically in the St. Louis, Mo., Post-Dispatch 
Saturday. Smart, she said. The writer came across a Sherman Oaks company with a 
900 number that's supposed to be a network for Elvis Presley sightings. Viets 
listened to the line for a couple of days. It offered a tape of Elvis songs, 
taped comments from callers with messages for Elvis -- but no sightings. Viets 
tried to reach the company itself, and even they could not be sighted: "all I 
got was their answering service. . . . So what did I get for my $6 call? A 
chance to listen to ads and buy more Elvis things."

A TALE OF MISPERCEPTION, MARRIAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLYN SEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
King of the World by Merrill Joan Gerber (Pushcart Press: $18.95; 279 pages.) 
</P>
<P>
Much is made of the fact that men perceive women as objects, but the opposite 
truth is that women often perceive men as objects as well, to everyone's mutual 
detriment. "King of the World" springs from the consequences of an initial 
misperception that holds all of the characters of this story in ongoing 
bondage. This is the tale of Ginny and Michael, their romance, their marriage, 
their tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
Ginny thinks of herself as unlovely. She has a crooked back -- not bad enough 
to be operated on, but bad enough to make her feel sad, unattractive. She falls 
in love with a man named Michael who looks gorgeous. His body is terrific, his 
eyes shine. He makes love like an angel (or devil) and he crowns Ginny "Queen 
of the World" -- with a broken starfish, at twilight, on a Mexico beach. 
</P>
<P>
Michael is impetuous, moody. Not to put too fine a point on it, he's crazy, 
certifiably nuts. Ginny knows this from the very beginning of their 
relationship because in Chapter 1, Michael performs an unspeakable act, a 
hideous deed. So, the point is made, Ginny knows, at some level, what she's 
getting into when she takes up with this self-styled king of the world. And no, 
this is not a Hedda Nussbaum wife-beating expose, but something far more 
subtle. Michael may be crazy, but he does love his wife. Ginny may know he's 
crazy, but she has to weigh that in the balance of a certain kind of glamour, 
the wild imagination she herself will never have, and incredible nights of 
lovemaking that are the only moments of magic in her otherwise gray and dreary 
life. 
</P>
<P>
Flash forward 15 years. Ginny and Michael are married. Ginny wants to adopt a 
baby. Her back treatments have made her sterile and she's clued in enough to 
reality by now to reflect that "maybe she was lucky her ovaries were dead as 
dry fruit pits, then she would never have to worry about her bone problems 
being passed on to a baby, or about Michael's spinning eyeballs turning up one 
day in her baby's face." In spite of the fact that Michael can't hold a job, 
they do manage to adopt Adam, a sweet little boy, and Michael's crazy mother 
comes to live with them. 
</P>
<P>
For the first significant time in 15 years, Ginny is able to have flashes of 
not-love toward her husband. With her baby to love she can look at the 
ever-crazier King of the World and think, "Who needs you?" But . . . stop and 
think about the story so far. This is not about just one couple in an untenable 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
This novel addresses itself to the whole question of so-called battered wives 
and to their husbands. It's easy; it's a reflex action to say, or think, about 
battered wives: Why don't they just leave? In just that same way the 
flat-footed rhetorical question about the homeless comes up: Why don't they 
just get a job? But for every battered wife, there was once a romance and a 
marriage and a lot of moments filled with passion and pity and compassion and 
shared history. People tend to get married because they love each other and 
that love -- like uranium -- has a long half-life. It doesn't just go away. 
Even when the brain decides on a rational course of action, it sometimes takes 
the body and the soul a while to catch up. 
</P>
<P>
And so, in this novel, Michael becomes crazier and crazier. Very unwillingly, 
Ginny decides to seek help, and learns a way to make a decent living. Even 
then, and even when her husband commits another unspeakable act, she finds it 
almost impossible to leave. But this is not about a monster pursuing a victim. 
</P>
<P>
What makes "King of the World" so engrossing is that a good many of the 
chapters are told from Michael's point of view. All Michael wants is to succeed 
amazingly, so that his wife, his mother, his child, the rest of the world, will 
give him the recognition and adulation that he considers to be his just due. 
It's not fair, Michael thinks. He looks like a king, he acts like a king, he 
should be treated like a king. The world, it turns out, is crueler to him than 
to his long-suffering wife. This novel attempts to get below the journalistic 
surface of a very bad social problem, and succeeds, memorably.

POP CAPSULES : SPLENDID RACKET FROM ART-BANGERS GUTBUCKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's something in a young artist that likes banging on things, preferably on 
stage with a large group of friends, and there's a long tradition of neo-tribal 
post-art-school percuss-O-rama in Los Angeles. Gutbucket, the newest 
art-bangers, put a hip-hop twist on the genre at LACE on Friday, occasionally 
sounding more like a Public Enemy backing track than like the more traditional 
Gary Glitter-meets-"Ummagumma" treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Above the splendid racket of a half-dozen guys pounding congas, oil drums, 
trap-sets and whatever, trumpeter Michael Whitmore blew the kind of breathy, 
dour solos that Ornette Coleman plays when he picks up a trumpet, and a fellow 
named Chrono muttered Beat-ish groove rhymes. Local painter Anthony Ausgang 
scratched along on turntables, Jeff Kaufman pinned down the meandering beats 
with coherently funky bass riffs and leader Vinzula Kara wailed stylishly on 
melodica. 
</P>
<P>
At times the jams got repetitive, and this sort of thing is invariably more fun 
to play in than to listen to. Still, with blurry slides flashing past in the 
background and a wandering video cameraman seemingly as much a part of the band 
as the percussionist, Gutbucket was a low-budget, total-media assault. JONATHAN

Barr's Love Letters at Large: Love letters written by actress Roseanne Barr to 
Tom Arnold, her newlywed husband, have been stolen and are being offered for 
sale to various periodicals. 
</P>
<P>
Barr's publicist Alana Rothstein announced the theft Friday. "Our purpose in 
sending the (announcement) out is to notify people that these letters are 
stolen," Rothstein said. "We're saying, 'yes it is for real, and yes they are 
stolen, and if somebody decides to publish them, then down the road they'll 
have to deal with the repercussions.' " Barr's public relations firm had 
received inquiries from several publishers who had been contacted by someone 
who was offering to sell the letters. BETH KLEID

Quiet, Please!: It's a conductor's nightmare: The orchestra is in the middle of 
a moving passage when suddenly, a member of the audience lets out a hacking 
cough. 
</P>
<P>
According to conductors at 21 orchestras surveyed by the Warner-Lambert Co. 
about noisy disturbances during performances, it happens too often. Nineteen of 
the 23 conductors who answered the survey said they have been distracted by 
audience noises while conducting. Coughers are the worst, they said. Talking 
and yammering youngsters were problems No. 2 and 3 on the most distracting 
sounds listed in the survey completed last week. BETH KLEID

Rocky Fans Line Up in Philly: The thousands queued up outside the Philadelphia 
Civic Center last Thursday were waiting for tickets to a big fight. Not for 
Tyson, but for Rocky. 
</P>
<P>
Fans slept outside the center hoping to get a ticket to the fight scene in 
"Rocky V." Within about an hour, people had grabbed up 16,000 of the 20,000 
tickets for two days of filming in Sylvester Stallone's latest installment of 
the Rocky Balboa saga. For each day of filming, Thursday and Friday, an 
audience of 10,000 is needed. Dave Fulton, the film's publicist, has refused to 
say who would fight in the movie's final scene. The movie is scheduled for 
release in November by United Artists Pictures Inc. BETH KLEID

Jason, Freddy May Help Violent Teens: Teen-agers who exhibit violent behavior 
are being treated with more violence -- albeit televised violence -- in the 
office of Dr. Jeffrey M. Turley, a child psychiatrist and fellow at the 
University of Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
To keep his unruly clients in line, Turley relies on Jason, the warped 
goaltender of "Halloween," and Freddy Krueger of "Nightmare on Elm Street." The 
psychiatrist found the so-called slasher films helped a 14-year-old boy, who 
axed the interior of his family's home, deal with his feelings of anger. But 
Dr. Carole I. Lieberman, a psychiatrist for the National Coalition on 
Television Violence, says she has misgivings about this treatment because she 
believes "these kinds of movies stimulate aggression." BETH KLEID

POP CAPSULES : MINISTRY AT HOLLYWOOD PALLADIUM: DON'T FENCE US IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The metal-grate fencing that went up around the stage just before Ministry's 
set Friday at the Hollywood Palladium put one in mind of the chicken wire 
famous for protecting bar bands down in the South. Except, if anything, this 
fence wasn't erected to protect the band from patrons throwing bottles on 
stage, but from fans hurling themselves on stage. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, this barricade between performers and audience more likely served 
some unknown symbolic purpose, like a scaled-down version of Pink Floyd's wall. 
Lest bruising contact between singer and crowd be preempted altogether, 
knee-pad-clad frontman Alain Jourgensen did climb over and lob himself into the 
sweaty sea of faces again and again, in visually arresting if not altogether 
convincing acts of atonement. 
</P>
<P>
The two-man Ministry expanded to an octet for live reproduction of its 
percussive punk, speed-metal and industrial noise-type grinding and wheezing -- 
truly exhilarating in double-time, and exasperating when the minimalism slowed 
to a cacophonous crawl. If vocals are already rendered incomprehensible by 
arrogant distortion on record, imagine how much less actual content seemed to 
figure into things at the Palladium. To quote Pink Floyd: Tear down the wall.

EAST GERMANY'S THOMAS VOLLMER IN U. S. DEBUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
East German dancer Thomas Vollmer's U.S. debut in Long Beach Ballet's sprightly 
"Coppelia" lent a splendid comic flair to the proceedings. Seen Saturday 
afternoon at the Terrace Theater, the St. Leon confection (re-created by 
artistic director David Wilcox) featured Helena Ross as Swanilda and Ake 
Pakarinen as her swain. 
</P>
<P>
Ross, an effortless technician with lyrical arms, offered a pliant, musical 
response to the Delibes score, played by the Long Beach Orchestra under Patrick 
Flynn. 
</P>
<P>
Pakarinen, an attentive partner and an amiable Franz so long as he didn't have 
to exert himself unduly, abandoned his character in strained-looking, often 
shapeless solo work. By Act III, even his partnering began to look tired. 
</P>
<P>
Vollmer was busy impersonating eccentric Dr. Coppelius. With his upper body 
pitched forward in a nearsighted haze, Vollmer made the old fool come alive. 
His ludicrous "attack" mode (an impossibly wide splayed-leg stance), his silent 
asides at Franz's seemingly idiotic pursuit of a doll, his gleeful celebration 
of Coppelia's seeming transformation and his deep hurt at seeing the ruse 
revealed were grandly comic moments warmed by a gemutlich view of humankind. A 
few moments of celebratory hijinks in Act III suggested that Vollmer does 
indeed have a bravura side to show as well. 
</P>
<P>
Statuesque Paula Vreulink, who took an unfortunate spill later in Act III, cut 
a figure of generously phrased, legato grace in the Prayer solo. Maricar Drilon 
and Chris Sircello were deft, teasing lovers in the Flirtation Dance and Orna 
Harari delivered a small-scale, terre-a-terre Dawn that rose only 
half-heartedly above the horizon.CATHY CURTIS

KORYU KABUKI PERFORMS AT ROYCE HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the last decade, Grand Kabuki tours of America became almost commonplace -- 
with another due this summer. During the same period, smaller groups such as 
the Koryu Kabuki Dance Company helped heighten our appreciation of this 
classic, interdisciplinary Japanese theater idiom by concentrating on a central 
component: formal movement expression. 
</P>
<P>
At Royce Hall, UCLA, over the weekend, Koryu Kabuki's fine dancers and finer 
musicians presented dance-drama from the Grand Kabuki repertory as well as 
concert-dance in Kabuki style. The Saturday program proved rich in dance-mime: 
choreography rooted in realistic gesture. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, "Ayatsuri Sanbaso" provided a Japanese equivalent of the imitative 
doll-dancing familiar from such European ballets as "Coppelia," "Petrushka" and 
"The Nutcracker." 
</P>
<P>
Worked by invisible strings, and eventually snarled in them, Seizaburo Saruwaka 
superbly suggested the weightless, drifting motion of a marionette, and the way 
he shook bells or flipped sleeves also looked exactly like a puppeteer's clever 
manipulations. 
</P>
<P>
In "Samidare," Sumi Hanayagi created an artful character portrait from 
rainy-day behavior: holding and opening an umbrella, adjusting her clothes and 
hair, wearing or removing wooden clogs. 
</P>
<P>
A depiction of rain also turned up in "Shigure Saigyo," but this time 
abstracted to merely a delicately shimmering fan held overhead by Kichiyu 
Wakayagi. Otherwise this severely formal duet for Wakayagi and Setsuho Azuma 
proved spare in imagery, but powerful in the concentration of the dancers -- 
and dominated by its intense score for a 12-member ensemble (chanters, samisen, 
flute and drums). 
</P>
<P>
Befitting its ascetic theme, "Shigure Saigyo" largely banished the world from 
its movement vocabulary. In contrast, the trio "Genroku Furyu Odori" embraced 
the pleasures of that world with great vivacity, showing us samurai on the town 
with a young maiden -- all dressed in incandescent colors. 
</P>
<P>
Marked by a startling switch in character, costume and scenery, the solo 
"Oharame" depended even more on Mitsujiro Bando's virtuosic ability to play 
both a jolly peasant woman and a forceful footman. The most obvious tour de 
force in an evening of consistent excellence. LEWIS SEGAL

TRUE STORY DEPICTS FAMILY'S WILL TO 'SURVIVE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Anything to Survive" (at 9 tonight on Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42) is a 
physically compelling production about a family's will to live when their boat 
sinks in an Alaskan inlet and they're washed ashore on a forbidding and remote 
island in the dead of winter. 
</P>
<P>
The story, which covers 24 hellish days, is true. The fear of death from pain, 
sub-freezing weather and starvation is relentless, and the indifference of 
nature is implacable. 
</P>
<P>
The teleplay by Jonathan Rintels (based on the book, "Almost Too Late," by Elmo 
Wortman) packs grinding physical despair with credible characterizations. The 
cracking up of the boat at night in horrendous seas is dramatized with jolting 
effect by director Zale Dalen. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Conrad, as a divorced carpenter living in Alaska with three adolescent 
children, has a role that for him is surprisingly vulnerable, and he does 
justice to it. His character is resolute but he's not a hero; he's a flawed and 
stubborn guy with edgy relationships with his son and two daughters. 
</P>
<P>
Particularly well drawn is the youngest girl, a rather pampered, utterly 
authentic 12-year-old played by Emily Perkins. Her older brother and sister 
(Matthew LeBlanc and Ocean Hellman) are also gritty portrayals. 
</P>
<P>
But it's the brutal rains, the snow, the rocky shoals, the sea that make this 
production surge. For fans of outdoor survival literature, man's struggle with 
the unforgiving nature portrayed here reminds you of two classic short stories, 
Jack London's "To Build a Fire" and Stephen Crane's "Open Boat." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, there's a scene where the sisters, freezing and huddled, fall off a 
crumbling snowbank into the ocean, and the older girl just stands there, a pale 
resigned look on her face in the "cold-comfortable seawater" (to borrow Crane's 
"Open Boat" imagery). 
</P>
<P>
Here's action TV and a family adventure reduced to the basics. Even the 
prototypical secondary plot of long-simmering emotional scars exposed and 
resolved in the wilderness is conveyed with dispatch and a lack of pretension.

YOSEMITE AT 100: TROUBLE IN PARADISE;

YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Under a fresh blanket of snow, Yosemite Valley on a January morning is so 
peaceful that a weary coyote limps unmolested in the middle of a road. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the 3.4 million visitors a year who motor up mountain highways into 
Yosemite wait until the dogwood trees bloom and the waterfalls fill with spring 
runoff. In midwinter the valley is quiet and the haze hanging above the meadows 
is fog, not the brown campfire smoke and bus exhaust of warmer months. 
</P>
<P>
By this year, when Yosemite will mark its 100th birthday as a national park, 
the slow charm of winter was supposed to be easier to find even on busy summer 
weekends. 
</P>
<P>
The National Park Service boldly promised as much in a 1980 master plan that 
declared -- after hearing from more than 20,000 Americans -- it was time to 
save Yosemite's grandeur from being buried in "a march of man-made development 
. . . and fragments of suburbia." 
</P>
<P>
Auto traffic was to be banned from the valley. Scores of man-made intrusions 
would also go, including a beauty shop, cabins, offices and the homes of 
Yosemite Park &amp; Curry Co. executives, who live on a scenic meadow with 
afternoon views of the alpenglow on Half Dome. 
</P>
<P>
"Once this development is gone from the park's most magnificent settings, the 
scenery that inspired the philosophy of John Muir and the art of Ansel Adams 
will begin to be restored," the 1980 document waxed. 
</P>
<P>
But a decade later, the bold plan has been left mostly on paper -- and the 
future of Yosemite Valley left not much clearer today than it was 100 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic is up. Overnight lodgings have been added instead of torn down. And to 
the chagrin of purists, new businesses continue to open -- most recently a 
video rental store for park employees. 
</P>
<P>
At the once-rustic Ahwahnee Hotel, a grand shrine to some visitors and a symbol 
of misplaced luxury to others, the rooms were refurbished last year with TVs, 
mini-bars and videos. Later this year they are slated to get air conditioning 
to go with the tennis courts and swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, park officials say, Yosemite is in better condition now than in 1980. 
High country forests and meadows -- 94% of the park -- have been designated 
permanent wilderness. Bighorn sheep were reintroduced. A golf course at the 
Ahwahnee was torn out. And a recycling center and shuttle bus system now 
operate in the valley. 
</P>
<P>
But the Reagan Administration and Congress never put up money to carry out the 
most ambitious visions laid out in the 1980 plan, devised during the White 
House term of Jimmy Carter. 
</P>
<P>
The park's keepers now say many of the goals have proven impractical. And they 
add, maybe -- just maybe -- the 1980 plan waxed too poetic. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that plan was developed with the greatest sincerity," said Michael V. 
Finley, Yosemite's new superintendent. "But some of the things that seemed 
simple 10 years ago were not really so simple." 
</P>
<P>
The result has been a storm of protest from conservation groups, lifelong 
hikers and cliff-scaling daredevils who keep a close eye on anything that 
happens here -- and who had spent the 1980s confident that Yosemite would 
become more wild, not more commercial. 
</P>
<P>
"Yosemite is a very emotional subject with a lot of people," said Steve Medley, 
president of the 5,000-member Yosemite Assn., which has joined the protest. 
</P>
<P>
More than 3,000 letters and cards have flooded the park service since last 
summer, most demanding unequivocally that Yosemite go more natural. 
</P>
<P>
"It is simply too easy to visit Yosemite and be negligent," wrote Virginia 
Hanna of Novato. "Those of us who really want to see and experience the park 
would . . . happily ride a bus into the valley." 
</P>
<P>
"When I take children on hikes through the valley floor the levels of noise and 
pollution amaze me," wrote Julie Stoughton, an instructor with the Yosemite 
Institute. "Do we have to cater to the sedentary nature of the American 
public?" 
</P>
<P>
In a joint letter, the Wilderness Society, Sierra Club, National Audubon 
Society and the National Parks and Conservation Assn. charged the park service 
with failing in its duty to protect Yosemite. Those organizations and a new 
activist group, Yosemite Action, say they represent 1.5 million members. 
</P>
<P>
A target of the anger is the most visible symbol of development here -- 
Yosemite Park &amp; Curry Co., the concessionaire that operates the Ahwahnee 
and most other businesses allowed in the park. 
</P>
<P>
Company executives vow that they support reducing congestion and restoring 
Yosemite to a more natural state. But leading conservation groups and other 
critics say the company, a subsidiary of entertainment giant MCA Inc. -- 
operator of Universal Studios Tour -- treats Yosemite more as a mountain resort 
than a national park. 
</P>
<P>
Some frustrated environmental leaders have launched an effort to form a 
nonprofit group to bid for a new concession contract in 1993. They say the 
company has used its influence with the park service to stall the 1980 plan -- 
a charge company officials deny. 
</P>
<P>
"Yosemite Park &amp; Curry Co. has been working to water down the 1980 plan," 
said Patricia Schifferle, regional director of the Wilderness Society. "But the 
national parks were not created to provide hot dogs on demand." 
</P>
<P>
The Yosemite debate has been alive since before the high country was set aside 
as the third U.S. national park in 1890. (The valley and its soaring granite 
cliffs were added to the park in 1906). 
</P>
<P>
"The Yosemite is being rapidly converted into an ugly hay ranch," the San 
Francisco Examiner complained in the 1880s, when the valley's meadows were 
fenced and plowed. 
</P>
<P>
The hay fields are gone, but now more than a million vehicles a year enter 
Yosemite. On some summer and holiday weekends the valley roads are snarled and 
every parking spot filled. Visitors have inflicted such a toll on the valley 
that rangers last year banned firewood gathering. 
</P>
<P>
And scattered through the valley are the dorms, cabins and houses where about 
2,000 employees live. 
</P>
<P>
In its 1980 master vision, the park service was almost rhapsodic in promising 
that Yosemite would soon be restored to a more pristine form. 
</P>
<P>
"Yosemite Valley is but a mile wide and seven miles long, yet this tiny place 
on the face of the planet is a premier masterwork of the natural world," the 
1980 plan began. "Yosemite is too valuable to use for administration, 
maintenance, parking or any commercial services that do not contribute directly 
to a quality park experience." 
</P>
<P>
The plan called private automobiles "the single greatest threat" to Yosemite's 
environment and also warned that visitors could eventually be rationed -- as 
traffic is already on busy weekends. 
</P>
<P>
But in an update last summer that admitted little had been accomplished, the 
park service said it now believes practical obstacles make some of the more 
publicized goals unreachable and perhaps undesirable. 
</P>
<P>
Plans to move offices and employee housing outside the park to El Portal are 
threatened by water shortages and other troubles not known in 1980, the report 
said. Money may never be available to build distant parking lots and shuttle 
visitors into the park, it added. While visitation has jumped from 2.5 million 
in 1980 to 3.4 million, the park's budget last year was cut 10%. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the park service seemed to back off from the assumption that visitors 
may have to be inconvenienced. As the nation's population ages, the report 
said, Yosemite visitors want to stay close to their cars and sleep in warm 
rooms with their own bathrooms. 
</P>
<P>
The report was heavily criticized in the Yosemite community as inaccurate. The 
troubles at El Portal, for instance, were grossly overstated and no different 
than obstacles known in 1980, several critics said. 
</P>
<P>
An unusually harsh critique citing "grave concerns" was leveled by the Yosemite 
Assn., a nonpolitical fund-raising group that operates bookstores in the park. 
</P>
<P>
"Yosemite should not be just another comfortable resort," the group wrote in a 
long letter accusing park officials of backsliding. 
</P>
<P>
The Yosemite Assn. also complained that the entire report "has been handled in 
an unfair and unreasonable manner." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the 1980 plan, which was devised after years of public meetings and 
hearings around the country, the update was prepared in private. Even many top 
staffers at Yosemite were not consulted -- in part to avoid news leaks, park 
service officials said. Critics say that led to the mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
The park service admits the report contains some errors but insists the update 
does not abandon the 1980 vision. 
</P>
<P>
"It is simply an information document, a status report," said Ray Murray, a 
regional park service official in San Francisco. "We still are committed to the 
1980 goals. We will implement them as we get the money." 
</P>
<P>
But some key park service officials also have begun to publicly complain that 
the 1980 vision for Yosemite was not carefully researched and leaned too far in 
favor of nature purists. 
</P>
<P>
"Somehow tent campers are considered good and people who stay in trailers are 
bad," Finley said recently. "I may have felt that way at one time too, but I 
don't hold that view anymore. Everybody loves Yosemite equally, whether they 
come by foot or come in Winnebagos." 
</P>
<P>
Though outnumbered by the call for more nature, some letters supporting the 
status quo have reached the park service. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been visiting this park annually since 1977 and feel that every aspect 
of this park is perfect," wrote Marilyn Fuller of Santa Ana. "I do not find it 
too commercial or offensive even when it is crowded." 
</P>
<P>
More support for that view is expected when another 14,600 pieces of mail are 
delivered by Yosemite Park &amp; Curry Co. The company last fall mailed 95,000 
brochures and letters to recent customers of its hotels and motels asking them 
to write in opposition to cuts in overnight accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
"Please help protect your right to visit Yosemite in the future by writing 
today," company President Edward C. Hardy urged. 
</P>
<P>
The letter campaign came under fire from critics, including retired park 
service regional director Howard Chapman, who said lobbying by a concessionaire 
was inappropriate. But the company was justified in helping its customers make 
their opinions heard, Executive Vice President Dan Jensen said. 
</P>
<P>
The critics charge that the company's influence over the park service and 
Yosemite's future is already too great. They say the fate of the 1980 plan will 
be decided in upcoming talks on a new concession contract for the firm. 
</P>
<P>
"The decision will be whether a lucrative private business monopoly will be 
allowed to continue to dominate Yosemite Valley or whether the natural and 
scenic qualities . . . finally will take precedence," former Yosemite Supt. 
Robert O. Binnewies wrote in a letter to his old park service superiors. 
</P>
<P>
The role of MCA at Yosemite has been an issue since the entertainment giant 
bought the Curry Co. in 1973. Almost immediately MCA proposed erecting an 
aerial tram ride from the valley floor to Glacier Point and adding new motel 
rooms and convention facilities. Though the plans were dropped after vocal 
protests, environmental groups remained skeptical when the company fought 
wilderness designation for the high country. 
</P>
<P>
According to a recent park service memo, the company's commercial presence in 
Yosemite Valley has deepened since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
A new pizza and ice cream stand were added at Camp Curry, vending machines were 
placed around the park and a new photo lab and fudge shop were added in the 
Yosemite Village area. A raft rental shop opened and restaurants in the valley 
were expanded. 
</P>
<P>
Although the 1980 plan called for reducing overnight accommodations by 17% in 
the valley, six new luxury rooms were added at the Ahwahnee and 14 new 
motel-style rooms were added at the Yosemite Lodge, the memo said. Despite the 
1980 vision of a less congested Yosemite, the firm spent $669,000 marketing the 
park in 1988, the memo said. 
</P>
<P>
Saying times have changed, Yosemite Park &amp; Curry Co. officials last month 
asked for an official re-examination of the 1980 plan. They said the goals of 
reducing overnight accommodations and tearing out parking lots are out of date. 
They also argued for keeping their employees and executives in the valley. 
</P>
<P>
But the company denies interfering with the 1980 policy. "They're picking us 
out to be the bad guy, but we're following all the rules," Jensen said. "We 
don't have undue influence." 
</P>
<P>
By most accounts MCA has raised the quality of service and lodgings in Yosemite 
and is rated highly by the park service, which has suffered from poor service 
at other national parks. 
</P>
<P>
At Yosemite the jewel operation is the Ahwahnee Hotel, a wood edifice opened in 
1927 with huge public rooms and views of the granite cliffs. Its premier event 
is the Christmas Bracebridge dinner, which requires reservations a year ahead. 
The hotel also is used for meetings and, in winter, popular weeklong gourmet 
cooking and wine seminars. 
</P>
<P>
But some visitors, including some park service officials, consider the 
Ahwahnee's luxury out of place in Yosemite Valley and refuse to set foot in the 
place. 
</P>
<P>
The Ahwahnee style is most apparent in the mammoth dining room. The dress code 
at dinner is coats, ties and dresses. The menu offers rack of lamb, Belgian 
endive salad, and fresh swordfish and salmon. A $265 Chateau Lafite Rothschild 
graces the wine list, and diners can sip Remy Martin Louis XIII cognac at $50 a 
glass. 
</P>
<P>
Rates at the Ahwahnee bear little relation to costs or other rules of business. 
They are pegged by law to the rates at two California hotels the park service 
judges comparable: the Biltmore in Santa Barbara and La Valenica in La Jolla. 
Thus the Ahwahnee gets $170 a night for a standard room this winter and $370 
for suites with a view of Glacier Point. 
</P>
<P>
Curry Co. executives are secretive about finances and refuse to discuss the 
profitability of their business in Yosemite. But it was disclosed recently 
through the park service that the firm's gross sales were at least $78 million 
in 1988, up from about $69 million two years before. 
</P>
<P>
Under the contract that ensures a virtual monopoly, the company pays less than 
1% of its gross sales to the government -- a fee of about $590,000 in 1988. The 
fee rate was set in a 1963 contract that expires in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
In December, new Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. called for a sharp 
increase in the fees paid by national park concessionaires. Saying that some 
concessionaires were benefiting too greatly from their monopolies, he also 
ordered an investigation of the contracts and an audit of selected parks. 
</P>
<P>
Yosemite was not cited, but last week Lujan's spokesman, Steve Goldstein, said 
"Yosemite is a glaring example of the problem." 
</P>
<P>
Still, a higher fee might not help Yosemite, which last year cut half its 
wilderness rangers and ended a popular horse patrol because of budget troubles. 
</P>
<P>
Park Supt. Finley noted that franchise fees from concessionaires are paid into 
the federal Treasury, not given to the national parks. But he said the new 
contract could require Yosemite Park &amp; Curry Co. -- or a rival bidder -- to 
spend more money in the park. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental leaders, however, say they fear the park service lacks the 
sophistication to make serious demands in negotiations. "The park service," 
said Schifferle of the Wilderness Society, "is no match for MCA's attorneys and 
accountants." 
</P>
<P>
YOSEMITE AT 100 
</P>
<P>
 Yosemite visitation reached an all-time high last year. But budget cuts forced 
a reduction in the seasonal ranger force from 38 rangers to 12 and in nature 
interpreters from 36 to 17. The park's famous horse patrols and wilderness 
ranger program were discontinued.

MANY BELIEVE THEY CAN'T AFFORD GOOD HEALTH CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly one in four Americans put off medical treatment in the last year for 
fear they could not afford it, according to a Los Angeles Times Poll that has 
found widespread dissatisfaction with the accessibility of health care in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
The nationwide survey found that nearly half of all Americans believe they 
would be unable to afford good care if they became critically ill, and that 
blacks, Latinos and the poor feel especially ill-prepared to face the threat of 
major sickness or surgery. 
</P>
<P>
The poll also found significant disparities in the experiences of different 
groups within the health-care system, and a pervasive impression that the rich 
get the best care and the poor get the worst. 
</P>
<P>
Blacks were especially critical of the system. They were more pessimistic about 
its ability to meet the nation's health-care needs, and more inclined than many 
others to blame rising costs on doctors, rather than on malpractice suits and 
inadequate government controls. 
</P>
<P>
Latinos and the elderly, by contrast, appeared more sanguine. They were more 
likely than others to feel satisfied with the services they receive. And they 
were more inclined to believe that Americans get the best health care in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
"The feeling is not that the care is so bad " said I.A. Lewis, who directed the 
nationwide telephone survey of 2,046 Americans, conducted between Jan. 21 and 
24. "It's the frustration with the cost. The cost is the big, big issue." 
</P>
<P>
The poll examined public attitudes about the cost and quality of health care in 
the United States. It queried rich and poor, black and white, young and old, 
insured and uninsured on subjects ranging from emergency room care to nursing 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
The findings suggest that experiences and attitudes differ widely: 
</P>
<P>
* Blacks and Latinos are much less likely than others to get a correct 
diagnosis on their first visit to a doctor. Only one in three said they usually 
learn what is wrong on the first visit, compared to more than half of all 
Anglos and higher-income people. 
</P>
<P>
* More than a third of all blacks, Latinos and those with incomes under $20,000 
a year find themselves inadequately insured against the cost of major illness 
and major surgery. Fewer than a quarter of Anglos and the elderly, and only 11% 
of richer people are in the same position. 
</P>
<P>
* Forty-eight percent of everyone polled said they would be unable to afford 
good care if they became critically ill. That feeling is especially acute among 
blacks, Latinos, the poor and the uninsured. 
</P>
<P>
* Yet blacks, the elderly and the poor are more likely than others to be in ill 
health. Those same groups are more likely than others to have seen a doctor or 
been hospitalized in the last six months. 
</P>
<P>
* Blacks and the poor are more likely to have put off treatment of a serious 
condition for fear of the cost. Nearly one in four blacks and one in five poor 
people said they had done so in the last year, compared to one in 10 Anglos and 
one in 20 of those making over $40,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps as a result of those experiences, attitudes toward the system also 
differ. 
</P>
<P>
Two-thirds of everyone polled agreed that the rich get the best health care in 
the United States. While more than half agreed that the poor get the worst 
care, blacks were twice as likely as others to suspect that they, in fact, get 
the worst care. 
</P>
<P>
While most people feel the government must ensure that emergency room care is 
available to everyone, that feeling is almost universal among blacks -- nearly 
one in five of whom reported using emergency rooms for routine care, compared 
to just one in 33 Anglos. 
</P>
<P>
Latinos and the elderly are less likely than others to express dissatisfaction 
with the system. For example, the elderly were less critical of nursing-home 
care and less likely than others to express dissatisfaction with the cost of 
hospital care. 
</P>
<P>
Latinos, too, are less likely to feel entitled to government-funded services 
and more likely to be happy with what they have. They are more likely to feel 
they have some control over the quality of health care, and less likely to feel 
victimized by costs. 
</P>
<P>
However, the poll results also suggest considerable confusion. 
</P>
<P>
While more than one in two Americans is convinced that U.S. health care is 
top-notch and worth the extraordinary expense incurred, two-thirds nevertheless 
say they would prefer the less expensive Canadian system of national health 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that pervades this study is the anxiety and frustration people feel 
over health care costs, which almost everybody feels have gotten out of hand," 
said Lewis. "I think it says something when half the people in the United 
States say if they really got sick, they couldn't afford care." 
</P>
<P>
The poll's margin of error is estimated to be three percentage points in either 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
VIEWS ON HEALTH CARE 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Times Poll surveyed 2,046 men and women throughout the United 
States about the cost and quality of health care. It found widespread 
dissatisfaction with the accessibility of care and a consensus that the rich 
get the best care and the poor get the worst.

SERVICES HOARD $30 BILLION IN SURPLUS ITEMS 
</P>

<P>
America's armed services have $30 billion worth of unneeded military supplies 
and hardware gathering dust in warehouses across the country or rusting away 
outside, according to a report released Sunday by the Senate Budget Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Despite those stockpiles, the Pentagon had $20 billion worth of new orders in 
the pipeline and another $30 billion waiting to be spent on supplies and 
equipment, according to the committee study, carried out in the closing months 
of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The findings, gleaned from previous reports by the General Accounting Office 
and military auditors, interviews with Defense Department officials and 
inspections by staff aides for Budget Committee Democrats, were sent to Defense 
Secretary Dick Cheney on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney is scheduled to appear before the panel today to discuss the Bush 
Administration's proposed $295-billion defense budget for 1991. Committee 
Chairman Jim Sasser (D-Tenn.) said he intends to use the report to raise 
questions about potential budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
In conversations with officials as recently as last week, Sasser said, 
committee investigators were told that the Army alone has 12,000 categories of 
items in oversupply. 
</P>
<P>
"What we have," Sasser said in an interview Sunday, "is a disinclination to 
ever terminate contracts. Once they are signed, they go on and on. There are no 
incentives among purchasing people to save money." 
</P>
<P>
During the last five years, the report said, the Pentagon has spent about $700 
million to refurbish and expand its warehouse space. 
</P>
<P>
But the committee staff found that military warehouses and depots across the 
country were "glutted" and that expensive hardware sometimes was stored in the 
open, deteriorating from exposure to the elements. 
</P>
<P>
For example, parts for Apache helicopters were found stored outside because of 
a lack of available warehouse space and had to be extensively overhauled before 
use, investigators reported. In some cases, the parts were unsalvageable. 
</P>
<P>
They reported that in Oakland, ship propellers have been stored on docks 
because there is no space to store them inside. 
</P>
<P>
With the Administration planning to bring home thousands of American troops 
from Europe and congressional Democrats pushing for even greater troop 
reductions, Sasser said the surplus supply problems are apt to be compounded. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Cheney, Sasser called on the Pentagon to halt the purchase of 
items already on hand and to develop plans for disposal of unneeded items. He 
also asked for another review of the military's requirements for additional 
warehouse construction. 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, the armed forces' inventory of stored supplies and equipment 
amounts to more than $100 billion, of which an estimated $30 billion is 
unneeded, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1983 and 1988, during the Ronald Reagan Administration's military 
buildup, the inventory soared to $103 billion from $61 billion, the committee 
staff found. 
</P>
<P>
"The largest rate of growth . . . has been in 'inapplicable inventory' items 
(that) the Pentagon says it doesn't need and may never need," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
In the most extreme case cited in the report, investigators said they turned up 
what amounted to a 13,157-year supply of a machine tool used to make circuits 
for the Navy's F-14 Tomcat fighter plane. According to the report, only four of 
the tools are used each year, but the Navy has 52,628 of them in stock. 
</P>
<P>
The Army was found to have purchased 126 different sizes of shirts for female 
soldiers, many of which are never expected to be worn. 
</P>
<P>
The oversupply and the stocking of items of dubious use was blamed on poor 
management and inventory control practices. In some cases, those practices made 
it difficult to determine what was already in warehouses. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said that military agencies continued to buy items after they 
already had been identified as unneeded. The report cited a GAO finding last 
year that the Pentagon had on hand a more-than-50-year supply of 1,241 items, 
and a 25-to-50-year supply of another 852 items. The two categories together 
represented a value of more than $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
The warehouse crunch has led to even more mistakes in acquisition, according to 
the report. 
</P>
<P>
The committee staff cited one unidentified Army item, which was found to have 
been stored at 27 locations in California. In another case last year, the Army 
reported 80,000 jungle camouflage helmet covers as lost, purchased more, then 
found the missing 80,000. 
</P>
<P>
Some armed forces supply and warehousing operations are still using 
"old-fashioned pencil and paper" inventory control and management practices, 
Sasser said.

250,000 URGE REFORM IN PROTEST AT KREMLIN; 
</P>
<P>
SOVIET UNION: THE MOMENTUM FOR CHANGE GROWS ON EVE OF CENTRAL COMMITTEE 
MEETING. DEMONSTRATORS DEMAND AN END TO ONE-PARTY RULE.

<P>
A quarter of a million people, gathered outside the walls of the Kremlin in 
central Moscow, called Sunday for an end to the Soviet Union's system of 
one-party rule in one of the biggest political demonstrations since the 
Bolshevik Revolution brought the Communists to power more than 70 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
As the momentum for change gathered in advance of the meeting today of the 
Communist Party's policy-making Central Committee, the protest dramatized the 
growing demand for more sweeping reforms in the Soviet Union's political and 
economic system and the widespread impatience with their slowness so far. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd waved huge white-red-and-blue flags of pre-revolutionary Russia, an 
emblem for what many now regard as far better times, and held placards warning 
party officials to "Remember Romania," where a popular uprising overthrew 
President Nicolae Ceausescu's regime only six weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Things cannot continue as they are," Boris N. Yeltsin, the radical populist, 
told the vast crowd that had gathered in Manezh Square, across from the 
Kremlin. "At this plenum, the party has been given one last chance. 
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to restructure the Communist Party. There must not be a party 
monopoly on political power." 
</P>
<P>
This change would be so fundamental after more than seven decades of one-party 
rule by the Communists that virtually no other element of the Soviet political 
or economic system could stand without challenge. 
</P>
<P>
But the sentiments at the five-hour rally were such that the country seemed to 
be on the very edge of changes not seen since the Bolshevik Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
.j "We need a free society with a free economy . . . a society of truly free 
people," Gavriil Popov, a political economist, said, telling the rally that the 
party leadership is hindering reforms and calling upon the party to open talks 
with the country's emerging "democratic opposition" on the country's future. 
</P>
<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the party's general secretary, is scheduled to 
lay out his ideas for expanding and accelerating perestroika, as his reform 
program is known, when he addresses the Central Committee in the Kremlin this 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking with a delegation of coal miners, Gorbachev said in remarks published 
today in the Communist Party newspaper Pravda that the party no longer claims a 
monopoly on power and is prepared for "a political dialogue with all those who 
favor the renewal of a socialist society." 
</P>
<P>
"On a principled level, our point of view is that a multi-party system is not a 
panacea," he said, "but the degree of society's democratization is of decisive 
importance as is the democratic nature of all its structures." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev is expected to propose an end to the party's constitutionally 
guaranteed monopoly on political power and the acceptance of a multi-party 
system as a further extension of his concept of "power sharing," according to 
Radio Moscow's Interfax news service. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's rally, which began with a march through the center of the Soviet 
capital, had much of the atmosphere of the rallies last autumn in 
Czechoslovakia and East Germany before their conservative governments fell. 
</P>
<P>
Comparing the moment when the crowd, hundreds abreast, surged into the square 
facing the Kremlin, activist Oleg Rumyantsev, an organizer of the new Social 
Democratic Assn. here, told Radio Moscow, "The intensity, the emotional 
tension, the general joy were about the same" as that moment when the Berlin 
Wall was first breached. And his words were repeated and repeated and repeated 
on nationwide radio. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of flags and banners were held aloft in the square -- those of 
pre-revolutionary Russia, of the independent Ukraine, of the Baltic republics 
of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia and of 
Islam -- and all were shown in the extraordinary television coverage of the 
rally. 
</P>
<P>
The marchers, chanting in unison, denounced the KGB, the Soviet security 
police; Politburo conservative Yegor K. Ligachev, and the Soviet army for its 
intervention last month in Armenia and Azerbaijan. 
</P>
<P>
"Long live the beginning of the peaceful, nonviolent revolution of February, 
1990!" Yuri N. Afanasyev, a leading radical, told the cheering crowd as it 
assembled at the end of Gorky Street, just 170 feet short of the Kremlin and 
Red Square. 
</P>
<P>
Police blocked streets to allow the march, which had the permission of city 
authorities, and thousands of police and young soldiers from the internal 
security forces linked arms to funnel the demonstrators into the huge square. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd was estimated by police at more than 200,000, by Radio Moscow at 
300,000 and by Soviet television as simply "more than anyone has seen in the 
streets of Moscow for 70 years." 
</P>
<P>
Reporting extensively on the demonstration, Soviet television said: 
"Perestroika is storming through the party. The old guard is suffering blow 
after blow." 
</P>
<P>
But the official Soviet news agency Tass, increasingly a vehicle for 
conservative views, denounced the rally as "destructive" and an attempt to 
exert "pressure and blackmail." 
</P>
<P>
"Among the participants turned up people who take extreme positions," Tass 
said, "and in their speeches they, in fact, unmasked themselves as extremists. 
</P>
<P>
"They showed themselves as not concerned at all with the fortunes of 
perestroika and renewal but determined to use the platform of the rally to 
exert direct pressure on the public and the authorities." 
</P>
<P>
The mounting popular anger with the party was clearly evident, however, as the 
crowd cheered the most radical speakers. 
</P>
<P>
"The numbers of those present today is sufficient to storm the Winter Palace 
and the Lubyanka," Igor Chubal, a radical Communist, declared, referring to the 
Bolsheviks' capture of the Winter Palace in Leningrad in 1917 and to the 
headquarters of the KGB at Lubyanka prison in central Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
"If a peaceful resolution fails, we shall have to make a different one. . . . 
The Communist Party stands in the way of democratization. Like the Berlin Wall, 
it will fall if it remains such a barrier." 
</P>
<P>
The rally brought together supporters of popular fronts in Moscow and other 
cities, the Assn. of Moscow Voters, the Memorial, a group dedicated to 
remembering the victims of dictator Josef Stalin, and other reformers, and it 
marked a major step toward unity of what they call "the democratic opposition." 
</P>
<P>
"We have no more time," Nikolai I. Travkin, a member of the Congress of 
People's Deputies, said, calling for unity. "We do not have time for 
disagreements among ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, a former member of the ruling Politburo and still a member of the 
Central Committee, told the rally that he would ask to speak at the committee's 
closed-door meeting today and would propose repeal of Article 6 of the Soviet 
Constitution, which gives the party the "leading role" and, in effect, the 
exclusive right to rule. 
</P>
<P>
"There must be no monopoly of power," Yeltsin said to a thunderous roar from 
the crowd. "Down with the Communists!" 
</P>
<P>
Nikolai Shishlin, a senior Central Committee official, meanwhile told U.S. 
television on Sunday that a multi-party system would emerge soon in the Soviet 
Union and alter the composition of the government. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the political process is going in this direction, and I think that we 
will have a multi-party system," he said in an interview on ABC's "This Week 
with David Brinkley." 
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party has allowed the reform process to slow down, and measures 
are needed now to accelerate it again, Shishlin said. "Reforms will start in 
the party ranks because the party left behind perestroika, and just now it is 
necessary to reconstruct the party," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gennady I. Gerasimov, the Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman, explained that 
Gorbachev believes that the Communist Party cannot claim the leading role in 
the country unless it fights for it and wins in free elections. 
</P>
<P>
"My guess is that in this platform, they are going to say that if the party 
wants to be the leading party and win the elections it must be energetic enough 
to fight opponents and to win in free elections," Gerasimov told CBS's "Face 
the Nation."

AMERICAN ALBUM: SEATTLE OFFICIALS SOLD CITY'S 'SOUL' TO N.Y. INVESTORS.

SEATTLE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Residents of this city have finally found a group that irritates them more than 
the recent wave of immigrants from Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
New Yorkers. 
</P>
<P>
More specifically, a New York-based real estate firm called the Urban Group. 
Seattle has been shocked this winter to learn that local officials, starting in 
1981, quietly sold or leased to the company 11 buildings making up 90% of the 
city's famed Pike Place Market. 
</P>
<P>
If the Space Needle is the most visible symbol of Seattle, the market, in the 
words of produce seller Tim Manzo, "is the very heart and soul." 
</P>
<P>
And if new arrivals from California have added to Seattle's congestion and 
driven up housing prices, the New Yorkers seem infinitely worse: outsiders, 
jetting in and circulating an investment prospectus proposing to as much as 
triple market rents in a dozen years. 
</P>
<P>
"If that happens there won't be any of us left in business," said restaurateur 
Janet Shane, whose husband, Ron, has bought a T-shirt with a ghost buster-like 
slash mark over the letters N.Y. "All of this will be turned into some kind of 
boutique place," she said, gesturing to her funky, functional shoe box cafe 
with its vinyl booths and worn wood floor. 
</P>
<P>
The outrage by market tenants and city officials has taken the leaders of the 
30 or so Urban Group investors by surprise, said Donald Stark, a Seattle public 
relations consultant serving as spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they knew they were buying the soul of Seattle," Stark said, 
adding that all the group wants is a reasonable return on its property. 
</P>
<P>
Occupying a dozen buildings in a 7-acre national historic district downtown, 
the market's mix of farm produce, iced fresh fish, fragrant bakeries, craft 
stalls, antique shops, newsstands and cozy restaurants draws 10 million 
visitors a year. There are jugglers and street musicians, flower shops and 
import stores, low-income housing and a luxury hotel, all sandwiched between a 
brick street on one side and a Puget Sound view on the other. 
</P>
<P>
The bustling clamor, pungent smells and earthy homeliness of the market's 
labyrinth of passageways is the antithesis of swank new centers such as 
Westlake Mall a few blocks away. When McDonald's asked to locate there, it was 
swiftly turned down. 
</P>
<P>
Selling the market is tantamount to selling Fisherman's Wharf, Disneyland or 
the Statue of Liberty, Ron Shane said. 
</P>
<P>
And to New Yorkers no less, the folks the rest of America loves to hate. One 
merchant told a local columnist he'd prefer owners from another country, such 
as Japan, to those from another planet, such as New York. 
</P>
<P>
"I think if the New Yorkers get their way, (the) market is going to be torn 
down and replaced with some high-rise condo with a replica of the market 
underneath," said orchardist Bob Spanjer. 
</P>
<P>
"No way will the market be changed," vowed Mike Carroll, director of the city's 
Preservation and Development Agency, which runs the market. "The people of this 
city will not allow that to happen." 
</P>
<P>
But it was the agency that got the market into the current fix. Short of money 
in 1981 to complete planned renovation, the agency approached the Urban Group 
with a proposal to sell the market buildings for $23 million, $3 million of it 
in cash and the rest due in balloon payments in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
The Urban Group specializes in investments in historic buildings, including one 
in Seattle's Pioneer Square and another in neighboring Tacoma, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
The market got the $3 million needed to complete its work. The Urban Group got 
a tax write-off that President Arthur Malman said has resulted in $10 million 
in tax credits, accelerated depreciation and write-offs. 
</P>
<P>
Market officials now say they expected the New Yorkers to walk away from the 
deal once the balloon payment came due, since market rents couldn't cover the 
cost of the mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which eliminated the group's tax break. 
But with Seattle real estate values soaring, the group decided the buildings 
might be worth hanging onto, and it has proposed making its balloon payment by 
refinancing its mortgage. It has circulated a prospectus to outside investors 
that proposes raising rents and slashing expenses. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to market merchants, Malman and Martin Major, the Urban Group's 
vice president, have complained they have received only $4,000 in rent since 
the deal was struck. "Every time rent income went up, the PDA's (Preservation 
and Development Agency) overhead charges also went up as much or more," they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll replied that the market, run by an agency answerable to the public, is 
not supposed to produce income. The market also finances social service 
agencies for street people and day care. 
</P>
<P>
"The solution is getting the Urban Group to realize there is no profit here," 
Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
In coming months both sides are expected to give battle with dueling audits, 
budgets and histories drawn out of 1,000 pages of documents that comprise the 
deal. A Seattle deputy mayor with a reputation as a tough negotiator, Shelly 
Yapp, has been hired by Carroll's side. Ultimately the dispute could wind up in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, those at the market wish their new-found landlords would just go 
away. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they should accept the fact they made a bad investment, go home and 
quit whining," said Mariane Scott at Lil John's Produce. 
</P>
<P>
"Give em' back their damned $3 million," said Leon Franko, a fishmonger 
stacking squid, "and tell them where to go."

WALESA SAYS HE'LL PROBABLY QUIT AS LEADER OF SOLIDARITY

<TEXT>
<P>
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa said Sunday he probably will step down in April 
as leader of the union he founded as a shipyard electrician and ultimately led 
into control of the government. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa, 46, who has served as leader of the East Bloc's first independent trade 
union since its founding in 1980, made the statement during a speech before 
1,000 supporters after a Mass in his home city of Gdansk. 
</P>
<P>
At one point during the rally at St. Brygida's Church, Walesa was interrupted 
by heckling from a group of about 50 young radicals who feel the union has 
moved away from democratic processes. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa has often spoken about his desire to retire from the burdens of the 
union. Some people around him suspect he is preparing to make a bid for 
Poland's presidency, replacing Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, if Poland's 
constitution is altered this year requiring new presidential elections. 
</P>
<P>
"I am publicly saying that I will not run for (union) leadership at the 
regional congress (scheduled this week in Gdansk) and, most probably, at the 
national congress either," Walesa said. 
</P>
<P>
He had told a news conference Thursday that he was "tired" of his activity and 
would like to rest for at least two years. But he stressed then that if 
radicals threatened to take over Solidarity, he would stay on the job. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa led the union into a series of talks with the Communist government that 
led to the union being legalized anew, its participating in elections and 
ultimately to government control.

Rafael Angel Calderon, the son of a former president, won Costa Rica's 
presidential election Sunday over the candidate backed by Oscar Arias Sanchez, 
the country's beloved pacifist leader. 
</P>
<P>
Calderon, making his third run for the presidency at age 40, used a populist 
theme to end eight years of rule by Arias' National Liberation Party, despite 
its record of solidifying Costa Rica's standing as the most peaceful and 
prosperous nation in Central America. 
</P>
<P>
Arias, the 1987 Nobel Peace laureate, was limited by the constitution to a 
single four-year term. His approval rating soared to 80% in recent opinion 
polls but failed to help his party's colorless standard-bearer, Carlos Manuel 
Castillo. 
</P>
<P>
Castillo conceded defeat four hours after the polls closed, with about a third 
of the ballots counted. He had 47% of the vote, to 51% for Calderon and the 
rest divided among five other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Calderon's Social Christian Unity Party also appeared to have won control of 
the 57-seat unicameral Legislative Assembly. It led in 29 races, to 25 for 
Liberation and 3 for splinter parties. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very proud to be president-elect of Costa Rica, not for the title but for 
the extraordinary people that I will represent," Calderon said in a victory 
speech to scores of screaming supporters in a hotel ballroom. 
</P>
<P>
Calderon, who will take office May 8, has been training for the job since the 
death of his father, former President Rafael Calderon Guardia, in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
"He will receive a country at peace and in full economic development," Castillo 
said. "He had better take care of it. He had better improve it." 
</P>
<P>
The election was the 10th in a row conducted peacefully in Costa Rica since 
Calderon Guardia tried to upset the result of the 1948 vote and touched off a 
popular uprising. That led to the abolition of Costa Rica's army and made the 
National Liberation Party the country's leading political force. The party has 
won seven of those 10 elections. 
</P>
<P>
Except for a brief tainting by drug-money scandals, this was one of Costa 
Rica's dullest campaigns. It pitted a pair of two-time losers with scant 
ideological differences and pale popularity ratings next to Arias. 
</P>
<P>
Arias won the Nobel Prize for promoting a Central American peace plan that, by 
reducing the war in neighboring Nicaragua, helped him preside over four years 
of economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
While touting prosperity, his party presented Castillo, a 61-year-old economist 
of hemispheric renown and a former vice president, as the Costa Rican George 
Bush, the most qualified man ever to seek the presidency. "We can trust him" 
was the party's campaign theme, 
</P>
<P>
But Castillo, who lost as his party's nominee in 1982 and 1986, was wooden on 
the stump. Former President Luis Alberto Monge, a member of the Liberation 
Party, called Castillo "a bad candidate who would make a good president." 
</P>
<P>
Calderon shed the militaristic stance that cost him the last election to Arias 
and ran this time as a poor man's champion in his father's populist mold. While 
avoiding a direct attack on Arias' record, Calderon charged that Liberation was 
corrupt and trying to set up a one-party state. 
</P>
<P>
According to pollsters, Unity benefitted from a widely held view that Arias' 
government had not done enough to distribute the benefits of the economic boom. 
Agriculture, the mainstay of the economy, was hit hard by slumping world prices 
for coffee and other exports. 
</P>
<P>
To a lesser degree, Arias' party was tarnished by findings of a Costa Rican 
congressional probe into drug trafficking that prompted several officials to 
resign. Castillo first denied, then admitted last year, that he had received a 
1985 campaign contribution of $2,364 from a reputed drug trafficker -- a man he 
said he didn't know at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Liberation countered by leaking a former Panamanian official's testimony to a 
closed U.S. congressional hearing that named Calderon as the recipient in 1985 
of a $500,000 campaign contribution from Panama's Gen. Manuel A. Noriega. 
Calderon rejected the testimony as "a dirty smear." 
</P>
<P>
The election confirmed an ideological shift in Central America, where two 
presidents elected last year, Alfredo Cristiani in El Salvador and Rafael 
Callejas in Honduras, are more conservative than their predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
Calderon has promised to build 160,000 low-income housing units in four years 
and exempt poor home buyers from down payments. He also vows to increase food 
subsidies and other benefits to the poor. 
</P>
<P>
Calderon was born in Nicaragua. After graduation from the University of Costa 
Rica law school in 1972, Calderon served a term in the Legislative Assembly 
from 1974 to 1978 and was foreign minister from 1978 to 1982 before launching 
his unsuccessful presidential bids. 
</P>
<P>
He and his Mexican-born wife, Gloria Bejarano, have two sons and two daughters, 
aged 8 to 16.

Authorities arrested 70 members of the outlawed Nepali Congress Party as it 
prepared to launch a campaign demanding that political organizations be 
legalized in Nepal, a party spokesman said in Katmandu. 
</P>
<P>
All political parties are banned in Nepal. The leftist Nepali Congress Party, 
banned 29 years ago, decided recently to launch a nationwide campaign to demand 
restoration of a multi-party system. The Congress Party was voted into power in 
1959, but was overthrown 18 months later in a royal takeover.

Armenian negotiators broke off informal peace talks with Azerbaijanis and 
headed home Sunday after accusing them of pressuring Armenians to evacuate two 
villages in Azerbaijan, a participant said. 
</P>
<P>
Armenian leaders also said that the Armenian All-National Movement is refusing 
to ratify an agreement to seek a peaceful settlement of the conflict and 
exchange information on hostages. 
</P>
<P>
The talks, held in Riga, Latvia, without the participation of the Soviet 
government, began Friday with mediators from people's fronts movements in the 
western republics of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania. Direct talks followed on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything went well until there was a pause in the talks. Then the leaders of 
the Armenian All-National Movement in Yerevan told the negotiators to cut the 
talks," said Ints Upmacis, a Latvian People's Front leader present during the 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The Armenians headed for Yerevan early Sunday, Upmacis said in a telephone 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
The Armenian political movement in Yerevan accused the Azerbaijan People's 
Front of pressing Armenian residents to evacuate the villages of Azad and Kamo 
in the Khanlar region of Azerbaijan, the official news agency Tass reported. 
</P>
<P>
The residents were told they are in danger of being attacked, and the Armenians 
contend that the army said it is unable to guarantee their safety, Upmacis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Armenian National Movement board does not find it possible to continue 
joint consultations in Riga," a statement issued by the movement's press center 
in Yerevan said. "Joint consultations and talks can be possible in the future 
only on condition of the termination of such actions." 
</P>
<P>
When informed that the Armenians were planning to leave the talks, the 
Azerbaijani negotiators agreed to try to verify the Armenian claim, but 
Communist Party officials and Soviet army officials reached in the Azerbaijani 
capital of Baku said they had no information to support the charges. 
</P>
<P>
The Azerbaijani delegation said it is ready to resume talks with the Armenians 
and departed for a meeting of representatives of pro-democracy groups in the 
Lithuanian capital of Vilnius, Upmacis said. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Azerbaijani People's Front in Baku could not be immediately 
reached to comment on the Armenian decision. 
</P>
<P>
Outbreaks of ethnic violence have plagued the two southern republics for two 
years after Armenia's demand for annexation of Nagorno-Karabakh, a 
predominantly Armenian enclave located inside Azerbaijan.

SPECTER OF DEATH HAUNTS A ONCE-LIVELY PARK;

AZERBAIJAN: 'GRAVEYARD OF MARTYRS' ECHOES TO THE STIFLED SOBS AND THE SHUFFLING

Kirov Park here in the capital of Azerbaijan used to be a happy place, a 
combination amusement park and hilltop lookout point with the city's best view 
of the Caspian seaside below. It was full of music and young people, laughing 
and courting. 
</P>
<P>
Now it is a place of death. 
</P>
<P>
The carnival rides were under wraps Sunday, the trees festooned with mourning 
banners. Instead of laughter, there were stifled sobs, the funeral wail of a 
mullah, the sounds of thousands of shuffling feet. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, death has brought far more visitors to the park than recreation 
ever did -- several hundred thousand daily, according to a commission that has 
supervised the site ever since it was transformed two weeks ago into the 
"graveyard of martyrs." 
</P>
<P>
Eighty-seven people have been buried in the park so far, all in a long row 
punctuated at the end by a hand-lettered sign stuck into a pile of building 
stones. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the result of the Russian imperialist genocide against the Azerbaijani 
people," the sign reads in Azeri, the Azerbaijani language. 
</P>
<P>
The dead are all victims of the gunfire of army and Interior Ministry troops 
that began Jan. 20 when troops broke out of their blockaded barracks to impose 
a state of emergency on an aroused population that believed itself to be immune 
from being shot down in its own streets. 
</P>
<P>
"Even now, people who died in hospital from wounds received then are being 
brought here," said Nariman Aliev, an architect and member of the 11-man 
funeral commission that has helped turn this hilltop into a powerful symbol of 
national resistance. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities say the repressive action was necessary to restore order after 
three days of bloody anti-Armenian pogroms in the city. They blame the 
bloodshed on armed "extremists" intent on an anti-Communist coup d'etat. 
</P>
<P>
But most Azerbaijanis seem to be convinced that this was just an excuse. What 
Moscow really wants is to strangle their nascent Popular Front movement before 
it humiliates the party with genuine democratic elections, they say. 
</P>
<P>
Either way, the scene at Kirov Park suggests that a threshold has been crossed 
and that there can never be a return to the days when the Communist leadership 
in the Kremlin held unquestioned sway over this island of Islam in the Soviet 
Transcaucasus. 
</P>
<P>
"I too stood before the tanks," a weeping Dr. Solmas Orudjeva, 50, shouted to a 
reporter Sunday. "Am I an extremist?" the woman, a physician, asked 
sarcastically. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, those who remained alive are called extremists. But our only guilt is 
that we stayed alive when the tanks came in. Vandals!" she raged against the 
Soviet troops. "Fascists!" 
</P>
<P>
There was more sullenness than shouting at the park Sunday, however. By early 
afternoon, the line to file past the graves extended the length of the park and 
into a square opposite. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't enter without flowers," a dark-haired Azerbaijani advised as he 
steered a newcomer toward a stand where other men were handing out bundles of 
red carnations free of charge. "Carry them like this," the guide said, placing 
the flowers, their petals directed downward, in the visitor's hand. 
</P>
<P>
Carnations placed side by side on the ground extended the entire quarter-mile 
length of the park, and in that portion of the park where the victims are 
buried, they were piled in such numbers that they formed a thick floral fence 
for about 200 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Mourners filed past a black booth from which a Muslim cleric chanted prayers 
over a loudspeaker system. Azerbaijanis are considered perhaps the most secular 
of all of the Soviet Union's millions of Muslims, but many Islamic traditions 
survive. 
</P>
<P>
There was a photograph at the head of the grave of almost every victim. A young 
couple pictured on their wedding day, a teen-age girl in her graduating best, a 
small boy, a policeman. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, the victims of that day are far more numerous -- maybe by 10 times 
-- than the number of graves here," said the funeral commission's Aliev, now a 
former Communist. He and several other members of the commission quit the party 
in protest, accusing it of ultimate responsibility for what happened here. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the victims were buried elsewhere in family plots, but Aliev and nearly 
everyone else here swears that hundreds of other bodies were destroyed, taken 
secretly away or simply dumped into the sea to conceal the real death toll. 
</P>
<P>
Baku is under martial law, and the deputy military commander, Maj. Gen. Anatoly 
Kirilyuk, said in an interview Sunday that 138 people died as a result of last 
month's battle in the city, 106 of them civilians and the rest soldiers, 
internal security troops and policemen. 
</P>
<P>
"Our visitors include many nationalities -- Jews, Russians, Tatars," Aliev 
noted. "It is not just Azerbaijanis, although of course they predominate." 
</P>
<P>
Do any Armenians come? 
</P>
<P>
The architect smiled in surprise at the question before answering: "Nyet."

Cyclone Ofa -- the South Pacific equivalent of a hurricane -- lashed American 
Samoa with winds up to 110 m.p.h., causing widespread damage and injuring 
several people but causing no deaths. There were no immediate reports from the 
nearby independent nation of Western Samoa, where the eye of the cyclone passed 
50 miles west of the island of Savii. American Samoa, a seven-island U.S.

Jobs for the unskilled and poorly educated are disappearing, and future 
employment will require, if not higher education, at least good communications 
skills and basic ability in math and reading, according to a study by the 
Population Reference Bureau, an independent research group. The study, "America 
in the 21st Century: Human Resource Development," says managerial, professional 
and technical jobs will have the highest percentage of growth, while the 
greatest actual number of new jobs are expected to be among retail sales, 
office workers, cleaners and waiters.

AS EEOC CHIEF, NOMINEE SIDED WITH XEROX IN AGE BIAS CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On March 16, 1987, Clarence Thomas, chairman of the Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission, met behind closed doors with three fellow commissioners 
to decide whether to file suit against the Xerox Corp. for age discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
Their discussion, a portion of which is excerpted below, provides an unusual 
glimpse at the past actions of Thomas, whose nomination to the U.S. Court of 
Appeals will be taken up by a Senate committee this week. 
</P>
<P>
In a three-year investigation, EEOC staff lawyers had found that hundreds of 
employees were given the choice of resigning with extra severance pay or facing 
dismissal. At the same time, the company was hiring new, younger and 
lesser-paid employees to fill the same jobs. 
</P>
<P>
In a memo to the commissioners, a staff lawyer concluded the company had 
engaged in a "massive" and "blatantly illegal" program to get rid of its older 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
According to a transcript of the meeting, Thomas argued strenuously against 
siding with the employees. 
</P>
<P>
THOMAS: "First of all, this is a standard practice in industry. I don't know 
why Xerox is the only one we are after. If Xerox is on the chopping block, we 
have got about 100 other corporations we should be looking at. It's a simple as 
that. OK? GM is doing the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel strongly that these voluntary reductions in force (are legal), 
particularly among these top executives, unless someone can show me it is 
coercion." 
</P>
<P>
VICE CHAIRMAN RICKY SILBERMAN: "What if it is not top executives? These are not 
top executives." (The staff said most earned between $35,000 and $50,000 a 
year. More than 1,300 employees were involved.) 
</P>
<P>
THOMAS: "There are many executives. I mean you have a certain amount of age -- 
not age -- but you have a certain number of years. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
SILBERMAN: "And cost of salary." 
</P>
<P>
THOMAS: "And it just adds a sweetener. It is a sweetener. You can take it or 
leave it. Now if there is coercion, then I think it is a whole different issue. 
OK? But as long as it is voluntary, I don't see where costs or anything else 
has anything to do with it." 
</P>
<P>
SILBERMAN: "And do you think the threat of a RIF (reduction in force or layoff) 
constitutes coercion?" 
</P>
<P>
THOMAS: "I think it constitutes reality." 
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, the EEOC voted 3 to 1, with Thomas in the majority, against 
intervening on behalf of the Xerox employees. DAVID G. SAVAGE

<P>
Clarence Thomas is a 41-year-old, Yale-educated lawyer. He is articulate, 
conservative, a critic of affirmative action -- and black. 
</P>
<P>
For all these reasons, Republicans see him as a star in the making. President 
Bush nominated him last year to a highly visible judgeship: the U.S. Court of 
Appeals seat in Washington last held by rejected Supreme Court nominee Robert 
H. Bork. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Democratic-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee will consider 
his nomination. If confirmed, Thomas is seen as a potential successor to 
Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, the high court's only black. 
</P>
<P>
In the eyes of some conservatives, the Thomas nomination could mark a historic 
shift in attitudes about blacks and civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall, as a lawyer with the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored 
People, made his mark in the early days of the civil rights movement by 
attacking "Jim Crow" laws and winning court victories outlawing legal 
segregation. Since ascending to the Supreme Court in 1967, he has been the 
leading proponent of the view that blacks should be compensated for their 
decades of oppression through preferences in college admissions, jobs and 
government contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas represents a new generation, one that entered the work force after legal 
segregation was abolished. In speeches and interviews, he has argued that only 
individual merit, not race, should count. 
</P>
<P>
"No one should be rewarded or punished because of group characteristics," 
Thomas has said. 
</P>
<P>
That was, of course, the view put forth by former President Ronald Reagan and 
his attorney general, Edwin Meese III, but the words can carry a greater weight 
when they come from a black man who grew up poor in the South, as Thomas did. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, Reagan picked Thomas, then 33, to be chairman of the Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission, the agency charged with enforcing the nation's 
anti-discrimination laws in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
As EEOC chief, Thomas displayed a deep skepticism toward traditional, 
broad-scale civil rights enforcement. He said he wanted to focus on individual 
instances of bias. 
</P>
<P>
Critics said he was more interested in protecting big business than 
investigating unfair treatment, especially allegations of age and sex 
discrimination. On occasion, he was compared to such Reagan appointees as 
Interior Secretary James G. Watt, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator 
Ann McGill Burford and Justice Department civil rights chief William Bradford 
Reynolds, who became notorious in Congress for undermining the laws they were 
charged with enforcing. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas had his share of spats with Congress, too. In 1988, it was revealed that 
nearly 9,000 complaints of age discrimination lodged with the EEOC had lapsed 
because the agency failed to act on them within the required two-year time 
period. When congressional Democrats complained, Thomas lashed back, charging 
he was the victim of a "hatchet job." 
</P>
<P>
In the House, 14 committee heads -- all Democrats -- fired off a letter to the 
White House charging Thomas "had demonstrated an overall disdain for the rule 
of law." 
</P>
<P>
But his star did not dim for Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
"From the beginning, President Bush made clear that he wanted Clarence to have 
an important role in the Administration. The only question was what would be 
the best role for Clarence," said Murray Dickman, a Justice Department official 
who coordinates the selection of federal judges for Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh. 
"We view this (the appeals court to which Thomas was nominated) as the second 
most important court in the land." 
</P>
<P>
As the ideological battles between the Democratic-dominated Congress and the 
Republican-controlled executive branch have intensified, the U.S. Court of 
Appeals for the District of Columbia has been called upon increasingly to 
decide technical, but highly charged disputes over the meaning of federal law 
and federal regulations. 
</P>
<P>
During the Reagan years, liberal legal activists repeatedly went to court 
charging Administration officials with failing to enforce the law as written by 
Congress. The issues ranged from workplace safety and food dyes to "fairness" 
in broadcasting and the constitutionality of the independent-counsel statute. 
</P>
<P>
Aware of the high stakes, the Reagan White House put many of its most reliably 
conservative attorneys on the 12-member District of Columbia appeals court, 
including Judges Antonin Scalia, Douglas H. Ginsburg and Bork, all of three of 
whom were later nominated to the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Thomas nomination has attracted unusual attention. It has also 
left Washington's liberal civil rights Establishment in an uneasy spot. 
</P>
<P>
Some activists wanted to fight his confirmation in the Senate and spent months 
gathering information. They say the record is clear: Based on his actions at 
the EEOC, Thomas cannot be trusted to fairly enforce the law. 
</P>
<P>
But the leaders of the prominent civil rights organizations, divided among 
themselves, say they will not take a stand on the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, the Leadership Conference (on Civil Rights) has no position," 
said Ralph Neas, executive director of the coalition of more than 100 civil 
rights groups. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, these groups have derided Republican administrations for not 
appointing blacks to high-level legal jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, when Bush nominated as head of the Justice Department's civil rights 
division William Lucas, a former Wayne County, Mich., sheriff who is black, 
civil rights lobbyists nonetheless opposed the nomination. They contended Lucas 
was not qualified for the post, and the Senate Judiciary Committee voted him 
down. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas is Bush's first black nominee to the federal bench, and no one contends 
he is unqualified. 
</P>
<P>
Says Patrick McGuigan, an official of the Free Congress Foundation, a 
conservative group backing the nomination: "Clarence has an awesome legal 
background: Yale, assistant attorney general in Missouri, aide to (Sen.) John 
Danforth (R-Mo.), assistant secretary at the Department of Education, and now 
EEOC. He's done it all." 
</P>
<P>
The American Bar Assn. gave Thomas a less-glowing endorsement. Its 15-member 
evaluation committee rated Thomas as "qualified," which means "it appears the 
prospective nominee would be able to perform satisfactorily as a federal 
judge." 
</P>
<P>
That was one of three possible ratings. A "well-qualified" nominee is one who 
gets the association's "strong affirmative endorsement . . . as one of the best 
available for the vacancy," while a "not qualified" nominee is considered "not 
adequate from the standpoint of integrity, competence or temperament." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas is expected to get some sharp questioning from Judiciary Committee 
Democrats, but aides and lobbyists said they believe he will be confirmed by a 
wide margin. 
</P>
<P>
Still smarting over the defeats of Bork and Lucas, committee Republicans are 
taking no chances with Thomas. They have loudly protested the staff 
investigation of Thomas as unduly thorough. In a letter signed by Chairman 
Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), the EEOC was asked to turn over detailed files on 
how Thomas handled various age-discrimination cases. That prompted a Wall 
Street Journal editorial labeling the committee's investigation as "the next 
lynching." 
</P>
<P>
Despite such allegations, the President's judicial nominees are rarely rejected 
by the Senate. During eight years in office, Reagan filled 378 of the 752 
judgeships in the three-tiered federal court system. Only three of his nominees 
were voted down: district court nominee Jefferson B. Sessions III of Alabama in 
1986, Supreme Court nominee Bork in 1987 and appeals court nominee Bernard 
Siegan of San Diego in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Much information on Thomas' tenure at the EEOC already has been made public and 
failed to cause much of a stir. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the Senate Special Committee on Aging published an 837-page report 
detailing how Thomas and the EEOC rejected a complaint of widespread age 
discrimination at the Xerox Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Though the EEOC is charged by law with enforcing the age-discrimination law and 
prosecuting violators, the agency, at Thomas' urging, voted not to take on the 
Xerox case. Instead, the employees hired a private lawyer and filed a 
class-action lawsuit that is still pending. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate suit against Xerox, a federal court jury in Dallas last month 
awarded more than $9 million in damages to a 46-year-old woman who contended 
she was discharged because of her age. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the American Assn. of Retired Persons urged the Judiciary Committee 
to "thoroughly examine" Thomas' record on enforcing the age-discrimination 
laws. But the letter stopped short of opposing the nominee.

RAY BUCKEY VOWS 'FIGHT TO MY LAST BREATH' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
McMartin Pre-School defendant Ray Buckey, in his first public comments since he 
was acquitted last month on 52 molestation counts, vowed in a "60 Minutes" 
interview Sunday to "fight to my last breath" to clear himself of the 13 
charges refiled against him. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with CBS commentator Mike Wallace, Buckey, 31, criticized the 
American judicial system, which kept him and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 
63, locked up for years while they were tried in the longest and costliest 
criminal trial in history. 
</P>
<P>
The Buckeys were found not guilty in January of molesting children at the 
family-run day care center in Manhattan Beach after a 6-year case -- including 
a 2 1/2-year trial -- that cost taxpayers more than $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
But the Los Angeles Superior Court jury deadlocked on 13 remaining counts, and 
a mistrial was declared on those allegations. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors announced last week that Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner 
decided to retry Ray Buckey on the 13 charges after extraordinary public 
lobbying by parents and child protection groups to rally public support for a 
retrial. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge William Pounders set a March 9 trial date, but defense 
attorney Danny Davis has filed papers to remove Pounders -- who presided at the 
first trial -- from the case, a tactic that could delay the trial's opening. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Buckey, who is free on his own recognizance, had not commented on the case 
before being interviewed by Wallace. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to go through another McMartin trial, but I will, because I know 
I'm innocent," he told Wallace. "I'll fight to my last breath to get vindicated 
in the system in some way, because there's no end to what they've done to me. . 
. . I'm not going to roll over for something I never did. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw what the system did," Buckey said. "I saw how it treated children. I saw 
how it treated adults. It doesn't work very well . . . but it worked worse for 
the defendants, because we can never clear our names." 
</P>
<P>
Buckey also criticized some of the parents and others who marched in a rally to 
call for a retrial. 
</P>
<P>
"These people are not quite all in kilter," he told Wallace. "Nothing that 
happened at the preschool is the cause of (the children's) hell. 
</P>
<P>
"The cause of their hell is the product of the adults who took on this case and 
made it what it is." 
</P>
<P>
Wallace commented that some members of the McMartin jury believed the alleged 
victims had, indeed, been molested. 
</P>
<P>
"All I can reply to that is I know these children weren't molested at the 
preschool," Buckey said. 
</P>
<P>
Peggy McMartin Buckey, who also was interviewed on "60 Minutes," repeated 
comments she had made last month about her family's innocence.

HOME FOR RETARDED, DISABLED TO CLOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HURST, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Giant nursing home chain operator Beverly Enterprises is closing a large 
facility for the retarded in Lynwood after receiving critical inspection 
reports citing substandard living conditions, lack of staffing and failure to 
provide proper care and treatment of clients. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly officials say they are closing the Lynwood Care Center, licensed for 
128 clients, because the company cannot afford to provide the quality of 
rehabilitation programs demanded by new, stricter federal regulations and not 
because of poor conditions found by state licensing officials during 
inspections in September, October and December. 
</P>
<P>
The facility is tentatively scheduled to close March 16. 
</P>
<P>
Licensing officials recommended on Dec. 27 that Medi-Cal funding -- which pays 
for all patients at Lynwood -- not be renewed because of the facility's failure 
to provide sufficient staff and "active treatment services" for its clients, 
many of whom are profoundly retarded as well as physically disabled. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt they were wrong in their findings," said Bill Mathies, Beverly's vice 
president of operations. 
</P>
<P>
Mathies said the company decided, nonetheless, to close Lynwood Care Center 
instead of appealing the Medi-Cal cutoff because of heavy financial losses at 
the facility. 
</P>
<P>
The 69 clients still living at Lynwood Care Center will be transferred to state 
institutions and other large private facilities for the retarded, some of which 
also have been repeatedly cited for providing allegedly poor care. 
</P>
<P>
For example, some of the patients will be transferred to Beverly's Glenridge 
Center in Glendale, said Dexter Henderson, executive director of the 
South-Central Regional Center, the agency responsible for placing many of the 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
Inspectors cited that facility last August in more than 40 pages detailing 
allegedly poor living conditions and treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Among their findings, inspectors reported cockroach and fly infestations, 
overflowing garbage bins, threadbare linen, clients who were shoeless, poorly 
dressed and who were left to idly sit in rooms; a client who was left for hours 
in a wet diaper and clients who were rapidly force-fed. 
</P>
<P>
"A . . . profoundly mentally retarded female," said an Aug. 21 report, "was fed 
her entire breakfast . . . in four minutes. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
A Beverly spokesman said Glenridge Center has since been praised by state 
officials for a "magnificent turnaround" and point to a vastly improved 
inspection report on Nov. 20. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Pavlow, administrator of Glenridge Center, said the facility has hired 
additional staff members and now provides increased care and instruction for 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly officials announced similar changes at the Lynwood Care Center two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Jack MacDonald, a Beverly vice president, said the company had installed a new 
administration at the facility to deal with its problems and implement an 
"active treatment program." 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, inspectors filled 35 pages with allegations of poor conditions and 
treatment at the facility, including a cockroach infestation, peeling paint, 
food-encrusted wheelchairs, patients who were dressed in ragged, dirty clothes 
and were allowed to hurt themselves without intervention by staff members. 
</P>
<P>
"I will not tell you that this has not been an up-and-down facility," said 
Beverly spokesman Bill Ihle. He said conditions at Lynwood Care Center had been 
improved even though the facility will be closed. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly officials maintain that the Lynwood Care Center's problems are 
symptomatic of all such facilities because they say Medi-Cal payments of $62 
per day are not adequate to meet the federal government's demand over the last 
year for more "active" rehabilitation procedures for clients. 
</P>
<P>
They cite losses last year of more than $1 million at their five facilities for 
the retarded in Southern California, including a $682,000 deficit at Lynwood 
Care Center. 
</P>
<P>
However, both Lynwood Care Center and Glenridge Center were repeatedly cited 
for poor care before federal treatment standards were upgraded. 
</P>
<P>
The facilities also have posted profits before recent losses. Glenridge, for 
example, reported profits of $630,000 between 1985 and 1988.

UNLEASHING THEIR POWER;

DOG OWNERS LOBBY FOR RIGHT TO LET PETS RUN FREE IN PARKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
The knot of people gathered in the West Los Angeles park chatted amiably in the 
waning sunshine, leashes in hand, as more than two dozen dogs raced and tumbled 
over each other on a carpet of grass. 
</P>
<P>
When strangers approached on a recent afternoon, the dog owners eyed them 
warily: Were they animal control police come to ticket scofflaws flouting leash 
laws? They weren't, but it started them debating again -- should they push to 
make it legal for their pooches to romp sans leash. 
</P>
<P>
Claudia Harrington and her year-old Dalmatian don't have to worry about that 
anymore. On Saturday, her hometown of Santa Monica christened its first haven 
for untethered dogs at Memorial Park. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a giant first step," the Santa Monica woman said approvingly, as 
Abercrombie bolted among more than 30 dogs in the rectangular 21-foot by 
230-foot fenced run at the northwest corner of the park. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, Santa Monica has banned even a leashed animal from setting paw to a 
blade of city grass or grain of city sand. But the opening of the dog run this 
weekend on a six-month trial basis, if successful, could lead the City Council 
to approve other such dog facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The Memorial Park Dog Run, the first such legal off-leash area for pets on the 
Westside and only the second in the Los Angeles area, is proof of the growing 
clout of a determined new interest group: the canine lobby. 
</P>
<P>
It began in Los Angeles at Laurel Canyon Park in the Hollywood Hills, where 
dogs were allowed off leash during certain hours of the day in 1988, after a 
bitter three-year-battle between dog owners and other neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Last July, Harrington's group, PAWS (Parks Are Worth Sharing) persuaded the 
Santa Monica City Council to consider the needs of people with dogs. 
</P>
<P>
And despite some setbacks -- as in Hermosa Beach, where voters last fall 
rejected a dog-park ballot initiative after a campaign dominated by debate over 
growth, public safety and dog droppings -- the canine lobby is slowly marking 
wider territory, targeting parts of Woodley Park in Van Nuys and Griffith Park 
for free-ranging Fidos. 
</P>
<P>
"Dog owners are becoming more organized and are starting to flex their muscles 
in the political arena," said Los Angeles City Councilman Michael Woo, who 
turned the tide for the Laurel Canyon group, ParkWatch, becoming the first City 
Council member to endorse relaxing the city's leash laws for certain hours of 
the morning and evening. 
</P>
<P>
The movement has hopscotched across Northern California, where at least half a 
dozen dog parks now exist in the Bay Area. It has spread to the Midwest, and 
even to the Big Apple, where dog owners are lobbying for a piece of mid-town 
Manhattan. Even city officials in San Clemente and Bloomington, Ind., have 
contacted groups such as ParkWatch for information. 
</P>
<P>
Said Doris Richards, who led the successful fight for Berkeley's Ohlone Dog 
Park in 1979: "We've been forced into it because dogs -- and people with dogs 
-- are being discriminated against" in an ever more urbanized society. 
</P>
<P>
As rolling hills and fields have given way to skyscrapers, condos, shopping 
malls and freeways, leash laws have been imposed by litigation-conscious public 
officials over the last four decades. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles alone, a city of 3 million people that has 15,098 acres of 
recreation land in 350 parks, only four acres so far have been set aside for 
people with dogs, pet owners say. Santa Monica's dog run adds only one-ninth of 
an acre to that total. 
</P>
<P>
But that does not equal discrimination, Hermosa Beach City Councilman Chuck 
Sheldon insists heatedly. He also terms "ludicrous" dog owners' claims that 
since they, too, are taxpayers, they deserve as much consideration in park 
planning as Little Leaguers, swimmers, archers, bowlers and others. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot fathom the use of the word discrimination about requiring a dog to be 
leashed," said Sheldon, a dog owner who nonetheless voted to extend the city's 
leash law to a 21-acre strip of green along railroad tracks, where owners 
historically had taken their dogs to run. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see (that) a dog owner getting some prurient unique pleasure in 
watching their dog run free (compares with the enjoyment) a Little League or 
Pop Warner (football) player gets . . . out of parks," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon noted that since all Hermosa Beach taxpayers are footing the 
$7.5-million bill for acquiring the 3-mile-long park, "It seems to me that (it) 
should be for the benefit and use of all the citizens." 
</P>
<P>
"To have relegated (it) to dogs off leash would have diminished usage . . . to 
dog owners (who) are a substantial minority of Hermosa Beach citizens," he 
said. "There are only 1,000 dog licenses in the city and about 20,000 people." 
</P>
<P>
There as elsewhere, those who oppose relaxing leash laws in parks say dogs, 
especially large or aggressive ones, can frighten children and be a nuisance to 
joggers and bicyclists. Inevitably, too, the discussion turns to the piles of 
droppings that dogs often leave behind. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, opponents who sought to end Laurel Canyon off-leash rules arrived at 
a hearing of the Los Angeles Recreation and Parks Commission bearing 35 pounds 
of the stuff, which they claimed to have gathered at the park. It was proof, 
they said, that ParkWatch members were not living up to their promise to clean 
up after less diligent dog owners. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners ordered them to leave with the offending sackful. 
</P>
<P>
ParkWatch's Purse, a 77-year-old self-described "activist" for a variety of 
causes, said dog owners simply need education, which her group's 1,500 active 
members are more than willing to provide. 
</P>
<P>
At Laurel Canyon Park, those who don't pick up their dogs' droppings or rein in 
their pets' aggressive behavior are shown proper methods. If they still don't 
observe the rules, they are shamed into complying or ostracized. 
</P>
<P>
Just to make sure, though, a ParkWatch volunteer can be seen circling the 
four-acre park just below Mulholland Drive with an industrial grade scooper and 
sack. The group also funds 24-hour security patrols at a cost of $1,500 a year. 
</P>
<P>
For Jennifer Wolch, a professor at USC's School of Urban Planning, parks such 
as Laurel Canyon show that dog owners as a social group have needs that were 
not designed to be met in an urban area. And, she added, maybe it is time for 
city planners to take their needs into account. 
</P>
<P>
"Playing with your dog may not be a recognized sport, but it certainly is a 
popular pastime," she said. "A lot of people don't have kids, they have dogs. 
And spending time with their dogs and letting their dogs play in an 
unrestricted area is important."

COMPTON MAN HELD IN DEATH OF NIECE, 6 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<P>
A Compton gardener was being held without bail Sunday for allegedly beating his 
6-year-old niece to death with a board and a plastic pipe. 
</P>
<P>
Loyal McGinty, 55, was arrested on suspicion of murder Saturday after taking 
the girl to Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center, said Sgt. Ramon Allen 
of the Compton Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
The child, who was not immediately identified by name, died Saturday night "as 
a result of being physically abused," Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
Homicide detectives were investigating reports that the beating began when the 
child failed to correctly answer a question. 
</P>
<P>
The girl had been living the last four months at McGinty's residence in the 300 
block of West Cedar Street, where she had moved with her sister and two 
brothers after the death of their mother, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Police added that the victim's 10-year-old brother had difficulty walking and 
had recently been treated for alleged physical abuse. 
</P>
<P>
McGinty's relatives could not be reached for comment Sunday, but neighbors 
expressed shock at hearing of the girl's death. 
</P>

They described McGinty as a quiet, bearded man who occasionally trimmed their 
lawns and gave friends bags of oranges and lemons from his back yard trees. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe it, he's not that kind of man," next-door neighbor Arturo 
Casares said, shaking his head. "He doesn't drink. He doesn't smoke. Every time 
you see him he's working on his lawn." 
</P>
<P>
Casares said McGinty told him several months ago that his sister-in-law had 
passed away and that he was going to be taking care of her children. Casares' 
8-year-old daughter, Rosemary, recalled playing with the girl on the McGintys' 
front lawn. 
</P>
<P>
"We rode bikes, played hide-and-seek," she said, but could not remember her 
name. 
</P>
<P>
Other neighbors knew less about the family, but all agreed they were friendly. 
</P>
<P>
"They're real quiet," said Tonya Smith, who lives across the street. 
</P>
<P>
McGinty moved into the neighborhood with his wife and three children about six 
years ago, and worked as a gardener in Palos Verdes, Casares said. McGinty, who 
cut the grass for Casares several times, would spend hours tending his own 
garden.

Older people who take one variety of commonly used blood pressure pills called 
diuretics may reduce their risk of hip fractures by one-third, according to a 
study. The researchers found that people over 65 who used the type of diuretics 
known as thiazides appeared to suffer significantly fewer broken hips than 
nonusers. 
</P>
<P>
They said that if the medicines work the way they believe, up to 21,600 hip 
fractures might be avoided annually. However, they cautioned that more study 
will be needed before the drugs could be prescribed solely to prevent 
fractures. They said experts will have to be sure that the benefits of this 
treatment outweigh the potential hazards. 
</P>
<P>
Experts have long known that thiazides can prevent the body from losing 
calcium. However, the medicines can also have unwanted side effects, including 
potassium deficiency and high cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
The study, directed by Dr. Andrea Z. LaCroix of the Group Health Cooperative of 
Puget Sound, Wash., was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

SCIENTISTS PRODUCE SICKLE CELL IN MICE FOR FIRST TIME

Although the genetic defect that causes sickle cell disease has been known for 
more than 30 years, researchers have not been able to develop an effective 
therapy for the disease, which strikes one in 400 blacks born in the United 
States. When the oxygen content of blood from individuals with the disease 
falls below normal levels, as from exercise, red blood cells become deformed 
and impair circulation, causing damage to organs. 
</P>
<P>
One problem in developing potential therapies is that researchers had never 
been able to produce the disease in animals to provide a testing ground. 
Molecular biologists from the Universities of Alabama, Pennsylvania and 
Washington reported last week in Science, however, that they used genetic 
engineering to produce mice with sickle cell disease. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers inserted the defective human gene for hemoglobin (the 
oxygen-carrying component of red blood cells) into mice, where the gene 
produced human hemoglobin. These animals were then cross-bred with mice who 
normally produce inadequate quantities of mouse hemoglobin. 
</P>
<P>
More than 90% of the red blood cells in the resultant mice contained the 
defective hemoglobin, and these cells sickle when their oxygen content is 
reduced. The researchers are studying the long-term effects of such sickling in 
the animals.

MEDICAL SCHOOL MALADY: SYSTEMATIC ABUSE OF STUDENTS 
</P>

appear in the Science/Medicine pages every other week. Konner holds a Ph.D. in

"Can I abuse you?" 
</P>
<P>
These were the first words spoken to me by my house officer -- the intern 
supervising my hospital training during a key part of my third year of medical 
school. (I was a few years older, and she was quite attractive, but here there 
was no hint of sexual innuendo.) The "abuse" that day was typical 
medical-student "scut-work": drawing blood, replacing intravenous lines, 
chasing around the hospital with various samples and fluids. 
</P>
<P>
So far, so good. All this was part of my education -- it's what medical 
students do to earn their stripes, a quid pro quo for knowledge gained, a 
honing of skills, a way of feeling not quite so useless -- or worse, burdensome 
-- in the dramatic and fast-moving hospital setting. I accepted it. I even felt 
happy that she could joke over the word abuse, thinking that this meant that no 
real abuse would occur. 
</P>
<P>
How wrong I was. For some reason she had it in for me. She routinely kept me up 
after all my work was completed -- at 3 or 4 in the morning, on call nights -- 
just to make irrelevant comments on my hospital notes, which for eight months 
other house officers had found excellent. She humiliated me one morning because 
I had respectfully asked a senior physician to help me understand better why 
one of the patients had unexpectedly died; claiming that my question implied a 
criticism of the doctor's competence (untrue), she read me the riot act in the 
middle of a busy nursing station. 
</P>
<P>
In the worst episode, she ordered me to administer intravenous Adriamycin -- a 
powerful and toxic anti-cancer drug -- to a man with lung cancer, claiming that 
we had "talked about" the procedure. Even if true (it wasn't), I -- a 
third-year medical student -- had no business doing the injection on the basis 
of a talk; fortunately an alert nurse stopped me from making a bad mistake. My 
intern yelled at me on the phone, then came down herself, yelled at me some 
more, and did the injection herself; incompletely, it turned out, since the man 
suffered serious damage to his arm from leakage of the drug. 
</P>
<P>
She was not unique. I once saw a new intern subjected to such relentless verbal 
abuse, during a gallbladder operation by a senior house officer, that the 
intern cut an artery and endangered the patient's life. Since the same intern 
was perfectly calm and competent with other teachers in the operating room, it 
was clear to me that the abuser was to blame, not the hapless underling 
anxiously holding the knife. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, right around the same time I was having these dismal experiences, 
the first serious studies of verbal and other abuse of medical students were 
getting under way. Two more recent studies published in the Journal of the 
American Medical Assn. provide evidence that what I experienced is more the 
rule than the exception, and its consequences may affect everyone who ever sees 
a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
One study surveyed a third-year medical school class (the first year of 
hospital training). Of the 75 students responding to the questionnaire, 85% 
reported widespread verbal abuse, 47% psychological mistreatment such as unfair 
threats, 44% exposure to unnecessary medical risk and 16% physical abuse. 
Sixty-seven percent felt that these experiences had adversely affected their 
emotional health, and 37% had considered dropping out of medicine as a result. 
Sexual harassment of women was extremely common (sexist slurs, 81%, sexual 
advances, 55%) but harassment in general cut across lines of sex, age and race. 
One male student stated that he had been kicked in the groin by an attending 
physician and required medical attention for this injury. 
</P>
<P>
The second study, led by Henry Silver, a University of Colorado physician who 
pioneered such research in the early '80s, surveyed students at all four 
year-levels of a different medical school. The findings of this independent 
study were remarkably similar to the first, conducted under the auspices of the 
American Medical Assn. By the senior year, 80% of students reported having been 
abused in one way or another, and of those two-thirds found the episode of 
"major importance and very upsetting." One-sixth felt the episode would always 
affect them. 
</P>
<P>
Silver has also contributed an interesting analogy: Just as abused children 
often grow up to abuse their own children -- and other people generally -- so 
medical students become house officers who abuse up-and-coming medical students 
-- and, frequently, patients. 
</P>
<P>
Medical students are not children, and they are not especially vulnerable -- 
they have been through tough premedical training. Nevertheless they can be 
damaged. 
</P>
<P>
I personally place more emphasis on the structure of training programs for 
house officers. 
</P>
<P>
People like my intern are under so much stress -- sleeplessness, too many 
patients, information overload, humiliation by their superiors -- that they 
become hard and bitter and pass on the stress. Current reforms in the 
scheduling of house officer training will, I predict, do more to reduce abuse 
of medical students than any change within medical school itself.

PRENATAL TEST FOR STEROID THERAPY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A USC geneticist has developed a prenatal test that should be able to determine 
which babies with respiratory distress syndrome will respond to treatment with 
steroids, thereby making it easier for physicians to determine the proper 
treatment for them. Respiratory distress syndrome, characterized by immature 
development of the lungs, strikes one in five premature infants and can be 
life-threatening. 
</P>
<P>
Conventional treatment of the syndrome involves using corticosteroids, which 
promote maturation of the lung. But 20% of babies with the syndrome do not 
respond to the drug. These infants are exposed to the side effects of 
corticosteroids without the benefits, and effective treatment is delayed. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Melnick reported last week in the American Journal of Medical Genetics 
that premature mice that do not respond to steroid therapy have a distinctive 
genetic pattern that can be recognized by prenatal screening. Because humans 
have a similar pattern, the test should work for them as well. Clinical trials 
could begin within a year.

John McEnroe, who became the first player in 22 years to get kicked out of a 
Grand Slam event when he was expelled from the Australian Open, says some 
players get away with swearing on court because they don't do it in English. 
</P>
<P>
"I need my attitude to improve," McEnroe acknowledged. "I let outside 
distractions get to me. There are other players who handle it better, like the 
Swedes. You can drop an atom bomb next to them and they barely change their 
expressions." 
</P>
<P>
However, the Swedes aren't always models of decorum, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"(Mikhal) Pernfors was screaming in the match, but in Swedish it sounds funny. 
But I know what . . . is in Swedish and I know he said it several times in the 
match. 
</P>
<P>
"I think if the officials are going to do this to me, they are going to 
eventually have to get a fleet of interpreters and everything any player says 
he's going to be liable for. Otherwise they've got to ease up."

Trivia time: Which four cities have populations smaller than the seating 
capacities of the NBA arenas located in them?

<P>
Dream come true: Ken Rudolph, a backup catcher who had a .213 career batting 
average in the majors, hit a two-run double in the bottom of the seventh to 
give the 1969 Chicago Cubs a 3-2 victory over the 1969 Baltimore Orioles in 
Sunday's fifth annual Dream Game at Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
Said Rudolph: "I haven't had a game-winning hit for about 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
Add dreams: Rony Seikaly, center for the Miami Heat, said after a 126-91 
victory over the Clippers Friday night: "We felt like the Lakers for the night. 
Tomorrow morning we'll be the Heat again, but tonight we can feel like the 
Lakers." 
</P>
<P>
Add NBA: Moses Malone of the Atlanta Hawks on not making the NBA all-star team 
for the first time since 1977: "It's OK. I'll always be number one to myself. 
The Legend just won't be there. I guess I'll just go home and watch my own 
videos." 
</P>
<P>
Last add NBA: Seven-foot Boston Celtic center Robert Parish, on meeting 7-7 
Manute Bol: "The first time I met him was a in a nightclub in Boston. Some guy 
tapped me on the shoulder, and I turned around. I was looking into his chest. 
That doesn't happen to me too often."

COLLEGE BASKETBALL: BO KIMBLE SCORES 50 POINTS TO LEAD THE LIONS' 157-115 
VICTORY OVER USF.

What letdown? 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who thought Loyola Marymount might be down after losing at Louisiana 
State on Saturday, flying home late Saturday night and playing the University 
of San Francisco on Sunday, think again. 
</P>
<P>
The responded with another record-breaking performance while thrashing the 
Dons, 157-115. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions' second conference record in four nights -- breaking their still-warm 
mark of 150 scored Thursday against St. Mary's -- raised them to 17-4 for the 
season and 8-0 in the West Coast Conference. USF, hoping to catch the Lions 
flat, fell to 7-14 and 3-5. 
</P>
<P>
The latest scoring explosion gave the Lions 448 points in three games in four 
days (a 149.3 average). In the three games, 830 total points were scored. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was paced by Bo Kimble's 50 points -- his fourth 50-point game this 
season, 30 points and 13 rebounds from Hank Gathers, 23 points by Jeff Fryer -- 
18 in the second half -- and 19 points by Terrell Lowery. 
</P>
<P>
Kimble hit all 17 of his free throws, also a WCC record. The Lions forced 40 
turnovers and hit 44 of 56 free throws (both WCC records) as well as 59% of 
their shots from the floor. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a good test of a team," Lions Coach Paul Westhead said. "You can have 
a grueling day and come back and act like you've been off for a week. It's more 
a tribute of our team wanting to show a hard, tough loss would not have any 
negative effect. I mentioned (to the team) that I thought it was important to 
play sharp." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Westhead said, after losing in overtime to LSU Saturday, 148-141, he 
didn't mind playing back-to-back. "Winners smile, losers say deal," Westhead 
said. "Heck, I like playing the next day." 
</P>
<P>
Guard Shawn Sykes led the Dons with 32 points and forward Joel DeBortoli added 
29. Both had 23 at halftime as USF stayed close by hitting 11 of 13 
three-pointers before the break. 
</P>
<P>
Kimble scored 11 of Loyola's first 13 points and the Lions pulled away to a 
29-17 lead. But USF went to the three-pointer to cut the lead to two points. 
Sykes hit most of his seven first-half triples early as the Dons pulled to 
within 45-43. 
</P>
<P>
After the Lions rebuilt a six-point lead, DeBortoli warmed up, hitting four 
three-pointers in the latter part of the half, and USF again pulled to within a 
basket, 54-52. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola answered with a 16-5 run to build a 13-point lead and was ahead, 72-63, 
at the half.

"Strange how all these L.A. players hurt their legs, isn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, doctor." 
</P>
<P>
"What do you suppose causes it?" 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know. Maybe they don't pump enough air into their tennis shoes." 
</P>
<P>
"Hmmm." 
</P>
<P>
"Or maybe they don't do enough walking. These Los Angeles people drive 
everywhere, you know." 
</P>
<P>
"You may have something there." 
</P>
<P>
"The Clippers shouldn't have shoe contracts. They should have cane contracts." 
</P>
<P>
"True." 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, these guys really take it on the shins." 
</P>
<P>
"How are the Clippers doing, by the way?" 
</P>
<P>
"They're showing a lot of heart." 
</P>
<P>
"Well, they'll probably break that before the season's over." 
</P>
<P>
"They've invented a new lineup -- the No-Guard offense." 
</P>
<P>
"Who brings the ball up?" 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody. After every opponent's basket, the Clipper coach calls a timeout. That 
way they get the ball at mid-court." 
</P>
<P>
"Very clever." 
</P>
<P>
"The Clippers are thinking about starting five 7-footers. The Quintuple 
Towers." 
</P>
<P>
"Might just work." 
</P>
<P>
"Or, sometimes they use David Rivers." 
</P>
<P>
"David Rivers? Didn't he used to play for the Lakers?" 
</P>
<P>
"Not so you'd know it." 
</P>
<P>
"How about trading for a guard?" 
</P>
<P>
"Funny you should mention that. Elgin Baylor just called me. He's about to 
trade for a guy, but first he wants us to do something for him." 
</P>
<P>
"Namely?" 
</P>
<P>
"He wants us to X-ray the guy's legs." 
</P>
<P>
"I see." 
</P>
<P>
"Then he wants us to make the guy run 82 simulated NBA games on a treadmill." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't blame him." 
</P>
<P>
"Then he wants us to do an arthroscopic exam, a total leg massage, a blood 
transfusion, a cartilage transplant, an athlete's foot inspection, and then 
soak the guy's legs for four hours in boiling Perrier with lime." 
</P>
<P>
"OK." 
</P>
<P>
"Then he wants us to telephone every living relative of the guy and ask them if 
they have any history of leg problems." 
</P>
<P>
"Will do." 
</P>
<P>
"Then he wants us to strike the guy's knee with a hammer, every 10 minutes."

"To check his reflexes?" 
</P>
<P>
"No. To check the hammer." 
</P>

"Yes. He wants to know if there's anything we can do to guarantee a minor leg 
injury, and not another one that's going to take a year to heal." 
</P>
<P>
"No. Tell Mr. Baylor I'm sorry, but all I can do is make a suggestion." 
</P>
<P>
"What?" 
</P>
<P>
"Tell him to trade every healthy body he has, before it's too late." 
</P>
<P>
"You think so?" 
</P>
<P>
"How about that Charles Smith person? Are his legs OK?" 
</P>
<P>
"Far as I know." 
</P>
<P>
"Then get Elgin on the phone and tell him to trade that man, immediately!" 
</P>
<P>
"Really?" 
</P>
<P>
"Definitely. The man is afflicted with Clipper Syndrome. It's only a matter of 
time." 
</P>
<P>
"What should he trade Smith for?" 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody. Anything. Trade him for Ralph Sampson. His legs already are shot. 
It'll save the Clippers a lot of time and trouble." 
</P>
<P>
"What about Danny Ainge or Jeff Malone?" 
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely not! I have examined the legs of Mr. Ainge and Mr. Malone, and they 
are perfect! Don't you dare trade them to the Clippers! These men have families 
to think about." 
</P>
<P>
"They're probably insured." 
</P>
<P>
"Are you kidding? No insurance company in America will write a policy on a 
Clipper today. They've already paid off a fortune to these people. It's called 
dribble indemnity." 
</P>
<P>
"I know what you mean. Marques Johnson, Norm Nixon, Derek Smith, Manning, 
Harper, Grant . . . the Clippers could have won three world championships by 
now, if they played wheelchair basketball." 
</P>
<P>
"Don't be cruel." 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe we should just put them out of their misery." 
</P>
<P>
"How do you mean?" 
</P>
<P>
"They shoot Clippers, don't they?" 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, well. Maybe the All-Star break will help them heal up." 
</P>
<P>
"Don't say 'break' around the Clippers. Besides, there's only one thing that 
could help that team." 
</P>
<P>
"What's that?" 
</P>
<P>
"If the All-Star break lasted two years."

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN MALAMUD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
His rival jockeys wished him well. The public bet him down to 3-5. The track 
announcer rooted him home. But nobody let Bill Shoemaker win the fifth race 
Saturday and that says something about the class and integrity of the sport at 
Santa Anita . . . 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Eddie Delahoussaye and Exemplary Leader and Fernando Toro and Happy 
Toss came flying on the inside, Oraibi and Corey Black came roaring on the 
outside, and Shoemaker and Patchy Groundfog finished out of the money. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Before the race, New York Times racing columnist Steven Crist wrote, "Does 
anyone really believe that the other jockeys in the Legend's Last Ride . . . 
will fulfill their legal requirement to put forth their best effort to win?". . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Steven, anyone who regularly watches the world's greatest jockey colony 
compete in Southern California believed so. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Doing the honors on ABC-TV, Dave Johnson varied his usual call by shouting, 
"And down the stretch he comes!" . . . 
</P>
<P>
This was the first and only time in his career that Shoe was cheered after 
finishing out of the money on a 3-5 shot. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"That was fun," said Julio Canani, trainer of Patchy Groundfog, once the 
commotion had died down. "A lot of fun. No regrets." You got the feeling that 
putting Shoe's leg up on his last mount was as big a thrill for Canani as 
winning the Big 'Cap with Martial Law last year. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Something is wrong with the system when Pascual Perez gets paid more money to 
play baseball than Bo Jackson. . . . 
</P>
<P>
If anything turns Bo into a full-time football player, maybe it will be his 
loss at the arbitration table. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Another robbery in Las Vegas. Challenger Troy Dorsey did most of the fighting, 
but IBF featherweight champion Jorge Paez got the decision Sunday. Paez is the 
pride of NBC, but even Dr. Ferdy Pacheco's card had him losing. . . . 
</P>
<P>
That was Jerry West, who follows boxing nearly as closely as basketball, 
sitting next to Jerry Buss ringside at the Forum-promoted fight. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Too bad the hype for the Macho Camacho-Vinny Pazienza bout was in such bad 
taste. The fight itself, won by Camacho on a 12-round decision Saturday, was 
exceptional. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Now that Gary Grant has joined Ron Harper on the sidelines, the Clippers should 
hold onto their two No. 1 draft choices for next season. Both their original 
and the one traded from Cleveland could be lottery selections. . . . 
</P>
<P>
How much do the Detroit Pistons really miss Rick Mahorn? With Mahorn in 
Philadelphia, James Edwards and Dennis Rodman play more. Edwards was 
particularly effective in the rout of Utah Sunday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
USC's victory over UCLA was the Trojans' biggest in years, but a lot more 
people would have seen it if game time had been moved a half-hour later to 
accommodate ESPN. Instead, it was shown on tape delay on Prime Ticket. Good 
break for Jim Harrick, bad break for George Raveling. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I'll never understand why teams ahead by three points in the final seconds 
don't commit a foul and take away the chance of a tying three-point shot. It 
cost Texas what should have been a victory over Arkansas Sunday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Peeler is becoming a marquee player for Missouri, which rose to No. 1 
in the ratings without any famous names. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Cheryl Miller, doing the commentary on the Texas-Arkansas game on ABC, showed 
she isn't bashful about expressing an opinion. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Poor George Allen is going to have to begin his Cal State Long Beach coaching 
career at Clemson in September because the 49ers have accepted a $250,000 
guarantee. . . . 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Padre first baseman Jack Clark says he's thinking about buying a top 
fuel dragster and driving when he retires. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Most college basketball play-by-play announcers sound the same to me. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The book of Jewish sports heroes will have to be enlarged after the singles 
victories by Jay Berger and Brad Gilbert for the United States over Mexico in 
the Davis Cup. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Runners from at least 15 nations will compete in the Times/Eagle Indoor Games 
Feb. 16 at the Forum, but the big one from Mexico got away. Arturo Barrios, who 
set a world record for 10,000 meters last summer, accepted a lucrative peso 
offer from Japan instead. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Mike Tyson will segue from defending his heavyweight title against Buster 
Douglas Saturday to appearing as referee of the Hulk Hogan-Randy Savage 
wrestling match on NBC Feb. 23. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Leave it to Lee Trevino to put some new life into the PGA Senior Tour. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Guess who we get to see in the next televised pro football game? None other 
than the Denver Broncos against the Chicago Bears in the Hall of Fame Game Aug. 
4 at Canton, Ohio.

George Perles, Michigan State football coach, demanded that a fund-raiser buy 
$2,500 in advertisements on Perles' television show to keep his seat on the 
team airplane, according to a published report. 
</P>
<P>
J.D. Anderson, a Grand Ledge, Mich., businessman, made the claim in letters to 
university officials, the Detroit News reported. Perles told the News that 
Anderson's claims were unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan State spokesman Terry Denbow said the school reviewed Anderson's 
allegations in January. 
</P>
<P>
"No violations of university, Big Ten or NCAA rules and regulations were 
found," Denbow said. "There couldn't be any reprimand when there's no 
wrongdoing."

Irving Fryar, a wide receiver for the New England Patriots, has acknowledged 
that he used cocaine while playing at the University of Nebraska, the Hartford 
Courant reported. 
</P>
<P>
Fryar also said he helped introduce Nebraska teammate Doug DuBose to the drug. 
Fryar's comments came in a story profiling DuBose, who went on to the NFL but 
is now out of the league because of a seven-year-old cocaine habit. 
</P>
<P>
Fryar, who claims to be drug-free, said of DuBose's situation: "That could so 
easily have been me."

More accustomed to preventing goals than scoring them, goalkeeper Kasey Keller 
missed a penalty kick that enabled Colombia to beat the United States, 2-1, 
Sunday for third place in the Marlboro Cup of soccer. 
</P>
<P>
Uruguay won the championship, 2-0, over Costa Rica in the second game at the 
Orange Bowl before a crowd of 15,231. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Coach Bob Gansler, who criticized his players for their lack of intensity 
in Friday's 2-0 loss to Costa Rica, called the game against Colombia 
"progress." Continuing to experiment, he started six new players and used two 
others in different positions. 
</P>
<P>
The United States and Colombia, each a qualifier for the World Cup this summer 
in Italy, were tied, 1-1, at the end of regulation, sending the game into a 
tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams made eight of their first 10 penalty kicks. But when Colombia's 11th 
player, Gildardo Gomez, sent his shot into the net over Keller's outstretched 
hands, the goalkeeper, the only U.S. player who had not taken a shot, turned 
offensive in an attempt to keep the score even. He failed when his shot hit the 
crossbar. 
</P>
<P>
Keller, a University of Portland junior who was making his first appearance for 
the national team, was more disappointed afterward because he was penalized in 
the first half for delay of game, a rarely made call. That gave Colombia's 
Alfonso Fajardo an indirect free kick from inside the penalty area, which he 
converted into a goal at 24:26. 
</P>
<P>
The United States scored 3:48 into the game on a shot by forward Eric Wynalda 
from 18 yards out after he beat an offside trap and fielded a pass from 
midfielder John Harkes. Wynalda, a University of San Diego junior from Westlake 
Village, also was making his first national team appearance.

BRITISH TRYING TO CLEAN UP THEIR ACT, AND SOCCER STADIUMS, TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If George Orwell's novel, "1984," had been about English soccer, it probably 
would have included a paragraph such as this: 
</P>
<P>
 Lord Justice Peter Taylor, in a 109-page report on fan violence commissioned 
by the British government, recommended that police and soccer authorities 
"experiment with electronic tagging of violent fans. Under the plan, hooligans 
would be barred from matches and police could keep track of their whereabouts 
with electronic tracers attached to their legs." 
</P>
<P>
 That, however, is not fiction. An excerpt from an Associated Press report, it 
is an example of the extremes to which the English are prepared to go to cure 
what Taylor termed a "blight" of violence. 
</P>
<P>
Extreme measures for extreme circumstances. Taylor's report was commissioned in 
the wake of last April's Hillsborough Stadium tragedy in Sheffield, England, 
where 95 fans were killed. 
</P>
<P>
That particular disaster has been blamed in part on overcrowding, a common 
occurrence at outmoded English soccer stadiums that pack thousands of fans into 
standing-room-only terrace sections. 
</P>
<P>
Most important among Taylor's 76 recommendations, English first and second 
division soccer teams would be required to eliminate the terraces and provide 
seats for all fans by 1994. All other teams, including some in rugby and 
cricket leagues, would have a 1999 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Government officials said they will comply with the report, which was submitted 
this week. Home Secretary David Waddington went even further in comments to the 
House of Commons, calling on clubs to modernize their stadiums. "Squalid 
conditions encourage squalid behavior," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The only resistance to the recommendations so far has come from the clubs. They 
estimate that the proposed renovations would cost a quarter of a billion 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
They will receive little sympathy from Taylor, who criticized the clubs for 
jeopardizing the fans' safety by allowing the "decay and dilapidation" of 
stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
Also blaming hooliganism and excessive drinking, he recommended new laws making 
it a criminal offense for fans to run onto the field, throw objects from the 
stands or shout obscene or racist chants. 
</P>
<P>
Performance-enhancing drugs regained their position on the front page of sports 
sections throughout much of the world this week when three athletes tested 
positive at the Commonwealth Games in Auckland, New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
It hardly comes as a surprise that the athletes were weightlifters, one from 
India and two from Wales. Although sprinter Ben Johnson received most of the 
notoriety for his tainted urine sample in Seoul, the majority of athletes who 
tested positive at the 1988 Olympic Games were weightlifters. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Pound of Canada, vice president of the International Olympic Committee, 
subsequently campaigned for an indefinite suspension of the sport from the 
Olympics. He received little support from other international sports leaders 
then and said this week that he does not expect increased support now. 
</P>
<P>
Weightlifting officials insist they have become more vigilant. Still, Richard 
Edmund, director of medical services for New Zealand's team at the Commonwealth 
Games, estimated that 80% of the world-class weightlifters use drugs. His 
estimates in track and field included 70% for field-event performers and 30% 
for sprinters. 
</P>
<P>
Add drugs: Dr. Howel Jones, medical adviser to the Commonwealth Games 
Federation, said many athletes have turned to the kidney hormone EPO, which 
stimulates the production of red blood cells and is believed to increase 
endurance and power. It cannot yet be detected. 
</P>
<P>
Last add drugs: Josef Odlozil, Czechoslovakia's silver medalist in the 1964 
Olympic 1,500 meters, said 80% of the Czech track and field team in the 1983 
World Championships at Helsinki was using drugs. He said it was supervised by 
team coaches, doctors and officials. 
</P>
<P>
Since Roger Kingdom's emergence as the world's best high hurdler, the event can 
hardly be considered artistic any more. To compete, Greg Foster, who met 
Kingdom for the first time this year at the Millrose Games Friday night in New 
York, has gained considerable upper-body strength through lifting weights. 
</P>
<P>
"People tell me that Roger looks terrible going over the hurdles," Foster said. 
"I'd be happy to look terrible going over the hurdles in 12-something." 
</P>
<P>
Foster broke his left arm in each of the last two years, but he said he is not 
considering retirement. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll know it's time to retire when I can no longer dunk a basketball 
backward," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the Millrose field was Renaldo Nehemiah, whose world record in the 
110-meter high hurdles of 12.93, set in 1981, stood until Kingdom ran 12.92 
last summer. 
</P>
<P>
Juventus of Turin, in fifth place in the Italian League of soccer, may save 
face in the Italian Cup. It beat AS Roma, 2-0, at Turin in the first leg of 
their home-and-home semifinal round. The other finalist may be Diego Maradona's 
division-leading Napoli, which played second-place AC Milan to a scoreless tie 
at Milan. Napoli and AC Milan, the world champion club team last season, will 
meet on Feb. 11 in league play and then play again in the Cup at Naples three 
days later. 
</P>
<P>
The United States, preparing for its first World Cup since 1950, has added East 
Germany to its exhibition schedule. After playing Hungary in Budapest on March 
20, the team will travel to East Berlin for a game March 28. Also on the 
schedule is a game Feb. 24 at Stanford against the Soviet Union. More than 
32,000 tickets have been sold. 
</P>
<P>
International Notes 
</P>
<P>
Dave Gavitt, president of USA Basketball, told the Dallas Morning News that he 
believes the coach of the 1992 Olympic team will come from the NBA. The Golden 
State Warriors' Don Nelson is the leading candidate, but San Antonio's Larry 
Brown and the Lakers' Pat Riley have also been mentioned. The selection may be 
made in May. . . . East Germany has dominated the world in speed skating, but 
national coach Rainer Mund said that will change within five years after 
massive government support and funding for the sport are withdrawn. Mund said 
that he might emigrate. 
</P>
<P>
On-and-off talks between North and South Korea about fielding a joint team in 
this year's Asian Games at Beijing are off again. . . . The United States will 
send a boxing team to Seoul next week for dual bouts against the South Koreans. 
It will be the first time U.S. boxers have been there since their controversial 
performance in the 1988 Olympics. Their coaches reportedly are already studying 
bus schedules. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto's City Council voted, 12-5, to continue with its bid for the 1996 
Summer Olympics. The opposition came from a group known as "Bread, Not 
Circuses." . . . In support of the joint East-West Berlin bid for the Olympics 
in 2000 or 2004, the West German cities of Hamburg, Frankfurt and Stuttgart, 
plus the Ruhr region, have halted their campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
The ashes of Canadian swimmer Victor Davis, killed when a car hit him last 
November in Montreal, were spread into the sea by his former teammates at the 
Commonwealth Games. . . . The French Press Agency reports that Australian 
swimmers, to celebrate the end of the Commonwealth Games, "booked a dice with 
danger by going bungee jumping."

cruised behind the 16 points of reserve Lyssa McBride to their 46th consecutive 
regular-season home victory Sunday night, an 85-44 rout of USC. 
</P>
<P>
Texas improved to 14-3, and USC dropped to 4-13. 
</P>
<P>
It was the worst loss of the season for the Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
Texas center Cinietra Henderson added 12 points and seven rebounds. Vicki Hall, 
Texas' leading scorer with a 16.5 average, was held to seven. 
</P>
<P>
Molly Wampler led USC with 14 points and nine rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
USC didn't get into double figures until the 3:09 mark of the first half before 
the crowd of 8,423.

Nance Frank's attention was riveted, watching the ESPN videotape of the wild 
second leg of the Whitbread Round the World race. She immediately recognized 
all the boats and all the sailors and related to their adventures with 
gale-force winds, icebergs, whales, snowball fights on deck and broken bones 
and spars. 
</P>
<P>
"What they're doing is exactly what we wanted to do," Frank said. 
</P>
<P>
Frank, skipper of the aborted U.S. Women's Challenge, was passing through Los 
Angeles with project director Rob Stephens to do a promotional video and 
solicit sponsors for the 1993-94 Whitbread, but it was hard to keep her mind 
off the current race. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now they're in New Zealand, which is the most exciting stop in the 
race," she said. "If anything, I've got more determination to do this race, and 
(American) companies will see what a bonanza it is." 
</P>
<P>
The 23 boats, about halfway along in the 32,932-nautical mile race, started the 
fourth, 6,255-nautical mile leg from Auckland to Punta Del Este, Uruguay on 
Sunday. Frank and her nine-person U.S. Women's Challenge crew were left behind 
when it started on Sept. 2 in England. They would have been the only American 
entry. 
</P>
<P>
"We were completely ready to race," she said. "Everybody wanted us to race. We 
were at the starting line. All we needed was the money." 
</P>
<P>
Frank, 39, is a former schoolteacher from Key West, Fla. She had chartered a 
boat but the owner wanted full payment before the start. In the past few days 
-- even the last hours -- before the start, she hung around the press room to 
be close to the phones to take calls from potential backers. 
</P>
<P>
When the last hope called back to say no, she said, "I wanted to cry but I 
couldn't do it there. Where to do it? Down at the boat. But when I got down 
there, people were all over." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, they all had a good cry at the starting line, watching the rest of the 
fleet sail away. 
</P>
<P>
The race is a major sporting event -- a nine-month Super Bowl -- for most of 
the other countries involved, but Frank got far more attention in the foreign 
press than at home. Europeans were especially intrigued about the prospect of 
the first two all-women boats to compete -- the other being England's Maiden, 
with skipper Tracy Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
"Think of the race we would have had," Frank said. "In England I was doing 25 
or 30 interviews a day -- in French, Spanish, Portuguese and German." 
</P>
<P>
Frank remains frustrated that American companies wouldn't back an American 
entry. The Soviet Union's entry also was touch and go until the last moment. 
</P>
<P>
"The BBC did a commentary that here were the two superpowers just struggling to 
get to the line, and here's little New Zealand with everything together," Frank 
said. 
</P>
<P>
New Zealand's two entries -- Steinlager 2 and Fisher &amp; Paykel -- are 
currently first and third. 
</P>
<P>
Frank would have been racing Edwards, the current leader, in the Division D 
handicap class. Next time she intends to compete in the all-out maxi class and 
will need a crew of 16. 
</P>
<P>
"The crew was never a problem," she said. "Money was the only problem. 
Ninety-five percent of sailors are men, and if the sport is to grow, they have 
to get the other people involved. Women have paid their dues in the last 20 
years. The '90s will be the decade of women. The company that enables us to do 
this will be a leader in marketing." 
</P>
<P>
It's a good pitch, and Frank has a punch line, too. 
</P>
<P>
"Europeans have been sponsoring sailing for 500 years," she said. "Columbus was 
the first sponsored sailor. (Queen) Isabella's name is known by everybody on 
the planet. Anyone who sponsors us will have just as much notoriety." 
</P>
<P>
Rod Davis, the first sailor to win three Congressional Cups, won't defend his 
title at Long Beach March 14-17 because he can't afford to fly himself and a 
six-man crew from Auckland. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, an American originally from Coronado, has been living in New Zealand 
since the 1986-87 America's Cup races and working for Michael Fay's syndicate. 
Fay paid the way for Davis and his crew to last year's Congressional, but has 
temporarily laid off his sailing personnel pending resolution of the 
long-running America's Cup court case. 
</P>
<P>
Robbie Haines, for whom Davis crewed when they won a Soling gold medal in the 
'84 Olympics, will take his place. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Davis, the third-ranked match-racing sailor in the world, stayed 
sharp Jan. 27-28 by skippering a New Zealand crew to victory over Australia's 
Peter Gilmour and Iain Murray in the second ANZ Australia Day 12-Meter 
Challenge at Sydney, sailing Kookaburra II and III. Davis, sponsored by BMW 
instead of Fay, won the last two races to claim the series, 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
Davis didn't pass up the chance to needle Dennis Conner, who called him 
Benedict Davis when Davis went to work for the Kiwis. Conner ran aground trying 
to beat Gilmour and Murray a year ago "and was sent home with his tail between 
his legs," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
Sailing Notes 
</P>
<P>
There was a third, somewhat overlooked fatality related to the Whitbread Round 
the World race. Besides the Soviet skipper who hanged himself during the first 
stopover at Punta Del Este, Uruguay, and the British crewman who went overboard 
in the Southern Ocean, a Swedish crewman was killed in a motorcycle accident in 
Uruguay. Janne Gustavsson from The Card ran head-on into another motorcycle 
ridden by Guy Schalkens of Belgium, who suffered only bruises and shock. 
Gustavsson wasn't wearing a helmet, a report said. . . . Meanwhile, things 
continue to go poorly for the Soviets. Short of money and haunted by the 
suicide of their skipper, the crewmen of the Fazisi are hoping sales of raffle 
tickets in Auckland on a luxury BMW will keep them in the race. The car was 
donated by a New Zealand company. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California Yachting Assn. will conduct a seminar on regatta 
sponsorship -- in other words, how to get somebody to pay for your event -- 
Saturday, Feb. 24, at the Hyatt Edgewater in Long Beach. Speakers will include 
Bruce Golison, founder of the successful Audi/North Race Week (June 22-24 at 
Long Beach), and Tom Ehman, executive vice president of San Diego's America's 
Cup Organizing Committee. A fee of $20 includes lunch. Information: (213) 
433-7426. . . . Two important events will overlap in April, the 30th annual 
Olympic Classes Regatta at the Alamitos Bay Yacht Club April 6-8 and the 
biennial U.S. Yacht Club Challenge at Newport Beach April 4-7. 
</P>
<P>
Marc Pajot, who sailed the 12-meter French Kiss at Fremantle in 1987, has 
launched the first of the new America's Cup boats, which are larger, lighter 
and faster than the obsolete 12s. The boat, dubbed F1, is designated as an 
experimental-development model and itself may be obsolete before the '92 
competition.

TREVINO OVERCOMES A SEVEN-SHOT DEFICIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lee Trevino, playing in his second Senior PGA Tour event, made up seven strokes 
on the final nine holes Sunday to win the Royal Caribbean Classic at Key 
Biscayne, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Trevino, whose share of the $400,000 purse was $60,000, trailed Jim Dent by 
five strokes with three holes left but birdied Nos. 16 and 17 and parred 18. 
Dent bogeyed 16 and 17 and double-bogeyed 18 to finish tied for second, a shot 
back. 
</P>
<P>
"I know how upset Jim must be," Trevino said. "I never should have won this 
golf tournament." 
</P>
<P>
Trevino's final-round 68 gave him a 54-hole total of 206, seven-under-par. 
Dent, who shot a 68 on Saturday and started the final round eight under par, 
ballooned to a 73 and finished at 207, tied with Butch Baird, who shot a 67. 
Dent and Baird each won $32,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I got a little careless with a five-shot lead, but Lee didn't sneak up on me," 
Dent said. "I just ran out of gas on the last three holes. Lee played well and 
I went to sleep." 
</P>
<P>
Trevino, who started the final round bogeying two of the first three holes, 
shot a 36 over the front nine and trailed Dent by seven strokes. Trevino 
birdied Nos. 10 and 11 to pick up two strokes over the next six holes, but he 
said he didn't think he had a chance to win going to No. 16. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking at Butch and just hoping I can catch him and finish second," 
Trevino said. "I never in my wildest dreams thought I'd catch Jim." 
</P>
<P>
Trevino said he finally started thinking he had a chance to win when Dent drove 
his ball into the water on No. 18 and Trevino put his drive straight down the 
fairway to within 169 yards of the pin. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Bradley birdied the first hole of a playoff with Dale Eggeling to overcome 
the biggest collapse of her career and win a $300,000 LPGA tournament at Lake 
Worth, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley made a 25-foot putt to save par on the last hole of regulation to force 
the playoff. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley went without a bogey for 44 holes and led by 11 strokes before her game 
fell apart midway through the third round. She shot four-over-par 76 and blew a 
five-stroke advantage Sunday, but earned the $45,000 first-place check because 
she was at her best with the tournament on the line. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley tied Eggeling with a four-day total of seven-under-par 281 with the 
dramatic par-saving putt after driving into a bunker on No. 18. They returned 
to the 18th tee for the playoff, and Bradley hit her second shot 18 feet from 
the pin before clinching her 24th career victory. 
</P>
<P>
Eggeling, who shot three-under-par 69 and made up seven shots on Bradley, 
rolled a 25-foot putt four feet past the cup on the playoff hole. 
</P>
<P>
The victory moved Bradley within six victories of qualifying for the Hall of 
Fame.

FOREMAN-TYSON BOUT FACING BIG HURDLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By EARL GUSTKEY

<TEXT>
<P>
Maybe if Jim Jeffries hadn't tried that ill-advised 1910 comeback at 35, 
against Jack Johnson, none of this would have happened. 
</P>
<P>
In the ensuing 80 years, most of the heavyweight champions -- George Foreman 
the most recent -- either fought too long or looked foolish in pipe-dream 
comebacks. Jeffries, the Los Angeles heavyweight champion in 1899-1905, was 
talked out of a five-year retirement by racists who insisted he knock the black 
champion, Jack Johnson, off his perch. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffries, made a 10-6 favorite by gamblers, was beaten savagely by Johnson, who 
himself remained too long in the spotlight. At 37, he lost his title to Jess 
Willard in 1915. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Dempsey was inactive for 27 months in the 1920s, then was beaten 
decisively twice by Gene Tunney. Joe Louis, Max Schmeling, Floyd Patterson, 
Sonny Liston, Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier all fought years past their prime, 
which brings us to Foreman. 
</P>
<P>
Foreman, because he starched an over-the-hill heavyweight who wasn't much in 
his prime, Gerry Cooney, is being showered with money offers. Word is that 
Steve Wynn, who recently gave the world Sugar Ray Leonard-Roberto Duran at his 
Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas, wanted Foreman to sign a three-fight deal that would 
include a Mike Tyson fight as the grand finale. Foreman turned him down, it's 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A Foreman-Tyson fight is based on an assumption bigger than Foreman's waistline 
-- that he can first defeat a top-10-ranked opponent, a species Foreman has 
carefully avoided in his 20-bout comeback. 
</P>
<P>
Wynn got Foreman on the phone after failing to bring middleweights Michael Nunn 
and Tommy Hearns together. 
</P>
<P>
Another possible roadblock to a Las Vegas Tyson-Foreman fight is that Donald 
Trump secured first-refusal rights to Tyson-Foreman when he bought the June 18 
Tyson-Evander Holyfield showdown for $12 million. 
</P>
<P>
If Foreman beats Jose Ribalta, Trevor Berbick or another top-10 boxer, then the 
prospect of Tyson-Foreman becomes only slightly less ludicrous than it is now. 
Until then, George Foreman remains as ill-equipped to fight Mike Tyson as he 
was when he began his comeback in 1987 after a 10-year retirement. 
</P>
<P>
And speaking of over-the-hill heavyweights, are you ready for Larry 
Holmes-Michael Spinks III? Santa Monica promoter Harold Smith wants to match 
the two ex-champions -- both of whom were flattened by Tyson -- in Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
Smith talked to Holmes about such a matchup not long ago in Easton, Pa., and a 
$3-million purse for Holmes was discussed. 
</P>
<P>
"They talked, and Larry told Harold: 'Show me the money, Harold, then we'll 
talk,' " said Richie Giachetti, one-time Holmes trainer. 
</P>
<P>
And that, boxing fans, remains the name of the game. Money, $65,000 to be 
exact, brought Jim Jeffries back, and it's what brought Foreman back. Foreman 
would make millions in a Tyson fight, but the outcome would be the same as 
Jeffries-Johnson, with a young champion looking down on a beaten, old champion. 
</P>
<P>
Boxing Notes 
</P>
<P>
According to Boxing Update newsletter, Roberto Duran aided U.S. troops during 
the Panama invasion. Duran is said to have encouraged Panamanians not to resist 
the Americans and also to have "loaned" one of his apartments to U.S. troops, 
who used it to watch the Papal Embassy, where Manuel Noriega took refuge. 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Lennon Jr., will be the ring announcer for the Mike Tyson-Buster Douglas 
fight in Tokyo next Saturday. Lennon, 31, is in his eighth year of introducing 
fighters. His father, now retired, did the same for decades, mostly at the 
Olympic Auditorium. . . . Richie Giachetti, once Larry Holmes' trainer, on 
Douglas: "He's got a better shot than (Tony) Tubbs. But if he gets whacked, 
he's gone." . . . A federal judge in New York ruled Wednesday that all foreign 
TV-rights money from the Tyson-Douglas bout be paid into a court fund and not 
to Tyson's estranged manager, Bill Cayton. A spokesman for Don King, Tyson's 
promoter, claimed that Cayton has withheld as much as $500,000 in foreign TV 
money from Tyson. King, meanwhile, has been sued for $8 million by promoter 
Murad Muhammad after the Tyson-Razor Ruddock bout at Edmonton, Canada, in 
November was "postponed" and then not rescheduled when Tyson became ill. 
</P>
<P>
Caesars Palace and promoter Bob Arum lost the Tommy Hearns-Michael Olijade 
middleweight fight they had tentatively set for April 26. That one will now 
open the new Taj Mahal Hotel in Atlantic City, N.J., on Showtime April 28. 
Arum, meanwhile, says George Foreman will "definitely" fight on an Arum show in 
April in Las Vegas, against an opponent to be named. As for the theory that 
Tyson-Foreman, should it occur at all, would wind up in Japan, Arum said: 
"George would resist that very strongly. He's a real patriot." On the same 
theme, Foreman told The Times a year ago: "Do we have to let the Japanese have 
everything? 
</P>
<P>
It's said that Steve Wynn offered Julio Cesar Chavez $4 million to fight Macho 
Camacho in Las Vegas. Camacho retained his World Boxing Organization junior 
welterweight title with a 12-round decision over Vinny Pazienza Saturday night. 
. . . Paul Banke, one-time Azusa amateur whiz, will get a second try at Daniel 
Zaragoza, the World Boxing Council super-bantamweight champion, in mid-March at 
the Forum. In June, Banke lost a unanimous decision to Zaragoza in his first 
title try. . . . March 14 is the 10th anniversary of the plane crash in Poland 
that killed 22 members of a U.S. amateur boxing delegation, including 14 
boxers. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Gonzales was to have met the winner of the recent WBC super-flyweight 
title fight in Seoul between Nana Konadu and Moon-Sung Kil, but he has been put 
on hold. In a controversial finish, the bout was stopped in the ninth round 
because of Kil's cuts, but Kil, not Konadu, was declared the 
"technical-decision" winner because he was ahead on all scorecards. If you find 
that hard to believe, you can imagine how Konadu and his corner reacted. 
Japanese reporter Joe Koizumi wrote afterward that the stoppage alone mystified 
nearly everyone, since Kil's cuts didn't seem all that bad. Whatever, WBC chief 
Jose Sulaiman, who was present, ordered a rematch as soon as possible. So, for 
Gonzales, who was promised the winner at the Forum, the wait goes on. In fact, 
he may give up on the super-fly title idea altogether and instead challenge WBC 
bantamweight champion Raul Perez. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Breland will defend his World Boxing Assn. welterweight title in London 
March 3 against Lloyd Honeyghan. . . . Unbeaten Virgil Hill will defend his WBA 
light-heavyweight title for the eighth time Feb. 25 in his hometown, Bismarck, 
N.D., against David Vedder. A victory by Hill would set up a possible HBO 
light-heavyweight unification tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Lennox Lewis, the 1988 Olympic super-heavyweight gold medalist, improved to 7-0 
as a pro with a second-round KO of Noel Quarless Wednesday in London. He will 
next meet African champion Proud Kilimanjaro. . . . Henry Woods, top 
welterweight of the 1930s, died in Yakima, Wash., Wednesday. Woods, 75, was 
once the California lightweight champion and lost a 1935 decision to Barney 
Ross in a world title bout. . . . Olympian lightweight Todd Foster of Great 
Falls, Mont., 10-0 as a pro, may fight on an NBC card soon and then be signed 
afterward to a multifight package by the network. 
</P>
<P>
Mando Ramos celebrates the 21st anniversary of his winning the world 
lightweight title from Teo Cruz at 20 on Feb. 18 at Local 9 Shipbuilders Hall 
in Wilmington. An amateur boxing show, dinner and film highlights of Ramos' 
boxing career are scheduled. Tickets are $25, with proceeds going to Boxing 
Against Alcohol and Drugs. Information: (213) 519-7555.

HEAVYWEIGHTS DOKES, DASCOLA HEADLINE FORUM CARD TONIGHT

<P>
Michael Dokes, who in 1982 scored the second-quickest knockout in the history 
of heavyweight title fights, takes on Jorge Dascola of Argentina tonight in a 
scheduled 12-round bout at the Forum. At stake will be Dokes' World Boxing 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Intercontinental heavyweight championship, a title that is not as massive as 
Dokes was during his last fight. 
</P>
<P>
Weighing 253 1/2 pounds during that Nov. 13 bout, Dokes struggled for seven 
rounds before knocking out Lionel Washington in the eighth round. 
</P>
<P>
Dokes will weigh considerably less for the bout against Dascola, who will be 
fighting for the first time outside of Argentina. Dascola, 28, is 14-2 with 
nine knockouts. 
</P>
<P>
Dokes, 31, is 40-2-2 with 26 knockouts. It will be his 13th fight since 
returning to the ring in 1987 after a long layoff caused by a cocaine 
addiction. His only loss during the comeback came in March of 1989 when he was 
stopped in the 10th round by Evander Holyfield. 
</P>
<P>
Dokes put his name in the record book eight years ago when he stopped Mike 
Weaver in just 63 seconds to capture the WBA championship. Only Jim Jeffries 
did it in less time. He knocked out Jack Finnegan in 55 seconds in 1900. 
</P>
<P>
In another bout tonight, Joaquin Velasquez (21-2-1, 16 knockouts) of the 
Dominican Republic fights Derrick Kelly (24-2-2, eight knockouts) of Los 
Angeles in a scheduled 10-round super welterweight match. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the card are the undefeated Ruelas brothers of Arleta. Gabriel, a 
junior lightweight, is 18-0 with 10 knockouts. Rafael, a featherweight, is 12-0 
with 10 knockouts. RICH TOSCHES

76ERS WIN 11TH IN ROW, 105-102 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Charles Barkley is no stranger to exaggeration, so it wasn't surprising that 
nobody paid attention early this season when he said the Philadelphia 76ers 
were a vastly improved team. 
</P>
<P>
After 31 games, the 76ers were only a game above .500, and Barkley's warnings 
continued to go unheeded by the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
All that has changed. 
</P>
<P>
Barkley was hampered by a pulled groin muscle and teammate Rick Mahorn was 
ejected in the third quarter of Sunday's game at Milwaukee, but the 76ers 
outlasted the Bucks, 105-102, to extend their winning streak to 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
A three-point play by Derek Smith with 25 seconds remaining capped the victory 
after Barkley, limping badly, who provided the spark earlier in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Barkley averaged 29 points in the first 10 games of the streak that has carried 
the 76ers into first place in the Atlantic Division. But he aggravated a groin 
injury in the first half and planned to sit out the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Then, with nine minutes left in the third quarter, referee Lee Jones ejected 
Mahorn. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't coming back," Barkley said, "but when Rick was tossed I had to help 
the team. I'm not going to play in the All-Star Game, though. I'm going to 
rest. I don't know about the Utah game tomorrow night." 
</P>
<P>
The 76ers opened an 11-point lead in the third quarter and Barkley scored 10 
points in the fourth quarter. He played the last 19 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"The guys took up the slack," Barkley said. "Everybody just chipped in. That's 
what a good team does." 
</P>
<P>
The 76ers had only a 98-96 lead when Smith made a dunk, was fouled and 
converted the free throw. The 76ers' Ron Anderson made four free throws in the 
last 12 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
After losing twice in the past three days to the 76ers, the Bucks are 
impressed. 
</P>
<P>
"They started out with a lot of new guys and now they're playing together," 
guard Jay Humphries said. "Charles is having an all-star year and they all can 
shoot. You have to give them credit." 
</P>
<P>
Portland 123, Phoenix 121 -- Kevin Duckworth scored seven of the Trail Blazers' 
last nine points at Portland to thwart a comeback by the Suns. 
</P>
<P>
The Suns trailed at halftime, 76-60, but fought back to take the lead, 101-96, 
with nine minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
Clyde Drexler, who had 33 points, and Duckworth rallied the Blazers. A jump 
shot by Duckworth put Portland ahead to stay with 2:10 left. 
</P>
<P>
Jerome Kersey added 28 points and 18 rebounds for Portland, which has won 12 in 
a row at home and trails the Lakers by half a game in the Pacific Division. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 115, Utah 83 -- Two weeks have made a big difference in the Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
After looking terrible in losing to the Lakers on Jan. 21, the Pistons turned 
in an impressive performance at Auburn Hills, Mich. They made the Jazz take 
forced shots and were unselfish on offense. 
</P>
<P>
By winning seven consecutive games since the loss to the Lakers, the Pistons 
have opened a four-game lead on the Chicago Bulls in the Central Division. 
</P>
<P>
In their past two road games the Jazz, tied with the San Antonio Spurs for 
first place in the Midwest Division, has lost by 24 and 32 points. 
</P>
<P>
James Edwards, making five of his first six shots from the field, helped the 
Pistons build a 25-13 lead in nine minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Golden State 105, Minnesota 95 -- The Warriors have rebounded after winning 
only four of their first 18 games. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a 40-point performance by Randy Breuer at Minneapolis, the Warriors 
ended the Timberwolves' three-game winning streak with their fourth victory in 
21 road games. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors, who have won four in a row and finally reached .500, broke the 
game open in the second quarter. Chris Mullin scored 10 of his 18 points in the 
quarter as the Warriors outscored the Timberwolves, 30-10, to grab a 61-40 
halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Denver 125, Atlanta 113 -- The Nuggets, leading by only 68-65 at halftime at 
home, went on a 9-0 run in the first 70 seconds of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Adams, a 5-foot-11 guard, had 27 points for Denver, including four 
three-point baskets and an alley-oop dunk. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 121, Sacramento 89 -- Kevin McHale and Michael Smith combined for 24 
points in a 33-10 second-quarter spurt to lead the Celtics at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Bird had two free throws for 65 in a row. The record is Calvin Murphy's 
78. DAN HAFNER

Danny Everett, formerly of UCLA, set a world indoor record of 45.04 seconds in 
the men's 400 meters at an IAAF Grand Prix track and field meet Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Everett clipped one hundredth of a second from the mark of 45.05 set by Thomas 
Schonlebe of East Germany on Feb. 5, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"Deep down I felt I could break the world record," said the 23-year-old who 
competes for the Santa Monica Track Club. 
</P>
<P>
The 400-meter bronze medalist at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, Everett also won a 
gold with the U.S. 1,600-meter relay team. 
</P>
<P>
Everett raced against the clock from the start, with Mark Thomas of Britain a 
distant second at 47.64. 
</P>
<P>
"It was fortunate that we stayed in our lanes until the end," Everett said. 
"Merging lanes makes it much more difficult to concentrate on your running, you 
have to think about positioning yourself, pushing people."

HEROLD KICKS BACK, O'SULLIVAN LEFT IN DUST

Jens-Peter Herold of East Germany, 1988 Olympic bronze medalist in the 1,500 
meters, was outkicked Friday night by Marcus O'Sullivan in the Wanamaker Mile 
at the Millrose Games in New York. 
</P>
<P>
But it was a different story Sunday when they ran the mile at the Mobil 1 
Invitational at George Mason University. 
</P>
<P>
After losing to O'Sullivan by .24 of a second, Herold avenged his loss to the 
Irishman by winning in a time of 3:58.96. O'Sullivan was timed in 4:00.39, 
followed by Steve Scott at 4:01.21. 
</P>
<P>
O'Sullivan said he was emotionally drained after winning in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"I won more on emotion last (Friday) night than I did on physical fitness," 
O'Sullivan said. "It's difficult to come from something like the Millrose and 
try to get back up again because you're just so emotionally strung out. 
</P>
<P>
"I warmed up today like it was just a training session. Friday night I could 
barely move because I was so nervous. I didn't have that same edge." 
</P>
<P>
Herold had the edge, passing O'Sullivan with two laps remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"It was embarrassing," O'Sullivan said. "I just couldn't get going. Normally 
I'll fight and fight to make it close and interesting for people. Today I just 
couldn't get rolling." 
</P>
<P>
Herold said he felt more comfortable running on the 200-meter tartan than he 
did on the 160-yard wooden track at Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to have experience running on the boards," Herold said. "This track 
is more to my liking. The wooden track comes back at you, but this is more like 
an outdoor track and you can power off the ground." 
</P>
<P>
Herold said he felt strong when he made his move. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want it to come down to a kick because I felt O'Sullivan would win if 
it was a jog and kick race," Herold said. "So I tried to make a strong move so 
it didn't get down to a kick." 
</P>
<P>
The three fastest outdoor hurdlers of all-time -- Roger Kingdom, Renaldo 
Nehemiah and Greg Foster -- competed in the men's 60-meter high hurdles but the 
winner was Arthur Blake, a 1988 Olympian from Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
After failing to make the final at the Millrose Games despite running a 
personal best of 6.99 seconds, Blake ran 7.51 seconds while Foster was clocked 
in 7:56. Tony Dees was third at 7.56. 
</P>
<P>
"When I got up this morning I said, 'I'm going to win today,' " Blake said. 
"Maybe I should try that every morning before I get up for a race." 
</P>
<P>
Foster thinks Blake, 23, is America's top young hurdler. 
</P>
<P>
"Blake is going to be one of the best hurdlers in the world," Foster said. "If 
I had to pick a young hurdler to take over he'd be at the top of my list." 
</P>
<P>
Nehemiah, who failed to finish in the Millrose Games after hitting the first 
hurdle, finished fourth Sunday at 7.58. Kingdom, recovering from the flu, ran 
last in 7.63. 
</P>
<P>
Olympic champion Jackie Joyner-Kersee was beaten again by LaVonna Martin, 
former Tennessee star, in the women's hurdles. Martin, who defeated 
Joyner-Kersee by .06 of a second in the Millrose Games, was timed in 7.99 
seconds and Joyner-Kersee clocked 8.04. 
</P>
<P>
Martin left Joyner-Kersee in the blocks, but Joyner-Kersee was coming on at the 
finish. 
</P>
<P>
"If I have a good race, I tend to blank out," Martin said. "I remember the 
start, but after that I don't remember anything." 
</P>
<P>
Diane Dixon, American indoor record-holder at 400 meters, set a meet record of 
52.30 in the 400. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon said she has been running better because of help she received from TV 
star Bill Cosby, who ran track at Temple. 
</P>
<P>
Cosby bet Dixon that she could take a second off her personal best if she would 
train under his friend Joshua Culbreath, bronze medalist in the 400-meter 
hurdles at the 1956 Olympics. So Dixon moved from Brooklyn to Xenia, Ohio, to 
train under Culbreath. 
</P>
<P>
"I said if Cosby is saying this, (Culbreath) must be good," Dixon said. "It's 
been great training with him." 
</P>
<P>
Track Notes 
</P>
<P>
Four other meet records were set. Viorica Ghican of Romania set a meet record 
of 4:27.10 in the women's mile and teammate Doina Melinte set a meet record of 
2:02.13 in the women's 800. Sorin Matei of Romania set a meet record of 7-7 in 
the men's high jump. The media was unable to interview the Romanians because 
their translator didn't accompany them from New York, where he attended the 
Millrose Games. . . . Clarence Daniel set a meet record of 46.28 in the men's 
400.

FIRST PERSON: RETURN OF THE NATIVE -WITH SON

<P>
It produced the sort of cultural miasma one might expect if Madonna ever met 
and hugged the Queen Mum. 
</P>
<P>
Here was England -- tweedy, damp, sensible mother of perpetual tradition who 
still distrusts callow America as a nation. Yet she remains fascinated by 
Americans as individuals. 
</P>
<P>
Here was my visiting son -- a towering tribute to a teen-age regimen of 
weightlifting and Domino's Pizza and an All-American freshman majoring in fine 
arts, mini-trucks, Skid Row CDs and Alpha Tau Omega boondockers. Yet he's also 
a beginning cosmopolitan intrigued by half of his bloodline rooted in the 
England that Santayana saw as a paradise of anomalies, eccentricities, heresy, 
hobbies and humours. 
</P>
<P>
So they came together, this land and my lad. As big dog and puppy. With common 
suspicion, fear and interest. 
</P>
<P>
New friends and old family were impressed by: 
</P>
<P>
* His accent. 
</P>
<P>
* PJ as a name for anyone who isn't a regular on "Dallas." 
</P>
<P>
* This young man's priceless contribution to Anglo-American understanding: that 
Malibu, the drink, is not a big seller on Malibu, the beach. 
</P>
<P>
PJ, in turn, saw Utopia in this civilization that: 
</P>
<P>
* Eats a full dinner -- eggs, sausages, tomatoes, mushrooms, bacon and fried 
bread -- for breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
* Tolerates Motorway traffic at 110 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
* Does not card teen-agers and allows its pubs to serve 18-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
His jury remains out on prime-time television coverage of snooker tournaments, 
Indian food to go that is known as tandoori take-away, and prim criticism of 
politicians' sex habits by daily newspapers that publish pictures of 
bare-breasted secretaries from Liverpool. 
</P>
<P>
PJ even began wrestling with bilingualism. As in "shed-yule" and 
"con-trov-azee" and "com-po-sight." 
</P>
<P>
He also remained understandably blank -- yet blessedly refreshing -- before the 
inexplicable lore of this elderly land. 
</P>
<P>
Where, he asked, is the economy of communication in road signs that warned 
"Area Closed All Day To Heavy Goods Vehicles" when a simple "No Trucks" would 
do the job? 
</P>
<P>
Why is beer called bitter when it isn't? 
</P>
<P>
Why must we be at Aunt Joy's for coffee at 10:30 a.m. when this mid-morning 
social grace is called "elevenses?" 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the compost heap. 
</P>
<P>
His grandmother, the last of the grand Victorian rosarians, keeps a compost 
heap alongside her working greenhouse. The pile is fed daily by eggshells, tea 
bags, carrot tops and other earth-soluble detritus from the most productive 
kitchen this side of Julia Childs'. It is black and slimy. 
</P>
<P>
"What," asked PJ, "is that stuff?" 
</P>
<P>
The face of humus, I explained, that has launched a thousand floribundas. It is 
Mother Nature's condiment. 
</P>
<P>
I rammed a garden fork deep into the mess and piled rotting grass upon 
suppurating cabbage leaves. That, I said, is compost. 
</P>
<P>
"That," said PJ, "is a smelly public health hazard. It also is moving." 
</P>
<P>
The finale of dinner one night, was Mother's rich, home-cured, fruity, 
family-famous pudding saved from Christmas. Humming a belated carol, she 
carried it high and ceremoniously into the dining room. 
</P>
<P>
"Dad," hissed PJ. "There's a tree growing from the middle of dessert." 
</P>
<P>
That, I told him, is a sprig of holly decorating a Christmas pudding. It is a 
tradition predating Dickens. Eat. 
</P>
<P>
"But the pudding is on fire." 
</P>
<P>
Flaming brandy, I explained. It's another British tradition alongside snooker 
tournaments and bare-breasted secretaries from Liverpool. Eat. 
</P>
<P>
He nibbled as his grandmother spoke: "It should be a lovely pudding. I put it 
up two years ago." 
</P>
<P>
The horror on PJ's face was a page from Stephen King. 
</P>
<P>
"Dad," he whispered. "I will not eat anything that is two years old." 
</P>
<P>
Son, if you have eaten salami, smoked oysters, microwave lasagna, Milk Duds, 
beef jerky and Cheddar cheese, you probably have eaten something even older 
than your grandmother's Christmas pudding. And don't tell me that Alpha Tau 
Omega frowns on 12-year-old Scotch. Eat. 
</P>
<P>
In truth, and in the confusion of the serving process, I think PJ slid most of 
his pudding into a napkin that went into a pants pocket that was emptied in the 
privacy of an upstairs bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
I couldn't blame him. 
</P>
<P>
I even understood his faux pas during 10:30 elevenses at Aunt Joy's the 
following day. 
</P>
<P>
She had offered PJ a raisin pastry with his coffee. 
</P>
<P>
"How old is it?" he blurted.

CALARTS STUDENT FILMS AT LACE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
"CalArts Motion Graphics Gala," a program of short student works Filmforum is 
presenting at the LACE gallery tonight, amply demonstrates a personal vision. 
</P>
<P>
The most striking aspect of the show is its diversity: The films cover a wide 
variety of styles and techniques that range from conventional storytelling to 
pure abstraction, and from traditional cel animation to computer graphics. The 
best offer viewers a uniquely beautiful blend of color, motion and design; the 
weaker ones make five minutes seem like an eternity. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Jahnke adapts the intricate look of Maori carvings to recount a New 
Zealand legend of a battle between the Sky God and his siblings in the boldly 
original "Te Utu" (1980). "Phases" (1978), Henry Selick's powerful study of a 
panther attacking a horse, is a tour de force of both animation and 
draftsmanship: Every frame demonstrates the artist's exceptional understanding 
of animal anatomy and motion. 
</P>
<P>
This contrasts sharply with the serenity of Dennis Pies' "Aura Corona" (1976). 
Semi-abstract creatures resembling trilobites float through a sea of shimmering 
veils in this lovely, meditative film. Amy Kravitz's highly textural 
black-and-white drawings are pure abstractions that contain no recognizable 
images, yet they move with a natural, sensual grace in "The Trap" (1987). 
</P>
<P>
Not all the works in "Motion Graphics Gala" achieve this level of excellence. 
The crude, metamorphic figures in Kathy Rose's "The Mysterians" (1975) are less 
the product of a childlike naivete than a lack of drawing ability. John 
Adamczyk uses a computer to generate staggeringly complex fractal patterns in 
"Recurrents" (1987), but there's very little movement in the film, and anyone 
who picks up a copy of "Chaos" can see the same images. "Pink Triangle" (1989) 
showcases Bob Doucette's talent as a painter, but its story about the Nazi 
persecution of homosexuals doesn't begin until the film is nearly over. 
</P>
<P>
 "CalArts Motion Graphics Gala" screens at 8 p.m. at LACE, 1804 Industrial St. 
Information: (213) 276-7452 or (714) 923-2441.

STATEWIDE DRIVE SEEKS FUNDS FOR BAY AREA QUAKE VICTIMS; 
</P>
<P>
THE ARTS: MORE THAN $500,000 IS NEEDED TO QUALIFY FOR A FEDERAL MATCHING GRANT 
TO AID ARTISTS AND ORGANIZATIONS.

<TEXT>
<P>
The California Arts Council is planning a statewide fund-raising campaign to 
aid Bay Area artists and arts organizations devastated by the Oct. 17 
earthquake, the agency's executive director said late last week. 
</P>
<P>
Replete with celebrity pitchmen, an 800 phone number for pledges and donation 
envelopes that will drop from programs into theatergoers' laps, the campaign 
aims to raise $550,000 needed by the San Francisco Arts Recovery Fund to 
qualify for a federal matching grant, said Robert H. Reid, Arts Council 
director. 
</P>
<P>
In December, the National Endowment for the Arts awarded a $550,000 grant to 
help the Bay Area's artistic community recover from the earthquake, which 
damaged museums, theaters and studios from Marin County to Monterey. The agency 
stipulated that its grant be matched 3-to-1 by other contributions, to create a 
$2.2-million fund for artists. The fund has already received requests for four 
times the amount of available moneys, said the project's coordinator, Christine 
Elbel. 
</P>
<P>
According to officials, however, the fund, which has collected $1.1 million 
from corporations and local governments in the Bay Area, is a half-million 
dollars short of meeting the matching grant. The Arts Recovery Fund has until 
January, 1991, to raise its share. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be honest with you, there's been a shortfall in fund-raising efforts," 
said Margie O'Driscoll, Mayor Art Agnos' cultural affairs liaison. 
</P>
<P>
As the earthquake recedes into memory, said Reid, "the money up here is slowly 
drying up. That's why we want to involve the whole state in the project." 
</P>
<P>
Forty percent of the Arts Recovery Fund is earmarked for the American 
Conservatory Theatre, whose home at the famed Geary Theatre near Union Square 
here suffered extensive damage in the earthquake. The conservatory was forced 
to relocate its production facilities and rent other theaters for its plays, 
adding an additional $1 million in expenses to the company's $2.5-million 
annual budget, said managing director John Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
The conservatory's share of the recovery fund can only be used for operating 
expenses, not for rebuilding the Geary Theatre, officials said. The 
conservatory is undertaking a separate campaign to raise the estimated $15 
million needed to restore the Geary, Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
Another 30% of the Arts Recovery Fund is slated for severely hit Santa Cruz 
County; the balance is to be allocated to artists and groups in Alameda, Contra 
Costa, Marin, Monterey, San Benito, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara and 
Solano counties. 
</P>
<P>
Applicants for grants include well-known institutions such as the San Francisco 
Museum of Modern Art and the Exploratorium, as well as smaller groups that were 
struggling even before the earthquake, Elbel said. 
</P>
<P>
The statewide campaign, which is planned for March and April, will ask artists 
and organizations who have received arts council grants to help raise money for 
their Bay Area colleagues. Specifically, they are being asked to insert 
fund-raising circulars in their concert and theater programs, Reid said. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, public service announcements on radio and television will ask for 
contributions. A toll-free telephone number is being established, and 
contributors will be able to charge their donations to credit cards, he said. 
</P>
<P>
All is not final with the project, however: Reid said the campaign had yet to 
settle on a slogan -- "we're still quibbling over it," he said -- and wouldn't 
release the names of any celebrities taking part, save that of Gov. George 
Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, "We're talking big Hollywood names, big artistic names, very 
recognizable names out there asking for your help." 
</P>
<P>
He said arts organizations in Southern California are eager to assist in the 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason they're so eager to help is that they realize the next 'Big One' is 
going to level Los Angeles," he said. "They might want help too."

The National Council on the Arts ended its first meeting of 1990 -- a year 
likely to become the most pivotal in its 25-year history -- on Saturday unable 
to agree on the dimensions of the political threats it faces and how to respond 
to them. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, discussions throughout the council's two-day session here returned 
repeatedly to fundamental questions of how the body, which is the advisory 
board to the National Endowment for the Arts, sees its role in determining 
public policy in the arts in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
And while these questions -- over such issues as what role the endowment's 
council may properly take in persuading members of Congress to extend the 
endowment's legislative life and what strings on artistic and creative policy 
Congress may attach, if any -- were raised repeatedly, none of them was 
answered. 
</P>
<P>
The year is widely perceived as crucial to the arts endowment and the arts 
council because Congress must act to renew the legal mandate of the endowment, 
which is due to expire later in 1990, in an election year climate of intense 
scrutiny over the appropriateness -- in terms of subject matter -- of artworks 
the endowment funds. Conservatives are expected to attempt to impose rigid 
statutory limits to the kind of artworks the federal government can support. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the controversy resulted in the first legal controls over the 
content of NEA-funded artworks since the agency was founded in 1965. The 
endowment's current appropriations bill bans support of obscene art unless it 
meets high standards of artistic excellence. 
</P>
<P>
Yet as the arts endowment prepares to face the political challenges of the 
legislative process called reauthorization, its 24-member governing body has 
this additional political baggage: 
</P>
<P>
* It will see during 1990 the expirations of the terms of 10 of its members. 
Endowment Chairman John E. Frohnmayer told council members over the weekend 
that no list of nominees to President Bush for new positions has been drawn up 
and that, in fact, criteria for selecting new council members remain undefined. 
</P>
<P>
* Simultaneously, Frohnmayer and some members of the council -- which must vote 
on every grant the endowment makes but whose recommendations on grants and 
other policy can legally be overridden by Frohnmayer -- have expressed concern 
that the arts council has lost a balance it once had between members who are 
prominent, established artists and those who represent the viewpoints of arts 
policy-makers, arts executives and arts patrons. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1965, the council has included such prominent artists as actors Gregory 
Peck and Charlton Heston, conductor Leonard Bernstein, painter Richard 
Diebenkorn, jazz musician Duke Ellington and violinist Isaac Stern. 
</P>
<P>
Today, however, only about a quarter of the council membership includes people 
whose principal background is in the creative arts. Only two -- painter Helen 
Frankenthaler and dancer/dance artistic director Arthur Mitchell -- are 
practicing artists of broad public note. In discussions throughout the weekend, 
it was clear that the existing membership of the arts council is deeply divided 
over how to respond to the endowment's political challenges this year -- and 
even over whether facing the political crisis head-on is appropriate. Robert 
Garfias, an ethnomusicologist on the faculty of UC Irvine, noted that Rep. Dana 
Rohrabacher (R-Lomita) raised questions on the House floor just last week over 
the endowment's twice-removed, indirect role in supporting a risque performance 
by a New York artist named Annie Sprinkle at the Kitchen, a New York arts 
center. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to have some surprises," said Garfias of the Rohrabacher attack. 
"I'm very uncomfortable (about things like the implied co-mingling of funds 
that supported) Annie Sprinkle. I'm worried about things we don't know about." 
</P>
<P>
But council members like author/editor Joseph Epstein resisted confronting the 
discomfiting merger of practicing art and practicing politics -- despite the 
ferocity of the controversy that gripped the endowment last year. "Panic has 
set in" because of the political pressure, Epstein argued. But he argued that 
the arts council lacks the political sophistication or legislative mandate to 
enter political combat with experienced congressional foes. Epstein and several 
council members expressed bewilderment about how to meet the political 
challenge -- and resisted proposals by other members that the arts council cast 
itself in a quasi-lobbying role, carrying its battle directly to congressional 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the arts council reached no decisions on political strategy, 
despite warningsfrom members like Garfias that "the next battle is around the 
corner. It's going tocome."

TREATMENT BACKLOG LEAVES O.C. ADDICTS IN PURGATORY

<P>
A serious shortage of treatment centers is making it increasingly difficult to 
help hundreds of Orange County's worst drug addicts, many of whom must wait up 
to six months for care after qualifying for the government-funded programs. 
</P>
<P>
Discouraged by long delays and harmed by continuing drug abuse while on waiting 
lists, roughly half of those promised a bed at the county's two residential 
treatment centers never show up on admission day. 
</P>
<P>
The situation, county officials and former drug users say, denies help for 
those who need it most and places many addicts in a frustrating purgatory where 
drug use worsens, relatives suffer and society continues to pay the price of 
drug-related crime. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the intent of medical professionals and Congress to get people into 
treatment right away," said William Edelman, division manager of the County 
Health Care Agency's drug abuse programs. "For people with insurance in private 
facilities, that happens, but if you're down and out, rippin' and runnin', the 
space is just not available." 
</P>
<P>
County officials estimate that there could be more than 20,000 people in Orange 
County with drug problems serious enough to qualify them for the 15-month 
regimens at Phoenix House in Santa Ana and Hope House in Anaheim. Hundreds 
apply every year for the 105 slots at the county-funded facilities, which 
provide living quarters and an intensive counseling program. Surveys of 
graduates three years out of the program show that 75% to 80% of them have 
stayed off addictive substances. 
</P>
<P>
The residential centers exclude pregnant women and those single parents who 
cannot find someone to care for their children while in treatment. The county 
has no long-term facility for these addicts, except outpatient clinics. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at Hope House and Phoenix House say that two- to six-month waits are 
common. In extreme cases, the delay can be a year. The time from acceptance to 
admission for women is generally two to three months; for men, six months or 
more. 
</P>
<P>
Marc Corradini, executive director of Hope House, said that so many people are 
qualified for the programs that if the county ran regular public service 
announcements on radio, the wait would soon grow to a year. 
</P>
<P>
"If we were aggressive and really advertised, we could easily increase the 
applicants . . . and have a backlog of six months to a year," Corradini said. 
"But that's inhumane." 
</P>
<P>
Those seeking admission to the county's residential drug treatment centers are 
some of the most seriously addicted that the streets can offer. About 43% use 
intravenous drugs. Most are between 18 and 30 years old with long histories of 
drug abuse that began in adolescence or childhood. 
</P>
<P>
Broke and unemployed, they cannot afford $100 an hour or $1,000 a day for 
treatment at private centers, which are in ample supply. Making matters worse, 
many have criminal records, some so serious that private facilities would 
refuse to accept them even if they could pay. 
</P>
<P>
"The county must pick up those that fall between the cracks and cannot afford 
the private sector," Edelman said. "They are often the most difficult cases in 
the county, and this group is continuing to grow." 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, the situation is not much different. In Los Angeles and San 
Francisco, it can take a year to get into treatment. Statistics from the 
California Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs show that in 1989, 2,752 
people were on waiting lists at 81 long-term treatment centers funded by 
counties across the state. 
</P>
<P>
About 85% were on the lists longer than seven days. The same figures show that 
4,014 people were turned away from those centers last year because the wait was 
too long or they could not afford certain services. 
</P>
<P>
"People all over the state say they would like more residential facilities," 
said Michael Caron, who administers state grants for the Department of Alcohol 
and Drug Programs. "My sense is that a two-month waiting list is lovely, if you 
can find it." 
</P>
<P>
Most don't, however, and must endure longer delays for treatment, an often 
frustrating experience that can discourage some people from waiting for or 
accepting a slot when it finally becomes available. 
</P>
<P>
To make matters worse, those on waiting lists must check in daily on their own 
by telephone or risk losing the spot saved for them. Former drug users say that 
isn't easy for an addict living on the street. 
</P>
<P>
Al, who asked that his last name not be used, said that he was frustrated by 
the process but still made the required calls to Hope House from jail and Cider 
House, a Norwalk detoxification center he entered temporarily after a drinking 
binge. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I was just tired of getting nowhere," he said. "I knew I needed help 
and I kept calling no matter where I was or how hard it was. When I finally got 
in, I couldn't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
But at Phoenix House and Hope House, roughly 50% of those accepted into the 
programs drop out after waiting three weeks. Many of those who stick it out on 
the waiting list continue using drugs and risk jail or worse in the interim. 
</P>
<P>
"People get arrested for crimes or simply vanish," said William H. Smith, 
director of clinical services for Phoenix House. "Most continue to play Russian 
roulette with their lives and continue doing what they've always been doing -- 
taking drugs." 
</P>
<P>
While Sharlene Woronets, 26, was on the waiting list for Phoenix House, she 
said she lost her job and began stealing purses -- "anything" -- to support an 
8-year-old addiction to heroin and cocaine. After a two-month wait, a bed 
opened up for her. At the time she was in the county jail for women in Santa 
Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"I called and said I needed help, but they said there's a four- to six-month 
wait," Woronets recalled. "It's depressing. Your desire for help lessens the 
longer you don't get in. I didn't like being on ice." 
</P>
<P>
The day Hope House accepted Al and put him on a waiting list for treatment he 
went on the binge of his life to celebrate. It was no small achievement. The 
ruddy 23-year-old normally drank himself into unconsciousness or snorted enough 
crystal methamphetamine to go four days without sleep. 
</P>
<P>
Al was high for most of three months -- the time it took his name to reach the 
top of a waiting list. During that time, he was in and out of jail on warrants, 
had smashed the windows of his father's house and was arrested on a charge of 
assault with a deadly weapon. By his estimation, he "got heavier" into drugs. 
</P>
<P>
On admission day, Al said, he was still feeling the effects of methamphetamine. 
He cleaned himself up, though, dropped a little Visine in his eyes and 
presented himself at the center's front door. 
</P>
<P>
"I really thought they forgot about me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, parents experience the same frustration and anxiety as their 
children on the waiting lists. Woronets' father, Eli, said that he worried 
every time the body of a missing young woman was discovered by police. During 
the three months that Carol Olds, 31, waited to get into Phoenix House, her 
mother Altha almost gave up hope. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think she'd ever get into a program," she said. "I was tired of 
dealing with people that were users. Items were missing from my house all the 
time. I didn't even want my own daughter in the house. It's frustrating there 
aren't more Phoenix Houses." 
</P>
<P>
County and state officials blame the shortage of treatment centers on rampant 
drug use, a traditional emphasis on law enforcement rather than treatment, and 
the AIDS crisis, which is providing more of an incentive for drug addicts -- 
particularly intravenous drug users -- to get help. 
</P>
<P>
They also point out that cocaine and methamphetamine use have increased 
substantially statewide. People addicted to those drugs are often the hardest 
to treat, which means that they will occupy the limited supply of beds much 
longer. 
</P>
<P>
Financially, Orange County's drug abuse programs have not had a budget increase 
in five years, although drug use remains a serious problem. Combined with 
inflation, Edelman said, it has meant a cut in resources for treatment and 
education. 
</P>
<P>
But officials say that the forecast for drug treatment looks better than it has 
for years. The state has promised Orange County $1.3 million, which will pay 
for new facilities, including 27 more beds for Phoenix House and Hope House. 
More funds will become available, Caron said, as the state applies for new 
federal grants provided by the Bush Administration's national drug policy. 
</P>
<P>
Within the next few months, the county also plans to open a long-term 
residential drug treatment center for pregnant women and for single parents who 
cannot leave their children. Drug abuse officials are negotiating a contract 
for the services. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of women in my situation," said Terry Criswell, 29, a 
recovering alcoholic and cocaine addict who has two children. "It's really 
tough to find a place. You end up getting discouraged and resort back to your 
old behavior." 
</P>
<P>
Criswell could not find any facility in Orange County that would accept her and 
her family, and was eventually admitted to Foley House in Whittier, which 
accepts pregnant women and parents with their children. 
</P>
<P>
"The lack of a residential program for pregnant women represents a big gap in 
the county's drug treatment effort," said Len Liberio, a drug program manager 
for the County Health Care Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Even when funds are approved, opening new clinics and expanding facilities is 
not that simple. The county- and city-permit processes can take a year or 
longer, and substantial opposition from prospective neighbors, who fear a 
decline in property values, must be overcome. 
</P>
<P>
The county has been trying to set up an outpatient clinic in a commercial area 
in South Orange County, but the owner of the property has been reluctant to 
grant a lease. 
</P>
<P>
"Drug addicts are social pariahs," Liberio said. "It's the traditional 'not in 
my back yard' syndrome and the attitude is pervasive in all cities. But once 
the centers are in, they are good neighbors."

AT PACIFIC BELL, THE LATINO LINE'S BUSY 
</P>

<P>
The phones ring 14,000 times a day in a nondescript office building in downtown 
Santa Ana. And every caller is someone speaking Spanish, in need of a 
translator. 
</P>
<P>
This is Pacific Bell's Language Assistance Bureau, a hubbub of computerized 
switchboards and 90 bilingual operators who field calls en espanol from all 
over the state. If a woman in San Jose calls 611 for repairs but can't 
communicate, she is patched through to Santa Ana within seconds. If a man in 
Santa Barbara needs a phone number but can't ask in English, his call is routed 
south. 
</P>
<P>
The Language Assistance Bureau, the only one of its kind in the state, is open 
seven days a week, 24 hours a day. Inside, the modern-looking bureau is busy 
but hushed. There are no buzzers or bells; each incoming call is signaled by a 
flashing light. Conversations are peppered with the word gracias. 
</P>
<P>
The calls transferred to the bureau vary from simple requests to reports of 
emergencies that require split-second decisions by the operators. 
</P>
<P>
One operator, Lando Silva, remembers a call that left him shaking afterward. A 
woman from Los Angeles dialed 0, screaming for help because her husband 
threatened to beat her up. The Los Angeles operator, who could not speak 
Spanish, patched the call to Silva, who kept the woman on the line to get more 
information. The two operators managed to find out where the woman lived and 
sent the police to her home. 
</P>
<P>
"That was so stressful, I almost couldn't talk afterwards," said Silva, who has 
worked in the bureau for nearly two years. 
</P>
<P>
Another time, operator Marty Nelson received a call from a frightened 
3-year-old girl who was left alone in the house with her younger sibling. The 
girl dialed 0 for an operator because she thought she heard a noise in the 
house. The operator, who couldn't speak Spanish, established a three-way 
conversation with Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to calm her down and keep her on the line so the police could trace her 
call. She was so scared," said Nelson. The police found the girl, who was 
unhurt but shaken. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson said she went home that day and gave her own 10-year-old extra hugs. 
</P>
<P>
The operators, who range in age from 17 to 65, take an average of 250 calls a 
day. Some of them specialize in particular Spanish dialects -- Cuban or Costa 
Rican Spanish, for example. Callers who need help in other languages, such as 
Chinese, Korean and Vietnamese, are referred to other centers for ordering 
telephones or requesting repairs, but the telephone company does not provide 
translators for directory assistance and other operator services. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the calls forwarded to the bureau are less dramatic than the memorable 
pleas for help. They tend to deal with simple requests, such as finding phone 
numbers for residents or businesses. 
</P>
<P>
But some requests are more difficult for the bilingual operators. For example, 
many of their calls involve taking part in a three-way conversation with 
another operator or a repair worker to help a Spanish speaker who cannot 
understand English instructions. And there are times when the operators have to 
be sources of news and reassurance to their callers. 
</P>
<P>
When the San Francisco Bay Area was jolted by a 7.1 temblor on Oct. 17, many of 
the operators had to break the news of the earthquake to callers, who could not 
reach their families because the lines were busy or out of order. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to tell the callers not to dial their relatives and friends, no matter 
how much they wanted to. We had to convince them not to tie up the lines," 
Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
The operators, almost half of whom live outside Orange County, must pass 
Pacific Bell's regular test for employment as well as qualify in language 
fluency. 
</P>
<P>
Working at the Language Assistance Bureau gives the bilingual operators a 
chance to work for the Latino community, said Rosemary F. Padilla, who 
co-manages the bureau. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a job where many of the operators can help out people who really need 
their bilingual skills," Padilla said. 
</P>
<P>
A handful of area codes cannot be patched to the Language Assistance Bureau 
because Pacific Bell does not have the technology to provide the translation 
services to some cities, said Linda Bonniksen, a Pacific Bell spokeswoman. For 
example, Spanish speakers in the 818 and parts of the 415 areas can be helped 
with repair service, but cannot be transferred for directory assistance 
translation, she said. 
</P>
<P>
For the operators, the busiest day of the year traditionally is May 10, Dia de 
las Madres, which is the Mexican Mother's Day. On that day, operators take one 
call after another. 
</P>
<P>
But the job can often be amusing. 
</P>
<P>
Take, for example, the man who needed help in making a long-distance call. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson told the man to dial "00," for the long-distance operator. The caller 
told Nelson to hold on. She then heard several seconds of fumbling. 
</P>
<P>
The caller then told Nelson that he couldn't make a long distance call because 
he didn't have a "00" button on his phone. 
</P>
<P>
And there are always requests for the home phone numbers of internationally 
known Latino movie stars and musicians.

MEDFLY THRUSTS AG CHIEF INTO THE SPOTLIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
GOVERNMENT: ORANGE COUNTY AGRICULTURE COMMISSIONER JIM HARNETT ONCE ENJOYED A 
LOW PROFILE. BUT HIS NEW JOB OF EXPLAINING THE STATE'S PESTICIDE PLAN HAS 
CHANGED ALL THAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Until a few months ago, Jim Harnett jokes, the most visible part of his dual 
position as Orange County's agriculture commissioner and sealer of weights and 
measures entailed "making sure the strawberries were sweet and the scales in 
the groceries were right." 
</P>
<P>
Then the Medfly hit Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the career bureaucrat with a low profile finds himself thrust into the 
sometimes-unnerving role of local point man for the state's expanding aerial 
campaign against the Mediterranean fruit fly. 
</P>
<P>
At press conferences, combative city council hearings and meetings with worried 
agriculture lobbyists, the job of explaining and defending the state's 
pesticide plan -- and trying to assuage public fears over it -- has often 
fallen to Harnett and his troops. 
</P>
<P>
Harnett, 57 and a longtime Orange resident, asserts that his new role in the 
public spotlight has been a challenging and exciting one. But already, critics 
of the malathion effort charge that his office has offered a one-sided 
justification for a policy that they say may expose hundreds of thousands of 
Orange County residents to a potentially dangerous chemical. 
</P>
<P>
The spotlight seems certain to intensify in coming weeks as agriculture 
officials plan to continue spraying malathion up to a dozen times in all over 
about 44 square miles of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Harnett will face what could be one of his toughest forums to date 
when he appears before the County Board of Supervisors as it considers 
extending its vote of confidence for the Medfly policy. Protesters promise to 
turn out en masse for the meeting, and at least two of the five supervisors say 
they will vote against the spraying -- even though state officials, also 
expected to be at the meeting, insist the county is powerless to stop it. 
</P>
<P>
Harnett gets high marks from malathion proponents and critics alike, both 
locally and in Sacramento, for his professionalism, enthusiasm, and a friendly 
and calm demeanor at the helm of the agriculture office, a $63,000-a-year post 
he has held for nearly three years by appointment of the County Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
"He's one of the best commissioners we have," said Joe Bandy, regional 
coordinator for the state Department of Food and Agriculture, which licenses 
local agriculture commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it is Harnett's normally quiet, 56-employee office near Disneyland that 
has had to bear the brunt of the recent public frustration and skepticism over 
the Medfly campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Operators manning the office's swamped Medfly hot line are sometimes besieged 
by angry, swearing callers. 
</P>
<P>
Local agriculture officials making appearances at packed city meetings in 
recent weeks have been met with caustic questioning, mixed with occasional 
hisses and boos from the crowds. 
</P>
<P>
And some critics say they simply are not satisfied with the assurances they've 
been offered about the safety of the malathion-bait spray mixture, a mistrust 
that has led to protests and an ongoing legal challenge by the cities of 
Huntington Beach, Garden Grove and Westminster to try and halt the spraying. 
</P>
<P>
"The information we've been getting from that office really hasn't been much 
help. It's all 'Trust us, we know what we're doing,' " complained Garden Grove 
Councilman Raymond T. Littrell, a malathion critic. "They just feed us the 
state line and say to hell with any new information that's come along." 
</P>
<P>
Added County Supervisor Roger R. Stanton, an early opponent of the Medfly 
spraying: "I think Jim's an outstanding individual and a professional, and I 
respect him. . . . But I'm deeply concerned that they're not giving us the 
whole picture." 
</P>
<P>
"On an issue like (the Medfly), the public has to have arguments pro and con, 
but we're getting from Jim's office none of the negative information about 
malathion that we're finding in other places," Stanton said, pointing to 
reports that claim malathion may cause cancer, birth defects and other 
maladies. 
</P>
<P>
After more than three decades in the agriculture office, as agriculture 
commissioner Harnett is in the relatively unusual position of answering to both 
the county and the state. But the state picks up part of his salary and 
licenses all local agriculture commissioners -- and has the power to decertify 
them as well. 
</P>
<P>
Because of that precarious balance, Stanton asserts, "I think he's facing an 
inevitable conflict; his hands are tied." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, who also has voiced concerns about the spraying, 
agreed, saying: "He's in an impossible situation. He's just a foot soldier 
taking directions from the state; the real problem and the reason for all the 
frenzy and panic over this (malathion) is at the top." 
</P>
<P>
While voicing opposition to the sprayings has proven good political fodder for 
some Orange County elected leaders, Harnett says he is adamant about staying 
out of politics. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a politician," Harnett said in an interview. "I'm not making judgments 
-- we're just trying to get information to the public without massaging it. 
That's my job." 
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, Harnett said he is bound as commissioner to help carry out 
state scientific protocol for responding to Medfly discoveries such as those 
since November in Brea, Garden Grove and Westminster. "The state is the 
locomotion behind this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Harnett said he fully supports the policy, seeing it as a 
necessary response to the Medfly infestation in the absence of other options. 
</P>
<P>
"The most frustrating part is to see that some people just don't want a 
discussion -- a lot of these people don't want to hear the facts," Harnett 
said. "I have to rotate the people on our (Medfly hot line) because they get 
tired of people telling them how rotten they are, asking, 'What are you doing 
to my kids?' " 
</P>
<P>
On the question of malathion's safety, he said: "There aren't two sides. . . . 
There is no concrete evidence to say that malathion used in these dosages has 
any unreasonable health effect. I don't even think malathion is really the 
issue -- the issue is that people just don't want the helicopters and the 
disruption done to them." 
</P>
<P>
And so, unless and until someone tells him differently, Harnett says he will 
continue dealing with the Medfly issue just as he has been. 
</P>
<P>
He'll continue to have his staff look for fruit quarantine violators and check 
thousands of Medfly traps around the county, sending any possible fertile 
specimens to project headquarters in Los Angeles for dissection. 
</P>
<P>
He'll continue to wait at El Monte Airport as Bell 204 helicopters make their 
rounds over Orange County, taking calls on his car phone from the Medfly hot 
line and monitoring reports from personnel on the ground in the spray area. 
</P>
<P>
And he and his deputies will continue to turn out at public meetings to try and 
answer questions and persuade residents and politicians that the malathion 
spraying is "the only way to go." 
</P>
<P>
And when all the tumult has died down, Harnett said, he'll look forward to 
getting back to the work at hand -- checking strawberries and grocery scales.

STREET SMART: A MISSING FRONT LICENSE PLATE IS NOT AN ARRESTING SIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
My car was in an accident at the end of December. I was rear-ended and the 
front of the car was quite demolished when I was shoved into a huge pole. 
</P>
<P>
My car is almost ready to be returned. My back license plate is OK, but the 
front one is creased, torn and looks too awful to put back on my nice car. I 
happen to like my license number, "2GGE. . . ," which I laughingly call "two 
eggs over easy," and I don't want to get another plate. Will I be penalized if 
I only have a license plate on the back? 
</P>
<P>
My family disagrees with me, but I truly don't want to change my plate. Am I 
liable for a ticket if I only have a plate in the rear of my car? 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
Why are there so many cars driving around in Orange County without a front 
California license plate? They have valid back plates, but the front plate is 
missing. Is this legal? 
</P>
<P>
This seems to be particularly true of the adolescent- or muscle-type vehicles 
with the race-car look. Is the law simply not being enforced, or can we really 
leave our front plates off here in Orange County? 
</P>
<P>
William Luedeking 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Hills 
</P>
<P>
Yes, there are lots of cars zipping around Orange County and other spots in the 
state without front plates. And, yes, it is against the law to operate a car 
that doesn't have license plates affixed to both the front and rear. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, a missing front plate rarely prompts a law officer to pull a 
U-turn and hit the flashing reds. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Ken Daily of the California Highway Patrol's South Orange County 
division said CHP officers don't spend much time looking for people with 
missing license plates. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just not something we focus a lot of attention on," Daily said, noting 
that officers spend most of their time snaring motorists for far more grievous 
violations like speeding and drunk driving. 
</P>
<P>
"Generally, we like a stop to be for a little more than no front plate." 
</P>
<P>
Patrolmen typically issue tickets for a missing plate only when they've 
corralled a motorist for some other violation, Daily said. Even then, the 
citation is merely a fix-it ticket requiring the driver to head into the local 
Department of Motor Vehicles office to replace the missing plate. 
</P>
<P>
Daily agrees that the most frequent scofflaws of the license plate law are 
youthful drivers of high-performance sports cars who seem to feel that the 
plates ruin the cosmetic appeal of their streamlined machines. 
</P>
<P>
But some motorists simply don't realize they've got two plates when a new set 
arrives in the mail, he said. These days, the plates are so thin and sandwiched 
so tightly together that people occasionally think they've been issued only a 
single plate for the rear bumper, Daily said. 
</P>
<P>
As for the travails of Dorothy Jung and her beloved but battered license plate, 
the prospect of saving good ol' "two eggs over easy" looks bleak. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Gengler, a DMV spokesman in Sacramento, said people can reorder copies of 
personalized "vanity" license plates, but general-issue "sequential" plates, by 
policy, cannot be duplicated once they are lost or destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
About 7 million sequential plates are stamped out in huge batches by the state 
each year. With that sort of demand, it proves far less costly and time 
consuming for the DMV to issue a whole new license number and plate to a 
motorist rather than go through the chore of reproducing a lost or destroyed 
plate. 
</P>
<P>
Some motorists have inquired about getting sequential plates reissued by paying 
extra cash and ordering the same license number as a vanity plate, Gengler 
said. But that tactic is also forbidden, primarily because it could put the DMV 
computers into a tail spin. 
</P>
<P>
"She's out of luck," Gengler said. "But maybe she might get an even better 
license number with her new plates." 
</P>
<P>
Ordering a new set is simple. Any local DMV office can issue plates on the spot 
for an $8 charge. People with vanity plates are given a temporary set while the 
others are being stamped out and mailed. 
</P>
<P>
Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
I'm happy about the diamond lanes, but find one thing about driving in them 
that is very upsetting. 
</P>
<P>
Although my husband and I were traveling at a respectable speed in the lane 
that runs to Costa Mesa from Seal Beach, cars kept coming up behind us and 
honking, telling us that we were not going fast enough. Since we were going 
faster than the posted limit already, we resented this rudeness to a great 
degree. 
</P>
<P>
Was it the intention of the Highway Patrol to reserve that lane for cars 
traveling 75 to 90 m.p.h. or drivers with one or more passengers in their cars? 
We deeply resent that some drivers treat this lane as if it were a raceway. 
Can't something be done about that? 
</P>

Tailgating is a common problem in car-pool lanes. There is something about a 
special reserved lane sealed off by a yellow line that trips a switch in lots 
of motorists. Many drivers figure they have carte blanche to push the pedal to 
the metal: "Look, out world! Here I come! And how dare you go the speed limit!" 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Dwight McKenna of the Highway Patrol's Santa Ana office said patrolmen are 
always on the lookout for tailgaters in the car-pool lane. Tailgating is 
considered one of the "big four" offenses, along with speeding, drunk driving 
and unsafe lane changes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
McKenna said officers invariably go with gusto after a tailgater zooming along 
only a car length behind another vehicle. Some officers will snag an offender 
if he's within two or three car lengths at speeds of more than 55 m.p.h., he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the practice is extremely unsafe, people in the fast-lane life style 
of Southern California seem to relish putting their reaction time to the test. 
Fender bender accidents or worse are often the result. 
</P>
<P>
The long-held rule of thumb is to maintain a car length for every 10 m.p.h. 
Another good tip is to allow two seconds between you and the car ahead. To 
check, pick a reference point, like a sign. Watch the car ahead as it passes 
and count one-thousand-one, one-thousand-two. If you pass the same spot before 
you finish counting, you're too close. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, as Johnny Carson has joked, you can move six car lengths back and 
five cars will pull in front of you. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it doesn't do much good when some hotshot in a one-ton pickup comes 
roaring up about 18 inches off your rear bumper. 
</P>
<P>
In those cases, the best thing to do is get out of the guy's way and hope the 
long arm of the law will eventually snag him, said Sam Haynes, a Highway Patrol 
spokesman in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
There is, however, a problem with employing that tactic in the car-pool lane -- 
the yellow line prevents a motorist from immediately sliding into the adjacent 
lane. Haynes recommends staying calm and waiting for the broken white lines so 
you can merge right. During rush hour, this may mean slowing way down and 
popping into the gridlock of cars, but better that than letting some one-ton 
turkey put your trunk in the back seat.

HISTORY: ENTHUSIASTS OF MEDIEVAL TIMES DON HOMEMADE ARMOR AND TRANSFORM A PARK 
CORNER INTO A BATTLEGROUND. AFTER ALL, THE KINGDOM OF CAID IS AT STAKE.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Guy of Castle Kirk's dozen warriors were taking a beating Sunday: Several had 
been felled by blows from their armored opponents, and the remaining stragglers 
were being picked off by an advancing horde. 
</P>
<P>
But Guy Kirk of Visalia was still on his feet, and he swooped around from 
behind the enemy, unmercifully walloping several foes to the turf. 
</P>
<P>
"Guy hits like a ton of bricks," Sir Yaroslav said, leaning on his sword and 
wincing at the recollection of a blow he absorbed from Kirk. "He's not a king 
for nothing." 
</P>
<P>
It was not exactly a medieval battlefield, but for several hours Sunday, the 
knights, ladies and warriors of the Society for Creative Anachronism 
transformed a corner of Mile Square Regional Park in Fountain Valley into a 
staging area for their pitched struggle. As puzzled onlookers paused to 
observe, wave after wave of men outfitted in homemade armor and chain mail beat 
each other with clubs, sticks and other weapons. 
</P>
<P>
There were no injuries, and Kirk -- the king of Caid, who describes himself as 
a "descendant of Achilles, son of Venus and brother of Joe Montana" -- was 
pleased with the results. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks good" he said, cradling his helmet under one arm and watching his 
soldiers line up for another round of combat. "We're getting a lot done." 
</P>
<P>
His queen and their young prince agreed, though the prince, Clay Kirk, seemed 
more interested in finishing his Coke and getting back in the car to go home to 
Visalia. 
</P>
<P>
According to the warriors gathered in the park Sunday, this weekend's battle 
practice was especially important because the honor of the Kingdom of Caid is 
about to be put on the line. Four hundred warriors from the kingdom -- which 
includes Southern California, the Las Vegas area, Hawaii, and New Zealand -- go 
up against their counterparts to the east in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
While most of the country celebrates Presidents' Day weekend, the soldiers of 
Caid will face an equally large contingent from the Kingdom of Atenveldt on an 
Arizona battlefield. 
</P>
<P>
Wars like this one are the most dramatic events hosted by the 24-year-old 
society, a nonprofit organization dedicated to the study of medieval culture. 
Once a small group of Northern California historians and science-fiction 
writers, the society has grown into a 14,000-member organization. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the popularity of the society's military affairs, not all of its 
activities revolve around beating one another with homemade weapons. Sunday, 
most of the participants came to fight, but others said they are drawn to the 
organization by its devotion to the study of medieval arts, science, cooking 
and culture. Of the non-combat categories, beer-brewing seems to enjoy a 
particularly strong following. 
</P>
<P>
The organization also does its share of community outreach, staging events for 
schools so that students can get a glimpse at medieval life. One terminally ill 
child was crowned "prince for a day" last month, after society members learned 
of his wish through the Make a Wish Foundation. The Kingdom of Caid held a 
day's worth of events for the youngster's benefit, and groups of warriors 
battled to uphold his honor. 
</P>
<P>
"I love history," said Sir Yaroslav, who -- under the name of Chuck Olynyk -- 
teaches history at Edison Junior High School in Los Angeles. "And I love the 
society. It allows me to do a lot of the things I want, like reading about 
knights and learning about their culture." 
</P>
<P>
As Olynyk spoke, a soldier who had just come out on the losing end of a 
clubbing ran over for advice on how to wield his weapon, a long stick with a 
crossbar near the base. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel comfortable with it," he complained through his steel-plate mask. 
"I'm having trouble torquing my body." 
</P>
<P>
Olynyk, who earned his knighthood partly because of his proven knowledge of 
battle techniques, grabbed the weapon and demonstrated several lethal-looking 
moves. Then he sent the warrior back into the field. 
</P>
<P>
'You don't go out there alone," Olynyk shouted as the soldier joined ranks with 
his colleagues. "You go out with a buddy, and you watch each other." 
</P>
<P>
For Olynyk and many other participants, the society's affairs become an abiding 
passion. They compete and participate for years, practicing their fighting and 
their crafts, and exhaustively researching their medieval identities. In the 
process, they have woven a tightly knit subculture of enthusiasts of medieval 
times. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really like a big family," said Desla Kirk, queen of Caid, who wore the 
customary crown and observed Sunday's battling from a place of honor on the 
edge of the field. "It's a family, and I'm the den mother."

PLAN PANEL TO VOTE ON PHONE ANTENNA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When residents of a mobile home park were told to expect a new neighbor last 
month, they didn't show the hospitality usually reserved for outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
The new arrival is a 63-foot cellular-telephone antenna which the Pacific 
Telesis Co. wants to install next to the Katella Estates Mobile Home Park on 
Central Avenue. Renters said that the radio waves from the antenna -- the same 
type emitted by FM radio and television transmitters -- are harmful. 
</P>
<P>
About 120 park residents signed a petition to try to block its construction and 
presented it to the city's Planning Commission in January. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just human experimentation," said Yvonne Hemwood, who started the 
petition drive. "There are so many unknown things we'd be exposed to. Who knows 
what it's going to cause?" 
</P>
<P>
Officials at PacTel say the transmitter is harmless, and that it is needed to 
service the 250,000 mobile phones in Southern California. Its output would be 
limited to 100 Watts under federal regulations, they said, which is equivalent 
to the power used by a light bulb. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not dangerous," said Neil Fitzpatrick, the company's general manager for 
government and business relations. "It's like an ant running down the freeway. 
It's absolutely minuscule." 
</P>
<P>
Under pressure from the park's residents, the Planning Commission postponed a 
decision on the antenna until Wednesday. Mike Bouvier, the city's planning 
manager, said research conducted on antennas such as the one being erected on 
Central Avenue shows that there are virtually no negative effects from exposure 
to the radio waves. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing in the literature would seem to indicate this is a major problem," he 
said, adding that the power level output would be "negligible." 
</P>
<P>
But Hillary Deuchar, a resident of the mobile home park, said that the articles 
he's read about cellular antennas show exactly the opposite: that long-term 
exposure to the antenna can be harmful. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly Howard, an associate industrial hygienist for the California Occupational 
Safety and Health Assn., said that residents should be less concerned with the 
antenna's power and more worried about their proximity to it. 
</P>
<P>
"Generally, 30 feet is a safe distance to be at," he said, adding that the 
antenna would have to be in a resident's living room -- "about 1 foot away" -- 
to be harmful. 
</P>
<P>
If the city lets PacTel install the antenna, residents will fight on, they have 
vowed. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't chop it down." said Ellen Munsterman, who lives about 30 feet from 
the proposed antenna site. "We'd like to move, but we can't." CHRISTOPHER

COUNCIL TO DISCUSS PRESCHOOL CHANGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHANNON SANDS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council will discuss changes in the city's preschool at its meeting 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Since city staff members decided to hire a nonprofit group to operate the Child 
Development Program, the plan has drawn criticism from some parents. 
</P>
<P>
They are upset that Mothers at Work plans to increase fees for the child care 
program from $225 per month -- an average of $10.50 per day -- to $15 per day 
when it takes over in March. 
</P>
<P>
Parents were also upset because misunderstandings between Mothers at Work and 
day care staff led to the resignation of several teachers. 
</P>
<P>
City staff members met to iron out differences with a group of parents and 
teachers Thursday, but some are not satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
The council has several options. It could continue the current program, hire 
the teachers as regular employees, implement the contract with Mothers at Work 
or discontinue the program. 
</P>
<P>
If the council approves the contract, which was signed in late December, it 
could choose to offset the fee increases with a city subsidy until the summer, 
when more spots are available in other child care programs. The staff estimates 
that the subsidy for four months would cost the city $25,640. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager William A. Huston has said that the city decided to hire an 
outside group to run the program after independent contractors who teach there 
approached the city and requested benefits, which they do not receive. 
</P>
<P>
The benefits are expensive to provide, and even without them, the program has 
already been losing about $2,400 a month during the last three months, 
according to staff estimates. 
</P>
<P>
Under the contract with Mothers at Work, the teachers will receive benefits.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; 
</P>
<P>
17-YEAR-OLD INJURED AS CAR, TRUCK COLLIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 17-year-old Westminster youth suffered serious injuries Sunday in a 
two-vehicle crash that left him trapped in the wreckage, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Derrek Alexander Enz was in serious condition at Long Beach Memorial Hospital 
with head injuries and multiple breaks in both legs. 
</P>
<P>
Enz was a passenger in a Ford Mustang that collided with a Nissan pickup truck 
at Bolsa Chica Road and Westminster Boulevard about 7:55 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics had to use a hydraulic prying device to free Enz from the car. 
Because rain prevented an airlift rescue, he was taken by ambulance to the 
hospital, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The vehicles' drivers sustained only minor injuries, police said. Each claimed 
to have a green light at the intersection, and police were seeking witnesses to 
resolve the conflicting statements. It was raining at the time of the 
collision, but police did not know if that was a factor.

CHLORINE LEAK AT FILTRATION PLANT FORCES EVACUATION

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A leaking chlorine tank forced the evacuation of about 125 people before dawn 
Sunday as hazardous materials crews worked for several hours to secure a faulty 
valve at a Serrano Irrigation District water filtration plant. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters said people who lived near the facility were awakened and 
evacuated at 1:25 a.m., about 45 minutes after an Orange police officer 
reported a strong chemical odor coming from the plant at 19352 Taft Ave. 
</P>
<P>
Hazardous materials crews from Anaheim and the Orange County Fire Department 
found chlorine used for water purification coming from a 500-gallon tank and 
ordered residents evacuated from the surrounding neighborhood. Chlorine fumes 
can be lethal in cloud form. 
</P>
<P>
Although inconvenienced by being awakened from their sleep early Sunday, those 
who were evacuated said they were generally thankful that authorities took 
swift action to protect them. 
</P>
<P>
"I was delighted they moved us out," said Larry Dick, who lives on Playano 
Avenue. "We might have slept right through it, and I am not comfortable with 
what the ramifications might have been." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities allowed residents to return home about 3:50 p.m. when the leak was 
shut off. They were temporarily housed at Villa Park High School in a center 
set up by the Orange County Chapter of the American Red Cross. No one was 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
"I just took it in stride," said J.B. Fowler, who was awakened and told to 
leave his home on Yurok Street. "It seemed to be a very orderly and smooth 
operation.

DORNAN MAILER ASKS FUNDS TO BEAT KOVIC;

POLITICS: THE CONGRESSMAN IMPLORED HIS BACKERS TO HELP HIM DEFEAT THE VIETNAM 
VETERAN AND THE 'HOLLYWOOD LEFT.'

GARDEN GROVE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vietnam veteran Ron Kovic hasn't even announced his candidacy for Congress, but 
Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) isn't taking any chances. 
</P>
<P>
Dornan, painting the race as a showdown between conservatives and the 
"Hollywood left," sent out 60,000 mailers over the weekend to past political 
contributors, asking for their financial help against the 43-year-old Kovic. 
</P>
<P>
An ardent anti-war activist whose life is chronicled in the current film "Born 
on the Fourth of July," Kovic is now making appearances to explore the 
possibility of challenging Dornan for the conservative's 38th Congressional 
District seat in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after Kovic began hinting at a run earlier this month, Dornan countered 
with a short "telegram" mailer sent to about 25,000 supporters. 
</P>
<P>
But the big hit came this weekend with a four-page campaign piece to most of 
Dornan's political supporters since 1986, the majority within Orange County, 
attacking Kovic and asking for contributions of at least $100. 
</P>
<P>
The mailer shows a picture of Kovic purportedly burning a draft card during 
protests against the Vietnam War and depicts "Born on the Fourth of July" as a 
fictionalized and scandalous account of his wartime service. 
</P>
<P>
"His stands are the antithesis of a county that named its airport after John 
Wayne," Dornan said in an interview Sunday. "This guy has attacked everything 
John Wayne stood for." 
</P>
<P>
Kovic responded Sunday that he was "proud to be the antithesis of John Wayne." 
The actor and his war movies, Kovic said, "did a great disservice to my 
generation, to young men who were manipulated and incited to go to Vietnam. . . 
. Believing in the John Wayne myth got a lot of people killed and a lot of 
people wounded like myself. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether it's John Wayne or Rambo, trying to make us think war is a glorious 
thing and that no one gets hurt or killed . . . is dangerous. And I think the 
John Wayne movies which glorified war when I was growing up in the '50s 
misrepresented what the war was really going to be like for us when we got to 
Vietnam." 
</P>
<P>
Kovic added, "It's the false patriots who always attack the real heroes." He 
said he would continue to respond to "everything he (Dornan) brings up, right 
until his concession speech." 
</P>
<P>
In campaign appearances in recent weeks, the Redondo Beach resident has said 
that he believes voters are tired of Dornan's reliance on stirring 
anti-Communist fears and that they will be lured by Kovic's own background as a 
person who has overcome adversity. 
</P>
<P>
As depicted in "Born on the Fourth of July," Kovic has said he initially 
believed unflinchingly in the U.S. mission in Vietnam but underwent a dramatic 
reversal after seeing firsthand the brutality of the war and its aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
A volunteer in the war, he was paralyzed from the chest down during a 1966 
combat mission. 
</P>
<P>
Dornan said he expects that if Kovic runs, he will be backed heavily by the 
entertainment industry and bolstered by the publicity of the Academy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
"If he comes into the race and (rock star) Bruce Springsteen keeps his promise 
to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars at a concert, then I'm the underdog," 
Dornan said. 
</P>
<P>
The incumbent said he still owes $40,000 from his 1988 campaign and has raised 
less than $10,000 in his reelection bid. He said he thinks he needs at least 
$1.5 million to beat Kovic. "But even if he doesn't run, the Democrats have 
never given me a free ride," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Dornan said he is planning a follow-up mailer to political contributors within 
the next several weeks to attack Oliver Stone, who directed "Born on the Fourth 
of July," for his stated positions on such issues as Panama and the ethical 
roots of American society. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to wrap Oliver Stone around Kovic's neck because they've been best 
friends since '76," the congressman asserted. 
</P>
<P>
Kovic Sunday called Stone "an American treasure. I have tremendous respect for 
Oliver Stone; he is respected throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, he has been a friend of mine for years, and yes we will continue to tell 
the truth about this country so that what happens in war will never happen 
again."

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES: MEDFLY;

<P>
MEDFLY SPRAY DRAWS SWARM OF CONFUSION; 
</P>
<P>
DESPITE ASSURANCES ABOUT MALATHION'S SAFETY, DOCUMENTED SUPPORT HAS NOT BEEN 
FORTHCOMING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHEN E. SPRAGUE, Stephen E. Sprague is a businessman and a resident of 
Garden Grove. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is a frightening scene from an Alfred Hitchcock thriller in which the 
hero, played by Cary Grant, is being relentlessly pursued by a crop-duster. 
</P>
<P>
The residents of Garden Grove and neighboring communities recently experienced 
firsthand the crop-dusting of their homes with a pesticide called malathion in 
an attempt to eradicate a tiny pest called the Medfly. 
</P>
<P>
Judging from reactions of residents, the Hitchcock scene is no more frightening 
or dramatic than what is actually occurring in their communities. They have 
received virtually no information on the risks associated with the poison, only 
hollow attempts by state officials to persuade them that there is no health 
risk to humans -- but please cover your automobiles because the chemical will 
damage your paint. 
</P>
<P>
What are people supposed to think? Their concern should not be written off as 
hysteria when it is motivated by reason, so why is the government treating it 
as such? 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Clara County in 1981, a similar situation plagued both citizens and 
government officials. The Medfly was also the culprit then, creating a serious 
threat to the California agricultural industry, and again malathion spraying 
was determined to be the most expedient method of eradicating the insect. A 
groundswell of protests ensued, primarily from mothers and mothers-to-be, and 
the spraying was temporarily halted. 
</P>
<P>
The Medfly problem persisted and assurances from the Environmental Protection 
Agency, the National Cancer Institute and the California Department of Health 
Services convinced the state Supreme Court that the pesticide posed no 
significant risk to humans. Of course, all of the organizations mentioned do 
receive federal funds, and spraying is relatively inexpensive compared to other 
measures. 
</P>
<P>
Given this, plus the fact that even EPA officials have admitted that there are 
some significant data gaps in these reports, some skepticism is warranted. 
However, these are reputable organizations and most people would be at least 
somewhat comforted if they were aware of this same information. 
</P>
<P>
Why aren't the people of Orange County being made aware? Could it be that under 
close scrutiny the studies could prove to be seriously flawed? It is 
inconceivable that with no studies or documentation presented to the public, 
the state government could expect to pursue a course that many feel could be 
detrimental to their health and not expect a public outcry! 
</P>
<P>
The relative economic and health risks on both sides of the issue should be 
brought to the public before any proposed solution is implemented. We elect our 
officials with the expectation that they will look after our best interests, 
and it is their job to keep us informed of potential health risks that directly 
affect our communities. 
</P>
<P>
The state government tells us that spraying is in "our" best interest. The 
validity of this statement rests on the interpretation of "our." If "our" 
represents the state and its Department of Agriculture, then the answer is yes. 
</P>
<P>
Is this actually the case? On the one hand, it is easy to see how important the 
agricultural industry is to California. In the 1981 Medfly crisis, the 
$14-billion-a-year industry faced a genuinely serious situation when other 
states boycotted California fruit. Attempts to eradicate by the introduction of 
sterile male flies backfired when it was discovered that at least 200,000 of 
these flies, purchased from a Peruvian source, had not been sterile after all. 
The economic implications of this situation are obvious. 
</P>
<P>
But on the other hand, could the current situation be a case of overreaction on 
the part of the state? Imagine this: One pregnant Medfly is found in a trap in 
Garden Grove. A second Medfly is found a little later, also in Garden Grove. 
Without consulting city officials, a state of emergency is declared which 
allows the state to dump chemicals on Garden Grove and neighboring communities. 
</P>
<P>
If we really do have an emergency, why not dump this completely safe chemical 
on the whole county? Why is Disneyland excluded from the spraying when it is 
only 2.5 miles from the Medfly discovery site? 
</P>
<P>
Economics. Tourists are not going to take their children to the amusement park 
after it has been sprayed. Why not dump the chemicals on the governor's home? 
Political clout. The citizens who are being sprayed do not have the economic 
backing that would give them a voice in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
If these allegations are valid, and the state has given us no reason to believe 
otherwise, how seriously can the state be taken when a state of emergency is 
declared? Medflies do not recognize economic boundaries and neither should the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Clara and San Mateo counties just nine years ago, all efforts to block 
spraying, even with the blessings of then-Gov. Jerry Brown, failed. Why should 
the outcome be different today when Gov. George Deukmejian is part of the 
opposition? Perhaps the difference will be in the fact that the current 
groundswell of protests is coming from within the Republican heartland: Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
The issue seems to have struck a similar chord in both Republicans and 
Democrats. They are demanding some answers, and as concerned citizens and 
taxpayers, have a right to them. 
</P>
<P>
The residents of Garden Grove, Huntington Beach, Santa Ana, Cypress, 
Westminster and other cities both directly and indirectly affected by the 
spraying have a vested interest in this issue that really transcends politics 
and economics: the health and welfare of their families. 
</P>
<P>
Now it is our responsibility as citizens to watch closely the actions and/or 
inactions of our state and local officials, and arm ourselves with the only 
legal weapon at our disposal: the vote.

A Wine With Great Legs 
</P>
<P>
The high price of California wine grapes is sending domestic negociants, those 
folks who buy, blend and bottle wines for distribution under their own labels, 
looking abroad -- to Yugoslavia, southern France and Chile, among other 
wine-producing countries. And one has dressed its offerings behind a pretty 
fanciful name. 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Merlot. 
</P>
<P>
The full-bodied, red varietal backing up the equally full-bodied image of 
Hollywood's former sex goddess originally came from Napa Valley, and the 1,500 
cases of the 1985 vintage sold out at $13 a bottle, reports the Wine Spectator. 
The 5,000 cases of the 1987 edition, however, sport a $9-a-bottle price tag 
with Merlot grown in the Aude region of southern France. "There just weren't 
good-quality grapes at reasonable prices in California," a Marilyn Merlot 
distributor told the periodical. 
</P>
<P>
Other California labels are tapping Yugoslav Cabernet Sauvignon (Canterbury, 
$5.50), and Cannon Wines of San Francisco is blending wines mainly from the 
Aude with California to smooth out differences in French vintages. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe French negociants will counter with a California wine, properly aged, and 
labeled Brigitte Bordeaux. . . . 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Destructive Harvests 
</P>
<P>
One hope for market incentives to save dwindling tropical forests dimmed 
recently with the release of a report by two American researchers. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists had long advocated wild and cultivated fruit harvesting as a 
forest industry that would preserve the trees and still provide jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, as Alwyn H. Gentry and Rodolfo Vasquez of the Missouri Botanical 
Garden found in Peruvian forests, while fruit trees grown for local consumption 
are tended and preserved, fruits taken from the wild for export are often 
harvested by the cheapest, most destructive means -- simply felling the trees. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easier to cut the trees down than it is to climb them," Gentry told a 
reporter for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. "When they get that harvest 
mentality, they wipe out the forests." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shopping for Responsibility 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 edition of "Shopping for a Better World," the Council on Economic 
Priorities' guide to "socially responsible supermarket shopping," is out and 
about. 
</P>
<P>
It comes in vest-pocket and standard paperback sizes, and rates 168 companies 
and their more than 1,800 products on everything from environmental 
responsibility to race relations. 
</P>
<P>
Getting the best marks are companies including Avon, Celestial Seasonings, 3M, 
Kellogg, Procter &amp; Gamble, Polaroid, Eastman Kodak and Sara Lee. 
</P>
<P>
On the less happy end of the scale are Kimberly Clark, Reynolds Metals, Castle 
&amp; Cooke and others. 
</P>
<P>
The council also reports that more companies provided more detailed information 
this year and had improved ratings. The large guide is published by Ballantine 
Books, the compact version by the council (800-822-6435).

INTEREST RATES PIVOT ON JAPAN'S ROLE IN AUCTION; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: EXPERTS WILL BE CLOSELY MONITORING JAPANESE BUYING AND YIELDS OF 
TREASURY NOTES AND BONDS THIS WEEK. THE RESULTS COULD HAVE IMPORTANT 
IMPLICATIONS FOR THE HOUSING AND STOCK MARKETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. investors and consumers, hoping for lower interest rates ahead, once again 
find themselves at the mercy of the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury will auction a total of $30 billion in notes and bonds this week 
in the federal government's quarterly financing binge. And as usual, the debate 
on Wall Street has focused on whether the Japanese will buy their traditional 
25% to 35% of the securities -- and what yields they'll demand. 
</P>
<P>
The auction comes at a critical juncture for the bond market and for interest 
rates generally. Long-term rates here and overseas jumped in January, taking 
many investors by surprise. The closely watched 30-year Treasury bond yield 
closed at 8.50% Friday, up more than a half-percentage point from 7.97% at 
year-end 1989. 
</P>
<P>
That has pushed other long-term rates higher -- such as mortgage rates -- 
raising fears that the housing market will slump further. The rate surge has 
also pummeled the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a scary time," admits David Hale, economist at Kemper Financial Services 
in Chicago. And against that backdrop, the Federal Reserve's policy-making arm 
meets Tuesday and Wednesday to review its credit stance -- and to decide 
whether the economy is weak enough to warrant pushing short-term interest rates 
lower. Those rates have remained relatively stable over the past month. 
</P>
<P>
Hale and many other experts believe that the January surge in long-term rates 
was an overreaction to inflation jitters and overseas rate hikes and that rates 
soon will ease again. The yields that investors will demand on Treasury notes 
and bonds to be sold Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday -- $10 billion each in 
3-year, 10-year and 30-year securities, respectively -- shouldn't be much 
higher than current levels, many experts say. If so, that should lend more 
credence to the idea that rates have peaked for now. 
</P>
<P>
What the optimists are betting on: first, that Japanese investors are likely to 
buy their usual share of the Treasury securities, even though the spread 
between U.S. and Japanese interest rates has narrowed over the past month. 
</P>
<P>
Ten-year Japanese government bonds now yield 6.4%, compared to about 8.5% on 
10-year U.S. Treasury notes. While 2 percentage points might seem like a 
handsome premium for Japanese investors, it has been far greater in recent 
years -- a necessary bonus to compensate foreign buyers for currency 
fluctuation risk. 
</P>
<P>
Given the smaller premium, "For foreign investors, you can't say the U.S. 
market looks attractive now," said Robert Brusca, economist at Nikko Securities

Nonetheless, Wall Street believes that Japanese investors will find the 
Treasury securities attractive enough, especially in light of the dollar's 
relative stability versus the yen so far this year. A survey of Japanese 
institutional investors by Japan's Nihon Keizai Shimbun news organization last 
week revealed a healthy level of interest in the Treasury auction. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the Japanese buyers, some Wall Streeters are betting that U.S. 
institutional investors will be active bidders at the auction. "I think dealers 
have already brought interest rates up to where institutions here will buy," 
said David Capurro, portfolio manager at the $11-billion (assets) Franklin U.S. 
Government Securities mutual fund in San Mateo, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
"The buying will be by investors who have a choice between stocks and bonds," 
Capurro said. Considering the stock market's iffy outlook as corporate profits 
weaken, an 8.5% annual bond yield ought to look very alluring, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the auction goes well, however, a sustained drop in U.S. interest rates 
from this point depends on other factors -- in particular, whether overseas 
rates ease. Japanese and West German rates have risen partly on expectations of 
new economic booms there. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, there is a growing fear that the opening of Eastern Europe to Western 
investment will attract much Japanese money that would have flowed here. To 
keep the Japanese buying U.S. bonds, rates here may have to remain high. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, inflation worries aren't likely to subside soon. The producer price 
report for January, due out Friday, will probably show a surge in prices 
because of the December cold snap's effect on food and energy prices, 
economists say. 
</P>
<P>
While those figures may keep the Federal Reserve from easing credit at its 
meeting next week, many economists believe that the underlying weakness in the 
U.S. economy will assure a drop in rates by spring. "When you look at the 
fundamentals -- which is what the Fed will look at -- we will see lower rates," 
predicted Kathleen Cooper, chief economist at Security Pacific Corp. in Los 
Angeles.

THE RENAISSANCE OF AMERICAN SAVINGS &amp; LOAN; 
</P>
<P>
THRIFTS: ITS 1989 PROFIT IS THE ENVY OF THE INDUSTRY. BUT IT TOOK THE RESOURCES 
OF ROBERT M. BASS, THE LEADERSHIP OF MARIO J. ANTOCI AND $1.7 BILLION FROM 
TAXPAYERS TO GET THERE.

It owned a foreclosed bordello, a mine that produced a Kitty Litter-like gravel 
for cats and a collection of securities and loans that at one point were worth 
a staggering $3 billion less than their original value. 
</P>
<P>
In short, American Savings, once the nation's largest savings and loan, up 
until the end of 1988 was the thrift industry's equivalent of a huge toxic 
waste dump. It was a mess in need of a mind-boggling clean-up job, with nasty 
surprises lurking everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
What a difference a year and a $1.7-billion bailout make. A little more than 
one year after the Stockton-based savings and loan was sold by regulators to 
Texas billionaire Robert M. Bass, American is not only in the black, it's 
returning the kind of profit that most savings and loan executives dream about. 
</P>
<P>
American last week disclosed that it earned $214.2 million in 1989. No other 
thrift in California, and probably no other nationwide, is likely to report as 
large a net income figure for 1989, although comparisons are misleading because 
American doesn't pay taxes. Instead, its agreement with federal regulators 
calls for a chunk of the profit -- $64 million last year -- to be sent to a 
holding company. Most of the funds collected there over 10 years are eventually 
paid to a government agency. 
</P>
<P>
American's turnaround is partly a tribute to the hard work and drastic cost 
cutting of Chief Executive Mario J. Antoci, a well-respected manager who 
previously worked for one of American's chief rivals. Free of having to deal 
constantly with regulators, and blessed with Bass' deep financial resources, 
Antoci moved swiftly to eliminate unneeded branches and operations while 
restoring American's public image. Antoci and American also benefited from good 
timing, as falling interest rates last year boosted earnings on its loans. 
</P>
<P>
But American's profit comeback can also be laid to government generosity. 
Regulators, under pressure to dispose of weak or failed thrifts, granted 
generous concessions in 1988 and early 1989 to investors who agreed to take the 
thrifts off the government's hands. Some of these investors, including Bass, 
are among the nation's wealthiest individuals. 
</P>
<P>
Now some members of Congress, particularly House Banking Committee Chairman 
Henry B. Gonzales (D-Tex.), want to review those deals to see if the regulators 
were overly generous. The Resolution Trust Corp., the government agency created 
to sell assets of troubled thrifts, is even reviewing bid proposals from 
experts it will hire to analyze the thrift deals. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the Bass-American deal has attracted far less criticism than one by New 
York investor Ronald O. Perelman, who acquired a collection of failed Texas 
savings and loans. Some estimates have Perelman making 170% on his $160-million 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
Edwin J. Gray, former chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, now the 
Office of Thrift Supervision, argues that Bass got a great deal because 
regulators were negotiating from a position of weakness after talks with Ford 
Motor Co.'s First Nationwide unit broke down. 
</P>
<P>
"The Bass group has some of the best negotiators in the world. I think they 
kind of took the bank board to the cleaners because they got such a good deal," 
said Gray, who left his post the year before the agreement was reached and now 
is head of a Miami thrift. 
</P>
<P>
Two former bank board members who were key in negotiating the deal, Roger 
Martin and Lawrence J. White, bristle at suggestions that the agency failed to 
negotiate a good enough agreement. They note that there were no better offers, 
there was no money at the time to pay off depositors, the cost of pulling the 
plug on American would have been much higher than selling it to Bass, and the 
government benefits if American does well because it retains a 30% ownership 
stake. 
</P>
<P>
"As the years go by, history will be very good to us," said Martin, now a 
Wisconsin investment banker. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials dismiss fears among some thrift investors that they will 
renegotiate contracts extensively and make wholesale changes to the deals. 
Still, Bass and others have already found that what the government grants, it 
can take away. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, regulators, citing provisions in last year's thrift bailout bill, 
wiped out some $300 million of American's capital, the financial cushion that 
thrifts maintain to protect against losses. That capital came in the form of 
various accounting sweeteners that it had been given in the deal. Eliminating 
them will make it more difficult for American to pursue expansion plans. 
</P>
<P>
Although Bass didn't make out as well as Perelman apparently did, Bass clearly 
cut a good deal. The cost to taxpayers of the bailout was $1.7 billion, and the 
government took American's problem assets and put them into a so-called bad 
bank whose assets are being sold over time. In contrast, Bass spent $400 
million of his own money on the deal -- $350 million into the thrift and $50 
million in acquisition costs. In return he got a 70% stake in American, with 
the government owning the other 30% for now. 
</P>
<P>
Bass' return the first year with his 70% stake: about 37.5%. It would have been 
even higher had American not made the mistake of buying nearly $500 million in 
risky junk bonds just before that market tumbled. American executives counter 
that although the S&amp;L posted a hefty return, Bass could have made a good 
profit had he chosen to put his money in a number of other investments. Bass is 
not pocketing his profit, but instead is reinvesting it into the thrift. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the return is the result of the frenetic work in the first year by 
Antoci, 55, a former accountant who spent 21 years with H. F. Ahmanson and its 
Home Savings of America thrift. Antoci, who was Ahmanson's president and chief 
operating officer, was recruited by the Bass group as American's chief 
executive. He in turn raided nearly every major thrift for talent and hired two 
consulting firms to comb through American's operations looking for fat. 
</P>
<P>
"Every single department had one of these guys in a blue suit take a look at 
it," Antoci said. 
</P>
<P>
He concedes that scrutiny hurt morale and caused hard feelings. But it also 
turned up a lot of potential savings, such as branches down the street from 
each other that could be combined or two separate loan servicing offices 
instead of one. 
</P>
<P>
In one case, Antoci found that the company had hired a computer firm to perform 
data processing work that had been done in house. Trouble was, the in-house 
data processing department stayed put, even reworking at night the numbers 
provided by the outside contractor. Such inefficiencies were common. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know it was as bad as it was until I got there," said Antoci, who 
runs American from the thrift's administrative offices in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, payroll was cut by about 400 workers, to 4,783. Cuts were so deep that 
one job that was eliminated belonged to a son of William J. Popejoy, an 
American director and the man who headed the operation through its turmoil in 
the pre-Bass days. Expenses fell from $2.15 for every $100 in assets when 
Antoci took over at the end of 1988 to $1.78 by the end of last year. He hopes 
to cut that figure to $1.50 by the end of next year. 
</P>
<P>
Repairing American's tattered image was an equally difficult challenge. 
</P>
<P>
American was once one of California's most conservative thrifts under the 
leadership of financier S. Mark Taper, who probably is best known as the 
founding father of the Mark Taper Forum theater. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, American was merged into Financial Corp. of America, led by Charles W. 
Knapp. Knapp combined American with his Stockton-based State Savings &amp; Loan 
and turned the thrift into one of the nation's highest-flying savings and 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
Fueled by high-rate deposits from Wall Street "money brokers," Knapp financed 
speculative real estate ventures and securities purchases. In 1984, he was 
ousted by regulators after the Securities and Exchange Commission forced FCA to 
restate its earnings to show a huge loss, which triggered a $7-billion run on 
deposits. 
</P>
<P>
Antoci moved quickly to change the name from American Savings &amp; Loan to 
American Savings Bank, shunning the tarnished savings-and-loan label as many 
other thrifts have done. 
</P>
<P>
American also exploited a less-than-scientific survey published in California 
Business magazine that identified American Savings as tops in "consumer 
banking" among S&amp;Ls. No matter that only 122 out of 1,000 readers returned 
the survey. The result was what Antoci needed, and he based an entire 
advertising campaign on it. 
</P>
<P>
He also got rid of high-rate deposits from money brokers, lowered its rates for 
certificates of deposit to levels in line with other thrifts and originated $3 
billion in loans, mostly home loans that adjust every month, which protects an 
S&amp;L against fluctuating interest rates. Antoci initially found that only 
20% of American's home loans were adjustable and many didn't change for six 
months. Now 73% are adjustable, and they rise and fall monthly based on 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Antoci makes it a point not to blame Popejoy, who now works for Bass, noting 
that he had his hands full dealing with regulators and was short of money to 
make all of the necessary changes. Instead, he said, he found operations that 
former chief Charles Knapp had failed to consolidate in 1983 when he combined 
American Savings with State Savings. 
</P>
<P>
"He merged them financially, but not functionally," Antoci said. 
</P>
<P>
Some competitors quietly complain that Bass and American got a sweet deal. But 
others say they admire how quickly Antoci has reshaped the thrift. 
</P>
<P>
"American appears to be a tough, rational competitor. Mario's reputation has 
always been outstanding," said Herbert M. Sandler, chairman of Oakland-based 
Golden West Financial, parent of competitor World Savings. 
</P>
<P>
How much will Bass make in the future? Experts say the first-year results may 
be an exception for several reasons. One is that American receives interest 
income from the "bad bank" split off from American as part of the Bass deal, 
and the rate at which they receive that income decreases over time. Also, 
housing sales have slowed, and thus so has mortgage lending. 
</P>
<P>
Martin, the former Home Loan Bank Board member, said the rate of return on 
Bass' investment may decrease to 20% to 25%, about what Martin said he 
originally expected but still a healthy return. 
</P>
<P>
The other question is whether Bass wants to keep American. Some experts, 
including thrift consultant Bert Ely of Alexandria, Va., suggest that Bass may 
find it hard to resist cashing out in a few years. 
</P>
<P>
"My impression is that American will be sold eventually. It looks like a 
venture capital deal," Ely said. 
</P>
<P>
A Bass spokesman, however, strongly denies such speculation, citing two 
reasons. First, executives recruited at American have been promised that Bass 
is a long-term investor. Second, the tax benefits that Bass enjoys from the 
purchase cannot be transferred to a new owner.

Home Affordability Gap Growing: Home prices rose faster than home buyers' 
incomes in 1989 for the 14th straight year, a new study concludes. 
</P>
<P>
The Chicago Title &amp; Trust Co. said its annual survey of home buyers also 
revealed that the majority of 1989 home buyers were two-income couples who 
saved for an average of 2.9 years for a down payment. Nationally, the median 
home price rose 6.4% to $129,800, while the median household income of 1989 
home buyers rose 6.3% to $58,700. Median home prices were highest in San 
Francisco at $199,900, followed by Los Angeles, $187,500, Orange County, 
$166,300, and New York City, $166,200.

Insurer Sues Over Proposition 103: Metropolitan Property &amp; Liability 
Insurance Co. filed suit Thursday against state Insurance Commissioner Roxani 
M. Gillespie seeking to overturn her regulations enacting the Proposition 103 
rate-cutting initiative. 
</P>
<P>
The suit seeks to stop her from enforcing the freeze on car insurance rates or 
the emergency regulations issued last December as "unconstitutional, void and 
unenforceable." Metropolitan says its auto insurance rates were 20% to 40% 
lower than those of major companies before Gillespie imposed the freeze in 
October. (Filed Feb. 1, 1990. Case No. C751034)

JAPAN EDGING OUT U.S., EUROPE FOR ECONOMIC INFLUENCE IN ASIA; 
</P>
<P>
POWER: THE NEED FOR CAPITAL, TECHNOLOGY AND GOVERNMENT AID IS FORCING SOME 
COUNTRIES IN THE REGION TO FORGE NEW ALLIANCES AT THE EXPENSE OF MORE 
TRADITIONAL TIES. BUT WESTERN COUNTRIES ARE NOT OUT OF THE PICTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Operating in the fastest-growing region on Earth, Japanese businessmen are 
seizing opportunities in East Asia that many of their Western rivals are 
failing to grasp. The position of European and U.S. companies is strong in East 
Asia, but it is weakening daily -- diluted by the flow of Japanese capital, 
technology, trade and government aid. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the battles are largely being fought in the corporate arena. But with 
tensions between the West and communist countries easing, economic conflicts 
between the West and Japan are becoming increasingly political. East Asian 
countries, once mostly colonized by the Europeans and later strongly under the 
influence of the United States, may be increasingly forced to choose between 
these older links and their newer ones with Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese officials are beginning to acknowledge the true scale of the country's 
regional influence. In an unusually frank report last year, the government's 
Economic Planning Agency said: "The position of the U.S. has dropped in 
relative terms. . . . Japan's position has risen dramatically." 
</P>
<P>
Others put it more bluntly. "Americans, British, French all make a lot of 
noise. But the Japanese are the real power in Asia," said K. C. Kwok, an 
economist at Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai Bank in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
Some Asian countries feel threatened by Japan's resurgence, particularly those 
that harbor bitter memories of Japanese rule during World War II. But for the 
most part they are prepared to swallow their pride in the hope of sharing the 
rewards of Japan's vast wealth -- a hope that in many countries is already 
being fulfilled. "Japan is the only country capable of supplying resources to 
the region," said Ali Wardhana, a former Indonesian Cabinet minister. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's first postwar investments in the region were made to secure supplies of 
raw materials, principally from Indonesia. This was followed in the 1970s and 
early 1980s by waves of investment mainly in the newly industrialized economies 
(NIEs) -- South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore -- designed to enter 
their markets through import-substitution and to establish export bases. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1985, the rise of the yen has forced Japanese companies to redouble their 
efforts. With wages and currencies climbing in the NIEs, Japanese interest has 
focused on the members of the Assn. of South East Asian Nations. Of these, 
Thailand had been the main target for the past two years; now it is Indonesia 
and Malaysia. 
</P>
<P>
Low labor costs are the main impetus. Early last year, a skilled worker's wages 
in Singapore were 20% of those in Tokyo, according to Mitsui Research 
Institute. For Bangkok, the figure was 10% and for Jakarta, 4%. Japanese 
industrialists expect these gaps to close, but not for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese influence varies greatly between countries. But by most macroeconomic 
measures, the Japanese have overtaken the Europeans and are fast catching up 
with the Americans. According to the Nomura Research Institute, Japan takes 25% 
-- the biggest share -- of ASEAN's exports, principally oil and gas and raw 
materials. For the NIEs, the United States is the preeminent market, accounting 
for 31% of exports in 1988. But Japanese imports from Asia are growing fast: by 
20% last year to $88 billion. Meanwhile, Japan has long been East Asia's 
biggest import source, supplying vital machinery and office equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Japan overtook the United States in the mid-1980s as the largest provider of 
foreign capital to the region. In the year to March, 1989, Japan's flow of 
direct investment to Asia was $5.6 billion, compared to $1.4 billion in 1985. 
The nearest comparable figure for the United States (for the calendar year 
1988) was $2.3 billion. Japanese investment in the United States and Europe is 
greater than in Asia. But relative to the size of the region's economies, the 
Asian investments are huge -- four times more for Thailand than for the United 
States, for example. 
</P>
<P>
As for government aid, Japan, the world's largest donor, provides 60% of Asia's 
official development assistance -- a sum that accounts for about 60% of Japan's 
aid budget. The microeconomic details are just as compelling. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese banks account for 56% of bank deposits in Hong Kong; Japanese 
department stores have 30% of the colony's retail sales. At night the names of 
Japanese companies in neon lights illuminate Hong Kong's harbor. In Malaysia, 
one Japanese company, Toray, accounts for a quarter of the nation's textile 
exports. In Thailand, most of the cars clogging Bangkok streets are made at 
local Japanese-run assembly plants. 
</P>
<P>
Western companies are by no means out of the race. Many Western companies in 
East Asia are at least as strong as the Japanese. Exxon, Shell, British 
Petroleum and other Western oil groups dominate oil and gas exploration and 
production. IBM is the biggest supplier of large computers. The top companies 
in chemicals and pharmaceuticals include Du Pont of the United States, the 
British group ICI and BASF of West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese bankers may have the deepest pockets, but other banks have better 
connections -- including Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai Bank, Standard Chartered Bank 
and Deutsche Bank. However, U.S. and European executives concede that overall 
they are not matching the Japanese effort. "Japanese don't necessarily see 
opportunities first, but pursue them more actively," said Martin Barrow, a 
director of Jardine Matheson, the Hong Kong trading house. 
</P>
<P>
Politicians often feel the same way. Chatichai Choonhavan, the Thai prime 
minister, recently said: "You Americans don't compete enough with the Japanese. 
I don't want my children to speak Japanese. I want them to speak English." 
</P>
<P>
Some Japanese say their biggest competitors in Asia are not Westerners but 
other Asians, especially internationally minded Korean, Taiwanese and overseas 
Chinese businessmen, such as Y. K. Pao and Li Kashing, the heads of two of Hong 
Kong's biggest trading houses, and the chiefs of the large Korean 
conglomerates, Samsung, Hyundai, Daewoo and Lucky-Goldstar. 
</P>
<P>
Western executives say Japanese companies are succeeding for the same reason as 
elsewhere -- a willingness to think long term. Tom White, chairman of the 
Asia-Pacific Council of American Chambers of Commerce, said: "I don't subscribe 
to the view that U.S. and European companies are out of it. But the Japanese 
are more aggressive. They can get cheap capital. We can't." 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese acknowledge that East Asian markets are often small, but they look 
at the growth rates achieved over the past decade and extrapolate them into the 
1990s. Senior Japanese executives in activities as diverse as banking, motors, 
electronics and hotels expect East Asia to generate an increasing proportion of 
their international profits. 
</P>
<P>
By melding Japanese managers, technicians and machines with low-cost local 
workers, Japanese companies are producing increasingly advanced goods for 
export. Mitsubishi Motor exports Proton cars from Malaysia to the United 
Kingdom and Lancers from Thailand to Canada. This year it is considering 
exporting station wagons to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
There is nothing new about transferring labor-intensive work overseas to 
low-wage countries. Japanese industry has only about 5% of its production 
overseas, compared to 20% for the United States. But Japan is likely to catch 
up; the Ministry of International Trade and Industry estimates key sectors, 
including autos, machine tools and industrial electronics, could have from 30% 
to 50% of their output abroad by 1995-2000. Consumer electricals could point 
the way; 90% of Japan's fans are already made abroad as are 60% to 65% of its 
radios and radio cassettes. 
</P>
<P>
The corporate giants are being followed by their parts makers. Japanese 
companies are particularly persistent in keeping control of the manufacturing 
process. Izumi Hara, an economist at the Industrial Bank of Japan, said: 
"Japanese companies never quit any product area so they do not lose technology, 
even if it means going to China to make black-and-white televisions."

SOME SAY TIMES OF TROUBLE MEAN TIME FOR GOLD; 
</P>
<P>
INVESTMENTS: PRECIOUS METALS MAY BE A GOOD BET DURING SEVERE RECESSIONS, BUT 
OVER THE LONG HAUL THEY USUALLY ONLY MIRROR THE INFLATION RATE. 
</P>

<P>
These are times for people like Howard Ruff. The stock market is in turmoil. 
The junk bond market has crashed. And people are uncertain about prospects for 
the economy, inflation and interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
In the worst of all possible worlds for investors, the U.S. economy might fall 
into stagflation -- a period of rising inflation and stagnant economic growth 
like that of the 1970s. And in the 1990s, with both the government and private 
industry weighed down with debt, stagflation could be even more difficult to 
handle. 
</P>
<P>
Ruff, who through his financial newsletter "The Ruff Times" has been telling 
readers to prepare for financial disaster for the past 14 years, believes that 
it is time to stock up on gold. 
</P>
<P>
He likes other precious metals such as silver and platinum, too, for several 
reasons. They are things you can hoard with your canned goods in times of 
economic Armageddon. And they are likely to stage a rally when the U.S. economy 
falls into a severe recession, which Ruff believes is just around the corner. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we are moving into one of the most dangerous recessions we've faced, 
certainly since 1981 and 1982, which came within a gnat's eyelash of a 
depression," he said. "And we may be moving into a recession as bad as the one 
in 1928 and 1929. Will it turn into a depression? That depends." 
</P>
<P>
Gold is a prime investment for bad times because it retains its value through 
the ages. An ounce of gold would buy a fine suit of clothes in the time of King 
Henry VIII, and it would still buy a suit at Brooks Bros. today, said Bruce 
Kaplan, president of Kaplan &amp; Co. in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Over the long haul, gold's performance generally only mirrors the inflation 
rate; it rarely exceeds it. And bullion or coins may carry storage and 
insurance costs, further trimming the total return. But when it looks as though 
inflation will wipe out gains in other investments, such as stocks, bonds and 
money market accounts, gold can be rewarding. 
</P>
<P>
Most economists don't agree with Ruff's gloomy predictions, expecting that 
growth will simply slow in 1990, not come to a grinding halt. 
</P>
<P>
Still, some industry experts believe that a number of factors have combined 
lately to make gold -- and possibly other precious metals -- a stellar 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
Not all of the factors are bad news, either. Some industry experts believe that 
price appreciation in gold and platinum will be driven, at least in part, by 
rising demand. There are indications that both the Japanese and Soviet Bloc 
countries might be interested in storing up gold, and platinum prices could 
rise because more uses are being found for it in industry. 
</P>
<P>
The argument for silver is simply that it's cheap. An ounce now sells for less 
than $5.50, compared to 10 times that when it hit its peak in 1980. In 
addition, it tends to move in conjunction with gold. So, if gold stages a 
rally, silver is likely to follow. 
</P>
<P>
In the past several months, gold and platinum have produced modest run-ups. 
Since Nov. 1, Gold prices have risen $45 an ounce to $417.95 Friday, for 
example, and platinum is up about $20 to $505. Silver, however, has risen only 
several pennies, closing Friday at $5.28, up 12 cents since Nov. 1. Gold stocks 
have risen even faster. One gold mutual fund, in fact, posted a near 65% annual 
rate of return in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Industry experts do not believe that the rally is over, either. Kaplan predicts 
that gold prices will hit $450 by year-end. And J. David Edwards, chief 
investment officer of United Services Advisors, believes that the metal will be 
worth $500 by then. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"If you are expecting dreadful inflation, gold is a tremendous thing to own," 
said Abby Cohen, chief investment strategist for Drexel Burnham Lambert in New 
York. "But I don't think we are on the brink of high inflation." 
</P>
<P>
And even if higher inflation is a distinct possibility, there may be better 
investment options, said David Wyss, chief financial economist with 
DRI/McGraw-Hill. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of any investor's portfolio should be in real assets, whether that is 
gold or land or Oriental rugs," Wyss said. "I don't like gold as an investment 
because there are very few times in history that it's out-performed other 
investments."

'BER LIN' CELEBRATES MAN'S STEADFAST SPIRIT

You see it all the time in art reviews: A writer will proclaim that a 
particular work compels the viewer to do so-and-so, or think such-and-such. But 
that's just hype and blather. Artists aren't totalitarian states or the 
superego that polices your psyche. What artists can do, however, is create a 
climate that subtly influences the point of view and even the actions of those 
who choose to view the work in an active, participatory way and then reflect on 
the experience. 
</P>
<P>
At the Laguna Art Museum's South Coast Plaza satellite, Paul Kos' group of six 
installations -- collectively called "BER LIN" -- incorporates certain physical 
and psychological mechanisms designed to involve the viewer in the artist's 
concerns about freedom and constraint. Commissioned by the museum especially 
for this gallery space, "BER LIN" is by far the most searchingly intelligent 
and provocative show ever mounted there. 
</P>
<P>
Other than the neon letters spelling out the title of the installation (divided 
to represent the division of the city into East and West sectors by the Berlin 
Wall), the piece that a viewer is first likely to encounter is "rEVOLUTION: 
Notes for the Invasion -- mar mar march." Slats of wood cross the carpet at 
regular intervals. If you choose to enter the gallery, the length of your 
stride is regulated by those slats, since the normal thing to do is to step 
between them. 
</P>
<P>
While you're stepping -- conscious of the activity of walking, as you probably 
aren't when there's nothing in the way -- you hear the sound of a typewriter 
typing in a regular rhythm. It's the aural accompaniment to a small video 
monitor with the image of a typewriter typing the words "mar mar march" over 
and over, and a woman in boots marching back and forth. 
</P>
<P>
It seems natural to match your stride to the sound -- natural, in other words, 
to "fall in" with a lock step established by the cadence of a completely 
arbitrary device. You are marching without being offered any real reason for 
doing so. 
</P>
<P>
Like Alice in Lewis Carroll's "Through the Looking Glass," you have entered a 
world that seems to have its own rules. The next stop on this journey is 
"Rift," a piece that doesn't work as well as it should because of its awkward 
placement in the gallery. "Rift" is simply a narrow section that has been cut 
out of the gallery's wall-to-wall carpet. 
</P>
<P>
The cut is a dividing line, a break in the natural order of things. But instead 
of serving as another forceful impediment, it doesn't really intrude on the 
viewer's path. You can walk around it -- and dismiss it -- too easily as you 
look up at the next element in Kos' master plan: "Just a Matter of Time." 
</P>
<P>
There, a red light beams on a row of cuckoo clocks, each ticking away in an 
independent rhythm, like people whispering in a crowd. Instead of the usual 
weights for the clock movements, hammers and sickles dangle on metal chains. At 
seemingly random intervals, a clock will sound. 
</P>
<P>
These irregular bursts of activity seem to be metaphors for the "voice" of the 
human spirit, speaking out -- as we've seen in the past few months in Eastern 
Europe -- to demand its freedom. 
</P>
<P>
At the rear of the gallery, "Silenced Tongues" -- conceived as a response to 
the Tian An Men Square massacre in China last spring -- expands on Kos' overall 
theme with strikingly minimal means. The outlines of bells are etched on two 
large sheets of glass that lean against the gallery walls, illuminated by a 
low-hanging naked light bulb. 
</P>
<P>
Etched on a third sheet of glass is the phrase, "When tongues are silenced only 
memory remains." The words repeat twice -- via a shadow effect -- on the wall 
behind the glass. When you step in front of the glass, your body obliterates 
one of the phrases but not the other two. 
</P>
<P>
Kos' gorgeously subtle use of glass, light and line creates an apt metaphor for 
the workings of memory: seemingly fragile yet vivid and strong. The subtle 
orchestration of allusions to sound and silence and the use of shadow effects 
as visual "reverberations" give the piece a meditative quality. 
</P>
<P>
The viewer's final encounter is likely to be with "Trotsky." A red stool stands 
on the gallery floor. High overhead, a pickax tied with a red cloth is stuck 
into the wall. The reference is to Soviet leader's 1940 murder by an 
ax-wielding Spanish Communist while in exile in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
A principal figure in the 1917 October Revolution who served as commissar for 
foreign affairs and war under Lenin, Trotsky began to speak out against 
repressive tendencies in the party in the early '20s. He was denounced by the 
Stalinist government and ultimately -- in 1929 -- banished from his country. 
This piece is the most specifically history-bound of the six works, 
crystallizing the underlying issue of a political state conceived as a tool of 
freedom for the common man but subsequently manipulated into a tool of 
oppression. 
</P>
<P>
Kos has said that he thinks of the six installations in the gallery as merely 
the "Eastern sector" of "BER LIN," which "includes every store and shop in 
South Coast Plaza." In other words, issues of freedom and repression are as 
relevant to the world of dazzling choice represented by a giant shopping mall 
as they are to countries struggling out of the yoke of communism. An obsession 
with material goods can blind us to the preciousness of the freedoms we have, 
as well as to elements of our society who want to distort them in the name of 
narrow-minded "morality." 
</P>
<P>
 "BER LIN" continues at the Laguna Art Museum South Coast Plaza satellite, 3333 
Bristol St. in Costa Mesa, through April 29. Hours: 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Mondays 
through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturdays, and 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sundays.

BIG DADDY KANE SETS A VERY RAP-ID PACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Fast action and force of personality are what count most on a live rap stage, 
and Big Daddy Kane was a force unleashed at gale speed as he topped a bill of 
three high-charting New York rappers Friday night at the Celebrity Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Too many rap acts haven't the foggiest idea of how to pace a show. They'll 
wander aimlessly, starting and stopping songs at random, letting the whole 
proceeding slide into a trough. Kane has found a better way. Instead of just 
swiping bits and pieces from James Brown records, like virtually every rapper 
on earth, he seems to have absorbed the gist of Brown's formula for live 
performance: Make it frenzied, and keep the action coming nonstop. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the 37-minute set the frenzy was formless. Kane, in a three-piece 
suit, roamed the rim of the circular, spinning stage, spitting out rapid-fire 
rhymes that were too quick-paced to absorb for anyone who hadn't memorized his 
records. 
</P>
<P>
Two bodyguards followed him everywhere, while male dancers named Scrap Lover 
and Scoob Lover leaped and bounded together. For the first few minutes, the 
crew projected a raw energy geared to heat up the crowd, rather than making any 
pointed rap statements. The sellout audience, a ready and responsive ally for 
Kane and the two previous acts, Biz Markie and MC Lyte, didn't require much 
warming up. 
</P>
<P>
With disc jockey Mister Cee switching the beat from song to song without pause, 
the show gathered momentum and took shape. Kane joined his two dancers for hot 
workouts showcasing whirlwind solo moves and athletic unison steps. On "Raw," a 
brag-rap that rehashes the most overworked rapper's theme -- "I am the 
greatest" -- Kane backed up the boasting with a commanding, imperious baritone. 
</P>
<P>
He worked guest rappers into the show (Grandmaster Kaz and an under-amplified, 
ski-capped Ice Cube, from the controversial N.W.A.) without bogging it down. 
And he brought substance to the proceedings with such socially conscious 
numbers as the black-pride rap "Ain't No Stopping Us Now," playing his own 
lines off the audience's chorus sing-along. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately -- with a capital U -- Kane was at his most emphatic in 
delivering a vile couplet that broadcast his hatred for homosexuals. One can 
only hope that some clear, brave voices will emerge in hip hop, heavy metal and 
other branches of pop music to answer this kind of bigotry. 
</P>
<P>
One of Kane's black-pride raps makes a big deal over a black being chosen Miss 
America, but his hater's approach to gays would disown a cultural giant like 
James Baldwin because of how he chose to lead his private life. Pathetic. 
</P>
<P>
Biz Markie (pronounced "marquee"), a boyhood buddy of Kane's, also succeeded in 
conveying some personality and (aided considerably by that receptive, 
eager-to-participate crowd) in maintaining a house-rocking energy level. 
</P>
<P>
Biz is to rap what the Coasters were to '50s rock 'n' roll -- a likable clown 
whose act is built on jokes and novelties. He milked his current hit single, 
"Just a Friend," for all it was worth, leading the audience in crooned chorus 
after chorus in his off-key bellow of a non-singing voice. 
</P>
<P>
Biz's other enjoyable gimmicks were a human-beat box routine, in which he 
mimicked vocally the sound of drumbeats and record scratching, and an 
arm-flapping dance, the "Mudd Foot," that was just like the dancing-fool shtick 
that B.B. King's trumpet player has been doing for years. 
</P>
<P>
With his sputtering, mumbly delivery, the hulking Biz isn't the world's 
sharpest rapper, and with such gross-humor topics as mucus and bad breath, he 
isn't exactly socially significant. But that unsinkable clownish instinct kept 
the Biz Mark's 28-minute set steadily afloat. 
</P>
<P>
With memorable, intelligently pointed story-songs such as "I Cram to Understand 
U" and "Cappucino," female rapper MC Lyte's peak material is several cuts above 
anything by Big Daddy Kane, Biz Markie and most other rappers. But Lyte left 
those stories untold, and largely abdicated control of her choppy, pause-filled 
set to her crew of bump-and-grind male dancers, who kept stripping to their 
bikini briefs in an attempt to turn the show into a Chippendale's routine. It 
was all a planned gag, with the demure, white-clad Lyte playing the 
disapproving straight woman to her rampant buddies' hip-hop satyrs. 
</P>
<P>
There aren't many strong females in rap, and it's a shame that one of the few 
there are let the boys in the band overshadow her with insipid antics. It would 
have been far better had Lyte, who has a sharp, effective rap delivery, taken 
control and projected her own personality and her own idea of sexuality. 
Instead of making her own mark, Lyte's lightweight set seemed geared to warming 
up the crowd for the male rappers who followed. 
</P>
<P>
Other drawbacks were a bombastic introduction, in which a recorded voice 
ominously intoned the opening verses of Genesis ("Let there be light"), and 
Lyte's occasional use of a backing track of her own voice to echo and double 
her live raps.

BOB HAGGART STILL MAKES A BIG NOISE; 
</P>
<P>
JAZZ: THE VETERAN BASSIST IS ENTERING HIS SEVENTH DECADE AS AN ENTERTAINER. 
AND, BETWEEN PAINTING PICTURES IN HIS LA COSTA HOME, HE'S GOING STRONG.

Bob Haggart had no idea he was writing an '80s pop hit when, in 1939, he penned 
"I'm Free," a song about being newly married and free from chronic loneliness. 
</P>
<P>
Haggart's song was recorded by Bob Crosby's big band, with Haggart on bass. A 
few months later, California songwriter Johnny Burke put lyrics to Haggart's 
tune, changed the name to "What's New," and handed it to Bing Crosby. 
</P>
<P>
After Crosby recorded it, Haggart's piece, with its complex melodic and 
harmonic shifts, provided a challenge to musicians such as Benny Goodman, Ella 
Fitzgerald and Charlie Parker. On tape, Haggart has compiled about 3 1/2 hours 
worth of versions of the song. 
</P>
<P>
But he didn't strike gold until Linda Ronstadt recorded an album of American 
popular music in the mid-'80s with conductor/arranger Nelson Riddle. They 
included "What's New" and named the album after it. The project sold more than 
2 million copies, and Haggart still receives quarterly royalty checks. 
</P>
<P>
"I finally met her at the Sands Hotel in Atlantic City when she went to accept 
a plaque from ASCAP (the American Society of Composers and Publishers) honoring 
the album. I went up and said, 'I've got to kiss you, ever since the record 
came out.' Well, she's very shy. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, kiss her he did, and Haggart, 75, hinted that the experience was 
memorable. 
</P>
<P>
Ronstadt's version of his song may not be his favorite, but he says "I'm very 
happy about the whole thing. I'm smiling all the way to the bank." 
</P>
<P>
Ronstadt's "What's New" has been Haggart's single largest financial success in 
a musical career about to enter its seventh decade. 
</P>
<P>
He says it afforded him the large condominium he bought in La Costa three years 
ago, where the walls are lined with his still life and Mexican landscape 
paintings and where, on a recent afternoon, he talked about his life and music. 
</P>
<P>
The bassist is recognized by musicians and jazz fans as a top player. He's 
performed at the White House for several presidents. 
</P>
<P>
Music seemed to come naturally to the young Haggart. During his school years, 
he played guitar, tuba and trumpet before picking up a lonely bass in the band 
room during his junior year. 
</P>
<P>
"We were wedded once I felt that bass, the way it vibrates on the low notes. 
It's the power in an orchestra. It controls the beat and harmony." 
</P>
<P>
Artie Bernstein, a prominent '30s big band bassist, and Pop Foster, who played 
bass behind trumpeter Louis Armstrong, were the first bass players who made an 
impression on Haggart. 
</P>
<P>
"I started getting jobs right away. My dad wanted me to go into the hosiery 
business like him. But I didn't want to be a salesman." 
</P>
<P>
What he did want was to be a painter as well as a jazz musician. Immediately 
after high school, he studied painting for two years at the Art Students League 
in New York, a respected art school. Over the years, he has continued to paint, 
spending winters through the late '70s and early '80s at San Miguel de Allende 
in central Mexico, where there is an artists' colony. 
</P>
<P>
After art school, Haggart joined a jazz band that played Nassau in the winter, 
East Coast resorts in summer and a New Jersey roadhouse in between. 
</P>
<P>
In 1935, drummer Ben Pollack's band had abandoned him in search of a more 
prominent leader. Bob Crosby was chosen, and Haggart, who had been highly 
spoken of by Glenn Miller and Jimmy Dorsey, auditioned successfully for the 
bass spot. Benny Goodman, Jack Teagarden and drummer Ray Bauduc were among his 
new associates. 
</P>
<P>
"We broke the band in June 4, 1935, at the Roseland Ballroom in New York City," 
Haggart said. "Then we went on a one-nighter tour of the Deep South, by bus." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't long before Bauduc and Haggart spontaneously created a hit. 
</P>
<P>
One Sunday afternoon at the Blackhawk Restaurant in Chicago, the Crosby band 
had a few minutes to kill before going live on the radio. The dance floor was 
packed with enthusiastic kids from Winnetka, an affluent Chicago suburb. Crosby 
stepped up to the mike and told the audience that Bobby Haggart and Ray Bauduc 
would play "Big Noise From Winnetka" in honor of their fans. 
</P>
<P>
No such song existed. 
</P>
<P>
"We made it up as we went along," Haggart said, recalling how he whistled the 
tune before the song climaxed with Bauduc playing up and down the neck of 
Haggart's bass as he fingered the notes. Two weeks later, they went into a 
studio to record it, and Haggart was able to recall the melody. 
</P>
<P>
World War II broke up the Crosby band in 1942, and Haggart moved to New York 
City, where he worked as a studio player until 1968, recording with several 
jazz musicians and playing in television bands for Perry Como and Johnny 
Carson. 
</P>
<P>
During his career, Haggart was well aware of such jazz revolutionaries as John 
Coltrane, Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker. He has mixed feelings about their 
work. 
</P>
<P>
"I was fascinated by Parker and Gillespie. As an arranger, I understood what 
Charlie Parker was trying to do harmonically. I was amazed by his dexterity and 
technique. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe in simplicity. They start kids off today with Coltrane, his waves of 
notes. I think it's a shame for kids to start using him as their idol, trying 
to do what he did on tenor. I prefer Zoot Sims to Coltrane any day." 
</P>
<P>
Haggart keeps an active touring schedule, including frequent jazz festival 
work. On a recent weekend he was in Las Vegas as part of a "Jazz at the 
Riviera" festival with trumpeter Yank Lawson, a fellow veteran of Crosby's 
band, San Diego clarinetist Bobby Gordon and several others. 
</P>
<P>
Haggart still wields a mean bass. At home, he practices almost every day on an 
antique French instrument that has a hand-carved woman's head above the tuning 
pegs. 
</P>
<P>
"For every day you don't play, you slip two days," Haggart explained. 
</P>
<P>
Frequently, he plays Diego's Loft in Pacific Beach behind trumpeter John Best, 
also a big band musician in the '30s, and Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
And he often steps up to the mike to whistle "Big Noise From Winnetka," while 
drummer Jay Hearn taps out Bauduc's old part on the neck of the old bass.

BUSH CAUTIONS AGAINST GLOBAL WARMING STEPS THAT BURDEN INDUSTRY 
</P>

<P>
President Bush cautioned an international gathering of scientists today against 
seeking solutions to global warming that would burden major industries. 
</P>
<P>
Bush promised U.S. support for "aggressive and thoughtful action" to solve the 
problems posed by global warming and announced that he is calling a meeting at 
the White House this spring bringing together top environmentalists, economists 
and ecologists to grapple with the issue. 
</P>
<P>
But he sounded a note of caution against scientists and environmentalists who 
believe that the warming of the Earth's atmosphere is already serious enough to 
warrant severe antipollution controls. 
</P>
<P>
"Wherever possible we believe that market mechanism should be applied and that 
our policies must be consistent with economic growth and free market principles 
in all countries," Bush said in his address before the Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change, a U.N.-sponsored group opening a three-day meeting at 
Georgetown University. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists from the United States and Europe were quick to criticize 
Bush for not making a clear commitment to immediate action aimed at dealing 
with global warming. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a gross disappointment. There was more talk in the speech about 
economics than about the environment," said Daniel Becker of the Sierra Club. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart Boyle of the Assn. for the Conservation of Energy in Great Britain said 
Bush's remarks demonstrated "a leadership crisis" on the global warming issue 
at the White House. "About the only thing we can say about it is he turned up" 
at the conference, Boyle said. 
</P>
<P>
The cross section of environmentalists are attending the conference as 
observers. They said they would have liked to have seen Bush present specific 
U.S. commitments toward energy conservation and specific goals on reductions in 
carbon dioxide pollution, which is the major contributor to global warming. 
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Bush said, "We all know that human activities are changing the 
atmosphere in unexpected and in unprecedented ways." 
</P>
<P>
He said that "some may be tempted to exploit legitimate concerns for political 
positioning." 
</P>
<P>
"Where politics and opinion have outpaced the science, we are accelerating our 
support of the technology to bridge that gap," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu reportedly ordered changes in the 
text to mute U.S. concerns about global warming. Sununu acknowledged Sunday 
that he had made some changes, but said they were simply to make the speech 
"reflective" of Administration policy. 
</P>
<P>
Sununu also criticized "faceless" environmental bureaucrats he said want to 
force Americans to give up their cars.

A man shot and killed his wife early today in their mid-city apartment, 
reported the slaying to police and then fatally shot himself, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither the man nor the woman who died in the incident after midnight were 
immediately identified, pending notification of their relatives. Both were 
believed to be in their 50s. 
</P>
<P>
The man called the 911 emergency line about 12:40 a.m., saying he had shot his 
wife and was going to kill himself. He then hung up. Police and paramedics sent 
to the apartment at 716 S. Harvard Blvd. found the two bodies. No motive for 
the murder-suicide had been determined, police said.

In a finding that could undermine President Bush's plan to cut capital gains 
taxes, a House committee report said today that during the 1980s, the rich paid 
lower taxes on more income, while the poor felt a sharper tax bite. 
</P>
<P>
The report, based on Congressional Budget Office and other agency studies, is 
to be released Tuesday by the House Ways and Means Committee at a hearing where 
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and White House Budget Director Richard G. 
Darman are scheduled to testify. 
</P>
<P>
The report shows that the effective tax rate for the poorest 20% of American 
families rose 16.1% during the 1980s while real income rose 3.2%. 
</P>
<P>
During the same period, it says, the effective tax rate for the richest 20% of 
families dropped 5.5% while their real income rose 31.7%. 
</P>
<P>
That statistic and others in the report could add fuel to Democratic claims 
that wealthier Americans, who would benefit most from a capital gains tax cut, 
do not need or deserve another tax break.

FIFTH EX-HUD OFFICIAL BALKS AT TESTIFYING; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSING PROBE: LANTOS REOPENS INQUIRY DESPITE THORNBURGH DECISION TO SEEK 
SPECIAL PROSECUTOR.

A former HUD official invoked his constitutional rights and refused to testify 
before a House panel today as it reopened its investigation into alleged 
widespread abuses in federal housing programs. 
</P>
<P>
James Hamernick, former director of the office of insured multifamily housing, 
became the fifth former official of the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development to refuse to testify before congressional investigators. 
</P>
<P>
Hamernick cited Fifth Amendment protections against self-incrimination in 
refusing to testify. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo), chairman of the House Government Operations 
subcommittee on housing, said he had decided to resume a HUD probe despite 
Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh's decision Thursday to seek appointment of a special 
prosecutor to investigate former Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. and other 
former top housing officials. That appointment by a federal court is now 
automatic under the law. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce is among the other former officials from the Ronald Reagan 
Administration who have refused to testify. 
</P>
<P>
"As has happened in the past, most notably in the Watergate investigation . . . 
and the Iran-Contra investigation . . . there is occasionally a compelling need 
for simultaneous parallel investigations by Congress and by law enforcement," 
Lantos said, explaining his decision to proceed further after holding more than 
20 hearings last year. 
</P>
<P>
"The subcommittee is duty-bound to proceed with its investigation of abuses at 
HUD," he said. "This is particularly true since in recent weeks the 
subcommittee staff has uncovered a good deal of relevant new information." 
</P>
<P>
He declined to say what that information is. 
</P>
<P>
Hamernick refused to answer when Lantos asked him what HUD programs he 
discussed when he was entertained by Lance Wilson, a former top aide to Pierce 
who later became a housing consultant with the Wall Street firm of Paine 
Webber. Wilson reported spending more than $2,000 in that job on meals and 
other entertainment for Hamernick in expense accounts filed with his employer.

The government remains committed to segregated neighborhoods and segregated 
public schools despite President Frederik W. de Klerk's announcement of major 
political reforms, two Cabinet ministers said today. 
</P>
<P>
"Black people should be running their own education and white people should be 
running their own education," said Stoffel van der Merwe, the white official 
who oversees education for blacks. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, he said, there will be "tremendous chaos." 
</P>
<P>
Herman Kriel, minister of planning and provincial affairs, said the government 
has no plans to repeal the Group Areas Act, which mandates racial segregation 
of residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot allow the minorities that live here to be swamped by majority 
decisions," he said. "We believe community life is a right." 
</P>
<P>
The two ministers spoke at briefings for journalists covering the start of 
Parliament. On Friday, in a historic speech opening the session, De Klerk 
lifted bans on the African National Congress and other militant opposition 
groups, declared a moratorium on executions, eased restrictions on the media 
and pledged to free ANC leader Nelson R. Mandela soon. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk said his intention was to draw black leaders into negotiations on a 
constitution that would extend political rights to the black majority. He said 
Sunday the government would implement major constitutional changes only after 
white voters were allowed to convey their views. 
</P>
<P>
In a related matter, an attack on the British Embassy has increased fears that 
white extremists may begin lashing out in anger at the sweeping political 
changes proposed by De Klerk. 
</P>
<P>
Assailants shot out windows at the embassy in Pretoria on Sunday, a day after 
right-wing graffiti was spray-painted on the building. The graffiti said: "The 
Struggle Begins -- Order of the Boer (Afrikaner) People." 
</P>
<P>
Police said they have never heard of the group but are investigating. 
</P>
<P>
"It is suspected that the attack by the right-wing might have come about 
because we, the British government, have emphasized our support for the 
decisions announced by President De Klerk," embassy spokesman John Sawyer said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Right-wing whites accused the president of capitulating to the country's black 
majority and have vowed to resist the changes. 
</P>
<P>
Robert von Tonder, leader of a group that seeks a whites-only homeland, said De 
Klerk's changes could lead to the formation of an underground guerrilla 
movement for whites.

Honda Motor Co. is considering a request by Chrysler Corp. to market the 
American manufacturer's automobiles in Japan, a Honda spokesman said today. 
</P>
<P>
Honda spokesman Hitoshi Dewa said Chrysler suggested the two companies set up a 
joint venture. All other details, including the Chrysler models, number of 
sales and distribution channels in Japan have yet to be finalized, Dewa said. 
</P>
<P>
Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's largest business journal, said Honda will 
concentrate on selling 5,000-6,000 Chrysler Jeeps and Cherokees a year through 
one of Honda's three distribution networks in Japan. The newspaper said an 
agreement was expected later this year.

RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. today reported a loss for the final quarter and all 
of 1989, reflecting the cost of going private through a $24.5-billion leveraged 
buyout by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
For the three months ended Dec. 31, RJR Nabisco lost $144 million, compared 
with a $411-million profit in the 1988 quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Sales totaled $3.54 billion, unchanged from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
The consumer products giant lost $1.5 billion for the entire year and had sales 
of $12.76 billion. That compared with a $1.4-billion profit the previous year 
on $12.64 billion in sales. 
</P>
<P>
RJR Nabisco blamed the negative results on significantly higher net interest 
expenses, its decision to eliminate excess tobacco trade inventories and costs 
related to the KKR acquisition, which was finalized in early 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the losses, which were expected, Chairman Louis V. Gerstner Jr. said 
the company was making fundamental improvements and had steady operating 
results in its tobacco and food units. 
</P>
<P>
The strength of the company's business, and in turn, its cash flow, is crucial 
for the success of the buyout, which was accomplished partly through the sale 
of $4 billion in junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
RJR Nabisco's products include Oreo cookies, Ritz crackers and Winston 
cigarettes.

The Chevrolet Corvette has the highest death rate in crashes, while a four-door 
Volvo has the lowest, according to a study released today. 
</P>
<P>
The study shows that 5.2 drivers and passengers die in car wrecks for every 
10,000 1985-87 Corvettes registered in the United States. It also found that 
the Volvo 740-760 four-door had 0.6 deaths per 10,000 vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
The figures from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety were released by 
the Michigan Assn. of Professional Insurance Agents. 
</P>
<P>
"Without question the consumer has a better chance of survival when driving a 
larger vehicle," said James Alexander, president of the Michigan association. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 10 vehicles with the lowest death rates, three were large, six were 
mid-size and only one was a small car -- the Volkswagen Jetta with 1.1 deaths 
per 10,000 vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve of the 15 cars with the highest death rates are small, and the other 
three are midsize. Several, including the Corvette at the top of the list, are 
high-performance cars. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Mitchell, a spokesman for the association, said high-performance cars tend 
to have higher death rates because of the type of drivers they attract. 
</P>
<P>
"The study shows there's a direct correlation between high-performance sports 
models and a higher accident death rate," he said. "The Corvette, Camaro, 
Mustang, Firebird and Dodge Daytona were all in the top 10 in terms of highest 
overall death rate. 
</P>
<P>
"The average driver in those cars is a man under 30 years old," he said. 
"Industry figures show that cars with a higher percentage of female drivers 
tend to have lower death rates." 
</P>
<P>
Following is a list of the 1985-87 models with the lowest and the highest death 
rates. The figures in parentheses refer to the number of driver and passenger 
deaths per 10,000 vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
10 Lowest Death Rates -- Volvo 740-760 four-door (0.6), Ford Taurus station 
wagon (0.7), Lincoln Town Car (0.8), Audi 5000 four-door (1.1), Cadillac 
Fleetwood DeVille four-door (1.1), Cadillac Fleetwood DeVille two-door (1.1), 
Chevrolet Cavalier station wagon (1.1), Olds Cutlass Ciera station wagon (1.1), 
Toyota Cressida four-door (1.1) and Volkswagen Jetta four-door (1.1). 
</P>
<P>
15 Highest Death Rates -- Chevrolet Corvette (5.2), Chevrolet Camaro (4.9), 
Dodge Charger-Shelby (4.5), Ford Mustang (4.4), Nissan 300ZX (4.2), Chevrolet 
Chevette four-door (4.1), Chevrolet Sprint two-door (4.1), Honda Civic CRX 
(3.9), Pontiac Firebird (3.8), Plymouth Turismo (3.6), Pontiac Fiero (3.6), 
Chevrolet Chevette two-door (3.4), Chevrolet Spectrum four-door (3.2), Dodge 
Daytona two-door (3.1) and Ford Escort two-door (3.0).

The Treasury Department said today that beginning next Oct. 1, it will not 
issue $50 and $75 Series EE savings bonds through payroll savings plans, making 
$100 bonds the minimum denomination for plan participants. 
</P>
<P>
"This step is one of several initiatives that will assure the long-term 
strength of the savings bonds program by reducing administrative costs," 
Richard L. Gregg, commissioner of the public debt, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
The change does not affect over-the-counter sales at financial institutions 
where $50 and $75 bonds will still be available. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury said employees who currently buy $50 and $75 bonds will not be 
required to complete new bond authorizations. Instead, current allotments will 
automatically be applied to the purchase of $100 bonds. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury began phasing out $50 and $75 bonds from payroll savings in 
February, 1988, by no longer offering them to new enrollees. 
</P>
<P>
Payroll savings allows employees to buy savings bonds on the installment plan 
through regular payments withheld from their paychecks. Bonds are issued when 
the price of a bond is accumulated.

A senior oil official said today that Iraq will invite foreign companies to 
finance the development of new oil fields in exchange for secure oil supplies 
and stable prices. 
</P>
<P>
Oil Ministry Undersecretary Sami Sharif said the door is now open to major oil 
companies to take part in projects to develop Iraq's vast oil reserves, put 
officially at about 100 billion barrels. 
</P>
<P>
He said Iraq had three criteria for foreign participation, which ended in 1973 
when Iraq nationalized the last remaining foreign oil company operating there. 
In exchange for long-term oil supplies and stable prices, foreign partners 
would ensure that projects involved no additional cost for Iraq and would 
accept repayment in oil from the field they develop. The percentage of 
production which the foreign partner could lift would depend on the size of the 
field and the investment involved.

SAMMY DAVIS UP, WALKING AFTER SEEING TV TRIBUTE

<P>
Sammy Davis Jr., who was treated for throat cancer last year, was up and 
walking in his hospital ward Monday after watching stars such as Frank Sinatra 
and Michael Jackson pay tribute to him in a television special, a hospital 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Davis re-entered Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles 10 days ago for treatment 
for a tooth infection possibly caused by radiation treatment he underwent after 
having the cancerous growth removed in September, the spokesman, Ron Wise, 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Davis thoroughly enjoyed the television program celebrating his 60 years as an 
entertainer, Wise said. Bob Hope, Dean Martin, Gregory Peck and Goldie Hawn 
were also among the stars who paid tribute. 
</P>
<P>
Davis has been able to leave his bed and appears to be making progress, Wise 
added.

VIEIRA SEEKS NEWS, NOT GLAMOUR

She could charm a snake or coax an ostrich to remove its head from the sand. 
The eyes, intelligent and mischievous; the smile, warm and wry; the voice, low 
and vibrant; and above all, the attitude, friendly and unguarded. It invites 
you to like her, to relate to her as though she is the nice person who has 
moved into your neighborhood and is destined to be your best friend. 
</P>
<P>
And, in a way, 36-year-old Meredith Vieira is new to the block. She recently 
moved up from CBS' low-rated and now-defunct magazine show, "West 57th," to her 
perch in a higher-priced neighborhood -- the prime location of CBS' 
long-running hit, "60 Minutes." She moved in when Diane Sawyer moved out to 
take up her million-plus residence at ABC. 
</P>
<P>
And if first impressions count, one suspects that Vieira will change the "60 
Minutes" neighborhood considerably. Put it this way: If Diane Sawyer is the 
Grace Kelly of television -- the perfectly groomed Ice Queen whose every 
gesture seems scripted -- then Meredith Vieira is TV's Debra Winger -- slightly 
rumpled, does not wear makeup and likes to dish with neighbors over the back 
fence. 
</P>
<P>
And, say those who know her, the public Meredith Vieira and the private 
Meredith Vieira are one and the same. "What you see on the air is what you 
get," said colleague Steve Kroft, who has worked with Vieira for the last 
several years, first on "West 57th" and now on "60 Minutes." Over the dozen or 
so years she has been in the business, there have been several attempts to 
change her wholesome, good looks into a more sophisticated image. 
</P>
<P>
It happened again, the attempt to make her look more glamorous, just a couple 
of weeks ago when she was doing her first "60 Minutes" introduction. But 
fortunately, producer Don Hewitt stepped in. "He was smart enough to see it 
didn't work, and he had them wash off the makeup." She pauses. "He would never 
say this, but the makeup made it almost look like I was trying to replace 
Diane. Trying to be glamorous. And it just doesn't work." 
</P>
<P>
What does seem to work for Meredith Vieira is, well, just being Meredith 
Vieira. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, the television star and relatively new mother (she is married to 
free-lance producer Richard Cohen; their son, Ben, is 11 months old) is sitting 
in her spacious CBS office. "It used to be Walter Cronkite's office," she tells 
you, a fact that fills her voice with a hint of pride and excitement. 
</P>
<P>
Vieira is committed to doing at least 10 stories a season for "60 Minutes"; the 
other correspondents do 20. The question arises: Does this put Vieira on the 
so-called Mommy Track in her profession? "Maybe," she replies. "I don't care if 
I'm a high-powered career person. . . . I want to be a reporter. That's all I 
want to do. . . . I don't like the whole star system. I just like doing my 
job."

Jeff Burr is ready to go back to directing his own films, saying he's 
discovered the frustrations of working on sequels after directing "The

</P>
<P>
"I've discovered that I just don't have the mental stability or the temperament 
to let others interfere with my films," the 28-year-old Dalton native said. 
"Plus, doing sequels is really an artistic dead end because the producers want 
you to continue to emulate the previous films. 
</P>
<P>
"The next film that I'm doing will have as little interference as possible from 
other sources," Burr said during a recent visit.

Actor Robert Duvall has prepared himself for roles by hanging out with bums on 
the Bowery, riding horses with the Texas Rangers and tramping through a 
Louisiana swamp with an alligator hunter. 
</P>
<P>
He's not sure if it was all worth it. 
</P>
<P>
"You could do all the research in the world -- sometimes it pays off, sometimes 
it doesn't," Duvall says in the March issue of Smart magazine. "Sometimes you 
don't have time. You got to be a human being up there. That's the most 
important thing." 
</P>
<P>
Duvall, who won an Oscar for "Tender Mercies" and starred in "The Godfather" 
and "The Great Santini," says he's a stickler for detail in his characters and 
in films in general. 
</P>
<P>
"When actors start acting bigger than life, bigger than the people they play, 
then they're in trouble," Duvall said. "For example, I can't even talk about 
'Gone With the Wind.' You don't see people in the South like that. It's a 
joke."

PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: DRUG TO SLOW ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE SHOWS SOME PROMISE 
</P>

<P>
Q. My wife has Alzheimer's disease. It breaks my heart to see her losing her 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
When I read about a new drug for Alzheimer's disease, I was excited. But her 
doctor knows nothing about THA. I would go anywhere to get this if it would 
help her stay out of a nursing home. Does THA really work against Alzheimer's 
and where can I get it? 
</P>
<P>
A. THA, also known as tacrine, is being tested by the Parke-Davis Co. Under the 
careful supervision of the National Institutes of Health, 17 centers around the 
country are checking on this drug's ability to slow the mental deterioration 
typical of Alzheimer's disease. 
</P>
<P>
The scientific grapevine indicates that 30% to 40% of Alzheimer's patients may 
experience some benefit from THA, with a very small subgroup doing extremely 
well. This drug is not a cure, and the best that can be expected is a temporary 
improvement. 
</P>
<P>
The Food and Drug Administration has come under extreme pressure from desperate 
families to expedite approval or allow people compassionate use of THA under a 
doctor's supervision. But until the study is completed the agency won't permit 
importation or access. 
</P>
<P>
Although Parke-Davis has not yet requested approval for THA, industry insiders 
anticipate that it might become available within a year under the name Cognex. 
</P>
<P>
Q. I have an important deadline coming up, and I can't afford to take any time 
off sick. There are a lot of people in my office out with the flu, and a third 
of my son's class has come down with it. 
</P>
<P>
My doctor says it's too late for a flu shot to do any good. Didn't you write 
about a medicine to prevent flu? 
</P>
<P>
A. Your doctor is right about the vaccine. It takes about two weeks to build up 
immunity. 
</P>
<P>
Too bad he didn't mention the prescription drug amantadine (Symmetrel). This 
antiviral medicine can prevent type A influenza. If someone comes down with the 
flu, it can speed recovery, especially if taken within 24 to 48 hours of the 
first symptoms. Amantadine can cause mental confusion, dizziness, insomnia and 
jitters. It's not for everyone, but it may be worth a try.

Ten-year-old Sarah Lawing went where no other journalist had gone before in 
obtaining an interview with Tom Cruise on the set of "Day of Thunder," his new 
movie about a race car driver. 
</P>
<P>
When she heard that Cruise was filming the movie near her family's farm in Long 
Creek, N.C., the reporter for Long Creek Elementary School's News and Neighs 
wrote the actor seeking an interview, according to this week's People magazine. 
</P>
<P>
The star of "Born on the Fourth of July," "Rain Man" and "Top Gun" had turned 
down previous requests but gave Sarah her first interview. Her only previous 
story, about "a really big snowflake," had not required an interview. 
</P>
<P>
During the five-minute interview, Cruise said he first became interested in 
acting at age 7 and said he thought "very strongly" about living in Long Creek 
in southwestern North Carolina.

The Giants signed veteran infielder Robby Thompson to a three-year contract, 
plus a club option for 1993, the team announced today. 
</P>
<P>
With Thompson's signing, Giants President and General Manager Al Rosen once

a player. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the deal were not disclosed. 
</P>

It took 21 years, but the 1969 Chicago Cubs finally have something to brag 
about. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Rudolph hit a two-run double in the bottom of the seventh and final inning 
to give the Cubs a 3-2 victory over the 1969 Baltimore Orioles in Sunday's 
fifth annual Dream Game, billed as "the World Series that never was but should 
have been." 
</P>
<P>
The Cubs, with an eight-game lead in the National League East standings on Aug. 
28, 1969, finished eight games behind the pennant-winning New York Mets that 
year. The Miracle Mets then went on to upset the favored Baltimore Orioles in 
five games, winning the last four straight. 
</P>
<P>
"We waited a long time to beat these guys," said Cubs third baseman Ron Santo, 
who also served as manager in place of the ailing Leo Durocher. "It's great to 
finally get a victory."

MELVIN DURSLAG: AS PINCAY LEARNED, BREAKS IN THE GAME HAPPEN IN ALL SPORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELVIN DURSLAG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The shoulder is in a sling, but Laffit Pincay, who has ridden more winners than 
any jockey except one, isn't complaining. 
</P>
<P>
Pain has vanished. 
</P>
<P>
"I was lucky," says Pincay. "It was a clean fracture of the right collarbone. I 
spent only one night in the hospital." 
</P>
<P>
And how did this accident come to Laffit, 43? 
</P>
<P>
It came driving, of all things, in a harness race, a game of chance in which 
Pincay doesn't know a pacer from a bighorn sheep. 
</P>
<P>
But he volunteers with riding colleagues from Santa Anita to participate in a 
harness race at Los Alamitos, from which money goes to a fund helping disabled 
jocks. 
</P>
<P>
And, to condense a long and agonizing account, the pacer Laffit is chauffeuring 
flips -- and he joins the disabled he was aiming to help. 
</P>
<P>
With a break, if you will pardon the extravagant wit, he could be out only a 
month, meaning it shouldn't cost him much more than $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Is he in the habit of engaging in sports alien to his own? 
</P>
<P>
"I have played baseball," he recalls. "I also have played tennis and I have 
skied. But this is the first time I ever have been hurt in anything except 
thoroughbred racing." 
</P>
<P>
In his depression, Laffit is comforted with the reminder that what has happened 
to him is an ancient story of sports -- athletes racked up doing something they 
shouldn't be doing. 
</P>
<P>
Years ago, when Johnny Unitas was at his crest, we recall a headline in a 
Baltimore newspaper, "UNITAS SURGERY SUCCESS -- IN A CAST SIX WEEKS." 
</P>
<P>
Had this hero been set upon, sacked and knocked out by the Bears? Not exactly. 
He had fallen victim of that dangerous contact sport, paddle tennis, rupturing 
an Achilles' tendon that threatened to remove him from football. 
</P>
<P>
In his prime, Sparky Lyle, ace of the Yankee bullpen, tore an ankle ligament 
playing basketball. If Lyle, a baseball player, went out playing basketball, 
Norm Nixon, a basketball player, went out playing baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Someone talks Norm into a softball game. The fleet-footed center fielder, who 
would make the world forget Willie Mays, trips in pursuit of a fly. 
</P>
<P>
The diagnosis: complete rupture of the quadriceps tendon. Norm goes into a cast 
for six weeks -- and the Clippers are treated for shock. 
</P>
<P>
We recall in the week of the Santa Anita Handicap that the jocks got up a 
charity softball game. A rider named Fernando Alvarez is due to sit astride the 
favorite, only Fernando breaks an ankle sliding into second. 
</P>
<P>
Why would he play softball when, just as easily, he could have sustained the 
same injury, or one worse, driving a harness horse? 
</P>
<P>
Al Unser, the distinguished racing machine artist, goes back to Indy one year 
for the 500. Relaxing outside his motel, he decides to show fellow drivers how 
to "wheel" a motorcycle, which is to say, stand it on its rear wheel. 
</P>
<P>
The next wheels Al encounters are those under a stretcher, wheeling him into 
the hospital with a broken leg. 
</P>
<P>
When John Hadl was functioning as quarterback in the National Football League, 
he lectured repeatedly to young players on the perils of motorbikes. 
</P>
<P>
John wouldn't ride anything more dangerous than horses, one of which puts him 
in intensive care with a fractured skull. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the most celebrated case in sports involving grief away from one's 
own arena was that of Jim Lonborg, a 22-game winner in 1967, voted the Cy Young 
Award. In the World Series that year, he started three games for the Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
Well, the Series ends and, shortly, Jim heads for California's High Sierra, 
paradise for skiers. He busts up a knee so severely that he is able to win but 
six games the following season and just about schusses his way out of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Now a dentist in New England, Lonborg is a great fellow. We asked him one day 
if, at the top of his baseball career, he had regrets going skiing. 
</P>
<P>
"Not in the least," he responded. "When there is so much to do in life, you 
can't sit around like a paranoid and have meals sent into your room. You have 
to get out and enjoy yourself." 
</P>
<P>
Jim thought a moment, then added: 
</P>
<P>
"Besides, statistics show that only four people of every 100 who ski suffer 
major injuries. The odds were in my favor." 
</P>
<P>
If the truth is known, the odds were in Pincay's favor, too. A trainer at the 
scene fixed the price on Laffit's taking a spill at "a zillion-to-one." 
</P>
<P>
You go to Las Vegas, taking the short end on this, and you walk away a 
zillionaire. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Garvey played tennis while engaged in baseball but, pursuing Lou Gehrig's 
record of 2,130 consecutive games, refrained from doing household chores. 
</P>
<P>
"When something needs fixing from a ladder," said Steve, "I give the job to a 
craftsman." 
</P>
<P>
Garvey wouldn't do himself in saving a tab. After 1,207 straight games, he went 
out in a collision with a catcher. 
</P>
<P>
Clubs offering massive sums to players today often specify in contracts what 
the worker is able to do off the field. Once signing a big contract with 
Houston, Don Sutton confided: 
</P>
<P>
"I am not permitted to ski, scuba dive or sky-dive. I am not allowed to play 
tennis, hunt or hang-glide. I must not play basketball, football, racquetball 
or handball. And it violates my contract if I submerge in a diving bell." 
</P>
<P>
As independent contractors, jockeys aren't subject to such restrictions, 
meaning that if Laffit Pincay cashes in a zillion-to-one driving a pacer, he 
may want to nibble for a price next driving a trotter.

For a Sunday, it was a great Friday, Oaklawn Park General Manager Eric Jackson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first-ever regularly scheduled Sunday racing program at Oaklawn 
Park, Jackson said, and Sunday's numbers -- 16,921 people wagering $2,179,161 
-- met track officials' "most optimistic expectations," Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
"We looked at what we did last year on Fridays and weekdays in February," 
Jackson said. "Compared to almost any yardstick, this was a tremendous day for 
us." 
</P>
<P>
Legislation approved last year cleared the way for local-option Sunday racing. 
After voters approved it, the track added two Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, we did $1.8 million on opening Friday, $1.9 million the next one, 
$1.4 the next one, $1.7, $1.8." 
</P>
<P>
"Gosh, for early in February, this is a big day," Jackson said.

BETTING THE SYSTEM; 
</P>
<P>
WHY PLAYING THIRD HORSE CAN BE NO.1 CHOICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORMAN DASH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although "The Dwarf" was only 3 feet, 2 inches tall, to his race track pals he 
seemed as tall as they were, sometimes taller. No one ever called him The 
Dwarf; they called him Joey, which everyone thought was his real name. 
</P>
<P>
Joey went to a junior college in the Los Angeles area and was good enough to 
win letters in football and basketball. 
</P>
<P>
He graduated with an associate of arts degree. After college, although he 
majored in journalism, he made a living by acting in movies and television; he 
played the horses in his spare time. 
</P>
<P>
Joey loved the ponies so much that he developed a system he could bet every 
day. 
</P>
<P>
The system was simple. Joey would bet the third choice on the totalizator 
board. He didn't like to bet the "chalk" because the payoffs were so low, but 
the third choice was another matter. Most of the time they returned from $9 to 
$16 for every $2 wagered. 
</P>
<P>
Another reason he liked the third choice was because it came up winning at 
least once almost every day of the meeting. The results, although less than 
spectacular, usually resulted in a small profit for straight betting. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes three or four of these horses would win. 
</P>
<P>
The best days for Joey's system at Santa Anita race track in 1989 were from 
Feb. 11 to Feb. 24, when 25 winners returned a total of $280.50 for a profit of 
$82.50 for the $198 bet. In addition, the first 11 days of the season, Dec. 26 
to Jan. 7, resulted in a profit of $14.80 as 18 horses put their noses on the 
finish line first. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most profitable days was Feb. 11, when Joey won four races out of 
nine. It began with the first race, which lined up like this: 
</P>
<P>
1 -- Bueno Amnistia: $31.10 
</P>
<P>
2 -- Bargain Standard: $7.40 
</P>
<P>
3 -- Star Ribot: $47.60 
</P>
<P>
4 -- Manhattan King: $5.50 
</P>
<P>
5 -- Tourismo: $6.40 
</P>
<P>
6 -- Hidden Royalty: 10.80 
</P>
<P>
7 -- Salamanques: 2.20 
</P>
<P>
8 -- Bang Bang Bang: 10.30 
</P>
<P>
9 -- Lucky Bear: 3.30 
</P>
<P>
10 -- Bickerwithbob: 70.50 
</P>
<P>
First choice in the betting was Salamanques. Lucky Bear was second. Third, the 
horse to bet, was Manhattan King. It was a mile race for 4-year-olds and up. 
Manhattan King, although outrun in the early going, rallied in the last quarter 
to win by three-quarters of a length. The horse paid $13 for every $2 bet. 
</P>
<P>
Joey lost the second race. In the third, a six-furlong sprint for 3-year-old 
fillies, Pointedly, from the No. 1 post position, started out sixth but quickly 
moved up to second by the quarter-pole. The horse fought for the lead nearing 
the stretch and pulled ahead easily in the final furlong to win by 6 1/2 
lengths, paying $13.20. 
</P>
<P>
After losing the next three races, Triteamtri, a 4-year-old, won easily for 
Joey in the seventh, winning the mile run by 10 lengths. System backers 
received $9.40. Sunny Blossom went to the front in the eighth and was never 
headed. The horse drew clear in the upper stretch and held off the second nag 
by half a length, also paying $9.40. 
</P>
<P>
For the day, Joey bet a total $18 and won $45, for a nifty profit of $27. 
</P>
<P>
Out of the 90-day race meeting, two winners a day romped home 27 times, three 
winning horses eight times and four winning horses two times. The highest price 
won was on Jan. 14, when a 10-1 shot came in and paid $22.20. The favorite was 
bet down to 30 cents for $1 and the second choice was $3.70 for $1. Joey's 
horse, Cherokee Colony, ignoring the heavy odds against it, turned into the 
stretch and went for the lead. At the finish, Cherokee Colony ended up in front 
by one-and-a-quarter lengths. 
</P>
<P>
Joey's theory for betting the third choice is that returns on the favorite are 
too low when they do win and that the second choice doesn't win often enough to 
make betting on it worthwhile. Therefore, the third choice is best. "It's got 
to be a good one, since a lot of the bettors think enough of the nag to make it 
their choice, ahead of all but two of the other horses in the race," Joey says. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Joey will tell you that lots of times the two top choices in the 
betting are really "false" favorites and that the "smart" money usually goes on 
the third choice. 
</P>
<P>
"The first two choices are bad bets," Joey says. "The public is usually wrong. 
Favorites win 30% of the time, and they lose 70% of the time. It doesn't make 
sense to back a favorite. You're going to lose more than you're going to win." 
</P>
<P>
However, how one determines where the smart money goes is a good question. Joey 
will tell you that he can tell by observing the amount of money bet. For 
instance, if the third choice was the early morning favorite at 5-2 and finally 
goes off at 6-1, obviously it's an overlay, since the first two choices were 
bet down heavily. 
</P>
<P>
"It's beautiful. The general public bets on the first two choices. They don't 
know anything," Joey explains. "It's the smart money that goes on the third 
choice." 
</P>
<P>
Joey insists that the totalizator board never lies. "It always tells the truth. 
You only have to watch for it," he claims. Of course, the totalizator board 
never lies, but why should it? Although it never shows a profit, it never loses 
either.

FIRST TRIAL OF U.S. JUDGE ON RACKETEERING CHARGES IS SET TO BEGIN; 
</P>
<P>
CRIMINAL JUSTICE: ROBERT AGUILAR IS ACCUSED OF TRYING TO INFLUENCE TWO JUDGES, 
LYING TO FBI AGENTS AND HELPING A FUGITIVE FRIEND. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prosecutors call him the "defendant," charged with the serious crimes of 
racketeering and obstruction of justice. Defense lawyers call him "judge." 
</P>
<P>
With his wire-rim glasses, salt-and-pepper hair and well-tailored suits, Robert 
P. Aguilar looks like a senior partner of a high-powered law firm. But today, 
the 58-year-old jurist will become the first sitting federal judge in the 
nation to go on trial on racketeering charges. 
</P>
<P>
He also is the only federal judge based in California ever to face trial. 
</P>
<P>
Aguilar was indicted on eight counts June 13. The most serious charge is that 
he turned his office into a racketeering enterprise in which he attempted to 
obstruct justice on behalf of friends and former clients. If convicted, he 
faces up to 55 years in prison, a $2-million fine and impeachment by Congress, 
the only way to oust a federal judge. 
</P>
<P>
According to prosecutors, Aguilar tried to influence two judges in criminal 
cases, lied to FBI agents who questioned him about his associates, helped a 
friend remain a fugitive and told a felon his phones had been tapped. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors Ralph D. Martin, Sara M. Lord and William A. Keefer of the Justice 
Department's Public Integrity Unit do not allege that money changed hands. And 
from all appearances, Aguilar did not succeed in any effort to influence 
judicial decisions. But the prosecution hopes to persuade jurors that Aguilar 
knew he was using his special position to influence fellow judges. 
</P>
<P>
The defense may acknowledge that Aguilar's judgment in friends was bad. But San 
Francisco lawyers Patrick S. Hallinan, Hugh Levine and Charles Garry hope to 
persuade jurors that Aguilar never intended to improperly influence any case's 
outcome. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyers also are likely to argue that Aguilar, a liberal and a maverick, 
was singled out for prosecution because he had made enemies in the Justice 
Department by issuing several major rulings against the government. 
</P>
<P>
Through it all, the defense hopes to portray Aguilar as a dignified man worthy 
of respect. Toward that end, they are fighting what they charge is a 
prosecution effort to "assassinate" his character. They asked the trial judge, 
U.S. District Judge Louis Bechtle of Philadelphia, to prevent the introduction 
of tape-recorded statements in which Aguilar remarks about his sex life and 
that of another judge. 
</P>
<P>
Born in the San Joaquin Valley town of Madera, one of 11 children, Aguilar 
began his career in 1960 as a trial attorney in San Jose, handling a mix of 
criminal and civil matters. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, he dabbled in politics, befriended Rep. Don Edwards (D-San 
Jose), and shared a law office with Edwards' son, Leonard. Gov. Jerry Brown 
appointed Aguilar to the Santa Clara Superior Court in 1979, and in 1980, 
President Jimmy Carter named him to the federal bench. Aguilar has said his 
proudest moment was when he gave the citizenship oath to his father, a Mexican 
immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
As the trial begins, across from Aguilar will be sitting an unlikely pair of 
co-defendants, each charged with one count of conspiracy and facing up to 10 
years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
One is an aged, diminutive ex-convict named Abe Chapman, who generations ago 
gained the moniker "The Trigger." He is a distant in-law of Aguilar's, served 
four prison terms in the 1930s, '40s and '50s for drug offenses, and was part 
of the infamous gang Murder Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Now 83 and arthritic, the cigar-smoking Polish immigrant apparently is too 
infirm to sit still for an entire day in court. On Friday, as lawyers debated 
points of law as a prelude to the start of jury selection today, Chapman picked 
up his trench coat and mumbled that he meant no disrespect to the judge. While 
his lawyer, Stephen B. Krimel of San Diego, tried to explain away his client's 
problem, Chapman left the courtroom. Krimel hopes to find a place where his 
client can nap during breaks in what promises to be a six-week trial. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the government charges, Chief U.S. District Judge Robert Peckham of 
San Francisco mentioned to Aguilar that Chapman's phones had been tapped. 
Aguilar, in turn, let Chapman know, the government says. 
</P>
<P>
The other defendant is Rudy Tham, 66, a craggy-faced, burly friend of Chapman's 
who had never met the judge. In the late 1960s and '70s, Tham was perhaps the 
most powerful Teamster officer on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
But then mobster Jimmy (the Weasel) Fratianno became a federal witness. And 
based on Fratianno's testimony, Tham was convicted in 1980 of embezzling about 
$2,000 from a Teamster local in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Tham, hoping to regain his role in the union, wanted to have his 
conviction overturned. Aguilar is accused of having advised Tham's lawyer on 
how to present a proper argument that would sway U.S. District Judge Stanley 
Weigel. 
</P>
<P>
The government contends that in exchange, Tham and Chapman promised to help 
find a job for one of Aguilar's brothers, a recovering alcoholic. Prosecutors, 
however, conceded in a brief that Aguilar "showed a certain reluctance to be 
pulled completely into their scheming." 
</P>
<P>
Aguilar might never have become a target of investigation if the Organized 
Crime Strike Force had not opened a wide-ranging investigation of another man 
Aguilar had never met. 
</P>
<P>
Starting in 1986, authorities tapped the phones of Angelo Commito, then a Marin 
County businessman who sold health plans to unions. The taps resulted in 
indictments against Commito and associates in Baltimore, Chicago, Atlanta, San 
Diego and San Francisco. Commito was accused of fraud in the sale of benefit 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
The Commito taps resulted in or helped fuel other investigations, ranging from 
allegations of extortion of Hollywood entertainment companies to a scheme 
involving kickbacks in the manufacture and sale of wooden pallets. 
</P>
<P>
Although Aguilar never was overheard on the Commito taps, Tham and Chapman were 
Commito associates. As part of the investigation, state agents had Chapman 
under surveillance in July, 1987, when he had lunch with Aguilar. 
</P>
<P>
In a twist, U.S. District Judge Marilyn Patel of San Francisco last year threw 
out much of the case against Commito, ruling the government illegally tapped 
his phones. The ruling, which is on appeal, placed cases against him and his 
co-defendants across the country in limbo. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, lawyers for Tham, Chapman and Aguilar have asked Bechtle to suppress 
much of the evidence against their clients, noting the Aguilar investigation 
stemmed at least in part from the illegal Commito wiretap. Bechtle promised a 
ruling by today. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the charges involving Tham and Chapman, Aguilar is accused of 
helping Vera Hoff, 66, while she lived in Mexico as a fugitive from a tax 
evasion sentence. Hoff is a friend, former client and one-time secretary for 
Aguilar. She was arrested in Texas last year and is expected to be called by 
the prosecution as a witness in the Aguilar case. 
</P>
<P>
The government alleged that as she was preparing to flee in 1979, Hoff sold her 
San Jose home to Aguilar at "generous" terms. Aguilar allegedly helped Hoff buy 
a condominium in Acapulco in 1980. And, prosecutors allege, Aguilar and a 
"girlfriend" visited Hoff in Acapulco in 1982 and talked about getting $200,000 
he owed her across the border. Garry, one of Aguilar's lawyers, called the 
charge "an outright lie." 
</P>
<P>
A final charge against Aguilar involves another old friend, Ronald V. Cloud, a 
wealthy Fresno businessman who once owned the Cal-Neva Lodge casino in Lake 
Tahoe. In October, 1983, the Nevada gaming commission, which found many 
irregularities at the Cal-Neva, refused to extend Cloud's gambling license. 
Cloud was forced to sell the casino. In 1986, he was charged with fraud in the 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
Aguilar allegedly told U.S. District Judge Samuel Conti, who was hearing 
Cloud's case, that Cloud was "an old man and he's a friend of mine," a comment 
the government charges was an attempt to influence Conti. Cloud, once a client 
of Aguilar, nonetheless was convicted in 1987. Conti ordered that he pay $8 
million in fines and restitution. 
</P>
<P>
While Cloud appealed, the government charges, Aguilar told Cloud he had asked 
U.S. District Judge Robert Takasugi of Los Angeles about the legal abilities of 
Cloud's appellate lawyer, Howard Weitzman. "Of course, I did not reveal my 
interest" to Takasugi, Aguilar was quoted as telling Cloud. The U.S. 9th 
Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed Cloud's conviction last year.
