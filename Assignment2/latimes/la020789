A man accused of towing a record 56 tons of hashish and marijuana into San 
Francisco Bay made his debut as his own lawyer and blamed the charges on former 
Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese, among others. "This is just one of many cases being 
played out across this country to justify the government expense for drug 
interdiction," Calvin Robinson said in his opening statement to a federal court 
jury in San Francisco. He said the laws under which he is being prosecuted were 
"lobbied into existence by special-interest groups . . . the Elliot Nesses of 
the '80s and '90s . . . Edwin Meese and Commissioner (William) von Raab," the 
former head of U.S. Customs. Robinson also said he was innocent of smuggling. 
Robinson, 47, of Napa, and his son, stepson and two nephews were arrested last 
May when the Coast Guard seized a tug and barge and found 43 tons of hashish 
and 13 tons of marijuana.

Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said that Iran will continue to export its 
Islamic revolution, but not by force. "We have a concept," he told a Tehran 
press conference, "and we're going to continue the policy to export the 
revolution. But this doesn't mean we're going to export the revolution with a 
gun." Iran has been restoring relations with Western countries and its Persian 
Gulf neighbors in a new open-door policy aimed at ending a decade of 
self-imposed isolation. "Except for the Palestine-occupying regime (Israel) and 
the racist South African regime, and precluding American sabotage, we desire 
good relations with other countries of the world," Velayati said.

MARCOS SETTLEMENT SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Philippine President Corazon Aquino has sent a senior adviser to New York to 
talk with lawyers for deposed President Ferdinand E. Marcos about settling 
claims that he stole huge sums from the island nation. She said Mateo Caparas 
will attempt to verify Manila newspaper reports that Marcos "sincerely wants to 
discuss a settlement" of demands for the return of up to $10 billion that he is 
alleged to have stolen during his 20 years in office. Caparas is chairman of 
the Presidential Commission on Good Government. Marcos, 71, who has been 
hospitalized since Jan. 15 with pneumonia and bronchial asthma, and his wife, 
Imelda, are living in exile in Hawaii. They face a trial in federal court in 
New York on fraud and racketeering charges.

The former operator of a court reporting service in San Diego has pleaded 
guilty to mail fraud, and apparently will cooperate in a federal investigation 
of Los Angeles lawyers purportedly involved in an insurance fraud scheme. 
Suzanne Rubin, 29, who had been arraigned on a single mail fraud count, changed 
her plea to guilty in San Diego federal court. U.S. District Judge John Rhoades 
ordered her plea agreement with federal prosecutors sealed. Neither Rubin nor 
her lawyer would say if she is assisting the government. But Assistant U.S. 
Atty. George D. Hardy called this "a fair implication from the circumstances." 
Authorities are investigating whether about 15 lawyers, paid millions of 
dollars by insurers to defend policyholders, schemed to prolong litigation and 
fatten their fees by conducting unnecessary pretrial discovery and filing 
spurious claims against each other's clients.

Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe called for tougher economic sanctions on South 
Africa and urged the United Nations to increase the strength of its 
peacekeeping force for Namibia. Mugabe told the eight-nation Commonwealth 
Committee on South Africa, meeting to seek ways to increase external pressure 
on Pretoria, that the international campaign for sanctions must be intensified. 
Several of South Africa's neighbors are members of the 48-member Commonwealth, 
an association of Britain and its former colonies. Mugabe applauded the 
U.S.-brokered peace plan on independence for Namibia. But he said African 
nations fear attempts to weaken the U.N. role in the territory South Africa has 
run since World War I.

The South Africa government cracked down for the first time on the country's 
most powerful white extremist group, banning displays of firearms at meetings 
of the Afrikaner Resistance Movement. Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok 
imposed the ban on the neo-Nazi group under the same emergency regulations used 
to restrict many anti-apartheid movements. Vlok said that meetings of the 
resistance movement have been "characterized by emotion-laden speeches . . . in 
which remarks about the use of violence were uttered." The movement, founded in 
1973, regularly draws thousands of whites to its rallies.

Iran assured Foreign Minister Roland Dumas of France that some Western hostages 
held in Lebanon will be freed soon, the official Kuwait News Agency reported. 
Dumas flew to Kuwait for a brief state visit after a two-day visit to Iran. The 
news agency, quoting diplomats traveling with Dumas, said, "He obtained a 
promise from responsible officials (in Tehran) that a number of Western 
hostages held in Lebanon will be released within a short period." The diplomats 
did not elaborate, the agency said. Most of the 16 missing foreigners, 
including nine Americans, are believed held by Shiite Muslim extremists loyal 
to Iran.

The Mexican government has decided to accept the nomination of John D. 
Negroponte to be U.S. ambassador to Mexico despite widespread criticism from 
opposition political parties and the Foreign Ministry. Negroponte, who served 
as American ambassador to Honduras at the height of the Contra war against the 
Nicaraguan government, has been critical of Mexican foreign policy. While 
Mexico is not happy with President Bush's choice for the post, it decided to 
accept Negroponte to avoid confrontation with the Bush Administration, Foreign 
Ministry sources said.

THIS TIME, LAS VEGAS ROUTS UC SANTA BARBARA, 77-61 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
UC Santa Barbara, which upset Nevada Las Vegas twice last season, was no match 
for the Rebels Monday night in the Thomas and Mack Center at Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
David Butler scored 21 points and Greg Anthony added 19 to lead 19th-ranked Las 
Vegas to a 77-61 Big West Conference basketball victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Rebels led only 7-6 after 5 minutes, but then outscored Santa Barbara, 
13-0, over the next 4 minutes to gain a 20-6 lead. 
</P>
<P>
They gained a 37-24 halftime lead behind Anthony's 14 points. Santa Barbara, 
led by Mike Doyle's 17 points and Carrick DeHart's 13, could pull no closer in 
the second half than the final margin. 
</P>
<P>
Las Vegas is 15-5 overall, 10-1 in Big West play. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara (15-4, 6-4) fell 3 1/2 games behind the Rebels and a half game 
behind second-place New Mexico State (7-4). 
</P>
<P>
Las Vegas opened the second half with strong shooting and quickly took control. 
</P>
<P>
The Rebels held a 49-29 lead with 15:30 left as Las Vegas shot 63% and Santa 
Barbara shot a dismal 33%. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams settled down, but Las Vegas held its 20-point margin with Stacey 
Augmon and George Ackles controlling the tempo. Ackles' inside defense 
frustrated Santa Barbara's penetrating offense. He had four blocked shots 
midway through the second half. 
</P>
<P>
So, the Gauchos tried to go outside, but Las Vegas' tough defense denied them 
good shots. 
</P>
<P>
The Rebels built their biggest lead, 71-47, on Butler's dunk late in the game. 
But Doyle made three quick baskets and Gary Gray added a jumper to pull the 
Gauchos within 71-55.

Florida State felt all along it belonged high in the rankings, even if few 
others did. 
</P>
<P>
"We had our skeptics about our position in the top 20, yet our youngsters never 
questioned it and knew they could play with anybody," Coach Pat Kennedy said 
after the 12th-ranked Seminoles shocked No. 4 Louisville, 81-78, Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
George McCloud made two free throws with 5 seconds left as Florida State gained 
the Metro Conference victory at Louisville, Ky., and raised its record to 18-2 
and 6-1, best in the conference. Louisville is 16-4 and 5-1. 
</P>
<P>
Pervis Ellison, who was out for two games with a knee injury, returned to lead 
the Cardinals with 19 points. 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse 85, Seton Hall 79 -- Sherman Douglas scored 28 points and Syracuse 
built a big second-half lead, then held off a furious closing rally to defeat 
No. 11 Seton Hall at East Rutherford, N.J., giving the Orangemen their seventh 
consecutive 20-victory season. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Thompson added 23 points as Syracuse (20-4) won its sixth game in a 
row. The victory was Syracuse's 17th in a row over Seton Hall (19-4). 
</P>
<P>
It also put the Orangemen and Pirates into a tie for second place in the Big 
East with 6-4 records. Georgetown (7-1) is in first place. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma 126, Iowa State 97 -- Stacey King scored 33 points and Skeeter Henry 
scored 16 of his 18 in the second half as No. 5 Oklahoma broke away from Iowa 
State in a Big Eight Conference game at Norman, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
The Sooners, coming off a loss to Oklahoma State Saturday that knocked them out 
of the No. 1 spot, shook off a listless first half to score 81 second-half 
points, a Big Eight record. 
</P>
<P>
Ohio State 70, Purdue 58 -- Jay Burson scored 26 points and the No. 16 Buckeyes 
won a Big Ten conference game at Columbus, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Ohio State (16-5, 5-3) moved into a four-way tie for second place in the Big 
Ten behind Indiana. Purdue is 10-12, 3-6. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia 78, Georgia Tech 71 -- Richard Morgan scored 23 points and the 
Cavaliers posted an Atlantic Coast Conference upset over No. 20 Georgia Tech at 
Charlottesville, Va. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia, which routed highly ranked North Carolina and North Carolina State at 
home earlier this season, is tied with those teams for the ACC lead at 5-2. 
Virginia (13-6 overall) has won six straight games. 
</P>
<P>
South Carolina 105, Southern Mississippi 63 -- Brent Price scored 22 points and 
had six assists to lead the Gamecocks in a Metro Conference game at Columbia, 
S.C. 
</P>
<P>
South Carolina is 13-6 overall and 3-2 in conference.

MORNING BRIEFING: THIS GUY WALKED RIGHT INTO HORNETS' NEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man was arrested at Charlotte Coliseum Sunday after he walked into the home 
team's locker room before the Hornets' game against Cleveland and tried to 
dress in Charlotte guard Rickey Green's uniform. 
</P>
<P>
Charlotte forward Kelly Tripucka, who at first thought the intruder was a 
reporter, said: "After about five minutes, he moved over to Rickey's locker and 
he started getting undressed. I was laughing at him. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'What's this guy doing?' Nobody knows him and he's got his pants off. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to make sure he didn't have a gun. When he had his pants off, I 
could see he was unarmed. 
</P>
<P>
"He was determined to get dressed and get ready for the game," Tripucka said 
after the Hornets lost to the Cavaliers, 110-91. "The sad thing is, we probably 
could have used him." 
</P>
<P>
No Respect Dept.: West Virginia, ranked No. 15 in the latest Associated Press 
basketball poll, has the nation's longest winning streak at 16 games. 
</P>
<P>
But after starting the season 1-2, the Mountaineers weren't ranked in the top 
20 until last week, when they earned the No. 18 spot. 
</P>
<P>
Being overlooked in the polls is nothing new for West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
"We were ranked quicker this year than we were in 1982," Coach Gale Catlett 
said. "In 1982, we had a 16-game winning streak and went 17-1 and didn't get 
ranked until Feb. 4. We got in there this time a week ahead of time." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: What was memorable about Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's first All-Star game 
appearance in 1970? (Answer to follow.) 
</P>
<P>
HBO is staging a press conference in the Time-Life Building in New York today 
at which an overflow crowd of about 500 is expected, about 200 more than 
invited. 
</P>
<P>
HBO is promoting its Thursday night showing of "Sports Illustrated: The Making 
of the Swimsuit Issue," and among those present at the press conference will be 
Christie Brinkley, Elle Macpherson, Cheryl Tiegs, and this year's cover girl, 
Kathy Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
Said HBO publicist Tony Fox: "Usually we're lucky if we get close to 50% 
response for a press conference, but for this one it's been unbelievable. It 
seems everyone wants to go." 
</P>
<P>
Wonder why. 
</P>
<P>
Generosity Dept.: Burt Grossman, defensive end from the University of 
Pittsburgh and a likely first-round National Football League draft choice, said 
he will donate $100,000 to Pitt's scholarship fund and $5,000 to his high 
school, Archbishop Carroll High in Bala Cynwyd, a suburb of Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to show my appreciation for the great opportunity that has been 
afforded me in high school and college," Grossman said. 
</P>
<P>
Grossman said the gifts aren't contingent on his being a No. 1 selection in the 
April draft. 
</P>
<P>
Pitt Coach Mike Gottfried said: "What makes this even more special is that Burt 
Grossman made this commitment without knowing what is going to happen in the 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a great example for athletes everywhere who may have the opportunity to 
give something back to their schools." 
</P>
<P>
26 Years Ago Today: On Feb. 7, 1963, Wilt Chamberlain of the San Francisco 
Warriors scored 56 points in a 134-129 loss to the Cincinnati Royals. 
</P>
<P>
23 Years Ago Today: On Feb. 7, 1966, Chamberlain scored 65 points to lead the 
Warriors to a 132-125 victory over the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Abdul-Jabbar, a rookie with the Milwaukee Bucks, fouled out 
after playing 18 minutes and scoring 10 points. The other center on his team, 
Willis Reed, also fouled out.

SECOND GENERATION PICKS UP THE TORCH FROM BOB MARLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SNOWDEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It may be time for the record industry to look seriously at reggae again. 
</P>
<P>
The Jamaican style, spearheaded by the late Bob Marley, was touted as a "next 
big thing" 15 years ago, but it failed to make a pop breakthrough and was soon 
pigeonholed as a cult music. For many fans, the last hope ended with Marley's 
death in 1981. To them, Marley was reggae. 
</P>
<P>
But the capacity turnout of 11,000 for the Bob Marley Day concert Sunday at the 
Long Beach Arena -- more than double the attendance at last year's event at the 
Santa Monica Civic -- indicated that reggae has spawned a sizable 
second-generation audience. 
</P>
<P>
While Marley remains a revered figurehead, this new audience -- much of it of 
high school and college age -- is embracing new heroes, including Marley's 
teen-age son, Ziggy, and England's UB40. This young audience also seems 
attracted by reggae's distinctive, almost communal feeling (much of the arena 
lobby was filled with the crafts displays that are a familiar part of large 
reggae gatherings). 
</P>
<P>
UB40's "Sing Our Own Song" could be an anthem embodying the second generation's 
experience as perfectly as the Bob Marley-Peter Tosh classic "Get Up Stand Up" 
did for the earlier reggae fans. 
</P>
<P>
Judy Mowatt, in fact, performed "Sing Our Own Song," though she slipped it in 
early in her 45-minute set rather than saving it for a triumphant finale. But 
the former backing singer for Marley still offered the most striking blend of 
contemporary and classic reggae on the eight hour-plus bill, which also 
featured Daddy U-Roy, Al Campbell, Haile Maskel and Matuzalem. 
</P>
<P>
Remarkably, Mowatt's sophisticated arrangements blended '60s girl-group 
harmonies, dance-hall toasting (Jamaican rapping) and American-style rapping 
without ever sounding artificial or forced. 
</P>
<P>
Working with a local band rather than a regular unit eliminated some of her 
subtle intricacies. Yet Mowatt's soaring voice (reminiscent of Martha Reeves') 
smoothed over the rough patches. 
</P>
<P>
Pato Banton, the young British toaster who was the only second-generation 
artist featured, could do no wrong for the crowd during his hourlong set. But 
his performance foundered on the question facing reggae's up-and-coming 
artists: Can they write songs as memorable as those of their predecessors? 
</P>
<P>
Banton operated in a slick, rock-influenced dance-hall style, but seemed more 
concerned with -- and was more successful at -- pushing his personality than 
making significant music. 
</P>
<P>
Although some of his socially conscious themes were laudable (anti-apartheid, 
anti-cocaine), the presentation was often trite -- as on the sing-along of 
"What the World Needs Now Is Love." Banton claimed that he helped pioneer 
England's rapid-fire "fast talking" deejay style, but it doesn't matter how 
fast you say something if you don't have much to say. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, you could be Burning Spear, a.k.a. Winston Rodney, whose voice 
alone is unforgettable. The veteran Jamaican singer displayed the liquid, 
grainy voice that gives him the authoritative air of a village elder entrusted 
with handing the tradition down. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Banton's, his 90-minute set made minimal concessions to show-biz ritual. 
A "do you want a sing-along?" query during "Slavery Days" was less an 
invitation than a challenge -- reminiscent of Robert DeNiro's "you talkin' to 
me?" line in "Taxi Driver." 
</P>
<P>
Even as the event celebrated Marley's birthday (he would have been 44 on 
Monday), the energy of the artists and the audience seemed to point to the 
future. The influx of young fans, who are growing up with their own heroes, may 
well be helping reggae move out of Marley's shadow.

A SAN FRANCISCO BALLET CELEBRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, Times Dance Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On stage at the War Memorial Opera House, the faces are familiar, the 
partnership and affiliation brand new. 
</P>
<P>
Sabina Allemann of National Ballet of Canada and Robert Hill of American Ballet 
Theatre are dancing together for the first time as principals with San 
Francisco Ballet, bringing their cool, almost analytical expertise to a 
conventionally swoony pas de deux from artistic director Helgi Tomasson's new 
neoclassic showpiece "Handel -- A Celebration." 
</P>
<P>
One of the most beautiful women in all ballet, Allemann displays her lyric 
gifts with graciousness and tact, while the tall, perfectly proportioned Hill 
betrays no suggestion of strain in the difficult, slow lifts and other physical 
challenges of the role. 
</P>
<P>
But "Handel -- A Celebration" is a company vehicle, not a star turn, and, 
significantly, Allemann and Hill don't eclipse the high achievement of their 
colleagues: the steely authority of Ludmila Lopukhova (from the Kirov Ballet), 
for example. Or the dreamy elegance of Pascale Leroy (from Ballet de 
Marseille), dancing with the warm, coltish Lawrence Pech (another Ballet 
Theatre refugee). Or the tiny, delicate Elizabeth Loscavio, a home-grown 
Wunderkind emerging as the discovery of the season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Less than four years after he took over the company after the ouster of Michael 
Smuin, Tomasson has created an ensemble that matches any in North America for 
sheer refinement. However, his emphasis on the extended line, heightened 
buoyancy and calibrated smoothness of classical dancing is energized by a 
repertory that, this season, focuses to a great extent on the Americanization 
of ballet. 
</P>
<P>
Agnes de Mille's "Rodeo" (1942); Jerome Robbins' "Interplay" (1945); Lew 
Christensen's "Sinfonia" (1959); Peter Martins' "Calcium Light Night" (1977), 
and even Jiri Kylian's "Forgotten Land" (1981) adopt from the vernacular 
movement and modern dance of our culture exciting ideas about rhythm, attack, 
gestural expression and energy. 
</P>
<P>
So, while watching San Francisco Ballet dance these works over the weekend, you 
saw a concept evolve of a freer, looser, more contemporary classicism -- one 
that can again be tested and hold its own against the neoclassic purity of 
George Balanchine's "Theme and Variations" (1947), "Pas de Trois" (1955) and 
"Ballo della Regina" (1978). 
</P>
<P>
Although its staging of "Rodeo" is inferior to the Joffrey's -- softened and 
often smeared except in the square-dance interlude -- Denis de Coteau and the 
exemplary SFB orchestra give the classic Copland score maximum freshness and 
urgency. Looking like Elizabeth Taylor in "Giant," Allemann as the Cowgirl 
dances strongly but makes the most preposterously glamorous wallflower in 
history. However, Pech is sensational as the Champion Roper -- lithe, dashing, 
charismatic but never self-conscious. 
</P>
<P>
These same qualities are those that Robbins built into the group vocabulary of 
"Interplay," a work (to music by Morton Gould) that prefigures the 
youth-dancing of "N.Y. Export, Op. Jazz" and "West Side Story" but in the most 
open, innocent and hopeful manner. Just out of her teens, Loscavio proved an 
ideal centerpiece: the child-woman totally fearless and absorbed in the moment. 
</P>
<P>
"Sinfonia" also depicts this sense of playful, assertive adolescence -- and 
even includes the identical finger-snapping accents. But here the Boccherini 
accompaniment reduces such colloquialisms to flippant novelties in a breezy but 
essentially conservative neoclassic suite. The airy lightness of SFB style is 
especially radiant in this trifle; indeed, the placement and ease of the male 
corps make such company veterans as David McNaughton (dancing with Lopukhova in 
Tomasson's hard-sell "Bizet Pas de Deux" on the same program) look undertrained 
or slovenly in comparison. 
</P>
<P>
The intricate technical inversions and displacements of "Calcium Light Night" 
attempt to match the eerie collage of effects in the Charles Ives 
accompaniment, just as the bold, headlong surge of energy in "Forgotten Land" 
seeks to physicalize the force and flow of Benjamin Britten's Sinfonia da 
Requiem. Balanchine's innovations with Webern and Stravinsky form the key 
antecedents of Martins', while American modern dance is clearly the matrix for 
Kylian's creation. 
</P>
<P>
These two unorthodox pieces received the most powerful dancing of the weekend: 
the magisterial assurance of Christopher Boatwright and the brilliant, 
methodically self-effacing Tracy-Kai Maier in "Calcium Light Night" and, in 
"Forgotten Land," the passionate, scrupulous contributions of Evelyn Cisneros 
and her colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Cisneros also joined Karin Averty and Anthony Randazzo in "Pas de Trois" (music 
by Glinka) and alone surmounted its nonstop technical rigors. Again, as in 
their performance of "Theme and Variations" (music by Tchaikovsky), Averty's 
dancing looked promising but oddly detached and generalized, as well as 
musically foursquare. Randazzo once more partnered her skillfully, but for all 
his charm and polish, he simply lacked the stamina to go the distance. So far, 
only a nice try. 
</P>
<P>
However, in "Ballo della Regina" (music by Verdi), San Francisco Ballet 
triumphantly mastered a tailor-made New York City Ballet showcase -- with 
Loscavio rocketing through the high-velocity Merill Ashley role with a 
particular delight in its dismayingly intricate needlepoint-pointe work. And, 
opposite her, Andre Reyes proved a new king of the air: Who else flies this 
weightlessly or effortlessly? 
</P>
<P>
Some of Tomasson's major risks this season remain under wraps. But he has 
already confirmed his hold on his dancers and his public with programs 
suggesting that the distinction between "regional" and "national" companies no 
longer has any meaning whatsoever.

MURDER WILL OUT IN 'ACCOMPLICE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN SULLIVAN, Times Theater Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Somewhere along the line -- specifically with "Sleuth" -- the thriller became 
the fooler, a naked duel between the playwright and the audience as to who 
could outsmart the other. 
</P>
<P>
"Watch out, she's got a knife!" In a thriller -- by the second act, anyway -- 
you could be pretty sure it was a real knife. In the fooler, maybe not. Maybe 
"she" was the gamekeeper's uncle, the one we thought got killed in the first 
act. Maybe this wasn't a murder story at all. 
</P>
<P>
Up until its final scene, Rupert Holmes' "Accomplice" is the wittiest and most 
accomplished fooler since "Deathtrap." The last scene is false, but tolerant 
audiences will go along with it, as was demonstrated Sunday night at the 
Pasadena Playhouse. Even in its present shape, "Accomplice" will run forever on 
the dinner-theater circuit. 
</P>
<P>
If Holmes is gunning for a classic, though, he'll either have to improve that 
last scene or take it out. Ironically, it's probably the reason he wanted to 
write the show in the first place. Having called upon the audience to solve the 
crime at the end of his previous show, "Drood," could he now enlist their aid 
as accomplices? 
</P>
<P>
Not really: People haven't become that cynical. The scene as it played Sunday 
night was a fumbled coup de theatre that didn't seem half as clever as the 
stuff that had gone before. "Accomplice" calls for footlights, not houselights. 
</P>
<P>
As long as it stays behind the proscenium, it's as smart as a whip. (Clue.) The 
scene -- the nominal scene -- is one of those converted fieldstone farmhouses 
not too far from London, where the best-laid murders oft go astray. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, the wife (Natalia Nogulich) intends to slip a few drops of poison 
(nicotine) into her boring husband's whiskey and soda. But the damn fool (Harry 
Shearer) doesn't want a drink this evening. Luckily, the wife has devised a 
backup plan, involving a foot bath and an electric hair dryer. 
</P>
<P>
(Aside: No, we are not revealing too much of the plot of "Accomplice." We 
haven't come to the plot yet. This is just the preamble.) 
</P>
<P>
Also on the scene -- again, nominally -- is the wife's lover (Michael McKean), 
who is likewise encumbered with a spouse (Pamela Brull.) She may not be as dumb 
as she looks. Then again, she may be as dumb as she looks, but still in league 
with somebody. 
</P>
<P>
And away we go. What follows will remind you of "Sleuth's" and "Deathtrap's" 
patternof revoking each scene in the next scene. What's different is that each 
scene is also redeemed by its successor. Its little false notes -- a bad joke 
which doesn't quite play, an anachronism, a too obvious accent -- are brought 
into harmony, now that we see the larger pattern. 
</P>
<P>
Except that we don't. The method is witty and so are the words that Holmes puts 
into his characters' mouths, their accents changing from stage British to 
backstage American in mid-stream. (Another source for "Accomplice" is "Noises 
Off," a hint we won't enlarge on.) 
</P>
<P>
Thrillers need laughter, and this one has plenty of it. 
</P>
<P>
All that's lacking is a genuine moment of alarm, the sort of shock that one 
gets from an old-style thriller such as "Dial M for Murder." And this seems at 
hand as the wrong knife slips into the wrong back in Act II. I was quite ready 
to accept this as the play's ultimate coup, but Holmes, the overachiever, 
insists on going beyond it. Give him credit for courage, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Directed by Art Wolff, the cast is all that can be desired. As with "Sleuth," 
there is some doubt about who the players actually are, but the names listed 
can generally be trusted. Everybody wears several faces, with Shearer 
stretching the farthest in tonality and Nogulich staying closest to home -- not 
that Nogulich herself would consider dropping poison in anybody's drink, even 
during a tough rehearsal. (Clue.) 
</P>
<P>
David Jenkins did the set, which is and is not what it appears to be, and 
Kathleen Detoro did the costumes, which are meant to read as costumes. Have we 
been sufficiently obscure? "Accomplice" is great fun, up to a point. Beyond 
that, connoisseurs will cavil. 
</P>
<P>
 Plays Tuesdays-Fridays at 8 p.m., Saturdays at 5 and 9 p.m., Sundays at 2 and 
7 p.m. Closes Feb. 26. 39 S. El Molino Ave. Tickets $25. (818) 356-PLAY.

The CBS schedule is on the move again. "TV 101," the series set in a 
high-school video journalism class, is moving for the third time, heading for 
Saturday nights at 9 as of Feb. 25. It'll take over the hour currently occupied 
by the limited run of "The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour." A new series, "Hard 
Time on Planet Earth," will premiere March 1 in the 8 p.m. Wednesday time 
period where "TV 101" has been playing. "Hard Time" stars Martin Kove, late of 
"Cagney &amp; Lacey," as an extraterrestrial convict sentenced to live on Earth 
in human form. "TV 101," produced by Grant Tinker's GTG Entertainment, started 
on Tuesdays and is the only survivor among GTG's three network series that 
premiered this season. ALEENE MacMINN

Former Israel diplomat and cabinet minister Abba Eban begins work this week on 
a four-segment, 4 1/2-hour PBS miniseries called "Israel 1947 to 1988: A 
Personal Witness." Presented by New York's WNET, it will begin where Eban's 
nine-part series, "Heritage: Civilization and the Jews," ended, with the events 
leading to Israeli independence in 1948. "Heritage" was broadcast by PBS three 
times and was shown in more than a dozen countries. In Tel Aviv on Monday, Eban 
said he will draw on his personal experience to provide commentary on Israel's 
political and military history. The first 90-minute segment is slated for 
completion by fall. ALEENE MacMINN

About 50 members of the Screen Extras Guild picketed Monday outside Universal 
Studios to protest the use of non-union extras in the Warren Beatty film, "Dick 
Tracy." The pickets began their protest outside a studio gate on Barham 
Boulevard last week, when production on the Beatty feature got under way, said 
a union organizer, Jerome Blackwell. "We will continue for each day they 
shoot," Blackwell said. "As long as we (picket), they will be slowed at least 
20 minutes a day." Blackwell estimated the "Dick Tracy" production schedule 
will mean jobs for non-union extras for the next 80 days. Neither Beatty nor 
Barry Osborne, the film's executive producer, was immediately available for 
comment. ALEENE MacMINN

TEATRO DE DANZA ESPANOLA AT PASADENA CIVIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Flamenco is not synonymous with Spanish dance, but it is a key element. It has 
also successfully supported imaginative transformations to the dramatic stage 
almost since its beginning. 
</P>
<P>
None of this was made very apparent Sunday afternoon at the Pasadena Civic 
Auditorium by the Teatro de Danza Espanola, a young-looking -- and -dancing -- 
troupe making its first U.S. tour. The company boasts a flamenco cadre that 
would do many a Seville or Madrid tablao proud, but it did not provide a basis 
for any coherent choreography or dramatic extension. 
</P>
<P>
Company director Luisillo's "La Trilla" provided a pseudo-folkloric pageant as 
a setting for big solo efforts from Juan Fernandez and Maria Vivo. Despite the 
scenery and profusion of agricultural props, this scene of workers in an 
Andalusian field -- the women, of course, in heels and their best ruffled 
skirts -- was hardly plausible as either a social or dramatic context. 
</P>
<P>
The individual dancing, however, proved eminently credible. Fernandez, despite 
a superficial resemblance to John Travolta and despite his adoption of some 
disco poses, moved with supple authority and maintained a crisp, cool fury in 
his intricately patterned heel work. 
</P>
<P>
Vivo emphasized exaggerated sensuality through sinuous, seemingly boneless arms 
and bump-and-grind torso work. Her solo developed increasingly abandoned 
variations, with the rhythm of her heel work buried by the accompanying 
hand-clapping. 
</P>
<P>
Elaborate palmoteo, indeed, was the central element of the accompaniment, led 
by singers Toni Maya and Cancanilla de Marbella, who also contributed clowning 
dance parodies. This was raucous, spirited, punk flamenco nuevo, greeted with 
cheers from the audience and continued in the exuberant encores. 
</P>
<P>
The first half of the program was devoted to Luisillo's "Carmen," set to the 
music of Bizet -- taped, of course -- as reordered and recomposed by Rodion 
Shchedrin for his wife, Maya Plisetskaya, in 1968. The poverty of imagination 
and lack of self-confidence and identity apparent in choosing a Soviet 
arrangement of a French operatic view of Spanish life was reflected in the 
cluttered choreography, which made no effort to establish character or 
motivation and covered important solo entrances and duets with chorus line 
kitsch. 
</P>
<P>
Rocio Acosta brought a measure of paradoxically flamboyant dignity to the title 
role, dancing with technical assurance in the tawdry surroundings. Though 
billed as a principal ballet dancer, her part called more for modern dance 
movement and flamenco poses, plus a loud cry and gasps to initiate her extended 
death throes. 
</P>
<P>
Her partner as Don Jose was not the similarly billed Miguel Valeran, but 
Florencio Campo. He provided little more than an heroically out-thrust chest 
for characterization. In a sad reflection on his ease in the role and the 
confused choreography, it was impossible to tell whether he was supposed to 
collapse under Carmen at the end, or simply overbalanced attempting to carry 
her away. 
</P>
<P>
Vigorous dancing of varying skill in the supporting roles and ensembles did not 
redeem the effort.

BORING 'TWICE DEAD' DESERVES ONE HASTY ENTOMBMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Horror fans will likely be more than twice bored during "Twice Dead" 
(citywide), a half-witted thriller with double the yawns on a fraction of the 
usual feature budget. Video stores, where it's sure to quickly find its proper 
entombment, will be lucky if it's twice rented. 
</P>
<P>
And, yes, it does seem twice as long as it is, though there's promise in its 
premise: The haunted house where the action takes place is one of those 
dilapidated mansions in suburban Hollywood that have survived amid encroachment 
from gangs, graffiti and ugly apartment complexes. Into such a fixer-upper 
moves a naive nuclear family from Colorado that's just inherited the place. 
</P>
<P>
The new transplants scarcely have time to worry about the homicidal ghost of an 
early-'30s actor residing up in the attic, of course, when there are even more 
homicidal street punks with early-'80s New Wave haircuts out on the front walk. 
Shivers! 
</P>
<P>
After the upstairs spook attempts to strangle the cheerful son, and the 
downstairs punks make repeated attempts to rape the nubile daughter, among 
other close calls, most sensible families would opt for an emergency 
alternative dwelling -- a motel, a cardboard shanty on Skid Row, anything. Not 
these folks, who resolve to stick it out until the inevitable confrontation 
between ghost and gang leads to a happy, bloody ending. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. cynics may at least have some fun picking on the picture's credibility 
lapses: Though it is explained that bankruptcy compels the family to live in 
such a run-down abode, Dad is somehow still able to afford to send his son and 
daughter to USC. And when Mom and Pop casually call the Hollywood police from 
out of town to ask them to check up on the kids, a patrol car with nothing 
better to do is dispatched immediately. Uh-huh. 
</P>
<P>
One performance in "Twice Dead" (MPAA-rated R) stands out -- that of Jonathan 
Chapin, who, as Crip, a nervous punk with a bent flair for old-time romance, is 
certifiably, memorably creepy. But the post-climactic suggestion that his 
character's spirit might live on in a sequel is hardly welcome (if hardly 
likely). The promise of two "Twice Deads" is quadruply mortifying. CHRIS

TRITE AND TEDIOUS, 'ALL'S FAIR . . .' ISN'T 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"All's Fair . . ." (at selected theaters) is such a dismal comedy that not even 
Sally Kellerman's style and panache can salvage it. Kellerman plays the elegant 
estranged wife of an obnoxious, military-minded candy manufacturer (George 
Segal) who insists that his corporate staffers, armed with paint guns, join him 
in war games every weekend as a test of their mettle. 
</P>
<P>
When Kellerman learns that a young executive (Jennifer Edwards) is blocked from 
a vice presidency because she's a woman and therefore effectively barred from 
participating in the games, Kellerman rallies to her cause. Edwards rounds up 
some women friends, and Kellerman hires a mercenary (Lou Ferrigno) to get them 
in shape to declare war on Segal and his guys, including Robert Carradine as 
Edwards' competition for the vice president slot. 
</P>
<P>
A quartet of writers and director Rocky Lang create only tedium with their 
protracted battle of the sexes. In such dire circumstances, only Kellerman is 
able to make an impression. "All's Fair . . ." (rated PG-13 for language), 
which has terrible sound and lighting, is really wretched business. KEVIN

POP CAPSULES : FEW STAND STILL FOR BRAZILIAN CARNAVAL AT PALLADIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SNOWDEN

<TEXT>

The frigid weather undoubtedly caused some last-minute reconsiderations of 
tropical costume themes outside the Hollywood Palladium on Saturday, but things 
warmed up considerably on the packed dance floor at the annual Brazilian 
Carnaval '89. 
</P>
<P>
It was mainly a grand party -- with face-painting in the lobby, door prizes and 
costume contests, green and pink balloons at every table, and several costumes 
that barely met the legal requirement for decent exposure. And the party was 
savored by the remarkably mixed crowd packing the dance floor -- from young 
mothers walking their toddlers to a healthy contingent of men and women with 
gray hair in the thick of the action. 
</P>
<P>
The high-energy local group Embra Samba's set sparked long conga lines snaking 
through the milling dancers, as the horn section played flashy melodies and 
tempo changes by the percussionists signaled the transitions between songs. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Martinho da Vila's excellent headlining set strikingly emphasized 
the seductive lilt of Brazilian samba. The Brazilian's deep, soothing voice was 
suited to the medium tempos, and one measure of his prowess was his success at 
commanding the audience's attention for the 20-minute a cappella segment that 
opened his hourlong performance. DON SNOWDEN

ESCONDIDO EXPLORES TOXIC-SITE CLEANUP AT A FRACTION OF STATE ESTIMATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Frustrated with the state's failure to clean up an Escondido toxic waste dump 
designated one of California's most hazardous, city leaders are exploring doing 
the job themselves. If they proceed, the city would become one of the first 
local communities to preempt the slow-moving state cleanup program. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilwoman Carla DeDominicis said the council will consider the issue at 
its Wednesday meeting after hearing David Merk, a San Diego County 
hazardous-materials specialist, outline the problem and explore the means to 
clean up the site at a fraction of the cost estimated by the state. 
</P>
<P>
State estimates for removal of contaminated materials from the Chatham Brothers 
Barrel Yard range from $1.8 million to $2 million. Merk said the job can be 
done for less than $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Soil or Barrels Removed 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, the state declared the site in rural southwestern Escondido one of 
California's 20 most hazardous, and budgeted more than $2.2 million for tests 
and studies during the following seven years, without removing any of the 
contaminated soil or barrels of waste from the site. 
</P>
<P>
The 7-acre property near Gamble Lane and Bernardo Avenue was operated as an 
industrial waste dump from 1941 until 1980. Studies have indicated that high 
concentrations of PCBs, lead and other cancer-causing materials are present in 
the soil. About 200 barrels containing industrial wastes remain on the 
property, and it is suspected that other tanks and barrels lie beneath the 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Baker, state project manager for the Chatham site, estimated that another 
$427,000 worth of studies are needed before cleanup can begin. But Merk 
contends that the cleanup can be conducted with on-site testing to determine 
the extent of the contamination. 
</P>
<P>
He presented several estimates to officials of the state Department of Health 
Services, indicating that 
</P>
<P>
about 400 cubic yards of soil can be removed to a toxic waste dump for $118,000 
to $175,000 -- about a 10th of the cost the state has estimated to incinerate 
the toxic waste. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Borzelleri, chief of external affairs for the state Toxic Substances 
Control Division, cautioned that the Chatham site is "a very complicated 
problem" that could be made more dangerous by a hasty cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Naive Viewpoint' 
</P>
<P>
"If we move too fast, we run the risk of making significant mistakes," he said. 
"I know the residents down there think we have been dragging our feet, but that 
is a very naive viewpoint." 
</P>
<P>
Borzelleri said he knows of no other community that has undertaken a toxic 
waste cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
DeDominicis has placed the Chatham issue on the council's Wednesday night 
agenda, proposing that the city advance $200,000 for the cleanup, then attempt 
to recover the funds from the state "for its failure to act." 
</P>
<P>
State officials have been conducting cleanup work on about 70 toxic sites 
around the state with funds raised from a $100-million bond issue approved in 
1984. Those funds have dwindled to a few hundred thousand dollars, and efforts 
are under way to obtain another $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Arnold, Escondido's legislative representative in Sacramento, said that, 
of the initial $100-million fund, 67% has been spent on administration. 
</P>
<P>
Escondido has been considering placing a building moratorium on property near 
the dump site because of possible claims against the city if the contamination 
has spread. 
</P>
<P>
Recommendation Delayed 
</P>
<P>
Bob Leiter, city planning director, said his staff has delayed any 
recommendation to the council on the moratorium until the state does further 
studies to determine what areas might be contaminated. 
</P>
<P>
By mid-1988, the toxics control division had spent more than $1 million on 
studies and containment measures at Chatham, fencing the area and containing 
surface drainage from the site. 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of a citizens advisory committee last month, state officials 
unveiled another million-dollar budget containing further investigative work 
but no toxic waste removal. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Kearns, who heads the state's Long Beach toxic control office, said that 
Merk "raised a very good question" in challenging the state's waste-removal 
methods and use of the much more costly incineration method of disposal, "but 
we don't have the answer yet." 
</P>
<P>
Kearns contended that the federal Environmental Protection Agency standards 
require incineration of certain toxics, including PCBs and other volatile 
materials, but added that the rules may have been relaxed. 
</P>
<P>
EPA spokesman Terry Wilson said he knows of no federal laws to prohibit 
disposal of hazardous wastes in approved disposal sites. 
</P>
<P>
"If so, we have a whole new ballgame," because initial Chatham cleanup costs 
could be reduced from $2 million to $200,000, Kearns said. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the high cost of incinerating the waste, state officials have taken 
the position that toxics on the Chatham site, secured behind a fence, pose no 
danger to nearby residents and that available funds are better spent in 
determining if there is contamination in the air or the underground water 
table. 
</P>
<P>
Merk contends that removal of the contaminated soil and deteriorating barrels 
on the site would ensure that the air and ground water around the site are not 
further contaminated.

DRUG TRIAL; 
</P>
<P>
AMBASSADOR WON'T HAVE TO TESTIFY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge Monday refused to order the U. S. ambassador to Mexico to 
appear as a witness in a complex drug trial in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
A defense attorney had requested that the ambassador testify about the true 
status of several defendants the prosecution claims were high-ranking Mexican 
government officials when they were arrested in an undercover sting. 
</P>
<P>
U. S. District Judge William B. Enright did agree to privately review State 
Department documents to determine whether they can be used in the trial of four 
Mexicans and three Bolivians on drug charges. 
</P>
<P>
"If they (the documents) are admissible, I'll be happy to release some or all 
of them," the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
The case began in 1987 when the federal Drug Enforcement Administration and U. 
S. Customs set up an undercover sting with the intention of snaring corrupt 
Mexican officials. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arrested in La Jolla 
</P>
<P>
The investigation ended in January, 1988, when federal agents posing as drug 
dealers arrested the men in a La Jolla supermarket parking lot after $500,000 
changed hands. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the arrests, U. S. officials called them significant because 
they supposedly showed complicity of Mexican officials in the international 
drug trade. Three of the defendants, Jorge Carranza Peniche, Pablo Giron Ortiz 
and Hector Manuel Brumel Alvarez, were identified as well-connected Mexican 
government or military officials. 
</P>
<P>
However, defense attorneys in the trial, which started several weeks ago, are 
trying to show that Carranza, Giron and Brumel did not hold Mexican government 
positions. The attorneys contend their clients were posing as Mexican officials 
in order to sting U. S. drug agents, who they thought were drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Cynthia Aaron, who represents Carranza, wanted Ambassador Charles J. 
Pilliod to testify about conversations with Mexican government leaders at the 
time of the La Jolla arrests. 
</P>
<P>
In reports published last year, Pilliod was quoted as saying that Mexican 
officials told him that Carranza was discharged from the Mexican army in 1970, 
that Giron was never a commandant in the Mexican Federal Judicial Police and 
that Brumel was never a member of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Compared to North Trial 
</P>
<P>
Aaron, in asking Enright Monday to uphold her subpoena for Pilliod, compared 
the case with the arms-for-hostages trial in Washington, in which former 
President Ronald Reagan has also been identified as a potential court witness. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody is above the law," Aaron said. "Even President Reagan is 
</P>
<P>
being held on hold under subpoena in the Oliver North case." 
</P>
<P>
However, Assistant U. S. Atty. Stephen Nelson argued that the information 
Pilliod obtained was nothing more than hearsay and should not be allowed as 
evidence in the trial. 
</P>
<P>
He also argued that Pilliod is "not a trained investigator" and therefore 
cannot testify to the veracity of the information he received about the 
Mexicans' backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
"He shot from the hip when he made his comments" in the media last year, Nelson 
said. "It's the opinion of someone who has no personal knowledge. It's rank 
hearsay. He talked to someone who didn't have a clue about this case." 
</P>
<P>
In ruling in favor of Nelson's motion to quash the subpoena for Pilliod, the 
judge said he did not think there was sufficient evidence to show that the 
ambassador's testimony would be relevant. But he did say he would review State 
Department correspondence between Pilliod and Mexican government officials and 
rule on whether any of that material may be entered as evidence in the trial.

COLD SNAP CAN'T FROST OVER GLOAT FACTOR AS SAN DIEGANS TAUNT STILL-COLDER 
COUSINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
It happens every year around this time. It's as predictable as the sun gleaming 
off your windshield, or the watch'em-go-higher rates charged by SDG&amp;E. 
</P>
<P>
OK, so it has been a bit nippy lately. Still, it isn't anything like Embarrass, 
Minn., or the North Pole, of which we do like to remind ourselves because we 
feel not just warmer but prouder. 
</P>
<P>
You know the refrain: The nightly weather report on the local news opens with 
shots of several feet of snow in Buffalo, Des Moines or St. Paul, and then the 
weatherman says, "Wow, they're really suffering back there. But the weather 
here -- could it be more beautiful?" 
</P>
<P>
Why is it that Russian weather in other parts of the country arouses such 
regionalistic hubris in San Diego? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Do You Live in Paradise? 
</P>
<P>
Are we really that smug? Must we keep telling ourselves that, yes, we do live 
in paradise? 
</P>
<P>
Television weatherman Larry Mendte, who forecasts for KFMB-TV (Channel 8), 
calls it "the gloat factor." He says winter gloating is as much a part of the 
San Diego experience as Sea World or the zoo. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
"We do a thing here called the gloat phone," he said. "Once a week, we call 
someone in some other part of the country, such as Utah or Minnesota. We ask 
them what it's like there and why they continue to live there. We say, 'Did you 
really have a choice in the matter? You mean, you want to live there?' We ask 
for people to write in giving us names and phone numbers of relatives who live 
in such God-forsaken places. We've gotten more than 200 responses." 
</P>
<P>
Mendte, who grew up in Philadelphia, came here seven months ago from New York. 
He said he left a sprawling house with more than 2,000 square feet and a larger 
salary to live in a smaller home just because he is enraptured by the weather 
here -- and the life style it breeds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Winter Gloating 
</P>
<P>
"Winter gloating really is the pastime of San Diego," he said. "I guess it's 
because people who move here really want to feel they did the right thing -- 
and let's face it, everybody comes from someplace else. 'Someplace else' is 
usually cold. 
</P>
<P>
"When they hear the temperature is below zero in Minnesota, it makes them feel 
that they didn't waste their time by moving here -- into a house that's half as 
big as the one back home and to an area that probably doesn't have the sense of 
community they left behind." 
</P>
<P>
Mendte said San Diegans should continue to brag and be smug, "because when 
you've got it, flaunt it. The one thing we've always got going for us is the 
weather, which is maybe the best in the world. It really is. It's as if God set 
the thermostat." 
</P>
<P>
Clay Haswell is the news editor of the Minneapolis bureau of the Associated 
Press. He's a journalist who worked in Alaska and Boston before settling in 
Minnesota, where winter, in his words, turns people frost-in-the-face angry, 
especially when they hear from gloaters like Mendte. 
</P>
<P>
"I find hearing about the weather in San Diego really depressing," Haswell 
said. "Friends in warm-weather cities keep mailing me copies of the USA Today 
weather map, circling where they live and then circling Minnesota. We're always 
in the deep blue area, and they're in the (warm-region) white or red. One 
friend in Florida does this every two weeks or so. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Dismal, Depressing' 
</P>
<P>
"Today, it's dismal, depressing, gray, really awful. I'd love to be in San 
Diego, although I should tell you we're in the middle of a heat wave. It's 11 
above now, which is great, because it's been 20 below ever since I can 
remember." 
</P>
<P>
Told that San Diego children can play outside almost any day of the year, 
Haswell noted that his 12-year-old son, Tapio, went outside one day last week 
-- at 6:50 a.m. -- to wait for the school bus. At the time, the mercury hovered 
near 25 below zero. Tapio waited for about half an hour, but the bus never 
came. Presumably, it was a victim of the weather -- or was on its way to San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Haswell said a large part of his job is supplying Southern California 
newspapers with photographs of grisly winter scenes in and around Minneapolis 
-- cars stuck in snowbanks or women who look as though they're modeling 
February fashions in Leningrad. Every time he answers such a request, he is 
reminded of a balmy winter he can only dream about, and, he said, the 
resentment builds. 
</P>
<P>
He's heard the theory that Southern Californians are more shallow than the deep 
thinkers in the cold parts of the country, because they're not indoors in the 
winter. For that reason, this causes their brain to atrophy and their reading 
habits to erode to the level of "Doonesbury." As the theory goes, cold weather 
causes people to bond closer -- if you can't go outside to jog (how selfish can 
you be?), why not stay inside and discuss Sartre with your best friend, over a 
cup of hot cocoa? 
</P>
<P>
"That's nonsense," Haswell said. "People choose to live in Southern California 
for a reason. People here tend to get depressed in the winter. They tend to 
stop communicating. Boredom sets in. Everyone feels trapped. They feel sorry 
for themselves. We'll go to bizarre lengths to tell ourselves this isn't the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
"We've adopted a new city slogan in Minneapolis: 'We like it here.' Yeah, we 
like it here. The part I like in the winter is starting up the car, and the 
steering wheel won't turn it's so cold. Your car goes klunk, klunk, klunk down 
the road. Yeah, we like it here." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Weather for Fog Lovers 
</P>
<P>
Joel Siegal is a San Francisco attorney and sports agent who moved from San 
Diego to the city by the bay and in 1982 gave The Times this reason for doing 
so: 
</P>
<P>
"I'd grown tired of a city where the weather is a more prevalent topic of 
conversation than, say, El Salvador." 
</P>
<P>
After several years in San Francisco, Siegal said that Mark Twain's words are 
true: The coldest winter he ever spent was that summer in San Francisco. He's 
said it's weather made for fog lovers and Billie Holiday-like "Good Morning, 
Heartache" blues. 
</P>
<P>
"You might say now," he said, laughing, "that I've grown tired of a city where 
El Salvador is a more prevalent topic of conversation than, say, the weather. 
Hey, give me San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"I really miss the opportunity to go outside at all hours of the day and run. 
Here, my exercise has grown erratic. I've gone from looking like (Olympic 
diver) Greg Louganis to looking like Ernest Borgnine. The weather's great here 
if you have this thing about umbrellas or your rich uncle owns stock in winter 
jackets. I'll tell you, though, the bad part of San Diego's weather is that 
everyone wants to move there. One day, that will catch up with you. Mark my 
words." 
</P>
<P>
Al Reese is vice president of public affairs for the San Diego Convention &amp; 
Visitors Bureau. He moved here from Boston in 1969 because he was freezing. 
</P>
<P>
Reese said that, in 1988, the bureau received more than 78,000 phone calls and 
more than 23,000 letters from chilled outsiders expressing interest in a San 
Diego escape -- temporarily or permanently. Many of those calls and letters 
came when the weather around the country was at its blue-face fiercest. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota's Haswell said a town near Minneapolis is aptly named: Embarrass. He 
said it may be the coldest spot in the country and not only lives up to the 
moniker but deserves it. 
</P>
<P>
He also said that San Diegans deserve their smugness: 
</P>
<P>
"Hell, most of those people doing the gloating probably came from Minnesota or 
Iowa, which is just as cold. Probably the only thing they've ever done in their 
lives is to move to San Diego, which I guess counts for something. 
</P>
<P>
"In that one move, maybe they all showed a stroke of good sense."

DOZENS MAY HAVE BEEN ABUSED AT CARE HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The police investigation into alleged abuse at a Mira Mesa care home for foster 
children has widened, and detectives now fear that more than 5 dozen children 
may have been tortured after being placed there since the home was licensed six 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
An affidavit filed Monday also shows that a second police search of the home 
has turned up almost 700 separate items of new and unwrapped clothing that were 
allegedly denied the foster children. 
</P>
<P>
Also recovered from the home were two buckets reportedly used as makeshift 
toilets for the children. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Major Investigation' 
</P>
<P>
"This is what we would consider a major investigation," said police child-abuse 
Detective Rick Carlson. He said the case has expanded as new allegations of 
neglect have been reported as a result of interviews with some of the foster 
children. 
</P>
<P>
"It's complex. And it has a scope that encompasses a lot of people, a lot of 
witnesses and a lot of victims," Carlson said. 
</P>
<P>
Police originally believed that only 17 children had been placed in the foster 
home, run by Henri Dyson and her son, Harold. But Monday, Carlson said police 
have learned that the county Department of Social Services has placed as many 
as 62 children in the home. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if it was possible that all 62 children were abused, Carlson said: "I 
don't know that I could confirm that. But there certainly is that possibility." 
</P>
<P>
He also said that, although he and Detective Dan Dennis were originally 
assigned to the case, a group of investigators is now working to determine how 
widespread the abuse was. 
</P>
<P>
"Different people are being assigned to do different interviews," Carlson said. 
"We're trying to see how many are victims. And we're corroborating some of the 
interviews were getting." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pleaded Not Guilty 
</P>
<P>
The Dysons were arrested Jan. 19 at their home in the 8700 block of Pagoda Way 
and have since been charged with multiple counts of child abuse and child 
endangerment. They have pleaded not guilty to the charges. 
</P>
<P>
Henri Dyson was released last week from County Jail at Las Colinas on $200,000 
bail. Harold Dyson was being held Monday on $125,000 bail in the South Bay 
Detention Facility. A preliminary hearing in the case has been set for Feb. 28. 
</P>
<P>
An original search of the home by Carlson and Dennis uncovered many belts and 
sticks reportedly used to whip some of the children, as well as a post in the 
kitchen that 
</P>
<P>
one boy said he was tied to while beaten. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they also found equipment used to perform enemas. One of the 
children, a 17-month-old, nearly died after apparently being tortured with a 
water enema, they said. 
</P>
<P>
The detectives said they also found that some of the children were sleeping in 
a bathtub and on thin pads in the garage, and that others were sleeping without 
covers, sheets or blankets in upstairs bedrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the children also said they were forced to eat hot sauce and hot 
peppers and they were given pills that made them fall asleep, police said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clothing Found 
</P>
<P>
In a second search of the home, last Friday, police found 681 separate sets of 
new children's clothing stored throughout the house, including 36 girls' 
dresses in an upstairs bedroom and 99 items of clothing in a brown wicker 
chest. 
</P>
<P>
"It was in closets, cupboards and drawers," Carlson said. "There were tags on 
them. They'd never been opened." 
</P>
<P>
According to the affidavit signed by Dennis and filed in San Diego Municipal 
Court on Monday, foster parents are reimbursed for clothing they purchase for 
children under their care. To obtain this reimbursement, receipts must be 
shown. 
</P>
<P>
But, according to the affidavit, "one child related that she was told that new 
clothes were bought for her but that she could not wear them." 
</P>
<P>
The affidavit says police are now trying to determine whether the Dysons were 
being reimbursed for the clothing, then reselling the items. 
</P>
<P>
The detectives said they were told by several children at the home that they 
were forced to sleep on a thin pad in the garage, with no mattress coverings or 
blankets, or were made to sleep in upstairs bedrooms without sheets or 
blankets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Buckets Recovered 
</P>
<P>
During their first search of the home, the detectives saw several children 
sleeping in beds without covers, according to court records filed Jan. 24. But 
the second search last Friday turned up eight unopened packages of blankets, 
found in a hall closet, along with five unopened sets of sheets and two 
unopened sets of pillowcases. 
</P>
<P>
The detectives also recovered two white plastic buckets in the garage, which 
they believe some of the children were forced to use rather than being allowed 
to visit any of the four bathrooms in the house. 
</P>
<P>
According to the affidavit: "A bucket was observed previously, but not seized, 
which has been described as being used by the children as a makeshift toilet." 
</P>
<P>
The affidavit also says that some of the children told police they were given 
various medications, even if the drugs had not been specifically prescribed for 
them. However, although foster-care records, logs and receipts were taken from 
the Dyson home Friday, the "receipt and inventory" accompanying the affidavit 
do not list any medications found in the home.

<TEXT>
<P>
The so-called "bolder-than-most" rapist pleaded guilty Monday to 12 felony 
charges and will be sentenced to 50 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Alvin Ray Quarles, 26, of Paradise Hills pleaded guilty to four counts of rape, 
six counts of burglary with intent to commit a felony and two counts of robbery 
as part of a crime spree that began June 9, 1985, and ended a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
As part of a plea-bargain agreement, 50 other charges against Quarles were 
dropped. The agreement calls for him to be sentenced to 50 years in state 
prison, and he will be denied probation, Superior Court Judge Bernard Revak 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The judge set sentencing for March 6. 
</P>
<P>
Quarles was nicknamed the "bolder-than-most" rapist because he entered homes or 
motel rooms and raped women at knifepoint while their husbands, boyfriends or 
roommates were in the room. He sometimes forced the men to watch the rape or 
ordered them to go into another room by threatening to kill the women. 
</P>
<P>
Quarles' trial had been set for Thursday. If he had gone to trial and been 
convicted of each count, the maximum sentence would have been more than 200 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard Lewis said the plea bargain reflects Quarles' 
criminal activities with all 12 of his victims. Quarles will have his sentence 
reviewed after he serves 20 years. The district attorney's office will not 
oppose the review hearing, but will oppose any reduction in the sentence, Lewis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Quarles was arrested Feb. 22, 1988, in National City after he was found 
prowling around a motel. 
</P>
<P>
The rapes occurred in East San Diego, Old Town, Mission Bay, Pacific Beach and 
Mission Hills.

<P>
A 51-year-old construction worker was killed early Monday when he ran from the 
center divider into traffic on westbound Interstate 8 and was struck by a car 
and a tractor-trailer, the California Highway Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, Johnny Vindiola of El Cajon had just escaped the grasp of CHP 
officers when he ran out into traffic just west of the Interstate 805 on-ramp 
and tried to get hit, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The CHP received a radio call at 5:18 a.m. that a car was parked in the center 
divider, facing the wrong way. When officers arrived, Vindiola was standing 
outside his car, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The officers persuaded Vindiola to come to them but, soon after he was grabbed, 
Vindiola struggled free and ran out into the early-morning traffic, the 
spokesman said. CHP officers said they knew no motive for what they described 
as a suicide. The woman driving the car that first hit Vindiola told CHP 
officers she tried to avoid hitting him, but he moved in front of her.

<P>
The San Diego Housing Commission on Monday unanimously endorsed the concept of 
establishing a Housing Trust Fund and authorized a task force to conduct a 
$50,000 study of methods of raising money for the fund. 
</P>
<P>
Proposed by Evan Becker, the commission's executive director, the fund is 
envisioned as a method of raising revenue from sources other than the federal 
government, which has dramatically reduced contributions to affordable housing 
over the eight years of former President Reagan's Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, so-called "linkage fees" on commercial development, taxes, 
license fees, charitable donations and unclaimed lottery winnings might be used 
to pay for home construction and rehabilitation, rent subsidies, home buyer 
assistance or homeless programs. 
</P>
<P>
The task force will report to the commission within six months.

AUTO INSURANCE CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your article on inflated auto insurance claims was great. It showed that the 
real cause of high auto insurance rates is greedy accident "victims" and their 
equally greedy lawyers and doctors. But why did you wait until now to come out 
with this story? Why didn't you come out with it when it could have made a real 
impact -- before the elections? 
</P>
<P>
Who knows, if you had, we might now have the no-fault type insurance we need to 
eliminate the higher costs brought on by such inflated claims.

REAGAN'S $50,000 FEE FOR SPEAKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It amazes me to learn that the Reagans need more money in their retirement; 
they have set astronomical fees for any and all speaking engagements in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
I wonder what happened to the all-American idea of putting something back into 
the system when one's working days come to an end? Here in Torrance through the 
Retired Senior Volunteer Program, hundreds of retirees are handling community 
jobs with no thought of recompense and enjoying their ability to give back to 
the community something of value. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagans have more than adequate pensions to see them through their twilight 
years and friends made it possible for them to retire to a very fine home in 
Bel-Air with little cost to them. What more do they need? 
</P>
<P>
It is no wonder our young people have warped values when they see what our 
former leaders require for themselves.

NO END TO THE SCROUNGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The people have spoken. They have, in fact, screamed like midday targets of 
pickpockets and purse-snatchers. House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.) has heard 
the screams. As a result, the wages of public service on Capitol Hill will 
consist, for at least two more years, of one part salary and one part checks 
written by people who like elected officials to feel obligated to them when the 
roll is called. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the wages, $89,500 a year, will go on reaching senators and 
representatives directly from the U.S. Treasury, which gets the money from 
taxes. The rest will come from the same Americans who pay the taxes, but it 
will take more circuitous routes. It will come from honorariums for speaking to 
business people or union officials at lunch or lecturing on campus or making 
any appearance that can justify some special interest paying a fee and hoping 
for the best the next time it is particularly interested in which way a vote 
will go. 
</P>
<P>
That is the meaning of Wright's decision to let members of the House, who heard 
the screams long before Wright acknowledged them, vote against a pay raise that 
they probably deserve to demonstrate that they can and do respond to pressure 
-- an issue that never was in doubt. The raise, which would have amounted to a 
51% increase in paychecks, was to be accompanied by new rules forbidding 
members to take money on the side. 
</P>
<P>
The amount of the proposed raise was chosen by a White House commission, 
supported by President Reagan and then endorsed by President Bush. Members of 
the executive branch and the judiciary would have shared in the raises. The 
commission said that higher pay was essential if government was to compete with 
industry for top talent, partly because there have been no major jumps in 
government pay for nearly 20 years. There have been none for the same reason 
that there will be none this year: Members of Congress, who can speak without 
notes for hours on virtually any other subject, choke when they have to explain 
to voters that they need raises. 
</P>
<P>
Having choked for so many years, Congress has made catching up with inflation 
sound enormously expensive, and it is. Just to reach the buying power of salary 
levels of 1969, government officials would need 35% raises. It might have 
worked better if the commission had recommended catching up in stages rather 
than all at once. But Wright proposed something like that when he suggested 
that members settle for a 30% increase, and the public seemed not to find that 
any more palatable. 
</P>
<P>
It may well be, as cynics would have us believe, that members of Congress love 
what they do and will cling to office no matter how few groceries their checks 
will buy in yet another 20 years. It also may well be that the nation would 
survive. 
</P>
<P>
But government loses people at all levels from science to Cabinet officer 
because they cannot afford to put their children through college on federal 
pay, and that cannot be considered healthy. 
</P>
<P>
Nor can the nation take comfort from anticipating that Congress will continue 
to scrounge on the side to make ends meet, as exemplified in the financial 
arrangements for a retreat in the West Virginia hills made by Democrats over 
last weekend to discuss salary and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
About two-thirds of the expenses for transportation, room and board were picked 
up by the National Legislative Educational Foundation, a group made up of 
lobbyists for corporations and labor unions. Where did they get the money? From 
the American public, in the form of profits and dues, which probably would come 
closer to getting its money's worth from its taxes if congressional salaries 
were high enough to put an end to the scrounging.

TO UNLOCK FREEWAYS, POLITICIANS MUST ACT; 
</P>
<P>
SACRAMENTO SHOULD LOOK AT THE TASK AHEAD AND FUND IT WITH A 5-CENT GAS-TAX 
INCREASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD KATZ, Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) is the chairman of the Assembly 
Transportation Committee. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California is choking on its own traffic. And as a card-carrying member of the 
fraternity of federal, state and local elected officials, I must admit: It's 
our fault. 
</P>
<P>
While vehicles have multipled on the state's roads and freeways, politicians in 
Washington and Sacramento and local governments everywhere have pontificated 
and whined and argued and studied everything concerning transportation. 
</P>
<P>
We've come up with just about everything but specific, comprehensive solutions. 
That might require us to make some hard and unpopular decisions. 
</P>
<P>
There have been numerous stopgap, Band-Aid proposals -- a minor tax increase 
here, a bond issue there -- designed more to mollify an increasingly restive 
motoring public than to address the underlying problems. 
</P>
<P>
But the voters must share some of the blame for our sorry transportation 
situation, too. 
</P>
<P>
Poll after poll shows the public listing transportation as the No. 1 or No. 2 
problem facing California. Poll after poll also shows people willing to fork 
over no more thanan extra penny or two at the gas pump in the expectation that 
it will solve all their driving problems. 
</P>
<P>
It won't. Billion-dollar bond issues and 2-cent tax increases are like so many 
spitballs thrown at a battleship. It's going to take a lot more money, 
innovative and integrated planning and a large portion of personal and 
political sacrifice to do anything about the transportation mess. 
</P>
<P>
It's also going to mean that Californians and their political leaders are going 
to have to shake off years of dust and cobwebs. The last state gas tax increase 
-- 2 cents -- was six years ago, and its benefits were soon wiped out by both 
more fuel-efficient vehicles and by inflation. Before then the gas tax had not 
been increased since 1963. Given our past track record, doing nothing is the 
early odds-on favorite this time around, too. The overriding approach for 
politicians is reminiscent of a little boy reasoning with the splinter in his 
finger: It will hurt to take it out, so let's leave it alone and maybe it will 
cure itself. 
</P>
<P>
Some of us are ashamed of that attitude. We're proposing what we think is a 
sound, sensible and sweeping plan to address California's transportation 
problems. Its major elements include: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Requiring local elected officials to reduce urban congestion in their areas 
by 25% over the next five years. If they did, they would get more state money 
for road construction and repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Linking future development with needed transportation improvements so that 
growth in one area would not cause congestion in another. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Offsetting the increasing burden on air quality caused by more traffic by 
paying for urban reforestation projects and buying and preserving greenbelts. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Giving more money to mass-transit systems while requiring them to be more 
efficient. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Providing enough money to meet all of the state's highway construction 
plans for the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Streamlining the bureaucratic procedures that currently bog down road 
planning and construction. 
</P>
<P>
To pay for it, we would raise the gasoline tax by a nickel a gallon and raise 
commercial truck-weight fees by 30%, then tie increases over the next decade to 
the rate of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
And here's the really innovative part: Elected officials would have to take the 
responsibility to approve and carry out the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Voters would be asked to do their part by changing the state Constitution to 
modify the current government spending limit. That would keep the overall 
spending limit in place but allow us to spend the extra road dollars. Voters, 
however, would not be asked directly to approve a tax increase. That's our job. 
It's time to stop running like frightened wild beasts to the voters every time 
we face an issue of substance. 
</P>
<P>
Government by initiative is generally a sorry spectacle. The questions posed by 
initiatives are almost always poorly drafted and confusing, and sometimes 
deliberately misleading and dishonest. 
</P>
<P>
It's a wrongheaded and politically cowardly way to run this state. Elected 
officials have to come to grips with the problems that they are paid salaries 
to solve. 
</P>
<P>
"A leader has to lead," Harry Truman said, "or otherwise he has no business in 
politics." 
</P>
<P>
We have to deal with California's transportation problems now, in the most 
comprehensive and effective way we can. 
</P>
<P>
If we can't do that, as elected officials, we should seek other employment.

HEALTHY THRIFTS DIDN'T CREATE PROBLEM, AND SHOULDN'T GET THE BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT F. ADELIZZI, Robert F. Adelizzi is the president and chief operating 
officer of San Diego-based Home Federal Savings &amp; Loan. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One national survey has concluded that two-thirds of the American public 
opposes a federal bailout of the savings-and-loan industry. The choice of the 
word bailout, however, is a misnomer. The government isn't about to bail out 
the S&amp;L industry. Nor should it. However, the federal government must keep 
its insurance guarantee to depositors with money in failed thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
Taken at face value, the poll's result is not surprising. I understand how 
people are disturbed by the notion that they should pay to cover losses that 
they had nothing to do with. But the pollsters were asking the wrong question. 
</P>
<P>
Suppose that the question had been changed from "Do you favor a federal bailout 
of S&amp;Ls?" to "Should Americans who have deposited their hard-earned dollars 
into S&amp;Ls that later failed lose their money?" I think that we'd see a 
different answer from the respondents. 
</P>
<P>
And that is precisely my point. 
</P>
<P>
It is the depositors in failed thrifts who are being bailed out, not the 
S&amp;L industry. In fact, stockholders in failed thrifts have lost their 
equity investment. And that's how it should be. Top management officials of 
those thrifts have lost their jobs. And that's how it should be, too. In 
addition, where fraud existed, those responsible should spend timein a 
penitentiary. 
</P>
<P>
Until now the healthy S&amp;Ls have been forced to bear the burden to prop up 
the ailing Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. Four years ago the FSLIC 
began charg-ing them a second premium equal to one-eighth of 1% of deposits 
over and above the initial one-twelfth of 1% that all federally insured 
institutions pay for deposit insurance. 
</P>
<P>
In fractions, that might not seem like much money. In real dollars, it's a 
bundle. For instance, our institution, which has roughly $11 billion in 
deposits (the ninth-largest S&amp;L in California), paid about $23 million to 
the FSLIC in 1988. By contrast, similar-sized commercial banks paid a 
relatively tiny $9 million to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. 
</P>
<P>
But that's not the only difference. There are also higher interest rates that 
we pay to depositors for having that FSLIC sticker on our door instead of one 
signifying FDIC insurance. 
</P>
<P>
For every $100 million in deposits, the average FSLIC-insured S&amp;L pays 
$300,000 more in interest costs than do typical FDIC-insured banks. In our case 
it meant that we paid $33 million more in interest on deposits than did a bank 
of the same size. And we incurred that cost despite being one of the nation's 
healthiest financial firms -- whether bank, S&amp;L or credit union. 
</P>
<P>
Much has been written already about the causes of the nation's thrift crisis. 
Suffice it to say that there is plenty of blame to go around. No one, however, 
suggests that the problem was created by the healthy savings-and-loans. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, it is the customers and shareholders of our institution and those 
of other healthy thrifts who are getting stuck with the bill for FSLIC's 
insolvency. That inequity must stop. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the industry's special-assessment contributions, which have totaled 
more than $4.5 billion over four years, the FSLIC deficit has worsened 
precipitously. In fact, there is strong evidence that the special assessment is 
exacerbating the deficit by pushing hundreds of solvent thrifts into 
insolvency. 
</P>
<P>
It has grown to the point where that $4.5 billion could not cover the annual 
interest costs of borrowing the $100 billion needed to either pay off 
depositors of insolvent thrifts or merge the deposits into healthy S&amp;Ls. 
Additional funds must come from other sources, including the U.S. Treasury. 
</P>
<P>
So asking whether Americans favor or oppose an "S&amp;L bailout" is moot. The 
fact is that the government must keep its promise to insure accounts up to 
$100,000 per depositor. 
</P>
<P>
Further delays in appropriating the funds will only intensify the problem. At 
its current rate of losing more than $30 million a day, the FSLIC will need an 
additional $7 billion even if the crisis were resolved by August (a long shot 
at best). 
</P>
<P>
Several funding proposals have already been floated in Washington as trial 
balloons. More can be expected in the coming months before an agreement can be 
reached. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration has already taken a giant step in recognizing the 
severity of the problem and placing it near the top of its agenda of issues 
needing quick resolution. Now let's get on with solving the problem in an 
equitable and timely fashion for the benefit of America's taxpayers and our 
financial-services system.

AS BIG GUYS GOBBLE THE S&amp;LS, LET THEM PAY THEIR DUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIOT JANEWAY, Eliot Janeway is the publisher of the Janeway Letter. His 
latest book is The Economics of Chaos: On Revitalizing the American Economy (E. 
P. Dutton, 1989). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush team leaped before it looked when it suggested nicking 
savings-and-loan depositors for the sins of S&amp;L management, and got burned 
as a result. But in its fallback plan it didn't have far to look to spot the 
takeover operators as the targets for the Treasury to hit first. 
</P>
<P>
All S&amp;Ls, like Caesar's Gaul, are divided into three parts: those already 
put out of their misery and handed over to new owners, those slowly twisting in 
the wind before being blown away, and survivors. 
</P>
<P>
If President Bush directs the Treasury's zeal against the savings-and-loans, he 
can invite the electorate, Congress and the media to spend the next four years 
reading his lips without a peep of protest against hidden taxes levied on 
S&amp;L depositors. The S&amp;Ls already taken over have no stockholders who 
might complain, only proprietors keeping the goodies to themselves. They would 
not retaliate by threatening a mortgage lenders' strike. Their purpose in 
buying S&amp;Ls is not to make mortgage loans. 
</P>
<P>
The new proprietors evaluated the defunct S&amp;Ls auctioned off to them as tax 
havens, not as investment opportunities. All of them put up peanuts to pick up 
push-carts full of assets. None of them need to worry a hoot about local 
real-estate conditions, values or credit risks around the country. All of them 
have been buying -- more precisely, accepting -- rich shelter from taxes 
already paid on their own past earnings, as well as from taxes to be owed on 
future earnings. 
</P>
<P>
The President's advisers believe in the "efficient market theory." It has 
dictated a parallel White House decision to designate the banks as the 
country's future community mortgage lenders. Before the fuss started over 
charging S&amp;L depositors and sparing the owners, operators with market 
smarts spotted the connection that the sponsors of the two-bit deposit 
assessment overlooked. Anyone buying S&amp;Ls was getting an option to sell to 
eager bank bidders. 
</P>
<P>
So, on top of the tax benefits that they could count before they put their 
purchase money up, the new S&amp;L owners can also bank -- no pun intended -- 
on takeover bids from banks at prices that they can set themselves. Obviously 
only the bigger and better banks can or will bid, and they will bid against one 
another. Their targets will be local franchises to take deposits,not the 
challenge to revitalize real-estate markets in remote neighborhoods; S&amp;L 
passbooks draw the lowest interest rates in sight, and bank credit cards 
marketed to depositors earn the highest. Efficient market theory assumes that, 
given today's high risk in mortgage lending, banks will seek deposits but hold 
back on mortgage loans. "Name" banks have been feeling their way toward going 
national for years. Thanks to the disastrous consequences of diversification of 
the S&amp;Ls into commercial banking, the opportunity is coming to them faster 
than they dared hope, and as benefactors, not predators. The name banks will 
happily pay top dollar for all the S&amp;Ls that they can gobble up. By the 
time they do, the FDIC, which insures their deposits, will long since have 
taken over from the FSLIC, which no longer has the wherewithal to insure 
S&amp;L deposits. The efficient market theory has already dictated this 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
What about the second group of S&amp;Ls, the endangered ones? They're barely 
making it, subject to the danger that any new burden would whip up another 
storm and leave them its orphans. True, the calendar cut-off stopped further 
giveaways of tax benefits at the turn of the year, and Congress is not likely 
to renew the hunting season. Nevertheless, two considerations argue for 
extending insurance assessments to this second group of shaky S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
One is that the banks are now "in play," as they say in the takeover game, as 
bride-grooms ready to rescue any S&amp;Ls cast as damsels in distress. The 
incidental one is that Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has already put 
endangered S&amp;Ls on notice of their serious exposure to a jump in interest 
rates, which would hurt them more than a charge for deposit insurance. The 
Treasury admits that each full-point increase in rates will raise the S&amp;L 
bailout tab, and therefore the government spending that Greenspan deplores, by 
another $12 billion to $15 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the profitable S&amp;Ls are in a class by themselves. The bidding 
contest that the banks are positioned to start for S&amp;Ls that are under 
water or merely treading it will jump market valuations of S&amp;Ls still going 
full steam ahead. The genuinely profitable S&amp;Ls are enjoying the best of 
both worlds: worst case, can't lose; best case, big win. They will attract the 
first and the highest bank bids. 
</P>
<P>
The sooner the S&amp;Ls cut off the argument about who is to foot the bill for 
insuring S&amp;L deposits, and volunteer to do so, the more depositors they 
will have to turn over to the banks. The banks will judge the cost a bargain. A 
little birdie has belatedly tipped off the White House staff to this fact of 
financial politics. Efficient market theory invites a try at passing along 
hidden costs.

UC BERKELEY ADMISSIONS: THE BEST OF A BALANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRA MICHAEL HEYMAN, Ira Michael Heyman is the chancellor of UC Berkeley. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is the time of year when high-school seniors learn the results of their 
applications for admission to colleges and universities. Because questions have 
been raised recently about Berkeley admissions, I would like to provide a brief 
explanation. 
</P>
<P>
From its early years the University of California was able to develop an 
unusual character among institutions of higher learning. Thanks largely to wise 
leadership and its constitutional autonomy, UC was able to achieve a breadth 
and openness befitting a state university while setting high academic standards 
more like the leading private universities. 
</P>
<P>
The Master Plan for Higher Education, adopted in California in 1960, ratified 
the UC policy of selecting from among the top 12.5% of California high-school 
graduates. Inherent in UC's policy is the guarantee that every California 
applicant who meets these requirements will be admitted, although since the 
early 1970s the guarantee has not necessarily extended to the campus of first 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
After the master plan set growth limits on public campuses, UC developed 
policies to handle admissions once campuses reached those limits. Campuses at 
maximum size, it was decided in 1971, could select roughly half of their 
students on the basis of the highest grades and test scores. But no campus 
should be filled entirely on that basis. Rather, there should always be a "mix" 
of students within the 12.5% eligible group, and factors other than scores and 
grades should be considered. 
</P>
<P>
That policy still guides Berkeley and other UC campuses today. It is not unlike 
the admission patterns at the best-known private universities, which have 
always selected for diversity -- including geographical representation, 
athletic ability and other special talents, and increasingly for economic and 
ethnic diversity. These practices reflect the conviction that a well-rounded, 
diverse student body is essential to a good education. 
</P>
<P>
More than 22,000 students applied for the 1988-89 academic year's 4,350 
freshman spaces at Berkeley. A number of factors guide the selection process. 
There are three admission categories, and students from all ethnic groups and 
with other special qualifications are admitted in each of the three categories. 
</P>
<P>
Roughly 59% of the current freshman class at Berkeley was admitted in the first 
category -- entirely or primarily on the basis of top high-school grades and 
entrance-examination scores. 
</P>
<P>
Another 36% was in the second admission category -- in groups that we call 
"complemental" because they complete a balanced and diversified class. These 
are also very good students and are fully UC-eligible, and before the 1970s 
would have been admitted with no separate process. Included among the 
"complemental" groups are under-represented minorities, along with smaller 
numbers of disabled students, high test scorers, rural students, and men and 
women athletes. 
</P>
<P>
Approximately 5% of the freshmen were admitted under the "special action" 
category, meaning that they did not meet all admission requirements. The 
provision for doing this has been a long-term policy for UC and the state. 
These students accept a higher risk and get extra help to compensate for that, 
and many do succeed and graduate. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, it is Berkeley's success in meeting longstanding goals that has 
ledto recent criticism that Berkeley has gone too far and too fast in student 
affirmative action. The critics imply that Berkeley has lowered its academic 
standards and that high achievers are being excluded in favor of 
lower-achieving students. 
</P>
<P>
These are serious criticisms, but in my view they are wrong. They would have us 
select from among the top 3% or 4% of high-school graduates using only grades 
and test scores. A Berkeley undergraduate student body admitted only on that 
basis would virtually exclude several ethnic groups and be drawn mostly from a 
few wealthy big-city high schools. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is that Berkeley has maintained its standards while achieving ethnic 
diversity. Berkeley's students today are academically stronger than ever. The 
average combined SAT scores of entering freshmen have moved up over the past 
decade (from 1117 in 1978 to 1185 this year). And UC's basic entrance 
requirements are tougher now than they were then. 
</P>
<P>
We continue to face important challenges. Too many of our students from 
disadvantaged minority groups do not stay at Berkeley to graduate. But the 
record on that is improving, and efforts to help students succeed have our 
highest priority. We intend to show that a great university with a world-class 
reputation can be even stronger academically by extending opportunities to 
students from all segments of society. 
</P>
<P>
Higher education at all levels simply cannot wait until social processes in our 
society allow all groups to start life with the same advantages and to achieve 
at the same rate. California is already the state with the most ethnic 
diversity. Berkeley and all the UC campuses have a clear responsibility to 
provide California with a diverse group of future leaders.

FIRED CSUN PROFESSOR PRAISED BY COLLEAGUES AT APPEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM ENRIQUEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Cal State Northridge professor appealing his dismissal for running an alleged 
grade-selling scheme was described by colleagues Monday as honest and 
hard-working during testimony before a state personnel board judge. 
</P>
<P>
The professor, Eleazu S. Obinna, was fired last summer for allegedly promising 
A grades to students in an upper-division Pan-African studies course in 
exchange for selling $100 worth of raffle tickets to benefit a foundation he 
headed. Obinna's appeal hearing, which began in November, resumed Monday after 
a two-month delay. 
</P>
<P>
"My opinion is that he is the hardest working professor in Pan-African studies 
and one of the hardest working professors on this campus," said Ronald L.F. 
Davis, a CSUN history professor specializing in black history. "He's one of the 
few professors who was on campus five days a week." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Claims Not Believed 
</P>
<P>
Davis and Pan-African professor Tiyo Soga said that they did not believe that 
Obinna was involved in the grade-selling scheme. Obinna, a 17-year, tenured 
faculty member, has in the past denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said that Obinna had made some enemies at the university because Obinna 
was blunt and outspoken in his criticism of colleagues and superiors. 
</P>
<P>
During testimony in November, four students said that Obinna and former 
instructor Willie J. Bellamy had told them that the only work required during a 
field studies course last spring semester was to sell 20 $5 raffle tickets for 
the United Crusade Foundation. The four students said they were told that no 
other work was required. 
</P>
<P>
Bellamy, who was also fired, did not appeal. He also has denied the 
allegations. During earlier testimony, Bellamy said that students were required 
to attend two field trips, provide volunteer community service and write a 
two-page report. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Notes Taken 
</P>
<P>
An auditor with the state attorney general's office took notes during the 
hearing Monday before Administrative Law Judge Byron Berry. Deputy Atty. Gen. 
James Cordi said that his office is gathering information in the case, but he 
would not comment further. 
</P>
<P>
Students began complaining to university officials about the alleged ticket 
selling in April of last year, according to university documents. After a 
campus investigation, CSUN President James Cleary notified Obinna in May that 
he was being fired for "unprofessional conduct and dishonesty," as well as for 
lying about the grade-selling scheme. 
</P>
<P>
Obinna's appeal hearing is to continue through Thursday. He will continue to 
draw his salary during the appeals process, university officials said.

FOLLOW-HOME THIEF SUSPECTED IN 2 INCIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Two weekend robbery attempts in Tarzana and North Hollywood, including one in 
which two people were shot, may be connected to a string of robberies in which 
drivers of expensive cars have been followed home and robbed, Los Angeles 
police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
No arrests were made in either incident, but police said both are similar to 28 
other robberies or attempted robberies that have occurred since October. 
</P>
<P>
In the first of the latest incidents, John Koudsi, 53, drove his Mercedes-Benz 
from his Beverly Hills home to the North Hollywood home of his 80-year-old 
mother, Linda Koudsi, about 6 p.m. Saturday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
When John Koudsi reached the door of the Bellingham Avenue home, he was 
approached by a man with a gun who demanded his Rolex watch. While the robbery 
was taking place, Koudsi's mother opened the door and the robber fired two 
shots at them, police said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mother, Son Hit 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Ron LaRue said the first shot hit Linda Koudsi in the finger and struck her 
son in the leg. The second shot struck John Koudsi in the lower torso. The 
robber fled without taking the watch. 
</P>
<P>
LaRue said that shortly after the shooting, Linda Koudsi suffered a heart 
attack. Both she and her son were taken to an undisclosed hospital, where they 
were in stable condition Monday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
LaRue said it appears that John Koudsi was followed to the home before the 
robbery attempt. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday night, a similar robbery attempt occurred in Tarzana, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. William Gaida said a 60-year-old man, whose identity was not released, was 
driving a Mercedes-Benz from Century City to his home on Hermano Drive when he 
noticed that he was being followed. 
</P>
<P>
"He was aware of the recent robberies and was watching his rear-view mirror," 
Gaida said. 
</P>
<P>
The man made several turns in an effort to lose the car following him and when 
he believed he had been successful, he continued home, Gaida said. But as the 
man pulled into his driveway, he saw the other car. He quickly backed out of 
the driveway and the other car sped away. 
</P>
<P>
Gaida said the driver tried to follow the car but lost it. When he returned 
home a few minutes later and stopped his car, he was immediately confronted by 
a man with a handgun. The driver started blowing his car horn and the gunman 
ran away.

REFLECTIONS: MY MOTHER ALWAYS WANTED ME TO GET A JOB WITH A SUIT AND TIE.

John Gallarza has worked his way up to branch manager of the TransWorld Bank in 
Pacoima, and he continues taking classes toward a bachelors degree. In his 
success he remembers the struggle and influence of his father and mother. 
Gallarza, 36, his wife, Marlene, and their baby daughter, Nicole, live in 
Panorama City. 
</P>
<P>
 My dad is my own personal hero. I tower over him now. He's 5-8 and I'm 6-1. 
But in my eyes I still picture him from when I was a little kid. 
</P>
<P>
During World War II he served in the 3rd Army under Patton, and he was one of 
the Rangers that was sent in to find the 101st Airborne Division at Bastogne. 
He was wounded there by a German machine gun in the church steeple. 
</P>
<P>
The squad that was with him took off running. Just one guy, his buddy, who was 
also Latino, stayed with him and buried him in the snow. All of a sudden, he 
sees this motorcycle with a sidecar. Two German soldiers were looking for him 
with bayonets. My dad thought, "Jesus, this is it." Right then our tanks broke 
through the trees. 
</P>
<P>
He spent a year in a body cast. They wanted to amputate his leg, but he said: 
"No, I'm not going do that. I want my leg." They said, "Well it's gonna be 
hell." 
</P>
<P>
It's amazing to me -- he went through all that, came back from the war, was in 
uniform and on crutches, and he went into a bar and they wouldn't serve him. 
He'd go into places, and the signs would say, "No dogs or Mexicans allowed." 
</P>
<P>
Both of my parents had a very tough life. Back in those days there was a lot 
more racism, redlining, things like that. But neither of them were ever bitter 
about it. He always had the ambition to overcome that. 
</P>
<P>
My dad did not want to go back and work in the fields, so he started his own 
landscape gardening business. They struggled to make life better for my sister 
and me. They got away from the barrio and moved to Sun Valley because the 
schools were better. 
</P>
<P>
My mother always wanted me to get a job with a suit and tie. White-collar -- it 
was my mother's dream because all her life my grandparents had come home dirty. 
It's amazing how much your mother can influence you and how much making them 
both proud of you can give you motivation. 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-'60s my mother contracted cancer. I was only about 13, 14 when they 
operated on her. They took three-fourths of her stomach out at that time. They 
said if she goes five years, without recurrence, it's a good chance it's not 
going to come back. Well, about seven years later it came back. 
</P>
<P>
I wanted to be a civil engineer, so I was going to Valley College, but when my 
mom got sick again I had to drop out because of the chemotherapy. My dad was 
self-employed. Being a gardener, he couldn't let the route go to pot. I was 
still home, so I had to help them. I'd drive her to USC Medical Center every 
day. We'd come in at 10, and she wouldn't get the shot till 3 in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
She had six major surgeries. She really suffered. She weighed 54 pounds when 
she finally died. But all through it, when we were around she was always 
strong. She wouldn't cry in front of us. This whole situation stretched out for 
five years. And finally my mother said, "Look, you got to start doing something 
with your life." She told all of us, "Unfortunately, I'm going to have to die 
for the rest of you to start living again." 
</P>
<P>
I really didn't know what to do, because I was 23 years old, and I could feel 
the clock running, and I didn't have any money. My sister who was in banking, 
told me, "You should get into banking, because it's one of the few professions 
that you can get into, and if you apply yourself, you can work your way up 
through the system." 
</P>
<P>
So I hit every single bank on Van Nuys Boulevard and Ventura Boulevard, and I 
started going to school in the evenings. I was hired here in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Boy, was my mother excited when I wore that white shirt and that tie the first 
day I went in to work!

4 CHARGED IN DRUG SALE FACE 40-YEAR TERMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four Mexican citizens who became the first to be indicted under a new federal 
law that increases penalties for the sale of drugs at or near public 
playgrounds and parks face up to 40 years in prison if convicted before being 
deported, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Fernando Cedillo, 21; Gabriel Serna, 20; Oscar Rizo, 19, and Sergio Esquivel, 
19, were arrested Jan. 25 in the playground area of Lanark Park in Canoga Park 
and were charged with selling cocaine to Los Angeles undercover officers. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Susan Bryant-Deason said Friday that the men would be 
deported without serving time in prison. But she said Monday that she later 
learned that under the new law, the men face from one to 40 years in federal 
prison, without the possibility of parole or probation. After serving their 
sentences, they would be deported, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Before Jan. 1, when the law went into effect, a defendant with a similar charge 
would likely face a sentence of three years probation and six months in County 
Jail, Bryant-Deason said. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the men are being held without bail at the federal Metropolitan 
Detention Center downtown. Fernando Cedillo is free on $10,000 bail, 
authorities said. The four are scheduled to be arraigned Feb. 13. in U.S. 
District Court.

CHARGERS SAY DECISION HAS NOT YET BEEN MADE ON HIRING NEXT COACH 
</P>

<P>
Amid conflicting reports, Steve Ortmayer, the Chargers' director of football 
operations, insisted Monday that the Chargers have not targeted their next head 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
And, Ortmayer added, Charger owner Alex Spanos hasn't made up his mind yet. "If 
he has," Ortmayer said, "he hasn't told me." 
</P>
<P>
The three leading candidates to replace Al Saunders are Redskin assistant Dan 
Henning, former Illinois and California Coach Mike White and Charger defensive 
coordinator Ron Lynn. 
</P>
<P>
Last week the word around the NFL was that White was the leading candidate 
after New Orleans Coach Jim Mora and former 49ers Coach Bill Walsh made strong 
endorsements in White's behalf. Player-agent Leigh Steinberg and two NFL 
general managers said they expected White to be the choice. 
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, the pendulum swung in Henning's favor in Indianapolis at the 
scouting combine workouts where representatives from all 28 teams watched 
college seniors work out in preparation for the April draft. Ortmayer and 
Henning were present at the workouts and talked each day. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Allen, the agent for Charger wide receiver Anthony Miller, said the word 
in Indianapolis was that Henning would get the job. Allen was in Indianapolis 
recruiting college seniors to be future clients. 
</P>
<P>
But Ortmayer said Monday, "We haven't offered the job to anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Allen is the son of former Ram and Redskin Coach George Allen. Bruce 
Allen confirmed that his father has been consulting with Ortmayer during the 
coaching search process. 
</P>
<P>
Ortmayer said Monday that he hoped to have a selection by the end of this week. 
One of the hang-ups is a business trip that has taken Spanos to New York. 
Ortmayer said he will meet with Spanos before offering the job to anybody. 
Spanos is expected back this week. 
</P>
<P>
Ortmayer said the list of potential candidates has shortened to two or three 
candidates. As late as last week, the list also contained the names of Bears' 
running backs coach Johnny Roland and Charger assistants Wayne Sevier and Jerry 
Rhome. He also said he had no plans to interview any new candidates. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers have been looking for a head coach since they fired Saunders Dec. 
19. But Ortmayer dismissed the notion the Chargers have been tentative in their 
search. He cited his "system" as the reason for the delay. He also pointed to 
the need last week to draw up a list of 37 players to protect as part of the 
league's effort to implement management's attempt at free agency. 
</P>
<P>
Players not protected are unconditional free agents until April 1. Ortmayer 
said the Chargers already have talked to agents and players that are 
unconditional free agents. He said one of the players the Chargers are 
interested in is Redskin offensive lineman Russ Grimm.

And the new world champion in the men's downhill is . . . 
</P>
<P>
Pirmin Zurbriggen? Guess again, he tied for 15th. 
</P>
<P>
Marc Girardelli? Nope, Luxembourg's one-man ski team was 21st. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Mueller? No, but you're getting warmer. The defending gold medalist from 
1987 placed second and got the silver medal this time around. 
</P>
<P>
Give up? 
</P>
<P>
It was Hansjoerg Tauscher, so little known that his biography wasn't even 
included in the sport's bible, "Ski Racing Redbook," for the 1988-89 season. 
</P>
<P>
West Germany, the country that gave the world tennis stars Steffi Graf and 
Boris Becker, now has a ski champion, too. He is 21, from Oberstdorf, and his 
best finish in a World Cup downhill so far this season was a fifth place at 
Laax, Switzerland, last month. 
</P>
<P>
No matter what happens in future cup races, he's the reigning titleholder until 
the next World Alpine Ski Championships at Saalbach-Hinterglemm, Austria, Jan. 
21-Feb. 3, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Tauscher, starting No. 9, sailed down the 2 1/8-mile Beaver Creek course in 2 
minutes 10.39 seconds Monday, edging Mueller, who was No. 11, by .19 of a 
second. 
</P>
<P>
Mueller, 31, who earned his fifth straight medal -- one gold and four silvers 
-- in world championship and Olympic competition since 1984, led a Swiss sweep 
of the four places behind Tauscher. Karl Alpiger earned the bronze by finishing 
another .09 behind Mueller, and was followed by countrymen Daniel Mahrer and 
William Besse. 
</P>
<P>
If there was any prerace hint that this might be Tauscher's day, it could have 
been the fact that he was racing on Volkl skis, the same make used by 
Switzerland's Maria Walliser when she demolished the women's downhill field by 
1 1/2 seconds Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, they are very effective on courses made soft by a fresh snowfall, 
according to Mueller, who uses Blizzard skis. 
</P>
<P>
But Tauscher said: "Yes, the ski plays a big role, as was shown today and 
yesterday, but you still have to be able to ski the ski." 
</P>
<P>
Mueller did not seem disappointed with his second place, saying, "Every 
downhiller likes to win, but any medal is a good job, especially on this easy 
course and under the changed conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"The new snow in the last three days made it easy for anybody to win. We have 
not had conditions like this in a major race for five or six years. There was 
just not enough time to make the necessary adjustments in technique or (skis)." 
</P>
<P>
Mueller was not surprised that his teammate Zurbriggen, the 1988 Olympic 
downhill champion, and Girardelli, who won three of the last four World Cup 
downhills, fared so poorly here. 
</P>
<P>
"They have had the same difficulties under similar conditions before," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Tauscher didn't worry about the new snow or anything else. He just skied as if 
he owned the mountain. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a good run, but it wasn't perfect," he said. "I never thought I could 
beat the kings, Mueller and Zurbriggen. They have always been my heroes, along 
with Markus Wasmeier (of West Germany), so this is a fantasy come true. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not even able to realize yet what this gold medal will mean. It is going 
to take weeks or months for me to feel it." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he was surprised by his victory, Tauscher said, "When I had that 
finish in the top five at Laax, I knew that I might have a chance to win a race 
sometime." 
</P>
<P>
Tauscher, it turns out, came to skiing somewhat reluctantly. 
</P>
<P>
"I was 2 years old the first time I skied and I didn't enjoy it a bit," he 
said. "But later, after I started to school, I decided to try skiing again, and 
this time I liked it. Then I began racing and moving up through the different 
levels until I got to where I am now." 
</P>
<P>
Which is the new official king of the downhill for the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
Girardelli, trying for his second straight gold medal after winning the men's 
combined last week, congratulated Tauscher but said, "I had no chance in this 
race. On such a course, your equipment must be perfectly suited to the snow 
conditions. If it's not, you can forget it." 
</P>
<P>
Zurbriggen, who at least finished six places higher than Girardelli, said, "I 
can't be too unhappy, since I have already won many titles. Tauscher had a 
great race, but unfortunately, when you make one mistake on this course, you 
have lost the race. 
</P>
<P>
"My ribs (injured in a training spill last Wednesday) still bother me somewhat, 
but I hope to win a medal yet." 
</P>
<P>
Sharing 15th place with Zurbriggen, exactly 2 seconds behind the winner, were 
Christophe Ple of France and -- surprise -- an American, Jeff Olson, 23, of 
Bozeman, Mont. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps even more shocking, another U.S. racer finished ahead of Olson. Tommy 
Moe, 11 days short of his 19th birthday, was 13th, 1.88 seconds out, after 
starting No. 35. 
</P>
<P>
The native of Missoula, Mont., who now lives in Palmer, Alaska, said he had 
never been higher than 52nd in six World Cup downhills. 
</P>
<P>
He agreed with Mueller that the course "was not really tough," but added, 
"You've just got to nail every section." 
</P>
<P>
Moe nailed enough of them to build up U.S. hopes for '91 and the Winter 
Olympics the following year at Albertville, France. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's race, delayed two days by the early-weekend storm, was held in subzero 
temperatures but under sunny skies, with a crowd of about 2,000 shivering in 
the finish area. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Tamara McKinney of the United States, winner of the women's combined 
gold medal last week, will again challenge Switzerland's Vreni Schneider in the 
women's slalom at Beaver Creek. 
</P>
<P>
Then the remaining events -- the two super-G races Wednesday, the men's giant 
slalom Thursday, the women's giant slalom Saturday and the men's slalom Sunday 
-- will be held on Vail Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
Don't look now, but after the first four events, the Swiss, who won eight of 10 
gold medals in the 1987 world championships on their home slopes in 
Crans-Montana, have only one gold medal here -- the same as West Germany, 
Luxembourg and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
However, Schneider figures to break up that deadlock before sundown today.

CLIPPER LOSING STREAK TIES CLUB RECORD AT 19; DAILEY GETS SUSPENSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
There were more losses Monday for the Clippers, first one of their best players 
and then the game, the latter coming because of another awful second half. All 
in all, an average night at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
More vanishing acts might happen as soon as Wednesday, when the Clippers will 
be in danger of breaking the franchise record of 19 consecutive defeats. The 
Clippers tied that record, not to mention the fourth-worst losing streak in 
National Basketball Assn. history, Monday by losing to the Dallas Mavericks, 
129-111, before a crowd of 9,377. 
</P>
<P>
Next up on the Clippers' hit (and miss) parade is the Houston Rockets, a team 
the Clippers lost to Jan. 26. If they lose the Wednesday game, they will have 
equaled the all-time league record for consecutive losses in the same season. 
Philadelphia holds that one at 20, set in 1972-73. 
</P>
<P>
After that, there is plenty of room to sink still lower. The all-time 
consecutive losers, in order: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cleveland's 24 straight defeats, 19 games to end the 1981-82 season and 
five to start 1982-83. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Detroit's 21 straight defeats, 14 to end the 1979-80 season and seven to 
start 1980-81. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't talk about it, but you know it's there," Coach Don Casey said. "It's 
like a disease you have and you don't want to talk about it. But you have to 
find a cure." 
</P>
<P>
Any such revelations will have to come without Quintin Dailey, the Clippers' 
leading scorer, who before the game was suspended indefinitely because of 
excessive weight. Needless to say, his timing in falling badly out of shape 
could have been better. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers lost the game in the third quarter, when they converted a 63-62 
deficit with 9 minutes left into a 95-77 burial. Dallas outscored them, 41-18, 
and hit 14 of 18 shots from the field compared with the Clippers' 7 of 23. 
</P>
<P>
It was never close again. 
</P>
<P>
But the night had gone bad for the Clippers (10-36) before he game even 
started. Dailey's suspension, with pay, was the fitting opener. 
</P>
<P>
Dailey, averaging 17 points a game and shooting 48.6% from the field, topping 
his previous career best of 45.6%, came into training camp at 193 pounds. 
Casey, an assistant when Dailey played with the Chicago Bulls in 1982-83, said 
it was the best shape he had ever seen Dailey in. 
</P>
<P>
But since then, as Dailey's scoring average ballooned with his playing time, so 
did his weight. Saying he was getting bumped out of position too often, the 
weight increased to about 205. 
</P>
<P>
Monday, Dailey was weighed at 229 pounds -- 36 above what he began camp with 
and between 29 and 24 more what the Clippers would like him to be. And Dailey, 
the only team member to have a weight clause in his contract, had had violated 
that clause before. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm surprised and disappointed it went this far," Casey said before the game. 
</P>
<P>
Dailey would have started against the Mavericks after being cleared by a doctor 
for the mild concussion he suffered Saturday at Golden State. Instead, he met 
with Casey and General Manager Elgin Baylor about 45 minutes before tipoff, 
changed out of his uniform and, saying he had no comment, went home. 
</P>
<P>
"Q, in his heart and mind, was more than willing to stay and play," Casey said. 
"But his body was not able to do as such. 
</P>
<P>
"I was concerned that his shot was falling short and that he was fatigued. I 
was disappointed that is occured, mainly because we need him." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, they don't figure to get him back soon. Casey did not set a definite 
weight for Dailey's return, except to say that it should be back in the 
neighborhood of 205. In that case, the Clippers could be without their most 
consistent outside shooter for 3 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Corey Gaines will take a physical today and, if he passes, is expected to sign 
a 10-day contract. 
</P>
<P>
Gaines, who spent 3 years at UCLA, played last season at Loyola Marymount after 
transferring. He led the West Coast Athletic Conference in assists, was the 
Lions' fourth-leading scorer at 17.4 points a game and was drafted by Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers set their consecutive losing streak late in the 1981-82 season 
when the club was in San Diego. . . . Dallas' Mark Aguirre, on the subject of 
the continual trade talks involving him, including a possible deal that had him 
going to the Clippers: "I'm really kind of done with that situation. If it 
happens, it happens. But it's a situation for the front office to deal with." . 
. . Clipper General Manager Elgin Baylor said he has not talked with Maverick 
management in several days. . . . Clipper guard Gary Grant, who missed the last 
three games to be with his sick mother in Ohio, rejoined the team. . . . 
Forward Rob Lock missed the game with the flu.

A showdown between milers Said Aouita and Marcus O'Sullivan was quashed when it 
was announced that Aouita would run 3,000 meters at Friday night's Meadowlands 
Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
According to Aouita, the decision was made by meet director Ray Lumpp. But 
Lumpp said that the decision had been Aouita's. 
</P>
<P>
O'Sullivan won the Meadowlands Mile last year in a time of 3 minutes 50.94 
seconds, the third-fastest indoor clocking in history and only a little more 
than a second slower than the world record of 3:49.78, set by Eamonn Coghlan on 
the Meadowlands track in 1983.

Weightlifter Guy Greavette of Canada denied any role in a scam to foil an 
anti-doping test before the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
Testifying before a federal inquiry, Greavette contradicted earlier testimony 
by former teammate Jacques Demers that he was one of four athletes who 
attempted to beat the test last September in Vancouver by having "clean" urine 
injected into their bladders. 
</P>
<P>
Greavette said Demers and two other weightlifters, David Bolduc of Montreal and 
Paramjit Gill, like Greavette of British Columbia, were mistaken when they 
testified last week that Greavette was at a meeting where the plan to inject 
urine into the athletes' bladders was discussed. 
</P>
<P>
Demers, Bolduc and Gill all failed the test despite the urine injection scheme.

SCOTT OSTLER: YEAR AFTER YEAR, HE BUILDS TEAMS THAT LEARN HOW TO WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Scott Ostler 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I'm sitting in the Crenshaw High gym, waiting for Los Angeles' greatest active 
basketball coach to return from his regular noontime trip to a nearby burger 
joint. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll be here soon," one student tells me. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll know him," another student says. "Looks like Smokey Robinson." 
</P>
<P>
"Talks like Cosby," says the first. 
</P>
<P>
"Walks like Pat Riley," says the second. 
</P>
<P>
It's a sign of the respect that West has earned at Crenshaw that students would 
compare him to three of the giants of the entertainment industry, because 
Willie really doesn't look, talk or walk much like any of the above. 
</P>
<P>
What Willie West does do, he does better than anybody around. He coaches 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
He took over the Crenshaw varsity in 1970 and won the City championship in that 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't supposed to win it that year, that's for sure," West says. "Things 
fell into place. We had a lot of luck." 
</P>
<P>
The luck continued. In his 18 seasons, Willie's Cougars have won the City 
championship 9 times and finished second four times. They won the state high 
school tournament three times. West's career record: 405 wins, 45 losses. Very 
lucky guy. 
</P>
<P>
The wins have done wonders in terms of interior decorating of Crenshaw's 
otherwise dingy gym. The huge championship banners cover the walls. 
</P>
<P>
In terms of local fame and fortune, the winning hasn't done much for West or 
his players. He makes a large annual shipment of graduating seniors to various 
universities far from L.A., but the local college recruiters seldom come 
calling, and the college job offers don't pour in. 
</P>
<P>
Off last season's Crenshaw team, nine players got basketball scholarships to 
Division I schools. When you can send all your starters and four of your 
reserves to major colleges, you are doing something right. 
</P>
<P>
But the USCs and UCLAs and Loyolas and other Southland schools leave Crenshaw 
pretty much alone. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why a lot of (Crenshaw) kids are leaving the area, I think," West says. 
"Basically, all you need is for the kids to see you. When you get a Denny Crum 
(Louisville coach), a Dale Brown (Louisiana State coach), people like that, to 
come at least once, the kids are impressed." 
</P>
<P>
As for Willie himself, he has never had so much as an interview for a college 
coaching or assistant coaching job. He had a feeler from Occidental after his 
first Crenshaw season, but it would have meant a drastic pay cut, and West had 
just bought a house. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it's because West wouldn't score high on a charisma test. He's basically 
a shy person, a freakish trait in a basketball coach. He went to a coaching 
clinic in Las Vegas once. USC Coach George Raveling was the featured speaker, 
and Raveling spotted West and introduced him to the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"That was sort of embarrassing," West says, sheepishly. 
</P>
<P>
He's a loner, doesn't do a lot of backslapping in the basketball community. 
Pretty much just teaches, coaches, wins, goes home. 
</P>
<P>
He only reluctantly consented to an interview, and then he worried that 
whatever I would write might rile Crenshaw opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Look at this story. That Willie West is tooting his own horn again. That man's 
ego is out of control. 
</P>
<P>
He works quietly. He takes a new crew every year and builds a winner. The 
office he shares with another coach is a tiny, cluttered, windowless cell in 
the corner of the gym. No carpet, yucky yellow paint, wall-to-wall industrial 
linoleum. 
</P>
<P>
This is an inner-city school, and if you have glanced at a newspaper rack 
during the last couple of years, you know the inner city is falling apart 
faster than a $50 Chevy. 
</P>
<P>
More and more, sports is a refuge from the gangs, drugs, poverty and depression 
-- the growth industries of the area. More and more, Willie West's program is 
vital to the players, in terms of opportunity and self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
"We're sort of losing the kids a little bit," West says. "I'm fighting harder 
to keep 'em." 
</P>
<P>
He's proud of the players Crenshaw has sent to pro ball -- Marques Johnson, 
John Williams, Darwin Cook and others -- and of the major college stars such as 
Syracuse's Stephen Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
But West is most proud of the hundreds of Crenshaw Cougars who simply made it 
to college. 
</P>
<P>
"David Carter (a former Crenshaw player) came by last Friday, said he'll be 
graduating on time," West says. "We've had guys do well. Three doctors, one 
surgeon. The surgeon, I told him, 'These are the hands of a surgeon?' He used 
to be clumsy, had terrible hands. We've got two or three attorneys, some 
teachers, coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had some bad ones, too." 
</P>
<P>
One, Maurice Duckett, did time in prison for being involved in a murder. Now 
he's West's assistant coach, a reminder to the players of the possibilities -- 
of screwing up big and of turning a life around. 
</P>
<P>
West has to be more than a coach. He's the black version of The White Shadow, 
the ghetto coach in the 1970s TV series. 
</P>
<P>
How do his teams win, year after year? Some say he out-slickers his opponents, 
luring stars from all over greater Los Angeles with devious recruiting. West 
argues that most of the good players in the Crenshaw High district bus out to 
suburban high schools, and that he seldom recruits kids not referred to him. He 
says half his current team lives in the Crenshaw district. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I do less (recruiting) than anyone," he says. 
</P>
<P>
He can't win for winning. 
</P>
<P>
This season, experts tell me, the Cougars feature some of the least impressive 
talent of West's 19 seasons, yet they are 15-2. Maybe they'll get lucky, like 
the 1970-71 team. 
</P>
<P>
West is 48 years old, and his chances of moving up the coaching ladder shrink 
each year. Long ago he wanted to be a professional baseball player, but he went 
to a segregated Houston high school and feels he never got a chance. 
</P>
<P>
"Three-seventy-five as a sophomore, .394 as a junior, .494 as a senior," he 
says. "I thought baseball would be my livelihood. It didn't work out." 
</P>
<P>
He found something else he could do pretty well, although in many ways it seems 
like a losing battle. 
</P>
<P>
"Losing battle?" West says. "No, because I'm still here." 
</P>
<P>
That's the bad news and the good news.

Two San Jose State basketball players who walked out with eight teammates Jan. 
18 when they demanded the firing of Coach Bill Berry, were refused 
reinstatement because they violated National Collegiate Athletic Assn. rules, 
announced Randy Hoffman, San Jose State athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
David Hollaway, a former L.A. Crenshaw High School player, and Angelo Foccia 
were declared ineligible to compete the rest of the season because they 
received special treatment as athletes.

The benefits included discussions with an attorney without paying a nominal 
fee, and the attorney provided the players entertainment on a yacht Super Bowl 
Sunday.

Hoffman plans to pursue restoring the athletic eligibility of Hollaway, a 
freshman and Foccia, a sophomore, who expressed a desire to return to the team.

NEWSWIRE: SANDERS SHOULD JOIN THE NFL, FATHER SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The father of Barry Sanders, Oklahoma State's Heisman Trophy winner, said that 
his son should forgo his senior year at Oklahoma State, which is under National 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. sanction, and try his luck in the National Football 
League. 
</P>
<P>
"If he won the Heisman Trophy again this year, he couldn't get any more money 
or market himself any more than they are already," William Sanders said. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Sanders said in early January, when a four-year probation for Oklahoma 
State's football program was announced, that he would return for his senior 
season with the Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Sanders said he has made a decision but wouldn't say what it is. 
</P>
<P>
The Dallas Morning News reported Sunday, however, that Sanders, a junior, told 
one NFL team that he will definitely turn professional. Since Sanders has never 
redshirted, he would not be eligible for the regular NFL draft this spring 
unless he decides to challenge it in the courts. He could, however, apply for 
the summer supplemental draft.

</P>
<P>
PREMIER DUNKERS SAY CONTEST, AT $20,000, IS NOT WORTH EFFORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sam McManis 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A strong indication that the slam dunk contest has lost its status as the 
avant-garde event of the National Basketball Assn.'s All-Star weekend comes 
from reports that several marquee-value players have thought about declining 
the exclusive invitations. 
</P>
<P>
To them, the $20,000 first-place prize seems little more than loose change. As 
for the prestige of being the slam dunk champion, well, once you have won it, 
the challenge may be gone. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Jordan, the two-time defending slam dunk winner, said weeks ago that he 
did not want to compete because he feels the competition drained his energy for 
the second half of last season. Then Sunday he said he will skip the contest, 
saying that doctors have told him not to participate because of a bruised knee, 
although he has not missed a game because of it. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Nance, the first winner, in 1984, is coming off an injury that sidelined 
him for a week and reportedly is mulling the possibility of skipping the 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
Dominique Wilkins, who won it four seasons ago, said the injured ligaments in 
his right thumb will not prevent him from competing. But he added that he is 
not sure whether he wants to go to all the bother. 
</P>
<P>
"I might do it," Wilkins said. "But I might not. I'm keeping them in a sweat. 
Actually, me and Michael have been talking. If they put up more money, then 
maybe . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Don't worry, though: Otis Smith has said he definitely will be there. He has 
already sent in his RSVP. 
</P>
<P>
Although not exactly a well-known player, the Golden State Warriors' reserve 
guard surprised many in last season's competition by advancing to the 
semifinals, along with Jordan, Wilkins and Clyde Drexler. 
</P>
<P>
Smith may not be an elite player -- actually, he's only the second-best Smith 
on his team, behind Larry -- but he figures he has the necessary motivation and 
moves to win this season. 
</P>
<P>
"I can use the cash," said Smith, who is earning $225,000 in his third NBA 
season. "I need some furniture." 
</P>
<P>
But even Smith is not 100% healthy; he missed part of Monday's practice because 
of a sore knee. A team spokesman said the knee had been troubling him for some 
time, but he is expected to be able to play Wednesday against the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the league announced Monday that three players -- Kenny Walker of 
New York, Shelton Jones of Philadelphia and Chris Morris of New Jersey -- will 
take Jordan's place. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than adopting the too-cool-to-care attitude of other invitees, Smith 
said he has practiced several new dunks and variations on other gravity-defying 
standards that have suitably impressed the judges in previous competitions. He 
said he also has enlisted advice from teammates on the Warriors. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't let it affect my game, but I have given some thought to it this year," 
Smith said. "I think I took myself out of it last year because I got too 
nervous and I didn't have it planned on what dunk I'd do. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I surprised some people last year, and they found out who I was. But, 
in a sense, I didn't do as well as I should have. But I'm working on it this 
time. I'd like to keep it a surprise, but I've got something new." 
</P>
<P>
Smith will not be the favorite in Saturday's competition at the Summit in 
Houston. Portland's Drexler, who played college ball at Houston, is the 
hometown favorite, which usually assures a victory. Spud Webb won it in his 
hometown of Dallas in 1986 and Jordan in Chicago last season. 
</P>
<P>
But the player Smith is most worried about is Nance. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the factors that go into it are political things, which I don't 
control," Smith said. "But if Larry Nance decides to compete, he's the one I'm 
most worried about. Nance is the best. 
</P>
<P>
"But if I do my dunks the way I can, I think I stand a good chance of winning. 
And, because I'm relatively new at this, I've got the element of surprise." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe a victory by Otis Smith, representing all the little-known NBA players, 
will rekindle interest in an event that seemingly has lost its trendiness. 
</P>
<P>
Despite recent rumors to the contrary, Larry Bird of the Boston Celtics 
apparently will not defend his three-point shoot-out title on Saturday, 
although the league is holding a spot for him until two hours before the start 
of the competition. 
</P>
<P>
Bird, who has won all three long-distance contests, told Boston writers on 
Sunday night that his recovery from Achilles' tendon surgery has not progressed 
enough for him to compete Saturday. In fact, Bird said he might not accompany 
the Celtics on their West Coast trip, which begins after the All-Star break, 
because he still has swelling after working out. Although Bird probably will 
not compete in the three-point contest, the league has invited a foreign 
dignitary. He is Rimas Kurtinaitis, the leading scorer for the Soviet Union in 
its victory over the United States in the Seoul Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Kurtinaitis, a 6-foot-5 guard, was invited to compete by NBA officials after he 
won a similar contest in a European league. In the Soviet Union's victory over 
the U.S. team, he scored 28 points, including four three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
Bird's absence is not the only change in the Celtics. Danny Ainge has gone from 
starter to sixth man, a move that has helped the Celtics' scoring balance. 
</P>
<P>
The change occurred two weeks ago, after Ainge had missed two games because of 
back spasms, and Coach Jimmy Rodgers started rookie Brian Shaw in his place. 
When Ainge returned, Rodgers decided to stay with Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
It gives the Celtics more scoring off the bench, now that Reggie Lewis is in 
the starting lineup. And, in the four games in which he has played 30 or more 
minutes, Shaw has totaled 31 rebounds and 25 assists. 
</P>
<P>
Ainge has not complained and Rodgers said he plans on staying with the 
alignment. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to gain a scorer off the bench, which Danny has given us," Rodgers 
said. "It also allowed us to get Brian involved in quality minutes. The major 
factor was being able to come off the bench with firepower. We asked Danny to 
play that role. He's done that without any problems, and I like that. It speaks 
well for a player to do that, both physically and mentally." 
</P>
<P>
Last add Celtics: Perhaps the most obvious of the annual All-Star slights this 
time was Boston center Robert Parish's being left off the East team in favor of 
fan-favorite Moses Malone. 
</P>
<P>
Although Malone has slightly better statistics, Parish has kept the Celtics 
from going under during Bird's prolonged absence. He is having perhaps his best 
season in 13 years in the league. 
</P>
<P>
"Robert has given us great consistency during a period of time when we've been 
very inconsistent," Rodgers said. "When you have Larry Bird out, you need 
someone to go above and beyond. Robert has elevated his game on a consistent 
basis. He's having an All-Star season, without question. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, the way the system works, he's not going to be in the All-Star 
game. It's a shame he's not involved." 
</P>
<P>
Said Celtic forward Kevin McHale, who did make the All-Star team: "In the past, 
people have overlooked Robert's contributions. It's a tough thing for Robert to 
be out of the All-Star game. I'd like to see Robert make it for himself. The 
personal gratification of your teammates' respect, that makes up for not being 
in the All-Star game. And we certainly have respect for him." 
</P>
<P>
Parish said: "What I'm doing individually doesn't mean a whole lot right now. 
I'm getting more recognition with Larry out. It's always nice to be 
acknowledged." 
</P>
<P>
Walter Berry, former college player of the year and now a regular in the 
transactions column of the sports section, was recently waived by the New 
Jersey Nets and signed by the Houston Rockets. That makes four teams in three 
seasons for Berry. 
</P>
<P>
Net forward Roy Hinson recently explained why Berry is so well traveled: 
"Walter was spreading a cancer with all his complaining." 
</P>
<P>
The Detroit Pistons lost six straight road games while Roundball 1, their 
private airplane, was grounded for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
The plane was back in the air last week, and the Pistons won consecutive road 
games against Chicago and Philadelphia.

USIU COACH UNHAPPY AFTER 91-82 VICTORY

Gary Zarecky watched his U.S. International University men's basketball team 
lose most of a 24-point lead. Then Zarecky lost his patience, followed by his 
voice. 
</P>
<P>
About the only thing in the win column for the Gulls was a 91-82 victory over 
Southern Utah State at Golden Hall Monday night. And that wasn't much to look 
at. 
</P>
<P>
"That was shabby," Zarecky said. "But there are reasons for it. We've run into 
the layoff doldrums. We've played twice in the last 19 days. 
</P>
<P>
"We seem to have lost the intensity you need at the end of the season. Ninety 
percent of the teams are playing for something like a league championship. But 
despite not playing for a league title or an NCAA berth, (the players) still 
have to know they have to play to win." 
</P>
<P>
The Gulls (9-14) rolled out to a 48-31 lead at the half and increased that to 
64-40 with 14:20 remaining on a basket inside by Demetrius Laffitte. But then 
it was a downhill slide for USIU, whose coach lost his voice about midway 
though the second half. 
</P>
<P>
The Thunderbirds (8-16) outscored USIU, 7-2, to pull within 66-47. The game 
became uglier when the Gulls' Eddie Hodges got in a pushing match with the 
Thunderbirds' Randy Simkins and then hit Simkins with a left cross. Hodges was 
called for a foul and a flagrant foul and was ejected from the game and will 
also have to sit out the Gulls' next game. 
</P>
<P>
Laffitte had 20 second-half points and finished with a game-high 27 points and 
13 rebounds.

Sergio Vargas scored his 11th and 12th goals of the season to lead Monroe High 
to a 4-2 win over Grant in a Valley Pac-8 Conference soccer match at Monroe on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Valdez and Panya Chua scored a goal each for Monroe (10-1-1, 6-1-1 in

</P>
<P>
Reseda 3, Van Nuys 0 -- Sophomore Elder Noriega scored two goals and Victor 
Calderon added another as host Reseda (5-5-3, 1-5-2) notched its first Valley

</P>
<P>
Birmingham 2, North Hollywood 1 -- Ricardo Sanchez scored a breakaway goal with 
30 seconds remaining as Birmingham improved its chances of winning a playoff 
spot by raising its record to 3-3-2 in Valley Pac-8 play and 7-3-2 overall.

halftime. North Hollywood fell to 4-2-2 in conference play. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 0, San Fernando 0 -- Cleveland goalkeeper John Snaider recorded his

CSUN'S CLAYTON COOLS OFF CLU, 4-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SALKIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Cold? Yeah, you could say that," a blue -- lipped Craig Clayton offered. "The 
funny thing is, it's never to cold to hit." 
</P>
<P>
Clayton, a freshman, got his college career -- and Cal State Northridge's 1989 
season -- off to a memorable start Monday with a seventh-inning, game-winning 
home run that beat Cal Lutheran, 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
But Clayton wasn't the only one warmed by Monday's outing. For Steve Sullivan, 
it's apparently never to cold to pitch, either. 
</P>
<P>
"The weather didn't bother me all that much," the CSUN pitcher said of the 
windy conditions that dropped temperatures into the mid-40s. "I felt good out 
there today." 
</P>
<P>
Good, not great. 
</P>
<P>
Although his Matadors were in command throughout the early part of the game, 
Sullivan's control became suspect in the fifth inning, when he gave up a run on 
two singles. 
</P>
<P>
"I got a little too comfortable out there," Sullivan said. "I still knew I 
could hit my spots." 
</P>
<P>
Northridge Coach Bill Kernen wasn't as certain. When Sullivan continued having 
problems finding the strike zone in the sixth inning, Kernen called in reliever 
Brian Rosselli. But that didn't stop CLU (0-1) from climbing back into the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Down 3-1 in the seventh inning, Cal Lutheran put together three singles and a 
sacrifice to score twice and tie the game. 
</P>
<P>
Darnell Mitchell and Dan Weis began the rally with singles to left and 
sophomore David Leonhardt capped it, punching a 2-1 breaking pitch through the 
Matador infield to drive home the tying run. 
</P>
<P>
Rosselli eventually settled down, retiring the next six CLU batters he faced to 
take advantage of Clayton's homer. 
</P>
<P>
"Cal Lutheran is a good team," Kernen said, "but our schedule is going to get 
harder. If we're going to be competitive, we've got to get serious. 
</P>
<P>
"We played inexperienced. I'm not taking anything away from Cal Lutheran, they 
made a great rally. They played their hearts out. We just played green." 
</P>
<P>
But it was one of the most inexperienced of the Matadors who wound up saving 
the day. And he handled the game-winning at-bat the way a veteran would: 
Clayton came to the plate guessing for a pitch in a certain area, and he got 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"It was belt-high," Clayton said of the home run pitch. "I was looking for 
something in that area. I couldn't believe I got it." 
</P>
<P>
Clayton, who is not known for his power, contributed in a more expected way in 
the early innings with error-free defense at second base and a pair of singles 
at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
Valley 4, Fullerton 1 -- Freshman second baseman E. J. Pape was 3 for 4 with 
two doubles and an RBI for Valley in a season-opening nonconference win at 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Catcher Eric Vargas was 2 for 4 with an RBI for Valley, and Gene Demyon added 
an RBI double in the third inning as Valley took a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Left-hander Joey Kane (1-0) started and scattered eight hits through 5 2/3 
innings, allowing one run while walking three and striking out four. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Slattery pitched the final 3 2/3 innings to earn a save. DAVID SALKIN

SAN FERNANDO'S MCCRARY TO PLAY FOR CS FULLERTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Howard McCrary, a Times All-Valley defensive back for San Fernando High, has 
verbally commited to play football for Cal State Fullerton. The earliest day 
for high school seniors to sign national letters of intent is Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
McCrary visited Pacific 10 Conference schools Arizona State, Oregon, Oregon 
State and Washington, but chose Fullerton largely because of academic problems. 
McCrary has yet to score 700 or better on the Scholastic Aptitude Test and 
therefore has not met National Collegiate Athletic Assn. Prop. 48 requirements. 
</P>
<P>
The Pac-10 schools would accept McCrary on a conditional basis only, but 
Fullerton officials said he will be offered a scholarship even if he enters 
school ineligible under Prop. 48 restrictions.

Methodist next month during spring football practice. 
</P>
<P>
Whereas other Division I-A coaches will have 95 scholarship football players on 
campus, SMU Coach Forrest Gregg will have only 41. 
</P>
<P>
And that's all he will have next fall. 
</P>
<P>
The numbers: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Last year, the Mustangs were allowed to sign 15 players, of whom 13 remain. 
</P>
<P>
 -- They will get 25 more Wednesday, which is national signing day. 
</P>
<P>
 -- There are three holdovers from 1986, when other SMU players received money 
from alumni, resulting in the NCAA's so-called death penalty and leading to two 
seasons without football. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Not until well into the '90s will SMU be up to the full complement of 95 
scholarship players. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA also has reduced the Mustang coaching staff. Gregg can have only five 
assistants now. Not until June can he hire the four others to bring his staff 
up to the nine-man complement allowed in Division I-A. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Gregg will begin with three quarterbacks: Casey Clyce, Mike Romo 
and sophomore walk-on Greg Ziegler, a Michigan transfer. BOB OATES

SAN DIEGO MARKET WATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the market advancing for five consecutive weeks, stocks were ready for a 
rest or a consolidation, according to Irving Katz, director of research for 
Thomas Green/San Diego Securities. 
</P>
<P>
As the Bush Administration prepared to act on the savings and loan crisis, Home 
Federal Savings &amp; Loan and Imperial Corp. of America each gained $.625. 
</P>
<P>
Intermark reached a new high of $15 after Fuqua Industries -- which is 9.9.% 
owned by Intermark's Triton Group subsidiary -- agreed to sell Georgia Federal 
Bank. The sale evidently clears the way for some sort of combination among 
Fuqua, Intermark and Triton, Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
La Jolla Bancorp recorded a new high of $8 as the smaller San Diego banks 
continued to respond to the announcement that Southwest Bank will be acquired 
at 2.5 times book value by Security Pacific. BSD Bancorp was up. $25. 
</P>
<P>
Good gains were made last week by Henley Group, up $3.75, and Magma Power, up 
$1. 
</P>
<P>
On the downside, Synbiotics fell $.625 on word that SmithKline Beckman was 
withdrawing from an agreement to market human diagnostics being developed by 
Synbiotics. Cipher Data fell $1.125 and Price Co. dropped $1 as investors 
continued to puzzle over an impending issue of preferred stock.

Amgen, the Thousand Oaks biotechnology company, last week adopted a so-called 
"poison pill" provision that would make it more difficult for someone to 
acquire the company. Among other things, if someone acquires 20% or more of 
Amgen's stock, it would allow Amgen's other shareholders to buy additional 
Amgen stock at a 50% discount.

Amgen has several biotechnology drugs under development and is awaiting U.S.

VALLEY ROUNDUP: OREGON LURES COMPANY WITH LOTTERY MONEY

<TEXT>
<P>
Interactive Machines is moving its headquarters from Calabasas to Beaverton, 
Ore., after being lured by the Oregon Economic Development Department. 
</P>
<P>
The department said $75,000 from Oregon's state lottery was loaned to 
Interactive Machines, which makes high-performance computer-graphics machines 
used by aerospace companies and in movie special effects and commercials. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon officials said Interactive Machines used the money to underwrite the 
cost of moving, to renovate a building for its new headquarters and to pay 
moving expenses for some key employees. The loan will be forgiven if the 
company employs at least 50 people there in 1992.

VALLEY EARNINGS: TERMINAL DATA'S INCOME DROPS 58% IN 1ST QUARTER

<TEXT>
<P>
Terminal Data reported its net income fell 58% for the first quarter ended Dec.

was down 17% to $5.6 million from $6.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
President David Krar Hutton attributed the company's performance to a slowdown 
in orders for its check processing microfilmers. Terminal Data is a 
Moorpark-based company, which makes equipment that converts documents to images 
for storage on disks and microfilm.

VALLEY EARNINGS: CITADEL HOLDING'S PROFITS DROP 44% IN 4TH QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Citadel Holding Corp., the Glendale parent of Fidelity Federal Savings &amp; 
Loan, said its fourth-quarter profit tumbled 44% from a year earlier and that 
earnings for all of 1988 were down 15%. 
</P>
<P>
In the quarter that ended Dec. 31, Citadel's net income fell to $4.88 million 
from $8.77 million a year ago. The year-earlier results included a 
$1.68-million gain from a change in accounting rules. 
</P>
<P>
Citadel blamed the lower earnings on higher interest rates, which increased the 
cost Citadel had to pay to acquire funds for lending. Citadel's interest costs 
for deposits jumped 28% in the quarter to $55.7 million from $43.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
For the full year, Citadel's profit fell to $24.1 million from $28.2 million. 
Citadel's assets as of Dec. 31 totaled $4.64 billion, up 21% from $3.83 billion 
a year earlier.

ART CLASS PROVIDES MEDIUM FOR SERIOUSLY ILL TO OVERCOME DESPAIR; 
</P>
<P>
THREAT OF DEATH ACCELERATES THEIR CREATIVITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It has been two years since the last time Trisha Tierce-Madera tried to kill 
herself. Standing over a large, watery blue heart she has painted with a jagged 
brown and black crack through it, she credits a special course of free art 
classes with helping "center" her in the face of a chronic manic-depressive 
disorder. 
</P>
<P>
For John Blue, art did not rank as a great interest until he contracted a 
terminal illness. Found to be suffering from Acquired Immune Deficiency 
Syndrome two years ago, Blue has created a new career for himself in art. Using 
an ancient Japanese recipe, he makes his own paper, which he designs, decorates 
and markets as greeting cards. 
</P>
<P>
For Blue, Tierce-Madera and dozens of others living with life-threatening 
diseases, a special class, "Living Through Art," offers a safe haven and mutual 
support, a creative outlet and means for expressing their emotions. 
</P>
<P>
"We share and inspire each other through our illness," Blue said. "It gives us 
a common bond. I'd never been in an art class. It puts you in touch with other 
people who have never been in an art class before." 
</P>
<P>
The first thing a visitor notices about this free class is the tone. It's not 
morbid. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel it's extremely successful," said Dick Greene, who teaches one of the 
classes. "We grade ourselves in how our students respond. For many, it tends to 
be a bright spot in the week. It's something positive, a place they can go to 
laugh, even laugh at their disease." 
</P>
<P>
The class, which is taught Tuesdays and Thursdays at the Metropolitan Community 
Church in North Park, was started about five years ago by Barbara Peabody in 
her home. Peabody, who wrote the book, "The Screaming Room: A Mother's Journal 
of Her Son's Struggle with AIDS," teaches the 11 a.m.-2 p.m. class Tuesdays. 
Greene teaches the Thursday session. 
</P>
<P>
The teachers receive a nominal salary, but money for materials is either 
donated or raised through special events. The Metropolitan Community Church 
donates the space. 
</P>
<P>
Inspired by the success of the daytime classes, Greene, an architect and 
artist, is launching a similar free nighttime class, "Art for Life," Wednesdays 
from 6 to 9, starting this week at the Truax House, 2513 Union St. Besides 
those directly afflicted with a disease, he is inviting people who are involved 
with anyone who in any way has a life-threatening disease. No art experience is 
required. 
</P>
<P>
On a rainy day last week, only about a dozen class members came to work at the 
tables in the drafty, unheated hall. Although mobiles were the subject of the 
day, the class was basically unstructured. Students did whatever they wanted. 
In fact, some who have recently been in the hospital just came to hang out and 
talk. 
</P>
<P>
"The focus is art and feeling rather than disease and dying," said Ron Brown. 
"I look forward to coming. There's an electricity in the room. I thrive on it." 
</P>
<P>
Brown, a professional artist, heard about the class two years ago when he was 
found to have AIDS. He first came here eight months ago because "I thought I 
might learn something. My work has changed a lot. I'm able to get out the anger 
on the canvas. I wasn't able to in the studio." 
</P>
<P>
Few of the students have Brown's skills, although some, like Tim Grummon, have 
discovered unknown talent. But, regardless of their skills, students find that 
the class offers a value that sometimes is captured in the artwork. 
</P>
<P>
"We heal each other," Tierce-Madera said. "We share good times and bad times. 
We exchange phone numbers when we need to talk." 
</P>
<P>
Greene, 56, was moved to offer his assistance as a teacher when a family member 
with a deteriorating condition was placed in a retirement home. 
</P>
<P>
"As hokey as it sounds, all of us are given talents," he said. "If we don't use 
them for humanity, it's not fair. It's just not right." 
</P>
<P>
Greene and the students know that they don't have all the time in the world, so 
he takes short cuts. 
</P>
<P>
"I teach a quick way to draw," Greene said. "It's the reverse of the way art is 
taught, where students first must learn to draw a vase or a flower precisely." 
</P>
<P>
He starts the students with free-form painting, encouraging them to use 
whatever colors and abstract designs they prefer. For a realistic painting like 
a city street scene, Greene projects slides on the wall so a painter can put 
the canvas up and sketch in outlines and perspective, a skill that normally 
take months or years of study. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people say that's breaking the rules of art," Greene said, "but once 
again, they don't have time. They realize they're facing the end of their life 
and they must accelerate everything. It's fascinating to see how they jam as 
much as they can into the rest of their lives, whether it's a week, or five 
weeks or a year." 
</P>
<P>
Blue, who brought in scores of his handmade, colorful, cellophane-wrapped 
cards, has been in the class six months. Basically an optimist, he acknowledges 
that AIDS has limited his future. But it is not Blue's nature to be daunted. 
Working away at a miniature elephant sculpture, he said, "I think if they ever 
find a cure for this before anything happens to me, I may have a new career."

ART CLASS PROVIDES MEDIUM FOR SERIOUSLY ILL TO OVERCOME DESPAIR; 
</P>
<P>
ARTIST'S MID-LIFE DISCOVERY OF TALENT SEEMS ALMOST LIKE A STORY FOR A FILM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HILLIARD HARPER, Times Staff Writer

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN DIEGO -- It sounds like a script right out of a Hollywood movie. In 
mid-life, a man discovers he's been blessed with exceptional talent as an 
artist, but only learns this after he is found to have an illness that may soon 
cut short his life. 
</P>
<P>
Except that this isn't fiction. Timothy Grummon, 38, is a former Peace Corps 
administrator whose illness was diagnosed in 1985 as AIDS-related complex, or 
ARC. He discovered his artistic ability that year while attending a therapeutic 
art class for people with life-threatening diseases. 
</P>
<P>
Grummon decided he was an artist in January, 1987, and has thrown himself into 
the role. The boldly colored paintings reflect his many years spent with the 
Peace Corps in the Mideast and Asia. The unexpected colors, the sharply defined 
figures and the choice of subjects often call to mind Indian, Japanese and 
Arabian influences. 
</P>
<P>
Not only do the works have a distinctive style, but they sell. Grummon, who has 
received as much as $450 for a piece, views his new-found career positively. 
There are no second thoughts, no regret that he did not discover his artistic 
talent earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never felt angry," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Before he became ill, art was not even a hobby for Grummon. 
</P>
<P>
"I loved my profession. I was doing what I wanted. I don't regret it. I think 
living overseas has influenced my art and made me a better artist." 
</P>
<P>
Grummon's art class teacher, Barbara Peabody, supported his artistic growth and 
actually encouraged him to leave the class and work at home. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very overwhelming," he said. "As my painting ability improved, my 
health improved and my friends were dying. I'm very thankful. This has become a 
very important part of my life." 
</P>
<P>
Grummon works at a utility table in the studio he converted from the living 
room of his Hillcrest apartment. The walls are covered with his paintings, and 
others are stacked around the room. 
</P>
<P>
Despite having ARC, which has made him more vulnerable to disease, Grummon 
hasn't given up smoking or the beer he savors each night with the television 
news. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still a Type A personality . . . with a very strong life force. I consider 
myself to be very lucky to have this (ability) develop while I've been fighting 
this disease." 
</P>
<P>
After a year's work, Grummon recently finished a series of 11 "Panels of Love." 
The paintings are displayed in the form of a cross. The five vertical paintings 
refer to members of his family. The seven horizontal paintings are about 
friends. The work is being displayed each Sunday in area churches. On April 2, 
they will be consecrated in a church service by representatives of the San 
Diego Ecumenical Conference. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always been spiritual, but I'm not a 'born-again' Christian," Grummon 
said. "What motivated this for me was I wondered how my mom and dad are staying 
sane during this insane illness. What helped them stay sane is their faith." 
</P>
<P>
He asked his family members and friends to pick a verse from the Bible, and he 
interpreted them in the paintings. 
</P>
<P>
Being a late-blooming artist has both advantages and disadvantages, Grummon 
said. He doesn't have any bad painting habits to unlearn. But, because of his 
lack of formal training, he has difficulty with human features. 
</P>
<P>
The toughest part of painting is the marketing, Grummon said. That takes energy 
he doesn't have. 
</P>
<P>
But he's not complaining. Grummon calls the discovery of his talent "pretty 
magical." 
</P>
<P>
"I did a fund-raising poster for the AIDS Assistance Fund in January, 1987, and 
I realized then I had to make a commitment to art. I decided that, if I've got 
two or three years to live, I want to do it as an artist. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly I have a reason to live now because of the art."

LARROQUETTES FIND LIFE IMITATES 'JACK' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When they first met, John and Elizabeth Larroquette were toiling in Equity 
Waiver theater. Now, 14 years, one hit series, four Emmys, three kids and a 
Malibu house later, they're back in a similar setting, starring in the 
two-character play "Happy Jack" by John Godber ("Bouncers," "Shakers"). It 
opens tonight at the Coast Playhouse in West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"In those (early) days, the only obligation I had was to show up at the 
unemployment office on time," the "Night Court" star recalled wryly. "Now it's 
not nearly as easy. The rest of what's going on -- the series, remodeling a 
house, a 2-year-old baby -- it's cacophony. The only time I was thinking about 
the play was when I was on stage, and that's not good. But I think we're past 
the hump now. We know the play; it's there. Now we can start getting some fun 
out of it." 
</P>
<P>
At first, the British-born Elizabeth (she's been in the United States for 20 
years) wasn't sure she wanted to do it. "I hadn't been near acting in 10 
years," she admitted. "I mean, I loved the piece, I loved the idea of working 
with John again -- and wanted to rekindle that experience. But the prospect was 
terrifying to me. A couple times I almost didn't do it. But I'm very glad I 
did." 
</P>
<P>
The piece, which tells the story of Jack and Liz, a British miner and his wife, 
over the length of their marriage, affected both immediately. "You can see what 
a (difficult time) they had," noted John, 41. "But the upside of that is that 
they trudged through it and found whatever pleasure and joy they could in a 
relatively mundane and -- in some ways -- suffering life. 
</P>
<P>
"There is humor," he added. "There's also a facet of sadness to it. But they 
never feel sorry for themselves. You don't see them going, 'Oh, what a 
horrible, horrible life.' It's just, 'This is what I had to do and I did it.' I 
can identify my grandfather in that. He was a longshoreman in New Orleans all 
his life, working five or six days without coming home, sleeping in his truck 
or on the wharves, trying to keep going and grabbing what he could of life -- 
just like Jack does." 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth felt the connection instantly: "It's not from my experience. But 
there are touches in it that ring very true. My father was from Yorkshire. He 
wasn't a miner and he didn't work as hard as Jack. But there are certain 
locations that are very familiar to me. Some of the things (my character) says 
-- I've heard them before. For Liz, it's the acceptance of what is, and finding 
the joy in that." 
</P>
<P>
As for the experience of working with each other, "It's better now," Elizabeth, 
40, said firmly, "because we're older. Life contributes to your work. There's 
no way we could have tackled these roles 10 years ago, because we didn't have 
the life experience, the process, the understanding -- what we hope is the 
understanding -- of the work." 
</P>
<P>
John, a thoughtful and low-key antithesis to his unctuous television persona, 
nodded in agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the difference is that I would have been more cynical of these people 
10 years ago. When you're 30, you feel like, 'Hey, you live your life -- and if 
it's not working, you change it.' I would have also said that my dreams and 
aspirations were more admirable than these people's. But as time passes, you 
realize the honor of being able to do what these two people did. I mean, they 
just got in the harness and lived their lives." 
</P>
<P>
Playing those lives is also rigorous. "Being on a television series for as long 
as I have, I felt a need to exercise this particular muscle," said the actor, 
who also has appeared in the films "Blind Date," "Star Trek III" and "Stripes." 
</P>
<P>
"After six years, you sort of fall into a mode of operation. It's wonderful and 
funny, the material's there, it's extremely satisfying in all aspects. But 
you're not hanging on. I felt, as an actor, it was necessary for me to find 
that feeling again -- that fear." 
</P>
<P>
He shook his head. "I don't think it was complacency, because I work real hard 
on 'Night Court,' trying to be as inventive as possible. But it's like doing 
bench presses for three years, then deciding you have to run a race; you 
haven't used your legs in three years. That's not to denigrate the experience 
of being on television. But if I consider myself an actor and not just a 
celebrity, then there are other things I have to fulfill." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, celebrity isn't something one can check at the door. "I doubt 
we're going to be able to just hide here and do our little play," he agreed. 
"There may be a little more attention than is warranted -- just because I 
happen to be on a television series. So maybe the critics will come slightly 
like that (poised to attack)." 
</P>
<P>
And if they do judge him more harshly? "What are they going to do?," he asked. 
"Say that I should stay on TV? Fine, I will. Hopefully, they'll be able to 
judge it for what it is -- you know, 'Is it a good piece? Did they work well 
together?' The worst thing they can do is say, 'He stinks.' Big deal. I've been 
called a lot worse things than 'He stinks.' " 
</P>
<P>
In that confident mode, Larroquette is already planning his next stage project 
-- a production of Beckett's solo piece "Krapp's Last Tape," about a man 
sitting in a room listening to tapes of himself talking. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a disc jockey for many years," he explained, "so the idea of being able 
to sit in a recording studio for weeks and just create the younger Krapp really 
appeals to me. And it's something I can do by myself. That's why this ("Happy 
Jack") appealed to me: It's just her and me. We get in the same car, go to the 
theater. Then we race home at 11 and go to bed, because we know that at 5:30 
there's going to be a 2-year-old sticking airplanes in our mouths, saying, 
'It's time for me to get up!' " 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth (who segued from acting to five years in casting at Lorimar) believes 
her husband's success hasn't gone to his head. 
</P>
<P>
"Of everyone I know, John is the most suited to celebrity," she said. "I think 
it's something he always assumed would happen, and he's very comfortable with 
it. Actually, he deals with it much better than I do. I forget that we can't 
just go to the mall and everything will be fine. And I'm still surprised at the 
attention he gets. When it happens, I just want to pull back and sink into the 
background. But he deals with it very graciously." 
</P>
<P>
As he does acting with his mate. 
</P>
<P>
"I can be very egotistical about acting with other people," John acknowledged, 
"having an idea about how it should be done, making sure they give me what I 
need and I give them what they need. So the only difference -- and it wasn't 
even conscious -- is that I'd adapt more readily to something that worked for 
Elizabeth than I would for a stranger. Not from the standpoint of the little 
woman needs some help. I just found myself being a lot more receptive." 
</P>
<P>
And vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, working with him is a lot safer for me," Elizabeth nodded. "I don't 
know that I would have done this if it had not been with John -- although at 
one point I did say to Ron (Link, the director), 'If John's not going to do it, 
I still want to.' The other wonderful thing about doing this is that I don't 
give a damn what I look like. This woman is no glamour-puss; it's not even a 
consideration. It's been lovely having that out of the way."

CRITIC AT LARGE: A SEASONED BRONSON STILL PLAYS TO THE HERO IN EVERYMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, Times Arts Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At 68, Charles Bronson is the least flamboyant and the most private of American 
box-office leaders. He works almost constantly, although not always in movies 
that please him but that do well in foreign markets where, like Clint Eastwood, 
he found early stardom. 
</P>
<P>
In his latest film, "Kinjite" (Japanese for "forbidden subjects") he is once 
again a damn-the-legalities cop, a crime-hater ready to do what it takes to 
mash the criminals. But the film seems, he says, "a little more interesting 
than most I've been offered." It is, in that it centers on a clash of cultures 
born of the Japanese takeovers of American businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"It's from the point of view of a policeman who never read a business page in 
his life," Bronson said at lunch in Malibu a few days ago, "but he can see 
what's happening and he's not sure he likes it or understands it." 
</P>
<P>
The film, directed by J. Lee Thompson, is a fairly standard mix of heavy action 
and sleazy villains, but it does have quieter, subtler moments when the culture 
shock is seen from both sides of the gulf and some violence, at least, is 
forestalled. 
</P>
<P>
"I keep looking desperately for scripts that haven't been done dozens of times 
before," Bronson says. "I think guys keep writing from what they see on TV, 
copying what's already there." 
</P>
<P>
Bronson has had a sort of career within a career with the series of "Death 
Wish" films directed by his friend Michael Winner. "He's brazen when he's 
working in a street," Bronson says, smiling. "He takes it over and he doesn't 
care about complaints. But it's tough shooting with him. He demands three takes 
of every shot, and if it's hard running or some other action, it gets to you. 
J. Lee only demands two." 
</P>
<P>
"Death Wish" riled many critics with its portrait of a man taking the law into 
his own hands and acting as judge and jury, but the films were extremely well 
made and, like Eastwood's "Dirty Harry" films, they obviously touched a nerve 
in society. 
</P>
<P>
"The audience likes to see the heavies get their comeuppance," says Bronson. 
What is also true is that the films appealed to those who feel the heavies 
aren't getting sufficient comeuppance from the law. Now, at last, he says, the 
series is finished. 
</P>
<P>
It was good casting because Bronson has always been a tough hero rather than a 
romantic hero, possibly the only box-office champ who can successfully and 
regularly wear a wrap-around mustache. 
</P>
<P>
He can be warmly sympathetic, as he is in the family scenes of "Kinjite." He 
can also be ambiguous, creating doubt whether he is the good guy or the bad 
guy, as he was in one of his best roles, in the French film "Rider in the Rain" 
in 1969. There is always a sense of latent anger and danger underlying his 
performances, and it gave him the nickname "Il Brutto" in his European days. 
</P>
<P>
Bronson dislikes discussing his early life, although his is a remarkable 
success story. He was the seventh son and ninth child of 15 of a 
Lithuanian-Russian coal miner in Pennsylvania, and Bronson did some years of 
his own in the mines before he was drafted and became a tail gunner in the 
South Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
After the war he went to Philadelphia to study fine arts, got involved with a 
theater group and came West to study at the Pasadena Playhouse. He did a 
succession of small movie parts and then began to attract significant attention 
in "The Magnificent Seven," "The Dirty Dozen" and "The Great Escape." By the 
mid-'70s he was a star. 
</P>
<P>
Several of his hits were Westerns, including Sergio Leone's "Once Upon a Time 
in the West," in which he co-starred with Henry Fonda. "I saw it again not long 
ago and it holds up," Bronson says. "Slow but good." He sighs. "The Westerns 
were popular until they got comic-booked out of existence." 
</P>
<P>
He has two movies yet to do with Cannon Films and, he says, "Plenty of scripts 
come in but they're all the same. I can tell within 40 pages -- fewer than 
that, sometimes -- whether it's anything worth doing. Few scripts have good 
endings anymore. I don't know why that is." 
</P>
<P>
Bronson is more the home-centered man than ever. His wife, Jill Ireland, has 
courageously gone public with her continuing struggles with cancer and has a 
second book of encouragement for others, "Life Lines," due out this spring. 
</P>
<P>
One son is studying film at Loyola-Marymount, another is an underwater 
photographer, a third a musician on tour. One daughter is in pre-med at UCLA, a 
second is still at home, which is now in Malibu. The Bronsons also have a 1791 
farmhouse in Vermont, where they try to spend the fall and Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Both places are a very long way from the company mining town of Ehrenfeld, Pa.

SOVIET 'WELCOME' WINS TOP PRIZE IN L.A. ANIMATION CELEBRATION

<P>
"Welcome" (U.S.S.R.), Alexei Karayev's adaptation of the Dr. Seuss story 
"Thidwick, the Big-Hearted Moose," has been named the grand prize winner of the 
third Los Angeles Animation Celebration. The paint-on-glass film also won the 
$1,250 first prize from Amblin Entertainment for a film produced for children. 
</P>
<P>
Cordell Barker's "The Cat Came Back" (Canada), a wacky cartoon about a 
misshapen man trying to rid himself of an adorable but destructive kitten, was 
the big winner of the festival, garnering first prize in the category of "First 
Film Intended for Public Exhibition," a computer animation work station and 
software from Commodore Business Machines, and sharing the Los Angeles Film 
Critics' Assn. award with Gary Bardin's "Vykrustasy" (U.S.S.R.). A stop-motion 
film in which a man builds a world out of wire that he destroys in an effort to 
defend it, "Vykrustasy" won first prize for films between 5 and 15 minutes 
long. 
</P>
<P>
"White Lion" (U.S.A.) by Eric Darnell won the $10,000 first prize in the 
competition to design an animated I.D. for the MTV network. Mark Conahan earned 
the $7,500 second prize for "Music for the Eyes" (U.S.A.); Bill Plympton 
received third prize and $5,000 for "Noodle Ear" (U.S.A.). 
</P>
<P>

LOCKHEED TO CUT UP TO 800 JOBS AT AERONAUTICAL SYSTEMS UNIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD COLVIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Lockheed will eliminate 700 to 800 jobs during the next year at plants in 
Burbank, Palmdale and in Santa Clarita under company plans to reduce operating 
costs, a Lockheed spokesman said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesman James Ragsdale said the jobs will be cut through retirements and 
normal attrition in addition to layoffs. He could not say what percentage of 
the job cuts would come through layoffs, but he noted that in a normal year, 
200 employees retire and several hundred more leave for other reasons. 
</P>
<P>
The Lockheed division affected by the cuts, Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Co., 
has reduced employment by almost half, to 15,400 workers, as production of 
various aircraft -- such as the L-1011 commercial airliner and the P-3 
submarine surveillance plane -- has been phased out over the past eight years. 
</P>
<P>
Although some of the lost jobs will be salaried, many will be wage positions 
paying $13 to $17 per hour. The company is seeking to reduce its operating 
costs by 13% in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the union representing the company's hourly workers said it had 
been told as recently as December that the company hoped to avoid further 
reductions. Ragsdale said he was not aware of such statements to the union. 
</P>
<P>
"We had gotten indications that things should pick up in the early 1990s," said 
Don Nakamoto, editor of American Aeronautics, the newspaper of the 
International Assn. of Machinists &amp; Aerospace Workers, District 727. He 
said the company hoped to avoid any job reductions in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Nakamoto said Lockheed's $600-million contract to design an updated submarine 
surveillance aircraft should create more jobs at plants in Burbank, Palmdale 
and elsewhere. But Nakamoto also said Lockheed planned to continue reducing its 
Burbank operations, moving production activity north to Palmdale and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"It is an alarming situation," Nakamoto said. "We realize that this is due to 
the fact that there is a lull period in the production cycle, but our members 
are worried about it."

U.S. PROBES FASTENER MAKER IN CHATSWORTH;

<P>
FBI LOOKING INTO TEST DATA SUPPLIED BY VSI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Federal agents spent nearly 48 hours this weekend searching VSI Aerospace 
Products in Chatsworth, a unit of Fairchild Industries, in connection with a 
criminal investigation into improper testing of nuts, bolts and rivets that the 
company produces for aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
An agent at the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Seattle, where the 
investigation is headquartered, said the search of VSI was seeking evidence 
that the company supplied "false test data" for fasteners. 
</P>
<P>
The fasteners, which are sold under the original company name Voi-Shan, are 
used various military and commercial passenger aircraft. Some of the products 
include high-strength cadmium-plated fasteners that require sophisticated tests 
to ensure that they meet detailed technical requirements for aerospace 
products. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Declined Comment 
</P>
<P>
Allegations against Voi-Shan include a report that the company supplied test 
data for its products that indicated they were examined by "inspector No. 11." 
An FBI agent said, "It is alleged that there is no inspector No. 11." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Fairchild, which is based in Chantilly, Va., declined to 
comment. Local company executives declined comment as well. 
</P>
<P>
Federal agents arrived at the company's Chatsworth facility at 4:45 p.m. Friday 
and did not leave until 3:30 p.m. Sunday. They reportedly brought along 
computer equipment to log documents that they were taking. 
</P>
<P>
The task force of federal agents also included representatives of the Naval 
Investigative Service, the Air Force's Office of Special Investigations, the 
Defense Criminal Investigative Service and the Internal Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
The involvement of IRS agents suggests that financial irregularities may also 
be under investigation, but the FBI declined to comment on the scope of the 
investigation. An FBI agent declined to identify the person or persons making 
the allegations.

A group led by Minneapolis investor Irwin A. Jacobs said it raised its stake in 
Shaklee Corp. to 8.46% of the company's outstanding stock, from 6.8%. In a 
Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the group said it bought 219,000 
additional shares of Shaklee between Jan. 27 and Feb. 3 at prices ranging from 
$25.125 to $32.817 a share, increasing its holding to 1.1 million shares. In 
November, Jacobs disclosed an initial stake of more than 5% in the company and 
said he might attempt to seek control. Shaklee is a San Francisco-based food 
supplies, household goods and personal-care products distributor.

Phoenix-based Talley Industries Inc. said it has agreed to sell TRW Inc. its 
air bag business for $85 million and a share of royalties on technology over 
the next 12 years. The transaction could be worth $125 million, Talley Chairman 
William H. Mallender said. Talley has developed the air bag modules in nearby 
Mesa, Ariz. It has reserved the right to cancel the royalty entitlement any 
time after the first two years in exchange for about $38 million in cash, 
before adjustments, Mallender said. In August, 1987, Talley and TRW, 
headquartered in Cleveland, signed a long-term contract for Talley to supply 
TRW 100% of its requirements for driver-side air bag modules for some 
automobile models.

TEXAS INSTRUMENTS WINS NAVY CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Navy awarded a $459.4-million contract to Texas Instruments Inc., combining 
in one fixed-price contract its fiscal 1989 order for HARM missiles along with 
that of the Air Force and West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The service, in a brief announcement, said it was buying 2,449 High-Speed 
Anti-Radiation Missiles, or HARMs, from Texas Instruments. That combines an 
order for 1,319 for itself, an additional 950 for the Air Force and 180 for 
West Germany, the Navy said. 
</P>
<P>
The sale to West Germany, worth $35.2 million, is the first foreign sale of the 
weapon. 
</P>
<P>
The HARM missile is an air-to-ground missile used to attack enemy radars of the 
sort that guide anti-aircraft guns and surface-to-air missiles. The HARM 
guidance system is designed to automatically lock on enemy radar emissions. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy said the contract was awarded to Texas Instruments' Defense Systems 
and Electronics Group in Dallas and would be administered by its Naval Air 
Systems Command. 
</P>
<P>
"Delivery of these missiles will begin in December 1990 and will continue 
through November, 1991," the Navy said.

 A newly expanded board at Kings Road Entertainment reinstated Stephen Friedman 
as chairman and chief executive three weeks after the previous board relieved 
him of his duties. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Friedman reported boosting his stake in the Los Angeles-based 
independent movie production firm to about 41.5%, increasing the total shares 
to 2.1 million from 1.8 million. Friedman, who founded the company in 1981 and 
took it public four years later, also said in his filing with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission that he wanted to increase the size of the board and 
elect his own nominees to any new positions. 
</P>
<P>
The company said the board was expanded to nine members from six before its 
meeting Monday, with written authority of holders of a majority of its shares, 
including Friedman. New directors are Robert L. Oppenheim, Martin Davidson and 
Ira Altcheck.

STREAMLINED MANVILLE POSTS LOSS FOR YEAR

Manville Corp., the former asbestos maker that emerged from bankruptcy in 1988, 
announced Monday an after-tax charge of $1.3 billion against fourth-quarter 
earnings to reflect the cost of its reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been anticipating a charge upon emerging from Chapter 11," it said. 
"It was the price we knew we had to pay to put our asbestos financial 
obligations behind us." 
</P>
<P>
Manville also reported Monday that it had a net operating loss of $27.9 million 
in the fourth quarter on sales of $522.1 million, against an operating profit 
of $29.3 million on sales of $486 million in the comparable 1987 quarter. 
</P>
<P>
For the year, the company reported net operating profit of $89.1 million on 
sales of $2.06 billion, compared to a profit of $157.1 million on sales of 
$1.94 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Including the charges, Manville had a net loss of $1.31 billion in the fourth 
quarter, against a net loss of $59.9 million a year ago. For the year, 
including the charges, it had a net loss of $1.29 billion against a net profit 
of $72.6 million in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Denver-based Manville filed for bankruptcy in 1982 as it faced massive lawsuits 
by asbestos victims. Although its reorganization plan providing for a 
$2.5-billion trust to pay for health injury claims was approved in 1986, the 
company had been held in bankruptcy because of appeals. 
</P>
<P>
In separate news, the New York Times reported that the trust fund could run out 
of money by later this year, causing delays in payments to thousands of 
claimants. The fund is running out of money because settlement payments have 
averaged about 50% higher, and settlements have been reached at a quicker rate 
than expected when the fund was established, according to court documents and 
officials quoted in the Times story. 
</P>
<P>
The 131-year-old company was once the nation's largest maker of asbestos, a 
fireproof insulator whose fibers if inhaled can lead to lung cancer and other 
serious diseases.

Prices of pork futures collapsed Monday in a disappointed reaction to 
indications that wintry conditions in the Midwest had not slowed the movement 
of hogs to packing houses. 
</P>
<P>
In other markets, orange juice futures continued to decline, grain and soybean 
futures fell sharply, precious metals advanced and energy futures weakened. 
</P>
<P>
On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, live hog futures finished 0.50 cent to 1.42 
cents lower, with the contract for delivery in February at 42.70 cents a pound. 
Most contracts for future delivery of frozen pork bellies plummeted the 
permitted daily limit of 2 cents, with February settling at 38.82 cents a 
pound. 
</P>
<P>
Cattle futures fared much better. Live cattle settled 0.40 cent lower to 0.10 
cent higher, with February at 75.40 cents a pound; feeder cattle were 0.20 cent 
lower to 0.40 cent higher, with March at 84.47 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
Expectations for a cold weather slump in hog marketings turned out to be a bust 
for speculators who had bid pork futures up sharply on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of a decline, packers reported that hog marketings over the weekend and 
Monday were higher than both week-ago and year-ago levels. The hog flow in Iowa 
and southern Minnesota, for example, totaled 120,000 head Monday, compared to 
110,000 a week earlier and 95,000 a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Spot market prices for hogs plunged by as much as 3 cents a pound, and the 
futures market followed suit with pork belly contracts leading the way. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reluctant to Sell 
</P>
<P>
"That's what happens when you don't get enough of a storm," said Tom O'Hare, a 
livestock market analyst in New York with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
The plunging pork prices led to some weakness in the cattle market, but many 
cattle traders were reluctant to sell before Wednesday's national cattle 
inventory report from the Agriculture Department. 
</P>
<P>
That report is expected to show the nation's cattle herd as of Jan. 1 at its 
lowest level since 1960, said Charles Levitt, senior livestock analyst with 
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Weather-related selling also hit orange juice futures on the New York Cotton 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Frozen concentrated orange juice settled 4 to 4.6 cents lower, with March at 
$1.354 a pound, as fears of a freeze in the Florida citrus groves continued to 
ease. 
</P>
<P>
Corn and soybean futures fell sharply on the Chicago Board of Trade, resuming a 
trend that had been interrupted in Friday's session by unwarranted fears of a 
radiation leak in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Wheat and oat futures also closed lower. 
</P>
<P>
Grain futures gave back all the gains posted Friday, when a late rally was 
sparked by reports that the Soviet Union had ordered the evacuation of 20 
Ukrainian villages in an agricultural area contaminated with radiation from the 
1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident. 
</P>
<P>
The mere mention of the Chernobyl incident apparently was enough to prompt 
heavy buying of U.S. grain futures Friday. But the realization that there had 
been no new radiation leakage was a key factor in Monday's selloff, analysts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Precious Metals Rally 
</P>
<P>
Wheat settled 0.75 cent to 4.50 cents lower, with March at $4.2575 a bushel; 
corn was 4.75 to 6 cents lower, with March at $2.665 a bushel; oats were 4 to 
4.75 cents lower, with March at $2.145 a bushel, and soybeans were 12 to 16.25 
cents lower, with March at $7.5425 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
Gold and silver futures advanced on New York's Commodity Exchange in active 
late buying after being down for most of the session. 
</P>
<P>
Gold settled 40 to 90 cents higher, with April at $396.90 an ounce; silver was 
6 to 6.5 cents higher, with February at $5.897 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
Most energy futures retreated in mostly technical selling on the New York 
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 15 to 23 cents lower, with March at 
$17.38 a barrel; heating oil was 0.31 cent lower to 0.05 cent higher, with 
March at 50.36 cents a gallon, and unleaded gasoline was 0.51 cent lower to 
0.01 cent higher, with March at 48.74 cents a gallon.

CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE PLANS OWN ELECTRONIC TRADING SYSTEM

<P>
The Chicago Board of Trade is developing an electronic trading system, a move 
that may have been nudged ahead by the government's two-year investigation into 
fraud in futures trading, sources at the exchange said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The CBT, the world's largest futures exchange, is looking at a system which 
would compete with Globex, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's after-hours 
electronic trading system that won federal approval last week. 
</P>
<P>
Called Computerized Trade Reconstruction, the new computer system may modify 
the CBT's existing one -- which tracks and records all transactions in the 
trading pits -- by allowing the exchange to reconstitute trades when disputes 
arise. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI probe may have catalyzed the CBT's decision to approve funding for the 
electronic trading system, the unidentified sources said. The system will be 
unveiled at the Futures Industry Assn. meeting in Boca Raton, Fla., next month. 
</P>
<P>
The government probe, in which undercover agents from the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation posed as traders and allegedly found widespread trading abuses at 
the CBT and Mercantile Exchange, has focused attention on the way both 
exchanges do business. 
</P>
<P>
Futures trades are currently executed by the "open-outcry" system, in which 
traders shout and flash hand signals in noisy, chaotic pits on the floor of the 
exchanges. A future is a contract to buy or sell a commodity -- ranging from 
soybeans to currency -- at a future date at an agreed-upon price. 
</P>
<P>
The Mercantile Exchange, called the Merc, said Globex is not designed to 
replace present trading methods, but will link the exchange to others around 
the world when the Merc's trading day is over. The Merc, the world's second 
largest futures exchange, developed Globex with Reuters Holdings PLC. 
</P>
<P>
The CBT has publicly criticized computerized systems in the past, praising the 
open-outcry system instead. The exchange's board of directors is scheduled to 
meet today to recommend changes in trading procedures. The directors will 
discuss 24-hour trading using after-hours trading systems, while proposals for 
trading changes will be presented to exchange members next week, according to a 
notice to members circulated on the trading floor. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's memo at the exchange did not elaborate whether the meeting proposals 
would involve computerized trading. An exchange spokesman declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
Sources at the exchange said they expected CBT directors to pressure the 
membership into approving some type of extended trading to compete with the 
Merc. In the past, the CBT has relied on expanded trading hours at home, rather 
than electronic trading, to tap overseas and particularly Far Eastern interest. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the CBT introduced an evening session that extended its day by 3 
1/2 hours, leaving a gap of equal length between day and night trading. The 
exchange has discussed other ways to lengthen the trading day, but it has moved 
slowly toward implementing such measures until now. 
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, the Board of Trade is working on computerized trading 
with computer/electronics firms such as Tandy Corp. and Apple Computer Inc. The 
Board of Trade has already developed a pilot electronic system to speed up the 
delivery of brokerage house orders to the side of the trading pits. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department has not confirmed the existence of the undercover 
investigation at the two exchanges. But a source familiar with the probe told 
Reuters that up to 150 indictments may be handed up in the case, perhaps later 
this month.

The dollar fell Monday against several major foreign currencies but edged up 
against the British pound and Japanese yen in a mixed session marked by more 
dollar sales by central banks. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange dealers in Europe said the absence of any strong policy 
statements arising from the Group of Seven industrialized nations meeting in 
Washington Friday provided the foundation for a further strengthening of the 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
The bullishness was dampened by intervention from the Federal Reserve, West 
German Bundesbank and other European central banks, which sold dollars to stem 
the U.S. currency's rise. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar edged up again after the central banks' intervention ended but then 
went into an afternoon slide and ended the day near its lows, according to Ian 
Spence, chief currency dealer for Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pound Falls 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins, the dollar 
rose 0.43 yen to close at 129.70. Later, in London, it was quoted at 129.60 
yen. In New York, the dollar edged up to 129.41 yen from 129.40 on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In London, one pound cost $1.7345, cheaper than the $1.7410 exchange rate 
Friday. The pound also fell against the dollar in New York to $1.7366 from 
$1.7420. 
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared to late rates Friday, included: 
1.8725 West German marks, down from 1.8790; 1.5898 Swiss francs, down from 
1.5949; 1.1823 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1833; 6.3705 French francs, down 
from 6.3880, and 1,366.5 Italian lire, down from 1,371.8. 
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared to late Friday, included: 1.8810 
West German marks, up from 1.8805; 1.5969 Swiss francs, down from 1.5983; 
6.3950 French francs, unchanged; 2.1200 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1240; 
1,370.50 Italian lire, down from 1,374.50, and 1.1840 Canadian dollars, down 
from 1.1885. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices were mixed. Gold bullion traded in London at a late bid of $388.95 
an ounce, up 70 cents from Friday. In Zurich, Switzerland, the bid was $387.50, 
down $2.40. 
</P>
<P>
Financial markets were closed in Hong Kong on Monday for the Chinese Lunar New 
Year holiday. They reopen Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose 90 cents 
to $394. Later, Republic National Bank of New York said gold bullion was bid at 
$391.90 as of 4 p.m. EST, up from $391.50 late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Silver was quoted in London at a bid of $5.82 an ounce, down from Friday's 
$5.83. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery rose to $5.897 
an ounce from $5.835 on Friday.

BRUCE HOROVITZ / MARKETING: FILM MAKERS TRY TO MAKE SALES HUM BY RELEASING 
MUSIC BEFORE MOVIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Turn on any rock music radio station during the next few weeks and chances are 
you'll hear a pulsating new song from the movie "Rooftops." 
</P>
<P>
"Rooftops?" Never heard of it, right? That's OK; the film won't even hit local 
theaters until mid-March. So what is a song from its sound track doing on the 
radio already? 
</P>
<P>
Ask Tom Andrews. He's the guy whose idea it was to release the single recorded 
by Etta James and Dave Steward, "Avenue D," to radio stations this week. In 
fact, Andrews has just one major mission during the next few months: to get 
people humming the music from "Rooftops." 
</P>
<P>
After all, the same people who hum the tunes today are likely candidates to 
stand at the box office tomorrow. The soon-to-be-released film is about a gang 
of hard-luck New York teen-agers that live atop a tenement house. The film's 
director, Robert Wise, also directed "West Side Story." 
</P>
<P>
"If a movie has the right music in it," said Andrews, who has just formed a 
Hollywood music marketing company, Extended Wings, "it can create awareness for 
the film even before it opens." And if all goes according to plan, when 
"Rooftops" does open at theaters nationwide in eight weeks, it will already 
have a hit song or two -- and the sound track album will be moving quickly up 
the charts. 
</P>
<P>
More and more film studios are recognizing that movies with hit songs often 
become bigger hits at the theaters. So Andrews, who formerly was director of 
music marketing at Columbia Pictures, will be a sort of middleman between film 
studios and record companies. Basically, Extended Wings will do its best to get 
radio stations to play the music, and cable television networks such as MTV to 
play the music video. It will also be on the lookout for promotions that push 
both the movie and music at the same time. They already have filmed the music 
video to "Rooftops" on the movie set. 
</P>
<P>
Although most major film studios usually prefer to handle their own music 
marketing, some independent film studios go outside for help. "It's probably 
not the kind of thing an MCA would be interested in," said Gordon Armstrong, 
who formerly oversaw advertising at Universal Pictures and is now executive 
vice president at Universal Studios. "But there is a need for this kind of 
thing at independent film companies that don't have much expertise in this 
market." 
</P>
<P>
Newly formed New Visions Pictures, for example, has just signed Extended Wings 
to handle music marketing for its next five motion pictures, including 
"Rooftops." The film company's chairman, Taylor Hackford, directed the 
box-office hit "An Officer and a Gentleman" and co-produced the film "La 
Bamba." 
</P>
<P>
"Music and film companies have traditionally been like oil and water," Hackford 
said. He should know, too. When he directed the 1980 box-office flop "The 
Idolmaker," about a manager who tries to create rock stars, the album wasn't 
released until several weeks after the movie. "As a result," he said, "both the 
film and record suffered." 
</P>
<P>
But the studio and record company can make out like bandits, he said, if good 
music is correctly used as a marketing tool -- especially when trying to appeal 
to teen-agers. The film "Rooftops" is strongly geared toward teens, with young 
stars and several songs that were produced by Dave Stewart of the Eurythmics. 
So all the ads on radio, TV and at the movies will feature the music. "The 
object," said Hackford, "is to get teen-agers to say to themselves, 'Gee, I 
like that song, I might like the movie, too.' " 
</P>
<P>
In a bid to reach out to young trend-setters, Andrews is helping to set up 
dance contests at popular night clubs in Los Angeles, New York and Chicago that 
will feature the music -- and some stars -- from "Rooftops." The object, of 
course, is to get young people talking about the music and movie, even before 
it opens. 
</P>
<P>
"Often, movie companies and record companies have separate agendas," said Ron 
McCarrell, vice president of marketing at Capitol Records, which will issue the 
"Rooftops" album weeks before New Visions releases the movie. "The process for 
marketing a film can be far different from that of marketing a sound track. But 
if you can find someone with a foot in both businesses, that can be the key 
marketing link." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, everyone involved would love to mimic the success of the 1977 film 
"Saturday Night Fever," which was not only a box-office smash, but which also 
produced a sound track that ranks as one of history's top-selling movie albums. 
And more recently, the hit film "Dirty Dancing" sold 10 million albums and 
cassettes. But that didn't happen by accident, either. 
</P>
<P>
"Seven months before the movie opened, we saw the rough screening and began 
talking about the music and how to market it," said Mike O'Mansky, vice 
president of marketing at RCA Records in New York. In fact, RCA knew just how 
to reach teen-agers. It quickly struck a deal with a national chain of mall 
video arcades that begin to pipe in the music. The arcades sponsored contests 
that gave away records and posters to the film. 
</P>
<P>
"None of these things guarantee success," said O'Mansky, "but they sure don't 
hurt your odds." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FM Station's Billboard Comes to Life on TV 
</P>
<P>
Stevie Wonder's radio station, KJLH-FM, has never done much advertising. But 
about six months ago, Southland commuters began to see highway billboards that 
show a group of smiling disc jockeys from the popular station. Now those 
billboards have literally come to life in 10-second TV spots. 
</P>
<P>
The television ads, by Jon Byk Advertising of Los Angeles, recreate the 
billboard backgrounds that freeway drivers see. In the TV commercial, however, 
the eight disc jockeys can talk, laugh and pitch the station. "When you see the 
same thing on TV as you see on billboards," said Jon Byk, who created the 
campaign, "the synergism helps you remember it better." 
</P>
<P>

The 'Liar' Lives Despite Crash in Isuzu Sales 
</P>
<P>
Joe Isuzu is still firmly in the driver's seat at Isuzu -- even though Ward's 
Automotive Reports says 1988 domestic sales of Isuzu cars were off more than 
38% in 1988, compared to 1987. 
</P>
<P>
A series of four new spots featuring the popular comic actor David Leisure will 
hit the airwaves between now and March. The commercials were all created by the 
Los Angeles office of Della Femina, McNamee WCRS. 
</P>
<P>
One spot features Joe Isuzu calmly passing a speeding Porsche on West Germany's 
Autobahn, while the "liar" is at the wheel of an Isuzu I-Mark RS. In another, 
he lures a customer away from a Toyota dealership by shouting from a bullhorn 
about better deals on Isuzu trucks. The two other spots, which will not air 
until March, feature Joe Isuzu in two new roles: one as the storybook character 
who cries wolf once too often and the other as "Dr. Isuzustein," a takeoff on 
the mad scientist from Transylvania.

DDB Needham Wins Regional Movie Work 
</P>
<P>
When Universal Pictures released the film "Twins" last year, many people found 
out about it when they saw ads that were mutually purchased by Universal and 
various movie chains. 
</P>
<P>
This is called "co-op" advertising. And last week, Los Angeles' DDB Needham -- 
which already handles Universal's national ad business -- was awarded the film 
studio's $5-million co-op advertising business in San Diego, Sacramento, San 
Francisco and Denver. It marks the first job that the ad agency's newly formed 
entertainment division has won. 
</P>
<P>
"To start 1989 with a new piece of business is delightful," said Dave Park, 
president of DDB's Los Angeles office. The agency's first new assignment: 
placing ads for the March release of the upcoming Chevy Chase film, "Fletch 
Lives." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Designers' Contest Ad Left Out Key Points 
</P>
<P>
"Jay Chiat has won: 15 Clio awards, 16 Art Director awards, 13 One Show awards, 
15 Andy awards and 0 Designers &amp; Art Directors Assn. of London awards. See 
why the D&amp;AD awards are the hardest to win." 
</P>
<P>
That print ad -- which actually refers to awards the ad firm Chiat/Day won last 
year -- appeared in last week's issue of the trade magazine Adweek. It seems to 
imply that the event is so selective that even the Los Angeles area's most 
successful ad man, Jay Chiat, can't make the grade at the contest, which is 
co-sponsored by Adweek. 
</P>
<P>
But that's not quite the case. Chiat/Day's Los Angeles office reports that it 
didn't even enter the contest last year, and its New York office had just one 
print ad in the competition. In fact, last year was the first year the contest 
accepted entries from U.S. ad agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"In no way is this ad a snipe at Chiat/Day," said Edward Booth-Clibborn, 
chairman of the association, which plans to run more ads that cite other large 
American ad agencies that have failed to win any of its awards. "This is simply 
a campaign to show that this is the most difficult award to obtain." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Agency to Target Small Regional Latino Firms 
</P>
<P>
When Latino ad firms open in Los Angeles, they're usually on the prowl for big 
national advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, however, one Latino ad firm opened here with a far different 
mission -- local and regional advertisers. That agency, Font &amp; Vaamonde, 
will also help its New York office create some local and regional Latino 
promotions for General Foods products, including Kool-Aid and Jell-O. But it 
plans to go after mostly local operations in Los Angeles -- such as restaurant 
chains with ad budgets as small as $100,000 annually -- that want to reach 
Southland Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone else is so concerned about the big national accounts, that they're 
ignoring these smaller companies," said Elda Bravo, manager of operations for 
the West Coast office, which already has 14 employees. "We won't be bringing in 
any people from New York," she promised. "We'll only be hiring local people."

GM TO SPLIT STOCK, RAISE DIVIDEND; 
</P>

MOVES DESIGNED TO SIGNAL CONFIDENCE, ANALYSTS SAY

General Motors Corp. on Monday raised its dividend 20% and declared a 
two-for-one stock split in a move analysts said showed the auto maker's 
confidence in its near-term profits. 
</P>
<P>
The quarterly dividend per common share will be lifted to $1.50 from $1.25 a 
share, making the annual dividend $6 a share. The two-for-one stock split will 
take place later, and the dividend payment will be adjusted to reflect the 
split. 
</P>
<P>
GM also said it raised the payout on its Class E stock, which is based on the 
performances of its Electronic Data Systems Corp. unit, and on its Class H 
stock, based on the GM Hughes Electronics subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
GM disclosed in December that it is holding talks with the Howard Hughes 
Medical Institute, which owns 86% of GM's Class H shares, to help meet the 
institute's need for additional liquidity. A GM spokesman said Monday that he 
did not know whether the increase in the dividend was part of a settlement on 
that issue with the medical institute. 
</P>
<P>
GM had paid a $5-a-share common stock dividend on an annual basis since 1984. 
The increase in the dividend followed Ford Motor Co.'s decision last month to 
increase its payout by 25% to $3 a share on an annual basis. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's designed to signal confidence," said analyst Joseph Phillippi of 
Shearson Lehman Hutton. "This is the board talking, and it's a signal that they 
are confident that things are getting better." 
</P>
<P>
He noted that some analysts expected GM to raise its dividend by only 10%. 
</P>
<P>
Analyst Ronald Glantz of Montgomery Securities said that while he expected a 
dividend increase, he was surprised that GM raised the payout so early in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"This suggests that investors will be pleased with fourth-quarter earnings," 
Glantz said. 
</P>
<P>
The action means that GM's dividend yield on its common stock is 6.7%, compared 
to 5.5% at Ford and 3.6% at Chrysler. 
</P>
<P>
GM Chairman Roger B. Smith has repeatedly said that GM will post record net 
earnings for 1988. The auto maker turned in surprising record profit for the 
third quarter and is expected to report strong results next week for the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
However, GM began 1989 with soft auto sales that were down 11% in January from 
year-ago levels. The auto maker, like its U.S. competitors, has had to offer 
incentives, including cut-rate financing programs, to reduce its abnormally 
high inventories. 
</P>
<P>
Analyst David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert said GM will have no trouble 
paying the additional dividend, which will cost it $300 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
The company increased the dividend on Class E stock, representing the GM 
Electronic Data Systems Corp. earnings, by 41% to 24 cents a share. The Class H 
dividend, based on the Hughes division earnings, was raised 64% to 18 cents a 
share. 
</P>
<P>
GM also reversed one of its most unpopular decisions Monday, saying that it is 
restoring vision and hearing benefits to about 190,000 U.S. salaried employees 
and their families effective March 1. 
</P>
<P>
The auto maker said its increased profitability allowed it to respond to 
employee and retiree concerns and to restore the benefits, which were taken 
away last year. 
</P>
<P>
GM's decision to end fully paid vision and hearing coverage sparked protests by 
GM workers, some of whom picketed last year's annual shareholders' meeting. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, the auto maker said it could not afford to continue the benefits, 
which it said were particularly expensive in the case of older workers and 
retirees.

GRIPES ABOUT AIRLINES RISE 50% IN JANUARY

Consumer complaints against major airlines rose 50% in January and airlines 
reported increases in late flights and mishandled baggage at the end of last 
year, but on-time performance was still well ahead of a year earlier, a 
government report said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Transportation Department, in its monthly consumer report on air travel, 
said consumer complaints against the industry reported to the department went 
from 724 in December -- the lowest level in four years -- to 1,086 in January. 
But the new total was still a 70% improvement over the 3,674 complaints 
received in January, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Complaints covered a wide variety of problems, including flight cancellations, 
ticketing mistakes, difficulty in getting refunds, lost baggage, rude 
employees, problems with smoking restrictions and claims of misleading 
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Mishandled Baggage 
</P>
<P>
The nation's 13 largest domestic carriers reported that 76.1% of their flights 
were on time in December, compared to 77.7% a month earlier. The rate was still 
nearly 10 points better than December, 1987, when one-third of all flights were 
late. 
</P>
<P>
A department news release blamed the busy Christmas-New Year holiday season for 
an increase in mishandled baggage reports filed against the carriers in 
December. The reports averaged 8.58 for each 1,000 passengers, compared to 6.17 
in November. 
</P>
<P>
The airlines covered in the monthly consumer report account for about 90% of 
domestic flight revenue. Carriers are required to report on operations in and

DEPUTY PLEADS GUILTY TO REDUCED CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A reserve deputy with the Sheriff's Department and another man charged with 
conspiring to plant heroin on a woman to whom the deputy owed money instead 
pleaded guilty Monday to charges of fraudulent use of a law enforcement 
computer. 
</P>
<P>
As part of a plea bargain, charges involving the heroin against the deputy, 
Donald Ernstmeyer, 36, and Edward Kazarian, 43, are expected to be dismissed 
when the two men are sentenced in Superior Court in San Fernando on March 20, 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Ken Barshop said. An investigation failed to turn up 
sufficient evidence to support the conspiracy charges, Barshop said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities were tipped off about the alleged drug-planting scheme and arrested 
Ernstmeyer and Kazarian on April 14 before the plan could be carried out, 
police said. No heroin was seized in the arrests. 
</P>
<P>
The woman who was to have been the victim of the drug scheme once worked for 
Ernstmeyer at an equipment rental company he owned in the Santa Clarita Valley, 
police said. The woman, who was not identified, was planning to take legal 
action against Ernstmeyer to collect a $3,700 debt, authorities said.

DRIVER, 12, LEADS POLICE ON CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 12-year-old girl driving her parents' car led police on an 85 m.p.h. chase 
through the northeast San Fernando Valley before running a red light and 
crashing into a pickup truck, Los Angeles police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Five people, including the girl, were injured in the collision. 
</P>
<P>
The chase began about 11:30 p.m. Sunday when the girl was spotted by patrol 
officers as she drove a 1977 Ford erratically in Pacoima. The officers 
attempted to pull the car over near Herrick Avenue and Pierce Street, but the 
preteen driver sped off. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the car, which also carried two boys, 13 and 16 years old, raced 
south on surface streets through Pacoima and parts of Panorama City and North 
Hollywood before heading back to Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
The girl was arrested on suspicion of reckless driving and evading arrest, 
police said. Her two passengers were treated for minor cuts and bruises at 
Pacifica Hospital of the Valley in Sun Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The pickup truck's driver, Robert Bacher, 35, of Pacoima was treated at San 
Fernando Community Hospital for broken ribs and other injuries.

Sandra Felton remembers one Halloween when her house was such a wall-to-wall 
mess that she closed the curtains and futilely tried to clear off a portion of 
the living room rug near her front door. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a messy," admits the Miami high school teacher, and she estimates that 
there are at least 7,000 chronically disorganized people like her in the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
Felton learned to control her problem, however, and recently founded Messies 
Anonymous to help others. She's coming to town to speak to a Messies Anonymous 
branch Thursday night at the Sheraton in Redondo Beach and to a Friday night 
meeting of the National Assn. of Professional Organizers, which addresses the 
same problems. 
</P>
<P>
Chronic messiness is particularly difficult for women, Felton notes, "because 
they're supposed to be organizers. If a man is a messy, he can get a woman -- a 
secretary, a wife, a girlfriend -- to help out." 
</P>
<P>
Felton says messy types range from pack rats to the "classic absent-minded 
professors. There's a story about a professor who meets a student as he's 
strolling across campus. After they finish talking, he asks the student, 'Which 
way was I going?' The student points. And the professor says, 'Good. That means 
I've eaten.' " 
</P>
<P>
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev prefers to whiz about in Russian-made limos on 
his visits to the United States. But Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita of Japan, 
whose country also makes automobiles, has been making the rounds in a 100% 
American limousine during his stay in Southern California -- a Cadillac. 
</P>
<P>
A gesture of good will in the trade war between the two nations? A spokesman 
for the Japanese Consulate here would say only that the State Department 
handled car selection for the visit. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it was enough for Takeshita to know that virtually every photographer 
who covered his downtown visit Sunday was using a Japanese-made camera. 
</P>
<P>
The customer's always right. And perhaps so is the student at upscale 
Pepperdine where parents shell out upward of $18,000 per year for tuition, room 
and board for their darlings. 
</P>
<P>
Just to remind university personnel of whom they're dealing with, 200 workers 
and executives attended a one-day course in manners at a Holiday Inn on Monday. 
The speakers were supplied by Nordstrom stores, the Marriott hotel chain and 
McCuistion and Associates (a customer service consulting group). 
</P>
<P>
The instruction was the brainstorm of Pepperdine President David Davenport, who 
has "long been impressed by the service at Nordstrom's," said schoolspokesman 
Jeff Bliss. "And he considers students customers." 
</P>
<P>
The Nordstrom's representative emphasized that good service "isn't a strategy. 
It's a commitment" but avoided any specific recommendations, such as a 
gift-wrapping service for textbooks. 
</P>
<P>
You think driving the San Diego Freeway is grueling now? 
</P>
<P>
Westways magazine, celebrating the publication's 80th anniversary, carriesthis 
1909 account of the P. A. Benton family's excursion from Los Angeles to San 
Diego in a Matheson touring car. 
</P>
<P>
It sounds like a Chevy Chase movie. 
</P>
<P>
"At Santa Ana," the adventurous Benton said, "we were informed it was 
impossible to reach San Diego by the coastline and were advised not to try it. 
. . . About halfway between San Onofre and Santa Margarita, there is a ford at 
the bottom of a very steep grade, and here the bank had been cut away, which 
made a jump off of about two feet. . . . The water in the Santa Margarita River 
was about two feet deep, but with our carburetor being located high in the 
hood, we had no difficulty in fording it. 
</P>
<P>
"Just before La Jolla, we sank axle-deep in adobe. (But) from this point to San 
Diego, the road is in good condition." 
</P>
<P>
Time of the 120-mile trip: About 12 fun-filled hours.

CHILD-CARE CENTER OFFICIALLY OPENED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A day-care center for the children of city and federal employees officially 
opened in Los Angeles on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The facility, a joint project of the city and federal government, will serve 
100 children when it reaches capacity. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of this unique joint venture partnership, city employees and federal 
workers in the Civic Center will have an affordable care facility for their 
children, which is only a short walk away," Mayor Tom Bradley said at a 
ceremony opening the center. 
</P>
<P>
The center, which opened Jan. 25 for about 30 children, charges $86 a week for 
infants and toddlers and $78 a week for 3- to 5-year-olds. Another 70 children 
will begin attending soon, said Debbe Newman of the city's child-care 
coordinator's office.

OPENING OF WILDLIFE SANCTUARY DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A wildlife lake and bird sanctuary in the Sepulveda Basin will not be opened 
until the end of the month because of a delay in obtaining a permit from the 
state Regional Water Quality Control Board, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The corps and the city of Los Angeles had hoped to open the lake in January, 
but a meeting to discuss the permit was delayed until Wednesday because some 
participants could not attend, according to Sheila Murphy, a project manager 
with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy said officials are ready to fill the lake, which would be accessible 
only by hiking trails, as soon as the water permit is granted.

vacant seat in the 50th Assembly District. Turnout is expected to be low. 
</P>
<P>
Campaign consultants said turnout could be as low as 15% for the rare February 
special election in the district encompassing Inglewood, El Segundo, 
Westchester, Lennox and parts of South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The election pits Curtis Tucker Jr., son of the late Assemblyman Curtis R. 
Tucker (D-Inglewood), against Democrats Lois Hill-Hale and Carl McGill and 
Republican Mike Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker is regarded as the favorite because of name recognition, a large 
fund-raising lead and backing by state Democratic leaders. The special election 
was called when the elder Tucker won a posthumous reelection victory in 
November, a month after his death from cancer.

YOUR BODY: COLD-WEATHER EXERCISERS NEED TO EASE INTO THEIR ROUTINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Cold-weather exercisers should increase their warm-up time to decrease injury 
risk, being careful to warm the entire body before stretching major muscle 
groups, exercise specialists say. 
</P>
<P>
Colder weather makes muscles more prone to injury, according to Dr. Ronald 
Mackenzie, medical director of Centinela National Athletic Health Institute in 
Culver City. The traditional "tree lean" -- in which exercisers lean against a 
tree or wall to stretch leg muscles -- isn't sufficient pre-exercise warm-up 
and should never be done first, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Spend time warming up the entire body, advised Cindy Baily, a Santa Monica 
physical therapist. "Shift your weight from side to side, for instance, and 
pump your arms." She recommends the overall body warm-up in any weather and 
suggests lengthening it from one minute to two in cold weather "to get blood 
flowing to major muscle groups before you stretch them." Mackenzie's alternate 
suggestion for an overall body warm-up: "Step into hip-deep Jacuzzi water for 
five minutes and walk around." 
</P>
<P>
Next, concentrate on slowly stretching specific muscles, said Bailey, paying 
particular attention to those on the front and back of the thighs and the 
buttocks. In all, spend seven to 10 minutes warming up, he advised. 
</P>
<P>
Latchkey Kids, Health 
</P>
<P>
Latchkey kids aren't ill any more often than their counterparts in 
adult-supervised care, nor is their self-esteem usually lower, researchers in 
two separate studies have concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Rickey Williams of the University of Arizona Health Sciences Center in 
Tucson and Dr. W. Thomas Boyce of the UC San Francisco Medical Center studied 
503 Tucson fifth-graders over a two-year period and found latchkey kids no more 
likely to be obese than other children, nor more likely to miss school or visit 
the school health office. 
</P>
<P>
The study, reported in the American Journal of Diseases of Children, was 
prompted by medical reports indicating that latchkey kids may be more stressed 
and that stress, in turn, might affect their physical health. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate study, Dr. Brad D. Berman of Children's Hospital in Oakland and 
an assistant clinical professor of pediatrics at UC San Francisco studied 
fourth- and sixth-graders in three Bay Area schools, separating them into four 
groups: self-care, home-care by parents or other adults, older-sibling care, or 
out-of-home day care. "Kids in self-care didn't have any lower self-esteem than 
kids in adult care. But unexpectedly, kids in older-sibling care did have lower 
self-esteem compared with the other three groups," said Berman, who presented 
his findings Monday at the western regional meeting of the Ambulatory 
Pediatrics Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers acknowledged that the optimal arrangement of adult-supervised 
care is not always available or affordable. If children must stay alone, Boyce 
said, "it's important for kids to know how they can get in touch with a parent 
and to know safety procedures such as how to answer the door and the 
telephone." 
</P>
<P>
Said Dr. Keitha Scott, a pediatrician at Kaiser Permanente Los Angeles Medical 
Center: "Kids in self-care (at age 11) probably aren't sicker. But I worry more 
about their emotional health and physical security than about obesity or visits 
to the nurse." 
</P>
<P>
Travel and Pregnancy 
</P>
<P>
Healthy pregnant women can usually travel safely if they follow some 
common-sense precautions, conclude two physicians writing in the current 
Journal of the American Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"Try to get immunizations up to date before pregnancy," said Dr. Frank Bia, an 
associate professor of medicine at Yale University School of Medicine who 
co-authored the report with Dr. Michelle Barry, also a Yale associate professor 
of medicine. "And stay out of areas where there is chloroquine-resistant 
malaria," Bia advised, citing Thailand and the Amazon region as locations to 
avoid. 
</P>
<P>
Among their other advice: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Don't plan air travel late in pregnancy. "Domestic airline regulations 
stipulate that air travel for pregnant women after 36 weeks' gestation is not 
allowed and most foreign airlines have a cutoff of 35 weeks' gestation," 
according to Bia and Barry. 
</P>
<P>
 -- To reduce the risk of phlebitis (vein inflammation), walk around as 
frequently as possible during air travel, Bia suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Forget high-altitude trekking. "Prolonged exposure of pregnant women to the 
high altitudes beyond (15,000 feet) achieved on many commercial treks has not 
been studied, and caution should be exercised," the doctors write.

MODERN WOMEN EXPLAIN RETURN TO ORTHODOXY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY LIBMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A one-time anti-war protester and member of an Oregon commune, Judith Margolis 
-- now an artist, college teacher, writer, wife and mother -- pursues the 
epitome of a busy modern life. 
</P>
<P>
She also is the quiet keeper of an ancient tradition. 
</P>
<P>
Among her people, she is called ba'alei tshuva, because as an adult, she has 
returned to her religion and chosen to practice Orthodox Judaism, the most 
traditional form of a faith whose beliefs are thousands of years old. 
</P>
<P>
Margolis, 44, is not alone. Orthodoxy, rabbis say, is growing in Los Angeles, 
where a rising number of Jews walk the streets in skull caps, patronize an 
increasing number of kosher restaurants, organize study sessions in synagogues 
and send record numbers of their children to religious schools. They follow 
strict dietary laws, pray several times daily and observe the Sabbath. 
</P>
<P>
As part of their faith, Orthodox women must meet yet other religious 
requirements -- some of which might seem to clash with elements of feminist 
thought and conduct in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Orthodoxy, for example, speaks of women's importance in running the home and 
family, not the office and the world. It limits their leadership roles in 
religious services. It details what are acceptable sexual and personal habits 
(though some of these standards are disputed among the Orthodox, some of whom 
are even more traditional than others). 
</P>
<P>
In short, the modern practice of Orthodox Judaism -- like the adherence to many 
other traditional religions -- often can require special effort, especially by 
women, to reconcile with life in the late 20th Century, the faithful say. 
</P>
<P>
But the daily process of dealing with the minor details and major concerns to 
adhere to their faith has not dissuaded women from returning to Orthodoxy. 
</P>
<P>
To artist Margolis, for example, integrating her religion and her life can be 
part of a creative trade-off that actually improves her work. 
</P>
<P>
To advertising executive Susan Weintraub, it is a lifelong learning process 
about a dignified, disciplined way of being. 
</P>
<P>
And to physician Sharon Schwartz Brooks, it is a connection with history and 
the divine. 
</P>
<P>
Judith Margolis has not always approved of Orthodox practices. She learned 
about them only after meeting her second husband, David Margolis, a writer who 
developed an interest in traditional Judaism while researching a history 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after they were married, the couple moved to San Francisco and joined a 
small, storefront synagogue, where for the first time she had close contact 
with Orthodox Jews. 
</P>
<P>
"My husband was drawn immediately and made a commitment to be observant," she 
said, adding that she acceded to his wishes because that preserved the harmony 
in their small family, which then included a daughter and son, ages 6 and 7. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Changing Views 
</P>
<P>
Later, her views slowly changed. She accepted the Orthodox rules that prohibit 
Jews from working, using the telephone or riding in a vehicle on the Sabbath, 
which runs from shortly before sundown Friday until shortly after sundown on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
She learned to keep kosher (to meet the dietary laws). 
</P>
<P>
"After many years of struggle," she said, "I no longer wanted to eat non-kosher 
food and I experienced a connection to God that being kosher helped me 
maintain. I have never felt anything like that before. It followed shortly 
after I had started to completely keep the Sabbath." 
</P>
<P>
But for an artist like Margolis -- who writes for magazines, teaches at USC and 
whose works have been exhibited in the Long Beach Museum, the Otis Parsons 
Gallery and the now-defunct Los Angeles Institute of Contemporary Art -- 
meeting the demands of her faith has posed professional problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I observe the Sabbath and am not able to go to functions, such as openings, 
which occur then," she said. "And if I go to functions, I cannot eat the 
(non-kosher) food. Or people may invite you to dinner, and you cannot eat in 
their homes." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Satisfactions 
</P>
<P>
Still, Margolis finds other satisfactions in Orthodoxy. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a tremendous amount of pressure to be an artist," she said. "There is 
no clear definition of success. Financial reward is undependable and you have 
only your own will to encourage you to keep doing it. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Her faith helps sustain and refresh her. For example, "by keeping the Sabbath, 
I take one day when I cannot be striving. . . . It's a day when I have to rest. 
It energizes me enormously." 
</P>
<P>
Her career and marriage also has been helped, she said, by Orthodox laws that 
put some limits on intimate contact between married couples and requires wives 
to participate in a ritual bath or mikvah. 
</P>
<P>
"I think an artist needs a certain psychic privacy to be creative," she said. 
"A marriage is sometimes destructive to that because there is so much 
togetherness and merging of personalities. Orthodox practice . . . allows a 
person to have time alone. I experience myself. And that turns out to be 
supportive of creative work." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Career Hasn't Suffered 
</P>
<P>
In the time she has maintained her faith, her peers have accepted it and her 
career has not suffered, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"One time an opening for my exhibit was scheduled on the Sabbath without my 
knowledge," she recalled. "The gallery director found out that I couldn't come 
and he changed the date and reprinted the invitations. The fact that my absence 
would have been to observe the Sabbath meant something to him. I was extremely 
touched." 
</P>
<P>
Her daughter and son, now 22 and 24, are Orthodox Jews. They live in her 
Pico-Robertson neighborhood, which is one of the areas in Los Angeles where 
many of the Orthodox reside. 
</P>
<P>
As for her parents, Margolis said her religion remains difficult for them. "My 
parents are OK, but are very inconvenienced by it and it makes them very cranky 
sometimes. They do not like that I do not answer the phone on the Sabbath. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they are in part a little proud and a little confused by it. The fact 
is, they are that way about my art and my life in the commune. . . . They do 
not quite know what to make of what I do, but it looks like other people like 
it, so it must be OK." 
</P>
<P>
Susan Weintraub, who eats non-kosher food outside her home and does not cover 
her hair in public, as most Orthodox rabbis recommend, conceded she still is 
learning how to conduct herself in Orthodox fashion. 
</P>
<P>
That's partly because the Westside resident only began to consider Orthodoxy 
three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
While working on a beach shoot, a photographer told her there were problems 
because a young, hip Jewish stylist she had hired to coordinate the models' 
outfits had said she could not work past sundown. 
</P>
<P>
"Why?" Weintraub asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Because she's observant," the photographer replied. 
</P>
<P>
"Observant of what?" Weintraub asked, adding she was "amazed" by the stylist's 
explanation and attended a class with her on Orthodox Judaism. She liked what 
she heard and has pursued her faith since. 
</P>
<P>
Each Tuesday, she leaves her office at lunch to take Hebrew lessons in a 
Fairfax-area home. On Wednesday nights, she attends an Orthodox women's study 
class. On Thursday afternoons, a rabbi bearing heavy books visits her office to 
instruct her in Jewish law. 
</P>
<P>
On Fridays, she leaves work by no later than 4:30 p.m. to reach a friend's 
house by the start of Sabbath, which she spends in the synagogue or with 
friends and her husband and 20-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Nonreligious Background 
</P>
<P>
Weintraub, who grew up in Tarzana and Sherman Oaks in a non-religious family, 
is learning to admire the discipline of Orthodoxy and its rules for men and 
women. 
</P>
<P>
"If you look at face value at what men can do and what women can do, there is a 
lot of opportunity for both," she said. ". . . It seems that men and women and 
children are happier. Their lives are structured. There's more balance." 
</P>
<P>
Weintraub -- fashionably attired recently in an oversized black jacket, 
two-piece black knit outfit, silver bracelets and black metal earrings -- knows 
that Orthodox Jewry requires women to dress modestly and forbids them to swim 
with men. 
</P>
<P>
But she sees no conflict between those rules and her job directing advertising 
for the sometimes revealing products of Catalina Swimwear. 
</P>
<P>
"My work is something I'm proud of," said the agency account supervisor in her 
spacious seventh-floor Hollywood office, which has a panoramic window 
overlooking Mann's Chinese Theater and the Hollywood Hills. "It feels good to 
have the opportunity to be creative. 
</P>
<P>
"Modesty can also be translated as dignity. . . . It's how you conduct yourself 
in business and with family and friends." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Logic of Rules 
</P>
<P>
She said she does not mind gender-based Orthodox rules, like one that in the 
synagogue separates the sexes with a wall. "My husband is very cute," she said. 
"If he were next to me, I'd be playing with his hair or something. I would be 
more involved with him than I should be for that period, which is supposed to 
be devoted to communing with the Almighty. I'm an intelligent woman. I can buy 
that." 
</P>
<P>
She also sees a logic in the Sabbath: "When you know every week that Friday and 
Saturday is family day and that there is an order to it and a reason for it, 
the concept elevates your quality of living. . . . You spend time with family 
and friends talking about the Torah (the sacred Scriptures) and about what's 
meaningful." 
</P>
<P>
Her brief exposure to Orthodoxy has altered her life, she noted. "I started 
meeting people who were interesting and my life started changing. I started 
grappling with questions like: What am I living for? What is my purpose in 
life? What do I want to be remembered for? What is success? . . . (Orthodoxy) 
doesn't feel like there are rules and restrictions and . . . like I'm being 
suffocated. It gives me pleasure." 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Schwartz Brooks, a Harvard-trained physician who has been a family 
practitioner at the Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in West Los Angeles for 
four years, has seen the limits of science and the need for her religion. 
</P>
<P>
"People have a symptom," she said, "and it goes away and I can't tell them why. 
And I did all my tests and everything right. I have more problems in medicine 
than I do in religion because in medicine I expect to explain everything." 
</P>
<P>
Not that everything about Orthodoxy pleases Brooks, an expectant 35-year-old 
mother, who already has two children, ages 9 and 4. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Independent Decision' 
</P>
<P>
Brooks -- who was raised in a moderately religious home but who made the 
"independent decision" in high school to adhere to Orthodox beliefs -- said she 
thinks "women should have much more of a role" in Judaism, starting in the 
earliest phases of their religious education. 
</P>
<P>
"Girls are not taught the same thing as boys in many religious schools -- 
that's the first prerequisite, because in Judaism, if you do not have 
knowledge, you cannot have input into decision making," she said. "The Jewish 
law has not had much female input, and it should have. 
</P>
<P>
"Women have also been written out of many aspects of public prayer," she added. 
"There are even areas where they are not allowed to be president of a synagogue 
or to take an administrative role within the religious community. That's 
ridiculous. The more you learn the sources, the more you learn what has been 
distorted and what could be changed." 
</P>
<P>
Though she hopes to change some of its laws, Schwartz Brooks, because she is a 
doctor, benefits professionally from exemptions to the strict rules on the 
Orthodox Sabbath. She can, for example, write, make rounds and use phones on 
Saturdays when those acts save lives. 
</P>
<P>
For Schwartz Brooks, whose husband is a USC mathematics professor, her religion 
is a vital, mystical part of her world, which gives "texture to my life. 
</P>
<P>
"I have ritual," she said. "I have a connection with a people, a connection 
with a history. I have a connection with a sense of the divine. I experience a 
sense of spirituality in my daily life. It's enveloping and it doesn't limit my 
personal development."

A SCIENTIST'S PAINFUL LESSON IN THE HUMAN DYNAMICS OF PRENATAL TESTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN PARACHINI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Until January of last year, Susan Hodge, a biomathemetician and geneticist at 
the UCLA School of Medicine, had been accustomed to teaching prospective 
doctors the fine points of prenatal genetic testing, she recalls, in 
academically detached fashion. 
</P>
<P>
That was before she attempted, at age 40, what was to be her third pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
She and her geneticist husband, David Greenberg, already had two lively 
daughters -- 7 and 10. Both had been healthy babies but it required no academic 
expertise for Hodge and Greenberg to realize this pregnancy was different. 
</P>
<P>
Hodge's age put her in the high-risk category for genetic defects. Prenatal 
evaluation -- the couple chose amniocentesis, performed in Hodge's 17th week -- 
was, as they perceived things, essential. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lesson in Human Dynamics 
</P>
<P>
But in the weeks between the time she first realized she was pregnant and when 
the test results were delivered, Hodge says today, she was to learn a great 
deal about the human dynamics of genetic testing. None of what she was to find 
out, she says, is included in the medical educations of most doctors. 
</P>
<P>
As she recalled recently, Hodge kept silent about her pregnancy except in the 
presence of her closest friends and family members. "I had just noticed that 
other friends or colleagues, when they (were going to) have amnio, didn't 
announce their (pregnancies) until the day or week they got the result." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, when Hodge reflected on her behavior to draft a letter -- largely 
written when she was still pregnant -- to the New England Journal of Medicine, 
she concluded: "The other, more disturbing phenomenon is how waiting has 
affected my attitude toward the pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
"At many levels, I deny that I really am pregnant 'until after we get the 
results.' I ignore the flutterings and kicks I feel; I talk of if, rather than 
when the baby comes." 
</P>
<P>
And once the amniocentesis was performed, Hodge said, she found the two weeks 
of waiting for the test results a time of uncontrollable, consuming anxiety and 
fear. 
</P>
<P>
"I (did not anticipate being nearly as anxiety-ridden) as I was. I think it was 
dealing with (the testing process) as a reality rather than (an abstract 
academic concept.)" 
</P>
<P>
She lay awake at night, afraid of what would happen if the test results 
indicated the fetus she was carrying had a serious defect. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess it was just the fear of getting a bad outcome and facing the 
termination of the pregnancy -- a pregnancy that I wanted," she said in a 
quiet, restrained voice over the telephone from New York City, where she and 
Greenberg relocated to new medical school teaching jobs a few months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Although Hodge kept the severity of her emotions at least somewhat to herself, 
"I was losing sleep. I was somewhat distracted." When she did sleep, she wrote 
in her medical journal 
</P>
<P>
letter, her dreams were preoccupied by the need for a second trimester 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Greenberg was aware of his wife's anxiety ("She . . . wasn't getting enough 
sleep and was clearly anxious.") but said he did not share it. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he says today, the possibility the pregnancy could go awry "did not 
enter my consciousness." 
</P>
<P>
"I knew intellectually what the chances were, but I did not accept emotionally 
that it could happen." 
</P>
<P>
As it would turn out, the odds went against the couple. The amniocentesis 
results were among what they considered the worst imaginable. Susan Hodge's 
baby was affected by Down's syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Typical of a Number of Women 
</P>
<P>
According to genetics experts and counselors questioned by The Times -- 
including the counselor whose duties included delivering the bad news to Susan 
Hodge -- Hodge is typical of a growing number of women choosing pregnancy in 
their late 30s or 40s. For such women, Hodge and genetics experts say, the 
perceived need for genetic testing comes to control the entire pregnancy 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
Among the observations: 
</P>
<P>
* The one-, two- or three-week wait for results of amniocentesis or even the 
two-day to one-week wait for results of chorionic villus sampling, a newer and 
slightly different test, can often become a period of intense anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
* Because of pervasive fear that test results will be unfavorable, many women 
-- just as Hodge did -- deliberately restrict the number of people who know of 
their pregnancies to their closest family members and friends. Somehow, they 
reason, if the pregnancy then must be terminated, they will not have to endure 
the emotionally draining experience of explaining the situation to an endless 
variety of acquaintances. In a sense, the pregnancy has less reality if fewer 
people know. 
</P>
<P>
* Until favorable prenatal test results are available that have the effect of 
validating the pregnancy, many women and their spouses refrain from such 
behavior as buying maternity clothing or baby goods and avoid talk that focuses 
on the fetus' behavior. 
</P>
<P>
When she finally decided to go public with her experience -- by writing the 
letter, which was published last month -- Hodge conceded that she had 
effectively suppressed most behavior commonly lumped under the heading of 
</P>
<P>
bonding. But the experience, she and Greenberg say now, became a valuable 
lesson that such denial is actually shortsighted and counterproductive. They 
may make it more -- rather than less -- difficult to cope with a calamitous 
genetic testing result, if it comes. 
</P>
<P>
Chances of a bad result are low. According to Dr. Connie Sandlin, medical 
director of the genetics center at Memorial Medical Center of Long Beach, 
amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (commonly known as CVS), return 
favorable findings 95% to 99% of the time. 
</P>
<P>
"I am lucky," said Ann Garber, a genetics testing expert at Cedars-Sinai 
Medical Center, "that 95% of the time in my job, I'm able to give couples 
information that thrills and delights them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tension Unavoidable 
</P>
<P>
But for women waiting for their amniocentesis or CVS results, the reality of 
such odds often means very little, Hodge, Greenberg and genetics experts 
agreed. The tension is unavoidable. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in my office talking to a student when the phone rang," Hodge recalled. 
"It was the genetics counselor. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Hold on just a minute,' and asked the student to leave. And I thought 
to myself, 'Good, the waiting is over.' The next words out of his mouth were, 
'I'm sorry, I have bad news.' 
</P>
<P>
"I was simply stunned. I started to ask him (something else) and then I 
realized I wasn't hearing what he was saying." 
</P>
<P>
With a few more formalities, Hodge hung up and dialed her husband. Greenberg 
was writing a difficult research study report and, when the phone rang and he 
heard his wife's voice, he thought she was calling with advice on the wording 
of an especially difficult passage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Our Baby Is Down's' 
</P>
<P>
"I picked up the phone and (all) she said (was), 'It's Down's,' " Greenberg 
recalled. "She said it in a way that made it sound like the answer to a 
question. I said, 'What?' And she said, 'Our baby is Down's,' and I didn't say 
anything for a long time as I tried to absorb this. (At some point), I said, 
'Oh.' " 
</P>
<P>
Within a few days, the couple arranged for a second-trimester abortion -- the 
solution chosen, genetics counselors said, by 90% or more of those in that 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
Because CVS can be performed earlier in a pregnancy than amniocentesis, 
abortions it precedes usually occur in the first trimester. First-trimester 
abortions are clinically safer and easier to perform than those in the second 
trimester, and they tend to entail less psychological trauma, genetics 
counselors agree. 
</P>
<P>
As their lives regained order, Hodge and Greenberg came to realize that the 
denials and emotional tricks they employed to deny the reality of the pregnancy 
until the amniocentesis validated it had been mistaken. And in this reaction 
the couple have a valuable lesson for others, said Stephen Keiles, the Kaiser 
Foundation Hospital genetics counselor to whom the responsibility to notify 
Hodge fell. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Avoid Dealing With It 
</P>
<P>
"In my experience, the majority of women voice some concerns regarding the 
results (of genetic testing), and I've noticed that a lot of people will not 
want to address certain questions until the results come back," Keiles said. 
"They (couples) say, 'We'll deal with that if we have to.' " 
</P>
<P>
But at the same time, Keiles said, many such couples behave in the fashion of 
Hodge and Greenberg. "One of the most common things I've noticed is people not 
telling others that they are pregnant. I think that is a common theme. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't advise them who they should tell and who they shouldn't, but I . . . 
try to point out that, if the results do indicate a problem, denying the fact 
that there was a pregnancy is not going to make it any easier to deal with. I 
say, 'No matter what you think now, if the results show there is a problem, you 
will be just as upset if you don't tell people as if you do.' " 
</P>
<P>
This is advice that Hodge and Greenberg suggest couples should listen to. All 
of it, she said, has changed her thinking fundamentally. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Enjoy the Pregnancy' 
</P>
<P>
"I would suggest to women who are having prenatal diagnosis that they not try 
to keep the pregnancy a secret," she said, "any longer than they would if they 
were not having prenatal diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
"Internally, I would suggest that they try to go ahead and enjoy the pregnancy, 
accept it, get excited about it, buy maternity clothes and all the things that 
one does. We thought (that by handling it as we did), we would save ourselves 
pain if we did get a bad outcome. But I felt we had not saved ourselves any 
pain and all we had done was deprived ourselves of the joy." 
</P>
<P>
Greenberg's feelings are identical. "I think it was a mistake for us not to 
admit the pregnancy, not to accept it between ourselves and to keep it 
tentative, as though one could put off the emotional attachment until one was 
certain," he said. "That was just wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone agrees. Maritchou Jannsen, who heads a group called Support for 
Prenatal Decisions, based in San Bernardino, asserted that it is not possible 
to establish hard and fast rules. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Sue (Hodge) was trying to speak philosophically when she says that, 
another time, they would go right ahead and tell everyone," Jannsen said. "Not 
everybody can deal with outsiders' reactions quite as easily." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Experience Is Common 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach Memorial's Sandlin said the experience of Hodge and Greenberg is 
common. "I think women often aren't even aware that they are reacting in this 
fashion," Sandlin said. And she said that, in the average busy obstetrician's 
office, such subtleties may be easily overlooked by a physician intent on 
monitoring and maintaining the strictly physical health of his patient. 
</P>
<P>
Research studies have shown that both amniocentesis and CVS produce anxiety 
reactions in women undergoing the procedures. But, since the waiting time for 
CVS is shorter and it can be done earlier, the studies found the anxiety for 
CVS to be less than for amniocentesis. But both studies also noted that CVS 
carries a higher risk of spontaneous abortion. And in some patients, other 
experts said, CVS results may not be as reliable as those from amniocentesis. 
</P>
<P>
Cedars-Sinai's Garber said that, strictly on the narrow issue of emotional 
effects, she prefers CVS, especially since its timing permits the abortion 
decision to be made before a woman's pregnancy starts to become noticeable to 
others. 
</P>
<P>
"The matter can be kept more private," she said. "If you elect to terminate, it 
is not as obvious to your friends and colleagues." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Choices Are Complex 
</P>
<P>
But Garber and other experts agreed that the choice between CVS and 
amniocentesis is a complex one, based on many factors that can sometimes 
conflict. Generally, these experts agreed, neither procedure can be called 
better than the other. 
</P>
<P>
For Susan Hodge, it took two months to overcome the emotional impact brought 
about by the outcome of her pregnancy and what she now recognizes as her own 
incorrect decisions during its course. 
</P>
<P>
She realized the emotional ordeal was over at a certain, quite specific moment. 
"I was able to laugh very hard at something my daughter said," she recalled, 
"and then I started crying."

BENEFITS OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH: THE AWARENESS AND THE WARINESS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Genethics: The Clash Between the New Genetics and Human Values by David Suzuki 
and Peter Knudtson (Harvard University Press: $25; 384 pages) 
</P>
<P>
The theme is an old one. Science for good and science for evil. It recurs in 
literature, in thought and in reality. Unfortunately, there is no solution, 
only a warning: Be aware and beware. 
</P>
<P>
Until this century, science for evil, while recognized, seemed an aberration. 
Since World War II, we have known that it is more than that. The destructive 
power of knowledge is at least as great as its positive applications. The two 
are inseparably linked. 
</P>
<P>
Microbiology is the latest discipline to discover that science is a two-edged 
sword. The explosion of knowledge in the last several decades into the chemical 
basis of life has opened vast possibilities for use and for abuse. What to do 
about it is the subject of "Genethics: The Clash Between the New Genetics and 
Human Values" by David Suzuki and Peter Knudtson, a book that offers more 
questions than answers. 
</P>
<P>
Biotechnology has been a controversial subject since the early 1970s, when the 
techniques of genetic engineering were first developed. Mindful of the dilemma 
that the atomic scientists of World War II had created, biologists feared 
unleashing a new uncontrollable weapon on the world. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, they were concerned that a genetically engineered organism could 
escape from a laboratory and wreak havoc, and, for the first time in the 
history of science, they voluntarily adopted a moratorium on research until the 
potential for such a catastrophe could be assessed. 
</P>
<P>
Having assured themselves -- and many of the rest of us -- that the possibility 
was remote, they resumed and expanded their work. Now the question is a 
different and much more fundamental one: Regardless of the potential benefits, 
is it wise to tinker with the essence of life? 
</P>
<P>
"As we embark on this new era of applied molecular genetics, we are in some 
ways incredibly shortsighted," Suzuki and Knudtson warn. "We are so intent on 
rushing to exploit our newly acquired insights that we often do not have the 
faintest idea of the long-term consequences of our technologies." 
</P>
<P>
Genetic research makes possible the creation of new forms of life. The authors 
concede the potential benefits of manufacturing new medicines and repairing 
genetic defects. But they fear that "repairing genetic defects" sounds a lot 
like "improving the race," a slogan that has already been used and could still 
be used for great harm. 
</P>
<P>
And, in an echo of the earlier concern about the escape of pathological new 
organisms, the authors fear that some unknown, unforeseen consequence is still 
lurking in genetic engineering. 
</P>
<P>
"When science creates new technological tools, they often yield instant social 
and financial rewards," they write. "But these successes can blind us to the 
fact that science seldom has much to say about the possible future effects of 
these applications on our societies and ecosystems. We need look no farther 
than the long-term effects of the automobile, nuclear fission, oral 
contraceptives, agricultural pesticides or television to appreciate the myopia 
of science. The effects of each of these applications of science extend far 
beyond the immediate uses for which they were intended." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Answers in Morality 
</P>
<P>
Go slow, the authors urge. We don't know what we're doing. The answers to these 
questions lie in morality, not in science, in wisdom, not in knowledge. They 
call for new ethical principles, which, the authors say, should be drawn from 
as many and wide-ranging sources as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Who can quarrel with such a noble sentiment? On the other hand, is it moral to 
refuse to cure a genetic defect today because of the fear that the knowledge 
will be misused tomorrow? 
</P>
<P>
No one has yet figured out a solution to this problem, and no one is likely to. 
In some sense, it is the problem of modern society. We want -- we need -- the 
benefits of science. We cannot feed ourselves without every technological trick 
at hand. There are too many people on the planet. 
</P>
<P>
By definition, no one knows what the unforeseen problems of knowledge will be 
in the long run. But we cannot give up the short-term benefits. We cannot let 
go of the tiger's tail. 
</P>
<P>
Suzuki, a scientist, and Knudtson, a science writer, are right to point out the 
hazards and to urge and reurge that we treat knowledge of the chemistry of life 
with awe. But can we really turn our backs on this technology? Should we? 
</P>
<P>
Should the printing press have been banned at the outset because one day Hitler 
would publish "Mein Kampf"?

BUSH S&amp;L BAILOUT PLAN WOULD COST $90 BILLION; 
</P>
<P>
LAWMAKERS EXPRESS CAUTIOUS APPROVAL

<P>
Members of Congress, while expressing cautious approval for President Bush's 
plan to bail out the nation's savings and loan industry, indicated concern 
Monday that it may put too great a burden on taxpayers and predicted that it 
will not emerge from Congress untouched. 
</P>
<P>
Congress "is very likely to make changes in this before it's finally approved," 
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) said. 
</P>
<P>
The likely impact of industry lobbying remains difficult to gauge. S&amp;L 
executives voiced concerns that higher deposit insurance premiums could 
decimate their institutions, but Barry Beeksma, chairman of the U.S. League of 
Savings Institutions, said that his group is "neither endorsing nor rejecting" 
the Bush plan. 
</P>
<P>
Banking leaders, although unhappy that they too would have to pay more for 
deposit insurance, expressed satisfaction that S&amp;L fees would remain higher 
than theirs. And they were pleased that their premiums would be used not 
directly to bail out the S&amp;Ls but rather to beef up their own deposit 
insurance fund. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers focused on a proposal that would require an estimated $3 billion to 
$5 billion annually from general revenues to help pay the interest on $50 
billion in government bonds that would be used to pay off depositors at 
hundreds of insolvent S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plan Called Reasonable 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a reasonable plan, and I'm pleased the President has taken this 
initiative," Dole said. But he frowned on the cost to taxpayers of $3 billion 
to $5 billion a year, "especially if we're going to be crowding out some 
programs like education, where we want to put more money in." 
</P>
<P>
The Democratic chairmen of the Senate and House banking committees, vowing to 
tackle the S&amp;L issue in a bipartisan spirit, expressed measured support for 
Bush's proposal. Their endorsement will be crucial if the plan, or something 
like it, is to be enacted. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is by and large a sensible proposal . . . that gives us good 
signs of bipartisan cooperation," said Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan, 
chairman of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fears Cuts in Other Areas 
</P>
<P>
"But there are still some questions on how this will be funded. . . . Will 
there be pressure to take it out of health care, Medicare, or the war on drugs? 
I hope not." 
</P>
<P>
In the House, Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.), chairman of the Banking, Finance 
and Urban Affairs Committee, complimented Bush for preparing a bailout plan so 
quickly after his inauguration. He voiced the hope that Congress will be able 
to reach a quick solution to the problem. 
</P>
<P>
However, Gonzalez expressed some doubts. He warned, for example, that the costs 
of increased insurance premiums for S&amp;Ls "will be passed on to the small 
depositor in the form of higher fees unless the Congress mandates otherwise. . 
. . The deposit premium increases, in reality, will hit the small depositor 
even harder and leave the affluent untouched." Other committee members 
predicted that the plan might wind up undermining the S&amp;L industry's 
ability to provide home mortgages at reasonable rates. Rep. Frank Annunzio 
(D-Ill.) said that Bush's plan to place the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which 
regulates S&amp;Ls, under control of the Treasury Department could have a 
"devastating impact" on the ability of Americans to obtain home loans. 
</P>
<P>
"It will only be a matter of time before the Treasury Department eliminates 
entirely the savings and loans industry and, with it, its role as the nation's 
home lender," he said. "When that happens, mortgage rates will skyrocket." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.), who sits on the Senate Banking Committee, noted that 
the proposal is bound to be unpopular, given the magnitude of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody is going to go out and embrace and kiss on the mouth a plan that tries 
to fill a $50-billion hole," he said. "But I think something very close to this 
plan is going to be adopted. . . . I think we'll see real bipartisanship here." 
</P>
<P>
S&amp;L and bank lobbyists did not rush to embrace the proposal. Beeksma, 
representing S&amp;Ls, said: "There are components of the President's proposals 
that would be burdensome to our industry if adopted." 
</P>
<P>
Beeksma said that his organization will lobby hard against permanently charging 
S&amp;Ls more than banks for their deposit insurance. He expressed support for 
Bush's proposal to crack down on "that small element of lawbreakers" who have 
stolen or squandered huge amounts of money from S&amp;Ls in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Bank representatives noted approvingly that Bush's plan would not call on their 
institutions to assist ailing S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
The burden of financing the proposal "will fall largely on the savings and 
loans themselves, where it belongs," said C. G. Holthus, president-elect of the 
American Bankers Assn. "We are encouraged that apparently banks and their 
customers will not be asked to bail out the S&amp;Ls." 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Guenther, executive vice president of the Independent Bankers Assn., 
also expressed satisfaction that Bush's plan "inflicted more fees on the 
sinners than on the saints."

<P>
THRIFTS, TAXPAYERS, BANKS TO BEAR BURDEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush, revealing his $90-billion plan for rescuing depositors at 
failed savings and loan associations, proposed Monday that banks and healthy 
S&amp;Ls should pay more for federal insurance and that taxpayers should 
contribute about $3.5 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
Bush rejected a direct fee on depositors' checking and savings accounts, 
although he conceded that banks and S&amp;Ls might pass on some of their new 
costs to their customers. 
</P>
<P>
"We intend to restore our deposit insurance system to complete health," Bush 
told a news conference at which he announced a plan to issue $50 billion in new 
bonds to shut down crippled S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Future Security Assured 
</P>
<P>
"Your government has stood behind the safety of insured deposits before, it 
does today, and it will do so at all times in the future," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that federal regulators immediately will begin seizing all 350 
insolvent S&amp;Ls so that their future losses can be held to a minimum. Before 
ultimately selling or liquidating them, the federal regulators will manage the 
S&amp;Ls with full powers over investments and interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Both S&amp;L and bank deposits up to $100,000 are guaranteed by federal 
insurance. The S&amp;L insurance fund lacks the cash to shut down insolvent 
thrift institutions and pay off the depositors, however. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration plan, which requires approval from the 
Democratic-controlled Congress, would raise the insurance premiums paid by 
financial institutions as part of a complex plan to dispose of the 350 
insolvent S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
The taxpayer contribution, estimated at approximately $3.5 billion a year over 
the first five years, would be primarily limited to paying part of the interest 
on the bonds. The taxpayer contribution over the first 10 years, starting with 
1989, would be $40 billion, but that figure could rise if the economy does not 
behave as well as the Administration predicts. 
</P>
<P>
S&amp;Ls, which now pay a federal insurance premium of $2.08 for every $1,000 
in deposits, would pay $2.30 starting in 1991. The fee would drop to $1.80 per 
$1,000 in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
The bank premium, 83 cents per $1,000, would climb to $1.20 in 1990 and $1.50 
in 1991 and subsequent years. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no guarantee of passing this on to the consumer, nor is there a 
guarantee it won't be passed on," the President said. "Nothing is without pain 
when you come to solve a problem of this magnitude." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fears for Small Depositors 
</P>
<P>
However, House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee Chairman Henry B. 
Gonzalez (D-Tex.) said that Congress should protect small depositors from 
facing additonal expenses because of the higher premiums. Gonzalez said he 
fears that "the little consumer will pay in the form of higher fees on checking 
accounts, bigger charges for returned checks, new fees for automatic tellers 
and a myriad of other charges." 
</P>
<P>
For the Administration and many members of Congress, higher insurance premiums 
on banks and S&amp;Ls are much more politically acceptable than an earlier 
proposal under consideration for a direct fee on depositors of 25 or 30 cents a 
year for every $100 in deposits. 
</P>
<P>
"I will not support any new fee on depositors," Bush said, effectively killing 
an idea first proposed by his own Treasury Department. 
</P>
<P>
The President called also for tough new regulatory and safety standards for the 
S&amp;L industry. 
</P>
<P>
"We will see to it that the system is reformed comprehensively so that this 
situation is not repeated ever again," Bush declared. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Would Shift Regulators 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, Bush proposed that regulatory control of S&amp;Ls be shifted from 
the Federal Home Loan Bank Board to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which 
already runs the bank insurance system. The Bank Board, which would still 
charter savings institutions, would lose its independent status and become a 
unit of the Treasury Department. 
</P>
<P>
The FDIC would operate like a family with two checking accounts, one for the 
bank insurance fund and one for S&amp;Ls, with no mingling of the money. The 
Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. would continue to manage the deposit 
insurance funds for S&amp;Ls under the FDIC's direction. 
</P>
<P>
The additional bank premiums would be used only to beef up the banks' deposit 
insurance fund, not to shut down any S&amp;Ls. However, the additional 
contributions from the banks would count as revenue for federal budget purposes 
and thereby would reduce the overall budgetary impact. 
</P>
<P>
Under its new supervisor, S&amp;Ls by 1991 would have to double their capital 
-- their net worth -- from the 3% of assets required now to the 6% that will be 
required of banks. Many of the weaker S&amp;Ls, unable to raise the cash to 
meet the higher standards required by 1991, may be forced to merge or go out of 
business. 
</P>
<P>
During a period of budget stringency, members of Congress would prefer to spend 
funds on education and social programs rather than on paying to clean up the 
S&amp;L debacle. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee Chairman Donald W. Riegle 
Jr. (D-Mich.), although predicting bipartisan cooperation, warned that there 
would be pressure to make corresponding cuts from such popular programs as 
Medicare and the war on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Be Unacceptable 
</P>
<P>
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) said that the taxpayer burden of the 
Bush plan might be politically unacceptable, "especially if we're going to be 
crowding out some programs like education." 
</P>
<P>
Federal regulators already have committed $40 billion to dispose of more than 
200 insolvent thrift institutions. This money will come from insurance fees 
paid by S&amp;Ls and from cash gained from the sale of assets in failed 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration calculates that another $50 billion should take care of 
the rest of the problem, although some experts say that the total cost will 
prove to be even greater. 
</P>
<P>
The other $50 billion in the Bush plan would come from a new Resolution Funding 
Corp., which would issue $50 billion in 30-year bonds. The interest would be 
paid by a combination of taxpayer and thrift industry contributions, and the 
principal would be repaid entirely with industry funds. 
</P>
<P>
The $50 billion would go to a new Resolution Trust Corp., which would handle 
the liquidation or sale of insolvent S&amp;Ls during the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's decision to seize insolvent S&amp;Ls immediately was recommended last 
week by Congress' General Accounting Office. Comptroller General Charles A. 
Bowsher, the GAO's director, said that the crippled institutions were hurting 
the rest of the industry by offering unusually high interest rates to attract 
deposits. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan announced Monday, federal regulators will "assume supervisory 
control of insolvent S&amp;Ls," according to a White House fact sheet. The 
regulators -- the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. and the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corp. -- could close branches, dispose of investments and 
bring interest rates back down to market levels. 
</P>
<P>
These immediate steps are being taken as an administrative action by federal 
regulators and do not require congressional approval. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prosecutions Pledged 
</P>
<P>
Citing "unconscionable risk-taking, fraud and outright criminality" as factors 
contributing to the wave of S&amp;L failures and the collapse of the insurance 
fund, Bush proposed also a $50-million increase in Justice Department spending 
to prosecute crooked S&amp;L managers. 
</P>
<P>
"I make to you a solemn pledge that we will make every effort to recover assets 
diverted from these institutions and to place behind bars those who have caused 
losses through criminal behavior," Bush said.

"Let those who would take advantage of the public trust and put at risk the

Here are the key points in President Bush's plan to rescue the savings and loan

<P>
Taxpayers would pay $40 billion over 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Government would issue $50 billion in bonds to finance the cost of failed 
institutions, with $40 billion committed by regulators.

<P>
A newly created Resolution Trust Corp. would isolate insolvent thrifts and 
resolve their affairs within five years.

<P>
 S&amp;Ls would be required to meet the same capital requirements as commercial 
banks by June, 1991 -- doubling to 6% of assets.

FESTIVE SOVIET CEREMONY MARKS AFGHAN WITHDRAWAL 
</P>

TERMEZ, Soviet Union 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Soviet Union marked its military withdrawal from Afghanistan on Monday with 
a festive if premature ceremony characterized more by a sense of relief than of 
triumph or satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
A battalion of 300 paratroopers who had left their base near Kabul three days 
earlier rolled onto Soviet territory on the north bank of the Amu Darya River 
at 11:37 a.m. local time, marking the beginning of the withdrawal's final 
phase. 
</P>
<P>
As they crossed the Friendship Bridge linking the two countries here in Termez, 
they passed a billboard bearing the message, "The Soviet Armed Forces Are a 
School of Hardening and Courage." 
</P>
<P>
But for all the talk of the army having fulfilled its "internationalist duty" 
in nine years of propping up the revolution in Afghanistan, the highest-ranking 
official on hand for Monday's ceremonies was a deputy premier from the Soviet 
republic of Uzbekistan -- the rough equivalent of a lieutenant governor in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
"If we'd had glasnost in 1979, we'd never have gone in," one army veteran said, 
referring to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of openness. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev has referred to the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan, which began 
in December, 1979, as one of the sins of the past that the leadership is now 
trying to expunge. Many among the men coming home would agree with him. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem was that nobody supported us," an officer said, speaking on 
condition of anonymity. "If the (Afghan) people had supported us, we could have 
won." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets are withdrawing under the terms of the April, 1988, Geneva 
agreement between Afghanistan and Pakistan. The United States and the Soviet 
Union are acting as official guarantors of the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow pledged to remove all its forces from Afghanistan by Feb. 15, and 50,000 
were pulled out last summer under the first phase of the agreement. An army 
spokesman said Monday that 30,000 have been withdrawn in recent weeks, 
apparently leaving only about 20,000 still south of the border. 
</P>
<P>
The army spokesman said Soviet troops are still present in only five of 
Afghanistan's 26 provinces, mostly in the northern part of the country. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow does not count an unspecified number of advisers reportedly being left 
behind to help the pro-Soviet government in Kabul fight off the rebel 
moujahedeen, who are supported by the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Washington and Moscow continue to supply weapons to the opposing sides in the 
Afghan conflict. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 200 Soviet and foreign correspondents were permitted to come to this 
normally closed border town to observe Monday's ceremony. Officials along the 
way have gone to considerable length to discourage any comparison between the 
withdrawal from Afghanistan and the American withdrawal from Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely no analogy exists between Vietnam and Afghanistan," Uzbek Foreign 
Minister Sattar A. Azimov said at a press conference in the republic's capital 
of Tashkent. 
</P>
<P>
Maj. Gen. Valery P. Stripnin, deputy chief of the political department of the 
Soviet Central Asian command, said: "Soviet troops are getting out of 
Afghanistan not because they suffered a defeat but because of a new situation 
and new approaches to the problem of (Afghan) national unity." 
</P>
<P>
The army concedes that the war has cost at least 13,000 Soviet lives. More than 
35,000 other Soviet soldiers were wounded, and 311 are missing in action. 
</P>
<P>
The war became increasingly unpopular at home and cost the Kremlin dearly in 
terms of foreign relations. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Lt. Alexander Smirnov said, "Afghans will sort out their own problems." 
Smirnov carried an Afghan flag in Monday's ceremony as a mark of continuing 
Soviet friendship for the country, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We just hope that what we did will not be wasted," said Pvt. Georgi Bulat, 20. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Emphasis on the Present 
</P>
<P>
About 3,000 dignitaries, townspeople and relatives were on hand to greet the 
returning troops, and they seemed to be more eager to enjoy the present than to 
reflect on the past or ponder the future. 
</P>
<P>
On one side of the parade ground were stands selling such normally "deficit" 
consumer goods as toothpaste, bars of hand soap and nylon stockings. 
</P>
<P>
Early birds lunched on freshly grilled shish kebab, chicken and fish. A local 
bakery supplied cakes decorated with multicolored frosting. 
</P>
<P>
The paratroop battalion, commanded by Lt. Col. Alexander Skachkov, 39, an 
18-year veteran from Smolensk, took five minutes to cross the Friendship Bridge 
in a fast-moving convoy of 64 vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
The troopers, mostly draftees 19 or 20 years old and from virtually every part 
of the country, waved and smiled as their flag-bedecked vehicles rolled past 
Soviet and Western television cameras. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the vehicles had the name of the driver's hometown scrawled on them, 
and many were draped with red-and-white propaganda banners. One announced that 
"We Fulfilled the Order of the Motherland." 
</P>
<P>
The vehicles were parked in four columns on a huge parade ground, and the men 
dismounted to form up in review. 
</P>
<P>
"The battalion, having performed its internationalist duty, has come home," Lt. 
Col. Skachkov reported to the assembled crowd. Then he congratulated his troops 
for their service. 
</P>
<P>
Two 19-year-old Uzbek women from Termez, dressed in native costume, gave 
Skachkov the traditional welcome of bread and salt, and schoolgirls presented 
him with flowers. 
</P>
<P>
A military band played the national anthem, and Deputy Uzbek Premier Valery V. 
Sudarenkov told the troops that they had passed their test with flying colors. 
He said they deserved the gratitude of the Afghan and Soviet people. 
</P>
<P>
They had returned, he said, to a country in the midst of profound change, and 
he added, "We want you to join the front ranks of the fighters for the 
revolutionary transformation of our society." 
</P>
<P>
As the official welcoming ceremony wound down, people from the crowd were 
permitted onto the parade ground. They gave the soldiers flowers, balloons, 
bread and sweets. 
</P>
<P>
Several soldiers put the flowers in the muzzles of their rifles or the big guns 
mounted on their vehicles. Then they roared off in a dusty farewell. 
</P>
<P>
For Pvt. Normund Skutelis, a Latvian, it was one more step toward getting back 
to civilian life. He wants to be a farmer. 
</P>
<P>
"Politics is a slippery thing," he said. "But the land will always stand by 
you."

BARBARA TUCHMAN DIES; AWARD-WINNING HISTORIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Historian Barbara Tuchman, who for nearly 50 years wrote steadfastly of her 
belief that the world is the creation of men and women "invested with power to 
affect their destiny," died Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning author of a dozen books, most recent among 
them "The First Salute," a current best-seller, died of complications following 
a stroke. 
</P>
<P>
She was 77 and had lived for years in Cos Cob, Conn. She was taken from there 
to a Greenwich Hospital, where she died. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Mrs. Tuchman, who became one of the most popular historians of her 
time, was not trained in history. 
</P>
<P>
"It's what saved me," the 1933 Radcliffe College graduate once admitted in an 
interview. "I think if I had taken a doctoral degree, it would have stifled any 
writing capacity." 
</P>
<P>
Since her first book in 1938, her narrative accounts of history were praised 
for their literary merit. She answered that she loved to "do" history, rather 
than merely write about it. 
</P>
<P>
For "The Guns of August" in 1962, she walked the battlefields of World War I; 
for "A Distant Mirror: The Calamitous Fourteenth Century" in 1978, she trod the 
same path as the Crusaders of that distant time and traced their tumult by 
following the career of a feudal lord, Enguerrand de Coucy VII. 
</P>
<P>
She won the Pulitzer Prize for history for "The Guns of August" and for 
"Stilwell and the American Experience in China" in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
She was always more popular with her public than with academicians, many of 
whom disdained her lack of credentials. But as the London Times Literary 
Supplement once reported, "Tuchman may not be a historian's historian, but she 
is a pleasure for the layman to read." 
</P>
<P>
It was one of many accolades the privileged daughter of Maurice and Alma 
Wertheim struggled hard to achieve. 
</P>
<P>
She was born to a family of diplomats and bankers: Her grandfather had been 
U.S. ambassador to Turkey and Mexico under President Woodrow Wilson and an 
uncle was secretary of the Treasury under President Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 
times of limited opportunities for women, she had come to look on herself as 
"just a Park Avenue matron." 
</P>
<P>
Out of school, she became an editorial assistant for the Nation magazine and 
American correspondent for the London-based New Statesman. Then in 1940, she 
married Dr. Lester R. Tuchman. 
</P>
<P>
With the children that followed, she told Newsweek magazine a few years ago, it 
became difficult to achieve a long-dreamed ambition: to begin creating word 
pictures of the paths of history. 
</P>
<P>
She was, she stated without complaint, the wife of a physician and "had three 
small children and no status whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
But she gradually carved out the time and had written "The Lost British Policy: 
Britain and Spain Since 1700" (1938) and "Bible and Sword: England and 
Palestine from the Bronze Age to Balfour" (1956) before coming up with a 
captivating account of intrigue that became her first best-seller. 
</P>
<P>
It was "The Zimmermann Telegram," published in 1958, in which she traced the 
World War I German telegram to Mexico that promised the Mexicans part of the 
American Southwest if Mexico would enter the war on Germany's side. The 
discovery of the document was credited with helping bring the United States 
into the war in 1917. 
</P>
<P>
"The Guns of August" was an even bigger best-seller. Although it focused on the 
tactical and logistical aspects of World War I, it was widely praised for 
illuminating aspects of the conflict as would a storyteller by a campfire. 
</P>
<P>
In "The Proud Tower: A Portrait of the World Before the War, 1890-1914," 
published in 1966, she examined society at the end of the last century and the 
beginning of this one. The years before World War I, she wrote, "lie like a 
band of scorched earth dividing that time from ours." 
</P>
<P>
Her second Pulitzer came for "Stilwell and and the American Experience in 
China." It traced the career of Joseph Stilwell, the feisty commander of U.S. 
troops in China, Burma and India before and during World War II, who watched as 
China moved from a feudal republic to communism. 
</P>
<P>
In 1979, she became the first woman elected to the Jefferson lectureship of the 
National Endowment for the Humanities. A year earlier, she had won the gold 
medal for history from the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
She also lectured in such disparate spots as Harvard University and the Naval 
War College, but she continued to write. For her next work, she retreated six 
centuries from wartime China for "A Distant Mirror." 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, she put out what might be described as a Tuchman primer -- a volume of 
her selected essays called "Practicing History." It explored her views of how 
history should be written while also promulgating thoughts on subjects as 
diverse as Watergate and Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, nearly all of recorded history became her palette in "The March of 
Folly: From Troy to Vietnam." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Times book critic Richard Eder called it a collection of 
"historical folly: a kind of prideful, or as she puts it, 'wooden-headed' error 
committed by powerful societies, despite the presence of voices arguing against 
it and the existence of visible alternatives." 
</P>
<P>
Her subjects ranged from Britain's ill-fated struggle with its American 
Colonies to the Trojan War to the Renaissance Papacy to Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Tuchman's latest book, "The First Salute," a look at the American 
Revolution and the Dutch revolution that preceded it by 200 years, has been on 
the New York Times best-seller list for more than nine weeks. 
</P>
<P>
In one of her last public appearances, an interview at an October book signing, 
Mrs. Tuchman said she had not given any thought to her next book. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really need a new project now," Tuchman said. "I need a good, long 
rest, really." 
</P>
<P>
At her death, the woman who chose to ignore a doctoral degree while in school 
could count 22 honorary ones from a like number of institutions. 
</P>
<P>
The New Republic wrote once that "Tuchman's books provide (her readers) with 
examples that lift the level of their lives. Before the academic deluge, this 
was what history was supposed to do -- to teach philosophy by example -- and 
few writers have performed this office more inspiringly than Barbara Tuchman."

Boycott San Francisco? 
</P>
<P>
As political protests go, it seems a bit extreme even by California standards. 
Who would think up an act of such exquisite self-denial? 
</P>
<P>
Farmers. Furious about San Francisco's official decision two months ago to 
endorse a 4-year-old boycott of table grapes, farm groups across the country 
have decided to fight fire with fire. First, the American Farm Bureau announced 
it would take its 8,000 members and $18 million in convention business 
elsewhere. The Produce Marketing Assn. and the United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable 
Assn. quickly followed suit. 
</P>
<P>
"There is something about San Francisco that has always waved a red flag to 
farm folks around here," said a Fresno journalist recently. "San Francisco 
epitomizes the liberal, urban indifference to the farmer." 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco is one of at least a dozen major American cities, including Los 
Angeles, to endorse the table grape boycott, but so far it's the only one the 
farmers have targeted for retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
In San Francisco, officials disagree over the effect the counter-boycott is 
having. The mayor's office predicts that the lost revenue will amount to a 
small fraction of the city's overall convention proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
However, the city's Convention and Visitors Bureau reports that the farmers' 
action is on the way to costing San Francisco $60 million in lost convention 
business over the next several years -- equivalent to roughly 25% of a single 
year's convention spending by visitors. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Begley, executive director of the Hotel Council of San Francisco, said 
the boycott already has led to $29 million in cancellations over the next three 
years. He said many of the canceled bookings will be difficult to replace 
because they were scheduled during winter months when business is slower. 
</P>
<P>
Besides canceling conventions, farm groups up and down the San Joaquin Valley, 
where most of the state's fruit and vegetables are grown, have persuaded local 
officials in Fresno, Madera, Tulare and Kern counties to support the 
counter-boycott and, in some cases, to stop scheduling meetings in San 
Francisco and in Alameda County, where the grape boycott also has official 
support. Several city councils in the Central Valley have also endorsed the San 
Francisco boycott but stopped short of banning official meetings in the Bay 
Area. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos recently backed out of an appearance at a Fresno 
reception after local growers loudly proclaimed that he was not welcome. Agnos 
signed the San Francisco resolution endorsing the grape boycott, which was 
organized by the United Farm Workers union. The city's resolution also bans 
grapes from meals served in city commissaries. 
</P>
<P>
The counter-boycott signals a new militancy by farmers, who have been 
contending with periodic ostracism of their products by the UFW and its allies 
since the mid-1960s. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole idea of the San Francisco thing is to hit them where it hurts the 
most, in the city's pocketbook," said Fresno County Supervisor Deran Koligian, 
who is also a grape farmer. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just not going to lie down and take this crap any longer," said A. J. 
Yates, president of the Fresno County Farm Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
"The (grape) boycott is a hot-button issue around here, like abortion or gun 
control," said John Hicks, a Fresno political consultant. 
</P>
<P>
Up to now, the grape farmers' most conspicuous gesture of defiance was to 
arrange for a photograph of then-President Richard M. Nixon eating a handful of 
grapes. 
</P>
<P>
The latest grape boycott was launched in 1985 by UFW President Cesar Chavez to 
protest growers' use of five pesticides suspected of posing serious health 
risks. Unlike past boycotts, however, this one appears to have made little 
impact on the soaring sales of table grapes -- now a $1.3-billion retail 
business in the United States. The value of the California table grape crop has 
tripled during the last decade, according to the California Table Grape 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the UFW insist that their boycott has made a dent in grape sales. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a very significant impact. They've had to reduce prices and they've 
actually dumped a lot of grapes," said Dolores Huerta, a co-founder of the UFW. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the boycotters have not built a definitive case that all five of the 
pesticides pose a present danger to farm workers and consumers. One of the five 
was taken off the market three years ago, and research on the other four is 
incomplete, although there is strong evidence that at least one of the 
pesticides still in use does cause cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers argue that the grape boycott has more to do with politics than 
pesticides. They say that Chavez seized on the pesticide issue in a desperate 
attempt to boost the standing of his union. Membership in the UFW has declined 
by about 50% over the last 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, farm groups say that cities like San Francisco, with strong ties to 
organized labor, are joining the boycott more out of solidarity with the UFW 
than out of concern over pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
"This (grape boycott) is strictly the last gasp of a dying union. It has about 
as much to do with health and pesticides as the man in the moon," said Yates of 
the Farm Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
Still, farmers worry that the pesticide issue could cause problems for them. 
They fear what could happen if big-city politicians like Agnos, with media 
access to millions of consumers, go on saying that certain farm products are 
dosed with deadly chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
"You can scare the wits out of Americans with this pesticide talk. It doesn't 
matter if it's true or not. It's like Goebbels (Joseph Goebbels, Hitler's 
minister of propaganda) and the big lie. If it's allowed to continue unchecked, 
people will believe it," said Bruce J. Obbink, president of the California 
Table Grape Commission. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, there are some in the Central Valley -- people with ties to 
agriculture -- who are critical of the counter-boycott, arguing, in effect, 
that two wrongs don't make a right. 
</P>
<P>
"I disagree with both boycotts. They get away from the real issues, which are 
examining pesticides and selling more grapes," said Fresno County Supervisor 
Doug Vagim, who cast the lone vote against the county resolution supporting the 
San Francisco boycott. 
</P>
<P>
The grandson of farmers, Vagim argues that the counter-boycott is particularly 
silly in light of the working relationship that Fresno and San Francisco have 
developed over the years. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that Fresno County operates a teaching hospital that is partially 
staffed by the University of San Francisco Medical Center -- an arrangement 
that calls for close cooperation between the two institutions. 
</P>
<P>
"Hospital business requires some 30-odd visits a month to San Francisco. Now, 
we have a resolution saying there will be no more business meetings held in San 
Francisco. It doesn't make any sense," Vagim said. 
</P>
<P>
The boycott of San Francisco imposes other hardships. Farmers in the San 
Joaquin Valley may not like San Francisco politics, but they like San Francisco 
sports, and they will have a hard time tearing up their Giants tickets if the 
boycott is still going on when baseball season starts. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, officials of the Table Grape Commission were asked if they planned to 
boycott a speech scheduled in Fresno later this month by Bill Walsh, who 
coached the 49ers to a Super Bowl victory last month. 
</P>
<P>
"Boycott Bill Walsh? Don't be ridiculous," Obbink said.

KITTY DUKAKIS IS TREATED FOR ALCOHOLISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Apparently despondent over her husband's failed Democratic presidential 
campaign last year, Kitty Dukakis has entered a treatment program for 
alcoholism, Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Dukakis said his wife, who spoke repeatedly during the campaign about her 
successful battle in 1982 to quit a 26-year dependency on diet pills, had begun 
drinking at home in the three months since the election. 
</P>
<P>
"Until shortly after Election Day on Nov. 8, Kitty had never had a problem with 
alcohol," Dukakis said in a statement released in Boston. "Unfortunately, a 
combination of physical exhaustion, the stress of the campaign effort and the 
post-election let-down all combined to create a situation in which, on a 
limited number of occasions while at home, she has used alcohol in excessive 
quantities." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Facility in Newport 
</P>
<P>
The governor said his wife was admitted Sunday evening to Edgehill Newport, a 
highly regarded, 160-bed residential treatment facility in Newport, R.I., for 
alcoholics and chemically dependent men and women. 
</P>
<P>
Dukakis said his wife voluntarily decided to seek treatment because she has 
recognized since her 1982 treatment that "she is chemically dependent and . . . 
that her recovery is always at risk." He said he and his family supported her 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
Cathy Damakos, an Edgehill spokeswoman, said the treatment typically begins 
with one to seven days of close medical observation, followed by a 28-day 
rehabilitation program involving one-on-one counseling, group therapy, plus 
family sessions. A Statehouse spokeswoman in Boston said Dukakis would 
participate in his wife's therapy sessions. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Dukakis announced in July, 1987, that she had been treated five years 
earlier at the Hazelden clinic in Minnesota for a 26-year addiction to 
amphetamines. 
</P>
<P>
"As she has now discovered, whether it comes in a bottle or in solid, if you're 
chemically dependent, you're chemically dependent," Dukakis told a Statehouse 
news conference. After her 1982 treatment, "she thought they were two different 
things," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Dukakis campaigned frequently before students last year to cite her own 
story in moving terms and warn about the dangers of drug and alcohol abuse. 
Like many recovering addicts and alcoholics, she said in an interview with The 
Times last May that she still had to "struggle" with her former dependency. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Effusive Campaigner 
</P>
<P>
Often described as a fiery complement to her husband's icy demeanor, Mrs. 
Dukakis was a warm, wisecracking and effusive campaigner. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Dukakis, 52, began a nationwide speaking tour on Jan. 11 with a United 
Jewish Appeal reception in Beverly Hills, and has signed a contract to 
co-author a book about her experiences in the campaign. But since the election, 
"she has been very sad," said Sandy Bakalar, a lifelong friend who often 
traveled with Mrs. Dukakis during the campaign. "I think she's been grieving. 
This loss has been very, very difficult." 
</P>
<P>
Bakalar said Mrs. Dukakis felt "sad and empty" when the campaign ended. "For a 
year and a half, she would wake up, people would set her schedule, they would 
tell her where she was going, a car was waiting and she was gone," she said. 
"She loved it. She was going 1,000 miles a minute, and then on Nov. 8, it was 
suddenly over. It was like someone died." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Al Peters, a recovering alcoholic who is Mrs. Dukakis' brother-in-law and 
who advised her to seek treatment, said her alcoholism was being treated "at 
the earliest stages." He praised her for going public with the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes an awful lot of courage to recognize and to admit one's chemical 
dependency, be it alcoholism or whatever, and to seek treatment," he said. 
"Hopefully, this may send a message to other people to have the courage to 
admit their problem and to seek appropriate treatment. Alcoholism is a 
treatable disease. The only shame in alcoholism is when it's not treated."

PARAGUAY RULER DENIES LINKS TO DRUG TRAFFIC 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Gen. Andres Rodriguez, Paraguay's new military ruler, vowed Monday to crack 
down on drug trafficking and swore that he has never been involved in drug 
dealing. He dismissed allegations to the contrary as the work of enemies out to 
eliminate him. 
</P>
<P>
Relaxed and smiling, Rodriguez answered questions from groups of reporters for 
more than two hours. Meetings with the press were a rarity during the 34 
1/2-year regime of former President Alfredo Stroessner, who flew into exile 
Sunday after being deposed in Rodriguez's coup two days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez repeated his commitment to respect human rights and bring democracy 
to Paraguay, but at the same time he indicated that political change would be 
neither sudden nor profound. For example, he said that Stroessner had not been 
a dictator and that past elections had not been fraudulent. 
</P>
<P>
He also said that if he was asked, he would accept the nomination of the ruling 
Colorado Party in the May 1 election to fill the remainder of Stroessner's term 
until 1993. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Anticipated Questions 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez, commander of the 1st Army Corps, who had been Stroessner's 
second-in-command, clearly anticipated a grilling on reports published in the 
United States that he has been linked to shipments of drugs through Paraguay. 
</P>
<P>
He said in a prepared statement that he considers drug-trafficking "one of the 
worst scourges that flay humanity" and that his government will ensure that 
"the laws are more severe and energetic to suppress it." 
</P>
<P>
Responding to questions, he said: "I detest drugs. I swear as a (Roman) 
Catholic and as the head of a family, I swear on my sons, that I am not 
involved in drug trafficking." 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said that he would cooperate with the U.S. Drug Enforcement 
Administration and all other international agencies in the fight against 
narcotics. 
</P>
<P>
Former U.S. Ambassador Clyde D. Taylor Jr. has charged that senior Paraguayan 
officials were involved in drugs, but he did not accuse anyone by name. That 
earned him scorn from the pro-Stroessner news media. 
</P>
<P>
There have been unverified reports in the American press that Rodriguez has 
played a major role in the smuggling of drug shipments through Paraguay. The 
U.S. government has often complained about drug smuggling through that country, 
and although U.S. officials have not publicly linked Rodriguez to the drug 
trade, they are known to believe that he is deeply involved. 
</P>
<P>
In his news conference, Rodriguez, a multimillionaire with several business 
interests including money-changing and imports, said he has been to the United 
States many times, including official visits to the Pentagon, and "they never 
even said anything to me." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Shining Opportunity' 
</P>
<P>
"I happily thank you for giving me this shining opportunity to say to you that 
never in my life have I had any friendship or connection with any person with 
respect to drug trafficking," he said. "I know that there was an elimination 
campaign against me. I don't know by which opposition party. . . . It would be 
someone with bad intentions interested in eliminating me." 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said that the number of dead and wounded in the six hours or so of 
fighting that ended Friday with Stroessner's ouster did not exceed 50. Foreign 
diplomats had estimated the death toll at about 300. 
</P>
<P>
The Paraguayan political opposition had reacted jubilantly to Stroessner's 
downfall and to Rodriguez's initial public statements in defense of civil 
rights and the need for full democracy, which everyone outside the ruling 
Colorado Party agrees has never existed in Paraguay. 
</P>
<P>
But there was immediate criticism of Rodriguez's announcement at the final 
meeting with reporters Monday that elections for president and Congress will be 
held May 1. This will be less than 90 days after the coup. The short campaign 
period gives a huge advantage to the Colorado Party, which has a vast 
nationwide organization and demands the support of public workers, civic groups 
and organized labor. The opposition will have to start from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
Rafael Saguier, a member of the still-banned Authentic Liberal Radical Party, 
considered to be the primary opposition force, said: "Gen. Rodriguez knows that 
this short period is insufficient. This is a trick played on the opposition. He 
knows that we have not been able to organize for nearly 35 years and that all 
public servants and all army members must be Colorado Party members. 
</P>
<P>
"And he defends past national elections as fair. This has the makings of 
another dictatorship. Rodriguez wants to be another Stroessner. They are going 
to change what they have to change to keep things the same." 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said that all four opposition parties, presently outlawed, could 
compete in the elections and that only Communist parties were prohibited. 
Paraguay has no active Communist Party. "Ex-President Stroessner was not a 
dictator," he said. "He was freely elected in elections that had outside 
observers." 
</P>
<P>
Asked why he had overthrown Stroessner if the latter was not a dictator, the 
64-year-old general replied, "In recent times, President Stroessner was not 
producing good results for the party that had placed its trust in him." 
</P>
<P>
Despite an expression of support for free news media by the new leader, 
Rodriguez's government censored from outgoing foreign television news reports 
any references to the death toll in the coup or to a possible Paraguayan role 
in drug dealing. There was no attempt to censor radio reports or newspaper or 
news agency articles sent abroad.

GORBACHEV URGED TO DRASTICALLY ALTER ECONOMY

<TEXT>
<P>
One of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's principal economic advisers proposed 
radical changes Monday, including a 30% cut in the Soviet defense budget, in an 
effort to restore popular faith in Gorbachev's reform program. 
</P>
<P>
Abel G. Aganbegyan, secretary of the economic section of the Soviet Academy of 
Sciences, called on the government to spend a quarter of its foreign earnings 
to import Western consumer products and to cancel dozens of major industrial 
projects and use the money for new housing. 
</P>
<P>
Aganbegyan, writing in the Communist Party newspaper Pravda, called for an 
intensive three- to four-year effort to satisfy widespread expectations, so far 
unfulfilled, that perestroika -- as Gorbachev's political and economic reforms 
are known -- would bring a better life. 
</P>
<P>
"Most Soviet families are not feeling changes for the better," he said, 
acknowledging that the resulting disappointment is building into a serious 
political problem for the Soviet leadership. "On paper, we have been taking one 
step forward, but in practice we have been going back two steps." 
</P>
<P>
Going boldly beyond most other reform economists, Aganbegyan urged a massive 
effort to satisfy consumer demand, which greatly outstrips supplies for 
everyday necessities and for luxury goods, in order to build confidence in the 
reforms and to spur faster economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Video Recorders, Computers 
</P>
<P>
Aganbegyan sees in the pent-up demand for consumer goods -- particularly luxury 
items such as videotape recorders, personal computers, high-quality furniture 
and passenger cars -- a way of accelerating economic growth -- 4.4% last year 
compared to the planned 6.6% -- and building the political as well as economic 
momentum needed for reform. 
</P>
<P>
The whole Soviet economy is changing too slowly, Aganbegyan said. The technical 
level of production and the quality of Soviet products have improved only a 
little despite the reforms of the past four years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to go two or three times faster," he said of the effort to 
restructure the Soviet economy. For example, passenger car production, now 
about 1.8 million vehicles a year, should be increased by 2 million to 3 
million annually, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The urgency with which Aganbegyan views the need to bolster popular confidence 
in the reforms, as well as his desire to foster an economic takeoff, takes him 
well beyond the proposals offered by other reform economists and the positions 
taken by Gorbachev himself in the debate on the country's economic strategy. 
</P>
<P>
Where Gorbachev has announced a 14% reduction in military spending, Aganbegyan 
calls for a 30% cut so that the savings can be used in the civilian sector. 
</P>
<P>
Where other reform economists are suggesting that some foreign loans might be 
used to purchase as much as $7 billion in Western consumer goods over two or 
three years, Aganbegyan proposes doubling such purchases so that they 
constitute at least 25% of all Soviet imports. He calls for cutting back on the 
purchase of machinery to make this possible. 
</P>
<P>
And where others have questioned the immediate need for some of the major 
development projects, Aganbegyan demands the immediate cancellation of two 
giant hydroelectric plants and several massive new irrigation canals, along 
with any other project that cannot quickly pay for itself. He also urges the 
closure of money-losing state enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
"The principal problem is to meet people's demands," Aganbegyan wrote in 
Pravda, "but the measures should not be administrative -- quite a new approach 
is needed to expand independence (of enterprises) and abolish directive-type 
planning." 
</P>
<P>
But Aganbegyan, once the leading proponent of major price reform as the key to 
fundamental economic reform, urged the government to postpone for three or four 
years any effort to restructure the Soviet price system. He had earlier 
insisted that these changes, essential if market forces are to play the larger 
role advocated by most reform economists, be completed by 1991. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Major Implications 
</P>
<P>
If Aganbegyan's proposal is accepted by Gorbachev, it would stretch out the 
overall economic reform effort and have major political and social 
implications. 
</P>
<P>
"The main thing now is to take measures to make the ailing economic mechanism 
healthy," he said, arguing that the country is not prepared for the fundamental 
shifts he believes are needed. 
</P>
<P>
Market-driven growth could be "a powerful engine for the renewal and 
improvement of the whole economy," he continued, but it would require a number 
of support measures, including the large-scale shift of resources now 
controlled by government ministries and state enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
Another major economic goal of his proposal is to reduce inflation, widely 
estimated at 6% to 7% but potentially much more than that, by meeting the 
demand for high-cost items. At the same time, he hopes to cut the government's 
budget deficit through the profits brought in by the sale of the new products. 
</P>
<P>
In his proposal, one of several put forward by leading Soviet economists in 
recent weeks, Aganbegyan dodges responsibility for the failure of Gorbachev's 
initial reforms -- of which he was the principal architect -- to fulfill the 
implicit promise of a better life. 
</P>
<P>
The country's economic stagnation is even deeper than he and other specialists 
had realized, Aganbegyan said, and resistance to the reforms is greater than 
anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
As they have been implemented, he said, the reforms are largely half-measures 
and not radical enough to transform the economy.

2 U.S. JEWISH GROUPS GIVE ISRAEL BAD NEWS; 
</P>
<P>
AMERICAN PUBLIC, OFFICIALS FINDING IT HARD TO BACK PALESTINIAN POLICIES, 
GOVERNMENT IS TOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Members of two major American Jewish groups have come to Israel with harsh 
news: that the American public and many U.S. officials are finding it hard to 
support Israel's policies toward the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
"You ask for support . . . but people in this government cannot call 
Palestinians 'grasshoppers,' break their bones and expect people who support 
the underdog to speak up (in Israel's favor)," said Lawrence Goldmuntz, 
president of the Washington-based Jewish Institute for National Security 
Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"The underdog, in the perception of Americans, is the Palestinians," Goldmuntz 
said. "You are blowing up homes. This has got to stop." 
</P>
<P>
Yosef Ben-Aharon, a top aide to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, 
responded by saying that the alternative to demolishing the homes of people who 
throw stones is "executing people who cause injury or death to Israeli people." 
</P>
<P>
"If you can't explain that, you can't explain it," Ben-Aharon concluded. 
</P>
<P>
The give-and-take was typical of the past few days here. American Jewish 
leaders have descended on Jerusalem to hear what the Israeli government has to 
say about questions of war and peace and, in some cases, to probe further and 
even offer a bit of advice. 
</P>
<P>
Two groups, the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations 
and the governing board of the American Jewish Committee, were here. They are 
among several expected in Israel in anticipation of a meeting between Shamir 
and President Bush, sometime next month. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Zionist Conference Sought 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government is trying to organize a Zionist conference that it hopes 
will demonstrate world Jewry's support for Israel's position on the question of 
ending the Arab uprising in the occupied territories and making peace in the 
Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
The way appears to be rocky. American Jews, normally highly supportive of 
Israel, are coming here with a skeptical attitude and are straining to 
understand the Israeli government's slow response to diplomatic moves by the 
Palestine Liberation Organization. 
</P>
<P>
Some, like Goldmuntz, who came with the Conference of Presidents, directly 
challenge Israeli policies -- in this case, actions designed to deter Arab 
stone-throwers in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Others listen quietly 
but come away apparently yearning for clearer answers from a government 
pleading at once for more time and for immediate support. 
</P>
<P>
Israel's interest in American Jewish opinion is clear. It wants to avoid 
developments such as occurred last December, when Washington announced its 
willingness to talk to the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
George P. Shultz, who was then secretary of state, opened the contact after the 
PLO said it had abandoned terrorism and accepted Israel's right to exist in 
security. The shock to Israel was multiplied when major Jewish groups in the 
United States failed to attack Shultz's initiative. 
</P>
<P>
"We were aghast that our friends in the States did not rise up in unison to 
condemn this step," Ben-Aharon told the Conference of Presidents on Monday. 
"There is a need now to mobilize all the efforts to bring about an improvement 
in the situation. Talks with the PLO cannot produce anything positive." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Major Israeli Goal 
</P>
<P>
For the moment, getting the United States to end its contacts with the PLO 
appears to be a major goal of the Israeli government, and it wants the American 
Jews to help. 
</P>
<P>
According to officials in Israel, the PLO has already broken its pledge to 
abandon terrorism, and Israel has called on Washington to break contact. 
Foreign Minister Moshe Arens, in a speech to about 65 members of the Conference 
of Presidents, said that a clash between Israeli troops and five heavily armed 
Palestinians that took place Sunday in southern Lebanon proves that the PLO's 
no-terror promise has been broken. 
</P>
<P>
Two radical PLO factions, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and 
the Palestine Liberation Front, took responsibility for trying to attack 
Israeli positions north of the Israeli border. Israel maintains that the 
guerrillas were bent on infiltrating into Israel itself and attacking civilian 
targets. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli government officials urged the American Jews not to view the 
suppression of the Arab uprising, in which about 350 Palestinians have been 
killed, as brutal. 
</P>
<P>
"Our friends in the United States are either passive or critical or paralyzed," 
Ben-Aharon said. "This is negative. There is a lot you can do to debunk 
misconceptions." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Seem Unconvinced 
</P>
<P>
Many of the listeners seemed unconvinced. Robert Lifton, president of the 
American Jewish Congress, cautioned that American Jews do not have an endless 
supply of influence and that backing Israel on the Palestinian issue may not be 
the best place to spend that influence. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be aware, we have to pick and choose our spots," Lifton said. 
</P>
<P>
Ben-Aharon's presentation was undercut by a fellow panel member, Shlomo 
Avineri, a former high government official who suggested that Israel should 
feel out the PLO. As for the West Bank and Gaza Strip, he described the problem 
there as one not of image but of policy. 
</P>
<P>
"The time has come to try to nail Arafat down and see if there are substantive 
changes in the PLO," Avineri said. "It would be good for Israel to ask these 
tough questions of the PLO." 
</P>
<P>
Public perceptions of the intifada, as the uprising is called, may or may not 
be distorted, Avineri said, but certain basics are clear: "The fact is in the 
last year the army -- our army -- has killed about 300 Palestinian civilians. 
We have a few thousand in detention. There is no point in denying . . . the not 
very pleasant picture." 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the members of the American Jewish Committee, one of the oldest 
American Jewish groups, heard Foreign Minister Arens plead for support. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope the position of the government of Israel will enjoy the support of the 
Jewish community throughout the world," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But questioners noted that different Israeli officials give different 
impressions of Israel's policy, and that as a result the Americans do not know 
exactly what position they should support. Arens agreed that the complaint is 
valid. 
</P>
<P>
"We are sometimes not perceived to be speaking in one voice," he said, and he 
promised that "we're going to avoid that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Differences in the Government 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin has openly favored giving up 
territory in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in exchange for peace, a stand that 
is opposed by Prime Minister Shamir. 
</P>
<P>
There have been difficulties in trying to obtain all the conflicting views of 
the Israeli-Arab situation. On Monday night, the committee tried to arrange a 
dinner panel that would include members of Shamir's rightist Likud Party and 
Palestinian spokesmen. 
</P>
<P>
The Likud members refused to attend because they did not want to sit with the 
Palestinians. The Palestinians did not attend because they learned that Arabs 
who have cooperated with Israeli rule in the West Bank and Gaza were also 
scheduled to be present. 
</P>
<P>
"The Middle East is in flux and so is our meeting," the master of ceremonies 
quipped.

U.S. SEEKS VAST POWER OVER UNION; 
</P>
<P>
TERMS IN TEAMSTER PROPOSAL SHOW FEDERAL CONTROL TO 1996 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
The troika of administrators that the federal government wants to put in charge 
of the Teamsters Union would have vast power over the union's operations until 
1996 and its elections until 2001, according to the government's proposed terms 
for settling the massive racketeering case against the union. 
</P>
<P>
The government's offer was unanimously rejected by the Teamsters' board on Jan. 
28, but details of the unprecedented extent of government control sought by 
federal prosecutors had not been previously disclosed by the union or the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
According to the 19-page settlement proposal, obtained by The Times, the only 
unbridled authority left to the union would be contract negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
The federal administrators would be able to discipline officers or employees, 
institute trusteeship proceedings over local unions, examine all books of the 
international union (it also has members in Canada) or any of its 700 locals, 
and veto any expenditure of the national union's funds or the transfer of any 
of its property. 
</P>
<P>
James T. Grady, general counsel of the 1.6-million-member union, did not return 
calls seeking comment Monday. But in an interview on Jan. 28, he branded the 
settlement proposed by Rudolph W. Giuliani, then U.S. attorney for the Southern 
District of New York, "totally unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
Randy M. Mastro, the assistant U.S. attorney in charge of the racketeering 
suit, also was unavailable for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The civil suit, filed against the Teamsters last June under the 
Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), charged that the 
union is heavily influenced by organized crime and is not responsibly serving 
the interests of its membership. A trial in the case is scheduled to begin in 
federal court in New York on Feb. 27. 
</P>
<P>
The suit marks the first time that the government, in essence, is seeking to 
take over a national union. The RICO law previously had been used in an attempt 
to purge alleged corruption from several local unions in New York and New 
Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
As previously reported, the union would be required to acknowledge that "there 
have been past problems with La Cosa Nostra corruption of various elements of 
the IBT (International Brotherhood of Teamsters)." 
</P>
<P>
And the Teamsters Union would have to change dramatically the way it conducts 
elections for its top officers. The union constitution would have to be amended 
so that delegates to national conventions would be elected by a rank-and-file 
secret ballot no more than six months in advance of the convention. Now, some 
delegates are picked several years in advance and some union officers become 
delegates simply by virtue of other positions they hold in the union. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, once at the convention, the delegates would nominate the top 
officers, rather than vote on a slate presented by the union hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
The president, the secretary-treasurer and the five area conference directors 
would then be elected by rank-and-file secret ballot. The 11 vice presidents 
and three trustees would be elected by delegates to the convention in a secret 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The "Election Officer" would supervise elections at the union's next convention 
in 1991 and then in 1996 and 2001. The Labor Department would supervise 
Teamster elections in 2006 and 2011 and any special union elections held 
between 2001 and 2011. 
</P>
<P>
Among the troika would be an "investigations officer" who could launch 
inquiries on a wide range of matters involving the national union or any of its 
state or local bodies. Further, the "Independent Administrator" would be 
empowered to place locals under trusteeships. The standard of proof would be 
"just cause," according to the settlement proposal. Labor lawyers noted that it 
is a standard that is less rigorous than normally would be applied in a court 
action. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement also would require the union to pay for insurance to protect any 
of the three court-appointed government officials and persons acting for them 
"from personal liability for any of their actions on behalf" of the union.

KIN OF VICTIMS ON BOMBED JET DEMAND NEW INQUIRY

An enraged, tearful group of families of Pan Am Flight 103 crash victims 
demanded Monday that President Bush create an independent commission to 
investigate the actions of the airline and the U.S. government in the aftermath 
of the bombing of the jumbo jet that killed 270 people just before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
About 30 family members -- some with a color picture of a dead relative pinned 
to their clothing -- accused Pan American World Airways of callousness and the 
State Department of ignoring their pleas for information. 
</P>
<P>
They also charged that the airline did not take adequate security precautions 
despite a previous warning of a potential bombing, that it ignored the report 
of an El Al Israel Airlines consultant of potentially serious security 
weaknesses and that it left families to fend for themselves in the days after 
the crash. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Allegations Denied 
</P>
<P>
The State Department and Pan Am, although acknowledging the next of kin's 
grief, denied the allegations. The White House had no immediate response to the 
group's demand for an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Hudson, whose 16-year-old daughter, Melinda, was killed on the flight, 
called on President Bush "to break your silence on this tragedy and exercise 
your leadership to identify and punish persons responsible. We want Pan Am to 
be held accountable for what happened. Pan Am is said to have received 
recommendations from El Al, the airline that has the best security in the world 
for preventing bomb incidents, two years ago and did not act on them." 
</P>
<P>
Hudson demanded an accounting of why the government had not made public a 
terrorist threat that such a flight would be bombed. He said only 22 such 
threats to airplanes were considered high-level last year and "to cancel 22 
flights would hardly result in closing down air travel altogether." 
</P>
<P>
Bonnie O'Connor accused Pan Am of showing no interest when the body of her 
brother, John Ahern, 26, was brought home. "There wasn't even a person from Pan 
Am to shake our hand," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Cohen, who lost his 20-year-old daughter, Theo, a student at Syracuse 
University, told how several days after the crash a Pan Am representative 
called his home, offering "some kind of counseling." 
</P>
<P>
Cohen said at that moment his wife was distraught in the kitchen, shouting: "My 
life is over." He said he held the phone out so the airline employee could hear 
his wife's pain. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't help you," Cohen said the employee told him, and then hung up. 
</P>
<P>
Other relatives said that aside from initial death notifications from the State 
Department, the only communication they received was how to arrange to receive 
personal effects from those killed on the plane. 
</P>
<P>
"We understand the anger and the frustration of the families as expressed today 
in their meeting with the press," a Pan Am spokesman said. "We have attempted 
to do everything possible, without being intrusive, to be supportive and 
responsive to the needs of the relatives and friends of the victims during this 
very difficult time. Since the incident, we have tried to communicate 
continually with the families on a personal basis with one employee assigned to 
being liaison with one of the families." 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Kriendler, the airline's vice president for public relations, said that in 
1986 two Israelis were hired to survey Pan Am's security practices in Europe. 
"They came in with recommendations. Some were acted upon. Some were not. They 
were hoping that their recommendations would lead to full-time employment with 
Pan Am. The company declined their offer. The relationship ended at that time." 
</P>
<P>
Kriendler said Pan Am representatives were present at the airport each time 
bodies arrived. 
</P>
<P>
Pan Am and the State Department have said the threat to harm American flights 
in December was too general to lead to public warnings about specific flights. 
</P>
<P>
Philip Covington, a State Department spokesman, said that immediately after the 
crash, a special 30- or 40-person working group was established to act as 
liaison with family members. 
</P>
<P>
"We have done everything we could in this case," he said. " . . . We have 
continued to work closely with the families. There is not a single letter we 
have received from a family member we have not answered. We think we have done 
a very good and thorough job in this terrible tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Meeting With FBI Official 
</P>
<P>
After the news conference, Hudson and Bert Ammerman, another family member, 
conferred in Washington with Oliver B. (Buck) Revell, the FBI's executive 
assistant director for investigations. 
</P>
<P>
Revell said that during the meeting he gave them his "assurance and commitment 
and resolve to follow this through to the logical end and find those 
responsible for the criminal act." 
</P>
<P>
Officials have determined that the jumbo jet was destroyed by a sophisticated 
bomb and have no conclusive evidence who planted the device. But the FBI and 
other investigators remain optimistic that they eventually will be able to 
identify those who are responsible, sources familiar with the massive inquiry 
said.

RETAINS CONFIDENCE IN TOWER DESPITE RUMORS, BUSH SAYS 
</P>

<P>
President Bush said Monday that he retains confidence in John Tower as his 
nominee for secretary of defense and that the controversy over the former Texas 
senator's private life would not cripple his ability to handle the Pentagon 
job. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate Armed Services Committee has held up Tower's confirmation while the 
FBI investigates new allegations of excessive drinking and womanizing. In the 
course of its renewed inquiry over the weekend, FBI agents turned up additional 
charges of personal misconduct by Tower, but they could not be substantiated, 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush was briefed Monday on the progress of the FBI investigation and told 
reporters at an afternoon press conference that he has heard nothing that would 
shake his confidence in Tower. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people would not want a person to step aside, given rumor, 
particularly if the rumor is baseless," Bush said. " . . . If these allegations 
prove to be allegations without fact behind them, I think the people are going 
to say: 'Wait a minute, what went on here?' " 
</P>
<P>
He said, however, that "if someone comes up with facts" indicating that Tower 
is unfit to serve in government, he is not too "narrow-minded" to listen to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI report is virtually complete but has not been forwarded to the Armed 
Services Committee, sources said. No date has been set for a vote on the 
nomination, but panel Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) said Monday evening that a vote 
today is unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
The full Senate probably will not receive the nomination until next week. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said that, if Tower is approved, as he expects, he does not believe that 
"there's any danger to his credibility or his ability to do his job." 
</P>
<P>
Some Democrats in Congress, notably House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les 
Aspin of Wisconsin, have said that the flurry of rumors about Tower and the 
protracted confirmation process will leave him weakened and unable to 
effectively take charge at the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
Tower was said Monday to be confident that he will be confirmed. He spent the 
day at the Pentagon working on budget and policy issues with aides.

5TH-GAME DRAW GIVES KARPOV CHESS VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anatoly Karpov of the Soviet Union drew the fifth game of his quarterfinal 
Candidates chess match against Johann Hjartarson of Iceland in Seattle. By 
drawing, Karpov won the best-of-six-game match, 3 1/2-1 1/2. The sixth game 
will not be played. 
</P>
<P>
The Candidates matches are a series of knockout matches conducted by the World 
Chess Federation to choose a challenger to world champion Gary Kasparov in the 
1990 world chess championship. Karpov, who was world champion from 1975 to 1985 
and is now the world's second-ranked player, advances to the semifinal round. 
He will play his countryman, Artur Yusupov, in a semifinal match, tentatively 
scheduled for this September in London. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's game repeated the opening moves of the third game, which Karpov had 
won, until move 11, when Hjartarson varied his play. Hjartarson appeared to 
have a slight advantage, but Karpov reached a drawn end game by sacrificing 
first a pawn, and then his queen. 
</P>
<P>
Karpov earned $50,000 for his victory. Hjartarson received $30,000. The match 
was sponsored by Seattle 1990 Goodwill Games. 
</P>
<P>
Here are the moves of the final game:

DANNEMEYER SHARPLY REBUKED BY COLLEAGUE FOR POSITION ON AIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a highly unusual action, Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) has used the vehicle of 
a "dear colleague" letter -- which goes to every member of the House -- to 
launch a personal attack on California Rep. William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) 
over his position on AIDS policy. 
</P>
<P>
The letter criticized Dannemeyer for consistently fighting AIDS proposals 
advocated by public health experts and for defending his opposition by arguing 
that health officials and House members are "out of touch" with the thinking of 
the American people on AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"Dear colleague" letters traditionally are sent by lawmakers to the rest of the 
House membership to drum up support for or opposition to legislation, or to 
propose other initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
Frank, who is an acknowledged homosexual, insisted in an interview Monday that 
"I would not have used the 'dear colleague' system of the House purely for 
polemics. I believe there is an important public policy point to be made here." 
</P>
<P>
But he added: "There are rules of excessive civility around here to which I 
generally subscribe. You do need a certain amount of courtliness in the system. 
But that, in itself, can become a form of abuse. There are limits to when you 
restrain yourself from calling a fool a fool." 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer refused to comment on the letter, but an aide said that he had 
drafted a private response to Frank. "We're not going to make it a 'dear 
colleague' letter," a spokesman for Dannemeyer said. "Barney Frank is just 
trying to goad us for personal reasons and we've advised him (Dannemeyer) not 
to make a big deal of it. We've advised him to take the higher road." 
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Frank pointed out that the recent AIDS initiative in California, 
Proposition 102, which Dannemeyer sponsored, was a "test . . . of public 
opinion" and was "very soundly defeated." 
</P>
<P>
Frank wrote: "I eagerly await this year's debate on AIDS issues in which we may 
well be told that the trouble with this country is that the people are out of 
touch with themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 102, similar to an AIDS initiative sponsored earlier by political 
extremist Lyndon LaRouche, which was also defeated, would have required 
physicians to disclose the names of people known to be or suspected of being 
infected with the AIDS virus. Further, it would have required that those who 
have had sexual contacts with AIDS carriers be traced and notified, and would 
have repealed laws barring insurance companies and employers from using AIDS 
test results. 
</P>
<P>
In a similar measure defeated by the House last year, Dannemeyer proposed 
mandatory reporting of all infected individuals. Further, he proposed 
legislation, also defeated, that would have required AIDS tests for prisoners, 
couples applying for marriage licenses and all hospital patients. 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer also has opposed legislation that would protect AIDS patients and 
those infected with the virus from discrimination and from violations of 
confidentiality regarding their test results. 
</P>
<P>
Federal health officials and other members of the public health community have 
been united in supporting the enactment of confidentiality and 
anti-discrimination legislation and in opposing such measures as Proposition 
102 and those sponsored in the House by Dannemeyer. 
</P>
<P>
Frank said he hopes the information about the California vote will prove useful 
when Congress considers AIDS legislation during this session. 
</P>
<P>
"Members want to do the right thing," he said. "It's very important for them to 
know that Californians voted nearly 2 to 1 against this stuff. It says, look, 
the demagogues can't fool the voters all the time, even though they wish they 
could." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the House energy and commerce 
subcommittee on health, who has locked horns numerous times with Dannemeyer 
over AIDS legislation, praised the Frank letter and said that it is important 
that House members know "how thoroughly the views of Bill Dannemeyer were 
repudiated by the voters of California." 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer frequently has denounced homosexuality, saying: "I will not 
apologize for embracing the heterosexual ethic." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Bray, a spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign Fund, a gay political 
action committee, said that Frank's letter represents a welcomed departure from 
the typical congressional protocol. "The white gloves have been removed," Bray 
said. "The slap has been made."

HUNGER STRIKER PERSISTS IN BID FOR AIDS MEASURE

<P>
Stuart McDonald is in the 36th day of a hunger strike that he has been told 
could hasten his death from AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
But the 33-year-old attorney, who suffers from AIDS-related complex, hopes his 
fast will persuade Gov. George Deukmejian to ban discrimination against 
homosexuals and people who are infected with the deadly virus. 
</P>
<P>
At an emotional press conference in the Capitol on Monday, McDonald vowed to 
continue his fast until the Republican governor reverses his stand and says he 
will sign legislation prohibiting such discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
"I am ready to continue this until he comes out and publicly supports and 
agrees to sign that legislation," McDonald said. "If someone puts their life on 
the line for this, just maybe the governor's heartstrings would be pulled a 
tiny little bit. Maybe that would change his mind." 
</P>
<P>
But Deukmejian, who has acquired a reputation for stubbornness in his dealings 
with the Legislature, is not likely to be moved by McDonald's appeal, aides to 
the governor said. 
</P>
<P>
"We view it as rather unfortunate that Mr. McDonald would be injuring his own 
health for such a misguided reason," said Deukmejian press secretary Kevin 
Brett. "Instead of injuring his own health, he should be saluting the governor 
because California has done more in the fight against AIDS than any other 
state." 
</P>
<P>
He noted that the governor has increased the annual AIDS budget from $3 million 
to $103 million in the last six years. 
</P>
<P>
Brett also said McDonald should file a complaint with the state Department of 
Fair Employment and Housing if he believes he has been a victim of 
discrimination. The agency, Brett said, investigates complaints of 
discrimination against people who have been infected with the AIDS virus even 
if they have no apparent handicap from the disease. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Looking for Work 
</P>
<P>
McDonald told reporters that he had been unable to find a permanent job since 
he tested positive for exposure to the AIDS virus four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald, who lives in San Francisco and was admitted to the California State 
Bar in 1986, said he had sent out more than 1,000 letters and resumes in search 
of work as an attorney, or even as a law clerk or paralegal. 
</P>
<P>
In his letters, McDonald said he disclosed the fact that he suffers from 
AIDS-related complex, which can sap his strength but still allows him to work a 
40-hour week. The letters brought him two job interviews, but no offers. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I did go out and tell employers, all of them, that I have physical 
limitations," he said. "I was very honest about it." 
</P>
<P>
McDonald, upset by his repeated rejection in the job market, began his fast 
Jan. 2, he said. During the hunger strike, he said he has been drinking coffee, 
herbal tea and Gatorade. He has lost 40 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"My doctor has told me that I will probably come down with AIDS as a result of 
the fast," McDonald said. "I don't want to die. I'd rather be out eating pizza. 
. . . (But) this is probably the most important thing I have ever done in my 
entire life." 
</P>
<P>
McDonald contends that he would not have had such difficulties in finding 
employment if Deukmejian had signed legislation aimed at protecting people who 
are in his predicament. Deukmejian vetoed legislation in 1984 that would have 
prohibited discrimination against homosexuals in employment and housing, 
arguing that there was no compelling evidence of widespread discrimination 
based on sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the governor vetoed a bill that would have banned discrimination 
against people who have tested positive for the AIDS virus but have not 
developed symptoms of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
In refusing to sign the AIDS measure, Deukmejian said he was not convinced of 
the need for such legislation.

CAR CRASH KILLS VICTORVILLE MAYOR, INJURES WIFE

Victorville Mayor Jeff Goodwill was killed and his wife critically injured in a 
head-on collision with a driver attempting to pass a mini-van on a two-lane 
desert highway, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
California Highway Patrol Officer Robert Huizinga said no one was charged in 
connection with the death Sunday of Goodwill, 41, but that an investigation was 
continuing because the third vehicle continued on after the crash. 
</P>
<P>
Goodwill's wife, Deborah K. Nagle-Goodwill, 37, who was driving a 1982 
Volkswagen that collided with a 1978 Dodge van about 20 miles east of 
Victorville, was flown by helicopter to San Bernardino County Medical Center 
where she was listed in critical condition. The driver of the van that was 
attempting to pass, Ben Owen, 66, of Lancaster, was listed in critical 
condition at Victor Valley Community Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Goodwill, a lifelong resident of Victorville and principal of High Desert High 
School, was elected mayor of the San Bernardino County community of 30,500 
people last April. 
</P>
<P>
"We are all in shock," said Victorville City Clerk Marian Nygaard. "All 
meetings of the City Council, Planning Commission and advisory committees have 
been canceled this week." 
</P>
<P>
George Davis, superintendent of the Victor Valley Union High District, added: 
"We are flying flags at half mast at each school in the district. Jeff was a 
unique and deeply committed man who touched a lot of lives in this area." 
</P>
<P>
The crash occurred at 4:30 p.m. Sunday on El Mirage Road when Owen's westbound 
van tried to pass a mini-van driven by Gregory Fox, 37, of Palmdale, Huizinga 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Owen and Goodwill vehicles struck head-on," Huizinga said. "The vehicle 
that was being passed continued on."

DORNAN CREDITS THE PEOPLE WITH KILLING U.S. PAY RAISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Members of Orange County's congressional delegation Monday applauded Speaker 
Jim Wright's decision to let them vote on an unprecedented pay raise. And all 
five said they intend to vote against the measure when it reaches the House 
floor today. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a great victory for representative government," proclaimed Dana 
Rohrabacher (R-Lomita), whose 42nd District includes a portion of west Orange 
County. Rohrabacher, like the other four members in the county delegation, all 
Republicans, credited the public with forcing today's House vote on the pay 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
"The American people raised their voices to the point they could not be 
ignored," he said in a telephone interview from Washington. "It's just too bad 
that the American people have to scream until they are hoarse." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. C. Christopher Cox of Newport Beach said his staff in recent weeks has 
received more than 1,000 phone calls and letters opposed to the pay raise. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal calls for raising the annual salaries of members of Congress from 
$89,500 to $135,000. 
</P>
<P>
The pay raise proposal had stemmed from recommendations made by a presidential 
commission. Besides the raise for members of Congress, it would increase the 
pay for federal judges and top executive branch officials. Rep. Ron Packard of 
Carlsbad, whose 43rd District covers much of south Orange County, said he would 
have preferred that Congress allow the salary increase to take effect and then 
rescind it so judges and top federal officials could have "gotten a pay boost 
that's long overdue." 
</P>
<P>
But now, "the whole thing is dead," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Packard also contends that a defeat of the pay raise will "harden the resolve" 
of congressional members to keep lucrative honorariums received from outside 
speaking engagements and appearances. With no chance of improving their base 
pay, Packard said, members will be reluctant to give up outside sources of 
income. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't deserve the pay raise," said Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove). 
"But don't limit our right to moonlighting. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Dornan defended honorariums as a legitimate way "to make ends meet." He 
challenged the public and press to determine whether a lawmaker is abusing his 
office by accepting too much outside money. 
</P>
<P>
Cox was sharply critical of how the entire pay raise issue was handled. A 
former White House attorney who won election in November to the 40th District, 
Cox said he already had a "low opinion" of Congress when he took office in 
January, and the attempt to push the pay raise through without a vote "knocked 
that opinion down a few more notches." 
</P>
<P>
"People were definitely exercised over this," Cox said. "I took one call from a 
woman who complained that we have our mistresses and we have our bribes and now 
we want more of the taxpayers' money." 
</P>
<P>
Dornan said, "The boss simply wouldn't go for it." 
</P>
<P>
In this case, the "boss" is the American people, who, Dornan said Monday, 
became fed up with watching "the employees try to give themselves a raise" and 
created a furor that has all but defeated the controversial pay package. 
</P>
<P>
Though crediting the public's role in forcing the issue, Cox also praised the 
efforts of Rep. William E. Dannemeyer of Fullerton. Dannemeyer, using his 
experience and understanding of House rules, introduced a resolution that 
unexpectedly called for the vote on Monday, a move that caught Wright by 
surprise. It forced the House Speaker to set the vote for today. 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer could not be reached for comment Monday night, but a spokesman for 
his office, Paul Mero, said the lawmaker had contemplated taking Monday's 
action for several days. 
</P>
<P>
"He just believed that someone has to take a stand and get this into the open," 
Mero said. "It's a sad commentary on Congress that this thing was sailing 
through without a vote."

HUSBAND KILLED AFTER CHASE; 
</P>
<P>
WIDOW SAYS SHE NEVER HEARD POLICE WARNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Debbie Edson remembers hearing her husband say he was going out to buy some 
shampoo. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'I'll be back in a few minutes.' " 
</P>
<P>
Within the hour, however, he was dead. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Vincent Edson, 28, was shot and killed by Anaheim police just a few feet 
from the door of the couple's motel room last Thursday. Edson had led officers 
on a 45-minute chase, police say, when he returned to the motel, got out of his 
car and started running up a flight of steps. They opened fire when he appeared 
to reach for a weapon in his waistband. No weapon was found. 
</P>
<P>
The incident is under investigation by the Orange County district attorney and 
Anaheim police. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Monday, his 29-year-old widow said she and her 9-year-old son, 
Johnny, were in the motel room when they heard the gunshots. 
</P>
<P>
"I had gone to sleep," she recalled, "and when I woke up, I heard these sounds: 
'Pop. Pop. Pop.' It was like gunshots exploding outside. I opened the door to 
look and there was Bob, lying down. He was shot." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Police Dog Attacked 
</P>
<P>
She said she watched as a police dog ran up and attacked her dying husband 
moments after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Angry and emotional during the interview, the widow charged that officers fired 
at her husband without warning. "I didn't hear anything before the shots, no 
sirens and nobody yelling at him to stop," she said. Police said officers had 
chased her husband with help from a police helicopter and cruisers that had 
sirens blaring and lights flashing. 
</P>
<P>
Edson said it was hard enough for her to accept the couple's recent run of bad 
luck -- which included eviction from an apartment in Orange when they ran out 
of rent money -- let alone her husband's death. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband had operated a struggling ticket service for concerts and sporting 
events. They decided to temporarily move into a motel for a week before looking 
for another apartment to rent, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband did not want to be stopped because he had not paid prior traffic 
tickets. Friends said that his driver's license had been suspended and that he 
could not afford auto insurance. The car was a "beat-up old thing," she said, 
that only had one working headlight. 
</P>
<P>
Police declined Monday to comment in detail on Edson's interview. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Headlights 
</P>
<P>
But Sgt. Chet Barry said officers initially tried to stop Edson because he was 
driving without his headlights on. 
</P>
<P>
"This guy had been running away from police for quite some period of time," 
Barry said. "Officers were pursuing him with red lights and siren, and also a 
police helicopter." 
</P>
<P>
As for when officers issue a warning, Barry said "it depends on the 
circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
"If you're chasing somebody and you feel like you're in jeopardy, sometimes 
there is not sufficient time to give a warning. And here, please keep in mind, 
I'm not saying these officers did or did not issue a warning. That is still 
under investigation," Barry said. 
</P>
<P>
Edson's widow said he had been wearing a heavy jacket and probably was reaching 
for his motel room key when he was shot. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't even like guns," she said. "And I never let my son play with any gun 
toys. . . . 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Son's Reaction 
</P>
<P>
"One of the worst things about this whole thing has been my son's reaction. I 
have always tried to teach Johnny that police are your friends, that whenever 
you're in trouble or you need help to call them. But after this, I don't think 
he ever will, at least that's what he told me." 
</P>
<P>
Edson charged that she and other members of her family have since run up 
against a "wall of silence" erected by investigating authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Although her husband's body was released for funeral services today, she could 
not recover his car keys, wallet, and other personal property that remains 
police evidence. 
</P>
<P>
"We still don't know how Bob died," said the widow's father, Richard Barnard of 
North Hollywood. "The police say they can't tell us. And today (Monday) we 
couldn't get any of his personal property. What kind of a system is this?" 
</P>
<P>
Left angry and emotional, Debbie Edson said she probably will seek legal 
advice. But she maintains that will be poor consolation because it will not 
bring back her husband. 
</P>
<P>
Funeral services are at 11 a.m. today at Fairhaven Memorial Park in Santa Ana.

JUDGE REFUSES TO THROW OUT SUIT OVER GOP GUARDS AT POLLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA LUTHER, Times Political Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge refused Monday to dismiss a lawsuit brought against the Orange 
County Republican Party and others over the use of uniformed security guards at 
polling places in 20 largely Latino precincts in Santa Ana on Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge J. Spencer Letts also said he does not believe that the 
success of the lawsuit hinges on whether the guards actually deterred anyone 
from voting. 
</P>
<P>
"If true, it was an outrage," Letts said of the lawsuit's allegations that the 
guards interfered with voters as they tried to cast ballots. 
</P>
<P>
Later, responding to a suggestion by attorney David A. Robinson that the 
plaintiffs could not prove that even one voter did not cast a ballot because of 
the guards, Letts said: "Yeah, but I think that's irrelevant." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. citizens have a right to believe that they will not be subjected to 
intrusion on their private rights on the way to the polls, Letts said, "so I 
don't care whether they voted or not." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
3 Latino Groups, Union Excluded 
</P>
<P>
However, in a tentative ruling, Letts refused to allow three Latino groups and 
a labor union to continue as plaintiffs in the case, saying they did not have 
standing to sue. He also left in doubt whether he would allow one of the six 
other individual plaintiffs to remain in the case. 
</P>
<P>
The guards were hired at the suggestion of a political consultant for 
Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove), a defendant in the suit. Pringle won 
the 72nd Assembly District election by fewer than 900 votes after a campaign 
that cost the candidates a total of $1.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas A. Fuentes, the county GOP chairman who is also a defendant in the 
lawsuit, has said that he authorized about $4,000 in party money to hire the 
guards because of rumors that illegal voters were to be bused in to tip the 
election in favor of the Democratic candidate, Christian F. (Rick) Thierbach. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit alleges that the guards, who were carrying signs in Spanish 
admonishing non-citizens not to vote, intimidated first-time Latino voters and 
may have frightened them away from the polls. It asks that the election results 
be overturned. 
</P>
<P>
Letts' decision followed a hearing of 1 hour and 40 minutes in Santa Ana 
federal court in which eight attorneys representing various defendants tried to 
narrow the case. 
</P>
<P>
Letts agreed with the defendants that much remains to be proven in the suit. He 
also said he expects that the case will be on a "fast track" -- an indication 
that much might be decided in pretrial motions rather than in lengthy 
litigation. 
</P>
<P>
But he added: "As it sits, based on the allegations, somebody's made a serious 
mistake. Somebody thought this was an OK thing to do in what appeared to be a 
hotly contested race. It wasn't an OK thing to have done." 
</P>
<P>
Letts indicated that to make their case, the plaintiffs would probably need to 
prove only that the guards actually interfered in some manner with voters. 
</P>
<P>
He left open the question of whether he would allow one of the plaintiffs, Jose 
Diaz Vargas, to remain in the suit, even though his polling place was not one 
of those where guards were posted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Delay in Casting Ballot 
</P>
<P>
Kathleen J. Purcell, the San Francisco lawyer who is representing the 
plaintiffs, said Vargas put off voting because he had heard on the radio that 
there were guards at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
Vargas therefore was affected by the use of the guards, even though he did not 
actually encounter a guard on his way to vote, she argued. 
</P>
<P>
Purcell said after the hearing that the groups eliminated as plaintiffs -- the 
Hispanic Political Council; the Laborers' International Union of North America, 
Local 652; the League of United Latin American Citizens, and the Latino Issues 
Forum -- would continue to support the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
She said that overall she is pleased with the tentative ruling because it 
"indicates that the judge understands the fact that the guards should not have 
been there." 
</P>
<P>
Darryl R. Wold, attorney for Fuentes and several other defendants, said after 
the hearing that he is pleased that half of the plaintiffs were refused 
standing to sue. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is whether the defendants' poll watchers did the things that 
the complaint alleges they did," Wold said. "We vigorously deny that they did 
those things."

FRAGILE, POWERFUL SYMBOL;

<P>
MURAL DEAR TO UCI MINORITIES, FOREIGN STUDENTS COULD BE DESTROYED IN MOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN DAVIDSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The mural fills an entire wall in the trailer that houses the Cross-Cultural 
Center, a student union of sorts for minority and foreign students at UC 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Anywhere else, this 17-foot-long montage of folk figures and prominent black, 
American Indian and Latino leaders would be powerful. In these cramped 
quarters, at a university struggling to recruit and retain minority students 
and staff, it has become an important symbol. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first came to the Cross-Cultural Center, I felt an affinity that made 
this building more like a home," said Luis Chavez, president of MECHA, a Latino 
student group. "I identified with this mural because it traces my historical 
roots." 
</P>
<P>
The fragile work is now threatened because the Cross-Cultural Center will move 
later this month, and no one realized until recently that the wood-framed 
canvas won't fit through the doors at either end. 
</P>
<P>
"If it were destroyed," said Chavez, "I would almost feel like a part of me 
would be destroyed, too." 
</P>
<P>
The "Cross," as the center is called on campus, will move from the trailer that 
has been its temporary home since 1972 to its own building, a 3,400-square-foot 
headquarters prominently placed across from Administration Hall. The new Cross 
is to be the centerpiece of UCI's outreach to minorities, a visible response to 
criticism about black, Latino and American Indian enrollment that totaled just 
1,422 of 13,032 undergraduates last fall. 
</P>
<P>
The mural, likewise, is to be the centerpiece of the new headquarters. The 
foyer wall, where it is supposed to be mounted, was designed to match the mural 
measurements. 
</P>
<P>
To relocate the artwork, which was painted inside the trailer, students and 
university officials have concluded that it must be removed from its wood frame 
and rolled like a carpet. But the paint has become brittle, and art consultants 
who have examined the piece predict that it will crumble where it has been 
attached to crossbars on the frame. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the warnings, student board members of the Cross voted Monday to 
attempt to move the mural rather than to reproduce it at the new headquarters 
or commission another work. 
</P>
<P>
"Every effort should be made to save it," said LaQuetta Bush, a Cross member 
and officer of the Black Student Union. "We need something to remind us where 
we came from and the energy it took to get us here. It means a lot to all of 
us." 
</P>
<P>
Horace Mitchell, vice chancellor for student affairs, said he will support the 
students' decision. "The mural is very significant -- it has been important to 
the students for a long time," he said. "The issue is whether it can survive." 
</P>
<P>
Its value is mostly sentimental, but the possibility that the artwork might be 
lost has united minority students in what Mitchell called "a referendum on the 
university's commitment (to minorities)." 
</P>
<P>
The mural, painted in 1980-81 by student artist Al Vasquez and several 
volunteers, was the product of brainstorming sessions between black, Latino, 
Asian and Indian students. It depicts United Farm Workers President Caesar 
Chavez shoulder-to-shoulder with slain black leader Malcolm X and Sitting Bull, 
the Sioux chief. Folk figures of Indians planting maize and Chinese workers 
laying railroad track lead viewers to the center, where four arms in black, 
white, brown and yellow are clasped together. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Wilson, campus ombudsman, traces its importance to the tenuous foothold 
that blacks, Latinos and other minorities feel at UCI. 
</P>
<P>
"The Cross and the mural have become intertwined with what students feel is 
their identity," Wilson said. "Just as minority enrollment is an issue on 
campus now, this was an effort of the time to put forth in bold, bright colors 
(minorities') love for their cultural ancestry and heritage. 
</P>
<P>
"They may feel a lack of control . . . here on campus," he said. "One way they 
can have control is in the way they wish to be represented." 
</P>
<P>
No moving day has been set for the mural, which will be one of the last items 
transported to the new center. University staff members will help to take it 
down, but Cross members will be responsible for remounting the work, said Marc 
Tuchman, director of the University Center. Tuchman and Cross staff director 
Laurie White will coordinate the move. 
</P>
<P>
The students accept the risk that the mural might be ruined in the effort, 
Felicia Lee, chairman of the Cross student board, said. 
</P>
<P>
"If it falls apart, then we will save the pieces that can be saved," Lee said. 
"We'll mount the pieces in the new Cross."

A driver in Sunset Beach was arrested after 100 pounds of marijuana was found 
in the trunk of his car, California Highway Patrol officers said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
John W. Robinson II, 33, a regular patron of the Best Western Sunset Beach Inn 
in Sunset Beach, had a minor accident Friday night in which his rented 1988 
Bonneville struck another vehicle on Pacific Coast Highway, CHP Traffic Officer 
Richard Hoffpauer said. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson returned to the motel, where an acquaintance noticed that he appeared 
drunk and took Robinson's car keys from him. When Robinson asked to get 
something from his trunk, the acquaintance saw the marijuana and notified 
police.

$500 REWARD OFFERED FOR LOST POLICE DOG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Orange County Police Canine Assn. has offered a $500 reward for the return 
of a German shepherd that ran away from the Santa Ana police canine unit Monday 
after strong winds blew open a wooden gate at its handler's Westminster home. 
</P>
<P>
Vasko, a 5-year-old, male German shepherd, disappeared from the home of Officer 
Mike Fleet, near Springdale Drive and the San Diego Freeway, between midnight 
and 5 a.m., Santa Ana police spokeswoman Maureen Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
Fleet's family dog, a 6-month-old, black and white Alaskan malamute named 
Nakita, also ran away. Vasko, described as "very friendly," has an 
identification number, GH2999, tattooed inside his right ear. 
</P>
<P>
Vasko is used primarily in crime scene searches and searches for narcotics and 
missing persons, Thomas said. The dog also is used in demonstrations at Orange 
County schools. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said Vasko obeys commands in both German and English and does not have a 
collar.

ACLU STYMIED BY ORDER IN PROSTITUTION LAWSUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The American Civil Liberties Union on Monday effectively lost its chance to 
intervene on behalf of more than 100 Harbor Boulevard prostitutes who have been 
targeted by the city in an unusual public-nuisance lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
While Superior Court Judge William F. McDonald granted the ACLU's request to 
appear at a Wednesday hearing as a "friend of the court," he also required that 
the organization first give individual notice to each defendant. 
</P>
<P>
Practical and financial realities will almost certainly prevent the ACLU from 
doing that in time for the hearing, said Rebecca Jurado, a lawyer for the ACLU 
Foundation of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The 116 suspects, arrested by Santa Ana police in what has been a monthlong 
roundup, will thus probably be without a unified defense, Jurado said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials, spurred by complaints from Harbor Boulevard residents, have 
sought to bar women suspected of continued prostitution from the street 
altogether as public nuisances. 
</P>
<P>
City attorneys will ask McDonald to order that prohibition Wednesday. Civil 
libertarians, led by the ACLU, have objected to the ban as unconstitutional.

CHILDREN RETURNED TO U.S.; 
</P>
<P>
SANTA ANA POLICEMAN ACCUSED IN ABDUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A 30-year-old Santa Ana police officer, accused of abducting his two children 
from his estranged wife's home after visiting them in northeastern England on 
Thursday, is back in the United States, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Malcolm Lowery has contacted British police and told them that he and his 
children, Sarah Jane, 8, and David Anthony, 7, are back in America and in good 
health, according to Inspector Edward Hill of the Newcastle upon Tyne Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
The children were allegedly taken from the home of their mother, Barbara 
Lowery, 30, at about 8:30 p.m. Thursday, Hill said. "She left the room, went to 
the bathroom, and while she was there he took the children (away) in a car." 
</P>
<P>
Officials on both sides of the Atlantic do not know how Lowery evaded an 
all-points bulletin. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Lowery nor his estranged wife could be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana Police Department spokeswoman Maureen Thomas said Lowery telephoned 
the department Monday. "He's obtained legal counsel, and he's going to be in 
contact with British authorities to resolve the custody situation," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Lowery, who was hired in October, 1987, has been on vacation and is scheduled 
to return to patrol duty next week, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
"Upon his return, his supervisors will discuss the issue and evaluate his 
conduct," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, the only thing we can say is that British authorities have 
contacted us and said they do not intend to file any criminal charges against 
Officer Lowery," she said. "They feel it's a domestic issue and not a criminal 
issue." 
</P>
<P>
Hill said Barbara Lowery "intends to take legal action to have the children 
returned." 
</P>
<P>
The Lowerys came to the United States from Britain in 1985, he said, adding 
that Barbara Lowery and the children returned home in 1987 because "she didn't 
like America."

LUNCEFORD'S HELPING FOOT BOOSTS TRABUCO HILLS SOCCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA CARTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The leading scorer for Trabuco Hills High School girls' soccer team is a dead 
ringer for Linda Lunceford, who led Esperanza to the 3-A finals last year. 
</P>
<P>
That's because it is Lunceford. 
</P>
<P>
Her family moved from Anaheim to Rancho Santa Margarita because her mother, a 
Methodist minister, was assigned to open a church in the area. 
</P>
<P>
It was as if Lunceford, a junior, had gone from the Space Age to the Stone Age. 
Esperanza is 8-0 in Empire League play and has clinched the league title. 
Trabuco Hills, which was dismal last year, is 3-3 in Pacific Coast League play 
and struggling to make the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Though mediocre by Esperanza's standard, Trabuco Hills' record is a definite 
improvement over last season. It is due in part to first-year coach Tony 
Cornfoot and Lunceford. 
</P>
<P>
Lunceford, The Times' athlete of the week, leads the Mustangs in scoring with 
29 goals in 15 games. Last Thursday, she scored four goals in a 5-0 victory 
over Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"She will always score goals because she has a natural instinct to be in the 
right place at the right time," Cornfoot said. 
</P>
<P>
Cornfoot, who coached soccer professionally in England, said Lunceford is one 
of the best girls he has seen and is so powerful that she can strike a ball as 
well as any boy. 
</P>
<P>
As a coach in England, he has seen some good ones. "The English ladies won the 
World Cup in Italy last year, and she could fit into the ladies' English soccer 
team with no problems," Cornfoot said. 
</P>
<P>
Making the transition from Esperanza has been difficult for Lunceford, who was 
an All-Southern Section 3-A soccer team selection as a sophomore. All she has 
known is success. She is an outstanding shortstop for the Ballhawks, the 
third-ranked club softball team in the nation. She also plays for the Shooting 
Stars, the No. 1 club soccer team in California. 
</P>
<P>
"Mainly, I just kept telling myself we'll get better, we'll improve. I just 
felt that I had to work with it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Things have gotten better. The first half of the season, the Mustangs lost to 
Orange, 6-3. Two weeks ago, Trabuco Hills met Orange again. Orange was 4-0 in 
league play. But Trabuco Hills defeated the Panthers, 2-0, on Lunceford's two 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TOP PERFORMERS 
</P>
<P>
Keri Erkenbrack scored 52 points and collected 18 rebounds in two Century 
League victories for Canyon (17-4, 8-0) last week. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin's Teresa Perkins scored 39 points in Sea View League overtime victories 
against Estancia and University last week. She scored the winning basket 
against University. 
</P>
<P>
In a 5-0 victory over Katella, Michelle Rullo scored the hat trick, getting her 
16th, 17th and 18th goals for Esperanza, the No. 2-ranked girls' soccer team in 
4-A.

PIETSCH'S PREDICTION TURNS OUT TO BE A WINNING ONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robbie Pietsch tried to tell everybody that things were going to be different 
on the basketball court this season, but few believed him. 
</P>
<P>
Pietsch, a senior forward for El Modena High School, went around telling his 
friends that the Vanguards were going to win the Century League title. 
</P>
<P>
It was a tough sell. 
</P>
<P>
After all, El Modena was coming off a 10-12 season and a fourth-place finish in 
league play. And then there was the fact that Santa Ana had won four of the 
past five titles, including the last three in a row. 
</P>
<P>
"No one thought we could beat Santa Ana, or Foothill even," Pietsch said. 
"That's all I heard from my friends." 
</P>
<P>
Pietsch, The Times' athlete of the week, has plenty to talk about with his 
friends now. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Vanguards clinched at least a co-championship by beating -- 
that's right -- Santa Ana and Foothill. The victories left El Modena with a 
two-game lead with two games remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Pietsch, for his part, did more than just talk. He had 32 points and 15 
rebounds against Santa Ana and 24 points and 21 rebounds against Foothill. 
</P>
<P>
The title is the Vanguards' first in basketball since 1978 and only the second 
in the school's 22-year history. 
</P>
<P>
"I never had a doubt," Pietsch said. "We had three starters coming back and 
some good players up from the junior varsity." 
</P>
<P>
One of those newcomers, John Darrow, has given Pietsch more freedom on the 
court. 
</P>
<P>
Last season Pietsch, who has a lean 6-foot-4, 170-pound frame, played on the 
inside, where he got pushed around some. He averaged 14 points and eight 
rebounds per game. 
</P>
<P>
"Robbie was a good scorer last season, but he wasn't a very good rebounder," El 
Modena Coach Tim Tivenan said. 
</P>
<P>
This year, with the 6-3, 210-pound Darrow inside, Pietsch is out on the wing -- 
and loving it. 
</P>
<P>
He is averaging 22 points and 12.2 rebounds per game this season. He had 25 
rebounds against Santa Ana Valley this season to break Steve Trumbo's 
single-game school record. 
</P>
<P>
"Playing outside has made me a better rebounder," Pietsch said. "I can get 
better angles to the basket and it's harder to block me out." 
</P>
<P>
Playing outside also allows Pietsch to run the court, which he has done quite 
well this season. 
</P>
<P>
"There was one sequence in the Santa Ana Valley game where he scored on a layup 
on one end, then blocked a shot at the other end, then ran down court and 
scored on a layup," Tivenan said. "He can really cover the court." 
</P>
<P>
And the Vanguards are winning on the court, as promised. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TOP PERFORMERS 
</P>
<P>
Rob Johnson of El Toro had 51 points and 15 assists in two games as the 
Chargers split their two South Coast League games last week. Johnson had 32 
points and 9 assists against Capistrano Valley Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Lee of Newport Harbor scored 32 points in two games, helping the Sailors 
won their first two Sea View League games of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Lira of Rancho Alamitos scored 40 points in two games and the Vaqueros 
moved to within one game of third place in the Garden Grove League. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Luke of El Dorado had 29 points and 38 rebounds as the Golden Hawks won 
two games to clinch a tie for the Empire League championship. 
</P>

Greg (Moose) Pope of Esperanza scored 45 points in two games and the Aztecs won 
their first two Empire League games of the season.

BRIEFCASE: WHEN DELIVERY RATES INCREASE, SO DOES THE INCOME OF MICRO GENERAL;

<P>
Most businesses frown on the idea of higher shipping and mailing costs, but the 
folks over at Micro General Corp. in Irvine smile at such news. 
</P>
<P>
Micro General's business benefits when delivery rates change, as they did 
Monday when general rate increases by United Parcel Service went into effect. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine company makes computerized shipping systems and postal scales for 
use in shipping departments and office mail rooms. Every time a major shipping 
company, such as UPS or the Postal Service, changes its rates, Micro General 
enjoys a windfall. 
</P>
<P>
The reason is this: The heart of every Micro General product is a tiny computer 
chip on which is stored information about shipping company rates. The 
computerized shipping systems enable a company's mail room, for example, to 
comparison shop among different shipping firms to find the least costly way to 
send a package. 
</P>
<P>
Each time there is a rate change, the microchip must be replaced. In the case 
of the UPS increase, most of Micro General's 15,000 customers will have to pay 
the Irvine firm $115 to order the new chip. 
</P>
<P>
The result, Micro General says, will be a 25% windfall in its revenue for the 
current quarter ending in March. A company spokesman, Charles Ramsey, says the 
firm is not forecasting what its total revenue will be for the period. 
</P>
<P>
Micro General had earnings of $202,668 on revenue of $4.4 million for the 9 
months ended last September.

The president and chairman of Standard Logic Inc. has resigned after a dispute 
with company directors over management of the small Anaheim electronics 
manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis A. Wade resigned Jan. 27. His replacement is Wes Baumgardner, a company 
founder and president and chairman from 1967 to 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The company also said it has canceled a letter of intent to merge with U.S. 
Metals &amp; American Welding Supply, a metal manufacturer in Sandy, Ore. "The 
terms they submitted to us were not acceptable," Baumgardner said. He said 
Standard Logic will continue to seek other merger candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Baumgardner said the differences between Wade and the board coincided with a 
worsening financial picture in November. The company expects to report a loss 
of more than $1 million on revenue of $2.4 million for its fiscal year ended 
Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
Baumgardner said the firm is "reevaluating its assets" after a sharp decline in 
sales and new orders in the first quarter ended Jan. 31. Revenue declined 56% 
to $232,000, from $534,000 a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
He said the company has "redirected" its marketing program and hopes to return 
to profitability within 3 months. 
</P>
<P>
Standard Logic, which employed 130 people and had sales of more than $8 million 
in the 1974-75 period, currently has only 13 employees.

FROM $169,277 TO $211,402 IN 1987-88, REALTORS SAY; 
</P>
<P>
MEDIAN RESALE COUNTY HOUSE COST RISES 24.9% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It will not surprise many Orange County residents to learn that prices of 
resale houses in the county rose faster last year than in any other urban area 
in the state. 
</P>
<P>
On a year-to-year basis, the median price of such houses rose 24.9% last year, 
the California Assn. of Realtors said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The median price was $169,277 for 1987 and $211,402 for 1988. That was also the 
highest price of any urban area in California, which saw an 18.4% increase in 
prices of such houses, to a median of $165,602. The figures do not include 
condominiums or new houses. 
</P>
<P>
The number of houses sold in the county ranked just ninth among the 12 regions 
surveyed by the association, but demand was so great for homes that it pushed 
prices through the roof. 
</P>
<P>
The association said it expects the market to cool slightly this year and 
prices to rise more slowly. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, affording a home became a problem for more county residents during 
the year, the association said. 
</P>
<P>
Just 20% of the county's families could afford a median-priced, existing house 
last year, which the association calculated would require monthly payments of 
$1,642. 
</P>
<P>
It would take an annual household income of $65,672 to make those payments, 
according to the association. 
</P>
<P>
Those figures compare with 26% of statewide households that can afford such 
houses. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, 29% of the county's families could afford the median-priced existing 
house.

BANKRUPTCY

Three creditors of Heidi's Frogen Yozurt Shoppes Inc. filed papers in federal 
court Monday seeking to put the troubled dessert chain into involuntary 
bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
The creditors claim that they are owed a total of more than $106,075. They are: 
Southwest Traders Inc., a Temecula distributor that says it is owed $51,634 for 
yogurt, toppings and juices that it delivered; the Paper Co. of Anaheim, which 
says it is owed $18,655 for bags, cups and other paper supplies, and Superior 
Electrical Advertising Inc. of Long Beach, which seeks $35,786 for Heidi's 
signs. 
</P>
<P>
The creditors all contend that they were never paid for merchandise and 
services provided to Laguna Hills-based Heidi's or to its handful of 
company-owned stores. 
</P>
<P>
"I truly believe if we sat by and did nothing, we were guaranteed to get 
nothing," said Ken Smith, owner and president of Southwest Traders. 
</P>
<P>
The bankruptcy petition, filed in Santa Ana under Chapter 7 of the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Code, means that Heidi's has 20 days to tell the court whether it is 
generally paying its debts as they come due. 
</P>
<P>
If Heidi's denies that it is delinquent, the court will set a hearing date and 
listen to evidence on that issue, explained William Lobel, a bankruptcy expert 
with Irvine's Lobel, Winthrop &amp; Broker. Lobel, who is not connected with 
the case, said a judge would then decide whether or not Heidi's is regularly 
paying its debts. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the outcome of the hearing, Lobel said, Heidi's has the right to 
convert to a Chapter 11, which provides protection from creditors while it 
reorganizes. 
</P>
<P>
Under a Chapter 7 filing, the company stops doing business and its assets are 
liquidated. Under a Chapter 11 reorganization, Heidi's continues to operate the 
business and can propose a plan to pay its creditors over time. That means the 
company could come out of bankruptcy and eventually become healthy. 
</P>
<P>
But the involuntary petition could complicate the pending sale of Heidi's to 
Steve's Homemade Ice Cream of New York. Steve's has agreed to purchase the 86% 
of Heidi's that is owned by Miller and Executive Vice President Brian Pallas. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Miller nor Pallas could be reached for comment on the bankruptcy 
petition. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Monday, Gary Stevens, Steve's vice chairman of the board, said 
he does not believe that the involuntary bankruptcy petition will prevent the 
sale, which he expects to close "within the next 2 to 3 days." 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I'm concerned, we'll move to have (the bankruptcy petition) removed 
or settle with those creditors very quickly. . . . The company is not 
insolvent, and I don't think there's a basis" for the petition. 
</P>
<P>
One possible risk of Steve's buying Heidi's now is that the bankruptcy court 
eventually could set the sale aside if the judge decides that Steve's did not 
pay enough.

The Times erroneously reported Saturday that John Cassavetes' publicist, Esme

Cassavetes' comment actually came from an Associated Press report.

FAIRFAX STORES EMPTIED IN METHANE LEAK

About 50 commercial buildings in the Fairfax district were evacuated early 
today after potentially explosive levels of methane gas were detected on a 
sidewalk and in the basements of two stores, one of which was shattered by a 
gas explosion in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities expected the evacuation to last all day. To prevent a dangerous 
buildup of gas, firefighters planned to pump ground water from beneath the area 
into the sewer system. Removing the water, officials said, would relieve 
pressure on the gas, which is naturally produced by rotting organic material in 
old oil fields underlying the area. 
</P>
<P>
Workers at a K Mart and Ross Dress for Less Store in a Third Street shopping 
center across from the Farmers Market reported the gas seepage at 6:12 this 
morning. Dangerous levels of methane also were found on the sidewalk in front 
of the Gilmore Bank, as well as in the shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
Several blocks of Third Street between Fairfax Avenue and Gardner Street were 
immediately blocked off. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities attributed the gas threat to the same forces that caused the 1985 
explosion, which injured 21 people. Subterranean methane gas still seeps to the 
surface, where it is trapped by buildings and streets. 
</P>
<P>
"The gas is always looking for a way out of the ground," said Assistant Fire 
Chief Jim Young. The recent rain has compounded the problem by saturating the 
ground and leaving less space for the gas. 
</P>
<P>
"The percolation is quite forceful," said Vince Marzo, another Fire Department 
spokesman. "We'd probably be looking at angels with harps" if a match were 
struck near the area, Marzo said. 
</P>
<P>
After the 1985 blast in the Ross Dress for Less Store in the Parklabrea 
Shopping Center, gas vents were installed beneath the parking lot and in Ross's 
basement. The city has also since required the installation of gas detection 
devices in residential basements and directed commercial building owners to 
meet new ventilation standards in their basements or to install gas detection 
equipment.

L.A. OVERRIDES GUN LOBBY, ADOPTS BAN ON SEMI-AUTOMATIC WEAPONS

Over the loud objections of gun owners, the City of Los Angeles enacted a 
sweeping ban on the sale and possession of semi-automatic weapons that have 
become increasingly popular with gang members. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley signed the ordinance about an hour after a unanimous City 
Council voted for the two-pronged assault on the military-style weapons. Under 
the ordinance owners of the rapid-firing rifles will have 15 days to render 
them inoperable or turn them over to police for their destruction. Sales of the 
weapons are outlawed immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Gun shop owners and members of the National Rifle Assn., who booed the council 
during its debate, vowed to fight the new ordinance in the courts. They said 
that criminals will not turn in the assault guns, leaving law-abiding citizens 
vulnerable to attack.

Japan's stock-profiteering scandal claimed yet another prominent casualty today 
as the chief of an opposition party resigned over his lucrative dealings with 
the company at the heart of the affair. 
</P>
<P>
Saburo Tsukamoto, 61, chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party, stepped down 
amid pressure from party members who want to distance the party from the 
scandal involving the Recruit group of companies. He said he was not guilty of 
any wrongdoing but was quitting for the party's sake. Three Cabinet members 
have resigned because of links to the affair, as have more than a dozen other 
government officials, business leaders and media executives.

Fifteen people were killed and 26 injured when a city bus overturned on a 
winding stretch of road and plunged down a 60-foot cliff, authorities said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred Monday about four miles from downtown on a curved, steep 
portion of road near the Valle Verde neighborhood on the outskirts of this Baja 
California resort, Fire Department officials said. A spokesman for the 
department said bus driver Enrique Hernandez de Jesus apparently lost control 
of the vehicle while trying to negotiate the curve. One surviving passenger 
told investigators that the bus driver said, "Hang on tight, I have no brakes," 
moments before the bus slid over the cliff.

Air cargo has been banned from all domestic flights in and out of Tokyo's two 
airports for five days around the Feb. 24 funeral of Emperor Hirohito to 
prevent sabotage, transport officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
Transport Ministry officials said airlines and cargo companies were told only 
emergency items such as medicine would be exempt from the ban, set to begin on 
Feb. 22. "We have made the decision in view of the rush of international VIPs 
visiting for the funeral and to guard against bombs or explosive devices which 
may be concealed in air cargo by extremists," a ministry official said.

Former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul A. Volcker today gave a general 
endorsement to the Bush Administration's effort to rescue the savings and loan 
industry, as members of Congress said they intend to act on a bailout package 
as quickly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Volcker, testifying before the Senate Banking Committee, said that while he had 
not had a chance to review the Bush proposal in detail he believed that it 
addressed all of the major problems facing the S&amp;L industry. 
</P>
<P>
"I welcome the Administration's initiative this early in the (congressional) 
session," Volcker said. "The President's program provides a very good base for 
your consideration of legislation." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Competitive Danger 
</P>
<P>
Volcker said he was concerned that the deposit insurance premiums on savings 
and loans and the nation's commercial 13,000 banks not be raised so high that 
it put the institutions at a competitive disadvantage with other financial 
entities. 
</P>
<P>
"My sense is that the increased insurance premiums goes to the edge of 
viability in terms of not undermining the health of the financial industry, 
which is under heavy competition," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Volcker also said he disagreed with the Administration's proposal to abolish 
the Federal Home Loan Bank Board as an independent regulatory agency. President 
Bush's plan would retain only the chairman of the bank board, making him the 
head of an S&amp;L regulatory agency that would be placed under the 
jurisdiction of the Treasury Department. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Would Keep Bank Board 
</P>
<P>
Volcker said that instead of abolishing the three-member bank board he would 
prefer leaving it as an independent regulatory agency but split off its 
oversight of the S&amp;L deposit insurance fund. 
</P>
<P>
Committee Chairman Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.) said he and Sen. Jake Garn of 
Utah, the panel's ranking Republican, plan to introduce the Administration's 
package as soon as it is submitted and schedule early hearings in an effort to 
vote the measure out in as short a time as possible. 
</P>
<P>
"I am determined to see us act quickly in the committee to match the speed of 
the Administration," Riegle said at the beginning of the hearing. Both Riegle 
and Garn called on the other committee members to set aside partisan 
differences and work with dispatch to report a bill to the full Senate. 
</P>
<P>
"This problem is serious enough that we don't have time to be partisan about 
it," Garn said. "I hope we can get together in the next few months to pass 
legislation."

A proposal to make Little Richard's "Tutti Frutti" the state's official rock

</P>
<P>
Rep. Billy Randall (D-Macon) introduced the measure, saying it was intended to 
give some overdue recognition to "Little Richard" Penniman, a Macon native 
whose style was copied by many of the rock stars of the early 1960s, including 
the Beatles. "Tutti Frutti," Little Richard's first big hit, reached No. 2 on 
the rhythm and blues chart in 1955 and later achieved classic status as a rock 
standard. Among its lyrics is the memorable: "Wop bop a loo bop a wop bam 
boom."

A missing Santa Ana police dog was found this morning about two miles from its

</P>
<P>
CHP Officer Janice Campbell found Vasko, a 5-year-old German shepherd, about 7 
a.m. in the ice plant along the northbound Garden Grove Freeway at the Valley 
View Street off-ramp in Westminster. The dog was unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
Vasko escaped early Monday when strong winds blew open a wooden gate at the 
Westminster home of his handler, Officer Mike Fleet. 
</P>
<P>
"He's just ecstatic, to say the least," Santa Ana Police spokeswoman Maureen 
Thomas said of Fleet's reaction. 
</P>
<P>
Fleet's family dog, a 6-month-old female Malamute puppy named Nakita, ran away 
with Vasko and has not been found.

Trump said he would keep no profits from sales of the board game. 
</P>
<P>
"From the Trump standpoint, all of the profits we make will go toward 
charities," said Trump, standing in front of a 10-foot tall replica of a Trump 
The Game box during a news conference in the pink marble atrium of Trump Tower 
in Manhattan.

Milton Bradley executives and Trump declined to detail fee or royalty 
agreements associated with the deal. 
</P>
<P>
"I am acting as an agent for charities," said Trump, who listed organizations 
for multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy, AIDS and the homeless as among those 
that would receive his share of profits from the game. 
</P>
<P>
Milton Bradley, a division of Pawtucket, R.I.-based Hasbro Inc., is promoting 
the game with a 30-second TV commercial featuring Trump and believes the 
product "will be the game of the '90s," said George Ditomassi, president of 
Milton Bradley.

U.S. URGED TO INVEST AT HOME TO CUT DEFICITS

The United States needs to boost its rate of savings and businesses must plow 
more money into plants and equipment if the nation hopes to slash its external 
deficits, economists say. 
</P>
<P>
Progress appears stalled in Washington's battle to reduce the country's trade 
gap and current account deficit, which measure U.S. demand for imports against 
foreign demand for American products. 
</P>
<P>
While the dollar has declined more than 50% in the past three years, making 
U.S. exports more competitive, the currency decline by itself has not reversed 
the imbalances. 
</P>
<P>
The United States must make the following basic changes, economists said in 
interviews this week: 
</P>
<P>
Boost government, personal and corporate savings to reduce the dependence on 
foreign borrowing and free up funds for productive investment. 
</P>
<P>
Bolster investment in plants and equipment to raise productivity, making 
American goods more competitive by lowering costs. 
</P>
<P>
Increase research and development and create new, higher-quality products. 
</P>
<P>
Find new markets for U.S. exports to make up for the loss of demand from Latin 
America, which is burdened by debt, and from the 13 members of the Organization 
of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which are pressured by low oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Group of Seven industrial nations voiced hopes of reducing global 
trade imbalances at its meeting in Washington Friday, economists are not as 
optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to cut the massive U.S. trade deficit, which makes up most of the 
broader current account gap, will be tough, they said. 
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit measures imports against exports, while the current account 
includes "invisible goods" such as shipping, tourism and banking. The 1988 U.S. 
trade deficit was $126 billion through November, while the current account 
shortfall was $135 billion through the 1988 third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Servicing external debt limits the resources the United States has available 
for productive ventures such as factories and thus weighs on present and future 
living standards, economists said. Rising trade deficits increase the country's 
dependence on foreigners, as they are financed by an inflow of capital from 
abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Growing dependence on foreign borrowing is keeping U.S. interest rates high to 
ensure continued foreign investment, economists said. A halt of these funds, 
for any reason, will send the dollar tumbling and interest rates surging. 
</P>
<P>
Washington also has a political stake in balancing its books regarding foreign 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
"The credibility of the U.S. as a world leader was severely undermined when the 
nation turned into the world's largest debtor country with its currency 
constantly under pressure," said Shafiq Islam of the Council on Foreign 
Relations.

Banks and foreign exchange houses were ordered closed Monday as Argentina's 
government grappled with how to lower interest rates while keeping the currency 
stable. 
</P>
<P>
The Economy Ministry ordered the closings late Sunday night after a week in 
which the austral fell to 17.59 to the dollar on the open market, monthly 
interest rates rose to 17% or more and the Central Bank lost nearly $500 
million in foreign exchange. 
</P>
<P>
The government ordered a 2.5% devaluation in the official value of the austral, 
to 14.41 australs to the dollar, effective today, when the banks and foreign 
exchanges were scheduled to reopen. 
</P>
<P>
Also beginning today, the Central Bank -- which has spent at least $1 billion 
in recent months in an effort to hold down the dollar -- no longer will make 
dollars available on the free market. 
</P>
<P>
The former commercial rate, which was higher and at which the government used 
to sell dollars and make a profit, will be replaced by a special rate equal to 
the official rate plus 25%.

S.C. COACH 'NORMAL' BEFORE FATAL ATTACK, DOCTOR SAYS

South Carolina coach Joe Morrison's vital signs were normal moments before he 
collapsed in a shower after suffering a massive and fatal heart attack, 
according to the doctor who examined the coach. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Robert Peele, an orthopedic consultant for the Gamecock football team, was 
called to examine Morrison by Gamecock trainer Terry Lewis after Morrison had 
trouble cooling down after playing racquetball at Williams-Brice Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"I came over and looked at his heart and checked his blood pressure, and he 
didn't have any complaints of chest pains," Peele said Monday night. "They all 
were normal. 
</P>
<P>
"I went out to a phone to talk it over with his cardiologist," he said. "Before 
I got back, he collapsed." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CPR Administered 
</P>
<P>
Peele said he and Lewis began performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation on 
Morrison, 51, who was rushed to Providence Hospital, where he was pronounced 
dead at 9:03 p.m. on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Peele said he examined Morrison about an hour after the coach finished his 
weekly racquetball games. 
</P>
<P>
"He had no complaints of chest pains," Peele said during a telephone interview. 
"His cardiologist didn't think it was probably significant since he had had 
chest pains in 1985." 
</P>
<P>
Morrison had a history of heart problems and had been hospitalized in the past 
for that condition. He underwent surgery for the removal of a blockage in a 
coronary artery in March, 1985.

The Phoenix Suns have filed a protest with the NBA, claiming that the referees' 
misinterpretation of a rule cost their club in last Saturday night's overtime 
loss here to Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
With Phoenix trailing 118-116, Suns guard Kevin Johnson collided with Hawks 
guard Doc Rivers on a drive to the basket with 10 seconds remaining in 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Referee Ed Rush called a charging foul on Johnson while referee Jim Capers 
called a blocking foul on Rivers. A double-foul was assessed and Phoenix 
retained possession of the ball. Instead of calling a jump ball at center 
court, however, referees instructed Phoenix to inbound the ball, and Johnson's 
desperation jumper at the buzzer bounced off the front of the rim on the final 
play. 
</P>
<P>
The Suns, in their protest Monday, said that the double-foul rule was 
misinterpreted by the referees and that there should have been a jump ball. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix officials said NBA Commissioner David Stern should make a ruling on the 
protest within five days of receiving the letter.

YUGOSLAV OVERTAKES MCKINNEY TO CAPTURE GOLD

Yugoslavia's Mateja Svet overcame a small first-run deficit and captured the 
gold medal in women's slalom today at the World Alpine Ski Championships. 
</P>
<P>
Svet, just four-hundredths of a second behind American Tamara McKinney after 
the first run, was considerably faster than McKinney on the second run. 
</P>
<P>
Svet finished with a combined time of 1:30.88, holding off Swiss ace Vreni 
Schneider, who had a blistering second run to move from eighth to second place 
at 1:31.49. 
</P>
<P>
McKinney, gold medalist in the combined last week, settled for the bronze in 
the slalom at 1:31.56. 
</P>
<P>
Unofficially, Blanca Fernandez-Ochoa of Spain was fourth in 1:31.75, and Ingrid 
Salvenmoser of Austria took fifth in 1:32.57. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Insurmountable Lead 
</P>
<P>
Svet, silver medalist behind Schneider in the 1988 Olympic slalom, had built 
what proved to be an insurmountable lead over Schneider in the opening heat. 
</P>
<P>
McKinney, taking advantage of a first-run course set by U.S. coach Martin 
Rufener, led the way at 43.98 seconds. Svet was clocked in 44.02. The heavily 
favored Schneider, who has won all five slaloms on the World Cup circuit this 
season, finished a disappointing eighth, 1.47 seconds off McKinney's lead. 
</P>
<P>
Schneider cracked a 46.04 in her second run -- more than seven-tenths of a 
second faster than anyone else -- on a course set by a Swedish coach. 
</P>
<P>
Svet, 20, had a mistake-free run of 46.86 to stay in front, and when McKinney 
could manage no better than 47.58, Svet got the gold. 
</P>
<P>
It was her fourth medal in World Championship competition. She won three medals 
-- one silver and two bronze -- at the last World Championships in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Five skiers in the first seed of 15 -- Austria's Anita Wachter, Swiss teammates 
Brigitte Oertli and Christine von Gruenigen, France's Patricia Chauvet and 
Yugoslavia's Veronika Sarec -- missed gates or fell and did not complete their 
first runs. 
</P>
<P>
Among those bowing out in the second run were Ulrike Maier of Austria and 
Brigitte Gadient of Switzerland.
