DANCE PROGRAM GIVES CHILDREN A CHANCE TO GAIN IN SELF-ESTEEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Hearts pounding, the 12-year-old twin girls clutched each other's hands. Dark, 
almond-shaped eyes danced with excitement. In their black leotards and white 
tights they looked like a double-exposed negative. A knot of tension gripped 
their stomachs. They had been waiting for this moment for two hours -- and so 
had 110 other hopeful children. 
</P>
<P>
A young woman approached the cluster of children and adults in the gymnasium. 
She started calling numbers from a list. The twins held their breath. As both 
their numbers were called they squealed with delight and hugged each other. 
Then they turned and hugged their instructor and mentor, Sister Beth Burns. 
</P>
<P>
The twins, along with two other members of the St. Joseph Ballet Company in 
Santa Ana had been chosen to dance with the Joffrey Ballet in their Los Angeles 
performance of the Nutcracker Suite. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to cry I was so excited," said one effervescent twin, Xochilt Garcia. 
"But I'm a big girl now, so I held back." 
</P>
<P>
Zuly, the more meditative of the two, stated simply, "It was the most exciting 
thing that has ever happened to me." 
</P>
<P>
The St. Joseph Ballet Company is made up of dancers ages 9 to 19, two-thirds of 
whom are Latino, and 90% of whom are from low-income families. The group 
searches for and trains young people who could not otherwise afford to dance. 
Such is the case of Zuly and Xochilt Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
The twins immigrated with their mother and older sister to the United States 
from Guatemala seven years ago. Magdalena, a single parent, supports the family 
as a hairdresser. Her income covers the bare necessities of the family, but 
there is no extra money for such extravagances as dance lessons. 
</P>
<P>
For $10 a month, which is waived if a family cannot afford it, members of the 
St. Joseph group receive dance costumes and instruction by Sister Beth in 
classical ballet and jazz. 
</P>
<P>
Tryouts for the troupe are held twice a year. "To be accepted, all you have to 
do is show a little coordination and a lot of desire," Sister Beth said. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the problems of these inner-city children is they see no future for 
themselves. They see a vicious circle where there is no escape for them. 
</P>
<P>
"Our dance program allows these children the opportunity to grow in 
self-esteem, self-discipline, and to strive for achievement through the 
intensive training and performance schedule." 
</P>
<P>
"When I tried out," Zuly confided shyly, "I was really scared. . . . My sister 
and I are only 4-foot-5 tall and we are teased all the time about being so 
tiny. I'd learned many defenses to keep my feelings from being hurt. But as I 
began to dance," Zuly said, "a feeling of freedom came over me. I felt big not 
only in size, but in my heart. My defenses soon melted away. 
</P>
<P>
"Girls in the company started to talk with me. I learned that making friends 
can be easy. You don't have to brag and try to impress people, you just open up 
your heart!" 
</P>
<P>
The St. Joseph Ballet Company not only affects the hearts of its dancers, but 
also its audiences. In her choreography, Sister Beth uses themes that address 
problems facing young people, especially inner-city children, on a daily basis. 
</P>
<P>
The dance "Street Games" examines the dynamics of gang hostility and its tragic 
consequences. It tells of a gang worker who tries to break up a fight caused by 
one gang member writing graffiti in a rival group's territory. The gang worker 
is killed trying to unite the warring gangs. Members of both gangs are so 
shocked by his death that they develop an emotional unity. The audience is left 
to reflect on one person's ultimate sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
Sister Beth, 31, has been the guiding light of the ballet company since its 
inception in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The vivacious nun came from a family of four girls and has had a lifelong 
involvement in dance. She said she had no desire to become a nun until she 
entered Loyola-Marymount University. While there, friends talked her into 
attending services each night before dinner. That led to prayer and Bible 
Study. Finally, one day she became inspired: 
</P>
<P>
"I felt the presence of God. God became the center of my life rather than a 
mystery on the edge. I took my vows after graduating. I worked as a 
teacher/counselor at a few inner-city schools, but I felt a calling to do more. 
</P>
<P>
"Since dance was my medium, I decided to start a dance program and received a 
grant from the Ahmanson Foundation for a five-week trial. The results were so 
marked we've continued until today." 
</P>
<P>
George de la Pena, former American Ballet Theater soloist and star of the movie 
"Nijinsky," was asked by the California Arts Council to judge a performance by 
the troupe when the company applied for a grant. 
</P>
<P>
"The performance blew me away," De la Pena said. "I was overwhelmed by its 
honesty and the dancers' abilities. In fact, the only thing wrong with the 
performance was I couldn't stop crying long enough to watch the rest of the 
performance!" 
</P>
<P>
Last August, the company was awarded a grant and the highest rating possible by 
the California Arts Council and was the highest-ranking dance company in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Zuly and Xochilt have been with the program for two years. They wish they could 
stay with it forever. 
</P>
<P>
"They love to dance so much," their mother said. "They come home from school 
and two hours of dance practice and practice for hours more in our living room. 
I say 'Children, aren't you tired?' They say, 'Oh no. We love to dance, and we 
must be perfect if we want to be professional ballerinas.' 
</P>
<P>
"When I took them to their first class, I told them that the exercise of dance 
would help them grow. In the last two years they have grown in more ways than 
one, and the best is they are now full of joy!"

WHAT'S LEFT FOR FERNANDO AND THAT LEFT SHOULDER? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the months between the worst summer and the most anxious spring of his 
baseball career, Fernando Valenzuela has had a lot of time for soul-searching. 
</P>
<P>
Time to reflect on a year turned sour by a shoulder that gave out after 255 
consecutive starts for the Los Angeles Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
Time to mourn a father who saw him leave the family's home in Etchohuaquila, 
Mexico, for a shot at fame and fortune in El Norte, and who perhaps never quite 
understood, even at the time of his death from cancer last summer, the 
magnitude of his son's accomplishments on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
And time to wonder whether he will ever recapture the magic that made him the 
toast of this town as a 20-year-old rookie in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Those were the days of Fernandomania, of sellout crowds, of color posters 
snatched by adoring fans as fast as they were printed, and of opposing batters 
shaking their heads after futile attempts at hitting the kid's dazzling 
screwball. 
</P>
<P>
These are the days of uncertainty. As the Dodgers prepare for spring training 
in Vero Beach, the question is not only can the team repeat its world 
championship, but can Valenzuela be a factor in helping them do so. 
</P>
<P>
The Valenzuela of even three years ago can. The one from the last couple of 
seasons would have trouble cracking the starting rotation. 
</P>
<P>
After a marvelous 21-11 season in 1986, with a National League-leading 20 
complete games, Valenzuela managed only to split 28 decisions in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, he went 5-8 with a 4.24 ERA and registered more walks than 
strikeouts for the first time ever. Valenzuela was placed on the disabled list 
last July 31 because of a strained left shoulder. Some baseball people 
speculated that heavy use of the screwball had contributed to the injury. The 
left-hander returned for two brief appearances in September but did not pitch 
in the playoffs or World Series. 
</P>
<P>
Fernando fans are pondering whether Valenzuela's shoulder has given out after 
2,000 innings pitched in the majors and a few hundred more in the minor and 
Mexican leagues, or whether there is any mileage left in it. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody can be certain of that. Valenzuela, however, is optimistic about the 
1989 season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult to know how much the shoulder has improved . . . but it feels 
stronger," said Valenzuela during a recent workout at Dodger Stadium. "I've 
worked on a program set by Pat (Screnar) since the season ended and will 
continue to do so throughout spring training." 
</P>
<P>
Screnar, the Dodger physical therapist, prepared a strengthening program for 
Valenzuela that consists of different exercises with weights. "He has been 
monitored during the off-season and the shoulder is definitely stronger," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to imagine a 28-year-old former Cy Young Award winner as a candidate 
for Comeback Player of the Year, but that's what Valenzuela will be in 1989. At 
least he hopes he will be. And so do a lot of his fans who have admired not 
only Fernando's pitching prowess but also the way he has conducted himself with 
style and dignity.

S.D. CANCELS 1990 AIR SHOW AT BROWN FIELD AFTER AUDIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has canceled the 1990 Air/Space America show at Brown Field, 
citing an auditor's prediction that its organizers would owe creditors nearly 
$5 million even if they staged a successful show next year, city officials said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Bruce Henderson announced the unanimous decision, reached in closed 
session Tuesday, during a Wednesday meeting of the council's Public Facilities 
and Recreation Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Besides revoking Air/Space America's permit to use any city-owned airstrip, the 
council voted to withdraw the $300,000 in hotel tax funds that it was prepared 
to spend on the show, Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Cities Considered 
</P>
<P>
Bill Walsh, president of Air/Space America, expressed disappointment at the 
decision but predicted he will reach agreement within 45 days to stage the show 
in Palmdale, Calif., or Ft. Worth, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed and somewhat shocked by the manner and time in which it 
occurred," Walsh said. "We've been working with the city . . . trying to please 
them and make them happy, because it would obviously be easier to put that '90 
show on in San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
But Henderson made it clear that the council has lost confidence in Air/Space 
America's ability to operate a successful show in 1990. According to two 
separate audits, organizers of the aerial extravaganza and trade show now owe 
creditors more than $4 million. They have yet to pay for an estimated $100,000 
in damage to Brown Field from the May, 1988, show or hand over a $100,000 rent 
payment owed the city. 
</P>
<P>
Organized by former San Diego Congressman Bob Wilson and by Walsh, a retired 
rear admiral, Air/Space America was envisioned as a biennial event designed to 
be America's answer to the Paris air show. The idea attracted support from 
well-known figures such as Sen. Barry Goldwater and former astronaut Wally 
Schirra. 
</P>
<P>
About 200,000 people attended the first Air/Space America show, in 1988, which 
included trade booths, paratroop jumps, aerial acrobatics, $985 rides on the 
supersonic jet Concorde and tours of the Soviet Union's AH-124 transport, the 
world's biggest aircraft. The attendance was about half what Walsh had 
predicted. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a situation where we didn't have confidence in their business 
management, that we would be throwing good money after bad," said Councilman 
Bob Filner, whose district includes Brown Field. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concern About Other Shows 
</P>
<P>
Henderson said the council also became concerned that Air/Space America might 
stage subsequent shows in other cities, causing the council to wonder whether 
its investment would pay off. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Panarisi, director of consulting services for the auditing firm Deloitte, 
Haskins &amp; Sells, which was hired by the city, projected that the 1990 air 
show would lose about $600,000, a figure that would be added to Air/Space 
America's current $4.2-million debt. 
</P>
<P>
"Our projections show that they would not quite break even for the 1990 show, 
and they would not even be able to pay for the debt" from the 1988 show, 
Panarisi said. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh disputed both the calculation of the current debt and the predictions for 
1990, saying his organization owes about $2.9 million to more than 2 dozen 
creditors but would pay that off and end the 1990 show about $400,000 in the 
black. 
</P>
<P>
A city audit of Air/Space America's finances as of Sept. 30 shows that the 
group is $4.45 million in debt, which includes more than $1 million owed to 
Evergreen Chemical Products for applying a polymer to Brown Field soil that was 
designed to take the place of more expensive asphalt. Walsh and city officials 
claim the polymer was a complete failure, and Walsh is refusing to pay the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
At least eight firms have sued Air/Space America in an attempt to recoup 
payments, and nine have asked the city to pay them a total of $1.4 million in 
debts. 
</P>
<P>
A major part of the financial snafu stems from a 1987 City Council decision to 
waive a requirement that Air/Space America obtain a construction bond that 
normally would be used to pay off creditors in the event of financial problems. 
According to Filner, who was not on the council at the time, city staff members 
warned the council about the possibility of financial problems in several 
reports before the decision. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the contractors attended Wednesday's council committee meeting and 
huddled privately with city lawyers afterward in the hope of determining their 
chances of recouping some money. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel that Air/Space America, the city and the contractors are all partners 
in this thing, whether we want to be or not," said Bob Spellman, managing 
partner of Rock Paving and Grading, which claims it is owed more than $49,000. 
</P>
<P>
"They've gotten some debts. The only way those debts can be paid is if they 
have another show, so far as I know," Spellman said. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly nine months after the May air show, Brown Field operators are still 
repairing damage caused by the event, which Mike Tussey, airport operation 
manager, estimated will total $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
More than $8,000 was spent to repair a hole in the main runway that was created 
when the giant Soviet transport made a quick turn and came to a halt, Tussey 
said. Replacing the main road to the control tower, necessitated by the failure 
of the polymer substance to harden into a usable surface, cost nearly $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
Repairing a similar problem involving 41,000 square feet of space leased by the 
Experimental Aircraft Assn. will cost $18,000. And repairs to 70 lights torn 
off one of the taxiways will cost $6,000, Tussey said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Walsh said that Air/Space America hoped to receive a rent credit for 
installing a $550,000 underground drainage system, Filner claimed that the 
system actually increases the chances of flooding. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything they did, in fact, screwed up things more," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides its financial and permit woes, Air/Space America now faces possible 
competition from a Canadian group that hopes to stage an international air show 
near Vancouver in May. 
</P>
<P>
The show, which has secured more than $3 million from the Canadian and British 
Columbian governments, is billed as "North America's Premier Aerospace Trade 
Show and Symposium." 
</P>
<P>
"Airshow Canada is funded by the government to pay for things like promotion 
and marketing," according to show spokesman Mark Pond. "That's the key 
difference between us and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"Funds exist for this show, and there won't be checks bounced. I heard very 
uncomplimentary things about the San Diego Air Show." 
</P>

NEWSMAKERS: GIRL'S WORK ADDS UP FOR SCIENTISTS

While many teen-agers are juggling the complexities of basic algebra and 
Saturday night dates, a 17-year-old British girl is being wooed by Harvard and 
several other universities to lecture and conduct mathematical research on such 
subjects as quantum groups and statistical mechanics. Ruth J. Lawrence, of 
Oxford, England, got her degree from Oxford University at age 13, is working on 
her doctorate and has caught the attention of the world's top mathematicians. 
Her work has taken her to the outer fringes of theoretical physics and 
mathematics, such subjects as knot and string theory and the connections 
between the world of particle physics and mathematics. Ruth's father, Harry, a 
computer consultant, gave his daughter her entire pre-Oxford education at home. 
Of her tender years, Ruth says: "The age thing really does not matter for more 
than the first two seconds . . . . I talk to mathematicians as mathematicians, 
and I think they talk to me in the same way."

 -- Former White House spokesman Malcolm Kilduff, who became a footnote in 
history when he announced the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, has 
resigned as a weekly newspaper editor and says he plans to write a book. 
Kilduff, 60, had worked as editor of the Beattyville, Ky., Enterprise for 7 1/2 
years. He was an assistant White House press secretary and was serving as 
acting press secretary for the first time on a presidential trip when Kennedy 
went on a political fence-mending tour of Texas in November, 1963. After shots 
rang out in Dallas, Kilduff appeared at a hastily arranged hospital press 
conference to tell the world that the President was dead.

 -- At 2 weeks old, Christopher Bollig may be a tad young to appreciate his 
special place in history. He is the seventh link in a living chain of 
generations anchored by the eldest of Wisconsin elders. He has five living 
grandmothers, from his mother's mother, Debra Bollig, 33, of Janesville, Wis., 
to his great-great-great-great-grandmother Augusta Pagel, 109, who has been 
declared Wisconsin's oldest citizen by Gov. Tommy G. Thompson. Christopher's 
other grandmothers are Ella Sabin, 89, of Monroe, Wis.; Anna Wendlandt, 70, of 
Brodhead, Wis., and Betty Wolter, 52, of Orfordville, Wis. Debra Bollig, whose 
15-year-old unmarried daughter Lori is Christopher's mother, conceded: "We 
didn't plan on having a seventh generation this soon." Nevertheless, the family 
has written to the Guinness Book of World Records to see if it can claim the 
world's record for seven living generations. DEBORAH CHRISTENSEN

SHNEOUR ON ABORTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While rightly attacking creationism and other forms of mysticism, Shneour 
hoists himself on his own petard when he declares that "Life never stops. It is 
a continuum . . . ." If he truly believes what he says, then he should be a 
strident anti-abortionist! For if life is truly a continuum, then to interrupt 
it at any point must be murder, since an adult is a continuous part of the 
embryo from which it grows. 
</P>
<P>
Shneour then falls prey to the same line-drawing arguments in his analogies as 
do others in the abortion debate. Perhaps someone who burns a blueprint is not 
an arsonist by strict, conventional definitions, but he has burned something. 
And without that blueprint, the house can never exist to be torched, so isn't 
the unintended consequence of burning the blueprint the same as burning the 
house? Better to argue that the blueprint should never be drawn, which is the 
argument for effective contraception (or abstinence, for up-tight spoilsports). 
</P>
<P>
At what point does such an act become arson? When one burns the requisition 
forms for the supplies? When one ignites the unassembled lumber? When one 
torches the half-assembled frame? And who then is to decide when a house has 
outlived its usefulness and is to be torn down? And is it arson to torch a 
house that was found to be defective after it was built? 
</P>
<P>
Analogies only help if they illuminate a new understanding of a problem. 
Shneour's arson analogy to abortion does nothing to help resolve an intensely 
agonizing dilemma faced by millions of women every year. 
</P>
<P>
I wish him luck, however, for he seems to be on the right continuum. Perhaps if 
he considered only the unmerged sperm and egg to be the blueprints, and the 
embryo to be a tiny bungalow with new additions constantly being made, he might 
gain new insights into arson and abortion.

MAKING IT IN THE INNER CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Big, modern supermarkets are scarce in South-Central Los Angeles. Most major 
grocery chains have written off a large territory of nearly 50 square miles 
between the Santa Monica and Artesia freeways from Crenshaw to Alameda 
boulevards, according to Times staff writer Jube Shiver. As the largest grocery 
chains -- with the lonely exception of Boys Market -- abandon the area, the 
poorest people end up paying the highest prices for food. 
</P>
<P>
It is as difficult to place blame as it is to find answers to the problem that 
do not themselves suggest new questions. 
</P>
<P>
The grocers say that supermarkets are not charities and that grocery stores are 
money-making businesses with thin profit margins. In high-crime areas, profits 
are greatly reduced by security problems and high insurance rates; shoppers and 
employees face constant danger. In older urban areas, profits are further 
reduced by limited floor and shelf space in the older, outmoded, inefficient 
and small stores. 
</P>
<P>
The absence of large, competitive supermarkets is common in the nation's 
inner-city neighborhoods, according to a report, "Obtaining Food: Shopping 
Constraints on the Poor," prepared two years ago for a House select committee 
on hunger. The government can't force stores into every neighborhood, but local 
leaders can coax them. Zoning and tax incentives are under consideration by the 
city council in Washington. Local incentives are a logical approach, but it 
will take more than tax breaks to make shoppers and employees feel safe in 
high-crime areas. 
</P>
<P>
To decrease crime, Boys Market is using fences and guards at two fairly new 
high-security supermarkets in South-Central Los Angeles. The stores, which 
opened at Vermont and Slauson in 1981 and in Watts in 1985, have proved that 
the inner city can be profitable. But not every market chain will go to that 
trouble, and, without competition, there is no way to ensure moderate prices. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter is discussing the problem with a 
number of supermarket representatives. More council members must involve 
themselves, as must the mayor and community leaders. 
</P>
<P>
In any city or neighborhood, markets are more than places to shop. They define 
neighborhoods, add to a sense of vitality, serve as anchors where little else 
seems permanent. In South-Central Los Angeles those contributions may not seem 
as dramatic as other projects in which politicians invest time and energy, but 
they are badly needed.

HOLLYWOOD AS AN EXPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Given the present condition of Hollywood Boulevard, to say nothing of Hollywood 
itself, it may not be surprising that the Disney organization is trying to move 
both to a fresh clearing in the Florida scrub at Lake Buena Vista. The 
reincarnation will open its doors May 1 as Disney's newest theme park: 
Disney-MGM Studios. Its tourist attractions will include a motion-picture 
studio with stunts that Universal Studios never thought of, and the park will 
have its own Hollywood Boulevard, with yet another original Brown Derby 
restaurant and, yes, a replica of Grauman's Chinese Theater -- including 
sidewalk hand prints and autographs. 
</P>
<P>
"Reconstructing the ambiance of 1930s and '40s Los Angeles wasn't easy," 
according to a Disney statement. We can believe that. But the challenges have 
been surmounted, we are assured, with everything to dazzle guests from a 
"California Crazy" building to an ice-cream stand in the shape and scale of a 
real dinosaur. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors will taste Hollywood's Golden Age, a brochure proclaims. Golden Age? 
Curious how the pain of the Depression of the '30s and the war of the '40s 
takes on a different tonality a couple of generations later. That age, as we 
recall it, was not that much more innocent than the contemporary scene. There 
were fewer runaway adolescents among the prostitutes, different drugs, less 
reliable automobiles, not so many homeless, cleaner air. But how on Earth, or 
even in a magic kingdom, is it possible to re-create with any authenticity 
those bittersweet contradictions -- or, for that matter, the real creativity 
and spirit that were also part of Hollywood then? 
</P>
<P>
"Hollywood, it's often said, is as much a state of mind as it is a location," a 
Disney newsletter comments. Well, now we'll see.

SURVIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nicholas Daniloff makes a statement which has challenged me: " . . . The world 
saw more clearly than before that Armenians are deeply emotional and possibly 
paranoid. Like the Jews, they fear extinction" ("A Shock to the Soviet 
Foundation; In Armenian Rubble, Moscow's Ethnic Problems Grow," Editorial Page, 
Jan. 28.). 
</P>
<P>
But isn't that "normal" and shouldn't anyone become deeply emotional and on 
guard when their very existence, their identity is at stake? How else could 
Armenians and Jews have survived despite their tumultuous histories? Why not 
give credit where credit is due and salute those who survive with style?

FUTURE OF KECK TELESCOPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is unfortunate that the headline accompanying your article on the W.M. Keck 
Observatory conveyed a misleading impression of the technical feasibility of 
the project (Science/Medicine, Jan. 30). The principal innovation in the Keck 
Telescope is the use of a primary mirror comprised of 36 hexagonal segments. 
With this approach, it became possible to consider building a telescope with 
four times the mirror area of the 200-inch Hale Telescope at the Palomar 
Observatory. 
</P>
<P>
Judging from the many milestones accomplished to date, the future of the Keck 
Telescope looks bright. Our successes are numerous: At the observatory site, a 
newly completed dome stands ready to receive the telescope. The telescope 
structure is scheduled to be shipped this spring for installation. The support 
systems for the mirror segments are finished. Work on the mirror segments 
recently passed into the manufacturing stage, following a lengthy and 
successful period of developing tools, test equipment, and manufacturing 
procedures suitable for the unique requirements of the segmented-mirror design. 
Even with the delay in mirror development, we expect to begin operations in 
1991, as scheduled, with a telescope that takes optimum advantage of the seeing 
conditions on Mauna Kea in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
The use of a segmented mirror has been made possible by two new technologies 
that have been developed and demonstrated with prototype hardware by J.E. 
Nelson and his colleagues at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories. One of these 
involved the sensors and actuators needed to actively monitor and adjust the 
location of adjacent segments so that together they will form the surface of a 
single mirror 10 meters (400 inches) in diameter. 
</P>
<P>
The other enabling technology is stressed mirror polishing, a process that uses 
the simplicity of spherical polishing techniques to produce the aspherical 
surfaces of the individual segments. 
</P>
<P>
We are confident that the Keck Telescope will contribute to unprecedented 
astronomical discovery. By gathering faint light from the universe's most 
distant regions, the telescope will help us piece together the very early 
history of the universe and so learn how galaxies formed. By bringing us views 
from the interiors of star-forming clouds, it will provide insight into how our 
solar system formed.

SHNEOUR ON ABORTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "Life Doesn't Begin, It Continues," by Elie Shneour, Op-Ed Page, 
Jan. 29: 
</P>
<P>
Shneour's column is replete with faulty argumentation. I want to say that I 
also support a woman's choice to have an abortion in the first trimester, but 
my reasons for my position are, I hope, more compelling than those offered by 
Shneour. 
</P>
<P>
Within his eight paragraphs, he makes three egregious mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
First, he argues that since a spermatozoon and an egg are both living cells, 
then there are millions of abortions for every ejaculation. But no one that I 
know of is going to hold that a spermatozoon or an egg is the beginning of 
human life. And hence a dead spermatozoon does not a human abortion make. The 
spermatozoon and the egg are indeed necessary conditions for human life, but 
only the fertilized egg is a sufficient condition. Or at least this could be 
plausibly argued. 
</P>
<P>
Second, he reasons by analogy that since we would not consider a person who 
burns a blueprint of a house an arsonist, we should not consider the 
destruction of an embryo as being tantamount to murder. He fails to add that an 
embryo is not merely a blueprint; it is also a house under construction. And we 
do consider a person who burns a house under construction an arsonist. This 
analogy could very well be used by anti-abortionists. 
</P>
<P>
Third, he writes that it is uncertain when or if an embryo becomes human, for 
during its evolution it looks like a fish, a reptile, and a bird. If it be the 
case that we are simply aborting fishes, reptiles, and birds, then of course no 
humans are being killed. Is abortion perhaps an animal rights' issue? Should a 
woman see a zoologist for the early months of pregnancy? 
</P>
<P>
Abortion is a very serious issue. There are good minds, and good hearts, on 
both sides. And the problem is much more complex than Elie Shneour thinks it 
is. Much more complex.

SHNEOUR ON ABORTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thank you, Elie Shneour. As the conservative Supreme Court considers the 
Missouri case on abortion, I tremble at the thought of a Roe vs. Wade setback. 
Will the court then listen to a minority faction that insists women and men 
must not "murder" the egg and sperm every month? No birth control, but undue 
procreation in an already overpopulated globe? 
</P>
<P>
It is relatively easy to carry a sign saying "Stop the Murder of Babies" but 
spending time to help the living survive is another matter. 
</P>
<P>
As a schoolteacher, I see students every day who are abused in a home 
environment. This to me is more of a sin than stopping an egg and sperm from 
developing in the first trimester. 
</P>
<P>
The Constitution was written with wisdom so that one religious group could not 
impose its morals on others. So be it!

GUN BAN SPURS SALES OUTSIDE L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA and TRACEY KAPLAN, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several gun dealers in Ventura County reported brisk sales of assault weapons 
Wednesday, the first day after the Los Angeles City Council outlawed the sale 
and possession of the guns. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in Burbank, meanwhile, said they were joining the ranks of California 
municipalities -- San Fernando, Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks among them -- 
considering bans on guns similar to the AK-47 assault rifle that a disturbed 
gunman used to kill five children at a Stockton schoolyard last month. 
</P>
<P>
In snowy Santa Clarita and Fillmore, gun sales Wednesday were not as brisk as 
the weather, which stranded thousands of residents at home. But gun dealers 
there said sales of assault weapons have risen dramatically since lawmakers 
suggested banning the military-style, rapid-firing rifles. 
</P>
<P>
Where the weather was less formidable, some people tried to be first in line at 
gun stores. 
</P>
<P>
"They were lined up at the door this morning waiting for us to open," said 
Steve Cotter, whose wife, Judy, owns Hilldale Gun Sales in Simi Valley. By 
mid-afternoon, he said, the shop had sold about 12 of the weapons, which range 
in price from $320 to $800. 
</P>
<P>
"We have people who otherwise wouldn't be interested coming in here because 
they feel their constitutional rights are being abridged by the ban," Steve 
Cotter said. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles ordinance, passed 12 to 0 by the City Council on Tuesday, 
outlaws the sale and possession of assault rifles such as the AK-47, AR-15 and 
Uzi. The law goes into effect today. 
</P>
<P>
Cotter said he plans to testify when the Simi Valley City Council considers a 
proposal to outlaw the sale of assault weapons. Unlike the Los Angeles 
ordinance, the measure would not ban possession of the guns. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Proposed Ban 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley Councilwoman Ann Rock proposed the ban last month after the 
Stockton slayings. The council is scheduled to consider the matter March 27. 
</P>
<P>
In Burbank, where the City Council outlawed the sale of toy guns resembling 
real weapons 16 months ago, City Atty. Douglas C. Holland said he is drafting 
an anti-gun ordinance that will be modeled after the Los Angeles measure. 
Holland hopes to present the ordinance to the Burbank City Council in two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The Thousand Oaks City Council asked its city attorney Tuesday night to 
research a ban on assault weapons. The San Fernando City Council took similar 
action Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Tolces, owner of Blue Star Arms in Santa Clarita, said the Los Angeles ban 
on the weapons will only encourage people to purchase the guns elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
In Fillmore, gun shop owner Gary Creagle said he has sold more than 50 assault 
rifles since the Stockton massacre Jan. 17. "It's even more amazing when you 
consider that before this, I had only sold two assault rifles since 1972," said 
Creagle, owner of Up in Arms. 
</P>
<P>
"My regular customers are buying them to put in their safes as an investment 
because they figure they can triple their money." 
</P>
<P>
Clarence Raville, owner of Caraville Arms in Thousand Oaks, also said the 
demand for the weapons has skyrocketed. Raville said he has ordered the weapons 
from out-of-state distributors because local dealers have run out. 
</P>
<P>
"This just shows that if people think they can't have something, they want it," 
Raville said. He said he received several calls about the guns Wednesday.

SCHOOL'S OUT, SNOWMEN IN;

<P>
WINTER WONDERLAND DAZZLES SANTA CLARITA

<P>
Santa Clarita turned a day of cold and snow into an impromptu winter festival 
Wednesday, sending children to the slippery slopes and parents to snug 
firesides. 
</P>
<P>
As thick, wet snowflakes the size of nickels drifted out of the sky and freeway 
ties with the outside world were cut, schools shut down and businesses, shops 
and government offices closed. 
</P>
<P>
About six inches of snow fell, the heaviest since a 12-inch storm in 1974, 
Sheriff's Deputy Dick Verner said. 
</P>
<P>
The many residents of the Santa Clarita Valley who commute over the Santa 
Susana Mountains to jobs in the San Fernando Valley and Los Angeles took the 
day off after police closed the snow-slick roads on mountain passes out of the 
area. The California Highway Patrol blocked on-ramps and off-ramps to the 
Golden State and Antelope Valley freeways Wednesday morning, creating 
miles-long backups at major intersections. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Stay Home,' People Told 
</P>
<P>
"We're telling people to stay home and get off the roads and just wait this 
thing out," Officer Ralph Elvira said. 
</P>
<P>
And so they did. 
</P>
<P>
Customers with armloads of mittens, boots and winter hats lined up 15 deep at 
the Sports Chalet in Newhall. 
</P>
<P>
The store's 400 plastic, saucer-shaped snow-sliding toys were sold out by early 
afternoon, store manager Whitney Wilkinson said. 
</P>
<P>
That left only six old-fashioned sleds with runners. At $25, they cost more 
than twice what a plastic disk did, but 7-year-old Johnny Schoonvel's father 
sprang for one anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"First me and my dad were building snow forts and now we get to go sledding," 
Johnny bubbled. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, look at what this says on it," a smiling Barry Schoonvel, 40, said to 
his son. "It says 'Speedy.' " 
</P>
<P>
"It's an incredibly festive day," said the elder Schoonvel, who normally 
commutes to Chatsworth. "Everyone in the neighborhood is outside, happy to be 
off work. We booed the people who tried to go to work." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County pickup trucks fitted with plow blades kept main streets open 
throughout the area, at a cost of $8,000 a day to the city, Santa Clarita 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
But by noon traffic was light, except to supermarkets thronged with shoppers 
stocking up on food to wait out the storm. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like everybody had the same idea," said Karen Hall of Newhall, coming 
out of a Lucky market with enough food to last several days. "I've met most of 
my neighbors here." 
</P>
<P>
Joe Dunham, manager of the store, said there were heavy runs on cognac, 
firewood and film, as adults prepared for a night by the fireplace and families 
rushed out to photograph each other in the unusual snowfall. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Snowman Built 
</P>
<P>
City workers built a snowman in front of the Santa Clarita City Hall and about 
20 of them posed for pictures, women employees standing in slush in open-toed 
pumps. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an unusual day and we're doing unusual things," said City Manager 
George Caravalho. "We might as well enjoy the snow while it's here." 
</P>
<P>
In the civic center in Valencia, hand-drawn "closed" signs were posted on the 
Los Angeles County office building, the library and the municipal courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
That disappointed Bill Read, 41, of Newhall, who showed up with an unpaid 
traffic ticket. As long as he couldn't get to work in Thousand Oaks, he said, 
"I thought this would be my one opportunity to get this thing paid." 
</P>
<P>
He read the notice on the courthouse door and trudged off, saying, "I guess 
I'll just have to rent a video, go home, kick back and relax." 
</P>
<P>
The five school districts in the valley canceled classes for the day, freeing 
22,000 students who turned every available slope into a sledding ground and 
covered the streets with snowmen and even snow women, built with triangular, 
skirt-shaped blocks. 
</P>
<P>
"Every kid is outside soaking wet and freezing but loving every minute of it," 
said Donna Grindey, 49, a Valencia mother. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No School' 
</P>
<P>
"This is great -- no school and snow fights," proclaimed Adam Wright, 10, of 
Valencia as he skidded through the snow on his bicycle. "Look, it really 
fishtails." 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the school districts "are all going to wait until Thursday" to 
decide whether to keep the schools closed for a second day, said Robert Nolet, 
superintendent of the Sulphur Springs School District. 
</P>
<P>
There was concern about the safety of children on school buses, Nolet said, but 
the main problem was the large number of school employees cut off by freeway 
closures because they live in the San Fernando and Antelope valleys. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden State Freeway was closed Wednesday morning from Lyons Avenue, just 
south of Magic Mountain, to Lake Hughes Road in Castaic. Some northbound 
traffic later was allowed through under CHP escort. The Antelope Valley Freeway 
was closed from Sierra Highway to Palmdale until the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"Surprisingly, there have been no big problems yet," said Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Lt. Harvey Cantor. Deputies responded to 15 accidents in the Santa 
Clarita Valley.

INDICTMENT IN LETTER FORGERY PLEASES FLOYD AND HIS MOTHER 
</P>

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the eve of the Nov. 4, 1986, general election, Democratic Assemblyman 
Richard E. Floyd accompanied his mother, Viola, to her Lawndale post office 
box. 
</P>
<P>
To their surprise, she, along with thousands of other voters in his 53rd 
District, received a letter purportedly from then-President Reagan, accusing 
her son of "caving in to the powerful underworld drug industry." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday -- 27 months later -- the Sacramento County Grand Jury indicted 
Assemblyman John R. Lewis (R-Orange) on one felony count of forgery for his 
role in mailing out thousands of the letters. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd, never one to mince words, declared that other Republican assemblymen 
should also be indicted. 
</P>
<P>
"The sons of bitches ought to go away for life without possibility of parole," 
Floyd said in an interview Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"It was more than a forged letter," the Carson Democrat said. "It was a 
first-class mailing the day before the election, full of lies on White House 
stationery, with a forgery of the President's signature." 
</P>
<P>
Floyd immediately denounced the letter and called on law enforcement officials 
to investigate it and similar but milder "Reagan" letters attacking five other 
Democrats. All six were on White House stationery and "signed" by Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Family Was Embarrassed 
</P>
<P>
Floyd said this week that he pursued the issue partly because his family, 
especially his mother, was distressed and embarrassed by the letter. 
</P>
<P>
Viola Floyd, who celebrated her 85th birthday on Election Day 1986, recalled 
Wednesday that the letter shocked her. 
</P>
<P>
"I was mad. I knew right well there was something wrong," she said. "I knew 
Dick never did such a thing, and I knew the President would never stoop that 
low." 
</P>
<P>
After an internal investigation, the White House said the letters were 
authorized by neither the President nor any of his aides. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the letter, which arrived at the end of a bruising campaign against 
Republican challenger Roger E. Fiola, Floyd was reelected by a margin of 6,189 
votes. 
</P>
<P>
A Republican legislative source who asked not to be identified speculated that 
one of the reasons Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, a Democrat, pursued the 
investigation was because of public pressure from Floyd, one of the Assembly's 
most outspoken and partisan members. If the mailer had targeted a less vocal 
Democrat, the source suggested, the controversy might have died down. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Ashby, a Van de Kamp spokesman, denied that assertion, saying the decision 
to prosecute Lewis "was based on our review of the evidence. It was not based 
on pressure from any public official." But Van de Kamp's announcement of the 
indictment acknowledged that "targets of the mailers requested that the 
attorney general's office investigate the matter." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis said Tuesday that he will eventually be exonerated and he denounced the 
indictment. "Van de Kamp has a long history of winking at Democrat 
indiscretions" but "has doggedly pursued this opportunity to go after 
Republicans," Lewis said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
GOP lawmakers cited cases in which they claimed Van de Kamp had failed to act 
against Democrats, including one in which Floyd was allegedly involved. In a 
letter last April, Assemblyman Phillip Wyman (R-Tehachapi) told Van de Kamp 
that he had been "the target of unauthorized endorsement letters during the 
1984 general election." One of the endorsements was accompanied by a letter 
from Floyd criticizing Wyman on a veterans issue. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp referred the issue to Kern County Dist. Atty. Ed Jagels. On 
Wednesday, Jagels said his office had declined to prosecute because the 
three-year statute of limitations had run out. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd denied Wednesday that he did anything improper in the campaign against 
Wyman, pointing out that he signed his own letter. "It was from me. I didn't go 
around the side door," Floyd said. 
</P>
<P>
During the controversy over the phony Reagan letters, Floyd has kept the issue 
alive by reminding voters and lawmakers that he was the target of the strongest 
letter purportedly signed by Reagan. In his reelection campaign last fall, he 
distributed printed copies of news stories about the letters and warned voters 
that Assemblyman Pat Nolan, then Assembly GOP leader, was again trying to oust 
him from office. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd said the Reagan letters issue became so highly charged because the 
allegations were untrue and because they were deeply felt by his family. 
</P>
<P>
"It was my momma's 85th birthday and it was pretty hard for her to read," he 
said. "Then, I had to get in contact with my daughters who live in the 
district" and explain the situation to them, he said. 
</P>
<P>
For Viola Floyd, Monday's action by the grand jury marked the end of a bitter 
chapter. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel real happy," she said.

RACIAL SPLIT EMERGES IN CARSON DEVELOPMENT FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE STEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Racial divisions surfaced this week at a raucous Carson City Council meeting 
where black residents opposed to a development near Cal State Dominguez Hills 
accused city officials of treating them as "second-class citizens" -- a charge 
that was hotly denied. 
</P>
<P>
The opponents claim that the development -- which needs city variances on lot 
size, street width, and yard and garage setbacks -- is a substandard project 
likely to attract crime and cause traffic congestion. They allege that similar 
variances would never be approved outside North Carson. 
</P>
<P>
The accusation is familiar in often-polarized Carson, where City Council 
factions reflect racial and ethnic divisions in the community. Many 
middle-class blacks live in the north end of the city. Less well-off Latinos 
and Asians live in the south. 
</P>
<P>
About 400 people, almost all of them black, jammed council chambers Tuesday, 
cheering opponents of the project and jeering anyone who spoke in favor or who 
questioned any of the opponents' assertions. Mayor Kay Calas threatened to have 
the audience ejected after several outbursts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
South Vs. North 
</P>
<P>
"It is the south side versus the north side," declared April Gipson, a black 
community activist who led the residents' protest. "It is humiliating and 
downright embarrassing that North Carson must fight the same old fight over and 
over. We have just had it. Regardless of our race or creed, we will not be 
treated as second-class citizens." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Kay Calas, who is white, 
</P>
<P>
raised her voice in reply. 
</P>
<P>
"I kind of resent what you are saying," Calas said, adding that there are many 
substandard lots in the south and east of the city. "You haven't done your 
homework. Don't try to divide the community." 
</P>
<P>
"I am not," Gipson said. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, you are," Calas replied, shaking a finger at Gipson. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Appeal of an Approval 
</P>
<P>
The issue before the council was an appeal of the Planning Commission's 
approval of a proposed development of 132 single-family homes on a 17.4-acre 
tract at Avalon Boulevard and University Drive. 
</P>
<P>
The council decided to resume discussion of the appeal Feb. 21 to consider 
changes proposed by the developer, Lewis Homes. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis originally sought to build 102 homes on lots meeting the city's minimum 
size requirement of 5,000 square feet but later decided that the project would 
not be profitable enough. It later submitted plans for a denser, more 
profitable development. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 13, the Planning Commission approved a revised plan that increased the 
number of homes to 132 and made the project a gated community with private 
roads that did not have to be as wide as city streets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fire Officials Opposed It 
</P>
<P>
Variances approved by the commission included smaller lot sizes, some narrow 
street widths, short front yards and reduced garage setbacks. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials opposed the project because they anticipated difficulties 
maneuvering emergency equipment on narrow streets. City public works officials 
said the private roads would deteriorate without city maintenance and might 
cost the city money in the future. 
</P>
<P>
However, the city staff, citing regional needs for more housing, said the 
changes requested by Lewis Homes were justified. 
</P>
<P>
Planning Director Pat Brown said the commission decided that more relaxed 
development standards were acceptable in a gated community with private roads. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Density Was Increased 
</P>
<P>
Opposition to the project began to build after the Planning Commission 
decision, as the word spread that the project would be denser than originally 
planned. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 28, Councilwoman Sylvia Muise, who lives in the area and had originally 
encouraged the developer to bring a project to the site, appealed the Planning 
Commission decision to the full council, arguing against the narrow streets and 
for a traffic study. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, residents of the middle-class, mostly black neighborhoods adjacent to 
the project had successfully campaigned against a condominium apartment 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
They noted that students from the site would attend Compton schools which, they 
said, have a reputation for gang activity. They asserted that the developer 
therefore would be unable to sell the units and would rent them instead. They 
said that likely tenants would bring crime, loud parties and violence to the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
It is this same group that has rallied against the Lewis Homes project, voicing 
fears of crime and low-income blacks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Don't Want Watts' 
</P>
<P>
After the council meeting, Gerry Bryan, vice president for land development for 
Lewis Homes, was surrounded by a group of opponents to the development. "We 
don't want Watts," one black woman bluntly told him. "We pay too much taxes." 
</P>
<P>
Gregory Smith, a Cal State Dominguez Hills professor, said the homes built on 
the narrow streets would be resold quickly, go on the rental market and soon 
become "fester points, or open sores." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Site Would Limit Asking Price 
</P>
<P>
Bryan acknowledged in an interview that the location of the site in the Compton 
Unified School District would limit the asking price for the homes. He said 
price limitations led the company to design a denser project than it first 
planned. 
</P>
<P>
Bryan, however, said that Lewis Homes is willing to amend the project so that 
all streets would be at least 36 feet wide, which would require the elimination 
of several homes. It is not willing to build the project if lots must be 5,000 
square feet. 
</P>
<P>
Gipson, in an interview after the meeting, said she is adamant that the houses 
must be built on lots with a minimum size of 5,000 feet.

WEINTRAUB, POLLACK SQUARE OFF ON SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM ENRIQUEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of two candidates challenging Los Angeles school board President Roberta 
Weintraub in the April 11 election charged in a debate Wednesday that the 
10-year incumbent has "lost touch" with her east San Fernando Valley 
constituency. 
</P>
<P>
Citing gang and drug troubles, as well as a 40% dropout rate in the Los Angeles 
Unified School district, candidate Barry Pollack said "our system is failing, 
and Roberta Weintraub is steering that system." 
</P>
<P>
But Weintraub, 53, seeking her fourth term on the board, defended her record, 
which she said includes the defeat of a plan to expand year-round schools, the 
televising of weekly board meetings and support for expansion of the district's 
bilingual program. 
</P>
<P>
"I've done a good job," Weintraub said. 
</P>
<P>
Pollack blamed the board and Weintraub for delays in settling the months-long 
pay dispute between teachers and the district. He said the district can afford 
to pay more than the district's latest offer, a 20% pay hike over three years. 
</P>
<P>
Weintraub said that teachers deserve better salaries, but that the board has 
"pushed ourselves to the limit" with the current offer. The United Teachers-Los 
Angeles, the union representing most of the Los Angeles district teachers, has 
asked for an 11% raise for the current school year. 
</P>
<P>
"This school board is putting its money where its mouth is," Weintraub said. 
</P>
<P>
Pollack said the district pays for more administrators than are needed to run 
the 592,000-student school district. 
</P>
<P>
Weintraub said she will seek 3% to 5% in administrative cuts at the district's 
downtown headquarters. "We won't have any problem in reducing the bureaucracy 
because $100 million in cuts will be needed to increase the pay to teachers," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Pollack, 42, is an emergency room physician for an Orange County hospital. He 
is a founding member of Quality Education for Students, a parents group opposed 
to year-round schools. He has three children in Los Angeles schools. 
</P>
<P>
Ernesto L. Llanes, 45, is also seeking Weintraub's seat on the seven-member 
board that runs the country's second largest school district. Llanes, an 
electrical contractor who was a teacher in the Philippines during the 1960s, 
said he was not notified in time of the debate and had made other plans. 
</P>
<P>
Weintraub, who was first elected to the board in 1979 after the recall of 
former board member Howard Miller, predicted that she will raise more than 
$100,000 for the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Pollack, in his first run for public office, said he will raise $75,000 to 
$100,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Weintraub has been in office 10 years, and I do not believe that anyone will 
say that our school system is any better off," Pollack said. 
</P>
<P>
The debate was sponsored by the San Fernando Valley chapter of the 
Mexican-American Political Assn.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To Kill A Raise 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 380 to 48, the House passed a resolution (HJ Res 129) disapproving 
pay raises proposed for members of Congress, federal judges and top officials 
of the executive branch. The measure was then adopted by the Senate and sent to 
President Bush for his signature, officially killing the pay raises. The 
increases were proposed in December by a federal commission and sent to Capitol 
Hill on Jan. 9 by then-President Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional salaries would have risen nearly 51% to $135,000 under the 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Craig James (R-Fla.), who supported the resolution, said he was glad the House 
did not permit the raises to take effect automatically. "Allowing this absurd 
increase to go into effect without a vote would have constituted an ethical 
atrocity that this body would not have been able to live down," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Pay raise supporter Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), told colleagues: "It's high time 
we stop whipping ourselves" over the pay issue because "each member of this 
house, Democrat and Republican, is worth a salary of $135,000."

To Force a Pay Vote 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 88 to 238, the House rejected a parliamentary strategy to avert a 
direct vote on proposed pay increases for members of Congress, federal judges 
and top executive branchemployees. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic and Republican leaders had hoped to sidestep a vote by keeping the 
House out of session until after the Feb. 8 date on which the raises were to 
take effect in the absence of House and Senate blocking action. 
</P>
<P>
But with this vote on Monday, the House refused to adjourn without voting on 
the pay increase. The upshot was that Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.) agreed to an 
up-or-down vote (above) that scuttled the raises. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes endorsed the leadership plan to allow the pay increases to 
take effect Wednesday without a record vote in the House.

VEHICLE PERMITS RESTRICTED

<TEXT>
<P>
The Avalon City Council has imposed a 90-day moratorium on the issuance of new 
vehicle permits in the city. No new permits will be issued for automobiles, 
trucks, motorcycles or golf carts. The only exceptions will be for motorcycles 
and golf carts in retail inventory. 
</P>
<P>
The moratorium, approved Tuesday by a 4-1 vote, will allow the city to complete 
studies of proposed development, impact on streets and roads, and alternatives 
to increasing the numbers of vehicles on the few streets in the one-square-mile 
island city.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE

<TEXT>
<P>
To Kill A Raise 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 380 to 48, the House passed a resolution (HJ Res 129) disapproving 
pay raises proposed for members of Congress, federal judges and top officials 
of the executive branch. The measure was then adopted by the Senate and sent to 
President Bush for his signature, officially killing the pay raises. The 
increases were proposed in December by a federal commission and sent to Capitol 
Hill on Jan. 9 by then-President Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional salaries would have risen nearly 51% to $135,000 under the 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Craig James (R-Fla.), who supported the resolution, said he was glad the House 
did not permit the raises to take effect automatically. "Allowing this absurd 
increase to go into effect without a vote would have constituted an ethical 
atrocity that this body would not have been able to live down," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Pay raise supporter Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), told colleagues: "It's high time 
we stop whipping ourselves" over the pay issue because "each member of this 
house, Democrat and Republican, is worth a salary of $135,000."

To Force a Pay Vote 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 88 to 238, the House rejected a parliamentary strategy to avert a 
direct vote on proposed pay increases for members of Congress, federal judges 
and top executive branchemployees. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic and Republican leaders had hoped to sidestep a vote by keeping the 
House out of session until after the Feb. 8 date on which the raises were to 
take effect in the absence of House and Senate blocking action. 
</P>
<P>
But with this vote on Monday, the House refused to adjourn without voting on 
the pay increase. The upshot was that Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.) agreed to an 
up-or-down vote (above) that scuttled the raises. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes endorsed the leadership plan to allow the pay increases to 
take effect Wednesday without a record vote in the House.

SCHOOL BOARD OKS FREE TRIP SOUTH; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL EXCHANGE PRAISED FOR ITS EDUCATIONAL BENEFITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A private school in Mississippi will pay $25,000 to bring San Marino High 
School's football team to the Deep South in September for a rematch. 
</P>
<P>
The San Marino Board of Education recently accepted the unusual 
all-expenses-paid offer made by Jackson Academy of Jackson, Miss., after the 
school played -- and lost to -- San Marino last fall. 
</P>
<P>
San Marino football fans see the offer as irresistible. In September, they 
threw a series of giant welcoming parties for the 400 students, faculty and 
families from Jackson who traveled 2,000 miles and spent four days in the area 
for the football game with San Marino. 
</P>
<P>
Now the academy and its booster club plan to raise money to help finance the 
exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Educators praised last year's game for the many educational exchanges it 
stimulated among students, but called it a one-time-only event because they did 
not want to use school money to finance play in Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cost Borne by Donations 
</P>
<P>
The cost of entertaining the Mississippi delegation was borne by donations 
because of the school district's tight budget. 
</P>
<P>
Although the proposed return match in Jackson has the enthusiastic endorsement 
of the San Marino Boosters Club and the Board of Education, some wonder if it 
could jeopardize pleas for financial help for the city's schools. 
</P>
<P>
After losing two attempts to raise a special tax in recent years, San Marino's 
Educational Foundation plans to launch a major fund drive for $2 million to $3 
million to add to the school budget. Educators say the district suffers 
financially because students in the prosperous community rank among the highest 
academically in the state, precluding the district from getting any of the 
state's special funding that most districts receive for disadvantaged students. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if the trip doesn't cost us anything, it may be a wrong signal to people 
as to the condition of our resources," said Selma Sax, who cast the only 
opposing vote at the school board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"Is this the right time to be doing something like this?" asked Richard 
Sprunger, who has two children in district schools. 
</P>
<P>
"Would taking this trip impair our fund-raising abilities?" Sprunger asked. 
"We're trying to get money from Sacramento to rehabilitate school buildings, we 
have 10 classrooms that are closed because they don't meet earthquake standards 
and we have to consider teacher salaries. I don't know how we would be viewed 
in Sacramento after taking such a trip. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Pay Their Own Way' 
</P>
<P>
Sax and Sprunger said they are not "anti-athletics or anti-field trips" and 
will support the school board's decision to back the trip. 
</P>
<P>
San Marino High School Principal Donald Banderas said the $25,000 gift would 
cover plane fare, room and board, and ground transportation for 45 football 
players and about 10 coaches and administrators. 
</P>
<P>
"If others want to go, they pay their own way," Banderas said. "The key element 
in acceptance of the offer is there will be absolutely no fund raising" that 
might compete with that of the Educational Foundation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We look at it like any kind of field trip, a chance for something unique," 
Banderas said. 
</P>
<P>
The game is scheduled for Sept. 23 and would be San Marino's second game of the 
season. The team plans to leave Sept. 21 and return Sept. 24. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Compatible School 
</P>
<P>
Last year San Marino beat Jackson 21 to 0 and went on to win its CIF Division 
championship. Most of the top players will graduate this year, Banderas said, 
leaving next year's team an unknown quantity. 
</P>
<P>
The game was the result of two years of research and negotiations by Jackson 
Academy, which searched throughout the country for a compatible high school 
that its team could challenge. In accepting, San Marino officials said that 
they could never arrange an exchange and that the teams would never meet again. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson Academy Headmaster Peter Jernberg said last year's game triggered 
educational and cultural exchanges that far exceeded students' and faculty 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
"We profited so tremendously from the experience that we wanted to give San 
Marino people the same opportunity," Jernberg said. "It turned out that 
football was secondary to the educational, social and cultural values the 
students received. So we felt we would provide this avenue to come to 
Mississippi, and to return their hospitality." 
</P>
<P>
Jernberg said money to pay for the trip will come from corporate sponsorships, 
gate proceeds and promotional sales of T-shirts and novelties. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'An Affair Like This' 
</P>
<P>
San Marino Supt. Gary Richards said school districts are not prohibited from 
using their own funds for trips, "but we wouldn't spend district money for an 
affair like this." 
</P>
<P>
Sax said she opposes the trip partly because of the need to hire substitutes to 
replace faculty members who will travel to Mississippi and because of the 
possible lapse in education during the two school days when so many students 
and teachers would be away. 
</P>
<P>
San Marino Booster Club President Jim Ukropina said the Boosters will pay the 
district the $750 it will cost for substitute teachers. He guessed an 
additional 100 San Marinans may make the trip at their own expense because of 
last year's success. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Meet the Governor 
</P>
<P>
"These students are going to meet the governor and lieutenant governor of 
Mississippi, the entire state Legislature, the mayor of Jackson -- even the 
famous author Eudora Welty has it all set up to see them," Ukropina said. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of us see this as the broadest approach to education, where there are no 
walls. Many of us felt that last year's experience was fulfilled long before 
kickoff."

JOAN ORR: LIFE LIVED WITH VIGOR IN THE FACE OF FATAL DISEASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNETTE KONDO, Kondo is a free-lance writer from San Gabriel. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Joan Orr never canceled a dance class. When unable to stand, she taught from a 
wheelchair. When her voice became too weak for a microphone, she scribbled 
notes to an assistant. 
</P>
<P>
Almost a year has passed since Orr's last class. Yet the memories of her life 
continue to teach lessons. 
</P>
<P>
"She showed us courage," said her husband, Verne Orr. "And a message about not 
giving in and still trying to give to others." 
</P>
<P>
That determination to help people -- even in her last days as she struggled 
with a debilitating disease -- is the subject of a video documentary, "A 
Question of Balance, the Life of Joan Orr." 
</P>
<P>
It was presented at at Polytechnic School in Pasadena last week as part of a 
tribute honoring Orr. 
</P>
<P>
The Light-Bringer Project, a group of artists and writers, and the Pasadena 
Community Access Corp., a nonprofit organization run by Pasadena to provide 
public access to cable, co-produced the documentary. Orr was filmed in some of 
her last dance sessions before her death last April at 69. 
</P>
<P>
Her spirit was challenged but never dominated by the ravaging effects of 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a degenerative neuromuscular disorder also 
known as Lou Gehrig's Disease. 
</P>
<P>
In the video, dancers bend, sway and twist to music as Joan Orr encourages them 
to explore their creativity and their emotions. 
</P>
<P>
"All of her dance had therapy in it," her husband explained. "She found that it 
was a tremendous release of emotions, and she was extremely successful in 
helping people." Through the medium of dance, Orr was able to reach out to a 
diverse range of students. 
</P>
<P>
Dance was always a part of her life. In the late 1930s, she danced while a 
student at Scripps College in Claremont, and later taught there. When the Orrs, 
natives of Des Moines, Iowa, moved to Pasadena in the 1940s, she began to teach 
dance classes at local churches and schools -- up to seven classes a week. One 
day her pupils might be 5-year-olds; another day she'd work with alcoholic 
women from a halfway house. 
</P>
<P>
Her talents extended beyond the dance studio. As president of the Pasadena Arts 
Council in 1977 and 1978, Orr is remembered by those who worked with her as a 
rare and inspirational leader. She presided over monthly board meetings, aiming 
to bring more cultural events, including dance, to Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
"She brought out the best in others and was dedicated to the belief that all 
cultural arts were not a luxury but an essential part of the community," said 
Randell Makinson, curator and director of the Gamble House in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
During her terms as president of the arts council, Orr became acquainted with 
dancer Bella Lewitzky. The two became friends and shortly thereafter, Orr 
became the first person to chair the Lewitzky Dance Foundation and the 
affiliated Dance Gallery Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
"She was gentle, beautiful and good," Lewitzky said. "Very few people fit that 
adjective: good." 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, President Reagan appointed Verne Orr secretary of the Air Force. 
Earlier, when Reagan was governor of California, Orr had served as state 
finance director for five years and as head of the Department of Motor 
Vehicles. "She probably visited 100 bases," Verne Orr recalled. "She never went 
to museums or went shopping. She was on duty." 
</P>
<P>
As her husband peered inside aircraft hangars and inspected flight lines, Joan 
Orr visited hospitals and child-care centers, meeting Air Force wives and 
families. She was sensitive to their lonely, often transient life styles and 
lent a supportive ear to their problems, her husband said. At Christmas, the 
Orrs would travel to remote bases in Greenland and Alaska to visit servicemen 
separated from their families. 
</P>
<P>
Verne Orr's tenure as secretary of the Air Force was cut short when his wife 
was diagnosed as having ALS in June, 1985. After doctors predicted that she had 
only three years to live, the Orrs decided to return to Pasadena. The Air Force 
honored her by initiating the Joan Peak Orr Award, to be given annually to an 
Air Force wife who makes an outstanding contribution to the service. 
</P>
<P>
When she returned to Pasadena in the fall of 1985, Orr walked with the help of 
crutches. A month later, she required a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
"She refused to be pitied and never asked for sympathy," her husband said. 
</P>
<P>
Several months later, a former student, Carole Babcock, suggested that Orr 
start her dance classes again. With Babcock's assistance, music and dance soon 
filled the Orr's living room each Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"It was wonderful to watch Joan in class," Babcock said. "You could see the 
strength coming back to her body. She said that she felt energized; that in a 
sense, she was dancing through us." 
</P>
<P>
Weeks passed, and with each Monday session, Orr's disease weakened first her 
voice, then her other muscles. Gradually, her microphone was replaced by a 
writing slate and Orr jotted dance instructions to Babcock, who then acted out 
the movements. 
</P>
<P>
Orr taught the class until two weeks before her death. 
</P>
<P>
Lewitzky remembers calling her a week before she died. "She spoke so positively 
and with a sense of well-being," Lewitzky said. "She was determined to make 
every moment count."

MAGIC OUT, INJURES HIS HAMSTRING; 
</P>
<P>
HE MAY BE SIDELINED FOR AT LEAST WEEK; LAKERS LOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It was a typically artistic Magic Johnson drive, a darting, twisting foray 
through the lane late in the third quarter Wednesday night that resulted in a 
Laker basket. 
</P>
<P>
But that will be Johnson's last drive for an undetermined period. For when he 
touched down, Johnson gave a painful grimace and grabbed his left leg in what 
later was diagnosed as a partially torn left hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
The loss of Johnson, perhaps for a minimum of a week, coincided with the 
Lakers' 121-118 loss to the Golden State Warriors in a type of finish that has 
become Johnson's specialty. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson suffered the hamstring tear while planting his left foot on the layup. 
The Lakers said he definitely will miss Sunday's All-Star game in Houston and 
will be examined again Monday. Laker trainer Gary Vitti said the degree of 
Johnson's injury fell somewhere between moderate and severe, but he said a 
time-frame for his return could not be established. 
</P>
<P>
But Laker Coach Pat Riley talked as if he already accepted the fact that 
Johnson will miss some games. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't look good," Riley said of Johnson's injury. "I'm not a doctor, but 
from what I understand, the injury will keep him out indefinitely." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers do not play again until Tuesday, when they host the Detroit Pistons 
in a replay of last season's NBA championship series. 
</P>
<P>
Will Johnson be ready for that game? 
</P>
<P>
"Not unless Gary Vitti is a miracle trainer," Riley said. "Well, we're 
optimistic it's not going to be a real long time, but we don't want to take 
chances with it. It's a long season. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a lot of talent on our team. Earvin is obviously a crucial player, 
and we hope it's a short period of time. But we'll deal with it and move on." 
</P>
<P>
On this night, the Lakers (32-15) could not successfully deal with the Warriors 
(25-19), who gave the Lakers problems with or without Johnson in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers trailed, 91-88, with 1:57 to play in the third quarter when Johnson 
left the game and was escorted off the court. But even without their leading 
scorer and floor leader, the Lakers immediately responded with a 9-0 run that 
gave them a 97-91 lead going into the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
For the next six minutes, the Lakers maintained a slim lead, eight points being 
their biggest advantage. 
</P>
<P>
But then came the final minutes and the Lakers, without Johnson's guidance, 
wilted amid the Warriors' pressure. The Lakers still held on to a 115-110 lead 
with 1:48 to play when Byron Scott, making his first appearance since Jan. 24 
after a urological disorder, sank a two free throws. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Warriors rallied and converted turnovers by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 
and Scott into points. Terry Teagle's tip-in off Steve Alford's miss gave the 
Warriors a 118-117 lead with 25 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
Seven seconds later, Scott missed a jump shot under duress, and Chris Mullin 
was fouled after grabbing the rebound. Mullin sank both free throws, giving 
Golden State a 120-117 lead with 13 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
Wanting to avoid a Laker three-point attempt, the Warriors immediately fouled 
Tony Campbell after he received the inbounds pass from Michael Cooper. Campbell 
made only one of the two free throws, cutting the margin to two points. And, 
after Rod Higgins sank one free throw with 10 seconds, the Warriors had a 
121-118 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Teagle was the major reason the Warriors won at the Forum for the first time in 
11 tries. He made 17 of his game-high 35 points in the third quarter. Mullin 
added 28 points and 11 assists, while guard Otis Smith contributed 18 points as 
a fill-in for injured Mitch Richmond (lower back strain). 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers received 30 points from James Worthy and 28 points, 12 assists and 
eight rebounds from Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Those are standard statistics for Johnson. But it seems the Lakers will have to 
live without them for an indeterminate time. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a time loss injury," Vitti said. "How much time, I don't know. It depends 
on how he reacts to treatment."

MORNING BRIEFING: IT'S ANOTHER CHANCE TO HOLD COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tom Lasorda, who a few weeks ago was analyzing the Super Bowl on television, 
has turned to basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, the Dodger manager sat on the bench with Coach Rollie Massimino 
and his Villanova team during its game against Georgetown. 
</P>
<P>
Massimino, who last summer served as a Dodger bat boy, had invited Lasorda to 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
But, according to Newsday's Sandy Kennan, Lasorda might have gotten his friend 
into trouble. 
</P>
<P>
A preseason memo, sent to the coaches by Big East Commissioner Dave Gavitt, 
stated that non-university personnel -- such as boosters, car dealers and 
celebrities -- were not to sit with the team during conference games. 
</P>
<P>
Georgetown Coach John Thompson, asked if it bothered him when Villanova fans 
chanted "S-A-T, S-A-T, S-A-T" when his players were at the free-throw line, 
said: 
</P>
<P>
"Not when my shooter is valedictorian of his high school class." 
</P>
<P>
Senior Jaren Jackson, who led the Hoyas to a 69-55 victory, was valedictorian 
at Walter Cohen High in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
How do you stop all the fighting in pro basketball? 
</P>
<P>
Brad Daugherty of the Cleveland Cavaliers says stiffer penalties may be an 
answer. He and Detroit's Bill Laimbeer were each suspended a game and fined 
$5,000 for fighting Jan. 27. 
</P>
<P>
But Daugherty thinks Laimbeer, who has a history of fighting, got off too 
lightly. 
</P>
<P>
"When it's a repeat offense, you have to do something, like start suspending 
somebody, for five games, 10 games," Daugherty told the Delaware County Daily 
Times. "Things like that." 
</P>
<P>
Before Wednesday night's game against the Houston Rockets, a professional 
hypnotherapist, Gil Boyne, appeared on Channel 4's early news to hypnotize any 
Clippers who might have been watching. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it worked, since the Clippers won, 114-111. 
</P>
<P>
You might have seen that recent clip of Detroit's Isiah Thomas, strangling one 
of the Pistons' assistant coaches. 
</P>
<P>
The assistant, Brendan Malone, told David Aldridge of the Washington Post, what 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago's Bill Cartwright had just sent Thomas flying with an elbow, resulting 
in a cut near Thomas' eyebrow. 
</P>
<P>
When Malone came out on court to calm Thomas down, Thomas had a few choice 
words about Cartwright and then said words to the effect of "he makes me so mad 
I could . . . choke him." 
</P>
<P>
And that's what Thomas acted out on Malone, who never flinched. 
</P>
<P>
Malone said he knew he was in no danger, and that Thomas thanked him later for 
keeping him from getting ejected from of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Thrift Rift: Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher Jeff Robinson says that Syd Thrift, the 
team's general manager who was fired in October, was continually phoning 
Manager Jim Leyland in the dugout last season, second-guessing strategic moves. 
</P>
<P>
"This season is when you will get to see how good a manager Jim Leyland is," 
Robinson told the Washington (Pa.) Observer-Reporter. "He won't have Syd 
looking over his shoulder or calling him on the phone about why he bunted a man 
over in a certain situation." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if Leyland had resented Thrift's suggestions, Robinson said, "I know how 
I'd feel." 
</P>

opened, but I feel so close."

half as second-ranked Georgetown went on a 20-10 run and pulled away from 
Connecticut for a 70-58 Big East victory at Hartford, Conn., Wednesday night.

24 as the No. 20 Yellow Jackets won at New York.

(15-7) the lead for good, 61-60. 
</P>
<P>
Florida 65, Georgia 60 -- Dwayne Schintzius' jump hook with 12 seconds left 
helped the Gators win their Southeastern Conference game at Gainesville, Fla.

Cal State Fullerton, coming off an upset of UC Santa Barbara that was the

Conference game tonight at Titan Gym.

The Rebels (15-5 overall and 10-1 in the Big West) handed Santa Barbara a 77-61

UC IRVINE TO FACE BELEAGUERED SAN JOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UC Irvine has played its best games of the season against two of its toughest 
opponents -- both in the Bren Center in front of a full house. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters beat UCLA in late December, 91-90, and then 16th-ranked Nevada 
Las Vegas last Saturday night, 99-98. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine has another home game at 7:30 tonight, but its opponent is not so highly 
regarded at the Bruins and Rebels. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters will play host to San Jose State, which has nine straight losses 
-- five since 10 scholarship players walked out last month, demanding the 
firing of Coach Bill Berry. The Anteaters (8-11 overall and 5-5 in the Big 
West) beat the Spartans at San Jose, 71-62, before the walkout. 
</P>
<P>
The Spartans (5-15, 1-10) have a rag-tag collection of walk-ons, track and 
field athletes, and football and baseball players, who have played admirally. 
They lost to Cal State Long Beach, 58-54, Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no pressure against Vegas because you're not supposed to win," Irvine 
Coach Bill Mulligan said. "But this San Jose game scares me. This is pressure. 
I know San Jose can beat us. I just hope our players know it." JOHN WEYLER

 Rolling Hills center John Hardy scored 36, 37 and 36 points last week to help 
the Titans go 2-1 and clinch a tie for their third straight Bay League title. 
Hardy raised his average to 28 points per game. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore center Sean Goodwin (27 points) and forward Scott Klein (22) led

Despite playing the final three minutes with only four players because of

Prep basketball fans in San Pedro strayed from their seats to participate in 
two brawls in recent weeks, leading administrators at San Pedro High and Mary 
Star to bar spectators from games. Fans joined in a fracas between Mary Star 
and Cathedral on Jan. 27, and last Friday spectators were emptied from San 
Pedro's gym after joining a fight between the Pirates and Narbonne. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of Friday's Torrance-Leuzinger basketball game were criticized for 
allowing play to get too rough, then turning the game into a foul-shooting 
contest. The teams attempted 70 free throws, including 38 in the fourth 
quarter, as Torrance hung on for an 84-80 win. Said Torrance Coach Carl Strong: 
"The officiating was atrocious."

South Torrance's girls basketball team lost to West Torrance, 63-41, to fall to

TOROS PUT WINNING STREAK ON LINE AGAINST RIVERSIDE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The men's basketball team at Cal State Dominguez Hills, ranked 17th in the 
nation in Division II, puts its six-game winning streak on the line tonight at 
top-rated UC Riverside in a California Collegiate Athletic Assn. game at 8:05. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside (19-2) has not lost in 15 games but narrowly escaped, 59-58, in its 
meeting at Dominguez Hills (15-6) when a 17-foot jump shot by the Toros' 
Anthony Blackmon with nine seconds left rolled off the rim. The Highlanders and 
Toros have virtually locked up postseason tournament berths in the CCAA. 
Riverside (8-0) leads the conference, followed by Dominguez Hills (7-1). Four 
teams are tied for third with 4-4 records. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Hills tuned up for tonight's game with a surprisingly easy 62-50 
victory Tuesday at Chapman. The Toros did not score a basket in the first five 
minutes but then outpaced the Panthers, 17-1, in the next eight minutes to take 
control. Dominguez Hills held a 17-point halftime advantage. 
</P>
<P>
The Toros, fifth in the nation in fewest points allowed, have held seven of 
their last eight opponents under 60 points. Defense has been crucial because 
the team has suffered through two weeks of poor shooting. The Toros have not 
made 50% of their field goal attempts during that period. Riverside is 
averaging 90 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's game pits two CCAA most valuable player candidates. Riverside guard 
Maurice Pullum, a 6-2 senior, is averaging 18.6 points and four rebounds and is 
one of the conference's best three-point shooters. Blackmon, a 6-7 senior 
center, leads the CCAA in scoring (19.5) and rebounding (9.9) and is ranked 
second in blocked shots and sixth in steals. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Hills plays host to last-place Cal Poly Pomona (0-8, 6-14) Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
In the women's game tonight, Dominguez Hills (1-6, 6-13) will try to duplicate 
its only CCAA win of the year in a 5:45 game at Riverside (1-6, 6-15). PAUL

GLENDALE UNABLE TO KEEP UP WITH NO.1 SANTA MONICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM FARMER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the first half of its game against Santa Monica College, the Glendale 
basketball team was clinging to Coach Brian Beauchemin's maxim -- a young, 
inexperienced team can upset a better team. 
</P>
<P>
The Vaqueros are all first-year players. Santa Monica has seven returning 
players from a team that was 27-8 last season. 
</P>
<P>
But as evidenced by his play Wednesday night, Santa Monica forward Keith 
Amerson does not subscribe to Beauchemin's theory. 
</P>
<P>
Amerson scored 12 of his career-high 28 points in the second half as the 
Corsairs overcame a one-point halftime deficit to win, 85-71, at Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
"They are just too strong," Beauchemin said of Santa Monica (26-3, 11-0), which 
has won 14 consecutive games and is ranked No. 1 in the state. "And we didn't 
do ourselves any favors by not executing what we were supposed to do." 
</P>
<P>
What the Vaqueros were supposed to do was surgically dismantle Santa Monica's 
full-court press. At times, however, it looked as though the Vaqueros' hands 
had been surgically removed. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale had little difficulty handling the Corsairs' halfcourt defense, but 
when Santa Monica ran the 2-1-2 press the Vaqueros needed 911. 
</P>
<P>
And Amerson wasted little time in capitalizing on Glendale's miscues. He had 
three steals in the first five minutes and scored 10 of Santa Monica's first 14 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 27-20, with five minutes to play in the half, the Vaqueros mounted a 
12-4 rally that was sparked by three-point baskets by Dave Swanson and Gary 
Fowler. Bruce Heicke made two free throws with two seconds to play, giving 
Glendale a 32-31 lead at intermission. 
</P>
<P>
At which point Amerson and teammate DeShawn Pullard held a conversation. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me that whenever he saw a guy on my back he'd bounce it to me so I 
could take it to the hole," said Amerson, who lives with Pullard. "He knows how 
I play and I know him, so that's a plus." 
</P>
<P>
Pullard was true to his word and fed Amerson in the paint for six points in a 
row to open the second half. The Corsairs, who earlier had missed several easy 
shots in the key, began to click and outscored Glendale, 22-6, in the first 
eight minutes of the second half. Santa Monica led, 63-44, with 8:31 to play 
and was long gone. 
</P>
<P>
Fowler led Glendale with 15 points. Heicke added 11 and Swanson, Alex Berry and 
Tony Lopez each scored 10. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully this won't happen next year," Beauchemin said. "Because right now 
I'm miserable."

LANDING TOP RECRUIT SNAP FOR CSUN; 
</P>
<P>
DAMIEN HIGH QUARTERBACK JOINS CENTER IN SIGNING WITH MATADORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marty Fisher, a talented high school quarterback, had been near the top of the 
Cal State Northridge football recruiting list for months. 
</P>
<P>
He also had drawn the attention of a handful of Division I schools -- most 
notably Nevada Las Vegas and Colorado State. 
</P>
<P>
But Northridge had an advantage, Matador Coach Bob Burt said Wednesday after 
signing Fisher, who played for Damien High in La Verne. 
</P>
<P>
"He liked the center we signed," Burt said. 
</P>
<P>
The coach could have said the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
The center: Kevin Burt, the coach's son and Fisher's teammate at Damien. 
</P>
<P>
Burt (6-foot-1, 225 pounds) was the All-Baseline League center. Fisher (6-2, 
175) was an all-league quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
"They got used to each other the last four years," Bob Burt said. "It was a 
package deal." 
</P>
<P>
And a deal that accounted for half the signings CSUN announced Wednesday, the 
first day four-year colleges are allowed to sign high school players. 
</P>
<P>
Albert Razo, a 6-1, 185-pound quarterback and punter from La Habra High, was 
the only other high school player to sign with CSUN on Wednesday. Burt said 
that he was still hopeful of gaining a commitment from running back Tyler 
Robuck, who played for Alemany High last fall. 
</P>
<P>
However, Northridge has signed 19 junior college players -- all but one before 
Wednesday. Perhaps the best came last. Tom Berry, a 6-5, 255-pound defensive 
tackle from Mt. San Antonio College "is as good as anyone," according to Burt. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 12 starters scheduled to return to CSUN, eight play defense, as do 14 of 
the new players. 
</P>
<P>
"We have some good people coming back, but we had to get better because of our 
schedule," Burt said. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors will open with back-to-back road games against Division I 
opponents -- Cal State Long Beach on Sept. 2, then Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher, who completed 91 of 211 passes for 1,258 yards last season, has no 
visions of starting in the opener. That job, he says, should go to Sherdrick 
Bonner, a CSUN backup the past two seasons.

St. Monica 77, St. Bernard 57 -- The Vikings, who had secured the Camino Real 
League championship, had a little luster removed from their season by visiting 
St. Monica on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
With the loss, St. Bernard finishes with a 10-2 league mark and an overall 
record of 21-5. St. Monica, which has second place sewn up, improves to 8-3 and 
18-5. 
</P>
<P>
St. Bernard led most of the first half, but the Mariners took control with a 
9-2 run before intermission to grab a 37-31 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings reclaimed the lead, 46-44, with 2:20 left in the third quarter, but 
it turned out to be St. Bernard's last stand. 
</P>
<P>
St. Monica mounted a 21-4 charge and held St. Bernard to just seven points in 
the final quarter to sew up the victory. Cleveland Jackson punctuated the 
victory with a slam dunk with two minutes left that sent the St. Monica bench 
into a frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
The Mariners attributed the win to pressure defense. 
</P>
<P>
"There was really no special thing that we had to change because we had been 
playing good defense all along," said St. Monica Coach Leo Klemm. "We just kept 
up the pressure." 
</P>
<P>
St. Bernard Coach Jim McClune was visibly disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's entirely possible that all this team wanted was the league championship," 
said McClune, who Sunday morning will learn his team's opponent in the CIF 5-AA 
playoffs. "Maybe some of them think it's time for baseball and track." TIM

Cathedral 55, El Segundo 53 -- El Segundo squandered a 16-point second-half 
lead and the Cathedral Phantoms hit two free throws with nine seconds remaining 
to beat the Eagles in front of a frenzied crowd at Cathedral's Brother Bertram 
Gym in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles finish the regular season 13-10 overall, 9-3 in Santa Fe League 
play. They will finish either tied for second with Cantwell or in third place, 
depending on the outcome of the Cantwell-Cathedral game Friday. Cathedral won 
its second consecutive league title with Wednesday's victory. 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo led, 45-29, with four minutes remaining in the third period but was 
outscored, 26-8, in the last 12 minutes, including 13-6 in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Cathedral's Michael Orozco tied the score at 51 with a layup and then gave the 
Phantoms their first lead of the game at 1:31, 53-51, with another layup. Shawn 
Foster, who led all scorers with 22 points, tied the game with 30 seconds left. 
The Eagles regained possession on a turnover but gave the ball back on a missed 
free throw. Louis Fuentes was fouled with nine seconds to go and made both free 
throws in the one-and-one to give the Phantoms the victory. GREGORY GONZALEZ

WEATHER FORCES SNOWBOUND ALLEN TO DELAY SIGNING

Brian Allen, a Times' All-Valley tight end from Hart High, was forced to 
postpone signing a letter of intent with UCLA on Wednesday because of snow and 
bad road conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll sign Thursday or Friday," Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA assistant coach Ed Kezirian was scheduled to visit Hart and sign Allen, 
who led Valley-area players with 62 receptions and 13 touchdowns. But roads 
leading to the Santa Clarita Valley school were closed Wednesday because of 
snow. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll sign whenever I go back to school," said Allen, 6-foot-4, 225 pounds. 
Allen said that he spent Wednesday sledding and throwing snowballs. 
</P>
<P>
Hart, along with Canyon and Saugus, were closed after three inches of snow 
blanketed the area. 
</P>
<P>
"Funny thing," Allen said, "A little snow and they call off school." VINCE

NORTH HOLLYWOOD CLINCHES CROWN WITH 10TH CONSECUTIVE WIN, 72-53 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dana Jones turned in a command performance and North Hollywood High followed 
his lead to a 72-53 victory over Reseda that clinched the Mid-Valley League 
boys' basketball title for the Huskies on Wednesday at North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, a junior center, recorded game-high totals of 22 points, 14 rebounds and 
seven blocked shots as North Hollywood (14-4, 9-0 in league play) won its 10th 
game in a row and clinched its third consecutive league title. The Huskies 
shared the East Valley League title last season with Grant after winning it 
outright the previous season. 
</P>
<P>
North Hollywood led, 13-10, after one quarter, then outscored Reseda, 25-12, in 
the second period to pull away. The Huskies made 11 of 16 shots during the 
quarter and Jones scored 10 of his 15 first-half points. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Davis and Harry Marks (three three-points baskets) had 14 and 13 points, 
respectively, for North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Coley Kyman scored 19 points and grabbed eight rebounds for Reseda (8-10, 6-3). 
</P>
<P>
Grant 85, Poly 47 -- Powered by a tenacious defense and a sharp-shooting 
offense, Grant clinched the East Valley League title at home. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the eighth in a row for Grant (16-3, 8-1). 
</P>
<P>
Grant blew the game open in the second quarter, outscoring Poly, 18-4, and 
holding the Parrots without a field goal in the period. For the game, the 
Lancers made 60.3% of their field-goal attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Cooper scored a game-high 18 points for Poly (10-9, 5-4). 
</P>
<P>
Birmingham 79, Sylmar 58 -- Glenn Sucich had 17 points, 16 rebounds, four 
assists and five steals for Birmingham in an East Valley League game. 
</P>
<P>
The win, coupled with Poly's loss to Grant, kept alive Birmingham's (8-11, 4-5) 
playoff hopes. If Birmingham defeats Poly on Friday, the Braves and Parrots 
would tie for second place in the league standings, forcing a playoff game next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Sherman Oaks CES 62, Wilson 61 -- Marcus Littlejohn scored 13 of his 32 points 
in the fourth quarter as Sherman Oaks CES rallied to upset the Mules in the 
Northeast League game at Wilson. 
</P>

Westlake 59, Thousand Oaks 58 -- Todd Anderson made a 3-point basket and was 
fouled at the buzzer for Thousand Oaks but failed to capitalize on an 
opportunity to send the game into overtime when he missed the free throw in the 
Marmonte League game at Westlake. 
</P>
<P>
A bench-clearing brawl ensued when a Westlake player taunted Anderson after the 
free throw. 
</P>
<P>
Kurt Schwan scored a game-high 27 points for Westlake (14-9, 7-4). Anderson 
scored 20 points to lead Thousand Oaks (10-12, 5-6). 
</P>

</P>
<P>
Muir 89, Glendale 75 -- Muir overcame 23 points by Glendale's Allen Faalnik in

A COLD FACT CONFRONTS MASTER'S HARRISON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chris Harrison thought that he had escaped. 
</P>
<P>
After spending his college baseball career at Oral Roberts in Tulsa, Okla., and 
coaching last season at Gordon College in Wenham, Mass., Harrison thought that 
athletes were the only flakes he would be dealing with as an assistant coach 
and sports information director at The Master's College. 
</P>
<P>
Then, starting Monday, snowflakes began to appear on the baseball field at 
Master's campus in Newhall. 
</P>
<P>
"We were shoveling ice off the field," said Harrison, who has coached in the 
Netherlands and taken Athletes in Action teams to Czechoslovakia and Poland. 
"Last year in New England we were playing games when the windchill was in the 
20s. This is like New England right now." 
</P>
<P>
Winging it: Joey Kirk has been doing more sitting than scoring this season for 
the Wichita Wings of the Major Indoor Soccer League, but the former Cal State 
Northridge All-American probably will see action tonight when the Wings visit 
the Forum for a game against the Lazers at 7:35. 
</P>
<P>
Kirk, a forward, has been slowed by tendinitis in his left knee. He has played 
in just nine of the Wings' 27 games and scored his first and only point of the 
season a few weeks ago in a game against the Dallas Sidekicks. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been frustrating, sitting in the stands for two months," said Kirk, who 
missed the Wings' first trip to Los Angeles in December. "I should have some 
goals, to tell you the truth. Hopefully, I can get untracked in front of my 
family and friends in L. A." 
</P>
<P>
The Wings are in fifth place in the seven-team MISL. 
</P>
<P>
Bad call: Quite a production was made over the appearance Tuesday of Loyola 
Marymount standout Hank Gathers at Cal State Northridge's home basketball game 
against Cal State Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Drum roll, please. The announcer introduced, "the NCAA's leading scorer and 
rebounder, from Loyola Marymount University, Bo Gathers . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Bo? Wrong. Hank. 
</P>
<P>
Bo would be Bo Kimble, Gathers' teammate at LMU. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of applause, the announcement drew groans. 
</P>
<P>
Hank Gathers was in attendance to watch his brother, Derrick, CSUN's leading 
scorer. 
</P>
<P>
Add Gathers, D.: If he plays to form, expect Gathers to score a lot of points 
for Northridge tonight in its home game against Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
In CSUN's past four games, over a two-week period, Gathers has been 
consistently inconsistent. He had two good shooting performances on Thursdays, 
followed by off nights on Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
On the Thursdays -- against Chapman and Cal Poly Pomona -- Gathers averaged 23 
points and was a combined 15 for 28, including 11 for 20 from three-point 
range. In Saturday games -- against Cal State Dominguez Hills and UC Riverside 
-- he had a 13-point scoring average and totals of nine for 32 and five for 16. 
</P>
<P>
Youth is served: Glendale Coach Brian Beauchemin would have been satisfied if 
his team had left the Ventura gym clinging to a semblance of dignity with which 
it had arrived. 
</P>
<P>
"They're introducing the Ventura lineup and then they introduce ours," 
Beauchemin said. "I'm thinking, holy cow, I hope we can keep this one within 
fifty." 
</P>
<P>
Glendale won, 87-80. 
</P>
<P>
The Vaqueros, composed entirely of first-year players, had finally gelled. Or 
so some of the players thought. 
</P>
<P>
"After the Ventura game I told them, 'It's a great high but don't get too high 
because there's always a low,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
He was a bit more profound than he might have hoped. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale proceeded to lose three consecutive games, including one to hapless 
Santa Barbara, which was 0-6 in Western State Conference play. 
</P>
<P>
"A young team will beat teams you don't expect them to beat and lose to teams 
they should beat," Beauchemin said. "It's the nature of the beast." 
</P>
<P>
Points aplenty: Guard Steve deLaveaga ran his streak of scoring in double 
figures to 77 consecutive games with 34 points for Cal Lutheran against 
Westmont College on Tuesday. But with only five games remaining, deLaveaga will 
not reach the NCAA record of 104, set by Lou Stevens of Widener University in 
Chester, Pa., from 1985-88. 
</P>
<P>
DeLaveaga, a senior, has scored 34 points in each of his past two games. He has 
scored in double figures in every game since Dec. 9, 1986, when he scored 31 
points against Cal Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
More points: Vanessa Hornbuckle, a former Newbury Park High player, set a 
Cuesta College single-game scoring record with 41 points against College of the 
Canyons. Hornbuckle is averaging 24.9 points and is second in the Western State 
Conference in scoring behind Canyons' Tressie Millender, who averages 25.4 
points. 
</P>
<P>
A win the easy way: Moorpark College has picked up a win in basketball by 
forfeit. Salt Lake City, which defeated the Raiders in an early season 
tournament game, had to forfeit the win because it used an ineligible player, 
former Crenshaw High standout John Staggers. Moorpark is 17-10. 
</P>
<P>
Passing fancy: Former Calabasas High quarterback Darren Del'Andrae is following 
in the footsteps of some outstanding passers at Portland State. 
</P>
<P>
Del'Andrae signed with Portland after setting two national junior college 
passing records while at College of Marin. The 6-0, 180-pound junior-to-be 
completed a record 406 passes in 765 attempts for 4,546 yards in his 19-game 
junior college career. 
</P>
<P>
In his last game for Marin, Del'Andrae attempted a record 75 passes, completing 
41. 
</P>
<P>
Del'Andrae is expected to contend for the Vikings' starting position, left 
vacant by All-American Chris Crawford, who completed his eligibility last 
season. Crawford shattered most of the Portland State passing records 
previously held by Phoenix Cardinals quarterback Neil Lomax. 
</P>
<P>
New position: Mark Gieseke, a former Westlake High and College of the Canyons 
standout, has been moved from the outfield to first base at Cal State 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Gieseke, a senior, batted .477 and was an All-American last season. 
</P>

WEBER STATE STAKES CLAIM ON AREA, SIGNS 5 PLAYERS

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What's San Diego State's biggest rival for local high school football talent? 
</P>
<P>
USC? UCLA? Notre Dame? 
</P>
<P>
Hardly. Weber State wound up Wednesday with the same number of San Diego County 
high school football players as SDSU, with five apiece. 
</P>
<P>
What does Weber State have to offer that SDSU doesn't? 
</P>
<P>
"We have three ski resorts here," said Mike Zimmer, Weber State's defensive 
coordinator who was responsible for recruiting in San Diego. "A lot of (the 
athletes) like to ski. (San Diego) has been a real good area for us. The kids 
are real receptive." 
</P>
<P>
There were few surprises Wednesday. Most of the big-name players, such as 
Marcel Brown (Point Loma defensive back), Tamasi Amituanai (Vista defensive 
lineman) and Tyrone Morrison (Morse linebacker) already had made oral 
commitments and signed as expected. Morrison signed with Ohio State, Amituanai 
with Colorado and Brown with USC. 
</P>
<P>
As usual, players from the Palomar League grabbed most of the scholarships, 
with 8 of the 27 San Diego players who signed with colleges. 
</P>
<P>
Indirectly, Vista Coach Dick Haines might be one of the reasons North County 
high schools seem to consistently send more football players to college with 
full-ride scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
Haines set the standards when he first came to Vista 19 years ago, establishing 
off-season programs and weight training. 
</P>
<P>
Now, all schools have these programs. But, as was evident Wednesday, north 
county is still a nose ahead of the pack. 
</P>
<P>
Signings from Palomar League schools included Amituanai and Times' all-county 
selections Cree Morris (Orange Glen quarterback) and Jake Nyberg (Orange Glen 
wide receiver), both headed for San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
Five players from the City Eastern League signed, including Morrison, Brown and 
Times' all-county selection Darrell Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
Five players signed from the Avocado League, including Times' all-county 
selections Junior Moi (Rancho Buena Vista, defensive lineman) and Al Aliipule 
(Rancho Buena Vista, linebacker), who both will attend USC. 
</P>
<P>
USC, with three players signed, finished third behind San Diego State and Weber 
State. 
</P>
<P>
"They expressed strong interest in becoming Trojans," USC Coach Larry Smith 
said of Moi and Aliipule. "And I want people who want to be Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that really attracted us is they're so doggone aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
That leaves Brown. His idol, Smith said, is Ronnie Lott. 
</P>
<P>
"And that's the way he plays," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU Coach Al Luginbill said the Aztecs "were in on Marcel Brown until the end. 
The old white horse ran through the house again." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, SDSU didn't fare badly. Morris, who ranks with Torrey Pines' John 
Lynch as the county's top quarterback, committed to play four more years with 
his high school coach, Dave Lay, who became SDSU's offensive coordinator after 
Luginbill took over for Denny Stolz. 
</P>
<P>
Morris finished second in the state with 3,232 yards passing. He passed for 30 
touchdowns last season. 
</P>
<P>
"To me," Luginbill said, "that's the sign of a quarterback; an individual that 
gets the ball in the end zone." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said this was an above-average year for San Diego prospects. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been recruiting in the San Diego area for about 10 years," he said. "It 
goes up and down. I thought this was a banner year."

SWEETWATER WINS, 61-53, IN BATTLE FOR FIRST PLACE

Arms folded and eyes staring straight ahead, Southwest High School Coach Steve 
Selland could only dream of a rematch. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish we could play them again," Selland said Wednesday night after Southwest 
lost to visiting Sweetwater, 61-53, in what may be remembered as the game of 
the season in the Metro Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Sweetwater Coach David Ybarra stopped short of wishing for a rematch, but said 
the teams could meet again and again, with an eventual victor unlikely to 
emerge. 
</P>
<P>
"We could play 10 more times," Ybarra said, "and we'd probably split five and 
five." 
</P>
<P>
Both teams had much at stake. For fifth-ranked Sweetwater, it was the chance to 
redeem itself from its only loss to Southwest, 61-57, on Jan. 6 at Sweetwater. 
It would also give the Red Devils a chance to take over first place in the 
conference standings. Sweetwater (22-2 overall, 11-1 in conference) is now a 
half-game ahead of third-ranked Southwest (18-6, 10-1). 
</P>
<P>
Sweetwater denied Southwest the victory with a third-quarter 20-11 run that was 
highlighted by Cortez Rice's seven points and Ruben Hernandez's six points. 
</P>
<P>
Add a basket by John Gilbert and the Red Devils had a 37-27 lead with 3:38 
remaining in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"Cortez Rice was the difference for them tonight," Selland said. "He'd take 
those outside shots. My outside shooters just didn't do it." Rice finished with 
19 points. 
</P>
<P>
Southwest came back to within six at the end of the third quarter on a 
controversial goaltending call that made Sweetwater's lead, 42-36. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth quarter, Southwest tied the score, 45-45, with 5:41 remaining, 
when Sweetwater called a timeout. The Red Devils came back with a 9-0 run that 
left Southwest stunned. 
</P>
<P>
Will Tate, who led the Raiders with a game-high 30 points, said Southwest just 
wasn't playing like a team. 
</P>
<P>
"We just couldn't get it together today," Tate said. "Our strength is good 
chemistry, and today we weren't in sync." 
</P>
<P>
Sweetwater held Adalberto Silva, the Raiders' leading scorer, to 12 points. 
</P>
<P>
Said Ybarra: "They had a heck of a defensive game. Anytime they went inside, we 
double-teamed them. They played disciplined." 
</P>
<P>
Sweetwater, which made only 11 for 31 shots in the first half, trailed by 13-10 
after the first period and 25-22 by the end of the second quarter, when 
Southwest employed a spread defense to hold on to its slim lead. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them to keep their composure," Ybarra said. "I told them that the shots 
they were taking were good, they were just missing on a couple." 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Campbell had 16 points for Sweetwater.

FIDELITY FEDERAL WILL BUY RANCHO BERNARDO SAVINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rancho Bernardo Savings Bank has agreed to be acquired by Citadel Holding 
Corp., the parent of Fidelity Federal Savings of Glendale, for $23 a share or 
$6.5 million, Rancho Bernardo Savings Chairman H. M. Darmstandler said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The savings bank's offices in Rancho Bernardo, Escondido and Rancho Penasquitos 
would become Fidelity Federal offices once the proposed acquisition is 
completed late this year, Darmstandler said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed sale must be approved by Rancho Bernardo Savings' shareholders at 
an upcoming meeting. Federal and state regulatory approvals also are required. 
</P>
<P>
Citadel has agreed to pay 1.5 times book value for Rancho Bernardo Savings, 
Darmstandler said. "I think that's very good, given the prices for S&amp;Ls 
these days," Darmstandler said. "Our initial stock price was $10 in 1983, and 
we've had one (20%) stock split, so (shareholders) will be getting close to 
three times what they paid initially." 
</P>
<P>
The savings bank's board accepted Citadel's offer "because quite frankly, we've 
been looking for some way to provide a return to our shareholders," 
Darmstandler said. "I have the feeling that consolidation will be the name of 
the game in coming years." 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Bernardo Savings, which opened for business in 1983, reported a $558,000 
net profit for 1988, down from a $704,000 net profit during 1987. Darmstandler 
linked the profit decline to the opening of a new branch in Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
The savings bank had $124 million in assets on Dec. 31, 1988, up from $110 
million in assets at the end of 1987. Total loans rose to $105 million, up from 
$94 million and deposits rose to $106 million, up from $100 million.

The stock market rally was tripped up by a round of profit taking Wednesday 
that wiped out early gains and left the blue chip index lower. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial index, which rose 26.07 to a post-crash closing high 
Tuesday and advanced about 10 points early Wednesday, ended down 3.93 at 
2,343.21. 
</P>
<P>
New York Stock Exchange volume dropped to 189 million shares from Tuesday's 217 
million. At the same time, advancing issues slightly outnumbered declines in 
NYSE trading. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said early enthusiasm gave way to caution before President Bush's 
budget address to the nation tonight and Friday's inflation report on wholesale 
prices for January. 
</P>
<P>
"We may have to go back one step before we can go ahead," said Mark Tavel, 
Rothschild Asset Management president. "But no matter what the Dow does over 
the next few days, I still have to assume the trend is up." 
</P>
<P>
Traders who execute large orders for institutional investors said they still 
see a willingness to buy stocks on pullbacks. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow's advance Tuesday snapped a four-day retreat and put the blue chip 
index at a post-crash closing high. But an early rally Wednesday was knocked 
down, a sign of how volatile the session would be. 
</P>
<P>
"Anytime there's been a pullback we've seen buying," said a trader at Donaldson 
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp. He noted that the index trimmed half of 
an eight-point decline in the final 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"We still have a decent amount of room on the upside," said Ed Laux of Kidder, 
Peabody &amp; Co. "The onus is on the bears to prove there's something 
radically different in the equation," he added. 
</P>
<P>
But Jack Solomon, technical analyst at Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., said he was 
troubled by the week's activity. "We exceeded a previous high and failed to 
sustain it," he said, noting that the day's pullback and a slackening of 
volume. The Dow hit an early high of 2,360, putting it above the level it stood 
at before its 108.35-point loss Friday, Oct. 16, the session before Black 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Solomon said the technical problems, plus a spurt in takeover rumors, amounted 
to a combination of ingredients that preceded poor markets in the past. He said 
a correction could quickly bring the Dow below 2,300 and set the stage for a 
further pullback into the 2,250 to 2,300 zone. 
</P>
<P>
General Motors shares pulled back 1/2 to 93 3/8 after jumping 4 3/8 Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Other losers among the blue chips included International Business Machines, 
down 5/8 at 127; General Electric, down 7/8 at 47 1/2; Sears Roebuck, down 1 
1/8 at 42 1/4, and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, down 1/8 at 32. 
</P>
<P>
Brokers said traders were also disappointed by recent weakness in the Dow Jones 
index of 20 transportation stocks, which fell 11.81 Wednesday to 1,076.16. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of last week, noted William LeFevre at Advest Inc., the 
transportation index had climbed to within 18 points of the peak close of 
1,101.16 it reached in 1987 before the market crash. 
</P>
<P>
Among the recently hot airline issues, AMR fell 7/8 to 59 5/8, Delta Air Lines 
dropped 1 to 55 3/4, UAL slipped 3/4 to 121 1/2 and NWA edged down 1/8 to 64. 
</P>
<P>
Dayton Hudson, subject of takeover speculation, climbed 1 3/8 to 46 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
The Wilshire index of 5,000 equities finished the day at 2,941.465, down 5.773. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks slipped 0.33 to 
167.69. 
</P>
<P>
Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 1.10 to 345.31; its 500-stock 
composite index was down 0.98 at 298.65. 
</P>
<P>
The NASDAQ composite index dropped 1.22 to 407.97; the American Stock Exchange 
market value index closed at 327.23, up 0.85. 
</P>
<P>
Stock prices soared to yet another new high on the Tokyo Stock Exchange on 
Wednesday as brisk buying shook off some late profit taking. The Nikkei average 
of 225-shares jumped 184.47 to close at an all-time high of 32,065.12. 
</P>
<P>
Share prices on the London Stock Exchange also continued their recent strong 
advance, closing sharply higher. The Financial Times 100-share index ended the 
day up 23.4 at 2,096.2.

ART BUCHWALD: HOW THE GORBACHEVS STRETCH THEIR RUBLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Art Buchwald 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The big Soviet secret is out. The press has revealed that Mikhail Gorbachev 
makes $30,000 a year -- not a princely sum by Donald Trump standards, but 
certainly in the same ballpark as a United States congressman. 
</P>
<P>
Many people are wondering how Mikhail and Raisa live on his pay. One person who 
has the answer is Lem Newsom, a State Department expert on Soviet salaries. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason the Gorbachevs can get by on $30,000 a year," he told me, "is that 
they don't spend anything. And they don't spend anything because there is 
nothing to buy in Moscow." 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to believe," I said. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's say that Raisa wants codfish for dinner, which is selling for 20 rubles 
a kilo. She goes to the store at 8 in the morning and stands in line with the 
other shoppers. At 6 that evening the fish merchant yells, 'No more codfish' 
and slams the door. Raisa goes home and tells Mikhail she just saved another 20 
rubles from the household budget." 
</P>
<P>
Lem continued, "The beauty of the Soviet economy is that everything you could 
possibly spend money on doesn't exist. Therefore, at the end of the year most 
of a Soviet citizen's salary is intact." 
</P>
<P>
"Lenin wanted it that way," I agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"In the State Department we have observed that while his salary is low by 
American standards, Gorbachev has many friends in the Soviet Union just as 
Ronald Reagan does in California. So, if the Gorbachevs need shoes, the head of 
the shoe cooperative in Murmansk will provide them. And if they need mulch, it 
will be delivered gratis within the hour by the mulch commissar of Smolensk 
himself." 
</P>
<P>
"But what about Raisa's clothes?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"While there have been groups critical of Raisa for borrowing expensive clothes 
from Soviet couturiers, her defenders insist that she has started a demand for 
Russian creations that no other Communist first lady ever did before. Even Mrs. 
Khrushchev didn't do as much for fashion as Mrs. Gorbachev has." 
</P>
<P>
"What with the perks and the borrowing, it's hard to believe that any chief of 
a superpower could not make ends meet on $30,000," I added. 
</P>
<P>
Lem said, "I haven't told you the big surprise yet. The one thing that keeps 
the Gorbachevs alive and well is their American Express card. How they got the 
card is a story in itself." 
</P>
<P>
"They agreed to pose for an ad?" I suggested. 
</P>
<P>
"No. The CIA went to American Express and said it wanted the company to issue a 
card to the supreme leader of the Soviet Union. American Express replied that 
it had had very bad luck with Soviet credit. Brezhnev stuck them for three 
airline tickets to Tashkent, and once they had to send a bill collector to 
Moscow to find Kosygin when he stiffed them for 20 dinners in Bulgaria. The 
collector disappeared and was never heard from again." 
</P>
<P>
Newsom continued, "The CIA was adamant that the Gorbachevs receive a credit 
card and told American Express that the agency would guarantee the unpaid 
accounts. American Express put the CIA's name into the computer and it turned 
out that its credit wasn't any better than the Kremlin's. 
</P>
<P>
"Only after intervention from the White House was a card issued to the 
Gorbachevs. Mikhail was surprised to receive it, but Raisa told him not ask any 
questions. So Gorbachev decided to use the American Express card as a test of 
sincere relations between the U.S. and U.S.S.R. 
</P>
<P>
"He told Raisa, 'If we can charge and they don't ask us to pay that means the 
Americans really want glasnost. If they keep demanding the money, we'll know 
that when it comes to arms reduction that they are just faking it.' 
</P>
<P>
"Well, the rest is history. All Gorbachev's American Express bills are paid for 
by the CIA. The arrangement has worked out so well there is talk that if an 
agreement is reached on long-range missiles, Mikhail and Raisa will be issued a 
Gold American Express card -- the highest honor that any country in the Free 
World can bestow on a foreign leader."

In its six years, Transition House, the place that provides the homeless with 
support and tools to make the transition to mainstream society, has had a 63% 
success rate in its program graduates. Thus, the Skid Row Development 
Corporation and Charles C. Reed, president of Ahmanson Services, are asking for 
greater support Feb. 23 at the party they host at the Los Angeles Athletic 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
Skid Row chairman Alden McKelvey and president Martha Brown Hicks hope for 
generous donations, pointing out that Transition House is a permanent solution 
to homelessness, not astopgap. 
</P>
<P>
The cocktail affair will honor Ralphs Grocery Co. Mayor Tom Bradley and 
Councilman Gilbert Lindsay are honorary co-chairmen. Sue Laris, Bruce Corwin, 
Andrea Van de Kamp, Catherine Hearst, Charles Hathaway, Jim Hill, Hugh Loftus, 
Morris Newman, Stephen Mellinger and Norman Dreyfuss are expected to be on

DRIVING FORCE: For two decades customers and friends alike have dashed to San 
Juan Capistrano to see Gep (G. R.) Durenberger's new antiques shipments and 
have tea with the popular antiquarian. When he established Gep's Folie at his 
residence, a folly of a building where he brought the decorative arts leaders 
of the world together for seminars, supporters flocked to his lectures. 
</P>
<P>
Then Durenberger was asked to establish the cultural support for San Juan's 
Michael Graves-designed library; he formed the support group Libros Y Artes 
(Books and Arts). Now, he has given his incredible antiques shop to the city of 
San Juan Capistrano for the new Center for the Study of Decorative Arts he's 
directing. 
</P>
<P>
Friends from around the United States and all over California were in San Juan 
Capistrano last weekend to celebrate with Gep at a black-tie gala and to 
premiere the inaugural exhibition, "California Style: Collectors and 
Collections," which is open to the public Tuesdays through Saturdays until May 
6, when the exhibits change. 
</P>
<P>
Leading the admiring crowd at the opening was Stanley Barrows of New York, dean 
emeritus at Parsons School of Art and former chairman of Interior Design at the 
Fashion Institute of Technology in New York. Gep's old pal from Notre Dame, New 
York and Montecito, designer John Saladino, was in the crowd, bringing Lyn and 
Norman Lear, whose house he's redesigning. Gothic collectors and former 
Pasadenans Jack and Jody Pike, now of San Juan Capistrano, beamed over their 
decorative contributions to the evening. 
</P>
<P>
Party chairman Electa Anderson and Gaye Birtcher, Joyce MacRae, Kay Evans and 
Bettie Auerbach made sure the overflow crowd got juggled. Philip and Sandy 
Jacoby, who are building the Marbella Golf and Country Club, donated $25,000 to 
underwrite the night, creating a lot of fun for everyone including Kay (she was 
chairman of exhibits) and Don Evans, Bud Sampson and Freda Weegar, Tom and Lucy 
Hartford, Harrison Negley, Judy and Steven Smith of La Jolla, Sandi and Tom 
Ewing, Dorothy and Don Koll, Gavin and Ninetta Herbert, John Benecke, Barbara

LEGAL VIEW: WHEN A TENANT LEAVES PROPERTY BEHIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY S. KLEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a landlord, what do you do if your tenant leaves a stereo in his apartment 
after moving out? As a tenant, how do you get back the prized photo album you 
left behind in the duplex you leased? 
</P>
<P>
Not to worry. California law has established a procedure for landlords and 
tenants that is meant to help return all personal property to its rightful 
owner and make sure that the costs of removal and storage are properly paid. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Notifying Tenants 
</P>
<P>
For about 15 years, the California Civil Code has imposed on landlords the 
legal burden of notifying former tenants about any personal property that was 
left behind. If the property is worth less than $300, the landlord may 
eventually be able to destroy it, keep it, or even sell it. If it is worth more 
than $300, the landlord must sell it at a public auction, after first 
publishing a legal notice in a newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
In either case, the landlord must first provide the former tenant with written 
notice that the property has been found. The law even requires the landlord to 
notify anyone else whom he reasonably believes to be the owner of the property. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, if a tenant's friend left a camera in the vacated apartment and 
the landlord knows who that friend is, that person must be notified. The form 
of the notice is set forth in Section 1984 of the California Civil Code. 
</P>
<P>
After receiving the notice, the tenant has 18 days within which to claim the 
property. (It's 15 days if the notice was delivered personally.) Then the 
landlord must "surrender" the property, after the tenant pays reasonable 
storage costs, including any out-of-pocket costs. (Surrender is a legal term. I 
know it sounds like something out of a Grade B cowboy movie, but all it means 
is that the landlord hands over the property, or if it's too heavy to lift, 
lets the tenant arrange for its pickup.) 
</P>
<P>
Don't fight about the amount of storage fees. Attorneys David Brown and Ralph 
Warner warn landlords in their book "The Landlord's Law Book" that it's not 
worth the headache. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just not worth it to get into fights over $75 worth of used books, 
records and tennis sneakers," they write. "If you insist on too high a storage 
charge and the tenant refuses to pay it, you will end up having to keep or sell 
the property. This may result in a tenant suing you and raises the possibility 
a judge may hold you liable for the entire value of the property because your 
storage charge wasn't reasonable in the first place." 
</P>
<P>
That same advice -- don't fight -- goes for tenants too. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Code Provision 
</P>
<P>
This year, a new code provision goes into effect. This requires landlords to 
return abandoned property upon the request of a former tenant. So even before 
the landlord's notice is mailed, or if a landlord neglects to send such a 
notice, a tenant has 18 days after vacating the premises to request in writing 
the return of his forgotten property. Within 5 days, the landlord must provide 
the tenant with a written request for payment of costs, including an 
itemization of all charges. 
</P>
<P>
Upon payment of the costs, the landlord has 72 hours to surrender the property. 
If two people claim ownership of the same property -- say the apartment was 
shared by roommates -- the landlord has to return the property to the first 
person who requests it and is not liable to the other person. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, you can avoid all these complicated legal rules and deadlines if you 
(both tenants and landlords) take a very careful look around the apartment 
before departing for good. 
</P>
<P>
</P>

YOUR WHEELS: SHIFTING INTO REVERSE IS A REAL GRIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I own a 1983 Honda Prelude. Whenever I try to shift into reverse gear 
when the engine is cold, the gears grind. Sometimes, the only way I can get 
into reverse is to put the transmission into reverse before I start the car and 
then disengage the clutch while I start it. I wonder if the car is idling too 
fast or something. Can you suggest anything? -- T.B. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: You could seriously damage your transmission if the grinding is severe, 
so you have to be careful. You may need a new clutch, and you certainly don't 
want to also have to pay for an expensive transmission job. 
</P>
<P>
When you step on your clutch, the transmission is supposed to disengage from 
the engine. If the gears are grinding when you attempt to shift into reverse, 
it means that the transmission has not fully disengaged from the engine and its 
gears are still rotating. 
</P>
<P>
An old trick that is seldom taught any more to eliminate the problem of 
grinding reverse gears is to briefly shift the transmission into any forward 
gear and then quickly shift into reverse. The forward gears should stop all 
shaft rotation in the transmission and allow a smooth engagement into reverse. 
</P>
<P>
The reason you can shift into forward gears and not hear any grinding is that 
forward gears have what are called synchronizers, which allow the gears to 
shift even while the transmission is in motion. But reverse gears do not have 
synchronizers, so if you want to select reverse, the car must be at a complete 
stop and the engine must be fully disengaged from the transmission. 
</P>
<P>
If the trick of shifting into a forward gear doesn't work, you most likely have 
a problem with the clutch. Possibly the clutch plate has warped and does not 
have enough clearance to separate from the flywheel of the engine. 
</P>
<P>
Or the splines on which the clutch plate slides have become dry and rusty, 
preventing the clutch plate from floating away from the flywheel. In either 
case, it is not clear why the problem only occurs when the engine is cold. 
</P>
<P>
Your trick of shifting into reverse before you start the engine is probably 
safe, as long as the clutch is not so seriously flawed that the car tends to 
move even with the clutch depressed. A clutch costs about $350 and usually must 
be replaced every 40,000 to 60,000 miles. 
</P>
<P>
Q: My car is a 1981 Chevy Camaro with a V-6 engine. My problem is difficulty in 
starting in cold weather because the spark plugs are covered with gasoline. A 
mechanic rebuilt the carburetor and replaced the mixing valve, but the problem 
still exists. The car will start if the choke is opened with a clothespin. I 
was told to idle the engine five minutes before starting out. -- S.D. 
</P>
<P>
A: You seem to have a textbook case of a bad choke, and I can't believe your 
mechanic hasn't solved it. If he has not rebuilt the choke, then that should be 
the first order of business. If the choke is rebuilt and still not functioning 
properly, you might have the choke converted to a manual operation with a cable 
that runs into the dashboard. This is a second-rate compromise, but it has got 
to beat the clothespin routine.

Of Such Small Differences by Joanne Greenberg (Henry Holt: $18.95; 262 pages) 
</P>
<P>
In "Of Such Small Differences," Joanne Greenberg, who has such informed empathy 
with people who cannot see or hear, once again guides her readers through their 
separate and acutely sensate world, bringing dimension and illumination 
wherever she goes. 
</P>
<P>
This time, the author of "I Never Promised You a Rose Garden" -- and nine other 
novels, including "In This Sign" (a Hallmark Hall of Fame Christmas special) -- 
expands our understanding of this special population via a love affair between 
a young seeing-hearing woman and a young deaf-blind man whom she meets while 
serving as a volunteer driver for a group of sightless people. 
</P>
<P>
Greenberg (who wrote "Rose Garden" as Hannah Green) has a special gift for 
forging illuminating links between the world of so-called normal people and the 
world of those whose lives have been circumscribed by psychic or physical 
barriers. She excels at describing the inner processes of those whose sight and 
hearing are no longer among their natural resources. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cares for Himself 
</P>
<P>
And after spending time with the inhabitants of both worlds in this wise yet 
unpretentious work, one wonders if our predictable sympathy for the 
shortchanged is misplaced. John, our hero, is a published poet (albeit greeting 
cards at the moment), a thoughtful young man who has a steady job as a 
second-hand clothes-sorter. His priorities are in order, his survival skills 
honed at the hands of demanding teachers and special schools. He prepares his 
own meals, maintains a scrupulously clean and orderly apartment and takes 
parental pride in caring for his cat, who never wants for food, water or 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
He naturally gets immense satisfaction from these accomplishments. He needs 
some help for obvious activities, of course, but, for the most part, John takes 
care of himself, an assignment requiring his undivided attention. 
</P>
<P>
What happens to his attention and how his life changes when he meets Leda the 
actress, an exuberant, all-nourishing earth mother with more than a touch of 
disorder in her personality, supplies the touching ingredients for this 
uncommon love story. 
</P>
<P>
We never know for sure why Leda -- whose unsettled, wanderlust existence has 
been filled with all sorts of men -- falls in love with John. But we suspect 
the reason is her bountiful, giving nature, plus her "propensity," as one of 
her friends tells John in a vicious put-down, "for picking up -- uh. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
But the motive is insignificant to John. He is 25 and more than ready for love. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Talk' to Each Other 
</P>
<P>
They begin living together not long after they meet. Leda is not only a 
passionate but patient teacher in matters sexual but she is skilled at finger 
spelling, which makes their introduction meaningful and allows them to develop 
a relationship that vaguely approximates conventional communication. They are 
able to "talk" together. 
</P>
<P>
Because Leda has lots of friends, John is exposed to more seeing-hearing people 
than ever before. And, in a curious irony, the more he learns about life in the 
sighted world, the more he wonders if he's really missing very much. Life there 
is so complicated and hectic. And, besides, why does Leda seem to miss so many 
clues that inform him of life? After all, she can see and yet she does not see 
as he does! This confuses and irritates him. It is only one of the several 
communication variants that separate their worlds. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, of course, these minor but fundamental distinctions create lesions 
and alter feelings. "It suddenly occurred to John that the world he shared with 
Leda was of a season . . . the relationship had gone on changing in both of 
them; he had not been accepted in the world she occupied and she had not done 
well in his. She was angry at having to be his eyes and ears with his family. 
She wanted things he could not see or hear. He wanted a world she was perhaps 
unable. . . . These truths hit him like a wall in a park." 
</P>
<P>
What happens to their romance is not unlike what happens to a lot of romances 
-- with such small differences that one needs to be reminded they exist.

"The Last Emperor," which swept last year's Academy Awards, and "A Fish Called 
Wanda," a possible candidate in this year's Oscars derby, top the nominations 
for the 1988 film awards from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts. 
The two movies will compete for best picture with Frenchman Louis Malle's 
semi-autobiographical "Au Revoir Les Enfants" and last year's Oscar-winning 
Danish movie "Babette's Feast," by Gabriel Axel. The awards honor films from 
around the world released in Britain during 1988. ALEENE MacMINN

Broadway's Mark Hellinger Theater, long considered one of the best theaters for 
musicals ("My Fair Lady," "On A Clear Day You Can See Forever" and "Jesus 
Christ Superstar" are some that have played there), has been leased by the 
Nederlander organization to the nondenominational Times Square Church. The deal 
is for five years at $1 million a year. James M. Nederlander said it's a 
question of product. "There are no shows. We have to keep the theaters filled. 
We've got the Gershwin (Theater) with nothing in it. We don't have anything on 
the horizon to put in the theater. If I had a show, the show would have gone 
in. In show business, you have to take the first booking," he told the New York 
Times. ALEENE MacMINN

Director John Waters, who once described his movies as "comedies for a special 
audience who think they've seen everything" and who attained cult status as a 
quirky director with "Hairspray" and "Polyester," is giving his scripts, 
scrapbooks, costumes and other memorabilia to Wesleyan University in 
Middletown, Conn. His collection joins that of Clint Eastwood, Frank Crapra, 
Ingrid Bergman and Elia Kazan, among others, who have donated their papers to 
the school's Cinema Archives. "It's a massive collection, and because he is an 
active film maker, it will continue to come to us over the years," said the 
university's archives curator. ALEENE MacMINN

A federal appeals court in New York has altered a lower court's ruling and 
granted a playwright permission to create a musical based on "Amos 'n' Andy" 
radio programs aired before 1948. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, 
however, upheld a portion of the lower court's ruling that allowed CBS Inc. to 
retain copyrights of the show's scripts written after 1948. Playwright Stephen 
Silverman "will now have ample latitude to proceed with his musical," the court 
stated. Silverman had filed suit against CBS (which aired "Amos 'n' Andy" on 
radio and TV from 1928 to 1966) after the network denied him a license to 
create a Broadway musical based on the popular show. CBS said the material 
infringed its copyright and trademarks, including the characters, as well as 
phrases such as " 'Scuse me for protruding," " 'Splain dat," and "Holy 
Mackral." ALEENE MacMINN

A VALENTINE TO BITTERSWEET LOVE IN WESTWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN SULLIVAN, Times Theater Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"One Enchanted Evening" at the Westwood Playhouse has George Ball and Amanda 
McBroom singing some of their favorite love songs, including the one by the 
Gershwin brothers suggesting that most love songs are a lot of blah-blah-blah. 
</P>
<P>
McBroom and Ball have tried to steer clear of those. They have also avoided 
songs about starry-eyed love. Mainly these are ballads of experience. When Ball 
sings Randy Newman's "Marie," Marie is gone. This is what he should have said 
to her. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, McBroom's "My Favorite Year" is lightly dusted with regret. A perfect 
year, but you only get one of them. And if you really examined it, maybe it 
wasn't so perfect. 
</P>
<P>
Being married, Ball and McBroom also tackle married-type love, as in Stephen 
Sondheim's "The Little Things You Do Together" from "Company" -- the neighbors 
you annoy together, children you destroy together. Ah, yes. Ah, well. 
Kiss-kiss. 
</P>
<P>
The show is divided between old songs, middle-aged ones and new ones, many 
written by McBroom. Except for "My Favorite Year," a beauty, the new songs 
don't leave the impression that the old ones do. McBroom spins a spotless "It 
Never Entered My Mind" and Ball sings "Some Enchanted Evening" as if he's 
thinking about the words rather than the sound of his voice, which is 
considerable. 
</P>
<P>
McBroom's voice is also special. She can sing country (most of her own songs 
have that flavor) and she can sing city, and you believe her, even when the 
lyric is only a few steps up from blah-blah-blah. 
</P>
<P>
Concentration is part of it. Ball shares that discipline, and when he puts his 
mind on Jacques Brel's "Mathilde" or Sondheim's "Being Alive," the results are 
fierce. These are singing actors, not merely singers, which makes the show more 
than a concert. 
</P>
<P>
That being true, they need a director. Not a musical director -- Bill Elliott 
and Cathy Rubbico have those duties well in hand. But as a theater piece, "One 
Enchanted Evening" needs focusing and thinking about. 
</P>
<P>
For example: In a show devoted to love songs, doesn't it look a little strange 
for one partner to leave the other partner to entertain the audience, while he 
or she disappears backstage? 
</P>
<P>
McBroom can say that she's changing into a new dress, but what's Ball's excuse? 
We'd feel a bit chilled to attend a party where the host kept going out to the 
garage to work on his car, and that was slightly the effect at the Westwood on 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The selection of songs could also be sharpened. Rather than a pleasant 
potpourri of old and new material, "One Enchanted Evening" could actually find 
a shape -- could, for example, trace the development of a relationship, simply 
in the arrangement of its songs. It's exciting to think what these performers 
could do with a two-person revue that described a real dramatic arc, rather 
than simply proceeding from number to number. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, after their recent dual stint in "Lies and Legends" and 
"Jacques Brel Is. . ." maybe McBroom and Ball just want to relax with this 
show. That's allowed. But it's not the way to create memorable musical theater. 
They'll be at the Westwood Playhouse (10866 Le Conte Ave.) through -- 
appropriately -- Valentine's Day. Information: (213) 208-5454 or (213) 
410-1062.

LANDMARK SURVIVES DESPITE DEVELOPMENT, LIMITED WATER RESOURCES AND COMPETITION 
FROM OTHER CROPS.

<DATELINE>
<P>
THERMAL, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The date palm's elegant silhouette endures here as a desert landmark despite 
decades of encroachment by condominiums, putting greens and swimming pools. 
</P>
<P>
These exotic transplants, brought from North Africa a century ago, remain a 
viable crop in the face of sprawling real estate developments, increasingly 
tight water supplies and the introduction of other, less troublesome crops. 
</P>
<P>
The palms' survival is due primarily to the fact that its silky textured fruit 
with the distinctive caramel, nut-like flavor commands a handsome $3 to $5 a 
pound. But just as important, the Californians who grow virtually all of the 
nation's dates are expert at adapting to the times. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, some growers have become wealthy by selling their date gardens -- the 
proper term for the stands of palms -- to land speculators. But others -- 
forced out by golf courses and time-share developments -- simply relocated. 
</P>
<P>
When displaced from the prime growing areas in and around Palm Desert and 
Rancho Mirage they moved farther south down the Coachella Valley, sometimes far 
afield from the original plantings. 
</P>
<P>
"When you are talking about something as stately as a palm garden and that goes 
down for a golf course or condos then it is quite a change," said Karl 
Killefer, marketing director for California Redi-Date here. "And for the 
locals, that has a real psychological impact." 
</P>
<P>
Change sometimes offers an opportunity to start again. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, in the past five years more than 2,500 acres of the Coachella have 
been planted for the first time with date gardens. The additional acreage has 
more than offset loses incurred during the valley's building boom of the last 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
It is on the lightly traveled side roads, at either end of this town for 
instance, where it's quickly apparent that the date industry is still healthy 
-- producing more improved varieties and imaginative products than in the past. 
</P>
<P>
And the names of the fruit, as always, remain musical: Medjool, Barhi, Kasib, 
Deglet Noor, Zahidi and more than 100 others. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the older, expansive palm gardens spread across lots the size of 
several city blocks. And the rows of carefully groomed trees, some of which 
soar several stories, form a much more inviting landscape than the indigenous 
sagebrush and sand. 
</P>
<P>
These settings, framed by the rugged San Jacinto Mountain Range to the west, 
recall the fictional oases of desert lore. And the scene takes on a dream-like 
quality whenever a gentle, winter wind rustles the countless palm fronds into 
their distinctive whisper. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, Southern Californians, who have traveled to the area 130 miles south 
of Los Angeles, can fondly recall their first taste of these subtly sweet 
fruits. Or remember, as vividly, sipping a date shake at one of several 
roadside stands that offer the rich drinks. Over the years the National Date 
Festival, scheduled to begin Feb. 17, has also brought the fruit to the 
attention of many. 
</P>
<P>
"People have come here for 30, 40 years and the children pick up where the 
parents leave off," said Ed Kirby, owner of Valerie Jean Date Garden on Highway 
86, the desert's oldest roadside stand and gift shop. "Even truckers will 
regularly stop by and get a package of dates just to eat on the road." 
</P>
<P>
And it is to these visitors, as well as life-long residents, that news of the 
date growers' current fate is welcome. 
</P>
<P>
To many of Mediterranean ancestry, dates are prized as a treat for special 
occasions. Others, who learned of the fruit here in the desert, went onto 
introduce them to children and grandchildren as a natural snack or as 
ingredients in baked goods and other dishes. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles' proximity and ethnic diversity made it the logical choice as the 
industry's leading marketplace. And it is; followed closely by San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Growers and processors hope this regional audience will expand as their crop 
benefits from its nutritional profile, one that is high in dietary fiber and 
potassium while being fat-free despite the syrupy, seductive taste. 
</P>
<P>
"Dates are a high-fiber fruit and we just need to get that across," said David 
Marguleas, merchandising manager for Sun World, which markets 30% of the 
state's $17.9-million crop through its Sun Date subsidiary. "They are riding a 
wave of popularity and consumption is going up. We're also hoping that dates 
will follow raisins and prunes in terms of consumer preference." 
</P>
<P>
Area growers are trying to latch onto the dried-fruit bandwagon, but in a 
modest way. The industry's promotional literature features a cartoon character 
in the form of a date. As the nation now knows, a somewhat similar theme was 
used to make California's raisins famous. 
</P>
<P>
"The date industry is experiencing the first good sales season in probably the 
last five or six years, " said Killefer. "Several years ago we lost the 
consumer. This is the first year we have begun to turn that around. Dates are 
accepted more as a versatile food, a convenient food for recipes. And the 
nutritional value of dates is well documented. We're working hard at promoting 
that." 
</P>
<P>
According to the California Date Administrative Committee, about 200 growers 
harvested 5,000 acres of date palms this past year, or 95% of the U.S. total. 
Other growing areas include the Imperial Valley and parts of Arizona. With the 
last fruit picked in January, the season's crop is expected to total about 34 
million pounds, even with the 1987-88 growing season. 
</P>
<P>
"As it is, the amount of dates produced fits nicely with the number of dates 
consumed," said Marguleas. But when the young trees planted in recent years 
begin coming on line, then new markets will be needed. 
</P>
<P>
And as several food companies have found, capturing the interest of consumers 
can be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Most people have heard of dates but would be hard pressed to identify one, says 
Peggy Hartsock with Oasis Date Garden. 
</P>
<P>
"When I go to food shows and display our products people always come up to me 
and ask, 'Are these figs?' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
Explaining to the uninitiated how dates grow on palm trees is similarly 
challenging. 
</P>
<P>
The process is labor intensive. It's precarious as well for those who must care 
for the gardens and are required to climb each tree about a dozen times a year. 
These workers are even honored for their agility and skill with a special 
title: Palmoros. 
</P>
<P>
 At this time of year, the growers concern themselves primarily with cleaning 
the date gardens and pruning after the recently concluded harvest. 
</P>
<P>
In the next few weeks, workers will begin removing the blossoms from the male 
trees and extracting the pollen. Once enough of the powdery white substance is 
accumulated, Palmoros will, once again, climb the female date palms and hand 
pollinate those trees' blooms. 
</P>
<P>
In some of the older date gardens, wooden ladders are permanently attached to 
the top of the palms. The ladders grow with the tree and enable workers to 
reach the taller fronds, some of which are as high as 70 feet. 
</P>
<P>
A mature palm will grow 15 to 18 bunches of dates. Each cluster, when the fruit 
has reached the size of a pea, must be protected with brown paper covers to 
ward off birds and rain. 
</P>
<P>
As they begin to ripen from October through January, the Palmoros again climb 
each palm and remove the bunches for processing. On average, an adult tree will 
yield between 200 and 300 pounds of fruit. 
</P>
<P>
On some of the more prized varieties, such as the Medjool, the workers climb 
the palms three times during the typical harvest and hand pick only those fruit 
that have reached their peak. 
</P>
<P>
After harvest, the dates are rinsed and then sorted according to quality, 
moisture content and size. The best fruit goes into the fresh market and the 
lesser grades are diverted into processed items such as confections. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the labor costs, date gardens require excessive amounts of water, even 
for this heavily irrigated valley. On average, most gardens are flooded every 
seven to 10 days during the growing season. 
</P>
<P>
As Hartsock explains the process: "Date palms thrive with their toes in the 
water and their heads in the sun." 
</P>
<P>
Only in the past few years has the industry, led by Sun Date, adopted drip 
irrigation, which lessens the amount of water used and more efficiently applies 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Planting citrus trees, primarily grapefruit, between each palm has also made 
better use of the land and water resources. 
</P>
<P>
But if there is any significant change occurring in the cultivation of the 
dates then it is the emergence of the Medjool, which originated in Morocco. 
This is the largest variety, darker in color and with a more sophisticated 
flavor. Although the Deglet Noor comprises about 85% of the date acreage, many 
of growers are paying increased attention to the higher-priced Medjool. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time the industry has come to terms with the changing nature of the 
Coachella Valley, increased its efficiency and expanded marketing efforts, it 
has also become disenchanted by the festival that carries its name. 
</P>
<P>
Several growers said they no longer participate in the National Date Festival 
in Indio because the event has lost sight of its namesake. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't anything more than a county fair," said Killefer, "except that it has 
camel rides." 
</P>
<P>
Marguleas of Sun World said his company has not participated in the festival 
for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
"Unlike the Garlic Festival in Gilroy or the Artichoke Festival in Castroville, 
the Date Festival gives very little prominence to dates. It's just the way the 
organizers have approached it," he says. 
</P>
<P>
No one, however, gets too heated about the issue. The desert life's slow pace 
encourages a general acceptance of things as they are. 
</P>
<P>
Kirby, of Valerie Jean, says as much: "There aren't many problems at present. 
But that could change if they start putting in lots of polo fields and things 
like that." 
</P>

Stuffed dates, date-nut bread, date shakes, Waldorf salad with dates -- you 
would expect to find these old-timers in a collection of recipes dealing with 
the sweet fruit of the date palm. But times have changed considerably, and 
contemporary chefs are using the date in innovative ways. 
</P>
<P>
Chef Antonio Jimenez of Cafe Cafe in Westwood adds dates to peanut sauce for 
linguine and spices the unusual mixture with Thai red curry paste. Hugo Molina 
of the Parkway Grill in Pasadena simmers dates with raspberry vinegar, Port, 
cream and shallots to make a rosy sauce for sliced duck breast. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Pigozzi, executive chef of the Biltmore Hotel, has a couple of ideas that 
will come in handy for future holiday seasons as well as for special occasions 
now. Individual molded souffles that blend wild rice, dates and celery root 
make a dressy addition to a dinner plate. The date and apricot stuffing that 
Pigozzi suggests for pork chops and game should also work well with poultry. 
</P>
<P>
The only note of tradition is Georgian chicken with dates, a family recipe from 
Fred Powers, the proprietor of Gorky's Cafe and Russian Brewery. The chicken 
simmers with vegetables, wine and other ingredients in a sauce that is lightly 
sweetened with sugar and dates. 
</P>
<P>

FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF NUTRITION, THE EIGHT ESSENTIAL 
AMINO ACIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JEAN MAYER and JEANNE GOLDBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The caricature of early man is of a brawny fellow with a huge club, dressed in 
animal skins and gnawing on a bone. While it's true that our ancient ancestors 
did engage in hunting, we know they were not the carnivores portrayed in 
cartoons. 
</P>
<P>
Roots, berries, leaves, nuts, eggs and fruits were staples of their diet. And 
such game as they did catch was far leaner than the farm-grown meats we eat 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The 20th-Century stereotype of cave men perpetuates the myth that meat is 
power. Eating large quantities is linked in many people's minds to surging 
growth, bulging muscles and athletic prowess. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, meat is rich in protein and is a vital nutrient. Carbohydrates, 
fats and proteins can all provide us with energy, but only protein has the 
capacity to build, repair and maintain the body's tissues, including those in 
the kidneys, liver and skin. Proteins are components of enzymes and of certain 
hormones, and are needed to make blood cells and infection-fighting antibodies, 
as well as for growing hair and nails. Proteins are part of the carpentry that 
helps keep the body erect; it is the grout that holds the cells together. 
</P>
<P>
Like other constituents of the body, proteins eventually get used up and must 
be replaced. The body constructs its own proteins from those in the foods we 
eat. Every animal, vegetable or microbe has special types of proteins, so there 
are countless kinds, designed to meet the needs of particular organisms. These 
millions of proteins are all formed from only 20 different building blocks -- 
amino acids -- put together in different ways, just as words are made from the 
alphabet or structures from a Lego set. 
</P>
<P>
Our body's task is to take the proteins of other organisms and transform them 
into types we can use to repair and maintain our cells. By breaking down the 
proteins in foods into their component amino acids, and then reassembling them, 
our bodies can manufacture some of the amino acids and from them some of the 
proteins. These are called "nonessential" because we do not have to get them 
ready-made in foods. 
</P>
<P>
But there are eight amino acids we cannot make from raw materials and that must 
be included in our diets. These "essential amino acids" have to be present in 
the foods we eat or we will be placed in nutritional jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
Here's where meat comes in. Animal foods most closely resemble the proteins in 
our bodies. They contain all the amino acids in the right proportions, which 
makes them "of highest biologic value." A smaller, overall amount of protein of 
high biological value will give us the same amount of amino acids (and thus 
overall usable protein) as a large amount of a "poor" protein, like those in 
plant foods. 
</P>
<P>
Does that mean we should don cave-man clothes and go out hunting for meat? 
Absolutely not. While meat certainly provides generous amounts of amino acids, 
we don't need to depend exclusively on high-quality proteins (some of which are 
laden with fat and/or cholesterol) to meet our amino-acid needs. Habitually, we 
eat a variety of foods containing proteins of differing qualities. The daily 
Recommended Dietary Allowance is 56 grams (or two ounces) of pure protein for a 
man and 46 grams (1.6 ounces) for a non-pregnant, non-nursing woman. 
</P>
<P>
These quotas are not that hard to fill. One cup of milk, for instance, has nine 
grams of protein. An ounce of ground beef has seven, an egg has six, and one 
tablespoon of peanut butter, four. A woman, then, can get nearly 40% of her 
protein requirement from two cups of milk. Add an egg and three ounces of meat, 
fish or poultry, and she'll have all the protein she needs for the day. 
</P>
<P>
Many other foods are also good protein sources. A half-cup of oatmeal has three 
grams, as does one slice of whole-wheat bread. A cup of spinach has five grams, 
a stalk of broccoli six. One medium baked potato has three grams -- and the 
quality is impressive too. 
</P>
<P>
A very small amount of protein of high quality that contributes the missing 
essential amino acids can be mixed in to upgrade the quality of "poor" 
proteins. For instance, cereals are generally low in the amino acid lysine, 
whereas milk contains ample amounts. When we pour milk on breakfast cereal, we 
create a complete protein. 
</P>
<P>
A meal that supplements rice with beans or combines the two with small portions 
of fish, poultry or other meat is an excellent model of this mutual 
supplementation of protein. 
</P>
<P>
Simply by virtue of the variety of foods consumed, the typical American diet 
provides all the protein -- and thus the essential amino acids -- we require, 
and more. So if you eat a varied diet, your protein profile is one thing you 
need not worry about. 
</P>
<P>
Don't Depend on Herb Teas as Substitutes for Medical Care 
</P>
<P>
Question: I have a friend who insists that in the interests of my health I 
should switch from regular tea and coffee to herb teas. Is this really 
necessary? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: From our perspective, a more sensible course might be to use all three 
in moderation. While herb teas may convey a sense of the "natural" (though they 
are no more so than coffee or tea), the fact is that herbs contain a variety of 
compounds that are extracted when the herbs are steeped in hot water. Some of 
these compounds are potentially harmful. 
</P>
<P>
Drinking herb teas to avoid the known effects of caffeine may expose 
individuals to chemicals about which we know far less. Moreover, herb teas have 
not been subjected to animal studies that simulate the effects of drinking tea. 
</P>
<P>
And despite claims of benefit in the popular press, it is never a good idea to 
depend on herb teas as substitutes for medical care. 
</P>
<P>
Q: For the most part we eat plain fruit for dessert, but every few weeks I bake 
a fruit tart as a special treat. I would prefer to make the crust out of oil 
instead of solid shortening, but so far have been unable to find a recipe. 
Since I don't have time to experiment on my own, can you help me out? 
</P>
<P>
A: We can. For a simple crust, mix 1 1/3 cups flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/3 cup 
oil and three tablespoons cold milk. Then mix and roll. 
</P>
<P>
In a study done several years ago, trained panelists found that vegetable oils 
produced better flavor and more flakiness than crust made with solid 
shortening. No color differences among the crusts were detected, and the only 
negative observation was that crusts made with solid shortening shrunk less 
than the ones made with vegetable oils. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have been put on diuretic medication and advised to eat lots of fruits and 
vegetables to get extra potassium. Can you provide me with specific information 
about how to get good sources into my diet? 
</P>
<P>
A: A large glass of orange juice and a banana sliced over breakfast cereal are 
two good ways to build up your potassium intake. But there are many more. Among 
the best vegetable sources are winter squash, dandelion and mustard greens, and 
cooked kidney beans. Baked potatoes provide generous amounts, and so do sweet 
potatoes, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, corn, beets, summer 
squash and spinach. In addition to oranges and bananas, fruits that contain the 
greatest amounts include cantaloupe, watermelon and grapefruit. 
</P>
<P>
And remember that other fruits and vegetables may not contribute as much, but 
they do add to the total. So the advice to eat plenty of fruits and vegetables 
of all types really is the key to ensuring that you get your needed potassium, 
along with goodly amounts of other vitamins and minerals.

MICROWAVE . . .: FUDGE TREAT COOKS AT NEAR-SUPERSONIC SPEED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN ANDERSON and ELAINE HANNA, Anderson and Hanna are nutritionists and 
cookbook authors specializing in microwave cookery. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Remember the good old days when folks gathered in the kitchen on cool nights to 
pull taffy and dip apples in caramel? And how it seemed to take forever for the 
candy to cook? 
</P>
<P>
Our microwave Valentine's Day sweets cook with near supersonic speed. Best of 
all, they're easy enough for children to make. But do caution them to be 
careful. Hot caramel and chocolate are nothing to kid around with. 
</P>
<P>
There's no point in trying to microwave classic fudge or fondant, caramels or 
taffy, which must be cooked to just the right temperature, because you'll be 
opening the oven door constantly to check on their progress. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dangerous to Move 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, these old-fashioned candies don't really cook much faster by 
microwave than they do on top of the stove, and they bubble and boil so 
furiously they can be dangerous to move, especially if your oven is placed at a 
high level such as above your range or counter. So reserve these family 
favorites for the top of the stove. 
</P>
<P>
The microwave does excel, however, at short-cut candies that involve little 
more than melting chocolate or caramel. It can even be used to boil up a 
terrific nut brittle -- and from scratch, at that. The recipes that follow have 
all been developed especially for the microwave oven and if you follow them to 
the letter, you should succeed every time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
6-MINUTE CHOCOLATE CHIP-PECAN FUDGE 
</P>
<P>
1 (1-pound) box powdered sugar, sifted 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup butter or margarine, cut in small pieces 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup half and half 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon vanilla 
</P>
<P>
Dash salt 
</P>
<P>
3/4 cup semisweet chocolate pieces 
</P>
<P>
3/4 cup coarsely chopped pecans or walnuts 
</P>
<P>
Combine sugar, cocoa, butter, half and half, vanilla and salt in 2-quart 
casserole. Microwave, uncovered, on HIGH (100% power) 2 to 2 1/2 minutes, 
stirring after 1 minute, until bubbling. 
</P>
<P>
Beat mixture until smooth, mix in chocolate pieces and nuts and spread evenly 
in well buttered 8-inch square pan. Cool, chill until firm, then cut in 1-inch 
squares. Makes 64 squares. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PEANUT BRITTLE 
</P>
<P>
1 cup sugar 
</P>
<P>
1/3 cup light corn syrup 
</P>
<P>
1 1/4 cups roasted blanched peanuts 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon butter or margarine 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon vanilla 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon baking soda 
</P>
<P>
Combine sugar and corn syrup in 2-quart measure or casserole and microwave, 
uncovered, on HIGH (100% power) 4 minutes, stirring at half time. 
</P>
<P>
Mix in peanuts and butter and microwave, uncovered, on HIGH 3 1/2 to 4 minutes 
until pale brown. Quickly stir in vanilla and soda. 
</P>
<P>
Pour onto buttered baking sheet and spread as thin as possible with buttered 
metal spatula. For extra thin brittle, cook 4 to 5 minutes, then pull and 
stretch with buttered fingers (mixture should be pliable). When cold, crack 
into pieces. Makes about 3/4 pound. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NUTTY CARAMEL APPLES 
</P>
<P>
1 (14-ounce) package vanilla caramels 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons water 
</P>
<P>
4 wood skewers 
</P>
<P>
4 medium red apples, washed, dried and stemmed 
</P>
<P>
1/3 cup chopped walnuts or pecans 
</P>
<P>
Microwave caramels with water in 1-quart measure on HIGH (100% power) 3 to 3 
1/2 minutes, stirring every minute. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, insert skewers in stem ends of apples. 
</P>
<P>
When caramels are melted, stir until smooth. Dip apples into caramel to coat 
evenly, then roll in nuts. Cool on wax paper until caramel hardens. Makes 4. 
</P>
<P>
Note: In ovens of less than 600 watts, increase cooking times about 15%.

BACK TO BASICS: TURNING DOUGH FOR RIGHT CRUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last week's Back to Basics column covered the beginning steps in making pie 
crust -- cutting the shortening into flour combined with salt, adding water and 
forming the pastry into a ball. The pastry was then ready to be rolled out or 
chilled from 30 minutes to two days. 
</P>
<P>
Some sources claim that chilling tenderizes the dough, makes it easier to 
handle and helps minimize shrinkage during baking; others feel it makes little 
difference. Dough that has been refrigerated for an extended period, however, 
should be removed about an hour before being shaped so it reaches room 
temperature. 
</P>
<P>
We recommend using a pastry cloth on a smooth surface and stockinette (or 
stocking) cover over a revolving rolling pin. A board, marble slab or Formica 
countertop and other types of rolling pins may be used, however, if preferred. 
Working quickly in a cool area will aid in keeping the pastry dough tender and 
flaky. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Little Flour 
</P>
<P>
Lightly flour both the work surface and rolling pin, rubbing well into both so 
the flour keeps the pastry from sticking but does not get incorporated and 
toughen the dough. Flatten the dough ball into a round, thick disk without 
cracks in the sides (Photo 1). 
</P>
<P>
Lightly roll the dough from the center out in all directions, with short, 
smooth strokes (Photo 2). Try to keep the pastry round, without any ragged 
edges. Repair breaks in the edge by pressing the dough together with your 
fingertips. Lift and rotate the dough periodically to keep it from sticking to 
the surface. 
</P>
<P>
The goal is to roll the pastry into a circle about two inches larger in 
diameter than the inverted pie plate it will fill and one-eighth-inch thick. 
When rolled thin enough, only a slight imprint will remain when the dough is 
touched lightly with a finger. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Transfer the Dough 
</P>
<P>
To transfer the dough into the pie plate, lightly roll it around the rolling 
pin, then unroll over the pie plate (Photo 3). Center the pastry and gently 
ease it into the pan, being careful not to stretch the pastry or it will shrink 
during baking. 
</P>
<P>
Press the pastry against the pie plate with your fingers to remove any air 
pockets. Trim the pastry hanging over the edge of the pie plate with scissors 
(Photo 4) or a sharp knife, leaving about an inch to fold under and flute. 
</P>
<P>
Any tears may be repaired by pressing the dough together with your fingertips 
or patching with trimmings. Future Back to Basics columns will be devoted to 
methods of fluting the edges and making double-crust and lattice-topped pies.

LET'S EAT OUT: EUROPA: DELI IDEA WHOSE TIME HAS COME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE DOSTI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Don't get excited yet. We're going to talk about a sandwich shop that you may 
never see, or even visit unless you found yourself standing on the corner of 
3rd and Spring streets one day wondering where to go and what to do. 
</P>
<P>
I'll heartily recommend a sandwich at Europa, if you are ever stuck for an idea 
on Spring and 3rd. Or should television nights inspire a sandwich party. You'll 
get the best ham, salami, mortadella, capocollo, smoked ham, pepperoni, Italian 
salami, turkey, mozzarella, Provolone and American cheese sandwich on Italian 
or Persian bread in the Downtown area, bar none. 
</P>
<P>
You'll also get one of the biggest and best six-foot submarines you'll ever 
want to serve a crowd. With the six-footer you also get six pounds of potato 
salad free, all for $49.99. There are also "Godmother" sandwiches 
(three-footers) and the less cumbersome "Godson" sandwiches, a two-foot-long 
sandwich meant for stevedores. Those sandwiches come with free potato salad 
too. Order them to go for a party sometime only if you feel like trekking 
downtown to pick up an order. They don't deliver beyond a five-mile radius. 
</P>
<P>
As for the pizza and spaghetti, they're so bad they are good. They're the kind 
of pizza and spaghetti you enjoy as leftovers from the pizza or spaghetti you 
had the night before, except that Europa's tastes like the night before version 
without a wait. They'll zap it in the microwave for you for an extra rubbery 
effect. Frankly, I rather like pizza and spaghetti that way now and then. I 
love chewy, bleary-eyed, day-after, pizza and spaghetti. There is something 
terribly homey about it. 
</P>
<P>
But that is not what we are talking about, either. 
</P>
<P>
Europa Deli happens to be an institution for people working in the buildings 
throughout the downtown area. They have known and enjoyed Europa's presence 
since it began as a grocery store in 1913. 
</P>
<P>
If the walls could only talk. My, my. The clientele? They are our city's finest 
-- law enforcement officers from top to bottom echelons at nearby Parker 
Center, who park their vehicles on the red zone in front of the delicatessen 
for a quick bite with colleagues. Bank officers from the numerous banks in the 
area stand there, whispering professional secrets between puffs of the cigar, 
against the backdrop of Godfather, Godmother and Godson sandwiches in the 
making. 
</P>
<P>
Times employees -- pressmen, reporters and editors alike, have walked the few 
short blocks on Spring Street to Europa for a filling lunch, mid-morning or 
after snack, or maybe as an excuse to walk off a worry or gripe, or maybe work 
out a story in their heads. State and county employees have been seen with box 
loads of cold-cut trays to take up to their quarters for an impromptu party or 
an after-hours feed. Many office lovers' rendezvous have been traced to 
Europa's tables, where half-eaten sandwiches and unfinished beverages tell all. 
But who's telling? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Grocery at First 
</P>
<P>
I, myself, have used the deli on occasions too numerous to name: during Food 
Section photo sessions, when I've had to rush out and pick up a missing 
ingredient for one of our photographed dishes. I've stopped to buy filo dough 
when company was expected, and to stock up on Bulgarian feta cheese that, in 
the old days, was not easy to find elsewhere. I've picked up Italian, French 
and Persian bread so fresh I've succumbed to the temptation of breaking off and 
eating most of it even before reaching home. 
</P>
<P>
Europa began as an import Italian grocery store. Originally, its owner, who 
went by the name Dante, sold such things as loose pastas of numerous shapes and 
sizes, cheeses, olives and olive oils from Italy, which you can still find in 
bins. Since taking over 15 years ago, however, Albert Mansour, whose heritage 
is French-Italian, and his wife, Abby, have turned Europa into an international 
import market offering olives, dolmas and tarama (caviar) from Greece, stuffed 
grape leaves, tahini and foul (fava beans) from Lebanon, wines and cheese from 
France and Spain, olives from Peru, dry fish from Norway, pistachios from Iran, 
plus a bevy of Middle Eastern pastries such as bourma, baklava, kadaif and filo 
dough, which come from local Greek bakers and are sold by the piece or the pan. 
The flat Persian bread comes from a local bakery daily, as well. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, Europa was a dreary, pathetically undecorous place, with 
inventory too sparse to be enticing. It got its lift when the women -- wife and 
friends of the owner -- came to help out. It was the women who put some color 
and charm into the place, with their bright faces, habits of cleanliness and 
the addition of checkered tablecloths and tables when they moved a few doors 
down to its present corner spot on Third Street. 
</P>
<P>
It was the women, too, who helped introduce the pizza and spaghetti, such that 
it is. But it works and no one is complaining much -- I suppose. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sandwiches a Mainstay 
</P>
<P>
Sandwiches, however, have been the mainstay of the place since its beginnings. 
At the break of noon in the old days when no refrigeration was available, 
sky-high piles of flat bread and cold-cut fillings for Europa's "combo 
special," selling at 49 cents, graced the counter, waiting for customers, who 
were sure to arrive in droves. 
</P>
<P>
Today, with a refrigerated counter, customers can see the display of cold cuts 
and make selections for combinations of their choice. You still get a lunch 
time combo special consisting of ham, turkey, cheese, pepperoni and salami for 
$1.50. A Europa special made with pastrami, roast beef, capocollo, mortadella, 
Italian salami, turkey, pepperoni and cheese costs $2.50. A great sandwich for 
the price. It would be a great sandwich at any price. In fact, it's priceless. 
Like Europa. 
</P>
<P>

THE BUTCHER: POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS WHEN YOU BUY A WHOLE, CURED PICNIC HAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MERLE ELLIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cooking style has changed a good bit around our house in the past few years, 
largely because there are no longer as many people around the table at dinner 
time. We used to be a clan of four or six or eight, what with parents and 
children and the hungry friends of children. Today, we are usually only two or 
three, except on special occasions when there may be as many as 20, what with 
parents and children and friends of children, and lovers of children and 
children of friends, and lovers of children of friends -- you know what I mean. 
Anyway, most of the time we're not as many around the table as once we were. 
</P>
<P>
Now you might think that fewer people around the table would have changed my 
wife's shopping habits. Cooking habits? Yes. Shopping habits? No. Neva still 
buys meat as if she were cooking for a crowd -- if the price is right, that is. 
It is not at all unusual for me to walk into the house to be greeted with a 
kiss, a hug and a sensual whispered request such as: "Honey, there are six 
chickens in the refrigerator. They were on sale. Would you cut them up and 
package them for me before dinner?" Or, "Honey, Petrini's had a great special 
on pork loin roasts. I got a couple -- do something with them, will you, 
please?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stocking Up on Ham 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the years I have encouraged her to be on the lookout for, and take 
advantage of, meat specials like that, and I am delighted that she does. It 
saves us a fortune on our grocery bill and we eat well. I have also instructed 
her many times on the "how to" of cutting up a chicken and boning out a pork 
loin roast and all the other money-saving how-to techniques we've talked about 
in this column. Yet she doesn't do any of those things. "Honey," she coos, "why 
do you think I married you?" 
</P>
<P>
Ham was her most recent good buy. Picnic ham at 79 cents a pound. She bought 
one for more than six pounds and the price was more than $5. "Do something with 
this, will you, honey," she said, putting her large acquisition on the kitchen 
counter. "I don't want to cook all this at once." 
</P>
<P>
Picnic ham is the cured and smoked front leg of a pig. It has a bit larger 
ratio of bone and fat to lean meat than ham from the hind leg and for that 
reason is always much less expensive and often a very good buy. They are 
usually, however, sold whole, and so often ignored by anybody not cooking for a 
crowd. Never pass by a good buy on picnic ham. There are so many things to do 
with one, even if you're only cooking for one -- or two -- or three. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the meat on a picnic ham lies on one side or the other of the leg bone 
that runs from the hock at the small end to the shoulder joint at the wide end. 
It's a simple matter to run a boning knife along each side of the bone from the 
hock to the shoulder, removing two good-sized pieces of boneless ham from which 
to make all manner of meals. Bake one piece for a small ham dinner with perhaps 
only a ham sandwich or two left over. Slice or dice the other for a ham and 
potato casserole, ham and eggs or a grilled ham-and-cheese sandwich. 
</P>
<P>
Trim the remaining meat off the top and bottom of the bone to cut into cubes 
for creamed ham on toast or to grind for a delicious ham salad spread. The bone 
and hock are ideal for flavoring a pot of red beans and rice, or split pea 
soup. The possibilities are endless.

L.B. AIRPORT TOLD TO ADD 14 FLIGHTS TO DAILY SCHEDULE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
LONG BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city is preparing to tackle the task of implementing two orders from a 
federal judge that will affect people who live near Long Beach Airport. 
</P>
<P>
The first requires that airport noise be spread around to neighborhoods not 
previously affected. The second, issued this week, requires the city to allow 
14 more flights a day, 
</P>
<P>
The city is also considering limiting noise by restricting non-commercial jets, 
in keeping with the federal court ruling, according to a lawyer for the city. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Laughlin Waters, who Monday ordered the number of daily 
flights increased to 40, has told the city that it cannot stop noise by 
limiting flights. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to impact noise, you've got to spread it, not stop it. That's 
implicit" in the judge's order, said attorney Lee L. Blackman, who is 
representing the city in airport litigation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Add to Noise 
</P>
<P>
That means making greater use of an east-west runway by smaller jets, Blackman 
said. Depending on how it is implemented, such a move would potentially add to 
aircraft noise in Signal Hill, the northern section of the Wrigley area and 
part of the west side if aircraft follow a route above the northbound San Diego 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
But it would shift some of the additional noise away from neighborhoods to the 
northwest. At present, virtually all aircraft take off over California Heights, 
Bixby Knolls and North Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The city may also restrict use of the airport by older-model executive jets 
that fail to meet the latest noise standards, Blackman said. 
</P>
<P>
Waters noted that the airport is failing to make full use of its shorter 
east-west runway when he ruled last November that the city has been too 
restrictive in accommodating airline flights. 
</P>
<P>
The judge said city officials could take steps to handle more flights without 
abandoning efforts to control aircraft noise. He ordered the airlines and city 
officials to try working out an agreement to raise the number of flights, which 
had been set at 26 a day. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the judge increased the number of commercial flights to 40 a day 
after the city and the airlines failed to come to terms. The city had proposed 
32 flights; the airlines wanted 53. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the decision, attorneys said they believe that a daily limit -- 
imposed by the judge in November -- of 25 short-hop commuter flights will be 
lifted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
City's Rights Voiced 
</P>
<P>
The limit seems unnecessary because commuter airlines had not been using their 
entire allotment of flights, and their propeller-powered planes are generally 
quieter than commercial jetliners. 
</P>
<P>
Blackman disagreed with the judge's decision to increase the number of 
commercial flights by 14 a day. "We believe the city is entitled to regulate in 
the interest of environmental quality," Blackman said. 
</P>
<P>
John J. Lyons, one of the key attorneys representing the airlines, said he was 
"somewhat disappointed" that Waters did not allow more than 40 flights a day. 
He said the additional flights should start as soon as the city divvies them up 
among the airlines. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney who represented homeowners opposed to aircraft noise said the 
judge's increase appears to be a "fair compromise" between city and airline 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, the homeowners would not like to see any increase in flights, but . 
. . I think (40 daily flights) is a fair, middle-ground position," said 
attorney Michael A. Thurman, who represented Houses Under Stress &amp; Hazard 
in court proceedings last year. 
</P>
<P>
Blackman said ideas such as making expanded use of the east-west runway, 
officially known as 25-Left, and the restrictions on private business jets will 
be discussed with the airlines in hammering out more specific terms to 
implement the judge's order, pending an appeal by the city. 
</P>
<P>
He said a city task force once recommended expanded use of the east-west 
runway, but the City Council nixed the idea because it said spreading the 
problem around is not the solution to airport noise. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Noise Over East End? 
</P>
<P>
Thurman said he is concerned about not only the additional noise over the west 
side of the airport, but about whether aircraft landing on the east-west runway 
might create noise for homeowners in the city's East End. 
</P>
<P>
The east-west runway is too short to handle large commercial jets, but could 
take a greater load of smaller general-aviation planes, some of which can have 
noise levels approaching those of much bigger aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
The city and airlines are supposed to report back to Waters on July 17 on the 
impact of the added flights. Waters would have the option of altering the 
number of daily flights based on the report.

TEACHER TROUBLES;

MORALE DIPS AS TALKS STALL AFTER 9 MONTHS

<P>
Frustrated by their longest-ever contract dispute, teachers in the Whittier 
City School District have gone public, advertising their anger in a rented 
billboard, in a newspaper ad and by picketing. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations have stalled after nine months of talks, and members of the 
Whittier Elementary Teachers Assn. are not hesitating to express their 
displeasure. At a school board meeting last month, one teacher called board 
members "thieves" and another said they should be "tarred and feathered." 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen the teachers as angry as they are now," said Lotus Warren, a 
teacher in the district for 20 years. "The morale is going down the tubes."

<P>
Whittier City's 265 teachers are not the only ones in Southeast Los Angeles 
County working without a contract. The 500 teachers in the Paramount Unified 
School District are also in the midst of one of their longest-ever contract 
disagreements, and plan to picket school board meetings beginning Tuesday. In 
the Lynwood Unified School District, the district and union representing 560 
teachers are nearing a contract agreement after five months of negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
The tension level in the Whittier City district is rapidly approaching that of 
the Los Angeles Unified School District, where about 13,000 teachers were to 
take a strike vote late Wednesday, said Marilyn Stapleton, president of the 
Whittier Elementary Teachers' Assn. The Whittier City union is in the 
next-to-last stage of the labor negotiation process mandated by state law 
before a strike vote can be taken. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all we've been able to do to stop the teachers from taking a strike vote 
too soon," Stapleton said. "But we have to go through the (negotiating) 
channels first." 
</P>
<P>
Whittier City teachers are seeking a 7% pay increase and an improved benefits 
package. The school board has offered a 5% to 5 1/2% raise, which Supt. Neal J. 
Avery said is all the district can afford. Currently, the top pay for Whittier 
teachers is $41,635 a year, according to the California Teachers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't see any way to give the teachers what they want and keep the district 
solvent," said Avery, noting that the 5,800-student district had to cut 
$700,000 from this year's budget because of an 87-student enrollment drop after 
the Oct. 1, 1987, earthquake that seriously damaged parts of Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
Although Whittier City teachers want a raise, Stapleton said the more 
significant problem is a lack of trust and respect between the union and 
district. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel the district does not think of us as professionals, with regard to 
salary and recognition of the job we do," Stapleton said, adding that she 
believes that only the resignation of Avery would lead to a speedy resolution 
of the contract dispute. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Trust Factor' Needs Work 
</P>
<P>
Avery, a 38-year employee of the Whittier City district, said contract 
discussions started becoming prolonged after the state mandated labor 
negotiations for school districts about 12 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledges that "the trust factor" needs some work, but he is at a loss 
about what to do. "I'd love to find some kind of format where the adversarial 
position left us," Avery said, "but this lack of trust started way back, and I 
haven't been able to change that." 
</P>
<P>
The trust level in the Whittier City district plummeted in November, when 
teachers began picketing schools and board meetings. In December, the union 
took out a half-page advertisement about the dispute in a local newspaper, and 
in January rented a Whittier Boulevard billboard announcing in bold black 
letters: "Whittier City, Home of 265 unhappy, unappreciated teachers!" 
</P>
<P>
Then came the school board's decision last month to place a two-minute limit on 
public speakers at board meetings. 
</P>
<P>
The teachers were insulted by the action, saying the board passed the limit to 
try to silence those who wanted to complain about the negotiations. The board 
denied that the limit was aimed at teachers, but, "I will say our timing was 
poor," acknowledged board member Janet Henke. 
</P>
<P>
For the following meeting, the union organized a parade of about 30 parents and 
teachers who each spoke for two minutes about their dissatisfaction with the 
time limit and the district. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at these sullen faces of people I really don't like. I'm sick of this 
school board," teacher Paul Thomas told the board at the meeting, adding that 
he would like to see them "tarred and feathered." 
</P>
<P>
The school board voted unanimously to rescind the speaking limit at its Monday 
meeting 
</P>
<P>
At another meeting, a teacher called the board members "thieves" because of a 
dispute about the spending of $265,000 that had accumulated in a fund used to 
pay health insurance premiums for teachers. The surplus occurred when the 
teachers did not spend as much as had been anticipated on medical bills. 
</P>
<P>
Avery said the district spent the money to supplement the state's cost of 
living wage increase last year and to lease a school from the Los Nietos 
District while earthquake damage was repaired at Lincoln Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Belonged to Teachers 
</P>
<P>
The union believes the money still belongs to the teachers because the dollar 
figure for insurance had been negotiated in previous contracts. "The word thief 
isn't too far off," Stapleton said. 
</P>
<P>
Starting with the 1988-89 school year, Whittier City teachers also were dealt a 
50% increase in the cost of health care benefits. Teachers said the $265,000 
could have been used to offset that increase, but Avery points out that the 
offset would only be for a year, after which teachers would still have to deal 
with the higher cost of insurance. 
</P>
<P>
After a state-appointed mediator was unable to negotiate settlements in the 
Whittier City district, the contract process moved to what is known as "fact 
finding." In the fact-finding process, both sides agree to have a third party 
investigate district finances to determine how much money is available for 
teacher salaries and benefits. The results of fact-finding are publicly 
disclosed, but are not binding. 
</P>
<P>
In Whittier City, the parties have agreed upon a fact-finder and the process is 
scheduled to begin in about three weeks. Fact-finding is the last step the 
union has to fulfill before teachers can legally strike. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mediator Scheduled 
</P>
<P>
The Paramount Unified School District also has started the fact-finding 
process. A state mediator is scheduled to meet with both parties Feb. 28 to 
discuss disagreements about class size and preparatory periods for elementary 
and intermediate school teachers, said John Burritt, executive director of the 
Paramount Teachers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The 8,700-student Paramount district averages 30 or 31 students per class at 
the elementary and secondary schools, Burritt said. 
</P>
<P>
"We would ultimately like to get that down in the low 20s," Burritt said. 
"We're looking for a commitment from the district to start that process next 
year and each year make progress toward whatever mutual goal we can agree on." 
</P>
<P>
District Supt. Richard B. Caldwell said class sizes in the low 20s are "a 
utopia that costs all kinds of money" since more teachers and classrooms would 
be required. "If we were to reduce one student in every class in the school 
district it would cost us half a million dollars," Caldwell said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sizes Will Go Down 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 98, approved by California voters in November, ultimately will 
result in smaller class sizes, Caldwell added, but no one knows how much 
smaller or how much it will cost. 
</P>
<P>
The union and district have reached agreement on about 90% of the teachers' 
contract demands, he said, including a 5% salary increase. Currently, the top 
salary is $41,378, according to the California Teachers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
In the Lynwood Unified School District, the school board is seeking a 
three-year contract with the Lynwood Teachers Assn. Jewell Lee, the district's 
negotiator, said contract discussions have been amicable and he expects to 
reach an agreement within a couple of months. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiating "five months into the school year is not a long time," Lee said. 
"We would get worried if they went into next year without a contract." 
</P>
<P>
He would not elaborate on the teachers' demands. Several calls to the Lynwood 
Teachers Assn. were not returned.

FOR THE RECORD

The Paramount Unified School District has offered teachers a 2% salary 
increase, Supt. Richard B. Caldwell said. In a Feb. 9 story about teacher 
contract negotiations in several Southeast school districts, The Times 
incorrectly reported that the Paramount district had offered its teachers a 5% 
salary increase. Caldwell said a 5% salary increase already has been accepted 
by classified and management employees. Negotiations with teachers remain at an 
impasse.

RECALLING 'FORGOTTEN GENOCIDE'; 
</P>
<P>
ARMENIAN GROUP DISTRIBUTES CURRICULUM GUIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ESTHER SCHRADER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Glendale-based Armenian organization has begun distributing the first 
English-language curriculum guide to teach about what Armenians call "the 
forgotten genocide" -- the killings of more than a million Armenians by the 
Ottoman Turkish regime. 
</P>
<P>
The guide was published by a branch of the Armenian National Committee, one of 
several Armenian-American political organizations with offices in the Los 
Angeles area. The handbook is a suggested lesson plan for teaching about the 
deaths, which occurred between 1915 and 1923. 
</P>
<P>
Titled "The Armenian Genocide," the guide evolves from more than half a century 
of attempts by Armenian groups to establish the deaths to the American public 
as an example of genocide, which is defined as the systematic killing of a 
national or ethnic group. 
</P>
<P>
It is unclear at this time whether teachers will use the material. 
</P>
<P>
The nature and intent of the deaths have long been the subject of fierce and 
often violent disagreement. 
</P>
<P>
Armenian scholars say that Talat Bey, then interior minister of the Ottoman 
Empire, explicitly ordered a mass killing of Armenians in 1915. The Turkish 
government says there was never a calculated plan of extermination. 
</P>
<P>
Turkish officials do not deny that many Armenians were killed by Ottoman Turks 
during World War I, but they put the number of deaths at closer to 300,000. 
They contend that Armenians killed about as many Turkish Muslims during the 
period. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scholar Disputes Genocide 
</P>
<P>
"I dispute that there was a genocide of Armenians. I don't believe that is an 
appropriate term for what was a combination of international war, an 
inter-communal war and especially death from starvation and disease," said 
Justin McCarthy, a Mideast scholar and author of several books on the Ottoman 
Empire who is chairman of the department of history at the University of 
Louisville, in Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be proper to present both sides of the contentious historical issue, 
but they have deliberately not done that. They have deliberately picked the one 
side that is most politically expedient." 
</P>
<P>
Armenian scholars say that the massacre is beyond dispute. 
</P>
<P>
California Department of Education officials said this week that the decision 
whether to use study materials prepared by independent groups is left to school 
districts and in many cases to individual teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Vic Pallos, a Glendale school district spokesman, said that district officials 
have not yet had time to assess the curriculum guides. 
</P>
<P>
The 84-page handbook is illustrated with stark pictures of victims and 
bedraggled survivors. It details the history of the Armenian people, the deaths 
that the community continues to mourn and the result -- the scattering of 
Armenians around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
The guide was written by Garine Zetlian, a 27-year-old doctoral candidate in 
Armenian and Mideast history at UCLA. Zetlian said she researched both Turkish 
and Armenian archives in preparing the handbook and received assistance from 
Armenian scholars nationwide, including Richard Hovanissian, a UCLA professor 
who is regarded as a national authority on Armenian history. 
</P>
<P>
"Genocide in general and the Armenian genocide in particular have fallen out of 
textbooks of recent history and civilization," Hovanissian said. "We want to 
motivate teachers to devote a couple of weeks to this subject in an otherwise 
very crowded curriculum." 
</P>
<P>
The guide is one of several study aids prepared by Armenian organizations to 
accompany the "Model Curriculum for Human Rights and Genocide," which was 
ratified by the State Board of Education in October, 1987. The development of 
the model curriculum was mandated by the California Legislature in 1985, after 
years of intensive lobbying by Armenian and Jewish organizations and other 
minority groups. 
</P>
<P>
Under the guidelines prepared by the State Department of Education, 
California's school districts in 1988 began adding "human rights with 
particular attention to the inhumanity of genocide" to the regular social 
studies curriculum of students in grades 7-12. 
</P>
<P>
The curriculum includes, in addition to the Holocaust and the deaths of the 
Armenian people, a discussion of the Ukrainian famine brought on by Soviet 
agricultural policies in 1932-33, the mass murder of Poles during World War II, 
slavery in the United States, recent human rights abuses in Argentina, Cambodia 
and South Africa and discrimination suffered by Asians, Latinos, women, the 
handicapped, gays and Native Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"For someone who doesn't have any idea who the Armenians are or where they come 
from, the handbook offers a more elaborate presentation of who we are and the 
genocidal process," Zetlian said. "Our hope is that educators will familiarize 
themselves with the document and decide to use it in the classroom." 
</P>
<P>
Zetlian said she sought suggestions from curriculum planners and teachers to 
develop the guide, which includes maps, vocabulary lists, suggested questions, 
puzzles and an extensive bibliography. 
</P>
<P>
Completed in December, more than 300 complimentary copies of the guide have 
since been sent from the Armenian National Committee branch on Colorado 
Boulevard to schools throughout Southern California, where more than 250,000 
Armenians live. Committee officials said they plan to distribute the book 
nationally, but will charge $10 a copy. 
</P>
<P>
The Armenian Assembly, a political organization with offices in Hollywood, is 
also distributing study materials about the Armenian deaths to California 
educators. The Assembly's publication -- also being distributed for free -- is 
an extensive bibliography of documentation and secondary sources about the 
genocide, rather than a lesson plan. 
</P>
<P>
In teaching about the deaths of their people, Armenian community leaders and 
outside scholars agree that they are following the example of American Jews, 
who have for years produced an enormous reservoir of educational material to 
teach about the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
"When the Holocaust began to be talked about, it was first by Jewish survivors, 
and it took Jewish scholars to bring to the fore the specifics of the Holocaust 
and its place in history," said Margot Strom, director of Facing History in 
Ourselves, a private, nonprofit research center in Boston devoted to the study 
of human rights abuses. "I think the same thing is beginning to happen with the 
Armenians."

ASSEMBLYMAN MURRAY UNDER FIRE ON OPPOSITION TO BAN ON ASSAULT RIFLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Willard D. Murray ran for the state Assembly last fall, voters in this 
city overwhelmingly supported the former civil rights activist and political 
consultant. Now, some of the same people are at odds with their new legislator 
over the issue of gun control. 
</P>
<P>
Murray (D-Paramount) is opposed to gun control. In Compton -- where the latest 
people to die from semiautomatic weapon fire were a 2-year-old boy, a 
19-year-old man and a 32-year-old man walking along a residential street -- 
there is widespread support for outlawing the weapons, officials and residents 
say. 
</P>
<P>
Last month the City Council unanimously voted to ban the sale or possession of 
the semiautomatic military-style assault rifles within municipal boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
Murray says, however, that he will not support a move in the state Legislature 
to outlaw or restrict the sale of such semiautomatics as the kind of military 
assault weapon used in the killing last month of five Stockton schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Better Support It' 
</P>
<P>
"He'd better support it," Compton Mayor Walter R. Tucker said. "If he doesn't, 
he'll be a one-term assemblyman just like the guy before him." 
</P>
<P>
Murray ousted Republican incumbent Paul E. Zeltner of Lakewood. The National 
Rifle Assn. endorsed Murray shortly before election day after Zeltner, a former 
Los Angeles County sheriff's captain, was quoted as saying that he would favor 
some kind of restriction on the sale of such semiautomatic military-style 
assault weapons as the Uzi and the AK-47. 
</P>
<P>
Military-style assault rifles sold on the civilian market are high-powered 
weapons that can fire one round for each squeeze of the trigger. Although 
assault rifles are generally more compact than hunting rifles, they carry more 
bullets. For instance, one magazine for the Uzi holds 32 rounds. Several police 
organizations want them banned. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on the "Maybe he got some NRA money," Tucker said while trying to 
explain Murray's stance. 
</P>
<P>
Murray and an NRA official insisted that the assemblyman did not receive NRA 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
The organization expects a legislator that it endorses to uphold the 
Constitution's Second Amendment guaranteeing a citizen's right to bear arms, 
said Ted A. Lattanzio, the NRA's director of state and local affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Murray said in a recent interview that "Gun control would only keep guns away 
from the good, law-abiding citizens. And the bad people would get guns because 
they would not obey the law." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Infringes' on Liberty 
</P>
<P>
Murray, sounding the same theme he used during his campaign, said he is opposed 
to any further restriction on the sale of weapons because it "infringes on 
another person's liberty." He said he would not vote for a ban on the sale of 
semiautomatic assault weapons nor would he support a compromise legislative 
proposal to make buyers wait 15 days from the date of purchase to the time they 
take possession. State law requires buyers of pistols to wait 15 days so that 
law enforcement agencies can make a background check on them. 
</P>
<P>
"I am opposed to any additional restrictions," Murray said. "I have heard no 
evidence that gun control has reduced crime anywhere in this country." 
</P>
<P>
The way to deal with the weapons issue, Murray insisted, is to punish those who 
use them during crimes. Murray said he has already introduced a bill in the 
Assembly that proposes longer prison sentences for people convicted of assault 
with semiautomatic assault weapons and machine guns. 
</P>
<P>
Existing law provides for sentences of two to four years for assault with a 
firearm, Murray said. If his bill becomes law, he continued, assault with a 
semiautomatic assault weapon would carry a prison sentence of four to 12 years 
and assault with a machine gun could be punishable with a life sentence. He 
said he is drafting other legislation to cover murder and armed robbery 
committed with semiautomatic assault weapons or machine guns. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Says Stand Is Political 
</P>
<P>
Murray's old friend, Compton Councilman Maxcy Filer, said he believes that 
Murray's stance on gun control is a political one taken to court the NRA. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he should really look into what he's doing when he says he would not 
ban semiautomatic weapons," Filer said. "He's saying, 'Then, fine, anyone in 
the city of Compton can have a weapon.' And we don't believe that. 
</P>
<P>
"(Gun advocates) use the term freedom. What about the people getting killed? 
What about their rights? Those that are staying in their houses because they're 
afraid -- what about their constitutional rights and their freedom?" 
</P>
<P>
In Compton neighborhoods, the sound of gunfire from semiautomatic assault 
weapons is common. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so loud you don't know when to fall to the floor," says Brenda Sykes, 
president of a block club in the Killen Place-Killen Court neighborhood in the 
city's northeast corner. 
</P>
<P>
She recalls the Sunday morning she returned home from church services to find 
her neighbors nearly hysterical. A 15-year-old boy, ignoring children romping 
on front lawns, had chased another boy down the street, firing an assault rifle 
at him. 
</P>
<P>
"There were 7- and 8-year-olds playing out here and they didn't know what to 
do," said Sykes, who wants the weapons taken out of circulation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ban Strongly Supported 
</P>
<P>
At the opposite end of town, Bernard Stephens, president of the West 
Lantana-Bennett Block Club, said people in his neighborhood strongly support 
the city's ban on military-style assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
"The AK-47s and the Uzi," Stephens said, "we're for those people getting those 
off the street, out of existence. Those guns are made to kill people. Those 
guns are not to hunt with." 
</P>
<P>
NRA spokesmen have said that they will file a legal challenge to Compton's gun 
ban. If the ordinance does not survive the court challenge, Compton residents 
will have to depend on state legislators to ban or restrict the sale of the 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
In that case, Stephens said, he does not know what action his block club will 
take. "We'll have to think about writing letters or something to them," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Arthur Atkins, a member of the Compton Block Club Commission, which 
the City Council established to promote the neighborhood watch groups, said: 
"We're going to have to do something about changing (Murray's) mind. Once he 
understands the problem, he'll (listen) to us because he wants to continue 
being an assemblyman." 
</P>
<P>
Compton voters will break ranks with Murray over the issue of gun control, said 
Atkins, pastor of Heavenly Rest Missionary Baptist Church on Bullis Road. 
Getting the weapons off the street, he said, is a constant topic of discussion 
at block club meetings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Very Distressed' 
</P>
<P>
Sidney Bowen, vice chairman of the block club commission, said he was "very 
distressed" to learn that Murray is opposed to a ban on the weapons. "I did not 
know that when I voted for him," Bowen said. 
</P>
<P>
He also said that he will introduce a motion that the commission send Murray a 
letter asking him to change his position "and represent us and not the NRA. I 
don't think the assemblyman is representative of the majority of the 
constituents in his district because we are the victims of these weapons," 
Bowen said. "We are in fear to walk the streets." 
</P>
<P>
If the authors of the Second Amendment, Bowen said, saw today's gang shootings 
and weapons, "they would be ashamed if we didn't do anything. Never in their 
wildest imagination did they envision this amendment being a provision that 
criminals could hide behind and (that) innocent people would become the 
hunted." 
</P>
<P>
Pressure also is coming from other quarters for Murray to modify his position 
on gun control. He recently met with municipal judges in Compton for an 
informal discussion about legislative issues and got an earful on the subject. 
The judges made it clear that they want the Legislature to enact some kind of 
restriction on the availability of the weapons. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concealment Argument 
</P>
<P>
Murray tried to explain why state law allows people to buy AK-47s and Uzis in 
five minutes but makes them wait 15 days for a pistol. The rationale is, Murray 
said, that pistols are more dangerous because they can be concealed. 
</P>
<P>
"Garbage," retorted one unidentified judge. 
</P>
<P>
Murray, whose 54th Assembly District also takes in Lakewood, Bellflower, 
Paramount and a slice of Long Beach, said that he is not feeling pressured to 
change his mind on gun control. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not jumping on what I guess some perceive as a bandwagon," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, there was a statewide gun-control referendum on the ballot, Murray 
said, and the majority of Compton voters went against it. He said he believes 
that they would do the same thing again. The City Council tried two years ago 
to pass an ordinance banning handguns, but reversed itself under pressure from 
the NRA and Compton citizens.

COUNCIL PRAISED FOR PASSING MILITARY ASSAULT GUN BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The chamber was overflowing with residents Tuesday night as the Compton City 
Council gave the final reading to an ordinance that bans the sale and 
possession of semiautomatic military-style assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Several speakers, many of them block club members and clergymen, rose to praise 
the council for its unanimous action in banning the weapons, which have been 
responsible for the deaths of three people in Compton during the last two 
weeks. The ordinance will take effect in 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
The National Rifle Assn. has said through spokesmen in California and in 
Washington, D.C., that it will challenge the ordinance in court on the grounds 
that only the state Legislature can regulate the use of firearms. Councilman 
Maxcy Filer, who authored the weapons ban, said the city is prepared if 
necessary to fight its case to the U.S. Supreme Court.

FIRM RAIDED IN SEARCH FOR ILLEGAL SEWER DISCHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Cerritos firm has been prohibited from discharging waste water into the sewer 
system until it meets the environmental standards required by the Sanitation 
Districts of Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
The firm, Transducers Inc., was raided Monday by agents from the sanitation 
districts, the county district attorney's office and the county Health 
Department. They carried search warrants in order to gather evidence that the 
firm illegally discharged hazardous heavy metals into the sewer system, said 
Margaret Nellor, sanitation districts spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Perino, president of the firm, was unavailable for comment, his secretary 
Mercy Gingrich said. She confirmed that there was a "visit" from sanitation 
agents. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney is reviewing evidence, Nellor said, to determine if 
criminal charges will be filed against Transducers, 17502 Fabrica Way. It makes 
instruments for weights and measures, Nellor said. The firm cannot discharge 
waste water, she said, until sanitation officials are satisfied that it has 
been properly treated to eliminate hazardous materials.

<TEXT>
<P>
Requests for demolition permits for buildings more than 50 years old will be 
reviewed by Long Beach's new neighborhood and historic preservation officer, 
the City Council has decided. 
</P>
<P>
The change in the process is being made in an attempt to save more old, 
historic structures in the city. Planning Director Robert Paternoster said that 
the review process will ensure that the city is aware that a historic structure 
might be endangered before it is too late.

CERRITOS COLLEGE WILL HOST MAJOR SPEECH TOURNAMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cerritos Community College will host the 15th annual Tabor-Venitsky 
Invitational Speech Tournament on Friday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
More than 18 community colleges are expected to participate in the tournament, 
which is aimed at sharpening students' skills for state and national contests 
to be held later in the year. The tournament will begin at 10 a.m. Friday and 
conclude at 6 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Colleges in both Northern and Southern California will compete as well as 
schools from Washington, Utah and Arizona. Between 200 and 300 students are 
expected to compete. 
</P>
<P>
The tournament is not restricted to speech majors, said Mary Lewis, a director 
in the Cerritos College forensic department. "We draw from all majors. Being 
able to speak in an organized and intelligent manner will help you no matter 
what major you are," Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
Individual and team trophies will be awarded to winners and runners-up at the 
conclusion of the competition.

<TEXT>
<P>
The committee formed to organize and finance two years of events celebrating 
the 100th birthday of Long Beach ended up in the black. 
</P>
<P>
The International City Celebration reported accumulating a surplus of $54,483 
that will be donated to the city, according to the group's final report. Of 
that, $6,204 was surplus revenue from the sale of tiles and bronze plaques 
mounted in Centennial Plaza in the City Hall complex. 
</P>
<P>
Besides resulting in favorable publicity for the city, the centennial also 
leaves behind some lasting tributes. Ten flag poles and bronze photograph

LEGISLATURE URGED TO BAN SALE OF ASSAULT WEAPONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alarmed at the recent rash of publicized shootings involving assault rifles, 
the Long Beach City Council has decided to let one of its committees study 
whether more can be done to control the high-powered weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Council members also passed a resolution calling on the Legislature to ban the 
sale of military-style semiautomatic assault rifles. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no legitimate use for these weapons," said Councilman Evan Anderson 
Braude, who sponsored the actions. 
</P>
<P>
"This is madness and it has got to stop," said Councilman Clarence Smith. 
</P>
<P>
But gun advocate Clark Biggers III said that he objected to an attempt by the 
city to control the sale of assault rifles. He said that youths learn to shoot 
the weapons, giving them valuable experience that they can apply if called for 
duty in the military. Also, he said their familiarity with the 
Russian-designed, Chinese-manufactured AK-47 could prove valuable if they have 
to use an enemy weapon in combat.

PEPPERDINE PURSUES PLAN TO BUILD CAMPUS IN JAPAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH J. GARCIA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pepperdine University is still pursuing a controversial plan to build a campus 
in Japan and expects to sign a contract to build the new college by the end of 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
University officials, who were approached by members of a Japanese education 
task force more than a year ago, are scheduled to travel to the Orient next 
month to complete negotiations to build a small campus in Kumagaya, a Tokyo 
suburb. If the contract is signed in March, the campus could be ready to open 
as early as the fall of next year. 
</P>
<P>
Although early plans called for the Malibu-based university to build a 
$60-million campus in Japan, university Provost William Adrian said the 
proposal has been scaled down to $35 million. Adrian said financing continues 
to be the biggest stumbling block, adding that the university is trying to get 
Japanese investors to bankroll the entire project. 
</P>
<P>
If the deal is completed, Pepperdine would become the first university in the 
United States to own and operate a campus in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Optimistic on Outcome 
</P>
<P>
"I'm optimistic that we're going to work it out, but until we sign on the 
bottom line, there's always a possibility things could change," Adrian said. 
"The group we're working with has indicated a great desire to have a university 
in Japan." 
</P>
<P>
The proposal is part of a Japanese program to open up cultural and education 
centers for American and Japanese students. The education task force was 
established in 1987 by the Japanese government as part of a program to attract 
U.S. capital and ease trade friction between the two nations. 
</P>
<P>
However, the program has received much criticism by officials from other U.S. 
universities that have been courted by the Japanese. Richard Lariviere, 
director of the Center for Asian Studies at the University of Texas, Austin, 
said earlier that although the Japanese contingent offered "lots of 
enticements," his school rejected the offer because financing was questionable 
and the proposal did not have the support of the Japanese Ministry of 
Education. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese education task force has also contacted officials at the 
University of Missouri, Southern Illinois University, Boston University and 
Bryn Mawr College. Pepperdine is the only school to express strong interest in 
the program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Officials Tight-Lipped 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine was chosen because one of the task force members, Keiko Hirabayashi, 
attended the university several years ago and recommended it. 
</P>
<P>
University officials have remained tight-lipped about negotiations. One 
Pepperdine administrator said that a story in The Times about the proposal last 
year nearly caused the Japanese to back out of the deal. He said that, among 
other things, the land set aside for the campus went up in price immediately 
after the story appeared. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine President David Davenport declined a request to be interviewed about 
the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Financing for the campus would be handled in part by Sumitomo Bank and by 
private investors. Pepperdine officials hope the Japanese government will 
contribute funding for the campus. 
</P>
<P>
Adrian said plans for the campus include classroom facilities, a dormitory, a 
cafeteria, a conference center and recreational facilities. "It won't be a 
full-blown college campus," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Year 
</P>
<P>
Adrian said the university had received assurances from the Japanese Ministry 
of Education that the school would be accredited to offer degrees. However, he 
said, the university initially would offer only certificate programs for 
Japanese students. 
</P>
<P>
Like the university's overseas programs in London and Florence, Italy, 
Pepperdine students would be able to attend the Japan campus during their 
sophomore year. It would be open to Japanese and Pepperdine students, and 
classes will be taught in English. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview last year, Davenport said the school would accommodate between 
200 and 500 students.

PROGRAM FOR PAROLEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last year it was LAMP (Los Angeles Men's Place) in the Echo Park area, and now 
another program ("Parolees Forced Out of Mt. Washington," Glendale Section 
1/26/88) is in serious (closure is serious) trouble because of the arrogance 
and ignorance of the administrators of the program. LAMP failed too, but strong 
community support might have circumvented the tangential issue that appeared. 
</P>
<P>
This time it's essentially a public agency program, not a private one. While 
some parolees may have done well in the long run, the secrecy and multiple 
violations of law, regulations and ethics would have caused major problems in a 
program for ex-convicts. Money is wasted, and both parolees and public are 
ill-served. Such events are not rare, and it should surprise no one that 
"rehabilitation" is viewed so negatively. (Recall the events of the recent 
presidential election.) 
</P>
<P>
A major battle was fought to get the law exempting facilities of six and under 
from local zoning control. Such dishonesty helps no one, and I really have to 
wonder about the meaning of Bible study in the program. Jackie Brown is not 
entitled to be "disconsolate," not even close to it. She is still arrogant and 
self-centered, given what the Department of Corrections, Transwestern Institute 
and Jackie Brown did. They hurt many others and damaged the future.

The Occidental College women's tennis team leaves for the third annual Las 
Vegas Invitational tournament today. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Occidental, the tournament field comprises Cal State 
Bakersfield, Utah State, Cal State San Bernardino, UC Riverside and Cal 
Lutheran. The Tigers, who finished third in the Southern California 
Intercollegiate Athletic Conference with a 9-3 record (12-11 overall) last 
season, lost the four top players off that squad to graduation. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike traditional tournaments, the Las Vegas tournament will be contested in 
flights, with each team's top-seeded player meeting the top-seeded players from 
each of the other teams, the No. 2 players meeting the other schools' No. 2 
players and so on. Team scoring is not tabulated under the tournament format. 
</P>

SALE OF JORDAN DOWNS TO PRIVATE DEVELOPER PLANNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN F. BUNTING and JILL STEWART, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a bold effort to upgrade low-income housing in Watts, the Los Angeles City 
Housing Authority is planning to sell the dilapidated Jordan Downs public 
housing project to a private developer and use the proceeds to create new 
rent-subsidy programs in the inner city, The Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, the first of its kind in the nation if carried out, would convert 
the 700 units at Jordan Downs into a privately operated facility and provide 
$11 million in new improvements such as security gates, air conditioning and 
laundry facilities, city documents show. A private developer would also agree 
to maintain the 50-acre property and enforce strict leasing rules designed to 
prohibit gang members, criminals and drug users from residing in the project. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, this is a win-win situation," said Leila Gonzalez-Correa, executive 
director of the Housing Authority. "Jordan is right smack in the middle of 
Watts. I really believe that turning around Jordan will be the most important 
piece of turning around Watts. It is really right now the project that is in 
the worst shape." 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez-Correa said the new program is based on the belief that the Housing 
Authority has failed in its mission to improve living conditions at Jordan 
Downs and that private industry has the resources and the capability to 
refurbish and clean up the decaying project and keep it that way. A gated 
community with on-site private supervisors, proponents say, would change the 
face of a project that for years has been plagued by slum conditions, drug 
dealing and gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
The Housing Authority has paid former Los Angeles Democratic Congresswoman 
Yvonne Brathwaite Burke up to $200 per hour in consulting fees to lobby support 
among federal, state and local officials as well as community leaders. Mayor 
Tom Bradley is among the political leaders who support the privatization 
concept. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it has merit if it is done right," Deputy Mayor Mike Gage said. "The 
mayor has said it sounds innovative and creative, but it has to be done 
carefully and with a great deal of prudence." 
</P>
<P>
Many tenants at Jordan Downs have not been so receptive. They first learned of 
the proposal earlier this week when Housing Authority police officers 
distributed notices door-to-door to announce a public hearing scheduled for 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very upset because we did not have any idea about this," said Lillian 
Browning, the tenants' housing representative at Jordan Downs. "It was a shock. 
All of a sudden we get this notice that they are looking at selling it. The 
leaflets say we will have to relocate until they redo the place. So who's to 
say we are going to get back in?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Up in Arms' 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez-Correa conceded that tenants are "up in arms" over the plan. She said 
the Housing Authority is asking tenants to wait until the Friday meeting at 
Jordan Downs before passing judgment. 
</P>
<P>
"I am willing to put together an agreement between every tenant and the 
developer and the Housing Authority to make assurances that each family is 
going to be able to return to the unit after the unit has been rehabilitated," 
Gonzalez-Correa said. "Provided they follow the rules and pay the rent and are 
not involved in drugs, they will be able to stay there forever." 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, in the planning stages for nearly a year, is unique because it 
would enlist a private developer to pay fair market value for a public housing 
project, remodel 700 apartment units without any government assistance and 
continue to lease the units indefinitely to the same low-income, 
government-subsidized tenants, said William Glavin, a spokesman for the U.S. 
Department of Housing and Urban Development in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Private developers usually purchase low-income projects from HUD and are 
obligated to rent to low-income tenants for a period of five to 15 years. After 
that, they can offer the units at market rates or turn them into condominiums, 
local laws permitting. However, in the Jordan Downs proposal, the developer 
would purchase the project from the city Housing Authority and be committed to 
maintaining low-income housing as long as government subsidies remained 
available for tenants. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people don't like seeing publicly owned units sold off because, down 
the line, you don't know whether they will be there for low-income tenants," 
said Gordon Cavanaugh, a lawyer for the Council on Large Public Housing 
Authorities, a lobbying group in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Review Proposals 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, who represents the Watts area, said she will 
not take a stand until the residents at Jordan Downs are given an opportunity 
to review the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of work has to be done at Jordan Downs," Flores said. "There has not 
been the money to do it. The amount of money that the Housing Authority gets 
from HUD just barely covers maintenance." 
</P>
<P>
HUD officials must approve the sale of Jordan Downs. So far, they have reacted 
favorably to the plan. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an innovative concept," said J. Michael Dorsey, HUD's general counsel. "I 
think it is a good idea. If you have property that a Housing Authority is 
having problems with and there are private owners who can operate it in an 
efficient manner and provide decent housing to tenants, it's obviously a 
benefit." 
</P>
<P>
A five-page summary of the plan obtained by The Times states that "the needs of 
the project are greater than the Housing Authority's resources." The property 
would be offered for sale on the open market along with requirements that 
developers refurbish the 700 units at a cost of about $16,000 each, pay for the 
tenants' relocation expenses and lease back units to all residents as long as 
they abide by leasing conditions. 
</P>
<P>
The proceeds from the sale -- estimated at $10 million by Gonzalez-Correa -- 
would be used to meet the housing needs of low-income residents outside of 
Jordan Downs. This would include improving units in other housing projects and 
establishing a rent-subsidy program run by the Housing Authority. 
</P>
<P>
The Housing Authority plans to ask for competitive bids to attract prospective 
developers. 
</P>
<P>
To qualify for public housing projects, a family of four must earn less than 
$23,050 a year. Once residents are placed in a housing project, they are 
required to pay 30% of their income in rent. 
</P>
<P>
The privatization proposal was made possible by recent federal legislation 
</P>
<P>
that set aside for housing projects a certain number of rent-subsidy 
certificates that would normally go to low-income families living in private 
apartments. HUD recently allocated 700 of these certificates to Los Angeles for 
tenants residing in the city's housing projects. These certificates will make 
it possible for developers to borrow money privately for the purchase and 
renovation of Jordan Downs, said Gary Squier, the mayor's housing coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking for a proven track record on the part of a buyer for managing 
housing that is difficult to manage . . . and an expressed desire to maintain 
the affordability of the units for a long period of time," Squier said. "The 
concept is that smaller, private-sector development entities can be more 
responsive than a large Housing Authority bureaucracy to the specific needs and 
circumstances of a project such as Jordan Downs." 
</P>
<P>
But it remains to be seen how enthusiastically private developers will respond 
to the opportunity to take over the troubled housing project. 
</P>
<P>
Built in 1955, Jordan Downs consists of 103 buildings, a 4,000-square-foot 
community center, four maintenance garages and 10 playground areas. Most of the 
700 frame-and-stucco apartment units, located on Grape Street between 97th and 
103rd streets in Watts, are decaying and in need of repair. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Slum Conditions 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the City Council voted to lend the Housing Authority $818,000 to 
repair slum conditions at Jordan Downs after several council members threatened 
to back a measure allowing tenants to refuse to pay rent. 
</P>
<P>
At Jordan Downs, where only one member of every seven families has a job, 
according to city records, residents said Wednesday that no matter who is in 
charge, modernization plans that focus on fixing buildings and streets will 
fail unless the project's human problems are addressed. 
</P>
<P>
Tracy Henderson, 30, said Jordan's problems "are not the buildings, but the 
people who turn these places into animal cages. I want much tougher rules for 
tenants and I want the drug selling to stop. How is some company going to do 
that, I'd like to know?" 
</P>
<P>
She pointed to a huge open field, filled with litter, that separates two 
streets within the project and said wistfully, "That space could be a 
child-care center right there, but it's not." 
</P>
<P>
Warren Gilmore, 39, a Vietnam veteran who has lived at Jordan Downs for most of 
his life, said the Housing Authority is widely disliked because the agency has 
failed to clear out the tenants who openly deal drugs and run in gangs. 
</P>
<P>
Although he fears that a private corporation will have even less interest in 
the tenants, Gilmore said that residents are suspicious of the Housing 
Authority because it has spent millions of dollars modernizing the equally 
troubled Nickerson Gardens, the city's largest housing project located a few 
blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
"We look over at Nickerson Gardens (housing project), where they are getting 
new kitchens and bathrooms while we get almost nothing but some new paint," 
Gilmore said. "It looks like we are getting shafted, and now we're getting 
sold."

BUSH'S CAPITAL GAINS TAX CUT PLAN DETAILED 
</P>

President Bush, preparing to present his budget to Congress today, will propose 
restoring a tax break for capital gains but limiting it to stocks and similar 
investments held for at least three years, Administration officials said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
For the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, Bush will project a deficit of about 
$98 billion, sources said, slightly higher than the $92.5-billion deficit that 
former President Ronald Reagan had projected. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Head Start Funds 
</P>
<P>
Behind the higher deficit is Bush's plan to spend more for education, child 
care, environmental protection and the homeless. His budget reportedly includes 
more money for the Head Start program for disadvantaged preschoolers and tax 
credits to offset some of the costs of adoption and of child care for the 
working poor. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed capital-gains tax cut, which would be phased in over several 
years, is designed to deliver on one of Bush's strongest campaign promises. It 
is aimed at encouraging investors to favor long-term investments over quicker 
deals. 
</P>
<P>
But the tax cut is likely to encounter stiff opposition from many Democrats in 
Congress, who argue that the revival of a lower capital-gains tax rate would be 
a boon to the wealthy and widen the budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Bush will respond that his proposal, far from losing tax revenues for the 
government, would actually raise about $5 billion next year by encouraging 
additional profit-taking. And in subsequent years, aides said, it would produce 
extra revenues by contributing to economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Bush is expected to run into roadblocks from lawmakers reluctant to 
make significant changes in the tax code so soon after agreeing to the sweeping 
1986 tax revision, in which the capital-gains tax break was ended as part of a 
package that dramatically lowered overall tax rates. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called 'Unacceptable' 
</P>
<P>
"At a time when virtually every segment of our country is being asked to 
sustain a sacrifice of one form or another," said Senate Budget Committee 
Chairman Jim Sasser (D-Tenn.), "it is simply unacceptable to be considering tax 
breaks for the very wealthiest segment of the American population." 
</P>
<P>
Under current law, all capital gains are taxed at ordinary income-tax rates, 
15% for the majority of taxpayers and 28% or 33% for more affluent individuals. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's plan calls for a 15% tax rate on long-term capital gains for those in 
the 28% and 33% tax brackets and a 9% rate for those who pay 15% on their other 
income. 
</P>
<P>
To prevent tax-shelter operators from taking advantage of the lower rate, the 
Administration would exclude real estate and other assets subject to 
depreciation. The plan would also exclude investments in collectibles and 
similar items from the tax break. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's plan, if adopted, would be phased in so that investors would not be 
discouraged in the early years from taking their profits. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Timetable Not Clear 
</P>
<P>
Although the exact timetable was not clear, investors initially would be 
eligible for the lower capital-gains rate on investments that they had held for 
just one year. The required holding period would be lengthened in subsequent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
As part of its effort to win approval of the plan, the Bush Administration is 
expected to argue that lowering the capital-gains tax rate and lengthening the 
holding period would discourage politically unpopular corporate takeovers. The 
reason is that the tax change would encourage investors to hold their stocks 
rather than sell them to corporate raiders. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's budget for fiscal 1990 will include spending of roughly $1.16 trillion, 
sources said. The $98-billion deficit, though greater than that proposed by 
Reagan on Jan. 9, would still fall under the $100-billion ceiling mandated by 
the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's spending blueprint would add more than $250 million in education 
spending to Reagan's earlier request, sources said, with most of the money 
going to the Head Start program. 
</P>
<P>
New tax breaks intended to encourage support of families and to fulfill his 
promises to conservative elements of the Republican Party would be added. These 
include an additional $1,000 child-care credit for low-income families with 
children under the age of 5. 
</P>
<P>
Also expected is a tax deduction of up to $3,000 to help cover the cost of 
adoptions, with an emphasis on families that adopt children with special needs. 
</P>
<P>
Budget officials also said that Bush will propose to spend more than Reagan had 
planned to clean up nuclear weapons plants. One Administration source agreed 
with a report in the New York Times that Bush will ask for $360 million more 
than the $1.4 billion Reagan had requested in his final budget for all of the 
Energy Department's waste-management programs. 
</P>
<P>
But other aides, questioning the figures, said that the Energy Department 
sought only $315 million next year in actual spending on weapons plant cleanup. 
Arguing that the department is in no position to double the program so quickly, 
they suggested that Bush may intend simply to increase the $315-million 
spending plan for fiscal year 1990 to $360 million.

BUSH TO DELAY PLAN FOR OIL DRILLING AND LEASING OFF CALIF. 
</P>

President Bush, in a major peace offering to environmentalists, will pledge in 
his nationally televised speech to Congress at 6 p.m. today to "indefinitely 
postpone" oil drilling off the Northern California coast and to delay a major 
lease sale planned for Southern California, a senior Administration aide said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, which environmental leaders hailed as a major victory, will all 
but kill the Ronald Reagan Administration's long-stalled plan to greatly expand 
drilling in California waters. The plan, which for eight years has been fought 
by California officials in Congress and the courts, became a major issue during 
the fall presidential campaign. Democrats charged then that Bush, if elected, 
would allow drilling to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, during the campaign, pledged to re-examine Reagan's drilling plans. Since 
then "the jury has been out on this issue with Bush," said Rep. Mel Levine 
(D-Santa Monica), a leading opponent of offshore drilling. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always felt that Bush's first test on the environment would be the 
California coastline," Levine said. If Bush sticks to his plan to forestall the 
lease sales, "it would be a dramatic environmental victory," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pledge on Acid Rain 
</P>
<P>
In a second environmental decision, Bush will pledge in the speech to send 
Congress legislation to reduce acid rain emissions as part of a new clean air 
proposal. The pledge backs up a promise that William K. Reilly, Bush's 
Environmental Protection Agency chief, made last week during his Senate 
confirmation hearings and could break a logjam that prevented significant 
modernization of clean air rules throughout Reagan's tenure. 
</P>
<P>
Administration sources cautioned, however, that Bush will not offer any new 
specifics on how to meet his clean air goals, leaving them open to further 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Reagan Administration's oil drilling plan, which was pushed by James 
G. Watt, Reagan's controversial first Interior secretary, the federal 
government proposed two major new California oil lease sales, Lease Sale 91, 
off the northern coast, and Lease Sale 95, covering the coast south of Santa 
Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Under Bush's plan, Lease Sale 91 would be "indefinitely postponed," effectively 
killing the proposal. Lease Sale 95 would be delayed pending a report from a 
special task force that Bush will charge with developing plans to balance 
environmental and energy needs. While the task force approach in theory would 
allow the Southern California sale to proceed at some future time, "the 
language of the speech will indicate that he's disposed against the drilling," 
the Administration official said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Reagan plan, the government would have begun leasing tracts to oil 
companies in the Lease Sale 95 area next year. The sales were budgeted to bring 
in some $400 million in new federal revenue in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 
1. Delaying or killing the plan will cause a "revenue hit," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Would Fulfill Promise 
</P>
<P>
But the money is of less importance to the new Administration than is the 
emotional symbolism of the decision. Bush, who spent three hours Wednesday 
afternoon in a relaxed review of his address to Congress, plans to use 
tonight's speech to demonstrate his resolve to fulfill campaign promises, one 
of the most prominent of which was his pledge that "I am an environmentalist." 
</P>
<P>
Bush became the first President ever to pay an official visit to EPA 
headquarters Wednesday, attending Reilly's swearing in ceremony and telling 
officials there that the American people "won't accept excuses any more and 
they won't accept finger-pointing. They want us to get all the sides together 
and find a way to achieve both" environmental protection and economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
Watt and other Reagan Administration officials argued that more drilling was 
needed to reduce U.S. dependency on oil imports. Opponents have countered that 
the risks of oil spills, air pollution from drilling equipment and esthetic 
damage from the offshore rigs outweighed the benefits that increased oil 
production might bring. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many other major environmental issues, which require either substantial 
expenditures or extensive negotiations with Congress, the oil drilling issue 
can be largely resolved by executive fiat. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional opponents of drilling -- one of the most emotional environmental 
issues the federal government confronts -- have fought a steady rear-guard 
action to delay Watt's plan to vastly increase drilling in the Pacific off 
California, the Atlantic off New England and the Carolinas and off Alaskan 
shores. And California state officials have taken the federal government to 
court on several occasions claiming that drilling plans, if carried out, would 
violate a series of environmental laws.

<TEXT>
<P>
A chartered U.S. jetliner slammed into a mist-shrouded mountain and burst into 
flames here Wednesday, killing 137 Italian tourists and an American crew of 
seven on board, local government officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"The force of the explosion and the number of mutilated bodies recovered 
indicate everyone was killed," a Santa Maria Island official told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Portuguese state television said an emergency medical team that arrived on 
Santa Maria from Ponta Delgada, the principal city in the Portuguese 
mid-Atlantic chain, was told that there was no hope of finding survivors. 
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old Boeing 707, owned by Independent Air Corp. of Smyrna, Tenn., 
crashed on approach to the Santa Maria Airport for a refueling stop on a flight 
from Bergamo, Italy, to the resort of Puerto Plata in the Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
"The crash scene is indescribable," Portuguese state radio journalist Margarida 
Pereira said from the crash site on the 1,800-foot high Pico Alto. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw only one whole body . . . the rest are torn to pieces. The wreckage is 
spread over a wide area and the rescue teams are finding it difficult to reach 
the bodies," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said more than 50 bodies, most of them badly mutilated, had been 
recovered about four hours after the crash. 
</P>
<P>
"The plane was very low, everything seemed perfectly normal, then it turned and 
flew straight into the mountain," said witness Manuel Vairos Figueredo, the 
mayor of the fishing village of Santa Barbara, near the airport. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a tremendous explosion. The plane burst into flames, and trees 
around it caught fire. Nobody could possibly have survived," Vairos Figueredo 
told the Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
All Appeared Normal 
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports had spoken of an aborted emergency landing, but airport 
officials later told reporters that all appeared normal before the crash. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot radioed Santa Maria Airport control tower three minutes before the 
crash but did not report anything wrong, Portugal's LUSA news agency quoted an 
unidentified civil aviation official as saying. 
</P>
<P>
The agency said the control tower then tried repeatedly to contact the plane 
without success. 
</P>
<P>
Radio journalist Pereira said the weather was misty around the tiny island's 
highest peak. "Some local people said they saw the plane catch fire before 
hitting the mounbtain, though there is still a lot of confusion," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Portuguese TV said an anonymous caller to its newsroom in Lisbon claimed 
responsibility for the crash on behalf of an organization called the Brigada 
Terrorista International (International Terrorist Brigade). 
</P>
<P>
Police said they knew of no group by that name and suspected that the claim was 
a hoax. 
</P>
<P>
In Smyrna, A. L. Pittman, president of Independent Air, identified the seven 
crew members as: Leon Daugherty, 41, of Nashville, Tenn., the captain; Sammy 
Adcock, 36, Nashville, 1st officer; Jorge Gonzalez, 34, Rex, Ga., the flight 
engineer; and flight attendants Yvette Murray, 26, of Marietta, Ga.; Angela 
Urban, 24, West Palm Beach, Fla.; Helen Ziegler, 45, Warner Robins, Ga., and 
Sabrina Cromarty, age unknown, Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Commander Viera da Silva of the Portugal's Pilots' Assn. described the island 
airport as perfectly safe and said he could not understand what the plane was 
doing near the mountain. "The runway approaches the sea at both ends so it is 
puzzling why the crash occurred on the mountain," he said in Lisbon. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government is sending four safety experts to the crash site to assist 
in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Boeing Co. said it is sending one investigator now and 
later will likely send additional specialists when more details of the accident 
are known. 
</P>
<P>
Pratt &amp; Whitney, maker of the 707's engines, said it too is sending an 
investigator to the crash site. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Maria lies about 1,200 miles from the Portuguese mainland, and 
communications with the island were hampered by a flood of telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman at Italy's Bergamo Airport, where the flight originated, said 
Italian tour companies had arranged the charter. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. armed forces have a big air and naval base at Lajes on the island of 
Terceira, north of Santa Maria.

STATE LEADERS URGE GAS TAX HIKE TO FUND HIGHWAY WORK

Gov. George Deukmejian and state business, labor and legislative leaders agreed 
Wednesday that an additional $20 billion will have to be pumped into the 
state's transportation system over the next decade to reduce congestion and 
keep pace with population growth. 
</P>
<P>
Emerging from a three-hour "summit" meeting, several participants said everyone 
except Deukmejian appeared to agree that a substantial gas tax increase would 
be needed to raise the kind of revenue it will take to update California's 
overcrowded highways, provide additional mass-transit facilities and initiate 
new techniques for managing congestion. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, not a single soul opposed a gas tax increase except the governor," 
said Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco). "Everyone but the 
governor was in sync that a gas tax increase has to be the primary source." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gas Tax Hike Foreseen 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Deukmejian reiterated his view that a gas tax increase is not the 
"best way" to raise the revenue. But, as he has in the past, the governor also 
said that he would "not stand in the way" of an increase as long as it was 
subject to voter approval -- a requirement legislative leaders and many of 
those attending the meeting oppose. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we ought to have nerve enough to do it ourselves," Brown said, 
predicting that there will be a gas tax hike "one way or the other." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the disagreements, the governor and legislative leaders said they had 
reached enough of a consensus on some issues that it should be feasible to 
fashion a plan to attack the state's long-range transportation needs. The 
governor said the group would meet again next month. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone seems to be in general accord that working together in good faith . . 
. we can reach some kind of agreement upon an approach to resolve the issue," 
Deukmejian told reporters afterward. 
</P>
<P>
Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) added: "I am very 
optimistic we are going to have a real product for the people of the state of 
California in the not-too-distant future." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian had invited to the meeting 27 business, labor and political leaders 
involved in transportation in an effort to develop a comprehensive plan for 
easing the mammoth traffic problems that plague California's urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
Advisers said the decision to convene the high-level meeting was a rare move 
for the governor, who seldom seeks such widespread outside advice when he is 
working on a proposal for dealing with state problems. To have called such a 
meeting, they said, was an indication of the priority Deukmejian has attached 
to the need for solving the state's transportation problems. 
</P>
<P>
The governor recently announced that he will retire from public office after 
his present term expires in 1990, and he has indicated eagerness to resolve the 
state's transportation problems before he steps down. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Maltester, president of Californians for Better Transportation, said 
recommendations at the meeting for gas tax increases ranged from 3 cents a 
gallon to 10 cents. 
</P>
<P>
He said several participants at the meeting suggested marrying a gas tax 
increase to a general-obligation bond issue. He said the bonds -- favored by 
Deukmejian -- would be used to solve an immediate funding crisis in the state's 
transportation system while money raised from a gas tax increase would go to 
long-range improvements. 
</P>
<P>
While many of the issues before the group were left unresolved, Maltester said 
the agreement on the $20-billion figure was a signal that state government and 
private business and labor leaders were ready to seek long-term solutions to 
the transportation problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody was talking about a quick fix," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of those invited to the meeting had already taken strong public stands in 
favor of a substantial increase in the state's 9-cent gasoline tax. 
</P>
<P>
In the Senate, Roberti and Sen. Quentin Kopp (I-San Francisco) have authored 
legislation that would raise the tax by 10 cents. In the Assembly, Brown and 
Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) have unveiled a proposal that would hike 
the tax by 5 cents initially and then increase it every two years for the next 
decade. Those increases would be tied to inflation. 
</P>
<P>
The sticking point in each proposal as far as the governor is concerned is that 
neither requires voter approval.

BULLET AND GILL NETS BLAMED IN DEATHS OF THREE SEA LIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LANIE JONES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly three weeks after the carcasses of 49 California sea lions mysteriously 
began washing ashore on Orange County beaches, federal biologists Wednesday 
have determined that at least one sea lion had been shot and two died in gill 
nets used by halibut fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
In a necropsy completed Wednesday on the body of a young 350-pound male sea 
lion, biologists retrieved a .30-caliber bullet that penetrated the animal's 
abdomen and killed him. It was the first piece of solid evidence that one of 
the animals had been illegally shot, said Jim Lecky, chief of the National 
Marine Fisheries protected species branch. 
</P>
<P>
And, in two other sea lion deaths, biologists reported that they found a net 
peculiar to halibut fishing wrapped around one carcass, while the neck and 
shoulder of another sea lion bore the markings of a halibut net, Lecky said. 
</P>
<P>
From that evidence and their knowledge of coastal fisheries, federal officials 
now believe that most of the Orange County sea lions died after encounters with 
fishermen -- either as they became entangled in gill nets and drowned, or were 
shot by squid fishermen protecting their catch from a marauding sea lion. 
</P>
<P>
"We are pretty much calling a conclusion to this investigation because we are 
pretty sure what's going on," Lecky said. 
</P>
<P>
Lecky said at this point there are no witnesses, so no criminal charges are 
planned. He added that since the sea lion is not an endangered species and the 
deaths are a small percentage of the population, no special surveillances are 
scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
But fishermen from San Clemente to San Pedro denied they were to blame for most 
of the deaths. 
</P>
<P>
"No gill-netter is blatantly going away and killing sea lions," said gill net 
fisherman John (The Turk) Emirzian, 50. "Probably several things are killing 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Don Hansen, a director of the California Sportsfishing Assn, some of whose 
members hunt squid, said: "Most operators just don't do that anymore (shoot sea 
lions to keep them away from their catch). Trouble is the public is quick to 
point fingers." 
</P>
<P>
Federal and private biologists said Wednesday that they had ruled out disease 
as a primary cause for the deaths because all but two of the sea lions were 
dead when they hit the shore. If they were diseased or malnourished, sea lions 
usually struggle to the shore alive, the biologists say.

The Legislature's top budget analyst on Wednesday told the Assembly Ways and 
Means Committee that the state not only ended the last fiscal year with a 
deficit but also faces more red ink this year. 
</P>
<P>
Legislative Analyst Elizabeth Hill, disputing contentions by Gov. George 
Deukmejian that the state will show small surpluses each year, claimed that the 
state ended the 1987-88 fiscal year with a $200-million deficit and probably 
will finish the current budget year $126 million in the hole. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel that you're banking on money that just is not going to be available," 
Hill warned the legislators, who are starting to review the governor's already 
precariously balanced $47.8-billion budget proposal for the fiscal year 
beginning July 1. 
</P>
<P>
With the governor already proposing to balance spending in the new fiscal year 
by making deep cuts in many health and welfare programs, Hill's assessment only 
complicates the Legislature's problem. If she is right, the Legislature might 
have to approve even deeper cuts in spending. Her assessment is in line with 
earlier warnings of a deficit that were issued by Controller Gray Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, recently confirmed Treasurer Thomas W. Hayes backed up Hill's 
contention that the state had a deficit last year, declaring that it could be 
as high as $97 million. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes, a Deukmejian appointee who took office Jan. 6, played down the 
seriousness of the problem, attributing it to a difference in accounting 
methods used by the Administration and other budget analysts. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes, speaking at his first meeting as chairman of the Commission on State 
Finance, said that since the state doesn't use a uniform method of accounting, 
"we are always going to have differences between reporting agencies." But he 
told reporters after the meeting that he thought the state's AAA credit rating 
is secure. "I don't think the sky is falling," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The commission, in a quarterly update of state revenues and expenditures, 
disagreed that there would be a deficit in the current budget year. The panel 
said it expects the state to end the current fiscal year $79 million in the 
black. Deukmejian's budget anticipates ending the year with only $3 million in 
reserve. 
</P>
<P>
Gail Lyle, the commission's executive secretary, said she expects state tax 
receipts to come in $366 million above Deukmejian Administration forecasts, 
largely as a result of a healthier economy. She said the state may even be in 
the unusual position, for such a tough budget year, of taking in $174 million 
more in revenues than it can legally spend under an expenditure limit approved 
by voters in 1974.

Seven people died in a rocket attack on central Kabul on Wednesday as Muslim 
rebels intensified their campaign to hamper the Soviet Union's hurried troop 
withdrawal from beleaguered Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.N. officials found a replacement for an EgyptAir plane whose crew 
refused to fly the first U.N. relief supplies to the embattled Afghan capital. 
</P>
<P>
At the last minute, the EgyptAir crew refused to fly to the city, which is 
preparing for the possibility of a long siege after Soviet troops complete 
their pullout next week. 
</P>
<P>
U.N. officials said an Ethiopian Airlines cargo plane arrived in Islamabad and 
was loading the 32 tons of supplies the Egyptian plane should have flown to 
Kabul on Tuesday to start a U.N. airlift of 390 tons of food and medicines. 
</P>
<P>
The refusal brought an angry response from Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, who is 
coordinating U.N. relief efforts for Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
Flying into Kabul can be hair-raising because planes descend quickly and bank 
sharply while Soviet planes circle, spewing out magnesium flares as decoys for 
possible rebel missiles. 
</P>
<P>
The rocket attack on Kabul was the first major barrage after a period of calm 
in the capital. The fatalities were caused when a rocket exploded among a crowd 
collecting flour and cooking oil from a distribution center. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet news agency Tass also reported that Muslim rebels attacked posts 
along two roads out of Afghanistan. The roads are the main land departure 
routes for an estimated 15,000 Soviet troops, the last of a force of more than 
100,000 due to leave by Feb. 15 under U.N.-mediated accords.

JETLINER IN AZORES CRASH HAD INSTRUMENT PROBLEMS IN 1987 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Boeing 707 jetliner that slammed into a mountainside Wednesday in the 
Azores after apparently straying off course was forced in July, 1987, to make 
an unscheduled landing in Atlanta when its altimeter and airspeed indicators 
gave off erroneous readings, federal records show. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1980, the aircraft has had 13 incidents that were serious enough to merit 
reporting to the Federal Aviation Administration by its owner and operator, 
Independent Air Corp. of Smyrna, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
The records also show incidents of cracks, corrosion and a series of problems 
with landing gears. In theory, the service difficulty report system was set up 
to call attention to problems that are not supposed to occur on aircraft, but 
in practice, some of the problems are not that rare. 
</P>
<P>
A. L. Pittman, president of Independent Air Corp., said the 707 did not have a 
history of mechanical or structural problems. He added that he had no 
information about the incident involving the altimeter and airspeed indicator, 
but he assumed that the problem was fixed. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't recall that, but I bet it was fixed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Altimeters, which provide a pilot with the altitude of the aircraft, operate by 
measuring air pressure, which drops as altitude increases. Accurate readings 
are important, especially when flying around mountainous areas. 
</P>
<P>
The incident was described in a computerized data base of service difficulty 
reports, which The Times obtained from the FAA. Independent Air filed the 
report with the FAA. 
</P>
<P>
Pittman said the aircraft was in good condition and in December had passed a 
major structural integrity inspection, known in the industry as a "D" check. 
</P>
<P>
Boeing said the 707 jetliner was delivered in March, 1968, to TWA, the original 
owner. Neither Boeing nor Pittman could say when the aircraft was sold by TWA 
or whether there were other owners before Independent Air acquired it. 
</P>
<P>
The four-engine 707s, which first began passenger service in 1962, are now 
widely considered out of date and uneconomical. They are no long used by any 
scheduled airlines in the United States, but 450 of the aircraft are still in 
use by foreign airlines and charter operators. 
</P>
<P>
Boeing has produced 891 of the aircraft and still builds limited numbers of 
them for the military, which uses them for airborne communications and radar 
posts. Independent Air's 707 was the 687th 707 built by Boeing. 
</P>
<P>
The 20-year old aircraft, one of two 707s owned by the company, had made 12,500 
sets of takeoffs and landings and logged 45,000 hours in the air, Pittman said 
in a telephone interview. Boeing and FAA officials said that those figures are 
not unusually high for an aircraft that age.

DON'T TRUST KHOMEINI, SHAH'S SON WARNS U.S.

"I commend the great Iranian people into the hands of the Crown Prince. . . . 
And this is my last wish." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, Shah of Iran, 1980. 
</P>
<P>
As the Bush Administration gingerly explores the chances of mending fences with 
the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's regime in Iran, the son of the former shah is 
trying to make sure it won't happen. 
</P>
<P>
"I certainly do hope that this Administration is definitely aware that even if 
the Khomeini regime is instrumental in the release of the hostages (held in 
Lebanon), one should not forget what this regime has done for the past 10 
years, what it has stood for," says Reza Pahlavi II, who has proclaimed himself 
the current Shah of Iran. 
</P>
<P>
At 28, Pahlavi is a shah without a country, a would-be king with a shy smile 
and large ambitions who travels the world seeking somehow to galvanize a 
counterrevolution. 
</P>
<P>
These days, his travels have brought him to California. He'll be in Los Angeles 
on Saturday, which marks the 10th anniversary of the Islamic revolution that 
toppled his father from power. Southern California, he notes, has more than 
450,000 Iranian exiles and is the largest such community in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last few months, Pahlavi has stepped up the pace of his political 
activity. He was recently in Britain and France. He was scheduled to stop in 
West Germany, but its government banned him from entering the country. 
</P>
<P>
At each of his stops, Pahlavi preaches the virtues of freedom and democracy for 
Iran. "I think people have a right to change their minds," observes the heir to 
the Peacock Throne. "For a majority of my countrymen, all they have to do is 
compare their present situation with what they had." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Monarchy Is One Option 
</P>
<P>
If the Khomeini regime were to fall, monarchy would be "one of the options" for 
Iran, he says, suggesting that he would like to become a constitutional 
monarch, perhaps like King Juan Carlos I of Spain. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about the democratic system where the monarchy is not ruling but 
reigns," he says. "He is a symbol for the country. He is above politics." 
</P>
<P>
That is, of course, a role far different from the one played by his autocratic 
father, whose regime tolerated no political opposition and ran one of the most 
feared secret police agencies in the world. 
</P>
<P>
A decade ago, the younger Pahlavi was still a teen-ager, a crown prince who had 
been led since birth to believe that he would someday inherit a nation. He was 
undergoing military training with the U.S. Air Force near Lubbock, Tex., on 
Jan. 16, 1979, when, after months of turbulent demonstrations, his father was 
forced to flee the country. Khomeini returned to Iran on Feb. 1, and his 
fundamentalist regime took power 10 days later. 
</P>
<P>
His father died in exile in Egypt in 1980. A few months later, Pahlavi, then 20 
years old, declared himself shah. 
</P>
<P>
These days, Pahlavi lives in northern Virginia. The small office from which he 
operates lies across the street from the main entrance of the CIA. It was that 
agency that helped to restore his father to power in a coup against nationalist 
Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh in 1953. 
</P>
<P>
"I owe my throne to God, my people -- and to you," his father later told Kermit 
Roosevelt, the CIA official who organized the shah's triumph over Mossadegh. 
(Roosevelt recounted the episode in his book, "Countercoup.") 
</P>
<P>
For the record, the younger Pahlavi says that he gets no direct support of any 
kind from the U.S. government, although he leaves open the possibility that 
such aid might come indirectly. 
</P>
<P>
"There might be various political groups that have been active in the scene (of 
Iranian opposition politics) who have had their ties and contacts with various 
governments in the world, among them certainly the United States," he explains. 
</P>
<P>
A CIA spokesman refuses to say whether the agency is helping Pahlavi. "We would 
not confirm or deny an intelligence matter," the spokesman says. 
</P>
<P>
At the State Department, one expert on Iran says he believes that the framework 
of the Islamic revolution led by Khomeini "is pretty solidly implanted" in Iran 
and that the number of people supporting any sort of return to the monarchy is 
a "dwindling group." 
</P>
<P>
But the State Department official quickly adds, "Looking back, no one could 
have predicted the last 10 years in Iran, so I don't know why we should be able 
to predict the next 10." 
</P>
<P>
Pahlavi seems to worry that the United States may try to reach some kind of 
accommodation with Khomeini's fundamentalist regime. 
</P>
<P>
"When you end up sending arms to Khomeini, when you end up practically 
condoning acts of terrorism . . . to rely on this as a policy of reconciliation 
I feel would be a grave mistake," he says. 
</P>
<P>
What Pahlavi wants from the United States, he insists, is not financial backing 
but moral support. "All we expect from the outside world is moral support for a 
cause that is worthy of defending, because we are talking about a violation of 
human rights in our country," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Pahlavi acknowledges that there also were complaints about human rights under 
his father's rule. SAVAK, the Iranian intelligence and secret police agency set 
up under the shah, was found to have arrested, detained and tortured political 
opponents of the regime. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure that my father had his sets of problems and mistakes that he made. 
I'm sure if he were to be alive, he definitely would admit to them. . . . I am 
not condoning any act of what happened. But to suggest that these things were 
state policy in the country before (1979), I think would be an exaggeration." 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Pahlavi argues, nothing that took place during his father's reign 
can compare to the horrors of the past decade. According to Amnesty 
International, thousands of people have been executed in Iran since the 1979 
revolution, some of them by firing squad or even stoning, and other Iranians 
have been punished with amputations, flogging or mutilation. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a return to the 17th Century," says Pahlavi. "At the end of the 20th 
Century, we cannot deal with issues in the Dark Ages. You cannot have a period 
of Inquisition and at the same time cope with the rest of the world." 
</P>
<P>
Pahlavi's attacks upon the Khomeini regime -- delivered in the country Khomeini 
calls the "Great Satan" -- do not go unnoticed overseas. 
</P>
<P>
Last December, a few days after the bombing of Pan American Flight 103, a 
caller claiming to represent the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution, a 
pro-Iranian group, called U.S. news agencies in London to threaten some 
unspecified action this year unless the United States deports Pahlavi. 
</P>
<P>
Pahlavi points to such threats against him as evidence that he still plays a 
politically important role in Iran. 
</P>
<P>
He insists that he keeps in close touch with events in Iran, so that "physical 
separation does not, in my case, mean isolation." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Pahlavi admits that he is now trying from a distance to do to 
Khomeini what Khomeini once did to his father: that is, to join together all 
the many different elements of Iranian society in opposition to the current 
regime. For this reason, he avoids being too specific about his vision of 
Iran's future. 
</P>
<P>
"Within 10 years, one learns a lot," he observes. "People are tired of slogans. 
People are tired of ideological debates. . . . Everybody wants to be freed from 
this nightmare."

U.S. RIGHTS STAND STIRS ISRAELIS AS UPRISING TOLL CLIMBS 
</P>

<P>
On a day that a U.S. human rights report critical of Israel stirred the 
country, four Palestinians died of Israeli bullets while an Israeli civilian 
burned to death in his vehicle. Preliminary reports indicated he was the victim 
of an Arab firebombing, but investigators later said they could not be sure. 
</P>
<P>
The Wednesday incidents are likely to be grist for the passionate arguments 
here over Israel's handling of the Arab uprising in the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip, as well as Washington's reaction to it. 
</P>
<P>
The killings of the Arabs could be used to bolster charges that Israel uses 
excessive force. The State Department's annual human rights report, issued 
Tuesday, said Israel's use of live fire had resulted in "many avoidable deaths 
and injuries." 
</P>
<P>
However, the attack on the Israeli civilian, if confirmed, would strengthen 
Israel's rebuttal. The government argues that the uprising is in essence a 
terrorist campaign against the country, that human rights criticism is 
misplaced and that the United States should stop talking to the Palestine 
Liberation Organization, which claims leadership of the uprising. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir responded to reports of the firebombing by 
saying: "It's a very grave event. It shows there is no relation between the 
report in Washington and the reality of this country." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli settlers who live on the West Bank demanded that the Israeli 
army crack down harder on Palestinians throwing stones or gasoline bombs. Some 
tried to enter Arab villages, apparently seeking revenge, but were headed off 
by soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
The first of Wednesday's Palestinian fatalities occurred when Arab prisoners 
rioted at a jail in northern Israel after visitors outside began to wave 
Palestinian flags. 
</P>
<P>
After shooting tear gas and bullets made of plastic and metal at the rioters, 
troops opened fire with full metal rounds, killing one prisoner. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly afterward, two youths were shot to death in stone-throwing clashes with 
the army in separate villages in the West Bank. A third man died in an Israeli 
hospital after being hit in the head by a bullet the day before. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the State Department had put the toll of Palestinians killed in the 
intifada, as the uprising is known in Arabic, at 366. 
</P>
<P>
The apparent firebombing occurred near the West Bank settlement of Alfei 
Menashe, not far from Israel's official border. The army initially said that 
the driver, Albert Jerussi, 38, was returning to his home in the settlement 
when a Molotov cocktail hit his vehicle and burst into flames. Later, they said 
they could not find debris from the bomb and could not confirm that it was an 
ambush. 
</P>
<P>
Jerussi, a father of three, died before arriving at a hospital in Kfar Sava. He 
would be the 15th Israeli killed since the intifada began in December, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the State Department human rights report had been 
front-page news in all Israeli newspapers. Opposition members of Parliament 
called for the government to resign over the criticism. 
</P>
<P>
The report found fault not only with the use of bullets by Israeli troops but 
also with other means Israel uses to fight the uprising: detentions without 
trial, demolition of homes and the expulsion of Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
An array of Israeli officials publicly described the criticism as "harsh," 
"tough," "exaggerated" and "lamentable," while privately, they wondered how a 
widening gap in viewpoints with Washington might affect relations. 
</P>
<P>
Israel considers the intifada to be part of a terrorist campaign to destroy the 
country. As such, it is no more than an extension of past wars made on Israel 
by the hostile Arab world. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the State Department report claimed that the uprising stems from 
activities of "primarily young men and women motivated by Palestinian 
nationalism and a desire to bring the occupation to an end." 
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials say they have been assured the human rights report will not 
impair overall ties with the United States, a relationship that includes close 
military cooperation and about $3 billion a year in aid from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
However, it is apparent not all is unchanged; unlike last year, the State 
Department did not give Israel an advance text of the report. 
</P>
<P>
In December, then-Secretary of State George P. Shultz decided to open talks 
with the PLO. Shultz accepted the PLO's verbal renunciation of terrorism as one 
of the bases for talks. 
</P>
<P>
Israel claimed that the PLO had not changed and has tried to reverse 
Washington's decision. Over the weekend, Israel said its troops aborted an 
attempt by an armed PLO unit to infiltrate Israel and kill civilians. The PLO 
responded that its guerrillas were after military targets.

A day of renewed bickering over how to handle classified information at the 
trial began when Justice Department officials filed court papers complaining 
that rules announced in December by U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell for 
dealing with it were so loose that North's defense lawyers could compromise 
national secrets without advance warning to government security analysts. 
</P>
<P>
They asked Gesell to impose more specific curbs on what evidence North's 
lawyers might introduce to defend him. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hearing Is Tense 
</P>
<P>
But Gesell, during a tense 75-minute hearing in open court Wednesday, rebuked 
Justice Department attorneys for waiting so long to raise such serious 
concerns, saying that he had invited Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh months ago to 
take part in pretrial discussions about classified material. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh, who heads a team of inter-agency security experts, determined last 
month that the government could not provide sensitive documents needed to try 
the primary charges of conspiracy and theft against North and independent 
counsel Lawrence E. Walsh asked that they be dropped. 
</P>
<P>
North remains charged with 12 counts, including destruction of documents and 
giving false statements to Congress and a presidential board of inquiry. What 
the Justice Department claimed Wednesday is that still more secrets might be at 
risk if the trial proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
In a filing signed by Edward S. G. Dennis Jr., chief of the department's 
criminal division, the Bush Administration said that Gesell had failed to 
establish "clear procedural rules" before trial. It added sharply that "the 
court has apparently concluded that the United States therefore must accept 
risks" that North will disclose classified material not relevant to the trial. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
North Criticized 
</P>
<P>
The filing charged further that North "has made no effort to assist the court 
in dealing responsibly with classified information." It represented harsh 
criticism of North, a man once cleared to handle top-secret documents who was 
praised by President Bush and once hailed by former President Ronald Reagan as 
"a national hero." 
</P>
<P>
Walsh, although concurring last month in Thornburgh's determination that the 
core charges against North would have to be abandoned on national security 
grounds, disagreed with the latest claims by the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate filing, Walsh said that he supports Gesell's previous orders 
dealing with classified information according to specific categories. 
</P>
<P>
And while he believed some clarification of the orders would be desirable, 
Walsh declared: "We're ready to go to trial, and we don't want delays." 
</P>
<P>
Gesell told Dennis and his deputy, Stephen Saltzburg, that they can either 
accept the rules he has established or they can prohibit the use altogether of 
certain classified information. The second option could block North's trial if 
Gesell decided that the prohibited information were essential. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to stay out of your turf -- but I'm not going to let you run mine," 
Gesell said sternly. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to do my level best to protect the national security secrets, but I 
want to do even more to give this man (North) a fair trial. . . . I'm going to 
get a fair trial, or we won't have a trial." 
</P>
<P>
Gesell served notice that he plans to impanel a 12-member jury and six 
alternates today from a final pool of 45 prospective jurors. Opening statements 
in the trial by prosecutors and defense attorneys would follow, he said.

FEINSTEIN, WILSON LEAD PARTIES IN GOVERNOR POLL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEITH LOVE, Times Political Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California political grapevine crackled Wednesday with word of a new poll 
that reportedly shows former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein leading the 
1990 Democratic gubernatorial field, five points ahead of two veteran state 
officeholders, Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp and Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy. 
</P>
<P>
According to reports circulating widely among political observers, the new 
California Poll, to be published today, shows Feinstein was the first choice of 
27% of the Democrats who were read a list of names often mentioned as potential 
gubernatorial candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp and McCarthy were next with 22% each and Controller Gray Davis was 
the choice of 7%. 
</P>
<P>
On the Republican side, it apparently was a blowout for U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson, 
who is expected to announce his plans to seek the governorship in the next few 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson was the first choice of 47% of the Republicans. Baseball Commissioner 
Peter V. Ueberroth, who has indicated that he might be interested in running if 
Wilson does not, was the choice of 19%. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates, who has already formed an exploratory 
committee for governor, was third with 8%. Next were state Sen. Bill Campbell 
of Hacienda Heights with 5%, former Rep. Dan Lungren of Long Beach with 3% and 
state Sen. John Seymour of Anaheim with 1%. 
</P>
<P>
The California Poll, conducted by Mervin Field of San Francisco, is the first 
independent survey in what is expected to be a lively governor's race. 
</P>
<P>
Through a spokesman, Van de Kamp pronounced himself satisfied with the poll 
results. 
</P>
<P>
"The three contenders are all running evenly, which we expected," the attorney 
general said. He excluded Davis from the ranks of the contenders because of a 
single-digit finish. 
</P>
<P>
As for Feinstein, Van de Kamp noted that she had fallen slightly and that he 
had picked up slightly since a similar four-way sampling a year ago. "That's a 
good trend," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Political professionals said Wednesday that they do not lend too much credence 
to a poll taken 22 months before the election. But they said the numbers are a 
factor in this early stage as potential candidates make plans to raise money 
and hire consultants. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a big, wide, wonderful world," said media consultant Kam Kuwata of Santa 
Monica, an adviser to Davis. "The race is wide open, there is no real 
front-runner and there's a little bit in the poll for each candidate to be 
happy about." 
</P>
<P>
The fact that Van de Kamp did not finish first gives comfort to Davis and 
others who have been insisting that the attorney general will not have the 
Democratic nomination locked up despite his methodical gathering of 
contributions and party support. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp is the only Democrat who has said he will definitely seek the 
governorship. He has said he will not seek reelection as attorney general and 
has formed an exploratory committee for governor. He already has about $1 
million in his campaign coffers. 
</P>
<P>
Davis has about $750,000 he could use to seek reelection as controller or to 
seek the governorship. He said he will decide soon which job he wants. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein's lead in the early poll is expected to increase the likelihood that 
she will convert her current exploratory committee into a full-fledged 
candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mayor for 10 Years 
</P>
<P>
She was mayor of San Francisco from 1978 to 1988 and could not run again under 
city law. Since leaving office she has been working on a book and sizing up her 
future in politics. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein was seriously considered as a running mate for Walter F. Mondale, the 
1984 Democratic presidential candidate, and was the "host" mayor for Mondale's 
1984 Democratic National Convention. 
</P>
<P>
The publicity she got then and the fact that she has been the mayor of one of 
California's leading cities probably account for her standing in the new poll, 
according to political professionals. 
</P>
<P>
On the Republican side, the popularity of Wilson in his party was evident in 
the answers to another question asked in the California Poll. 
</P>
<P>
When respondents were asked, yes or no, if they were "inclined" to vote for 
Wilson, 78% said yes and 14% said no. 
</P>
<P>
The news was not so good for Ueberroth. Forty percent of the Republicans said 
they would be inclined to vote for him while 41% said no. 
</P>
<P>
That probably reflects the fact that Ueberroth, while winning high marks as 
baseball commissioner and as president of the organization that staged the 1984 
Olympics in Los Angeles, has not run for public office and would be an unknown 
quantity for some Republican activists.

CALIF. DRIVERS TO GET PLASTIC LICENSES IN '90 
</P>

<P>
New drivers' licenses that resemble plastic credit cards will be issued to 
California motorists beginning next year as the state begins phasing out 
traditional paper licenses, it was announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the new licenses will have magnetic information strips, 
making it easier for police officers to issue traffic tickets. Once patrol cars 
are outfitted with the necessary equipment, officers will be able to run the 
license through a scanner and have a computer printer produce a citation on the 
spot. 
</P>
<P>
While the format of the new licenses will be similar to the current ones, the 
plastic cards will have a digitalized color photograph and signature embedded 
in the plastic, making the cards "unalterable," said Bill Gangler, spokesman 
for the Department of Motor Vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the major things, of course, is that it makes the information on the 
driver's license more secure," Gangler said. "It will cut down substantially on 
driver's license abuse by individuals under 21." 
</P>
<P>
Gangler also said the DMV will be able to replace lost licenses more promptly. 
Motorists will no longer have to make a trip to the DMV office to obtain a 
replacement, because department computers will store the photograph and 
signature data. It will be possible to arrange for a replacement over the phone 
and have it mailed. 
</P>
<P>
The department said the new licenses should only cost "a few pennies" more to 
produce than the old ones.

CRASH VICTIMS ARE MOURNED IN ENSENADA

<TEXT>
<P>
This seaside city mourned its dead Wednesday, an emotional day that concluded 
with multiple burial services in a hillside cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
Beneath leaden skies and acrid smoke from the nearby city dump, hundreds of 
residents turned out for the interment of most of the victims of Monday's bus 
crash -- called the worst vehicular accident ever in this city 70 miles south 
of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
At least 16 people died when the bus veered off a steep road and plunged 50 
yards down a precipice; more than 2 dozen others were injured, many seriously. 
Some estimates put the death toll as high as 19, but there was no official 
confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
Officials vowed a thorough investigation, but authorities and officials of the 
bus company were quick to point out that some accidents are unavoidable. 
Authorities said the vehicle's brakes apparently failed. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an unfortunate event, but accidents do happen," said Elias Padilla 
Gonzalez, chief of the state transportation department in Ensenada. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Padilla agreed, the vehicle probably hadn't been inspected for more than a 
year, in apparent violation of a law that requires a state inspection every two 
months. But he noted that he had only been in office for two weeks and had 
already begun a new round of inspections for the entire urban transport system. 
Besides, he added, the accident might have occurred even if there had been 
adequate inspections. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the bus company or authorities are responsible for this 
unfortunate incident," Padilla said. 
</P>
<P>
Such sentiment was small consolation to survivors and to relatives and friends 
of the dead. They expressed outrage and anger, most of it directed at state 
officials and the Rojo y Blanco (Red and White) transport cooperative, which 
owned the bus. The mourners, most of them poor like the victims, gathered at 
the funeral home and by the graveside, venting their frustration at what they 
view as yet another example of the compromises made with their safety and 
well-being. Many had ashes on their foreheads in observance of Ash Wednesday, 
the first day of Lent. 
</P>
<P>
"These buses are in the worst condition, and we have to ride them; we have no 
choice," said a tearful Ofelia Avalos de Trejo, whose 19-year-old son, Javier, 
was among the victims. 
</P>
<P>
Ten months earlier, she had lost her youngest child, a 12-year-old girl, to 
kidney disease. The family, like so many others in northern Mexico, were 
migrants from the Mexican interior -- in this case, the southern state of 
Guerrero -- who had come to the north seeking a better life. 
</P>
<P>
"Javier was a good boy," the mother said as journalists and onlookers gathered 
on the street outside the funeral home. "He never drank or smoked. He was going 
to school. He wanted to better himself." 
</P>
<P>
Inside the funeral home, the body of her son was on view in his coffin; a few 
long-stemmed roses rested on his chest. He wore a denim jacket. 
</P>
<P>
The corpses were laid out in four rooms. In the largest, eight victims were 
lined up side by side. The faces showed obvious signs of trauma. Before the 
</P>
<P>
caskets were closed, a priest said a prayer. 
</P>
<P>
Condemnation of the local transportation service was widespread here. In every 
Mexican city, the vintage buses, often former school buses from the United 
States, provide a lifeline to the outlying communities where much of the 
population lives. But residents complained of the buses' dilapidated condition, 
their constant tardiness and unreliability and the sometimes-reckless driving 
habits of those behind the wheels. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of these vehicles aren't fit for animals," said Crecensio Hernandez 
Ramirez, a 29-year-old father of four who came to the wake to pay tribute to a 
co-worker who died in the crash. "My children could have been on that bus! What 
would I have done then?" 
</P>
<P>
At the headquarters of the Rojo y Blanco bus company near downtown, officials 
said they regretted the loss of life. But, they insisted, the bus -- a 1968 
Chevrolet -- was in good shape: It had made three other runs Monday morning 
before the accident, which occurred at 11:30 a.m. The driver, Martin Rosales 
Mexica, although only 21 and an employee for less than a year, was a qualified 
driver, they said. (He died in the crash.) Officials acknowledged that the 
company's insurance policy had lapsed a few days earlier, but they described 
that as only a technicality. 
</P>
<P>
"We wouldn't allow a vehicle with mechanical problems to go into service," said 
Adrian Ramirez Martinez, president of the 120-vehicle company, which transports 
about 15,000 city residents each day. 
</P>
<P>
At any rate, the company's civil liability appears to be limited under Mexican 
law. There were no hordes of lawyers contacting family members, as there might 
have been if the accident had occurred in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
A state prosecutor, Fernando Cota Pedrin, said the firm must pick up the tab 
for funeral and medical expenses, which are likely to total less than $20,000. 
The company, Cota said, is also required to provide remuneration to the 
families of the dead. One estimate put the amount at $2,000 per family, 
although it was unclear whether all will be entitled to that amount. 
</P>
<P>
As for potential criminal charges, Cota said it was unclear whether there was 
any criminal liability. An investigation is continuing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Late in the day, mourners made their way to the small cemetery on the outskirts 
of the town. By the time the hearses arrived, hundreds had gathered around the 
freshly dug graves. A man carried white wooden crosses bearing the names of the 
dead. Inmates observed from atop the walls of the nearby jail. 
</P>
<P>
Before the sun set, mourners were placing earth on the final resting places of 
Javier Trejo and the others who perished on the last trip of Rojo y Blanco bus 
No. 137.

GOLDING AGENDA FOR COUNTY PROPOSES DRUGS COURT, SAVING OPEN SPACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Setting an ambitious agenda for her year as chairman of the San Diego County 
Board of Supervisors, Susan Golding on Wednesday proposed creation of a special 
"drugs court" and a $250-million bond to protect open space. 
</P>
<P>
Calling for a "return to the pioneering spirit that made San Diego County what 
it is today," Golding -- who last month became the second woman in the county's 
138-year history named to chair the board, a position rotated annually among 
the five members -- used her State of the County address to launch a wide range 
of policy initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to her special drugs court and open-space proposals, Golding 
outlined specific plans to address problems as disparate as AIDS, child abuse, 
the greenhouse effect and auto theft, and urged establishment of a 
public-private panel to chart the region's future. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Faith in Individuals 
</P>
<P>
Providing a philosophical backdrop for those ideas, Golding, throughout her 
20-minute speech, frequently exhorted her colleagues and local citizens to have 
faith in individuals' power to tackle complex local and even global problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Global problems do at times seem insoluble," Golding told a shivering crowd of 
about 200 who listened to the speech in cool, breezy weather outside the County 
Administration Center. "They are too big, too complex, too difficult. We shrug 
our shoulders and say, 'What can one person do?' But, in reality, they are 
frequently nothing more than local problems, lumped together." 
</P>
<P>
Urging local residents to "remember the power we hold in our hands," Golding 
demonstrated her conviction in the efficacy of individual action by challenging 
county residents to plant at least 1 million trees in the next two years as a 
means of slowing the greenhouse effect. Golding said she will ask the board to 
label that program Operation ReLeaf. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Simple Step' 
</P>
<P>
"Planting a tree is a simple step that we can each take to do our share to stop 
the damage to our atmosphere," Golding said. 
</P>
<P>
To help promote environmental protection throughout the region, Golding, in 
conjunction with San Diego City Councilman Ron Roberts and La Mesa Mayor Fred 
Nagel, also proposed a $250-million bond to be used to purchase open space and 
to help cities improve park and recreation facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Under her proposed San Diego County Regional Parks, Wildlife and Open Space 
Bond Act of 1990, funds would be available to the county and incorporated 
cities to purchase environmentally sensitive and historically significant 
lands, and to expand or rehabilitate existing parks and open space. Each 
community would have authority to decide how the funds would be spent in that 
particular area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Two-Thirds Vote 
</P>
<P>
Assuming that the bond proposal eventually is put before voters countywide, it 
would require a two-thirds vote for approval. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm under no illusion. . . . It's a tough thing to do," Golding said after her 
speech. "But if there's one thing San Diegans want, it's this -- they want to 
preserve the environment, and they want park lands and open space. There's only 
one way to preserve major tracts of open space, and that's to purchase them." 
</P>
<P>
Turning to other pressing local issues, Golding called for stiffer punishment 
of persons convicted of drug-related offenses. Noting that the county's 
overburdened court system all but preordains plea bargains in many drug cases, 
Golding said she has asked local judges to create a special court where only 
cases involving the sale and possession of illegal drugs would be heard. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Favorably Received 
</P>
<P>
That idea, Golding said, has been received favorably by Superior Court 
Presiding Judge Michael Greer, but its execution may await the filling of 18 
vacant local judgeships by Gov. George Deukmejian. Golding also called on the 
judges to strictly enforce tougher new statewide penalties for auto theft, 
arguing that those thefts -- 30,000 of which occurred in San Diego County last 
year -- are closely linked to drug crimes. 
</P>
<P>
On other topics, Golding: 
</P>
<P>
* Recommended creation of a countywide task force, called "San Diego: Vision 
2020," to provide "a clear view to the future" through studies of the region's 
anticipated 21st Century needs in areas ranging from the economy and education 
to transportation and culture. Members would include public officials, business 
and civic leaders, as well as the heads of educational, cultural and religious 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
* Proposed formation of a committee consisting of public and private health 
officials to "find a better way to meet the AIDS challenge." The panel would 
include representatives of the San Diego County Medical Society, the Council of 
Community Clinics, UC San Diego's Owen Clinic, the Hospital Council and the 
county Health Department. 
</P>
<P>
* Said she plans to ask the Board of Supervisors to sponsor state legislation 
providing foster parents with full reimbursement of their expenses, a proposal 
that she argued could reduce child abuse by enhancing efforts to recruit foster 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
* Requested review of all county policies affecting water usage to promote 
water conservation and reclamation. Pointing out that San Diego imports about 
90% of its water, and is "at the end of the pipeline," Golding argued for 
policies mandating the use of reclaimed, non-potable water for purposes such as 
irrigation.

ESCONDIDO COUNCIL VOTES TO PRESSURE FOR TOXIC-SITE CLEANUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Escondido City Council voted Wednesday night to join with San Diego County 
officials to force the state hazardous-materials agency to clean up a 
toxic-waste site with the money already allocated for the job. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Carla DeDominicis had sought council support to spend $200,000 to 
remove the highly volatile toxic materials from the Chatham Brothers Barrel 
Yard in rural southwest Escondido to an approved disposal site for toxic 
wastes. 
</P>
<P>
But a county hazardous-waste expert told the council members that federal 
legislation prevents removal of the contaminated soil to a toxic-waste dump. 
</P>
<P>
"Until Congress changed the law (last November), that avenue was open to us," 
David Merk said. However, other methods of on-site treatment, less costly than 
the alternatives the state agency is proposing, should be explored so the site 
can be cleaned up with the $1 million remaining to be spent, Merk said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Funding for Studies 
</P>
<P>
DeDominicis pointed out that the state has spent $1.2 million to $1.5 million 
on studies and tests of the Chatham site, but "not one spade of dirt has been 
removed." 
</P>
<P>
A city-county effort to speed up the cleanup would include attempts to change 
the federal law so that Chatham waste could be placed in a toxic landfill. 
Under the effort, research into on-site treatment of the toxic wastes would be 
carried out. 
</P>
<P>
A frustrated DeDominicis pointed out that the state Department of Health 
Services has been studying the problem for nearly seven years, "and, until 
three months ago, they could have resolved it." 
</P>
<P>
She added that the state has spent all its $100-million environmental 
"Superfund" allotment without accomplishing the cleanup the fund was intended 
to provide. 
</P>
<P>
Councilmen Ernie Cowan and Kris Murphy were concerned that the city might be 
getting in over its head in taking on the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
"I am afraid that we are only scratching the surface" by proposing a $200,000 
cleanup with city funds, Cowan said, "and that we might end up having to foot a 
$10-million bill for the whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
State Toxic Substances Control Division estimates for the total cleanup of the 
Chatham site range from $8 million to $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
Merk said state officials are not considering an on-site cleanup, which could 
be accomplished by introducing bacteria into the soils to break down and 
destroy the toxic materials. That process is called biodegradation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Don't Have the Money' 
</P>
<P>
"The county has the method but we don't have the money," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said there is a constant danger that the toxics on the site might get into 
the ground water unless they are removed or treated. State officials are 
proposing a study to determine the contamination, he said, but a cleanup would 
ensure that further contamination does not occur. 
</P>
<P>
Both DeDominicis and Merk said future state funding for cleanup work on the 
more than 100 toxic-waste sites in California "is very questionable." 
</P>
<P>
Merk contends that the Chatham waste can be neutralized on site at a much lower 
cost than the incineration method the state proposes. 
</P>
<P>
The industrial dump site has been on the state's Superfund list since 1982. 
But, with no funds remaining in the state fund, there is no guarantee of a 
cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
However, homeowners and property owners near the site have lost patience with 
the slow progress by the state, and have pressed for removal of the toxic 
wastes within the next year with $1 million in allocated state funds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Very Complex' Site 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the state toxic control agency said Monday that a few other local 
agencies have undertaken cleanup operations, including one in the Long Beach 
area and a few in Los Angeles. However, they stressed that those had been 
"small, uncomplicated" cleanups, while the Chatham site is "very complex," 
requiring extensive studies before actual removal of the toxic waste is 
attempted. 
</P>
<P>
One state official, John Scandura, said most cities shy away from doing their 
own cleanups because of possible liability claims. 
</P>
<P>
State officials met with a local advisory group Monday to detail new plans to 
use less-expensive methods of removal, but stressed that the federal 
Environmental Protection Agency has not yet approved using those methods for 
the Chatham toxics. 
</P>
<P>
Scandura said his department expects to learn this week whether a 
less-expensive method of disposal can be used. If the toxic waste from Chatham 
can be deposited in approved dumps, state toxic-waste officials estimate the 
initial cleanup of 400 cubic yards of contaminated soil and 200 or so barrels 
of industrial waste could be accomplished before the end of 1989 with the funds 
now available. 
</P>
<P>
Merk said the dispute between state and federal hazardous-waste agencies is "a 
matter of policy" and not a technical problem. If the Chatham site were listed 
as a federal toxic-waste site, the materials could be disposed of in an 
approved toxic dump. But, since it is not on the federal list, "another set of 
regulations apply" that require political clout to remove, Merk said. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Koolhaas, an aide to state Sen. William Craven (R-Oceanside) said 
Craven, who was instrumental in allocating the last of the funds in the 
Superfund to the Chatham site, is monitoring the situation and is ready to aid 
in speeding up the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
DeDominicis, in a letter to her council colleagues, suggested that it is time 
for the city to do the job the state has not accomplished in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is the federal government and the county government have the 
way, but our state government doesn't have the will to find a solution," 
DeDominicis said.

OCEANSIDE CITY COUNCIL ACTS TO HONOR DR. KING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE YASUDA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Oceanside City Council, anxious to avoid the controversy that has erupted 
in San Diego over choosing an appropriate tribute to Dr. Martin Luther King 
Jr., Wednesday approved six proposals to honor the slain civil-rights leader. 
</P>
<P>
The five council members unanimously supported all but one recommendation 
drafted by an ad hoc committee established last June by the council that is 
charged with developing ideas for a memorial to King. 
</P>
<P>
The council approved the committee's recommendations to name a new public park 
and a meeting room in the city's new Civic Center in honor of King, acquire a 
statue or bust, create a scholarship fund and a citizen award and establish a 
Dr. Martin Luther King book collection at the public library. 
</P>
<P>
But, to the disappointment of leaders from the National Assn. for the 
Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the council declined to adopt a proposal 
by the committee to change the name of the Oceanside Public Library to the Dr. 
Martin Luther King Jr. Library when it moves to its new home. 
</P>
<P>
The public library, which has maintained its existing name for 84 years, will 
be expanded and housed in the Civic Center, which is under construction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Somewhat Disappointed' 
</P>
<P>
"I'm somewhat disappointed," said Reginald Owens, president of the North County 
Chapter of the NAACP, who also served on the committee. "I thought we could 
have made a little more progress. But I feel good that we can do those other 
things. It's a move in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
To the relief of community leaders, that direction steered council and 
committee members away from a King tribute controversy similar to the one that 
has raged in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
A proposal to place King's name on the $160-million San Diego Convention Center 
has once again stirred an emotional debate that first emerged more than a year 
ago when San Diego voters stripped King's name from Market Street. 
</P>
<P>
The seven-member board of the San Diego Unified Port District is expected to 
address the name change this month. The port commissioners' vote is required 
because the uncompleted convention center sits on Port District land. The San 
Diego City Council must also approve the change. 
</P>
<P>
"This is something we were trying to do to honor Dr. King in a spirit of 
harmony," said Dana Whitson, who was the city's liaison to the committee. "It 
wasn't supposed to be divisive. We wanted to avoid the controversy that's going 
on in San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
The recommendation to name the new library after King was supported by a 
majority of the committee, which included representatives from the NAACP, the 
Oceanside Chamber of Commerce, the library's trustees, community residents and 
representatives from the city's Human Relations and Parks and Recreation 
commissions. 
</P>
<P>
Library trustees previously voted to oppose the name change, arguing that they 
wanted to maintain the existing name, Oceanside Public Library, which has wide 
public recognition and has been in use for 84 years. 
</P>
<P>
They were also concerned that the proposed name, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. 
Library, would give a false impression that it contains a significant 
collection of books and materials about King. That could also imply, it was 
feared, that the library serves a limited purpose rather than the needs of the 
general reader. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Library Name 
</P>
<P>
"We have built our history, our knowledge, our reputation as one of the best 
libraries in the state as the Oceanside Public Library," said Irene Duehren, 
chairwoman of the library's board of trustees. "The name has been in use since 
the city was incorporated. It's just like the name of a well-established 
business that has recognition. You wouldn't change its name either." 
</P>
<P>
The trustees, however, endorsed the recommendation to establish a King book 
collection at the new library. 
</P>
<P>
"Those of us who been exposed to the library have been very proud of its 
success," said Mayor Larry Bagley, who sympathized with the trustees' concerns. 
"I resist changing the library's name." 
</P>
<P>
But Owens, the committee spokesman, disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand their concern for historic preservation, but I think it's a tired 
rationale," Owens said. "We have to keep in tune with progress. The nation has 
a new holiday to honor not only a national hero, but an international hero. The 
city is going to have a new civic center and a new library. I think it's 
appropriate that the library be named after Dr. King."

TRIP OFF, BUT LIFE GOES ON AFTER BYPASS

Bob Wells had been looking forward to his two-week vacation all year. 
</P>
<P>
He had it planned perfectly. First, he and his wife, Darlene, would fly to 
Acapulco from Los Angeles International Airport. From there, they would head to 
Panama. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for Wells, they never boarded the plane. That was about the time 
the chest pains hit him, on Jan. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Deciding the pains were serious enough to put the vacation on hold, but not 
serious enough to go to an emergency room in Los Angeles, the Wellses drove 
back to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rented a Car and Came Home 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't in such pain where I thought we couldn't drive back," Wells said. "We 
toyed with the idea of going to a medical center there. But we got a rental car 
and came back. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe, he said, "I could have taken the trip with no problems, but I would have 
had a massive heart attack sooner or later." 
</P>
<P>
Wells, 61, executive director of the Rancho Bernardo Chamber of Commerce, went 
to Palomar Memorial Hospital that afternoon. The next day, he received an 
angiogram, a procedure done under local anesthesia in which a small catheter is 
threaded to the main arteries of the heart. A liquid shot into the arteries 
allows any narrowing to show up on X-ray. 
</P>
<P>
The films showed blockage in each of the three major arteries and in the 
branches, but otherwise a healthy heart. Two days later, Wells was scheduled 
for seven-way coronary bypass surgery. 
</P>
<P>
"He knew he was having problems," said cardiologist Roger Acheatel, who made 
the initial diagnosis and performed the angiogram. "He knew things were 
changing. That's why he drove back here." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Heart Is Stopped 
</P>
<P>
Wells' surgery consisted of removing a vein from his leg and using it and 
another artery to construct a bypass of the seven arteries. The heart was 
stopped during surgery, and doctors used blood previously donated by Wells. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Reichman, the surgeon who performed the bypass, predicted a two- to 
three-month recovery period. Meanwhile, Wells will be sure to follow through 
with therapy and take aspirin every day. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel very glad it's over with," he said. "I feel good, and I seem to be 
coming back better than they anticipate." 
</P>
<P>
Wells' septuple bypass surgery is by no means a record, doctors say, but it is 
not a usual occurrence. Reichman said that blockage of four to five vessels is 
more common. 
</P>
<P>
Both he and Acheatel said the fact that Wells was in good shape before the 
surgery has aided in his recovery. 
</P>
<P>
For her part, Darlene Wells is relieved and happy. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad we didn't get on the plane," she said. "I'm glad it's all over and 
turned out as well as it did." 
</P>
<P>
As for the trip to Acapulco, she remains optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping to go," she said.

<P>
A woman who assisted her boyfriend's escape from Mercy Hospital by helping him 
kidnap a private security guard surrendered early Wednesday and told 
investigators she was tired of running, a sheriff's spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators arrested Teresa Juliana Reyes, 24, of the 5000 block of Skyline 
Drive in San Diego shortly after 4:30 a.m. on suspicion of conspiracy to 
kidnap, kidnaping and escape with force. She remained in County Jail at Las 
Colinas on Wednesday in lieu of $510,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Reyes approached a police officer early Wednesday at 14th Street and Broadway 
in San Diego and volunteered to surrender, the spokesman said. Deputy Edward 
Augustine took her into custody. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators are still searching for Reyes' boyfriend, Michael Ismael Valadez, 
27. He had been taken to the hospital for treatment of a gunshot wound after a 
car chase Jan. 26 with National City police. He was arrested on suspicion of 
narcotics and weapons violations and was being held on a no-bail warrant on a 
robbery charge. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 29, Reyes was given permission to visit Valadez. When she arrived at 
Valadez's room, she told the guard stationed outside the door that she had a 
bomb and a weapon in a sack, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Reyes and Valadez then forced the unarmed guard, 28-year-old John Lowery, to 
take Valadez, in a wheelchair, to the first floor and then out to Reyes' car, 
the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
At Lowery's request, the pair let him go in Tijuana. Lowery made his way back 
to the border and telephoned the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Lowery is an employee of Wackenhut Corp., a security firm under contract to the 
sheriff.

A 55-year-old Jamul man suffered fatal head injuries Tuesday night when his 
truck collided with a car at Granite Hills Drive and Madison Avenue in El 
Cajon, police reported. 
</P>
<P>
Robert John Weaklem was driving north on Granite Hills Drive about 9:30 p.m. 
when he failed to stop at Madison Avenue, where there is a stop sign, police 
said. The pickup struck a car eastbound on Madison Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Weaklem was ejected from the truck as it rolled once and crashed through a 
wooden fence behind a house, police said. He was pronounced dead at the scene. 
The car's driver was treated for minor head injuries and released, a police 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the accident was under investigation Wednesday.

A frightened 8-year-old girl who testified Wednesday in the murder trial of an 
El Cajon man accused of killing his girlfriend's daughter said she saw the 
victim being abducted by someone in a red car. 
</P>
<P>
The third-grader spoke very softly and appeared frightened during her testimony 
in Matthew LeSure's trial in San Diego Superior Court. LeSure, 28, is charged 
with brutally beating 2-year-old Sarah Toussant on June 14. Her body was found 
in a trash bin not far from their home. 
</P>
<P>
The 8-year-old, who took long pauses before answering questions, said she saw 
Sarah Toussant get into a red Ford with four doors the day she disappeared. She 
said the girl was wearing a sailor suit. 
</P>
<P>
Her testimony is at odds with the prosecution's theory of the case, which is 
that LeSure beat the child and put the body in the trash bin. 
</P>
<P>
She said the 2-year-old was crying and was grabbed by someone in the red car. 
</P>
<P>
A playmate who testified later said she told the first girl about Sarah 
Toussant being missing. 
</P>
<P>
The second girl, a sixth-grader, said the third-grader did not mention seeing 
the little girl taken away in a red car. 
</P>
<P>
A tape recording of a phone call to El Cajon police was also played for the 
jury. LeSure was heard telling police about the girl's disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
"I had her there (in a park), and I fell asleep, and when I woke up she was 
gone. This is killing me."

Martha Clarke will not be bringing "The Garden of Earthly Delights" to the Old 
Globe in May as scheduled. The much-heralded event by the iconoclastic director 
-- a wordless theatrical realization of Hieronymus Bosch paintings of heaven 
and hell -- seemed to signal an avant-garde departure for the Globe when it was 
announced for the May 4-25 slot. The show, which blends theater, music, visual 
art and dance, has played twice in New York as well as Spain, Italy and 
Austria. A marketing director from Cal Perfomances at University of California, 
Berkeley, said that, because of a disagreement about booking dates for Clarke's 
production in San Diego, a West Coast tour was canceled. The Globe, which 
offered "The Garden of Earthly Delights" as an alternate choice for "Blood 
Wedding" in its subscription series, has not yet announced a replacement.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: DANCE / EILEEN SONDAK;

FAMINE NOW FEAST AS ACTS STEP ON EACH OTHER'S TOES

<P>
The new year got off to a sluggish start for dance buffs with the cancellation 
of the Limon company's January concert. But February promises a double dose of 
big-league dance and a pair of noteworthy grass-roots efforts as well. 
</P>
<P>
Kodo and Ballet Hispanico of New York, two acclaimed imports, are San 
Diego-bound this weekend. Stage Seven Dance Theater will end a nine-month 
hiatus with a concert of new works, and California Ballet will jump the gun on 
the Soviet Arts Festival by showcasing four Soviet dancers in its winter 
repertory concert. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, three of these events are scheduled for the same two nights. 
Kodo's stay in Symphony Hall and Stage Seven's City College Theater stint go 
head to head Feb. 10-11, while Ballet Hispanico locks horns with both during a 
one-night stand at Mandeville Auditorium on Feb. 11. 
</P>
<P>
Providing a clearing house for dance concerts was one of the primary goals of 
the San Diego Area Dance Alliance when it announced plans to print a bimonthly 
calendar of events, so why the destructive overlap? 
</P>
<P>
"We have so many more activities than we did eight years ago," said alliance 
executive director Tom Corcoran. "We do put notices about dates in our 
newsletter, but the real problem is that people are dictated to by the 
availability of space and the availability of performers. 
</P>
<P>
"With so few affordable theaters for dance, they don't have any choice. 
Sometimes they're caught in that bind of having to schedule performances in 
spite of conflicts. It's too bad for real danceomanes," Corcoran acknowledged. 
"But the majority of dance audiences aren't so much a crossover any more. In 
earlier days, we all drew from the same audience." 
</P>
<P>
If you have to make a choice, Kodo and Ballet Hispanico are about as diverse in 
style and content as any two performing groups can be. Kodo's calling card is a 
fusion of highly physical, ritualistic drumming and strong, stylized movement, 
while the classically trained Hispanico dancers perform modern dance with the 
accent split between their Latin origins and their strong American roots. 
</P>
<P>
This weekend's competition hasn't hurt Kodo. Although the San Diego Foundation 
for the Performing Arts began promoting the concert right on the heels of its 
decision to scrap two series events, Kodo has turned out to be the foundation's 
biggest seller. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, at least $37,500 in underwriting for a fund-raising event in 
conjunction with the opening-night performance has already been funneled into 
the organization, and the foundation is expecting a repeat of last year's 
sellout. 
</P>
<P>
"They were a big hit at the Olympics, and they're better known than most of the 
companies we've been bringing in," said Danah Fayman of the foundation, "so we 
knew they'd do well." 
</P>
<P>
UC San Diego's University Events, sponsors of Ballet Hispanico of New York, 
knew the company was an unknown quantity here. But the University is bullish on 
the troupe because "it's a contemporary company that hasn't lost its heritage," 
events director Lynn Peterson said. "They're not a folklorico troupe, yet 
there's a definite theme of Latin dance." 
</P>
<P>
The 8 p.m. concert at Mandeville Auditorium Saturday is "stylish and 
contemporary, but not avant-garde," Peterson said, and, with its eclectic 
orientation, "it should dispel some stereotypes, at least as it applies to the 
Latin dancer." 
</P>
<P>
California Ballet's "Stars of the Russian Ballet" concert follows as more than 
a footnote to this weekend's dance marathon. The single performance at the 
Civic Theatre on Feb. 21 will introduce four Russian soloists -- one pair from 
the Bolshoi Ballet and one from the Kirov -- in a program that is split down 
the middle. Home-grown dancers will open with samples of old and new repertory, 
and the Russians will dominate the finale, doing what they do best. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll dance classic pas de deux on their half of the program," director 
Maxine Mahon said, "and John Clifford (director of the Los Angeles Ballet) is 
choreographing a piece for the four of them." 
</P>

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: SAN DIEGO ENTERTAINMENT BRIEFS

At a press conference held Wednesday to announce what they would like to 
announce, officials from the Old Globe Theatre, the Leningrad Maly Dramatic 
Theatre and the San Diego Soviet Arts Festival office said they hope to stage 
the Maly's production of "Brothers and Sisters" as part of the Soviet Arts 
Festival in October. First, however, they need to get the event approved by 
Soviet authorities and find the money to cover the budget. "Brothers and 
Sisters," a seven-hour adaptation of Soviet novelist Fyodor Abramov's World War 
II trilogy, was to have had its American premiere as part of the New York 
International Festival of the Arts last summer, but was canceled when the 
producer failed to come up with the $450,000 needed to mount the production. 
Old Globe managing director Tom Hall shrugged off the expense, saying the price 
is comparable to that of producing Steven Sondheim's "Into the Woods" two years 
ago. The $6-million Soviet Arts Festival budget announced last fall showed 
$250,000 set aside for a theater performance. Details about numbers of 
performances, as well as the final budget, are still being worked out.

Despite objections of some longtime residents, the Carmel City Council voted 
unanimously Tuesday to allow director Henry Winkler to film a Disney movie 
starring Tom Hanks in their picturesque costal village in April. A vocal group 
of citizens had made it known that they were fed up with fame, overdosed on 
tourists after the days of Mayor Clint Eastwood and longed for a more low-key 
community atmosphere. The film, "Turner and Hooch," an action comedy, teams 
Hanks with Mare Winningham and a big dog named Beasley. ALEENE MacMINN

HOSPITAL PROVIDES JOB AND A PLACE TO LIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
For Helena Kness, the future seemed clear. The single mother and recent nursing 
school graduate couldn't find affordable housing in Ventura County in July, so 
she packed her bags for Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
That's when Community Memorial Hospital stepped in. Like most health care 
institutions in the region, the hospital has trouble finding registered nurses. 
</P>
<P>
But thanks to an innovative housing program launched last year, Kness moved 
into an affordable apartment owned by the hospital, and Community Memorial 
gained a nurse. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a great idea," Kness said of the two-bedroom apartment she rents 
for $550 a month from the hospital -- at least $150 below the market rate. 
</P>
<P>
"They gave me an advance for the first month's rent and, basically, I just 
moved in and paid it back over three months. I would have left town otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
Kness is among the first to benefit from the hospital's purchase of several 
homes and a four-unit apartment building, all within several blocks of the 
hospital. The units are available to employees with hard-to-find skills at up 
to $200 below the market rate. And the hospital doesn't charge first month's 
rent or a security deposit. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Don Carlton Realtors, a Ventura firm that manages about 230 
apartments, charges between $650 and $850 for two-bedroom units and requires 
first month's rent and a security deposit, according to property manager 
Cordaine Engols. 
</P>
<P>
For many, such incentives as the rental subsidy offered by Community Memorial 
can make the difference between leaving town and staying put. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Ameliorating Impact' 
</P>
<P>
"One of the issues I've read continually about is the high cost of housing. 
This is a nice way of ameliorating that impact," said Dr. Michael D. Bakst, 
executive director of the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital is among a handful of Ventura County firms pioneering creative 
ways to help recruit and retain employees as housing costs spiral upward. 
</P>
<P>
At Community Memorial, employees can stay in the hospital-owned housing for up 
to one year while they save money to move into their own apartments or buy 
homes. The hospital, which is in the market for another four-unit complex, has 
hired a property manager for the units. 
</P>
<P>
"It's worked out well," Bakst said. Kness echoed that sentiment when asked what 
she thinks about the housing assistance program. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a nice little place in a real nice neighborhood two blocks from the 
hospital," she said. "And $550 is an excellent price." DENISE HAMILTON

VENTURA ACTIONS AIM AT SCARING PESKY SEA GULLS INTO TAKING FLIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MEG SULLIVAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the Bailard Landfill, the sea gulls' lot is not a happy one. 
</P>
<P>
Labyrinths of wires wait to ensnare them, cracker shells snap menacingly, and 
loudspeakers blast electronic sea gull distress signals and sounds that are the 
sea gulls' equivalent of chalk scratching across a blackboard. 
</P>
<P>
The high-frequency noises, explains Wayne Bruce, general manager of the Ventura 
Sanitation District, which operates the landfill in northwest Oxnard, "disrupts 
their communication signals and irritates their nerves." 
</P>
<P>
If this all sounds like a scene from a horror movie, it's supposed to. 
Sanitation officials hope their efforts will frighten the flock of fine 
feathered friends away from eating at the landfill and loafing afterward at a 
swanky new subdivision, where their behavior has been anything but congenial. 
</P>
<P>
Since construction began in March on the Island Villas development, the brazen 
birds have claimed the red-tile roofs of the Mediterranean-style luxury homes, 
priced from $200,000 to $350,000. The gulls quickly turned the roofs white with 
excrement and littered lawns with unsavory debris. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unsavory Debris 
</P>
<P>
"We go out and rake feathers and bones instead of leaves," explained former 
City Councilman Michael A. Plisky, who moved into the subdivision with his 
wife, Mabi, in December. The Pliskys said a sea gull even dropped a dead rat in 
their back yard. 
</P>
<P>
The Pliskys' neighbor, Pauline Racicot, was no less disgusted by the bird, 
which is featured prominently in the city's logo. She complains that sea gulls 
ruined a recent party she and her husband, Oras, had for 23 relatives visiting 
Oxnard from Canada. 
</P>
<P>
"They'd be out on the patio for a smoke, and they'd have to rush inside to 
avoid being bombarded," she sighs. 
</P>
<P>
The plight of Island Villas has also drawn sympathy from such Oxnard City 
Council members as Ann Johs, who takes regular walks through the nearby River 
Ridge golf course with her husband, Tony. 
</P>
<P>
"I know what they've been putting up with," Johs said at the council's Tuesday 
meeting, as she put on a brown baseball hat that appeared to have been 
splattered by bird droppings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Roofs Steam Cleaned 
</P>
<P>
The developer, Strathmore Oxnard Co., has responded by steam cleaning some of 
the roofs sullied by the sea gulls, and it plans to clean more of them. 
Residents of the community, where only 25 of an eventual 92 homes are occupied, 
had at one time wanted the city to hire a consultant to deal with the problem, 
but say they are now willing to wait and see if the situation improves. 
</P>
<P>
But sanitation officials said this week that additional steps may not be 
necessary. They believe that they licked the problem when they closed down the 
Coastal Landfill last week and began dumping the county's trash at the Bailard 
Landfill. 
</P>
<P>
Although most -- 2,500 to be exact -- of the scavenger birds have found their 
way to the new landfill, which is less than three-quarters of a mile across 
Victoria Avenue from the old one, only a few have found their way from Bailard 
to Island Villas. The subdivision is about a mile from the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, sanitation officials found no birds on the houses and counted only 
12 birds on ponds at River Ridge, said Kelly White, the sanitation district's 
environmental manager. 
</P>
<P>
But the officials also acknowledge that the stormy weather of the past week -- 
not the long-scheduled landfill switch -- may have thwarted the birds' return. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been pretty cold, wet and rainy," White said. "The birds don't like to 
be out in this type of weather." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the reason the birds crossed the street, sanitation officials hope to 
discourage them from landing there, by means of a whole array of "bird 
abatement" contraptions -- from the bird wires to electronic distress signals 
to firing blank cartridges. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to confuse the birds and keep them out of the food source," Kelly 
said. "That will reduce the number of birds in the whole area." 
</P>
<P>
In all, the sanitation district expects to spend $30,000 on the project this 
year, Bruce said. Indeed, the district plans to do everything but the obvious. 
"You'd have to kill thousands to be effective, but we're not considering any 
destructive efforts," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Possible New Steps 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't mean that the sanitation district is ruling out construction. 
White said district officials plan to dig a pond in the dry bed of the Santa 
Clara River if the other steps don't work. 
</P>
<P>
"There tends to be less of a problem when there's water in the river," she 
explained. "They like to lounge around water." 
</P>
<P>
In the past, however, the birds have not proven so gullible. 
</P>
<P>
They grew indifferent to such abatement devises as balloons designed to disrupt 
their flight patterns and kites designed to resemble hawks, their natural 
predators. Cannons installed several years ago at the Coastal Landfill at first 
frightened the birds. But eventually, "the cannon would go off, and they'd lift 
up a little bit, but right away they'd be back on it," White said. 
</P>
<P>
The sanitation district even hired the bird trainer who choreographed the 
critters in Alfred Hitchcock's movie "The Birds," Bruce said. The trainer was 
supposed to lure away the birds with a trained, female sea gull, and he did. 
But the trained bird never returned, whereas the rest of the sea gulls weren't 
so easily lost. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Very Clever' 
</P>
<P>
"They're very clever," White said. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the district admitted defeat. They stopped fighting the sea 
gulls when they realized that they were getting more complaints about the 
exploding shells than about the sea gulls. 
</P>
<P>
The birds continued to frequent the neighborhood's golf course. But the sea 
gulls' affection for the area may predate the golf course, which was built on a 
landfill in 1986. Residents say the area is an established "loafing" ground for 
the birds. Whatever the attraction, the Island Villas homes did nothing to 
discourage them. 
</P>
<P>
"The birds really like the houses," White explains. "The roofs are just made 
for their flat feet, and being so high up they can see predators." 
</P>
<P>
The birds would visit the neighborhood after eating at the landfill "to loaf, 
bask in the sun and socialize," Bruce said. Later, they would return to the 
Channel Islands, where they roost. 
</P>
<P>
Sanitation officials have counted up to 300 sea gulls at each of the golf 
course's two ponds -- at holes 14 and 18 -- and tallied an additional 600 to 
800 birds on the rooftops of the houses near hole 18 of the green, White said. 
</P>
<P>
Although River Ridge golfers had long complained about the sea gulls, the 
problem didn't get attention until the subdivision's residents, led by Don 
Lewis, began petitioning the Oxnard City Council for help. 
</P>
<P>
A former public information officer for the Navy, Lewis and his wife, Nadine, 
have printed business cards that describe them as the development's "first 
official residents" and their Bermuda Dunes Place address as "Bird Do-Lane." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis says he remains optimistic in the face of some distressing developments. 
On Monday, Lewis said, he and his dog, Nilla, chased 100 birds from the golf 
course ponds. By Tuesday, the number had grown to 250. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know whether that was a sporadic appearance or whether their numbers 
are growing," he said.

POMONA TO ASK SHERIFF FOR GANG PATROL AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

POMONA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city's growing gang problem, graphically illustrated by a deadly weekend of 
violence last month, is more than Pomona police can handle alone. 
</P>
<P>
That was the consensus of residents and City Council members this week as the 
council voted 4 to 1 in favor of contracting with Los Angeles County to have 
sheriffs' deputies help patrol Pomona's streets. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman C. L. (Clay) Bryant, who proposed that the city request help from 
the Sheriff's Department, said the need for such assistance was demonstrated by 
the events of Jan. 22-23. Two people were killed, five injured and a police 
officer fired upon in a series of drive-by shootings. 
</P>
<P>
"Pomona is rapidly becoming a haven for undesirables and a weekend shooting 
gallery," Bryant said. "It is obvious that our Police Department is not 
equipped to provide the protection and enforcement which the present situation 
demands." 
</P>
<P>
Bryant's proposal was supported by residents who spoke on the matter at Monday 
night's council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Clean Up the Scum' 
</P>
<P>
"Our Police Department is not cutting it," resident Leslie Carpenter said. "We 
need the Sheriff's Department in here to clean up the scum and make Pomona safe 
again." 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Richard Tefank argued against the move, noting that the department 
had bolstered its anti-gang efforts by having some officers work 10 hours of 
overtime a week. 
</P>
<P>
Since Jan. 23, police on this specialized gang duty have arrested 36 gang 
members in intensive sweeps and seized five guns and four Molotov cocktails, 
Tefank said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our officers know the community," Tefank said. "They know the individuals 
involved. . . . Through the use of overtime and redeployment of officers, we 
could respond in a much more timely and efficient manner." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of bringing in the Sheriff's Department, Tefank suggested that the 
council appropriate $83,400 to continue the police overtime program for another 
month and repaint Pomona police cars from their current white to a more visible 
black and white. 
</P>
<P>
The council, however, chose both alternatives. Council members voted to give 
Tefank the money he requested and authorized City Administrator A. J. Wilson to 
seek assistance from the Sheriff's Department. If sheriff's officials and the 
county Board of Supervisors approve the request, deputies could be on patrol in 
Pomona in 30 to 90 days, Tefank said. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Cmdr. John Hammargren said Wednesday that he had yet to receive an 
official request for assistance from the city but that he planned to meet with 
Tefank to discuss Pomona's needs and the county's ability to help. 
</P>
<P>
"Within our resources, we'll give them any help we can," Hammargren said. 
"Pomona has a fine Police Department, so we're not sure what we can do for them 
that they couldn't do for themselves. . . . They have gang problems and so do 
we, and we don't see any massive set of solutions or we all could avail 
ourselves (of) them." 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department patrols unincorporated areas of the county and 
incorporated cities that don't have police departments. Only rarely does the 
department send deputies into cities to help out local police, Hammargren said. 
"It's not common, but it's not unprecedented," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Police Overtime 
</P>
<P>
Tefank said it would be cheaper and more timely to rely entirely on Pomona 
police officers working overtime. By having officers work 50 hours a week 
instead of 40, the department increases its presence on the street by 30% 
during peak hours for gang activity, Tefank said. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of paying a police sergeant and eight officers to work an extra day on 
overtime is $2,250, Tefank said. Although the county will not quote prices for 
police services, Tefank estimated that eight deputies and a sergeant would cost 
the city $2,785 a day, based on the county's contract rates for 1986-87, 
adjusted for inflation. 
</P>
<P>
"I would submit that it could be done cheaper with our officers," Tefank said. 
This statement drew a stern rebuke from Bryant, who normally prides himself on 
being a tight-fisted fiscal conservative. 
</P>
<P>
"Here we're talking about the welfare of the city, the quality of life, the 
safety of the people, and you're talking about money," Bryant said. "You can't 
put a value on safety." 
</P>
<P>
Although Pomona has dealt with violent spates of gang activity in the past, the 
growing problem of gangs in north Pomona who are affiliated with the Los 
Angeles-based Bloods and Crips has panicked some residents, Councilwoman Nell 
Soto said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
For Sale Signs Going Up 
</P>
<P>
"Right after the January incident, I went around town and the 'for sale' signs 
were going up. . . . " Soto said. "I think it's disgraceful when the gangs and 
the hoodlums have intimidated the good people of Pomona to the point where they 
want to move." 
</P>
<P>
With the March 7 primary approaching -- Mayor Donna Smith and Councilmen E. J. 
(Jay) Gaulding and Bryant are seeking reelection -- the discussion of gang 
violence was often acrimonious and sometimes partisan. In a long and 
occasionally emotional debate, Smith argued heatedly with Bryant and was 
reprimanded by Debbie Keane, wife of mayoral candidate Jerry Keane, for failing 
to deal with the gang problem. 
</P>
<P>
Smith responded that Pomona needs more officers of its own instead of sheriff's 
deputies who would not be under local control. "They do things first and ask 
questions later," Smith said of the Sheriff's Department. "If that's the way 
you want it, fine, but I don't think that's what we want for the community." 
</P>
<P>
The mayor also chided her council colleagues for failing to support her earlier 
calls to hire more officers. The Pomona Police Department has 152 sworn 
officers, only eight more than a decade ago, when the city had 34,000 fewer 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
"The department is short 30 officers," Smith said. "We've got to make a 
commitment to hiring more officers. . . . I remember several council meetings 
where I begged the council to bite the bullet and find the money to fund more 
officers. I was outvoted." 
</P>
<P>
Resident Sandra Alsop said Pomona residents have lost confidence in their 
police. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time we ask the Police Department for help, all we get is excuses why 
they can't come out," Alsop said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the council's actions will put more officers on the street to fight 
gang violence, officials said community members must take action on their own 
to combat the gang problem. 
</P>
<P>
Gaulding told those at the meeting that he had angrily confronted gang members 
who congregated in his neighborhood. Although they threatened him, Gaulding 
said, the gangs eventually moved on. 
</P>
<P>
"I know it's a high-risk thing," Gaulding said. "My wife was screaming bloody 
murder (urging him not to do it). But I made a decision (that) I was not going 
to let somebody run me out of my house." 
</P>
<P>
Soto said she plans to form a citizens group, patterned after Mothers Against 
Drunk Driving, called Mothers Against Gangs. The group would mount a vigorous 
publicity campaign, using billboards and other means to let gang members know 
that they are not welcome, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think if the mothers get mad enough, we're going to chase them out of town," 
Soto said. 
</P>
<P>
"We need the community to get angry," Tefank said, "angry with the people who 
are causing this (problem), not the police."

NEWSPRINT GLUT WIPES OUT NONPROFIT GROUPS' FUNDS FROM RECYCLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESSE KATZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than a dozen nonprofit groups in Ventura and Oxnard that recycle old 
newspapers for extra cash have found that their efforts no longer pay off. 
</P>
<P>
A nationwide glut in the newsprint market that industry experts say may never 
be absorbed has almost overnight wiped away any profit to be made from 
collecting old papers. 
</P>
<P>
Local groups -- which include half a dozen elementary schools, churches, a 
temple and two Boys &amp; Girls clubs -- began the recycling projects at 
various times over the last several years as a way of padding their perennially 
pinched coffers. 
</P>
<P>
But, by December, the collection bins that had been placed on their grounds by 
recycling companies were overflowing with uncollected papers, and many of the 
groups contend that they are owed hundreds of dollars for past pick-ups. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Did 'Nice Things' 
</P>
<P>
"It was really too bad," said Helen Alfredson, a fifth-grade teacher at 
Montalvo Elementary School. "It's not any huge amount of money, but it did do 
nice little things for our school." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the complaints have been directed toward the Community Recycling 
Center, a Sylmar-based firm, which supplied bins for at least seven of the 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Alessi, who was acting as the company's spokesman Tuesday, denied that any 
money was owed. He said Community Recycling had announced in October that, 
because of the plummeting price for recycled newsprint, the company could no 
longer pay the groups the $40 or so a ton they were accustomed to receiving. 
</P>
<P>
"We told them, 'If you want to get paid for it -- impossible,' " Alessi said. 
"Newspaper has no value now. But they can't comprehend, because they're not in 
the business. They just see that they're not getting paid what they used to be 
getting, so they think the company is cheating them." 
</P>
<P>
At least four complaints against Community Recycling have been lodged with the 
Ventura County district attorney's office, which has referred the case to its 
Consumer Mediation Unit. Melodianne Duffy, supervisor of the unit, said she was 
awaiting a response from the company before launching an investigation to 
determine whether any criminal violation had occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Increased recycling, particularly because of a recent wave of mandatory 
programs around the country, is blamed by industry experts for the glut in the 
paper market. Increased supply without increased demand, according to economic 
axiom, usually results in a price drop. And the price has indeed dropped. 
</P>

Early last year, a ton of old newspapers could fetch as much as $100 from a 
recycling company in California. By last summer and through the fall, it 
hovered between $50 and $40 a ton. Then, between December and January, the 
bottom fell out, and today, many companies are simply refusing to pay a cent. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the beginning of the end for anybody who wants to make money recycling 
newspapers," said Bob Fagan, president of Sun Valley Paper Stock Inc. and one 
of the directors of the Recycling Coalition of California. "The supply and 
demand cycle has been disrupted forever more." 
</P>
<P>
According to the American Paper Institute in New York, 13 million tons of 
newspaper was printed in the United States last year. Of that, 4.5 million tons 
were collected for recycling. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Higher Demand 
</P>
<P>
Although demand for used paper is expected to increase this year by another 
300,000 tons, municipalities desperately trying to conserve dwindling landfill 
space are initiating mandatory recycling programs at an even faster rate, said 
J. Rodney Edwards, vice president of the institute's Paperboard Group. 
</P>
<P>
"We are in a period of transformation where it would appear that municipal 
collection programs are tending to replace charitable group paper programs," 
Rodney said. "I don't know how long this is going to continue, . . . but I 
think it will be difficult for charitable groups to compete." 
</P>
<P>
That means several hundred dollars a year less each for some Ventura elementary 
schools, including Pointsettia, Loma Vista, Montalvo, Mound and Pierpont. It 
also means the loss of a little extra cash for Ventura's College United 
Methodist Church, Temple Beth Torah, the Boys &amp; Girls Club of Ventura and 
the Boys &amp; Girls Club of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
"I really feel badly about it," said Jane Goldschmidt, executive director of 
the Ventura Boys &amp; Girls Club. "But we'll just have to readjust our budget 
and try to think up new and exciting ways to make up that lost income."

BONELLI PARK RULING LAUDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your headline, "Bonelli Park Development Suffers Setback," (Jan. 29), should 
have read, "Local Communities Save Bonelli Park From Commercial 
Overdevelopment," or something similar. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Miriam Vogel's ruling was the right one but 
may yet be only a temporary halt to the county's determination to make its 
parks self-supporting -- like Disneyland. In the 1970s, the entire western 
section of the park was leased indefinitely to a private concessionaire for a 
commercial recreation venture. Regardless of how people may feel about the 
appropriateness of Raging Waters, it is open to the public only three months of 
the year. Thus for nine months of every year this most beautiful section of the 
park is locked off and inaccessible. Do we want more of this?

CABLE AGREEMENT REACHED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cable television service will be extended to the Linda Vista area starting this 
summer, under a new agreement between the city and its cable franchise holder, 
Choice Television. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor William E. Thomson Jr. announced that attorneys for the city and Choice 
Television have resolved a dispute over the cable company's obligations under 
the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
Under the compromise agreement, which is scheduled for a public hearing 
Tuesday, Choice Television will install cable service to 61% of the nearly 
1,300 homes in the Linda Vista area by September, 1990, and the remainder by 
1992. The city will relieve Choice of the obligation of contributing 2% of its 
gross revenue to public access programming unless the number of subscribers 
increases substantially. 
</P>
<P>
Choice owes $285,000 for public access support and has agreed to meet that 
obligation by paying $4,200 a month for six years.

SCHOOL GETS AID FOR REPAIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Monrovia High School will no longer have to cram students into the gymnasium 
for assemblies, thanks to state aid that will be used to repair an auditorium 
damaged in an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,500-seat auditorium has been closed since the 1987 Whittier earthquake 
dislodged segments of the ceiling. Building inspectors initially said the 
damage was not caused by the earthquake, but a re-evaluation ordered by the 
district has qualified the school for the $417,000 in financial aid, the state 
Department of Finance announced last month. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a real godsend," said Principal Jack Clement, adding that pep rallies the 
school has been holding in the football stadium "are just not as exciting." 
Drama students have had to travel to Clifton Middle School to use its 
auditorium for rehearsals, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The funds, to be received in March, will cover 80% of the repair costs for the 
ceiling, including removal of asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
The Monrovia Unified School District has applied for $100,000 in federal 
earthquake aid for the rest of the expenses, school board President Christine 
Goudy said.

WOMAN TRIES TO GET BACK CONDO LOST IN MAINTENANCE FEE DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the cold nights when she has to sleep in the front seat of her Datsun 280Z, 
Alyce Vrba often thinks about the dues she's paid, and the dues she hasn't, and 
the luxury condominium that brought her to such a state. 
</P>
<P>
She was evicted for failing to pay $1,900 in monthly maintenance fees. 
</P>
<P>
The 42-year-old businesswoman lived for 10 years at Ridgegate, a guarded 
complex of 350 units, four pools and two tennis courts that sprawls across 35 
acres in Rancho Palos Verdes near the summit of the Palos Verdes Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
From the time she arrived in 1978, Vrba said, she used her training as an 
interior designer to make over her home: A walk-in closet became an Art Deco 
bar. An entire bedroom wall was painted with a Rousseau jungle scene. Five 
Burmese cats added warmth. 
</P>
<P>
"It was my own little fortress, in a way," Vrba said. "There was a feeling of 
security." 
</P>
<P>
That was before Vrba stopped paying her maintenance dues to the Ridgegate 
Homeowners Assn. Vrba said that in 1987, she began withholding fees of about 
$165 a month because, she said, the maintenance firm hired by the association 
wasn't caring for common areas near her unit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Condominium Sold 
</P>
<P>
A year and a half later, she has been evicted. Her home, which is worth about 
$300,000, has been sold by the Ridgegate Homeowners Assn. to pay $1,900 in 
maintenance fees that the association said she owed. 
</P>
<P>
Vrba's lawyer, Francis Pizzulli, said foreclosure was an extreme remedy for a 
$1,900 bill. "It's amazing," Pizzulli said. "You hear these stories about 
homeless people, and you think it's drugs or alcohol. But something like this 
is kind of shocking." 
</P>
<P>
Vrba, who said she has been living with friends and sometimes in her car, has 
filed two lawsuits seeking to recover her property. Both are pending in Los 
Angeles Superior Court, although several preliminary rulings have gone against 
Vrba. Last week, Superior Court Judge David Yaffe removed legal attachments 
that had prevented the buyer of her condominium from selling it. 
</P>
<P>
Vrba's complaints center on what she said was the homeowner association's 
failure to warn her that she could lose her home. A day before her condo was 
sold, Vrba's lawsuits claim, she was assured that the sale would be postponed 
to let her pay the overdue balance. If she had been properly warned, Vrba said, 
she never would have let her maintenance fees lapse. 
</P>
<P>
But a lawyer for the new owner of the unit said all residents at Ridgegate, and 
most other condominiums in California, should realize that they lose their 
homes if they do not pay their dues. Vrba received several notices that she had 
to pay, according to affidavits signed by the new owners of her unit. 
Condominium associations have few other options to get members to comply with 
the rules, said Jerry Rappaport, a lawyer for the buyers of the condominium. 
</P>
<P>
Vrba said she and her husband discovered Ridgegate in 1978. He was a 
transportation planner, and she was an interior designer. The couple had lived 
in Los Feliz and moved to Ridgegate with the expectation of eventually owning a 
house on the peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
Then she suffered two serious car accidents, Vrba said, which put a strain on 
the marriage. It ended in divorce in 1983. Vrba said she received the 
condominium in a settlement with her husband. 
</P>
<P>
"The house was very important to me," she said recently. "It was the only thing 
that remained stable through all that." 
</P>
<P>
She said she gave up her work as a designer and began her own business 
consulting firm, advising other companies how to reorganize. Despite having a 
master's degree in business administration from USC, Vrba said, she sometimes 
found it hard to find enough clients. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Maintenance Dispute 
</P>
<P>
Still, she said, she paid her bills until a dispute with the Ridgegate 
Homeowners Assn. over maintenance around her unit. Vrba said gardening went 
unfinished, a door was not varnished and the roof leaked. By July, 1987, Vrba 
said, she was fed up and began withholding her fees, which are used by the 
condominium association to keep up common areas. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Bali Management declined to comment on the maintenance 
question or the foreclosure, and the company's lawyer, who also represents the 
association, did not return repeated phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
To collect overdue fees, Bali Management Inc. of Torrance, the property 
manager, placed a lien on Vrba's condominium. 
</P>
<P>
All owners at Ridgegate, and many other condominium complexes, sign contracts 
that permit foreclosure on their property if they fail to pay dues. State law 
permits that these foreclosures, unlike most, may be conducted outside the 
supervision of a court. In such nonjudicial foreclosures, owners do not have 
one important right that they have in other foreclosures: the right to pay the 
sales price themselves to buy back their properties. 
</P>
<P>
In August, 1987, Condominium Trustee Service of Hermosa Beach notified the 
county that the firm had been authorized to sell the property to collect on 
Vrba's overdue account. Milton Katz, president of the business, said this week 
that Vrba also received a notice by certified mail. He said the firm has proof 
that the letter was delivered, but Vrba denies signing any receipt. 
</P>
<P>
The letter is one of several that the homeowners association, management 
company and Katz said they sent to Vrba. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Notice on Door 
</P>
<P>
She said she received no warning and knew nothing of a foreclosure until last 
March 9, when she returned home to find a notice tacked to her door: A 
trustee's auction of her condominium would be held March 31. 
</P>
<P>
She recalled: "I looked at it and I said, 'This is unbelievable.' " 
</P>
<P>
Vrba said she made repeated phone calls to Bali Management and Katz in an 
attempt to stop the sale. On March 30, Vrba said, Katz assured her that the 
sale would be postponed and that she would have time to work out her 
differences with the homeowners association. 
</P>
<P>
The property was auctioned the next day. Real estate investors Peter Baer and 
I. W. Abramson bought the property for $13,200 and assumed the mortgage, which 
has a balance of about $140,000. 
</P>
<P>
Katz denied that he spoke to Vrba on March 30 or any other time. 
</P>
<P>
In a declaration filed with one of her lawsuits, Vrba claims that the sale was 
fraudulent because it brought a price so far below the unit's market value of 
$280,000. 
</P>
<P>
The new owners have said it is unfair to judge the sale solely on the auction 
price. Abramson said in a sworn statement that the partners had to make $32,000 
in overdue payments. 
</P>
<P>
Another $9,000 in past property taxes must still be paid, as well as about 
$140,000 still owed on the mortgage, said Abramson and his lawyer, Rappaport. 
</P>
<P>
Vrba said she was not late on her mortgage payments and that the buyers had 
grossly overstated their investment. 
</P>
<P>
Despite her legal challenges, a South Bay Municipal Court judge agreed to a 
request to evict Vrba from her condominium.

LAST CALL TO DEFEAT DOS PUEBLOS WRESTLERS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Barbara school system might accomplish what Channel League wrestling 
teams have been trying to do to Dos Pueblos High for more than a decade: Pin it 
with a loss. 
</P>
<P>
Dos Pueblos, the league's smallest school with about 1,200 students, extended 
its league dual-meet winning streak to 75 matches by completing another 
undefeated season. The Chargers have won 13 consecutive league titles, 12 
outright, under Coach Mike Hart. 
</P>
<P>
Yet while the school has overcome its low enrollment admirably in competition, 
the lack of students may force Dos Pueblos to close next year and send its 
students to San Marcos High. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers, indeed, could have the mat pulled out from under them. The league 
tournament Saturday at Santa Barbara High could be the last time the Chargers 
roll out that not-so-welcome mat and take down the rest of the league. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Rio Mesa and Ventura -- the strongest of the Channel League 
challengers -- are vying for a reversal of recent fortunes. Both believe they 
can give Dos Pueblos a going-away pin. 
</P>
<P>
All wrestling leagues in the Southern Section cap two months of dual meets with 
league tournaments, during which all teams gather under one roof for a dual 
purpose. Individuals qualify for the Southern Section meet based on their 
finish in the league tournament and the league team title is at stake because 
dual-meet and league-tournament standings count equally. 
</P>
<P>
In the Channel League that means a chance -- perhaps the last chance -- to 
defeat Dos Pueblos, the team that has had all the right moves for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
"It's gonna be competitive," Rio Mesa Coach Todd Stoke said of the league 
tournament. "Going in, I'd have to say Dos Pueblos is the favorite. But we've 
got a shot and Ventura has a shot." 
</P>
<P>
Dos Pueblos has a 7-0 league record, Rio Mesa (6-1) is second and Ventura (5-2) 
is third. Dos Pueblos is ranked fourth in the 3-A Division and Rio Mesa is 
fifth. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura, however, came within a point in the last weight class of tying Dos 
Pueblos in a dual meet. Rio Mesa lost to Dos Pueblos, 34-25, but defeated 
Ventura, 35-27. Those scores are not altogether predictive of success in the 
league tournament, however. 
</P>
<P>
"In the league meet there are more variables than in a dual meet," Stoke said. 
"The contrasting styles of wrestlers comes into play. And some guys wrestle at 
a lower weight in the league meet than they did during the season." 
</P>
<P>
Said Ventura Coach Paul Clementi: "D.P. has dominated so much in the past, but 
this year will be more balanced. We need help from other schools. At this point 
in the year -- it's been a long season -- a lot depends on how hungry your 
wrestlers are." 
</P>
<P>
Certain weight classes -- the ones that were most competitive in dual meets -- 
will be key in the league tournament. Success at the 145 and 177 weights are 
crucial to Rio Mesa's upset hopes. 
</P>
<P>
Wyatt Anderson of Rio Mesa and Steve Dick of Dos Pueblos split two close 
matches this season at 145 pounds. And every league wrestler at 177 has been 
defeated. 
</P>
<P>
"For us to win league, Anderson has to win at 145," Stoke said. "And first 
through fifth place is up for grabs at 177." 
</P>
<P>
Dos Pueblos' top wrestlers are Tyler Stetler (heavyweight) and David Ellis 
(154). Stetler is unbeaten but only defeated Ventura's David Mitchell by a 
point. Ellis, a senior, is the defending league champion and was runner-up in 
the 3-A last season. Brian Gunsolley (165) is unbeaten in dual meets. 
</P>
<P>
Rio Mesa's standout is 132-pound senior Robby Cook, who is undefeated in league 
meets and 35-1 overall. Cook is a four-year letterman, returning league 
champion and was named the league's outstanding wrestler in the lower weight 
divisions last year. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Flores (191) is another four-year letterman for the Spartans and he has 
improved each year, finishing fourth in league as a freshman, third as a 
sophomore and second as a junior. Flores is unbeaten in league matches this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
D.J. McCown (126), Ventura's best wrestler, had the flu and missed the Cougars' 
close dual-meet loss to Dos Pueblos. McCown is unbeaten in league matches. 
Ventura sophomore David Atherton (98) is also unbeaten in league meets. Junior 
Brian Adams (177) pinned his opponents from Dos Pueblos and Buena. 
</P>
<P>
Other top wrestlers in the league tournament include Oxnard's Noel Juarez, who 
may drop from 112 to 105 pounds for the tournament, and Hueneme's Delphino 
Ochoa (119), a two-time league champion. 
</P>
<P>
Juarez is unbeaten in league meets and has only one loss overall. Ochoa is 
trying to become only the eighth wrestler to become a three-time Channel League 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
And as for beating Dos Pueblos? "It's not going to take a miracle," Stoke said, 
"just an excellent performance." 
</P>
<P>
MARMONTE LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
Balance has characterized the Marmonte in dual meets. Westlake, Simi Valley, 
Camarillo, Channel Islands and Newbury Park field representative teams. Only 
Royal and Thousand Oaks have consistently struggled. 
</P>
<P>
"Westlake has the best chance," Newbury Park Coach Marty Maciel said. "They 
have a real good tournament team." 
</P>
<P>
Billy Hunter (175) and Neil Mason (145) are the Warriors' top wrestlers, but 
Darrell Valance (165), Farzin Daneshnia (112), Brad Miya (119), Shawn Valance 
(138) and Dave Schumm (191) also could take league titles. 
</P>
<P>
Channel Islands boasts the best group of lightweight wrestlers. T.R. Merickel 
(98) is favored -- unless teammate Valo Barajas drops from 105 to challenge 
him. At 112, Chris Corpuz of Channel Islands may drop from 119 and challenge 
Westlake's Daneshnia. Channel Islands also has favorites in M.T. Merickel (132) 
and Chris Whitmore (191). 
</P>
<P>
Newbury Park boasts excellent wrestlers in Chris Kilbane (154) and Kevin Mabry 
(105). Kilbane was the league and 4-A champion at 145 pounds last year and is 
34-0 this season. Mabry was third in the 4-A last season. Panther heavyweight 
Jeff Jay, a junior, is also a defending league champion. 
</P>
<P>
Although Bryon Ha (138) is Simi Valley's only favorite, the Pioneers have 
several wrestlers capable of pulling off upsets, including Robin Song (105), 
William Cardinos (126) and Charlie Verhoven (154). 
</P>
<P>
Jim James (119) and Zak Achen (165) are among Camarillo's top wrestlers. Sean 
Toner of Thousand Oaks could top Darrell Valance or Achen at 165. 
</P>
<P>
"When coaches are talking to their teams this time of year," Maciel said, 
"there is still one motivating factor. They tell the kids they have the league 
tournament to shoot for." 
</P>
<P>
FRONTIER LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
Fillmore, under second-year Coach Bobby Calderon, has rebounded from a winless 
league season last year to a first-place finish in the dual-meet standings. 
Moorpark and Santa Paula are also strong. Agoura, Santa Ynez and Calabasas 
round out the league. 
</P>
<P>
"The teams are closely matched for the league tournament," Calderon said. 
</P>
<P>
Calderon, an undefeated state champion at 115 pounds for Oxnard High in 1964, 
has put together a solid program. Fillmore took up wrestling only two years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Fillmore's Jaime Valdez (Heavyweight) and Moorpark's Gau Diaz (105) are the 
league's top wrestlers. Valdez is 17-1 overall and Diaz was 1-A champion at 98 
pounds two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Also favored in the league tournament are Fillmore's Jeremy Hernandez (112), 
Moorpark's Paul Gutierrez (126) and three middleweight Santa Paula wrestlers -- 
Jerry Hernandez (145), Chris Mendez (154) and James Ary (165).

A telephone call from Gabe Diaz was all it took to get Gary Anglin excited 
about his Ventura College baseball team's chances of winning its first Western 
State Conference title in 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
Diaz, a hard-hitting shortstop from Hueneme High, called Anglin last summer to 
tell the veteran coach that he would play for the Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him he made my day," Anglin said. "As a position player, he was our top 
recruit. Gabe is an intense player who does not like to lose and has strong 
leadership qualities." 
</P>
<P>
Anglin had good reason to be excited. Diaz (5-foot-6, 155 pounds) batted .448, 
scored 31 runs, had nine doubles, four triples, 24 runs batted in and stole 13 
bases last season. In addition, the three-time All-Channel League infielder did 
not strike out in 96 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
Anglin said Diaz chose Ventura because he wanted to stay near his Oxnard home 
this season. No matter the reason, Anglin is glad to get him. 
</P>
<P>
But Diaz is not the only impressive player recruited by Anglin, who believes he 
has put together what may be his finest team. 
</P>
<P>
Lupe Carrillo, an infielder from Oxnard High who was second in the county in 
hitting (.490) last season, and Darrell McMillin, a freshman infielder who 
batted .443 for Ventura High, will also play for the Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura bolstered its pitching staff with the addition of Derron Spiller of Rio 
Mesa High, Dean McMillin, who had an 8-4 record and 2.62 earned-run average for 
Ventura High last season, and Mike Teron, who had a 7-1 record and a 2.24 ERA 
for Santa Clara High. Spiller and McMillin are left-handed and Teron is 
right-handed. 
</P>
<P>
Shane Espitia, the Pirates' top returning pitcher, had a 5-8 record and a 4.71 
ERA as a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
Anglin lost pitcher Ed Leger, who signed with the Cleveland Indians after his 
freshman season. The All-WSC reliever was 5-1 with six saves and a 2.15 ERA 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates will need strong pitching to improve on last season's second-place 
finish in the Northern Division of the WSC. Ventura has finished second to 
Oxnard each of the last three seasons. "We really want it this year and I feel 
like our pitching is strong enough to do the job for us," Anglin said. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura set a single-season record for wins with a 24-12 overall mark last 
season. The Pirates' .316 batting average was another school record. It's the 
disappointment of continually taking a back seat to Oxnard that lingers with 
Anglin. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates finished 15-9 in WSC play and narrowly missed a playoff berth after 
losing both ends of a doubleheader to Bakersfield on the last day of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a little apprehensive about this year because we're so young, but I don't 
want to wait for next season," Anglin said. 
</P>
<P>
Brent Cookson, a sophomore outfielder, is the Pirates' top returning hitter. He 
batted .372 last season and his 37 RBIs led the team. The All-WSC second-team 
selection also had a .496 on-base average and stole 15 bases. 
</P>
<P>
Joining Cookson in the outfield will be sophomore Chris Ames, who batted .307 
and stole seven bases last year. Cookson and Ames are Ventura's only returning 
starters. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates, in fact, may field a starting lineup of seven freshmen and two 
sophomores. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard will also field a predominantly freshmen lineup in George Peraza's first 
season as coach. Jerry White, coach at Oxnard for 10 seasons, resigned last 
summer, saying it was time to "smell the roses." 
</P>
<P>
It will be a challenge for Peraza, an assistant under White at Oxnard and 
Moorpark colleges for 12 seasons, to get a sniff of the WSC title this season. 
Oxnard won five WSC division titles and made eight appearances in the 
conference playoffs under White, but recruiting is difficult for any new coach. 
</P>
<P>
"Jerry was a great motivator and an inspirational type of individual," Peraza 
said. "I will have a real test." 
</P>
<P>
White guided the Condors to a division title and a 27-15 record last season. 
College of the Canyons won the WSC title in a best-of-three series against 
Oxnard before Palomar eliminated the Condors from the Southern California 
Regional playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Peraza's first job will be to rebuild the Oxnard pitching staff, depleted by 
the loss of Vale Lopez and Don Schwarz. 
</P>
<P>
The Condors have seven pitchers, including sophomore left-hander Blake Parker 
and right-hander Allen Kuz, but Peraza is concerned about the team's depth. 
</P>
<P>
"Pitching is one of the areas that we're probably lacking," Peraza said. "We 
don't have a lot of pitchers, but hopefully we have some quality." 
</P>
<P>
The Condors have a solid outfield, headed by freshman Gil Valencia, who batted 
.378 for Camarillo High last season, and John Swanson from Rio Mesa. The 
Condors lost center fielder Phil White, who batted .369 last season. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard also lost two of its top batters from last season in catcher Tim Laker, 
a .356 hitter who signed with the Montreal Expos after his freshman season, and 
first baseman Sean Luft (.355), who transferred to UC Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Like Peraza, Coach Ron Stillwell of Moorpark College will have some rebuilding 
to do to improve on last season's 14-22 finish. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders, who will start six freshmen, have a solid infield with freshman 
Steve Sisco of Thousand Oaks High at second base and freshman shortstop Dan 
Smith of Newbury Park High. Both were All-Marmonte League players. Kris Kaelin, 
a 6-foot-5 left-handed hitter, is returning at first base. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman pitchers Jeff Berman and Rob Teasdale of Newbury Park High and Willie 
Leighton of Fillmore join sophomores Paul Perce and Todd Gerbovaz, who injured 
his knee at the start of last season, on the mound this spring.

Two former Nicaraguan army officers ended nearly 10 years of political asylum 
in the Venezuelan Embassy in Managua and were given permission to leave the 
country, Foreign Ministry officials said. Col. Carlos O. Gutierrez, 62, and 
Capt. Mario Guerra Palacios, 42, boarded a commercial flight to Guatemala. 
Ministry spokeswoman Mercedes Borge said they will eventually travel to the 
United States to live in exile. The two fled into the Venezuelan Embassy on 
July 19, 1979, the day President Anastasio Somoza was ousted in a popular 
revolt.

Saudi Arabia has readmitted former Ugandan dictator Idi Amin after he slipped 
back into Africa for three weeks, Arab diplomats in Jidda said. The burly, 
61-year-old Amin returned to Jidda, the diplomatic and financial capital of 
Saudi Arabia, about a week ago, the diplomats said. Amin fled to Libya after he 
was ousted from power in Uganda in April, 1979. When Libyan leader Moammar 
Kadafi rejected him eight months later, he was granted political asylum by 
Saudi Arabia. Amin recently left his home in suburban Jidda on a false 
passport, surfacing Jan. 3 in Zaire, where the government quickly expelled him.

The Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini has pardoned political prisoners in Iran in a 
general amnesty declared during celebrations marking the 10th anniversary of 
the Islamic Revolution, Tehran Radio announced, without specifying how many 
would be freed or when it would take effect. The state radio said Khomeini 
proclaimed the amnesty at the request of Intelligence Minister Mohammed 
Mohammedi-Reyshahri, who said in a letter to Khomeini that the political groups 
"no longer constitute a threat to the revolution." The radio said all but 900 
prisoners jailed for belonging to outlawed opposition groups will be freed 
under the amnesty.

Japan announced it will pardon 30,000 people in a general amnesty that includes 
restoration of civil rights to about 11 million people. The amnesty, intended 
as a gift to the people to commemorate the death of Emperor Hirohito, will take 
effect Feb. 24, the day of Hirohito's funeral. The amnesty was immediately 
criticized as being selective and politically motivated because it includes 
thousands of politicians and campaign workers convicted of breaking election 
laws. The measure is in line with the Japanese tradition of granting pardons to 
mark significant events in the country's history.

A witness whose identity and voice were disguised told Senate investigators 
that organized crime families control many of the largest bingo games on Indian 
reservations, in one instance bilking a reservation out of more than $500,000 a 
year. The witness admitted to managing a reservation bingo game for an 
organized crime family and said mobsters anxious to break into the "wide-open" 
Indian gambling market have done so by bribing or intimidating tribal leaders. 
Federal law enforcement officials acknowledged the existence of some ties 
between organized crime and Indian bingo but said the problem was not yet "a 
substantial and consistent threat." FBI agent Richard Elroy, however, said 
tribal corruption is "pervasive" and added that he was "hard-pressed to come up 
with a single tribe in Oklahoma that is not touched by it."

The Department of Energy's $81-billion plan to refurbish the nation's aging 
nuclear weapons plants leans too heavily toward modernizing production 
facilities and proposes too little for cleaning up 40 years of accumulated 
chemical and radioactive wastes, the congressional General Accounting Office 
said. The DOE's 21-year plan would result in a "revitalized weapons complex," 
Comptroller General Charles A. Bowsher told the House Budget Committee, but 
"the plan does not adequately address the cleanup . . . and decontamination of 
facilities as they are retired from service." Environmental restoration of 
weapons plants will extend beyond the year 2010 and may cost $40 billion to $70 
billion, Bowsher said.

Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney plans a fresh attempt to seek an acid 
rain treaty with the United States when he meets President Bush in Ottawa on 
Friday, according to Canadian officials. In his first trip abroad since taking 
office, Bush will hold an informal meeting with Mulroney to discuss a topics 
that also include trade, defense and foreign affairs. But Canadian officials 
stressed that Mulroney, who led his Progressive Conservative Party to a second 
consecutive majority government in November, will be renewing his quest for 
action on the thorny acid rain issue.

A parole board rejected freedom for the seventh time for mass murderer Charles 
Manson, convicted leader of the infamous "family" that murdered pregnant 
actress Sharon Tate and eight others in 1969. "He's still at war with society 
and definitely a danger," said Albert Leddy, chairman of the three-member panel 
of the state Board of Prison Terms, which voted unanimously against parole. 
Manson declined to attend the hearing at San Quentin after a dispute over 
whether he would be shackled. The board considered the latest psychiatric study 
and his prison history, which listed six citations for behavioral problems 
since his last hearing. Outside, three men and a woman demonstrated in favor of 
Manson's bid for parole, waving signs, one of which read, "Find A New 
Boogieman, Give Charlie A Break." "It's sort of a human rights thing," said 
demonstrator Tina Williams of San Francisco. "Everybody in America should be 
allowed a fair hearing and he didn't get one."

SOCIETY: WHITNEY GIVES A TOOT ABOUT THE SYMPHONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dorene Whitney, the La Jolla socialite who has become known as one of the 
county's most efficient and successful volunteer fund-raisers, seems not to 
have absorbed the lessons of the "once-burned, once-learned" theory of 
experiential education. The woman, who found herself the focus of controversy 
when she headed the 1985 benefit-opening of Symphony Hall, has agreed to take 
on a second major San Diego Symphony benefit when the adjacent Symphony Towers, 
the city's tallest building, officially opens in September. 
</P>
<P>
To those excluded from the symphony's inner circles, everything appeared to be 
sweetness and light on Nov. 2, 1985, when the former Fox Theatre reopened as 
Symphony Hall. Sylphs hidden in the chandeliers showered roses upon the packed 
house, which included nearly 1,000 patrons who had paid as much as $1,000 each 
to attend an event that was billed, in a conscious abandonment of modesty, as 
"the party of the century." Sandwiched between an extravagant reception and a 
lavish supper party, the program featured performances by Joel Grey, Diahann 
Carroll and the San Diego Symphony Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
Whitney masterminded the event. As the beneficiary of months of media attention 
and unfettered hoopla, it generated $730,000, a sum so remarkable that the 
symphony seemed buoyed by a rising jet stream of champagne bubbles certain to 
bear it to previously undreamed-of heights. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Bubbles Burst 
</P>
<P>
Yet, within weeks, those bubbles burst. The organization, which often had been 
reported as being mired in fiscal quicksand but which seemed to have stepped 
onto solid ground when it acquired Symphony Hall, announced that it had sunk 
into the worst financial crisis in its history. As 1986 dawned, the "party of 
the century" seemed nothing less than a hollow triumph for a symphony that was 
fighting not only for credibility, but for its existence. 
</P>
<P>
For Whitney, the symphony's unanticipated collapse was the nadir in an 18-month 
labor that started with her 1984 appointment as the fund-raiser's chairman. The 
stint frequently was punctuated by bitter disagreements -- both within the 
symphony and in the city's volunteer fund-raising community -- about the 
feasibility of her original plans and goals. (An early proposal called for 
tenting the intersection of 7th Avenue and B Street as shelter for a 
rococo-style entertainment for as many as 2,000 guests; the projected net for 
funds raised was $1.5 million.) The final, modified version fell far short of 
the original goal but still earned twice the amount raised by any gala in the 
city's history to that point. 
</P>
<P>
The diminutive blonde, now well along in the planning for the opening of 
Symphony Towers, asked, "Why did I go back to fund-raising for the symphony 
after all the problems I had with the Symphony Hall gala? 
</P>
<P>
"No one has had more problems that I had with that. But we need a symphony in 
this city, and the Symphony can't run without money." 
</P>
<P>
According to insiders tapped into the Byzantine communication channels that 
link the city's volunteer fund-raising forces, the planned Sept. 9 gala has not 
ignited the controversies that swirled around its 1985 predecessor. Plans for 
this year's gala are far less grandiose, but they are not modest. Whitney, who 
also founded the San Diego Opera's annual season opening-night benefit and will 
chair that organization's 25th anniversary gala next January, does not take a 
loving-hands-from-home approach when she mounts an event. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Classical Concert, This Time 
</P>
<P>
Whitney said she intends to do without the show-biz aspects of the concert that 
opened Symphony Hall. Plans this time call for a classical concert, starring a 
musician she refused to name, although, she said, he has been signed. She 
described him as "a world-famous performer who has never previously appeared in 
San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
The event will not be shy on expenses. Whitney said the star musician alone 
will command a five-figure fee, but added that underwriting by individuals and 
corporations, rather than proceeds from ticket sales, is expected to cover the 
bulk of the expenses. 
</P>
<P>
"The success of any event like this is determined by how much underwriting you 
can attract," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Whitney occasionally spoke like an investment banker who had pledged to 
multiply a client's grubstake in a brief time. 
</P>
<P>
"The symphony would like to earn $300,000 from the Symphony Towers opening, and 
I'll try for more," adding that the amount has not yet been earmarked for a 
specific use. 
</P>
<P>
Although $300,000 seems ambitious, Whitney said providing the right level of 
entertainment is the key to attracting 200 patrons at the price of $750 apiece, 
and another 800 in lower-priced -- but hardly bargain-basement -- categories of 
$250 and $300 a ticket. In order to fill Symphony Hall, much less expensive 
tickets will be available to those who only wish to attend the concert. 
</P>
<P>
Whitney already has sold more than 100 tickets in the top-price category. One 
marketing ploy was a recent champagne brunch and fashion show for women who 
have already purchased tickets for the opening. Such added attractions are 
perceived as increasing the value of an event, even though they have only a 
peripheral connection to it. 
</P>
<P>
Much more important are the details of the entertainment itself, and those in 
the top category -- limited to 200 -- will find themselves sitting pretty, in 
the auditorium's Grand Tier for the concert and later in the office tower's 
37th floor for an elaborate dinner. Guests in the lower-priced category will 
get a buffet in the "sky lobby" above Symphony Hall, and dancing, with the 
possible addition of Las Vegas-style entertainment, will follow. 
</P>
<P>
Whitney said she had to satisfy herself that the symphony was on "the right 
track" before she accepted the assignment of a fund-raiser, but, once that 
block had been passed, she was eager to go to work. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to keep music in San Diego by keeping the San Diego Symphony in 
business," she said. "A town is not a sophisticated town without a symphony. We 
can have theater, ballet and opera, but, without a symphony orchestra there's 
no music. But we have music in our Symphony Hall, and that's something to be 
proud of. It makes others think of us a city of culture, rather than as just 
another beach town. You can't live here just for the weather -- if you want to 
be part of San Diego, you have to support the arts."

Like many high school students, Andy Bell likes the purchasing power an 
after-school job promises. Every weekday afternoon, he rides a bus from Reseda 
High School to Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Woodland Hills. There, for 
the next two hours, the 18-year-old senior helps sweep floors, dump trash and 
clean conference rooms. He earns about $200 a month -- money he can spend on 
clothes or tuck away in his bank account. 
</P>
<P>
Bell works hard to fit in. And, at first glance, he seems like a typical 
teen-ager -- interested in hanging out with his friends, thinking about girls 
and earning money. But Bell is not typical. He is, according to the Los Angeles 
Unified School District, "high functioning educable retarded." And if it 
weren't for a special program set up by the district to help disabled students 
find work, he would probably be sitting at home every afternoon watching 
television reruns. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-year-old program, called Project Work-Ability, is designed to teach 
physically and mentally disabled students -- as well as those suffering from 
learning disabilities such as dyslexia -- the skills they need to function in 
the workplace. It offers classroom credit, and students are paid for their 
work. 
</P>
<P>
About 300 San Fernando Valley-area students from 17 schools and two 
occupational centers participate in the $1.2-million-a-year program, which is 
funded partly by the state Department of Rehabilitation and partly by the 
school district. Project Work-Ability has assisted more than 3,000 students 
since its inception. 
</P>
<P>
"For most of these youngsters, the gains in growth and confidence are 
phenomenal," said Mark Stephens, Project Work-Ability director and coordinator 
of vocational education for the handicapped for the school district. "It's a 
chance for them to get their first work experience and learn the proper work 
habits." 
</P>
<P>
Added Arnie Mates, a Project Work-Ability vocational counselor who has worked 
with Bell: "You see tremendous results from this program. It really helps these 
kids to gain work experience before they leave school." 
</P>
<P>
Employment for the disabled is not an insignificant problem. According to 
Stephens, the unemployment rate for both physically and mentally handicapped 
people consistently hovers between 50% and 80%. 
</P>
<P>
"The handicapped have been grossly under-represented in the workplace," he 
said. "But it's not because they are unable to function. Many of them are 
entirely capable of doing a job as well as anyone else, if they get the 
chance." 
</P>
<P>
Work experience programs now exist in several states. According to Pat Dougan, 
a program coordinator for the state Department of Education, 146 Work-Ability 
programs have been set up in California's 1,000 school districts; 15,000 
students are involved. A similar program is available at some regional 
occupational centers and community colleges. 
</P>
<P>
Locally, more than 100 companies have become involved in the program, including 
Burger King, Kaiser Permanente, Marriott Hotels, McDonald's, Pizza Hut and 
Universal Studios Tour. Jobs range from cashier and janitor to mechanic and 
records clerk. 
</P>
<P>
The important thing, Stephens noted, is to find the right match, since "even 
the most severely handicapped individuals can perform certain jobs." He pointed 
out that several quadriplegic students who are confined to wheelchairs -- some 
of whom cannot speak -- are holding jobs. One student works as an interoffice 
messenger for a large insurance company and uses a special computer that he can 
program to say various phrases. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Employers Receptive 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the employers have been very receptive once they get involved in the 
program," Stephens said. "They generally like it and request more students. 
There are employers who have chosen not to participate, which I believe is due 
largely to a lack of understanding about what the disabled can do." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Stanley, an employment interviewer for Universal Studious Tours, has hired 
dozens of disabled students through the program to fill a wide array of jobs. 
"We have gotten some good employees out of the program. These are good, 
qualified kids who want to work. I've found their attitude a lot better than 
some of the kids who weren't disabled. Often, they feel they have something to 
prove." 
</P>
<P>
Maryanne Malzone, an employment specialist who has been responsible for hiring 
several students, including Bell, for Kaiser Permanente said: "They are 
productive and a benefit to the company. Most of these kids are real nice and 
they appreciate the fact that they are getting a chance." 
</P>
<P>
During the three years Bell has worked at Kaiser -- first handling clerical 
duties in personnel before moving to housekeeping -- he has blossomed into an 
excellent employee, Malzone said. At first he required a fair amount of 
supervision but he is now able to work almost entirely on his own. In addition, 
he has learned to take buses to and from work and has become far more 
self-dependent. 
</P>
<P>
Special-education high school students -- there are about 5,000 in the L.A. 
School District -- are offered optional classes to help them learn about 
vocational possibilities. Advisers, who are not involved in everyday teaching, 
work with the students in small groups or on a one-to-one basis, teaching them 
how to fill out job applications, prepare for an interview, and enroll in 
various classes and find potential jobs in the community. The advisers then 
regularly check with the employer to see how the student is doing. 
</P>
<P>
All the students are paid. Most are put on the company payroll; when employers 
cannot afford the wages the school district covers the cost. Most of the 
students earn $4.25 an hour, with a few making as much as $8 or $9 an hour. 
Stephens hopes some will be able to move into full-time work at the same firm 
when they graduate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Decline Offer 
</P>
<P>
Some special-education students who believe they can better deal with 
employment on their own choose not to participate in the program. Stephens is 
comfortable with their decision: "A lot of them get by very well and don't need 
our support. They don't want to be identified as having a disability. And 
that's completely understandable. Many adults who had learning disabilities in 
school are out in the workplace right now and are succeeding very well. Once 
they left high school and had the label removed, they learned to function just 
fine." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, not every student works out for every job. "We have had situations 
where kids have been fired from jobs," Stephens said. "But that's part of life 
-- and we have a support system within the program to deal with that. A lot of 
times the firing has been completely justified. There have been only a few 
isolated cases where the youngster may have been terminated because of the 
disability. It's illegal, but it still happens." 
</P>
<P>
Parental satisfaction seems high. Bell's mother, Rosalie Bell, said the program 
has made her son "more responsible and taught him a work ethic. Children who 
are handicapped have to have a way to become part of society without being a 
burden." 
</P>
<P>
Gail Slater, whose son, Brian, has a learning disability, said: "He never would 
have made it without the help." Today her son attends community college, works 
and lives on his own. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Parental Concern 
</P>
<P>
Although some parents of more severely disabled youngsters have expressed 
concern and apprehension at first, Stephens said that "after they see the 
success the youngster experiences, after they see the change in self-image and 
confidence, they generally become very supportive of the program. 
</P>
<P>
"These people have always wound up in the work force," he added, "but usually 
not as a stable part of it. They might have gone from job to job and gotten 
terminated a few times before they made the adjustment. And a few years ago, 
the really disabled stayed at home. They collected their Social Security checks 
and sat in front of the television set most of the day. . . . We're helping 
them become useful members of our society. Most of them only need a chance."

BENEATH THE VALLEY, CIVILIZATION'S CONDUITS FORM A MAZE OF SEWERS, PIPELINES 
AND ENOUGH TELEPHONE WIRE TO WRAP THE EQUATOR 334 TIMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
When crude oil began hemorrhaging to the surface of Ventura Boulevard in 
September, it was the first time that most Encino residents knew they were 
living above an oil pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, it had been there for 50 years, intertwining with a maze of other 
pipes and conduits, one part of an increasingly congested subterranean traffic 
jam. 
</P>
<P>
Statistics for the underground can be mind-numbing: 15,000 miles of natural gas 
lines, 8 million miles of telephone wires, 3,000 miles of sewers, hundreds of 
miles of storm drains and more than 50,000 manholes. But there is much more, 
including nine oil company pipelines, water lines large enough to accommodate a 
car and a cavernous natural gas storage facility that holds tens of billions of 
cubic feet of fuel. 
</P>
<P>
It took one visit and five subsequent telephone calls before someone from the 
Department of Public Works could answer the question: "Who do I speak with to 
learn what is under the San Fernando Valley?" And in the case of an emergency 
response to a man-made or natural disaster, representatives from the state fire 
marshal's office, which keeps tabs on underground hazardous materials, said 
that until a new state law went into effect Jan. 1, not every pipeline had to 
be reported to their office, making it difficult to know exactly where 
everything really is. 
</P>
<P>
The largest part of this invisible empire belongs to the Metropolitan Water 
District and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. Both companies have 
control facilities in Granada Hills and, like the tentacles of an octopus, 
major water lines radiate from there in all directions. 
</P>
<P>
"We have 75% of L.A.'s water supply coming through the Valley, with the primary 
purpose of the major transmission lines being not only to get the water there, 
but into the rest of Los Angeles as well," said DWP engineer Jerry Gewe. 
</P>
<P>
The largest is the Metropolitan Water District's Sepulveda Feeder, a 12 
1/2-foot-diameter pipe that roughly parallels the San Diego Freeway before 
tunneling through the Sepulveda Pass on its way south. According to Assistant 
Area Supt. Frank Bellisle, if a major catastrophe ruptured the line, hundreds 
of acre-feet of water would be released before it could be shut down. (One 
acre-foot is 326,000 gallons.) "If a contractor punched a hole, even a 
relatively small one, you'd probably see water shooting 300-and-something feet 
in the air." 
</P>
<P>
Three other water transmission lines weave under the Simi Valley Freeway west 
from Granada Hills, and a single line heads east. Other major lines go under 
Roscoe Boulevard, Topanga Canyon Boulevard, San Fernando Road and Coldwater 
Canyon Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Everybody from AT&amp;T to Western Union has something under the Valley, with 
Pacific Telephone taking top communication honors. If the wire underneath the 
Valley were stretched out, Pacific Telephone engineers estimated that it would 
wrap the Equator more than 334 times. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T, on the other hand, controls most of the long-distance trunk lines, 
the oldest being the 4-inch-thick Los Angeles-to-Santa Barbara cable that 
burrows under Cahuenga Pass and follows the Ventura Freeway out of town. 
</P>
<P>
Other lines include cables from Sherman Oaks north up the San Diego Freeway; a 
pair that work their way down San Fernando Road from Newhall, one going to Los 
Angeles, the other to San Bernardino, and a new fiber-optic line from Los 
Angeles to Santa Barbara that, when finished, will follow the Southern Pacific 
railroad tracks west before heading to Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
All sewers in the Valley can be traced to the original North Outfall Sewer line 
constructed parallel to the Los Angeles River in 1929. Today, there are 3,000 
miles of lines from homes and businesses that dump into 300 miles of larger 
sewage transmission pipes. Two other working lines are older, the DWP's 1913 
Owens Valley Aqueduct and an Arco oil pipeline dating from 1925. 
</P>
<P>
Major sewer pipes average 3 1/2 feet in diameter, but are up to 8 feet wide in 
the vicinity of the Donald C. Tillman water purification plant in Van Nuys, 
which is capable of recycling 40 million gallons of water daily. 
</P>
<P>
If something is lost in the sewer system, it will reappear at such places as 
Tillman. In addition to a never-ending stream of softballs, workers have found 
everything from jewelry and money to a complete motorcycle. The sewer system is 
also the Valley's manhole champion, with about 45,000. Pacific Telephone comes 
in a distant second with 6,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Storm drains usually follow the street pattern," said George Groves of the Los 
Angeles Bureau of Engineering. "Where the street goes, so go the drains." 
</P>
<P>
Besides sewers, most major north-south streets have some form of storm drain 
system about 10 feet below, with major arteries ranging anywhere from 5- to 
9-foot-wide pipes. 
</P>
<P>
The largest of the storm drains, measuring 17 feet wide by 10 feet high, runs 
along Topanga Canyon Boulevard from underneath Topanga Plaza south to Calabasas 
Street and Mulholland Drive. 
</P>
<P>
As with the sewer system, everything imaginable is found by city workers in the 
storm drains, especially mattresses. Skateboarders have been known to ride some 
of the steeper sewers, something the city learned only after homeowners 
complained of hearing squeals of delight coming from the catch basins. "Today," 
said Groves, "we have to put speed bumps in some of the open basins to keep 
kids from skating." 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses to a gas main rupturing say it has all the fury of standing next to a 
jet engine. Two years ago at Burbank Boulevard and Lindley Avenue, a pipe broke 
during a repaving project, the pressure physically raising the street as the 
gas moved underground. It did not ignite. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California Gas Co.'s main line enters the Valley through Newhall, 
journeying to an underground storage facility in Aliso Canyon just above 
Northridge. The porous sandstone below Aliso Canyon, a depleted oil field, 
allows the gas company to pump the gas, up to 70 billion cubic feet of it, into 
the ground, where it is stored for future use. 
</P>
<P>
The gas company's 125 miles of transmission mains, 2,600 miles of distribution 
lines and the miles of individual hookups to homes and businesses raise the 
total gas pipeline figure to about 15,000 miles, company officials estimate. 
</P>
<P>
Radiating from Aliso are two major lines that supply the Valley as well as move 
the gas to other parts of Los Angeles. One shoots down Wilbur Avenue to the 
south end of the Valley, another travels below most of Reseda Boulevard, two 
are buried beneath most of Burbank and Ventura boulevards. Other major lines 
can be found beneath Woodley Avenue, Balboa Boulevard and White Oak Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen from almost every company with underground facilities say 80% of 
their puncture problems come from somebody operating a backhoe. But that was 
not the case on Sept. 10 with the Mobil Oil line in Encino. 
</P>
<P>
According to Mobil, corrosion created by contact with a nearby water line 
caused a break in the oil line, which parallels Woodley Avenue through the 
Valley. Then on Sept. 26, during a routine pressure test, the system sprang a 
leak in the same area. "It wasn't a rupture. It was kind of like a 
self-inflicted gunshot wound," said Tim Selles of Mobil Oil. Whatever they 
were, the problems have prompted state Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles) 
to propose legislation requiring more rigorous testing of underground 
pipelines. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil is one of six oil companies operating nine pipelines that crisscross the 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The oldest belongs to the Four Corners Pipeline Co., a subsidiary of Arco. Laid 
in 1925, it parallels San Fernando Road from Sylmar down through the city of 
Burbank. The second Arco line follows the Hollywood Freeway south before 
heading up and over Laurel Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Two pipelines, one owned by Shell, the other by Unocal, follow the Ventura 
Freeway through Calabasas. Both roughly parallel each other up Mulholland 
Highway and follow the mountain crest before turning south into Mandeville 
Canyon. A second Shell line enters the Valley through Santa Susana Pass in 
Chatsworth, makes its way along Roscoe Boulevard to Sepulveda and heads south. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron operates one of the only lines specifically designed to serve the 
Valley rather than just travel under it. A single line runs north through the 
Sepulveda Pass and ends at a storage terminal at Sepulveda Boulevard and Oxnard 
Avenue. The 
</P>
<P>
company also operates the shortest pipeline, a four-block operation in Pacoima 
on Paxton Street that connects with an Arco line. Finally, there is a four-mile 
Texaco line operating from Aliso Canyon east to San Fernando Road. 
</P>
<P>
It falls to the state fire marshal to monitor and inspect all hazardous 
underground material. Until this year, pipelines operating below a certain 
pressure did not have to be reported. So when an aviation fuel line was 
ruptured by a backhoe at San Francisco International Airport last year, the 
fire marshal had no knowledge of its existence. 
</P>
<P>
"Before Jan. 1, nobody would have had to tell you unless something happened," 
said Arnold Moodie, supervising engineer of the state fire marshal's office. 
"If this accident hadn't happened, we still wouldn't have known it was there." 
</P>
<P>
Locally, Underground Service Alert of Southern California helps prevent 
contractors -- even after they have secured their digging permits -- from 
inadvertently putting a backhoe through a pipeline or telephone cable. "Before 
digging, state law requires you must call and find out if there is anything 
down there," said Ron Olitsky, president of Underground Service Alert. 
</P>
<P>
A call two days in advance of digging enables the nonprofit corporation to 
check its maps and call any subscriber showing an interest in that sector. 
Anyone who has underground facilities must belong to USA; their membership pays 
for the service. 
</P>
<P>
"We then get the information of where, what, when and who, transmitting it to 
those owners who have underground lines in that area and alert them that an 
excavation is going to take place," Olitsky said. "They then go out and mark 
and locate those lines where there may be a conflict. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have the maps, the blueprints or anything that delineates where or 
what it is," Olitsky said. "What we are is the communications link between the 
excavators in Southern California and the owners of underground lines."

ANN CONWAY: GALA OPENS DECORATIVE ARTS CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN CONWAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"We're really not about parties," whispered Gep Durenberger, knee-deep in a 
crush of revelers at the gala opening of the Center for the Study of Decorative 
Arts in San Juan Capistrano. "But you need them to get things going. We're 
about home -- studying about preserving beauty in the home." 
</P>
<P>
Well, everyone knows there's no place like home for a cozy, elegant party, and 
the guest list proved it on Saturday night. That's when such members of the 
rich-and-famous set as producer Norman Lear, mega-developer Donald Koll and 
business magnate Gavin Herbert -- each an admirer of Durenberger, the 
antiquarian who started it all -- swept into the new center to peruse period 
vignettes and polish off paella, French chocolate cake and white-chocolate ice 
cream. 
</P>
<P>
And such a home. The second you set foot on its tiny porch, you knew it was 
going to be a party package wrapped in style: the scalloped canopy that framed 
the doorway was festooned with bouquets of flowers and centered with a 
twinkling chandelier. White camellias drifted in a gushing patio fountain. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, fires roared. Classics by Porter and Gershwin were played on a 
mirror-finish grand piano. And champagne and appetizers were proffered from 
gleaming silver trays. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I've given birth," said Durenberger, brown eyes dancing as he 
drank in the richly appointed center, the first of its kind on the West Coast. 
"Really! We've had twins here! Maybe even quintuplets." 
</P>
<P>
John Saladino, the revered New York interior designer who was a school chum of 
Durenberger at Notre Dame (and is now busy-busy creating lush looks for Lyn and 
Norman Lear's new Los Angeles mansion), said the center is unique in the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
"You see this kind of thing in Europe, but for the West Coast, this is a rare 
opportunity for people to expand themselves culturally and at the same time 
learn about what their great-great-grandmother may have lived with and what 
they may now own." 
</P>
<P>
On view through May 6 is an exhibit entitled "California Style: Collectors and 
Collections," which includes such items as the 18th-Century cherry highboy 
loaned by locals Lori and Bob Warmington. "We've been collecting furniture 
since we were first married," Lori said. "The pieces are like children, a very 
special part of our lives." 
</P>
<P>
Art Birtcher, director of development for the center, and his wife, Gaye, 
honorary chairwoman of the gala, loaned their tabernacle, circa 1500, to the 
Renaissance vignette. Carved heads of a man and a woman decorate the sides of 
the rare piece, and a carved Cross of Godfrey of the Knights of the Holy 
Sepulchre embellishes the front. 
</P>
<P>
"How perfectly appropriate to have the center in San Juan Capistrano, where we 
have so much history," said Gaye, greeting guests with a mink tossed over her 
bare shoulders. (Fur was the wrap of choice. It was cold outside.) 
</P>
<P>
Gala chairwoman Electa Anderson wowed the crowd in an ecru opera coat that once 
belonged to her great-great-grandmother. She said she decided to become 
involved with the center after meeting Durenberger only a few months ago. "I 
could see right away he was the kind of man who makes dreams come true." 
</P>
<P>
Electa had a secret: She and her husband, Norman, were celebrating their 24th 
wedding anniversary at the affair. Underneath her lace-inset coat was her 
pearl-trimmed wedding dress. "I'm all CONWAYfor family," she said. "And I'm all 
for establishing a purpose for beautiful decor and an attachment to it." 
</P>
<P>
Durenberger said he thinks that the center's supporters must have been taught 
about beauty in their childhoods. "And learning about beauty makes you a better 
person. There's something very basic about it . . . a reverence. You don't even 
have to understand it." 
</P>
<P>
Also at the center of things: Lyn Lear, Norman's newish, young and charming 
wife, who said that the couple collect "a lot of modern art" and that their new 
home is going to be a mix of modern and classic; Marguerite Holub, who, during 
dinner, sat next to Norman Lear and told him that she remembers meeting his 
first wife, Frances (publisher of Lear's magazine); and designer Martha 
Gresham. 
</P>
<P>
Plus, David and Bette Auerbach (in the night's sartorial showstopper: a 
black-jet-beaded fuchsia silk ball gown by Nina Ricci) and Marsha and Phil 
Schwartze, who said he had been to San Juan Capistrano's sister city Petra (in 
Majorca), birthplace of Junipero Serra, and that it is so much like Capistrano, 
"with its swallows and rollings hills, that Father Serra must have felt right 
at home here." 
</P>
<P>
Other faces in the crowd: San Juan Capistrano Mayor Gary L. Hausdorfer; Jack 
and Jody Pike; Chris and John Luhrs; Harry and Diane Johnson (the designer who 
worked with Don and Dorothy Koll on their breathtaking chateau-by-the-bay in 
Newport); Joyce Mac Rae, an editor of House and Garden magazine, and Phil 
Jacoby, president of Marbella Golf and Country Club, who helped underwrite the 
affair. 
</P>
<P>
Special favors of fragrance were provided by Tiffany &amp; Co.

GUYS &amp; GALLEYS: COOK DOESN'T MEASURE SUCCESS IN SPOONFULS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE SPENCER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Precision in measurements is normally sacred to Jeremy Davis. 
</P>
<P>
The accuracy of gauging even micromilligrams of substances can be crucial in 
his job as supervising chemist of the Orange County Water District. 
</P>
<P>
But get him into his Mission Viejo kitchen and he doesn't even want to see a 
measuring cup, let alone worry about the level of liquid in it. Instead, he 
prefers to guess at amounts, using soup spoons to ladle ingredients into bowls 
for dishes he's preparing. Improvisation takes the place of precision. 
</P>
<P>
That made it a little difficult for him to share with Guys &amp; Galleys his 
no-explanation-necessary-for-the-name No-Measure Chicken. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something I literally threw together one evening when we decided to have 
chicken and then couldn't decide what to do with it," said Davis, 35. "We 
enjoyed it, and I still make it, but the ingredients do change." 
</P>
<P>
The dish is patterned, he said, after some foods he and his wife, Bernadette, 
have enjoyed in trips to Europe. "In the south of France in particular, you 
will see a lot of dishes using fresh tomatoes and onions." 
</P>

His wife, a history teacher at Saddleback College, "does the bulk of the 
cooking for the family," he said, "but we share the kitchen except for Sunday 
breakfasts and Christmas and Thanksgiving dinners; then it's exclusively mine." 
</P>
<P>
Davis began cooking at a young age (he even took a cooking class in junior high 
school) with the encouragement and assistance of his mother. "She was Italian," 
he said, "and loved to cook. Her kitchen was what I would call traditional but 
open-minded. She encouraged experimentation. 
</P>
<P>
"So, I know and enjoy cooking Italian foods, but I also do a lot of Polish 
cooking because of my wife's background (she's half Polish). As a matter of 
fact, I've gotten so much into Polish food that it's the only thing I make for 
our annual Christmas potluck at the office."

</P>
<P>
6 chicken breasts (boneless or bone-in) 
</P>
<P>
1 egg 
</P>
<P>
Milk 
</P>
<P>
Italian-seasoned bread crumbs 
</P>
<P>
Flour 
</P>
<P>
Margarine 
</P>
<P>
12 pearl onions 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Chicken broth 
</P>
<P>
Rice 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Preparation 
</P>
<P>
Break egg into large bowl, beat and cover with milk. Mix well. In a separate 
bowl, mix equal amounts of flour and bread crumbs. Place 8 to 10 pats of 
margarine on bottom of baking pan. Dip each chicken breast in egg-milk mixture 
and roll in flour-bread crumb mixture. Place each breast skin side up in pan. 
Bake in preheated 350-degree oven for 30 minutes, turning once. While the 
chicken is baking, slice tomatoes and pearl onions, allowing 3 tomato slices 
and 4 halved onions per breast. Turn breasts skin side up, garnish with 
tomatoes and onions and dampen each with lemon juice. Crumble dill between 
fingers and sprinkle over each breast. Return to oven until tomatoes begin to

JOSEPH N. BELL: DESPAIR AT AMERICAN PASSIVITY SPARKS A 'MOST OUTRAGEOUS' LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH N. BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several weeks ago, a Times editorial deplored the disappearance of individual 
outrage in our society. The immediate catalyst was the enormous federal 
deficit, but the comment covered a myriad of other public aberrations that we 
seem to accept almost passively these days. 
</P>
<P>
About the same time, Walter Cronkhite made a speech introducing former Rep. 
Barbara Jordan (D-Tex.), who was receiving a "Spirit of Liberty" award in New 
York. At the last minute, Cronkhite threw out his prepared speech and spoke 
with extemporaneous passion about Americans "who find their voices stilled by 
not-so-subtle ideological intimidation." 
</P>
<P>
"For instance," he said, "we know that unilateral military action in Grenada 
and Tripoli was wrong. We know that 'Star Wars' means uncontrollable escalation 
of the arms race. We know that the real threat to democracy is half the nation 
in poverty. . . . We know that religious beliefs cannot define patriotism. . . 
. And we know there is freedom to disagree with all or part of what I've just 
said. But Godawmighty, we've got to shout these truths in which we believe from 
the rooftops." 
</P>
<P>
I've watched this passivity in Americans with growing despair over my lifetime. 
The only voices we seem to hear these days are the organized lobbies grinding a 
single ax -- the gun advocates, the Right-to-Lifers, the gay-baiters. We've 
just witnessed a presidential election in which one candidate had to separate 
himself from the American Civil Liberties Union -- almost as if it were 
treasonous -- and found his patriotism questioned because he was associated 
with principles that have long been a bulwark in American society. 
</P>
<P>
Thinking on these matters, I have come up with my own outrage list. This is 
mine. I don't foist it on anyone else. but I firmly believe that a resurgence 
in strength in this country depends directly on individuals -- not pressure 
groups -- refusing to allow their voices to be stilled any longer by 
"ideological intimidation." 
</P>
<P>
Today, I find myself outraged by: 
</P>
<P>
* Those who want to stick all of us with a multibillion-dollar bill to bail out 
savings and loans which went broke mostly because of business practices that 
almost guaranteed that result. I don't hear any talk about stripping the people 
who ran those institutions of their own personal wealth before they start 
putting the bite on the rest of us. 
</P>
<P>
* The knowledge that so many of the same people who would deny choice to an 
expectant mother are also those who resist sex education in our schools, which 
would materially reduce the need for abortion. 
</P>
<P>
The crowning case in point is right in Orange County. Two decades ago, Anaheim 
High School had a sex education program that was a national model. Educators 
from all over the country came to study it. The program was thrown out by a 
noisy group of people who claimed that it was an instrument of the devil and a 
Communist conspiracy. Today, Anaheim has the second-highest ratio of teen-age 
pregnancy in Orange County -- trailing only Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
* The enormous bills run up by local police to pay off the victims of excessive 
police behavior. In a recent 3-year period, that amounted to $314,000 for the 
citizens of Newport Beach. Orange County taxpayers picked up a $375,000 tab for 
a lawsuit against Sheriff Brad Gates for electronic spying against his critics, 
who included a teacher and a local reporter. 
</P>
<P>
* The totally unnecessary and wrong-headed California state tax refund of last 
year. I just received a notice that I would have to pay income tax on a refund 
I didn't want and considered absurd. It seems even more absurd in the 
realization that this money could have been used to fund the social services 
the governor has cut out of his current budget on the grounds that the state 
can't afford them. 
</P>
<P>
* The refusal at every level of public officials to advocate or even consider 
the legalization of drugs as a plan that might very well fail but is at least 
worthy of consideration in a war we are losing badly. 
</P>
<P>
* The intransigence of the National Rifle Assn. and the spinelessness of 
legislators who are afraid to take them on. The time has come to legislate gun 
laws with depth and teeth. 
</P>
<P>
* The Republican honchos in Orange County who restored Thomas A. Fuentes to his 
job as party chairman despite his involvement in what many see as an attempt to 
intimidate Latino voters last November and the cries of outrage from other 
Republican officials throughout the state demanding that Fuentes resign. 
</P>
<P>
I'm just getting warmed up. I could add to this list considerably -- and maybe 
I will. Meanwhile, perhaps my list will inspire a little outrage in others. We 
need all of it we can get.

ASK THE VET: CAT'S OWNERS WORRIED ABOUT RODENT ULCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. GLENN ERICSON, Ericson, a practicing Orange County veterinarian, is 
immediate past president of the Southern California Veterinary Medical Assn. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Q: Our Kitty adopted us about 1 1/2 years ago, and at that time she was 
probably 1 1/2 years old. She has what the vet calls rodents disease on her 
upper lip. The vets(I've had second and third opinions) have tried everything 
they know and cannot cure poor Kitty. My vet has been consulting with a vet who 
specializes in animal skin diseases. 
</P>
<P>
The only results were seen when she was given a megadose steroid injection and 
a DiTrim antibiotic for 7 days afterward. But within 4 weeks, the disease was 
back and spreading much faster. Our vet is reluctant to continue the megadose 
of steroids because of side effects. 
</P>
<P>
We are all at a loss. Kitty does not seem to be in any pain and she has always 
eaten really well. I have also changed her diet several times at the vet's 
suggestion to see if it might be an allergy. 
</P>
<P>
If you can come up with any other suggestions, we are willing to try most 
anything. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. &amp; Mrs. D. Dennison, 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley 
</P>
<P>
A: From your description in your letter, your cat's condition is commonly 
referred to as "rodent ulcer," which is part of a complicated disorder known as 
the Eosinophillic granuloma complex. The actual cause of this disease is still 
unknown. It is not particularly associated with any other diseases. It 
generally affects the upper lip and appears as a deep ulcer or sore. Treatment 
of this problem is not always curative. In some cases, it may be a lifelong 
problem. In many instances, the condition reoccurs when treatment stops. 
</P>
<P>
As you have stated, the ulcers generally respond well to corticosteroids, which 
is the treatment of choice initially. In many cases, corticosteroids are 
continued on a lower dosage after the first couple of weeks until a low, 
every-other-day or every-third-day dosage is found. You should not stop this 
medication too soon because reoccurence may be very rapid. Antibiotics may be 
necessary if secondary infections become likely. Many cases respond well to 
maintenance doses of megestrol acetate (Ovaban), generally on a weekly basis. I 
would recommend a biopsy of this lesion, especially if it persists, to rule out 
the possibility of squamous cell carcinoma. Surgical removal may be necessary 
if the lesion is small. X-ray therapy has been tried in some cases with wide 
ranges of success. Your vet may want to consult with an oncologist for this 
kind of treatment. This particular disease can be very frustrating to treat but 
requires a lot of persistence on your part to help your Kitty. Good luck. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do you ever recommend a vasectomy instead of castration for male cats? Is 
there anyone who does these vasectomies routinely? I am considering getting my 
cat neutered, but I'm not so sure I want him castrated because I don't want to 
change his personality. What do you suggest? 
</P>
<P>
Karen B., 
</P>
<P>
Lake Forest 
</P>
<P>
A: I do not recommend vasectomies in cats because it does not eliminate the 
usually irritating side effects of having an intact male cat around the house. 
These cats will continue to act like intact toms with the usual fighting, 
spraying, very strong urine odor and often cranky dispositions. If your cat's 
personality is still quite pleasant, neutering should keep him that way and 
make him a better house pet.

PARK RENOVATION APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council this week approved conceptual plans for the renovation of 
McManus Park. 
</P>
<P>
The $1.1-million renovation will add additional space to the six-acre park at 
National Avenue and Ballona Creek by shortening the cul-de-sacs at Fay, 
McManus, Roberts and Reid avenues, which feed into the park. The number of 
parking spaces will be increased from 42 to 65. 
</P>
<P>
The tot lot area will be doubled, the recreation center will be moved to a more 
central location in the park and away from residences, two paddle tennis courts 
and a grass volleyball court will be provided, and a soccer field will be 
overlayed between two softball fields. 
</P>
<P>
The council also agreed to allow a cooperative nursery school to use the park's 
recreation center for a nursery school for half a day, three times a week.

State and federal anti-discrimination laws are the only codes governing the 
hiring of women as law enforcement officers. Individual departments can require 
a skills test, but the skills tested must be relevant to the particular job, 
according to the Orange County district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
The chart below shows the number of law enforcement officers in Orange County. 
The Westminster office of the California Highway Patrol has the highest 
percentage of female sworn officers, the Laguna Beach Police Department the 
highest percentage of women who rank sergeant or above. The La Habra Police 
Department has the lowest percentage of women in the sworn ranks. Many of the 
departments have no women officers ranking sergeant or above.

GLOCKENSPIEL APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council on Tuesday gave final approval for construction of a 
European-style glockenspiel in a three-story retail project nearing completion 
on Canon Drive. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed Beverly Hills glockenspiel was rejected by the City Planning 
Commission last year on grounds that it would violate the city's strict sign 
ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
The council on Jan. 10 voted 4 to 1 that the glockenspiel, modeled on the 
famous devices in Munich, Prague and Venice, was not a sign and that it should 
be allowed. On Tuesday, the council members again voted 4 to 1 in favor of a 
resolution affirming their earlier decision. 
</P>
<P>
The glockenspiel bears no relation to the musical instrument used by marching 
bands. Instead, it includes brightly-colored figurines dancing on moving tracks 
to musical themes. 
</P>
<P>
Planning official Ruth Nadel said any changes in the glockenspiel's design must 
still be approved by the Architectural Review Commission. Developer Moses 
Lerner's glockenspiel will center on the theme of American culture, and it will 
feature such figures as a movie projectionist, a dancer and a cowboy.

LOW-INCOME HOUSING PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council on Monday approved an amendment to the General Plan that will 
allow nonprofit developers to build more low-cost housing units. 
</P>
<P>
The amendment awards such developers a "density bonus" that permits them to 
build twice the number of units allowed under the plan, up to 20. 
</P>
<P>
For example, under the revised General Plan, nonprofit developers can now build 
16 housing units on a parcel of land that allows eight units. Developers must 
still build withing the same space, resulting in smaller units, said Debbie 
Potter, the city's manager for housing and economic development. All units must 
be affordable for low- and moderate-income renters, Potter said. 
</P>
<P>
Nonprofit developers are corporations that exclusively build low-income 
housing, such as Alternative Living for the Aged and the West Hollywood Housing 
Corp. They often depend on municipal and state funding and zoning variances, 
such as the density bonus. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Zimmerman, executive director of the West Hollywood Community Housing 
Corp., said the amendment will aid senior citizens because the extra units will 
rent for less than the prevailing rate. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're going to build housing that rents for $350 to $400 (per month) that 
would normally be rented for $1,500, there has to be recoupment somewhere for 
the developers," Zimmerman said. "That recoupment will come in the form of rent 
from extra units formerly not allowed by the plan."

Neon signs, blinking signs, square signs, round signs, signs with letters 
missing and every other type of sign imaginable inundate the area surrounding 
California's largest amusement park -- Disneyland. Adding to the visual 
pandemonium are utility poles and wires that extend along Harbor Boulevard as 
far as the eye can see. 
</P>
<P>
Newcomers deciding to take a drive or a stroll along Harbor Boulevard between 
Katella Avenue and the Santa Ana Freeway might very well wonder whether they 
took a wrong turn and ended up in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the older inns and motels, toiling amid all the joviality and 
merrymaking in Walt Disney's dynasty, are starting to show signs of wear. The 
consensus among merchants and residents in neighborhoods bordering the Magic 
Kingdom is that the area has taken a turn for the worse. 
</P>
<P>
An ad hoc group called the Anaheim Committee for Traffic Solutions -- 
consisting of city officials, motel and hotel owners and local business folks 
-- is ready to do something to rescue the area. Is am important consideration 
for Anaheim: The Harbor Boulevard strip sees 12 million visitors a year. 
</P>
<P>
The group has been meeting monthly at the Jolly Roger Inn near Katella Avenue 
and Harbor Boulevard to determine what to do with the aging, overbuilt 
community. Among the possibilities under discussion are: 
</P>
<P>
* Formulating a uniform sign code; using monument or ground-level signs. 
</P>
<P>
* Concealing utility wires underground. (In mid-January, the City Council 
decided to commission a $146,000 study to determine whether to place 
underground the utility lines in the Disneyland-Anaheim Convention Center 
area.) 
</P>
<P>
* Improving traffic flow and congestion (perhaps through a monorail or people 
mover). 
</P>
<P>
* Improving landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old Anaheim Convention Center, just across the street from 
Disneyland, is undergoing a $50-million expansion and renovation. When work is 
completed in the spring of 1990, the center will include a 150,000-square-foot 
exhibit hall and a 530-space parking structure underneath. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, 35.3 million people visited Anaheim and Orange County and spent $5.1 
billion on dining, shopping and entertaining, according to the Area Visitors 
and Convention Bureau. (Visitor totals for 1988 have not yet been compiled.) 
</P>
<P>
But the hotels, motels and other businesses along the Harbor Boulevard-Katella 
Avenue axis depend heavily on new attractions to draw more visitors into the 
area. The hope is that Disneyland's new ride, Splash Mountain, scheduled to be 
ready for the influx of summer tourists, will help reverse 1988's 2% occupancy 
decline for the 17,000 motel and hotel rooms surrounding the park.

Photo, Animal Magnetism Blind and deaf students at the Foundation for the 
Junior Blind got the chance to meet some animals from the Los Angeles Zoo, and 
foundation employee Diane Tarrant was quick to lend a hand -- and an arm. 
Tarrant, who is blind, became chummy with a small boa constrictor with the help 
of zoo docent Marilyn Rudzik. Before being passed around to the students, a 
ferret poked its nose against the grill of its cage. Everything seemed quite 
ducky, especially for Ricky Parral, a blind youth, who smelled his hand after 
petting a new friend. Chana Schwartz took her time feeling the contours of a 
turtle, which did not go unnoticed by a watchful opossum, secure in the arms of 
a docent. The encounter with the animals last week, the first for many of the 
students, was part of the zoo's outreach program. CASSY COHEN / Los Angeles

TEMPORARY LOCATION PICKED FOR CULVER CITY HALL OFFICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Culver City Council has decided to move into temporary offices on a 
residential lot at Culver Boulevard and Overland Avenue while the city's 
72-year-old City Hall is being replaced. 
</P>
<P>
Three people spoke Monday night against the council's plans to set up temporary 
trailers on the three-acre corner lot owned by the Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
The lot is the same area the council had selected in February, 1987, for the 
new City Hall, but public outcry for a downtown site forced the council to find 
another location. 
</P>
<P>
The city plans to raze the old City Hall at Culver Boulevard and Duquesne 
Street and replace it with a 30,000-square-foot, L-shaped building. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Abuts Residential Area 
</P>
<P>
City officials had expected more opposition to the temporary offices because 
the site abuts a residential area. 
</P>
<P>
"I was expecting at least a dozen people to speak, so yes, the fact that there 
were only three people did surprise me," Councilwoman Jozelle Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
The three people who spoke expressed concern about traffic, parking and whether 
homes could later be built on the site. 
</P>
<P>
Council members said that although the trailers will be in place for about four 
years during demolition and construction of City Hall, preparations for private 
development of the agency site will proceed after the city vacates it. 
</P>
<P>
Jody Hall-Esser, assistant executive director of the Redevelopment Agency, said 
city employees are expected to move into the trailers in June. The cost of 
moving and maintaining the temporary facilities, about 2,800 square feet in 
12-foot-by-60-foot trailers, is expected to be about $1.5 million over the four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
In a related matter, the City Council postponed a decision on the relocation of 
Fire Station No. 1, which is next to City Hall, but agreed to build the new 
station twice the size of the existing one to accommodate future growth. 
</P>
<P>
The city staff had recommended that the new station be built on the back half 
of Redevelopment Agency-owned property at Culver Boulevard and Irving Place 
about a block away from City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
But the council asked the staff to provide a financial analysis of a plan to 
build the station on the police station parking lot behind City Hall. Staff had 
opposed that plan because it would involve buying five or six residential lots 
on Lafayette Place and Braddock Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Hall-Esser said that the Redevelopment Agency could not afford to buy those 
lots unless other projects were postponed and that the time involved could 
delay construction of the fire station and City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The financial analysis is expected to come back to council within 30 days, 
Hall-Esser said.

GASTON GREEN STILL WAITING TO DELIVER AS RAM RUNNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN FLEISCHMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first time Gaston Green played in Anaheim Stadium, the results were so 
spectacular that giddy UCLA fans joked about adding green to the school colors 
of blue and gold. 
</P>
<P>
Green set what was then a major bowl record by rushing for 266 yards and three 
touchdowns for the Bruins in a game against Brigham Young in the 1986 Freedom 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The performance catapulted Green, then a junior, into the front-runner spot for 
the 1987 Heisman Trophy. During his senior season, the UCLA athletic department 
mounted an intense publicity campaign, complete with posters and weekly post 
cards to update the national media on his progress. 
</P>
<P>
Green was in the running for the Heisman until an injury kept him out of one 
game and parts of two others. Still, the graduate of Gardena High finished his 
collegiate career as the Bruins' most prolific runner and their No. 2 all-time 
scorer, behind kicker John Lee. 
</P>
<P>
Green's return to Anaheim Stadium in 1988 as a first-round draft pick of the 
Los Angeles Rams generated far less excitement. This time around, the only play 
on words his surname suggested was green as in inexperienced. 
</P>
<P>
The 14th player taken in last June's draft, Green saw limited playing time this 
season behind the tailback duo of Charles White, the NFL's leading ground 
gainer in 1987, and the surprising Greg Bell, who rushed for 1,212 yards and 16 
touchdowns in 1988. Green, whom the Rams selected with a draft choice acquired 
in the Eric Dickerson trade, played in only 10 games, rushing for 117 yards in 
35 carries. 
</P>
<P>
That's just two attempts more than he had in that Freedom Bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
Green, however, has no regrets about last season, and he defends the Rams' 
drafting him. Give him the ball, he says, and he'll show you what he can do. 
</P>
<P>
"Going into the season, I figured I'd carry the ball 10 to 15 times a game and 
catch some passes," said Green, who has gone back to UCLA to complete his 
bachelor of arts in history. "I was disappointed at first, because I expected 
to get more playing time than I did. . . . I didn't get an opportunity to show 
my capabilities, like I did at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"When your opportunity comes, you have to make the best of it. But I wasn't 
able to because I didn't get an opportunity really to play. . . . You have to 
be patient and wait for your chance to come." 
</P>
<P>
With White already established in the backfield after his best season, the 
Rams' plan all along was to bring Green around slowly. 
</P>
<P>
"You can make a big error, and I think everyone's done it," Coach John Robinson 
said during the preseason about Green. "You want a guy to be something. You 
draft him, recruit him to be that. He might not be able to be that for you. You 
have to take him where he's at and try to get the best out of him." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, when Green arrived at training camp, he wasn't all that impressed. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't as tough as I thought it would be, as when I was in college," he 
said. "It was tougher at UCLA as far as learning the system. (The Rams) do a 
lot of things the same way they do at UCLA, and that made it easier. 
</P>
<P>
"I was thinking they'd be hitting harder too. I didn't get to carry the ball 
that much, but the times I did, sometimes they'd hit me pretty good, but it 
wasn't as tough as I expected." 
</P>
<P>
The season started ominously for Green when he missed the Rams' first 
exhibition game with a bruised knee. But Green improved as the preseason went, 
rushing for 73 yards in 11 carries in the Rams' final exhibition game against 
San Diego. A showdown between the rookie and the veteran for the starting spot 
was expected. 
</P>
<P>
A changing of the guard, with Green replacing White, would have been a 
flashback of sorts. As a youngster, Green worked the sideline chains during the 
1977 Rose Bowl when White replaced the injured Ricky Bell in the USC backfield, 
signaling a new era in Trojan football. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been a fan of his ever since," Green said. 
</P>
<P>
As the season progressed, it was Greg Bell, however, not Green, who proved to 
be White's heir apparent. Green carried the ball five times in the Rams' opener 
at Green Bay, and his playing time dwindled even further until the sixth week, 
when Bell went out with a bruised shoulder in the third quarter of a game 
against Atlanta. Green carried 14 times for 61 yards. Two weeks later, Green 
missed the Seattle game with sore ribs, and he carried the ball just six more 
times the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Green thought he would have another chance to play when White was suspended for 
30 days for drug and alcohol problems. When Robinson kept the rookie on the 
sidelines, Green approached the coach. 
</P>
<P>
"(Robinson) told me that the way Greg had been playing, he didn't want to take 
out a running back who was playing as good as (Bell) was playing," Green said. 
</P>
<P>
On the brighter side for Green, his contract -- estimated to be worth nearly $2 
million over four years -- has given him some financial independence. He has 
purchased a house for himself in Tustin, assumed his parents' mortgage payments 
and bought them rings for their 25th wedding anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
And regardless of the lack of playing time, Green wouldn't have it any other 
way. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, I could be playing somewhere else, but who knows how good that team 
would be," he said. "This is where I grew up, and this is where I want to be. 
I'm happy where I'm at, playing for a winning team."

TOP GYMNASTS SET FOR UCLA/TIMES INVITATIONAL SATURDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five of the nation's top-10 college men's gymnastics teams will be featured in 
the annual UCLA/Los Angeles Times Invitational at 7:30 p.m. Saturday at Pauley 
Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
The field includes No. 2 UCLA, No. 3 Minnesota, No. 4 Illinois, No. 5 Nebraska, 
No. 7 Arizona State and New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA has won the last six of its invitationals. The Bruins, Arizona State and 
Nebraska have accounted for eight of the last nine NCAA team championships. 
Nebraska, defending NCAA champion, has won five titles since 1980, UCLA two and 
Arizona State one. 
</P>
<P>
Top individuals in the meet include UCLA's David St. Pierre, David Zeddies of 
Illinois, Nebraska's Patrick Kirksey and Arizona State's Licurgo Diaz Sandi and 
Jody Newman. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA also will take part Friday night in the UC Santa Barbara Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA gymnast Tanya Service, who has made a habit of setting records, turned in 
another last week as the No. 3 Bruins ran their record to 7-0 with a 189.8 to 
187.15 defeat of No. 11 Nebraska. Service set a John Wooden Center record in 
floor exercise with a 9.8 in the victory, UCLA's 23rd consecutive dual-meet win 
in the last three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Ranked first in the state, the Santa Monica College men's basketball team (25-3 
overall, 10-0 in the Western State Conference Southern Division) will try to 
win its 14th straight game when it plays host to Los Angeles Valley (17-10, 
7-3) at 7 p.m. Saturday at SMC. 
</P>
<P>
A game between the No. 8 SMC women's team (18-6, 6-2) and No. 15 Valley will 
precede the men's game at 5. The Corsair women are coming off a 62-60 defeat of 
Moorpark and a 61-60 loss to Oxnard. The SMC record for consecutive victories 
in men's basketball is 14, set by the 1982 and 1988 teams. Last week the 
Corsair men defeated Moorpark, 62-49, and Oxnard, 83-76. Earlier, SMC defeated 
Valley, 75-60. 
</P>
<P>
The UCLA women's basketball team (9-10 overall, 5-4 in the Pacific 10 
Conference) will play host to USC (7-12, 3-6) at 7 p.m. Friday at Pauley 
Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins will be trying to snap a three-game losing streak. Last week they 
lost to Washington, 79-68; to Oregon State, 81-58, and to Oregon, 75-65. 
Freshman center Molly Tideback leads the Bruins with an average of 12.7 points 
a game, and junior forward Sandra Van Embricqs is averaging 12.5 points and a 
team-high 7 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Free tickets to the USC game, compliments of AT &amp; T, are being distributed 
to nonprofit organizations and groups for disadvantaged youth. Call (213) 
206-6744.

METHANE DETECTORS LACKING IN LEAK ZONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As crews began pumping out dangerous methane gas that forced the closure of 50 
stores in the Fairfax District, Los Angeles building and safety officials said 
Wednesday that many homes and businesses required under a 1986 city law to 
install gas detection devices do not have them. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, city officials said, only high-profile businesses along 3rd Street 
have the mandated detectors. Many homeowners could not afford the devices, 
which cost up to $1,000, and follow-up inspections in many cases were not done. 
</P>
<P>
There were no estimates on the number of homes and businesses lacking the 
detectors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Enforcement Called Lax 
</P>
<P>
Officials acknowledged that enforcement has been lax, but they said Tuesday's 
leak and evacuation are likely to prompt a comprehensive city program to ensure 
compliance with the ordinance, which was enacted in the wake of a 1985 blast in 
which 21 persons were injured. 
</P>
<P>
"Enforcement may not have been strict, but the net result is the same," said 
Building Bureau Supervisor Ron Shigeta, whose section enforces the gas 
detection ordinance. "(The detectors Tuesday) warned people that there was a 
problem, and there was no loss of life." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a few stores reopened Wednesday, and work crews erected a 70-foot 
tower to begin the pumping operations to draw out the excess methane and 
rainwater, which may have precipitated the leak. Fire Department officials said 
work to relieve the methane gas forced to the surface is likely to continue 
today. If all goes well, 3rd Street may be reopened by Friday, Fire Department 
spokesman Vince Marzo said. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman John Ferraro, whose district includes the Farmers Market area, 
acknowledged that "there may not be enough detectors in the area" but pointed 
out that the cost of each device might help explain why some homeowners do not 
have them. 
</P>
<P>
Under the law, an estimated 15% of homes and businesses in a 400-block 
"potential risk" zone near the Farmers Market were required to install the 
devices. Especially targeted are those structures with basements. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance was praised Tuesday by Fire Department officials, who said 
detectors in the basements of the Ross Dress for Less and K mart stores warned 
employees of the methane gas leaks. That summoned fire units to the area, which 
was closed after highly flammable readings were registered. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
City Criticized 
</P>
<P>
But Wednesday, spokesmen for several homeowner groups criticized the city for 
largely ignoring the ordinance, charging that more detectors should be 
installed in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"All we have is this fantastic ordinance, but nothing happened," said Harald R. 
Hahn, president of the South of Burton Way Homeowners Assn. "We need proper 
supervision of those few safety measures now in place, as obviously this is not 
now taking place." 
</P>
<P>
Hahn and Diana Plotkin, president of the Beverly Wilshire Homes Assn., also 
criticized Ferraro and other officials for not ordering a geological study to 
assess the potential of danger in the area where "overdevelopment" might cause 
more problems. 
</P>
<P>
People should not have to worry about their lives being in "danger from this 
gas where they live," Plotkin said. 
</P>
<P>
Ferraro, in a telephone interview, said a new geological study is under 
consideration. But he criticized the homeowner groups for turning Tuesday's 
incident into a forum of second-guessing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easy to be a Monday morning quarterback," he said. "They are opposed to 
any development in the area." 
</P>
<P>
At one of the reopened stores, there was free if somewhat stale bread being 
offered. 
</P>
<P>
"I got all this bread," pleaded Effie Villanueva, shortly after Eva's Bakery in 
the Town and Country shopping center was allowed to reopen. "You want some?"

TEACHERS' REPRESENTATIVES AUTHORIZE STRIKE VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH CONNELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Citywide representatives of Los Angeles' 22,000 union teachers, angered by a 
management threat to cut off their paychecks next month, voted unanimously 
Wednesday night to authorize a strike vote. 
</P>
<P>
The action, while expected, was a rank-and-file show of unity and an 
endorsement of the aggressive bargaining tactics of union leaders, particularly 
United Teachers-Los Angeles President Wayne Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
"That bureaucracy must be cut," Johnson told 300 teachers at the union's 
headquarters. "It's a fight over (spending) priorities." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson asked for the strike vote after schools Supt. Leonard Britton announced 
that he would withhold paychecks, beginning March 3, from teachers who do not 
file student grades with the district. As a pressure tactic in a year-old 
contract fight, more than 70% of the district's teachers last week refused to 
turn in grades to school offices. Instead, students were given their grades 
directly on report cards furnished by the union. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson also for the first time told teachers Wednesday night that they should 
turn in student grades if the union fails to block the district's pay 
withholding plan in court this week. He said the union will apply new, 
unspecified pressure tactics and prepare for a strike if grades must be 
submitted. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's action by the union's House of Representatives begins a two- to 
three-week strike vote process that will not be completed until ballots are 
distributed and voting takes place at nearly 700 schools. A strike cannot 
legally occur and is not expected until the spring. And even then a second 
strike vote would be required. Teacher anger was increased with the news 
Wednesday that the district will not just withhold teacher pay, but all the 
automatic payments normally made on payday, such as union dues, mortgage 
payments, insurance premiums or charitable contributions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Officials Disappointed 
</P>
<P>
District officials said they were disappointed by the approval of the strike 
vote, because they have made the best offer possible. They said a settlement 
can still be reached and noted that negotiations continued Wednesday and were 
scheduled to resume today. 
</P>
<P>
The teachers are seeking an 11% raise this year and a 10% raise next year. The 
district is offering 20% to 24% over three years, including 8% for the current 
school year. Whenever agreement is reached, the raise for this year will be 
paid retroactively to last July 1.

L.A. LIABILITY FOR PLANE BEACON BACKED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles City Council panel has recommended that the city accept liability 
for operating a navigational beacon atop the Forum in Inglewood so that it can 
begin guiding pilots landing at International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
The council's Industry and Economic Development Committee recommended Tuesday 
having the city indemnify the Forum, owned by Jerry Buss and used by Buss' Los 
Angeles Lakers basketball team and the Los Angeles Kings hockey club. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, chairwoman of the committee, asked the 
Department of Airports to continue negotiating with the Forum and Inglewood to 
share liability if a plane crashed as a result of the beacon.

ALLEGED GANG LEADER GUILTY IN DRUG CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man identified by authorities as a top lieutenant for the Grape Street Crips 
street gang was convicted Wednesday in Los Angeles on narcotics charges and 
faces a mandatory prison sentence of at least 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Dion Floyd, 27, who federal prosecutors said was supervising narcotics 
operations in St. Louis for the gang, was convicted of one count of conspiracy 
and one count each of distributing cocaine and rock cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Jeffrey C. Eglash said Floyd set up a drug deal with an 
informant and had his common-law wife, Lavada Floyd, who remains a fugitive, 
deliver a kilogram of cocaine and half a kilogram of rock cocaine to the 
informant and an undercover narcotics agent in South-Central Los Angeles. U.S. 
District Judge Robert M. Takasugi set sentencing for April 17. 
</P>
<P>
Because of two prior narcotics convictions, Floyd faces a minimum sentence of 
20 years in prison.

CLOTHING SOUGHT FOR HOMELESS YOUTHS

<P>
An organization that counsels homeless youths launched a drive Wednesday in Los 
Angeles to collect warm clothing and blankets for some of the estimated 10,000 
runaways and other displaced young people living on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of times the kids who come from other states aren't prepared because 
they think it never gets cold in Los Angeles, and they have just a handful of 
clothing on their back," said June Reese, a spokeswoman for Covenant House. 
</P>
<P>
During a news conference at the group's Hollywood headquarters, Supervisor Mike 
Antonovich urged residents to bring blankets, sweaters, scarfs and other warm 
clothing to any of 14 county Community Services Center for distribution.

JUDGE VOIDS CAMPAIGN SPENDING REGULATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles Superior Court judge Wednesday struck down a regulation by the 
state's Fair Political Practices Commission that allowed political candidates 
to spend campaign money raised before Jan. 1, thus conflicting with a provision 
of Proposition 73, adopted by the voters last June. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Kurt J. Lewin told the FPPC to rewrite the regulation to make clear that 
no such money could be used on political campaigns after the effective date of 
the initiative, but he left it up to the commission to decide whether that 
effective date was June 8, the day the measure was passed, or Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Millions of dollars of campaign funds held by scores of politicians is at stake 
in the suit brought by Common Cause against the FPPC regulation. If the money 
cannot be used, it would have to be refunded to the original donors, and some 
leading political figures with large campaign war chests would have to raise 
their funds all over again. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
City Candidates 
</P>
<P>
Lewin exempted Los Angeles city candidates from his ruling, accepting arguments 
by lawyers for Mayor Tom Bradley that Los Angeles has a more restrictive 
campaign funding law than Proposition 73, and therefore it does not apply in 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the FPPC said no decision has yet been made on whether 
Lewin's ruling will be appealed. 
</P>
<P>
Although Proposition 73 had clearly stipulated that no political funds could be 
carried over to future campaigns after the measure's effective date, the 
five-member FPPC decided to allow politicians to use contributions that did not 
exceed $1,000 each. Under this rule, if a contribution of $2,000 had been 
received from an individual, a politician could use $1,000 while returning the 
rest. 
</P>
<P>
California Common Cause Executive Director Walter Zelman, hailing Lewin's 
decision, declared Wednesday that pending further FPPC action, "Candidates 
shouldn't use the money in question for any kind of electoral purpose." 
</P>
<P>
Common Cause attorney Josephine Powe noted that the judge's ruling is effective 
immediately and constitutes a blanket prohibition against spending the campaign 
funds raised before whatever the FPPC rules is the effective date. Since this 
could be Jan. 1 instead of June 8, she said all funds raised before Jan. 1 
ought to be sequestered pending a new FPPC regulation. 
</P>
<P>
A challenge of the constitutionality of certain other provisions of Proposition 
73, particularly its ban on free mailings by elected officials, is scheduled to 
be heard in another Los Angeles Superior Court today.

MAYOR, CHIEF PROPOSE LAW FOR EVICTING DRUG DEALERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED VOLLMER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A city law requiring the eviction of tenants arrested for selling drugs at 
their rented apartments or homes was proposed Wednesday by Mayor Tom Bradley 
and Police Chief Daryl F. Gates. 
</P>
<P>
Patterned after a New York City law enacted last June, the ordinance would 
require landlords to launch eviction procedures against an arrested tenant 
within five days. Failure to do so could cost the landlord up to $5,000 in 
legal costs if the city attorney is then required to handle the eviction. 
</P>
<P>
"We will not surrender one inch of our city to gangs and drug dealers," Bradley 
said. "Any renter in the city should know: If you want to stay in your 
apartment, don't deal drugs." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Tool for Police 
</P>
<P>
Gates said that state law already allows police to seize cars and homes used by 
drug dealers and that the proposed ordinance would be an additional tool for 
the Police Department. Gates said evictions would occur only if drug peddling 
occurred, not if the tenant was only using the drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Gates added, however, that the eviction law will be applied regardless of the 
quantity of drugs being sold out of an apartment or rented house. 
</P>
<P>
"My policy is, if they are drug dealing and we have this ordinance -- zero 
tolerance, out they go," Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
Eviction proceedings could be started without a conviction for drug peddling, 
Bradley and Gates said. The mayor said the eviction would result from a civil 
proceeding requiring a reduced standard of proof than in a criminal trial. 
</P>
<P>
"If this ordinance is to be effective, we could not wait for the criminal 
justice system; the trials may drag on for months or even a year or more," 
Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Holden Has Doubts 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Nate Holden, who is opposing Bradley in the April 11 municipal 
primary, said he questions the proposed law's legality. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to get every dope pusher out of the city of Los Angeles. But at 
the same time, we should design laws that will not infringe on the rights of 
the innocent," Holden said. 
</P>
<P>
"Just to get at the criminal, you don't want to violate the rights of the 
law-abiding citizens who may also be using that apartment or house," Holden 
said.

TRIAL SET FOR ACTIVIST IN LONG BEACH STING ARREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Don C. Jackson, an activist against alleged police misconduct, pleaded innocent 
Wednesday to a charge of resisting arrest during a videotaped "sting" operation 
intended to uncover brutality and racism by Long Beach police officers. 
</P>
<P>
A Hawthorne police sergeant who is on long-term administrative leave, Jackson 
was arraigned before Long Beach Municipal Court Commissioner Joseph W. Blocker, 
who set trial for March 15. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, 30, was confident he will be cleared of the misdemeanor charge, which 
he said was filed in an effort to divert attention from misconduct by the 
officer who arrested him Jan. 14 after a routine traffic stop on Pacific Coast 
Highway in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
He and another man had donned shabby clothes, rented an old car and drove to 
Long Beach to document alleged harassment of blacks by the police. A television 
camera was hidden on the rear deck of the car. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Followed by TV Crew 
</P>
<P>
They were followed in separate vehicles by a television crew from the NBC 
"Today Show" and members of the Police Misconduct Lawyers Referral Service, a 
group fighting alleged police brutality. 
</P>
<P>
In a videotape shown nationally on television, Officer Mark Dickey spices his 
orders with obscenities when Jackson objects to submitting to a weapons 
pat-down. The officer then appears to push Jackson's head through the window of 
a motorcycle shop and throw him against a police car for handcuffing.

Airing of the videotape has sparked investigations by the FBI, the Los Angeles 
County district attorney's office and the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
It has renewed calls in Long Beach for a citizens' review board to probe 
allegations of police misconduct.

Working a Desk Job

<P>
Dickey is working a desk job as an auto theft detective pending outcome of the 
investigations. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach City Prosecutor John Vander Lans said in an interview that the 
charge was filed against Jackson because it appeared he was taunting the 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as this office is concerned, we saw nothing affected by the race, creed 
or color of Mr. Jackson," Vander Lans said. "We saw the acts of Mr. Jackson." 
</P>
<P>
After the arraignment, Jackson said the case will put the American justice 
system on trial. He added that he is only "guilty of being a black man in the 
United States." 
</P>
<P>
He said Dickey, not himself, should be put on trial. The officer, Jackson said, 
has "no excuse for the violence." 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Jackson could be sentenced to up to a year in county jail and 
fined $1,000.

EVICTION OF DRUG PEDDLERS FROM RENTAL UNITS SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley and Police Chief Daryl F. Gates proposed Wednesday that 
landlords in Los Angeles be required to evict tenants arrested for peddling 
drugs from their apartments or rented houses. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed law, which Bradley sent to the City Council for consideration at a 
later date, would give landlords five days to start the legal process to evict 
suspected drug dealers. If a landlord failed to act, the city would evict the 
tenant and could charge the property owner up to $5,000 in fees. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance would require only an arrest, not a conviction, to begin the 
eviction process. 
</P>
<P>
"We're determined to make it tough on those who engage in the sale of drugs," 
Bradley told a City Hall news conference. "We are not going to surrender an 
inch of our territory to these hoodlums, to these peddlers." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Nate Holden, who is challenging Bradley in the April 11 election, 
said he questioned the legality of the proposed law and will carefully analyze 
it when it comes before the council. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to get every dope pusher out of the city of Los Angeles. But at 
the same time, we should design laws that will not infringe on the rights of 
the innocent," Holden said. "Just to get at the criminal, you don't want to 
violate the rights of the law-abiding citizens who may also be using that 
apartment or house." 
</P>
<P>
Before the eviction process could begin, investigators would have to indicate 
evidence of drug dealing, such as scales, large quantities of drugs, large sums 
of money or drug-packaging material, Gates said. Also, police would have to 
show that undercover officers had made drug buys at the home or apartment. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed ordinance would require landlords to ask the suspected drug 
dealers to move out and, if they refused, to take them to court to force them 
to leave.

BILLY KIDD, JIMMIE HEUGA GAVE U.S. SKIING A BOOST IN '64 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

VAIL, Colo. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Billy Kidd's first reaction was, "Oh no, I didn't win the race." Jimmie Heuga 
said he took his gloves off and threw them down on the snow in disgust. 
</P>
<P>
The date was Feb. 8, 1964, the place Innsbruck, Austria. And moments after 
their initial disappointment subsided, both men realized that they had just 
made history, of a sort. 
</P>
<P>
"Not only had we won the first Olympic medals in men's Alpine skiing for the 
United States," Kidd said here Wednesday -- 25 years to the day later -- "but 
we had drawn the attention of the world and established the credibility of U.S. 
skiing." 
</P>
<P>
Kidd, with the fastest second run of the men's slalom, took the silver medal in 
that final race of the '64 Winter Games, and Heuga came out of the 
second-seeded group to earn the bronze. Pepi Stiegler of Austria won the gold 
medal. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't win," said Heuga, who now lives in the Vail Valley. "But we had done 
something that no other American male ski racers had ever done in the Olympics. 
It was a very special time, especially for the men, and it was definitely a 
team effort, with a common sense of sacrifice." 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the two longtime friends went skiing again between races of the 
1989 World Alpine Ski Championships. This time, Kidd beat Heuga down the slope 
again, but Jimmie has avalid excuse -- not that he would use it. 
</P>
<P>
Heuga, 44, has had multiple sclerosis since 1967, and fighting the disease has 
become the focal point of his life, along with skiing. He now heads the Jimmie 
Heuga Center, a nonprofit scientific research organization in Vail. 
</P>
<P>
Kidd, 43, who is director of skiing at Steamboat Springs, Colo., has written 
three books on skiing and does commentary for CBS. 
</P>
<P>
They each had success in racing after 1964: Kidd won the combined gold medal in 
the 1970 world championships at Val Gardena, Italy, and Heuga won the Arlberg 
Kandahar in 1967, when he also finished third in the World Cup giant slalom 
standings. But that Olympic slalom in '64 was the big breakthrough. 
</P>
<P>
"Up until Innsbruck," Kidd said, "only our women skiers were being taken 
seriously, and we didn't even go to Europe in the winter of 1962-63. We stayed 
home in North America, and some of the Europeans came over and took part in our 
races. We figured that this would help us get some points to boost our seedings 
when we did go over the next winter. But the European ski officials disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
"Bob Beattie was the ski coach at the University of Colorado then, and he was 
named the first full-time U.S. Olympic Alpine coach. We arrived in France 
around Thanksgiving of '63 and trained with the French team, which was then No. 
1 in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"But when we began racing, we had starting numbers down in the 40s, 50s and 
60s," Kidd said. "In those days, especially, it was impossible to win if you 
had so many racers chewing up the course ahead of you." 
</P>
<P>
Beattie, who is also at Vail as an ESPN commentator, argued with the 
International Skiing Federation (FIS) officials and, with the help of some 
impressive results by Kidd, Heuga, Buddy Werner and Chuck Ferries, finally got 
his racers better starting numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Kidd said, Americans were considered second-rate skiers. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember that Christmas, two months before the Olympics," Kidd said. "We 
didn't have enough money to come home, so we stayed in Europe over the 
holidays. One afternoon, we had tea with the ski-school director at St. Anton, 
Austria, a crusty old fellow. He asked me politely how I thought I might do in 
the Olympics. I said that I hoped to win a medal, and he roared with laughter. 
</P>
<P>
"Subconsciously, I guess, this just made me more determined. 
</P>
<P>
"But then at Innsbruck, I drew No. 1 for the downhill, and I remember standing 
in the starting gate, 2 minutes away from a 60-m.p.h. run down a chute of sheer 
ice, with 50,000 people watching on the course, TV cameras trained on me and 
Nikons all over the place. My knees were barely holding me up, and I was having 
trouble breathing. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a classic case of stage fright. I made a mistake about four gates into 
my run and wound up 16th. I was so angry with myself that I was determined 
never to have stage fright again. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten days later, by the second run of the slalom, I was a different person. My 
parents were there, and they said people were screaming for me, because I had a 
chance to win the race, but I didn't hear them. I was concentrating so 
completely that all I could hear was my (ski) edges on the ice, trying to find 
out if I was skidding or carving my turns." 
</P>
<P>
He was sixth after the first run but had the fastest second run and finished 
only 0.14 of a second behind Stiegler. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I at least had the bronze, if Jimmie, who was still to come down, got 
either the silver or gold," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Heuga was third after the first run, and Kidd said he had never seen a racer 
more relaxed in the starting gate. 
</P>
<P>
"He was standing up there," Kidd said, "and some girls along the course shouted 
out that they were from the University of Colorado, too, and Jimmie started 
carrying on a conversation with them, like he was just out enjoying an 
afternoon of skiing. But as soon as he started down the course, he shut 
everything else out and concentrated totally on the race." 
</P>
<P>
Said Heuga: "I knew I had a chance for a medal, but I felt kind of funny 
because I thought Buddy Werner deserved one more than me. When I came through 
the finish and knew that I had the bronze, the first person to rush over and 
embrace me was Werner. Buddy was just happy for the whole team." 
</P>
<P>
Werner, who was killed shortly thereafter in an avalanche, finished eighth, and 
Heuga said: "I had mixed emotions after the race. First, I was disappointed 
that I hadn't skied fast enough for the gold; then I realized that the bronze 
wasn't so bad, after all, and I was proud for the United States, and finally, I 
was uneasy because I felt that Buddy really should have gotten a medal instead 
of me." 
</P>
<P>
Heuga was 0.25 of a second behind Kidd, and both of their runs were called by 
Jim McKay of ABC, which was televising its first Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
"It was kind of a watershed," Kidd said. "Those were the last Olympics for 
wooden skis and leather boots -- we were using the new metal skis in downhill 
but not in the technical events. And interest in skiing really took off in the 
United States right after that." 
</P>
<P>
Kidd went on to win the world professional ski-racing championship in the 
spring of 1970, after his gold medal at Val Gardena. The next year, he lost the 
pro title to Spider Sabich, by 0.007 of a second, and since then has been 
affiliated with Steamboat, about 50 miles from here. 
</P>
<P>
"The main thing I try to do," Kidd said, "both in my racing camps and my free 
clinics that I give at noon each day when I'm there, is to tell skiers to watch 
the best racers in the world, on TV or in person. This will make anyone a 
better skier. Racers also want to get down the hill without falling, and you 
can learn from them, no matter how well you ski." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his books, Kidd has produced a video, "Billy Kidd's Ski Racing," 
which he said, naturally, can benefit all skiers, not just racers. 
</P>
<P>
Kidd was recently divorced, after a 12-year marriage, and has two sons, 11 and 
9, and a daughter, 5. 
</P>
<P>
Heuga, who married his first wife in Geneva shortly after the 1968 Winter 
Olympics at Grenoble, France, was divorced three years later, just a few months 
after he was diagnosed as having MS. 
</P>
<P>
"I started having vision problems as early as the spring of 1967," Heuga said, 
"and I was feeling some numbness in my legs, but it would come and go. I 
started seeing an ophthalmologist and other specialists, but it took them until 
September of '70 to figure out that it was MS." 
</P>
<P>
Heuga, who grew up in Squaw Valley, Calif., spent the next decade or so as 
director of skiing at the Bear Valley resort in the Sierra, and working for a 
ski equipment company. 
</P>
<P>
"Then," he said, "I became kind of a hermit in Connecticut. And I spent the 
time forming my thoughts on how to live the rest of my life and developing my 
own fitness program." 
</P>
<P>
Soon, Heuga was giving his ideas to others, and he found himself speaking to 
more than 70 chapters of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. 
</P>
<P>
His theme: "You don't have to sit and wait fatalistically for a miracle cure to 
come along. You can take charge of your own life and live it to the fullest." 
</P>
<P>
Heuga, who has a problem with his balance, walks with the aid of a cane, swims 
almost daily, and skis as often as possible. "I've been on the hill 18 days so 
far this winter," he said. "Last year, I skied 44 days." 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, with the help of a $10,000 grant from the Vail Valley Foundation, 
Heuga founded the Jimmie Heuga Center here. He soon raised another $60,000 from 
various charitable events and was on his way. The center's 1989 budget is 
$900,000. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 22 ski resorts in North America help by playing host to his Jimmie 
Heuga Express, in which three-skier teams raise money by skiing as many 
vertical feet as possible on a given weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Heuga has also received financial aid or encouragement from Martin Davis, 
president and chief executive officer of Gulf-Western; Dr. Robert Slater of the 
National MS Society, and former President Gerald R. Ford and his wife, Betty. 
</P>
<P>
"The Boston chapter of the MS Society helped publish my program in a book 
titled, 'Maximizing Your Health,' " Heuga said. "Following the program may not 
affect one's condition, but it can affect his or her health and help to make 
life more enjoyable." 
</P>
<P>
At his center, Heuga has a staff of 40 professionals. It offers 5-day seminars 
for groups of 25 each and has a 10-month waiting list. Heuga said: "We show 
those who are physically challenged, not just with MS but with other 
conditions, how they can deal with the uncertainty in their lives, uncertainty 
that can lead to self-doubt and then to a loss of self-esteem. We try to give 
them the motivation to regain control of their lives." 
</P>
<P>
Heuga seems to be dealing nicely with his own life. He married the former 
Debbie Dana two years ago, and they expect their first child July 21. 
</P>
<P>
But he says he still hopes to beat Billy Kidd to the bottom of the hill some 
day.

BASEBALL PLAYERS ARE HELPING THEIR OWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE JACOBSON, Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ballplayers aren't any different now from how they were a generation or a 
century ago, so they shouldn't be blamed. They still think history began the 
day before yesterday and life goes on forever -- happily ever after. 
</P>
<P>
They don't know about the players who came before them and made the game the 
pot of gold it is today. 
</P>
<P>
For that matter, neither do the owners, who made fortunes on the backs of 
players and didn't have to give back freedom or money. 
</P>
<P>
George Steinbrenner makes the other owners look bad. Whatever Steinbrenner's 
motivation, the New York Yankees' owner is the first of the owners to respond 
to the work of the Baseball Alumni Team, the group that puts on the Old Timers 
Series for Equitable. 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees play the Kansas City Royals July 13 and Steinbrenner has pledged to 
take expenses off the gate and give the balance to the fund that helps needy 
baseball people. Consider that he might have at least 40,000 in Yankee Stadium 
for the first game after the All-Star break, and it's a substantial gesture. 
</P>
<P>
The Alumni Team stages a game in each of the 26 ballparks. They average 33,000 
per game. The owners donate only the playing field. Equitable gives the Alumni 
$10,000 for each game and $1,000 to each player. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989 the term "needy" in reference to an athlete looks like a contradiction 
in terms. The last thing they should need is public charity, as long as owners 
and players are reaping rich rewards. But players haven't always made the kind 
of salaries they enjoy now. 
</P>
<P>
And not even the black players acknowledge the contribution of the Negro 
Leagues. "I read about Babe Ruth and Walter Johnson when I was growing up," Bob 
Gibson said. He didn't read about Willie Wells, and neither did I because 
Willie Wells played in the Negro Leagues and the national print didn't give it 
much coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Willie Wells died a few months ago, and his widow is broke, says Joe Garagiola, 
the new president of the Baseball Alumni Team. If you need a spokesman for a 
cause, Garagiola is the spokesman you want. If you want examples, Garagiola 
will give examples and protect anonymity and dignity at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
The organization paid rent for Denny McLain's family while he was in prison and 
helped hold the family together. Somebody from the group read a Tampa, Fla., 
newspaper headline about a raffle to buy an artificial leg for a former 
big-league outfielder, who turned out to be Sandy Amoros. He's the fellow who 
made the catch that saved the 1955 World Series for the Brooklyn Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
A former teammate of Garagiola suffered a stroke and his wife wrote that the 
sheriff was at the door and she had no place to turn. She owed $263 in payments 
on their trailer and $233 in rent to the trailer park, $1,100 to Sears, $600 to 
Penney's, $700 to Belk's and $323 in taxes. The Alumni Team now pays the 
mortgage and rent. 
</P>
<P>
By the standards of today's ballplayer, the figures are a pittance. The 
commissioner's office pays expenses for the Alumni board of directors. The 
owners contribute nothing. The players association acknowledges something, but 
it finds complications blocking participation when it ought to find a way to 
help. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't say they were obligated," Gibson said. "I'd like them to feel they 
want to contribute something." 
</P>
<P>
When the baseball pension was established in 1946, it was to be funded by the 
radio fees for the World Series. And so it went for four years. The 1950 
Phillies insisted on keeping the television revenue for themselves. Marty 
Narion, then the union head, had to make an impassioned plea to get their 
contribution. 
</P>
<P>
The difference between then and now is that almost all of the old-time players 
had to go to work after baseball. Today, the pension pays $90,000 a year at age 
62 for the top category. There are about 400 living players from before the 
pension and even some of today's players who need help. 
</P>
<P>
There are a number of younger, recent players who need help as well. One is 28 
years old. "Mental problems; difficulty adjusting," said Ralph Branca, the 
outgoing president of the Baseball Alumni Team. 
</P>
<P>
Many players find life a trial after competition and celebrity. They thought it 
would go on forever. 
</P>
<P>
"Too bad other walks of life don't have the services we can give our own," 
Gibson said. He is one of the most active of the contributors and was as tough 
a player as there ever was. He wouldn't talk to a man from an opposing team in 
an All-Star Game. 
</P>
<P>
He is very much like Bill White, the president-elect of the National League, 
who thinks too many hitters complain about being thrown at when all the pitcher 
has done is come inside. White and Gibson were roommates on the good St. Louis 
teams of the mid-1960s. White was skilled at pulling the outside pitch; Gibson 
tried to preserve the outside corner of the plate for his own by pitching 
inside to players who crowded the plate. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson is delighted for White's election -- personally, for a good friend -- 
and for the fact of it. "It gives kids who might look at this an idea that 
things can be different, that 'it might happen for me,' " Gibson said. "After 
he does a good job, it's going to prove to a lot of Archie Bunkers life is not 
quite what they thought."

U.S. FIGURE SKATING CHAMPIONSHIPS; 
</P>
<P>
CAMPBELL IS RUNNER-UP TO TRENARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jill Trenary is presumed to be so far above the other women in the U.S. figure 
skating championships that they don't even think about competing against her. 
They are, however, competing among themselves for second place and a trip to 
Paris next month for the world championships. 
</P>
<P>
Jeri Campbell, a former national junior champion from Garden City, Mich., who 
trains in Burbank, was the best of the rest Wednesday at the Mount Pleasant 
Arena in the compulsory figures. Holly Cook of Bountiful, Utah, was third. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think any of the girls see themselves on Jill's level," said Cook's 
coach, Kris Sherard. "If she loses, it will be because she beat herself." 
</P>
<P>
But not even Trenary, 20, fourth in the 1988 Winter Olympics, expected to be so 
dominant in the compulsory figures, which count toward 20% of the final score. 
All nine judges ranked her first. 
</P>
<P>
In the pairs' original program Wednesday night at the Baltimore Arena, 
Olympians Natalie and Wayne Seybold of Marion, Ind., were first; Kristi 
Yamaguchi of Fremont, Calif., and Rudi Galindo of San Jose were second, and 
Katy Keeley and Joseph Mero of Costa Mesa were third. The pairs' long program 
is scheduled for Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Yamaguchi, 17, the world junior champion last year in singles and pairs, was 
considerably happier after her performance with Galindo than earlier in the 
day, when she broke into tears after finishing eighth in the individual 
compulsory figures. 
</P>
<P>
Because of her remarkable jumping ability, Yamaguchi was favored to finish 
second in the final standings. But that was before Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Although she is not strong in figures, she was expected to rank higher than 
eighth entering tonight's original program, which counts toward 30% of the 
final score. The long program is scheduled for Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell, 18, didn't seem to mind that Yamaguchi has received more attention 
than she has, even though their credentials are similar. Campbell finished 
fourth in the national championships last year, just missing a place on the 
Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
"I think she's even overshadowed Jill this year," Campbell said. "Kristi's a 
great jumper, and people notice that. The jumps are the really intriguing part 
of the sport. I understand that." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell is more of a stylist, but she warned that her freestyle performances 
this week may not be very artistic. She suffered ligament damage in her right 
foot a month ago during a workout and has been back on the ice for only two 
weeks. Her doctor told her to take off two months, but she wanted to compete 
here. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell trained for 2 1/2 years with Barbara Roles in Harbor City, went home 
to Michigan last October when she felt that she was not progressing and then 
returned to Southern California in January to work with Frank Carroll. 
</P>
<P>
"My family wasn't that happy about me leaving home again," she said. "But they 
realize that as long as I'm skating, I should be going to the best coach." 
</P>
<P>
Her father is an executive for Ford. So that's what she drives. 
</P>
<P>
When she retires from the sport, however, she said that she's going to buy a 
Lamborghini. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm not going to ask him to pay for it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Notes

Many Southland high school football stars signed letters of intent with 
colleges outside of Southern California Wednesday, with three Pacific 10 
schools leading the way. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford scored big in the Southland, signing five local players including Bob 
Whitfield, Wilmington Banning's 6-foot-7, 285-pound offensive lineman. 
</P>
<P>
"I based my decision to go to Stanford on the total package of the school," 
Whitfield said Wednesday night. "I liked the school's academic and athletic 
program, along with the area it is in." 
</P>
<P>
Looking back at the last two years of being heavily recruited, Whitfield said: 
"At times the whole thing could be strenuous. I am glad that it's over." 
</P>
<P>
Other local players joining Whitfield at Stanford are 5-8 kicker Paul 
Stonehouse and safety Jimmy Klein of L.A. Loyola; quarterback Ron Redell of 
Encino Crespi, and center Rick Pallow of Santa Ana Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
California signed seven local high school seniors and four local junior college 
players. 
</P>
<P>
Among the seniors signed was Carson quarterback Perry Klein. 
</P>
<P>
"I was hoping when I committed to Cal more than a month and half ago that I 
could help influence others with their decision," said Klein, who led the Colts 
to the City 4-A Division title. 
</P>
<P>
Klein said he talked with Russell White before the Crespi running back decided 
to attend Cal. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that I really did help influence Russell and Kevin Kelly (of Santa 
Monica, who also signed with the Bears) with their decision," Klein said. "Cal 
is a school that has a football program that is going in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
Other high school players who signed with the Bears are tailback Greg Zomalt of 
Moreno Valley Canyon Springs, defensive lineman Todd Steussie of Agoura, 
offensive lineman Chris Lippincott of Huntington Beach Edison, quarterback 
Perry Klein of Carson, offensive lineman Andy Gonzales of Banning, and 
defensive back Darryl Brown of Playa del Rey St. Bernard. 
</P>
<P>
The junior college players are tight end Ken Griggs and offensive lineman, 
Darryl Pessler of Orange Coast College, offensive lineman James Richards of 
Antelope Valley, and defensive lineman Steve Smock of Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona boosted its ground game by signing two local running backs, Errol Sapp 
of Carson, the City player of the year, and Lamont Lovett of Franklin, the 
City's leading rusher last season with 2,201 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona State signed quarterback David Walsh of Palos Verdes, linebacker Jason 
Martin of Hacienda Heights Los Altos, and tight end Brian Ryder of Huntington 
Beach Edison. 
</P>
<P>
Washington State signed six local high school seniors -- running backs Phillip 
Bobo of Moreno Valley and Takim Brown of L.A. Washington, linebacker Christian 
Elias and lineman Brandon Griman of Apple Valley, linebacker Anthony McClanahan 
of Bakersfield, and linebacker Vince Saldivar of Anaheim Servite. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon State got St. Bernard linebacker Doug Nelson and Banning defensive back 
Paul Montgomery. 
</P>
<P>
The University of the Pacific recruited well in Orange County, signing 
all-county quarterbacks David Henigan of Fountain Valley and Troy Kopp of 
Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
Henigan was named the Southern Section Division I co-player of the year after 
leading his team to the Division I title. Kopp, who was second-team all-county, 
led Mission Viejo to the Division III semifinals. Pacific also signed running 
back Rob Kerns of Atascadero High, offensive lineman Chad Barron of Fontana, 
fullback Samila Manu of Carson, offensive lineman Fred Clark of Santa Monica 
College, and nose guard Jim Garvisch of Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific also signed El Camino College linebackers Deren Brady and Edwin 
Ulufanua, running back Brian Connors and defensive lineman Donnie Humphrey. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State signed three Banning players, defensive lineman Carlton 
Leomiti, offensive lineman Tom Siufanua and defensive back Eric Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton signed 22 recruits, headed by San Fernando defensive backs 
Howard McCrary, and Keary Johns. The Titans also signed wide receivers Johnny 
Lawrence of Banning and Shawn Facione of Placentia El Dorado. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado signed Dorsey quarterback Roman Foster and defensive lineman 
Marcellous Elder of Long Beach Poly.

Missouri assistant basketball coach Bob Sundvold, who is accused of violating 
National Collegiate Athletic Assn. rules by buying airline tickets for a 
then-Missouri player, has been suspended with pay. 
</P>
<P>
The suspension is pending the completion of an investigation by Athletic 
Director Dick Tamburo and faculty representative Carl Settergren into 
Sundvold's Dec. 27 report of the violation regarding his purchase of the 
airline tickets for P.J. Mays in October, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In a Nov. 16 conversation taped by Mays' mother, Yvonne, Sundvold reportedly 
admitted that he paid for two airline tickets for her son and asked Mrs. Mays 
to tell a Missouri athletic department official that there had been a 
misunderstanding about who bought the tickets. 
</P>
<P>
"The University of Missouri has a proud history of integrity in athletics," 
Tamburo said in a statement. "And it's because of that tradition that I must 
react strongly to any improprieties in our program." 
</P>
<P>
Sundvold, 33, is in his 11th season on Coach Norm Stewart's staff.

SWISS DOMINATE SUPER-G WITH HANGL, ZURBRIGGEN

<TEXT>
<P>
It took until the seventh event of the World Alpine Ski Championships for the 
Swiss to win their second gold medal, and they made doubly sure, finishing 1-2 
Wednesday in the men's super-G race. 
</P>
<P>
In the last world championships two years ago, Switzerland won eight of the 10 
golds awarded. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Hangl, 26, starting No. 1, finished No. 1 on the Vail Mountain course in 
1 minute 38.81 seconds, beating his better-known countryman, Pirmin Zurbriggen, 
by 0.28 of a second. 
</P>
<P>
Tomaz Cizman of Yugoslavia was a surprise third, another 0.09 back. Peter 
Mueller of Switzerland appeared to be on a medal run when he leaned too far to 
the right and took a horrendous spill, from which he emerged unhurt. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Ulrike Maier, 21, made Austria the sixth country to win a 
gold medal -- in the first six events -- when she took the women's super-G in 
1:19.46, edging teammate Sigrid Wolf by 0.03, with Michaela Gerg of West 
Germany 0.01 further behind. 
</P>
<P>
Maier, like Hangl, started No. 1 and watched as racer after racer fired and 
missed. 
</P>
<P>
"It was good to win," Maier said, "because there was some pressure on us, not 
only from our trainers, but also from journalists who kept asking us why the 
Austrian team wasn't winning." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. skiers have been consistently weak in the super-G, which is shorter than a 
downhill but longer than a giant slalom. Diann Roffe was 14th in the women's 
race, Tommy Moe 21st among the men for the best American placings. 
</P>
<P>
Alberto Tomba of Italy made his first appearance of the championships, coming 
in sixth, 0.92 behind Hangl. 
</P>
<P>
After seven of the 10 events, Switzerland has two golds, and Austria, 
Luxembourg, the United States, West Germany and Yugoslavia have one apiece. 
</P>
<P>
The men's giant slalom today figures to be a battle among Zurbriggen, Tomba, 
Luxembourg's Marc Girardelli and Austria's Rudolf Nierlich.

Syracuse basketball player Derrick Coleman pleaded guilty in Syracuse City 
Court to harassment and disorderly conduct charges stemming from a brawl and 
break-in incident on campus last December. Coleman was sentenced to 50 hours of 
community service and restitution for damages he caused. 
</P>
<P>
Because both of the charges are violations, which are non-criminal offenses, 
Coleman will have no criminal record, his attorney, Donald Martin, said.

NEWSWIRE: BORG SAYS HE TOOK PILLS TO COMBAT UPSET STOMACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former tennis star Bjorn Borg denied Wednesday that he had tried to commit 
suicide after he was rushed to a hospital in Milan, Italy, unconscious from 
taking sleeping pills. 
</P>
<P>
Borg, the five-time Wimbledon champion from Sweden, who had his stomach pumped 
in the hospital, said he became ill after mixing alcohol and sleeping pills in 
an attempt to combat an upset stomach. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot of fuss about nothing," Borg said. "I felt ill because I ate 
something that upset my stomach. Then I drank and then I took sleeping pills. 
After that I can't remember a thing." 
</P>
<P>
A Milan newspaper said that Borg had tried to kill himself after an argument 
with his fiancee, pop singer Loredana Berte. 
</P>
<P>
Said Berte: "Bjorn had an upset stomach, and to help his digestion he drank a 
couple of glasses of whiskey. Then he went to bed, but he couldn't sleep. He 
was tortured by nausea. 
</P>
<P>
"Hoping to get over it with a good sleep, he took a sleeping pill. Obviously 
this formed a deadly cocktail in his stomach." 
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials who treated Borg refused to say how many pills he had 
swallowed, or to comment on whether he had tried to commit suicide.

"Show people tend to treat their finances like their dentistry," Dick Cavett 
said in 1985. "They assume the people who handle it know what they are doing." 
</P>
<P>
Cavett was explaining how he had put money in a phony investment scheme that 
was designed to shelter his income with tax losses. He might have been speaking 
for people in a lot of other businesses as well. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the brightest lights of Hollywood and the sports and business worlds 
have been caught up in phony tax schemes that have come to light in recent 
years. Among the luminaries are actors Bill Cosby and the late Lorne Greene, 
CBS boss Laurence A. Tisch, producer Norman Lear, writer Erica Jong and 
ex-pitcher Don Drysdale. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, prosecutors in New York added some new names: Billionaire 
businessman John W. Kluge and the late fashion designer Perry Ellis, who 
prosecutors said were investors in an allegedly fraudulent tax scheme run by 
Jon Edelman of Rye, N.Y., and Bernhard F. Manko of Lighthouse Point, Fla. The 
pair were charged in a 32-count indictment. 
</P>
<P>
Celebrity victims in other cases have included the late pop artist Andy Warhol, 
actors Michael Landon, Bill Murray and Sidney Poitier, and Woody Allen and his 
collaborator Marshall Brickman. The canny businessmen who have been stung in 
such schemes include former U.S. Postmaster General Preston Tisch and Michel 
David-Weill, head of the Lazard Freres &amp; Co. investment bank. 
</P>
<P>
The sports notables who have seen their writeoffs disallowed includes San 
Francisco Giants pitcher Atlee Hammacher and Oakland Athletics second baseman 
Glenn Hubbard. 
</P>
<P>
Such luminaries tend to fall victim for some fairly obvious reasons: They have 
the money to invest, huge incomes to shelter from taxes and a desire to have 
somebody else handle their tax problems for them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tax Rules Tightened 
</P>
<P>
"They pass their problems over to the tax attorney or accountant, and he picks 
the investment for them," said Stuart E. Abrams, a New York lawyer who as a 
federal prosecutor pursued tax swindler Charles Atkins in such a case. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, in their eagerness to impress their clients by sharply reducing 
their tax bills, these tax advisers have led their clients to schemes that 
promised huge writeoffs. In the late 1970s and through much of this decade, 
investors could gain such huge writeoffs as limited partners in deals that 
invested in oil or gas, real estate, government securities or even horse 
breeding. 
</P>
<P>
Though tax rules have since been tightened, these schemes often promised to 
shelter $4 of income for every dollar invested. Sometimes they sheltered as 
much as $10 for every dollar invested. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, many celebrity victims turned up in cases that, like the 
Edelman and Manko case, involved allegedly phony investments in government 
securities trading. 
</P>
<P>
The investors in such cases were customarily told that their money would be 
used to trade in the highly risky government securities market. They were told 
that if the trading made money, they would share in the profits; if it lost 
money, they would reap the tax-loss benefits. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, prosecutors allege, the operators of such investment plans have no 
intention to make money but simply plan to rack up big losses, which they can 
pass back to investors. Among the cases like this are those Charles A. Atkins, 
"the boy wonder of tax shelters"; Washingtonian Edward A. Markowitz, and the 
Sentinel Government Securities case. 
</P>
<P>
The celebrities whose names have appeared in connection with these cases have 
often had the same tax adviser. 
</P>
<P>
In the Markowitz case, for example, Allen, his manager Jack Rollins, 
collaborator Brickman and others became investors because they were using the 
same accounting firm, the now defunct Bernstein &amp; Freeman of New York. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Carberry, the former federal prosecutor who led the government's 
efforts in the Atkins, Sentinel and Markowitz cases, said such investments 
often seem legitimate to outsiders because it appears that reputable lawyers 
and accounting firms have given them their blessings. The crooked firms show 
their books and operations to reputable lawyers and accountants, telling them 
they fully intend to try to make money in securities trading. 
</P>
<P>
"But they have no intention to -- and they've prearranged trades to ensure they 
won't make money," Carberry said. In the Atkins case, for example, Atkins' 
concern had "opinion letters" from the Big Eight accounting firm of Arthur 
Young &amp; Co. and from the reputable Washington law firm of Arnold &amp; 
Porter. 
</P>
<P>
The celebrities who fall victim in such cases, like other investors, often end 
up owing huge sums in back taxes and interest but are not charged with any 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the publicity about their involvement seems to cause the celebrities 
great grief. In early 1987, after actor Landon was identified as an investor in 
the Atkins scheme, he called a press conference to denounce then-U.S. Atty. 
Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York for releasing investors' names. 
</P>
<P>
Landon accused Giuliani of "climbing the political ladder on the backs of 
innocent American citizens." 
</P>
<P>
But some prosecutors contend that taxpayers should suspect the legality of any 
scheme that promises them $4 or $10 in writeoffs for every dollar of their 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
When he announced the Atkins indictment in 1987, Giuliani was asked about the 
innocence of Atkins' investors. He said he wouldn't comment on the ethics of 
what they had done, but added: "I wouldn't lose a lot of sleep sympathizing 
with their problems."

REGULATORS HALT CONCESSIONS USED TO BAIL OUT AILING S&amp;LS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SING, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The federal agency taking control of insolvent savings and loans called a halt 
Wednesday to the controversial practice of using certain costly government 
concessions to bail out the nation's ailing thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the agency that President Bush ordered 
this week to seize 224 ailing S&amp;Ls within the next month, said it would 
suspend consideration of any pending offers to acquire those institutions if 
they involve government loans or protection against losses. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to put together a transaction that has those features, 
because they are too potentially costly," said FDIC spokesman Alan Whitney. 
</P>
<P>
The FDIC's statement in effect is a renunciation of tactics used by the Federal 
Home Loan Bank Board, which arranged dozens of deals toward the end of last 
year whereby private investors acquired ailing thrifts using these or other 
concessions. The FDIC statement also suggests that the bank board has been far 
too generous in granting concessions to buyers of ailing thrifts, a sentiment 
echoed by several members of Congress and other regulators. 
</P>
<P>
The bank board, which has been stripped of its role as the primary overseer of 
thrift rescues, is the principal regulator of S&amp;Ls. The FDIC, which 
principally regulates banks, is seen as a far tougher regulator than the bank 
board. 
</P>
<P>
The FDIC statement also may be a recognition by the agency that Bush's 
comprehensive bailout plan for the nation's thrifts, announced Monday, may cost 
a lot more than the $90-billion price tag used by the President. 
</P>
<P>
"Before we go forward with transactions, we are going to evaluate . . . where 
we stand," FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman said. 
</P>
<P>
The FDIC statement thus could suspend dozens of takeovers for those S&amp;Ls -- 
solicited by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board -- that have been proposed but 
not finalized in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
Some deals have already been completed. The largest involved the acquisition of 
Stockton-based American Savings by Texas billionaire Robert M. Bass. 
</P>
<P>
Deals such as the American Savings-Bass transaction will not be affected by the 
FDIC's move as long as they are already finalized, FDIC spokesman Whitney said. 
But any others that are not "legally binding" are likely to called off or 
renegotiated, he said. FDIC officials could not say which deals, or how many, 
fall into that category. 
</P>
<P>
Under President Bush's plan, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board would declare 224 
thrifts nationwide insolvent but keep them open while the FDIC, acting as 
conservator, considers whether to sell or liquidate them. That plan got off to 
a quick start Tuesday when the FDIC took over as conservator of four ailing 
thrifts, including Pacific Savings Bank in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
The FDIC won't be able to liquidate or sell most or all of those S&amp;Ls until 
Congress approves additional funds that can be used to support such sales. Such 
approval may not come until June. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, however, the FDIC will be open to offers from investors to 
acquire these thrifts, as long as those offers did not involve government loans 
or guarantees against losses that might be suffered by buyers, Whitney said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in New York on Wednesday, the chairman of the bank board said that 
he expects many banks to acquire thrifts under the government's savings 
industry rescue plan but that he doesn't believe the program signals the death 
of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
M. Danny Wall also told a meeting of international bankers that the government 
actively would seek restitution from fraudulent thrift barons, whose actions 
have contributed to the industry's losses, said to be accruing at $500 million 
a month. 
</P>
<P>
He said the $90-billion bailout plan announced this week by President Bush does 
not signal the demise of a financial institution created in the 1930s to help 
Americans buy single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
"Over time, I'm convinced we should allow those kinds of institutions to borrow 
from federal home loan banks," he said. "You have to understand in this country 
we have had a very high commitment to home ownership."

Reflecting major shifts in the world economy, California has pushed past New 
York to become the nation's leading home to manufacturers with foreign 
operations, a new study has found. 
</P>
<P>
California now serves as the base for 150 multinational manufacturers, many in 
high-tech fields and with strong links to the Far East, according to the report 
released Wednesday by the Conference Board, a business research organization. 
</P>
<P>
New York, with 130 such publicly owned manufacturers, slid to second place, 
ahead of Illinois, Ohio and Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
"New York lost a lot to takeovers by foreign companies, companies moving out of 
the state and mergers in some cases," said James Greene, a trade specialist who 
helped prepare the report. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he added, California remained fertile territory for lean, 
youthful firms that make computers, electronics and other products. 
</P>
<P>
"California has been a place where this kind of company feels comfortable and 
is growing fast," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Major Distribution Point 
</P>
<P>
There are well-known reasons for California's emergence as a manufacturing 
center: its closeness to vibrant Asian economies, the availability both of 
unskilled and highly skilled labor, and an economic climate that seems to 
encourage entrepreneurs and new ventures. 
</P>
<P>
"The major trade corridor right now is the Pacific Rim to the United States -- 
and California is the major distribution point for that," said Stephen Levy, an 
economist at the Center for the Continuing Study of the California Economy in 
Palo Alto. 
</P>
<P>
What may be less widely known is how much some of these forces have begun to 
redistribute America's industrial might. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as 1987, for example, New York still held a firm lead in the number 
of multinational manufacturers, with 123 based there, compared to 108 in 
California, Greene said. Both states experienced gains in 1988, but New York's 
totals were partly offset by mergers with firms from abroad, such as the recent 
agreement by Pechiney of France to buy Triangle Industries, a New York-based 
packaging concern. 
</P>
<P>
In one ranking, however, the Empire State remains pre-eminent: It is still home 
to 44 manufacturing giants, those with annual sales of more than $1 billion and 
with such established names as Exxon, AT&amp;T and Eastman Kodak. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Giants Still Live in New York 
</P>
<P>
California only had 22 such companies, including Chevron, Occidental Petroleum, 
Atlantic Richfield, Lockheed and Hewlett-Packard. 
</P>
<P>
A glance at Fortune magazine's listing of the largest industrial companies 
underscores New York's continuing role as headquarters to the giants, with 68 
New York firms in the Fortune 500, compared to 41 from California. 
</P>
<P>
But if the mammoth firms tend to have New York addresses, the corporate cubs 
have an affinity for California, the new report suggests. California is home to 
66 multinational enterprises with sales below $100 million, almost double New 
York's total. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what made California so interesting," Greene said. "They have a very 
high number of smaller companies that are in this game." 
</P>
<P>
And to some observers, this suggests that growing numbers of industrial 
behemoths will be California citizens as well: "Eventually, some of them will 
fail but others will become the bigger companies," said Frederick Cannon, an 
economist with the Bank of America. 
</P>
<P>
Already, California leads in national statistics on manufacturing employment, 
once dominated by the Northern and Northeastern powerhouses of New York, 
Detroit and other cities. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles, with 910,200 manufacturing employees, led U.S. metropolitan areas 
in that category, according to the Commerce Department's preliminary 1988 
figures. In addition, San Jose was seventh, and Anaheim-Santa Ana (Orange 
County) was ninth. (New York placed fourth). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Axis of Tomorrow 
</P>
<P>
Those interviewed cited a range of secondary factors that contributed to 
California's manufacturing prowess. These included the fast-expanding 
population and high manufacturing productivity which is aided by newer 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, California's manufacturing base is expected to increase in 
importance, as America's competitiveness becomes increasingly linked to items 
at the upper end of technology. Many such goods include parts manufactured in 
such bustling Asian nations as Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea and Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
"The old axis was New York to London. The axis of tomorrow is Los 
Angeles-Tokyo," said Mansoor Zakaria, president of the MZ Group, a business 
information firm in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
But Zakaria said that other forces also were propelling California forward as a 
manufacturing center, including the rich mix of skills among California's work 
force and the widely shared feeling that it is a place where entrepreneurship 
will be rewarded. 
</P>
<P>
"Can you remember the last Horatio Alger story you heard about New York?" he 
asked.

Donald Trump hired former top casino regulator Mike Rumbolz to head his Nevada 
operations, an indication that the financier intends to become an active player 
in that state's gambling industry. Trump, who recently sold a large part of his 
New Jersey gambling empire to Merv Griffin, last month got federal antitrust 
clearance to buy more than 15% of the stock of Caesars World Inc., which owns 
one of the premier Las Vegas hotel-casinos, Caesars World. Rumbolz, whose term 
as chairman of the Nevada Gaming Control Board expired in December, said he had 
been negotiating with Trump since January.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which is taking control of 224 insolvent 
savings institutions, announced that it is temporarily halting S&amp;L rescues. 
S&amp;L regulators rescued or propped up 223 institutions last year, mostly by 
issuing promissory notes and pledging to cover losses. The FDIC, a commercial 
bank regulator, will spend the next month taking control of the remaining 
failed S&amp;L under orders from President Bush. The FDIC said it was calling a 
halt to assistance transactions until it can evaluate the institutions. After 
that, it will only resolve cases that can be supported by the S&amp;L insurance 
fund's cash flow.

The Chicago Board of Trade told its members that it would not stop brokers from 
dual trading -- trading orders for their customers and for themselves at the 
same time -- despite the much publicized federal investigation into alleged 
fraud. However, it said it would assess bigger fines on members who abuse the 
futures markets. The maximum fines assessed by the CBOT against traders will 
soon be increased to $250,000 from $75,000.

A trade publication reports that Litton Industries Inc. is interested in buying 
Norden Systems, the United Technologies Corp. division that makes military 
radar systems. A report in the most recent issue of Electronics News said 
Litton, based in Beverly Hills, is looking into buying Norden to improve 
Litton's market position with the military. Officials at UTC, based in 
Hartford, Conn., and Litton declined comment on the report. Norden, which has 
been up for sale since April, has been unprofitable for more than two years.

Garuda Indonesia Airways, the Indonesian national airline, said it would 
purchase six McDonnell Douglas MD-11 wide-cabin tri-jets at a potential value 
of more than $600 million. The announcement came just one day after five other 
airlines ordered up to 76 of the new jets. "The MD-11s will be able to fly 
non-stop to Europe, providing us with an important upgrading of our route 
system," said Garuda President Moehamad Soeparno.

The Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday proposed stiff new rules to 
protect small investors from high-pressure sales tactics often used in the sale 
of so-called penny stocks. 
</P>
<P>
The commission voted 5-0 to propose requiring stockbrokers to obtain written 
customer agreement and make a documented "suitability" determination before 
completing the sale of such stocks in most cases. 
</P>
<P>
Penny stocks are inexpensive issues sold over the counter. They are not listed 
on any major stock exchanges or quoted on the NASDAQ over-the-counter system. 
</P>
<P>
SEC staff members said the rule was deliberately crafted in a narrow way to 
avoid hurting the ability of small companies to use the markets to raise 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed rule "in no way is intended to target small issues or speculative 
investment decisions per se," said Richard Ketchum, head of the SEC's Division 
of Market Regulation. Rather, he said, it was designed to give investors a 
chance to make "careful and unhurried" decisions. 
</P>
<P>
The price of penny stocks is prone to manipulation because they are thinly 
traded and subject to domination and control by a single market maker. 
</P>
<P>
SEC Chairman David S. Ruder, who has vowed to step up the commission's efforts 
to combat penny stock fraud, said his target was "boiler room" operations used 
to make hundreds or thousands of telephone pitches a day to relatively 
unsophisticated people unable to properly evaluate the risks. Such operations 
are called boiler rooms because of the high-pressure tactics used. 
</P>
<P>
He said such operations had spread to many parts of the United States from 
Denver and Salt Lake City, their traditional bases. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Harper, administrator of the SEC's Miami regional office, described for 
the commission some of the techniques used by salespeople to clinch a sale. 
</P>
<P>
To rush people into making a decision, he said, sales managers would sometimes 
rattle a stapler to simulate the clatter of a ticker tape as their salesmen 
spoke on the phone. The pitchman would then tell a prospective buyer: "You 
better hurry. There goes the ticker. Orders are coming from Japan and Germany, 
and we only have a limited amount to sell."

SLOW BEGINNING BRANCHES INTO RECORD YEAR AT SUNKIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Sunkist Growers, the giant citrus-marketing cooperative based in Van Nuys, 
reported Wednesday that what had been an unpromising 1988 turned into the 
firm's best year, generating record revenue and earnings for its 6,000 farmers 
and packers in California and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
The results were reported at Sunkist's 95th annual meeting, which was held in a 
sprawling exposition hall on the Ventura County Fairground, as rain lashed the 
coast and freezing temperatures threatened nearby orange and lemon groves. 
</P>
<P>
But for now the focus was on last year, which also, recalled President Russell 
L. Hanlin, began with bad weather, lower-than-normal quality of fruit and a 
smaller-than-expected crop to market. All the same, he said, Sunkist's sales 
and other revenue totaled $886.6 million, up about 4%, despite what he called 
"one of the poorest Valencia crops in memory." 
</P>
<P>
The cooperative paid $645.9 million of that to its members, a 4.4% increase 
over that paid in 1987, which also broke the record set in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Adding internally generated sales by Fruit Growers Supply, a sister company 
that produces packing materials and other supplies for Sunkist, made the 
cooperative a billion-dollar enterprise last year for the first time, Hanlin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
However, domestic sales dropped $10 million last year because of the small crop 
and lower quality, he said. But export sales rose $35 million, the fifth 
straight yearly increase. Foreign sales benefited from the government's 
"targeted export assistance" program, which provides supplementary financing 
for market development. 
</P>
<P>
"At the same time," Hanlin said, "we were terribly disappointed that the new 
treaty with Japan on citrus (and beef) did not address the enormous duties 
which must be paid on imported oranges in that country." 
</P>
<P>
Sunkist had sought to persuade U.S. trade negotiators to seek to reduce Japan's 
tariffs on imported oranges instead of gaining entry for more fruit, judging 
that lowering duties first would eventually pave the way to increasing citrus 
import quotas. Florida's citrus industry sought increased volume to augment 
exports of its specialty, orange juice. 
</P>
<P>
The cooperative's export goal this year is to open "the potentially large 
Korean market" for fresh oranges, Hanlin said. 
</P>
<P>
The new fiscal year so far has produced uneven results, he said. Lemons and 
grapefruit "are off to quite a good beginning," but the present navel orange 
crop was slow to reach marketable size and sweetness. Freezing temperatures 
just before Christmas hurt crops in some areas, while high winds damaged 
oranges in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"We have undoubtedly sustained additional damage during the course of the past 
three nights, when temperatures dropped well below freezing," Hanlin said, but 
he added that it is too soon to assess the extent.

OTHER MEDIA GIANTS POST MIXED RESULTS; 
</P>
<P>
SALE OF RECORDS UNIT PUSHES CBS EARNINGS HIGHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services

<P>
CBS Inc. said Wednesday that its net profit from continuing operations rose 
sharply for the fourth quarter and year, but the gains came mostly from 
investing company cash in securities, and broadcasting profit fell 37%. 
However, net income for the quarter dropped 84% from strong results a year ago 
that included a huge gain on the sale of its magazine division. 
</P>
<P>
Another media concern, New York Times Co., posted a 19% increase in profits. 
But the Washington Post Co. reported that its fourth-quarter profit dropped 
42.7% from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
CBS' net income for the company rose to $1.15 billion from $452.5 million in 
the year, but fell to $40.1 million from $251.6 million in the quarter. The 
bulk of the company's net earnings for the year came from the sale of CBS 
Records, which boosted net profit by $866.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
Excluding special gains and profit from discontinued operations, CBS profit 
rose 78% to $40.1 million in the fourth quarter and went up 108% to $283.4 
million in the year. 
</P>
<P>
Network earnings declined in the year to $232.4 billion from $232.8 billion, 
and for the quarter the unit's profit fell to $12.4 million from $19.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Profits of the CBS Broadcast Group were . . . limited by the 22-week strike of 
the Writers Guild of America and by (the cost of) extensive coverage of the 
presidential campaign," Chief Executive Laurence A. Tisch said. 
</P>
<P>
The strike led to a delay in the start of the fall television program season 
and lowered advertising revenue. While the networks all lost viewers, the CBS 
network's ratings slumped most, falling to third out of the big three for much 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the writers strike and the cost of campaign coverage, the absence of 
the Super Bowl, which was seen on CBS in the prior year, led to lower earnings 
at the CBS network in 1988. CBS-owned television stations had record profits, 
with notable gains at KCBS-TV Los Angeles and WBBM-TV Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
New York Times Co. said its net income rose to $50.4 million in the fourth 
quarter from $42.5 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Fourth-quarter revenue rose 3% to $450 million from $435.5 million a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
For the year, it said net income rose 5% to a record $167.7 million from $160.3 
million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Full-year revenue rose 4% to $1.7 billion from $1.6 billion in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, chairman and chief executive, said, "The softening in 
some markets is likely to result in a down first quarter in 1989." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to publishing the New York Times, the company has interests in 
regional newspapers, magazines, broadcasting and forest products. 
</P>
<P>
Washington Post Co. said it earned $36.9 million in the fourth quarter, 
compared to $64.4 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Fourth-quarter revenue rose 1.6% to $370.8 million from $365 million a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The latest results included a $12.6-million charge related to a previously 
disclosed restructuring at Newsweek, while the 1987 earnings included $23.5 
million in one-time gains from the sale of cellular telephone interests. 
</P>
<P>
For the year, the company earned $269.1 million, up 44.1% from $186.7 million a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Full-year revenue rose 4% to $1.37 billion from $1.32 billion in 1987.

'AIN'T NOTHING CHANGED BUT THE ADDRESS';

<P>
A WEARY AND BITTER GODFATHER OF SOUL TRIES TO STAY UPBEAT IN SOUTH CAROLINA 
PRISON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON HARRIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was day 49 of his six-year prison stretch, and inmate No. 155413 had 
finished his morning duties. 
</P>
<P>
Inside State Park (S.C.) Correctional Institute, a hospital transformed five 
years ago into a minimum security facility, the Godfather of Soul had risen at 
5 a.m. to help prepare breakfast for about 150 mostly older prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
As he does every day, 55-year-old James Brown -- sentenced for failing to stop 
for a police car, a felony in South Carolina -- later telephoned his wife and 
his Augusta office to confer with the staff assigned to maintain operations. 
There were calls to Universal Attractions, his booking agency for some 30 
years, his record label, Scotti Bros. Records, other associates and friends, 
including the Rev. Al Sharpton. On this morning, he also returned a reporter's 
call. 
</P>
<P>
Prison, Soul Brother No. 1 said with customary bravado, might slow him down, 
but he'll be damned if it's going to stop him. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been in slavery all my life," Brown said via the prison telephone. "Ain't 
nothing new. It just means I don't have to answer a whole lot of phone calls. 
Ain't nothing changed for me but the address. I'm not worried. I feel 
fantastic. I'm James Brown 24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
"I just glad I'm in this business. I can take one song and it's restoration for 
my whole career. " 
</P>
<P>
With that, Brown said he is looking for "It's Your Money," his new record 
release due next month, to be "one of the biggest records I ever had." 
</P>
<P>
"It's what this country is all about," Brown said. "It's not your clothes. It's 
not your car. It's your money." 
</P>
<P>
That will be followed with an April release of a duo with Aretha Franklin, 
another big record, Brown predicted. It will be his first pairing with the lady 
long known as the Queen of Soul. 
</P>
<P>
But as much as Brown tried to maintain a positive and upbeat attitude, there 
was a weariness to his voice and a bitterness in his comments. 
</P>
<P>
"There's something wrong with the system," he said. "It's designed for you not 
to make it. And if you make it, it's designed for you not to keep it. Taking 
James Brown out of the music business is like taking Moses out of the Bible and 
saying it was a complete book. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a little disgusted. I feel that I haven't been treated fair, no justice 
for the things that I've done over the last four decades. I did the 'Don't Be a 
Dropout' campaign with Vice President (Hubert) Humphrey. I stopped the riots. I 
always tried to help. Had it been a man of another race, he wouldn't be where I 
am. There's no doubt about it. They wouldn't have allowed it. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel sad for Dr. (Martin Luther) King (Jr.). I feel sad for Elijah Muhammad, 
Malcolm X, Benjamin Bannaker because they fought for nothing. We're right where 
we were in 1968 when Dr. King died. The only thing is, we had jobs then; now we 
don't have jobs. When is America going to wake up and live and stop 
discriminating?" 
</P>
<P>
Brown said he's been moved by the hundreds of letters that have flooded into 
the prison, but he notes with some irritation the lack of support from the 
music business. 
</P>
<P>
"The only entertainer who has spoken with me is Little Richard," he said. "The 
rest of them is jiving. The ones I helped personally, which is about 90% of the 
entertainers, I don't even think about them. I don't even wait for their help." 
</P>
<P>
It was almost inevitable to some, while inconceivable to most that the musical 
legend and cultural hero known as Mr. Dynamite would wind up where he started 
39 years ago -- behind bars, a convicted criminal with an uncertain future. 
</P>
<P>
Like many of Brown's friends, Fred Daviss, Brown's finance manager for nearly 
15 years, saw it coming. When Davis stopped by Brown's office in Augusta, Ga., 
a week before the incident that landed Brown in prison, he saw a different man. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't the James Brown I know," Daviss said. "He was totally out of it. I 
had never seen him high in the office before. I told his wife, 'We've got to 
get him some help or he's going to wind up in bad trouble.' " 
</P>
<P>
But the idea of James Brown behind bars is still incomprehensible to many. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like losing a general," said Dexter Moore, 33, director of artists 
relations at BMI (Broadcast Music Inc.) in Los Angeles. "James Brown gave me a 
reason to get up in the morning and say I'm as good as the next guy. To see 
what I consider a hero fall like this, it's shocking." 
</P>
<P>
The James Brown success story has been told often as a symbol of 
self-determination and triumph over racism. Born to grinding Georgia poverty, 
abandoned by his mother and father, raised by an aunt in a brothel, Brown 
fended for himself as a youth on the streets of Augusta. At 10, he shined 
shoes. At 12, he danced for nickels and dimes thrown to him by soldiers 
returning from World War II. 
</P>
<P>
By 16, he was in juvenile detention, sentenced to four to 10 years for stealing 
a battery from a car. 
</P>
<P>
Then he rose to become a multimillionaire and one of the most influential 
artists in pop music history. As a recording artist, Brown reigned for more 
than a decade, a black entertainer unparalleled. During that period he produced 
45 Top-10 R&amp;B hits, 14 of which were No. 1. Only Elvis and the Beatles 
produced more Top-40 hits. 
</P>
<P>
Brown's music has influenced black artists from Sly and the Family Stone to 
Kool and the Gang to Prince to today's rap and hip-hop. Today, snippets of his 
hits, "sampled" on hip-hop and rap records, are at the core of that music, 
artists and critics say. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond his records, Brown's concerts were legendary, two hours of nonstop 
action. He was said to have lost as much as seven pounds a night dancing and 
singing through his shows. His tour schedule was as relentless as his stage 
shows, 51 weeks a year, year in and year out. To keep pace, Brown would often 
have local doctors along the tour route give him intravenous injections of 
fluids and nutrients. 
</P>
<P>
In the process, Brown amassed a fortune. By 1970, he owned three radio 
stations, a chain of soul-food restaurants, fabulous homes and a twin-engine 
Lear jet. By 1975, it was estimated that Brown was worth $41 million. 
</P>
<P>
By the latter part of the 1960s Brown had become a cultural hero -- 
particularly for blacks. 
</P>
<P>
"Black leaders from W.E.B. DuBois to Martin Luther King Jr. to Malcolm X had 
for years been preaching pride in your race, pride in your culture, pride in 
your heritage, but it wasn't until James Brown made 'Say It Loud, I'm Black and 
I'm Proud,' it was on everybody's lips," said Robert E. Johnson, editor of Jet 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Brown backed up his words by pouring millions of dollars into charities. Mayors 
of New York, Boston and Washington, D.C., called him in to help quell the 
racial violence that followed the 1968 assassination of Dr. King. Two years 
later, he did the same thing in Augusta. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to be more than just a person who screams and hollers on stage," 
Brown said in his autobiography. "I wanted to use my position to help people, 
and I wanted to have something to say about the country I lived in." 
</P>
<P>
But that was not the James Brown residents of Aiken County had seen over the 
last year and a half. Local television and radio stations reported during his 
trial that they had devoted more time to Brown and his troubles than they had 
even to the presidential race. 
</P>
<P>
Last Sept. 24, a doped-up Brown, armed with a shotgun, led police on a 
high-speed chase after interrupting an Augusta insurance seminar to complain of 
people using his bathroom. With their guns blazing, tires squealing and speeds 
approaching 80 m.p.h., a convoy of police followed Brown from Georgia to South 
Carolina and back into Georgia, before he was arrested and jailed. 
</P>
<P>
Fourteen bullet holes were found in his pickup truck and PCP in his 
bloodstream. "It's an absolute miracle that James Brown is alive," his 
attorney, Buddy Dallas, said. 
</P>
<P>
Three months later, Brown was sentenced to six years in prison for failing to 
stop for a police car. In most states, that charge is a misdemeanor, but it's 
felony in South Carolina with penalties ranging from a fine to as much as 10 
years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Many were stunned by the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hardly what one would anticipate, but one has to take a look at the 
overall facts to look at the judge's decision," Dallas said. "There had been a 
year and a half of domestic problems and other problems. One has to anticipate 
that the court took in consideration all of those circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
Around the nation, many had watched with concern. There were bizarre reports of 
high-speed chases and wife beating. His wife, Adrienne, 37, a high-spirited 
former makeup artist who says she once dated Elvis, claimed numerous beatings, 
once with a metal mop handle. (She never filed charges, but police said they 
frequently were called to the Brown house to investigate her claims.) On 
another occasion, she said, Brown had piled her clothes, including a $35,000 
fur coat, in the floor of their Beech Island home and shot them up with a 
rifle, and once he had even fired in a car with her inside. 
</P>
<P>
There were hints and rumors of a drug problem, namely PCP, a powerful 
hallucinogenic known to produce strange and often violent behavior. Early last 
year, Brown had been placed on probation after pleading no contest to 
possession of PCP, and last October he checked into a drug rehabilitation 
clinic for four days. 
</P>
<P>
It was the PCP matter that most disturbed those who knew Brown, who had waged a 
lifelong crusade against drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"James has not always had smooth relationships with his wives, but he has never 
been into drugs," said Patton, who worked for Brown for 10 years, until 1975. 
"He might smoke a joint every now and then to wind down from a show, maybe at 3 
or 4 in the morning back in his hotel room. But that was it." 
</P>
<P>
Brown's domestic problems also made national headlines. 
</P>
<P>
Friends and business associates blame much of Brown's current troubles on his 
marriage, a turbulent six-year romance that one friend called "a complete war." 
In the last year and a half, the singer twice filed for divorce, but changed 
his mind. 
</P>
<P>
Several friends and business associates said it is Brown's wife, convicted of 
PCP possession in New Hampshire last year and currently under indictment in 
Georgia for allegedly twice bringing PCP into the Augusta airport, who may be 
at the bottom of the drug problem. 
</P>
<P>
"Before she came into his life, he didn't have the problems that he's having 
today," said Jack Bart of Universal Entertainment. "I like Adrienne personally, 
but she's not good for him," attorney Daviss said. "I think she cares for him 
in her own way, but she's caused him a lot of problems." 
</P>
<P>
Aiken County Sheriff Carrol Heath said there is no doubt that the couple has 
had ferocious fights, for the details of which Mrs. Brown reportedly received 
$7,500 from the National Enquirer and $2,500 from the Star. But, he said, "I 
think Mrs. Brown gives out about as good as she gets." 
</P>
<P>
Brown refused to discuss those incidents in detail. 
</P>
<P>
"This is supposed to be a positive interview," he said firmly. As for his wife: 
"My wife is my wife. If I can live with it, everybody else ought to be happy." 
</P>
<P>
Brown said his problems with the law stem from harassment by law enforcement 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
"They've been doing it to me for the last 2 1/2 years," he said, "harassment 
over and over." 
</P>
<P>
Around the country, fans and friends have been mounting efforts to get Brown 
out of prison. Last month in Augusta, where Brown faced even more charges 
stemming from the Sept. 24 incident, his attorneys won an important first step 
when the judge there ruled that an additional six-year sentence would run 
concurrent with his present term. 
</P>
<P>
Brown still faces a hearing on the violation of probation for his previous drug 
and traffic conviction. If that is set aside, Brown's earliest release could 
come through a work-release arrangement. Outside of that, Brown comes up for 
probation in August, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in New York, record producer Van Silk and rap artist Mellie Mel have 
launched a "Free James Brown" movement, complete with black-and-white buttons. 
They are hoping to get one million signatures to persuade South Carolina penal 
authorities to show leniency. Plans are also under way for a James Brown 
benefit concert, Silk said. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said he had hoped that it wouldn't come to this. 
</P>
<P>
"I though the President (Ronald Reagan), since I supported him, would step in 
and help me," he said. "I served on his task force for the last seven years. 
Mr. Bush is in now. I figure then when they get around to it, they will come to 
my aid. Hopefully, they will understand that there is a man in jail for 
nothing. All of those other people that got in trouble and got out. I'm asking 
that they straighten out my business so I can get out and help the 
Afro-American culture in this country, bring them some ideas, like I did in the 
'60s and '70s and '80s. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to believe that when a man outdoes Beethoven, Bach and Brahms, they 
don't have a place for him."

CRITIC AT LARGE: GETTING ACQUAINTED WITH 'JANUARY MAN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, Times Arts Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the East Coast film observers has announced that the makers of "The 
January Man" can now relax. Theirs is no longer the worst movie of 1989, he 
said. "Her Alibi" with Tom Selleck and Paulina Porizkova has taken its place at 
the bottom of the barrel. 
</P>
<P>
I hear in such dismissive scorn all the accumulated weight of years of 
disappointment and outrage over movies that attempted too much and failed or, 
more often, tried too little and even muffed that. 
</P>
<P>
"Her Alibi" has not yet fallen upon my eyes, and I neither confirm nor deny its 
placement in the barrel. But I saw "The January Man" on a damp noon last 
weekend, with an industry audience that may simply have been glad to be in out 
of a cold rain but that laughed a lot and enthusiastically, as I did. 
</P>
<P>
What is true, as has been attested by the East Coast critic and many others, is 
that "The January Man" contains plot holes of immense size, has astonishing 
inconsistencies of tone and attack and leaves a curious general impression that 
the next time they'll get it right. 
</P>
<P>
But what is also true is that even in its artifices and its incoherences, "The 
January Man" does offer those laughs and some quite beguiling performances, 
even if you do leave the theater whistling, "What was that all about?" 
</P>
<P>
The most interesting thing about "January Man" is that it is the third film 
written by John Patrick Shanley. "Five Corners," loosely inspired by his 
boyhood in the Bronx in the 1950s, was quirky, original and not very 
successful. "Moonstruck" was quirky, original and, of course, hugely successful 
with (most) critics and audiences. (Shanley won an Oscar for original 
screenplay.) 
</P>
<P>
"January Man" is nothing if not quirky and original. It is not a rousing 
success, to say the least of it, but it offers a chance to triangulate on 
Shanley. 
</P>
<P>
The three scripts are clearly the work of the same idiosyncratic imagination. 
They have a consistency that, like it or not, is uncommon in film work -- or 
has been since Preston Sturges departed. 
</P>
<P>
Shanley appears to have a unique line on magical Eastern urban realism, a 
variant of the magical realism found mostly in contemporary Latin-American 
writers. It is an often paradoxical blending of the observed and the imagined, 
verisimilitude and wild fancy. 
</P>
<P>
In "Five Corners," Shanley gave us the unlovely reality of Bronx streets plus a 
kidnaped penguin, a true psychopath and victims killed by bows and arrows by 
other persons whose presence was never quite satisfactorily explained. The 
film, directed by Tony Bill, also had a nice nutty sequence in which young 
people rode up and down on the tops of elevators. 
</P>
<P>
Weird, all of it, although you could see that a certain amount of 
less-than-wonderful social truth was being diluted, so to speak, by the 
improbable, mildly fantastical imaginings. 
</P>
<P>
So it was in "Moonstruck," which was called "Moonstruck" for good reason. That 
old mythic moon was left over from Eugene O'Neill and several centuries' worth 
of predecessors. The realities of the city streets, double-entry bookkeeping 
and a sweatshop bakery were ameliorated by characters with one foot in farce 
and the other on the rim of tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
What "Moonstruck" proved beyond argument was that Shanley has a rare gift for 
dialogue. I'm not sure that an ear for dialogue is the way to say it. Real 
speech rarely has the economy, the timing, the polish that Shanley gives his 
talk. Like the dialogue in John O'Hara's best short stories, it is a 
simulation, but the disguise is perfect. 
</P>
<P>
Shanley also has a dramatist's feeling for scenes -- scenes with beginnings, 
middles and exits. They're his building blocks, and as assembled by Norman 
Jewison they gave "Moonstruck" an odd sense of orderliness, no matter how zany 
the goings-on got to be. 
</P>
<P>
With "The January Man," you do get the feeling that there is a great 
cutting-room in the sky someplace where all the missing exposition can be 
found. The back story never got out of the back room and there are moments when 
watching "January Man" is like trying to follow the third episode of a 
miniseries mystery after you've missed the first two. It doesn't matter a great 
deal, you tell yourself, but what was that business about the check? 
</P>
<P>
Shanley has evidently watched or read a bunch of mysteries himself and taken 
umbrage at the dazzling intuitions by which the sleuth perceives the pattern 
that produces the villain. Kevin Kline's tracking of a serial killer is the 
reduction to absurdity of all such intuitions, deriving the pattern from the 
moon, a constellation, a song title and mathematics -- and discovering a killer 
who doesn't look as if he could find his way to a subway station. 
</P>
<P>
The Shanley gifts for wonderful dialogue and for inventing characters who are 
poised somewhere between the abnormal and the bizarre remain intact in "January 
Man." Danny Aiello, the mother-loving suitor from "Moonstruck," is on display 
again as a police chief of profoundly uncertain abilities. Rod Steiger has some 
richly choleric moments as the mayor of New York. 
</P>
<P>
Like the two earlier films, "January Man" is full of what the Elizabethan poets 
called conceits, small, glittering and unexpected inventions: wonderful if they 
work, rather dismal when, as happens here, they don't. For example, Kline likes 
to cook meals of repellent unattractiveness for the women he loves, I guess as 
a test of their faith. But it is a notion that falls flatter than a diseased 
scrod. 
</P>
<P>
Pat O'Connor, who directed, found a welcome abundance of charm in Kline, even 
at the script's most foolish moments. But the melding of a kind of realism with 
a kind of burlesqued fantasy as demanded in "The January Man" would likely have 
been a problem for any director. 
</P>
<P>
You are left with some genuine laughter, with a renewed awareness that Shanley 
is a special and considerable talent, and with an equally renewed feeling that 
nobody wins 'em all.

SOME ADVERTISERS SHYING AWAY FROM TRASH TV PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANE HAITHMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although a Geraldo Rivera special on Satanism or a "reality" program that 
re-enacts a brutal murder may be OK for Raid bug spray, the people behind 
Campbell's Soup, Apple Computers and Kellogg's Frosted Flakes don't hold the 
same opinion. 
</P>
<P>
Those family items are among a long list of products that advertisers don't 
want associated with so-called "trash TV" or "tabloid TV" -- the new breed of 
sensationalistic programs that include "America's Most Wanted," "A Current 
Affair," some installments of "Oprah" or "Donahue," and just about anything 
with the name "Geraldo" in the credits. Some advertisers with a wholesome image 
to maintain are studiously avoiding this newest TV plague. 
</P>
<P>
But even though these advertisers are trashing trash TV, local TV stations say 
advertiser backlash will not kill off tabloid TV. 
</P>
<P>
Some station managers charge that advertisers who just say no to trash TV -- a 
hot topic at last week's National Assn. of Television Producers and Executives 
convention in Houston -- are blatantly self-serving. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe what we hear and see (about advertisers rejecting tabloid TV) is 
indicative of a completely ulterior motive," asserted Steven Gigliotti, 
director of sales for KCBS-TV, which airs "Inside Edition" and "Geraldo." "It's 
a negotiating ploy to help enhance their position in the market." 
</P>
<P>
Gigliotti believes that, although "about 3%" of advertisers will not buy time 
on trash TV, most who adopt a holier-than-tabloid attitude are merely jockeying 
for a better price. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an (advertising) agency in town . . . that has indicated that it 
doesn't want to put its clients on 'Geraldo,' " Gigliotti said. "The fact is, 
'Geraldo' is the show that we charge the most for. They're hoping that our 
account executive will deal a very desirable rate to get them to buy the show. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure when I leave, and the ABC (marketing executive) walks in, they say 
the same thing about Oprah Winfrey's show. It's just a ploy to take away our 
trump card." 
</P>
<P>
Greg Nathanson and Bill McGowan, station manager and general manager, 
respectively, of Fox-owned station KTTV, home of "America's Most Wanted," "A 
Current Affair" and "The Reporters," agreed. "They (advertisers) will try any 
trick they can," said McGowan. Nathanson added that networks that don't feature 
one of the highly rated tabloid shows have a vested interest in tarnishing the 
image of their competitors. 
</P>
<P>
The issue of advertiser rejection surfaced at the programmers' convention, the 
annual site where television syndicators market their wares. The reason: This 
year's new shows for syndication include 'Crime Diaries," "Crimestoppers 800," 
"The Investigators" and "Crimewatch" (which will appear on KCOP-Channel 13 if 
sold to enough other stations nationwide to get clearance) and the aptly titled 
"Tabloid" from Paramount Television. 
</P>
<P>
Companies refusing to buy time on most such programs include General Foods USA, 
McDonald's and Campbell's Soup Co., a client of BBDO/New York, which rejects 
tabloid TV for all of its clients. Others, including Kellogg's, are unlikely to 
advertise on shows dealing with the titillating topics currently in vogue on 
"Geraldo." 
</P>
<P>
At the convention, some syndicators reportedly expressed fears that there won't 
be enough advertiser support to get the new tabloid shows on the air. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really going to be a problem," said Larry Blasius, vice president and 
associate director of network programming for BBDO/New York. "I would think you 
couldn't put 13 of those shows on and expect them all to be gobbled up by 
advertising." 
</P>
<P>
But plenty of advertisers are still gobbling, said Michael Eigner, vice 
president and station manager of KTLA-TV Channel 5, which telecasts Rivera's 
occasional specials. "If anything, there's a premium on those shows," Eigner 
said. "There are certain clients that are prone to stay away, but there are 
others that will jump to them, because they don't mind the controversy and like 
the high ratings." 
</P>
<P>
The Wisconsin-based S. C. Johnson Co., for example, has no problem with tabloid 
TV, believing stations, not advertisers, should decide what is in good taste. 
Gus Priemer, an advertising consultant for the company, said S. C. Johnson 
purchased time on the recent NBC Rivera special on Satanism. 
</P>
<P>
Among Johnson's heavily advertised products are Glade air freshener and Raid 
and Off insect sprays -- and Priemer said killing bugs doesn't require the 
company to maintain a family image. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 5's Eigner acknowledges that certain tabloid shows present a public 
relations problem. "I think you have to get the advertisers to view a show, " 
he said. "Sometimes it's good to get the hosts of the shows in contact with the 
advertisers and see if their views change." 
</P>
<P>
KCOP president and general manager Bill Frank said that the station did not 
worry about purchasing the new "Crimewatch," because he expects advertisers 
will judge the show on its own merits. "It is more of a news show than a pure 
tabloid show," he said. While he acknowledged that some advertisers have shied 
away from "A Current Affair" and "Inside Edition," he believes they will give 
the new shows a chance. "I don't think they (advertisers) judge a show ahead of 
time unless the title is so outrageous that they might be scared," Frank said. 
</P>
<P>
The station managers pointed out that advertisers boycotting tabloid television 
are the same group that avoid any controversial show. "Kellogg's is advertising 
primarily to kids," said KTTV's Nathanson. "They would have a list (of shows to 
avoid) that would contain half the shows on television." 
</P>
<P>
Advertisers such as Kellogg's that steer clear of sex, violence and Geraldo 
also may avoid non-exploitative programs dealing with sensitive topics such as 
politics and religion. Paul Mulcahy, Campbell's Soup Co. vice president of 
advertising, said that the biggest negative viewer reaction the company ever 
got was when the company advertised during a CBS documentary on Central 
America. 
</P>
<P>
Mulcahy noted that popular taste determines what advertisers consider 
controversial. Daytime soaps, once considered too steamy for some advertisers, 
are now routinely accepted; with the advent of Geraldo and Morton Downey Jr., 
many consider Winfrey and Donahue tame offerings. 
</P>
<P>
Station managers concede that if the new tabloid shows become even more 
sensational, it could blight the reputation of existing shows -- such as it is. 
And KCBS' Gigliotti noted that advertisers could also begin to reject these 
programs because despite their high rating, tabloid shows tend to draw a 
downscale audience. Gigliotti said the ideal advertiser's show is still a 
program like "60 Minutes," which gets both high ratings and upscale viewers. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, said KTTV's Nathanson, "I wish all of our inventory was as 
easy to sell as 'A Current Affair' and 'The Reporters.' And if they gave me 
'Oprah Winfrey,' I'd be very happy to have it too."

SOVIET COMPOSERS UNION REINSTATES ROSTROPOVICH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Soviet Composers Union announced Wednesday that Mstislav Rostropovich, the 
expatriate Russian cellist and conductor of the National Symphony Orchestra in 
Washington, has been reinstated as a member of the union in what appeared to be 
a prelude to his full political rehabilitation and an invitation to return . 
</P>
<P>
Rostropovich is the latest in a series of distinguished Russian artists, 
writers, musicians and dancers who emigrated or were expelled from the country 
in the 1960s and 1970s and who are being rehabilitated and, in some cases, 
invited back. Rostropovich expressed doubt last year that he would be included. 
He could not be immediately reached for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Ballerina Natalia Makarova, who defected in 1970, returned to dance with the 
Kirov Ballet in Leningrad this month. Director Yuri Lyubimov has been invited 
back to Moscow's Taganka Theater, which he once headed. Rudolf Nureyev and 
Mikhail Baryshnikov have returned on family visits. Writer Andrei Sinyavsky 
returned for a visit last month in connection with the death of his friend Yuli 
Daniel. Poet Joseph Brodsky, another Nobel Prize winner, is published regularly 
here. 
</P>
<P>
In 1978, while in the United States on a concert tour, Rostropovich and his 
wife, Galina Vishnevskaya, the opera singer, were accused of "unpatriotic 
activities defaming the Soviet system" and "assisting subversive anti-Soviet 
centers," stripped of their Soviet citizenship, national awards and honorary 
titles and expelled from the composers union. Although world famous as a 
cellist, he quickly became a non-person here. 
</P>
<P>
His name was removed from musical manuscripts and books, from archival material 
at the Moscow Conservatory, where he taught, and Tchaikovsky Hall, where he 
performed. 
</P>
<P>
His principal crime, in the eyes of the Soviet leadership at the time, was his 
defense of Alexander I. Solzhenitsyn, the Russian novelist who won the Nobel 
Prize for Literature in 1970. Not only did Solzhenitsyn live in Rostropovich's 
country house, but Rostropovich spoke out forcefully against the government 
campaign that eventually led to the writer's expulsion from the Soviet Union in 
1974.

TRABUCO HILLS HAS THE TITLE TO ITSELF, 81-74

Rick Swanwick scored a career-high 31 points and grabbed 18 rebounds, and Chad 
Poulos added 23 points to help Trabuco Hills High School clinch its first 
Pacific Coast League boys' basketball championship with an 81-74 victory over 
Laguna Hills Wednesday at Trabuco Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Swanwick, who also blocked five shots, scored 16 of his points in the first 
half as Trabuco Hills (17-5 overall, 9-0 in the league) built a 48-34 halftime 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
Swanwick scored 13 points in the fourth quarter to hold off a late Laguna Hills 
rally. 
</P>
<P>
The loss left Laguna Hills (14-9, 6-3) tied for second place with Woodbridge 
with one game to play. 
</P>
<P>
"We took a couple of questionable shots at the end, and Laguna Hills came back 
with some three-point shots to close the gap," said Trabuco Hills Coach Rainer 
Wulf, whose team led by as much as 19 points twice in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Poulos, who made two three-point baskets in the first period, made one more 
with four minutes left in the second quarter to give Trabuco Hills a 36-21 
lead. Trabuco Hills led by as much as 16 points three times in the last minutes 
of the half before Chris Sheff made an inside jumper with three seconds left to 
narrow the Mustang lead to 48-34 as the halftime buzzer sounded. 
</P>
<P>
Sheff scored 11 of his 15 points in the first half. Beau Hossler, who scored 
nine points in the fourth quarter, wound up with 19 points to lead the Hawks. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach 56, Woodbridge 51 (OT) -- Woodbridge's Tom Shanklin hit a 
three-point shot with 7 seconds remaining in regulation to tie the score at 
44-44. In overtime, Dain Blanton and Pat Quigley each made four free throws as 
Laguna Beach outscored Woodbridge, 12-7. John Travino added 14 for Laguna Beach 
(9-13, 3-6). Woodbridge (8-11, 6-3) was led by Joey Cohen with 15 points. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa 65, Orange 56 -- Young Chang scored 20 points and Bret Dieball added 
18 to lead host Costa Mesa (4-17, 2-7). Rob Salinger led Orange (3-16, 1-8) 
with 12.

With the preliminary now out of the way, Sunny Hills High School can 
concentrate on its showdown against Fullerton for the Freeway League title 
after a 73-42 romp over visiting La Habra Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Sunny Hills (16-7 overall, 8-1 in league play) got into a championship mood in 
the fourth quarter, outscoring La Habra, 27-4, and served notice that it will 
be tough to beat at home Friday night against Fullerton (17-5, 9-0).

Forward Marcus Hopkins scored 10 of his game-high 20 points in the last 
quarter, including seven points in a 30-second span that gave Sunny Hills a 
59-40 lead. Teammate Walter Mitter put his own seal on the victory with a 
resounding dunk to give the Lancers a 66-40 lead with 1:49 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Sunny Hills made 10 of 20 shots in the last quarter, with a level of intensity 
that it had been lacking for three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to play that way for the entire ballgame against Fullerton," said 
Steve White, Sunny Hills coach. "Hustle will be the key on Friday night." 
</P>
<P>
La Habra (12-11, 5-4) went inside to take a 25-24 lead midway through the 
second quarter when guard John Roundy made a three-point shot. 
</P>
<P>
But Sunny Hills responded with nine unanswered points to gain a 33-25 halftime 
lead, and the momentum carried into the second half. 
</P>
<P>
The Highlanders are assured of their first playoff berth in five years, but 
second-year Coach Frank McCarroll wasn't completely satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
"One of our goals was to beat either Fullerton or Sunny Hills once, and we 
didn't," McCarroll said. "Our program still has a ways to go before we can 
compete with those guys."

EX-DEPUTY D.A. CAN'T TESTIFY, JUDGE RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SPANO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge Wednesday tentatively ruled that a retired Orange County deputy 
district attorney will not be allowed to testify about what he alleges was a 
pattern of improper pressure placed on local prosecutors by members of Sheriff 
Brad Gates' office. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Richard Gadbois announced that he felt the testimony would 
not be relevant to a lawsuit against Gates now being tried in Los Angeles. In 
that case, a private investigator is charging that members of Gates' office 
harassed him and orchestrated a criminal prosecution against him because he was 
a political opponent of the popular sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for private investigator Preston Guillory are also trying to show that 
Gates has improperly used his office to harass political foes. 
</P>
<P>
Gates' lawyers have flatly denied both claims, contending that two independent 
investigations concluded that Guillory was appropriately prosecuted for 
carrying a concealed weapon and impersonating a police officer. Guillory, 
however, was later acquitted of the charges. 
</P>
<P>
Guillory's cause appeared to receive an unexpected boost last year from Nick 
Novick, a now-retired county prosecutor who lost a bid in 1986 to unseat Dist. 
Atty. Cecil Hicks. 
</P>
<P>
But Gates' lawyers have also argued that Novick's allegations are irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
Novick, a deputy district attorney from 1970 to 1986, said in a sworn pretrial 
statement last year that Gates' assistants regularly sought, with improper 
motives, to launch or halt criminal prosecutions, according to documents 
contained in the court file. 
</P>
<P>
Novick mentioned several cases, including one that involved a drunk driving 
suspect who had displayed the identification of a deputy sheriff when arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Novick testified that the 1984 suspect, John Cuzzupoli, eventually told 
investigators that the identification card had been loaned to him by Sheriff's 
Deputy Richard Johnson. The two were best friends, and Cuzzupoli, who was under 
age, said he wanted to be able to buy drinks at a south county restaurant, 
according to Novick. 
</P>
<P>
Because he was in charge of the prosecutor's office in South Orange County 
Municipal Court, Novick decided to file charges against Cuzzupoli for drunk 
driving and illegal possession of the identification. 
</P>
<P>
In the deposition, Novick said he received a telephone call from Undersheriff 
Raul Ramos, Gates' top aide, requesting that the charge involving the 
identification not be filed. 
</P>
<P>
When Novick asked why, Ramos said that Johnson had been suspended and that he 
believed that was punishment enough, according to Novick. 
</P>
<P>
"I said it's going to be filed," Novick said in the deposition. 
</P>
<P>
"His (Ramos's) comment then was, 'Well, you know, we have an understanding with 
your office. If we want something filed or we don't want it filed, we have 
reasons for that. And when we make that request in your office, everybody goes 
along with it.' " 
</P>
<P>
"My reply," Novick testified, "was, 'Mr. Ramos, I'm in charge down here. I 
don't play the game that way. And this case, as far as I am concerned as long 
as I am the deputy D.A. in charge down here, is going to be filed.' " 
</P>
<P>
Novick said that was the end of the conversation, but he added that it was not 
the only time he had received what he considered to be an unusual request from 
members of the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
"My experience is, in prior instances and in instances subsequent to this in 
south Orange County, I had requests made of me to file or not to file certain 
cases by captains, lieutenants and other people in the sheriff's office where 
there was no reason why the case -- if the request was don't file it, there was 
no reason not to file it," Novick said. 
</P>
<P>
"If the request was (to) file it, there were all the reasons not to file it," 
Novick continued. "The requests by the sheriff's office were made on reasons 
other than the legalities and the facts of the case." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the Cuzzupoli case was assigned to the state attorney general's 
office for evaluation because the suspect's mother was an employee of the 
Orange County district attorney's office, Novick's employer. 
</P>
<P>
The outcome of the case, however, could not be immediately determined by The 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
Novick could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, one of Guillory's lawyers, Meir Westreich, suggested in court 
that his client's 1985 prosecution was motivated by a desire by sheriff's 
officials to force him to drop a different lawsuit against Gates. In that suit, 
Guillory had claimed that Gates denied his application for a permit to carry a 
concealed weapon because Guillory supported Gates' political opponents. The 
case, filed in 1978, remains pending.

GATES AIDE DEFENDS GUILLORY INQUIRY AS 'OBJECTIVE, CORRECT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County Sheriff-Coroner Brad Gates' top aide testified Wednesday that he 
ordered an "objective, careful and correct" investigation of actions of a 
private investigator in 1984 but also acknowledged that several aspects of the 
criminal inquiry were unprecedented. 
</P>
<P>
Undersheriff Raul Ramos, a 14-year veteran of the department, defended his 
central role in the 1984 criminal investigation of Preston Guillory, who claims 
that Gates' office sought his prosecution because he was working for Gates' 
political opponents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Suit Seeks $5 Million 
</P>
<P>
Ramos acknowledged that the investigation was inspired by, partly conducted by 
and then presented for prosecution by Sheriff's Department employees who were 
defendants in civil rights lawsuits initiated or supported by Guillory. 
</P>
<P>
Ramos' testimony came during the second day of trial in U.S. District Court in 
Los Angeles in Guillory's $5-million lawsuit against Gates and other officials, 
in which he alleges that they conspired to violate his rights of free speech 
and association. 
</P>
<P>
It is the first of several cases alleging misuse of office by Gates to reach 
trial. Gates' lawyers have flatly denied Guillory's claims. 
</P>
<P>
The suit stems from investigations by a special unit of the Sheriff's 
Department, and subsequently by Anaheim police, that led to Guillory being 
charged in 1985 with illegally carrying a firearm, impersonating an officer and 
seven other offenses. Guillory was acquitted of all the charges in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of Gates' investigation, Guillory had sued the sheriff in federal 
court in a civil rights case then pending and was working for three other 
political rivals of Gates who also had sued the sheriff for alleged political 
harassment and spying. 
</P>
<P>
The county agreed to pay $375,000 to the three rivals, including former Orange 
County Municipal Judge Bobby D. Youngblood, to settle their harassment lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Ramos told jurors that his office, aware of the "sensitivity" of 
Guillory's position as an open foe of Gates, took steps to avoid any conflicts 
in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
But Ramos also testified that Gates' order directing him to personally deliver 
the completed criminal file to the Anaheim police chief for possible 
prosecution was unprecedented. 
</P>
<P>
Asked by Guillory's lawyer, Meir Westreich, if the order was unusual, Ramos 
responded: "It was different." 
</P>
<P>
Westreich pressed, asking if Ramos had ever received such an order. 
</P>
<P>
"No," Ramos replied. "I have never done that before." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout, Ramos, asked to recall a series of meetings and conversations from 
late 1984 and early 1985, said he had a hazy recollection of events. 
</P>
<P>
The criminal allegations against Guillory grew out of his work in trying to 
locate Richard Wilder, an informant for the Sheriff's Department intelligence 
division who was yet another defendant in the Youngblood case. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation of Guillory's tactics was launched by the intelligence 
division, an elite unit that reports directly to Gates, Ramos testified. The 
investigation was first proposed by Randy Blair, an investigator with the unit 
who also was a defendant in the Youngblood lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
In questioning, Westreich suggested that it was improper to allow Blair to 
conduct a criminal investigation of Guillory while Blair was a defendant who 
was being investigated by Guillory in the Youngblood case. 
</P>
<P>
Ramos testified that Blair was taken off the case. Asked why, Ramos responded: 
</P>
<P>
"Because Randy Blair was a party to a lawsuit in which Mr. Guillory was also 
involved. I was concerned that we'd probably end up in court like we are now. 
That's why we went to (another) investigator." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ramos Also a Defendant 
</P>
<P>
Westreich then pointed out that Ramos himself was a defendant in the Youngblood 
lawsuit. If Blair was removed from the investigation, why not Ramos himself, 
Westreich asked. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't going to be involved in the investigation as such," Ramos responded. 
"I was merely giving general supervision to the process." 
</P>
<P>
Ramos also acknowledged that the Guillory inquiry was not routed through 
"normal channels," such as the 80-member detective squad. The reason, he said, 
was that the investigation was "sensitive." 
</P>
<P>
"We considered this to be a sensitive investigation in that Mr. Guillory has a 
high profile in the press and because of his involvement with our department," 
Ramos said. 
</P>
<P>
Pressed to elaborate on what he meant by the word "sensitive," Ramos responded: 
"Just that. It was Mr. Guillory. He always attracts a lot of media attention." 
</P>
<P>
The investigator chosen to replace Blair was in the same intelligence division 
but was not a party to any of the Youngblood/Guillory lawsuits, Ramos said. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him to be objective, careful, and to do his work correctly," Ramos 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Recalling his dealings with Gates during the investigation, Ramos said he 
talked frequently with his boss about the case. But Ramos testified that he 
could remember few details. 
</P>
<P>
Ramos said he told Gates about the initial allegations against Guillory. "I 
told (Gates) the information that had been conveyed," he testified. "I think 
his only instructions as I can recall now, were to call (then-Anaheim Police 
Chief Jimmie) Kennedy." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Can't Recall Exact Words' 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Gates ordered a further inquiry, Ramos said: "I can't recall the 
exact words, but we discussed it. That's all I can tell you at this point." 
</P>
<P>
Westreich hit hard at Ramos' memory lapses, leading U.S. District Judge Richard 
A. Gadbois to caution the lawyer. "Let's get on with this instead of trying to 
badger this gentleman," Gadbois said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to do my best, your honor," Westreich responded. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, you're not trying hard enough," Gadbois shot back. 
</P>
<P>
In settling the Youngblood case in 1987, Gates' office continued to deny claims 
of harassment and illegal spying, despite paying a large sum to end the case. 
The settlement followed disclosure that a tape recording of one of Gates' 
political rivals had been found in files maintained by the Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Youngblood, Guillory, nor other challengers have dented Gates' 
perennial popularity at the polls. The four-term sheriff last won reelection in 
1986, when he beat the total votes garnered by two challengers by 100,000 
votes. 
</P>
<P>
One challenger, George Wright, a community college professor, testified briefly 
Wednesday that he ran unsuccessfully against Gates in 1978, then considered 
another try in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"Shortly after expressing an interest in the campaign, I was standing in my 
back yard and a guy took a shot at me over the fence," Wright testified. At 
that point, Wright said, he decided not to run again. 
</P>
<P>
Wright was not asked to elaborate. Gates' attorney, Eric Dobberteen, could not 
be reached for comment late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Gates is expected to follow Ramos on the witness stand Thursday.

TEACHER DIES AFTER BIKE ACCIDENT

<P>
A Fullerton College art professor suffered fatal head injuries when he was 
struck by a car as he rode his bicycle to work early Wednesday, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Don Hendricks, 41, an artist who had taught at the college since 1975 and 
served for 3 years as Brea's artist in residence, was hit at 6:51 a.m. a few 
blocks from the campus, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Hendricks was pronounced dead Wednesday evening at UCI Medical Center in 
Orange, where he had been on life support systems, a spokesman for the 
coroner's office said. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton Police Officer Laura Rivera said that Hendricks was riding north on 
Lemon Street when he was hit by a car going east on Chapman Avenue. The driver, 
a 21-year-old Buena Park man, was not arrested or cited, but the accident was 
still under investigation, Rivera said, and police are seeking more witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Hendricks suffered severe head injuries, a broken left collarbone and a broken 
right leg, Rivera said. 
</P>
<P>
Students and colleagues on Wednesday described Hendricks as a popular teacher 
and an outdoorsman who surfed with his children, swam laps in the Fullerton 
College pool and rode his bike to work every day. 
</P>
<P>
Kate Johnson, an art instructor who attended Orange High School with Hendricks 
in the late 1960s and shared an office with him at the college, said he had a 
tremendous following among art students. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people came here just to take him," Johnson said. "He was a real 
strong family man. He always had time to talk." 
</P>
<P>
Hendricks and his wife had been married for 21 years and had four children; 
Scott, an art student at Cal State Fullerton; Christina, a student at Brigham 
Young University in Utah; Tim, 12, and Courtney, 9. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly Wine, an art student who had taken several courses under Hendricks, said 
that he regularly showed Hendricks his latest artwork and was particularly 
proud to have some of his works on display with Hendricks' paintings at recent 
art shows. 
</P>
<P>
"He could see things in students as artists and he would guide them and 
encourage them," Wine said. "His opinion of my artwork was very valuable. I was 
going to show him one of my new works when I heard" of the accident, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Hendricks specialized in watercolors and he often focused on landscapes around 
Orange County, his colleagues said. They added that Hendricks loved to paint 
outdoors, rather than from photographs. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a very prolific young painter," said Larry Friedrich, chairman of 
Fullerton College's art department. "He was a very competent, capable artist, 
and a very good instructor." 
</P>
<P>
Hendricks' works were displayed in art shows across the nation and in 
Switzerland, a Fullerton College spokesman said. He had a number of exhibits in 
Orange County galleries in the past few years and one local gallery, Art Angles 
in Orange, was preparing an art show with Hendricks' works that was to open 
Feb. 23. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Great Stature' 
</P>
<P>
Mel Schusterman, owner of the gallery that was to display more than 30 of 
Hendricks' paintings, said he had "great stature" in the Southern California 
cultural community and was widely respected by his peers. 
</P>
<P>
"He was an exceptional example of an artist turning away from Modernism to 
portray natural things," Schusterman said, adding that the show has been 
postponed but that the gallery may hold a memorial exhibit soon. 
</P>
<P>
Hendricks, a lifelong Orange County resident who was raised in the Silverado 
Canyon area, was graduated from Cal State Fullerton in 1971 with a bachelor's 
degree in art. He received his master of arts degree in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
He has taught at Cal State Fullerton, Santa Ana College (now Rancho Santiago 
College), the Hollywood Arts School and Park View School in Huntington Beach, a 
Fullerton College spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Hendricks received the California Arts Council's artist-in-residence grants for 
3 consecutive years beginning in 1981 and served as the city of Brea's artist 
in residence during that time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gave Free Demonstrations 
</P>
<P>
Kathie Conrey of the Brea community services department said that Hendricks 
held free demonstrations of watercolor painting at the city's Civic Cultural 
Center and at local schools. He often worked with children on exhibits and 
received "stacks" of letters from youngsters thanking him, she added. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a wonderful gift of communication and a wonderful sense of humor," 
Conrey said. 
</P>
<P>
Friends said that Hendricks was active in the Mormon Church and planned to 
spend the 1989-1990 school year teaching at Brigham Young University. Johnson, 
his colleague, said that he may have wanted to teach there permanently. 
</P>
<P>
About four or five of Hendricks friends from the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints in Fullerton gathered in the waiting room Wednesday morning 
to wait for reports on his condition. 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Terry, was busy making phone calls and trying to reach their daughter 
Christina. 
</P>
<P>
"He was just a good friend of mine," said Michael Lowe, a 20-year friend of 
Hendricks. "He was just one of those special people who did those things well. 
I guess he just loved the grace in life, the pretty things." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton police ask that any witnesses to the accident contact investigator 
Tak Kim at (714) 738-6813.

HOMES IMPERIL LAGUNA KNOLL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
For generations of residents, the highest knoll overlooking Laguna Beach has 
offered breathtaking views of the city below, the Saddleback Valley and 
mountains, and the sunset behind Santa Catalina Island. 
</P>
<P>
But that may change. 
</P>
<P>
If development plans proceed, a 7-acre mound of the highest peak in Laguna will 
be flattened to make way for houses. 
</P>
<P>
The knoll, 1,031 feet above sea level, is scheduled for grading within the next 
2 months to make room for 36 tract homes planned by M.J. Brock &amp; Sons Inc. 
The Laguna Hills company bought the land in 1987 for $3 million from the Laguna 
Beach Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
Although plans for grading and construction have been approved by the City 
Council, the Planning Commission and the California Coastal Commission, nearby 
residents are putting up a fight. 
</P>
<P>
"My kids used to play up there," said Tallie Parrish, who spent 20 years 
raising her three children in the area. "They made roads for their little 
Matchbox toys and then when it rained, they went up there and rolled in the 
mud. It was great fun for them. For everyone." 
</P>
<P>
Said Carolyn Wood, who has lived a few blocks from the knoll for 22 years: 
"Losing the knoll means losing the spirit of Laguna Beach. It's one of the main 
attributes that makes Laguna Beach and living up here special." 
</P>
<P>
The knoll sits above the Top of the World neighborhood and the larger 
development of Laguna Heights, and is encircled by Alta Laguna Boulevard and 
Tyrol Drive. The mound is dotted with jagged rocks and small craters created by 
years of erosion. 
</P>
<P>
About two dozen residents who oppose the grading formed the Top of Laguna 
Conservancy -- also known as TLC for the Environment -- last December in an 
effort to save the knoll. The group has already filed two lawsuits challenging 
the Coastal Commission's approval of a tract map for the site and is 
considering a suit to overturn the City Council's approval, spokesman Wayne 
Ybarra said. 
</P>
<P>
With support from several environmental organizations in the city such as the 
Laguna Greenbelt, the Laguna Canyon Conservancy and Village Laguna, the 
</P>
<P>
group hopes to stall the grading process and persuade the developer to consider 
alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to get a better project for the land," Ybarra said. "Less grading 
-- to the extent of preserving the knoll -- fewer home sites and custom homes. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue of the knoll is more than just a neighborhood issue, it's citywide; 
lots of people in the city use the knoll and the property around it," he said. 
Nearly 25,000 people live in the city. 
</P>
<P>
The school district sold the property to raise money to renovate its four 
schools, Supt. Dennis M. Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said that to make up for a revenue decline caused by a drop in school 
enrollment, the district decided in 1981 to sell 20 acres of land that includes 
the knoll. The district drafted a tentative tract map that called for 
dedicating 13 acres to the city for a public park and subdividing the remaining 
7 acres into 36 home sites. The plan was approved by the city's Planning 
Commission in 1985, and M.J. Brock bought the land in 1987. The City Council 
added its final approval of the plan last November. 
</P>
<P>
Only late last year did residents realize that the knoll would be lost, Ybarra 
said, when the developer told the council how much grading would be necessary 
and that the dirt would be spread near the rim of a nearby canyon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Flat as a Pancake' 
</P>
<P>
"At the time the city was first reviewing the tract map there was not an 
awareness by people of the damage to the knoll," he said. "We thought the 
houses would be built around the knoll, but to chop it off and make it as flat 
as a pancake, we didn't know that." 
</P>
<P>
Some residents argue that dumping the leftover soil in the canyon will destroy 
its natural state. But City Manager Kenneth C. Frank said the canyon slope will 
be reshaped and replanted. 
</P>
<P>
Les Thomas, a division manager for M.J. Brock, said that after the knoll is 
graded it will stand at 1,013 above sea level and about 20 feet above Alta 
Laguna Boulevard. Thomas said the company is also planning to erect an 
"alternative knoll" in the city's designated park site to try to maintain part 
of the view. The new area will continue to be the highest point in the city, at 
1,015 feet above sea level. 
</P>
<P>
"At this juncture, the (housing development) project has been approved for a 
few years now," Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand that residents in the area have disagreements about the property 
and we're trying to work with their suggestions," Thomas said. "But the 
construction for the houses will begin," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ybarra said TLC members would be willing to talk with M.J. Brock officials 
about ways to improve the existing development plan. "There's room for 
improvement and working together," he said. "Any minor change could help the 
knoll and the area for the better." 
</P>
<P>
One of the group's plans is to have custom homes built on the land -- instead 
of tract homes -- so the city can retain its unique architecture and style. 
"Tract homes would rob the city of its character," he said. "If anything, leave 
us with that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prices Still to Be Set 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said M.J. Brock officials plan to integrate some custom homes into the 
development, but are uncertain if all 36 homes will be custom built. He said 
sales prices are yet to be determined, and he declined to estimate what a 
typical house would cost. The company has not received approval for its housing 
designs from the city's design review board and will not begin construction 
until approval is received, he said. However, he added that the plans for 
construction and grading are final. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Robert F. Gentry said that council members wanted to preserve the open 
space but decided that development of the knoll was necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"The sale had to go through for the school district to improve its schools," 
Gentry said. "We have to think of the students as well as the land."

SCHOOL TO SURVEY PARENTS ABOUT EDUCATION ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Ana Unified School District will poll 2,700 households in the city 
within 2 weeks to find out how parents stand on topics related to the education 
of their children, school officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Vergil Hettick the district's director of research and evaluation, said letters 
informing residents of the survey will be mailed within a week to 3,500 
randomly selected households. 
</P>
<P>
Later, more than 100 paid, trained bilingual assistants will telephone 2,700 
households and record answers to 38 questions on issues ranging from the 
quality of education -- and ways to improve it -- to campus safety and 
cleanliness. 
</P>
<P>
The survey is one of six that will soon be distributed at a total cost of 
$20,000. Each of the surveys asks different questions, based on the respondents 
targeted -- administrators, students, teachers, parents, district staff and 
members of the business community. 
</P>
<P>
Hettick said that 80% of those polled will be Latinos because "the proportion 
of the people we're polling is directly related to the percentage of that 
ethnic group in the school community, he said." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Serpe, director of the Social Science Research Center at Cal State 
Fullerton, designed the questions and will analyze the answers under a 
consulting contract with the school district, Hettick said. 
</P>
<P>
Survey results will be presented to the school board at its April 11 meeting.

A TOAST TO SCIENTIST'S TENACITY; 
</P>
<P>
UCI FETES JAPAN PRIZE WINNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
F. Sherwood Rowland, the UC Irvine chemistry professor who was awarded the 
prestigious Japan Prize on Wednesday, was late for a campus reception in his 
honor. He was teaching his morning atmospheric chemistry class. 
</P>
<P>
Rowland, a tenacious researcher who discovered that substances found in aerosol 
sprays, air-conditioning systems and cleaning solvents are destroying the 
Earth's ozone shield, explained that it was "class as usual." 
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Jack Peltason was considerably more effusive. The award, which 
recognizes scientific and technological achievements that contribute to world 
peace, is accompanied by a cash prize of 50 million yen -- about $387,600 at 
current exchange rates. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole world is cheering him," Peltason said in a champagne toast 
Wednesday. "He didn't just do the work in the laboratory, but he realized the 
consequences of his discovery and at great personal risk . . . spread the word 
to Congress and around the world." 
</P>
<P>
The world recognition is long-awaited vindication for the 62-year-old scientist 
who was derided as a crackpot and a publicity hound for years after his 1974 
discovery with postdoctoral researcher Mario Molina. Rowland's research and 
warnings resulted in a 1978 U.S. congressional ban on chlorofluorocarbons, or 
CFCs, in aerosol sprays and the 1987 Montreal Protocol, an international plan 
to control the compounds. 
</P>
<P>
The ozone layer is a band of gas that protects animals and plants from the 
sun's ultraviolet rays. Depletion of the ozone is expected to lead to higher 
skin cancer rates and potentially disastrous climatic changes. 
</P>
<P>
The extent of damage from existing CFCs won't be known until the next century, 
but Rowland said there has been significant progress to find chemical 
substitutes for CFCs. Japan's largest manufacturer of CFCs, the Asahi Chemical 
Co., announced earlier this week that it has developed a replacement compound, 
Rowland said. The firm contends that the new compound will do much less damage 
to the ozone. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem on a global basis now has a life of its own," he said. "Solutions 
are being sought by many governments and the United Nations, and changes are 
being made. . . . The direction in which things are looking is (toward) a 
(worldwide) ban within 15 years." 
</P>
<P>
Harold Moore, UCI's dean of physical sciences and a longtime friend, described 
Rowland as an extraordinary and committed scientist for whom "it would have 
been out of character" not to persevere despite opposition to his findings. 
</P>
<P>
"Sherry's contribution to environmental sciences is unparalleled. There hasn't 
been anything else that has touched everything and everyone so profoundly," 
Moore said Wednesday. He ranked the Japan Prize, the Nobel Prize and the Welch 
Award, presented by the Welch Foundation in Texas, as the top three honors in 
science. 
</P>
<P>
The challenge of the future, Moore said, will be preventing new ozone damage 
around the world. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly it's a proud moment for the university and for Sherry," Moore said of 
Rowland at the reception. "It's also a sad moment for all the rest of us, 
because what Sherry is being recognized for is the depletion of the ozone 
layer. It is time for the world to wake up and recognize the significance of 
what it has done." 
</P>
<P>
The Science and Technology Foundation of Japan, which awards two Japan Prizes 
each year, also honored Harvard University professor E.J. Corey for his work in 
the field of medicine. Corey was named a recipient of the Japan Award for his 
40 years of research in organic chemistry, particularly in human cellular 
immune functions. He also receives a prize of 50 million yen.

FREEWAY EXTENSION COST PUT AT $1 BILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, Times Urban Affairs Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new engineering study concludes that extending the Orange Freeway along the 
Santa Ana River from Orange to Costa Mesa would cost $1 billion and that time 
is short because the Army Corps of Engineers plans to widen the river in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
The latest study also determined that the $1-billion Santa Ana River flood 
control project and proposed freeway extension are physically compatible. The 
previous studies did not address the compatibility issue and estimated the 
freeway extension's cost at $810 million. 
</P>
<P>
"We figured that it doesn't pay to go any further with the freeway extension 
concept unless we know that the two projects are feasible together," said Kia 
Mortasavi, project development director at the Orange County Transportation 
Commission, which funded the $40,000 study. 
</P>
<P>
But the new study also cautions that coordination of the two projects is under 
severe time constraints because several years of design and environmental 
studies are needed for the freeway widening, and the Army Corps of Engineers 
does not want to delay the river widening. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Road Straddling River 
</P>
<P>
Conducted by Newport Beach-based Robert Bein, William Frost &amp; Associates, 
the study recommends a design that would depress the freeway extension below 
grade in places where that would minimize its effect on nearby residents but 
would elevate it in other places. The study also recommends placing the 
northbound lanes on the east side of the river and the southbound lanes on the 
west. Alternatives such as an arterial highway built on top of a levee, an 
elevated, bridgelike expressway and a dry-weather roadway on the river bottom 
were also considered. 
</P>
<P>
The study notes that a bikeway and an equestrian trail are on the river levees, 
and concludes that, while the freeway extension would not eliminate them, "it 
has to be recognized their setting will be affected." 
</P>
<P>
Currently there is no money for the proposed freeway extension, even though 
transportation officials say it is essential to relieve north-south traffic 
congestion in the county. County officials are planning to ask voters to 
approve a half-cent sales tax increase to help fund such projects, although no 
election date has been set. They are also hoping that state highway funding 
will increase through an increase in the state gasoline tax or other statewide 
revenue measures, including bond sales. 
</P>
<P>
Also, freeway planners have not yet worked out how to merge the proposed 
extension with the San Diego Freeway without dumping too much new traffic on 
that already-congested freeway.

PANEL SAYS DISTRICT ERRED IN DISMISSING TEACHER IN SEX CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA NEWMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A state Commission on Professional Competency has ruled that the Fullerton 
School District was wrong in firing an eighth-grade teacher because his two 
arrests for lewd conduct "caused a storm of publicity." 
</P>
<P>
King Steadman, a social studies teacher at D. Russell Parks Junior High, was 
suspended for 6 months, then reinstated in March, 1988, after his arrest on 
suspicion of lewd conduct and indecent exposure at an erotic bookstore in 
Fontana in the fall of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
However, the school board decided to dismiss him in September after a public 
outcry from parents who packed a board meeting, demanding to know why he had 
been allowed to return to the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
Steadman appealed his dismissal to the commission, and now the district 
trustees have 30 days to decide whether they will appeal the decision to the 
Orange County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Classroom Effectiveness 
</P>
<P>
In its decision forwarded to the district earlier this week, the three-member 
commission said the district had also failed to show that Steadman's 
"misconduct, whether characterized as immoral conduct or evident unfitness for 
service . . . has impaired (his) ability to function effectively as a classroom 
teacher." 
</P>
<P>
Steadman, 45, is on an unpaid leave. He could not be reached for comment. His 
attorney, Marianne Reinhold, did not return telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton School District Supt. Duncan Johnson expressed disappointment over 
the decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't agree with that, but that's what the decision says," Johnson said. 
"The district's position is that notoriety has changed the position of Mr. 
Steadman and that's why we moved to dismiss him." 
</P>
<P>
Trustee Irene Armstrong on Wednesday did not want to discuss whether the board 
erred in basing its dismissal of Steadman on publicity prompted by his arrests. 
</P>
<P>
"My thoughts are: Now, what are our alternatives; what are our choices," 
Armstrong said. "I have thought about this so much in the past, and now it's 
time to look forward (to) what we will do." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pleaded No Contest 
</P>
<P>
After his arrest in Fontana, Steadman pleaded no contest to the lewd conduct 
charge. He was sentenced to serve 1 day in jail and was given two years' 
probation. School district officials suspended him for 6 months but never 
disclosed the matter publicly and explained his suspension to a PTA official 
only as a "morals problem." 
</P>
<P>
He was reinstated at the end of the 6 months. But the public outcry -- and 
subsequent publicity -- arose when it was learned that Steadman had an earlier 
arrest on suspicion of lewd conduct in the men's restroom of Hillcrest Park in 
Fullerton in 1981. That charge was dropped after Steadman pleaded guilty to 
disturbing the peace. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, the school board refused to discuss the grounds for the 
dismissal. But those reasons came out during the commission's public hearings 
in November and December, when the district presented an "expert" who talked 
about the influence of the publicity on Steadman's ability to teach. 
</P>
<P>
In those hearings, Steadman attempted to show that he was an alcoholic and 
under the influence of alcohol when he was arrested in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
But the commission said that the district's argument that Steadman's conduct 
had "caused a storm of publicity which has destroyed his credibility with 
students and parents" was not just cause for firing him. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Founded 'on Speculation' 
</P>
<P>
Testimony on the effects of the publicity, the commission stated, "is founded 
entirely on speculation and cannot support a finding either one way or the 
other." 
</P>
<P>
The commission also rejected Steadman's contention that he is an alcoholic. 
"His employment record over the years has been good," the commission stated. 
"He has enjoyed good performance evaluations as a teacher. There is no record 
of chronic absenteeism or of signs of alcoholic withdrawal." 
</P>
<P>
Trustee Fred Mason said the commission's finding mirrored his own reasoning in 
casting the only vote against firing Steadman in September. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to say I told you so, but I felt that's what the appropriate 
position was from the start (to not fire him)," Mason said. "The only 
difference in the situation in March (when Steadman was reinstated) and the 
situation in September was the adverse publicity in the newspapers and the 
public outcry. And I didn't feel that was sufficient reason for the dismissal. 
But I was standing alone.

<P>
Claims Media Pressure 
</P>
<P>
"It was like saying the newspapers didn't like what we did, so let's change 
it," Mason said. 
</P>
<P>
California law prohibits school districts from employing anyone convicted of a 
sex offense. But people who plead no contest, as Steadman did to the 1987 
charge, are not barred from school district activities. The lewd conduct charge 
against Steadman in the 1981 case was dropped after he pleaded guilty to 
disturbing the peace. 
</P>
<P>
Betsy Cheek, a former president of the D. Russell Parks Junior High Parent 
Teacher Assn., said the district has no one to blame but itself for the 
protracted legal battle. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my feeling that they never should have put him in the classroom in the 
first place after his second arrest," Cheek said. "Had they fired him then, it 
would have stopped. So they brought this on themselves. They used very poor 
judgment."

<P>
ANTEATERS SLOW THINGS DOWN TO GET THEIR OFFENSE GOING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
See Kevin and Rod run. See Kevin and Rod shoot. And once in a while, see Kevin 
or Rod pass. 
</P>
<P>
That's the way it used to be for UC Irvine guards Kevin Floyd and Rod Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
With acrobatic Kevin and sharp-shooting Rod running the show, the Anteaters 
planned to run up big scores and big victories this season. As it turned out, 
the scores weren't so big and the victories were far and few between. 
</P>
<P>
"We stopped playing stupid when we were down, 23-9, at Virginia," Coach Bill 
Mulligan said. Irvine fell to 2-7 after that defeat. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters slowed things down and then recently discovered an inside game. 
In the past two games -- impressive victories over Cal State Fullerton and 
then-16th-ranked Nevada Las Vegas -- center Mike Doktorczyk and power forward 
Ricky Butler have combined for 86 of Irvine's 176 points. 
</P>
<P>
In the 99-98 victory over the Rebels, Floyd and Palmer -- who are tied for the 
team lead in scoring average at 15.7 -- chipped in a total of 11 points. 
</P>
<P>
Scoring is one thing, but the switch in offensive emphasis is most evident when 
you look at who's shooting the ball these days: 
</P>
<P>
 -- In the first 17 games, Palmer attempted 261 field goals, an average of more 
than 15 per game. In the past two games, he has averaged less than five shots. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In the first 17, Floyd averaged 13 shots a game. In the past two, he has 
averaged eight. 
</P>
<P>
Mulligan doesn't care how the ball goes in the basket. He's a very democratic 
guy in that regard. Palmer was yanked from Saturday's game after he missed a 
breakaway dunk. ("I don't want guys doing that (dunking) . . . unless they make 
it, and then it's OK," Mulligan explained.) 
</P>
<P>
But he's part dictator, too, and he can read statistics. In Big West Conference 
games, Butler is shooting 58% from the floor, Doktorczyk 57%, Floyd 43% and 
Palmer 40%. 
</P>
<P>
Now the question: Do Palmer and Floyd, the two best athletes on the team, get 
to shoot anymore? 
</P>
<P>
"I think both of them want to win more than anything else," Mulligan said. 
"They're aware of the numbers. I think the emergence of Butler and Doktorczyk 
can only help them, though. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not telling anybody they can't shoot. But we're looking inside more now 
and if someone decides it's their night and goes goofy, I won't hesitate to go 
to (reserve guards) Justin Anderson or Brett Pagett." 
</P>
<P>
So much for a vote of confidence. But Palmer and Floyd are taking their new 
roles in stride . . . as long as Irvine is winning, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not frustrated," Palmer said. "I mean, I think about it sometimes when 
your guy can take you to the hole and we have to stop and run the offense. But 
I think we're playing better as a team because everyone's more involved now. 
</P>
<P>
"Early in the season, a lot of schools saw our guards were scoring a lot and 
they put their emphasis on stopping our outside game. My shooting percentage 
went down because I just forced up some bad shots. Now, with Ricky and Mike 
scoring so much, that should free things up on the perimeter. I might get six 
or seven less shots a game, but the ones I get will be open shots." 
</P>
<P>
Palmer usually finds his way to the bench -- and Mulligan's doghouse -- with a 
forced 20-foot airball. Floyd usually gets there through air travel -- one of 
his patented, coast-to-coast flying layups that ends in a charging call. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I have to discipline myself more now, but the temptations are there," 
Floyd said. "Right now, we're taking what they're giving. But if they start to 
double (cover) Ricky and Mike, that will free things up outside." 
</P>
<P>
So the Kevin and Rod Show might be off and running again. 
</P>
<P>
Like many coaches, Mulligan has had some trying times with his point guards 
over the years. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd's full-speed-ahead approach to the game -- he has to lead the league in 
offensive fouls -- has sent Mulligan into contortions of pain on the sidelines, 
but few players have tried to please more desperately than the 6-foot-5 senior 
who transferred from Georgetown. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd recently referred to himself as an on-the-court "extension of Coach 
Mulligan." 
</P>
<P>
Mulligan's typically warm response? 
</P>
<P>
"If I look like Mr. Turnover, now you know why." 
</P>
<P>
Floyd had 12 turnovers -- four of them on offensive player-control fouls -- 
against Las Vegas. But don't let Mulligan fool you. He likes Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
"He just gets overly excited and penetrates a little too much," Mulligan said. 
"He really doesn't mean to screw up." 
</P>
<P>
One week ago, Mulligan assessed his team's season and said, "I'm not going to 
let this thing destroy me." 
</P>
<P>
Two victories later, the Anteaters are 5-5 in the Big West and happy to be 
alive. They've already played Las Vegas twice and have only two road games 
left, one of which is at 1-9 University of the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Mulligan admits the conference record isn't too bad, but he's not operating 
under any false sense of security. 
</P>
<P>
"We beat Fullerton by four, Fresno by three, Pacific by two and Vegas by one," 
he said. "Of course we blew out San Jose State . . . by nine. 
</P>
<P>
"If we were snake-bitten, like (George) Raveling at USC, it could be a lot, lot 
worse." 
</P>
<P>
Anteater Notes 
</P>
<P>
Forward Jeff Herdman's five-for-seven three-point shooting against Nevada Las 
Vegas vaulted him into the No. 1 spot in the nation in three-point field goal 
percentage. Herdman, a sophomore from Mission Viejo, is shooting 60.4% and 
takes over the position occupied last week by teammate Mike Doktorczyk (58.8%), 
who dropped to No. 2. . . . Sophomore Ricky Butler was named the Big West 
Conference co-player of the week. Butler scored 48 points and grabbed 16 
rebounds in Irvine's victories over Fullerton and Las Vegas. Utah State's Dan 
Conway was the other honoree. He scored 47 points and had 16 rebounds in two 
games. . . . Bob Olson, Irvine's sports information director, attended a game 
without a sport coat and tie for the first time in his seven years at Irvine 
last Thursday and the Anteaters won at Fullerton. It was shirt-and-sweater time 
for the Rebel upset, too. Said Mulligan: "If I ever see him in a tie again, 
I'll cut it off." 
</P>
<P>
Former Irvine star Wayne Engelstad was on hand for the upset of Las Vegas 
before heading to Rome, where he'll play in an Italian pro league. Engelstad 
had been playing for Albany of the Continental Basketball Assn. He was cut by 
the Denver Nuggets earlier in the season. "The CBA salary is $2,000 a month," 
Mulligan said. "Rome offered him $40,000 for the last three months of the 
season." . . . Reserve guard Brett Pagett had two points in Irvine's first 18 
games. Against Las Vegas, he banked in a leaping 19-footer -- a straightaway, 
"missed-it-by-so-much-you-made-it" shot -- at the buzzer before halftime to 
double the total. "Pagett's shot beat 'em, you know," was one of the first 
things Mulligan said after the 99-98 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine's sailing team stretched its dinghy regatta victory streak to 23 by 
winning the Southern Series No. 1 races at Santa Barbara last weekend. Skipper 
Jon Pinckney and crew Mike Sturman won the 'A' Division and skipper Nick 
Scandone and crew Scott Munch finished second in the 'B' Division. Irvine 
hasn't lost a dinghy regatta since 1987.

EASTERLY'S EVER-PRESENT WORK ETHIC AT KATELLA HELPS MAKE HER THE COUNTY'S TOP 
GIRLS' PLAYER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By now the doubts have been erased. Joni Easterly, a senior at Katella High 
School, has established herself as the top girls' basketball player in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Easterly, a 5-foot-11 guard, has averaged 22 points and 10 rebounds a game 
while leading the Knights to a 21-3 record and a No. 3 ranking in the Orange 
County Sportswriters' Assn. poll. Katella is 9-0 in the Empire League. 
</P>
<P>
She has done it by being an intense, aggressive player, one of the strongest in 
the county. Easterly spends hours playing basketball whenever and wherever she 
can. She is a self-described gym rat, but doesn't confine herself to the 
indoors. Any old driveway with a hoop on the garage will do. 
</P>
<P>
As one coach observed this season: "She's one of those players who can do 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
It could be the way she assumes command during games, scoring basket after 
basket for the Knights. It could be the powerful manner in which she drives to 
the basket, leaving quick players looking slow. Or the way she pulls up for a 
soft jump shot with players draped all over her. 
</P>
<P>
Easterly exudes an unmistakable drive to excel on the court, and it has carried 
her far. 
</P>
<P>
It's that drive that led her to become the county's top player. Next season, it 
will lead her to USC, where she already has signed a letter of intent. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like there's this burning inside her to do more," Katella Coach Barb 
Bausch said. 
</P>
<P>
And that's why Easterly rarely misses a day of practice. Off-season, weekends, 
the day before a big playoff game, Easterly doesn't miss a chance to dribble or 
work on her jump shot. 
</P>
<P>
More than once Bausch has had to tell Easterly, who overdoes it occasionally, 
to cool it, to take a few days off. 
</P>
<P>
"She's the first player I've had to say, 'Hey, rest,' " Bausch said. "I tell 
her she has so many more games to play in her career and slowing down a little 
bit isn't going to hurt." 
</P>
<P>
The fact is Easterly has hurt herself trying to do too much. 
</P>
<P>
As a sophomore, she was playing one-on-one with a friend in a driveway a few 
days before a Southern Section 3-A playoff semifinal game. She twisted her 
ankle on the garage door. At least that's what she first thought. 
</P>
<P>
The ankle hurt, but she just had to play in that semifinal game. She did, and 
helped Katella into the championship game against Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
Her ankle hurt, but she still practiced all week in preparation for the big 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"How often do you get to play in the championship game?" Easterly said. 
</P>
<P>
She went out for pregame warmups at Cal Poly Pomona, but she was in agony. She 
thought the Katella trainer had taped her ankle too tightly. She started the 
game, but couldn't run down the floor more than once and had to come out. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't figure out what was wrong," Easterly said. "I said, 'Coach, I gotta 
play.' " 
</P>
<P>
At halftime, she tried to jog in the hallway, but was in such pain she fell. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, after Katella had lost by two points to Mission Viejo, Easterly 
had her leg X-rayed and learned she had broken a bone just above the ankle. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back, Easterly's only regret was that she couldn't play in the game and 
help her teammates. She said, under the same circumstances, she would still 
have practiced and played. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to play every day," she said. "because if I don't someone else is going 
to get better than me." 
</P>
<P>
It was with great reluctance that Easterly sat out last week's game against El 
Dorado. She has a strained rib muscle that bothers her each time she shoots or 
jumps for a ball. A combination of catching too many stray elbows in the ribs 
and overwork has caused the injury, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll just have to play sore," Easterly said. "I'll just be in pain the rest of 
the season." 
</P>
<P>
Playing until she dropped from exhaustion has been her method of operation 
since she first started playing in sixth grade in Sweet Home, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
The next year, her family moved to Dallas and Easterly really got hooked, 
playing nightly with a group of college students at a nearby gym. 
</P>
<P>
The next year, the family moved to Anaheim and Easterly attended South Middle 
School. There she averaged 32 points a game and began to attract attention. 
</P>
<P>
During a summer camp for in-coming freshmen, then-Katella Coach Mickey McAulay 
told Easterly she'd be playing on the varsity. 
</P>
<P>
Easterly was stunned. 
</P>
<P>
It was then she realized she had a special talent and was determined to see it 
through. 
</P>
<P>
"She still is going hard, still pushing," Bausch said. "She could have let up. 
But winning means a lot more than just getting a scholarship."

SURFING MAGAZINE MARKS ITS SILVER ANNIVERSARY WITH EMPHASIS ON BEACHWEAR 
INSTEAD OF BOARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA L. La GANGA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You would think that after 25 years in the Southern California sunshine, 
Surfing magazine would be all dried up. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, it has changed. It started in the early '60s with breathless stories 
about surfing awards banquets, progressed to a spiritualistic stream of 
consciousness in the '70s and turned to adolescence in the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
Bikinis and boards are smaller, readers are younger and the photography is 
glossier. Perhaps the biggest change, though, is in the abundant advertising 
and its focus on the billion-dollar surfwear industry. 
</P>
<P>
When the magazine started out, very few ads broke up the big blue waves on the 
magazine's pages, but as Surfing celebrates its 25th anniversary, the magazine 
flourishes with a lot of help from an industry that it helped to create -- 
beachwear. Today, surf publishing and apparel would drown if they had to paddle 
out into the business world separately. 
</P>
<P>
"Without them (surf magazines), we can't reach the consumer," said Jerry 
Crosby, executive vice president of marketing for Ocean Pacific Sunwear. 
"Without us (manufacturers), they may not be around. It is an informal 
co-dependency that we find ourselves in." 
</P>
<P>
The San Clemente magazine, founded by two surfers, marks its silver anniversary 
with a paid circulation of 114,000 in 50 states and 35 foreign countries -- 
more than five times its initial output in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
Lots of other differences exist, too. The magazine started out as International 
Surfing with only 68 pages. The "international" was dropped in 1968, and today 
Surfing averages 175 pages per month, said editor David Gilovich. 
</P>
<P>
Each issue generally sports more ad pages than the first issue had in total 
pages, and Surfing has apparel manufacturers to thank for that. While early 
issues boasted mostly surfboard ads, today beachwear advertising accounts for 
nearly 50% of Surfing's $3.25 million in ad revenues. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Surfing prints an annual "summer fashion preview," stuffed with 
clothing brands like Bad Dog, Billabong and Body Glove. The 1988 fashion issue 
ran 220 pages, a magazine that publisher Bob Mignogna contends was "the largest 
issue of a surf magazine in history." 
</P>
<P>
"In our first 15 years of publishing, the surfing industry in terms of dollars 
was very small," said Mignogna, who has been with Surfing for 15 years. "It 
started out as a cottage industry. Until about 1975, all the major companies 
were surfboard manufacturers." 
</P>
<P>
Today, between 300 and 400 apparel makers specialize in surf-flavored fashions, 
of which about 70 are in Orange County, the U.S. hub of surf manufacturing and 
publishing. 
</P>
<P>
Brad Bonhall, editor of Action Sports Retailer in South Laguna, estimates that 
$1.5 billion is spent in the United States each year on beachwear alone. And he 
says that few manufacturers can afford not to advertise in both Surfing and 
Surfer, a San Juan Capistrano competitor founded in 1960 that has a monthly 
paid circulation of 112,000. 
</P>
<P>
The circulation figures for Surfing and Surfer are healthy for a specialty 
publication, said Bilal Said, a publishing-industry analyst for S.G. Warburg 
&amp; Co. in New York. And what's more important, he says, is that an ad in 
Surfer or Surfing gets straight to the consumer core that apparel manufacturers 
want to reach. 
</P>
<P>
For while beachwear has appeal beyond the million or so U.S. surfers, Mignogna 
says, "the basic premise is that your product has to be worn by authentic 
surfers if it is going to be considered on the cutting edge." 
</P>
<P>
While the two magazines are equally important to manufacturers, they have 
vastly different images. 
</P>
<P>
Surfer is "the Bible" of surf publications, said Danny Kwock, marketing 
director for Quiksilver Inc. of Costa Mesa. "Surfing is the avant-garde, the 
hip, rock 'n' roll, on-the-edge publication." 
</P>
<P>
Who reads Surfing? Well, here's a clue from one letter to the editor out of La 
Jolla: 
</P>
<P>
"Now, the reason I am writing this letter is to let everyone know just what I 
think about life," writes Aaron Klein in Surfing's February edition. "Granted, 
at 17 years old, I may not know everything, but I have been surfing for 10 of 
those years so I think I know something about the life style." 
</P>
<P>
He goes on to catalogue what's hot and what's not in his own wet world. Hot: 
Surfing, skateboarding, snow boarding, jet skiing, bikini contests. Not: 
Offshore oil rigs, nuclear war, former President Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
Like Klein, the magazine's average reader falls within a very small sub-group 
of the world's population: He's a male, somewhere between 16 and 18 years old. 
He lives in a beach town, is just finishing high school or barely entering 
college. 
</P>
<P>
And that's what makes Surfing so valuable to the manufacturer of surf clothes, 
says Ocean Pacific's Crosby. 
</P>
<P>
"Our target audience is 12 to 24," Crosby says. "Surfing has less wasted 
distribution for us. Most people in our industry have a similar target audience 
if they really thought about it." 
</P>
<P>
But Surfing's reader wasn't always quite so young. When the magazine started 
demographic studies in 1976, it found its readers were 20 to 21 years old. For 
the next 10 years, Mignogna said, the readers got progressively younger, with 
more of them sporting orthodontia than using razors. 
</P>
<P>
It's not that the older readers surfed off into the sunset. There has just been 
a "huge increase" in the number of younger readers, Gilovich says. As a result, 
the magazine has pitched its pages a peg lower. 
</P>
<P>
In 1966, for example, the magazine published a paean to Duke Kahanamoku, the 
father of modern-day surfing who is credited with introducing the sport to 
California and Australia. Kahanamoku, the magazine gushed, "has done more for 
Hawaii than all the hula girls and Hawaiian Visitors Bureau posters combined." 
</P>
<P>
Fast-forward to 1973, when stream of consciousness hit the pages: " . . . There 
aren't any new surfers, the new faces are faceless, as you are paddling out 
again for your second wave, moving never fast enough against the lateral 
current along the white edge of the turned-over water scar, watching out to 
where the walls first show. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
And what does 1989 look like in comparison? The ads sport fresh-faced, tanned 
boys and girls. In the February issue, a feature called "Star Boards" asks 
champion surfers -- most of them very recent drivers -- about their favorite 
equipment. And "Getting a New Board Wired" tells board buyers to go slowly at 
first: 
</P>
<P>
"When you get a new board," the advice column cautions, "you're pumped and you 
expect it to go unreal. But if you take off on your first wave and try to pull 
15 off-the-lips, you're likely to get bummed out when you suddenly discover you 
can't." 
</P>
<P>
The competition, however, is not willing to concede the younger reader. Nor 
does Surfer magazine give Surfing much credit for, well, much of anything. 
Peter Holmes, Surfer's editor in chief, calls his magazine "a little more 
profound, in depth." 
</P>
<P>
"They (Surfing) tend toward the personality and making of stars, if you like," 
Holmes contends. "We're more concerned with the experience of surfing and so 
regard all surfers as equals in the water." 
</P>
<P>
But profundity does not ensure advertising. While Surfing boasted advertising 
revenue of $3.25 million in 1988, Surfer lagged a bit behind, with ad revenue 
of $3 million, Holmes said. 
</P>
<P>
Western Empire Publications became Surfing's fourth owner in 1979, Mignogna 
said. After 3 break-even years, the magazine and its parent company, which also 
publishes Body Boarding, have both been profitable. 
</P>
<P>
So the magazine is saying "thank you" to all those surfers who made it possible 
with three anniversary editions that dive to the heart of the surfing 
experience. "The Surfboard" has already floated by, but brace yourself for 
"Waves" in June and "Surfers" in November. 
</P>
<P>
Interspersed among those special editions are regular features like the summer 
swimsuit preview, an all-Hawaii issue and the annual pro surfing U.S.A. 
edition. 
</P>
<P>
So relax, and "imagine a wave," as Surfing's promotional literature coaxes. 
"No, a perfect wave . . . one of the world's best waves."

AST READY TO TAKE ON TANDY, IBM HOME PCS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID OLMOS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Making its first foray into the home computer market, Irvine-based AST Research 
Inc. has introduced a low-priced personal computer to compete against such 
well-known brands as Tandy Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. 
</P>
<P>
AST, which until now has designed and manufactured personal computers primarily 
for the business market, said its Bravo/286 will have a starting price tag of 
$1,095. Current AST models range in price from $1,500 to more than $11,000. 
</P>
<P>
"This is our attempt to show we can play hard ball and offer exciting 
technology . . . at a price that our reseller community has been asking us to 
do for a long time," Larry Fortmuller, AST's director of systems marketing, 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We expect this to be a hit seller," he added. 
</P>
<P>
And AST could use a hit. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Irvine firm reported an $8.9-million loss for the quarter ended 
Dec. 30. At the same time, AST laid off 70 Orange County workers and announced 
plans to slash 50 other jobs in the United States and overseas. 
</P>
<P>
In targeting the home market, AST is going after an area of business that for 
years failed to live up to the expectations of personal computer makers. In 
recent years, however, the home market has perked up due to the increasing use 
of computers by people who work part- or full-time at home. 
</P>
<P>
But AST's plans for the Bravo are not limited to the home. The company expects 
to sell the Bravo to business customers for use in applications, such as word 
processing, that do not require more expensive, high-powered machines, 
Fortmuller said. IBM has also gone after that piece of the market with the 
models 25 and 30 of its Personal System/2 line. 
</P>
<P>
"The gap I see (Bravo) filling is the need for a higher-powered machine serving 
the low end of the business market," said Bob Norton, general manager of a 
computer reseller chain that carries AST products. "That has generally not been 
available in the industry, although IBM did a neat job with the models 25 and 
30." 
</P>
<P>
AST's models are priced hundreds of dollars cheaper than the IBM models, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Fortmuller said AST was encouraged to develop a low-cost machine aimed at the 
home and business market by the ComputerLand retail chain and some of its other 
large customers. 
</P>
<P>
ComputerLand, the world's largest computer chain, is an especially important 
customer for AST. The Irvine firm received a major boost in June, 1988, when 
ComputerLand agreed to become an official dealer of AST products. 
</P>
<P>
Richard A. Schaffer, a New York computer analyst, said AST is moving into an 
"awfully crowded" field and questioned whether the market really needs such a 
machine. 
</P>
<P>
But Schaffer added: "I've bet against Safi (Qureshey, AST's president) in the 
past and ended up losing." 
</P>
<P>
AST said it expects the Bravo to compete not only against the likes of IBM and 
Tandy but also against low-cost IBM "clones" from Asian-based manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
To help drive down production costs of the Bravo, AST is manufacturing the 
machine at its Taiwan plant. 
</P>
<P>
AST said the Bravo is powered by Intel Corp.'s 80286 microprocessor. The 
machine comes in three models ranging in price from $1,095 to $2,095. AST said 
it has already begun shipping the product, which should begin appearing on 
store shelves soon.

Israel today demanded the removal of a Norwegian U.N. commander who compared 
the expulsion of 79 people from Israeli-controlled territory in south Lebanon 
to steps Nazis took in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Col. J. E. Karlsen, commander of the Norwegian battalion in the U.N. 
Interim Force in Lebanon made the comparison last week in a private meeting 
with Israeli officials. His remark was leaked to the press, and Israel's 
Foreign Ministry complained at the time. However, the ministry now wants him 
removed because he was quoted by a newspaper as saying his comparison succeeded 
in drawing attention to the expulsions, a ministry spokesman said.

Ronald H. Brown, preparing to take over as Democratic Party chairman, told 
party officials today that they face "tough adversaries" and must work to 
define party positions more forcefully on issues such as defense, crime and 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, who on Friday will become the first black to chair a major political 
party, told the Assn. of State Democratic Chairs, "I am going to be a 
common-sense, pragmatic chairman." He told the state party leaders, "We've got 
a difficult job ahead, we've got tough adversaries. . . .They don't care much 
about truth or about decency." 
</P>
<P>
Taking over amid concern about the erosion of the party's Southern base, Brown 
said, "I don't want to be chairman of a party that writes off any region of the 
country."

Michael J. Fox received 5,000 threatening letters from a woman who was upset he 
got married, a district attorney investigator said today. The woman suspected 
of writing the letters, Tina Marie Ledbetter, 26, was arrested in Westlake 
Village last week but was released after she posted $100,000 bail, investigator 
Gary Schram said. 
</P>
<P>
Fox, 27, who won two Emmys for his portrayal of the insufferable conservative 
son of liberal parents on the NBC series "Family Ties," married his former 
co-star on the show, actress Tracy Pollan, last July. Fox began receiving 
unsigned letters last February, said Al Albergate, spokesman for the Los 
Angeles County District Attorney's office. "The letters threatened the lives of 
Fox, his wife and their yet-to-be-born child," Albergate said.

A court today declared Warren Anderson, the former chairman of Union Carbide 
Corp., an "absconding offender" in an effort to extradite him from the United 
States to face charges in the Bhopal gas leak, the world's worst industrial 
disaster, in which more than 2,000 people died. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Judicial Magistrate R. C. Mishra issued a warrant last Nov. 15 for 
Anderson's arrest to answer homicide charges filed by the Indian government. 
Repeated summons have failed to bring Anderson to Bhopal, Indian government 
counsel U. S. Prasad told Mishra in requesting the former executive be declared 
an absconder. Mishra granted the request, which is designed to make it easier 
for the Indian government to initiate extradition proceedings. India and the 
United States do not have an extradition treaty, but individual extraditions 
are possible.

President Bush has ordered a 40-foot horseshoe pit installed near the tennis 
courts on the White House south grounds. Not one to sit in the Oval Office, 
Bush already has strolled down to inspect the work, which is being handled by a 
National Park Service crew, and an aide confirmed today that the pit will be a 
40-footer. The game of horseshoes apparently is one of the President's favorite 
forms of relaxation, and the aide said Bush also had a pit installed at Camp 
David.

A judge refused to reduce bail for a man charged with larceny and defrauding 
his wife and her family by impersonating an astronaut and using their credit 
cards without permission. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Hunt, 27, of suburban Medford was held on $100,000 surety or $10,000 
cash bail. 
</P>
<P>
His attorney, James Cipoletta, asked District Court Judge Frederick Doyle on 
Wednesday to reduce the bail to $1,000 cash but the district attorney told the 
judge he did not think Hunt would remain in the area if released on bail. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Hunt) is becoming increasingly disappointed," Cipoletta said. "He feels 
he's being unfairly accused of being a con man." 
</P>
<P>
Hunt was arrested after State Trooper Andrew Palombo began a private 
investigation into the case. Palombo heard about Hunt from a Saugus family who 
allegedly paid him $2,000 to get their son out of the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
"He had convinced an 18-year-old to enlist in the Navy, then he told the 
parents he could get the boy out of it for $2,000," Palombo said. 
</P>
<P>
The family allegedly gave Hunt a $2,000 check, which he said was no good and 
demanded cash, which they gave him. He then cashed the check as well, Palombo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
During the investigation, Palombo said he discovered Hunt had impersonated an 
array of people. During the last eight years he married at least four times and 
allegedly posed as a space shuttle astronaut, a baby powder manufacturer, a 
professional baseball player, a successful contractor, a Marine captain and jet 
pilot. 
</P>
<P>
Officials say he was none of those things. 
</P>
<P>
His wife of five months, Ann Sweeney, had believed him. However, she filed for 
divorce Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt's astronaut impersonation, complete with a NASA space suit and helmet, won 
the praise of the Lord Mayor of Dublin, who made Hunt an honorary citizen of 
Ireland during a visit. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt also dressed in full Marine colors and gave one of his wives a tour of the 
U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md., where he claimed to have graduated first 
in his class. 
</P>
<P>
On a flight to Montreal, Hunt was invited into the cockpit where he explained 
to the pilot how he landed the space shuttle Atlantis, Palombo said. 
</P>
<P>
After arresting Hunt, Palombo said he asked him one question on the way to the 
police station in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked him a question and he launched into a 15-minute soliloquy about 
corporate takeovers," Palombo said. "Finally I said, 'Cut the bull and admit 
you're not an astronaut.' " 
</P>
<P>
Hunt paused and said, "There's no law against pretending to be an astronaut."

NO CAPITAL GAINS CUT: ROSTENKOWSKI; 
</P>
<P>
WAYS AND MEANS CHAIRMAN ASKS 'REALISTIC' APPROACH

<P>
Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, 
today promised all-out opposition to President Bush's proposal to reduce the 
tax on capital gains. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not about to tell the wage earners in Chicago that they should pay a 
higher tax than stockbrokers," Rostenkowski said in a speech to the National 
Press Club. 
</P>
<P>
"I personally will strongly resist any efforts to undo (the 1986) tax reform, 
including the return to a preferential tax rate for capital gains," 
Rostenkowski said. 
</P>
<P>
He spoke eight hours before Bush was to deliver a package of budget 
recommendations that was expected to include a call for lower taxes on capital 
gains, which are profits from the sale of stocks, real estate and other assets. 
</P>
<P>
There is strong support in Congress, principally among Republicans but even 
among some Democratic liberals, for taxing capital gains at a lower rate than 
applies to wages and other income. Capital gains and most other income now are 
taxed at rates of either 15%, 28% or 33%. 
</P>
<P>
Seventy percent of capital gains are taken by people with incomes above 
$100,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski sounded another familiar theme at the press club: Despite Bush's 
campaign pledges, any realistic plan for reducing the budget deficit must 
include tax increases, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If President Bush is willing to put all spending and revenues on the table, he 
will find a Congress willing to make the tough choices that real deficit 
reduction requires," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The veteran lawmaker said that former President Ronald Reagan also made a 
no-tax pledge but that during his eight years in office, "Reagan raised more 
taxes than any peacetime President." Reagan signed more than a dozen tax 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski said the 1990 budget left by Reagan was based on highly optimistic 
projections on how the economy will perform. 
</P>
<P>
"Does anyone really believe that real growth will be 3.2% this year? Or 
inflation at 3.8%? Or short-term interest rates at 6.3%?" Rostenkowski asked. 
"Those are the numbers in the last Reagan budget. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope I don't see them in President Bush's budget. I don't want to raise 
taxes, but I won't participate in a sham."

Thursday's Child, a sloop on pace to smash the 135-year New York-San Francisco 
sailing record, entered Southern California waters today with not far to go. 
</P>
<P>
The modern three-man, 60-foot racing yacht was seeking to beat the record of 89 
days and eight hours for the 14,500-mile journey around treacherous Cape Horn 
at the tip of South America. Set in 1854 by the legendary three-masted clipper 
ship Flying Cloud, it is the oldest existing speed record. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's Child reached the latitude of San Diego early today and was on 
target to enter San Francisco's Golden Gate on Friday or early Saturday. The 
vessel left New York Nov. 23 and has only to reach San Francisco by 2 a.m. on 
Feb. 21 to break the record.

Republicans rallied today to defend Defense Secretary-designate John Tower, 
whose confirmation vote has been delayed while the FBI investigates allegations 
about his drinking and his financial ties with military contractors. 
</P>
<P>
"For those who have known him for a very long time, it's very significant that 
they have never seen him incapacitated, never seen him drunk," Sen. Pete Wilson 
(R-Calif.), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee that is considering 
the nomination, said on NBC's "Today" show.

'Flake Allegations'

<P>
"And indeed neither have all the waiters who have been interviewed in response 
to all of the many flake allegations that have been thrown in over the 
transom," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he has reviewed "as much of the FBI files as are available to date and 
there is nothing in there that in any way shakes my complete confidence that 
John Tower is the smart, tough secretary of defense that we need." 
</P>
<P>
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) said of the nomination on ABC's "Good 
Morning America" that "I don't think it's in a bit of trouble. I think that 
these rumors are going to be checked out, as they should be. They're going to 
be proved false and we'll confirm John Tower, hopefully in the next couple of 
weeks."

committee, have been that they have never seen John Tower impaired because of 
drinking. . . . They have never seen him drunk, they have never seen him unable 
to perform duty, never seen him fail to show up for an appointment," Sen. 
Malcolm Wallop (R-Wyo.) said on "CBS This Morning." 
</P>
<P>
The committee chairman, Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), said Wednesday after a meeting 
with White House counsel C. Boyden Gray that he still had "serious concerns" 
that would prevent him at this point from voting in favor of Tower's 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Charges 'Groundless' 
</P>
<P>
"Each of the charges that have been leveled against him and investigated 
subsequently have all proved groundless, baseless," Wallop said. 
</P>
<P>
But Sen. Timothy E. Wirth (D-Colo.), appearing with Wallop, noted that the 
White House asked that the vote be put off until the FBI completes its 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Wirth said that "to suggest that there are a whole lot of just silly 
accusations . . . simply is not the information that we're getting from the 
White House. . . . Clearly they must believe that there is something in these 
reports or they would not have asked us to put off the vote."

A YMCA should pay taxes because the doctors, lawyers and others who use the 
facility are not legitimate subjects of charity, a judge ruled. 
</P>
<P>
Allegheny County Judge Ralph Smith Jr. ruled Wednesday that the $7.5-million 
downtown YMCA does not meet the state's legal definition of a charity and is 
not entitled to a tax exemption as a charitable institution. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling could require it to pay more than $200,000 in property taxes a year. 
</P>
<P>
The YMCA said it will appeal. 
</P>
<P>
The YMCA does not have to serve the poor exclusively to be tax-exempt, said Bob 
Boisture, associate general counsel for the national YMCA in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Boisture said the Pittsburgh case isn't viewed as a "major trend-setting case 
around the country." 
</P>
<P>
"It's only one case," he said. But he added, "We're not going to lie down and 
play dead when we get a ruling that says a Y is taxable. We're going to appeal 
that and also go to the Legislature."

t Germany today announced a record trade surplus for 1988, but economists said 
the European Community is not likely to be pleased with the excess and 
predictions of future export growth. 
</P>
<P>
West Germany recorded a trade surplus of 128 billion marks ($69 billion) last 
year, versus the then-record of 117.7 billion marks ($63 billion) in 1987, the 
Federal Statistics Office reported. 
</P>
<P>
Economists estimate a surplus as high as 142 billion marks ($76 billion) this 
year. Exports should continue to boom, they said, although higher consumer 
taxes are expected to dampen economic growth to 2.5% from 3.4% in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"They're bound to complain," Richard Reid, international economist at London 
brokers Phillips &amp; Drew, said of the EC members. "West Germany's surplus 
with countries like France, Britain and Italy is increasing most rapidly." 
</P>
<P>
Bonn's bulging surpluses have provoked frequent criticism from Washington the 
last two years, but the emphasis is now shifting to EC countries -- who are 
buying more than half of the country's exports, economists said.

'LAWRENCE' STARS RECALL EPIC ADVENTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS BROWN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than a quarter century has elapsed since they acted in "Lawrence of 
Arabia," and their involvement in the epic saga ranged from nearly two years to 
a mere three days. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Peter O'Toole, Omar Sharif, Anthony Quinn and Jose Ferrer retain 
vivid personal memories of that experience, even as they share a collective 
admiration that nears reverence for the film's director, Sir David Lean. 
</P>
<P>
Peter O'Toole was cast as T. E. Lawrence when he was 28 years old. He did not 
complete the role until he was 30. 
</P>
<P>
"Truly, there were times late in filming in Spain when I thought the production 
would never end," O'Toole said during a phone conversation from London. 
</P>
<P>
But in the beginning, on the Jordanian desert, O'Toole was a young actor being 
handed the opportunity of a lifetime -- and eager to absorb a new culture. 
</P>
<P>
"There was the thrill of being on this remote desert where God was born," he 
said. "The Hebrew God, Islamic God and Christian God were all born in this 
same, superbly desolate place. Being there, one could understand why. The 
desert was furious, savage, beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
It was also exhausting, the locale for the film's most taxing scenes. O'Toole 
singled out the sequence in which Lawrence struggles to save a Bedouin youth 
from quicksand as his single most draining experience. 
</P>
<P>
How long did the sequence take? 
</P>
<P>
"A long time," he answered, and even as he spoke, his voice wearied. "A long, 
long, long time. We filmed it in real desert sandstorms when possible, and we 
created sandstorms with aircraft propellers when necessary. If I hadn't been 
holding that boy, he would have sunk." 
</P>
<P>
Through the seemingly endless months of filming, he was buoyed by his bond with 
Lean, though often there were times when O'Toole was unsure of what was going 
on behind his taciturn director's incandescent eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"I sometimes would begin to talk to David and feel as if I were talking to a 
statue," O'Toole said. "Other days, he would walk up to me and say, 'Pete, do 
you really think . . .,' and then he would walk away. And I never would learn 
what was on his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"He lived completely in his own world, inside his head. Eventually we developed 
a system where, if he was staring off into nowhere, I would ask, 'Vacant or 
pensive?' He would always reply, 'Vacant.' 
</P>
<P>
"But we didn't need to talk very much. We communicated by a kind of semaphore: 
higher, lower, louder, softer." 
</P>
<P>
For O'Toole, who at the time had appeared in only three movies, "Lawrence" 
provided a thorough course in film making. "I learned from David every day," he 
said. "Our relationship is still very much master-pupil." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Lean, the fledgling screen actor was exposed to a cast of 
international stars. "Making the film was like a bull fight," O'Toole said. "I 
felt like a toreador. I was in the ring, and every few minutes they opened the 
trap and out popped another bull: Jack Hawkins, Claude Rains, Alec Guinness, 
Jose Ferrer, Anthony Quinn, Arthur Kennedy, Anthony Quayle." 
</P>
<P>
From Jordan to Seville and Almeria in Spain ("That's where I felt the film 
would never end"), then to the deserts of Morocco. "It was invigorating to 
return to the desert," O'Toole said, as if that's where he felt closest to 
Lawrence, a character he meticulously researched -- and still does. 
</P>
<P>
"There are many, many T. E. Lawrences," he said, "but they can be grouped under 
two categories: the real man and the legend. The real man I think I know as 
well as anybody. I like to think that David's film provided the legend with its 
zenith." 
</P>
<P>
And his reaction to the film's current restoration? 
</P>
<P>
"It's about time! There were nearly 30 missing minutes. And they were strange 
choices to nip. Not complete scenes, but rather as if a rodent had been 
nibbling at it." 
</P>
<P>
As he looped this new print, he couldn't help but recall the first day of 
desert filming more than 28 years ago when David Lean told his his young 
charge, "This is going to be a great adventure." 
</P>
<P>
"And that's exactly what it was," O'Toole said. "It's a journey I would travel 
again, every mile of the way, willingly." 
</P>
<P>
Like O'Toole, Omar Sharif also emerged from the picture an international star. 
"With a part like Ali in a film like 'Lawrence,' any idiot would have become a 
film star," he said during a phone conversation from Paris. 
</P>
<P>
"Working with Lean is always an event," Sharif said, "because he takes such 
enormous care for every single shot. Therefore, everyone feels that he or she 
is contributing to something special, and indeed, you are." 
</P>
<P>
By way of example, Sharif described the first scene he filmed, in which his 
character, a sheik, comes riding out of the desert and confronts Lawrence at 
the well. 
</P>
<P>
"It took one month to film that brief sequence," Sharif said. "Not all the 
month was spent in filming, of course. There was much waiting for the right 
conditions. David had clear ideas about the look he wanted for the desert. He 
would place black rocks in the distance. He would even color the sand to 
attract the viewer's eye. Then, after they'd driven out and done all that, 300 
men had to sweep away the tire tracks. 
</P>
<P>
"I still know that entire scene by heart. It was a pleasure to act those words 
by Robert Bolt. They're all short one-syllable words, but they say everything. 
This is exactly what film writing should be." 
</P>
<P>
Sharif worked on "Lawrence" for 20 months. (Three years later, again under 
Lean's direction, he spent only 12 months filming his title-role performance in 
"Doctor Zhivago.") 
</P>
<P>
"All the work in the desert was exhausting," he said. "Camels don't stay on 
their marks. They have larger strides than horses. If a camel leaves its mark 
by even one step, you've moved three feet out of the frame." 
</P>
<P>
Sharif, who rates "Lawrence of Arabia" as "David Lean's best film," said he 
will "be thrilled" to see the newly restored director's cut. "But I'll also 
look at that young actor on the screen with 15 missing pounds." 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Quinn was already an international star, a two-time Academy Award 
winner, when he traveled to Jordan to portray a tribal sheik. 
</P>
<P>
"I fell in love with David Lean immediately," Quinn said as he sat in a Los 
Angeles hotel suite. "David is one of the greatest directors alive. He lives in 
the atmosphere of the picture. He never leaves that picture for one second. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a man of very long pauses, and when he says something, it's after long 
consideration. It's sifted through his genius, and then the flower blooms. And 
he makes that flower bloom in you. Through his own tremendous humanity, he 
brings out all the actor's positive qualities." 
</P>
<P>
Lean spent all morning staging a scene "with thousands of camels and horses and 
riders" in which Lawrence asks Auda if they can attack the Turkish-held city of 
Aqaba the next day. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, at noon, the shot was set up. 
</P>
<P>
"So we rehearsed," Quinn recalled, "and David said, 'Let's go for a take.' I 
started to walk back into the scene when David, who is a very sensitive man, 
called me aside and asked if something was the matter. 
</P>
<P>
"No, no, David, let's do the scene.' It had taken four hours to set the thing 
up! 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'No, I want to know what's the matter.' 
</P>
<P>
"So I told him that because I know there's going to be a huge battle in which 
I'll lose a lot of men, perhaps I should go over, sit on a rock and think about 
my answer. I should say, 'Yes, we attack tomorrow,' but only after due 
consideration for my men. 
</P>
<P>
"David thought a moment, took a long drag from his cigarette -- which he smokes 
in the most amazing way, upside down -- and then said, 'Start moving the 
horses, we're going to change the camera angle.' 
</P>
<P>
"It took all afternoon. I was so embarrassed. And by the time it was ready, at 
4:30, we had to do the scene in one take or lose the sun. 
</P>
<P>
"So we did it and wrapped for the day. 
</P>
<P>
"As David was getting into his car, I went up to him and said, 'David, I 
apologize.' 
</P>
<P>
"He says, 'For what, Tony?' 
</P>
<P>
"It was terrible to make you change the horses and the extras. I promise I'll 
never do it again.' 
</P>
<P>
"And he says, 'Don't you ever stop. You can suggest anything you want. I'm not 
that insecure.' " 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to O'Toole, Sharif and Quinn, Jose Ferrer worked on "Lawrence of 
Arabia" for only three days and appears on screen for just five minutes. But to 
the Academy Award-winning star, whose motion picture roles span more than four 
decades, they're the most important five minutes of his film career. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrer recalled his brief but critical vignette during a phone conversation 
from Minneapolis, where he was filming "Old Explorers" with James Whitmore. 
Ferrer played the Turkish bey, whose humiliation and torture of Lawrence was a 
turning point in the adventurer's life, 
</P>
<P>
In late 1961 and early '62, Ferrer said, while the others were in Jordan, he 
was in India filming "Nine Hours to Rama." 
</P>
<P>
"We finished the picture in London," he continued. "One day I bumped into Sam 
Spiegel in Berkeley Square. He saw me and said, 'You're just the guy I'm 
looking for. I still need to cast one role in 'Lawrence of Arabia.' 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Send me the script.' 
</P>
<P>
"So this massive script arrived, hundreds of pages long, and I couldn't find 
the part. It turned out to be maybe three pages and two lines. I said to my 
agent, 'Why is Spiegel trying to humiliate me? Why does he insult me?' I was 
very hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"But they showed me 30 minutes of already-assembled footage. I could see it was 
something quite special, though I didn't realize how special until I arrived in 
Seville. 
</P>
<P>
"There was very little conversation on the set, but we didn't need to talk. 
David Lean, Peter O'Toole and I were instantly so in tune with each other, it 
was almost like being part of a string trio. O'Toole and Lean were Champagne 
and caviar. 
</P>
<P>
"In 40 years of screen acting, I've made maybe 40 movies. But if I had to be 
judged as a film actor by only one performance, I would want to be judged by 
the five minutes in 'Lawrence of Arabia.' I deem those five minutes to be my 
best work." 
</P>

 "Lawrence of Arabia" opens here Wednesday. A premiere to benefit the American 
Film Institute is scheduled for Sunday.
